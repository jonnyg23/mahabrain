 <center><h1>                ALADDIN; OR, THE WONDERFUL LAMP
 </h1></center><p>  IT hath reached me, O King of the Age, that there dwelt in a city of
 the cities of China a man which was a tailor, withal a pauper, and
 he had one son, Aladdin hight. Now this boy had been from his babyhood
 a ne'er-do-well, a scapegrace. And when he reached his tenth year, his
 father inclined to teach him his own trade, and, for that he was
 overindigent to expend money upon his learning other work or craft
 or apprenticeship, he took the lad into his shop that he might be
 taught tailoring. But, as Aladdin was a scapegrace and a ne'er-do-well
 and wont to play at all times with the gutter boys of the quarter,
 he would not sit in the shop for a single day. Nay, he would await his
 father's leaving it for some purpose, such as to meet a creditor, when
 he would run off at once and fare forth to the gardens with the
 other scapegraces and low companions, his fellows. Such was his
 case- counsel and castigation were of no avail, nor would he obey
 either parent in aught or learn any trade. And presently, for his
 sadness and, sorrowing because of his son's vicious indolence, the
 tailor sickened and died.
 </p><p>  Aladdin continued in his former ill courses, and when his mother saw
 that her spouse had deceased and that her son was a scapegrace and
 good for nothing at all, she sold the shop and whatso was to be
 found therein and fell to spinning cotton yarn. By this toilsome
 industry she fed herself and found food for her son Aladdin the
 scapegrace, who, seeing himself freed from bearing the severities of
 his sire, increased in idleness and low habits. Nor would he ever stay
 at home save at meal hours while his miserable wretched mother lived
 only by what her hands could spin until the youth had reached his
 fifteenth year. It befell one day of the days that as he was sitting
 about the quarter at play with the vagabond boys, behold, a dervish
 from the Maghrib, the Land of the Setting Sun, came up and stood
 gazing for solace upon the lads. And he looked hard at Aladdin and
 carefully considered his semblance, scarcely noticing his companions
 the while. Now this dervish was a Moorman from Inner Morocco, and he
 was a magician who could upheap by his magic hill upon hill, and he
 was also an adept in astrology. So after narrowly considering Aladdin,
 he said in himself, "Verily, this is the lad I need and to find whom I
 have left my natal land." Presently he led one of the children apart
 and questioned him anent the scapegrace saying, "Whose son is he?" And
 he sought all information concerning his condition and whatso
 related to him.
 </p><p>  After this he walked up to Aladdin, and drawing him aside, asked, "O
 my son, haply thou art the child of Such-a-one the tailor?" and the
 lad answered, "Yes, O my lord, but 'tis long since he died." The
 Maghrabi, the magician, hearing these words, threw himself upon
 Aladdin and wound his arms around his neck and fell to bussing him,
 weeping the while with tears trickling a-down his cheeks. But when the
 lad saw the Moorman's case, he was seized with surprise thereat and
 questioned him, saying, "What causeth thee weep, O my lord, and how
 camest thou to know my father?" "How canst thou, O my son," replied
 the Moorman, in a soft voice saddened by emotion, "question me with
 such query after informing me that thy father and my brother is
 deceased? For that he was my brother german, and now I come from my
 adopted country and after long exile I rejoiced with exceeding joy
 in the hope of looking upon him once more and condoling with him
 over the past. And now thou hast announced to me his demise. But blood
 hideth not from blood, and it hath revealed to me that thou art my
 nephew, son of my brother, and I knew thee amongst all the lads,
 albeit thy father, when I parted from him, was yet unmarried."
 </p><p>  Then he again clasped Aladdin to his bosom, crying: "O my son, I
 have none to condole with now save thyself. And thou standest in stead
 of thy sire, thou being his issue and representative and 'whoso
 leaveth issue dieth not,' O my child!" So saying, the magician put
 hand to purse, and pulling out ten gold pieces, gave them to the
 lad, asking, "O my son, where is your house and where dwelleth she,
 thy mother and my brother's widow?" Presently Aladdin arose with him
 and showed him the way to their home, and meanwhile quoth the
 wizard: "O my son, take these moneys and give them to thy mother,
 greeting her from me, and let her know that thine uncle, thy
 father's brother, hath reappeared from his exile and that
 Inshallah- God willing- on the morrow I will visit her to salute her
 with the salaam and see the house wherein my brother was homed and
 look upon the place where he lieth buried." Thereupon Aladdin kissed
 the Maghrabi's hand, and after running in his joy at fullest speed
 to his mother's dwelling entered to her clean contrariwise to his
 custom, inasmuch as he never came near her save at mealtimes only.
 </p><p>  And when he found her, the lad exclaimed in his delight: "O my
 mother, I give thee glad tidings of mine uncle who hath returned
 from his exile, and who now sendeth me to salute thee." "O my son,"
 she replied, "meseemeth thou mockest me! Who is this uncle, and how
 canst thou have an uncle in the bonds of life?" He rejoined: "How
 sayest thou, O my mother, that I have no living uncles nor kinsmen,
 when this man is my father's own brother? Indeed he embraced me and
 bussed me, shedding tears the while, and bade me acquaint thee
 herewith." She retorted, "O my son, well I wot thou haddest an
 uncle, but he is now dead, nor am I ware that thou hast other eme."
 </p><p>  The Moroccan magician fared forth next morning and fell to finding
 out Aladdin, for his heart no longer permitted him to part from the
 lad. And as he was to-ing and fro-ing about the city highways, he came
 face to face with him disporting himself, as was his wont, amongst the
 vagabonds and the scapegraces. So he drew near to him, and taking
 his hand, embraced him and bussed him. Then pulled out of his poke two
 dinars and said: "Hie thee to thy mother and give her these couple
 of ducats and tell her that thine uncle would eat the evening meal
 with you. So do thou take these two gold pieces and prepare for us a
 succulent supper. But before all things, show me once more the way
 to your home." "On my head and mine eyes be it, O my uncle," replied
 the lad and forewent him, pointing out the street leading to the
 house. Then the Moorman left him and went his ways and Aladdin ran
 home and, giving the news and the two sequins to his parent, said, "My
 uncle would sup with us."
 </p><p>  So she arose straightway and, going to the market street, bought all
 she required. Then, returning to her dwelling, she borrowed from the
 neighbors whatever was needed of pans and platters, and so forth,
 and when the meal was cooked and suppertime came she said to
 Aladdin: "O my child, the meat is ready, but peradventure thine
 uncle wotteth not the way to our dwelling. So do thou fare forth and
 meet him on the road." He replied, "To hear is to obey," and before
 the twain ended talking a knock was heard at the door. Aladdin went
 out and opened, when, behold, the Maghrabi, the magician, together
 with a eunuch carrying the wine and the dessert fruits. So the lad led
 them in and the slave went about his business. The Moorman on entering
 saluted his sister-in-law with the salaam, then began to shed tears
 and to question her, saying, "Where be the place whereon my brother
 went to sit?" She showed it to him, whereat he went up to it and
 prostrated himself in prayer and kissed the floor, crying: how scant
 is my satisfaction and how luckless is my lot, for that I have lost
 thee, O my brother, O vein of my eye!" And after such fashion he
 continued weeping and wailing till he swooned away for excess of
 sobbing and lamentation, wherefor Aladdin's mother was certified of
 his soothfastness. So, coming up to him, she raised him from the floor
 and said, "What gain is there in slaying thyself?"
 </p><p>  As soon as he was seated at his ease, and before the food trays were
 served up, he fell to talking with her and saying: "O wife of my
 brother, it must be a wonder to thee how in all thy days thou never
 sawest me nor learnst thou aught of me during the lifetime of my
 brother who hath found mercy. Now the reason is that forty years ago I
 left this town and exiled myself from my birthplace and wandered forth
 over all the lands of Al-Hind and Al-Sind and entered Egypt and
 settled for a long time in its magnificent city, which is one of the
 world wonders, till at last I fared to the regions of the setting
 sun and abode for a space of thirty years in the Moroccan interior.
 Now one day of the days, O wife of my brother, as I was sitting
 alone at home, I fell to thinking of mine own country and of my
 birthplace and of my brother (who hath found mercy). And my yearning
 to see him waxed excessive and I bewept and bewailed my strangerhood
 and distance from him. And at last my longings drave me homeward until
 I resolved upon traveling to the region which was the falling place of
 my head and my homestead, to the end that I might again see my
 brother. Then quoth I to myself: 'O man, how long wilt thou wander
 like a wild Arab from thy place of birth and native stead? Moreover,
 thou hast one brother and no more, so up with thee and travel and look
 upon him ere thou die, for who wotteth the woes of the world and the
 changes of the days? 'Twould be saddest regret an thou lie down to die
 without beholding thy brother. And Allah (laud be to the Lord!) hath
 vouchsafed thee ample wealth, and belike he may be straitened and in
 poor case, when thou wilt aid thy brother as well as see him.'
 </p><p>  "So I arose at once and equipped me for wayfare and recited the
 fatihah. Then, whenas Friday prayers ended, I mounted and traveled
 to this town, after suffering manifold toils and travails which I
 patiently endured whilst the Lord (to Whom be honor and glory!) veiled
 me with the veil of His protection. So I entered, and whilst wandering
 about the streets the day before yesterday I beheld my brother's son
 Aladdin disporting himself with the boys and, by God the Great, O wife
 of my brother, the moment I saw him this heart of mine went forth to
 him (for blood yearneth unto blood!), and my soul felt and informed me
 that he was my very nephew. So I forgot all my travails and troubles
 at once on sighting him, and I was like to fly for joy. But when he
 told me of the dear one's departure to the ruth of Allah Almighty, I
 fainted for stress of distress and disappointment. Perchance, however,
 my nephew hath informed thee of the pains which prevailed upon me. But
 after a fashion I am consoled by the sight of Aladdin, the legacy
 bequeathed to us by him who hath found mercy for that 'whoso leaveth
 issue is not wholly dead.'"
 </p><p>  And when he looked at his sister-in-law, she wept at these his
 words, so he turned to the lad, that he might cause her to forget
 the mention of her mate, as a means of comforting her and also of
 completing his deceit, and asked him, saying: "O my son Aladdin, what
 hast thou learned in the way of work, and what is thy business? Say
 me, hast thou mastered any craft whereby to earn a livelihood for
 thyself and for thy mother?" The lad was abashed and put to shame
 and he hung down his head and bowed his brow groundward. But his
 parent spake out: "How, forsooth? By Allah, he knoweth nothing at all,
 a child so ungracious as this I never yet saw- no, never! All the day
 long he idleth away his time with the sons of the quarter, vagabonds
 like himself, and his father (O regret of me!) died not save of
 dolor for him. And I also am now in piteous plight. I spin cotton
 and toil at my distant night and day, that I may earn me a couple of
 scones of bread which we eat together. This is his condition, O my
 brother-in-law, and, by the life of thee, he cometh not near me save
 at mealtimes, and none other. Indeed, I am thinking to lock the
 house door, nor ever open to him again, but leave him to go and seek a
 livelihood whereby he can live, for that I am now grown a woman in
 years and have no longer strength to toil and go about for a
 maintenance after this fashion. O Allah, I am compelled to provide him
 with daily bread when I require to be provided!"
 </p><p>  Hereat the Moorman turned to Aladdin and said: "Why is this, O son
 of my brother, thou goest about in such ungraciousness? 'Tis a
 disgrace to thee and unsuitable for men like thyself. Thou art a youth
 of sense, O my son, and the child of honest folk, so 'tis for thee a
 shame that thy mother, a woman in years, should struggle to support
 thee. And now that thou hast grown to man's estate, it becometh thee
 to devise thee some device whereby thou canst live, O my child. Look
 around thee and Alhamdolillah- praise be to Allah- in this our town
 are many teachers of all manner of crafts, and nowhere are they more
 numerous. So choose thee some calling which may please thee to the end
 that I stablish thee therein, and when thou growest up, O my son, thou
 shalt have some business whereby to live. Haply thy father's
 industry may not be to thy liking, and if so it be, choose thee some
 other handicraft which suiteth thy fancy. Then let me know and I
 will aid thee with all I can, O my son." But when the Maghrabi saw
 that Aladdin kept silence and made him no reply, he knew that the
 lad wanted none other occupation than a scapegrace life, so he said to
 him: "O son of my brother, let not my words seem hard and harsh to
 thee, for if despite all I say thou still dislike to learn a craft,
 I will open thee a merchant's store furnished with costliest stuffs
 and thou shalt become famous amongst the folk and take and give and
 buy and sell and be well known in the city."
 </p><p>  Now when Aladdin heard the words of his uncle the Moorman, and the
 design of making him a khwajah- merchant and gentleman- he joyed
 exceedingly, knowing that such folk dress handsomely and fare
 delicately. So he looked at the Maghrabi smiling and drooping his head
 groundward and saying with the tongue of the case that he was content.
 The Maghrabi the magician, looked at Aladdin and saw him smiling
 whereby he understood that the lad was satisfied to become a trader.
 So he said to him: "Since thou art content that I open thee a
 merchant's store and make thee a gentleman, do thou, O son of my
 brother, prove thyself a man and Inshallah- God willing- tomorrow I
 will take thee to the bazaar in the first place have a fine suit of
 clothes cut out for thee, such gear as merchants wear; and secondly, I
 will look after a store for thee and keep my word."
 </p><p>  Now Aladdin's mother had somewhat doubted the Moroccan being her
 brother-in-law, but as soon as she heard his promise of opening a
 merchant's store for her son and setting him up with stuffs and
 capital and so forth, the woman decided and determined in her mind
 that this Maghrabi was in very sooth her husband's brother, seeing
 that no stranger man would do such goodly deed by her son. So she
 began directing the lad to the right road and teaching him to cast
 ignorance from out his head and to prove himself a man. Moreover,
 she bade him ever obey his excellent uncle as though he were his
 son, and to make up for the time he had wasted in frowardnes with
 his fellows. After this she arose and spread the table, then served up
 supper, so all sat down and fell to eating and drinking while the
 Maghrabi conversed with Aladdin upon matters of business and the like,
 rejoicing him to such degree that he enjoyed no sleep that night.
 But when the Moorman saw that the dark hours were passing by, and
 the wine was drunken, he arose and sped to his own stead. But ere
 going he agreed to return next morning and take Aladdin and look to
 his suit of merchant's clothes being cut out for him.
 </p><p>  And as soon as it was dawn, behold, the Maghrabi rapped at the door,
 which was opened by Aladdin's mother. The Moorman, however, would
 not enter, but asked to take the lad with him to the market street.
 Accordingly Aladdin went forth to his uncle and, wishing him good
 morning, kissed his hand, and the Moroccan took him by the hand and
 fared with him to the bazaar. There he entered a clothier's shop
 containing all kinds of clothes, and called for a suit of the most
 sumptuous, whereat the merchant brought him out his need, all wholly
 fashioned and ready sewn, and the Moorman said to the lad, "Choose,
 O my child, whatso pleaseth thee." Aladdin rejoiced exceedingly,
 seeing that his uncle had given him his choice, so he picked out the
 suit most to his own liking and the Moroccan paid to the merchant
 the price thereof in ready money. Presently he led the lad to the
 hammam baths, where they bathed. Then they came out and drank
 sherbets, after which Aladdin arose and, donning his new dress in huge
 joy and delight, went up to his uncle and kissed his hand and
 thanked him for his favors.
 </p><p>  The Maghrabi, the magician, after leaving the hammam with Aladdin,
 took him and trudged with him to the merchants' bazaar, and having
 diverted him by showing the market and its sellings and buyings, and
 to him: "O my son, it besitteth thee to become familiar with the folk,
 especially with the merchants, so thou mayest learn of them merchant
 craft, seeing that the same hath now become thy calling." Then he
 led him forth and showed him the city and its cathedral mosques,
 together with all the pleasant sights therein, and lastly made him
 enter a cook's shop. Here dinner was served to them on platters of
 silver and they dined well and ate and drank their sufficiency,
 after which they went their ways. Presently the Moorman pointed out to
 Aladdin the pleasaunces and noble buildings, and went in with him to
 the Sultan's palace and diverted him with displaying all the
 apartments, which were mighty fine and grand, and led him finally to
 the khan of stranger merchants, where he himself had his abode. Then
 the Moroccan invited sundry traders which were in the caravanserai,
 and they came and sat down to supper, when he notified to them that
 the youth was his nephew, Aladdin by name. And after they had eaten
 and drunken and night had fallen, he rose up, and taking the lad
 with him, led him back to his mother, who no sooner saw her boy as
 he were one of the merchants than her wits took flight and she waxed
 sad for very gladness.
 </p><p>  Then she fell to thanking her false connection, the Moorman, for all
 his benefits and said to him: "O my brother-in-law, I can never say
 enough though I expressed my gratitude to thee during the rest of
 thy days and praised thee for the good deeds thou hast done by this my
 child." Thereupon quoth the Moroccan: "O wife of my brother, deem this
 not mere kindness of me, for that the lad is mine own son, and 'tis
 incumbent on me to stand in the stead of my brother, his sire. So be
 thou fully satisfied!" And quoth she: "I pray Allah by the honor of
 the Hallows, the ancients and the moderns, that He preserve thee and
 cause thee continue, O my brother-in-law, and prolong for me thy life.
 So shalt thou be a wing overshadowing this orphan lad, and he shall
 ever be obedient to thine orders, nor shall he do aught save whatso
 thou biddest him thereunto."
 </p><p>  The Maghrabi replied: "O wife of my brother, Aladdin is now a man of
 sense and the son of goodly folk, and I hope to Allah that he will
 follow in the footsteps of his sire and cool thine eyes. But I
 regret that, tomorrow being Friday, I shall not be able to open his
 shop, as 'tis meeting day when all the merchants, after congregational
 prayer, go forth to the gardens and pleasaunces. On the Sabbath,
 however, Inshallah!- an it please the Creator- we will do our
 business. Meanwhile tomorrow I will come to thee betimes and take
 Aladdin for a pleasant stroll to the gardens and pleasaunces without
 the city, which haply he may hitherto not have beheld. There also he
 shall see the merchants and notables who go forth to amuse themselves,
 so shall he become acquainted with them and they with him."
 </p><p>  The Maghrabi went away and lay that night in his quarters, and early
 next morning he came to the tailor's house and rapped at the door. Now
 Aladdin (for stress of his delight in the new dress he had donned
 and for the past day's enjoyment in the hammam and in eating and
 drinking and gazing at the folk, expecting futhermore his uncle to
 come at dawn and carry him off on pleasuring to the gardens) had not
 slept a wink that night, nor-closed his eyelids, and would hardly
 believe it when day broke. But hearing the knock at the door, he
 went out at once in hot haste, like a spark of fire, and opened and
 saw his uncle, the magician, who embraced him and kissed him. Then,
 taking his hand, the Moorman said to him as they fared forth together,
 "O son of my brother, this day will I show thee a sight thou never
 sawest in all thy life," and he began to make the lad laugh and
 cheer him with pleasant talk. So doing, they left the city gate, and
 the Moroccan took to promenading with Aladdin amongst the gardens
 and to pointing out for his pleasure the mighty fine pleasaunces and
 the marvelous high-builded pavilions. And whenever they stood to stare
 at a garth or a mansion or a palace, the Maghrabi would say to his
 companion, "Doth this please thee, O son of my brother?"
 </p><p>  Aladdin was nigh to fly with delight at seeing sights he had never
 seen in all his born days, and they ceased not to stroll about and
 solace themselves until they waxed a-weary, then they entered a mighty
 grand garden which was near-hand, a place that the heart delighted and
 the sight belighted, for that its swift-running rills flowed amidst
 the flowers and the waters jetted from the jaws of lions molded in
 yellow brass like unto gold. So they took seat over against a
 lakelet and rested a little while, and Aladdin enjoyed himself with
 joy exceeding and fell to jesting with his uncle and making merry with
 him as though the magician were really his father's brother.
 </p><p>  Presently the Maghrabi arose, and loosing his girdle, drew forth
 from thereunder a bag full of victual, dried fruits and so forth,
 saying to Aladdin: "O my nephew, haply thou art become a-hungered,
 so come forward and eat what thou needest." Accordingly the lad fell
 upon the food and the Moorman ate with him, and they were gladdened
 and cheered by rest and good cheer. Then quoth the magician: "Arise, O
 son of my brother, an thou be reposed, and let us stroll onward a
 little and reach the end of our walk." Thereupon Aladdin arose and the
 Moroccan paced with him from garden to garden until they left all
 behind them and reached the base of a high and naked hill, when the
 lad, who during all his days had never issued from the city gate and
 never in his life had walked such a walk as this, said to the
 Maghrabi: "O uncle mine, whither are we wending? We have left the
 gardens behind us one and all and have reached the barren hill
 country. And if the way be still long, I have no strength left for
 walking. Indeed I am ready to fall with fatigue. There are no
 gardens before us, so let us hark back and return to town." Said the
 magician: "No, O my son. This is right road, nor are the gardens
 ended, for we are going to look at one which hath ne'er its like
 amongst those of the kings, and all thou hast beheld are naught in
 comparison therewith. Then gird thy courage to walk. Thou art now a
 man, Alhamdolillah- praise be to Allah!"
 </p><p>  Then the Maghrabi fell to soothing Aladdin with soft words and
 telling him wondrous tales, lies as well as truth, until they
 reached the site intended by the African magician, who had traveled
 from the sunset land to the regions of China for the sake thereof. And
 when they made the place, the Moorman said to Aladdin: "O son of my
 brother, sit thee down and take thy rest, for this is the spot we
 are now seeking and, Inshallah, soon will I divert thee by
 displaying marvel matters whose like not one in the world ever saw,
 nor hath any solaced himself with gazing upon that which thou art
 about to behold. But when thou art rested, arise and seek some wood
 chips and fuel sticks which be small and dry, wherewith we may
 kindle a fire. Then will I show thee, O son of my brother, matters
 beyond the range of matter." Now when the lad heard these words, he
 longed to look upon what his uncle was about to do and, forgetting his
 fatigue, he rose forthright and fell to gathering small wood chips and
 dry sticks, and continued until the Moorman cried to him, "Enough, O
 son of my brother!"
 </p><p>  Presently the magician brought out from his breast pocker a
 casket, which he opened, and drew from it all he needed of incense.
 Then he fumigated and conjured and adjured, muttering words none might
 understand. And the ground straightway clave asunder after thick gloom
 and quake of earth and bellowings of thunder. Hereat Aladdin was
 startled and so affrighted that he tried to fly, but when the
 African magician saw his design, he waxed wroth with exceeding
 wrath, for that without the lad his work would profit him naught,
 the hidden hoard which he sought to open being not to be opened save
 by means of Aladdin. So, noting this attempt to run away, the magician
 arose, and raising his hand, smote Aladdin on the head a buffet so
 sore that well-nigh his back teeth were knocked out, and he fell
 swooning to the ground. But after a time he revived by the magic of
 the magician, and cried, weeping the while: "O my uncle, what have I
 done that deserveth from thee such a blow as this?" Hereat the
 Maghrabi fell to soothing him, and said: "O my son, 'tis my intent
 to make thee a man. Therefore do thou not gainsay me, for that I am
 thine uncle and like unto thy father. Obey me, therefore, in all I bid
 thee, and shortly thou shalt forget all this travail and toil whenas
 thou shalt look upon the marvel matters I am about to show thee."
 </p><p>  And soon after the ground had cloven asunder before the Moroccan, it
 displayed a marble slab wherein was fixed a copper ring. The Maghrabi,
 striking a geomantic table, turned to Aladdin and said to him: "An
 thou do all I shall bid thee, indeed thou shalt become wealthier
 than any of the kings. And for this reason, O my son, I struck thee,
 because here lieth a hoard which is stored in thy name, and yet thou
 designedst to leave it and to levant. But now collect thy thoughts,
 and behold how I opened earth by my spells and adjurations. Under
 yon stone wherein the ring is set lieth the treasure wherewith I
 acquainted thee. So set thy hand upon the ring and raise the slab, for
 that none other amongst the folk, thyself excepted, hath power to open
 it, nor may any of mortal birth save thyself set foot within this
 enchanted treasury which hath been kept for thee. But 'tis needful
 that thou learn of me all wherewith I would charge thee, nor gainsay
 e'en a single syllable of my words. All this, O my child, is for thy
 good, the hoard being of immense value, whose like the kings of the
 world never accumulated, and do thou remember that 'tis for thee and
 me."
 </p><p>  So poor Aladdin forgot his fatigue and buffet and tear-shedding, and
 he was dumbed and dazed at the Maghrabi's words and rejoiced that he
 was fated to become rich in such measure that not even the sultans
 would be richer than himself. Accordingly he cried: "O my uncle, bid
 me do all thou pleasest, for I will be obedient unto thy bidding." The
 Maghrabi replied: "O my nephew, thou art to me as my own child and
 even dearer, for being my brother's son and for my having none other
 kith and kin except thyself. And thou, O my child, art my heir and
 successor." So saying, he went up to Aladdin and kissed him and
 said: "For whom do I intend these my labors? Indeed, each and every
 are for thy sake, O my son, to the end that I may leave thee a rich
 man and one of the very greatest. So gainsay me not in all I shall say
 to thee, and now go up to yonder ring and uplift it as I bade thee."
 Aladdin answered: "O uncle mine, this ring is overheavy for me. I
 cannot raise it single-handed, so do thou also come forward and lend
 me strength and aidance toward uplifting it, for indeed I am young
 in years." The Moorman replied: "O son of my brother, we shall find it
 impossible to do aught if I assist thee, and all our efforts would
 be in vain. But do thou set thy hand upon the ring and pull it up, and
 thou shalt raise the slab forthright, and in very sooth I told thee
 that none can touch it save thyself. But whilst haling at it cease not
 to pronounce thy name and the names of thy father and mother, so
 'twill rise at once to thee, nor shalt thou feel its weight."
 </p><p>  Thereupon the lad mustered up strength and girt the loins of
 resolution and did as the Moroccan had bidden him, and hove up the
 slab with all ease when he pronounced his name and the names of his
 parents, even as the magician had bidden him. And as soon as the stone
 was raised he threw it aside, and there appeared before him a
 sardab, a souterrain, whereunto led a case of some twelve stairs,
 and the Maghrabi said: "O Aladdin, collect thy thoughts and do
 whatso I bid thee to the minutest detail, nor fail in aught thereof.
 Go down with all care into yonder vault until thou reach the bottom,
 and there shalt thou find a space divided into four halls, and in each
 of these thou shalt see four golden jars and others of virgin or and
 silver. Beware, however, lest thou take aught therefrom or touch them,
 nor allow thy gown or its skirts even to brush the jars or the
 walls. Leave them and fare forward until thou reach the fourth hall,
 without lingering for a single moment on the way. And if thou do aught
 contrary thereto, thou wilt at once be transformed and become a
 black stone. When reaching the fourth hall, thou wilt find therein a
 door, which do thou open, and pronouncing the names thou spakest
 over the slab, enter therethrough into a garden adorned everywhere
 with fruit-bearing trees. This thou must traverse by a path thou wilt
 see in front of thee measuring some fifty cubits long beyond which
 thou wilt come upon an open saloon, and herein a ladder of some thirty
 rungs. Thou shalt there find a lamp hanging from its ceiling, so mount
 the ladder and take that lamp and place it in thy breast pocket
 after pouring out its contents. Nor fear evil from it for thy clothes,
 because its contents are not common oil. And on return thou art
 allowed to pluck from the trees whoso thou pleasest, for all is
 thine so long as the lamp is in thy hand."
 </p><p>  Now when the Moorman ended his charge to Aladdin, he drew off a seal
 ring and put it upon the lad's forefinger, saying: "O my son, verily
 this signet shall free thee from all hurt and fear which may
 threaten thee, but only on condition that thou bear in mind all I have
 told thee. So arise straightway and go down the stairs,
 strengthening thy purpose and girding the loins of resolution.
 Moreover, fear not, for thou art now a man and no longer a child.
 And in shortest time, O my son, thou shalt will thee immense riches
 and thou shalt become the wealthiest of the world."
 </p><p>  Accordingly, Aladdin arose and descended into the souterrain,
 where he found the four jars, each containing four jars of gold, and
 these he passed by as the Moroccan had bidden him, with the utmost
 care and caution. Thence he fared into the garden and walked along its
 length until he entered the saloon, where he mounted the ladder and
 took the lamp, which he extinguished, pouring out the oil which was
 therein, and placed it in his breast pocket. Presently, descending the
 ladder, he returned to the garden, where he fell to gazing at the
 trees, whereupon sat birds glorifying with loud voices their Great
 Creator. Now he had not observed them as he went in, but all these
 trees bare for fruitage costly gems. Moreover, each had its own kind
 of growth and jewels of its peculiar sort and these were of every
 color, green and white, yellow, red, and other such brilliant hues,
 and the radiance flashing from these gems paled the rays of the sun in
 forenoon sheen. Furthermore the size of each stone so far surpassed
 description that no King of the Kings of the World owned a single
 gem equal to the larger sort, nor could boast of even one half the
 size of the smaller kind of them. Aladdin walked amongst the trees and
 gazed upon them and other things which surprised the sight and
 bewildered the wits, and as he considered them, he saw that in lieu of
 common fruits the produce was of mighty fine jewels and precious
 stones, such as emeralds and diamonds, rubies, spinels, and balases,
 pearls and similar gems, astounding the mental vision of man.
 </p><p>  And forasmuch as the lad had never beheld things like these during
 his born days, nor had reached those years of discretion which would
 teach him the worth of such valuables (he being still but a little
 lad), he fancied that all these jewels were of glass or crystal. So he
 collected them until he had filled his breast pockets, and began to
 certify himself if they were or were not common fruits, such as
 grapes, figs, and suchlike edibles. But seeing them of glassy
 substance, he, in his ignorance of precious stones and their prices,
 gathered into his breast pockets every kind of growth the trees
 afforded, and having failed of his purpose in finding them food, he
 said in his mind, "I will collect a portion of these glass fruits
 for playthings at home." So he fell to plucking them in quantities and
 cramming them in his pokes and breast pockets till these were
 stuffed full. After which he picked others which he placed in his
 waist shawl and then, girding himself therewith, carried off all he
 availed to, purposing to place them in the house by way of ornaments
 and, as hath been mentioned, never imagining that they were other than
 glass.
 </p><p>  Then he hurried his pace in fear of his uncle, the Maghrabi, until
 he had passed through the four halls and lastly on his return
 reached the souterrain, where he cast not a look at the jars of
 gold, albeit he was able and allowed to take of the contents on his
 way back. But when he came to the souterrain stairs and clomb the
 steps till naught remained but the last, and finding this higher
 than an the others, he was unable alone and unassisted, burthened
 moreover as he was, to mount it. So he said to the Maghrabi, "O my
 uncle, lend me thy hand and aid me to climb." But the Moorman
 answered: "O my son, give me the lamp and lighten thy load. Belike
 'tis that weighteth thee down." The lad rejoined: "O my uncle, 'tis
 not the lamp downweigheth me at all, but do thou lend me a hand, and
 as soon as I reached ground I will give it to thee." Hereat the
 Moroccan, the magician, whose only object was the lamp and none other,
 began to insist upon Aladdin giving it to him at once. But the lad
 (forasmuch as he had placed it at the bottom of his breast pocket
 and his other pouches, being full of gems, bulged outward) could not
 reach it with his fingers to hand it over, so the wizard after much
 vain persistency in requiring what his nephew was unable to give
 fell to raging with furious rage and to demanding the lamp, whilst
 Aladdin could not get at it. Yet had the lad promised truthfully
 that he would give it up as soon as he might reach ground, without
 lying thought or ill intent. But when the Moorman saw that he would
 not hand it over, he waxed wroth with wrath exceeding and cut off
 all his hopes of winning it. So he conjured and adjured and cast
 incense a-middlemost the fire, when forthright the slab made a cover
 of itself, and by the might of magic lidded the entrance. The earth
 buried the stone as it was aforetime, and Aladdin, unable to issue
 forth, remained underground.
 </p><p>  Now the sorcerer was a stranger and, as we have mentioned, no
 uncle of Aladdin's, and he had misrepresented himself and preferred
 a lying claim, to the end that he might obtain the lamp by means of
 the lad for whom this hoard had been upstored. So the accursed
 heaped the earth over him and left him to die of hunger. For this
 Maghrabi was an African of Afrikiyah proper, born in the inner
 Sunset Land, and from his earliest age upward he had been addicted
 to witchcraft and had studied and practiced every manner of occult
 science, for which unholy lore the city of Africa is notorious. And he
 ceased not to read and hear lectures until he had become a past master
 in all such knowledge. And of the abounding skill in spells and
 conjurations which he had acquired by the perusing and the lessoning
 of forty years, one day of the days he discovered by devilish
 inspiration that there lay in an extreme city of the cities of
 China, named Al-Kal'as, an immense hoard, the like whereof none of the
 kings in this world had ever accumulated. Moreover, that the most
 marvelous article in this enchanted treasure was a wonderful lamp,
 which whoso possessed could not possibly be surpassed by any man
 upon earth, either in high degree or in wealth and opulence, nor could
 the mightiest monarch of the universe attain to the all-sufficiency of
 this lamp with its might of magical means. When the Maghrabi assured
 himself by his science and saw that this hoard could be opened only by
 the presence of a lad named Aladdin, of pauper family and abiding in
 that very city, and learnt how taking it would be easy and without
 hardships, he straightway and without stay or delay equipped himself
 for a voyage to China (as we have already told), and be did what he
 did with Aladdin fancying that he would become Lord of the Lamp. But
 his attempt and his hopes were baffled and his work was clean
 wasted. Whereupon, determining to do the lad die, he heaped up the
 earth over him by gramarye to the end that the unfortunate might
 perish, reflecting that "The live man hath no murtherer." Secondly, he
 did so with the design that, as Aladdin could not come forth from
 underground, he would also be impotent to bring out the lamp from
 the souterrain. So presently he wended his ways and retired to his own
 land, Africa, a sadder man and disappointed of all his expectations.
 </p><p>  Such was the case with the wizard, but as regards Aladdin, when
 the earth was heaped over him, he began shouting to the Moorman,
 whom he believed to be his uncle, and praying him to lend a hand
 that he might issue from the souterrain and return to earth's surface.
 But however loudly he cried, none was found to reply. At that moment
 he comprehended the sleight which the Moroccan had played upon him,
 and that the man was no uncle, but a liar and a wizard. Then the
 unhappy despaired of life, and learned to his sorrow that there was no
 escape for him, so he fell to beweeping with sore weeping the calamity
 had befallen him. And after a little while he stood up and descended
 the stairs to see if Allah Almighty had lightened his grief load by
 leaving a door of issue. So he turned him to the right and to the
 left, but he saw naught save darkness and four walls closed upon
 him, for that the magician had by his magic locked all the doors and
 had shut up even the garden wherethrough the lad erst had passed, lest
 it offer him the means of issuing out upon earth's surface, and that
 he might surely die. Then Aladdin's weeping waxed sorer and his
 wailing louder whenas he found all the doors fast shut, for he had
 thought to solace himself awhile in the garden. But when he felt
 that all were locked, he fell to shedding tears and lamenting like
 unto one who hath lost his every hope, and he returned to sit upon the
 stairs of the flight whereby he had entered the souterrain.
 </p><p>  But it is a light matter for Allah (be He exalted and extolled!)
 whenas He designeth aught to say, "Be," and it becometh, for that He
 createth joy in the midst of annoy. And on this wise it was with
 Aladdin. Whilst the Maghrabi, the magician, was sending him down
 into the souterrain, he set upon his finger by way of gift a seal ring
 and said: "Verily this signet shall save thee from every strait an
 thou fall into calamity and ill shifts of time, and it shall remove
 from thee all hurt and harm, and aid thee with a strong arm whereso
 thou mayest be set." Now this was by Destiny of God the Great, that it
 might be the means of Aladdin's escape. For whilst he sat wailing
 and weeping over his case and cast away all hope of life, and utter
 misery overwhelmed him, he rubbed his hands together for excess of
 sorrow, as is the wont of the woeful. Then, raising them in
 supplication to Allah, he cried, "I testify that there is no God
 save Thou alone, the Most Great, the Omnipotent, the All-conquering,
 Quickener of the dead, Creator of man's need and Granter thereof,
 Resolver of his difficulties and duress and Bringer of joy, not of
 annoy. Thou art my sufficiency and Thou art the Truest of Trustees.
 And I bear my witness that Mohammed is Thy servant and Thine
 Apostle, and I supplicate Thee, O my God, by his favor with Thee to
 free me from this my foul plight."
 </p><p>  And whilst implored the Lord and was chafing his hands in the
 soreness of his sorrow for that had befallen him of calamity, his
 fingers chanced to rub the ring, when, lo and behold! forthright its
 familiar rose upright before him and cried: "Adsum! Thy slave
 between thy hands is come! Ask whatso thou wantest, for that I am
 the thrall of him on whose hand is the ring, the signet of my lord and
 master." Hereat the lad looked at him and saw standing before him a
 Marid like unto an Ifrit of our lord Solomon's Jinns. He trembled at
 the terrible sight, but, hearing the Slave of the Ring say, "Ask
 whatso thou wantest. Verily, I am thy thrall seeing that the signet of
 my lord be upon thy finger," he recovered his spirits and remembered
 the Moorman's saying when giving him the ring. So he rejoiced
 exceedingly and became brave and cried, "Ho, thou slave of the Lord of
 the Ring, I desire thee to set me upon the face of the earth." And
 hardly had he spoken this speech when suddenly the ground clave
 asunder and he found himself at the door of the hoard and outside it
 in full view of the world. Now for three whole days he had been
 sitting in the darkness of the treasury underground, and when the
 sheen of day and the shine of sun smote his face he found himself
 unable to keep his eyes open; so he began to unclose the lids a little
 and to close them a little until his eyeballs regained force and got
 used to the light and were purged of the noisome murk. Withal he was
 astounded at finding himself without the hoard door whereby he had
 passed in when it was opened by the Maghrabi, the magician, especially
 as the adit had been lidded and the ground had been smoothed,
 showing no sign whatever of entrance.
 </p><p>  Thereat his surprise increased until he fancied himself in another
 place, nor was his mind convinced that the stead was the same until he
 saw the spot whereupon they had kindled the fire of wood chips and
 dried sticks, and where the African wizard had conjured over the
 incense. Then he turned him rightward and leftward and sighted the
 gardens from afar and his eyes recognized the road whereby he had
 come. So he returned thanks to Allah Almighty, Who had restored him to
 the face of earth and had freed him from death after he had cut off
 all hopes of life. Presently he arose and walked along the way to
 the town, which now he knew well, until he entered the streets and
 passed on to his own home. Then he went in to his mother, and on
 seeing her, of the overwhelming stress of joy at his escape and the
 memory of past affright and the hardships he had borne and the pangs
 of hunger, he fell to the ground before his parent in a fainting
 fit. Now his mother had been passing sad since the time of his leaving
 her, and he found her moaning and crying about him. However, on
 sighting him enter the house she joyed with exceeding joy, but soon
 was overwhelmed with woe when he sank upon the ground swooning
 before her eyes. Still, she did not neglect the matter or treat it
 lightly, but at once hastened to sprinkle water upon his face, and
 after she asked of the neighbors some scents which she made him
 snuff up. And when he came round a little, he prayed her to bring
 him somewhat of food saying, "O my mother, 'tis now three days since I
 ate anything at all." Thereupon she arose and brought him what she had
 by her, then, setting it before him, said: "Come forward, O my son.
 Eat and be cheered, and when thou shalt have rested, tell me what hath
 betided and affected thee, O my child. At this present I will not
 question thee, for thou art aweary in very deed." Aladdin ate and
 drank and was cheered, and after he had rested and had recovered
 spirits he cried:
 </p><p>  "Ah, O my mother, I have a sore grievance against thee for leaving
 me to that accursed wight who strave to compass my destruction and
 designed to take my life. Know thou that I beheld death with mine
 own eyes at the hand of this damned wretch, whom thou didst to be my
 uncle, and had not Almighty Allah rescued me from him, I and thou, O
 my mother, had been cozened by the excess of this accursed's
 promises to work my welfare, and by the great show of affection
 which he manifested to us. Learn, O my mother, that this fellow is a
 sorcerer, a Moorman, an accursed, a liar, a traitor, a hypocrite,
 nor deem I that the devils under the earth are damnable as he. Allah
 abase him in his every book! Hear then, O my mother, what this
 abominable one did, and all that I shall tell thee will be soothfast
 and certain. See how the damned villain brake every promise he made,
 certifying that he would soon work all good with me. And do thou
 consider the fondness which he displayed to me and the deeds which
 he did by me, and all this only to win his wish, for his design was to
 destroy me. And Alhamdolillah- laud to the Lord- for my deliverance.
 Listen and learn, O my mother, how this accursed entreated me."
 </p><p>  Then Aladdin informed his mother of all that had befallen him,
 weeping the for stress of gladness- how the Maghrabi had led him to a
 hill wherein was hidden the hoard and how he had conjured and
 fumigated, adding: "After which, O my mother, mighty fear gat hold of
 me when the hill split and the earth gaped before me by his
 wizardry. And I trembled with terror at the rolling of thunder in mine
 ears and the murk which fell upon us when he fumigated and muttered
 spells. Seeing these horrors, I in mine affright desiped to fly, but
 when he understood mine intent, he reviled me and smote me a buffet so
 sore that it caused me swoon. However, inasmuch as the treasury was to
 be opened only by means of me, O my mother, he could not descend
 therein himself, it being in my name and not in his. And for that he
 is an ill-omened magician, he understood that I was necessary to him
 and this was his need of me." Aladdin acquainted his mother with all
 that had befallen him from the Maghrabi, the magician, and said:
 </p><p>  "After he had buffeted me, he judged it advisable to soothe me in
 order that he might send me down into the enchanted treasury, and
 first he drew from his finger a ring, which he placed upon mine. So
 I descended and found four halls all full of gold and silver, which
 counted as naught, and the accursed had charged me not to touch
 aught thereof. Then I entered a mighty fine flower garden everywhere
 bedecked with tall trees whose foilage and fruitage bewildered the
 wits, for all, O my mother, were of varicolored glass, and lastly I
 reached the hall wherein hung this lamp. So I took it straightway
 and put it out and poured forth its contents." And so saying,
 Aladdin drew the lamp from his breast pocket and showed it to his
 mother, together with the gems and jewels which he had brought from
 the garden. And there were two large bag pockets full of precious
 stones, whereof not one was to be found amongst the kings of the
 world. But the lad knew naught anent their worth, deeming them glass
 or crystal. And presently he resumed:
 </p><p>  "After this, O mother mine, I reached the hoard door carrying the
 lamp and shouted to the accursed sorcerer which called himself my
 uncle to lend me a hand and hale me up, I being unable to mount of
 myself the last step for the overweight of my burthen. But he would
 not and said only, 'First hand me the lamp!' As, however, I had placed
 it at the bottom of my breast pocket and the other pouches bulged
 out beyond it, I was unable to get at it and said, 'O my uncle, I
 cannot reach thee the lamp, but I will give it to thee when outside
 the treasury.' His only need was the lamp, and he designed, O my
 mother, to snatch it from me and after that slay me, as indeed he
 did his best to do by heaping the earth over my head. Such then is
 what befell me from this foul sorcerer." Hereupon Aladdin fell to
 abusing the magician in hot wrath and with a burning heart, and
 crying: "Wellaway! I take refuge from this damned wight, the
 forswearer the wrongdoer, the forswearer, the lost to all humanity,
 the archtraitor, the hyprocrite, the annihilator of ruth and mercy."
 When Aladdin's mother heard his words and what had befallen him from
 the Maghrabi, the magician, she said: "Yea, verily, O my son, he is
 a miscreant, a hypocrite who murthereth the folk by his magic. But
 'twas the grace of Allah Almighty, O my child, that saved thee from
 the tricks and the treachery of this accursed sorcerer whom I deemed
 to be truly thine uncle."
 </p><p>  Then, as the lad had not slept a wink for three days and found
 himself nodding, he sought his natural rest, his mother doing on
 like wise, nor did he awake till about noon on the second day. As soon
 as he shook off slumber he called for somewhat of food, being sore
 a-hungered, but said his mother: "O my son, I have no victual for
 thee, inasmuch as yesterday thou atest all that was in the house.
 But wait patiently a while. I have spun a trifle of yarn which I will
 carry to the market street and sell it and buy with what it may be
 worth some victual for thee." "O my mother," said he, "keep your
 yarn and sell it not, but fetch me the lamp I brought hither that I
 may go vend it, and with its price purchase provaunt, for that I
 deem 'twill bring more money than the spinnings." So Aladdin's
 mother arose and fetched the lamp for her son, but while so doing
 she saw that it was dirty exceedingly, so that said: "O my son, here
 is the lamp, but 'tis very foul. After we shall have washed it and
 polished it 'twill sell better." Then, taking a handful of sand, she
 began to rub therewith, but she had only begun when appeared to her
 one of the Jann, whose favor was frightful and whose bulk was horrible
 big, and he was gigantic as one of the Jababirah. And forthright he
 cried to her: "Say whatso thou wantest of me. Here am I, thy slave and
 slave to whoso holdeth the lamp, and not I alone, but all the Slaves
 of the Wonderful Lamp which thou hendest in hand."
 </p><p>  She quaked and terror was sore upon her when she looked at that
 frightful form, and her tongue being tied, she could not return
 aught reply, never having been accustomed to espy similar
 semblances. Now her son was standing afar off, and he had already seen
 the Jinni of the ring which he had rubbed within the treasury, so when
 he heard the slave speaking to his parent, he hastened forward, and
 snatching the lamp from her hand, said: "O Slave of the Lamp, I am
 a-hungered, and 'tis my desire that thou fetch me somewhat to eat, and
 let it be something toothsome beyond our means." The Jinni disappeared
 for an eye twinkle and returned with a mighty fine tray and precious
 of price, for that 'twas all in virginal silver, and upon it stood
 twelve golden platters of meats manifold and dainties delicate, with
 bread snowier than snow; also two silvern cups and as many black jacks
 full of wine clear-strained and long-stored. And after setting all
 these before Aladdin, he vanished from vision.
 </p><p>  Thereupon the lad went and sprinkled rose-water upon his mother's
 face and caused her snuff up perfumes pure and pungent, and said to
 her when she revived: "Rise, O mother mine, and let us eat of these
 meats wherewith Almighty Allah hath eased our poverty." But when she
 saw that mighty fine silvern tray she fell to marveling at the matter,
 and quoth she: "O my son, who be this generous, this beneficent one
 who hath abated our hunger pains and our penury? We are indeed under
 obligation to him, and meseemeth 'tis the Sultan who, hearing of our
 mean condition and our misery, hath sent us this food tray." Quoth he:
 "O my mother, this be no time for questioning. Arouse thee and let
 us eat, for we are both a-famished." Accordingly they sat down to
 the tray and fell to feeding, when Aladdin's mother tasted meats whose
 like in all her time she had never touched. So they devoured them with
 sharpened appetites and all the capacity engendered by stress of
 hunger. And secondly, the food was such that marked the tables of
 the kings. But neither of them knew whether the tray was or was not
 valuable, for never in their born days had they looked upon aught like
 it.
 </p><p>  As soon as they had finished the meal (withal leaving victual enough
 for supper and eke for the next day), they arose and washed their
 hands and sat at chat, when the mother turned to her son and said:
 "Tell me, O my child, what befell thee from the slave, the Jinni,
 now that Alhamdolillah- laud to the Lord!- we have eaten our full of
 the good things wherewith He hath favored us and thou hast no pretext
 for saying to me, 'I am a-hungered."' So Aladdin related to her all
 that took place between him and the slave what while she had sunk upon
 the ground a-swoon for sore terror, and at this she, being seized with
 mighty great surprise, said: "'Tis true, for the Jinns do present
 themselves before the sons of Adam, but I, O my son, never saw them in
 all my life, and meseemeth that this be the same who saved thee when
 thou wast within the enchanted hoard." "This is not he, O my mother.
 This who appeared before thee is the Slave of the Lamp!" "Who may this
 be, O my son?" "This be a slave of sort and shape other than he.
 That was the familiar of the ring, and this his fellow thou sawest was
 the Slave of the Lamp thou hendest in hand." And when his parent heard
 these words she cried: "There! there! So this accursed, who showed
 himself to me and went nigh unto killing me with affright, is attached
 to the lamp." "Yes," he replied, and she rejoined: "Now I conjure
 thee, O my son, by the milk wherewith I suckled thee, to throw away
 from thee this lamp and this ring, because they can cause us only
 extreme terror, and I especially can never a-bear a second glance at
 them. Moreover, all intercourse with them is unlawful, for that the
 Prophet (whom Allah save and assain!) warned us against them with
 threats."
 </p><p>  He replied: "Thy commands, O my mother, be upon my head and mine
 eyes, but as regards this saying thou saidest, 'tis impossible that
 I part or with lamp or with ring. Thou thyself hast seen what good the
 slave wrought us whenas we were famishing, and know, O my mother, that
 the Maghrabi, the liar, the magician, when sending me down into the
 hoard, sought nor the silver nor the gold wherewith the four halls
 were fulfilled, but charged me to bring him only the lamp (naught
 else), because in very deed he had learned its priceless value. And
 had he not been certified of it, he had never endured such toil and
 trouble, nor had he traveled from his own land to our land in search
 thereof, neither had he shut me up in the treasury when he despaired
 of the lamp which I would not hand to him. Therefore it besitteth
 us, O my mother, to keep this lamp and take all care thereof, nor
 disclose its mysteries to any, for this is now our means of livelihood
 and this it is shall enrich us. And likewise as regards the ring, I
 will never withdraw it from my finger, inasmuch as but for this thou
 hadst nevermore seen me on life- nay, I should have died within the
 hoard underground. How then can I possibly remove it from my finger?
 And who wotteth that which may betide me by the lapse of time, what
 trippings or calamities or injurious mishaps wherefrom this ring may
 deliver me? However, for regard to thy feelings I will stow away the
 lamp, nor ever suffer it to be seen of thee hereafter." Now when his
 mother heard his words and pondered them, she knew they were true
 and said to him: "Do, O my son, whatso thou willest. For my part, I
 wish never to see them nor ever sight that frightful spectacle I
 erst saw."
 </p><p>  Aladdin and his mother continued eating of the meats brought them by
 the Jinni for two full told days till they were finished. But when
 he learned that nothing of food remained for them, he arose and took a
 platter of the platters which the slave had brought upon the tray. Now
 they were all of the finest gold, but the lad knew naught thereof,
 so he bore it to the bazaar and there, seeing a man which was a Jew, a
 viler than the Satans, offered it to him for sale. When the Jew espied
 it, he took the lad aside that none might see him, and he looked at
 the platter and considered it till he was certified that it was of
 gold refined. But he knew not whether Aladdin was acquainted with
 its value or he was in such matters a raw laddie, so he asked him,
 "For how much, O my lord, this platter?" and the other answered, "Thou
 wottest what be its worth." The Jew debated with himself as to how
 much he should offer, because Aladdin had returned him a craftsmanlike
 reply, and he thought of the smallest valuation. At the same time he
 feared lest the lad, haply knowing its worth, should expect a
 considerable sum. So he said in his mind, "Belike the fellow is an
 ignoramus in such matters, nor is ware of the price of the platter."
 Whereupon he pulled out of his pocket a dinar, and Aladdin eyed the
 gold piece lying in his palm and, hastily taking it, went his way,
 whereby the Jew was certified of his customer's innocence of all
 such knowledge, and repented with entire repentance that he had
 given him a golden dinar in lieu of a copper carat, a
 bright-polished groat.
 </p><p>  However, Aladdin made no delay, but went at once to the baker's,
 where he bought him bread and changed the ducat. Then, going to his
 mother, he gave her the scones and the remaining small coin and
 said, "O my mother, hie thee and buy thee all we require." So she
 arose and walked to the bazaar and laid in the necessary stock,
 after which they ate and were cheered. And whenever the price of the
 platter was expended, Aladdin would take another and carry it to the
 accursed Jew, who brought each and every at a pitiful price; and
 even this he would have minished but, seeing how he had paid a dinar
 for the first, he feared to offer a lesser sum, lest the lad go and
 sell to some rival in trade and thus he lose his usurious gains. Now
 when all the golden platters were sold, there remained only the silver
 tray whereupon they stood, and for that it was large and weighty,
 Aladdin brought the Jew to his house and produced the article when the
 buyer, seeing its size, gave him ten dinars, and these being accepted,
 went his ways.
 </p><p>  Aladdin and his mother lived upon the sequins until they were spent,
 then he brought out the lamp and rubbed it, and straightway appeared
 the slave who had shown himself aforetime. And said the lad: "I desire
 that thou bring me a tray of food like unto that thou broughtest me
 erewhiles, for indeed I am famisht." Accordingly, in the glance of
 an eye the slave produced a similar tray supporting twelve platters of
 the most sumptuous, furnished with requisite cates, and thereon
 stood clean bread and sundry glass bottles of strained wine. Now
 Aladdin's mother had gone out when she knew he was about to rub the
 lamp, that she might not again look upon the Jinni; but after a
 while she returned, and when she sighted the tray covered with
 silvern platters and smelt the savor of the rich meats diffused over
 the house, she marveled and rejoiced. Thereupon quoth he: "Look, O
 my mother! Thou badest me throw away the lamp. See now its virtues,"
 and quoth she, "O my son, Allah increase his weal, but I would not
 look upon him." Then the lad sat down with his parent to the tray
 and they ate and drank until they were satisfied, after which they
 removed what remained for use on the morrow.
 </p><p>  As soon as the meats had been consumed, Aladdin arose and stowed
 away under his clothes a platter of the platters and went forth to
 find the Jew, purposing to sell it to him, but by fiat of Fate he
 passed by the shop of an ancient jeweler, an honest man and a pious
 who feared Allah. When the Sheikh saw the lad, he asked him, saying:
 "O my son, what dost thou want? For that times manifold have I seen
 thee passing hereby and having dealings with a Jewish man, and I
 have espied thee handing over to him sundry articles. Now also I fancy
 thou hast somewhat for sale and thou seekest him as a buyer thereof.
 But thou wottest not, O my child, that the Jews ever hold lawful to
 them the good of Moslems, the confessors of Allah Almighty's unity,
 and always defraud them, especially this accursed Jew with whom thou
 hast relations and into whose hands thou hast fallen. If then, O my
 son, thou have aught thou wouldest sell, show the same to me and never
 fear, for I will give thee its full price, by the truth of Almighty
 Allah."
 </p><p>  Thereupon Aladdin brought out the platter, which when the ancient
 goldsmith saw, he took and weighed it in his scales and asked the lad,
 saying, "Was it the fellow of this thou soldest to the Jew?" "Yes, its
 fellow and its brother," he answered, and quoth the old man, "What
 price did he pay thee?" Quoth the lad, "One dinar." The ancient
 goldsmith, hearing from Aladdin how the Jew used to give only one
 dinar as the price of the platter, cried, "Ah! I take refuge from this
 accursed who cozeneth the servants of Allah Almighty!" Then, looking
 at the lad, he exclaimed: "O my son, verily yon tricksy Jew hath
 cheated thee and laughed at thee, this platter being pure silver and
 virginal. I have weighed it and found it worth seventy dinars, and, if
 thou please to take its value,-take it." Thereupon the Sheikh
 counted out to him seventy gold pieces, which he accepted, and
 presently thanked him for his kindness in exposing the Jew's
 rascality.
 </p><p>  And after this, whenever the price of a platter was expended, he
 would bring another, and on such wise he and his mother were soon in
 better circumstances. Yet they ceased not to live after their olden
 fashion as middle-class folk, without spending on diet overmuch or
 squandering money. But Aladdin had now thrown off the ungraciousness
 of his boyhood. He shunned the society of scapegraces and he began
 to frequent good men and true, repairing daily to the market street of
 the merchants and there companying with the great and small of them,
 asking about matters of merchandise and learning the price of
 investments and so forth. He likewise frequented the bazaars of the
 goldsmiths and the jewelers, where he would sit and divert himself
 by inspecting their precious stones and by noting how jewels were sold
 and bought therein. Accordingly, he presently became ware that the
 tree truits wherewith he had filled his pockets what time he entered
 the enchanged treasury were neither glass nor crystal, but gems rich
 and rare, and he understood that he had acquired immense wealth such
 as the kings never can possess. He then considered all the precious
 stones which were in the jewelers' quarter, but found that their
 biggest was not worth his smallest.
 </p><p>  On this wise he ceased not every day repairing to the bazaar and
 making himself familiar with the folk and winning their loving will,
 and inquiring anent selling and buying, giving and taking, the dear
 and the cheap, until one day of the days when, after rising at dawn
 and donning his dress he went forth, as was his wont, to the jewelers'
 bazaar and as he passed along it he heard the crier crying as follows:
 "By command of our magnificent master, the King of the Time and the
 Lord of the Age and the Tide, let all the folk lock up their shops and
 stores and retire within their houses, for that the Lady Badr
 al-Budur, daughter of the Sultan, designeth to visit the hammam. And
 whoso gainsayeth the order shall be punished with death penalty, and
 be his blood upon his own neck!" But when Aladdin heard the
 proclamation, he longed to look upon the King's daughter and said in
 his mind, "Indeed all the lieges talk of her beauty and loveliness,
 and the end of my desires is to see her." Then Aladdin fell to
 contriving some means whereby he might look upon the Princess Badr
 al-Budur, and at last judged best to take his station behind the
 hammam door, whence he might see her face as she entered. Accordingly,
 without stay or delay he repaired to the baths before she was expected
 and stood a-rear of the entrance, a place whereat none of the folk
 happened to be looking.
 </p><p>  Now when the Sultan's daughter had gone the rounds of the city and
 its main streets and had solaced herself by sight-seeing, she
 finally reached the hammam, and whilst entering she raised her veil
 and Aladdin saw her favor, he said: "In very truth her fashion
 magnifieth her Almighty Fashioner, and glory be to Him Who created her
 and adorned her with this beauty and loveliness." His strength was
 struck down from the moment he saw her and his thoughts were
 distraught. His gaze was dazed, the love of her gat hold of the
 whole of his heart, and when he returned home to his mother, he was as
 one in ecstasy. His parent addressed him, but he neither replied nor
 denied, and, when she set before him the morning meal he continued
 in like case, so quoth she: "O my son, what is't may have befallen
 thee? Say me, doth aught ail thee? Let me know what ill hath betided
 thee, for, unlike thy custom, thou speakest not when I bespeak
 thee." Thereupon Aladdin (who used to think that all women resembled
 his mother and who, albeit he had heard of the charms of Badr
 al-Budur, daughter of the Sultan, yet knew not what "beauty" and
 "loveliness" might signify) turned to his parent and exclaimed, "Let
 me be!" However, she persisted in praying him to come forward and eat,
 so he did her bidding, but hardly touched food. After which he lay
 at full length on his bed all the night through in cogitation deep
 until morning morrowed.
 </p><p>  The same was his condition during the next day, when his mother
 was perplexed for the case of her son and unable to learn what had
 happened to him. So, thinking that belike he might be ailing, she drew
 near him and asked him, saying: "O my son, an thou sense aught of pain
 or suchlike, let me know, that I may fare forth and fetch thee the
 physician. And today there be in this our city a leech from the land
 of the Arabs whom the Sultan hath sent to summon, and the bruit abroad
 reporteth him to be skillful exceedingly. So, an be thou ill, let me
 go and bring him to thee." Aladdin, hearing his parent's offer to
 summon the mediciner, said: "O my mother, I am well in body and on
 no wise ill. But I ever thought that all women resembled thee until
 yesterday, when I beheld the Lady Badr al-Budur, daughter of the
 Sultan, as she was faring for the baths."
 </p><p>  Then he related to her all and everything that had happened to
 him, adding: "Haply thou also hast heard the crier a-crying: 'Let no
 man open shop or stand in street that the Lady Badr al-Budur may
 repair to the hammam without eye seeing her.' But I have looked upon
 her even as she is, for she raised her veil at the door, and when I
 viewed her favor and beheld that noble work of the Creator, a sore fit
 of ecstasy, O my mother, fell upon me for love of her, and firm
 resolve to win her hath opened its way into every limb of me, nor is
 repose possible for me except I win her. Wherefor I purpose asking her
 to wife from the Sultan, her sire, in lawful wedlock." When
 Aladdin's mother heard her son's words, she belittled his wits and
 cried: "O my child, the name of Allah upon thee! Meseemeth thou hast
 lost thy senses. But be thou rightly guided, O my son, nor be thou
 as the men Jinn-maddened!" He replied: "Nay, O mother of mine, I am
 not out of my mind, nor am I of the maniacs, nor shall this thy saying
 alter one jot of what is in my thoughts. For rest is impossible to
 me until I shall have won the dearling of my heart's core, the
 beautiful Lady Badr al-Budur. And now I am resolved to ask her of
 her sire the Sultan."
 </p><p>  She rejoined: "O my son, by my life upon thee, speak not such
 speech, lest any overhear thee and say thou be insane. So cast away
 from thee such nonsense! Who shall undertake a matter like this, or
 make such request to the King? Indeed, I know not how, supposing thy
 speech to be soothfast, thou shalt manage to crave such grace of the
 Sultan, or through whom thou desirest to propose it." He retorted:
 "Through whom shall I ask it, O my mother, when thou art present?
 And who is there fonder and more faithful to me than thyself? So my
 design is that thou thyself shalt proffer this my petition." Quoth
 she: "O my son, Allah remove me far therefrom! What! Have I lost my
 wits, like thyself? Cast the thought away, and a long way, from thy
 heart. Remember whose son thou art, O my child, the orphan boy of a
 tailor, the poorest and meanest of the tailors toiling in this city;
 and I, thy mother, am also come of pauper folk and indigent. How
 then durst thou ask to wife the daughter of the Sultan, whose sire
 would not deign marry her with the sons of the kings and the
 sovereigns, except they were his peers in honor and grandeur and
 majesty, and were they but one degree lower, he would refuse his
 daughter to them." Aladdin took patience until his parent had said her
 say, when quoth he: "O my mother, everything thou hast called to
 mind is known to me. Moreover, 'tis thoroughly well known to me that I
 am the child of pauper parents, withal do not these words of thee
 divert me from my design at all, at all. Nor the less do I hope of
 thee, an I be thy son and thou truly love me, that thou grant me
 this favor. Otherwise thou wilt destroy me, and present death hovereth
 over my head except I win my will of heart's dearling. And I, O my
 mother, am in every case thy child."
 </p><p>  Hearing these words, his parent wept of her sorrow for him and said:
 "O my child! Yes, in very deed I am thy mother, nor have I any son
 or life's blood of my liver except thyself, and the end of my wishes
 is to give thee a wife and rejoice in thee. But suppose that I would
 seek a bride of our likes and equals, her people will at once ask an
 thou have any land or garden, merchandise or handicraft, wherewith
 thou canst support her, and what is the reply I can return? Then, if I
 cannot possibly answer the poor like ourselves, how shall I be bold
 enough, O my son, to ask for the daughter of the Sultan of China land,
 who hath no peer or behind or before him? Therefore do thou weigh this
 matter in thy mind. Also who shall ask her to wife for the son of a
 snip? Well indeed I wot that my saying aught of this kind will but
 increase our misfortunes, for that it may be the cause of our
 incurring mortal danger from the Sultan- peradventure even death for
 thee and me.
 </p><p>  "And, as concerneth myself, how shall I venture upon such rash
 deed and perilous, O my son? And in what way shall I ask the Sultan
 for his daughter to be thy wife, and indeed how ever shall I even
 get access to him? And should I succeed therein, what is to be my
 answer an they ask me touching thy means? Haply the King will hold
 me to be a madwoman. And lastly, suppose that I obtain audience of the
 Sultan, what offering is there I can submit to the King's majesty?
 'Tis true, O my child, that the Sultan is mild and merciful, never
 rejecting any who approach him to require justice or ruth or
 protection, nor any who pray him for a present, for he is liberal
 and lavisheth favor upon near and far. But he dealeth his boons to
 those deserving them, to men who have done some derring-do in battle
 under his eyes or have rendered as civilians great service to his
 estate. But thou! Do thou tell me what feat thou hast performed in his
 presence or before the public that thou meritest from him such
 grace? And secondly, this boon thou ambitionest is not for one of
 our condition, nor is it possible that the King grant to thee the
 bourne of thine aspiration. For whoso goeth to the Sultan and
 craveth of him a favor, him it besitteth to take in hand somewhat that
 suiteth the royal majesty, as indeed I warned thee aforetime. How,
 then, shalt thou risk thyself to stand before the Sultan and ask his
 daughter in marriage when thou hast with thee naught to offer him of
 that which beseemeth his exalted station?"
 </p><p>  Hereto Aladdin replied: "O my mother, thou speakest to the point and
 hast reminded me aright, and 'tis meet that I revolve in mind the
 whole of thy remindings. But, O my mother, the love of Princess Badr
 al-Budur hath entered into the core of my heart, nor can I rest
 without I win her. However, thou hast also recalled to me a matter
 which I forgot, and 'tis this emboldeneth me to ask his daughter of
 the King. Albeit thou, O my mother, declarest that I have no gift
 which I can submit to the Sultan, as is the wont of the world, yet
 in very sooth I have an offering and a present whose equal, O my
 mother, I hold none of the kings to possess- no, even aught like it.
 Because verily that which I deemed glass or crystal was nothing but
 precious stones, and I hold that all the kings of the world have never
 possessed anything like one of the smallest thereof. For by
 frequenting the jeweler folk I have learned that they are the
 costliest gems, and these are what I brought in my pockets from the
 hoard, whereupon, an thou please, compose thy mind.
 </p><p>  "We have in our house a bowl of China porcelain, so arise thou and
 fetch it, that I may fill it with these jewels, which thou shalt carry
 as a gift to the King, and thou shalt stand in his presence and
 solicit him for my requirement. I am certified that by such means
 the matter will become easy to thee, and if thou be unwilling, O my
 mother, to strive for the winning of my wish as regards the Lady
 Badr al-Budur, know thou that surely I shall die. Nor do thou
 imagine that this gift is of aught save the costliest of stones, and
 be assured, O my mother, that in my many visits to the jewelers'
 bazaar I have observed the merchants selling for sums man's judgment
 may not determine jewels whose beauty is not worth one quarter-carat
 of what we possess, seeing which I was certified that ours are
 beyond all price. So arise, O my mother, as I bade thee, and bring
 me the porcelain bowl aforesaid, that I may arrange therein some of
 these gems, and we will see what semblance they show."
 </p><p>  So she brought him the china bowl, saying in herself, "I shall
 know what to do when I find out if the words of my child concerning
 these jewels be soothfast or not." And she set it before her son,
 who pulled the stones out of his pockets and disposed them in the
 bowl, and ceased not arranging therein gems of sorts till such time as
 he had filled it. And when it was brimful, she could not fix her
 eyes firmly upon it; on the contrary, she winked and blinked for the
 dazzle of the stones and their radiance and excess of lightninglike
 glance, and her wits were bewildered thereat. Only she was not
 certified of their value being really of the enormous extent she had
 been told. Withal she reflected that possibly her son might have
 spoken aright when he declared that their like was not to be found
 with the kings. Then Aladdin turned to her and said: "Thou
 hast-seen, O my mother, that this present intended for the Sultan is
 magnificent, and I am certified that it will procure for thee high
 honor with him, and that he will receive thee with all respect. And
 now, O my mother, thou hast no excuse, so compose thy thoughts and
 arise. Take thou this bowl, and away with it to the palace."
 </p><p>  His mother rejoined: "O my son, 'tis true that the present is
 highpriced exceedingly and the costliest of the costly, also that
 according to thy word none owneth its like. But who would have the
 boldness to go and ask the Sultan for his daughter, the Lady Badr
 al-Budur? I indeed dare not say to him, 'I want thy daughter!' when he
 shall ask me, 'What is thy want?' For know thou, O my son, that my
 tongue will be tied. And granting that Allah assist me and I
 embolden myself to say to him, 'My wish is to become a connection of
 thine through the marriage of thy daughter the Lady Badr al-Budur,
 to my son Aladdin,' they will surely decide at once that I am demented
 and will thrust me forth in disgrace and despised. I will not tell
 thee that I shall thereby fall into danger of death, for 'twill not be
 I only, but thou likewise. However, O my son, of my regard for thine
 inclination I needs must embolden myself and hie thither. Yet, O my.
 child, if the King receive me and honor me on account of the gift
 and inquire of me what thou desirest, and in reply I ask of him that
 which thou desirest in the matter of thy marriage with his daughter,
 how shall I answer him and he ask me, as is man's wont, 'What
 estates hast thou, and what income?' And perchance, O my son, he
 will question me of this before questioning me of thee."
 </p><p>  Aladdin replied: "'Tis not possible that the Sultan should make such
 demand what time he considereth the jewels and their magnificence, nor
 is it meet to think of such things as these, which may never occur.
 Now do thou but arise and set before him this present of precious
 stones and ask of him his daughter for me, and sit not yonder making
 much of the difficulty in thy fancy. Ere this thou hast learned, O
 mother mine, that the lamp which we possess hath become to us a stable
 income, and that whatso I want of it the same is supplied to me. And
 my hope is that by means thereof I shall learn how to answer the
 Sultan should he ask me of that thou sayest." Then Aladdin and his
 mother fell to talking over the subject all that night long, and
 when morning morrowed, the dame arose and heartened her heart,
 especially as her son had expounded to her some little of the powers
 of the lamp and the virtues thereof; to wit, that it would supply
 all they required of it. Aladdin, however, seeing his parent take
 courage when he explained to her the workings of the lamp, feared lest
 she might tattle to the folk thereof, so he said to her: "O my mother,
 beware how thou talk to any of the properties of the lamp and its
 profit, as this is our one great good. Guard thy thoughts lest thou
 speak overmuch concerning it before others, whoso they be. Haply we
 shall lose it and lose the boon fortune we possess and the benefits we
 expect, for that 'tis of him." His mother replied, "Fear not therefor,
 O my son," and she arose and took the bowl full of jewels, which she
 wrapped up in a fine kerchief, and went forth betimes that she might
 reach the Divan ere it became crowded.
 </p><p>  When she passed into the palace, the levee not being fully attended,
 she saw the wazirs and sundry of the lords of the land going into
 the presence room, and after a short time, when the Divan was made
 complete by the Ministers and high officials and chieftains and
 emirs and grandees, the Sultan appeared, and the wazirs made their
 obeisance and likewise did the nobles and the notables. The King
 seated himself upon the throne of his kingship, and all present at the
 levee stood before him with crossed arms awaiting his commandment to
 sit, and when they received it, each took his place according to his
 degree. Then the claimants came before the Sultan, who delivered
 sentence, after his wonted way, until the Divan was ended, when the
 King arose and withdrew into the palace and the others all went
 their ways. And when Aladdin's mother saw the throne empty and the
 King passing into his harem, she also wended her ways and returned
 home. But as soon as her son espied her, bowl in hand, he thought that
 haply something untoward had befallen her, but he would not ask of
 aught until such time as she had set down the bowl, when she
 acquainted him with that had occurred and ended by adding:
 "Alhamdolillah- laud to the Lord!- O my child, that I found courage
 enough and secured for myself standing place in the levee this day.
 And, albe' I dreaded to bespeak the King yet (Inshallah!) on the
 morrow I will address him. Even today were many who, like myself,
 could not get audience of the Sultan. But be of good cheer, O my
 son, and tomorrow needs must I bespeak him for thy sake, and what
 happened not may happen." When Aladdin heard his parent's words, he
 joyed with excessive joy, and, although he expected the matter to be
 managed hour by hour, for excess of his love and longing to the Lady
 Badr al-Budur, yet he possessed his soul in patience.
 </p><p>  They slept well that night, and betimes next morning the mother of
 Aladdin arose and went with her bowl to the King's Court, which she
 found closed. So she asked the people and they told her that the
 Sultan did not hold a levee every day, but only thrice in the
 sennight, wherefor she determined to return home. And after this,
 whenever she saw the Court open she would stand before the King
 until the reception ended, and when it was shut she would go to make
 sure thereof, and this was the case for the whole month. The Sultan
 was wont to remark her presence at every levee, but on the last day
 when she took her station, as was her wont, before the Council, she
 allowed it to close, and lacked boldness to come forward and speak
 even a syllable. Now as the King, having risen, was making for his
 harem accompanied by the Grand Wazir, he turned to him and said: "O
 Wazir, during the last six or seven levee days I see yonder old
 woman present herself at every reception, and I also note that she
 always carrieth a something under her mantilla. Say me, hast thou, O
 Wazir, any knowledge of her and her intention?" "O my lord the
 Sultan," said the other, "verily women be weakly of wits, and haply
 this goodwife cometh hither to complain before thee against her
 goodman or some of her people." But this reply was far from satisfying
 the Sultan- nay, he bade the Wazir, in case she should come again,
 set her before him, and forthright the Minister placed hand on head
 and exclaimed, "To hear is to obey, O our lord the Sultan!"
 </p><p>  Now one day of the days, when she did according to her custom, the
 Sultan cast his eyes upon her as she stood before him and said to
 his Grand Wazir: "This be the very woman whereof I spake to thee
 yesterday, so do thou straightway bring her before me, that I may
 see what be her suit and fulfill her need." Accordingly the Minister
 at once introduced her, and when in the presence she saluted the
 King by kissing her finger tips and raising them to her brow, and,
 praying for the Sultan's glory and continuance and the permanence of
 his prosperity, bussed ground before him. Thereupon quoth he: "O
 woman, for sundry days I have seen thee attend the levee sans a word
 said, so tell me an thou have any requirement I may grant." She kissed
 ground a second time and after blessing him, answered: "Yea, verily,
 as thy head liveth, O King of the Age, I have a want. But first of all
 do thou deign grant me a promise of safety, that I may prefer my
 suit to the ears of our lord the Sultan, for haply thy Highness may
 find it a singular." The King, wishing to know her need, and being a
 man of unusual mildness and clemency, gave his word for her immunity
 and bade forthwith dismiss all about him, remaining without other
 but the Grand Wazir. Then he turned toward his suppliant and said:
 "Inform me of thy suit. Thou hast the safeguard of Allah Almighty." "O
 King of the Age," replied she, "I also require of thee pardon," and
 quoth he, "Allah pardon thee even as I do."
 </p><p>  Then quoth she: "O our lord the Sultan, I have a son, Aladdin hight,
 and he, one day of the days, having heard the crier commanding all men
 to shut shop and shun the streets for that the Lady Badr al-Budur,
 daughter of the Sultan, was going to the hammam, felt an
 uncontrollable longing to look upon her, and hid himself in a stead
 whence he could sight her right well, and that place was behind the
 door of the baths. When she entered, he beheld her and considered
 her as he wished, and but too well, for since the time he looked
 upon her, O King of the Age, unto this hour, life hath not been
 pleasant to him. And he hath required of me that I ask her to wife for
 him from thy Highness, nor could I drive this fancy from his mind,
 because love of her hath mastered his vitals and to such degree that
 he said to me, 'Know thou, O mother mine, that an I win not my wish
 surely I shall die.' Accordingly I hope that thy Highness will deign
 be mild and merciful and pardon this boldness on the part of me and my
 child and refrain to punish us therefor."
 </p><p>  When the Sultan heard her tale, he regarded her with kindness and,
 laughing aloud, asked her, "What may be that thou carriest, and what
 be in yonder kerchief?" And she, seeing the Sultan laugh in lieu of
 waxing wroth at her words, forthright opened the wrapper and set
 before him the bowl of jewels, whereby the audience hall was illumined
 as it were by lusters and candelabra. And he was dazed and amazed at
 the radiance of the rare gems, and he fell to marveling at their
 size and beauty and excellence and cried: "Never at all until this day
 saw I anything like these jewels for size and beauty and excellence,
 nor deem I that there be found in my Treasury a single one like them."
 Then he turned to his Minister and asked: "What sayest thou, O
 Wazir? Tell me, hast thou seen in thy time such mighty fine jewels
 as these?" The other answered: "Never saw I such, O our lord the
 Sultan, nor do I think that there be in the treasures of my lord the
 Sultan the fellow of the least thereof." The King resumed: "Now indeed
 whoso hath presented to me such jewels meriteth to become bridegroom
 to my daughter, Badr al-Budur, because, as far as I see, none is
 more deserving of her than he." When the Wazir heard the Sultan's
 words, he was tongue-tied with concern, and he grieved with sore
 grief, for the King had promised to give the Princess in marriage to
 his son. So after a little while he said: "O King of the Age, thy
 Highness deigned promise me that the Lady Badr al-Budur should be
 spouse to my son, so 'tis but right that thine Exalted Highness
 vouchsafe us a delay of three months, during which time, Inshallah! my
 child may obtain and present an offering yet costlier than this."
 Accordingly the King, albeit he knew that such a thing could not be
 done, or by the Wazir or by the greatest of his grandees, yet of his
 grace and kindness granted him the required delay.
 </p><p>  Then he turned to the old woman, Aladdin's mother, and said: "Go
 to thy son and tell him I have pledged my word that my daughter
 shall be in his name. Only 'tis needful that I make the requisite
 preparations of nuptial furniture for her use, and 'tis only meet that
 he take patience for the next three months." Receiving this reply,
 Aladdin's mother thanked the Sultan and blessed him, then, going forth
 in hottest haste, as one flying for joy, she went home. And when her
 son saw her entering with a smiling face, he was gladdened at the
 sip of good news, especially because she had returned without delay,
 as on the past days, and had not brought back the bowl. Presently he
 asked her saying: "Inshallah, thou bearest me, O my mother, glad
 tidings, and peradventure the jewels and their value have wrought
 their work, and belike thou hast been kindly received by the King
 and he hath shown thee grace and hath given ear to thy request?" So
 she told him the whole tale, how the Sultan had entreated her well and
 had marveled at the extraordinary size of the gems and their
 surpassing water, as did also the Wazir, adding: "And he promised that
 his daughter should be thine. Only, O my child, the Wazir spake of a
 secret contract made with him by the Sultan before he pledged
 himself to me and, after speaking privily, the King put me off to
 the end of three months. Therefore I have become fearful lest the
 Wazir be evilly disposed to thee, and perchance he may attempt to
 change the Sultan's mind."
 </p><p>  When Aladdin heard his mother's words and how the Sultan had
 promised him his daughter, deferring, however, the wedding until after
 the third month, his mind was gladdened and he rejoiced exceedingly
 and said: Inasmuch as the King hath given his word after three
 months (well, it is a long time!), at all events my gladness is mighty
 great." Then he thanked his parent, showing her how her good work
 had exceeded her toil and travail, and said to her: "By Allah, O my
 mother, hitherto I was as 'twere in my grave and therefrom thou hast
 withdrawn me. And I praise Allah Almighty because I am at this
 moment certified that no man in the world is happier than I, or more
 fortunate." Then he took patience until two of the three months had
 gone by.
 </p><p>  Now one day of the days his mother fared forth about sundown to
 the bazaar that she might buy somewhat of oil, and she found all the
 market shops fast shut and the whole city decorated, and the folk
 placing waxen tapers and flowers at their casements. And she beheld
 the soldiers and household troops and agas riding in procession, and
 flambeaux and lusters flaming and flaring, and she wondered at the
 marvelous sight and the glamour of the scene. So she went in to an
 ouman's store which stood open still and bought her need of him and
 said: "By thy life, O uncle, tell me what be the tidings in town
 this day, that people have made all these decorations and every
 house and market street are adorned and the troops all stand on
 guard?" The oilman asked her, "O woman, I suppose thou art a stranger,
 and not one of this city?" and she answered, "Nay, I am thy
 townswoman." He rejoined: "Thou a townswoman, and yet wottest not that
 this very night the son of the Grand Wazir goeth in to the Lady Badr
 al-Budur, daughter of the Sultan! He is now in the hammam, and all
 this power of soldiery is on guard and standing under arms to await
 his coming forth, when they will bear him in bridal procession to the
 palace, where the Princess expecteth him."
 </p><p>  As the mother of Aladdin heard these words, she grieved and was
 distraught in thought and perplexed how to inform her son of this
 sorrowful event, well knowing that the poor youth was looking, hour by
 hour, to the end of the three months. But she returned straightway
 home to him, and when she entered she said, "O my son, I would give
 thee certain tidings, yet hard to me will be the sorrow they shall
 occasion thee." He cried, "Let me know what be thy news," and she
 replied: "Verily the Sultan hath broken his promise to thee in the
 matter of the Lady Badr al-Budur, and this very night the Grand
 Wazir's son goeth in to her. And for some time, O my son, I have
 suspected that the Minister would change the King's mind, even as I
 told thee how he had spoken privily to him before me." Aladdin
 asked: "How learnedst thou that the Wazir's son is this night to pay
 his first visit to the Princess?" So she told him the whole tale,
 how when going to buy oil she had found the city decorated and the
 eunuch officials and lords of the land with the troops under arms
 awaiting the bridegroom from the baths, and that the first visit was
 appointed for that very night.
 </p><p>  Hearing this, Aladdin was seized with a fever of jealousy brought on
 by his grief. However, after a short while he remembered the lamp and,
 recovering his spirits, said: "By thy life, O my mother, do thou
 believe that the Wazir's son will not enjoy her as thou thinkest.
 But now leave we this discourse, and arise thou and serve up supper,
 and after eating let me retire to my own chamber and all will be
 well and happy." After he had supped Aladdin retired to his chamber
 and, locking the door, brought out the lamp and rubbed it, whenas
 forthright appeared to him its familiar, who said: "Ask whatso thou
 wantest, for I am thy slave and slave to him who holdeth the lamp in
 hand, I and all the Slaves of the Lamp." He replied: "Hear me! I
 prayed the Sultan for his daughter to wife and he plighted her to me
 after three months, but he hath not kept his word- nay, he hath given
 her to the son of the Wazir, and this very night the bridegroom will
 go in to her. Therefore I command thee (an thou be a trusty servitor
 to the lamp), when thou shalt see bride and bridegroom bedded together
 this night, at once take them up and bear them hither abed. And this
 be what I want of thee." The Marid replied, "Hearing and obeying,
 and if thou have other service but this, do thou demand of me all thou
 desirest." Aladdin rejoined, "At the present time I require naught
 save that I bade thee do."
 </p><p>  Hereupon the slave disappeared and Aladdin returned to pass the rest
 of the evening with his mother. But at the hour when he knew that
 the servitor would be coming, he arose and retired to his chamber, and
 after a little while, behold, the Marid came, bring to him the newly
 wedded couple upon their bridal bed. Aladdin rejoiced to see them with
 exceeding joy, then he cried to the slave, "Carry yonder gallowsbird
 hence and lay him at full length in the privy." His bidding was done
 straightway, but before leaving him, the slave blew upon the
 bridegroom a blast so cold that it shriveled him, and the plight of
 the Wazir's son became piteous. Then the servitor, returning to
 Aladdin, said to him, "An thou require aught else, inform me thereof,"
 and said the other, "Return a-morn, that thou mayest restore them to
 their stead," whereto, "I hear and obey," quoth the Marid, and
 evanished.
 </p><p>  Presently Aladdin arose, hardly believing that the affair had been
 such a success for him, but whenas he looked upon the Lady Badr
 al-Budur lying under his own roof, albeit he had long burned with
 her love, yet he preserved respect for her and said: "O Princess of
 fair ones, think not that I brought thee hither to minish thy honor.
 Heaven forfend! Nay, 'twas only to prevent the wrong man enjoying
 thee, for that thy sire, the Sultan, promised thee to me. So do thou
 rest in peace." When the Lady Badr al-Budur, daughter of the Sultan,
 saw herself in that mean and darksome lodging, and heard Aladdin's
 words, she was seized with fear and trembling and waxed clean
 distraught, nor could she return aught of reply. Presently the youth
 arose, and stripping off his outer dress, placed a scimitar between
 them and lay upon the bed beside the Princess. And he did no villain
 deed, for it sufficed him to prevent the consummation of her
 nuptials with the Wazir's son. On the other hand, the Lady Badr
 al-Budur passed a night the evilest of all nights, nor in her born
 days had she seen a worse. And the same was the case with the
 Minister's son, who lay in the chapel of ease and who dared not stir
 for the fear of the Jinni which overwhelmed him.
 </p><p>  As soon as it was morning the slave appeared before Aladdin
 without the lamp being rubbed, and said to him: "O my lord, an thou
 require aught, command me therefor, that I may do it upon my head
 and mine eyes." Said the other: "Go, take up and carry the bride and
 bridegroom to their own apartment." So the servitor did his bidding in
 an eye glance and bore away the pair and placed them in the palace
 as whilom they were and without their seeing anyone. But both died
 of affright when they found themselves being transported from stead to
 stead. And the Marid had barely time to set them down and wend his
 ways ere the Sultan came on a visit of congratulation to his daughter.
 And when the Wazir's son heard the doors thrown open, he sprang
 straightway from his couch and donned his dress, for he knew that none
 save the King could enter at that hour. Yet it was exceedingly hard
 for him to leave his bed, wherein he wished to warm himself a trifle
 after his cold night in the watercloset which he had lately left.
 The Sultan went in to his daughter, Badr al-Budur, and, kissing her
 between the eyes, gave her good morning and asked her of her
 bridegroom and whether she was pleased and satisfied with him. But she
 returned no reply whatever and looked at him with the eye of anger,
 and although he repeated his words again and again, she held her
 peace, nor bespake him with a single syllable.
 </p><p>  So the King quitted her and, going to the Queen, informed her of
 what had taken place, between him and his daughter, and the mother,
 unwilling to leave the Sultan angered with their child, said to him:
 "O King of the Age, this be the custom of most newly married
 couples, at least during their first days of marriage, for that they
 are bashful and somewhat coy. So deign thou excuse her, and after a
 little while she will again become herself and speak with the folk
 as before, whereas now her shame, O King of the Age, keepeth her
 silent. However, 'tis my wish to fare forth and see her." Thereupon
 the Queen arose and donned her dress, then, going to her daughter,
 wished her good morning and kissed her between the eyes. Yet would the
 Princess make no answer at all, whereat quoth the Queen to herself:
 "Doubtless some strange matter hath occurred to trouble her with
 such trouble as this." So she asked her, saying: "O my daughter,
 what hath caused this thy case? Let me know what hath betided thee
 that when I come and give thee good morniing, thou hast not a word
 to say to me." Thereat the Lady Badr al-Budur raised her head and
 said: "Pardon me, O my mother, 'twas my duty to meet thee with all
 respect and worship, seeing that thou hast honored me by this visit.
 However, I pray thee to hear the cause of this my condition and see
 how the night I have just spent hath been to me the evilest of the
 nights. Hardly had we lain down, O my mother, than one whose form I
 wot not uplifted our bed and transported it to a darksome place,
 fulsome and mean."
 </p><p>  Then the Princess related to the Queen Mother all that had
 befallen her that night- how they had taken away her bridegroom,
 leaving her lone and lonesome, and how after a while came another
 youth who lay beside her in lieu of her bridegroom, after placing
 his scimitar between her and himself. "And in the morning," she
 continued, "he who carried us off returned and bore us straight back
 to our own stead. But at once when he arrived hither he left us, and
 suddenly my sire, the Sultan, entered at the hour and moment of our
 coming and I had nor heart nor tongue to speak him withal, for the
 stress of the terror and trembling which came upon me. Haply such lack
 of duty may have proved sore to him, so I hope, O my mother, that thou
 wilt acquaint him with the cause of this my condition, and pardon me
 for not answering him and blame me not, accept my excuses."
 </p><p>  When the Queen heard these words of Princess Badr al-Budur, she said
 to her: "O my child, compose thy thoughts. An thou tell such tale
 before any, haply shall he say, 'Verily, the Sultan's daughter hath
 lost her wits.' And thou hast done right well in not choosing to
 recount thine adventure to thy father, and beware, and again I say
 beware, O my daughter, lest thou inform him thereof." The Princess
 replied: "O my mother, I have spoken to thee like one sound in senses,
 nor have I lost my wits. This be what befell me, and if thou believe
 it not because coming from me, ask my bridegroom." To which the
 Queen replied: "Rise up straightway, O my daughter, and banish from
 thy thoughts such fancies as these. And robe thyself and come forth to
 glance at the bridal feasts and festivities they are making in the
 city for the sake of thee and thy nuptials, and listen to the drumming
 and the singing and look at the decorations all intended to honor
 thy marriage, O my daughter."
 </p><p>  So saying, the Queen at once summoned the tirewoman, who dressed and
 prepared the Lady Badr al-Budur, and presently she went in to the
 Sultan and assured him that their daughter had suffered during all her
 wedding night from swevens and nightmare, and said to him, "Be not
 severe with her for not answering thee." Then the Queen sent privily
 for the Wazir's son and asked of the matter, saying, "Tell me, are
 these words of the Lady Badr al-Budur soothfast or not?" But he, in
 his fear of losing his bride out of hand, answered, "O my lady, I have
 no knowledge of that whereof thou speakest." Accordingly the mother
 made sure that her daughter had seen visions and dreams. The
 marriage feasts lasted throughout that day with almes and singers
 and the smiting of all manner instruments of mirth and merriment,
 while the Queen and the Wazir and his son strave right strenuously
 to enhance the festivities that the Princess might enjoy herself.
 And that day they left nothing of what exciteth to pleasure
 unrepresented in her presence, to the end that she might forget what
 was in her thoughts and derive increase of joyance.
 </p><p>  Yet did naught of this take any effect upon her- nay, she sat in
 silence, sad of thought, sore perplexed at what had befallen her
 during the last night. It is true that the Wazir's son had suffered
 even more he had passed his sleeping hours lying in the watercloset.
 He, however had falsed the story and had cast out remembrance of the
 night, in the first place for his fear of losing his bride and with
 her the honor of a connection which brought him such excess of
 consideration and for which men envied him so much, and secondly, on
 account of the wondrous loveliness of the Lady Badr al-Budur and her
 marvelous beauty.
 </p><p>  Aladdin also went forth that day and looked at the merrymakings,
 which extended throughout the city as well as the palace, and he
 fell a-laughing, especially when he heard the folk prating of the high
 honor which had accrued to the son of the Wazir and the prosperity
 of his fortunes in having become son-in-law to the Sultan, and the
 high consideration shown by the wedding fetes. And he said in his
 mind: "Indeed ye wot not, O ye miserables, what befell him last night,
 that ye envy him!" But after darkness fell and it was time for
 sleep, Aladdin arose and, retiring to his chamber, rubbed the lamp,
 whereupon the slave incontinently appeared and was bidden to bring him
 the Sultan's daughter, together with her bridegroom, as on the past
 night, ere the Wazir's son could abate her maidenhead. So the Marid
 without stay or delay evanished for a little while until the appointed
 time, when he returned carrying the bed whereon lay the Lady Badr
 al-Budur and the Wazir's son. And he did with the bridegroom as he had
 done before; to wit, he took him and laid him at full length in the
 jakes and there left him dried-up for excess of fear and trembling.
 Then Aladdin arose and, placing the scimitar between himself and the
 Princess, lay down beside her, and when day broke the slave restored
 the pair to their own place, leaving Aladdin filled with delight at
 the state of the Minister's son.
 </p><p>  Now when the Sultan woke up a-morn, he resolved to visit his
 daughter and see if she would treat him as on the past day. So,
 shaking off his sleep, he sprang up and arrayed himself in his
 raiment, and going to the apartment of the Princess, bade open the
 door. Thereat the son of the Wazir arose forthright and came down from
 his bed and began donning his dress whilst his ribs were wrung with
 cold. For when the King entered the slave had but just brought him
 back. The Sultan, raising the arras, drew near his daughter as she lay
 abed and gave her good morning. Then, kissing her between the eyes, he
 asked her of her case. But he saw her looking sour and sad, and she
 answered him not at all only glowering at him as one in anger, and her
 plight was pitiable. Hereat the Sultan waxed wroth with her for that
 she would not reply, and he suspected that something evil had befallen
 her, whereupon he bared his blade and cried to her, brand in hand,
 saying: "What be this hath betided thee? Either acquaint me with
 what happened or this very moment I will take thy life! Is such
 conduct the token of honor and respect I expect of thee, that I
 address thee and thou answerest me not a word?"
 </p><p>  When the Lady Badr al-Budur saw her sire in high dudgeon and the
 naked glaive in his grip, she was freed from her fear of the past,
 so she raised her head and said to him: "O my beloved father, be not
 wroth with me, nor be hasty in thy hot passion, for I am excusable
 in what thou shalt see of my case. So do thou lend an ear to what
 occurred to me, and well I wot that after hearing my account of what
 befell to me during these two last nights, thou wilt pardon me, and
 thy Highness will be softened to pitying me even as I claim of thee
 affection for thy child." Then the Princess informed her father of all
 that had betided her, adding: "O my sire, an thou believe me not,
 ask my bridegroom and he will recount to thy Highness the whole
 adventure. Nor did I know either what they would do with him when they
 bore him away from my side or where they would place him." When the
 Sultan heard his daughter's words, he was saddened and his eyes
 brimmed with tears, then he sheathed his saber and kissed her, saying:
 "O my daughter, wherefore didst thou not tell me what happened on
 the past night, that I might have guarded thee from this torture and
 terror which visited thee a second time? But now 'tis no matter.
 Rise and cast out all such care, and tonight I will set a watch to
 ward thee, nor shall any mishap again make thee miserable."
 </p><p>  Then the Sultan returned to his palace and straightway bade summon
 the Grand Wazir and asked him as he stood before him in his service:
 "O Wazir, how dost thou look upon this matter? Haply thy son hath
 informed thee of what occurred to him and to my daughter." The
 Minister replied, "O King of the Age, I have not seen my son or
 yesterday or today." Hereat the Sultan told him all that had afflicted
 the Princess, adding: "'Tis my desire that thou at once seek tidings
 of thy son concerning the facts of the case. Peradventure of her
 fear my daughter may not be fully aware of what really befell her,
 withal I hold all her words to be truthful." So the Grand Wazir arose,
 and going forth, bade summon his son and asked him anent all his
 lord had told him whether it be true or untrue. The youth replied:
 "O my father the Wazir, Heaven forbid that the Lady Badr al-Budur
 speak falsely. Indeed all she said was sooth, and these two nights
 proved to us the evilest of our nights instead of being nights of
 pleasure and marriage joys. But what befell me was the greater evil,
 because instead of sleeping abed with my bride, I lay in the wardrobe,
 a black hole, frightful, noisome of stench, truly damnable, and my
 ribs were bursten with cold." In fine, the young man told his father
 the whole tale, adding as he ended it: "O dear father mine, I
 implore thee to speak with the Sultan that he may set me free from
 this marriage. Yes, indeed 'tis a high honor for me to be the Sultan's
 son-in-law, and especially the love of the Princess hath gotten hold
 of my vitals, but I have no strength left to endure a single night
 like unto these two last."
 </p><p>  The Wazir, hearing the words of his son, was saddened and
 sorrowful exceedingly, for it was his desire to advance and promote
 his child by making him son-in-law to the Sultan. So he became
 thoughtful and perplexed about the affair and the device whereby to
 manage it, and it was sore grievous for him to break off the marriage,
 it having been a rare enjoyment to him that he had fallen upon such
 high good fortune. Accordingly he said: "Take patience, O my son,
 until we see what may happen this night, when we will set watchmen
 to ward you. Nor do thou give up the exalted distinction which hath
 fallen to none save to thyself." Then the Wazir left him and,
 returning to the sovereign, reported that all told to him by the
 Lady Badr al-Budur was a true tale. Whereupon quoth the Sultan, "Since
 the affair is on this wise, we require no delay," and he at once
 ordered all the rejoicings to cease and the marriage to be broken off.
 This caused the folk and the citizens to marvel at the matter,
 especially when they saw the Grand Wazir and his son leaving the
 palace in pitiable plight for grief and stress of passion, and the
 people fell to asking, "What hath happened, and what is the cause of
 the wedding being made null and void?"
 </p><p>  Nor did any know aught of the truth save Aladdin, the lover who
 claimed the Princess's hand, and he laughed in his sleeve. But even
 after the marriage was dissolved, the Sultan forgot nor even
 recalled to mind his promise made to Aladdin's mother, and the same
 was the case with the Grand Wazir, while neither had any inkling of
 whence befell them that which had befallen. So Aladdin patiently
 awaited the lapse of the three months after which the Sultan had
 pledged himself to give him to wife his daughter. But soon as ever the
 term came, he sent his mother to the Sultan for the purpose of
 requiring him to keep his covenant. So she went to the palace, and
 when the King appeared in the Divan and saw the old woman standing
 before him, he remembered his promise to her concerning the marriage
 after a term of three months, and he turned to the Minister and
 said: "O Wazir, this be the ancient dame who presented me with the
 jewels and to whom we pledged our word that when the three months
 had elapsed we would summon her to our presence before all others." So
 the Minister went forth and fetched her, and when she went in to the
 Sultan's presence she saluted him and prayed for his glory and
 permanence of prosperity. Hereat the King asked her if she needed
 aught, and she answered: "O King of the Age, the three months' term
 thou assignedst to me is finished, and this is thy time to my son
 Aladdin with thy daughter, the Lady Badr al-Budur."
 </p><p>  The Sultan was distraught at this demand, especially when he saw the
 old woman's pauper condition, one of the meanest of her kind, and
 yet the offering she had brought to him was of the most magnificent,
 far beyond his power to pay the price. Accordingly he turned to the
 Grand Wazir and said: "What device is there with thee? In very sooth I
 did pass my word, yet meseemeth that they be pauper folk, and not
 persons of high condition." The Grand Wazir, who was dying of envy and
 who was especially saddened by what had befallen his son, said to
 himself, "How shall one like this wed the King's daughter and my son
 lose this highmost honor?" Accordingly he answered his sovereign,
 speaking privily: "O my lord, 'tis an easy matter to keep off a poor
 devil such as this, for he is not worthy that thy Highness give his
 daughter to a fellow whom none knoweth what he may be." "By what
 means," inquired the Sultan, "shall we put off the man when I
 pledged my promise, and the word of the kings is their bond?"
 Replied the Wazir: "O my lord, my rede is that thou demand of him
 forty platters made of pure sand gold and full of gems (such as the
 woman brought thee aforetime), with forty white slave girls to carry
 the platters and forty black eunuch slaves." The King rejoined: "By
 Allah, O Wazir, thou hast spoken to the purpose, seeing that such
 thing is not possible, and by this way we shall be freed."
 </p><p>  Then quoth he to Aladdin's mother: "Do thou go and tell thy son that
 I am a man of my word even as I plighted it to him, but on condition
 that he have power to pay the dower of my daughter. And that which I
 require of him is a settlement consisting of twoscore platters of
 virgin gold, all brimming with gems the like of those thou
 broughtest to me, and as many white handmaids to carry them and
 twoscore black eunuch slaves to serve and escort the bearers. An thy
 son avail hereto, I will marry him with my daughter." Thereupon she
 returned home wagging her head and saying in her mind: "Whence can
 my poor boy procure these platters and such jewels? And granted that
 he return to the enchanted treasury and pluck them from the
 trees- which, however, I hold impossible- yet given that he bring
 them, whence shall he come by the girls and the blacks?" Nor did she
 leave communing with herself till she reached her home, where she
 found Aladdin awaiting her, and she lost no time in saying: "O my son,
 did I not tell thee never to fancy that thy power would extend to
 the Lady Badr al-Budur, and that such a matter is not possible to folk
 like ourselves?"
 </p><p>  "Recount to me the news," quoth he, so quoth she: "O my child,
 verily the Sultan received me with all honor according to his
 custom, and meseemeth his intentions toward us be friendly. But
 thine enemy is that accursed Wazir, for after I addressed the King
 in thy name as thou badest me say, 'In very sooth the promised term is
 past,' adding, "Twere well an thy Highness would deign issue
 commandment for the espousals of thy daughter the Lady Badr al-Budur
 to my son Aladdin,' he turned to and addressed the Minister, who
 answered privily, after which the Sultan gave me his reply." Then
 she enumerated the King's demand and said: "O my son, he indeed
 expecteth of thee an instant reply, but I fancy that we have no answer
 for him." When Aladdin heard these words, he laughed and said: "O my
 mother, thou affirmest that we have no answer and thou deemest the
 case difficult exceedingly, but compose thy thoughts and arise and
 bring me somewhat we may eat. And after we have dined, an the
 Compassionate be willing, thou shalt see my reply. Also the Sultan
 thinketh like thyself that he hath demanded a prodigious dower in
 order to divert me from his daughter, whereas the fact is that he hath
 required of me a matter far less than I expected. But do thou fare
 forth at once and purchase the provision and leave me to procure
 thee a reply."
 </p><p>  So she went out to fetch her needful from the bazaar and Aladdin
 retired to his chamber and, taking the lamp, rubbed it, when
 forthright appeared to him its slave and said, "Ask, O my lord, whatso
 thou wantest." The other replied: "I have demanded of the Sultan his
 daughter to wife, and he hath required of me forty bowls of purest
 gold each weighing ten pounds and all to be filled with gems such as
 we find in the gardens of the hoard; furthermore, that they be borne
 on the heads of as many white handmaids, each attended by her black
 eunuch slave, also forty in full rate. So I desire that thou bring all
 these into my presence." "Hearkening and obeying, O my lord," quoth
 the slave and, disappearing for the space of an hour or so,
 presently returned bringing the platters and jewels, handmaids and
 eunuchs. Then, setting them before him, the Marid cried: "This be what
 thou demandest of me. Declare now an thou want any matter or service
 other than this." Aladdin rejoined: "I have need of naught else, but
 an I do, I will summon thee and let thee know."
 </p><p>  The slave now disappeared, and after a little while, Aladdin's
 mother returned home, and on entering the house, saw the blacks and
 the handmaids. Hereat she wondered and exclaimed, "All this proceedeth
 from the lamp which Allah perpetuate to my son!" But ere she doffed
 her mantilla Aladdin said to her: "O my mother, this be thy time.
 Before the Sultan enter his seraglio palace do thou carry to him
 what he required, and wend thou with it at once, so may he know that I
 avail to supply all he wanteth and yet more. Also that he is
 beguiled by his Grand wazir, and the twain imagined vainly that they
 would baffle me." Then he arose forthright and opened the house
 door, when the handmaids and blackamoors paced forth in pairs, each
 girl with her eunuch besider her, until they crowded the quarter,
 Aladdin's mother foregoing them. And when the folk of that ward
 sighted such mighty fine sight and marvelous spectacle, all stood at
 gaze and they considered the forms and figures of the handmaids,
 marveling at their beauty and loveliness, for each and every wore
 robes inwrought with gold and studded with jewels, no dress being
 worth less than a thousand dinars. They stared as intently at the
 bowls, and albeit these were covered with pieces of brocade, also
 orfrayed and dubbed with precious stones, yet the sheen outshot from
 them dulled the shine of sun.
 </p><p>  Then Aladdin's mother walked forward and all the handmaids and
 eunuchs paced behind her in the best of ordinance and disposition, and
 the citizens gathered to gaze at the beauty of the damsels, glorifying
 God the Most Great, until the train reached the palace and entered
 it accompanied by the tailor's widow. Now when the agas and
 chamberlains and army officers beheld them, all were seized with
 surprise, notably by seeing the handmaids, who each and every would
 ravish the reason of an anchorite. And albeit the royal chamberlains
 and officials were men of family, the sons of grandees and emirs,
 yet they could not but especially wonder at the costly dresses of
 the girls and the platters borne upon their heads, nor could they gaze
 at them open-eyed by reason of the exceeding brilliance and
 radiance. Then the nabobs went in and reported to the King, who
 forthright bade admit them to the presence chamber, and Aladdin's
 mother went in with them.
 </p><p>  When they stood before the Sultan, all saluted him with every sign
 of respect and worship and prayed for his glory and prosperity. Then
 they set down from their heads the bowls at his feet and, having
 removed the brocade covers, rested with arms crossed behind them.
 The Sultan wondered with exceeding wonder, and was distraught by the
 beauty of the handmaids and their loveliness, which passed praise. And
 his wits were wildered when he considered the golden bowls brimful
 of gems which captured man's vision, and he was perplexed at the
 marvel until he became like the dumb, unable to utter a syllable for
 the excess of his wonder. Also his sense was stupefied the more when
 he bethought him that within an hour or so all these treasures had
 been collected. Presently he commanded the slave girls to enter,
 with what loads they bore, the dower of the Princess, and when they
 had done his bidding, Aladdin's mother came forward and said to the
 Sultan: "O my lord, this be not much wherewith to honor the Lady
 Badr al-Budur, for that she meriteth these things multiplied times
 manifold."
 </p><p>  Hereat the sovereign turned to the Minister and asked: "What
 sayest thou, O Wazir? Is not he who could produce such wealth in a
 time so brief, is he not, I say, worthy to become the Sultan's
 son-in-law and take the King's daughter to wife?" Then the Minister
 (although he marveled at these riches even more than did the
 Sultan), whose envy was killing him and growing greater hour by
 hour, seeing his liege lord satisfied with the moneys and the dower
 and yet being unable to fight against fact, made answer, "'Tis not
 worthy of her." Withal he fell to devising a device against the
 King, that he might withhold the Lady Badr al-Budur from Aladdin,
 and accordingly he continued: "O my liege, the treasures of the
 universe all of them are not worth a nail paring of thy daughter.
 Indeed thy Highness hath prized these things overmuch in comparison
 with her."
 </p><p>  When the King heard the words of his Grand Wazir, he knew that the
 speech was prompted by excess of envy, so, turning to the mother of
 Aladdin, he said: "O woman, go to thy son and tell him that I have
 accepted of him the dower and stand to my bargain, and that my
 daughter be his bride and he my son-in-law. Furthermore, bid him at
 once make act of presence that I may become familiar with him. He
 shall see naught from me save all honor and consideration, and this
 night shall be the beginning of the marriage festivities. Only, as I
 said to thee, let him come to me and tarry not." Thereupon Aladdin's
 mother returned home with the speed of the storm winds that she
 might hasten her utmost to congratulate her son, and she flew with joy
 at the thought that her boy was about to become son-in-law to the
 Sultan.
 </p><p>  After her departure the King dismissed the Divan and, entering the
 palace of the Princess, bade them bring the bowls and the handmaids
 before him and before her, that she also might inspect them. But
 when the Lady Badr al-Budur considered the jewels, she waxed
 distraught and cried: "Meseemeth that in the treasuries of the world
 there be not found one jewel rivaling these jewels." Then she looked
 at the handmaids and marveled at their beauty and loveliness, and knew
 that all this came from her new bridegroom, who had sent them in her
 service. So she was gladdened, albeit she had been grieved and
 saddened on account of her former husband, the Wazir's son, and she
 rejoiced with exceeding joy when she gazed upon the damsels and
 their charms. Nor was her sire, the Sultan, less pleased and
 inspirited when he saw his daughter relieved of an her mourning and
 melancholy, and his own vanished at the sight of her enjoyment. Then
 he asked her: "O my daughter, do these things divert thee? Indeed I
 deem that this suitor of thine be more suitable to thee than the son
 of the Wazir, and right soon, Inshallah! O my daughter, thou shalt
 have fuller joy with him."
 </p><p>  Such was the case with the King, but as regards Aladdin, as soon
 as he saw his mother entering the house with face laughing for
 stress of joy he rejoiced at the sign of glad tidings and cried: "To
 Allah alone be lauds! Perfected is an I desired." Rejoined his mother:
 "Be gladdened at my good news, O my son, and hearten thy heart and
 cool thine eyes for the winning of thy wish. The Sultan hath
 accepted thine offering- I mean the moneys and the dower of the Lady
 Badr al-Budur, who is now thine affianced bride. And this very
 night, O my child, is your marriage and thy first visit to her, for
 the King, that he might assure me of his word, hath proclaimed to
 the world thou art his son-in-law, and promised this night to be the
 night of going in. But he also said to me, 'Let thy son come hither
 forthright that I may become familiar with him and receive him with
 all honor and worship.' And now here am I, O my son, at the end of
 my labors. Happen whatso may happen, the rest is upon thy shoulders."
 </p><p>  Thereupon Aladdin arose and kissed his mother's hand and thanked
 her, enhancing her kindly service. Then he left her and, entering
 his chamber, took the lamp and rubbed it, when, lo and behold! its
 slave appeared and cried: "Adsum! Ask whatso thou wantest." The
 young man replied: "'Tis my desire that thou take me to a hammam whose
 like is not in the world. Then fetch me a dress so costly and kingly
 that no royalty ever owned its fellow." The Marid replied, "I hear and
 I obey," and carried him to baths such as were never seen by the Kings
 of the Chosroes, for the building was all of alabaster and camelian,
 and it contained marvelous limnings which captured the sight, and
 the great hall was studded with precious stones. Not a soul was
 therein, but when Aladdin entered, one of the Jann in human shape
 washed him and bathed him to the best of his desire. Aladdin after
 having been washed and bathed, left the baths and went into the
 great hall, where he found that his old dress had been removed and
 replaced by a suit of the most precious and princely. Then he was
 served with sherbets and ambergrised coffee, and after drinking he
 arose and a party of black slaves came forward and clad him in the
 costliest of clothing, then perfumed and fumigated him. It is known
 that Aladdin was the son of a tailor, a pauper, yet now would none
 deem him to be such- nay, all would say: "This be the greatest that
 is of the progeny of the kings. Praise be to Him Who changeth and
 Who is not changed!"
 </p><p>  Presently came the Jinni and, lifting him up, bore him to his
 home, and asked, "O my lord, tell me, hast thou aught of need?" He
 answered: "Yes, 'tis my desire that thou bring me eight and forty
 Mamelukes, of whom two dozen shall forego me and the rest follow me,
 the whole number with their war chargers and clothing and
 accouterments. And all upon them and their steeds must be of naught
 save of highest worth and the costliest, such as may not be found in
 treasuries of the kings. Then fetch me a stallion fit for the riding
 of the Chosroes and let his furniture, all thereof, be of gold crusted
 with the finest gems. Fetch me also eight and forty thousand dinars,
 that each white slave may carry a thousand gold pieces. 'Tis now my
 intent to fare to the, Sultan, so delay thou not, for that without
 an these requisites whereof I bespake thee I may no visit him.
 Moreover, set before me a dozen slave girls unique in beauty and dight
 with the most magnificent dresses, that they wend with my mother to
 the royal palace, and let every handmaid be robed in raiment that
 befitteth Queen's wearing." The slave replied, "To hear is to obey,"
 and, disappearing for an eye twinkling, brought all he was bidden
 bring, and led by hand a stallion whose rival was not amongst the
 Arabian Arabs, and its saddlecloth was of splendid brocade
 gold-in-wrought.
 </p><p>  Thereupon, without stay or delay, Aladdin sent for his mother and
 gave her the garments she should wear and committed to her charge
 the twelve slave girls forming her suite to the palace. Then he sent
 one of the Mamelukes whom the Jinni had brought to see if the Sultan
 had left the seraglio or not. The white slave went forth lighter
 than the lightning and, returned in like haste, said, "O my lord,
 the Sultan awaiteth thee!" Hereat Aladdin arose and took horse, his
 Mamelukes riding a-van and arear of him, and they were such that all
 must cry, "Laud to the Lord Who created them and clothed them with
 such beauty and loveliness!" And they scattered gold amongst the crowd
 in front of their master, who surpassed them all in comeliness and nor
 needest thou ask concerning the sons of the kings- praise be to the
 Bountiful, the Eternal! All this was of the virtues of the wonderful
 lamp, which whoso possessed, him it gifted with fairest favor and
 finest figure, with wealth and with wisdom. The folk admired Aladdin's
 liberality and exceeding generosity, and all were distraught seeing
 his charms and elegance, his gravity and his good manners. They
 glorified the Creator for this noble creation, they blessed him each
 and every, and albeit they knew him for the son of Such-a-one, the
 tailor, yet no man envied him- nay, all owned that he deserved his
 great good fortune.
 </p><p>  Now the Sultan had assembled the lords of the land and, informing
 them of the promise he had passed to Aladdin touching the marriage
 of his daughter, had bidden them await his approach and then go forth,
 one and all, to meet him and greet him. Hereupon the emirs and wazirs,
 the chamberlains, the nabobs and the army officers, took their
 stations expecting him at the palace gate. Aladdin would fain have
 dismounted at the outer entrance, but one of the nobles, whom the King
 had deputed for such duty, approached him and said, "O my lord, 'tis
 the royal command that thou enter riding thy steed, nor dismount
 except at the Divan door." Then they all forewent him in a body and
 conducted him to the appointed place, where they crowded about him,
 these to hold his stirrup and those supporting him on either side
 whilst others took him by the hands and helped him dismount. After
 which all the emirs and nobles preceded him into the Divan and led him
 close up to the royal throne.
 </p><p>  Thereupon the Sultan came down forthright from his seat of estate
 and, forbidding him to buss the carpet, embraced and kissed and seated
 him to the right of and beside himself. Aladdin did whatso is suitable
 in the case of the kings of salutation and offering of blessings, and
 said: "O our lord the Sultan, indeed the generosity of thy Highness
 demanded that thou deign vouchsafe to me the hand of thy daughter, the
 Lady Badr al-Budur, albeit I undeserve the greatness of such gift, I
 being but the humblest of thy slaves. I pray Allah grant thee
 prosperity and perpetuance, but in very sooth, O King, my tongue is
 helpless to thank thee for the fullness of the favor, passing all
 measure, which thou hast bestowed upon me. And I hope of thy Highness
 that thou wilt give me a piece of ground fitted for a pavilion which
 shall besit thy daughter, the Lady Badr al-Budur." The Sultan was
 struck with admiration when he saw Aladdin in his princely suit and
 looked upon him and considered his beauty and loveliness, and noted
 the Mamelukes standing to serve him in their comeliness and seemlihed.
 And still his marvel grew when the mother of Aladdin approached him in
 costly raiment and sumptuous, clad as though she were a queen, and
 when he gazed upon the twelve handmaids standing before her with
 crossed arms and with all worship and reverence doing her service. He
 also considered the eloquence of Aladdin and his delicacy of speech,
 and he was astounded thereat, he and all his who were present at the
 levee.
 </p><p>  Thereupon fire was kindled in the Grand Wazir's heart for envy of
 Aladdin until he was like to die. And it was worse when the Sultan,
 after hearing the youth's succession of prayers and seeing his high
 dignity of demeanor, respectful withal, and his eloquence and elegance
 of language, clasped him to his bosom and kissed him and cried, "Alas,
 O my son, that I have not enjoyed thy converse before this day!" He
 rejoiced in him with mighty great joy and straightway bade the music
 and the bands strike up. Then he arose and taking the yotith, led
 him into the palace, where supper had been prepared, and the eunuchs
 at once laid the tables. So the sovereign sat down and seated his
 son-in-law on his right side, and the wazirs and high officials and
 lords of the land took places each according to his degree,
 whereupon the bands played and a mighty fine marriage feast was
 dispread in the palace. The King now applied himself to making
 friendship with Aladdin and conversed with the youth, who answered him
 with all courtesy and eloquence, as though he had been bred in the
 palaces of the kings or he had lived with them his daily life. And the
 more the talk was prolonged between them, the more did the Sultan's
 pleasure and delight increase, hearing his son-in-law's readiness of
 reply and his sweet flow of language.
 </p><p>  But after they had eaten and drunken and the trays were removed, the
 King bade summon the kazis and witnesses, who presently attended and
 knitted the knot and wrote out the contract writ between Aladdin and
 the Lady Badr al-Budur. And presently the bridegroom arose and would
 have fared forth, when his father-in-law withheld him and asked:
 "Whither away, O my child? The bride fetes have begun and the marriage
 is made and the tie is tied and the writ is written." He replied: "O
 my lord the King, 'tis my desire to edify, for the Lady Badr al-Budur,
 a pavilion befitting her station and high degree, nor can I visit
 her before so doing. But, Inshallah! the building shall be finished
 within the shortest time, by the utmost endeavor of thy slave and by
 the kindly regard of thy Hihgness. And although I do (yes indeed!)
 long to enjoy the society of the Lady Badr al-Budur, yet 'tis
 incumbent of me first to serve her, and it becometh me to set about
 the work forthright." "Look around thee, O my son," replied the
 Sultan, "for what ground thou deemest suitable to thy design, and do
 thou take all things into thy hands. But I deem the best for thee will
 be yonder broad plain facing my palace, and if it please thee, build
 thy pavilion thereupon." "And this," answered Aladdin, "is the sum
 of my wishes, that I may be near-hand to thy Highness.
 </p><p>  So saying, he farewelled the King and took horse, with his Mamelukes
 riding before him and behind him, and all the world blessed him and
 cried, "By Allah he is deserving," until such time as he reached his
 home. Then he alighted from his stallion and repairing to his chamber,
 rubbed the lamp and behold, the slave stood before him and said, "Ask,
 O my lord, whatso thou wantest," and Aladdin rejoined: "I require thee
 of a service grave and important which thou must do for me, and 'tis
 that thou build me with all urgency a pavillion fronting the palace of
 the Sultan. And it must be a marvel for it shall be provided with
 every requisite, such as royal furniture and so forth." The slave
 replied, "To hear is to Obey," and evanished, and before the next dawn
 brake returned to Aladdin and said: "O my lord, the pavilion is
 finished to the fullest of thy fancy, and if thou wouldst inspect
 it, arise forthright and fare with me."
 </p><p>  Accordingly he rose up, and the slave carried him in the space of an
 eye glance to the pavilion, which when looked upon it struck him
 with surprise at such building, all its stones being of jasper and
 alabaster, Sumaki marble and mosaicwork. Then the slave led him into
 the treasury, which was full of all manner of gold and silver and
 costly gems, not to be counted or computed, priced or estimated.
 Thence to another place, where Aladdin saw all requisites for the
 table, plates and dishes, spoons and ladles, basins and covers, cups
 and tasses, the whole of precious metal. Thence to the kitchen,
 where they found the kitcheners provided with their needs and
 cooking batteries, likewise golden and silvern. Thence to a
 warehouse piled up with chests full-packed of royal raiment, stuffs
 that captured the reason, such as gold-wrought brocades from India and
 China and kimcobs or orfrayed cloths. Thence to many apartments
 replete with appointments which beggar description. Thence to the
 stables containing coursers whose like was not to be met with
 amongst the kings of the universe. And lastly they went to the harness
 rooms all hung with housings, costly saddles, and other furniture,
 everywhere studded with pearls and precious stones. And all this was
 the work of one night.
 </p><p>  Aladdin was wonder-struck and astounded by that magnificent
 display of wealth, which not even the mightiest monarch on earth could
 produce, and more so to see his pavilion fully provided with eunuchs
 and handmaids whose beauty would reduce a saint. Yet the Prime
 marvel of the pavilion was an upper kiosque or belvedere of four and
 twenty windows all made of emeralds and rubies and other gems, and one
 window remained unfinished at the requirement of Aladdin, that the
 Sultan might prove him impotent to complete it. When the youth had
 inspected the whole edifice, he was pleased and gladdened exceedingly.
 Then, turning to the slave, he said: "I require of thee still one
 thing which is yet wanting and whereof I had forgotten to tell
 thee." "Ask, O my lord, thy want," quoth the servitor, and quoth the
 other: "I demand of thee a carpet of the primest brocade all
 gold-inwrought which, when unrolled and outstretched, shall extend
 hence to the Sultan's palace, in order that the Lady Badr al-Budur
 may, when coming hither, pace upon it and not tread common earth." The
 slave departed for a short while and said on his return, "O my lord,
 verily that which thou demandest is here." Then he took him and showed
 him a carpet, which wildered the wits, and it extended from palace
 to pavillion. And after this the servitor bore off Aladdin and set him
 down in his own home.
 </p><p>  Now day was brightening, so the Sultan rose from his sleep and
 throwing open the casement, looked out and espied opposite his
 palace a palatial pavilion ready edified. Thereupon he fell to rubbing
 his eyes and opening them their widest and considering the scene,
 and he soon was certified that the new edifice was mighty fine, and
 grand enough to bewilder the wits. Moreover, with amazement as great
 he saw the carpet dispread between palace and pavilion. Like their
 lord, also the royal doorkeepers and the household, one and all,
 were dazed and amazed at the spectacle. Meanwhile the Wazir came in,
 and as he entered, espied the newly builded pavilion and the carpet,
 whereat he also wondered. And when he went in to the Sultan, the twain
 fell to talking on this marvelous matter with great surprise at a
 sight which distracted the gazer and attracted the heart. They said
 finally, "In very truth, of this pavilion we deem that none of the
 royalties could build its fellow," and the King, turning to the
 Minister, asked him: "Hast thou seen now that Aladdin is worthy to
 be the husband of the Princess, my daughter? Hast thou looked upon and
 considered this right royal building, this magnificence of opulence,
 which thought of man cannot contain?" But the Wazir in his envy of
 Aladdin replied: "O King of the Age, indeed this foundation and this
 building and this opulence may not be save by means of magic, nor
 can any man in the world, be he the richest in good or the greatest in
 governance, avail to found and finish in a single night such edifice
 as this." The Sultan rejoined: "I am surprised to see in thee how thou
 dost continually harp on evil opinion of Aladdin, but I hold that 'tis
 caused by thine envy and jealousy. Thou wast present when I gave him
 the ground at his own prayer for a place whereon he might build a
 pavilion wherein to lodge my daughter, and I myself favored him with a
 site for the same, and that too before thy very face. But however that
 be, shall one who could send me as dower for the Princess such store
 of such stones whereof the kings never obtained even a few, shall
 he, I say, be unable to edify an edifice like this?" When the Wazir
 heard the Sultan's words, he knew that his lord loved Aladdin
 exceedingly, so his envy and malice increased. only, as he could do
 nothing against the youth, he sat silent, and impotent to return a
 reply.
 </p><p>  But Aladdin, seeing that it was broad day and the appointed time had
 come for his repairing to the Place (where his wedding was being
 celebrated and the emirs and wazirs and grandees were gathered
 together about the Sultan to be present at the ceremony), arose and
 rubbed the lamp, and when its slave appeared and said, "O my lord, ask
 whatso thou wantest, for I stand before thee and at thy service," said
 he: "I mean forthright to seek the palace, this day being my wedding
 festival, and I want thee to supply me with ten thousand dinars."
 The slave evanished for an eye twinkling and returned bringing the
 moneys, when Aladdin took horse with his Mamelukes a-van and arear and
 passed on his way, scattering as he went gold pieces upon the lieges
 until all were fondly affected toward him and his dignity was
 enhanced. But when he drew near the palace, and the emirs and agas and
 army officers who were standing to await him noted his approach,
 they hastened straightway to the King and gave him the tidings
 thereof, whereupon the Sultan rose and met his son-in-law and, after
 embracing and kissing him, led him, still holding his hand, into his
 own apartment, where he sat down and seated him by his right side.
 </p><p>  The city was all decorated and music rang through the palace and the
 singers sang until the King bade bring the noon meal, when the eunuchs
 and Mamelukes hastened to spread the tables and trays which are such
 as are served to the kings. Then the Sultan and Aladdin and the
 lords of the land and the grandees of the realm took their seats and
 ate and drank until they were satisfied. And it was a mighty fine
 wedding in city and palace, and the high nobles all rejoiced therein
 and the commons of the kingdom were equally gladdened, while the
 governors of provinces and nabobs of districts flocked from far
 regions to witness Aladdin's marriage and its processions and
 festivities. The Sultan also marveled in his mind to look at Aladdin's
 mother and recall to mind how she was wont to visit him in pauper
 plight while her son could command an this opulence and
 magnificence. And when the spectators who crowded the royal palace
 to enjoy the wedding feasts looked upon Aladdin's pavilion and
 beauties of the building, they were seized with an immense surprise,
 that so vast an edifice as this could be reared on high during a
 single night, and they blessed the youth and cried: "Allah gladden
 him: By Allah, he deserveth all this! Allah bless his days!"
 </p><p>  When dinner was done, Aladdin rose and, farewelling the Sultan, took
 horse with his Mamelukes and rode to his own pavilion, that he might
 prepare to receive therein his bride, the Lady Badr al-Budur. And as
 he passed, all the folk shouted their good wishes with one voice and
 their words were: "Allah gladden thee! Allah increase thy glory! Allah
 grant thee length of life!" while immense crowds of people gathered to
 swell the marriage procession, and they conducted him to his new home,
 he showering gold upon them during the whole time. When he reached his
 pavilion, he dismounted and walked in and sat him down on the divan,
 whilst his Mamelukes stood before him with arms afolded. Also after
 a short delay they brought him sherbets, and when these were drunk, he
 ordered his white slaves and handmaids and eunuchs and all who were in
 the pavilion to make ready for meeting the Lady Badr al-Budur.
 Moreover, as soon as midafternoon came and the air had cooled and
 the great heat of the sun was abated, the Sultan bade his army
 officers and emirs and wazirs go down into the maydan plain, whither
 he likewise rode. And Aladdin also took horse with his Mamelukes, he
 mounting a stallion whose like was not among the steeds of the, Arab
 al-Arba, and he showed his horsemanship in the hippodrome, and so
 played with the jarid that none could withstand him, while his bride
 sat gazing upon him from the latticed balcony of her bower and, seeing
 in him such beauty and cavalarice, she fell headlong in love of him
 and was like to fly for joy. And after they had ringed their horses on
 the maydan and each had displayed whatso he could of horsemanship,
 Aladdin proving himself the best man of all, they rode in a body to
 the Sultan's palace and the youth also returned to his own pavilion.
 </p><p>  But when it was evening, the wazirs and nobles took the bridegroom
 and, falling in, escorted him to the royal hamman (known as the
 Sultani), when he was bathed. and perfumed. As soon as he came out
 he donned a dress more magnificent than the former and took horse with
 the emirs and the soldier officers riding before him and forming a
 grand cortege, wherein four of the wazirs bore naked swords round
 about him. All the citizens and the strangers and the troops marched
 before him in ordered throng carrying wax candles and kettledrums
 and pipes and other instruments of mirth and merriment, until they
 conducted him to his pavilion. Here he alighted and, walking in,
 took his seat and seated the wazirs and emirs who had escorted him,
 and the Mamelukes brought sherbets and sugared drinks, which they also
 passed to the people who had followed in his train. It was a world
 of folk whose tale might not be told. Withal Aladdin bade his
 Mamelukes stand without the pavilion doors and shower gold upon the
 crowd.
 </p><p>  When the Sultan returned from the maydan plain to his palace, he
 ordered the household, men as well as women, straightway to form a
 cavalcade for his daughter, with all ceremony, and bear her to her
 bridegroom's pavilion. So the nobles and soldier officers who had
 followed and escorted the bridegroom at once mounted, and the
 handmaids and eunuchs went forth with wax candles and made a mighty
 fine procession for the Lady Badr al-Budur, and they paced on
 preceding her till they entered the pavilion of Aladdin, whose
 mother walked beside the bride. In front of the Princess also fared
 the wives of the wazirs and emirs, grandees and notables, and in
 attendance on her were the eight and forty slave girls presented to
 her aforetime by her bridegroom, each hending in hand a huge cierge
 scented with camphor and ambergris and set in a candlestick of
 gem-studded gold. And reaching Aladdin's pavilion, they led her to her
 bower in the upper story and changed her robes and enthroned her.
 Then, as soon as the displaying was ended, they accompanied her to
 Aladdin's apartments, and presently he paid her the first visit. Now
 his mother was with the bride, and when the bridegroom came up and did
 off her veil, the ancient dame fell to considering the beauty of the
 Princess and her loveliness, and she looked around at the pavilion,
 which was all litten up by gold and gems besides the manifold
 candelabra of precious metals encrusted with emeralds and jacinths, so
 she said in her mind: "Once upon a time I thought the Sultan's
 palace mighty fine, but this pavilion is a thing apart. Nor do I
 deem that any of the greatest kings of Chosroes attained in his day to
 aught like thereof. Also am I certified that all the world could not
 build anything evening it." Nor less did the Lady Badr al-Budur fall
 to gazing at the pavilion and marveling for its magnificence.
 </p><p>  Then the tables were spread and they all ate and drank and were
 gladdened after which fourscore damsels came before them, each holding
 in hand an instrument of mirth and merriment. Then they deftly moved
 their finger tips and touched the strings, smiting them into song most
 musical most melancholy, till they rent the hearts of the hearers.
 Hereat the Princess increased in marvel, and quoth she to herself, "In
 all my life ne'er heard I songs like these," till she forsook food,
 the better to listen. And at last Aladdin poured out for her wine
 and passed it to her with his own hand. So great joy and jubilee
 went round amongst them, and it was a notable night, such a one as
 Iskandar, Lord of the Two Horns, had never spent in his time. When
 they had finished eating and drinking and the tables were removed from
 before them, Aladdin arose and went in to his bride.
 </p><p>  As soon as morning morrowed he left his bed, and the treasurer
 brought him a costly suit and a mighty fine, of the most sumptuous
 robes worn by the kings. Then, after drinking coffee flavored with
 ambergris, he ordered the horses be saddled and, mounting with his
 Mamelukes before and behind him, rode to the Sultan's palace, and on
 his entering its court the eunuchs went in and reported his coming
 to their lord. When the Sultan heard of Aladdin's approach, he rose up
 forthright to receive him and embraced and kissed him as though he
 were his own son. Then, seating him on his right, he blessed and
 prayed for him, as did the wazirs and emirs, the lords of the land and
 the grandees of the realm. Presently the King commanded bring the
 morning meal, which the attendants served up, and all broke their fast
 together, and when they had eaten and drunken their sufficiency and
 the tables were removed by the eunuchs, Aladdin turned to the Sultan
 and said: "O my lord, would thy Highness deign honor me this day at
 dinner in the house of the Lady Badr al-Budur, thy beloved daughter,
 and come accompanied by all thy Ministers and grandees of the
 reign?" The King replied (and he was delighted with his son-in-law),
 "Thou art surpassing in liberality, O my son!"
 </p><p>  Then he gave orders to all invited and rode forth with them (Aladdin
 also riding beside him) till they reached the pavilion, and as he
 entered it and considered its construction, its architecture and its
 stonery, all jasper and camelian, his sight was dazed and his wits
 were amazed at such grandeur and magnificence of opulence. Then,
 turning to the Minister, he thus addressed him: "What sayest thou?
 Tell me, hast thou seen in all thy time aught like this amongst the
 mighties of earth's monarchs for the abundance of gold and gems we are
 now beholding?" The Grand Wazir replied: "O my lord the King, this
 be a feat which cannot be accomplished by might of monarch amongst
 Adam's sons, nor could the collected peoples of the universal world
 build a palace like unto this,- nay, even builders could not be found
 to make aught resembling it, save (as I said to thy Highness) by force
 of sorcery." These words certified the King that his Minister spake
 not except in envy and jealousy of Aladdin, and would stablish in
 the royal mind that all this splendor was not made of man, but by
 means of magic and with the aid of the black art. So quoth he to
 him: "Suffice thee so much, O Wazir. Thou hast none other word to
 speak, and well I know what cause urgeth thee to say this say."
 </p><p>  Then Aladdin preceded the Sultan till he conducted him to the
 upper kiosque, where he saw its skylights, windows, and latticed
 casements and jalousies wholly made of emeralds and rubies and other
 costly gems, whereat his mind was perplexed and his wits were
 bewildered and his thoughts were distraught. Presently he took to
 strolling round the kiosque and solacing himself with these sights
 which captured the vision, till he chanced to cast a glance at the
 window which Aladdin by design had left unwrought and not finished
 like the rest. And when he noted its lack of completion, he cried,
 "Woe and wellaway for thee, O window, because of thine
 imperfection," and, turning to his Minister, he asked, "Knowest thou
 the reason of leaving incomplete this window and its framework?" The
 Wazir said: "O my lord, I conceive that the want of finish in this
 window resulteth from thy Highness having pushed on Aladdin's
 marriage, and he lacked the leisure to complete it." Now at that
 time Aladdin had gone in to his bride, the Lady Badr al-Budur, to
 inform her of her father's presence, and when he returned, the King
 asked him: "O my son, what is the reason why the window of this
 kiosque was not made perfect?" "O King of the Age, seeing the
 suddenness of my wedding," answered he, "I failed to find artists
 for finishing it." Quoth the Sultan, "I have a mind to complete it
 myself," and quoth Aladdin: "Allah perpetuate thy glory, O thou the
 King. So shall thy memory endure in thy daughter's pavilion."
 </p><p>  The Sultan forthright bade summon jewelers and goldsmiths, and
 ordered them he supplied from the treasury with all their needs of
 gold and gems and noble ores, and when they were gathered together, he
 commanded them to complete the work still wanting in the kiosque
 window. Meanwhile the Princess came forth to meet her sire, the
 Sultan, who noticed as she drew near her smiling face, so he
 embraced her and kissed her, then led her to the pavilion, and all
 entered in a body. Now this was the time of the noonday meal and one
 table had been spread for the sovereign, his daughter, and his
 son-in-law and a second for the wazirs, the lords of the land, the
 grandees of the realm, the chief officers of the host, the
 chamberlains and the nabobs. The King took seat between the Princess
 and her husband, and when he put forth his hand to the food and tasted
 it, he was struck with surprise by the flavor of the dishes and
 their savory and sumptuous cooking. Moreover, there stood before him
 the fourscore damsels, each and every saying to the full moon, "Rise
 that I may seat myself in thy stead!" All held instruments of mirth
 and merriment, and they tuned the same and deftly moved their finger
 tips and smote the srings into song most musical, most melodious,
 which expanded the mourner's heart. Hereby the Sultan was gladdened,
 and time was good to him, and for high enjoyment he exclaimed, "In
 very sooth the thing is beyond the compass of King and Caesar."
 </p><p>  Then they fell to eating and drinking, and the cup went round
 until they had drunken enough, when sweetmeats and fruits of sorts and
 other such edibles were served, the dessert being laid out in a
 different salon, whither they removed and enjoyed of these pleasures
 their sufficiency. Presently the Sultan arose that he might see if the
 produce of his jewelers and goldsmiths favored that of the pavilion.
 So he went upstairs to them and inspected their work and how they had
 wrought, but he noted a mighty great difference, and his men were
 far from being able to make anything like the rest of Aladdin's
 pavilion. They informed him how all the gems stored in the lesser
 Treasury had been brought to them and used by them, but that the whole
 had proved insufficient. Wherefor he bade open the greater Treasury,
 and gave the workmen all they wanted of him. Moreover, he allowed
 them, an it sufficed not, to take the jewels wherewith Aladdin had
 gifted him. They carried off the whole and pushed on their labors, but
 they found the gems fail them, albeit had they not finished half the
 part wanting to the kiosque window. Herewith the King commanded them
 to seize all the precious stones owned by the wazirs and grandees of
 the realm, but although they did his bidding, the supply still fell
 short of their requirements.
 </p><p>  Next morning Aladdin arose to look at the jewelers' work and
 remarked that they had not finished a moiety of what was wanting to
 the kiosque window. So he at once ordered them to undo all they had
 done and restore the jewels to their owners. Accordingly they pulled
 out the precious stones and sent the Sultan's to the Sultan and the
 wazirs' to the wazirs. Then the jewelers went to the King and told him
 of what Aladdin had bidden, so he asked them: "What said he to you,
 and what was his reason, and wherefore was he not content that the
 window be finished, and why did he undo the work ye wrought?" They
 answered, "O our lord, we know not at all, but he bade us deface
 whatso we had done." Hereupon the Sultan at once called for his horse,
 and mounting, took the way pavillonward, when Aladdin, after
 dismissing the goldsmiths and jewelers had retired into his closet and
 had rubbed the lamp. Hereat straightway its servitor appeared to him
 and said: "Ask whatso thou wantest. Thy slave is between thy hands,"
 and said Aladdin, "'Tis my desire that thou finish the window which
 was left unfinished." The Marid replied, "On my head be it, and also
 upon mine eyes!" Then he vanished, and after a little while
 returned, saying, "O my lord, verily that thou commandedst me do is
 completed." So Aladdin went upstairs to the kiosque and found the
 whole window in wholly finished state, and whilst he was he was
 still considering it, behold, a castrato came in to him and said: "O
 my lord, the Sultan hath ridden forth to visit thee and is passing
 through the pavilion gate."
 </p><p>  So Aladdin at once went down and received his father-in-law. The
 Sultan, on sighting his son-in-law, cried to him: "Wherefore, O my
 child, hast thou wrought on this wise and sufferedst not the
 jewelers to complete the kiosque window, leaving in the pavilion an
 unfinished place?" Aladdin replied: "O King of the Age, I left it
 not imperfect save for a design of mine own, nor was I incapable of
 perfecting it, nor could I purpose that thy Highness should honor me
 with visiting a pavilion wherein was aught of deficiency. And that
 thou mayest know I am not unable to make it perfect, let thy
 Highness deign walk upstairs with me and see if anything remain to
 be done therewith or not." So the Sultan went up with him and,
 entering the kiosque, fell to looking right and left, but he saw no
 default at all in any of the windows- nay, he noted that all were
 perfect. So he marveled at the sight and embraced Aladdin and kissed
 him, saying: "O my son, what be this singular feat? Thou canst work in
 a single night what in months the jewelers could not do. By Allah, I
 deem thou hast nor brother nor rival in this world." Quoth Aladdin:
 "Allah prolong thy life and preserve thee to perpetuity! Thy slave
 deserveth not this encomium." And quoth the King: "By Allah, O my
 child, thou meritest all praise for a feat whereof all the artists
 of the world were incapable." Then the Sultan came down and entered
 the apartments of his daughter, the Lady Badr al-Budur, to take rest
 beside her, and he saw her joyous exceedingly at the glory and
 grandeur wherein she was. Then, after reposing awhile, he returned
 to his palace.
 </p><p>  Now Aladdin was wont every day to thread the city streets with his
 Mamelukes riding a-van and arear of him showering rightward and
 leftward gold upon the folk, and all the world, stranger and neighbor,
 far and near, were fulfilled of his love for the excess of his
 liberality and generosity. Moreover, he increased the pensions of
 the poor Religious and the paupers, and he would distribute alms to
 them with his own hand, by which good deed he won high renown
 throughout the realm and most of the lords of the land and emirs would
 eat at his table, and men swore not at all save by his precious
 life. Nor did he leave faring to the chase and the maydan plain and
 the riding of horses and playing at javelin play in presence of the
 Sultan. And whenever the Lady Badr al-Budur beheld him disporting
 himself on the backs of steeds, she loved him much the more, and
 thought to herself that Allah had wrought her abundant good by causing
 to happen whatso happened with the son of the Wazir and by
 preserving her virginity intact for her true bridegroom, Aladdin.
 Aladdin won for himself day by day a fairer fame and a rarer report,
 while affection for him increased in the hearts of all the lieges
 and he waxed greater in the eyes of men.
 </p><p>  Moreover, it chanced that in those days certain enemies took horse
 and attacked the Sultan, who armed and accoutered an army to repel
 them and made Aladdin commander thereof. So he marched with his men,
 nor ceased marching until he drew near the foe, whose forces were
 exceeding many, and presently when the action began, he bared his
 brand and charged home upon the enemy. Then battle and slaughter
 befell and violent was the hurly-burly, but at last Aladdin broke
 the hostile host and put all to flight, slaying the best part of
 them and pillaging their coin and cattle, property and possessions,
 and he despoiled them of spoils that could not be counted nor
 computed. Then he returned victorious after a noble victory and
 entered the capital, which had decorated herself in his honor, of
 her delight in him. And the Sultan went forth to meet him and giving
 him joy, embraced him and kissed him. And throughout the kingdom was
 held high festival with great joy and gladness. Presently the
 sovereign and his son-in-law repaired to the pavilion, where they were
 met by the Princess Badr al-Budur, who rejoiced in her husband and,
 after kissing him between the eyes, led him to her apartments. After a
 time the Sultan also came and they sat down while the slave girls
 brought them sherbets and confections, which they ate and drank.
 Then the Sultan commanded that the whole kingdom be decorated for
 the triumph of his son-in-law and his victory over the invader, and
 the subjects and soldiery and all the people knew only Allah in Heaven
 and Aladdin on earth, for that their love, won by his liberality,
 was increased by his noble horsemanship and his successful battling
 for the country and putting to flight the foe.
 </p><p>  Such then was the high fortune of Aladdin, but as regards the
 Maghrabi, the magician, after returning to his native country he
 passed all this space of time in bewailing what he had borne of toil
 and travail to will the lamp, and mostly that his trouble had gone
 vain and that the morsel when almost touching his lips had flown
 from his grasp. He pondered all this and mourned and reviled Aladdin
 for the excess of his rage against him, and at times he would exclaim:
 "For this bastard's death underground I am well satisfied, and hope
 only that some time or other I may obtain the lamp, seeing how 'tis
 yet safe." Now one day of the days he struck a table of sand and
 dotted down the figures and carefully considered their consequence,
 then he transferred them to paper that he might study them and make
 sure of Aladdin's destruction and the safety of the lamp preserved
 beneath the earth. Presently he firmly stablished the sequence of
 the figures, mothers as well as daughters, but still he saw not the
 lamp. Thereupon rage overrode him and he made another trial to be
 assured of Aladdin's death, but he saw him not in the enchanted
 treasure.
 </p><p>  Hereat his wrath still grew, and it waxed greater when he
 ascertained that the youth had issued from underground and was now
 upon earth's surface alive and alert. Furthermore, that he had
 become owner of the lamp, for which he had himself endured such toil
 and travail and troubles as man may not bear save for so great an
 object. Accordingly quoth he to himself: "I have suffered sore pains
 and penalties which none else could have endured for the lamp's sake
 in order that other than that I may carry it off, and this accursed
 hath taken it without difficulty. And who knoweth an he wot the
 virtues of the lamp, than whose owner none in the world should be
 wealthier? There is no help but that I work for his destruction." He
 then struck another geomantic table and, examining the figures, saw
 that the lad had won for himself unmeasurable riches and had wedded
 the daughter of his King, so of his envy and jealousy he was fired
 with the flame of wrath, and rising without let or stay, he equipped
 himself and set forth for China land, where he arrived in due season.
 </p><p>  Now when he had reached the King's capital wherein was Aladdin, he
 alighted at one of the khans, and when he had rested from the
 weariness of wayfare, he donned his dress and went down to wander
 about the streets, where he never passed a group without hearing
 them prate about the pavilion and its grandeur and vaunt the beauty of
 Aladdin and his lovesomeness, his liberality and generosity, his
 fine manners and his good morals. Presently he entered an
 establishment wherein men were drinking a certain warm beverage, and
 going up to one of those who were loud in their lauds, he said to him,
 "O fair youth, who may be the man ye describe and commend?"
 "Apparently thou art a foreigner, O man," answered the other, "and
 thou comest from a far country. But even this granted, how happeneth
 it thou hast not heard of the Emir Aladdin, whose renown, I fancy,
 hath filled the universe, and whose pavilion, known by report to far
 and near, is one of the wonders of the world? How, then, never came to
 thine ears aught of this or the name of Aladdin (whose glory and
 enjoyment Our Lord increase!) and his fame?" The Moorman replied: "The
 sum of my wishes is to look upon this pavilion, and if thou wouldest
 do me a favor, prithee guide me thereunto, for I am a foreigner."
 The man rejoined, "To hear is to obey," and, foregoing him, pointed
 out Aladdin's pavilion, whereupon the Moroccan fell to considering it,
 and at once understood that it was the work of the lamp. So he
 cried: "Ah! Ah! needs must I dig a pit for this accursed, this son
 of a snip, who could not earn for himself even an evening meal. And if
 the Fates abet me, I will assuredly destroy his life and send his
 mother back to spinning at her wheel, e'en as she was wont erewhiles
 to do."
 </p><p>  So saying, he returned to his caravanserai in a sore state of
 grief and melancholy and regret bred by his envy and hate of
 Aladdin. He took his astrological gear and geomantic table to discover
 where might he the lamp, and he found that it was in the pavilion
 and not upon Aladdin's person. So he rejoiced thereat with joy
 exceeding and exclaimed: "Now indeed 'twill he an easy task to take
 the life of this accursed and I see my way to getting the lamp."
 Then he went to a coppersmith and said to him: "Do thou make me a
 set of lamps, and take from me their full price and more, only I would
 have thee hasten to finish them." Replied the smith, "Hearing and
 obeying," and fell a-working to keep his word. And when they were
 ready, the Moorman paid him what price he required, then, taking them,
 he carried them to the khan and set them in a basket. Presently he
 began wandering about the highways and market streets of the capital
 crying aloud: "Ho! Who will exchange old lamps for new lamps?" But
 when the folk heard him cry on this wise, they derided him and said,
 "Doubtless this man is Jinnmad, for that he goeth about offering new
 for old." And a world followed him, and the children of the quarter
 caught him up from place to place, laughing at him the while, nor
 did he forbid them or care for their maltreatment. And he ceased not
 strolling about the streets till he came under Aladdin's pavilion,
 where he shouted with his loudest voice, and the boys screamed at him:
 "A madman! A madman!"
 </p><p>  Now Destiny had decreed that the Lady Badr al-Budur be sitting in
 her kiosque, whence she heard one crying like a crier, and the
 children bawling at him. Only she understood not what was going on, so
 she gave orders to one of her slave girls, saying, "Go thou and see
 who 'tis that crieth, and what be his cry." The girl fared forth and
 looked on, when she beheld a man crying, "Ho! Who will exchange old
 lamps for new lamps?" and the little ones pursuing and laughing at
 him. And as loudly laughed the Princess when this strange case was
 told to her. Now Aladdin had carelessly left the lamp in his
 pavilion without hiding it and locking it up in his strongbox, and one
 of the slave girls who had seen it said: "O my lady, I think to have
 noticed in the apartment of my lord Aladdin an old lamp, so let us
 give it in change for a new lamp to this man, and see if his cry he
 truth or lie." Whereupon the Princess said to the slave girl, "Bring
 the old lamp which thou saidst to have seen in thy lord's apartment."
 </p><p>  Now the Lady Badr al-Budur knew naught of the lamp and of the
 specialities thereof which had raised Aladdin, her spouse, to such
 high degree and grandeur, and her only end and aim was to understand
 by experiment the mind of a man who would give in exchange the new for
 the old. So the handmaid fared forth and went up to Aladdin's
 apartment and returned with the lamp to her lady, who, like all the
 others, knew nothing of the Maghrabi's cunning tricks and his crafty
 device. Then the Princess bade an aga of the eunuchry go down and
 barter the old lamp for a new lamp. So he obeyed her bidding and,
 after taking a new lamp from the man, he returned and laid it before
 his lady, who looking at it and seeing that it was brand-new, fell
 to laughing at the Moorman's wits.
 </p><p>  But the Moroccan, when he held the article in hand and recognized it
 for the lamp of the enchanted treasury, at once placed it in his
 breast pocket and left all the other lamps to the folk who were
 bartering, of him. Then he went forth running till he was clear of the
 city, when he walked leisurely over the level grounds, and he took
 patience until night fell on him in desert ground, where was none
 other but himself. There he brought out the lamp, when suddenly
 appeared to him the Marid, who said: "Adsum! Thy slave between thy
 hands is come. Ask of me whatso thou wantest." "'Tis my desire," the
 Moorman replied, "that thou upraise from its present place Aladdin's
 pavilion, with its inmates and all that be therein, not forgetting
 myself, and set it down upon my own land, Africa. Thou knowest my
 town, and I want the building placed in the gardens hard by it." The
 Marid slave replied: "Hearkening and obedience. Close thine eyes and
 open thine eyes, whenas thou shalt find thyself together with the
 pavilion in thine own country." This was done, and in an eye twinkling
 the Moroccan and the pavilion, with all therein, were transported to
 the African land.
 </p><p>  Such then was the work of the Maghrabi, the magician, but now let us
 return to the Sultan and his son-in-law. It was the custom of the
 King, because of his attachment to and his affection for his daughter,
 every morning when he had shaken off sleep to open the latticed
 casement and look out therefrom, that he might catch sight of her
 abode. So that day he arose and did as he was wont. But when he drew
 near the latticed casement of his palace and looked out at Aladdin's
 pavilion, he saw naught- nay, the site was smooth as a well-trodden
 highway and like unto what it had been aforetime, and he could find
 nor edifice nor offices. So astonishment clothed him as with a
 garment, and his wits were wildered and he began to rub his eyes, lest
 they he dimmed or darkened, and to gaze intently. But at last he was
 certified that no trace of the pavilion remained, nor sign of its
 being, nor wist he the why and the wherefore of its disappearance.
 So his surprise increased and he smote hand upon hand and the tears
 trickled down his cheeks over his beard, for that he knew not what had
 become of his daughter.
 </p><p>  Then he sent out officials forthright and summoned the Grand
 Wazir, who at once attended, and seeing him in this piteous plight,
 said: "Pardon, O King of the Age, may Allah avert from thee every ill!
 Wherefore art thou in such sorrow?" Exclaimed the sovereign,
 "Methinketh thou wettest not my case." And quoth the Minister: "Oh
 no wise, O our lord. By Allah, I know of it nothing at all." "Then,"
 resumed the Sultan, "'tis manifest thou hast not looked this day in
 the direction of Aladdin's pavilion." "True, O my lord," quoth the
 Wazir. "It must still be locked and fast shut," and quoth the King:
 "Forasmuch as thou hast no inkling of aught, arise and look out at the
 window and see Aladdin's pavilion, whereof thou sayest 'tis locked and
 fast shut." The Minister obeyed his bidding, but could not see
 anything, or pavilion or other place. So with mind and thoughts sore
 perplexed he returned to his liege lord, who asked him: "Hast now
 learned the reason of my distress, and noted yon locked-up palace
 and fast shut?" Answered the Wazir: "O King of the Age, erewhile I
 represented to thy Highness that this pavilion and these matters be
 all magical." Hereat the Sultan, fired with wrath, cried, "Where be
 Aladdin?" and the Minister replied, "He hath gone a-hunting," when the
 King commanded without stay or delay sundry of his agas and army
 officers to go and bring to him his son-in-law chained and with
 pinioned elbows.
 </p><p>  So they fared forth until they found Aladdin, when they said to him:
 "O our lord Aladdin, excuse us, nor be thou wroth with us, for the
 King hath commanded that we carry thee before him pinioned and
 fettered, and we hope pardon from thee, because we are under the royal
 orders which we cannot gainsay." Aladdin, hearing these words, was
 seized with surprise, and not knowing the reason of this, remained
 tonguetied for a time, after which he turned to them and asked: "O
 assembly, have you naught of knowledge concerning the motive of the
 royal mandate? Well I wot my soul to be innocent, and that I never
 sinned against King or against kingdom." "O our lord," answered
 they, "we have no inkling whatever." So Aladdin alighted from his
 horse and said to them: "Do ye whatso the Sultan bade you do, for that
 the King's command is upon the head and the eyes." The agas, having
 bound Aladdin in bonds and pinioned his elbows behind his back,
 haled him in chains and carried him into the city. But when the lieges
 saw him pinioned and ironed, they understood that the Sultan
 purposed to strike off his head, and forasmuch as he was loved of them
 exceedingly, all gathered together and seized their weapons, then,
 swarming out of their houses, followed the soldiery to see what was to
 do. And when the troops arrived with Aladdin at the palace, they
 went in and informed the Sultan of this, whereat he forthright
 commanded the sworder to cut off the head of his son-in-law.
 </p><p>  Now as soon as the subjects were aware of this order, they
 barricaded the gates and closed the doors of the palace and sent a
 message to the King saying: "At this very moment we will level thine
 abode over the heads of all it containeth, and over thine own, if
 the least hurt or harm befall Aladdin." So the Wazir went in and
 reported to the Sultan: "O King of the Age, thy commandment is about
 to seal the roll of our lives, and 'twere more suitable that thou
 pardon thy son-in-law, lest there chance to us a sore mischance, for
 that the lieges do love him far more than they love us." Now the
 Sworder had already dispread the carpet of blood and, having seated
 Aladdin thereon, had bandaged his eyes. Moreover, he had walked
 round him three several times awaiting the last orders of his lord,
 when the King looked out of the window and saw his subjects, who had
 suddenly attacked him, swarming up the walls intending to tear them
 down. So forthright he bade the Sworder stay his hand from Aladdin and
 commanded the crier fare forth to the crowd and cry aloud that he
 had pardoned his son-in-law and received him back into favor.
 </p><p>  But when Aladdin found himself free and saw the Sultan seated on his
 throne, he went up to him and said: "O my lord, inasmuch as thy
 Highness hath favored me throughout my life, so of thy grace now deign
 let me know the how and the wherein I have sinned against thee." "O
 traitor," cried the King, "unto this present I knew not any sin of
 thine." Then, turning to the Wazir, he said: "Take him and make him
 look out at the window, and after let him tell us where be his
 pavilion." And when the royal order was obeyed, Aladdin saw the
 place level as a well-trodden road, even as it had been ere the base
 of the building was laid, nor was there the faintest trace of edifice.
 Hereat he was astonished and perplexed, knowing not what had occurred.
 But when he returned to the presence, the King asked him: "What is
 it thou hast seen? Where is thy pavilion, and where is my daughter,
 the core of my heart, my only child, than whom I have none other?"
 Aladdin answered, "O King of the Age, I wot naught thereof nor aught
 of what hath befallen," and the Sultan rejoined: "Thou must know, O
 Aladdin, I have pardoned thee only that thou go forth and look into
 this affair and inquire for me concerning my daughter. Nor do thou
 ever show thyself in my presence except she be with thee, and if
 thou bring her not, by the life of my head I will cut off the head
 of thee." The other replied: "To hear is to obey. Only vouchsafe me
 a delay and respite of some forty days, after which, an I produce
 her not, strike off my head and do with me whatso thou wishest." The
 Sultan said to Aladdin: "Verily, I have granted thee thy request, a
 delay of forty days. But think not thou canst fly from my hand, for
 I would bring thee back even if thou wert above the clouds instead
 of being only upon earth's surface." Replied Aladdin: "O my lord the
 Sultan, as I said to thy Highness, an I fail to bring her within the
 term appointed, I will present myself for my head to he stricken off."
 </p><p>  Now when the folk and the lieges all saw Aladdin at liberty, they
 rejoiced with joy exceeding and were delighted for his release, but
 the shame of his treatment and bashfulness before his friends and
 the envious exultation of his foes had bowed down Aladdin's head. So
 he went forth a wandering through the city ways, and he was
 perplexed concerning his case and knew not what had befallen him. He
 lingered about the capital for two days, in saddest state, wotting not
 what to do in order to find his wife and his pavilion, and during this
 time sundry of the folk privily brought him meat and drink. When the
 two days were done, he left the city to stray about the waste and open
 lands outlying the walls, without a notion as to whither he should
 wend. And he walked on aimlessly until the path led him beside a
 river, where, of the stress of sorrow that overwhelmed him, he
 abandoned himself to despair and thought of casting himself into the
 water. Being, however, a good Moslem who professed the unity of the
 Godhead, he feared Allah in his soul, and standing upon the margin, he
 prepared to perform the wuzu ablution.
 </p><p>  But as he was bailing up the water in his right hand and rubbing his
 fingers, it so chanced that he also rubbed the ring. Hereat its
 Marid appeared, and said to him: "Adsum! Thy thrall between thy
 hands is come. Ask of me whatso thou wantest." Seeing the Marid,
 Aladdin rejoiced with exceeding joy and cried: "O Slave, I desire of
 thee that thou bring before me my pavilion and therein my wife, the
 Lady Badr al-Budur, together with all and everything it containeth."
 "O my lord," replied the Marid, "'tis right hard upon me that thou
 demandest a service whereto I may not avail. This matter dependeth
 upon the Slave of the Lamp, nor dare I even attempt it." Aladdin
 rejoined: "Forasmuch as the matter is beyond thy competence, I require
 it not of thee, but at least do thou take me up and set me down beside
 my pavilion in what land soever that may be." The slave exclaimed,
 "Hearing and obeying, O my lord," and uplifting him high in air,
 within the space of an eye glance set him down beside his pavilion
 in the land of Africa, and upon a spot facing his wife's apartment.
 </p><p>  Now this was at fall of night, yet one look enabled him to recognize
 his home, whereby his cark and care were cleared away and he recovered
 trust in Allah after cutting off all his hope to look upon his wife
 once more. Then he fell to pondering the secret and mysterious
 favors of the Lord (glorified he His omnipotence!), and how after
 despair had mastered him the ring had come to gladden him, and how
 when all his hopes were cut off, Allah had deigned bless him with
 the services of its slave. So he rejoiced and his melancholy left him.
 Then, as he had passed four days without sleep for the excess of his
 cark and care and sorrow and stress of thought, he drew near his
 pavilion and slept under a tree hard by the building, which (as we
 mentioned) had been set down amongst the gardens outlying the city
 of Africa. He slumbered till morning showed her face, and when
 awakened by the warbling of the small birds, he arose and went down to
 the bank of the river which flowed thereby into the city, and here
 he again washed hands and face and after finished his wuzu ablution.
 Then he prayed the dawn prayer, and when he had ended his orisons he
 returned and sat down under the windows of the Princess's bower.
 </p><p>  Now the Lady Badr al-Budur, of her exceeding sorrow for severance
 from her husband and her sire, the Sultan, and for the great mishap
 which had happened to her from the Maghrabi, the magician, the
 accursed, was wont to rise during the murk preceding dawn and to sit
 in tears, inasmuch as she could not sleep o' nights and had forsworn
 meat and drink. Her favorite slave girl would enter her chamber at the
 hour of prayer salutation in order to dress her, and this time, by
 decree of Destiny, when she threw open the window to let her lady
 comfort and console herself by looking upon the trees and rills, and
 she herself peered out of the lattice, she caught sight of her
 master sitting below, and informed the Princess of this, saying: "O my
 lady! O my lady! Here's my lord Aladdin seated at the foot of the
 wall!" So her mistress arose hurriedly and gazing from the casement,
 saw him, and her husband, raising his head, saw her, so she saluted
 him and he saluted her, both being like to fly for joy. Presently
 quoth she, "Up and come in to me by the private postern, for now the
 accursed is not here," and she gave orders to the slave girl, who went
 down and opened for him. Then Aladdin passed through it and was met by
 his wife, when they embraced and exchanged kisses with all delight
 until they wept for overjoy.
 </p><p>  After this they sat down, and Aladdin said to her: "O my lady,
 before all things 'tis my desire to ask thee a question. 'Twas my wont
 to place an old copper lamp in such a part of my pavilion. What became
 of that same?" When the Princess heard these words, she sighed and
 cried, "O my dearling, 'twas that very lamp which garred us fall
 into this calamity!" Aladdin asked her, "How befell the affair?" and
 she answered by recounting to him all that passed, first and last,
 especially how they had given in exchange an old lamp for a new
 lamp, adding: "And next day we hardly saw one another at dawn before
 we found ourselves in this land, and he who deceived us and took the
 lamp by way of barter informed me that he had done the deed by might
 of his magic and by means of the lamp; that he is a Moorman from
 Africa; and that we are now in his native country."
 </p><p>  When the Lady Badr al-Budur ceased speaking, Aladdin resumed:
 "Tell me the intent of this accursed in thy respect, also what he
 sayeth to thee and what he his will of thee." She replied: "Every
 day he cometh to visit me once and no more. He would woo me to his
 love, and he sueth that I take him to spouse in lieu of thee and
 that I forget thee and he consoled for the loss of thee. And he
 telleth me that the Sultan, my sire, hath cut off my husband's head,
 adding that thou, the son of pauper parents, wast by him enriched. And
 he sootheth me with talk, but he never seeth aught from me save
 weeping and wailing, nor hath he heard from me one sugar-sweet
 word." Quoth Aladdin: "Tell me where he hath placed the lamp, an
 thou know anything thereof," and quoth she: "He beareth it about on
 his body alway, nor is it possible that he leave it for a single hour.
 Moreover, once when he related what I have now recounted to thee, he
 brought it out of his breast pocket and allowed me to look upon it."
 When Aladdin heard these words, he joyed with exceeding joy and
 said: "O my lady, do thou lend ear to me. 'Tis my design to go from
 thee forthright and to return only after doffing this my dress, so
 wonder not when thou see me changed, but direct one of thy women to
 stand by the private postern alway, and whenever she espy me coming,
 at once to open. And now I will devise a device whereby to slay this
 damned loon."
 </p><p>  Herewith he arose and, issuing from the pavilion door, walked till
 he met on the way a fellah, to whom he said, "O man, take my attire
 and give me thy garments." But the peasant refused, so Aladdin
 stripped him of his dress perforce and donned it, leaving to the man
 his own rich gear by way of gift. Then he followed the highway leading
 to the neighboring city and entering it, went to the perfumers'
 bazaar, where he bought of one some rarely potent bhang, the son of
 a minute, paying two dinars for two drachms thereof, and he returned
 in disguise by the same road till he reached the pavilion. Here the
 slave girl opened to him the private postern, wherethrough he went
 in to the Lady Badr al-Budur, and said: "Hear me! I desire of thee
 that thou dress and dight thyself in thy best and thou cast off all
 outer show and semblance of care. Also when the accursed, the
 Maghrabi, shall visit thee, do thou receive him with a 'Welcome and
 fair welcome,' and meet him with smiling face and invite him to come
 and sup with thee. Moreover, let him note that thou hast forgotten
 Aladdin, thy beloved, likewise thy father, and that thou hast
 learned to love him with exceeding love, displaying to him all
 manner joy and pleasure. Then ask him for wine, which must be red, and
 pledge him to his secret in a significant draught. And when thou
 hast given him two or three cups full and hast made him wax
 careless, then drop these drops into his cup and fill it up with wine.
 No sooner shall he drink of it than he will fall upon his back
 senseless as one dead." Hearing these words, the Princess exclaimed:
 "'Tis exceedingly sore to me that I do such deed, withal must I do
 it that we escape the defilement of this accursed who tortured me by
 severance from thee and from my sire. Lawful and right therefore is
 the slaughter of this accursed."
 </p><p>  Then Aladdin ate and drank with his wife what hindered his hunger,
 then, rising without stay or delay, fared forth the pavilion. So the
 Lady Badr al-Budur summoned the tirewoman, who robed and arrayed her
 in her finest raiment and adorned her and perfumed her. And as she
 was thus, behold, the accursed Maghrabi entered. He joyed much
 seeing her in such case and yet more when she confronted him, contrary
 to her custom, with a laughing face, and his love longing increased,
 and his desire to have her. Then she took him and, seating him
 beside her, said: "O my dearling, do thou (an thou be willing) come to
 me this night and let us sup together. Sufficient to me hath been my
 sorrow, for were I to sit mourning through a thousand years or even
 two thousand, Aladdin would not return to me from the tomb. And I
 depend upon thy say of yesterday; to wit, that my sire, the Sultan,
 slew him in his stress of sorrow for serverance from me.
 </p><p>  "Nor wonder thou an I have changed this day from what I was
 yesterday, and the reason thereof is I have determined upon taking
 thee to friend and playfellow in lieu of and succession to Aladdin,
 for that now I have none other man but thyself. So I hope for thy
 presence this night, that we may sup together and we may carouse and
 drink somewhat of wine each with other, and especially 'tis my
 desire that thou cause me taste the wine of thy natal soil, the
 African land, because belike 'tis better than aught of the wine of
 China we drink. I have with me some wine, but 'tis the growth of my
 country and I vehemently wish to taste the wine produced by thine."
 </p><p>  When the Maghrabi saw the love lavisht upon him by the Lady Badr
 al-Budur, and noted her change from the sorrowful, melancholy woman
 she was wont to be, he thought that she had cut off her hope of
 Aladdin, and he joyed exceedingly and said to her: "I hear and obey, O
 my lady, whatso thou wishest and all thou biddest. I have at home a
 jar of our country wine, which I have carefully kept and stored deep
 in earth for a space of eight years, and I will now fare and fill from
 it our need and will return to thee in all haste." But the Princess,
 that she might wheedle him the more and yet more, replied: "O my
 darling, go not thou, leaving me alone, but send one of the eunuchs to
 fill for us thereof, and do thou remain sitting beside me, that I
 may find in thee my consolation." He rejoined: "O my lady, none
 wotteth where the jar be buried save myself, nor will I tarry from
 thee." So saying, the Moorman went out, and after a short time he
 brought back as much wine as they wanted, whereupon quoth the Princess
 to him: "Thou hast been at pains and trouble to serve me, and I have
 suffered for thy sake, O my beloved." Quoth he: "On no wise, O eyes of
 me. I hold myself enhonored by thy service."
 </p><p>  Then the Lady Badr al-Budur sat with him at table, and the twain
 fell to eating, and presently the Princess expressed a wish to
 drink, when the handmaid filled her a cup forthright and then
 crowned another for the Moroccan. So she drank to his long life and
 his secret wishes, and he also drank to her life. Then the Princess,
 who was unique in eloquence and delicacy of speech, fell to making a
 cup companion of him and beguiled him by addressing him in the
 sweetest terms of hidden meaning. This was done only that he might
 become more madly enamored of her, but the Maghrabi thought that it
 resulted from her true inclination for him, nor knew that it was a
 snare set up to slay him. So his longing for her increased, and he was
 dying of love for when he saw her address him in such tenderness of
 words and thoughts, and his head began to swim and an the world seemed
 as nothing in his eyes. But when they came to the last of the supper
 and the wine had mastered his brains and the Princess saw this in him,
 she said: "With us there be a custom throughout our country, but I
 know not an it be the usage of yours or not." The Moorman replied,
 "And what may that be?" So she said to him: "At the end of supper each
 lover in turn taketh the cup of the beloved and drinketh it off."
 And at once she crowned one with wine and bade the handmaid carry to
 him her cup, wherein the drink was blended with the bhang.
 </p><p>  Now she had taught the slave girl what to do, and all the
 handmaids and eunuchs in the pavilion longed for the sorcerer's
 slaughter and in that matter were one with the Princess. Accordingly
 the damsel handed him the cup and he, when he heard her words and
 saw her drinking from his cup and passing hers to him and noted all
 that show of love, fancied himself Iskandar, Lord of the Two Horns.
 Then said she to him, the while swaying gracefully to either side
 and putting her hand within his hand: "O my life, here is thy cup with
 me and my cup with thee, and on this wise do lovers drink from each
 other's cups." Then she bussed the brim and drained it to the dregs,
 and again she kissed its lip and offered it to him. Thereat he flew
 for joy and, meaning to do the like, raised her cup to his mouth and
 drank off the whole contents, without considering whether there was
 therein aught harmful or not. And forthright he rolled upon his back
 in deathlike condition and the cup dropped from his grasp, whereupon
 the Lady Badr al-Budur and the slave girls ran hurriedly and opened
 the pavilion door to their lord Aladdin, who, disguised as a fellah,
 entered therein.
 </p><p>  He went up to the apartment of his wife, whom he found still sitting
 at table, and facing her lay the Maghrabi as one slaughtered. So he at
 once drew near to her and kissed her and thanked her for this. Then,
 rejoicing with joy exceeding, he turned to her and said: "Do thou with
 thy handmaids betake thyself to the inner rooms and leave me alone for
 the present, that I may take counsel touching mine affair." The
 Princess hesitated not but went away at once, she and her women.
 Then Aladdin arose, and after locking the door upon them, walked up to
 the Moorman and put forth his hand to his breast pocket and thence
 drew the lamp, after which he unsheathed his sword and slew the
 villain. Presently he rubbed the lamp and the Marid slave appeared and
 said: "Adsum, O my lord! What is it thou wantest?" "I desire of thee,"
 said Aladdin, "that thou take up my pavilion from this country and
 transport it to the land of China and there set it down upon the
 site where it was whilom, fronting the palace of the Sultan." The
 Marid replied, "Hearing and obeying, O my lord."
 </p><p>  Then Aladdin went and sat down with his wife and throwing his arms
 round her neck, kissed her and she kissed him, and they set in
 converse what while the Jinni transported the pavilion and all therein
 to the place appointed. Presently Aladdin bade the handmaids spread
 the table before him, and he and the Lady Badr al-Budur took seat
 thereat and fell to eating and drinking, in all joy and gladness, till
 they had their sufficiency, when, removing to the chamber of wine
 and cup converse, they sat there and caroused in fair companionship
 and each kissed other with all love liesse. The time had been long and
 longsome since they enjoyed aught of pleasure, so they ceased not
 doing, thus until the wine sun arose in their heads and sleep gat hold
 of them, at which time they went to their bed in all ease and comfort.
 Early on the next morning Aladdin woke and awoke his wife, and the
 slave girls came in and donned her dress and prepared her and
 adorned her whilst her husband arrayed himself in his costliest
 raiment, and the twain were ready to fly for joy at reunion after
 parting. Moreover, the Princess was especially joyous and gladsome
 because on that day she expected to see her beloved father.
 </p><p>  Such was the case of Aladdin and the Lady Badr al-Budur, but as
 regards the Sultan, after he drove away his son-in-law he never ceased
 to sorrow for the loss of his daughter, and every hour of every day he
 would sit and weep for her as women weep, because she was his only
 child and he had none other to take to heart. And as he shook off
 sleep morning after morning he would hasten to the window and throw it
 open and peer in the direction where formerly stood Aladdin's pavilion
 and pour forth tears until his eyes were dried up and their lids
 were ulcered. Now on that day he arose at dawn and, according to his
 custom, looked out, when lo and behold! he saw before him an
 edifice, so he rubbed his eyes and considered it curiously, when he
 became certified that it was the pavilion of his son-in-law. So he
 called for a horse without let or delay, and as soon as his beast
 was saddled, he mounted and made for the place, and Aladdin, when he
 saw his father-in-law approaching, went down and met him halfway,
 then, taking his hand, aided him to step upstairs to the apartment
 of his daughter. And the Princess, being as earnestly desirous to
 see her sire, descended and greeted him at the door of the staircase
 fronting the ground-floor hall. Thereupon the King folded her in his
 arms and kissed her, shedding tears of joy, and she did likewise, till
 at last Aladdin led them to the upper saloon, where they took seats
 and the Sultan fell to asking her case and what had betided her.
 </p><p>  The Lady Badr al-Budur began to inform the Sultan of all which had
 befallen her, saying: "O my father, I recovered not life save
 yesterday when I saw my husband, and he it was who freed me from the
 thraldom of that Maghrabi, that magician, that accursed, than whom I
 believe there be none viler on the face of earth. And but for my
 beloved, I had never escaped him, nor hadst thou seen me during the
 rest of my days. But mighty sadness and sorrow gat about me, O my
 father, not only for losing thee but also for the loss of a husband
 under whose kindness I shall be all the length of my life, seeing that
 he freed me from that fulsome sorcerer." Then the Princess began
 repeating to her sire everything that happened to her, and relating to
 him how the Moorman had tricked her in the guise of a lamp-seller
 who offered in exchange new for old, how she had given him the lamp
 whose worth she knew not, and how she had bartered it away only to
 laugh at the lampman's folly.
 </p><p>  "And next morning, O my father," she continued, "we found
 ourselves and whatso the pavilion contained in Africa land, till
 such time as my husband came to us and devised a device whereby we
 escaped. And had it not been for Aladdin's hastening to our aid, the
 accursed was determined to enjoy me perforce." Then she told him of
 the bhang drops administered in wine to the African and concluded:
 "Then my husband returned to me, and how I know not, but we were
 shifted from Africa land to this place." Aladdin in his turn recounted
 how, finding the wizard dead-drunken, he had sent away his wife and
 her women from the poluted place into the inner apartments; how he had
 taken the lamp from the sorcerer's breast pocket, whereto he was
 directed by his wife; how he had slaughtered the villain; and
 finally how, making use of the lamp, he had summoned its slave and
 ordered him to transport the pavilion back to its proper site,
 ending his tale with: "And, if thy Highness have any doubt anent my
 words, arise with me and look upon the accursed magician." The King
 did accordingly and, having considered the Moorman, bade the carcass
 be carried away forthright and burned and its ashes scattered in air.
 </p><p>  Then he took to embracing Aladdin and, kissing him, said: "Pardon
 me, O my son, for that I was about to destroy thy life through the
 foul deeds of this damned enchanter, who cast thee into such pit of
 peril. And I may be excused, O my child, for what I did by thee,
 because I found myself forlorn of my daughter, my only one, who to
 me is dearer than my very kingdom. Thou knowest how the hearts of
 parents yearn unto their offspring, especially when like myself they
 have but one and none other to love." And on this wise the Sultan took
 to excusing himself and kissing his son-in-law. Aladdin said to the
 Sultan: "O King of the time, thou didst naught to me contrary to
 Holy Law, and I also sinned not against thee, but all the trouble came
 from that Maghrabi, the impure, the magician." Thereupon the Sultan
 bade the city be decorated, and they obeyed him and held high feast
 and festivities. He also commanded the crier to cry about the
 streets saying: "This day is a mighty great fate, wherein public
 rejoicings must be held throughout the realm, for a full month of
 thirty days, in honor of the Lady Badr al-Budur and her husband
 Aladdin's return to their home."
 </p><p>  On this wise befell it with Aladdin and the Maghrabi, but withal the
 King's son-in-law escaped not wholly from the accursed, albeit the
 body had been burnt and the ashes scattered in air. For the villain
 had a brother yet more villainous than himself, and a greater adept in
 necromancy, geomancy, and astromancy. And even as the old saw saith,
 "A bean and 'twas split," so each one dwelt in his own quarter of
 the globe that he might fill it with his sorcery, his fraud, and his
 treason. Now one day of the days it fortuned that the Moorman's
 brother would learn how it fared with him, so he brought out his
 sandboard and dotted it and produced the figures which, when he had
 considered and carefully studied them, gave him to know that the man
 he sought was dead and housed in the tomb. So he grieved and was
 certified of his disease, but he dotted a second time seeking to learn
 the manner of the death and where it bad taken place. So he found that
 the site was the China land and that the mode was the foulest of
 slaughter. Furthermore, that he who did him die was a young man
 Aladdin hight. Seeing this, he straightway arose and equipped
 himself for wayfare, then he set out and cut across the wilds and
 wolds and heights for the space of many a month until he reached China
 and the capital of the Sultan wherein was the slayer of his brother.
 </p><p>  He alighted at the so-called strangers' khan and, hiring himself a
 cell, took rest therein for a while, then he fared forth and
 wandered about the highways that he might discern some path which
 would aid him unto the winning of his ill-minded wish; to wit, of
 wreaking upon Aladdin blood revenge for his brother. Presently he
 entered a coffeehouse, a fine building which stood in the market place
 and which collected a throng of folk to play, some at the mankalah,
 others at the backgammon, and others at the chess and what not else.
 There he sat down and listened to those seated beside him, and they
 chanced to be conversing about an ancient dame and a holy, by name
 Fatimah, who dwelt away at her devotions in a hermitage without the
 town, and this she never entered save only two days each month. They
 mentioned also that she had performed many saintly miracles, which
 when the Maghrabi, the necromancer, heard he said in himself: "Now
 have I found that which I sought. Inshallah- God willing- by means of
 this crone will I will to my wish."
 </p><p>  The necromancer went up to the folk who were talking of the miracles
 performed by the devout old woman and said to one of them: "O my
 uncle, I heard you an chatting about the prodigies of a certain
 saintess named Fatimah. Who is she, and where may be her abode?"
 "Marvelous!" exclaimed the man. "How canst thou be in our city and yet
 never have heard about the miracles of the Lady Fatimah? Evidently,
 O thou poor fellow, thou art a foreigner, since the fastings of this
 devotee and her asceticism in worldly matters and the beauties of
 her piety never came to thine ears." The Moorman rejoined: "'Tis true,
 O my lord. Yes, I am a stranger, and came to this your city only
 yesternight. And I hope thou wilt inform me concerning the saintly
 miracles of this virtuous woman and where may be her wone, for that
 I have fallen into a calamity, and 'tis my wish to visit her and crave
 her prayers, so haply Allah (to Whom be honor and glory!) will,
 through her blessings, deliver me from mine evil." Hereat the man
 recounted to him the marvels of Fatimah, the devotee, and her piety
 and the beauties of her worship, then, taking him by the hand, went
 with him without the city and showed him the way to her abode, a
 cavern upon a hillock's head. The necromancer acknowledged his
 kindness in many words and, thanking him for his good offices,
 returned to his cell in the caravanserai.
 </p><p>  Now by the fiat of Fate on the very next day Fatimah came down to
 the city, and the Maghrabi, the necromancer, happened to leave his
 hostelry a-morn, when he saw the folk swarming and crowding. Wherefore
 he went up to discover what was to do, and found the devotee
 standing a-middlemost the throng, and all who suffered from pain or
 sickness flocked to her soliciting a blessing, and praying for her
 prayers, and each and every she touched became whole of his illness.
 The Moroccan, the necromancer, followed her about until she returned
 to her antre. Then, awaiting till the evening evened, he arose and
 repaired to a vintner's store, where he drank a cup of wine. After
 this he fared forth the city, and finding the devotee's cavern,
 entered it and saw her lying prostrate with her back upon a strip of
 matting. So he came forward and mounted upon her belly, then he drew
 his dagger and shouted at her, and when she awoke and opened her eyes,
 she espied a Moorish man with an unsheathed poniard sitting upon her
 middle as though about to kill her.
 </p><p>  She was troubled and sore terrified, but he said to her: "Hearken!
 And thou cry out or utter a word, I will slay thee at this very
 moment. Arise now and do all I bid thee." Then he sware to her an oath
 that if she obeyed his orders, whatever they might be, he would not do
 her die. So saying, he rose up from off her and Fatimah also arose,
 when he said to her, "Give me thy gear and take thou my habit,"
 whereupon she gave him her clothing and head fillets, her face
 kerchief and her mantilla. Then quoth he, "'Tis also requisite that
 thou anoint me with somewhat shall make the color of my face like unto
 thine." Accordingly she went into the inner cavern, and bringing out a
 gallipot of ointment, spread somewhat thereof upon her palm and with
 it besmeared his face until its hue favored her own. Then she gave him
 her staff and, showing him how to walk and what to do when he
 entered the city, hung her rosary around his neck. Lastly she handed
 to him a mirror and said, "Now look! Thou differest from me in
 naught," and he saw himself Fatimah's counterpart as thou she had
 never gone or come. But after obtaining his every object he falsed his
 oath and asked for a cord, which she brought to him. Then he seized
 her and strangled her in the cavern, and presently, when she was dead,
 haled the corpse outside and threw it into a pit hard by and went back
 to sleep in her cavern. And when broke the day, he rose, and repairing
 to the town, took his stand under the walls of Aladdin's pavilion.
 </p><p>  Hereupon flocked the folk about him, all being certified that he was
 Fatimah, the devotee, and he fell to doing whatso she was wont to
 do. He laid hands on these in pain and recited for those a chapter
 of the Koran and made orisons for a third. Presently the thronging
 of the folk and the clamoring of the crowd were heard by the Lady Badr
 al-Budur, who said to her handmaidens. "Look what is to do, and what
 he the cause of this turmoil!" Thereupon the aga of the eunuchry fared
 forth to see what might be the matter and, presently returning,
 said: "O my lady, this clamor is caused by the Lady Fatimah, and if
 thou be pleased to command, I will bring her to thee. So shalt thou
 gain through her a blessing." The Princess answered: "Go bring her,
 for since many a day I am always hearing of her miracles and her
 virtues, and I do long to see her and get a blessing by her
 intervention, for the folk recount her manifestations in many cases of
 difficulty."
 </p><p>  The aga went forth and brought in the Moroccan, the necromancer,
 habited in Fatimah's clothing, and when the wizard stood before the
 Lady Badr al-Budur, he began at first sight to bless her with a string
 of prayers, nor did any one of those present doubt at all but that
 he was the devotee herself. The Princess arose and salaamed to him,
 then, seating him beside her, said: "O my Lady Fatimah, 'tis my desire
 that thou abide with me alway, so might I be blessed through thee, and
 also learn of thee the paths of worship and piety and follow thine
 example making for salvation." Now all this was a foul deceit of the
 accursed African, and he designed furthermore to complete his guile,
 so he continued: "O my Lady, I am a poor woman and a religious that
 dwelleth in the desert, and the like of me deserveth not to abide in
 the palaces of the kings." But the Princess replied: "Have no care
 whatever, O my Lady Fatimah. I will set apart for thee an apartment of
 my pavilion that thou mayest worship therein, and none shall ever come
 to trouble thee. Also thou shalt avail to worship Allah in my place
 better than in thy cavern." The Moroccan rejoined: "Hearkening and
 obedience, O my lady. I will not oppose thine order, for that the
 commands of the children of the kings may not be gainsaid nor
 renounced. Only I hope of thee that my eating and my drinking and
 sitting may be within my own chamber, which shall be kept wholly
 private. Nor do I require or desire the delicacies of diet, but do
 thou favor me by sending thy handmaid every day with a bit of bread
 and a sup of water, and, when I feel fain of food, let me eat by
 myself in my own room."
 </p><p>  Now the accursed hereby purposed to avert the danger of haply
 raising his face kerchief at mealtimes, when his intent might be
 baffled by his beard and mustachios discovering him to be a man. The
 Princess replied: "O my Lady Fatimah, be of good heart, naught shall
 happen save what thou wishest. But now arise and let me show thee
 the apartment in the palace which I would prepare for thy sojourn with
 us." The Lady Badr al-Budur arose, and taking the necromancer who
 had disguised himself as the devotee, ushered him in to the place
 which she had kindly promised him for a home, and said: "O my Lady
 Fatimah, here thou shalt dwell with every comfort about thee and in
 all privacy and repose, and the place shall be named after thy
 name." Whereupon the Maghrabi acknowledged her kindness and prayed for
 her. Then the Princess showed him the jalousies and the jeweled
 kiosque with its four and twenty windows, and said to him, "What
 thinkest thou, O my Lady Fatimah, of this marvelous pavilion?" The
 Moorman replied: "By Allah, O my daughter, 'tis indeed passing fine
 and wondrous exceedingly, nor do I deem that its fellow is to be found
 in the whole universe. But alas for the lack of one thing which
 would enhance its beauty and decoration!" The Princess asked her: "O
 my Lady Fatimah, what lacketh it, and what be this thing would add
 to its adornment? Tell me thereof, inasmuch as I was wont to believe
 it wholly perfect." The Moroccan answered: "O my lady, all it
 wanteth is that there he hanging from the middle of the dome the egg
 of a fowl called the roc, and were this done, the pavilion would
 lack its peer all the world over." The Princess asked, "What he this
 bird, and where can we find her egg?" and the Moroccan answered, "O my
 lady, the roc is indeed a giant fowl which carrieth off camels and
 elephants in her pounces and flieth away with them, such is her
 stature and strength. Also this fowl is mostly found in Mount Kaf, and
 the architect who built this pavilion is able to bring thee one of her
 eggs."
 </p><p>  They then left such talk, as it was the hour for the noonday meal,
 and when the handmaid had spread the table, the Lady Badr alBudur sent
 down to invite the accursed African to eat with her. But he accepted
 not, and for a reason he would on no wise consent- nay, he rose and
 retired to the room which the Princess had assigned to him and whither
 the slave girls carried his dinner. Now when evening evened, Aladdin
 returned from the chase and met his wife, who salaamed to him, and
 he clasped her to his bosom and kissed her. Presently, looking at
 her face, he saw thereon a shade of sadness, and he noted that,
 contrary to her custom, she did not laugh, so he asked her: "What hath
 betided thee, O my dearling? Tell me, hath aught happened to trouble
 thy thoughts?" "Nothing whatever," answered she. "But, O my beloved, I
 fancied that our pavilion lacked naught at all. However, O eyes of me,
 O Aladdin, were the dome of the upper story hung with an egg of the
 fowl called roc, there would be naught like it in the universe." Her
 husband rejoined: "And for this trifle thou art saddened, when 'tis
 the easiest of all matters to me! So cheer thyself, and whatever
 thou wantest, 'tis enough thou inform me thereof, and I will bring
 it from the abysses of the earth in the quickest time and at the
 earliest hour."
 </p><p>  Aladdin, after refreshing the spirits of his Princess by promising
 her all she could desire, repaired straightway to his chamber and
 taking the lamp, rubbed it, when the Marid appeared without let or
 delay saying, "Ask whatso thou wantest." Said the other: "I desire
 thee to fetch me an egg of the bird roc, and do thou hang it to the
 dome crown of this my pavilion." But when the Marid heard these words,
 his face waxed fierce and he shouted with a mighty loud voice and a
 frightful, and cried: "O denier of kindly deeds, sufficeth it not
 for thee that I and all the Slaves of the Lamp are ever at thy
 service, but thou must also require me to bring thee our Liege Lady
 for thy pleasure, and hang her up at thy pavilion dome for the
 enjoyment of thee and thy wife? Now, by Allah, ye deserve, thou and
 she, that I reduce you to ashes this very moment and scatter you
 upon the air. But inasmuch as ye twain be ignorant of this matter,
 unknowing its inner from its outer significance, I will pardon you,
 for indeed ye are but innocents. The offense cometh from that accursed
 necromancer, brother to the Maghrabi, the magician, who abideth here
 representing himself to be Fatimah, the devotee, after assuming her
 dress and belongings and murthering her in the cavern. Indeed he
 came hither seeking to slay thee by way of blood revenge for his
 brother, and 'tis he who taught thy wife to require this matter of
 me."
 </p><p>  So saying, the Marid evanished. But when Aladdin heard these
 words, his wits fled his head and his joints trembled at the Marid's
 terrible shout. But he empowered his purpose and, arising
 forthright, issued from his chamber and went into his wife's. There he
 affected an ache of head, for that he knew how famous was Fatimah
 for the art and mystery of healing all such pains. And when the Lady
 Badr alBudur saw him sitting hand to head and complaining of unease,
 she asked him the cause and he answered, "I know of none other save
 that my head acheth exceedingly." Hereupon she straightway bade summon
 Fatimah, that the devotee might impose her hand upon his head, and
 Aladdin asked her, "Who may this Fatimah be?" So she informed him that
 it was Fatimah, the devotee, to whom she had given a home in the
 pavilion. Meanwhile the slave girls had fared forth and summoned the
 Maghrabi, and when the accursed made act of presence, Aladdin rose
 up to him and, acting like one who knew naught of his purpose,
 salaamed to him as though he had been the real Fatimah and, kissing
 the hem of his sleeve, welcomed him and entreated him with honor,
 and said: "O my Lady Fatimah, I hope thou wilt bless me with a boon,
 for well I wot thy practice in the healing of pains. I have gotten a
 mighty ache in my head." The Moorman, the accursed, could hardly
 believe that he heard such words, this being all that he desired.
 The necromancer, habited as Fatimah, the devotee, came up to Aladdin
 that he might place hand upon his head and heal his ache. So he
 imposed one hand and, putting forth the other under his gown, drew a
 dagger wherewith to slay him. But Aladdin watched him and, taking
 patience till he had wholly unsheathed the weapon, seized him with a
 forceful grip and, wrenching the dagger from his grasp, plunged it
 deep into his heart.
 </p><p>  When the Lady Badr al-Budur saw him do on this wise, she shrieked
 and cried out: "What hath this virtuous and holy woman done that
 thou hast charged thy neck with the heavy burthen of her blood shed
 wrongfully? Hast thou no fear of Allah that thou killest Fatimah, this
 saintly woman, whose miracles are far-famed?" "No," replied Aladdin,
 "I have not killed Fatimah. I have slain only Fatimah's slayer, he
 that is the brother of the Maghrabi, the accursed, the magician, who
 carried thee off by his black art and transported my pavilion to the
 Africa land. And this damnable brother of his came to our city and
 wrought these wiles, murthering Fatimah and assuming her habit, only
 that he might avenge upon me his brother's blood. And he also 'twas
 who taught thee to require of me a roc's egg, that my death might
 result from such requirement. But an thou doubt my speech, come
 forward and consider the person I have slain." Thereupon Aladdin
 drew aside the Moorman's face kerchief and the Lady Badr al-Budur
 saw the semblance of a man with a full heard that well-nigh covered
 his features.
 </p><p>  She at once knew the truth, and said to her husband, "O my
 beloved, twice have I cast thee into death risk!" But he rejoined: "No
 harm in that, O my lady. By the blessing of your loving eyes, I accept
 with all joy all things thou bringest me." The Princess, hearing these
 words, hastened to fold him in her arms and kissed him, saying: "O
 my dearling, all this is for my love to thee and I knew naught
 thereof, but indeed I do not deem lightly of thine affection." So
 Aladdin kissed her and strained her to his breast, and the love
 between them waxed but greater. At that moment the Sultan appeared,
 and they told him all that had happened, showing him the corpse of the
 Maghrabi, the necromancer, when the King commanded the body to be
 burned and the ashes scattered on air, even as had befallen the
 wizard's brother.
 </p><p>  And Aladdin abode with his wife, the Lady Badr al-Budur, in all
 pleasure and joyaunce of life, and thenceforward escaped every danger,
 and after a while, when the Sultan deceased, his son-in-law was seated
 upon the throne of the kingdom. And he commanded and dealt justice
 to the lieges so that all the folk loved him, and he lived with his
 wife in all solace and happiness until there came to him the Destroyer
 of delights and the Severer of societies.
