 <center><h1>                   THE SLEEPER AND THE WAKER
 </h1></center><p>  IT hath reached me, O auspicious King, that there was once at
 Baghdad, in the caliphate of Harun al-Rashid, a man and a merchant who
 had a son Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a by name. The merchant died leaving
 great store of wealth to his heir, who divided it into two equal
 parts, whereof he laid up one and spent of the other half. And he fell
 to companying with Persians and with the sons of the merchants, and he
 gave himself up to good drinking and good eating till all the wealth
 he had with him was wasted and wantoned. Whereupon he betook himself
 to his friends and comrades and cup companions and expounded to them
 his case, discovering to them the failure of that which was in his
 hand of wealth. But not one of them took heed of him or even deigned
 answer him.
 </p><p>  So he returned to his mother (and indeed his spirit was broken)
 and related to her that which had happened to him and what had
 befallen him from his friends, how they had neither shared with him
 nor requited him with speech. Quoth she: "O Abu al-Hasan, on this wise
 are the sons of this time: And thou have aught, they draw thee near to
 them, and if thou have naught, they put thee away from them." And
 she went on to condole with him, what while he bewailed himself and
 his tears flowed and he repeated these lines:
 </p><p>     "An wane my wealth, no man will succor me,
 <br>     When my wealth waxeth all men friendly show.
 <br>     How many a friend for wealth showed friendliness
 <br>     Who, when my wealth departed, turned to foe!"
 <br></p><p>  Then he sprang up, and going to the place wherein was the other half
 of his goods, took it and lived with it well. And he sware that he
 would never again consort with a single one of those he had known, but
 would company only with the stranger, nor entertain even him but one
 night, and that when it morrowed, he would never know him more.
 Accordingly he fell to sitting every eventide on the bridge over
 Tigris and looking at each one who passed by him. And if he saw him to
 be a stranger, he made friends with him and carried him to his
 house, where he conversed and caroused with him all night till
 morning. Then he dismissed him, and would never more salute him with
 the salaam nor ever more drew near unto him, neither invited him
 again.
 </p><p>  Thus he continued to do for the space of a full year, till one day
 while he sat on the bridge, as was his wont, expecting who should come
 to him so he might take him and pass the night with him, behold, up
 came the Caliph and Masrur, the Sworder of his vengeance, disguised in
 merchants' dress, according to their custom. So Abu al-Hasan looked at
 them, and rising, because he knew them not, asked them: "What say
 ye? Will ye go with me to my dwelling place, so ye may eat what is
 ready and drink what is at hand; to wit, platter bread and meat cooked
 and wine strained?" The Caliph refused this, but he conjured him and
 said to him: "Allah upon thee, O my lord. Go with me, for thou art
 my guest this night, and balk not my hopes of thee!" And he ceased not
 to press him till he consented, whereat Abu al-Hasan rejoiced, and
 walking on before him, gave not over talking with him till they came
 to his house and he carried the Caliph into the saloon.
 </p><p>  Al-Rashid entered a hall such as an thou sawest it and gazedst
 upon its walls, thou hadst beheld marvels, and hadst thou looked
 narrowly at its water conduits, thou wouldst have seen a fountain
 cased with gold. The Caliph made his man abide at the door, and as
 soon as he was seated, the host brought him somewhat to eat. So he
 ate, and Abu al-Hasan ate with him, that eating might be grateful to
 him. Then he removed the tray and they washed their hands and the
 Commander of the Faithful sat down again. Whereupon Abu al-Hasan set
 on the drinking vessels, and seating himself by his side, fell to
 filling and giving him to drink and entertaining him with discourse.
 And when they had drunk their sufficiency the host called for a
 slave girl like a branch of ban, who took a lute and sang to it
 these two couplets:
 </p><p>      "O thou aye dwelling in my heart,
 <br>      Whileas thy form is far from sight,
 <br>      Thou art my sprite by me unseen,
 <br>      Yet nearest near art thou, my sprite."
 <br></p><p>  His hospitality pleased the Caliph, and the goodliness of his
 manners, and he said to him: "O youth, who art thou? Make me
 acquainted with thyself, so I may requite thee thy kindness." But
 Abu al-Hasan smiled and said: 'O my lord, far be it, alas! that what
 is past should again come to pass and that I company with thee at
 other time than this time!" The Prince of True Believers asked: "Why
 so? And why wilt thou not acquaint me with thy case?" and Abu al-Hasan
 answered, "Know, O my lord, that my story is strange and that there is
 a cause for this affair." Quoth Al-Rashid, "And what is the cause?"
 and quoth he, "The cause hath a tail." The Caliph laughed at his words
 and Abu al-Hasan said, "I will explain to thee this saying by the tale
 of the larrikin and the cook. So hear thou, O my lord, the
