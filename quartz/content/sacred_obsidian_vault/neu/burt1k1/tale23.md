 <center><h1>            THE SIXTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN
 </h1></center><p>  KNOW, O my brothers and friends and companions all, that I abode
 some time, after my return from my fifth voyage, in great solace and
 satisfaction and mirth and merriment, joyance and enjoyment, and I
 forgot what I had suffered, seeing the great gain and profit I had
 made, till one day as I sat making merry and enjoying myself with my
 friends, there came in to me a company of merchants whose case told
 tales of travel, and talked with me of voyage and adventure and
 greatness of pelf and lucre. Hereupon I remembered the days of my
 return abroad, and my joy at once more seeing my native land and
 forgathering with my family and friends, and my soul yearned for
 travel and traffic. So, compelled by Fate and Fortune, I resolved to
 undertake another voyage, and, buying me fine and costly merchandise
 meet for foreign trade, made it up into bales, with which I
 journeyed from Baghdad to Bassorah.
 </p><p>  Here I found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and
 notables, who had with them goods of price, so I embarked my bales
 therein. And we left Bassorah in safety and good spirits under the
 safeguard of the King, the Preserver, and continued our voyage from
 place to place and from city to city, buying and selling and profiting
 and diverting ourselves with the sight of countries where strange folk
 dwell. And Fortune and the voyage smiled upon us till one day, as we
 went along, behold, the captain suddenly cried with a great cry and
 cast his turban on the deck. Then he buffeted his face like a woman
 and plucked out his beard and fell down in the waist of the ship
 well-nigh fainting for stress of grief and rage, and crying, "Oh,
 and alas for the ruin of my house and the orphanship of my poor
 children!" So all the merchants and sailors came round about him and
 asked him, "O master, what is the matter?" For the light had become
 night before, their sight. And he answered, saying: "Know, O folk,
 that we have wandered from our course and left the sea whose ways we
 wot, and come into a sea whose ways I know not, and unless Allah
 vouchsafe us a means of escape, we are all dead men. Wherefore pray ye
 to the Most High that He deliver us from this strait. Haply amongst
 you is one righteous whose prayers the Lord will accept." Then he
 arose and clomb the mast to see an there were any escape from that
 strait. And he would have loosed the sails, but the wind redoubled
 upon the ship and whirled her round thrice and drave her backward,
 whereupon her rudder brake and she fell off toward a high mountain.
 </p><p>  With this the captain came down from the mast, saying: "There is
 no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
 Great, nor can man prevent that which is foreordained of Fate! By
 Allah, we are fallen on a place of sure destruction, and there is no
 way of escape for us, nor can any of us be saved!" Then we all fill
 a-weeping over ourselves and bidding one another farewell for that our
 days were come to an end, and we had lost an hopes of life.
 Presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up, and all and
 everything on board of her were plunged into the sea. Some of the
 merchants were drowned and others made shift to reach the shore and
 save themselves upon the mountain, I amongst the number. And when we
 got ashore, we found a great island, or rather peninsula, whose base
 was strewn with wreckage and crafts and goods and gear cast up by
 the sea from broken ships whose passengers had been drowned, and the
 quantity confounded count and calculation. So I climbed the cliffs
 into the inward of the isle and walked on inland till I came to a
 stream of sweet water that welled up at the nearest foot of the
 mountains and disappeared in the earth under the range of hills on the
 opposite side. But all the other passengers went over the mountains to
 the inner tracts, and, dispersing hither and thither, were
 confounded at what they saw and became like madmen at the sight of the
 wealth and treasures wherewith the shores were strewn.
 </p><p>  As for me, I looked into the bed of the stream aforesaid and saw
 therein great plenty of rubies, and great royal pearls and all kinds
 of jewels and precious stones, which were as gravel in the bed of
 the rivulets that ran through the fields, and the sands sparkled and
 glittered with gems and precious ores. Moreover, we found in the
 island abundance of the finest lign aloes, both Chinese and Comorin.
 And there also is a spring of crude ambergris, which floweth like
 wax or gum over the stream banks, for the great heat of the sun, and
 runneth down to the seashore, where the monsters of the deep come up
 and, swallowing it, return into the sea. But it burneth in their
 bellies, so they cast it up again and it congealeth on the surface
 of the water, whereby its color and quantities are changed, and at
 last the waves cast it ashore, and the travelers and merchants who
 know it collect it and sell it. But as to the raw ambergris which is
 not swallowed, it floweth over the channel and congealeth on the
 banks, and when the sun shineth on it, it melteth and scenteth the
 whole valley with a musk-like fragrance. Then when the sun ceaseth
 from it, it congealeth again. But none can get to this place where
 is the crude ambergris, because of the mountains which enclose the
 island on all sides and which foot of man cannot ascend.
 </p><p>  We continued thus to explore the island, marveling at the
 wonderful works of Allah and the riches we found there, but sore
 troubled for our own case, and dismayed at our prospects. Now we had
 picked up on the beach some small matter of victual from the wreck and
 husbanded it carefully eating but once every day or two, in our fear
 lest it should fail us and we die miserably of famine and affright.
 Moreover, we were weak for colic brought on by seasickness and low
 diet, and my companions deceased, one after other, till there was
 but a small company of us left. Each that died we washed and
 shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides,
 and after a little, the rest of my fellows perished one by one, till I
 had buried the last of the party and abode alone on the island, with
 but a little provision left, I who was wont to have so much. And I
 wept over myself, saying: "Would Heaven I had died before my
 companions and they had washed me and buried me! It had been better
 than I should perish and none wash me and shroud me and bury me. But
 there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the glorious,
 the Great!" Now after I had buried the last of my party and abode
 alone on the island, I arose and dug me a deep grave on the
 seashore, saying to myself: "Whenas I grow weak and know that death
 cometh to me, I will cast myself into the grave and die there, so
 the wind may drift the sand over me and cover me and I be buried
 therein."
 </p><p>  Then I fell to reproaching myself for my little wit in leaving my
 native land and betaking me again to travel after all I had suffered
 during my first five voyages, and when I had not made a single one
 without suffering more horrible perils and more terrible hardships
 than in its forerunners, and having no hope of escape from my
 present stress. And I repented me of my folly and bemoaned myself,
 especially as I had no need of money, seeing that I had enough and
 could not spend what I had- no, nor a half of it in all my life.
 However, after a while Allah sent me a thought, and I said to
 myself: "By God, needs must this stream have an end as well as a
 beginning, ergo an issue somewhere, and belike its course may lead
 to some inhabited place. So my best plan is to make me a little boat
 big enough to sit in, and carry it and, launching it on the river,
 embark therein and drop down the stream. If I escape, I escape, by
 God's leave, and if I perish, better die in the river than here."
 Then, sighing for myself, I set to work collecting a number of
 pieces of Chinese and Comorin aloes wood and I bound them together
 with ropes from the wreckage. Then I chose out from the broken-up
 ships straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the
 aloes wood, making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel
 of the stream, and I tied it tightly and firmly as though it were
 nailed. Then I loaded it with the goods, precious ores and jewels, and
 the union pearls which were like gravel, and the best of the ambergris
 crude and pure, together with what I had collected on the island and
 what was left me of victual and wild herbs. Lastly I lashed a piece of
 wood on either side, to serve me as oars, and launched it, and
 embarking, did according to the saying of the poet:
 </p><p>     Fly, fly with life whenas evils threat,
 <br>     Leave the house to tell of its builder's fate!
 <br>     Land after land shalt thou seek and find,
 <br>     But no other life on thy wish shall wait.
 <br>     Fret not thy soul in thy thoughts o' night,
 <br>     All woes shall end or sooner or late.
 <br>     Whoso is born in one land to die,
 <br>     There and only there shall gang his pit.
 <br>     Nor trust great things to another wight,
 <br>     Soul hath only soul for confederate.
 <br></p><p>  My boat raft drifted with the stream, I pondering the issue of my
 affair, and the drifting ceased not till I came to the place where
 it disappeared beneath the mountain. I rowed my conveyance into the
 place, which was intensely dark, and the current carried the raft with
 it down the underground channel. The thin stream bore me on through
 a narrow tunnel where the raft touched either side and my head
 rubbed against the roof, return therefrom being impossible. Then I
 blamed myself for having thus risked my life, and said, "If this
 passage grow any straiter, the raft will hardly pass, and I cannot
 turn back, so I shall inevitably perish miserably in this place." And
 I threw myself down upon my face on the raft, by reason of the
 narrowness of the channel, whilst the stream ceased not to carry me
 along, knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which
 encompassed me about and my terror and concern for myself lest I
 should perish. And in such condition my course continued down the
 channel, which now grew wider and then straiter. Sore a-weary by
 reason of the darkness which could be felt, I feel asleep as I lay
 prone on the craft, and I slept knowing not an the time were long or
 short.
 </p><p>  When I awoke at last, I found myself in the light of Heaven and
 opening my eyes, I saw myself in a broad of the stream and the raft
 moored to an island in the midst of a number of Indians and
 Abyssinians. As soon as these blackamoors saw that I was awake, they
 came up to me and bespoke me in their speech. But I understood not
 what they said and thought that this was a dream and a vision which
 had betided me for stress of concern and chagrin. But I was
 delighted at my escape from the river. When they saw I understood them
 not and made them no answer, one of them came forward and said to me
 in Arabic: "Peace be with thee, O my brother! Who art thou, and whence
 faredst thou hither? How camest thou into this river, and what
 manner of land lies behind yonder mountains, for never knew we
 anyone make his way thence to us?" Quoth I: "And upon thee be peace
 and the ruth of Allah and His blessing! Who are ye, and what country
 is this?" "O my brother," answered he, "we are husbandmen and
 tillers of the soil, who came out to water our fields and plantations,
 and finding thee asleep on this raft, laid hold of it and made it fast
 by us, against thou shouldst awake at thy leisure. So tell us how thou
 camest hither." I answered, "For Allah's sake, O my lord, ere I
 speak give me somewhat to eat, for I am starving, and after ask me
 what thou wilt."
 </p><p>  So he hastened to fetch me food and I ate my fill, till I was
 refreshed and my fear was calmed by a good bellyful and my life
 returned to me. Then I rendered thanks to the Most High for mercies
 great and small, glad to be out of the river and rejoicing to be
 amongst them, and I told them all my adventures from first to last,
 especially my troubles in the narrow channel. They consulted among
 themselves and said to one another, "There is no help for it but we
 carry him with us and present him to our King, that he may acquaint
 him with his adventures." So they took me, together with raft boat and
 its lading of moneys and merchandise, jewels, minerals, and golden
 gear, and brought me to their King, who was King of Sarandib,
 telling him what had happened. Whereupon he saluted me and bade me
 welcome. Then he questioned me of my condition and adventures
 through the man who had spoken Arabic, and I repeated to him my
 story from beginning to end, whereat he marveled exceedingly and
 gave me joy of my deliverance. After which I arose and fetched from
 the raft great store of precious ores and jewels and ambergris and lip
 aloes and presented them to the King, who accepted them and
 entreated me with the utmost honor, appointing me a lodging in his own
 palace. So I consorted with the chief of the islanders, and they
 paid me the utmost respect. And I quitted not the royal palace.
 </p><p>  Now the Island Sarandib lieth under the equinoctial line, its
 night and day both numbering twelve hours. It measureth eighty leagues
 long by a breadth of thirty and its width is bounded by a lofty
 mountain and a deep valley. The mountain is conspicuous from a
 distance of three days, and it containeth many kinds of, rubies and
 other minerals, and spice trees of all sorts. The surface is covered
 with emery, wherewith gems are cut and fashioned; diamonds are in
 its rivers and pearls are in its valleys. I ascended that mountain and
 solaced myself with a view of its marvels, which are indescribable,
 and afterward I returned to the King. Thereupon all the travelers
 and merchants who came to the place questioned me of the affairs of my
 native land and of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid and his rule, and I told
 them of him and of that wherefor he was renowned, and they praised him
 because of this, whilst I in turn questioned them of the manners and
 customs of their own countries and got the knowledge I desired.
 </p><p>  One day the King himself asked me of the fashions and form of
 government of my country, and I acquainted him with the circumstance
 of the Caliph's sway in the city of Baghdad and the justice of his
 rule. The King marveled at my account of his appointments and said:
 "By Allah, the Caliph's ordinances are indeed wise and his fashions of
 praiseworthy guise, and thou hast made me love him by what thou
 tellest me. Wherefore I have a mind to make him a present and send
 it by thee." Quoth I: "Hearkening and obedience, O my lord. I will
 bear thy gift to him and inform him that thou art his sincere lover
 and true friend." Then I abode with the King in great honor and regard
 and consideration for a long while till one day, as I sat in his
 palace, I heard news of a company of merchants that were fitting out
 ship for Bassorah, and said to myself, "I cannot do better than voyage
 with these men." So I rose without stay or delay and kissed the King's
 hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with the merchants,
 for that I pined after my people and mine own land. Quoth he, "Thou
 art thine own master, yet if it be thy will to abide with us, on our
 head and eyes be it, for thou gladdenest us with thy company." "By
 Allah, O my lord," answered I, "thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with
 thy favors and well-doings, but I weary for a sight of my friends
 and family and native country."
 </p><p>  When he heard this, he summoned the merchants in question and
 commended me to their care, paying my freight and passage money.
 Then he bestowed on me great riches from his treasuries and charged me
 with a magnificent present for the Caliph Harun al-Rashid. Moreover,
 he gave me a sealed letter, saying, "Carry this with thine own hand to
 the Commander of the Faithful, and give him many salutations from us!"
 "Hearing and obedience," I replied. The missive was written on the
 skin of the khawi (which is finer than lamb parchment and of yellow
 color), with ink of ultramarine, and the contents were as follows:
 "Peace be with thee from the King of Al-Hind, before whom are a
 thousand elephants and upon whose palace crenelles are a thousand
 jewels. But after (laud to the Lord and praises to His Prophet!) we
 send thee a trifling gift, which be thou pleased to accept. Thou art
 to us a brother and a sincere friend, and great is the love we bear
 for thee in heart. Favor us therefore with a reply. The gift besitteth
 not thy dignity, but we beg of thee, O our brother, graciously to
 accept it, and peace be with thee." And the present was a cup of
 ruby a span high, the inside of which was adorned with precious
 pearls;
 and a bed covered with the skin of the serpent which swalloweth the
 elephant, which skin hath spots each like a dinar and whoso sitteth
 upon it never sickeneth; and a hundred thousand miskals of Indian lign
 aloes and a slave girl like a shining moon.
 </p><p>  Then I took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances
 in the island, and embarked with the merchants aforesaid. We sailed
 with a fair wind, committing ourselves to the care of Allah (be He
 extolled and exalted!), and by His permission arrived at Bassorah,
 where I passed a few days and nights equipping myself and packing up
 my bales. Then I went on to Baghdad city, the House of Peace, where
 I sought an audience of the Caliph and laid the King's presents before
 him. He asked me whence they came, and I said to him, "By Allah, O
 Commander of the Faithful, I know not the name of the city nor the way
 thither!" He then asked me, "O Sindbad, is this true which the King
 writeth?" and I answered, after kissing the ground: "O my lord, I
 saw in his kingdom much more than he hath written in his letter. For
 state processions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant
 eleven cubits high, and upon this he sitteth having his great lords
 and officers and guests standing in two ranks, on his right hand and
 on his left. At his head is a man hending in hand a golden javelin and
 behind him another with a great mace of gold whose head is an
 emerald a span long and as thick as a man's thumb. And when he
 mounteth horse there mount with him a thousand horsemen clad in gold
 brocade and silk, and as the King proceedeth a man precedeth him,
 crying, 'This is the King of great dignity, of high authority!' And he
 continueth to repeat his praises in words I remember not, saying at
 the end of his panegyric, 'This is the King owning the crown whose
 like nor Solomon nor the Mihraj ever possessed.' Then he is silent and
 one behind him proclaimeth, saying, 'He will die! Again I say he
 will die!' and the other addeth, 'Extolled be the perfection of the
 Living who dieth not!' Moreover, by reason of his justice and
 ordinance and intelligence, there is no kazi in his city, and all
 his lieges distinguish between truth and falsehood." Quoth the Caliph:
 "How great is this King! His letter hath shown me this, and as for the
 mightiness of his dominion thou hast told us what thou hast
 eyewitnessed. By Allah, he hath been endowed with wisdom, as with wide
 rule."
 </p><p>  Then I related to the Commander of the Faithful all that had
 befallen me in my last voyage, at which he wondered exceedingly and
 bade his historians record my story and store it up in his treasuries,
 for the edification of all who might see it. Then he conferred on me
 exceeding great favors, and I repaired to my quarter and entered my
 home, where I warehoused all my goods and possessions. Presently my
 friends came to me and I distributed presents among my family and gave
 alms and largess, after which I yielded myself to joyance and
 enjoyment, mirth and merrymaking, and forgot all that I had suffered.
 </p><p>  Such, then, O my brothers, is the history of what befell me in my
 sixth voyage, and tomorrow, Inshallah! I will tell you the story of my
 seventh and last voyage, which is still more wondrous and marvelous
 than that of the first six. (Saith he who telleth the tale): Then be
 bade lay the table, and the company supped with him, after which he
 gave the porter a hundred dinars, as of wont, and they all went
 their ways, marveling beyond measure at that which they had heard.
 Sindbad the Landsman went home and slept as of wont. Next day he
 rose and prayed the dawn prayer and repaired to his namesake's
 house, where, after the company was all assembled, the host began to
 relate
