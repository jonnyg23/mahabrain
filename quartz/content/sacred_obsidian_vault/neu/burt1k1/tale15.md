 <center><h1>                       THE EBONY HORSE
 </h1></center><p>  THERE was once in times of yore and ages long gone before, a great
 and puissant King, of the kings of the Persians, Sabur by name, who
 was the richest of all the kings in store of wealth and dominion and
 surpassed each and every in wit and wisdom. He was generous,
 openhanded and beneficent, and he gave to those who sought him and
 repelled not those who resorted to him, and he comforted the
 brokenhearted and honorably entreated those who fled to him for
 refuge. Moreover, he loved the poor and was hospitable to strangers
 and did the oppressed justice upon the oppressor. He had three
 daughters, like full moons of shining light or flower gardens blooming
 bright, and a son as he were the moon. And it was his wont to keep two
 festivals in the twelvemonth, those of the Nau-Roz, or New Year, and
 Mihrgan, the Autumnal Equinox, on which occasions he threw open his
 palaces and gave largess and made proclamation of safety and
 security and promoted his chamberlains and viceroys. And the people of
 his realm came in to him and saluted him and gave him joy of the
 holy day, bringing him gifts and servants and eunuchs.
 </p><p>  Now he loved science and geometry, and one festival day as he sat on
 his kingly throne there came in to him three wise men, cunning
 artificers and past masters in all manner of craft and inventions,
 skilled in making things curious and rare, such as confound the wit,
 and versed in the knowledge of occult truths and perfect in
 mysteries and subtleties. And they were of three different tongues and
 countries: the first a Hindi or Indian, the second a Roumi or Greek,
 and the third a Farsi or Persian. The Indian came forward and,
 prostrating himself before the King, wished him joy of the festival
 and laid before him a present befitting his dignity; that is to say, a
 man of gold, set with precious gems and jewels of price and hending in
 hand a golden trumpet. When Sabur saw this, he asked, "O sage, what is
 the virtue of this figure?" and the Indian answered: "O my lord, if
 this figure be set at the gate of thy city, it will be a guardian over
 it; for if an enemy enter the place, it will blow this clarion against
 him and he will be seized with a palsy and drop down dead." Much the
 King marveled at this and cried, "By Allah, O sage, an this thy word
 be true, I will grant thee thy wish and thy desire."
 </p><p>  Then came forward the Greek and, prostrating himself before the
 King, presented him with a basin of silver in whose midst was a
 peacock of gold, surrounded by four and twenty chicks of the same
 metal. Sabur looked at them and turning to the Greek, said to him,
 "O sage, what is the virtue of this peacock?" "O my lord," answered
 he, "as often as an hour of the day or night passeth, it pecketh one
 of its young and crieth out and flappeth its wing, till the four and
 twenty hours are accomplished. And when the month cometh to an end, it
 will open its mouth and thou shalt see the crescent therein." And
 the King said, "An thou speak sooth, I will bring thee to thy wish and
 thy desire."
 </p><p>  Then came forward the Persian sage and, prostrating himself before
 the King, presented him with a horse of the blackest ebony wood inlaid
 with gold and jewels, and ready harnessed with saddle, bridle, and
 stirrups such as befit kings, which when Sabur saw, he marveled with
 exceeding marvel and was confounded at the beauty of its form and
 the ingenuity of its fashion. So he asked, "What is the use of this
 horse of wood, and what is its virtue and what the secret of its
 movement?" and the Persian answered, "O my lord, the virtue of this
 horse is that if one mount him, it will carry him whither he will
 and fare with its rider through the air and cover the space of a
 year in a single day."
 </p><p>  The King marveled and was amazed at these three wonders, following
 thus hard upon one another on the same day, and turning to the sage,
 said to him: "By Allah the Omnipotent, and our Lord the Beneficent,
 who created all creatures and feedeth them with meat and drink, an thy
 speech be veritable and the virtue of thy contrivance appear, I will
 assuredly give thee whatsoever thou lustest for and will bring thee to
 thy desire and thy wish!" Then he entertained the sages three days,
 that he might make trial of their gifts, after which they brought
 the figures before him and each took the creature he had wroughten and
 showed him the mystery of its movement. The trumpeter blew the
 trump, the peacock pecked its chicks, and the Persian sage mounted the
 ebony horse, whereupon it soared with him high in air and descended
 again. When King Sabur saw all this, he was amazed and perplexed and
 felt like to fly for joy and said to the three sages: "Now I am
 certified of the truth of your words and it behooveth me to quit me of
 my promise. Ask ye, therefore, what ye will, and I will give you
 that same."
 </p><p>  Now the report of the King's daughters had reached the sages, so
 they answered: "If the King be content with us and accept of our gifts
 and allow us to prefer a request to him, we crave of him that he
 give us his three daughters in marriage, that we may be his
 sons-inlaw, for that the stability of kings may not be gainsaid."
 Quoth the King, "I grant you that which you wish and you desire,"
 and bade summon the kazi forthright, that he might marry each of the
 sages to one of his daughters. Now it fortuned that the Princesses
 were behind a curtain, looking on, and when they heard this, the
 youngest considered her husband-to-be and behold, he was an old man, a
 hundred years of age, with hair frosted, forehead drooping, eyebrows
 mangy, ears slitten, beard and mustachios stained and dyed, eyes red
 and goggle, cheeks bleached and hollow, flabby nose like a brinjall or
 eggplant, face like a cobblees apron, teeth overlapping and lips
 like camel's kidneys, loose and pendulous- in brief, a terror, a
 horror, a monster, for he was of the folk of his time the unsightliest
 and of his age the frightfulest. Sundry of his grinders had been
 knocked out and his eyeteeth were like the tusks of the Jinni who
 frighteneth poultry in henhouses.
 </p><p>  Now the girl was the fairest and most graceful of her time, more
 elegant than the gazelle, however tender, than the gentlest zephyr
 blander, and brighter than the moon at her full, for amorous fray
 right suitable, confounding in graceful sway the waving bough and
 outdoing in swimming gait the pacing roe,- in fine, she was fairer
 and sweeter by far than all her sisters. So when she saw her suitor,
 she went to her chamber and strewed dust on her head and tore her
 clothes and fell to buffeting her face and weeping and walling. Now
 the Prince, her brother, Kamar al-Akmar, or the Moon of Moons hight,
 was then newly returned from a journey and, hearing her weeping and
 crying, came in to her (for he loved her with fond affection, more
 than his other sisters) and asked her: "What aileth thee? What hath
 befallen thee? Tell me, and conceal naught from me." So she smote
 her breast and answered: "O my brother and my dear one, I have nothing
 to hide. If the palace be straitened upon thy father, I will go out,
 and if he be resolved upon a foul thing, I will separate myself from
 him, though he consent not to make provision for me, and my Lord
 will provide." Quoth he, "Tell me what meaneth this talk and what hath
 straitened thy breast and troubled thy temper." "O my brother and my
 dear one," answered the Princess, "know that my father hath promised
 me in marriage to a wicked magician who brought him as a gift a
 horse of black wood, and hath bewitched him with his craft and his
 egromancy. But as for me, I will none of him, and would, because of
 him, I had never come into this world!"
 </p><p>  Her brother soothed her and solaced her, then fared to his sire
 and said: "What be this wizard to whom thou hast given my youngest
 sister in marriage, and what is this present which he hast brought
 thee, so that thou hast killed my sister with chagrin? It is not right
 that this should be." Now the Persian was standing by, and when he
 heard the Prince's words, he was mortified and filled with fury, and
 the King said, "O my son, an thou sawest this horse, thy wit would
 be confounded and thou wouldst be amated with amazement." Then he bade
 the slaves bring the horse before him and they did so, and, when the
 Prince saw it, it pleased him. So (being an accomplished cavalier)
 he mounted it forthright and struck its sides with the shovelshaped
 stirrup irons. But it stirred not, and the King said to the sage,
 "Go show him its movement, that he also may help thee to win thy
 wish."
 </p><p>  Now the Persian bore the Prince a grudge because he willed not he
 should have his sister, so he showed him the pin of ascent on the
 right side of the horse and saying to him, "Trill this," left him.
 Thereupon the Prince trilled the pin and lo! the horse forthwith
 soared with him high in ether, as it were a bird, and gave not over
 flying till it disappeared from men's espying, whereat the King was
 troubled and perplexed about his case and said to the Persian, "O
 Sage, look how thou mayst make him descend." But he replied, "O my
 lord, I can do nothing, and thou wilt never see him again till
 Resurrection Day, for he, of his ignorance and pride, asked me not
 of the pin of descent, and I forgot to acquaint him therewith." When
 the King heard this, he was enraged with sore rage, and bade bastinado
 the sorcerer and clap him in jail, whilst he himself cast the crown
 from his head and beat his face and smote his breast. Moreover, he
 shut the doors of his palaces and gave himself up to weeping and
 keening, he and his wife and daughters and all the folk of the city,
 and thus their joy was turned to annoy and their gladness changed into
 sore affliction and sadness.
 </p><p>  Thus far concerning them, but as regards the Prince, the horse
 gave not over soaring with him till he drew near the sun, whereat he
 gave himself up for lost and saw death in the sides, and was
 confounded at his case, repenting him of having mounted the horse
 and saying to himself: "Verily, this was a device of the sage to
 destroy me on account of my youngest sister. But there is no Majesty
 and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I am
 lost without recourse, but I wonder, did not he who made the ascent
 pin make also a descent pin?" Now he was a man of wit and knowledge
 and intelligence, so he fell to feeling all the parts of the horse,
 but saw nothing save a screw like a cock's head on its right
 shoulder and the like on the left, when quoth he to himself, "I see no
 sip save these things like button."
 </p><p>  Presently he turned the right-hand pin, whereupon the horse flew
 heavenward with increased speed. So he left it, and looking at the
 sinister shoulder and finding another pin, he wound it up and
 immediately the steed's upward motion slowed and ceased and it began
 to descend, little by little, toward the face of the earth, while
 the rider became yet more cautious and careful of his life. And when
 he saw this and knew the uses of the horse, his heart was filled
 with joy and gladness and he thanked Almighty Allah for that He had
 deigned deliver him from destruction. Then he began to turn the
 horse's head whithersoever he would, making it rise and fall at
 pleasure, till he had gotten complete mastery over its every movement.
 He ceased not to descend the whole of that day, for that the steed's
 ascending flight had borne him afar from the earth, and as he
 descended, he diverted himself with viewing the various cities and
 countries over which he passed and which he knew not, never having
 seen them in his life.
 </p><p>  Amongst the rest, he decried a city ordered after the fairest
 fashion in the midst of a verdant and riant land, rich in trees and
 streams, with gazelles pacing daintily over the plains, whereat he
 fell a-musing and said to himself, "Would I knew the name of yon
 town and in what land it is!" And he took to circling about it and
 observing it right and left. By this time, the day began to decline
 and the sun drew near to its downing, and he said in his mind, "Verily
 I find no goodlier place to night in than this city, so I will lodge
 here, and early on the morrow I will return to my kith and kin and
 my kingdom and tell my father and family what hath passed and acquaint
 him with what mine eyes have seen.
 </p><p>  Then he addressed himself to seeking a place wherein he might safely
 bestow himself and his horse and where none should descry him, and
 presently, behold, he espied a-middlemost of the city a palace
 rising high in upper air surrounded by a great wall with lofty
 crenelles and battlements, guarded by forty black slaves clad in
 complete mail and armed with spears and swords, bows and arrows. Quoth
 he, "This is a goodly place," and turned the descent pin, whereupon
 the horse sank down with him like a weary bird, and alighted gently on
 the terrace roof of the palace. So the Prince dismounted and
 ejaculating "Alhamdolillah- praise be to Allah," he began to go round
 about the horse and examine it, saying: "By Allah, he who fashioned
 thee with these perfections was a cunning craftsman, and if the
 Almighty extend the term of my life and restore me to my country and
 kinsfolk in safety and reunite me with my father, I will assuredly
 bestow upon him all manner bounties and benefit him with the utmost
 beneficence."
 </p><p>  By this time night had overtaken him and he sat on the roof till
 he was assured that all in the palace slept, and indeed hunger and
 thirst were sore upon him for that he had not tasted food nor drunk
 water since he parted from his sire. So he said within himself,
 "Surely the like of this palace will not lack of victual," and,
 leaving the horse above, went down in search of somewhat to eat.
 Presently he came to a staircase and, descending it to the bottom,
 found himself in a court paved with white marble and alabaster,
 which shone in the light of the moon. He marveled at the place and the
 goodliness of its fashion, but sensed no sound of speaker and saw no
 living soul and stood in perplexed surprise, looking right and left
 and knowing not whither he should wend. Then said he to himself, "I
 may not do better than return to where I left my horse and pass the
 night by it, and as soon as day shall dawn I will mount and ride
 away."
 </p><p>  However, as he tarried talking to himself, he espied a light
 within the palace, and making toward it, found that it came from a
 candle that stood before a door of the harem, at the head of a
 sleeping eunuch, as he were one of the Ifrits of Solomon or a
 tribesman of the Jinn, longer than lumber and broader than a bench. He
 lay before the door, with the pommel of his sword gleaming in the
 flame of the candle, and at his head was a bag of leather hanging from
 a column of granite. When the Prince saw this, he was affrighted and
 said, "I crave help from Allah the Supreme! O mine Holy One, even as
 Thou hast already delivered me from destruction, so vouchsafe me
 strength to quit myself of the adventure of this palace!" So saying,
 he put out his hand to the budget and taking it, carried it aside
 and opened it and found in it food of the best.
 </p><p>  He ate his fill and refreshed himself and drank water, after which
 he hung up the provision bag in its place and drawing the eunuch's
 sword from its sheath, took it, whilst the slave slept on, knowing not
 whence Destiny should come to him. Then the Prince fared forward
 into the palace and ceased not till he came to a second door, with a
 curtain drawn before it. So he raised the curtain and, behold, on
 entering he saw a couch of the whitest ivory inlaid with pearls and
 jacinths and jewels, and four slave girls sleeping about it. He went
 up to the couch, to see what was thereon, and found a young lady lying
 asleep, chemised with her hair as she were the full moon rising over
 the eastern horizon, with flower-white brow and shining hair parting
 and cheeks like blood-red anemones, and dainty moles thereon. He was
 amazed at her as she lay in her beauty and loveliness, her symmetry
 and grace, and he recked no more of death.
 </p><p>  So he went up to her, trembling in every nerve, and, shuddering with
 pleasure, kissed her on the right cheek, whereupon she awoke
 forthright and opened her eyes, and seeing the Prince standing at
 her head, said to him, "Who art thou, and whence comest thou?" Quoth
 he, "I am thy slave and thy lover." Asked she, "And who brought thee
 hither?" and he answered, "My Lord and my fortune." Then said Shams
 al-Nahar (for such was her name) "Haply thou art he who demanded me
 yesterday of my father in marriage and he rejected thee, pretending
 that thou wast foul of favor. By Allah, my sire lied in his throat
 when he spoke this thing, for thou art not other than beautiful."
 Now the son of the King of Hind had sought her in marriage, but her
 father had rejected him for that he was ugly and uncouth, and she
 thought the Prince was he. So when she saw his beauty and grace (for
 indeed he was like the radiant moon) the syntheism of love gat hold of
 her heart as it were a flaming fire, and they fell to talk and
 converse.
 </p><p>  Suddenly, her waiting women awoke and, seeing the Prince with
 their mistress, said to her, "O my lady, who is this with thee?" Quoth
 she: "I know not. I found him sitting by me when I woke up. Haply 'tis
 he who seeketh me in marriage of my sire." Quoth they, "O my lady,
 by Allah the All-Father, this is not he who seeketh thee in
 marriage, for he is hideous and this man is handsome and of high
 degree. Indeed, the other is not fit to be his servant." Then the
 handmaidens went out to the eunuch, and finding him slumbering,
 awoke him, and he started up in alarm. Said they, "How happeth it that
 thou art on guard at the palace and yet men come in to us whilst we
 are asleep?" When the black heard this, he sprang in haste to his
 sword, but found it not, and fear took him, and trembling. Then he
 went in, confounded, to his mistress and seeing the Prince sitting
 at talk with her, said to him, "O my lord, art thou man or Jinni?"
 Replied the Prince: "Woe to thee, O unluckiest of slaves. How darest
 thou even the sons of the royal Chosroes with one of the unbelieving
 Satans?" And he was as a raging lion.
 </p><p>  Then he took the sword in his hand and said to the slave, "I am
 the King's son-in-law, and he hath married me to his daughter and
 bidden me go in to her." And when the eunuch heard these words he
 replied, "O my lord, if thou be indeed of kind a man as thou
 avouchest, she is fit for none but for thee, and thou art worthier
 of her than any other." Thereupon the eunuch ran to the King,
 shrieking loud and rending his raiment and heaving dust upon his head.
 And when the King heard his outcry, he said to him: "What hath
 befallen thee? Speak quickly and be brief, for thou hast fluttered
 my heart." Answered the eunuch, "O King, come to thy daughter's
 succor, for a devil of the Jinn, in the likeness of a King's son
 hath got possession of her, so up and at him!"
 </p><p>  When the King heard this, he thought to kill him and said, "How
 camest thou to be careless of my daughter and let this demon come at
 her?" Then he betook himself to the Princess's palace, where he
 found her slave women standing to await him, and asked them, "What
 is come to my daughter?" "O King," answered they, "slumber overcame us
 and when we awoke, we found a young man sitting upon her couch in talk
 with her, as he were the full moon. Never saw we aught fairer of favor
 than he. So we questioned him of his case and he declared that thou
 hadst given him thy daughter in marriage. More than this we know
 not, nor do we know if he be a man or a Jinni, but he is modest and
 well-bred, and doth nothing unseemly or which leadeth to disgrace."
 </p><p>  Now when the King heard these words, his wrath cooled, and he raised
 the curtain little by little and looking in, saw sitting at talk
 with his daughter a Prince of the goodliest, with a face like the full
 moon for sheen. At this sight he could not contain himself, of his
 jealousy for his daughter's honor, and putting aside the curtain,
 rushed in upon them drawn sword in hand like a furious Ghul. Now
 when the Prince saw him he asked the Princess, "Is this thy sire?" and
 she answered, "Yes." Whereupon he sprang, to his feet and, seizing his
 sword, cried out at the King with so terrible a cry that he was
 confounded. Then the youth would have fallen on him with the sword,
 but the King, seeing that the Prince was doughtier than he, sheathed
 his scimitar and stood till the young man came up to him, when he
 accosted him courteously and said to him, "O youth, art thou a man
 or a Jinni?" Quoth the Prince: "Did I not respect thy right as mine
 host and thy daughter's honor, I would spill thy blood! How darest
 thou fellow me with devils, me that am a Prince of the sons of the
 royal Chosroes, who, had they wished to take thy kingdom, could
 shake thee like an earthquake from thy glory and thy dominions, and
 spoil thee of all thy possessions?"
 </p><p>  Now when the King heard his words, he was confounded with awe and
 bodily fear of him and rejoined: "If thou indeed be of the sons of the
 Kings, as thou pretendest, how cometh it that thou enterest my
 palace without my permission, and smirchest mine honor, making thy way
 to my daughter and feigning that thou art her husband and claiming
 that I have given her to thee to wife, I that have slain kings and
 king's sons who sought her of me in marriage? And now who shall save
 thee from my might and majesty when, if I cried out to my slaves and
 servants and bade them put thee to the vilest of deaths, they would
 slay thee forthright? Who shall deliver thee out of my hand?"
 </p><p>  When the Prince heard this speech of the King, he answered: "Verily,
 I wonder at thee and at the shortness and denseness of thy wit! Say
 me, canst covet for thy daughter a mate comelier than myself, and hast
 ever seen a stouter-hearted man or one better fitted for a Sultan or a
 more glorious in rank and dominion than I?" Rejoined the King: "Nay,
 by Allah! But I would have had thee, O youth, act after the custom
 of kings and demand her from me to wife before witnesses, that I might
 have married her to thee publicly. And now, even were I to marry her
 to thee privily, yet hast thou dishonored me in her person."
 Rejoined the Prince: "Thou sayest sooth, O King, but if thou summon
 thy slaves and thy soldiers and they fall upon me and slay me, as thou
 pretendest, thou wouldst but publish thine own disgrace, and the
 folk would be divided between belief in thee and disbelief in thee.
 Wherefore, O King, thou wilt do well, meseemeth, to turn from this
 thought to that which I shall counsel thee." Quoth the King, "Let me
 hear what thou hast to advise," and quoth the Prince:
 </p><p>  "What I have to propose to thee is this: Either do thou meet me in
 combat singular, I and thou, and he who slayeth his adversary shall be
 held the worthier and having a better title to the kingdom; or else
 let me be this night, and whenas dawns the morn, draw out against me
 thy horsemen and footmen and servants, but first tell me their
 number." Said the King, "They are forty thousand horse, besides my own
 slaves and their followers, who are the like of them in number."
 Thereupon said the Prince: "When the day shall break, do thou array
 them against me and say to them: 'This man is a suitor to me for my
 daughter's hand, on condition that he shall do battle singlehanded
 against you all; for he pretendeth that he will overcome you and put
 you to the rout, and indeed that ye cannot prevail against him.' After
 which, leave me to do battle with them. If they slay me, then is thy
 secret the surer guarded and thine honor the better warded, and if I
 overcome them and see their backs, then is it the like of me a king
 should covet to his son-in-law."
 </p><p>  So the King approved of his opinion and accepted his proposition,
 despite his awe at the boldness of his speech and amaze at the
 pretensions of the Prince to meet in fight his whole host, such as
 he had described it to him, being at heart assured that he would
 perish in the fray and so he should be quit of him and freed from
 the fear of dishonor. Thereupon he called the eunuch and bade him go
 to his Wazir without stay and delay and command him to assemble the
 whole of the army and cause them don their arms and armor and mount
 their steeds. So the eunuch carried the King's order to the
 Minister, who straightway summoned the captains of the host and the
 lords of the realm and bade them don their harness of derring-do and
 mount horse and sally forth in battle array.
 </p><p>  Such was their case, but as regards the King, he sat a long while
 conversing with the young Prince, being pleased with his wise speech
 and good sense and fine breeding. And when it was daybreak, he
 returned to his palace and, seating himself on his throne, commanded
 his merry men to mount, and bade them saddle one of the best of the
 royal steeds with handsome selle and housings and trappings and
 bring it to the Prince. But the youth said, "O King, I will not
 mount horse till I come in view of the troops and review them." "Be it
 as thou wilt," replied the King. Then the two repaired to the parade
 ground where the troops were drawn up, and the young Prince looked
 upon them and noted their great number. After which the King cried out
 to them, saying: "Ho, all ye men, there is come to me a youth who
 seeketh my daughter in marriage, and in very sooth never have I seen a
 goodlier than he- no, nor a stouter of heart nor a doughtier of arm,
 for he pretendeth that he can overcome you singlehanded, and force you
 to flight and that, were ye a hundred thousand in number, yet for
 him would ye be but few. Now when he chargeth down on you, do ye
 receive him upon point of pike and sharp of saber, for indeed he
 hath undertaken a mighty matter."
 </p><p>  Then quoth the King to the Prince, "Up, O my son, and do thy
 devoir on them." Answered he: "O King, thou dealest not justly and
 fairly by me. How shall I go forth against them, seeing that I am
 afoot and the men be mounted?" The King retorted, "I bade thee
 mount, and thou refusedst, but choose thou which of my horses thou
 wilt." Then he said, "Not one of thy horses pleaseth me, and I will
 ride none but that on which I came." Asked the King, "And where is thy
 horse?" "Atop of thy palace." "In what part of my palace?" "On the
 roof." Now when the King heard these words, he cried: "Out on thee!
 This is the first sip thou hast given of madness. How can the horse be
 on the roof.? But we shall at once see if thou speak truth or lies."
 Then he turned to one of his chief officers and said to him, "Go to my
 palace and bring me what thou findest on the roof." So all the
 people marveled at the young Prince's words, saying one to other, "How
 can a horse come down the steps from the roof.? Verily this is a thing
 whose like we never heard."
 </p><p>  In the meantime the King's messenger repaired to the palace and,
 mounting to the roof, found the horse standing there, and never had he
 looked on a handsomer. But when he drew near and examined it, he saw
 that it was made of ebony and ivory. Now the officer was accompanied
 by other high officers, who also looked on, and they laughed to one
 another, saying: "Was it of the like of this horse that the youth
 spake? We cannot deem him other than mad. However, we shall soon see
 the truth of his case. Peradventure herein is some mighty matter,
 and he is a man of high degree." Then they lifted up the horse bodily,
 carrying it to the King, set it down before him. And all the lieges
 flocked round to look at it, marveling at the beauty of its
 proportions and the richness of its saddle and bridle. The King also
 admired it, and wondered at it with extreme wonder, and he asked the
 Prince, "O youth, is this thy horse?" He answered, "Yes, O King,
 this is my horse, and thou shalt soon see the marvel it showeth."
 Rejoined the King, "Then take and mount it," and the Prince
 retorted, "I will not mount till the troops withdraw afar from it."
 </p><p>  So the King bade them retire a bowshot from the horse, whereupon
 quoth its owner: "O King, see thou, I am about to mount my horse and
 charge upon thy host and scatter them right and left and split their
 hearts asunder." Said the King, "Do as thou wilt, and spare not
 their lives, for they will not spare thine." Then the Prince
 mounted, whilst the troops ranged themselves in ranks before him,
 and one said to another, "When the youth cometh between the ranks,
 we will take him on the points of our pikes and the sharps of our
 sabers." Quoth another: "By Allah, this is a mere misfortune. How
 shall we slay a youth so comely of face and shapely of form?" And a
 third continued: "Ye will have hard work to get the better of him, for
 the youth had not done this but for what he knew of his own prowess
 and pre-eminence of valor."
 </p><p>  Meanwhile, having settled himself in his saddle, the Prince turned
 the pin of ascent whilst an eyes were strained to see what he would
 do, whereupon the horse began to heave and rock and sway to and fro
 and make the strangest of movements steed ever made, till its belly
 was filled with air and it took flight with its rider and soared
 high into the sky. When the King saw this, he cried out to his men,
 saying: "Woe to you! Catch him, catch him, ere he 'scape you!" But his
 Wazirs and viceroys said to him: "O King, can a man overtake the
 flying bird? This is surely none but some mighty magician or Marid
 of the, Jinn, or devil, and Allah save thee from him! So praise thou
 the Almighty for deliverance of thee and of all thy host from his
 hand."
 </p><p>  Then the King returned to his palace after seeing the feat of the
 Prince, and going in to his daughter, acquainted her with what had
 befallen them both on the parade ground. He found her grievously
 afflicted for the Prince and bewailing her separation from him,
 wherefore she fell sick with violent sickness and took to her
 pillow. Now when her father saw her on this wise, he pressed her to
 his breast and kissing her between the eyes, said to her: "O my
 daughter, praise Allah Almighty and thank Him for that He hath
 delivered us from this crafty enchanter, this villian, this low
 fellow, this thief who thought only of seducing thee!" And he repeated
 to her the story of the Prince and how he had disappeared in the
 firmament, and he abused him and cursed him, knowing not how dearly
 his daughter loved him. But she paid no heed to his words and did
 but redouble in her tears and wails, saying to herself, "By Allah, I
 will neither eat meat nor drain drink till Allah reunite me with him!"
 Her father was greatly concerned for her case and mourned much over
 her plight, but for all he could do to soothe her, love longing only
 increased on her.
 </p><p>  Thus far concerning the King and Princess Shams al-Nahar, but as
 regards Prince Kamar al-Akmar, when he had risen high in air, he
 turned his horse's head toward his native land, and being alone, mused
 upon the beauty of the Princess and her loveliness. Now he had
 inquired of the King's people the name of the city and of its King and
 his daughter, and men had told him that it was the city of Sana'a.
 So he journeyed with all speed till he drew near his father's
 capital and, making an airy circuit about the city, alighted on the
 roof of the King's palace, where he left his horse whilst he descended
 into the palace, and seeing its threshold strewn with ashes, thought
 that one of his family was dead. Then he entered, as of wont, and
 found his father and mother and sisters clad in mourning raiment of
 black, all pale of faces and lean of frames. When his sire descried
 him and was assured that it was indeed his son, he cried out with a
 great cry and fell down in a fit, but after a time, coming to himself,
 threw himself upon him and embraced him, clipping him to his bosom and
 rejoicing in him with exceeding joy and extreme gladness. His mother
 and sisters heard this, so they came in, and seeing the Prince, fell
 upon him, kissing him and weeping and joying with exceeding joyance.
 </p><p>  Then they questioned him of his case, so he told them all that had
 past from first to last, and his father said to him, "Praised be Allah
 for thy safety, O coolth of my eyes and core of my heart!" Then the
 King bade hold high festival, and the glad tidings flew through the
 city. So they beat drums and cymbals and, doffing the weed of
 mourning, they donned the gay garb of gladness and decorated the
 streets and markets, whilst the folk vied with one another who
 should be the first to give the King joy, and the King proclaimed a
 general pardon, and opening the prisons, released those who were
 therein prisoned. Moreover, he made banquets for the people, with
 great abundance of eating and drinking, for seven days and nights, and
 all creatures were gladsomest. And he took horse with his son and rode
 out with him, that the folk might see him and rejoice.
 </p><p>  After a while the Prince asked about the maker of the horse, saying,
 "O my father, what hath fortune done with him?" and the King answered:
 "Allah never bless him nor the hour wherein I set eyes on him! For
 he was the cause of thy separation from us, O my son, and he hath lain
 in jail since the day of thy disappearance." Then the King bade
 release him from prison and, sending for him, invested him in a
 dress of satisfaction and entreated him with the utmost favor and
 munificence, save that he would not give him his daughter to wife.
 Whereat the sage raged with sore rage and repented of that which he
 had done, knowing that the Prince had secured the secret of the
 steed and the manner of its motion. Moreover, the King said to his
 son: "I reck thou wilt do well not to go near the horse henceforth,
 and more especially not to mount it after this day; for thou knowest
 not its properties, and belike thou art in error about it."
 </p><p>  Now the Prince had told his father of his adventure with the King of
 Sana'a and his daughter, and he said, "Had the King intended to kill
 thee, he had done so, but thine hour was not yet come." When the
 rejoicings were at an end, the people returned to their places and the
 King and his son to the palace, where they sat down and fell to
 eating, drinking, and making merry. Now the King had a handsome
 handmaiden who was skilled in playing the lute, so she took it and
 began to sweep the strings and sing thereto before the King and his
 son of separation of lovers, and she chanted the following verses:
 </p><p>  "Deem not that absence breeds in me aught of forgetfulness.
 <br>   What should remember I did you fro' my remembrance wane?
 <br>  Time dies but never dies the fondest love for you we bear,
 <br>  And in your love I'll die and in your love I'll arise again."
 <br></p><p>  When the Prince heard these verses, the fires of longing flamed up
 in his heart, and pine and passion redoubled upon him. Grief and
 regret were sore upon him and his bowels yeamed in him for love of the
 King's daughter of Sana'a. So he rose forthright and, escaping his
 father's notice, went forth the palace to the horse and mounting it,
 turned the pin of ascent, whereupon birdlike it flew with him high
 in air and soared toward the upper regions of the sky. In early
 morning his father missed him, and going up to the pinnacle of the
 palace in great concern, saw his son rising into the firmament,
 whereat he was sore afflicted and repented in all penitence that he
 had not taken the horse and hidden it. And he said to himself, "By
 Allah, if but my son returned to me, I will destroy the horse, that my
 heart may be at rest concerning my son." And he fell again to
 weeping and bewailing himself.
 </p><p>  Such was his case, but as regards the Prince, he ceased not flying
 on through air till he came to the city of Sana'a and alighted on
 the roof as before. Then he crept down stealthily and, finding the
 eunuch asleep, as of wont, raised the curtain and went on little by
 little till he came to the door of the Princess's alcove chamber and
 stopped to listen, when lo! he heard her shedding plenteous tears
 and reciting verses, whilst her women slept round her. Presently,
 overhearing her weeping and wailing, quoth they, "O our mistress,
 why wilt thou mourn for one who mourneth not for thee?" Quoth she,
 "O ye little of wit, is he for whom I mourn of those who forget or who
 are forgotten?" And she fell again to wailing and weeping, till sleep
 overcame her.
 </p><p>  Hereat the Prince's heart melted for her and his gall bladder was
 like to burst, so he entered and, seeing her lying asleep without
 covering, touched her with his hand, whereupon she opened her eyes and
 espied him standing by her. Said he, "Why all this crying and
 mourning?" And when she knew him, she threw herself upon him and
 took him around the neck and kissed him and answered, "For thy sake
 and because of my separation from thee." Said he, "O my lady, I have
 been made desolate by thee all this long time!" But she replied, "'Tis
 thou who hast desolated me, and hadst thou tarried longer, I had
 surely died!" Rejoined he: "O my lady, what thinkest thou of my case
 with thy father, and how he dealt with me? Were it not for my love
 of thee, O temptation and seduction of the Three Worlds, I had
 certainly slain him and made him a warning to all beholders, but
 even as I love thee, so I love him for thy sake." Quoth she: "How
 couldst thou leave me? Can my life be sweet to me after thee?" Quoth
 he: "Let what hath happened suffice. I am now hungry, and thirsty." So
 she bade her maidens make ready meat and drink, and they sat eating
 and drinking and conversing till night was well-nigh ended; and when
 day broke he rose to take leave of her and depart ere the eunuch
 should awake.
 </p><p>  Shams al-Nahar asked him, "Whither goest thou?" and he answered, "To
 my father' house, and I plight thee my troth that I will come to
 thee once in every week." But she wept and said: "I conjure thee, by
 Allah the Almighty, take me with thee whereso thou wendest and make me
 not taste anew the bitter gourd of separation from thee." Quoth he,
 "Wilt thou indeed go with me?" and quoth she, "Yes." "Then," said
 he, "arise, that we depart." So she rose forthright and going to a
 chest, affayed herself in what was richest and dearest to her of her
 trinkets of gold and jewels of price, and she fared forth, her
 handmaids recking naught. So he carried her up to the roof of the
 palace and, mounting the ebony horse, took her up behind him and
 made her fast to himself, binding her with strong bonds. After which
 he turned the shoulder pin of ascent and the horse rose with him
 high in air.
 </p><p>  When her slave women saw this, they shrieked aloud and told her
 father and mother, who in hot haste ran to the palace roof and looking
 up, saw the magical horse flying away with the Prince and Princess. At
 this the King was troubled with ever-increasing trouble and cried out,
 saying, "O King's son, I conjure thee, by Allah, have ruth on me and
 my wife and bereave us not of our daughter!" The Prince made him no
 reply, but, thinking in himself that the maiden repented of leaving
 father and mother, asked her, "O ravishment of the age, say me, wilt
 thou that I restore thee to thy mother and father?" Whereupon she
 answered: "By Allah, O my lord, that is not my desire. My only wish is
 to be with thee, wherever thou art, for I am distracted by the love of
 thee from all else, even from my father and mother." Hearing these
 words, the Prince joyed with great joy, and made the horse fly and
 fare softly with them, so as not to disquiet her. Nor did they stay
 their flight till they came in sight of a green meadow, wherein was
 a spring of running water. Here they alighted and ate and drank, after
 which the Prince took horse again and set her behind him, binding
 her in his fear for her safety, after which they fared on till they
 came in sight of his father's capital.
 </p><p>  At this, the Prince was filled with joy and bethought himself to
 show his beloved the seat of his dominion and his father's power and
 dignity and give her to know that it was greater than that of her
 sire. So he set her down in one of his father's gardens without the
 city where his parent was wont to take his pleasure, and carrying
 her into a domed summerhouse prepared there for the King, left the
 ebony horse at the door and charged the damsel keep watch over it,
 saying, "Sit here till my messenger come to thee, for I go now to my
 father to make ready a palace for thee and show thee my royal estate."
 She was delighted when she heard these words and said to him, "Do as
 thou wilt," for she thereby understood that she should not enter the
 city but with due honor and worship, as became her rank.
 </p><p>  Then the Prince left her and betook himself to the palace of the
 King his father, who rejoiced in his return and met him and welcomed
 him, and the Prince said to him: "Know that I have brought with me the
 King's daughter of whom I told thee, and have left her without the
 city in such a garden and come to tell thee, that thou mayest make
 ready the procession of estate and go forth to meet her and show her
 the royal dignity and troops and guards." Answered the King, "With joy
 and gladness," and straightway bade decorate the town with the
 goodliest adornment. Then he took horse and rode out in all
 magnificence and majesty, he and his host, high officers, and
 household, with drums and kettledrums, fifes and clarions and all
 manner instruments, whilst the Prince drew forth of his treasuries
 jewelry and apparel and what else of the things which kings hoard
 and made a rare display of wealth-and splendor. Moreover he got
 ready for the Princess a canopied litter of brocades, green, red,
 and yellow, wherein he set Indian and Greek and Abyssinian slave
 girls. Then he left the litter and those who were therein and preceded
 them to the pavilion where he had set her down, and searched but found
 naught, neither Princess nor horse.
 </p><p>  When he saw this, he beat his face and rent his raiment and began to
 wander round about the garden as he had lost his wits, after which
 he came to his senses and said to himself: "How could she have come at
 the secret of this horse, seeing I told her nothing of it? Maybe the
 Persian sage who made the horse hath chanced upon her and stolen her
 away, in revenge for my father's treatment of him." Then he sought the
 guardians of the garden and asked them if they had seen any pass the
 precincts, and said: "Hath anyone come in here? Tell me the truth
 and the whole truth, or I will at once strike off your heads." They
 were terrified by his threats, but they answered with one voice, "We
 have seen no man enter save the Persian sage, who came to gather
 healing herbs." So the Prince was certified that it was indeed he that
 had taken away the maiden, and abode confounded and perplexed
 concerning his case. And he was abashed before the folk and, turning
 to his sire, told him what had happened and said to him: "Take the
 troops and march them back to the city. As for me, I will never return
 till I have cleared up this affair."
 </p><p>  When the King heard this, he wept and beat his breast and said to
 him: "O my son, calm thy choler and master thy chagrin and come home
 with us and look what Idng's daughter thou wouldst fain have, that I
 may marry thee to her." But the Prince paid no heed to his words and
 farewelling him, departed, whilst the King returned to the city, and
 their joy was changed into sore annoy. Now, as Destiny issued her
 decree, when the Prince left the Princess in the garden house and
 betook himself to his father's palace for the ordering of his
 affair, the Persian entered the garden to pluck certain simples and,
 scenting the sweet savor of musk and perfumes that exhaled from the
 Princess and impregnated the whole place, followed it till he came
 to the pavilion and saw standing at the door the horse which he had
 made with his own hands. His heart was filled with joy and gladness,
 for he had bemourned its loss much since it had gone out of his
 hand. So he went up to it and, examining its every part, found it
 whole and sound, whereupon he was about to mount and ride away when he
 bethought himself and said, "Needs must I first look what the Prince
 hath brought and left here with the horse." So he entered the pavilion
 and seeing the Princess sitting there, as she were the sun shining
 sheen in the sky serene, knew her at the first glance to be some
 highborn lady, and doubted not but the Prince had brought her
 thither on the horse and left her in the pavilion whilst he went to
 the city to make ready for her entry in state procession with all
 splendor.
 </p><p>  Then he went up to her and kissed the earth between her hands,
 whereupon she raised her eyes to him and, finding him exceedingly foul
 of face and favor, asked, "Who art thou?", and he answered, "O my
 lady, I am a messenger sent by the Prince, who hath bidden me bring
 thee to another pleasance nearer the city, for that my lady the
 Queen cannot walk so far and is unwilling, of her joy in thee, that
 another should forestall her with thee." Quoth she, "Where is the
 Prince?" and quoth the Persian, "He is in the city, with his sire, and
 forthwith he shall come for thee in great state." Said she: "O thou!
 Say me, could he find none handsomer to send to me?" Whereat loud
 laughed the sage and said: "Yea verily, he hath not a Mameluke as ugly
 as I am, but, O my lady, let not the ill favor of my face and the
 foulness of my form deceive thee. Hadst thou profited of me as hath
 the Prince, verily thou wouldst praise my affair. Indeed, he chose
 me as his messenger to thee because of my uncomeliness and
 loathsomeness in his jealous love of thee. Else hath he Mamelukes
 and Negro slaves, pages, eunuchs, and attendants out of number, each
 goodlier than other."
 </p><p>  Whenas she heard this, it commended itself to her reason and she
 believed him, so she rose forthright and, putting her hand in his,
 said, "O my father, what hast thou brought me to ride?" He replied, "O
 my lady thou shalt ride the horse thou camest on," and she, "I
 cannot ride it by myself." Whereupon he smiled and knew that he was
 her master and said, "I will ride with thee myself." So he mounted
 and, taking her up behind him, bound her to himself with firm bonds,
 while she knew not what he would with her. Then he turned the ascent
 pin, whereupon the belly of the horse became full of wind and it
 swayed to and fro like a wave of the sea, and rose with them high in
 air, nor slackened in its flight till it was out of sight of the city.
 Now when Shams al-Nahar saw this, she asked him: "Ho, thou! What is
 become of that thou toldest me of my Prince, making me believe that he
 sent thee to me?" Answered the Persian, "Allah damn the Prince! He
 is a mean and skinflint knave." She cried: "Woe to thee! How darest
 thou disobey thy lord's commandment?" Whereto the Persian replied: "He
 is no lord of mine. Knowest thou who I am?" Rejoined the Princess,
 "I know nothing of thee save what thou toldest me," and retorted he:
 "What I told thee was a trick of mine against thee and the King's son.
 I have long lamented the loss of this horse which is under us, for I
 constructed it and made myself master of it. But now I have gotten
 firm hold of it and of thee too, and I will burn his heart even as
 he hath burnt mine, nor shall he ever have the horse again- no,
 never! So be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, for I
 can be of more use to thee than he. And I am generous as I am wealthy.
 My servants and slaves shall obey thee as their mistress. I will
 robe thee in finest raiment and thine every wish shall be at thy
 will."
 </p><p>  When she heard this, she buffeted her face and cried out, saying:
 "Ah, wellaway! I have not won my beloved and I have lost my father and
 mother!" And she wept bitter tears over what had befallen her,
 whilst the sage fared on with her, without ceasing, till he came to
 the land of the Greeks and alighted in a verdant mead, abounding in
 streams and trees. Now this meadow lay near a city wherein was a
 King of high puissance, and it chanced that he went forth that day
 to hunt and divert himself. As he passed by the meadow, he saw the
 Persian standing there, with the damsel and the horse by his side, and
 before the sage was ware, the King's slaves fell upon him and
 carried him and the lady and the horse to their master, who, noting
 the foulness of the man's favor and his loathsomeness and the beauty
 of the girl and her loveliness, said, "O my lady, what kin is this
 oldster to thee?" The Persian made haste to reply, saying, "She is
 my wife and the daughter of my father's brother." But the lady at once
 gave him the lie and said: "O King, by Allah, I know him not, nor is
 he my husband. Nay, he is a wicked magician who hath stolen me away by
 force and fraud." Thereupon the King bade bastinado the Persian, and
 they beat him till he was well-nigh dead, after which the King
 commanded to carry him to the city and cast him into jail; and, taking
 from him the damsel and the ebony horse (though he knew not its
 properties nor the secret of its motion), set the girl in his seraglio
 and the horse amongst his hoards.
 </p><p>  Such was the case with the sage and the lady, but as regards
 Prince Kamar al-Akmar, he garbed himself in traveling gear and
 taking what he needed of money, set out tracking their trail in very
 sorry plight, and journeyed from the country to country and city to
 city seeking the Princess and inquiring after the ebony horse,
 whilst all who heard him marveled at him and deemed his talk
 extravagant. Thus he continued doing a long while, but for all his
 inquiry and quest, he could hit on no news of her. At last he came
 to her father's city of Sana'a and there asked for her, but could
 get no tidings of her and found her father mourning her loss. So he
 turned back and made for the land of the Greeks, continuing to inquire
 concerning the twain as he went till, as chance would have it, he
 alighted at a certain khan and saw a company of merchants sitting at
 talk. So he sat down near them and heard one say, "O my friends, I
 lately witnessed a wonder of wonders." They asked, "What was that?"
 and he answered: "I was visiting such a district in such a city
 (naming the city wherein was the Princess), and I heard its people
 chatting of a strange thing which had lately befallen. It was that
 their King went out one day hunting and coursing with a company of his
 courtiers and the lords of his realm, and issuing from the city,
 they came to a green meadow where they espied an old man standing,
 with a woman sitting hard by a horse of ebony. The man was foulest
 foul of face and loathly of form, but the woman was a marvel of beauty
 and loveliness and elegance and perfect grace, and as for the wooden
 horse, it was a miracle- never saw eyes aught goodlier than it nor
 more gracious than its make." Asked the others, "And what did the King
 with them?" and the merchant answered; "As for the man, the King
 seized him and questioned him of the damsel and he pretended that she
 was his wife and the daughter of his paternal uncle, but she gave him
 the lie forthright and declared that he was a sorcerer and a villian.
 So the King took her from the old man and bade beat him and cast him
 into the trunk house. As for the ebony horse, I know not what became
 of it."
 </p><p>  When the Prince heard these words, he drew near to the merchant
 and began questioning him discreetly and courteously touching the name
 of the city and of its King, which when he knew, he passed the night
 full of joy. And as soon as dawned the day he set out and traveled
 sans surcease till he reached that city. But when he would have
 entered, the gatekeepers laid hands on him, that they might bring
 him before the King to question him of his condition and the craft
 in which he skilled and the cause of his coming thither- such being
 the usage and custom of their ruler. Now it was suppertime when he
 entered the city, and it was then impossible to go in to the King or
 take counsel with him respecting the stranger. So the guards carried
 him to the jail, thinking to lay him by the heels there for the night.
 But when the warders saw his beauty and loveliness, they could not
 find it in their hearts to imprison him. They made him sit with them
 without the walls, and when food came to them, he ate with them what
 sufficed him.
 </p><p>  As soon as they had made an end of eating, they turned to the Prince
 and said, "What countryman art thou?" "I come from Fars," answered he,
 "the land of the Chosroes." When they heard this, they laughed and one
 of them said: "O Chosroan, I have heard the talk of men and their
 histories and I have looked into their conditions, but never saw I
 or heard I a bigger liar than the Chosroan which is with us in the
 jail." Quoth another, "And never did I see aught fouler than his favor
 or more hideous than his visnomy." Asked the Prince, "What have ye
 seen of his lying?" and they answered: "He pretendeth that he is one
 of the wise! Now the King came upon him as he went a-hunting, and
 found with him a most beautiful woman and a horse of the blackest
 ebony- never saw I a handsomer. As for the damsel, she is with the
 King, who is enamored of her and would fain marry her. But she is mad,
 and were this man a leech, as he claimeth to be, he would have
 healed her, for the King doth his utmost to discover a cure for her
 case and a remedy for her disease, and this whole year past hath he
 spent treasures upon physicians and astrologers on her account, but
 none can avail to cure her. As for the horse, it is in the royal hoard
 house, and the ugly man is here with us in prison, and as soon as
 night falleth, he weepeth and bemoaneth himself and will not let us
 sleep."
 </p><p>  When the warders had recounted the case of the Persian egromancer
 they held in prison and his weeping and wailing, the Prince at once
 devised a device whereby he might compass his desire, and presently
 the guards of the gate, being minded to sleep, led him into the jail
 and locked the door. So he overheard the Persian weeping and bemoaning
 himself in his own tongue, and saying: "Alack, and alas for my sin,
 that I sinned against myself and against the King's son, in that which
 I did with the damsel, for I neither left her nor won my will of
 her! All this cometh of my lack of sense, in that I sought for
 myself that which I deserved not and which befitted not the like of
 me. For whoso seeketh what suiteth him not at all, falleth with the
 like of my fall." Now when the King's son heard this, he accosted
 him in Persian, saying: "How long will this weeping and wailing
 last? Say me, thinkest thou that hath befallen thee that which never
 befell other than thou?"
 </p><p>  Now when the Persian heard this, he made friends with him and
 began to complain to him of his case and misfortunes. And as soon as
 the morning morrowed, the warders took the Prince and carried him
 before their King, informing him that he had entered the city on the
 previous night, at a time when audience was impossible. Quoth the King
 to the Prince, "Whence comest thou, and what is thy name and trade,
 and why hast thou traveled hither?" He replied: "As to my name, I am
 called in Persian Harjah. As to my country, I come from the land of
 Fars, and I am of the men of art and especially of the art of medicine
 and healing the sick and those whom the Jinns drive mad. For this I go
 round about all countries and cities, to profit by adding knowledge to
 my knowledge, and whenever I see a patient I heal him, and this is
 my craft." Now when the King heard this, he rejoiced with exceeding
 joy and said, "O excellent sage, thou hast indeed come to us at a time
 when we need thee." Then he acquainted him with the case of the
 Princess, adding, "If thou cure her and recover her from her
 madness, thou shalt have of me everything thou seekest." Replied the
 Prince, "Allah save and favor the King. Describe to me all thou hast
 seen of her insanity, and tell me how long it is since the access
 attacked her, also how thou camest by her and the horse and the sage."
 </p><p>  So the King told him the whole story, from first to last, adding,
 "The sage is in jail." Quoth the Prince, "O auspicious King, and
 what hast thou done with the horse?" Quoth the King, "O youth, it is
 with me yet, laid up in one of my treasure chambers." Whereupon said
 the Prince within himself: "The best thing I can do is first to see
 the horse and assure myself of its condition. If it be whole and
 sound, all will be well and end well. But if its motor works be
 destroyed, I must find some other way of delivering my beloved."
 Thereupon he turned to the King and said to him: "O King, I must see
 the horse in question. Haply I may find in it somewhat that will serve
 me for the recovery of the damsel." "With all my heart," replied the
 King, and taking him by the hand, showed him into the place where
 the horse was. The Prince went round about it, examining its
 condition, and found it whole and sound, whereat he rejoiced greatly
 and said to the King: "Allah save and exalt the King! I would fain
 go in to the damsel, that I may see how it is with her, for I hope
 in Allah to heal her by my healing hand through means of the horse."
 Then he bade them take care of the horse and the King carried him to
 the Princess's apartment, where her lover found her wringing her hands
 and writhing and beating herself against the ground, and tearing her
 garments to tatters as was her wont. But there was no madness of
 Jinn in her, and she did this but that none might approach her.
 </p><p>  When the Prince saw her thus, he said to her, "No harm shall
 betide thee, O ravishment of the Three Worlds," and went on to
 soothe her and speak her fair, till he managed to whisper, "I am Kamar
 al-Akmar," whereupon she cried out with a loud cry and fell down
 fainting for excess of joy. But the King thought this was epilepsy
 brought on by her fear of him, and by her suddenly being startled.
 Then the Prince put his mouth to her ear and said to her: "O Shams
 al-Nahar, O seduction of the universe, have a care for thy life and
 mine and be patient and constant; for this our position needeth
 sufferance and skillful contrivance to make shift for our delivery
 from this tyrannical King. My first move will be now to go out to
 him and tell him that thou art possessed of a Jinn and hence thy
 madness, but that I will engage to heal thee and drive away the evil
 spirit if he will at once unbind thy bonds. So when he cometh in to
 thee, do thou speak him smooth words, that he may think I have cured
 thee, and all will be done for us as we desire." Quoth she,
 "Hearkening and obedience," and he went out to the King in joy and
 gladness, and said to him: "O august King, I have, by thy good
 fortune, discovered her disease and its remedy, and have cured her for
 thee. So now do thou go in to and speak her softly and treat her
 kindly, and promise her what thou desirest of her be accomplished to
 thee."
 </p><p>  Thereupon the King went in to her, and when she saw him, she rose
 and kissing the ground before him, bade him welcome and said, "I
 admire how thou hast come to visit thy handmaid this day." Whereat
 he was ready to fly for joy and bade the waiting women and the eunuchs
 attend her and carry her to the hammam and make ready for her
 dresses and adornment. So they went in to her and saluted her, and she
 returned their salaams with the goodliest language and after the
 pleasantest fashion. Whereupon they clad her in royal apparel and,
 clasping a collar of jewels about her neck, carried her to the bath
 and served her there. Then they brought her forth as she were the full
 moon, and when she came into the King's presence, she saluted him
 and kissed ground before him. Whereupon he joyed in her with joy
 exceeding and said to the Prince: "O Sage, O Philosopher, all this
 is of thy blessing. Allah increase to us the benefit of thy healing
 breath!" The Prince replied: "O King, for the completion of her cure
 it behooveth that thou go forth, thou and all thy troops and guards,
 to the place where thou foundest her, not forgetting the beast of
 black wood which was with her. For therein is a devil, and unless I
 exorcise him, he will return to her and afflict her at the head of
 every month." "With love and gladness," cried the King, "O thou Prince
 of all philosophers and most learned of all who see the light of day."
 </p><p>  Then he brought out the ebony horse to the meadow in question and
 rode thither with all his troops and the Princess, little weeting
 the purpose of the Prince. Now when they came to the appointed
 place, the Prince, still habited as a leech, bade them set the
 Princess and the steed as far as eye could reach from the King and his
 troops, and said to him: "With thy leave, and at thy word, I will
 now proceed to the fumigations and conjurations, and here imprison the
 adversary of mankind, that he may never more return to her. After
 this, I shall mount this wooden horse, which seemeth to be made of
 ebony, and take the damsel up behind me, whereupon it will shake and
 sway to and fro and fare forward till it come to thee, when the affair
 will be at an end. And after this thou mayest do with her as thou
 wilt." When the King heard his words, he rejoiced with extreme joy, so
 the Prince mounted the horse, and taking the damsel up behind him,
 whilst the King and his troops watched him, bound her fast to him.
 Then he turned the ascending pin and the horse took flight and
 soared with them high in air, till they disappeared from every eye.
 </p><p>  After this the King abode half the day expecting their return, but
 they returned not. So when he despaired of them, repenting him greatly
 of that which he had done and grieving sore for the loss of the
 damsel, he went back to the city with his troops. He then sent for the
 Persian who was in prison and said to him: "O thou traitor, O thou
 villain, why didst thou hide from me the mystery of the ebony horse?
 And now a sharper hath come to me and hath carried it off, together
 with a slave girl whose ornaments are worth a mint of money, and I
 shall never see anyone or anything of them again!" So the Persian
 related to him all his past, first and last, and the King was seized
 with a fit of by which well-nigh ended his life. He shut himself up in
 his palace for a while, mourning and afflicted. But at last his Wazirs
 came in to him and applied themselves to comfort him, saying: "Verily,
 he who took the damsel is an enchanter, and praised be Allah who
 hath delivered thee from his craft and sorcery!" And they ceased not
 from him till he was comforted for her loss.
 </p><p>  Thus far concerning the the King, but as for the Prince, he
 continued his career toward his father's capital in joy and cheer, and
 stayed not till he alighted on his own palace, where he set the lady
 in safety. After which he went in to his father and mother and saluted
 them and acquainted them with her coming, whereat they were filled
 with solace and gladness. Then he spread great banquets for the
 townsfolk and they held high festival a whole month, at the end of
 which time he went in to the Princess and they took their joy of
 each other with exceeding joy. But his father brake the ebony horse in
 pieces and destroyed its mechanism for flight.
 </p><p>  Moreover, the Prince wrote a letter to the Princess's father,
 advising him of all that had befallen her and informing him how she
 was now married to him and in all health and happiness, and sent it by
 a messenger, together with costly presents and curious rarities. And
 when the messenger arrived at the city which was Sana'a and
 delivered the letter and the presents to the King, he read the missive
 and rejoiced greatly thereat and accepted the presents, honoring and
 rewarding the bearer handsomely. Moreover, he forwarded rich gifts
 to his son-in-law by the same messenger, who returned to his master
 and acquainted him with what had passed, whereat he was much
 cheered. And after this the Prince wrote a letter every year to his
 father-in-law and sent him presents till, in course of time, his
 sire King Sabur deceased and he reigned in his stead, ruling justly
 over his lieges and conducting himself well and righteously toward
 them, so that the land submitted to him and his subjects did him loyal
 service. And Kamar al-Akmar and his wife Shams al-Nahar abode in the
 enjoyment of all satisfaction and solace of life till there came to
 them the Destroyer of delights and Sunderer of societies, the
 Plunderer of palaces, the Caterer for cemeteries, and the Garnerer
 of graves. And now glory be to the Living One who dieth not and in
 whose hand is the dominion of the worlds visible and invisible!
