 <h1 align="CENTER">130. OF KARI SOLMUND'S SON</h1>
 <p>Now it is to be told of Kari Solmund's son that he fared away from that hollow in which he had rested himself until he met Bard, and those words passed between them which Geirmund had told.</p>
 <p>Thence Kari rode to Mord, and told him the tidings, and he was greatly grieved.</p>
 <p>Kari said there were other things more befitting a man than to weep for them dead, and bade him rather gather folk and come to Holtford.</p>
 <p>After that he rode into Thurso-dale to Hjallti Skeggi's son, and as he went along Thurso water, he sees a man riding fast behind him. Kari waited for the man, and knows that he was Ingialld of the Springs. He sees that he is very bloody about the thigh; and Kari asked Ingialld who had wounded him, and he told him.</p>
 <p>"Where met ye two?" says Kari.</p>
 <p>"By Rangwater side," says Ingialld, "and he threw a spear over at me."</p>
 <p>"Didst thou aught for it?" asks Kari.</p>
 <p>"I threw the spear back," says Ingialld, "and they said that it met a man, and he was dead at once."</p>
 <p>"Knowest thou not," said Kari, "who the man was?"</p>
 <p>"Methought he was like Thorstein Flosi's brother's son," says Ingialld.</p>
 <p>"Good luck go with thy hand," says Kari.</p>
 <p>After that they rode both together to see Hjallti Skeggi's son, and told him the tidings. He took these deeds ill, and said there was the greatest need to ride after them and slay them all.</p>
 <p>After that he gathered men and roused the whole country; now he and Kari and Ingialld ride with this band to meet Mord Valgard's son, and they found him at Holtford, and Mord was there waiting for them with a very great company. Then they parted the hue and cry; some fared the straight road by the east coast to Selialandsmull, but some went up to Fleetlithe, and other-some the higher road thence to Threecorner Ridge, and so down into Godaland. Thence they rode north to Sand. Some too rode as far as Fishwaters, and there turned back. Some the coast road east to Holt, and told Thorgeir the tidings, and asked whether they had not ridden by there.</p>
 <p>"This is how it is," said Thorgeir, "though I am not a mighty chief, yet Flosi would take other counsel than to ride under my eyes, when he has slain Njal, my father's brother, and my cousins; and there is nothing left for any of you but e'en to turn back again, for ye should have hunted longer nearer home; but tell this to Kari, that he must ride hither to me and be here with me if he will; but though he will not come hither east, still I will look after his farm at Dyrholms if he will, but tell him too that I will stand by him and ride with him to the Althing. And he shall also know this, that we brothers are the next of kin to follow up the feud, and we mean so to take up the suit, that outlawry shall follow and after that revenge, man for man, if we can bring it about; but I do not go with you now, because I know naught will come of it, and they will now be as wary as they can of themselves."</p>
 <p>Now they ride back, and all met at Hof and talked there among themselves, and said that they had gotten disgrace since they had not found them. Alord said that was not so. Then many men were eager that they should fare to Fleetlithe, and pull down the homesteads of all those who had been at those deeds, but still they listened for Mord's utterance.</p>
 <p>"That," he said, "would be the greatest folly." They asked why he said that.</p>
 <p>"Because," he said, "if their houses stand, they will be sure to visit them to see their wives; and then, as time rolls on, we may hunt them down there; and now ye shall none of you doubt that I will be true to thee Kari, and to all of you, and in all counsel, for I have to answer for myself."</p>
 <p>Hjallti bade him do as he said. Then Hjallti bade Kari to come and stay with him, he said he would ride thither first. They told him what Thorgeir had offered him, and he said he would make use of that offer afterwards, but said his heart told him it would be well if there were many such.</p>
 <p>After that the whole band broke up.</p>
 <p>Flosi and his men saw all these tidings from where they were on the fell; and Flosi said, "Now we will take our horses and ride away, for now it will be some good."</p>
 <p>The sons of Sigfus asked whether it would be worth while to get to their homes and tell the news.</p>
 <p>"It must be Mord's meaning," says Flosi, "that ye will visit your wives; and my guess is, that his plan is to let your houses stand unsacked; but my plan is that not a man shall part from the other, but all ride east with me."</p>
 <p>So every man took that counsel, and then they all rode east and north of the Jokul, and so on till they came to Swinefell.</p>
 <p>Flosi sent at once men out to get in stores, so that nothing might fall short.</p>
 <p>Folsi never spoke about the deed, but no fear was found in him, and he was at home the whole winter till Yule was over.</p>
