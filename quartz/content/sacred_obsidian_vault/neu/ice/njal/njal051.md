 <h1 align="CENTER">51. OF GUNNAR</h1>
 <p>Gunnar rode to the Thing and all the sons of Sigfus; Njal and his sons too, they all went with Gunnar; and it was said that no band was so well knit and hardy as theirs.</p>
 <p>Gunnar went one day to the booth of the Dalemen; Hrut was by the booth and Hauskuld, and they greeted Gunnar well. Now Gunnar tells them the whole story of the suit up to that time.</p>
 <p>"What counsel gives Njal?" asks Hrut.</p>
 <p>"He bade me seek you brothers," says Gunnar, "and said he was sure that he and you would look at the matter in the same light."</p>
 <p>"He wishes then," says Hrut, "that I should say what I think for kinship's sake; and so it shall be. Thou shalt challenge Gizur the White to combat on the island, if they do not leave the whole award to thee; but Kolskegg shall challenge Geir the Priest. As for Otkell and his crew, men must be got ready to fall on them; and now we have such great strength all of us together, that thou mayst carry out whatever thou wilt."</p>
 <p>Gunnar went home to his booth and told Njal.</p>
 <p>"Just what I looked for," said Njal.</p>
 <p>Wolf Aurpriest got wind of this plan, and told Gizur, and Gizur said to Otkell, "Who gave thee that counsel that thou shouldst summon Gunnar?"</p>
 <p>"Skamkell told me that was the counsel of both Geir the Priest and thyself."</p>
 <p>"But where is that scoundrel?" says Gizur, "who has thus lied."</p>
 <p>"He lies sick up at our booth," says Otkell.</p>
 <p>"May he never rise from his bed," says Gizur. "Now we must all go to see Gunnar, and offer him the right to make his own award; but I know not whether he will take that now."</p>
 <p>Many men spoke ill of Skamkell, and he lay sick all through the Thing.</p>
 <p>Gizur and his friends went to Gunnar's booth; their coming was known, and Gunnar was told as he sat in his booth, and then they all went out and stood in array.</p>
 <p>Gizur the White came first, and after a while he spoke and said, "This is our offer--that thou, Gunnar, makest thine own award in this suit."</p>
 <p>"Then," says Gunnar, "it was no doubt far from thy counsel that I was summoned."</p>
 <p>"I gave no such counsel," says Gizur, "neither I nor Geir."</p>
 <p>"Then thou must clear thyself of this charge by fitting proof."</p>
 <p>"What proof dost thou ask?" says Gizur.</p>
 <p>"That thou takest an oath," says Gunnar.</p>
 <p>"That I will do," says Gizur, "if thou wilt take the award into thine own hands."</p>
 <p>"That was the offer I made a while ago," says Gunnar; "but now, methinks, I have a greater matter to pass judgment on."</p>
 <p>"It will not be right to refuse to make thine own award," said Njal; "for the greater the matter, the greater the honour in making it."</p>
 <p>"Well," said Gunnar, "I will do this to please my friends, and utter my award; but I give Otkell this bit of advice, never to give me cause for quarrel hereafter."</p>
 <p>Then Hrut and Hauskuld were sent for, and they came thither, and then Gizur the White and Gier the Priest took their oaths; but Gunnar made his award, and spoke with no man about it, and afterwards he uttered it as follows:</p>
 <p>"This is my award," he says; "first, I lay it down that the storehouse must be paid for, and the food that was therein; but for the thrall, I will pay thee no fine, for that thou hiddest his faults; but I award him back to thee; for as the saying is, 'Birds of a feather flock most together.' Then, on the other hand, I see that thou hast summoned me in scorn and mockery, and for that I award to myself no less a sum than what the house that was burnt and the stores in it were worth; but if ye think it better that we be not set at one again, then I will let you have your choice of that, but if so I have already made up my mind what I shall do, and then I will fulfil my purpose."</p>
 <p>"What we ask," said Gizur, "is that thou shouldst not be hard on Otkell, but we beg this of thee, on the other hand, that thou wouldst be his friend."</p>
 <p>"That shall never be," said Gunnar, "so long as I live; but he shall have Skamkell's friendship; on that he has long leant."</p>
 <p>"Well," answers Gizur, "we will close with thee in this matter, though thou alone layest down the terms."</p>
 <p>Then all this atonement was made and hands were shaken on it, and Gunnar said to Otkell, "It were wiser to go away to thy kinsfolk; but if thou wilt be here in this country, mind that thou givest me no cause of quarrel."</p>
 <p>"That is wholesome counsel," said Gizur; "and so he shall do."</p>
 <p>So Gunnar had the greatest honour from that suit, and afterwards men rode home from the Thing.</p>
 <p>Now Gunnar sits in his house at home, and so things are quiet for a while.</p>
