 <p align="center">F. --- THE SAGA OF EDWARD THE
 CONFESSOR.</p>

 <p align="center">EDWARD'S SAGA.</p>
 
 <p align="center"> </p>
 
 <p>         The saint king Edward in
 England was the son of Ethelred the son of Edgar, who was the first sole king
 over England.  Of him heard saint Dunstan the bishop the songs of angels
 in the air when he was born, with that token that in his days holy Christianity
 would find peace and prosperity in England.  The mother of saint Edward
 was queen Emma, daughter of Richard, duke of Normandy;  she was sister of
 Robert who was called "the Devil";  he left the dukedom and went
 into hermit's life.  Saint Edward loved straightway in his youth holy
 church and prayers, to visit cloisters, and to love those monks whom he thought
 holiest and most virtuous;  and also to give noble alms to those who were
 poor and needy.  He had always invocations to Almighty God and his saints
 in his prayers;  but he still honoured most of all after God our Lady, the
 holy Mary.  Next he had the apostle Peter as his special foster-father,
 and John the Evangelist as the guardian of that pure life which he kept all his
 days;  for so say men thoroughly learned in the matter that those three
 maids whom he took as his wives, one after the other, kept their virginity at
 his persuasion all their lives.  But after Robert, his mother's brother,
 who had sundered himself from rule, William his son took the dukedom in
 Normandy, who was called "bastard";  but for all that he was the
 son of a lawful wife, and his mother's name was Gunnhilda, daughter of king
 Edgar, and sister of king Ethelred;  but all the dukes in Normandy before
 him were sons of concubines, and for that he was called "bastard," like
 all his forefathers.  They made peace between them William the bastard and
 Baldwin the gentle count of Flanders, and the count gave his word to give him
 his daughter Matilda.  And when the duke came to the count's house to see
 the maiden, and he spoke to her blithely, and called her his "Amie,"
 then the lady answers "Mad art thou, tramp, when thou thinkest that I,
 come of a king's stock, could wish to be wedded to a bastard."  Then
 this young duke waxed wrath, and took her by the hair, and felled her to the
 earth, and trode her under foot, so speaking "I am not a bastard save by
 nickname."  After that he jumped on his horse and rode away in
 haste.  The count and his wife comforted the maiden, and prmised her that
 they would wed her within a month to a duke of Saxony.  The maiden answers
 "To no one will I be wedded in my life save to him to whom I was promised,
 for to my mind no one can be compared to him."  After that the count
 and his wife sent men after the duke to call him back.  The duke thought that
 they would take him back by force, and for that he hewed one of them asunder at
 the waist at one blow.  But they said that the count meant him naught but
 good, and confirmed that on their word.  Then the duke turned back with
 them to the castle, and the count made him good cheer, and at that meeting he
 made Matilda, his daughter, the betrothed bride of the duke, and kept their
 bridal with the greatest pomp.  And after that the duke fared home to
 Normandy.</p>
 
 <p>2.            Now we
 must tell of the saint king Edward that all Christains in England were glad at
 that freedom which they had got, after king Canute the mighty and his sons, in
 taking Edward as king, who was come from the rightful and old royal race in
 England;  for that in his crown holy church got freedom, and great men
 advancement, and the whole people peace and liberty, vikings and robbers
 lowering and chastisement.  Many things were remarkable in his life as to
 his tokens and prophecies, though we can tell few of them for lack of
 knowledge, and because we are so far off. (1)</p>
 
 <p>         It befell on a Whitsunday,
 in Peter's Church, at Westminster, when saint Edward was hearing high mass
 there, clad in his full royal robes, that when the priest lifted up our Lord's
 Body, such a burst of laughter came upon him that all wondered who were
 by.  After the mass men asked him, the king what was the cause of that
 strange laughter.  "The king of the Danes" answers the king,
 "was busking him with a countless host and a multitude of ships to harry
 our land, and just as he was stepping up into his ship from a boat, then he
 fell overboard and was drowned by God's rightful doom."  Then
 messengers were sent most speedily to Denmark, and all this was proved to be
 true tha the king had spoken.  But because this Dane-king is not named,
 then learned men in the king of Norway's realm think they cannot know for a
 surety who this king was;  except that according to the words of Gizur
 Hall's son, one of the wisest men in Iceland, it is said that this king must
 have been Sweyn, son of king Canute the mighty and Alfifa.</p>
 
 <p>         It so befell again on a
 third day of Yule, on the feast of John the Evangelist, as the king walked in
 the procession, clad in his royal robes, then he saw by him as it were a
 pilgrim come from Jerusalem in a fair garb, and that pilgrim begged the king to
 give him something;  but the king said he had nothing there that he could
 give him, "Give me something," said the pilgrim, "for the sake
 of that holy man whom thou lovest most."  Then the king called to
 mind John the Evangelist whose feast was then kept and gave the pilgrim his
 coronation ring, and then the pilgrim went away.  Next night after saint
 John was revealed to a noble captive Englishman, who had been nine winters a
 captive to the Saracens, and bade him tell the king of the English that it was
 John the Evangelist himself who had appeared to him on his highday, and bade
 him give the king his ring as a token that this was true, and that he might the
 less doubt what he said.  Then saint John bore him at one swoop and in a short
 time back to England to his own estates, and he was soon known by his wife,
 children, kinsmen, and housefolk;  and he rested that day by them. 
 But the morning after he fared to the king, and told the king, so that all men
 might hear who were in the house, those words which saint John had bidden him
 to tell the king.  He told also exactly how saint John had borne him and
 set him free in a moment from the grim thraldom of the Saracens.  This all
 wondered at who heard, and men especially kindled by this unheard of event to
 praise and love towards saint John the Apostle and Gospeller, and to saintly
 obedience towards the saint king Edward.</p>
 
 <p>         It was on a time on
 Easterday at Westminster, as the saint king Edward sat at the board, crowned in
 the midst of many chiefs;  but these were the most noble ---- earl Harold
 and a bishop and a mighty abbot.  The king cared more for heavenly than
 earthly things, so that he saw as in glass those wonderful things which brought
 on him loud laughter.  And when the boards had been cleared the chiefs
 asked at what he had laughed.  And so when they had long asked, then he
 answers.  The Seven Sleepers who rested on the Cælian Hill (2) have now
 lain two hundred years on their right sides;  but when I took to laughing
 they turned on their left sides, and so must they lie there four and eighty
 years.  And this is to mark the great lucklessness of mortal men, for in
 these four and eighty years those things will happen which God hath foretold,
 and which must be towards the world's end, that nation will rise against
 nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be great earthquakes and
 pestilences, famines, and terrors in the heavens;  for now will arise
 strife and war between heathen and Christian men;  but the Christian men
 will win by turns the victory over heathen men."  Many things saint
 Edward told them, which they wondered how he could know, both of the martyrdom
 of the Seven Sleepers and of their aspect, and most of things which stand
 written down before of them in no book;  and he told them so exactly as
 though he had often stood by the Seven Sleepers.  But those chiefs who
 heard that and were named before, Harold and the bishop and the abbot, sent
 their messengers --- the earl a knight, the bishop a clerk, and the abbot a
 monk ---- to the emperor at Micklegarth.  They had with them letters and
 presents from king Edward to the emperor in Micklegarth.  The emperor of
 Micklegarth received them worthily, and sent them to the bishop of Ephesus with
 his letters, which the Greeks called "sacram," that he should show
 the king of England's messengers the bodies of those holy Seven Sleepers. 
 And the bishop did so, and all was proved to the messengers just as the saint
 king Edward had told them.  The Greeks too said they were ready to swear
 that their forefathers had said that the Seven Sleepers lay on the right side;
 but now, as was proved for the sake of the messengers of those English chiefs,
 they lay on the left side.  After that happened speedily what king Edward
 had foretold of strife and other troubles in the world;  for Hagarenes,
 Arabs, and Turks raised great strife in Syria, Lycia, and Asia Minor, and
 wasted there many towns, Ephesus and Jerusalem seven years;  and after
 that next in other seven years three Popes died, Victor, Stephen, Nicholas.</p>
 
 <p>4.            Once on
 a time on a great highday when king Edward heard mass, and a bishop stood
 near.  And when the body of our Lord was lifted up it seemed to the king
 as though it were a young swain very fair.  He pointed this out to the
 bishop as it appeared to the king and him, but to no more of those who were
 near.</p>
 
 <p>         It befell on another time
 that king Edward sat on his throne, and that a cripple lay before the door of
 his lodging and said thus, that Peter the Apostle had sent him thither, and so
 spoken that the king himself should bear him to Peter's church, and then he
 would be a whole man.  But when this was told to king Edward he went to
 him, and heard himself from his mouth those his words.  And for his faith
 and humbleness sake, then he took the cripple up in his arms and bore him to
 Peter's church in London, and set him down there.  Then the cripple was
 made whole and upright as a leek.  All praised God who saw these miracles.</p>
 
 <p>         It so befell once on a time
 when king Edward sat at the board that three men came into his lodging, and two
 were blind but one had one eye, but yet saw little with that.  They begged
 the king to have pity on them, and told him their ailments.  King Edward
 bade them bring him the water in a bason in which he had washed his hands after
 meat, and bade them stroke their eyes with it.  And when they had done
 this they were whole on the spot, and went away joyfully, and had for the
 king's holiness got five eyes.  In the same way men got cured from the
 water in which he washed his hands, and when he passed his hands over them who
 were sick.</p>
 
 <p>5.            At that
 time when two of king Edward's lawful wives were dead, who both had kept their
 virginity at his exhortation, he took to him the third, and she was a daughter
 of earl Godwin, Ulfnad's son, a sister of Harold and Tosti and the other sons
 of Godwin.  Then that kinsfolk took great honours in England, and they all
 had the best earldoms in England.  So say the English men that Harold
 Godwin's son has been the boldest man found in England, and that he was the
 best knight both of new and old time.  King Edward had a young brother by
 the same mother;  but we cannot name the lad's father, but still he was a
 noble chief.  But this lad was called next to the kingdom in England after
 Edward if he should die sonless.  But when earl Godwin was aware of this
 from his daughter that she kept her virginity at the exhortation of king
 Edward, and they could have no son to take the realm after him, then he would
 lay his plans so that Harold his son should become king, who was then thought
 the man of most mark of all the English chiefs.  And about that time the
 king's brother took a sudden sickness and died, and there was then much talk
 what it was that brought this scathe on the lad. ---- It was on a highday that
 king Edward sat at his board, and earl Godwin sat on one side of him, and on
 the other sat a bishop.  And when a man bore in meat before the king, his
 foot tripped and stumbled as about to fall, but then he stamped down his other
 foot, and so steadied himself.  Then earl Godwin took to speaking, and
 said, "There now brother helped brother." (3) "My brother"
 answers the king "will not help me so," says he.  "May
 God," answers Godwin, "so let me thrive on this morsel which I now
 eat, as I had no hand in thy brother's death, though thou art ever misdoubting
 me of it."  After that he took the morsel from the dish and meant to
 eat it.  But the king took him by the arm at the wrist, and stretched it
 out to the bishop and said, "Lord bishop, bless."  The bishop
 did so.  After that earl Godwin put the bit into his mouth and ate, but
 when he wished to swallow it the bit stuck in his throat, so that it neither
 went up nor down, and of that he died there and then, and was dragged out of
 his highseat backwards, and thrown to birds of prey.  But still he was
 buried afterwards at church by the prayers of his friends and kinsfolk.</p>
 
 <p>6.            King
 Edward made up his mind after that that he thought duke William the bastard was
 next to the kingdom in England after him, both for this cause that he was come
 from the kings of the English, and because of the near kinship which was
 between them.  Once on a time when Edward had a conference with all the
 greatest chiefs, he made all take an oath to him;  first the sons of
 Godwin, and all the rest after them, that they would take no king after him but
 William the bastard.  But it was a little after that Harold Godwin's son
 fared on some business of his own south over the sea, and could not get back
 for the sake of foul winds.  Then he came to visit duke William, and
 stayed with him awhile.  Then he took an oath to William also that he
 would not hold the realm against him when they lost king Edward.  It is
 also some men's story that then he betrothed a daughter of the duke, and broke
 himself those bonds.</p>
 
 <p>         When king Edward had ruled
 England three and twenty years he was seated in London.  Then he took
 sickness at Yule, and calls to him many chiefs, and again gave it out that William
 was to be king after him in England.  But when the sickness began to press
 him so that he had little voice left, men say that Harold stooped over him and
 called men to witness afterwards that the king had given him the kingdom after
 him in England.  King Edward died a little after and was buried in London
 in Paul's church.  He shone by miracles straightway after his death as he
 did before, and lay in earth till saint Thomas the archbishop translated him
 and let them lay him in a worthy shrine.</p>
 
 <p>7.            For
 that Harold, Godwin's son, was of great family in England, and a very proper
 man in himself, but the rulers of the land thought it hard to come under the
 rule of outlandish lords, then they took Harold to be king, and he was
 consecrated under the crown as the custom was of English chiefs.  In this
 design his brother Tosti had no share, but he was older, and so he thought
 himself nearer to the kingdom.  Then he went to meet his brother Harold
 and claimed to be even with him, but when Harold said "nay" to that,
 then he fared out of the land and fled to Denmark to find king Sweyn, Wolf's
 son, his kinsman, and bade him fare to England and win the land under his rule
 "as the Dane kings of old had done."  But Sweyn was not ready to
 do that.  Then Tosti fared north into Norway and egged on king Harold,
 Sigurd's son, to fare to England and win the land under him.  And that
 same summer those two, king Harold and Tosti, fared to England with a host and
 slew Morcar, Godwin's son, but earl Gurth his brother fled out of the
 battle.  But a few nights afterwards they fought at Stamford-bridge with
 king Harold Godwin's son, and there they both fell, Harold and Tosti, as is
 said in the annals of the kings of Norway.</p>
 
 <p>         When William heard of the
 death of king Edward, and that Harold had let himself be chosen king in
 England, it liked him very ill, and he thought Harold had broken his oath and
 agreement with him;  then straightway he summoned all the chiefs he could
 get and a mighty host beside.  He made ready that force for England. 
 He came there just at the time when the two Harolds had fought.  Then he
 began to harry the land where he made the coast, and laid it under him wherever
 he went.  But when Harold, Godwin's son, heard that he fared against him,
 and their meeting was south by Helsingport, and either side had a very great
 host;  then earl Gurth spoke to his brother Harold and said, "I am
 afraid that it will not answer for thee to hold a battle against duke William
 because thou art bound by oaths to him, and thou hast sworn not to hold England
 against him."  King Harold answers, "May be brother thou art
 better fitted to fight with William, but I have not been wont to lie in a lair
 when other men have fought, and William the bastard shall not hear this that I
 dare not look him in the face."  After that king Harold made them set
 up his banner before him and went out to battle against William, and there was
 the greatest battle, and it seemed uncertain a long time which side would win
 the victory.  But as the fight went on the loss of men turned on the
 English side, and a great host fell there, and all fled who chose life. 
 There fell king Harold and his brother Gurth, but Valtheof their brother fled
 out of the fight.  William the bastard caused him to be burnt afterwards
 in a wood, and a hundred men with him.</p>
 
 <p>         It is the story of
 Englishmen that in the night after the battle of William and Harold some
 friends of king Harold fared to the battlefield and looked for his body, and
 found him alive, and bore him off to be healed;  he was cured in
 secret.  And when he was whole he would not strive with William for the
 kingdom.  And it is the story of many men that he has lived on all up to
 the days of Henry the old. (4)</p>
 
 <p>9.            William
 the bastard laid under him all England, and made himself be taken to be king
 and consecrated under the crown;  so he became the greatest prince. 
 But for all that his rule was very hateful to many men and chiefs in
 England;  and then the English chiefs who would not serve William send
 messages to Sweyn Wolf's son, the Dane-king, that he should come to England
 with a host of Danes, and they would fight against William, and come under king
 Sweyn.  But when William heard of those messages, then he sent south (?)
 to Denmark Godwin the young, Godwin's son, (5) and along with him a famous
 bishop.  They fared with he should not harry in his realm.  And for
 that same king Sweyn was turned back from faring with a host to England. 
 And so it went on for some years that William sent the Dane-king gifts, and so
 saved his kingdom.  And that is what the Danes rest on when they say that
 king Sweyn has ruled England after Hardicanute and Edward the good.</p>
 
 <p>10.       When the English chiefs were sure
 that the Danes would not help them against William --- but they had made up
 their minds that they would not abide under his rule --- then they left their
 estates and fled away from the land with a great host.  There were three
 earls and eight barons who were their leaders, and the formost of them was Sigurd
 earl of Gloucester.  But they had three hundred and fifty ships, and
 aboard them a great force many picked men.  They fared first south over
 the sea, and afterwards west off Mathewsness, and so further off Galicia-land,
 and thence they fared to Norva-sound and further across the sound to that
 capital which is called Septem.  They made an onslaught on the city and
 got it won;  they slew there a host of heathen men, but took so much fee
 in gold and silver that it was more even than what they had taken away with
 them from England;  and yet that was very great, because they had turned
 into money all the estates that they had in England.  Thence they held on
 east through Norva-sound and came to the isles, and won both of them, Majorica
 and Minorea.  After that they fared to Sicily.  And when they were
 come there then they heard great strife out of Micklegarth, and how heathen
 folk beleaguered the city both by sea and land.  Then Kirjalax the tall
 was emperor, and had just come to power.  That was some winters after the
 fall of king Harold, Godwin's son.  But when the Englishmen heard of
 strife out of Micklegarth they looked for great advancement, for of a long time
 ere that the Northmen had very great honour who went into service there. 
 Thence they held on east over the sea, and so north to Micklegarth, and came to
 the city in the night, but the stars gave some light.  They ran into
 battle at once against those who lay on ship board;  and there arose the
 greatest fight, and those who lay before the city had much the greater
 host.  But the Englishmen ran in so bravely that they got to board those
 ships that lay outermost and lay furthest from the land and the city walls, but
 they cleared each ship as they went on, and the crews were slain, though some
 jumped overboard.  Some too jumped on board other ships, and so the flight
 fared from ship to ship till they had won all the ships that did not fly
 away.  That folk which came to land ran to the tents, and said that an
 invincible host had come against which no wight could raise a shield. 
 Then all who were in the tents sprang up, and no other plan was taken than that
 each fled as he stood with what he could lay hold of.  But in the morning
 when it was light the folk of the city saw that all that host was gone which beleaguered
 the town;  but that many ships had come and rigged altogether otherwise
 than those which had been there before.  Then the men of the city sent men
 to the shipmen.  And after that they had a meeting with the king, and he
 took wonderfully well to them, and thanked them for that great victory which
 they had won to give him peace and safety.  They stayed a while in
 Micklegarth, and set the realm of the Greek king free from strife.  King
 Kirjalax offered them to abide there and guard his body, as was the wont of the
 Varangians who went into his pay, but it seemed to earl Sigurd and the other
 chiefs that it was too small a career to grow old there in that fashion, that
 they had not a realm to rule over;  and they begged the king to give them
 some towns or cities which they might own and their heirs after them.  But
 the king thought he could not strip other men of their estates.  And when
 they came to talk of this, king Kirjalax tells them that he knew of a land
 lying north in the sea, which had lain in old under the emperor of Micklegarth,
 but in after days the heathen had won it and abode in it.  And when the
 Englishmen heard that they took a title from king Kirjalax that that land
 should be their own and their heirs after them if they could get it won under
 them from the heathen men free from tax and toll.  The king granted them
 this.  After that the Englishmen fared away out of Micklegarth and north
 into the sea;  but some chiefs stayed behind in Micklegarth, and went into
 service there.                                                 
          Earl Sigurd and his men came
 to this land, and had many battles there, and got the land won, but drove away
 all the folk that abode there before.  After that they took the land into
 possession, and gave it a name, and called it England.  To the towns that
 were in the land and to those which they built they gave the names of the towns
 in England.  They called them both London and York, and by the names of
 other great towns in England.  They would not have St. Paul's law, which
 passes current in Micklegarth, but sought bishops and other clergymen in
 Hungary.  The land lies six days and nights' sail across the sea in the
 east and northeast from Micklegarth;  and there is the best of land
 there;  and that folk has abode there ever since.  Explicit.</p>
