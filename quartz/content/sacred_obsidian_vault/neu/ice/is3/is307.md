 <p align="center">FROM PETER CLAUSON UNDAL'S
 TRANSLATION OF THE LOST "INGA SAGA";  ALSO CALLED THE
 CROZIERMENS' SAGA.</p>
 
 <p align="center"> </p>
 
 <p>      There arose a great noise both among the
 Birchshanks and the Croziermen, for that there were many famous men who had
 lost all their goods and money in that feud.  Then that plan was devised
 that the summer after they should set off west into the Southern isles a sea
 roving, and get them goods and money again.  And they fitted out ships on
 both sides.  Peter Steypir and Reider the messenger who had to wife
 Margaret daughter of king Magnus, Erling's son, became brothers in arms that
 they might sail out to Jerusalem the next coming summer, and with that they
 parted. (12)  </p>
 
 <p>      Sometime after this atonement many asked
 leave on both sides;  some went home to their houses and farms, and some
 on trading voyages, and the next spring after then both Birchshanks and
 Croziermen sailed with twelve ships a sea roving in the Western lands and
 harried on the Southern isles, and the neighbouring isles, for the kings in
 those isles had domestic feud with one another.  They plundered the Holy
 Island (Iona) which the Northmen have always held sacred.  After that they
 fell out among one another and parted, and so were beaten in various
 places.  And they who came back to Norway were sharply spoken to by the
 bishops for their plunderings.</p>
 
 <p>      That summer Peter Steypir and Reider the
 messenger left the land with two big ships and much folk, and their wives
 Ingibjorg and Margaret king Magnus' daughter followed with them.  Of their
 journey much is told.  Peter Steypir and his wife died on the journey, but
 Reider got to Jerusalem and went back again to the Emperor in Constantinople,
 and served him long and died there.</p>
 
 <p>      In king Sverrir's time, Torald (!) the son of
 earl Maddad in Orkney with many more there in the isles had risen up against
 him, and called themselves the Island lads.  And when the earl became
 reconciled again to king Sverrir, then all the land tax and fines in suits from
 Orkney and Shetland were to fall to the king in Norway;  and the king set
 his bailiff by name Arni Löria with the earl in Orkney, and earl Harold durst
 not say a word against him so long as king Sverrir lived;  but straightway
 after his death he caused Arni Löria to be treacherously slain, and laid Orkney
 and Shetland under him again, with all scatts and dues just as he had them
 before;  and he died two years after king Ingi was made king in
 Norway.  After that his sons John and David became earls in Orkney, and
 they held the lands like their father so long as there was domestic feud in
 Norway;  but when they heard that the kings were reconciled they sent
 bishop Björn to Norway.  He found king Ingi and earl Hacon in Bergen, and
 made known to them the earls' errand that they desired to be reconciled to
 them;  and it got so far that he took leave on their behalf from the king
 and the earl, that the earls should come to them the summer after and be
 reconciled to them.</p>
 
 <p>      That summer when the vikings, that is Norse
 sea rovers, fared west over the sea, and after the kings' atonement, then the
 king's officers fared with him (the bishop) to Orkney and Shetland;  and
 the next summer after the earls and the bishop came with them to Norway to be reconciled
 with the king and the earl;  and they left the whole business to the good
 pleasure of the king and earl.  They doomed them to pay a large sum of
 money, and besides they had to give them pledges and hostages, and swear to
 them faithfulness and obedience;  but at last king Ingi made them his
 earls over Orkney and Shetland with such conditions as were afterwards kept
 until their deathday.</p>
 
 <p>      King Rognvald of Man in the Southern isles
 and Godred king of Man had not for a long time paid the kings of Norway
 taxes.  Now when the Norse vikings had swarmed about among the isles and
 plundered and burnt, and the kings learnt that peace was made in Norway, then
 they were afraid and set off to Norway, and were reconciled with king Ingi and
 earl Hacon, and paid the taxes which were owing, and swore faith and obedience
 to them, and took their lands as fiefs of the king of Norway, and so sailed
 home again.</p>
 
 <p>      There was a man called Erling in Fœroe, he
 gave himself out as king Sverrir's son;  his mother was Astrid the
 daughter of Roi.  He set out with some followers for the isles and wrought
 great wrong and strife.  He had seven children, and afterwards he sailed
 to Norway on board Einar the steward's ship, and betook himself to Philip and
 the Lady Christine.  She received him well and owned him for her
 brother;  and some years afterwards he died of bleeding after he had let
 himself be bled.</p>

 Fl., quoting some collection of annals, reads thus, "The death-day of earl
 Rognvald---Kali is five nights after Mary's mass the former , in summer."</p>

 Afreka ] She was sister of Duncan, earl of Fife.  When earl Harold
 quarrelled with the Scottish Court, during earl Rognvald's absence in the Holy
 Land, he repudiated her, and married Hvarflada, daughter of Malcolm McHeth,
 earl of Moray.  See below, ch. 119 comp. also Munch, N. H. iii. 847 note.</p>

 G. V. thinks that this passage from "So it was said" to "with
 God," is a later interpolation.</p>

 Harold the young]  This account of the latter years of earl Harold Maddad
 son's reign and of the doings of earl Harold the young is very confused, and
 the Saga disposes of the events of several years in a very summary way. 
 Fuller accounts are to be found in the Melrose Chronicle, in Fordun, and in
 Hoveden, Savile, Watts, p. 767.  These accounts very in some material
 points, but Munch, N. H. iv. 41, note, and 443, note, has done his best to
 reconcile them.</p>
 
 <p>11.             
 The slaying of earl Harold the younger is assigned in the Ann Island, to the
 year 1198;  cfr. Biskupass. i. 455 (fall Haralds jarls únga á Katanesi).</p>
 
 <p>12.             
 The Icelandic text to this first paragraph is preserved in the abridged Ingi's
 Saga in Eirspennil (Unger's Ed., p. 235).  The following is a translation
 of the passage: ---  "Then arose a noise in either band from those
 men who had lost their money and yet had titles to rank.  Then that
 counsel was taken that afterwards in the spring they should harry in the
 Southern isles and get them money.  Then men were chosen for this out of
 each band.  Then too they, Peter Steypir and Reider the messenger, also
 took counsel;  he, Reidar, had to wife Margaret, a daughter of king Magnus. 
 They proposed to fare out to Jerusalem.  Then they parted, having made
 this agreement."  And in another passage it is said:  ---
 "That summer they fared on a Viking voyage into the Southern isles,
 Thormod thasram and Thormod foal-leg, and Ospak the southislander.  These
 were of the Birchshanks.  But of the Croziermen was Eric Tofi's son and
 Erlend pike, Berg muncher, and Nicholas gilly.  They had twelve
 ships.  One winter later they fared away out of the land, Peter Steypir
 (the stouper, cup bearer?) and Reider, and had two ships.  And neither of
 them came back."  See Munch. N. H. III. 539-544.</p>
