 <i></i><p align="CENTER">How those of Skagafirth found Grettir on Drangey.</p>
 <p>NOW time wears on towards the winter solstice; then the bonders get ready to go fetch the fat beasts for slaughter from the island; so they manned a great barge, and every owner had one to go in his stead, and some two.</p>
 <p>But when these came anigh the island they saw men going about there; they deemed that strange, but guessed that men had been shipwrecked, and got aland there: so they row up to where the ladders were, when lo, the first-comers drew up the ladders.</p>
 <p>Then the bonders deemed that things were taking a strange turn, and hailed those men and asked them who they were: Grettir named himself and his fellows withal: but the bonders asked who had brought him there.</p>
 <p>Grettir answered, "He who owned the keel and had the hands, and who was more my friend than yours."</p>
 <p>The bonders answered and said, "Let us now get our</p>
 <p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a></p>
 <p>sheep, but come thou aland with us, keeping freely whatso of our sheep thou hast slaughtered."</p>
 <p>"A good offer," said Grettir, "but this time let each keep what he has got; and I tell you, once for all, that hence I go not, till I am dragged away dead; for it is not my way to let that go loose which I have once laid hand on."</p>
 <p>Thereat the bonders held their peace, and deemed that a woeful guest had come to Drangey: then they gave him choice of many things, both moneys and fair words, but Grettir said nay to one and all, and they gat them gone with things in such a stead, and were ill content with their fate; and told the men of the country-side what a wolf had got on to the island.</p>
 <p>This took them all unawares, but they could think of nought to do herein; plentifully they talked over it that winter, but could see no rede whereby to get Grettir from the island.</p>
