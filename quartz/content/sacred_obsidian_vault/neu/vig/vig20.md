 <b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc29619164">CHAPTER XVII</a></p>
 </font></b><p>WHEN Thorir died his son Thorarin set up his household to the north of Espihole and lived there. Glum had two children by his wife, of whom one was Márr, as has been said above, and the other was Vigfuss; both promising, but utterly unlike each other. Márr was quiet and silent, but Vigfuss was a dashing fellow, ready to do an unfair thing, strong and full of courage. There was a man living with Glum, who was called Hallvard, and was a freedman of his; he had brought Vigfuss up, and having got a good deal of property together by cheating in money matters , he had made over the reversion if it to his foster-child. Hallvard had a bad name, and went to live at a place called "The Tarns," in the valley of the Eyjafirth: nor did his reputation impove on account of the spot where he dwelt, for he was sharp in dealing with the cattle in the common pastures up there. Vigfuss was a great traveller<br>
         A man hight Halli lived at Jorunnarstad, who was called "Halli the white," and he was the son of Thorbiörn, whilst his mother was Vigdis, the daughter of Andun the bald. Now Halli had fostered Einar, the son of Eyiolf, who then lived at Saurbæ. Halli was blind, and was mixed up in all the lawsuits in the country because he was both a wise man and sound in his judgment. His sons were Orm and Brusi the Skald, who lived at Törfufell, and Bárd, who lived at Skállstad. Bárd was a noisy, quarrelsome fellow, better able to fight than anybody, and reckless and abusive in his language; he had for a wife Una, the daughter of Oddkell, in Thiorsádal.<br>
         One autumn Halli missed some ten or twelve wethers out of the hill pastures, and they could not be found, so when Bárd and his father met, Halli asked his son what he thought had become of the wethers. Bárd replied, "I dont wonder if sheep disappear, when a thief lives next door to you, ever since Hallvard came into the district. "Yes," says Halli, "I should like you to set on foot a suit against him, and summon him for theft. I dont think, if I make this charge against him, Glum will go the lengths of clearing him by the oath of twelve men." "No," answered Bárd, "it will be a difficult matter for him to get the oath of twelve men out of Glum and Vigfuss and their people."  <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
