 <b></b><p align="CENTER">16. The Violation of the Agreement</p>
 <p>Then it was that Medb despatched six men at one and the same time to attack Cuchulain, to wit: Traig ('Foot') and Dorn ('Fist') and Dernu ('Palm'), Col ('Sin') and Accuis ('Curse') and Eraisè ('Heresy'), three druid-men and three druid-women. Cuchulain attacked them, so that they fell at his hands. </p>
 <p>Forasmuch as covenant and terms of single combat had been broken with Cuchulain, Cuchulain took his sling in hand that day and began to shoot at the host from Delga ('the Little Dart') in the south. Though numerous were the men of Erin on that day, not one of them durst turn his face southwards towards Cuchulain, whether dog, or horse, or man. </p>
