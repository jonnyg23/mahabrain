 <h1 align="CENTER">CLIGES</h1>
 
 <h2 align="CENTER">Part III: Vv. 4575 - Vv. 6784</h2>
 
 
 (Vv. 4575-4628.)  Thus love harrows Fenice.  But this torment is
 her delight, of which she can never grow weary.  And Cliges now
 has crossed the sea and come to Wallingford.  There he took
 expensive quarters in great state.  But his thoughts are always
 of Fenice, not forgetting her for a single hour.  While he delays
 and tarries there, his men, acting under his instructions, made
 diligent inquiries.  They were informed that King Arthur's barons
 and the King in person had appointed a tourney to be held in the
 plain before Oxford, which lies close to Wallingford. (34)  There
 the struggle was arranged, and it was to last four days.  But
 Cliges will have abundant time to prepare himself if in the
 meantime he needs anything, for more than a fortnight must elapse
 before the tournament begins.  He orders three of his squires to
 go quickly to London and there buy three different sets of arms,
 one black, another red, the third green, and that on the way back
 each shall be kept covered with new cloth, so that if any one
 should meet them on the road he may not know the colour of the
 arms they carry.  The squires start at once and come to London,
 where they find available everything they need.  Having finished
 this errand, they return at once without losing any time.  When
 the arms they had brought were shown to Cliges he was well
 pleased with them.  He ordered them to be set away and concealed,
 together with those which the emperor had given him by the
 Danube, when he knighted him.  I do not choose to tell you now
 why he had them stored away; but it will be explained to you when
 all the high barons of the land are mounted on their steeds and
 assemble in search of fame.
 <p>
 (Vv. 4629-4726.)  On the day which had been agreed upon, the
 nobles of renown came together.  King Arthur, with all his men
 whom he had selected from among the best, took up his position at
 Oxford, while most of the knights ranged themselves near
 Wallingford.  Do not expect me to delay the story and tell you
 that such and such kings and counts were there, and that this,
 that, and the other were of the number. (35)  When the time came
 for the knights to gather, in accordance with the custom of those
 days, there came forth alone between two lines one of King
 Arthur's most valiant knights to announce that the tourney should
 begin.  But in this case no one dares to advance and confront him
 for the joust.  There is none who does not hold back.  And there
 are some who ask: "Why do these knights of ours delay, without
 stepping forward from the ranks?  Some one will surely soon
 begin."  And the others make reply: "Don't you see, then, what an
 adversary yonder party has sent against us?  Any one who does not
 know should learn that he is a pillar, (36) able to stand beside
 the best three in the world."  "Who is he, then?"  "Why, don't
 you see?  It is Sagremor the Wild."  "Is it he?"  "It surely is."
 Cliges listens and hears what they say, as he sits on his horse
 Morel, clad in armour blacker than a mulberry: for all his armour
 was black.  As he emerges from the ranks and spurs Morel free of
 the crowd, there is not one, upon seeing him, but exclaims to his
 neighbour: "That fellow rides well lance in rest; he is a very,
 skilful knight and carries his arms right handily; his shield
 fits well about his neck.  But he must be a fool to undertake of
 his own free will to joust with one of the most valiant knights
 to be found in all the land.  Who can he be?  Where was he born?
 Who knows him here?"  "Not I."  "Nor I."  "There is not a flake
 of snow on him; but all his armour is blacker far than the cloak
 of any monk or prior."  While thus they talk, the two contestants
 give their horses rein without delay, for they are very eager and
 keen to come together in the fight.  Cliges strikes him so that
 he crushes the shield against his arm, and the arm against his
 body, whereupon Sagremor falls full length.  Cliges goes
 unerringly and  bids him declare himself his prisoner, which
 Sagremor does at once.  Now the tourney is fairly begun, and
 adversaries meet in rivalry.  Cliges rushes about the field,
 seeking adversaries with whom to joust, but not a knight presents
 himself whom he does not cast down or take prisoner.  He excels
 in glory, all the knights on either side, for wherever he goes to
 battle, there the fight is quickly ended.  That man may be
 considered brave who holds his ground to joust with him, for it
 is more credit to dare face him than it is to defeat another
 knight.  And if Cliges leads him away prisoner, for this at least
 he gains renown that he dared to wait and fight with him.  Cliges
 wins the fame and glory of all the tournament.  When evening
 came, he secretly repaired to his lodging-place in order that
 none might have any words with him.  And lest any one should seek
 the house where the black arms are displayed, he puts them away
 in a room in order that no one may find them or see them, and he
 hangs up his green arms at the street-door, where they will be in
 evidence, and where passers-by will see them.  And if any one
 asks and inquires where his lodging is, he cannot learn when he
 sees no sign of the black shield for which he seeks.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4727-4758.)  By this ruse Cliges remains hidden in the town.
 And those who were his prisoners went from one end of the town to
 the other asking for the black knight, but none could give them
 any information.  Even King Arthur himself has search made up and
 down for him; but there is only one answer: "We have not seen him
 since we left the lists, and do not know what became of him."
 More than twenty young men seek him, whom the King sent out; but
 Cliges so successfully concealed himself that they cannot find a
 trace of him.  King Arthur is filled with astonishment when he is
 informed that no one of high or low degree can point out his
 lodging-place, any more than if he were in Caesarea, Toledo, or
 Crete.  "Upon my word," he says, "I know not what they may say,
 but to me this seems a marvellous thing.  Perchance it was a
 phantom that appeared in our midst.  Many a knight has been
 unhorsed, and noble men have pledged faith to one whose house
 they cannot find, or even his country or locality; each of these
 men perforce must fail to keep his pledge."  Thus the King spoke
 his mind, but he might as well have held his peace.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4759-4950.)  That evening among all the barons there was
 much talk of the black knight, for indeed they spoke of nothing
 else.  The next day they armed themselves again without summons
 and without request.  Lancelot of the Lake, in whom there is no
 lack of courage, rides forth with lance upright to await a
 contestant in the first joust.  Here comes Cliges tiding fast,
 greener than the grass of the field, and mounted on a fallow red
 steed, carrying its mane on the right-hand side.  Wherever Cliges
 spurs the horse, there is no one, either with hair or without,
 who does not look at him amazed and exclaim to his neighbour on
 either side: "This knight is in all respects more graceful and
 skilful than the one who yesterday wore the black arms, just as a
 pine is more beautiful than a white beech, and the laurel than
 the elder-bush.  As yet we know not who yesterday's victor was;
 but we shall know to-night who this man is."  Each one makes
 reply: "I don't know him, nor did I ever see him, that I am
 aware.  But he is fairer than he who fought yesterday, and fairer
 than Lancelot of the Lake.  If this man rode armed in a bag and
 Lancelot in silver and gold, this man would still be fairer than
 he."  Thus they all take Cliges' part.  And the two champions
 drive their steeds together with all the force of spur.  Cliges
 gives him such a blow upon the golden shield with the lion
 portrayed thereon that he knocks him down from his saddle and
 stands over him to receive his surrender.  For Lancelot there was
 no help; so he admitted himself his prisoner.  Then the noise
 began afresh with the shock of breaking lances.  Those who are on
 Cliges' side place all their confidence in him.  For of those
 whom he challenges and strikes, there is none so strong but must
 fall from his horse to earth.  That day Cliges did so well, and
 unhorsed and took captive so many knights, that he gave double
 the satisfaction to his side, and won for himself twice the glory
 that he had gained on the preceding day.  When evening came, he
 betook himself as fast as he could to his lodging-place, and
 quickly ordered out the vermilion shield and his other arms,
 while he ordered the arms which he had worn that day to be laid
 away: the host carefully put them aside.  Again that evening the
 knights whom he had captured sought for him, but without hearing
 any news of him.  In their lodging-places, most of those who
 speak of him do so with praise and admiration.  The next day the
 gay and doughty knights return to the contest.  From the Oxford
 side comes forth a vassal of great renown -- his name was
 Perceval of Wales.  As soon as Cliges saw him start, and learned
 certainly who it was, when he had heard the name of Perceval he
 was very anxious to contest with him.  He issued straightway from
 the ranks upon a Spanish sorrel steed, and completely clad in
 vermilion armour.  Then all gaze at him, wondering more than ever
 before, and saying that they had never seen so perfect a knight.
 And the contestants without delay spur forward until their mighty
 blows land upon their shields.  The lances, though they were
 short and stout, bend until they look like hoops.  In the sight
 of all who were looking on, Cliges struck Perceval so hard that
 he knocked him from his horse and made him surrender without a
 long struggle or much ado.  When Perceval had pledged his word
 then the joust began again, and the engagement became general.
 Every knight whom Cliges meets he forces to earth.  He did not
 quit the lists that day even for a single hour, while all the
 others struck at him as at a tower -- individually, of course,
 and not in groups of two or three, for such was not the custom
 then.  Upon his shield, as upon an anvil, the others strike and
 pound, splitting and hewing it to bits.  But every one who
 strikes him there, he pays back by casting him from his stirrups
 and saddle; and no one, unless he wished to lie, could fail to
 say when the jousting ceased that the knight with the red shield
 had won all the glory on that day.  And all the best and most
 courtly knights would fain have made his acquaintance.  But their
 desire was not felt before he had departed secretly, seeing the
 sun already set; and he had his vermilion shield and all his
 other harness removed, and ordered his white arms to be brought
 out, in which he had first been dubbed a knight, while the other
 arms and the steeds were fastened outside by the door.  Those who
 notice this realise and exclaim that they have all been defeated
 and undone by one single man; for each day he has disguised
 himself with a different horse and set of armour, thus seeming to
 change his identity; for the first time now they noticed this.
 And my lord Gawain proclaimed that he never saw such a champion,
 and therefore he wished to make his acquaintance and learn his
 name, announcing that on the morrow he himself will be the first
 at the rally of the knights.  Yet, withal, he makes no boast; on
 the other hand, he says that he fully expects the stranger knight
 will have all the advantage with the lance; but it may be that
 with the sword he will not be his superior (for with the sword
 Gawain had no master).  Now it is Gawain's desire to measure his
 strength on the morrow with this strange knight who changes every
 day his arms, as well as his horse and harness.  His moultings
 will soon be numerous if he continues thus each day, as is his
 custom, to discard his old and assume new plumage.  Thus, when he
 thought of the sword and the lance respectively. Gawain
 disparaged and esteemed highly the prowess of his foe.  The next
 day he sees Cliges come back whiter than the fleur-delis, his
 shield grasped tight by the inside straps and seated on his white
 Arab steed, as he had planned the night before.  Gawain, brave
 and illustrious, seeks no repose on the battleground, but spurs
 and rides forward, endeavouring as best he may to win honour in
 the fray, if he can find an opponent.  In a moment they will both
 be on the field.  For Cliges had no desire to hold back when he
 overheard the words of the men who said: "There goes Gawain, who
 is no weakling either on foot or ahorse.  He is a man whom no one
 will attack."  When Cliges hears these words, he rushes toward
 him in mid-field; they both advance and come together with a
 swifter leap than that of the stag who hears the sound of the
 dogs as they come baying after him.  The lances are thrust at the
 shields, and the blows produce such havoc that the lances split,
 crack and break clear down to the butt-end, and the saddle-bows
 behind give away, and the girths and breast-straps snap.  Both
 come to earth at once and draw their naked swords, while the
 others gather round to watch the battle.  Then King Arthur
 stepped forward to separate them and establish peace.  But before
 the truce was sworn, the white hauberks were badly torn and rent
 apart, the shields were cracked and hewed to bits, and the
 helmets crushed.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4951-5040.)  The King viewed them with pleasure for a while,
 as did many others who said that they esteemed the white knight's
 deeds of arms no less than those of my lord Gawain, and they were
 not ready yet to say which was the better and which the worse,
 nor which was likely to win, if they had been allowed to fight to
 a finish; but it did not please the King to let them do more than
 they had done.  So he stepped forward to separate them, saying:
 "Stop now!  Woe if another blow be struck!  Make peace now, and
 be good friends.  Fair nephew Gawain, I make this request of you;
 for without resentment and hate it is not becoming for a
 gentleman to continue to fight and defy his foe.  But if this
 knight would consent to come to my court and join our sport it
 would not be to his sorrow or hurt.  Nephew, make this request of
 him."  "Gladly, my lord."  Cliges has no desire to refuse, and
 gladly consents to go when the tourney is concluded.  For now he
 has more than sufficiently carried out the injunction of his
 father.  And the King says he has no desire that the tournament
 shall last too long, and that they can afford to stop at once. 
 So the knights drew off, according to the wish and order of the
 King.  Now that he is to follow in the royal suite, Cliges sends
 for all his armour.  As soon as he can, he comes to court; but
 first, he completely changed his gear, and came dressed in the
 style of the French.  As soon as he arrived at court, all ran to
 meet him without delay, making such joy and festival that never
 was there greater seen, and all those call him lord whom he had
 captured in the joust; but he would hear none of this, and said
 they might all go free, if they were quite sure and satisfied
 that it was he who had captured them.  And there was not one who
 did not cry: "You were the man; we are sure of that!  We value
 highly your acquaintance, and we ought to love and esteem you and
 call you our lord, for none of us can equal you.  Just as the sun
 outshines the little stars, so that their light cannot be seen in
 the sky when the sun's rays appear, so is our prowess
 extinguished and abased in the presence of yours, though ours too
 was once famous in the world."  Cliges knows not what to reply,
 for in his opinion they all praise him more than he deserves; it
 pleases him, but he feels ashamed, and the blood rises in his
 face, revealing to all his modesty.  Escorting him into the
 middle of the hall, they led him to the King, where all ceased
 their words of compliment and praise.  The time for the meal had
 come, and those whose duty it was hastened to set the tables. 
 The tables in the hall were quickly spread, then while some took
 the towels, and others held the basins, they offered water to all
 who came.  When all had washed, they took their seats.  And the
 King, taking Cliges by the hand, made him sit down in front of
 him, for he wished to learn this very day, if possible, who he
 was.  Of the meal I need not further speak, for the courses were
 as well supplied as if beef were selling at a penny.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5041-5114.)  When all the courses had been served, the King
 no longer held his peace.  "My friend," he says, "I wish to learn
 if it was from pride that you did not deign to come to court as
 soon as you arrived in this country, and why you kept aloof from
 people, and why you changed your arms; and tell me what your name
 is, too, and from what race you spring."  Cliges replies: "It
 shall not be hid."  He told and related to the King everything he
 wished to know.  And when the King had heard it all, he embraced
 him, and made much of him, while all joined in greeting him.  And
 when my lord Gawain learned the truth, he, more than the others,
 cordially welcomed him.  Thus, all unite in saluting him, saying
 that he is very fair and brave.  The King loves and honours him
 above all his nephews.  Cliges tarries with the King until the
 summer comes around, in the meantime visiting all Brittany,
 France, and Normandy, where he did so many knightly deeds that he
 thoroughly proved his worth.  But the love whose wound he bears
 gives him no peace or relief.  The inclination of his heart keeps
 him fixed upon a single thought.  To Fenice his thought harks
 back, who from afar afflicts his heart.  The desire takes him to
 go back; for he has been deprived too long of the sight of the
 most desired lady who was ever desired by any one.  He will not
 prolong this privation, but prepares to return to Greece, and
 sets out, after taking leave.  The King and my lord Gawain were
 grieved, I can well believe, when they could no longer detain
 him.  But he is anxious to return to her whom he loves and so
 covets that the way seems long to him as he passes over land and
 sea: so ardently he longs for the sight of her who has stolen and
 filched Iris heart away.  But she makes him recompense in full;
 for she pays him, as it were rent, the coin of her own heart,
 which is no less dear to her.  But he is by no means sure of
 that, having no contract or agreement to show; wherefore his
 anxiety is great.  And she is in just as great distress, harried
 and tormented by love, taking no pleasure in aught she sees since
 that moment when she saw him last.  The fact that she does not
 even know whether he be alive or not fills her heart with
 anguish.  But Cliges draws nearer day by day, being fortunate in
 having favourable winds, until he joyfully comes to port before
 Constantinople.  When the news reached the city, none need ask if
 the emperor was glad; but a hundred times greater was the
 empress's joy.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5115-5156.)  Cliges, with his company, having landed at
 Constantinople, has now returned to Greece.  The richest and most
 noble men all come to meet him at the port.  And when the emperor
 encounters him, who before all others had gone to meet him with
 the empress by his side, he runs to embrace and greet him in the
 presence of them all.  And when Fenice welcomes him, each changes
 colour in the other's presence, and it is indeed a marvel, when
 they are so close together, how they keep from embracing each
 other and bestowing such kisses as love would have; but that
 would have been folly and madness.  The people come together from
 all sides with the desire to see him, and conduct him through the
 city, some on foot and some on horseback, until they bring him to
 the imperial palace.  No words can ever tell the joy and honour
 and courteous service that were there displayed.  But each one
 strove as best he might to do everything which he thought would
 please and gratify Cliges.  And his uncle hands over to him all
 his possessions, except the crown: he wishes him to gratify his
 pleasure fully, and to take all he desires of his wealth, either
 in the form of land or treasure.  But he has no care for silver
 or gold, so long as he dares not reveal his thoughts to her
 because of whom he can find no repose; and yet he has plenty of
 time and opportunity to speak, if he were not afraid of being
 repelled; for now he can see her every day, and sit beside her
 "tete-a-tete" without opposition or hindrance, for no one sees
 any harm in that.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5157-5280.)  Some time after his return, he came alone one
 day to the room of her who was not his enemy, and you may be sure
 that the door was not barred at his approach.  By her side he
 took his seat, while the others moved away, so that no one might
 be seated near them and hear their words.  First, Fenice spoke of
 Britain, and asked him about the character and appearance of my
 lord Gawain, until her words finally hit upon the subject which
 filled her with dread.  She asked him if he had given his love to
 any dame or damsel in that land.  Cliges was not obstinate or
 slow to respond to this demand, but he knew at once what reply to
 make as soon as she had put the question.  "Lady," he says, "I
 was in love while there, but not with any one of that land.  In
 Britain my body was without my heart, as a piece of bark without
 the wood.  Since leaving Germany I have not known what became of
 my heart, except that it came here after you.  My heart was here,
 and my body was there.  I was not really away from Greece; for
 hither my heart had come, for which I now have come back again;
 yet, it does not return to its lodging-place, nor can I draw it
 back to me, nor do I wish to do so, if I could.  And you -- how
 has it fared with you, since you came to this country?  What joy
 have you had here?  Do you like the people, do you like the land?
 I ought not to ask you any other question than whether the
 country pleases you."  "It has not pleased me until now; but at
 present I feel a certain joy and satisfaction, which, you may be
 sure, I would not lose for Pavia or Piacenza.  From this joy I
 cannot wrest my heart, nor shall I ever use force in the attempt.
 Nothing but the bark is left in me, for I live and exist without
 a heart.  I have never been in Britain, and yet without me my
 heart has been engaged in business there I know not what." 
 "Lady, when was it that your heart was there?  Tell me when it
 went thither -- the time and season -- if it be a thing that you
 can fairly tell me or any one else.  Was it there while I was
 there?"  "Yes, but you were not aware of it.  It was there as
 long as you were, and came away again with you."  "God!  I never
 saw it, nor knew it was there.  God!  why did I not know it?  If
 I had been informed of this, surely, my lady, I would have borne
 it pleasant company."  "You would have repaid me with the
 consolation which you really owed to me, for I should have been
 very gracious to your heart if it had been pleased to come where
 it might have known I was."  "Lady, surely it came to you."  "To
 me?  Then it came to no strange place, for mine also went to
 you."  "Then, lady, according to what you say, our hearts are
 here with us now, for my heart is altogether in your hands." 
 "You in turn have mine, my friend; so we are in perfect accord.
 And you may be sure, so help me God, that your uncle has never
 shared in me, for it was not my pleasure,  and he could not.
 Never has he yet known me as Adam knew his wife.  In error I am
 called a wife; but I am sure that whoever calls me wife does not
 know that I am still a maid.  Even your uncle is not aware of it,
 for, having drunk of the sleeping potion, he thinks he is awake
 when he is asleep, and he fancies he has his sport with me while
 I lie in his embrace.  But his exclusion has been complete.  My
 heart is yours, and my body too, and from me no one shall ever
 learn how to practise villainy.  For when my heart went over to
 you it presented you with the body too, and it made a pledge that
 none other should ever share in it.  Love for you has wounded me
 so deep that I should never recover from it, any more than the
 sea can dry up.  If I love you, and you love me, you shall never
 be called Tristan, nor I Iseut; (37) for then our love would not
 be honourable.  But I make you this promise, that you shall never
 have other joy of me than that you now have, unless you can
 devise some means whereby I can be removed from your uncle and
 his society without his finding me again, or being able to blame
 either you or me, or having any ground for accusation.  And
 to-morrow you shall tell me of the best plan you have devised,
 and I, too, will think of it.  To-morrow, as soon as I arise,
 come and speak with me; then each of us will speak his mind, and
 we shall proceed to execute whatever seems best.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5281-5400.)  As soon as Cliges heard her will he fully
 agreed with her, and said that would be the best thing to do.  He
 leaves her happy, and goes off with a light heart himself.  That
 night each one lies awake thinking over, with great delight, what
 the best plan will be.  The next morning, as soon as they had
 arisen, they meet again to take counsel privately, as indeed they
 must.  Cliges speaks first and says what he had thought of in the
 night: "My lady," says he, "I think, and am of the opinion, that
 we could not do better than go to Britain; I thought I might take
 you there; now do not refuse, for never was Helen so joyfully
 received at Troy when Paris took her thither but that still
 greater joy would be felt over you and me in the land of the
 King, my uncle.  And if this plan does not meet with your favour,
 tell me what you think, for I am ready, whatever may happen, to
 abide by your decision."  And she replies: "This is my answer: I
 will never go off with you thus; for after we had gone away,
 every one would speak of us as they do of Iseut the Blond and of
 Tristan.  And everywhere all men and women would speak evil of
 our love.  No one would believe, nor is it natural that they
 should do so, the truth of the matter.  Who would believe that I
 have thus, all to no purpose, evaded and escaped from your uncle
 still a maid?  I should be regarded simply as wanton and
 dissolute, and you would be thought mad.  It is well to remember
 and observe the injunction of St. Paul: if any one is unwilling
 to live chaste, St. Paul counsels him to act so that he shall
 receive no criticism, or blame, or reproach. (38)  It is well to
 stop evil mouths, and therefore, if you agree, I have a proposal
 to make: it seems best to me to consent to feign that I am dead. 
 I shall fall sick in a little while.  And you in the meantime may
 plan some preparations for a place of burial.  Put all your wits
 to work to the end that a sepulchre and bier be so constructed
 that I shall not die in it, or be stifled, and that no one shall
 mount guard over it at night when you come to take me out.  So
 now seek such a retreat for me, where no one may see me excepting
 you; and let no one provide for any need of mine except you, to
 whom I surrender and give myself.  Never, my whole life long, do
 I wish to be served by other man than you.  My lord and my
 servant you shall be; whatever you do shall seem good to me; and
 never shall I be mistress of any empire unless you are its
 master.  Any wretched place, however dark and foul, will seem
 brighter to me than all these halls if you are with me.  If I
 have you where I can see you, I shall be mistress of boundless
 treasure, and the world will belong to me.  And if the business
 is carefully managed, no harm will come of it, and no one will
 ever be able to speak ill of it, for it will be believed
 throughout the empire that I am mouldering in the ground.  My
 maid, Thessala, who has been my nurse, and in whom I have great
 confidence, will give me faithful aid, for she is very clever,
 and I trust her fully."  And Cliges, when he heard his
 sweetheart, replies: "My lady, if this is feasible, and if you
 think your nurse's advice reliable, we have nothing to do but
 make our preparations without delay; but if we commit any
 imprudence, we are lost without escape.  In this city there is an
 artisan who cuts and carves wonderful images: there is no land
 where he is not known for the figures which he has shapen and
 carved and made.  John is his name, and he is a serf oú mine.  No
 one could cope with John's best efforts in any art, however
 varied it might be.  For, compared with him, they are all
 novices, and like a child with nurse.  By imitating his handiwork
 the artisans of Antioch and Rome have learned all they know how
 to do -- and besides there is no more loyal man.  Now I want to
 make a test, and if I can put trust in him I will set him and all
 his descendants free; and I shall not fail to tell him of all our
 plan if he will swear and give his word to me that he will aid me
 loyally, and will never divulge my secret."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5401-5466.)  And she replies: "So let it be."  With her
 permission Cliges left the room and went away.  And she sends for
 Thessala, her maid, whom she brought with her from her native
 land.  Thessala came at once without delay, yet not knowing why
 she was summoned.  When she asked Fenice privately what was her
 desire and pleasure, she concealed none of her intentions from
 her.  "Nurse," she said, "I know full well that anything I tell
 you will go no further, for I have tried you thoroughly and have
 found you very prudent.  I love you for all you have done for me.
 In all my troubles I appeal to you without seeking counsel
 elsewhere.  You know why I lie awake, and what my thoughts and
 wishes are.  My eyes behold only one object which pleases me, but
 I can have no pleasure or joy in it if I do not first buy it with
 a heavy price.  For I have now found my peer; and if I love him
 he loves me in return, and if I grieve he grieves too for my pain
 and sorrow.  Now I must acquaint you with a plan and project upon
 which we two have privately agreed."  Then she told and explained
 to her how she was willing to feign illness, and would complain
 so bitterly that at last she would pretend to be dead, and how
 Cliges would steal her away at night, and then they would be
 together all their days.  She thinks that in no other way she
 could longer bear to live.  But if she was sure that she would
 consent to lend her aid, the matter would be arranged in
 accordance with their wishes.  "But I am tired of waiting for my
 joy and luck."  Then her nurse assured her that she would help
 her in every way, telling her to have no further fear.  She said
 that as soon as she set to work she would bring it about that
 there would be no man, upon seeing her, who would not certainly
 believe that the soul had left the body after she had drunk of a
 potion which would leave her cold, colourless, pale, and stiff,
 without power of speech and deprived of health; yet she would be
 alive and well, and would have no sensations of any kind, and
 would be none the worse for a day and a night entire spent in the
 sepulchre and bier. (39)
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5467-5554.)  When Fenice heard these words, she thus spoke
 in reply: "Nurse, I commit myself to you, and, with full
 confidence in you, will take no steps in my own behalf.  I am in
 your hands; so think of my interests, and tell all the people who
 are here to betake themselves away, for I am ill, and they bother
 me."  So, like a prudent woman, she said to them: "My lords, my
 lady is not well, and desires you all to go away.  You are
 talking loud and making a noise, and the noise is disagreeable to
 her.  She can get no rest or repose so long as you are in the
 room.  I never remember her to have complained of such a sickness
 as this so violent and serious does it seem.  So go away, and
 don't feel hurt."  As soon as she had issued this command, they
 all quickly go away.  And Cliges sent for John to come quickly,
 and thus in private spoke to him: "John, dost thou know what I am
 about to say?  Thou art my slave and I thy master, and I can give
 away or sell thy body like a thing which is my own.  But if I
 could trust thee in an affair I meditate, thou wouldst go for
 ever free, as well as the heirs which may be born of thee." 
 John, in his desire for freedom, replies at once: "My lord, there
 is nothing I would not gladly do to see myself, my wife, and
 children free.  Tell me what your orders are, for nothing can be
 so hard as to cause me any work or pain or be hard for me to
 execute.  For that matter, even were it against my will, I must
 needs obey your commands and give up my own affairs."  "True,
 John; but this is a matter of which I hardly dare to speak,
 unless thou wilt assure me upon thy oath thou wilt faithfully
 give me aid and never betray me."  "Willingly, sire," John makes
 reply: "have never a fear on that account!  For I will swear and
 pledge my word that, so long as I live, I will never say a word
 which I think will grieve you or cause you harm."  "Ah John, even
 were I to die for it, there is no man to whom I would dare
 mention the matter in which I desire thy counsel; I would rather
 have my eye plucked out; I would rather be put to death by thee
 than that thou shouldst speak of it to another man.  But I hold
 thee to be so loyal and prudent that I will reveal to thee all my
 thought.  I am sure thou wilt observe my wishes, both by aiding
 me and holding thy peace."  "Truly, sire so, help me God!"  Then
 Cliges speaks and explains to him openly the adventurous plan.
 And when he had revealed the project -- as you have heard me set
 it forth -- then John said that he would promise to construct the
 sepulchre in accordance with his best skill, and said that he
 would take him to see a certain house of his which no one yet had
 ever seen -- not even his wife or any child of his.  This house,
 which he had built, he would show him, if he cared to go with him
 to the place where in absolute privacy he works and paints and
 carves.  He would show him the finest and prettiest place that he
 had ever seen.  Cliges replies: "Let us go thither then."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5555-5662.)  Below the city, in a remote spot, John had
 expended much labour in the construction of a tower.  Thither he
 conducted Cliges, leading him through the different storeys,
 which were decorated with fine painted pictures.  He shows him
 the rooms and the fire-places, taking him everywhere up and down.
 Cliges examines this lonely house where no one lives or has
 access.  He passes from one room to another, until he thinks he
 has seen it all, and he is much pleased with the tower and says
 he thinks it is very fine.  The lady will be comfortable there as
 long as she lives, for no one will know of her dwelling place.
 "No sire, you are right; she will never be discovered here.  But
 do you think you have seen all of my tower and fair retreat?
 There still remain rooms so concealed that no man could ever find
 them out.  And if you choose to test the truth of this by
 investigating as thoroughly as you can, you can never be so
 shrewd and clever in your search as to find another story here,
 unless I show you and point it out.  You must know that baths are
 not lacking here, nor anything else which a lady needs, and which
 I can think of or recall.  The lady will be here at her ease.
 Below the level of the ground the tower widens out, as you will
 see, and you cannot anywhere find any entrance-door.  The door is
 made of hard stone with such skill and art that you cannot find
 the crack."  Cliges says: "These are wonderful things I hear.
 Lead on and I will follow you, for I am anxious to see all this."
 Then John started on, taking Cliges by the hand, until he came to
 a smooth and polished door, all coloured and painted over.  When
 John came to the wall, he stopped, holding Cliges by the right
 hand.  "Sire," he says, "there is no one who could see a window
 or a door in this wall; and do you think that any one could pass
 through it without using violence and breaking it down?"  And
 Cliges replies that he does not think so, and that he will never
 think so, unless he sees it first.  Then John says that he shall
 see it at once, and that he will open a door in the wall for him.
 John, who constructed this piece of work, unfastens the door in
 the wall and opens it for him, so that he has to use no strength
 or violence to force it; then, one stepping before the other,
 they descend by a winding-stair to a vaulted apartment where John
 used to do his work, when it pleased him to labour at anything.
 "Sire," he says, "of all the men God ever made, no one but us two
 has ever been where we are now.  And you shall see presently how
 convenient the place is.  My advice is that you choose this as
 your retreat, and that your sweetheart be lodged here.  These
 quarters are good enough for such a guest; for there are
 bedrooms, and bathrooms with hot water in the tubs, which comes
 through pipes under the ground.  Whoever is looking for a
 comfortable place in which to establish and conceal his lady,
 would have to go a long way before he would find anything so
 charming.  When you shall have explored it thoroughly you will
 find this place very suitable."  Then John showed him everything,
 fine chambers and painted vaults, pointing out many examples of
 his work which pleased Cliges much.  When they had examined the
 whole tower, Cliges said: "John, my friend, I set you free and
 all your descendants, and my life is absolutely in your hands.  I
 desire that my sweetheart be here all alone, and that no one
 shall know of it excepting me and you and her."  John makes
 answer: "I thank you, sire.  Now we have been here long enough,
 and as we have nothing more to do, let us return."  "That is
 right," says Cliges, "let us be gone."  Then they go away, and
 leave the tower.  Upon their return they hear every one in the
 city saying to his neighbour: "Don't you know the marvellous news
 about my lady, the empress?  May the Holy Spirit give her health
 -- the gentle and prudent lady; for she lies sick of a grievous
 malady."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5663-5698.)  When Cliges heard this talk he went in haste to
 the court.  But there was no joy or gladness there: for all the
 people were sad and prostrated because of the empress, who is
 only feigning to be ill; for the illness of which she complains
 causes her no grief or pain.  But she has told them all that she
 wishes no one to enter her room so long as her sickness maintains
 its grip with its accompanying pains in her heart and head.  She
 makes an exception, however, in favour of the emperor and his
 nephew, not wishing to place a ban upon them; but she will not
 care if the emperor, her lord, does not come.  For Cliges' sake
 she is compelled to pass through great pain and peril.  It
 distresses her that he does not come, for she has no desire to
 see any one but him.  Cliges, however, will soon be there, to
 tell her of what he has seen and found.  He came into the room
 and spoke to her, but stayed only a moment, for Fenice, in order
 that they might think she was annoyed by what pleased her so,
 cried out aloud: "Be gone, be gone!  You disturb and bother me
 too much, for I am so seriously ill that I shall never rise up
 again."  Cliges, though pleased with this, goes away with a sad
 face: you would never see so woeful a countenance.  To judge from
 his appearance he is very sad; but within his heart is gay in
 anticipation of its joy.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5699-5718.)  The empress, without being really ill,
 complains and pretends that she is sick.  And the emperor, who
 has faith in her, ceases not to grieve, and summons a physician.
 But she will not allow any one to see her or touch her.  The
 emperor may well feel chagrined when she says that she will never
 have but one doctor, who can easily restore her to health
 whenever it pleases him to do so.  He can cause her to die or to
 live, and to him she trusts her health and life.  They think that
 she refers to God; but her meaning is very different, for she is
 thinking of no one but Cliges.  He is her god who can bring her
 health, or who can cause her death.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5719-5814.)  Thus the empress takes care that no physician
 shall examine her; and more completely to deceive the emperor she
 refuses to eat or drink, until she grows all pale and blue.
 Meanwhile her nurse keeps busy about her, and with great
 shrewdness sought privily all through the city, without the
 knowledge of any one, until she found a woman who was hopelessly
 ill with a mortal disease.  In order to perfect her ruse she used
 to go to see her often and promised to cure her of her illness;
 so each day she used to take a urinal in which to examine the
 urine, until she saw one day that no medicine could ever be of
 any help, and that she would die that very day.  This urine
 Thessala carried off and kept until the emperor arose, when she
 went to him and said: "If now it be your will, my lord, send for
 all your physicians; for my mistress has passed some water; she
 is very ill with this disease, and she desires the doctors to see
 it, but she does not wish them to come where she is."  The
 doctors came into the hall and found upon examination that the
 urine was very bad and colourless, and each one said what he
 thought about it.  Finally, they all agreed that she would never
 recover, and that she would scarcely live till three o'clock,
 when, at the latest, God would take her soul to Himself.  This
 conclusion they reached privately, when the emperor asked and
 conjured them to tell him the truth.  They reply that they have
 no confidence in her recovery, and that she cannot live past
 three o'clock but will yield up her soul before that time.  When
 the emperor heard this, he almost fell unconscious to the floor,
 as well as many others who heard the news.  Never did any people
 make such moan as there was then throughout the palace.  However,
 I will speak no further of their grief; but you shall hear of
 Thessala's activities -- how she mixes and brews the potion.  She
 mixed and stirred it up, for she had provided herself a long time
 in advance with everything which she would need for the potion. 
 A little before three o'clock she gives her the potion to drink.
 At once her sight became dimmed, her face grew as pale and white
 as if she had lost her blood: she could not have moved a foot or
 hand, if they had flayed her alive, and she does not stir or say
 a word, although she perceives and hears the emperor's grief and
 the cries which fill the hall.  The weeping crowds lament through
 all the city, saying:  "God! what woe and misfortune has been
 brought upon us by wicked death!  O covetous and voracious death!
 Death is worse than a she-wolf which always remains insatiable.
 Such a cruel bite thou hast never inflicted upon the world!
 Death, what hast thou done?  May God confound thee for having put
 out the light of perfect beauty!  Thou hast done to death the
 fairest and most lovely creature, had she but lived, whom God has
 ever sought to form.  God's patience surely is too great when He
 suffers thee to have the power to break in pieces what belongs to
 Him.  Now God ought to be wroth with thee, and cast thee out of
 thy bailiwick; for thy impudence has been too great, as well as
 thy pride and disrespect."  Thus the people storm about and wring
 their arms and beat their hands; while the priests read their
 psalms, making prayers for the good lady, that God may have mercy
 on her soul.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5815-5904.)  (40) In the midst of the tears and cries, as
 the story runs, there arrived aged physicians from Salerno, where
 they had long sojourned.  At the sight of the great mourning they
 stopped to ask and inquire the cause of the cries and tears --
 why all the people are in such sorrow and distress.  And this is
 the answer they receive: "God!  gentlemen, don't you know?  The
 whole world would be beside itself as we are, if it but knew of
 the great sorrow and grief and woe and loss which has come to us
 this day.  God!  where have you come from, then, that you do not
 know what has happened just now in this city?  We will tell you
 the truth, for we wish you to join with us in the grief we feel.
 Do you not know about grim Death, who desires and covets all
 things, and everywhere lies in wait for what is best, do you not
 know what mad act she has committed to-day, as it is her wont to
 do?  God has illuminated the world with one great radiance, with
 one bright light.  But Death cannot restrain herself from acting
 as her custom is.  Every day, to the extent of her power, she
 blots out the best creature she can find.  So she wishes to try
 her power, and in one body she has carried off more excellence
 than she has left behind.  She would have done better to take the
 whole world, and leave alive and sound this prey which now she
 has carried off.  Beauty, courtesy, and knowledge, and all that a
 lady can possess of goodness has been taken and filched from us
 by Death, who has destroyed all goodness in the person of our
 lady, the empress.  Thus Death has deprived us all of life." 
 "Ah, God!" the doctors say, "we know that Thou art wroth with
 this city because we did not reach here sooner.  If we had
 arrived here yesterday, Death might have boasted of her strength
 if she could wrest her prey from us."  "Gentlemen, madame would
 not have allowed you at any price to see her or to exercise your
 skill.  Of good physicians there was no lack, but madame would
 not permit any one of them to see her or to investigate her
 malady."  "No?"  "Truly, sirs, that she would not."  Then they
 recalled the case of Solomon, who was so hated by his wife that
 she deceived him by feigning death. (41)  They think this woman
 has done the same.  But if they could in any way bring about her
 cure, no one could make them lie or keep them from exposing the
 truth, if they discovered any trickery.  So to the court they
 take their way, where there was such a noise and cry that you
 could not have heard God's thunder crash.  The chief of these
 three doctors, who knew the most, drew near the bier.  No one
 says to him "Keep hands off," and no one tries to hold him back. 
 He places his hand on her breast and side, and surely feels that
 life is still in the body: he perceives and knows that well
 enough.  He sees the emperor standing by, mad and tormented by
 his grief.  Seeing him, he calls aloud: "Emperor, console
 thyself!  I am sure and plainly see that this lady is not dead. 
 Leave off thy grief, and be comforted!  If I do not restore her
 alive to thee, thou mayst kill me or string me up."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5995-5988.)  At once throughout the palace the noise is
 quieted and hushed.  And the emperor bade the doctor tell him
 fully his orders and wishes, whatever they might be.  If he can
 restore life in the empress he will be sire and lord over the
 emperor himself; but if he has in any respect lied to him he will
 be hanged like a common thief.  And the doctor said: "I consent
 to that, and may you never have mercy upon me if I do not cause
 her to speak to you here!   Without tarrying and without delay
 have the palace cleared at once, and let not a single soul
 remain.  I must examine in private the illness which afflicts the
 lady.  These two doctors, who are my friends, will remain with me
 alone in the room, and let every one else go out."  This order
 would have been opposed by Cliges, John, and Thessala; but all
 the others who were there might have turned against them if they
 had tried to oppose his order.  So they hold their peace and
 approve what they hear approved by the others, and leave the
 palace.  After the three doctors had forcibly tipped apart the
 lady's winding-sheer, without using any knife or scissors, they
 said to her: "Lady, don't be frightened, have no fear, but speak
 to us with confidence!  We know well enough that you are
 perfectly sound and in good state.  Be sensible and obliging now,
 and do not despair of anything, for if you have any need of us we
 will all three assure you of our aid, whether for good or ill. 
 We shall be very loyal to you, both in keeping our counsel and in
 helping you.  Do not keep us talking here!  Since we put at your
 disposal our skill and service, you should surely not refuse."
 Thus they think to hoodwink and deceive her, but they have no
 success; for she has no need or care for the service which they
 promise her; so they are wasting their time in a vain effort.
 When the three physicians see that they will make nothing out of
 her either by prayer or flattery, then they take her from her
 bier, and begin to beat and belabour her.  But their efforts are
 foolish, for not a word can they extract from her.  Then they
 threaten and try to terrify her by saying that if she does not
 speak she will soon have reason to repent of her folly, for they
 are going to do such a wonderful thing to her that such a thing
 was never done to the body of any wretched woman.  "We know that
 you are alive, and will not deign to speak to us.  We know that
 you are feigning death, and would thus deceive the emperor.  Have
 no fear of us!  If any of us has angered you, before we do you
 further harm, cease your mad behaviour now, for you are acting
 wickedly; and we will lend you our aid in any enterprise -- wise
 or mad."  But it cannot be; they have no success.  Then they
 renew their attack, striking her with thongs upon the back, so
 that the welts are plainly seen, and they combine to tear her
 tender flesh until they cause the blood to flow.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5989-6050.)  When they had beaten her with the thongs until
 they had slashed her flesh, and when the blood is dropping down,
 as it trickles from among the wounds, even then their efforts are
 of no avail to extract from her a sigh or word, nor to make her
 stir or move.  Then they say that they must procure fire and
 lead, which they will melt and lay upon her hands, rather than
 fail in their efforts to make her speak.  After securing a light
 and some lead they kindle a fire and melt the lead.  Thus the
 miserable villains torment and afflict the lady, by taking the
 lead all boiling hot from the fire and pouring it into the palms
 of her hands.  Not satisfied with pouring the lead clean through
 her palms, the cowardly rascals say that, if she does not speak
 at once they will straightway stretch her on the grate until she
 is completely grilled.  Yet, she holds her peace, and does not
 refuse to have her body beaten and maltreated by them.  Now they
 were on the point of placing her upon the fire to be roasted and
 grilled when more than a thousand ladies, who were stationed
 before the palace, come to the door and through a little crack
 catch sight of the torture and anguish which they were inflicting
 upon the lady, as with coal and flame they accomplished her
 martyrdom.  They bring clubs and hammers to smash and break down
 the door.  Great was the noise and uproar as they battered and
 broke in the door.  If now they can lay hands on the doctors, the
 latter will not have long to wait before they receive their full
 deserts.  With a single rush the ladies enter the palace, and in
 the press is Thessala, who has no other aim than to reach her
 mistress.  Beside the fire she finds her stripped, severely
 wounded and injured.  She puts her back in the bier again, and
 over her she spreads a cloth, while the ladies go to give their
 reward to the three doctors, without wishing to wait for the
 emperor or his seneschal.  Out of the windows they threw them
 down into the court-yard, breaking the necks, ribs, arms, and
 legs of all: no better piece of work was ever done by any ladies.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 6051-6162.)  Now the three doctors have received their
 gruesome reward at the hands of the ladies.  But Cliges is
 terror-stricken and filled with grief upon hearing of the pain
 and martyrdom which his sweetheart has endured for him.  He is
 almost beside himself, fearing greatly, and with good reason,
 that she may be dead or badly injured by the torture inflicted
 upon her by the three physicians who now are dead.  So he is in
 despair and despondency when Thessala comes, bringing with her a
 very precious ointment with which she has already gently rubbed
 the body and wounds of her mistress.  When they laid her back in
 her bier the ladies wrapped her again in a cloth of Syrian stuff,
 leaving her face uncovered.  All that night there is no abatement
 of the cries they raise unceasingly.  Throughout the city. high
 and low, poor and rich, are beside themselves with grief, and it
 seems as if each one boasts that he will outdo all others in his
 woe, and would fain never be comforted.  All that night the grief
 continues.  The next morning John came to the court; and the
 emperor sends for him and issues to him this command: "John, if
 ever thou wroughtest a fine piece of work, now put forth and show
 all thy skill in constructing such a sepulchre as for beauty and
 workmanship shall have no match."  And John, who had already
 performed the task, says that he has already completed one which
 is very fine and cleverly wrought; but when he began the work he
 had no thought that other than a holy body should be laid in it.
 "Now let the empress be laid in it and buried in some sacred
 place, for she, I think, is sanctified."  "You have spoken well,"
 says the emperor; "she shall be buried yonder in my lord Saint
 Peter's Church, where bodies are wont to be interred.  For before
 her death she made this request of me, that I should have her
 buried there.  Now go about your task, and place your sepulchre
 in the best position in the cemetery, where it ought rightfully
 to be."  John replies: "Very well, my lord." John  at once takes
 his leave, and prepares the sepulchre with great skill; a
 feather-bed he placed inside, because the stone was hard and
 cold; and in order that the odour may be sweet, he spreads
 flowers and leaves about.  Another reason for doing this was that
 no one might perceive the mattress he had laid within the grave.
 Already Mass had been said for the dead in the churches and
 parishes, and the bells were tolling continuously as is proper
 for the dead.  Orders are given to bring the body to be laid in
 the sepulchre, which John with all his skill has constructed so
 richly and handsomely.  In all Constantinople none remains,
 whether small or great, who does not follow the body in tears,
 cursing and reproaching Death.  Knights and youths alike grow
 faint, while the ladies and damsels beat their breasts as they
 thus find fault with Death: "O Death," cries each, "why didst
 thou not take ransom for my lady?  Surely, thy gain was slight
 enough, whereas the loss to us is great."  And in this grief
 Cliges surely bears his part, as he suffers and laments more than
 all the others do, and it is strange he does not kill himself.
 But still he decides to put this off until the hour and the time
 shall come for him to disinter her and get possession of her and
 see whether she be alive or not.  Over the gave stand the men who
 let down the body into its place; but, with John there, they do
 not meddle with the adjustment of the sarcophagus, and since they
 were so prostrated that they could not see, John had plenty of
 time to perform his special task.  When the coffin was in its
 place, and nothing else was in the grave, he sealed up tightly
 all the joints.  When this was done, any one would have been
 skilful who, except by force or violence, could take away or
 loosen anything which John had put inside.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 6163-6316.)  Fenice lies in the sepulchre until the darkness
 of night came on.  But thirty knights mount guard over her, and
 there are ten tapers burning there, which light up the place all
 about.  The knights were weary and exhausted by the strain they
 had undergone; so they ate and drank that night until they all
 fell sound asleep.  When night came on, Cliges steals away from
 the court and from all his followers, so that there was not a
 single knight or servant who knew what had become of him.  He did
 not stop until he found John, who advises him as best he can.  He
 furnishes him with arms, but he will never have any need of them.
 Once armed, they both spur to the cemetery.  The cemetery was
 enclosed all about with a high wall, so that the knights, who had
 gone asleep after making the gate fast within, could rest assured
 that no one would enter there.  Cliges does not see how he can
 get in, for there is no passing through the gate.  And yet,
 somehow he must pass through, for love bids him and drives him
 on.  He tries the wall and climbs up, being strong and agile.
 Inside was a garden planted with trees, one of which stood so
 near the wall that it touched it.  Now Cliges had what he needed,
 and after letting himself down by the tree, the first thing he
 did was to go to open the gate for John.  Seeing the knights
 asleep, they extinguished all the lights, so that the place
 remained in darkness.  And John now uncovers the grave and opens
 the coffin, taking care to do it no harm.  Cliges steps into the
 grave and lifts out his Sweetheart, all weak and prostrate, whom
 he fondles, kisses, and embraces.  He does not know whether to
 rejoice or regret that she does not stir or move.  And John, as
 quickly as he could, closed up the sepulchre again, so that it
 was not apparent that any one had tampered with it.  Then they
 betook themselves as fast as they could to the tower.  When they
 had set her in the tower, in the rooms which were beneath the
 level of the ground, they took off her grave clothes; and Cliges,
 who knew nothing of the potion which she had taken, which made
 her dumb and kept her motionless, thinks that she is dead, and is
 in despair with anxiety as he heavily sighs and weeps.  But soon
 the time will come for the potion to lose its force.  And Fenice,
 who hears his grief, struggles and strives for strength to
 comfort him by word or glance.  Her heart almost bursts because
 of the sorrow which he shows.  "Ah Death!" he says, "how mean
 thou art, to spare and reprieve all things despicable and vile --
 to let them live on and endure.  Death!  art thou beside thyself
 or drunk, who hast killed my lady without me?  This is a
 marvellous thing I see: my lady is dead, and I still live on! 
 Ah, precious one, why does your lover live to see you dead?  One
 now could rightly say that you have died in my service, and that
 it is I who have killed and murdered you.  Sweetheart, then I am
 the death that has smitten you.  Is not that wrong?  For it is my
 own life I have lost in you, and have preserved your life in me.
 For did not your health and life belong to me. sweet one?  And
 did not mine belong to you?  For I loved nothing excepting you,
 and our double existence was as one.  So now I have done what was
 right in keeping your soul in my body while mine has escaped from
 your body, and one ought to go to seek the company of the other,
 wherever it may be, and nothing ought to separate them."  At this
 she heaves a gentle sigh and whispers faintly: "Lover mine, I am
 not altogether dead, but very near it.  I value my life but
 little now.  I thought it a jest and a mere pretence; but now I
 am indeed to be pitied, for death has not treated this as a jest.
 It will be a marvel if I escape alive.  For the doctors have
 seriously wounded me, and broken my flesh and disfigured me.  And
 yet, if it was possible for my nurse to come here, and if efforts
 were of any avail, she would restore me to health again."  "Do
 not worry, dear, about that," says Cliges, "for this very night I
 will bring her here."  "Dear, let John go for her now."  So John
 departed and looked for her until he found her, and told her how
 he wished her to come along and to let no other cause detain her;
 for Fenice and Cliges have sent for her to come to a tower where
 they are awaiting her; and that Fenice is in a grievous state, so
 that she must come provided with ointments and remedies, and to
 bear in mind that she will not live long, if she does not quickly
 come to bear her aid.  Thessala runs at once and, taking
 ointments, plaster, and remedies which she has prepared, she
 meets John again.  Secretly they go out from the city, until they
 come straight to the tower.  When Fenice sees her nurse, she
 feels already cured, because of the loving faith and trust she
 places in her.  And Cliges greets her affectionately, and says:
 "Welcome, nurse, whom I love and prize.  Nurse, for God's sake,
 what do you think of this young lady's malady?  What is your
 opinion?  Will she recover?"  "Yes, my lord, have no fear but
 that I shall restore her completely. A fortnight will not pass
 before I make her so well that she was never before so lively and
 strong."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 6317-6346.)  While Thessala is busy with her remedies, John
 goes to provide the tower with everything that is necessary.
 Cliges goes to the tower and comes away bravely and openly, for
 he has lodged a moulting falcon there, and he says that he goes
 to visit it; thus no one can guess that he goes there for any
 other reason than for the falcon.  He makes long stays there
 night and day.  He orders John to guard the tower, so that no one
 shall enter against his will.  Fenice now has no further cause to
 complain, for Thessala has completely cured her.  If Cliges were
 Duke of Almeria, Morocco, or Tudela, he would not consider it all
 worth a holly-berry compared with the joy which he now feels.
 Certainly Love did not debase itself when it joined these two,
 for it seems to them, when they embrace and kiss each other. that
 all the world must be better for their joy and happiness.  Now
 ask me no more of this, for one can have no wish in which the
 other does not acquiesce.  Thus they have but one desire, as if
 they two themselves were one.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 6347-6392.)  Fenice was in the tower, I believe, all that
 year and full two months of the next, until summer came again.
 When the trees bring forth their flowers and leaves, and the
 little birds rejoice, singing gaily their litanies, it came about
 that Fenice one morning heard the song of the nightingale. 
 Cliges was holding her tightly clasped with his arms about her
 waist and neck, and she held him in a like embrace, as she said:
 "Dear fair lover mine.  A garden would do me good, in which I
 could disport myself.  For more than fifteen months I have not
 seen the light of moon or sun.  If possible, I would fain go out
 yonder into the daylight, for here in this tower I am confined.
 If there was a garden near, where I could go and amuse myself, it
 would often do me good."  Then Cliges promises her to consult
 with John about it as soon as he can see him.  At that very
 moment John came in, as he was often wont to do, and Cliges spoke
 to him of what Fenice desired.  John replies: "All that she asks
 for is already provided and supplied.  This tower is well
 equipped with what she wishes and requires."  Then Fenice was
 very glad, and asked John to take her there, which he said he
 would very gladly do.  Then John goes and opens a door,
 constructed in a fashion which I cannot properly describe.  No
 one but John could have made it, and no one could have asserted
 that there was any door or window there -- so perfectly was it
 concealed.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 6393-6424.)  When Fenice saw the door open, and the sun come
 streaming in, as she had not seen it for many a day, her heart
 beat high with joy; she said that now there was nothing lacking,
 since she could leave her dungeon-tower, and that she wished for
 no other lodging-place.  She passed out through the door into the
 garden, with its pleasures and delights.  In the middle of the
 garden stood a grafted tree loaded with blooming flowers and
 leaves, and with a wide-spreading top.  The branches of it were
 so trained that they all hung downwards until they almost touched
 the ground; the main trunk, however, from which they sprang, rose
 straight into the air.  Fenice desires no other place.  Beneath
 the tree the turf is very pleasant and fine, and at noon, when it
 is hot, the sun will never be high enough for its rays to
 penetrate there.  John had shown his skill in arranging and
 training the branches thus.  There Fenice goes to enjoy herself,
 where they set up a bed for her by day.  There they taste of joy
 and delight.  And the garden is enclosed about with a high wall
 connected with the tower, so that nothing can enter there without
 first passing through the tower.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 6425-6586.)  Fenice now is very happy: there is nothing to
 cause her displeasure, and nothing is lacking which she desires,
 when her lover is at liberty to embrace her beneath the blossoms
 and the leaves. (42)  At the season when people take the sparrow-
 hawk and setter and hunt the lark and brown-thrush or stalk the
 quail and partridge, it chanced that a knight of Thrace, who was
 young and alert and inclined to knightly sport, came one day
 close by the tower in his search for game.  The hawk of Bertrand
 (for~such was his name) having missed a lark, had flown away, and
 Bertrand thought how great his loss would be if he should lose
 his hunting-bird.  When he saw it come down and light in a garden
 beneath the tower he was glad, for he thought he could not lose
 it now.  At once he goes and clambers up the wall until he
 succeeds in getting over it, when beneath the tree he sees Fenice
 and Cliges lying asleep and naked in close embrace.  "God!" said
 he, "what has happened to me now?  What marvel is this I see?  Is
 that not Cliges?  It surely is.  Is not that the empress with him
 there?  Nay, but it looks like her.  Never did one thing so
 resemble another.  Her nose, her mouth, and brow are like those
 of my lady the empress.  Never did Nature make two creatures of
 such similitude.  There is no feature in this woman here which I
 have not seen in my lady. If she were alive, I should say that it
 was certainly she herself."  Just then a pear falls down and
 strikes close by Fenice's ear.  She jumps and awakes and, seeing
 Bertrand, cries out aloud: "My dear, my dear, we are lost. 
 Yonder is Bertrand.  If he escapes you, we are caught in a bad
 trap, for he will tell that he has seen us."  Then Bertrand
 realised that it was the empress beyond any doubt.  He sees the
 necessity of leaving at once, for Cliges had brought with him his
 sword into the garden, and had laid it down beside the bed.  He
 jumped up now and grasped his sword, while Bertrand hastily took
 his leave.  As fast as he could he scaled the wall, and was
 almost safely over when Cliges coming after him raised his sword
 and struck him with such violence that he severed his leg below
 the knee, as if it had been a fennel stalk.  In spite of this,
 Bertrand got away, though badly wounded and maimed.  Beside
 themselves with grief and wrath at the sight of his sorry state,
 his men on the other side picked him up, and insistently inquired
 who it was who had used him thus.  "Don't speak to me now," he
 says, "but help me to mount my horse.  No mention shall be made
 of this excepting to the emperor.  He who thus has treated me
 must be, and doubtless is, in great terror; for he is in great
 danger of his life."  Then they set him upon his palfrey and lead
 him through the city, sorely grieved in their fright the while.
 After them more than twenty thousand others come, following them
 to the court.  And all the people run together, each striving to
 be there first.  Bertrand made his complaint aloud, in the
 hearing of all, to the emperor: but they took him for an idle
 chatterer when he said that he had seen the empress all exposed.
 The city is in a ferment of excitement: some regard the news they
 hear as simple nonsense, others advise and urge the emperor to
 visit the tower himself.  Great is the noise and confusion of the
 people who prepare to accompany him.  But they find nothing in
 the tower, for Fenice and Cliges make their escape, taking with
 them Thessala, who comforts them and declares to them that, if
 perchance they see people coming after them to arrest them, they
 need have no fear; that they would never approach to do them harm
 within the range of a strong cross-bow.  And the emperor within
 the tower has John sought for and brought.  He orders him to be
 bound and tied saying that he will have him hanged or burnt, and
 will have his ashes scattered wide.  He shall receive his due
 reward for the shame he has caused the emperor; but this reward 
 will not be agreeable, because John has hidden in the tower his
 nephew with his wife.  "Upon my word, you tell the truth," says
 John; "I will not lie, but will go still further and declare the
 truth, and if I have done any wrong it is right that I should be
 seized.  But I offer this as my excuse: that a servant ought to
 refuse nothing when his lawful lord commands.  Now, every one
 knows forsooth that I am his, and this tower is too."  "It is
 not, John.  Rather is it thine."  "Mine, sire?  Yes, after him:
 but neither do I belong to myself, nor have I anything which is
 mine, except what he pleased to bestow on me.  And if you should
 think to say that my lord is guilty of having done you wrong, I
 am ready to take up his defence without any command from him. 
 But I feel emboldened to proclaim openly what is on my mind, just
 as I have thought it out, for I know full well that I must die.
 So I will speak regardless of results.  For if I die for my
 lord's sake, I shall not die an ignoble death, for the facts are
 generally known about that oath and pledge which you gave to your
 brother, that after you Cliges should be emperor, who now is
 banished as a wanderer.  But if God will, he shall yet be
 emperor!  Hence you are open to reproach, for you ought not to
 have taken a wife; yet you married her and did Cliges a wrong,
 and he has done you no wrong at all.  And if I am punished with
 death by you, and if I die wrongfully for his sake, and if he is
 still alive, he will avenge my death on you.  Now go and do the
 best you can, for if I die you shall also die."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 6587-6630.)  The emperor trembles with wrath upon hearing
 the mocking words addressed to him by John.  "John," he says.
 "thou shalt have so much respite, until we find thy lord, who has
 done such wrong to me, though I loved him dearly and had no
 thought of defrauding him.  Meanwhile, thou shalt stay in prison.
 If thou knowest what has become of him, tell me at once, I order
 thee."  "I tell you?  How can I commit such treachery?  Were the
 life to be drawn from my body I would not reveal my lord to you,
 even if I knew his whereabouts.  As a matter of fact, I do not
 know any more than you where they have gone, so help me God!  But
 there is no need for your jealousy.  I do not so much fear your
 wrath that I should not say, so that all can hear, how you have
 been deceived, even my words are not believed.  You were deceived
 and tricked by potion you drank on your wedding night.  Unless it
 happened in dream, when you were asleep, you have never had your
 pleasure with her; but the night made you dream, and the dream
 gave you as much satisfaction as if it had happened in your
 waking hours that she had held you in her arms: that was the sum
 of your satisfaction.  Her heart was so devoted to Cliges that
 she feigned death for his sake; and he had such confidence in me
 that he explained it all to me and established her in my house,
 which rightfully belongs to him.  You ought not to find fault
 with me.  I ought, indeed, to be burnt or hanged, were I to
 betray my lord or refuse to do his will."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 6631-6784.)  When the emperor's attention is recalled to the
 potion which he had been pleased to drink, and with which
 Thessala had deceived him, then he realised for the first time
 that he had never had pleasure with his wife, unless it had
 happened in a dream: thus it was but an illusory joy.  And he
 says that if he does not take vengeance for the shame and
 disgrace inflicted upon him by the traitor who has seduced his
 wife, he will never again be happy.  "Now quick!" he says, "as
 far as Pavia, and from here to Germany, let no castle, town, or
 city remain in which search is not made.  I will hold that man
 above all others dear who will bring to me captive the two of
 them.  Now up and down, near and far, go diligently and search!"
 Then they started out with zeal and spent all that day in the
 search.  But in the number Cliges had some friends, who, if they
 found them, would have led them to some hiding-place rather than
 hale them back again.  All that fortnight they exhausted
 themselves in a fruitless search.  For Thessala, who is acting as
 their guide, conducts them by her arts and charms in such
 security that they feel no dread or fear of all the strength of
 the emperor.  They seek repose in no town or city; yet they have
 all they wish or desire, even more so than is usually the case.
 For all they need is procured for them by Thessala, who searches
 and scours and purveys for them.  Nor is there any who hunts them
 now, for all have returned to their homes again.  Meanwhile
 Cliges is not idle, but starts to find his uncle, King Arthur. 
 He continued his search until he found him, and to him he made
 his claim and protest about his uncle, the emperor, who, in order
 to disinherit him, had disloyally taken a wife, which it was not
 right for him to do; for he had sworn to his father that he would
 never marry in his life.  And the King says that with a fleet he
 will proceed to Constantinople, and that he will fill a thousand
 ships with knights, and three thousand more with men-at-arms,
 until no city or burg, town or castle, however strong or however
 high, will be able to withstand their assault.  Then Cliges did
 not forget to thank the King for the aid he offered him.  The
 King sends out to seek and summon all the high barons of the
 land, and causes to be requisitioned and equipped ships, war
 vessels, boats, and barks.  He has a hundred ships loaded and
 filled with shields, lances, bucklers, and armour fit for
 knights.  The King makes such great preparations for the war that
 never did Caesar or Alexander make the like.  He orders to
 assemble at his summons all England, and all Flanders, Normandy,
 France, and Brittany, and all the men as far as the Pyrenees.
 (43) Already they were about to set sail, when messengers arrived
 from Greece who delayed the embarkation and kept the King and his
 people back.  Among the messengers who came was John, that trusty
 man, for he would never be a witness or messenger of any news
 which was not true, and which he did not know for a certainty.
 The messengers were high born men of Greece, who came in search
 for Cliges.  They made inquiry and asked for him, until they
 found him at the King's court, when they said to him: "God save
 you, sire!  Greece is made over to you. and Constantinople is
 given to you by all those of your empire, because of the right
 you have to them.  Your uncle (but you know it not) is dead of
 the grief he felt because he could not discover you.  His grief
 was such that he lost his mind; he would neither drink nor eat,
 but died like a man beside himself.  Fair sire, now come back
 again!  For all your lords have sent for you.  Greatly they
 desire and long for you, wishing to make you their emperor." 
 Some there were that rejoiced at this; and others there were who
 would have gladly seen their guests elsewhere, and the fleet make
 sail for Greece.  But the expedition is given up, and the King
 dismisses his men, and the hosts depart to their homes again. 
 And Cliges hurriedly makes haste in his desire to return to
 Greece.  He has no wish to tarry.  His preparations made, he took
 his leave of the King, and then of all his friends. and taking
 Fenice with him, he goes away.  They travel until they arrive in
 Greece, where they receive him with the jubilation which they
 ought to show to their rightful lord, and they give him his
 sweetheart to be his wife.  Both of them are crowned at once. 
 His mistress he has made his wife, but he still calls her his
 mistress and sweetheart, and she can complain of no loss of
 affection, for he loves her still as his mistress, and she loves
 him, too, as a lady ought to love her lover.  And each day saw
 their love grow stronger: he never doubted her, nor did she blame
 him for anything.  She was never kept confined, as so many women
 have been who have lived since her time.  For never since has
 there been an emperor who did not stand in fear of his wife, lest
 he should be deceived by her, upon his hearing the story of how
 Fenice deceived Alis, first with the potion which he drank, and
 then later by that other ruse.  Therefore, every empress, however
 rich and noble she may be, is guarded in Constantinople as in a
 prison, for the emperor has no confidence in her when he
 remembers the story of Fenice.  He keeps her constantly guarded
 in her room, nor is there ever allowed any man in her presence,
 unless he be a eunuch from his youth; in the case of such there
 is no fear or doubt that Love will ensnare them in his bonds.
 Here ends the work of Chretien. (44)

 (34) For this tournament and its parallels in folk-lore, see Miss
      J.L. Weston, "The Three Days' Tournament" (London, 1902). 
      She argues (p. 14 f. and p. 43 f.) against Foerster's
      unqualified opinion of the originality of Chretien in his
      use of this current description of a tournament, an opinion
      set forth in his "Einleitung to Lancelot", pp. 43, 126, 128,
      138.
 <br>
 (35) Note that Chretien here deliberately avoids such a list of
      knights as he introduces in "Erec". (F.)
 <br>
 (36) It must be admitted that the text, which is offered by all
      but one MS., is here unintelligible.  The reference, if any
      be intended, is not clear. (F.)
 <br>
 (37) Much has been made of this expression as intimating that
      Chretien wrote "Cliges" as a sort of disavowal of the
      immorality of his lost "Tristan".  Cf. Foerster, "Cliges"
      (Ed. 1910), p. xxxix f., and Myrrha Borodine, "La femme et
      l'amour au XXIe Seicle d'apres les poemes de Chretien de
      Troyes" (Paris, 1909).  G. Paris has ably defended another
      interpretation of the references in "Cliges" to the Tristan
      legend in "Journal des Savants", 1902, p. 442 f.
 <br>
 (38) This curious moral teaching appears to be a perversion of
      three passages form St. Paul's Epistles: I Cor. vii. 9, I
      Cor. x. 32, Eph. v. 15.  Cf. H. Emecke, "Chretien von Troyes
      als Personlichkeit und als Dichter" (Wurzburg, 1892).
 <br>
 (39) "This feature of a woman who, thanks to some charm,
      preserves her virginity with a husband whom she does not
      love, is found not only in widespread stories, but in
      several French epic poems.  In only one, "Les Enfances
      Guillaume", does the husband, like Alis, remain ignorant of
      the fraud of which he is the victim, and think that he
      really possesses the woman.... If Chretien alone gave to the
      charm of the form of a potion, it is in imitation of the
      love potion in "Tristan".  (G. Paris in "Journal des
      Savants", 1902, p. 446).  For many other references to the
      effect of herb potions, cf. A. Hertel, "Verzauberte
      Oerlichkeiten und Gegenstande in der altfranzosische
      erzahlende Dichtung", p. 41 ff. (Hanover, 1908).
 <br>
 (40) I have pointed out the curious parallel between the
      following passage and Dante's "Vita Nova", 41 ("Romantic
      Review", ii. 2).  There is no certain evidence that Dante
      knew Chretien's work (cf. A. Farinelli, "Dante e la
      Francia", vol. i., p. 16 note), but it would be strange if
      he did not know such a distinguished predecessor.
 <br>
 (41) For the legend of Solomon deceived by his wife, see Foerster
      "Cliges" (ed. 1910), p. xxxii. f., and G. Paris in
      "Romania", ix. 436-443, and in "Journal des Savants", 1902,
      p. 645 f.  For an additional reference, add "Ipomedon",
      9103.
 <br>
 (42) For an imitation of the following scene, see Hans Herzog in
      "Germania", xxxi. 325.

 (43) "Porz d'Espaingne" refers to the passes in the Pyrenees
      which formed the entrance-ways to Spain.  Cf. The "Cilician
      Gates" in Xenophon's "Anabasis".
 <br>
 (44) Chretien here insists upon his divergence from the famous
      dictum attributed to the Countess Marie de Champagne by
      Andre le Chapelain: "Praeceptum tradit amoris, quod nulla
      etiam coniugata regis poterit amoris praemio coronari, nisi
      extra coniugii foedera ipsius amoris militae cernatur
      adiuneta". (Andreae Capellini, "De Amore", p. 154; Ed.
      Trojel, Havniae, 1892).
