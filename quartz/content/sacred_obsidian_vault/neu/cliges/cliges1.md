 CLIGES (1)
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1-44.)  He who wrote of Erec and Enide, and translated into
 French the commands of Ovid and the Art of Love, and wrote the
 Shoulder Bite, (2) and about King Mark and the fair Iseut, (3)
 and about the metamorphosis of the Lapwing, (4) the Swallow, and
 the Nightingale, will tell another story now about a youth who
 lived in Greece and was a member of King Arthur's line.  But
 before I tell you aught of him, you shall hear of his father's
 life, whence he came and of what family.  He was so bold and so
 ambitious that he left Greece and went to England, which was
 called Britain in those days, in order to win fame and renown.
 This story, which I intend to relate to you, we find written in
 one of the books of the library of my lord Saint Peter at
 Beauvais. (5)  From there the material was drawn of which
 Chretien has made this romance.  The book is very old in which
 the story is told, and this adds to its authority. (6)  From such
 books which have been preserved we learn the deeds of men of old
 and of the times long since gone by.  Our books have informed us
 that the pre-eminence in chivalry and learning once belonged to
 Greece.  Then chivalry passed to Rome, together with that highest
 learning which now has come to France.  God grant that it may be
 cherished here, and that it may be made so welcome here that the
 honour which has taken refuge with us may never depart from
 France: God had awarded it as another's share, but of Greeks and
 Romans no more is heard, their fame is passed, and their glowing
 ash is dead.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 45-134.)  Chretien begins his story as we find it in the
 history, which tells of an emperor powerful in wealth and honour
 who ruled over Greece and Constantinople.  A very noble empress,
 too, there was, by whom the emperor had two children.  But the
 elder son was already so far advanced before the younger one was
 born that, if he had wished, he might have become a knight and
 held all the empire beneath his sway.  The name of the elder was
 Alexander, and the other's name was Alis.  Alexander, too, was
 the father's name, and the mother's name was Tantalis.  I shall
 now say nothing more of the emperor and of Alis; but I shall
 speak of Alexander, who was so bold and proud that he scorned to
 become a knight in his own country. He had heard of King Arthur,
 who reigned in those days, and of the knights whom he always kept
 about him, thus causing his court to be feared and famed
 throughout the world.  However, the affair may result and
 whatever fortune may await him, nothing can restrain Alexander
 from his desire to go into Britain, but he must obtain his
 father's consent before proceeding to Britain and Cornwall.  So
 Alexander, fair and brave, goes to speak with the emperor in
 order to ask and obtain his leave.  Now he will tell him of his
 desire and what he wishes to do and undertake.  "Fair sire," he
 says, "in quest of honour and fame and praise I dare to ask you a
 boon, which I desire you to give me now without delay, if you are
 willing to grant it to me."  The emperor thinks no harm will come
 from this request: he ought rather to desire and long for his
 son's honour.  "Fair son," he says, "I grant you your desire; so
 tell me now what you wish me to give you."  Now the youth has
 accomplished his purpose, and is greatly pleased when the boon is
 granted him which he so greatly desired.  "Sire," says he, "do
 you wish to know what it is that you have promised me?  I wish to
 have a great plenty of gold and silver, and such companions from
 among your men as I will select; for I wish to go forth from your
 empire, and to present my service to the king who rules over
 Britain, in order that he may make me a knight.  I promise you
 never in my life to wear armour on my face or helmet upon my head
 until King Arthur shall gird on my sword, if he will graciously
 do so.  For from no other than from him will I accept my arms."
 Without hesitation the emperor replies: "Fair son, for God's
 sake, speak not so!  This country all belongs to you, as well as
 rich Constantinople.  You ought not to think me mean, when I am
 ready to make you such a gift.  I shall be ready soon to have you
 crowned, and to-morrow you shall be a knight.  All Greece will be
 in your hands, and you shall receive from your nobles, as is
 right, their homage and oaths of allegiance.  Whoever refuses
 such an offer is not wise."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 135-168.)  The youth hears the promise how the next morning
 after Mass his father is ready to dub him knight; but he says he
 will seek his fortune for better or worse in another land.  "If
 you are willing in this matter to grant the boon I have asked of
 you, then give me mottled and grey furs, some good horses and
 silken stuffs: for before I become a knight I wish to enrol in
 King Arthur's service.  Nor have I yet sufficient strength to
 bear arms.  No one could induce me by prayer or flattery not to
 go to the foreign land to see his nobles and that king whose fame
 is so great for courtesy and prowess.  Many men of high degree
 lose through sloth the great renown which they might win, were
 they to wander about the world. (7)  Repose and glory ill agree,
 as it seems to me; for a man of wealth adds nothing to his
 reputation if he spends all his days at ease.  Prowess is irksome
 to the ignoble man, and cowardice is a burden to the man of
 spirit; thus the two are contrary and opposite.  He is the slave
 of his wealth who spends his days in storing and increasing it.
 Fair father, so long as I have the chance, and so long as my
 rigour lasts, I wish to devote my effort and energy to the
 pursuit of fame."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 169-234.)  Upon hearing this; the emperor doubtless feels
 both joy and grief: he is glad that his son's intention is fixed
 upon honour, and on the other hand he is sorrowful because his
 son is about to be separated from him.  Yet, because of the
 promise which he made, despite the grief he feels, he must grant
 his request; for an emperor must keep his word.  "Fair son," he
 says, "I must not fail to do your pleasure, when I see you thus
 striving for honour.  From my treasure you may have two barges
 full of gold and silver; but take care to be generous and
 courteous and well-behaved."  Now the youth is very happy when
 his father promises him so much, and places his treasure at his
 disposal, and bids him urgently to give and spend generously. 
 And his father explains his reason for this: "Fair son," he says,
 "believe me, that generosity is the dame and queen which sheds
 glory upon all the other virtues.  And the proof of this is not
 far to seek.  For where could you find a man, be he never so rich
 and powerful, who is not blamed if he is mean?  Nor could you
 find one, however ungracious he may be, whom generosity will not
 bring into fair repute?  Thus largess makes the gentleman, which
 result can be accomplished neither by high birth, courtesy,
 knowledge, gentility, money, strength, chivalry, boldness,
 dominion, beauty, or anything else. (8)  But just as the rose is
 fairer than any other flower when it is fresh and newly blown, so
 there, where largess dwells, it takes its place above all
 other virtues, and increases five hundred fold the value of other
 good traits which it finds in the man who acquits himself well.
 So great is the merit of generosity that I could not tell you the
 half of it."  The young man has now successfully concluded the
 negotiations for what he wished; for his father has acceded to
 all his desires.  But the empress was sorely grieved when she
 heard of the journey which her son was about to take.  Yet,
 whoever may grieve or sorrow, and whoever may attribute his
 intention to youthful folly, and ever may blame and seek to
 dissuade him, the youth ordered his ships to be made ready as
 soon as possible, desiring to tarry no longer in his native land.
 At his command the ships were freighted that very night with
 wine, meat, and biscuit.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 235-338.)  The ships were loaded in the port, and the next
 morning Alexander came to the strand in high spirits, accompanied
 by his companions, who were happy over the prospective voyage.
 They were escorted by the emperor and the empress in her grief.
 At the port they find the sailors in the ships drawn up beside
 the cliff.  The sea was calm and smooth, the wind was light, and
 the weather clear.  When he had taken leave of his father, and
 bidden farewell to the empress, whose heart was heavy in her
 bosom, Alexander first stepped from the small boat into the skip;
 then all his companions hastened by fours, threes, and twos to
 embark without delay.  Soon the sail was spread and the anchor
 raised.  Those on shore whose heart is heavy because of the men
 whom they watch depart, follow them with their gaze as long as
 they can: and in order to watch them longer, they all climb a
 high hill behind the beach.  From there they sadly gaze, as long
 as their eyes can follow them.  With sorrow, indeed, they watch
 them go, being solicitous for the youths, that God may bring them
 to their haven without accident and without peril.  All of April
 and part of May they spent at sea.  Without any great danger or
 mishap they came to port at Southampton. (9)  One day, between
 three o'clock and vespers, they cast anchor and went ashore.  The
 young men, who had never been accustomed to endure discomfort or
 pain, had suffered so long from their life at sea that they had
 all lost their colour, and even the strongest and most vigorous
 were weak and faint.  In spite of that, they rejoice to have
 escaped from the sea and to have arrived where they wished to be. 
 Because of their depleted state, they spend the night at
 Southampton in happy frame, and make inquiries whether the King
 is in England.  They are told that he is at Winchester, and that
 they can reach there in a very short time if they will start
 early in the morning and keep to the straight road.  At this news
 they are greatly pleased, and the next morning at daybreak the
 youths wake early, and prepare and equip themselves.  And when
 they were ready, they left Southampton, and kept to the direct
 road until they reached Winchester, where the King was.  Before
 six o'clock in the morning the Greeks had arrived at the court.
 The squires with the horses remain below in the yard, while the
 youths go up into the presence of the King, who was the best that
 ever was or ever will be in the world.  And when the King sees
 them coming, they please him greatly, and meet with his favour.
 But before approaching the King's presence, they remove the
 cloaks from about their necks, lest they should be considered
 ill-bred.  Thus, all unmantled, they came before the King, while
 all the nobles present held their peace, greatly pleased at the
 sight of these handsome and well-behaved young men.  They suppose
 that of course they are all sons of counts or kings; and, to be
 sure, so they were, and of a very charming age, with graceful and
 shapely forms.  And the clothes they wore were all of the same
 stuff and cut of the same appearance and colour.  There were
 twelve of them beside their lord, of whom I need tell you no more
 than that there was none better than he.  With modesty and
 orderly mien, he was handsome and shapely as he stood uncovered
 before the King.  Then he kneeled before him, and all the others,
 for honour's sake, did the same beside their lord.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 339-384.) Alexander, with his tongue well skilled in
 speaking fair and wisely, salutes the King.  "King," he says,
 "unless the report is false that spreads abroad your fame, since
 God created the first man there was never born a God-fearing man
 of such puissance as yours.  King, your widespread renown has
 drawn me to serve and honour you in your court, and if you will
 accept my service, I would fain remain here until I be dubbed a
 knight by your hand and by no one else.  For unless I receive
 this honour from your hand, I shall renounce all intention of
 being knighted.  If you will accept my service until you are
 willing to dub me a knight, retain me now, oh gentle King, and my
 companions gathered here."  To which at once the King replies:
 "Friend, I refuse neither you nor your companions.  Be welcome
 all.  For surely you seem, and I doubt it not, to be sons of
 high-born men.  Whence do you come?"  "From Greece."  "From
 Greece?"  "Yes."  "Who is thy father?"  "Upon my word, sire, the
 emperor."  "And what is thy name, fair friend?"  "Alexander is
 the name that was given me when I received the salt and holy oil,
 and Christianity and baptism."  "Alexander, my dear, fair friend.
 I will keep you with me very gladly, with great pleasure and
 delight.  For you have done me signal honour in thus coming to my
 court.  I wish you to be honoured here, as free vassals who are
 wise and gentle.  You have been too long upon your knees; now, at
 my command, and henceforth make your home with man and in my
 court; it is well that you have come to us."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 385-440.)  Then the Greeks rise up, joyful that the King has
 so kindly invited them to stay.  Alexander did well to come; for
 he lacks nothing that he desires, and there is no noble at the
 court who does not address him kindly and welcome him.  He is not
 so foolish as to be puffed up, nor does he vaunt himself nor
 boast.  He makes acquaintance with my lord Gawain and with the
 others, one by one.  He gains the good graces of them all, but my
 lord Gawain grows so fond of him that he chooses him as his
 friend and companion. (10)  The Greeks took the best lodgings to
 be had, with a citizen of the town.  Alexander had brought great
 possessions with him from Constantinople, intending to give heed
 above all to the advice and counsel of the Emperor, that his
 heart should be ever ready to give and dispense his riches well.
 To this end he devotes his efforts, living well in his lodgings,
 and giving and spending liberally, as is fitting in one so rich,
 and as his heart dictates.  The entire court wonders where he got
 all the wealth that he bestows; for on all sides he presents the
 valuable horses which he had brought from his own land.  So much
 did Alexander do, in the performance of his service, that the
 King, the Queen, and the nobles bear him great affection.  King
 Arthur about this time desired to cross over into Brittany.  So
 he summons all his barons together to take counsel and inquire to
 whom he may entrust England to be kept in peace and safety until
 his return.  By common consent, it seems, the trust was assigned
 to Count Angres of Windsor, for it was their judgement that there
 was no more trustworthy lord in all the King's realm.  When this
 man had received the land, King Arthur set out the next day
 accompanied by the Queen and her damsels.  The Bretons make great
 rejoicing upon hearing the news in Brittany that the King and his
 barons are on the way.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 441-540.)  Into the ship in which the King sailed there
 entered no youth or maiden save only Alexander and Soredamors,
 whom the Queen brought with her.  This maiden was scornful of
 love, for she had never heard of any man whom she would deign to
 love, whatever might be his beauty, prowess, lordship, or birth.
 And yet the damsel was so charming and fair that she might fitly
 have learned of love, if it had pleased her to lend a willing
 ear; but she would never give a thought to love.  Now Love will
 make her grieve, and will avenge himself for all the pride and
 scorn with which she has always treated him.  Carefully Love has
 aimed his dart with which he pierced her to the heart.  Now she
 grows pale and trembles, and in spite of herself must succumb to
 Love.  Only with great difficulty can she restrain herself from
 casting a glance toward Alexander; but she must be on her guard
 against her brother, my lord Gawain.  Dearly she pays and atones
 for her great pride and disdain.  Love has heated for her a bath
 which heats and burns her painfully.  At first it is grateful to
 her, and then it hurts; one moment she likes it, and the next she
 will have none of it.  She accuses her eyes of treason, and says:
 (11) "My eyes, you have betrayed me now!  My heart, usually so
 faithful, now bears me ill-will because of you.  Now what I see
 distresses me.  Distresses?  Nay, verily, rather do I like it
 well.  And if I actually see something that distresses me, can I
 not control my eyes?  My strength must indeed have failed, and
 little should I esteem myself, if I cannot control my eyes and
 make them turn their glance elsewhere.  Thus, I shall be able to
 baffle Love in his efforts to get control of me.  The heart feels
 no pain when the eye does not see; so, if I do not look at him,
 no harm will come to me.  He addresses me no request or prayer,
 as he would do were he in love with me.  And since he neither
 loves nor esteems me, shall I love him without return?  If his
 beauty allures my eyes, and my eyes listen to the call, shall I
 say that I love him just for that?  Nay, for that would be a lie.
 Therefore, he has no ground for complaint, nor can I make any
 claim against him.  One cannot love with the eyes alone.  What
 crime, then, have my eyes committed, if their glance but follows
 my desire?  What is their fault and what their sin?  Ought I to
 blame them, then?  Nay, verily.  Who, then, should be blamed?
 Surely myself, who have them in control.  My eye glances at
 nothing unless it gives my  heart delight.  My heart ought not to
 have any desire which would give me pain.  Yet its desire causes
 me pain.  Pain?  Upon my faith, I must be mad, if to please my
 heart I wish for something which troubles me.  If I can, I ought
 to banish any wish that distresses me.  If I can?  Mad one, what
 have I said?  I must, indeed, have little power if I have no
 control over myself.  Does Love think to set me in the same path
 which is wont to lead others astray?  Others he may lead astray,
 but not me who care not for him.  Never shall I be his, nor ever
 was, and I shall never seek his friendship."  Thus she argues
 with herself, one moment loving, and hating the next.  She is in
 such doubt that she does not know which course she had better
 adopt.  She thinks to be on the defence against Love, but defence
 is not what she wants.  God!  She does not know that Alexander is
 thinking of her too!  Love bestows upon them equally such a share
 as is their due.  He treats them very fairly and justly, for each
 one loves and desires the other.  And this love would be true and
 right if only each one knew what was the other's wish.  But he
 does not know what her desire is, and she knows not the cause of
 his distress.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 541-574.)  The Queen takes note of them and sees them often
 blanch and pale and heave deep sighs and tremble.  But she knows
 no reason why they should do so, unless it be because of the sea
 where they are.  I think she would have divined the cause had the
 sea not thrown her off her guard, but the sea deceives and tricks
 her, so that she does not discover love because of the sea; and
 it is from love that comes the bitter pain that distresses them.
 (12)  But of the three concerned, the Queen puts all the blame
 upon the sea; for the other two accuse the third to her, and hold
 it alone responsible for their guilt.  Some one who is not at
 fault is often blamed for another's wrong.  Thus, the Queen lays
 all the blame and guilt upon the sea, but it is unfair to put the
 blame upon the sea, for it is guilty of no misdeed.  Soredamors'
 deep distress continued until the vessel came to port.  As for
 the King, it is well known that the Bretons were greatly pleased,
 and served him gladly as their liege lord.  But of King Arthur I
 will not longer speak in this place; rather shall you hear me
 tell  how Love distresses these two lovers whom he has attacked.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 575-872.)  Alexander loves and desires her; and she, too,
 pines for the love of him, but he knows it not, nor will he know
 it until he has suffered many a pain and many a grief.  It is for
 her sake that he renders to the Queen loving service, as well as
 to her maids-in-waiting; but to her on whom his thoughts are
 fixed, he dares not speak or address a word.  If she but dared to
 assert to him the right which she thinks she has, she would
 gladly inform him of the truth; but she does not dare, and cannot
 do it.  They dare neither speak nor act in accordance with what
 each sees in the other -- which works a great hardship to them
 both, and their love but grows and flames the more.  However, it
 is the custom of all lovers to feast their eyes gladly with
 gazing, if they can do no more; and they assume that, because
 they find pleasure in that which causes their love to be born and
 grow, therefore it must be to their advantage; whereas it only
 harms them more, just as he who approaches and draws close beside
 the fire burns himself more than he who holds aloof.  Their love
 waxes and grows anon; but each is abashed before the other, and
 so much is hidden and concealed that no flame or smoke arises
 from the coals beneath the ashes.  The heat is no less on this
 account, but rather is better sustained beneath the ashes than
 above.  Both of them are in great torment; for, in order that
 none may perceive their trouble, they are forced to deceive
 people by a feigned bearing; but at night comes the bitter moan,
 which each one makes within his breast.  Of Alexander I will tell
 you first how he complains and vents his grief.  Love presents
 before his mind her for whom he is in such distress; it is she
 who has filched his heart away, and grants him no rest upon his
 bed, because, forsooth, he delights to recall the beauty and the
 grace of her who, he has no hope, will ever bring him any joy. 
 "I may as well hold myself a madman." he exclaims.  "A madman?
 Truly, I am beside myself, when I dare not speak what I have in
 mind; for it would speedily fare worse with me (if I held my
 peace).  I have engaged my thoughts in a mad emprise.  But is it
 not better to keep my thoughts to myself than to be called a
 fool?  My wish will never then be known.  Shall I then conceal
 the cause of my distress, and not dare to seek aid and healing
 for my wound?  He is mad who feels himself afflicted, and seeks
 not what will bring him health, if perchance he may find it
 anywhere; but many a one seeks his welfare by striving for his
 heart's desire, who pursues only that which brings him woe
 instead.  And why should one ask for advice, who does not expect
 to gain his health?  He would only exert himself in vain.  I feel
 my own illness to be so grievous that I shall never be healed by
 any medicine or draught, by any herb or root.  For some ills
 there is no remedy, and mine lies so deep within that it is
 beyond the reach of medicine.  Is there no help, then?  Methinks
 I have lied.  When first I felt this malady, if I had dared to
 make mention of it.  I might have spoken with a physician who
 could have completely cured me.  But I like not to discuss such
 matters; I think he would pay me no heed and would not consent to
 accept a fee.  No wonder, then, if I am terrified; for I am very
 ill, yet I do not know what disease this is which has me in its
 grip, and I know not whence this pain has come.  I do not know? 
 I know full well that it is Love who does me this injury.  How is
 that?  Can Love do harm?  Is he not gentle and well-bred?  I used
 to think that there was naught but good in Love; but I have found
 him full of enmity.  He who has not had experience of him does
 not know what tricks Love plays.  He is a fool who joins his
 ranks; for he always seeks to harm his followers.  Upon my faith,
 his tricks are bad.  It is poor sport to play with him, for his
 game will only do me harm.  What shall I do, then?  Shall I
 retreat?  I think it would be wise to do so, but I know not how
 to do it.  If Love chastens and threatens me in order to teach
 and instruct me, ought I to disdain my teacher?  He is a fool who
 scorns his master.  I ought to keep and cherish the lesson which
 Love teaches me, for great good may soon come of it.  But I am
 frightened because he beats me so.  And dost thou complain, when
 no sign of blow or wound appears?  Art thou not mistaken?  Nay,
 for he has wounded me so deep that he has shot his dart to my
 very heart, and has not yet drawn it out again. (13)  How has he
 pierced thy body with it, when no wound appears without?  Tell me
 that, for I wish to know.  How did he make it enter in?  Through
 the eye.  Through the eye?  But he has not put it out?  He did
 not harm the eye at all, but all the pain is in the heart.  Then
 tell me, if the dart passed through the eye, how is it that the
 eye itself is not injured or put out.  If the dart entered
 through the eye, why does the heart in the breast complain, when
 the eye, which received the first effect, makes no complaint of
 it at all?  I can readily account for that: the eye is not
 concerned with the understanding, nor has it any part in it; but
 it is the mirror of the heart, and through this mirror passes,
 without doing harm or injury, the flame which sets the heart on
 fire.  For is not the heart placed in the breast just like a
 lighted candle which is set in a lantern?  If you take the candle
 away no light will shine from the lantern; but so long as the
 candle lasts the lantern is not dark at all, and the flame which
 shines within does it no harm or injury.  Likewise with a pane of
 glass, which might be very strong and solid, and yet a ray of the
 sun could pass through it without cracking it at all; yet a piece
 of glass will never be so bright as to enable one to see, unless
 a stronger light strikes its surface.  Know that the same thing
 is true of the eyes as of the glass and the lantern; for the
 light strikes the eyes in which the heart is accustomed to see
 itself reflected, and lo! it sees some light outside, and many
 other things, some green, some purple, others red or blue; and
 some it dislikes, and some it likes, scorning some and prizing
 others.  But many an object seems fair to it when it looks at it
 in the glass, which will deceive it if it is not on its guard. 
 My mirror has greatly deceived me; for in it my heart saw a ray
 of light with which I am afflicted, and which has penetrated deep
 within me, causing me to lose my wits.  I am ill-treated by my
 friend, who deserts me for my enemy.  I may well accuse him of
 felony for the wrong he has done to me.  I thought I had three
 friends, my heart and my two eyes together; but it seems that
 they hate me.  Where shall I ever find a friend, when these three
 are my enemies, belonging to me, yet putting me to death? My
 servants mock at my authority, in doing what they please without
 consulting my desire.  After my experience with these who have
 done me wrong, I know full well that a good man's love may be
 befouled by wicked servants in his employ.  He who is attended by
 a wicked servant will surely have cause to rue it, sooner or
 later.  Now I will tell you how the arrow, which has come into my
 keeping and possession, is made and fashioned; but I fear greatly
 that I shall fail in the attempt; for the fashion of it is so
 fine that it will be no wonder if I fail.  Yet I shall devote all
 my effort to telling you how it seems to me.  The notch and the
 feathers are so close together, when carefully examined, that the
 line of separation is as fine as a hair's breadth; but the notch
 is so smooth and straight that in it surely no improvement could
 be made.  The feathers are coloured as if they were of gold or
 gilt; but gilt is here beside the mark, for I know these feathers
 were more brilliant than any gilt.  This dart is barbed with the
 golden tresses that I saw the other day at sea.  That is the dart
 which awakes my love.  God!  What a treasure to possess!  Would
 he who could gain such a prize crave other riches his whole life
 long?  For my part I could swear that I should desire nothing
 else; I would not give up even the barb and the notch for all the
 gold of Antioch.  And if I prize so highly these two things, who
 could estimate the value of what remains?  That is so fair and
 full of charm, so dear and precious, that I yearn and long to
 gaze again upon her brow, which God's hand has made so clear that
 it were vain to compare with it any mirror, emerald, or topaz.
 But all this is of little worth to him who sees her flashing
 eyes; to all who gaze on them they seem like twin candles
 burning.  And whose tongue is so expert as to describe the
 fashion of her well-shaped nose and radiant face, in which the
 rose suffuses the lily so as to efface it somewhat, and thus
 enhance the glory of her visage?  And who shall speak of her
 laughing mouth, which God shaped with such great skill that none
 might see it and not suppose that she was laughing?  And what
 about her teeth?  They are so close to one another that it seems
 they are all of one solid piece, and in order that the effect
 might still be enhanced Nature added her handiwork; for any one,
 to see her part her lips, would suppose that the teeth were of
 ivory or of silver.  There is so much to be said were I to
 portray each detailed charm of chin and ears, that it would not
 be strange were I to pass over some little thing.  Of her throat
 I shall only say that crystal beside it looks opaque.  And her
 neck beneath her hair is four times as white as ivory.  Between
 the border of her gown and the buckle at the parted throat, I saw
 her bosom left exposed and whiter than new-fallen snow.  My pain
 would be indeed assuaged, if I had seen the dart entire.  Gladly
 would I tell, if I but knew, what was the nature of the shaft. 
 But I did nor see it, and it is not my fault if I do not attempt
 to describe something I have never seen.  At that time Love
 showed me only the notch and the barb; for the shaft was hidden
 in the quiver, to wit, in the robe and shift in which the damsel
 was arrayed.  Upon my faith, malady which tortures me is the
 arrow -- it is the dart at which I am a wretch to be enraged.  I
 am ungrateful to be incensed.  Never shall a straw be broken
 because of any distrust or quarrel that may arise between Love
 and me.  Now let Love do what he will with me as with one who
 belongs to him; for I wish it, and so it pleases me.  I hope that
 this malady may never leave me, but that it may thus always
 maintain its hold, and that health may never come to me except
 from the source of my illness."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 873-1046.)  Alexander's complaint is long enough; but that
 of the maiden is nothing less.  All night she lies in such
 distress that she cannot sleep or get repose.  Love has confined
 within her heart a struggle and conflict which disturbs her
 breast, and which causes her such pain and anguish that she weeps
 and moans all night, and tosses about with sudden starts, so that
 she is almost beside herself.  And when she has tossed and sobbed
 and groaned and started up and sighed again then she looked
 within her heart to see who and what manner of man it was for
 whom Love was tormenting her.  And when she has refreshed herself
 somewhat with thinking to her heart's content, she stretches and
 tosses about again, and ridicules all the thoughts she has had.
 Then she takes another course, and says: "Silly one, what matters
 it to me if this youth is of good birth and wise and courteous
 and valorous?  All this is simply to his honour and credit.  And
 as for his beauty, what care I?  Let his beauty be gone with him!
 But if so, it will be against my will, for it is not my wish to
 deprive him of anything.  Deprive?  No, indeed!  That I surely
 will not do.  If he had the wisdom of Solomon, and if Nature had
 bestowed on him all the beauty she can place in human form, and
 if God had put in my power to undo it all, yet would I not injure
 him; but I would gladly, if I could, make him still more wise and
 fair.  In faith, then, I do not hate him!  And am I for that
 reason his friend?  Nay, I am not his any more than any other
 man's.  Then what do I think of him so much, if he pleases me no
 more than other men?  I do not know; I am all confused; for I
 never thought so much about any man in the world, and if I had my
 will, I should see him all the time, and never take my eyes from
 him.  I feel such joy at the sight of him!  Is this love?  Yes, I
 believe it is.  I should not appeal to him so often, if I did not
 love him above all others.  So I love him, then, let it be
 agreed.  Then shall I not do what I please?  Yes, provided he
 does not refuse.  This intention of mine is wrong; but Love has
 so filled my heart that I am mad and beside myself, nor will any
 defence avail me now, if I must endure the assault of Love.  I
 have demeaned myself prudently toward Love so long, and would
 never accede to his will; but now I am more than kindly disposed
 toward him.  And what thanks will he owe to me, if he cannot have
 my loving service and good-will?  By force he has humbled my
 pride, and now I must follow his pleasure.  Now I am ready to
 love, and I have a master, and Love will teach me -- but what?
 How I am to serve his will.  But of that I am very well informed,
 and am so expert in serving him that no one could find fault with
 me.  I need learn no more of that.  Love would have it, and so
 would I, that I should be sensible and modest and kind and
 approachable to all for the sake of one I love.  Shall I love all
 men, then, for the sake of one?  I should be pleasant to every
 one, but Love does not bid me be the true friend of every one.
 Love's lessons are only good.  It is not without significance
 that I am called by the name of Soredamors. (14)  I am destined
 to love and be loved in turn, and I intend to prove it by my
 name, if I can find the explanation there.  There is some
 significance in the fact that the first part of my name is of
 golden colour; for what is golden is the best.  For this reason I
 highly esteem my name, because it begins with that colour with
 which the purest gold harmonises.  And the end of the name calls
 Love to my mind; for whoever calls me by my right name always
 refreshes me with love.  And one half gilds the other with a
 bright coat of yellow gold; for Soredamors has the meaning of
 `one gilded over with Love.'  Love has highly honoured me in
 gilding me over with himself.  A gilding of real gold is not so
 fine as that which makes me radiant.  And I shall henceforth do
 my best to be his gilding, and shall never again complain of it. 
 Now I love and ever more shall love.  Whom?  Truly, that is a
 fine question!  Him whom Love bids me love, for no other shall
 ever have my love.  What will he care in his ignorance, unless I
 tell him of it myself?  What shall I do, if l do not make to him
 my prayer?  Whoever desires anything ought to ask for it and make
 request.  What?  Shall I beseech him, then?  Nay.  Why?  Did ever
 such a thing come about that a woman should be so forward as to
 make love to any man; unless she were clean beside herself.  I
 should be mad beyond question if I uttered anything for which I
 might be reproached.  If he should know the truth through word of
 mine I think he would hold me in slight esteem, and would often
 reproach me with having solicited his love.  May love never be so
 base that I should be the first to prefer a request which would
 lower me in his eyes!  Alas, God!  How will he ever know the
 truth, since I shall not tell him of it?  As yet I have very
 little cause to complain.  I will wait until his attention is
 aroused, if ever it is to be aroused.  He will surely guess the
 truth, I think, if ever he has had commerce with Love, or has
 heard of it by word of mouth.  Heard of it?  That is a foolish
 thing to say.  Love is not of such easy access that any one may
 claim acquaintance by hear-say only and without personal
 experience.  I have come to know that well enough myself; for I
 could never learn anything of love through flattery and wooing
 words, though I have often been in the school of experience, and
 have been flattered many a time.  But I have always stood aloof,
 and now he makes me pay a heavy penalty: now I know more about it
 than does the ox of ploughing.  But one thing causes me despair:
 I fear he has never been in love.  And if he is not in love, and
 never has been so, then I have sowed in the sea where no seed can
 take root.  So there is nothing to do but wait and suffer, until
 I see whether I can lead him on by hints and covered words.  I
 shall continue this until he is sure of my love and dares to ask
 me for it.  So there is nothing more about the matter, but that I
 love him and am his.  If he loves me not, yet will I love him."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1047-1066.)  Thus he and she utter their complaint, unhappy
 at night and worse by day, each hiding the truth from the other's
 eyes.  In such distress they remained a long time in Brittany, I
 believe, until the end of the summer came.  At the beginning of
 October there came messengers by Dover from London and
 Canterbury, bearing to the King news which troubled him.  The
 messengers told him that he might be tarrying too long in
 Brittany; for, he to whom he had entrusted the kingdom was
 intending to withstand him, and had already summoned a great army
 of his vassals and friends, and had established himself in London
 for the purpose of defending the city against Arthur when he
 should return.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1067-1092.)  When the King heard this news, angry and sore
 displeased he summons all his knights.  In order the better to
 spur them on to punish the traitor, he tells them that they are
 entirely to blame for his trouble and strife; for on their advice
 he entrusted his land to the hands of the traitor, who is worse
 than Ganelon. (15)  There is not a single one who does not agree
 that the King is right, for he had only followed their advice;
 but now this man is to be outlawed, and you may be sure that no
 town or city will avail to save his body from being dragged out
 by force.  Thus they all assure the King, giving him their word
 upon oath, that they will deliver the traitor to him, or never
 again claim their fiefs.  And the King proclaims throughout
 Brittany that no one who can bear arms shall refuse to follow him
 at once.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1093-1146.)  All Brittany is now astir.  Never was such an
 army seen as King Arthur brought together.  When the ships came
 to set sail, it seemed that the whole world was putting out to
 sea; for even the water was hid from view, being covered with the
 multitude of ships.  It is certainly true that, to judge by the
 commotion, all Brittany is under way.  Now the ships have crossed
 the Channel, and the assembled host is quartered on the shore.
 Alexander bethought himself to go and pray the King to make him a
 knight, for if ever he should win renown it will be in this war.
 Prompted by his desire, he takes his companions with him to
 accomplish what he has in mind.  On reaching the King's quarters,
 they found him seated before his tent.  When he saw the Greeks
 approaching, he summoned them to him, saying: "Gentlemen, do not
 conceal what business has brought you here."  Alexander replied
 on behalf of all, and told him his desire: "I have come," he
 says, "to request of you, as I ought to do of my liege lord, on
 behalf of my companions and myself, that you should make us
 knights."  The King replies: "Very gladly; nor shall there be any
 delay about it, since you have preferred your request."  Then the
 King commands that equipment shall be furnished for twelve
 knights.  Straightway the King's command is done.  As each one
 asks for his equipment, it is handed to him --  rich arms and a
 good horse: thus each one received his outfit.  The arms and
 robes and horse were of equal value for each of the twelve; but
 the harness for Alexander s body, if it should be valued or sold,
 was alone worth as much as that of all the other twelve.  At the
 water's edge they stripped, and then washed and bathed
 themselves.  Not wishing that any other bath should be heated for
 them, they washed in the sea and used it as their tub. (16)
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1147-1196.)  All this is known to the Queen, who bears
 Alexander no ill will, but rather loves, esteems, and values him.
 She wishes to make Alexander a gift, but it is far more precious
 than she thinks.  She seeks and delves in all her boxes until she
 finds a white silk shirt, well made of delicate texture, and very
 soft.  Every thread in the stitching of it was of gold, or of
 silver at least.  Soredamors had taken a hand in the stitching of
 it here and there, and at intervals, in the sleeves and neck, she
 had inserted beside the gold a strand of her own hair, to see if
 any man could be found who, by close examination, could detect
 the difference.  For the hair was quite as bright and golden as
 the thread of gold itself.  The Queen takes the shirt and
 presents it to Alexander.  Ah, God!  What joy would Alexander
 have felt had he known what the Queen was giving him!  And how
 glad would she, too, have been, who had inserted her own hair, if
 she had known that her lover was to own and wear it!  She could
 then have taken great comfort; for she would not have cared so
 much for all the hair she still possessed as for the little that
 Alexander had.  But, more is the pity, neither of them knew the
 truth.  The Queen's messenger finds the youths on the shore where
 they are bathing, and gives the shirt to Alexander.  He is
 greatly pleased with it, esteeming the present all the more
 because it was given him by the Queen.  But if he had known the
 rest, he would have valued it still more; in exchange for it he
 would not have taken the whole world, but rather would have made
 a shrine of it and worshipped it, doubtless, day and night.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1197-1260.)  Alexander delays no longer, but dresses himself
 at once.  When he was dressed and ready, he returned to the
 King's tent with all his companions.  The Queen, it seems, had
 come there, too, wishing to see the new knights present
 themselves.  They might all be called handsome, but Alexander
 with his shapely body was the fairest of them all.  Well, now
 that they are knights I will say no more of them for the present,
 but will tell of the King and of his host which came to London.
 Most of the people remained faithful to him, though many allied
 themselves with the opposition.  Count Angres assembled his
 forces, consisting of all those whose influence could be gained
 by promises or gifts.  When he had gathered all his strength, he
 slipped away quietly at night, fearing to be betrayed by the many
 who hated him.  But before he made off, he sacked London as
 completely as possible of provisions, gold and silver, which he
 divided among his followers.  This news was told to the King, how
 the traitor had escaped with all his forces, and that he had
 carried off from the city so many supplies that the distressed
 citizens were impoverished and destitute.  Then the King replied
 that he would not take a ransom for the traitor, but rather hang
 him, if he could catch him or lay hands on him.  Thereupon, all
 the army proceeded to Windsor.  However it may be now, in those
 days the castle was not easy to take when any one chose to defend
 it.  The traitor made it secure, as soon as he planned his
 treacherous deed, with a triple line of walls and moats, and had
 so braced the walls inside with sharpened stakes that catapults
 could not throw them down.  They had taken great pains with the
 fortifications, spending all of June, July, and August in
 building walls and barricades, making moats and drawbridges,
 ditches, obstructions, and barriers, and iron portcullises and a
 great square tower of stone.  The gate was never closed from fear
 or against assault.  The castle stood upon a high hill, and
 around beneath it flows the Thames.  The host encamped on the
 river bank, and that day they have time only to pitch camp and
 set up the tents.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1261-1348.)  The army is in camp beside the Thames, and all
 the meadow is filled with green and red tents.  The sun, striking
 on the colours, causes the river to flash for more than a league
 around.  Those in the town had come down to disport themselves
 upon the river bank with only their lances in their hands and
 their shields grasped before their breasts, and carrying no other
 arms at all.  In coming thus, they showed those without the walls
 that they stood in no fear of them.  Alexander stood aloof and
 watched the knights disporting themselves at feats of arms.  He
 yearns to attack them, and summons his companions one by one by
 name.  First Cornix, whom he dearly loved, then the doughty
 Licorides, then Nabunal of Mvcene, and Acorionde of Athens, and
 Ferolin of Salonica, and Calcedor from Africa, Parmenides and
 Francagel, mighty Torin and Pinabel, Nerius and Neriolis.  "My
 lords," he says, "I feel the call to go with shield and lance to
 make the acquaintance of those who disport themselves yonder
 before our eyes.  I see they scorn us and hold us in slight
 esteem, when they come thus without their arms to exercise before
 our very eyes.  We have just been knighted, and have not yet
 given an account of ourselves against any knight or manikin. (17) 
 We have kept our first lances too long intact.  And for what were
 our shields intended?  As yet, they have not a hole or crack to
 show.  There is no use in having them except in a combat or a
 fight.  Let's cross the ford and rush at them!"  "We shall not
 fail you," all reply; and each one adds: "So help me God, who
 fails you now is no friend of yours."  Then they fasten on their
 swords, tighten their saddles and girths, and mount their steeds
 with shields in hand.  When they had hung the shields about their
 necks, and taken their lances with the gaily coloured ensigns,
 they all proceed to the ford at once.  Those on the farther side
 lower their lances, and quickly ride to strike at them.  But they
 (on the hither bank) knew how to pay them back, not sparing nor
 avoiding them, nor yielding to them a foot of ground.  Rather,
 each man struck his opponent so fiercely that there is no knight
 so brave but is compelled to leave the saddle.  They did not
 underestimate the experience, skill, and bravery of their
 antagonists, but made their first blows count, and unhorsed
 thirteen of them.  The report spread to the camp of the fight and
 of the blows that were being struck.  There would soon have been
 a merry strife if the others had dared to stand their ground. 
 All through the camp they run to arms, and raising a shout they
 cross the ford.  And those on the farther bank take to flight,
 seeing no advantage in staying where they are.  And the Greeks
 pursue them with blows of lance and sword.  Though they struck
 off many a head they themselves did not receive a wound, and gave
 a good account of themselves that day.  But Alexander
 distinguished himself, who by his own efforts led off four
 captive knights in bonds.  The sands are strewn with headless
 dead, while many others lie wounded and injured.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1349-1418.)  Alexander courteously presents the victims of
 his first conquest to the Queen, not wishing them to fall into
 the hands of the King, who would have had them all hanged.  The
 Queen, however, had them seized and safely kept under guard, as
 being charged with treason.  Throughout the camp they talk of the
 Greeks, and all maintain that Alexander acted very courteously
 and wisely in not surrendering the knights whom he had captured
 to the King, who would surely have had them burned or hanged. 
 But the King is not so well satisfied, and sending promptly to
 the Queen he bids her come into his presence and not detain those
 who have proved treacherous towards him, for either she must give
 them up or offend him by keeping them.  While the Queen was in
 conference with the King, as was necessary, about the traitors,
 the Greeks remained in the Queen's tent with her maids-in-
 waiting.  While his twelve companions conversed with them,
 Alexander uttered not a word.  Soredamors took note of this,
 seated as she was close by his side.  Her head resting upon her
 hand, it was plain that she was lost in thought. (18)  Thus they
 sat a long time, until Soredamors saw on his sleeve and about his
 neck the hair which she had stitched into the shirt.  Then she
 drew a little closer thinking now to find an excuse for speaking
 a word to him.  She considers how she can address him first, and
 what the first word is to be -- whether she should address him by
 his name; and thus she takes counsel with herself: "What shall I
 say first?" she says; "shall I address him by his name, or shall
 I call him `friend'?  Friend?  Not I.  How then?  Shall I call
 him by his name?  God!  The name of `friend' is fair and sweet to
 take upon the lips.  If I should dare to call him `friend.!
 Should I dare?  What forbids me to do so?  The fact that that
 implies a lie.  A lie?  I know not what the result will be, but I
 shall be sorry if I do not speak the truth.  Therefore, it is
 best to admit that I should not like to speak a lie.  God!  yet
 he would not speak a lie were he to call me his sweet friend! 
 And should I lie in thus addressing him?  We ought both to tell
 the truth.  But if I lie the fault is his.  But why does his name
 seem so hard to me that I should wish to replace it by a surname?
 I think it is because it is so long that I should stop in the
 middle.  But if I simply called him `friend', I could soon utter
 so short a name.  Fearing lest I should break down in uttering
 his proper name, I would fain shed my blood if his name were
 simply `my sweet friend.'"
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1419-1448.)  She turns this thought over in her mind until
 the Queen returns from the King who had summoned her.  Alexander,
 seeing her come, goes to meet her, and inquires what is the
 King's command concerning the prisoners, and what is to be their
 fate.  "Friend," says she, "he requires of me to surrender them
 at his discretion, and to let his justice be carried out. 
 Indeed, he is much incensed that I have not already handed them
 over.  So I must needs send them to him, since I see no help for
 it."  Thus they passed that day; and the next day there was a
 great assembly of all the good and loyal knights before the royal
 tent to sit in judgment and decide by what punishment and torture
 the four traitors should die.  Some hold that they should be
 flayed alive, and others that they should be hanged or burned.
 And the King, for his part, maintains that traitors ought to be
 torn asunder.  Then he commands them to be brought in.  When they
 are brought, he orders them to be bound, and says that they shall
 not be torn asunder until they are taken beneath the town, so
 that those within may see the sight. (19)
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1449-1472.)  When this sentence was pronounced, the King
 addresses Alexander, calling him his dear friend.  "My friend,"
 he says, "yesterday I saw you attack and defend yourself with
 great bravery.  I wish now to reward your action!  I will add to
 your company five hundred Welsh knights and one thousand troopers
 from that land.  In addition to what I have given you, when the
 war is over I will crown you king of the best kingdom in Wales.
 Towns and castles, cities and halls will I give you until the
 time you receive the land which your father holds, and of which
 you are to be emperor."  Alexander's companions join him in
 thanking the King kindly for this boon, and all the nobles of the
 court say that the honour which the King has bestowed upon
 Alexander is well deserved.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1473-1490.)  As soon as Alexander sees his force, consisting
 of the companions and the men-at-arms whom it had pleased the
 King to give him, straightway they begin to sound the horns and
 trumpets throughout the camp.  Men of Wales and Britain, of
 Scotland and Cornwall, both good and bad without exception -- all
 take arms, for the forces of the host were recruited from all
 quarters.  The Thames was low because of the drought resulting
 from a summer without rain, so that all the fish were dead, and
 the ships were stranded upon the shore, and it was possible to
 ford the stream even in the widest part.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1491-1514.)  After fording the Thames, the army divided,
 some taking possession of the valley, and others occupying the
 high ground.  Those in the town take notice of them, and when
 they see approaching the wonderful array, bent upon reducing and
 taking the town, they prepare on their side to defend it.  But
 before any assault is made, the King has the traitors drawn by
 four horses through the valleys and over the hills and unploughed
 fields.  At this Count Angres is much distressed, when he sees
 those whom he held dear dragged around outside the town.  And his
 people, too, are much dismayed, but in spite of the anxiety which
 they feel, they have no mind to yield the place.  They must needs
 defend themselves, for the King makes it plain to all that he is
 angry, and ill-disposed, and they see that if he should lay hands
 upon them he would make them die a shameful death.
 </p><p>
 (Vv.1515-1552.)  When the four had been torn asunder and their
 limbs lay strewn upon the field, then the assault begins.  But
 all their labour is in vain, for no matter how much they cast and
 shoot, their efforts are of no effect.  Yet they strive to do
 their utmost, hurling their javelins amain, and shooting darts
 and bolts.  On all sides is heard the din of cross-bows and
 slings as the arrows and the round stones fly thick, like rain
 mixed with hail.  Thus all day long the struggle of attack and
 defence continues, until the night separates them.  And the King
 causes to be proclaimed what gift he will bestow upon him who
 shall effect the surrender of the town: a cup of great price
 weighing fifteen marks of gold, the richest in his treasure,
 shall be his reward.  The cup will be very fine and rich, and, to
 tell the truth, the cup is to be esteemed for the workmanship
 rather than for the material of which it is made.  But good as
 the workmanship may be, and fine though the gold, if the truth be
 told, the precious stones set in the outside of the cup were of
 most value.  He through whose efforts the town shall be taken is
 to have the cup, if he be only a foot soldier; and if the town is
 taken by a knight, with the cup in his possession he shall never
 seek his fortune in vain, if there is any to be found in the
 world.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1553-1712.)  When this news was announced, Alexander had not
 forgotten his custom of going to see the Queen each evening. 
 That night, too, he had gone thither and was seated beside the
 Queen.  Soredamors was sitting alone close by them, looking at
 him with such satisfaction that she would not have exchanged her
 lot for Paradise.  The Queen took Alexander by the hand, and
 examined the golden thread which was showing the effects of wear;
 but the strand of hair was becoming more lustrous, while the
 golden thread was tarnishing.  And she laughed as she happened to
 recall that the embroidery was the work of Soredamors.  Alexander
 noticed this, and begged her to tell him, if suitable, why she
 laughed.  The Queen was slow to make reply, and looking toward
 Soredamors, bade her come to her.  Gladly she went and knelt
 before her.  Alexander was overjoyed when he saw her draw so near
 that he could have touched her.  But he is not so bold as even to
 look at her; but rather does he so lose his senses that he is
 well-nigh speechless.  And she, for her part, is so overcome that
 she has not the use of her eyes; but she casts her glance upon
 the ground without fastening it upon anything.  The Queen marvels
 greatly at seeing her now pale, now crimson, and she notes well
 in her heart the bearing and expression of each of them.  She
 notices and thinks she sees that these changes of colour are the
 fruit of love.  But not wishing to embarrass them, she pretends
 to understand nothing of what she sees.  In this she did well,
 for she gave no evidence of what was in her mind beyond saying:
 "Look here, damsel, and tell us truly where the shirt was sewed
 that this knight has on, and if you had any hand in it or worked
 anything of yours into it."  Though the maiden feels some shame,
 yet she tells the story gladly; for she wishes the truth to be
 known by him, who, when he hears her tell of how the shirt was
 made, can hardly restrain himself for joy from worshipping and
 adoring the golden hair.  His companions and the Queen, who were
 with him, annoy him and embarrass him; for their presence
 prevents him from raising the hair to his eyes and mouth, as he
 would fain have done, had he not thought that it would be
 remarked.  He is glad to have so much of his lady, but he does
 not hope or expect ever to receive more from her: his very desire
 makes him dubious.  Yet, when he has left the Queen and is by
 himself, he kisses it more than a hundred thousand times, feeling
 how fortunate he is.  All night long he makes much of it, but is
 careful that no one shall see him.  As he lies upon his bed, he
 finds a vain delight and solace in what can give him no
 satisfaction.  All night he presses the shirt in his arms, and
 when he looks at the golden hair, he feels like the lord of the
 whole wide world.  Thus Love makes a fool of this sensible man,
 who finds his delight in a single hair and is in ecstasy over its
 possession.  But this charm will come to an end for him before
 the sun's bright dawn.  For the traitors are met in council to
 discuss what they can do; and what their prospects are.  To be
 sure they will be able to make a long defence of the town if they
 determine so to do; but they know the King's purpose to be so
 firm that he will not give up his efforts to take the town so
 long as he lives, and when that time comes they needs must die.
 And if they should surrender the town, they need expect no mercy
 for doing so.  Thus either outcome looks dark indeed, for they
 see no help, but only death in either case.  But this decision at
 last is reached, that the next morning, before dawn appears, they
 shall issue secretly from the town and find the camp disarmed,
 and the knights still sleeping in their beds.  Before they wake
 and get their armour on there will have been such slaughter done
 that posterity will always speak of the battle of that night.
 Having no further confidence in life, the traitors as a last
 resort all subscribe to this design.  Despair emboldened them to
 fight, whatever the result might be; for they see nothing sure in
 store for them save death or imprisonment.  Such an outcome is
 not attractive; nor do they see any use in flight, for they see
 no place where they could find refuge should they betake
 themselves to flight, being completely surrounded by the water
 and their enemies.  So they spend no more time in talk, but arm
 and equip themselves and make a sally by an old postern gate (20)
 toward the north-west, that being the side where they thought the
 camp would least expect attack.  In serried ranks they sallied
 forth, and divided their force into five companies, each
 consisting of two thousand well armed foot, in addition to a
 thousand knights.  That night neither star nor moon had shed a
 ray across the sky.  But before they reached the tents, the moon
 began to show itself, and I think it was to work them woe that it
 rose sooner than was its wont.  Thus God, who opposed their
 enterprise, illumined the darkness of the night, having no love
 for these evil men, but rather hating them for their sin.  For
 God hates traitors and treachery more than any other sin.  So the
 moon began to shine in order to hamper their enterprise.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1713-1858.)  They are much hampered by the moon, as it
 shines upon their shields, and they are handicapped by their
 helmets, too, as they glitter in the moonlight.  They are
 detected by the pickets keeping watch over the host, who now
 shout throughout the camp: "Up. knights, up!  Rise quickly, take
 your arms and arm yourselves!  The traitors are upon us." 
 Through all the camp they run to arms, and hastily strive to
 equip themselves in the urgent need; but not a single one of them
 left his place until they were all comfortably armed and mounted
 upon their steeds.  While they are arming themselves, the
 attacking forces are eager for battle and press forward, hoping
 to catch them off their guard and find them disarmed.  They bring
 up from different directions the five companies into which they
 had divided their troops: some hug the woods, others follow the
 river, the third company deploys upon the plain, while the fourth
 enters a valley, and the fifth proceeds beside a rocky cliff. 
 For they planned to fall upon the tents suddenly with great fury.
 But they did not find the path clear.  For the King's men resist
 them, defying them courageously and reproaching them for their
 treason.  Their iron lance-tips are splintered and shattered as
 they meet; they come together with swords drawn, striking each
 other and casting each other down upon the face.  They rush upon
 each other with the fury of lions, which devour whatever they
 capture.  In this first rush there was heavy slaughter on both
 sides.  When they can no longer maintain themselves, help comes
 to the traitors, who are defending themselves bravely and selling
 their lives dearly.  They see their troops from four sides arrive
 to succour them.  And the King's men ride hard with spur to
 attack them.  They deal such blows upon their shields that,
 beside the wounded, they unhorse more than five hundred of them.
 Alexander, with his Greeks, has no thought of sparing them,
 making every effort to prevail into the thickest of the fight he
 goes to strike a knave whose shield and hauberk are of no avail
 to keep him from falling to the earth.  When he has finished with
 him, he offers his service to another freely and without stint,
 and serves him, too, so savagely that he drives the soul from his
 body quite, and leaves the apartment without a tenant.  After
 these two, he addresses himself to another, piercing a noble and
 courteous knight clean through and through, so that the blood
 spurts out on the other side, and his expiring soul takes leave
 of the body.  Many he killed and many stunned, for like a flying
 thunderbolt he blasts all those whom he seeks out.  Neither coat
 of mail nor shield can protect him whom he strikes with lance or
 sword.  His companions, too, are generous in the spilling of
 blood and brains, for they, too, know well how to deal their
 blows.  And the royal troops butcher so many of them that they
 break them up and scatter them like low-born folk who have lost
 their heads.  So many dead lay about the fields, and so long did
 the battle rage, that long before the day dawned the ranks were
 so cut in pieces that the rows of dead stretched for five leagues
 along the stream.  Count Angres leaves his banner on the field
 and steals away, accompanied by only seven of his men.  Towards
 his town he made his way by a secret path, thinking that no one
 could see him.  But Alexander notices this, and sees them
 escaping from the troops, and he thinks that if he can slip away
 without the knowledge of any one, he will go to catch up with
 them.  But before he got down into the valley, he saw thirty
 knights following him down the path, of whom six were Greeks, and
 twenty-four were men of Wales.  These intended to follow him at a
 distance until he should stand in need of them.  When Alexander
 saw them coming, he stopped to wait for them, without failing to
 observe what course was taken by those who were making their way
 back to the town.  Finally, he saw them enter it.  Then he began
 to plan a very daring deed and a very marvellous design.  And
 when he had made up his mind, he turned toward his companions and
 thus addressed them: "My lords," says he, "whether it be folly or
 wisdom, frankly grant me my desire if you care for my good-will."
 And they promised him never to oppose his will in aught.  Then he
 says: "Let us change our outer gear, by taking the shields and
 lances from the traitors whom we have killed.  Thus, when we
 approach the town, the traitors within will suppose that we are
 of their party, and regardless of the fate in store for them,
 they will throw open the gates for us.  And do you know what
 reward we shall offer them?  If God so will we shall take them
 all dead or alive.  Now, if any of you repents of his promise, be
 sure that, so long as I live, I shall never hold him dear."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1859-1954.)  All the others grant his boon, and, despoiling
 the corpses of their shields, they arm themselves with them
 instead.  The men within the town had mounted to the battlements,
 and, recognising the shields, suppose that they belong to their
 party, never dreaming of the ruse hidden beneath the shields. 
 The gatekeeper opens the gate for them and admits them to the
 town.  He is beguiled and deceived in not addressing them a word;
 for no one of them speaks to him, but silently and mute they
 pass, making such a show of grief that they trail their lances
 after them and support themselves upon their shields.  Thus it
 seems that they are in great distress, as they pass on at their
 own sweet will until they are within the triple walls.  Inside
 they find a number of men-at-arms and knights with the Count.  I
 cannot tell you just how many; but they were unarmed, except
 eight of them who had just returned from the fight, and even they
 were preparing to remove their arms.  But their haste was ill
 considered; for now the other party make no further pretence, but
 without any challenge by way of warning, they brace themselves in
 the stirrups, and let their horses charge straight at them,
 attacking them with such rigour that they lay low more than
 thirty-one of them.  The traitors in great dismay shout out: "We
 are betrayed, betrayed!"  But the assailants take no heed of
 this, and let those whom they find unarmed feel the temper of
 their swords.  Indeed, three of those whom they found still armed
 were so roughly handled that but five remained alive.  Count
 Angres rushed at Calcedor, and in the sight of all struck him
 upon his golden shield with such violence that he stretched him
 dead upon the ground.  Alexander is greatly troubled, and is
 almost beside himself with rage when he sees his companion dead;
 his blood boils with anger, but his strength and courage are
 doubled as he strikes the Count with such fury that he breaks his
 lance.  If possible, he would avenge his friend.  But the Count
 was a powerful man and a good and hardy knight, whose match it
 would have been hard to find, had he not been a base traitor.  He
 now returns the blow, making his lance double up so that it
 splits and breaks; but the other's shield holds firm, and neither
 gives way before the other any more than a rock would do, for
 both men were passing strong.  But the fact that the Count was in
 the wrong disturbs him greatly and troubles him. (21)  The anger
 of each rises higher as they both draw their swords after their
 lances had been broken.  No escape would have been possible if
 these two swordsmen had persisted in continuing the fight.  But
 at last one or the other must die.  The Count dares not longer
 hold his ground, when he sees lying dead about him his men who
 had been caught unarmed.  Meanwhile the others press them hard,
 cutting, slashing, and carving them, spilling their brains, and
 reproaching the Count for his treachery.  When he hears himself
 accused of treason, he flees for safety to his tower, followed by
 his men.  And their enemies follow after them, fiercely charging
 them from the rear, and not letting a single one escape of all
 upon whom they lay their hands.  They kill and slay so many of
 them that I guess not more than seven made good their escape.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1955-2056.)  When they had got inside the tower, they made a
 stand at the gate; for those who were coming close behind had
 followed so closely after them that they too would have pressed
 in had the gateway been left exposed.  The traitors make a brave
 defence, waiting for succour from their friends, who were arming
 themselves down in the town.  But upon the advice of Nabunal, who
 was a Greek of great wisdom, the approach was blocked so that
 relief could not arrive in time; for those below had tarried too
 long, either from cowardice or sloth.  Now there was only one
 entrance to the stronghold; so that, if they stop that entrance-
 way, they need have no fear that any force shall approach to do
 them harm.  Nabunal bids and exhorts twenty of them to hold the
 gate; for soon such a company might arrive with force as would do
 them harm by their assault and attack.  While these twenty hold
 the gate, the remaining ten should attack the tower and prevent
 the Count from barricading himself inside.  Nabunal's advice is
 taken: ten remain to continue the assault at the entrance of the
 tower, while twenty go to defend the gate.  In doing so, they
 delay almost too long; for they see approaching, furious and keen
 for the fight, a company containing many cross-bow men and foot
 soldiers of different grades who carried arms of divers sorts.
 Some carried light missiles, and others Danish axes, lances and
 Turkish swords, bolts for cross-bows, arrows and javelins.  The
 Greeks would have had to pay a heavy score, if this crowd had
 actually fallen upon them; but they did not reach the place in
 time.  Nabunal by his foresight and counsel had blocked their
 plans, and they were forced to remain outside.  When they see
 that they are shut out, they pause in their advance, as it is
 evident they can gain nothing by making an assault.  Then there
 begins such weeping and wailing of women and young children, of
 old men and youths, that those in the town could not have heard a
 thunder-clap from heaven.  At this the Greeks are overjoyed; for
 now they know of a certainty that the Count by no good luck can
 escape capture.  Four of them mount the walls to keep watch lest
 those outside by any means or ruse should enter the stronghold
 and fall upon them.  The remaining sixteen returned to where the
 ten were fighting.  The day was already breaking, and the ten had
 fought so well that they had forced their way within the tower.
 The Count took his stand against a post, and, armed with a
 battleaxe, defended himself with great bravery.  Those whom he
 reaches, he splits in half.  And his men line up about him, and
 are not slow to avenge themselves in this last stand of the day,
 Alexander's men have reason to complain, for of the original
 sixteen there remain now but thirteen.  Alexander is almost
 beside himself when he sees the havoc wrought among his dead or
 exhausted followers.  Yet his thoughts are fixed on vengeance:
 finding at hand a long heavy club, he struck one of the rascals
 with it so fiercely that neither shield nor hauberk was worth a
 button in preventing him from failing to the ground.  After
 finishing with him, he pursues the Count, and raising his club to
 strike him he deals him such a blow with his square club that the
 axe falls from his hands; and he was so stunned and bewildered
 that he could not have stood up unless he had leaned against the
 wall.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2057-2146.)  After this blow the battle ceases.  Alexander 
 leaps at the Count and holds him so that he cannot move.  Of the
 others nothing need be said, for they were easily mastered when
 they saw the capture of their lord.  All are made prisoners with
 the Count and led away in disgrace, in accordance with their
 deserts.  Of all this the men outside knew nothing.  But when
 morning came they found their companions shields lying among the
 slain when the battle was over.  Then the Greeks, misled, made a
 great lament for their lord.  Recognising his shield, all are in
 an agony of grief, swooning at sight of his shield and saying
 that now they have lived too long.  Cornix and Nerius first
 swoon, then, recovering their senses, wish they were dead.  So do
 Torin and Acorionde.  The tears run down in floods from their
 eyes upon their breasts.  Life and joy seem hateful now.  And
 Parmenides more than the rest tore his hair in dire distress.  No
 greater grief could be shown than that of these five for their
 lord.  Yet, their dismay is groundless, for it is another's body
 which they bear away when they think to have their lord.  Their
 distress is further increased by the sight of the other shields,
 which cause them to mistake these corpses for their companions.
 So over them they lament and swoon.  But they are deceived by all
 these shields, for of their men only one was killed, whose name
 was Neriolis.  Him, indeed, they would have borne away had they
 known the truth.  But they are in as great anxiety for the others
 as for him; so they bore them all away.  In every case but one
 they were misled.  But like the man who dreams and takes a
 fiction for the truth, so the shields cause them to suppose this
 illusion to be a reality.  It is the shields, then, that cause
 this mistake. (22)  Carrying the corpses, they move away and come
 to their tents, where there was a sorrowing troop.  Upon hearing
 the lament raised by the Greeks, soon all the others gathered,
 until there was but one great outcry.  Now Saredamors thinks of
 her wretched estate when she hears the cry and lament over her
 lover.  Their anguish and distress cause her to lose her senses
 and her colour, and her grief and sorrow are increased because
 she dares not openly show a trace of her distress.  She shut up
 her grief within her heart.  Had any one looked at her, he could
 have seen by the expression of her face what agony she was in;
 but every one was so engrossed with his own sorrow that he had no
 care for another's grief.  Each one lamented his own loss.  For
 they find the river bank covered with their relatives and
 friends, who had been wounded or roughly treated.  Each one wept
 for his own heavy and bitter loss: here is a son weeping for a
 father, there a father for a son; one swoons at the sight of his
 cousin, another over his nephew.  Thus fathers, brothers, and
 relatives bemoan their loss on every side.  But above all is
 noticeable the sorrow of the Greeks; and yet they might have
 anticipated great joy, for the deepest grief of all the camp will
 soon be changed into rejoicing.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2147-2200.)  The Greeks outside continue their lament, while
 those inside strive to let them know the news which will cause
 them to rejoice.  They disarm and bind their prisoners, who pray
 and beg of them to strike off their heads straightway.  But the
 Greeks are unwilling, and disdain their entreaties, saying that
 them will keep then under guard and hand them over to the King,
 who will grant them such recompense as shall require their
 services.  When they had disarmed them all they made them go up
 on the wall that they might be seen by the troops below.  This
 privilege is not to their liking, and when they saw their lord
 bound as a prisoner, they were unhappy men.  Alexander upon the
 walls swears to God and all the saints that he will not let one
 of them live, but will kill them all speedily, unless they will
 go to surrender to the King before he can seize them.  "Go," says
 he, "confidently to the King at my command, and cast yourselves
 upon his mercy.  None of you, except the Count, has deserved to
 die.  You shall not lose either life or limb if you surrender to
 the King.  If you do not deliver yourselves from death by crying
 for mercy, you need have little hope of saving your lives or
 bodies.  Go forth disarmed to meet the King, and tell him from me
 that Alexander sends you to him.  Your action will not be in
 vain; for my lord the King is so gentle and courteous that he
 will lay aside his wrath and anger.  But if you wish to act
 otherwise, you must expect to die, for his heart will be closed
 to pity."  All agree in accepting this advice, and do not
 hesitate until they come to the King's tent, where they all fall
 at his feet.  The story they told was soon known throughout the
 camp.  The King and all his men mounted and spurred their horses
 to the town without delay.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2201-2248.)  Alexander goes out from the town to meet the
 King, who was greatly pleased, and to surrender to him the Count.
 The King did not delay in fitly punishing him.  But Alexander is
 congratulated and praised by the King and all the others who
 esteem him highly.  Their joy drives away the grief which they
 had felt not long before.  But no joy of the others can compare
 with the exultation of the Greeks.  The King presents him with
 the precious cup, weighing fifteen marks, and tells him
 confidently that there is nothing in his possession so valuable
 that he would not place it in his hands upon request -- save only
 the crown and the Queen.  Alexander dares not mention his heart's
 desire, though he knows well that he would not be refused in
 asking for his sweetheart's hand.  But he fears so much lest he
 might displease her, whose heart would have been made glad, that
 he prefers to suffer without her rather than to win her against
 her will.  Therefore, he asks for a little time, not wishing to
 prefer his request until he is sure of her pleasure.  But he
 asked for no respite or delay in accepting the cup of gold.  He
 takes the cup, and courteously begs my lord Gawain to accept this
 cup as a gift from him, which Gawain did most reluctantly.  When
 Soredamors learned the truth about Alexander she was greatly
 pleased and delighted.  When she heard that he was alive, she was
 so happy that it seemed to her as though she could never be sad
 again.  But she reflects that he is slower in coming than is his
 wont.  Yet in good time she will have her wish, for both of them
 in rivalry are occupied with one common thought.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2249-2278.)  It seemed to Alexander an age before he could
 feast his eyes with even one soft glance from her.  Long ago he
 would fain have gone to the Queen's tent, if he had not been
 detained elsewhere.  He was much put out by this delay, and as
 soon as he could, he betook himself to the Queen in her tent. 
 The Queen went to greet him, and, without his having confided in
 her, she had already read his thoughts, and knew what was passing
 in his mind.  She greets him at the entrance of the tent, and
 strives to make him welcome, well knowing for what purpose he has
 come.  Desirous of according him a favour, she beckons Soredamors
 to join them, and they three engage in conversation at some
 distance from the rest.  The Queen first speaks, in whose mind
 there was no doubt that this couple were in love.  Of this fact
 she is quite sure, and is persuaded moreover that Soredamors
 could not have a better lover.  She took her place between the
 two and began to say what was appropriate.

 (1)  There is no English version corresponding to the old French
      "Cliges".  The English metrical romance "Sir Cleges" has
      nothing to do with the French romance.
 <p>
 (2)  Ovid in "Metamorphosis", vi. 404, relates how Tantalus at a
      feast to the gods offered them the shoulder of his own son. 
      It is not certain, however, that Chretien is referring here
      to this slight episode of the "Metamorphosis".
 </p><p>
 (3)  This allusion is generally taken as evidence that the poet
      had written previously of the love of Tristan and Iseut. 
      Gaston Paris, however, in one of his last utterances
      ("Journal des Savants", 1902, p. 297), says: "Je n'hesite
      pas a dire que l'existence d'un poeme sur Tristan par
      Chretien de Troies, a laquelle j'ai cru comme presque tout
      le monde, me parait aujourd'hui fort peu probable; j'en vais
      donner les raisons."
 </p><p>
 (4)  The story of Philomela or Philomena, familiar in Chaucer's
      "Legende of Good Women", is told by Ovid in "Metamorphosis",
      vi. 426-674.  Cretiens li Gois is cited by the author of the
      "Ovide moralise" as the author of the episode of Philomena
      incorporated in his long didactic poem.  This episode has
      been ascribed to Chretien de Troyes by many recent critics,
      and has been separately edited by C. de Boer, who offers in
      his Introduction a lengthy discussion of its authorship. 
      See C. de Boer, "Philomena, conte raconte d'apres Ovide par
      Chretien de Troyes" (Paris, 1909).

 (5)  The present cathedral of Beauvais is dedicated to St. Peter,
      and its construction was begun in 1227.  The earlier
      structure here referred to, destroyed in 1118, probably was
      also dedicated to the same saint. (F.)
 </p><p>
 (6)  The real kernal of the Cliges story, stripped of its lengthy
      introduction concerning Alexandre and Soredamors, is told in
      a few lines in "Marques de Rome", p. 135 (ed. J. Alton in
      "Lit. Verein in Stuttgart", No. 187, Tubingen, 1889), as one
      of the tales or "exempla" recounted by the Empress of Rome
      to the Emperor and the Seven Sages.  No names are given
      except that of Cliges himself; the version owes nothing to
      Chretien's poem, and seems to rest upon a story which the
      author may have heard orally.  See Foerster's "Einleitung to
      Cliges" (1910), p. 32 f.

 (7)  This criticism of ignoble leisure on the part of a warrior
      is found also in "Erec et Enide" and "Yvain".
 </p><p>
 (8)  This allegorical tribute to "largesse" is quite in the
      spirit of the age.  When professional poets lived upon the
      bounty of their patrons, it is not strange that their poetry
      should dwell upon the importance of generosity in their
      heroes.  For an exhaustive collection of "chastisements" or
      "enseignements", such as that here given to Alexandre by his
      father, see Eugen Altner, "Ueber die chastiements in den
      altfranzosischen chansons de geste" (Leipzig, 1885).
 </p><p>
 (9)  As Miss Weston has remarked ("The Three Days' Tournament",
      p. 45), the peculiar georgraphy of this poem "is distinctly
      Anglo-Norman rather than Arthurian".
 </p><p>
 (10) For this intimate relation between heroes, so common in the
      old French heroic and romantic poems, see Jacques Flach, "Le
      compagnonnage dans les chansons de geste" in "Etudes

      "Romania", xxii. 145.

 (11) Here begins one of those long dialogues, where one person is
      represented as taking both sides of an argument.  This
      rhetorical device, so wearisome to modern readers, is used
      by Chretien preferably when some sentiment or deep emotion
      is to be portrayed.  Ovid may well have suggested the
      device, but Ovid never abuses it as does the more prolix
      mediaeval poet.  For the part playing by the eyes in
      mediaeval love sophistry, see J.F. Hanford, "The Debate of
      Heart and Eye" in "Modern Language Notes", xxvi. 161-165;
      and H.R. Lang, "The Eyes as Generators of Love." id. xxiii.

      names in mediaeval romance literature, see the interesting
      article of Adolf Tobler in "Vermischte Beitrage", ii. 211-
      266.  Gaston Paris ("Journal des Savants", 1902, p. 354)
      points out that Thomas used the same scene and the play upon
      the same words "mer", "amer", and "amers" in his "Tristan"
      and was later imitated by Gottfried von Strassburg.

 (15) Ganelon, the traitor in the "Chanson de Roland", to whose
      charge is laid the defeat of Charlemagne's rear-guard at
      Ronceval, became the arch-traitor of mediaeval literature. 
      It will be recalled that Dante places him in the lowest pit
      of Hell ("Inferno", xxxii. 122). (NOTE: There is a slight
      time discrepance here.  Roland, Ganelon, and the Battle of
      Ronceval were said to have happened in 8th Century A.D.,
      fully 300 years after Arthur and the Round Table. -- DBK).

      knighthood, see Karl Treis, "Die Formalitaten des
      Ritterschlags in der altfranzosischen Epik" (Berlin, 1887).
 </p><p>
 (17) The "quintainne" was "a manikin mounted on a pivot and armed
      with a club in such a way that, when a man struck it
      unskilfully with his lance, it turned and landed a blow upon
      his back" (Larousse).
 </p><p>
 (18) This conventional attitude of one engaged in thought or a
      prey to sadness has been referred to by G.L. Hamilton in
      "Ztsch fur romanische Philologie", xxxiv. 571-572.
 </p><p>
 (19) Many traitors in old French literature suffered the same
      punishments as Ganelon, and were drawn asunder by horses
      ("Roland", 3960-74).
 </p><p>
 (20) The same rare words "galerne" and "posterne" occur in rhyme
      in the "Roman de Thebes", 1471-72.
 </p><p>
 (21) This qualified praise is often used in speaking of traitors
      and of Saracens.
 </p><p>
 (22) The failure to identify the warriors is due to the fact that
      the knights are totally encased in armour.
