 <h3 align="CENTER">THE TIP BEETLE'S REVENGE <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">17a</font></a></h3>
 <p>There was a boy who never obeyed his father and mother. Every little animal that came near him, he stepped on it, and when he came across a snake he threw stones at it and killed it. One morning he started to go out and his father and mother said, "Don't kill any little bugs or snakes on your way." But he didn't mind; he stepped on bugs and threw stones at the snakes. The spirits of the bugs and snakes were angry. They had a meeting at night and they said, "We can not stand this any more. He has hurt a great number of us."

He kicked the tip beetle and just as he kicked him, tip beetle stood on his head and stung him right in the middle of his foot. The boy screamed, "Ouch!" He sat down and tip beetle went off; he didn't kill him. The boy couldn't stand up any more; his leg was all swollen up. He, was angry and he kept on screaming. A man came along from his fields and asked, "What is the matter?" "I was about to kick a tip beetle, but it stung me on my foot." "Now you see what you get for being such a cruel boy. You'll see!" He carried the boy home on his back. By the time they got to his home, he was all swollen up and he died that night. So the little bug killed him.</p>
