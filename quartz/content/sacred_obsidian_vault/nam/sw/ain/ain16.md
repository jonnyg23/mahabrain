 <h3 align="CENTER">THE STORY OF WAYHOHM, TOEHAHVS AND TOTTAI</h3>
 <p>AND Seeollstchewadack Seeven wondered what this action of the bird meant, and he studied about it till he found out who it was that had sent the bird and for what purpose.</p>
 <p>And he sent a cold rain upon the home of Dthas; Seeven. And it rained a heavy rain for three days and three nights, so hard that it put out all the fires in the city of Dthas Seeven, and Dthas Seeven was dying with cold.</p>
 <p>And the people came about him to witness his dying, and they said: "Let us send some one to get the fire!" And they sent Toehahvs.</p>
 <p>And Toehahvs went, and at last came to a house where he heard the fire roaring within. And he looked in, and there was a big fire. And he sat in the doorway holding out his paws toward the heat.</p>
 <p>And the owner of the house, whose name was <i>Way-hohm</i>, or the Lightning, sat working within with his face to the fire and his back to Toehahvs. And Toehahvs wanted to dash in and steal some fire, but he did not dare, and he went back and told the people he had seen the fire but he could not get it.</p>
 <p>On the fourth day it was still raining, and they sent another person. And this time they sent Tot-tai, or the Road Runner, for they said he could run almost as fast as Toehahvs.</p>

 <p>And Tottai came to the same house, and heard the fire, and peeped in the door to warm himself. And there sat the owner of the fire, Wayhohm, working with his face to the fire and his back to Tottai. And Tottai dashed in and caught hold of a stick with fire at one end and ran out with it.</p>
 <p>And Wayhohm caught up his bow, the Bow-of-the-Lightning, <i>Way-hohm-a-Gaht</i>, and fired at Road Runner, and struck him on the side of his head, and that is why the side of Tottai's head is still bare; and Tottai ran on, and Wayhohm shot at him again and struck the other side of his head.</p>
 <p>And Tottai whirled around then so that the sparks flew every way, and got into all kinds of wood, and that is why there is fire in all kinds of sticks even now, and the Indian can get it out by rubbing them together to this day.</p>
 <p>But Tottai kept on, and got to the house of Dthas Seeven all right, and they made a fire, and Dthas Seeven got better again.</p>
