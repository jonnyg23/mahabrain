 <h1 align="CENTER">Marriage</h1>
 <p>When a man of one town likes a girl of another town his relatives take [part of] their property and go to buy her. They send messengers. The [girl's relatives] keep the dentalia [which have been sent them] and the messengers go home. Now the girl's father divides that property among all his relatives. Now her mother prepares her dentalia and the people make themselves ready. They bring her to the town where the people live who have bought her. They bring the bride to the groom. When they had given a small amount only in payment, they add to the purchase money, giving more dentalia and several slaves to her father. Now the [amount paid] is sufficient. The relatives of the girl stand outside the house. They put on their blankets, dance, and sing conjurer's songs. Now the man's relatives run to the other party and take off their blankets. This is done three or four times. Now a road is strewn with dentalia by the man's relatives. When it is finished a woman carries the girl over it on her back. A blanket is pulled over her head, so that her face can not be seen. Two or three blankets are laid down. The woman who carries her receives a payment of dentalia. When she lifts her load again, she receives blankets in payment. She lifts her once more. She receives much property for carrying her on her back. At last she puts her down on those blankets. Now the relatives of the girl bring her dentalia. They are torn over her head, and [they feign to] louse her. Dentalia are also strewn on the man's head by his relatives and they feign to louse him. Now the girl's relatives bring her food. This food is divided among those who helped [in the ceremonies]. Then the woman's relatives return the purchase money. When ten blankets are paid, they refund eight. When five were paid, four are refunded. When much food is brought to her, the man's relatives pay once more, and this purchase money is also returned.</p>
 <p>The relatives of the married couple transact the purchase. [Male and] female relatives of a married couple are [called] Lâ'qoqcin.</p>
 <p>When the relative of a family who is married in another village gives birth to a child and the child dies, the woman's father gives a slave or a canoe. He pays indemnity. When [the young wife] gathers roots or berries, she distributes them among the people who bought</p>

 <p>her. This is done every year when she goes to gather berries. When her husband dies she is taken to his younger brother. If he has no younger brother, she is taken to his father. If he has no father, she taken to one of his relatives. Then the relatives of her husband feel satisfied.</p>
 <p>When a youth tries to buy a wife and his property is refused, he may try twice or three times. If he is still refused, he hides in the woods. in order to wait for the girl. Often he meets her there and carries her away. She goes to him. Then her relatives have lost her. Her relatives learn where she is. If she has elder brothers, they all go to take her back. They arrive at the place where she is and carry her back home. After several days she leaves again and goes to the young man. Her relatives go again and carry her back. When she leaves a third time they let her go. Sometimes she is allowed [to stay with the man] after she has left three times. Now she is bought for a small amount of property. They are married. All her relatives go to [attend the marriage]. If the man has no property, they live with his father-in-law. He looks after his father-in-law's house. He looks after his fire and catches salmon for his wife's relatives.</p>
 <p>If a man's wife is carried away, many slaves are paid to him as an indemnity, and he is satisfied. If he is not paid indemnity he kills [the abductor]. If he does not find him he kills one of his relatives. Then a family feud arises. It is the same when the wife of a man's deceased brother is taken away. Then, also, indemnity is paid and he is satisfied.</p>
