 <p>"'Now another message.</p>
 <p>"'The Creator who made you is sad.</p>
 <p>"'The Creator made every person with a different face.</p>
 <p>"'Now a man talks saying that he is far more handsome than other men. He boasts that he is exceedingly handsome and grand. But the Creator says all this is very wrong. The vain must repent and never boast again.' So they said.</p>
 <p>"'Now animals seem alike to you. A wild animal that you have once seen you can not easily say you have seen again. But people are different before you. Now when a man is handsome let him thank his Creator for his comliness.' So they said.</p>
 <p>"'Now furthermore a man says "I am the strongest man of all. There is no one who can throw me to the ground." A man who talks thus is a boaster before the people. Now the Creator says</p>
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>
 <p>that such boasting is evil. The Creator endowed the man with strength and therefore he should not boast but thank the giver who is the Creator. So tell your people these things.' So they said.</p>
 <p>"'Now furthermore a man says, "I am the swiftest runner of the world. No one can outrun me." Now he regards himself as a mighty man and boasts before his people. Now the Creator says that such boasting is evil. The Creator endowed the man with his speed and he should offer thanks and not boast. So we, the messengers, say your people must cease their boasting.'" <a name="fr_31"></a><a href="cohl037.htm#fn_31"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
 <p>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</p>
