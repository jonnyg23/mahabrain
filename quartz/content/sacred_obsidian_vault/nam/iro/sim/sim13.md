 <p>A YOUNG woman lived alone on the bank of a large river. One day she thought, "I am old enough to have a husband. It is lonely here by myself."</p>  
 <p>She oiled her hair, painted her face red, put on her best clothes and went to a spring. She dipped up a bucket of water and looking in it said, "I am nice enough for any man."</p>  
 <p>Then she started off along the bank of the river that ran through a forest. Toward midday she came to a place where she saw signs of people living near, and, seating herself on a log she began to sing, "I wonder if any man around here wants a wife. I wonder if any man around here wants a wife."</p>  
 <p>Soon some one far off in the forest answered, "I want a wife. I want a wife."</p>  
 <p>Then the woman sang back, "What will we live on? What will we live on when we live together?"</p>  
 <p>And he sang, "We will live on moss."</p>  
 <p>And she, singing, answered, "I couldn't live on moss. I am too good for such coarse food; I'm a nice looking girl."</p>  
 <p>Again she traveled along the bank of the river. It was near sunset when the young woman came to a place where she saw signs of people living near. She seated herself on a log and sang, "I wonder if any man around here wants a wife. I wonder if any man around here wants a wife."</p>  
 <p>Some one, not far off, answered, singing, "I want a wife. I want a wife."</p>  
 <p>Then she sang, "What will we live on? What will live on? What will we live on when we live together</p>  
 <p><a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 69</font></a></p>  
 <p>And he, singing, answered, "We will live on hawthorn berries and roots."</p>  
 <p>She sang, I cannot live on hawthorn berries and roots. I am too good for such food; I'm a nice looking girl."</p>  
 <p>The young woman traveled on till dusk then, seeing signs of some one having been along a short time before, she seated herself on a log and sang, "I wonder if any man around here wants a wife. I wonder if any man around here wants a wife."</p>  
 <p>Close by some one sang, "I want a wife. I want a wife."</p>  
 <p>And she, singing, asked, "What will we live on? What will we live on when we live together?"</p>  
 <p>And he sang back, "When we live together we will live on seeds."</p>  
 <p>Singing, she answered, "That is the food I like; seeds are nice and soft."</p>  
 <p>The singer, hearing her answer, was pleased. He came and sat on a log by her side, and, singing, asked, "Did you understand my song when you asked what we would live on when we lived together?"</p>  
 <p>She, singing, answered, "Yes, seeds. I love seeds, they are sweet and soft."</p>  
 <p>Then the two flew off along the bank of the river, and ever since have lived happily together--The first birds of Spring.</p>  
 <p>The first man to answer the young woman's call was a deer--the second was a bear; the third was a bird like herself.</p>
