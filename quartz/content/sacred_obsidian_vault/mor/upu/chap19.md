 <h1 align="CENTER">THE SUBJECTS OF THE KINGDOM</h1>
 <p align="left">But what of the Mormon people? How can such leaders, directing 
 the Church to purposes that have become so cruel, so selfish, so dangerous and so 
 disloyal-how can they maintain their power over followers who are themselves neither 
 criminal nor degraded? That is a question which has given the pause of doubt to 
 many criticisms of the Mormon communism of our day. That is the consideration which 
 has obtained from the nation the protection of tolerance under which the Prophets 
 flourish. For not only are the Mormon men and women obviously as worthy as any in 
 the United States: there is plainly much of community value in their social life; 
 there is manifestly a great deal of efficiency for human good in their system and 
 in the leadership by which it is directed; and this good is so apparent that it 
 appeals easily to the sympathetic conscience and uninformed mind of the country 
 at large.</p>
 <p align="left">Let me try, then, to exhibit and to analyze the causes that keep 
 such a virtuous and sturdy people loyally supporting the leadership of men so unworthy 
 of them that if the people were as bad as the ends to which they are being now directed, 
 modern Mormonism would be destroyed by its own evils.</p>
 <p align="left">In the first place, the average Mormon chief is sincere in his 
 pretensions and self-justified in his aims. Usually, he has been born, in the Church, 
 to a family that sees itself set apart, in holiness, from the rest of humanity, 
 as the direct heirs of the ancient prophets or even as the lineal descendants of 
 Christ. From his earliest age of understanding, he is taught the divine splendor 
 of his birth and impressed with the high duties of his family privilege in being 
 permitted to bear a part in preparing the earth for the second coming of the Savior. 
 He is taught that, though all the world may be saved and nearly all the people of 
 this sphere will in some eternity work out a measure of salvation, he and 143,999 
 others are to be a band of the elect who shall stand about the Savior, on Mount 
 Zion, in the final day.</p>
 <p align="left">He is taught that, next to Christ, Joseph Smith, the founder 
 of the faith, has performed the largest mission for the salvation of the world; 
 that in the councils of the Gods, when the Creator measured off the ages of the 
 human race on this earth, to the Savior was apportioned "the meridian of time," 
 and to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, was given the "last dispensation," which is "the 
 fullness of times," in order that the world, having apostatized from the atonement 
 and the redemption, might be saved to heaven by Joseph, "the Choice Seer."</p>
 <p align="left">He is taught that the disciples of the Mormon Prophet are literally 
 the disciples of Jesus Christ; that the laws of right and wrong are within the direction 
 and subject to the authority of the Prophet, to be changed, enlarged or even revoked 
 by his commandment; that all human laws are equally subject to his will, to be made 
 or unmade at his order; that he can condemn, by his excommunication, any man or 
 any nation to the vengeance of the Almighty here and hereafter; and that he can 
 pronounce a blessing upon the head of any man, or the career of any people, by virtue 
 of which blessing power shall be held in this world righteously and the man elevated 
 to sit at the right hand of God in the world to come. He is taught that the greatest 
 sin which can be committed-next to the denial of Christ-is to raise hand or voice 
 against "the Lord's anointed," the Mormon prophets. And, for morality, he is taught 
 from his infancy, that he must scrupulously practise those special virtues of his 
 cult, industry, thrift, purity (except as in later life he shall be inducted into 
 the practice of the new polygamy) honesty in business, and charity toward his needy 
 fellow-men.</p>
 <p align="left">Formed in character by this teaching, as a steady inculcation 
 throughout his youth, he comes to manhood strong of body, determined of mind, practising 
 rigidly and intolerantly his petty virtues of abstinence from the use of tobacco, 
 tea and coffee, proclaiming with fanatical zeal the gospel as it has been proclaimed 
 to him, and self-justified in all that he says or does by the large measure of sincerity 
 in his delusions.</p>
 <p align="left">And that is, in some degree, the common training of all Mormons. 
 Every Mormon boy attends Sunday School as soon as he is old enough to lisp his song 
 of adoration to Joseph, the Kingly Prophet, and to the Savior with whom Joseph is 
 early associated in his childish mind. At six years of age, he enters the Primary 
 Association; at twelve he is in the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association; 
 at fourteen or even earlier, he stands in the fast-day meeting and repeats like 
 a creed: "Brethren and Sisters, I feel called upon to say a few words. I am not 
 able to edify you, but I can say that I know this is the Church and Kingdom of God, 
 and I bear my testimony that Joseph Smith was a Prophet and that Brigham Young was 
 his lawful successor, and that the Prophet Joseph F. Smith is heir to all the authority 
 which the Lord has conferred in these days for the salvation of men. And I feel 
 that if I live my religion and do nothing to offend the Holy Spirit I will be saved 
 in the presence of my Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. With these few words I will 
 give way. Praying the Lord to bless each and every one of us is my prayer in the 
 name of Jesus Christ. Amen."</p>
 <p align="left">At fourteen he becomes a Deacon of the Church. Between that age 
 and twenty, he becomes an Elder. Very soon thereafter he becomes "a Seventy" and 
 perhaps a high priest. He takes upon himself "covenants in holy places." He becomes 
 "a priest unto the Most High God"-frequently before his eighteenth year. Usually 
 before he is twenty he is sent on a mission to proclaim his gospel-the only one 
 he has ever heard in his life-to "an unenlightened nation" and "a wicked world." 
 For, in addition to being taught that the Mormons are the best, most virtuous, most 
 temperate, most industrious, and most God-fearing of all peoples-a thing that is 
 dinned into his ears from the pulpit every Sunday in the year-he has been convinced 
 by equal iteration that the rest of the world is a festering mass of corruption.</p>
 <p align="left">Often he goes abroad, to some country whose language and customs 
 he must learn and upon the charity of whose toilers he must depend for his maintenance. 
 He goes with an implicit reliance upon God, strong in the small virtues that have 
 been taught him from the time he knelt at his mother's knee. He sees, probably for 
 the first time, the afflictions and the sins among mankind; and he keeps himself 
 unspotted from them, congratulating himself that these grossnesses are unknown to 
 his sheltered home-life and to the religion which he holds as the ideal of his soul. 
 He proclaims his belief that God has spoken from the Heavens, through the Mormon 
 Prophet, in this last day, to restore the gospel of Christ from which the peoples 
 of the earth have wandered. He "bears testimony" to the whole world, and he binds 
 himself to the authority of his Church by proclaiming his belief in it.</p>
 <p align="left">When he returns home, after years of service, he is called to 
 the stand in the tabernacle to give a report of his work. He finds waiting for him 
 a ready advancement in the offices of the Church, according as he may show himself 
 worthy of advancement or as the power of family or the favor of ecclesiastical authority 
 may obtain it for him. He marries a girl who has had a training almost identical 
 with his own. She, too, has borne her testimony before she reached years of responsibility. 
 She has taken her vows as a priestess at the age when he was dedicating himself 
 a priest. She may even have performed a foreign mission. They have both been promised 
 that they shall become kings and queens in the eternal world. They are bound by 
 their covenants to obey their superior priests. They cannot disregard their Church 
 affiliations without recanting their vows. The only way they can adhere to their 
 covenants with their Almighty Father-the only way they can demonstrate their acceptance 
 of the atoning power of the Redeemer's sacrifice-is by yielding such obedience to 
 the Prophet as they would pay to the Father and the Son if They were on earth in 
 Their proper persons. To deviate from this faithfulness is to be marked as a Judas 
 Iscariot by all the Latter-Day Saints.</p>
 <p align="left">As soon as the Mormon becomes the head of a family-in addition 
 to all the testimonies and performances which he must give as proof of his continued 
 adherence-he must submit himself and his household to the examination and espionage 
 of the ward teachers, who invade his home at least once a month. They enter absolutely 
 as the proprietors of the house. If the husband is there, they ask him whether he 
 performs his duties in the Church; whether he holds family prayer morning and evening; 
 whether he "keeps the word of wisdom"-that is, does he abstain from the use of alcohol, 
 tobacco, tea and coffee-whether he pays a full tithe and all the prescribed donations 
 to the Church; whether he has any hard feelings against any of his brethren and 
 sisters; and finally, does he devoutly sustain the Prophet as the ruler of God's 
 Kingdom upon earth. These questions, so far as they apply, are put to each member 
 of the family above the age of eight years. Should the husband be away, all the 
 inquiries concerning him are made of the wife. If both parents are absent, the questions 
 concerning them are put to their children!</p>
 <p align="left">This one branch of the ecclesiastical service is sufficient of 
 itself to mark the Mormon Church as the most perfectly disciplined institution among 
 mankind. The teachers' quorum in any neighborhood consists of some tried elders, 
 usually of considerable ability and experience. With these are associated numerous 
 young men, many of them returned missionaries. The fact that they have countless 
 other duties in the Church and many other and weightier responsibilities, is not 
 permitted to excuse them from performing strictly this important labor. Perhaps 
 a dozen or twenty families are assigned to a couple of teachers. They are required 
 to visit each of these families once every month. And if they discover any lapse 
 of fidelity, they report at once to the Bishop.</p>
 <p align="left">No one who has not seen them on their rounds will believe with 
 what an air of divinely privileged authority they enter a home and force its secrets 
 of conscience-with what an imposing and arrogant zeal-with what a calm assumption 
 of spiritual overlordship and inquisitorial right. Some few years ago after my public 
 criticisms of Joseph F. Smith had been followed by my excommunication, two teachers, 
 on their monthly rounds, came to my home in the evening and made their way calmly 
 to the library where I was sitting with some members of my family. I had just returned 
 from a long absence abroad, and the visit was an untimely intrusion at its best; 
 but we observed the obligations of hospitality with what courtesy we could, and 
 merely evaded the familiar questions which they began to put to us. Finally, the 
 elder of the two teachers, a man of some local prominence in the Church, undertook 
 to "bear testimony" to the wickedness of anyone who opposed the divine rule of Joseph 
 F. Smith; and when I cut him short with a request that he leave the house, he was 
 as shocked and surprised as if he had been Milton's Archangel Michael, after "the 
 fall," and I, a defiant Adam, showing him the door.</p>
 <p align="left">In addition to the visitations of the ward teachers, some members 
 of the Ladies Relief Society call upon every family usually once a month, not only 
 to gather donations for the poor, but to have a little quiet talk with the wife 
 and mother of the household. These women of the Relief Society are genuine "Sisters 
 of Charity." In most cases they have themselves plenty of household cares, yet they 
 give much of their time to visiting the sick, supplying the wants of the needy or 
 ministering to the miseries of the afflicted; and if it were not for them and their 
 noble work, the Mormon poor would fare ill in these days of Mormon Church grandeur. 
 Outside of their monthly visitations, they have definite preaching to do. At the 
 meetings of their organization, they "bear testimony" that Joseph was a Prophet-and 
 so on. They have the quarterly stake conferences to attend. Their travelling missionaries 
 go from Salt Lake to the four quarters of the globe to institute and maintain the 
 discipline of the organization and to teach the methods of its practical work in 
 Nursing Schools, mother's classes and the like. They make up one of the noblest 
 bodies of women associated with any social movement of humanity. And in their zeal 
 and submissiveness they are so innocently meek and "biddable" that they can listen 
 with reverence to young Hyrum Smith publicly lecturing the grandmothers of the order 
 for occasionally partaking of a cup of thin tea.</p>
 <p align="left">Under such a system of teaching, discipline and espionage, how 
 can the average Mormon man or woman develop any independence of thought or action? 
 At what time of life can he assert himself ? Before he has attained the age of reason 
 he has declared his faith in public. If he shall then, in his teens, express any 
 doubt, the priests are ready for him. "You have borne your testimony many times 
 in the Church," they say sternly. "Were you lying then, or have you lost the Spirit 
 of God through your transgressions?" If he reveals any doubt to the ward teachers, 
 they will overwhelm him with argument, and either absolutely reconvert him or silence 
 him with authority. The pressure of family love and pride will be brought to bear 
 upon him. The ecclesiastical authorities will move against him. He knows that every 
 one of his relatives will be humiliated by his unfaithfulness. His "sin" will become 
 known to the whole community, and he will be looked at askance by his friends and 
 his companions.</p>
 <p align="left">After he has taken his vows as a priest, how shall he dare to 
 violate them ? He knows that if he loses his faith on a mission-in other words, 
 if he dares to make any inquiry into the authenticity of the mission which he is 
 performing-he becomes a deserter from God in the very ranks of battle. He knows 
 that he will be held forever in dishonor among his people; that he will be looked 
 upon as one worse than dead; that he will ruin his own life and despoil his parents 
 of all their eternal comfort and their hope in him.</p>
 <p align="left">While I was editing the <i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i> a son of one 
 of the famous apostles came to me with some anxious inquiries, and said: "Frank, 
 I have been working in the Church and teaching this gospel so assiduously for nearly 
 forty years that I have never had time to find out whether it's true or not!"</p>
 <p align="left">If the Mormon, in his later years of manhood, dares to doubt, 
 he must either reveal his disloyalty to the ward teachers or continue to deny it, 
 from month to month, and remain a supine servant of authority. If he reveals it, 
 he knows that the news of his defection will permeate the entire circle with which 
 he is associated in politics, in business and in religion. If his superstition does 
 not hold him, his worldly prudence will. He knows that all the aid of the community 
 will be withdrawn from him; every voice that has expressed affection for him will 
 speak in hate; every hand that has clasped his in friendship will be turned against 
 him. And into this very prudence there enters something of a moral warning. For 
 he has seen how many a man, deprived of the association and fraternity of the Church, 
 feeling himself shunned in a lonely ostracism, has not been strong enough to endure 
 in rectitude and has fallen into dissipation. Every instance of the sort is rehearsed 
 by the faithful, with many exultant expressions of mourning, in the hearing of the 
 doubter. And finally, it is the prediction of the priests that no apostate can prosper; 
 and though the Mormon people are charitable and do not intend to be unjust, they 
 inevitably tend to fulfil the prophecy and devote the apostate to material destruction.</p>
 <p align="left">The great doctrine of the Mormon faith is obedience; the one 
 proof of grace is conformity. So long as a man pays a full tithe, contributes all 
 the required donations, and yields unquestioningly to the orders of the priests, 
 he may even depart in a moral sense from any other of the Church's laws and find 
 himself excused. But any questioning of the rulership of the Prophets-the rightfulness 
 of their authority or the justice of its exercise-is apostasy, is a denial of the 
 faith, is a sin against the Holy Ghost. The man who obeys in all things is promised 
 that he shall come forth in the morning of the first resurrection; the man who disobeys, 
 and by his disobedience apostatizes, is condemned to work out, through an eternity 
 of suffering, his offence against the Holy Spirit. At the first sign of defection-almost 
 inevitably discovered in its incipiency-the rebel is either disciplined into submission 
 or at once pushed over "the battlements of Heaven!"</p>
 <p align="left">By such perfect means, the leaders, chosen under a pretense of 
 revelation from God, maintain an unassailable sanctity in the eyes of the people, 
 who are themselves priests. These people implicitly believe that the voice of the 
 leader is the voice of God. They follow with a passionate devotion that is made 
 up of a fanatical priestly faith and of a sympathy that sees their Prophets "persecuted" 
 by an ungenerous, impure and vindictive world. We love that for which we suffer; 
 and it has become the inheritance of the Mormons to love the priesthood, for whose 
 protection their parents and grandparents suffered, and under whose oppressions 
 they now suffer themselves. Joseph Smith, the original Prophet, was slain in the 
 Carthage jail; to the Mormon mind this is proof that he was the anointed of God 
 and that he sealed his testimony with his blood, as did the Savior. John Taylor, 
 afterwards President of the Church, was not slain at Carthage, but only wounded; 
 and this to the Mormons is proof that he was of the eternal kindred of the Prophets, 
 because, under God's direction, he gave his blood to their defence. But Willard 
 Richards, a companion of Smith and Taylor, was not even injured at Carthage; and 
 this is accepted as proof that God had charge of his holy ones, and would not permit 
 wicked men to do them harm. When the people left Nauvoo and journeyed through Iowa, 
 some of the citizens of that state would not harbor them; and this is argued as 
 evidence that the Mormon movement was God's work, since the hand of the wicked was 
 against it; but in some localities of Iowa the emigrants were aided, and this also 
 is proof that the Mormon movement was God's work, since the hearts of the people 
 were melted to assist it. When Johnston's army was sent to Utah, it was proof that 
 the Mormon Church was the true Church, hated and persecuted by a wicked nation; 
 when Johnston's army withdrew without a battle, it was a new guarantee of the divinity 
 of the work; and it is even believed among the Mormons that the Civil War was ordained 
 from the heavens, at the sudden command of God, to compel Johnston's withdrawal 
 and save God's people.</p>
 <p align="left">In the same way the persecutions of "the raid," and the cessation 
 of those persecutions-the early trials of poverty and the present abundance of prosperity-the 
 threat of the Smoot investigation and the abortive conclusion of that exposure-are 
 all argued as proofs of the divinity of a persecuted Church or given as instances 
 of the miraculous "overruling" of God to prosper his chosen people. No matter what 
 occurs, the Prophets, by applying either one of these formulae, can translate the 
 incident into a new proof of grace; and their followers submissively accept the 
 interpretation.</p>
 <p align="left">On the night of April 18, 1905, Joseph F. Smith and some eight 
 of his sons sat in his official box at the Lalt Lake theatre to watch a prize fight 
 that lasted for twenty gory rounds. <i>The Salt Lake Tribune</i> published the fact 
 that the Prophet of God, and vicegerent of Christ, had given the approval of his 
 "holy presence" to this clumsy barbarity. A devout old lady, who had been with the 
 Church since the days of Nauvoo, rebuked us bitterly for publishing such a falsehood 
 about President Smith. "How dare you tell such wicked lies about God's servants?" 
 she scolded. "President Smith wouldn't do such a wicked thing as attend a prize 
 fight. And you know that no man with any sense of decency would take his young sons 
 to look at such a dreadful thing!" Some time later, when the facts in the case had 
 come to her, in her retirement, from her friends, the editor called upon her to 
 quiz her about the incident. She said: "I'm sure I don't see what business it is 
 of the outside world anyhow what President Smith does. He has a right to go to the 
 theatre if he wants to. I don't believe they would have anything but what's good 
 in the Salt Lake theatre. It was built by our people and they own it. And if it 
 wasn't good, President Smith wouldn't have taken his boys there."</p>
 <p align="left">And this was not merely the absurdity of an old woman. It is 
 the logic of all the faithful. The leaders cannot do wrong-because it is not wrong, 
 if they do it. No criticism of them can be effective. No act of theirs can be proven 
 an error. If they do not do a thing, it was right not to do it; and it would have 
 been a sin if it <i>had</i> been done. But if they do that thing, then it was right 
 to do it; and it would have been a sin if it had <i>not</i> been done.</p>
 <p align="left">This reliance upon the almighty power and prophetic infallibility 
 of the leaders prevents the Mormon people from truly appreciating the dangers that 
 threaten them. It keeps them ignorant of outside sentiment. It makes them despise 
 even a national hostility. And it has left them without gratitude, too, for a national 
 grace. Before these people can be roused to any independence of responsible thought, 
 it will be necessary to break their trust in the ability of their leaders to make 
 bargains of protection with the world; and then it will still be necessary to force 
 the eyes of their self-complacency to turn from the satisfied contemplation of their 
 own virtues. "You will never be able to reach the conscience of the Mormons," a 
 man who knows them has declared. "I have had my experiences with both leaders and 
 people. If you tell them 'You're ninety-nine-and-one-half per cent, pure gold,' 
 they will ask, surprised and indignant: 'What? Why, what's the matter with the other 
 half per cent. ?'"</p>
