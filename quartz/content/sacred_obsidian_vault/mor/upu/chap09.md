 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER IX</h1>
 <h1 align="CENTER">AT THE CROSSWAYS</h1>
 <p align="left">In 1897, the Church, freed of proscription, with its people enjoying 
 the sovereignty of their state rights, had-as I have already said-only one further 
 enfranchisement to desire: and that was its freedom from debt. The informal "finance 
 committee" of which I was a member, had succeeded in concentrating the bulk of the 
 indebtedness in the East, on short term loans, and had brought a certain order out 
 of the confusion of the older methods of administration. But, in 1897, my father 
 proposed a comprehensive plan of Church finance that included the issuance of Church 
 bonds and the formation of responsible committees to regulate and manage the business 
 affairs of the Church, so that the bonds might be made a normal investment for Eastern 
 capital by having a normal business method of administration to back them. The idea 
 was tentatively approved by the Presidency, and I was asked to draw up the plan 
 in detail.</p>
 <p align="left">To this end there were placed in my hands sheets showing the 
 assets, liabilities, revenues and disbursements of the Church. They gave a total 
 cash indebtedness of $1,200,000, approximately. The revenues from tithes for the 
 year 1897 were estimated at a trifle more than a million dollars-the total being 
 low because of the financial depression from which the country was just recovering. 
 The available property holdings-exclusive of premises used for religious worship, 
 for educational and benevolent work, and such kindred purposes-were valued at several 
 millions (from four to six), although there was no definite appraisal or means of 
 obtaining appraisal, since the values would largely attach only when the properties 
 were brought into business use. I was advised that the incomes of the Church would 
 probably increase at the rate of ten per cent per annum, but I do not know by what 
 calculations this ratio was reached.</p>
 <p align="left">The disbursements were chiefly for interest on debt, for the 
 maintenance of the temples and tabernacles, for educational and charitable work, 
 for missionary headquarters in other countries, and for the return of released missionaries. 
 The missionaries themselves received no compensation; they were supposed to travel 
 "without purse or scrip;" their expenses were defrayed by their relatives, and they 
 had to pay out of their own pockets for the printed tracts which they distributed. 
 Neither the President nor any of the general authorities received salaries. There 
 was an order that each apostle should be paid $2,000 a year, but this rule had been 
 suspended, except, perhaps, in the cases of men who had to give their whole time 
 to religious work and who had no independent incomes. Some occasional appropriations 
 had been made for meeting houses in communities that had been unable to erect their 
 own chapels of worship, but for the most part there were few calls made upon the 
 Church revenues to support its religious activities, its priests or its propaganda.</p>
 <p align="left">Our proposed committees, therefore, were a committee on missionary 
 work, one on publication, one on colonization, one on political protective work 
 for the Mormons in foreign countries, and-most important-a finance committee selected 
 from the body of apostles, with the addition of some able men connected with financial 
 institutions. As a basis for the work of the finance committee, we proposed the 
 establishment of an interest fund, a sinking fund, and a scale of percentage disbursements 
 for the various community purposes. These committees were to be appointed by the 
 Conferences of the people, and the committee reports were to be public.</p>
 <p align="left">President Woodruff eagerly accepted the plan as relieving the 
 Presidency of administrative cares that were becoming too great for the quorum to 
 carry. Joseph F. Smith did not at once awake to the real meaning of the proposal; 
 but when the scheme was submitted in its matured details, he spoke of the danger 
 of allowing power to pass from the hands of the "trustee in trust" in business matters. 
 His idea was sufficiently clear in its resistance to any diffusion of authority, 
 but it was correspondingly void of any suggestion of substitute. For the time being 
 he was pacified by the assurance that the "Kingdom of God" and the rule of its prophets 
 would not be endangered by the organization of committees and the submission of 
 financial plans to the general knowledge, and even to the consent, of the people.</p>
 <p align="left">It was, of course, evident to the First Councillor that this 
 scheme of Church administration would give the Mormon people a measure of responsible 
 government, and the proposal was a part of his wisdom as a community leader seeking 
 the common welfare. While we had been a people on whom the whole world seemed to 
 be making war, a dictatorship had been necessary; but now that we had arrived at 
 peace and liberty, a concentration of irresponsible power would surely become dangerous 
 to progress. Without, therefore, impairing the religious authority of the Prophet, 
 the First Councillor was willing to divide the temporal power of the Church among 
 its members.</p>
 <p align="left">He was as silent, about these aims, with me as with all others; 
 but I had learned to understand him in his silences; and, in joining with him in 
 his work of reform, I was as sure of his purpose as I have since been sure of the 
 disaster to the Mormon people that has come of the failure to effect the reform.</p>
 <p align="left">When the Presidency had approved of the flotation of bonds, I 
 went with my father to New York to aid him in interesting Eastern capitalists in 
 the investment. We interviewed Judge John F. Dillon and Mr. Winslow Pierce, of the 
 law firm of Dillon and Pierce, attorneys for some of the Union Pacific interests; 
 and through them we met Mr. Edward H. Harriman, Mr. George J. Gould and members 
 of the firm of Kuhn Loeb and Company. It was interesting to watch the encounters 
 between the Mormon prophet and some of these astutest of the nation's financiers; 
 for it was as if one of the ancient patriarchs had stepped down from the days of 
 early Israel to discuss the financial problems of his people with a modern "captain 
 of industry." He described a condition of society that was, to Wall Street, archaic. 
 He spoke with a serene assurance that the order of affairs in Utah was constituted 
 in the wisdom of the word of God. He was listened to, with the interest of curiosity, 
 as the chief living exponent of the Mormon movement, its processes and its aims; 
 and I was impressed by the fact that these men of the world had a large and splendid 
 sympathy for any wholesome social effort designed to abolish poverty and establish 
 a quicker justice in the practical affairs of the race.</p>
 <p align="left">It was of the abolition of poverty and the justice of the social 
 order among the Mormons, that the First Councillor chiefly spoke. "Your clients," 
 he said to Judge Dillon, "make their investments frequently in railroad stocks and 
 bonds. What are the underlying bases of the values of railroad securities? Largely 
 the industry and stability of the communities through which the railroad lines shall 
 operate. Then, in reality, the security is valuable in proportion to the value of 
 the community in its steadfastness, its prosperity and the safety of its productive 
 labor. In your railroad investments you are obliged to take such considerations 
 as a secondary security. In negotiating this Church loan with your clients, you 
 can offer the same great values as a primary security. Probably no where else in 
 the world is there a people at once so industrious and so stable as ours."</p>
 <p align="left">It was the boast of the Mormons that there had not been an almshouse 
 or an almstaker in any of their settlements, up to the time of the escheat proceedings 
 by the Federal officials; and this was literally true. Every man had been helped 
 to the employment for which he was best fitted. If an immigrant, in his former estate, 
 had been a silk-weaver, efforts were made to establish his industry and give it 
 public support. If he had been a musician of talent, a little conservatory was founded, 
 and patronage obtained for him. When the growth of population made it necessary 
 to open new valleys for agriculture, the Church, out of its community fund, rendered 
 the initial aid; in many instances the original irrigation enterprises of small 
 settlements were thus financed; and the investments were repaid not only directly, 
 by the return of the loan, but indirectly, many times over, by the increased productiveness 
 and larger contributions of the people. Co-operation, in mercantile, industrial 
 and stock-raising undertakings, assured the support and patronage of each community 
 for its own particular enterprise, prevented destructive competition and checked 
 the greed of the individual-for the more he toiled for himself, the larger the share 
 of the general burden he had to carry. It was the First Councillor's theory that 
 when people contributed to a common fund they became interested in one another's 
 material welfare. The man who paid less in tithes this year than last was counselled 
 with as to why his business had been unsuccessful, and the wise men of his little 
 circle aided him with advice and material help. The man who contributed largely 
 was glad of a prosperity from which he yielded a part-in recognition of what the 
 community had done for him and in a reverent gratitude to God for making him "a 
 steward of mighty possessions"-but he was anxious that his neighbor also should 
 be a larger contributor each year.</p>
 <p align="left">The whole system of tithe-paying was built upon a series of purported 
 "revelations" received by Joseph Smith, the original Prophet. It was declared to 
 be the will of God that all men, as stewards of their possessions, should give of 
 their increase annually into "the storehouse of the Lord," which should always be 
 open for the relief of the poor. Inasmuch as the man who received help-or whose 
 widow and children did so-had been a tithe-payer during all his productive years, 
 there was none of the feeling of personal humiliation on the part of the recipient, 
 nor any of the feeling of condescending charity on the part of the giver, in the 
 distribution of funds to the needy. And it was astonishing how few the needy were-because 
 of the abstemious lives, the industry, and the thrift of the workers. The Church 
 tribunals heard and settled all disputes over property or personal rights not involving 
 the criminal law. Expensive litigation was thus avoided. Society was saved the cost 
 of innumerable courts. There were many counties in which no lawyer could be found; 
 and everywhere, among the Mormons, it was considered an act of evil fellowship, 
 amounting almost to apostasy, for a man to bring suit against his brother in the 
 civil tribunals.</p>
 <p align="left">In short-as my father pointed out-Utah, at that time, expressed 
 the only full-bodied social proposition in the United States. There never had been 
 in America another community whose future, in the economic aspects, offered so clear 
 a solution of problems which still remain generally unsettled. It was as if a segment 
 of the great circle of modern humanity had been transported to another world, otherwise 
 unpopulated, and there-with the experience gained through centuries of human travail-had 
 attempted the establishment of a just, beneficent and satisfying social order.</p>
 <p align="left">I am here repeating this argument-this exposition-because the 
 financial absolutism of the Prophets of the Church has since ruined the whole Mormon 
 experiment in communism, put the Mormon paupers into the public poor houses, used 
 the tithes to support the large financial ventures of the Prophet's favorites, and 
 turned the Church's "community enterprises" into monopolistic exploitations of the 
 Mormon people. And this change began even while our negotiations were pending in 
 New York-for they were prolonged, for various reasons, into the summer of 1898, 
 and they were interrupted finally by the death of President Woodruff.</p>
 <p align="left">As soon as I received word of his illness I took train for Utah. 
 The news of his death met me on the journey home. Since I derived my authority solely 
 from him, upon my arrival in Salt Lake I went to the Cashier of the Church, gave 
 him the keys and the password to the safety deposit box in New York, and withdrew 
 from any further participation in the Church's financial affairs. When I came to 
 the office of the Presidency I found that my father had removed his desk; and this 
 was an indication to me of what was happening in the inner circles of Church intrigue.</p>
 <p align="left">The president of the quorum of apostles invariably succeeds to 
 the Presidency of the Church, although it is left to the apostles to decide, and 
 their choice is supposed to be directed by inspiration. His election is subsequently 
 ratified by the General Conference; but this ratification is a mere form, because 
 the conference must either accept the choice of the apostles or rebel against "the 
 revelation of God."</p>
 <p align="left">Apostle Lorenzo Snow was president of the quorum of apostles, 
 and therefore in line for the Presidency. But usually, after the death of a President, 
 a considerable period was allowed to elapse before the selection of his successor, 
 with the government resting in the quorum of apostles meanwhile, even for a term 
 of years. As soon as I arrived in Salt Lake, Apostle Snow asked me to a private 
 interview (in the same small back room of the President's offices), inquired about 
 the financial negotiations that I had been conducting, and asked me whether it was 
 not essential to the success of our business affairs that as soon as possible the 
 Church should elect a President, empowered as "trustee in trust." I replied that 
 it was. He invited me to attend a conference of the apostles and give my views upon 
 the situation to them.</p>
 <p align="left">This seemed to me an act of rather shallow cunning, for I knew 
 I was too unimportant a person to be so consulted unless he thought my report would 
 aid his intrigue. Such intriguing was offensive to the religious traditions of the 
 Church; and it outraged my feeling for President Woodruff, who was hardly cold in 
 death before this personal and worldly ambition caught at the reins of his office. 
 Snow had been a man of small weight in the government of the Church. He had known 
 none of the responsibilities of great leadership. He was eighty-four years old.</p>
 <p align="left">However, it was impossible for us to maintain the Church's credit 
 in the East unless our community were represented by some choate authority, since 
 our credit rested on the belief that the Mormon people were ready to consecrate 
 all their possessions at any time to the service of the Church at the command of 
 the President. I advised the apostles of this fact. Snow was elected President on 
 September 13, 1898, eleven days after Woodruff's death. He followed the usual precedent 
 in choosing my father and Joseph F. Smith as his Councillors. But he took possession 
 of his new authority with the manner of an heir entering upon the ownership of a 
 personal estate for which he had long waited-and which he proposed to enjoy to the 
 full for his remaining years. In a most literal sense he held that all the property 
 of the people of the Church was subject to his direction, as chief earthly steward 
 of "the Divine Monarch," and he proceeded to exercise his assumed prerogatives with 
 an autocracy that made even Joseph F. Smith complain because the Councillors were 
 never asked for counsel. As resident apostle of Box Elder County and president of 
 the Box Elder "stake of Zion," Snow had already shown his ambition as a financier, 
 disastrously; and it was as the financial head of the Church that he was chiefly 
 to rule during his term of absolutism.</p>
 <p align="left">Of all the Church leaders whom I had known he was the only man 
 who showed none of the robustness of the Western experience. Tall, stately, white-bearded, 
 elegant and courtly, he prided himself most obviously on his manners and his culture. 
 He rarely spoke in any but the most subdued and silken tones of suavity. He walked 
 with a step that was almost affected in its gentility. If he had any passions, he 
 held them in such smooth concealment that the public credited him with neither force 
 nor unkindness. He had been a great traveller (as a missionary); he had written 
 his autobiography, somewhat egotistically; he was devoted to the forms of his religion, 
 like a mediaeval Prince of the Church and an elegante. But under all the artificialities 
 of personal vanity and exterior grace, he proved to have a cold determination that 
 seemed more selfishly ambitious than religiously zealous.</p>
 <p align="left">At once, upon his accession to power, he notified us that he 
 did not intend to carry out any such plan as we had suggested for the administration 
 of the Church's finances. It meant a diffusion of authority; and he held that the 
 best results had been obtained by keeping all power in the hands of the Prophet, 
 Seer and Revelator, and of those whom he might appoint to work with him. Joseph 
 F. Smith, at a meeting of the Presidency, was even more positive. No good, he said, 
 could come of publishing the affairs of the community to the people of it; those 
 affairs were purely the concern of the Prophets; the Lord revealed His will to the 
 Prophets and they were responsible only to Him.</p>
 <p align="left">My father necessarily bowed to the President's decision. "It 
 is within the authority of the Prophet of the Lord," he counselled me, "to determine 
 how he will conduct the business of the Church. President Snow has his own ideas."</p>
 <p align="left">By that decision, as I see it now, an autocracy of financial 
 power was confirmed to the President of the Mormon Church at a time when a renewal 
 of prosperity among its people was about to make such power fatal to their liberties. 
 It was confirmed to a man who proved himself eager for it, ambitious to increase 
 it and secretly unscrupulous in his use of it. He proceeded at once to preach the 
 doctrine of contribution with unexampled zeal, but he administered the "common fund," 
 so collected, with none of the old feeling of responsibility to the people who contributed 
 it. He became the first of the new financial pontiffs of the Church who have used 
 the "money power" as an aid to hierarchical domination.</p>
 <p align="left">Moreover, in his desire to 511 the coffers of the Church, he 
 engaged in "practical politics" and made a profit out of Church influence, both 
 in business enterprises and in political campaigns. He proved himself peculiarly 
 qualified by nature to construct and direct a secret political machine-a machine 
 whose operations were never to be observable except to the close student of Utah's 
 ecclesiasticism-a machine that was to be all the more effective because of its silent 
 certainty. As the succeeding chapters of this narrative will show, although he affected 
 a fine superiority to unclean political work and always publicly professed that 
 the Church of Christ was holding itself aloof from the strife of partisanship, there 
 was no political event on which he did not fix the calculating eye of his ambitious 
 clericalism and no candidacy that he did not reach with those slender but powerful 
 fingers that controlled the destiny of a state and trifled with the honor of a people.</p>
 <p align="left">His accession marked the change from the old to the new regime 
 in Utah. Leadership was no longer a dangerous honor. Proscription no longer made 
 the authorities of the Church strong by persecution-hardy chiefs of a poverty-stricken 
 people-leaders as sensible of the obligations of power as their followers were faithful 
 in their allegiance of duty. Political freedom and worldly prosperity made the office 
 of President a luxurious sovereignty, easily tyrannical, fortified in its religious 
 absolutism by its irresponsible power of finance, and protected in its social abuses, 
 from the interference of the nation, by an alliance with the commercial rulers of 
 the nation and by a duplicity that worldliness has learned to dignify with the respectability 
 of material success.</p>
