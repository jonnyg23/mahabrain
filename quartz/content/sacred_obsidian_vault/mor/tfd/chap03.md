 <h1 align="center">CHAPTER III</h1>
 <h1 align="center">PILGRIMS TO A MODERN ZION</h1>
 <p align="center"><i>"Far from the worldly crowds and strife, To a visioned city, 
 they toiled their weary way, Seeking amid towering hills the sequestered life Of 
 a peculiar people, a holy nation of the latter day."</i></p>
 <p align="right"><i>Bird</i></p>
 <p>JERUSALEM of old, the city of song, sacrifices and tears, the city to which the 
 Hebrew captives looked from their land of exile on the banks of the Euphrates, had 
 its modern repetition in this Zion of the Latter Day Saints settled and nestled 
 in the tops of these Rocky Mountains. The topography of the country is singularly 
 like that of the Holy Land of history, with the difference that north is changed 
 to south in its water system.<br>
 <br>
 It has its Dead Sea-the Great Salt Lake- at the north end of this valley and its 
 divide, connecting by a river-the Jordan-flowing out of it and receiving canyon 
 streams on its way south, with the Sea of Galilee-Utah Lake-a fresh water sheet 
 supplied from the springs in the Wa-satch Mountains. Of course there is no Tyre 
 and Zidon, no Joppa and Mount Carmel overlooking the Sea, since this is an inland 
 country far from the ocean. But here are fertile plains and warm valleys, watered 
 by bubbling brooks; here is a land, under the touch of man's hand, that flows with 
 milk and honey.<br>
 <br>
 No wonder then, that these religious enthusiasts marshalled into a religious host 
 by Joseph Smith, with captains like Brigham Young and Herber C. Kimball; such exhorters 
 and teachers as Orson Pratt and Lorenzo Snow, full to the extent of human capacity 
 with "zeal not according to knowledge," should see in this region, secure by distance 
 and the hills from persecutors, the Promised Land.<br>
 <br>
 It did not take very much imagination, so often found joined to enthusiasm, on the 
 part of these saints of the Latter Day to see in themselves a modern Israel coming 
 forth out of a modern Egypt-such as the slave-making states of Tennessee, Kentucky 
 and Missouri-and, under a new Urim and Thummim vested in their priests and leaders, 
 to make the desert pilgrimage into the land of promise and peace.<br>
 <br>
 Only a little warm exhortation, and it was never wanting, was needed to strengthen 
 this fancy into fact.<br>
 <br>
 Originating in New York State, in Wayne County, the site of the memorable hill Cumorah, 
 where Joseph Smith received his revelation by vision and found the historic plates 
 of a past prophet-Mormon-and a defunct people-the Lamanites-this new faith and its 
 following passed with the migratory spirit of the '40's to Nauvoo, Illinois, in 
 the black prairie belt. Soon their peculiar faith made them obnoxious to their neighbors 
 of narrow vision and bigoted belief, so out of their scarcely warmed nest they had 
 to go yet farther west beyond the great river, the Mississippi. They put down their 
 stakes a third time in Missouri, a state just then settling with a mixed population 
 from both the South and the North.<br>
 <br>
 Since these Mormons-for such they were now called by the general community-were 
 "Come-Outers" and were separate from their neighbors, they became first unpopular, 
 then obnoxious to those who differed from them. It must be remembered that the '40's 
 were the years of religious divisions and debates. People loved to argue about shibboleths 
 of religion, even to fighting out their differences.<br>
 <br>
 This fighting was of course generally verbal and ended in another new bisection 
 of religion- some sect of a sect cut off from the parent body. The itinerant preachers 
 who did much good in their rough way with a rough people amid rude surroundings, 
 loved to verbally fight exponents of other shades of opinion.<br>
 <br>
 They found fine stuff for a fight in these "pestilent Mormons." More especially 
 as this peculiar practice of polygamy set these new religionists on the hill of 
 observation and criticism. Here was a fine chance to show up the enemy of orthodoxy, 
 and all the sons of Boanerges-sons of thunder in the pulpit-fulminated at the Latter 
 Day Saints.<br>
 <br>
 Soon this sort of preaching bore its expected fruit. Animosity and hatred were developed 
 and this give and take often ended in blows at these debates and denunciations.<br>
 <br>
 We are not excusing the Mormon leaders or people. They were set in their ways and 
 posed as martyrs of faith. Their undeniable zeal and sincerity won many a female 
 convert from the homes of other faiths, and when such women became embosomed in 
 the Mormon church and the polygamous consorts of some preacher, elder or bishop 
 of this new faith, then the rancor reached its climax in riot.<br>
 <br>
 I do not go into the details of history on this Subject. Books <i>ad nauseam </i>
 have been written on the subject pro and con. The Mormon side has been voluminously 
 voiced by good recorders and recounters, while the other side has met it with equal 
 heat and greater volume.<br>
 <br>
 Truth is not entirely on either side and both sides made a sorry exhibition of the 
 so-called religion of peace and purity. We know the arrest of the two Smiths-Joseph 
 and Hyrum-ended in the jail being besieged by an angry host of Missourians, who 
 shot down the two brothers on the jail steps and thus ended their leadership of 
 this new-born faith.<br>
 <br>
 Justice could not be had in such a day and place. Men and women were too intense 
 and narrow of temper to give place to anything but prejudice. Out again the Mormons 
 had to come from their settlements and homes, and then followed what the Dutch would 
 call the "Great Trek."<br>
 <br>
 Brigham Young, a man of powerful frame and forceful mind, stepped into the shoes 
 vacated by the dead Seer. With lieutenants of this same shrewd Yankee stock, for 
 he was a Vermonter and they were mostly from down East states, he organized these 
 people into a marching brigade to cross the great American Desert to the Rocky Mountains, 
 there to find a home for them all in a new promised land.<br>
 <br>
 In 1848, the first band set out, with ox wagons and a few horses, to make the long 
 journey that we now swiftly cover in forty-eight hours in a pullman. Innumerable 
 creeks and sloughs to cross, after passing the great Missouri, never ending plains, 
 like those of Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming, constituted the highway of this host. 
 The Indian, wild and in war paint, was abroad, for he had been greatly nettled and 
 annoyed by the frontier hunter and trapper of those rough days, trespassing on his 
 happy hunting grounds. The bison roamed in vast herds, and the prairie fires swept 
 to the horizon through the long grass of these wild fields of pasture.<br>
 <br>
 But these men and women, of faith, girded up their loins and strapped on their guns, 
 their all housed in the prairie schooner wagons under the hoops and canvas covers; 
 with a "haw" and "gee," they started out with the spirit of adventure in their eyes 
 and the zeal of their religion in their hearts. Oh! the wild ride that they made 
 through these unknown wastes of land. They fought the Indians at the fords, the 
 savage beasts at night, the fires in the fall when the herbage was dry as tinder; 
 they suffered the sickness that accompanied insufficient food and poor sanitation 
 in camps, when they had to make long rests for their cattle to recoup.<br>
 <br>
 They had started too late in July for so long a journey, and recked not of the early 
 winter of the mountains to which they journeyed.<br>
 <br>
 This has been the fault of most migrations,- a late start,-and insufficient knowledge 
 of the length of the way. Oh! they were weary, more weary than the people of Israel 
 in the desert of Sinai, who wearied of the length of the way as recounted in the 
 Scripture. Israel had a Presence in the cloud by day and in the fire by night, and 
 thus they said to themselves, in that day, "If the Lord be for us, who can be against 
 us?" An infallible guide did not call these Mormons to halt and make camp.<br>
 <br>
 Their leaders were known as prophets, priests and elders; but they were fallible 
 men, not guides familiar with the plains and the seasons. So winter caught them, 
 weak from the long trek and want of food, cattle gaunt, or gone to dust on the road 
 far back.<br>
 <br>
 Many lay down to die by the way, and many a little mound spoke of the children's 
 resting place after the mother's arm had to give them up. Still their faith flowed 
 on although their blood grew thin and their knees were feeble as they pushed forward. 
 Through the canyons they passed into the valleys of the Rocky Mountains,<br>
 <br>
 Brigham Young with a few others pressed ahead looking for the place that he claimed 
 he had seen in vision and which was to be their destined home and the promised land 
 of peace and plenty.<br>
 <br>
 This little scouting party came out of the mountains just above where the City of 
 Salt Lake now stands. They stood upon the hill,-afterwards the site of Camp Douglas 
 and the post of authority of Uncle Sam during territorial days,-and saw before them 
 the Salt Sea, the valley widely stretching south, the river flowing to the limit 
 of their vision through the divide which hid yet another and greater valley.<br>
 <br>
 "Here is the place that the Lord has chosen for this people!"<br>
 <br>
 It was Brigham Young's voice and the others bowed in assent as to the voice of a 
 prophet.<br>
 <br>
 Thus they came to their seat in the tops of the mountains, and from this center 
 they spread out to occupy any ground that had water tributary to it,-for this was 
 a land where irrigation was necessary.<br>
 <br>
 Other divisions of the Mormon host followed the next season; and soon this waste 
 was peopled with a race fitted to endure hardships such as face all pioneers.<br>
 <br>
 The over-zeal of the leaders, however, a little later on led to a fatal mistake. 
 The order went out to the rest of the waiting people on the banks of the Missouri, 
 not to provide themselves with wagons and oxen, but to content themselves with two-wheeled 
 push-carts in which they were to stow their goods; to come on thus in faith, and 
 the Lord would provide. Fine sounding words to the faithful, but foolish council 
 to the remnant of these people, eager for their earthly Zion. Of course they started 
 and at first did well; but the length of the way was too much for the strength of 
 the carts and those who pushed and pulled them.<br>
 <br>
 It is wonderful how this multitude of men, women and children got so far. They had 
 walked to the canyons of the Rockies late in the fall season,-for it was slow work 
 going this way by foot. Then the sudden cold caught them and the snows covered them. 
 They fell down as they halted for the night and many were still down to stay, when 
 the dim morning light pierced the falling snow flakes.<br>
 <br>
 The others struggled on to drop as their fellows before them, the snow their winding 
 sheet. A few hardy ones struggled through the drifted passes and like ghosts appeared 
 in the city of the Saints with cries:-<br>
 <br>
 "They are dying! Come with food and help!"<br>
 <br>
 The relief went out with hope, but it was a hope not realized; only an expectation 
 without fruitage.<br>
 <br>
 They found the train of way-worn pilgrims but they had all passed on to another 
 life.<br>
 <br>
 Faith has its triumphs, but also its tragedies. Faith can overcome mountains, but 
 faith can fall in the climbing; like all other human things, faith has its failures. 
 No matter what the directors of this push cart expedition believed possible in the 
 interests of faith, no matter what the obedient host did in trying to obtain success 
 through faith, the impossible blocked the way and this mighty pilgrimage of faith 
 ended in a fiasco.<br>
