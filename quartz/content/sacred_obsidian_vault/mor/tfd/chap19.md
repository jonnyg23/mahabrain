 <h1 align="center">CHAPTER XIX</h1>
 <h1 align="center">MIND AS THE MASTER WORKER</h1>
 <p align="center"><i>"Mind is the great lever of all things; human thought is the 
 process by which human ends are ultimately answered."</i></p>
 <p align="right"><i>Daniel Webster</i></p>
 <p>IN this age of applied psychology it is interesting and educative to note the 
 mastery of mind ' over matter in the settlement, by civilized people, of the wild 
 wastes of Utah at the time of the great Mormon trek across the plains. Mind was 
 dominant, later, in the scientific search for, and recovery of, the mineral values, 
 so long hidden and useless, in the mountains of the territory.<br>
 <br>
 The interaction of these two forces, the mental and the physical, produce the evolution 
 and thereby the development of a country and its people. Then comes wealth, comfort, 
 ease, and further exercise of mind to its higher possibilities. When life is low-graded 
 and the human mind content to grub in the ground or to hunt wild animals for a living, 
 a land remains the habitat of wild people.<br>
 <br>
 A mind of a higher grade was the main asset of the white discoverers of America. 
 Their superior weapons, skill and transportation were entirely due to the advance 
 of mind from the times of the dark ages. The early voyagers from Norse-land, in 
 their open-decked ships, were hardy seamen, but they brought no advancement to the 
 new continent, since these rude warriors had no mind above fighting and despoiling 
 their foes.<br>
 <br>
 All that was unfamiliar to them in human life was regarded as an enemy to be overcome 
 by force. It was the Era of Might, and the one of the most Might was Right, because 
 he won. The barbarian era has, at all times, been hard to supersede, and even in 
 these days of supposed "Kul-tur" there are strong advocates of a reversion to type 
 of the old Norse Vikings, Attila the Hun, or Caesar and his legions.<br>
 <br>
 We do not affirm that the mentality of the Mormon leaders was very high. These leaders 
 were men of keen wit but of little culture, judged by their speeches and writings, 
 while the people in general were very commonplace. They had a few scholars who occupied 
 a back seat, for the men of action and administration were the real shapers of history 
 in Utah.<br>
 <br>
 Of course the mentality found in the religious faith of the people was due to a 
 religious genius like Joseph Smith. If you consider a moment this young man at the 
 beginning of his mission, unknown and obscure, yet possessing an inner mental purpose 
 and power sufficient to win over by words, declarations, arguments and exhortations 
 a host of hard-headed Eastern and Western people, you will see at once the power 
 of mind when it is illumined by a purpose born of faith in a revelation from a higher 
 Power.<br>
 <br>
 The emerging of Joseph Smith from obscurity to notoriety, as the American Prophet 
 of a new faith, reads like that of the emerging of Mohammed, an uninfluential and 
 epileptic young man, amid the turbulent tribes of Arabia when he became the Father 
 of the Faithful, to the Arabians, as Abraham became the same to the Hebrews. All 
 three characters are graphic illustrations of the mastery of the mind.<br>
 <br>
 It does not follow that an enthusiasm and devotion which carries one to the death 
 is proof of the cause advocated. It does prove the sincerity and earnestness of 
 the advocate making the sacrifice.<br>
 <br>
 Many good people have perished in a poor cause which they thought sublime. Delusions 
 of mind distort its visions, but not its powers. It is for this reason that the 
 exalted fanaticism of the early Mormons carried them on to strenuous deeds, and 
 yet did not impair their powers of common sense. They could subdue a wild country 
 and learn to utilize its hidden wealth.<br>
 <br>
 We are prone to think it all bad, when some part of a delusion obsesses a race or 
 generation. If this were true the Mohammedan illusion would be rotten from core 
 to circumference. Some intense people so assert, but such is not true, as calm reflection 
 shows. A fine civilization existed in Spain under the Mohammedan Moors for seven 
 centuries, superior in art and science to the ruder life of both Franks and Teutons.<br>
 <br>
 So, while the products of Joseph Smith's visions and declarations were often erratic 
 and fanatic, nevertheless much honest-hearted goodness in word and deed is in evidence 
 if you are fair enough to look for it. I found it to be so, and I affirm that the 
 mental influence of this Latter Day faith had a constructive power to establish 
 on barren ground and amid the rude forces of nature, a settlement of homes and firesides 
 devoted to religion and to an honest life. Putting by the extremes of an ecstatic 
 people, it is undeniable that they excelled in usefulness as light excels darkness 
 the roving Indian aborigines.<br>
 <br>
 When I walked about that modern Zion of Salt Lake, "and told the homes and streets 
 thereof."<br>
 <br>
 I could not fail to read the evidence of the power of mind over matter which had 
 built a city where the Indian's wikiup had stood and had made farms out of land 
 whose only products once were sage-brush and reptiles.<br>
 <br>
 Still, the Mormon mind was not scientific, but ecstatic, and walked by faith, although 
 it had the common sense to work by sight. It was a fine motive force to lift to 
 higher levels the lives of multitudes otherwise inert, and to put the spade or hoe 
 of industry into idle hands. It redeemed a waste.<br>
 <br>
 Utah would not have advanced to her present prosperity and power had not another 
 kind of mentality sought out its treasures. It may seem a sordid motive to seek 
 for gold and silver in place of seeking for the sanctuary and salvation. Yet such 
 a sordid search has invariably preceded the higher development of a country. Trade 
 has its argonauts and argosies which in the end serve for higher things.<br>
 <br>
 With minds alert for mineral treasure, men drifted into the Territory, at first 
 a few, and later on with a rush to supplement the civilizing work of the Mormons. 
 To some their advent seemed a destructive one, for they were not religious, and 
 scoffed at the religion of the Mormons. They pointed out its weak, if not wicked 
 elements, and laughed in derision of such a faith. They were a rude lot of humanity, 
 and the Mormons countered back with accusations of their profanity and immorality. 
 These rough-living miners, unknown to themselves, were the advertisers of a coming 
 superior mental culture, which would do much for Utah's future.<br>
 <br>
 When I saw the skilled miner, and the skilled mineralogist at work with their machinery, 
 as nicely fitted for its task as a watch's mechanism, I saw the mastery of mind 
 over minerals, as I had seen it over men. Whose eyes saw and whose purpose sought 
 out this secreted wealth? It was the scientific miner, the chemist, the mineralogist, 
 the capitalist, the economist and publicist. One and all, they united their heads 
 and hands to do it. Of the wealth that they won from the rocks, some of it is in 
 banks, some in ships, some in newspapers, some in books, and some in great industrial 
 plants. Little of it is lying idle, for the men who made this wealth were not idlers. 
 Both Gentile and Mormon have had a hand in the making of a State and a Star in the 
 constellation of the Union.<br>
