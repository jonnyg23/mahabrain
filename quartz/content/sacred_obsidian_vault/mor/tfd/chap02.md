 <h1 align="center">CHAPTER II</h1>
 <h1 align="center">A FAR WEST CITY</h1>
 <p align="center"><i>"Westward the course of Empire takes its way"</i></p>
 <p align="right"><i>Berkley</i></p>
 <p>SALT LAKE CITY was a real city for that day. It was not an electrically wired 
 and telephonic town, for all those and related conveniences were then unknown to 
 the multitude. The telephone was yet in its infancy and a curious toy to the initiated 
 in electricity. It was a city of twenty-five thousand people, mainly Mormons by 
 religion and emigration from the prairie west, with a thin fringe of others locally 
 known by way of contrast as Gentiles.<br>
 <br>
 The further strange thing was that most of these adventurous Gentiles were Jews. 
 The Hebrew is an enterprising shopman and into these new valley communities and 
 freshly organized mining camps, he had pushed his way to sell his goods,-and he 
 was making good at his trade as he always does on the frontier.<br>
 <br>
 There was a sprinkling of the South; men of broken fortunes since the close of the 
 Civil War- who could not endure the changes made by the emancipation of the colored 
 man, and who preferred to face their poverty in new surroundings. Thus their pride 
 could not be offended or trampled on by former slaves.<br>
 <br>
 There were men of the cowboy and hunter class with belted waist-line and prominent 
 gun,- not exactly gunmen, for these were usually of the professional gambler class, 
 but men who knew how to use a gun and based their claims upon a gun. Then again 
 the investor and the traveller were there in ever-increasing numbers, nosing out 
 the golden opportunities always found in a newly-opened country.<br>
 <br>
 For it must be remembered that up to the time of the close of the Civil War, Utah 
 Territory was a closed section to all save those whose affiliations with the dominant 
 religion of the region were cordial and sympathetic.<br>
 <br>
 The soldier was then in his camp on the environs of the city but this military host 
 was resident as a military police, keeper of the peace, and main reason why Uncle 
 Sam was recognized as overlord of these mountain valleys. Outside of these residents, 
 the rest-a vast majority-were the peculiar people known among themselves as the 
 Latter-Day Saints.<br>
 <br>
 As I stood on Main Street, Eastside, that first day in Salt Lake City, I recalled 
 with a thrill that I had seen that identical spot in a very inferior picture some 
 eight years before. It was at a show given by Artemus Ward of humorous fame, in 
 a lecture given by him in the Egyptian Hall, London. This gifted fun-maker was in 
 the last stages of pulmonary tuberculosis, with hatchet features telling of the 
 swiftly approaching end. Yet his eyes were bright and his speech alight with humor. 
 With wit he rehearsed his story of the Mormons, and apologized for the unusual inferiority 
 of these picture daubs to illustrate Utah scenes. He showed with comical enthusiasm, 
 "the Main Street, Eastside," which he further explained was "the eastside of Main 
 Street, Salt Lake City"; and the one story brick block, faithfully pictured, was 
 the very block and corner where I now stood recalling this former introduction. 
 This sad-faced funmaker was long gone to his rest, but his laugh seemed to echo 
 about the locality.<br>
 <br>
 The climate here is genial. Something of the oriental was given to the looks of 
 the city by the wide streets, lined with mountain ash shade trees, by whose roots 
 water courses bubbled. Little brooks flowed down each side of the principal streets, 
 keeping green in the heat of the summer the park-like spaces between the walks and 
 the roadway proper.<br>
 <br>
 Much good judgment and taste was evidenced in the platting of the city by its first 
 settlers, and it is the more remarkable since the settlement was made in great privation 
 and after a long overland journey. Somehow religious enthusiasm refines and exalts 
 taste and gives an impulse to look well in one's appearances.<br>
 <br>
 The old time poverty of the first days was evidenced by an occasional adobe house 
 of small and mean build here and there amid edifices of the popular style, clapboarded, 
 Venetian shuttered, and wide-verandaed buildings of the days before the Civil War.<br>
 <br>
 I was in search of a newly-married couple to whose hospitality I bore letters of 
 introduction. Dr. Welch and his bride, whose cherry-colored cheeks bespoke her youthfulness, 
 were settled on Second South Street, near the city's center; and it was not long 
 before I was seated at their table and enjoying their talk. The Doctor was a soldier 
 of the late war and bore traces of the privation and strain of that awful strife 
 between brothers.<br>
 <br>
 Already the seeds of a fatal disease were at work, which within a few years were 
 to cut him down in the prime of life. War is not alone deadly at the cannon's mouth 
 but it slays long after the fight. The roll is not complete that gives the long 
 list of wounded and killed in a battle's campaigns, but in the tragedies of incomplete 
 lives, as in this case, where a young bride lost her love and hopes soon after marriage. 
 We knew nothing of this coming shadow as we chatted of Utah's present condition 
 and future prospects.<br>
 <br>
 While these young people were, in a sense, newcomers themselves, yet their experiences 
 in this western territory amid Mormon surroundings afforded me much good advice 
 and direction for my own course of action.<br>
 <br>
 I had made up my mind not to antagonize everything that I did not approve. In this 
 I departed somewhat from the course pursued by many recent visitors and writers 
 from the days of Artemus Ward to the year of my own arrival in Salt Lake City.<br>
 <br>
 Of course Artemus Ward was a humorist, using incorrect spelling to throw the spell 
 of fun over his readers; and I recalled his account of his experience with Utah 
 wives, as follows:-<br>
 <br>
 "'Cum and hev wives sealed to yu!' said a bunch of strappin' yung wimen tu me, wen 
 I kim out of ther meetin' house. 'Kum and build up Zion in our midst. We welkum 
 yu!'<br>
 <br>
 "'No yer don't!' sez I, a tearin' myself loos frum ther buksum arms, 'Nary a seal 
 frum me!' and I fled the sene, gatherin' up my coat and hat, and left the city, 
 which is inhabited by the most onprincipuled and dishonust pepul which I ever met.' 
 "<br>
 <br>
 Now this statement, with others printed in fun, and read wherever Artemus Ward's 
 books were read, caused great wrath among the Mormons. They had to face many gross 
 caricatures and misrepresentations of their peculiar doctrines and practices, on 
 the part of subsequent writers and visitors who too freely followed the example 
 of the Yankee showman, Artemus Ward.<br>
 <br>
 Every ward of this city of the Saints had its meeting house. The sound and aroma 
 of religion were more evident than those of education. To go to meeting was the 
 acme of life and it was truly surprising to see with what zeal the crowd attended 
 these meetings when nothing but the commonplace occurred.<br>
 <br>
 In those days and in that religious life there was no need of a fulsome and flaming 
 advertisement to draw the crowd. Just the announcement, and like the flies settling 
 on the kitchen back-door, the crowd came and settled in their seats to remain to 
 the last.<br>
 <br>
 It all goes to show what suffering and sacrifice for one's religious faith will 
 do for the first adherents of a religion. Opposition to the follies of faith seems 
 to strengthen those follies. We read that the "blood of the martyrs is the seed 
 of the church," as in the times of the early Christian persecutions.<br>
 <br>
 I was soon seated in a packed row of people in the rear of one of the ward meeting 
 houses. I was anxious to see these people at one of their everyday services. They 
 seemed to the eye to be just like common people such as you meet in any church gathering. 
 Plain, clean, simple and just ordinary bright folks.<br>
 <br>
 They evidently took their religion seriously and not as a social function. I imagine, 
 as most of them were middle aged, that they felt all they had passed through to 
 win a home and place for their faith. They evidently regarded the broad-built, and 
 bearded men, on the platform, as inspired teachers, and listened to some very ordinary 
 talk quite spell-bound.<br>
 <br>
 Of course there were some young people there; the vacant-eyed youth and the giggling 
 girl who had only to glance at each other to see something funny in that simple 
 fact. No religious meeting would be complete without that rear appendage of risible 
 youthfulness; and the huge joke of pinning John's pants pocket to Eliza's skirt 
 flounces. Such opportunities for rare and rich calf-love as a church meeting afforded, 
 could not be overlooked even in such a serious gathering as a Mormon ward house 
 meeting.<br>
 <br>
 An Apostle spoke at this gathering. He rejoiced in the common name of Smith, and 
 yet it was almost a royal name in that locality. For was not Joseph Smith the Seer, 
 Revelator and Leader of these Latter Day Saints?<br>
 <br>
 This apostle was a relative of the martyr of this church who fell the victim of 
 a Missouri mob of fanatics, who did nothing more by their crime of murder than to 
 feed the flame of a hated faith. He was a tall, bearded man. Here let me remark 
 that almost all these men of leadership were apostolically bearded. It seems the 
 part of all religious reformers or zealots to cultivate long hair, both on the head 
 and the face. The razor-cleaned manly countenance of to-day was then a sign of infancy 
 and lack of manhood. The hairy man was the popular man, and no thought was given 
 to the lack of sanitation of mouth, nose, head, neck or collar in those days when 
 "germs" were ignored.<br>
 <br>
 Apostle Smith was eloquent in the longwinded, adjectival way of speech. He certainly 
 was well up in stock phrases and popular platitudes; and brought the handclap now 
 and then like any political ward speaker. Experiences, scripture, recount of past 
 persecutions, the claims of their faith and exhortations to live their religion 
 constituted the subject matter of this address.<br>
 <br>
 They had the long prayer as well as the long speech. The Apostle Snow, a man of 
 snowy head in keeping with his name, led this devotion. It reminded me of the long 
 prayer of Pastor Wilkins, in the days of my earliest youth, who prayed about forty 
 minutes, with rousing shouts at times as if the Lord was inattentive to his words, 
 while my little legs hung aching from a hard seat; forcibly kept still by a mother's 
 hand placed on them during this solemnity of the church service.<br>
 <br>
 Another Apostle, Orson Hyde by name as I recall it, then spoke. We were in Zion 
 and the headquarters was prolific of leaders, and many of the Apostolic twelve and 
 a multitude of Patriarchs of the Church were always available for what was voluble.<br>
 <br>
 In this last speaker I beheld a typical Mormon as I had imagined him to be. He was 
 heavy set and "bearded as the pard," rather coarse of feature and more carnal than 
 spiritual in his general appearance. His heavy voice and dogmatic manner were in 
 keeping with himself and his subject, as he thundered denunciations of divine wrath 
 on the Gentiles who were invading this religious city and bringing in their corruptions. 
 He meant the mining camp morals of the adjacent canyons and gulches; and also the 
 wicked eastern world which the Mormon had shaken off and which had persecuted him 
 from city to city. It was the regular religious tirade which makes splendid copy 
 for the Speaker who talks in meeting to meeting-house people, and which invariably 
 concluded the proceedings of these ward meetings.<br>
 <br>
 I took a stroll about the town. There were two good hotels. The Walker House, which 
 was kept for the aliens who came to Zion. That is to say the miner, the millionaire, 
 the tourist and the gambler. All were well-dressed men who gathered here and defensively 
 spoke against Mormonism as though this atmosphere of religion was likely to rob 
 them of their unbelief. It was rather funny to hear so many, whose religion was 
 homeopathic indeed, talking so religiously. It was in the air then and shows how 
 psychologically catching the religious idea is even when we do not like it. It spreads 
 like measles and we have to have it before we can get over it. I laughed at this 
 ridiculous ridicule. Some of these Mormon-haters indulged in much of this kind of 
 talk while discussing topics of which they had such small experience.<br>
 <br>
 The other hotel was the Townsend House, a much more ancient structure and the gathering 
 place of the Mormons and those of Mormon sympathies. Here the talk was of the past 
 and the persecutions by the people of the States; and certain disloyal and seditious 
 sayings were very common. The wounds of the past were not healed and the arm of 
 authority, in the form of Camp Douglas, with its regiment of United States regulars, 
 was a constant subject of heated speech.<br>
 <br>
 It was very evident that two sides were here, and no fence between them of sufficient 
 width for a comfortable seat for the non-committal, easygoing man who wanted to 
 be friendly with all and a foe to none.<br>
 <br>
 The new element, known as Gentile in the phraseology of this region, had its belligerent 
 news-sheet, the <i>Salt Lake Tribune</i>. It had able men devoted to its sarcastic 
 bitter gibes at the territory's majority of people. To offset this sheet the Mormon 
 church had <i>The Deseret News</i>, and it was just as ably edited and just as caustically 
 worded as its opponent. It was a real treat in comparative hatred to read both these 
 papers in one morning.<br>
