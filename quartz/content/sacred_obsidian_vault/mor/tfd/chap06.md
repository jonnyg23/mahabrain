 <h1 align="center">CHAPTER VI</h1>
 <h1 align="center">THE VALLEY SETTLEMENTS</h1>
 <p align="center"><i>"The desert shall rejoice and blossom like a rose."</i></p>
 <p align="right"><i>Bible</i></p>
 <p>A STRING of valleys, rich of soil, but scant of water, stretched from north to 
 south in this territory from Salt Lake City to Saint George. It was the policy of 
 these people to occupy the land in settlements similar to those of the French Canadians. 
 No doubt the idea was born of the observations, made in earlier days, by the Mormon 
 leaders who were mostly from the New England States. They were probably visitors, 
 at times, across the border from New Hampshire or Vermont, and so knew how the French 
 habitant was housed in villages with their farms farther afield. To their labor 
 they went forth in the morning, to return, at the call of the "Angelus," from their 
 fields to their settlement-firesides at night.<br>
 <br>
 This made for social life, and suited well the gregarious and garrulous genius of 
 the French race stock that settled that eastern portion of the great Canadian Dominion. 
 It did more. It gave the religious leader and teacher, the priest of the Roman Church, 
 the power and opportunity to reach, by ready speech, the people whose easy assembling 
 was possible, after work hours, since they were village residents.<br>
 <br>
 There were no solitary farmhouses, often out of sight of a neighbor, and so out 
 of mind, touch and sympathy; such as we see on the wide plains of the Dakotas of 
 the North-West; or could have seen, in those early days, on the prairies of Illinois 
 or the woodlands of Indiana or Ohio.<br>
 <br>
 So these Utah settlers occupied town and hamlets, and the meeting house, the center 
 of its life, was always well filled by adjacent residents. By every water course, 
 small or large, near or distant, from the hills which supplied these rills, these 
 settlements were formed. Each was fully organized and often incorporated, having 
 mayor, council, wards; like any city.<br>
 <br>
 The lands adjacent were divided up among the people so that each family head, and 
 those acting as heads of or for families, could have the proverbial forty acres 
 and a mule, a sufficient start in life on the soil. How sensible, stable, and socialistic 
 this was, is seen in the contentment and progress of these settlers from the first 
 days. Right speedily the ground tickled with the hoe, laughed with a harvest, everywhere 
 that the lavish waters of the towering Wasatch or Orquirreh Ranges could be diverted.<br>
 <br>
 The silver streams of embryo wealth to a desert-land came, in torrents, down the 
 rough granite studded canyons, to waste their life giving power by falling into 
 the Utah Jordan, and then rolling south into Utah Lake, the modern Sea of Galilee 
 with towns around its watery shores.<br>
 <br>
 But industry harnessed these waters as the Eastern settlers did their mill-streams 
 by dams, to make them commercially profitable and powerful. So the Mormon people 
 by canals cut to suit the contour of the land brought water to every little patch 
 of arable soil. The fair clime and genial sun of Utah, mountain-sheltered from the 
 Borean blasts that swept the prairie wastes to the west, made farming both a delight 
 and a success.<br>
 <br>
 I have never seen finer wheat than the symmetrical, golden kernels of grain in the 
 Utah Valley. And the yield was most generous when properly watered; forty and fifty 
 bushels being common. What toothsome loaves the housewives made from this wheat, 
 milled by Utah's Cooperative Institution.<br>
 <br>
 The fruit of these settlements was on a par with the grain. Peaches, especially, 
 were finely-flavored and were generally raised. Almost every sloping shed-roof, 
 in the season, was covered with cut peaches drying in the sun, for the market at 
 home and abroad. In fact, these people, who knew the keen bite of poverty for the 
 few first years, soon had all that the mouth and stomach asked for, in the way of 
 varied foods.<br>
 <br>
 Cattle, too, well-fed, throve and helped the dairy to nourish, and the meat market 
 to be well supplied.<br>
 <br>
 I think that you can see the character and appearance of these settlements. The 
 borders of each incorporated town touched those of the succeeding one, as you travelled 
 south, so in one sense you were never out of town.<br>
 <br>
 This applied to the good land districts above. Of course there was much benchland, 
 sagebrush areas, for which water could not be procured, being either too expensive 
 to grade to the land in need, or there was not sufficient dependable water to be 
 had to warrant the laying out of a settlement. So Utah still had its waste places, 
 and the silences belonging to all waste places.<br>
 <br>
 These valley settlements began around the Great Salt Lake, the main city of the 
 Saints being the principal one. They then spread generally southward, over the divides 
 separating these valleys of the mountains and so continued to the limit of the territory 
 where it slipped over the rim of a basin, to lower altitudes, in northern Arizona, 
 at St. George.<br>
 <br>
 At this latter and remote settlement, there was a sanitarium of climate, whose soft 
 mildness in winter made it a resort for those who could afford the expense of a 
 long stage trip in search of a change of season and the restoration of broken health.<br>
 <br>
 I rode about the towns that fringed the shores of Utah Lake and as I looked at its 
 waters, quiet now, and the next hour swept by the torrential winds that came out 
 of Spanish Fork Canyon as though shot from a high-powered gigantic air-gun, I thought 
 of the blue Sea of Galilee, and the tempestuous night passage by Christ and his 
 disciples.<br>
 <br>
 Down the long stretch from Payson, the town at the south end of this fresh water 
 inland sea, to Nephi beneath the lofty crest and ancient snows of Mount Nebo, overlooking 
 its quiet streets, one travels through little settlements of the types, which I 
 have already described; occupied by a class of small farmers, all doing well, but 
 not one of them rich.<br>
 <br>
 The territory of my day was a land of little-landers and small fortunes; the capitalist 
 was nosing in, but he was a gentile, or a foreign investor, who was after mines 
 and commodities, and fought shy of fanning and soil investments.<br>
 <br>
 Mount Nebo, whose height was unclimbed by any Utah prophet, was the dividing range 
 that intervened between the settlements of San Pete Valley, filled with Scandinavian 
 settlers, and the main valley by Parowan, down which the railroad of this modern 
 age passes on its way from Salt Lake to Los Angeles.<br>
 <br>
 I left the railroad at a little south of Payson, and from thence all my travelling 
 was by stage or canvas covered wagon, or on the broncho of that region.<br>
 <br>
 I found the people homely, happy in their way, self-satisfied as to their sainthood 
 and church life, but quite unintellectual. I do not mean that they were more ignorant 
 than the usual rural population of the West of that day; they had a lot of homely 
 wisdom and quaint sayings, with the usual horse-trading cuteness and wit; but as 
 to thinking for themselves they were not remarkable, for like many a church folk 
 in many a clime, they left all their thinking for the professional thinkers and 
 creed makers; and so like sheep, satisfied with their shepherds, they listened to 
 the voice of their authorities and acquiesced in all their demands.<br>
 <br>
 I have sat in many a cosy parlor, with the visitor's chair in evidence, and enjoyed 
 the hospitality and good will of industrious house-wives. I saw very little evidence 
 of married unhappiness, or of a pronounced polygamy. Of course it was there, and 
 some of the homesteads gave ocular evidence of plural wifehood with separate doors 
 and windows of section-made adobe houses visible from the roadside.<br>
 <br>
 The children were barefooted, browned, and healthy. They were wild-eyed and shy 
 when questioned by a stranger, but very little more so than those of any rural people 
 who see but little of the outside bustling world of commerce.<br>
 <br>
 Surely these settlements, utilizing these broad acres, otherwise idle, were a better 
 product, despite these peculiarities, than a waste of sage and sand given over to 
 hordes of coyotes, the prowling bear and wildcat.<br>
