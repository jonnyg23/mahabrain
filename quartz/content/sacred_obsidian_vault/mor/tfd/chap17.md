 <h1 align="center">CHAPTER XVII</h1>
 <h1 align="center">TENDERFOOT SUPERINTENDENTS</h1>
 <p align="center"><i>"Like leaves on trees the race of man is found, Now green in 
 youth, now withering on the ground: Another race the following spring supplies, 
 They fall successive and successive rise."</i></p>
 <p align="right"><i>Pope</i></p>
 <p>I WAS a Tenderfoot, in the vernacular of the camp, but there were many others 
 of the same grade of experience. While, here and there, veterans were in charge 
 of mining interests, tenderfoot superintendents abounded.<br>
 <br>
 I suppose the moneyed men and the stockholders of the various incorporated companies 
 in this camp were under the spell of romantic adventure in the use of their surplus 
 wealth in this distant region, because distance lent enchantment to their view. 
 It is remarkable how romance has influenced wealth. Otherwise rich-freighted ships 
 never would have been sent across wide seas, in search of unknown lands, during 
 the times of Queen Elizabeth. It surely was romance which formed, under the charter 
 from Charles II, the trading company with this sonorous title, "The Govenour and 
 Company of Gentlemen Adventurers Trading into Hudson's Bay." Romance helped to send 
 Francis Drake around the world in search of both gold and Spaniards, and Walter 
 Raleigh to make his ventures in Virginia. Romance lies back of Arctic Voyages and 
 Northwest trading trips to "where rolls the Oregon," or "where the wolf's long howl 
 is heard on On-alaska's shore."<br>
 <br>
 I do not wonder that romantic young men were found and commissioned, by romantic 
 old men, to superintend these mining ventures.<br>
 <br>
 These tenderfoot superintendents came out West smartly garbed, even to cuffs and 
 white shirt collars. A few were dressed in theatrical garb, to look their part from 
 the Eastern view-point. They looked ridiculous to the seasoned miner, used to hard 
 tack and hard times. The camp had quite a group of such young men, full to the brim 
 with a book and college knowledge of minerals, tunnel and shaft mining. They were 
 educated in their way, but babes to the real business of finding ores and making 
 the search profitable.<br>
 <br>
 Of all these tenderfoot superintendents, three were known to me very well, and the 
 first I name, became a warm friend.<br>
 <br>
 Clarence Waterman was a youth for his position, for he was only a little past his 
 majority. He was growing a downy moustache and whiskers, but these indications of 
 manhood were silky with the touch of youth. He was a really good fellow in many 
 ways, especially in his cheerfulness. He had the youth's bump of conceit well-developed. 
 But this bump may have helped him over obstacles which his youthfulness could not 
 have surmounted. No doubt it was this conceit which obtained him his position as 
 superintendent. I can imagine his father and his father's friends, at a company 
 meeting, saying,<br>
 <br>
 "Clarence! Do you think you can manage our mines out there in Utah?"<br>
 <br>
 "Oh yes indeed. I can do that easily." So, being a favorite son, and a favored one 
 by the company, this young Mr. Inexperience was dubbed Mining Superintendent, financed 
 for his journey, and entrusted with the funds to open new work in Bingham Canyon.<br>
 <br>
 Tom Robbins was a dark-featured, gloomy-vis-aged young man, who grew a fierce black 
 moustache. His eyes showed much of the sclerotic coat, and he had a way of rolling 
 his eyes which made him look fiercer and more commanding than he really was. He 
 had charge of the Grey Eagle group of mines, and to hear him talk you would feel 
 sure the only real mineral wealth of the camp was in this group. He was of a musical 
 turn, and put a great deal of the company's money into a Steinway piano, which was 
 placed in his office in the best hotel of the town. He was a rattling player, and 
 spent much of his spare time in the company of some musical young women of a neighboring 
 boarding house. This tenderfoot superintendent was ideally togged out by Eastern 
 tailors, and looked like a stage hero, much to the delight of the girls.<br>
 <br>
 The third of these men was James Shuthler. He looked more like a dry-goods clerk 
 in size, build, and manner of carriage than a forceful boss of mining men of the 
 wild West. Shuthler, like most little men, was a great talker, but there was a steely 
 look in his pale-blue eyes which showed he had "grit" at the bottom. He had a hobby. 
 It was playing a worn, shabby violin, which he affirmed was a hundred and fifty 
 years old and once the property of a German master of music. He certainly got very 
 sweet strains out of its strings, and he and Robbins were the center of attraction 
 at every social and dance.<br>
 <br>
 Clarence Waterman's special interest was a divided one. When not thumping his Remington 
 typewriter he was riding his rat-tailed broncho. It was one of those vicious little 
 beasts which show their mustang origin. When a horse uses his tail like a whisk-broom, 
 and puts back his ears like a rabbit when you saddle him, you naturally look for 
 trouble of some sort. Waterman loaded down his little broncho with a full outfit 
 of Mexican saddlery, and the little beast was double-bitted, and so strapped fore 
 and aft that his inexperienced rider seldom came to grief. He paid some horse-shark 
 one hundred and twenty-five dollars for a fifteen dollar animal, but he was so proud 
 of his nimble purchase, for the horse could run, that we left him alone in his glory.<br>
 <br>
 The real work in these mines was done by the foremen, usually old hands; while these 
 superintendents got all the honor through correspondence with headquarters, and 
 the disbursements of the payroll money that came regularly through their hands.<br>
 <br>
 One old foreman was a former cook. This I knew since I ate a Thanksgiving dinner 
 which he produced out of the abundant stores of the mine, and his skill with a big 
 cook stove. It was a fine assortment of food built out of canned goods, all save 
 a huge steak smothered in onions. This repast sufficed for six hungry miners and 
 three visitors, besides himself, and cost the management quite a penny.<br>
 <br>
 But miners, I found, are nothing if not hospitable ; and one never failed to be 
 invited to a good meal if one happened in at the right time.<br>
 <br>
 I went up to see all of these mining ventures, entered all of the tunnels, and went 
 down all of the shafts; also asked a great many useless questions, while the working-shift 
 patiently answered between pauses in shovelling rock.<br>
 <br>
 The Ilion Mine, Clarence Waterman Superintendent,-if you had read the sign board 
 on the tunnel house,-was a wet mine. They were supposed to be seeking the rich mineral 
 vein, beneath the discovery hole on the summit of a rocky bluff overlooking the 
 canyon.<br>
 <br>
 An able mineralogist, a learned geologist and the surveyor specialist,-all high 
 priced men,- had reported that the signs indicated a big bonanza below this discovery 
 hole. So after it they went with men, money and machinery. When I went into the 
 wet workings, the tunnel's breast was nine hundred feet from the entrance. A large 
 gutter was cut, as they ran the tunnel in, since the face and walls oozed water 
 so constantly that a little river ran out of the entry and down the mountain side. 
 This whole tunnel was timbered and required no end of prepared wood and a couple 
 of carpenters to keep up with the miners. Now wages were high, four or five dollars 
 a day, timber scarce and high too. You could see money going into the hole, but 
 you could not see it coming out. The Ilion people had great faith in their great 
 mine, but that did not prevent its being a great failure. Stereotyped reports of 
 the workings were sent in every week, and for a time the goose that laid the golden 
 egg kept on laying it. The miners laughed over these reports, but receiving their 
 wages regularly they worked on at what their practical knowledge foresaw would be 
 a barren result. At the time I left Utah the mine was closed down, another one among 
 a hundred failures.<br>
 <br>
 I started a day school. The community had voted against a public school, for the 
 population was a transient one, and little interested in family life and in the 
 care of children. Several responsible men urged me to undertake a private education 
 far the public. I rented a part of a vacant hotel, the parlor and dining room, and 
 this made a good sized schoolroom to accommodate fifty scholars.<br>
 <br>
 I also purchased the red-wood shelving of a defunct dry-goods store, and worked 
 up this lumber, with a little outside help, into seats and desks in lieu of the 
 usual school furniture. People were not so particular then about the outfitting 
 of a schoolhouse. In a camp like Bingham, where the church building was an old saloon, 
 somewhat altered, it was not difficult to make a hotel parlor serve for a schoolhouse.<br>
 <br>
 These camp buildings were of the up-and-down rough-lumber sort, with the cracks 
 covered with strips of the same stuff. None of the buildings were painted, save 
 one pretentious hotel, the aristocrat of the camp.<br>
 <br>
 I used to have the room full of boys and girls, who came at 9 A. M. on Mondays to 
 pay their school dues in the dirty, sticky currency of the day. "Shin-plasters," 
 these little bills of the Federal Treasury, were called. We seldom saw a piece of 
 silver coin, for it had all gone either to Canada or Europe. Our school hours were 
 from 9 A. M. to 1 P. M., with a recess midday. I secured a supply of old books, 
 maps, and blackboard material in Salt Lake City, and gave them free to the school. 
 The cost of this education to each scholar was a fifty-cent "shin-plaster" paid 
 every Monday. Most of the children were studious and seemed glad to have the chance 
 to get at their books, I had a little trouble now and then. For instance, a couple 
 of boys of twelve and fourteen years, sons of a saloon man, seemed to be ambitious 
 to rival the toughs of the bar-room. One of them carried a big knife on the inside 
 of his leg-boot, while the other secreted a small caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver 
 in his pants rear-pocket. This last young, ster was quite ferocious in his talk, 
 for he asserted that he had "got his man." It seemed, on inquiry, that he had accidentally 
 shot another boy, in rough play, with a pistol. The foolish jests of the roughs 
 about his father's place had taken serious root in his mind, so he was really proud 
 of his "bloody record," like any other "bad man." I took their arsenal away and 
 requested their father to come for the weapons. This he did, and when I suggested 
 he lock up these weapons and keep his boys out of harm's way he declared his boys 
 were not being raised "milk-sops," but to fight their way through life. Probably 
 years later these boys may have fulfilled their foolish father's wishes and figured 
 as "gunmen," ending their lives by dying with their boots on.<br>
 <br>
 This school ran all winter and well into spring, when an epidemic of scarlet fever 
 entered the camp, through some Mormon teamsters from the valley towns, and perforce 
 the school was closed for the season. This schoolroom was used two evenings of each 
 week for musicals. I had a small organ, with handles, which Clarence Waterman and 
 myself carried back and forth from school to church, as it was needed.<br>
 <br>
 To these Sings in the schoolroom the tenderfoot superintendents before mentioned 
 and a number of young women interested in music and church work used to come. Without 
 doubt the sex attraction had much to do with this weekly rally of the younger element, 
 since the men came generally as escorts of the ladies. How much religion is based 
 on human interest, and how much on superhuman interest, is a vital query hard to 
 answer correctly. I suppose the mysteries of life, and its apparent dissolution, 
 have a strong pull, which is almost superhuman in its power for church going; but 
 I also think that Reuben and Rachel cut a figure in the making of a congregation. 
 There were good musicians and some fair singers who were willing to exercise their 
 gifts and spend time in this way, but no sense of duty was the motive; only the 
 simple idea of something pleasant to do. When it seemed an unpleasant task it was 
 not done, and they did not trouble to come.<br>
 <br>
 I was forced to do a little mining. I occupied a very small house, built close into 
 the hill on a narrow slip of ground; the road passing so close in front that the 
 ore wagons, in going by, often struck the steps in front. A roaring creek was just 
 across the road. A slide of earth from the steep hill, back of the house, bulged 
 in the kitchen wall. I procured the miner's weapons, a pick and shovel, and began 
 digging away the dirt.<br>
 <br>
 "Say! pan out that dirt. You may find gold color." Waterman was passing and called 
 to me. I laughed at the boyish idea, but took his advice. In the creek a few feet 
 below I washed out several pans of dirt, using the rotary movement which carries 
 the surplus dirt over the edge of the pan, but no color appeared for some time. 
 I persevered and was rewarded by seeing a sparkle in the black sediment in the bottom 
 of the tin dish. This occurred every now and then. By the time I tired, and had 
 removed all the land-slip, I was possessed with a very small can of sediment. This 
 I washed over carefully and collected a few small grains of color. In the assay 
 office, later, I found my hour's labor had yielded fifty cents' worth of gold. This 
 was a wage of four dollars a day of eight hours of labor.<br>
 <br>
 I record this to show how alluring the conditions were to a tenderfoot. The creek 
 was a rich placer in many spots, the hills had often signs of pay dirt, while the 
 rocks, when mined, contained visible veins of lead, silver, and gold leading to 
 ore pockets, and sometimes to great ore deposits which required only the science 
 of the smelter to reduce to commercial wealth.<br>
 <br>
 I witnessed the luck of one tenderfoot superintendent. He had lost his job, for 
 his company had "gone broke," as the saying is. Tom Darmody was a very easy-going 
 fellow, who had brought out his wife that he might have home cooking instead of 
 cook-house fare. They lived in a little shack on the other side of the creek. He 
 was mining on his own account, and I often saw him come home wet and disgusted with 
 his hard labor. One day he got back in time to find his wife on the roof of the 
 shack shrieking, "A snake! A snake!" A big rattler was in the kitchen, and had driven 
 the mistress outdoors. This was nothing strange, for the rocks were full of these 
 reptiles in the warm weather. A little pistol work laid out Mr. Rattlesnake, with 
 eight buttons on his tail, a harmless but hideous corpse on the kitchen floor. A 
 bevy of housewives soon assembled to view the creature and to congratulate the lady 
 of the house on her escape and the bravery she had shown. I feel sure that Tom Darmody 
 gallantly told it around that his wife did the shooting. One day Darmody came in 
 on the stride and shouting, "We've struck it rich!" He had broken into a large ore 
 chamber.<br>
 <br>
 "Our fortune's made, my dear! We can go<br>
 <br>
 home in a month."<br>
 <br>
 They did. In a few days he sold out his fine prospect to a mining crew for $25,000 
 and left for the "East and Happiness," to use his own words. He was sensible. He 
 did not stay to reinvest his fortune, nor gamble it away in expectation of still 
 better luck.<br>
 <br>
 There was one lucky superintendent who was not a tenderfoot. Old Judge Eells, a 
 man of sixty-five, and his wife, an old-time lady of rare amiability, were residents 
 of the camp. I boarded with Judge Eells for two months and found him a man of fine 
 character. He always had family worship in his house every Sunday, and thought he 
 was doing well for the West. And so he was. Late one Saturday night he and his partner 
 opened up a large pocket of ore; he insisted on waiting until Monday before demonstrating 
 its extent. You see the grit of the man in this action. His partner offered him 
 $ 16,000 for his prospects before Monday was past. Listening to his wife's plea, 
 he accepted the sum offered, and the old couple returned to their home in Waukesha, 
 Wisconsin, there to enjoy their good fortune.<br>
