Revelation through Joseph Smith, April 1830. <i><br> History of the Church</i> 1:64-70.</h3>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a></font></span> The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh, it being regularly organized and established agreeable to the laws of our country, by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April—</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a></font></span> Which commandments were given to Joseph Smith, Jun., who was called of God, and ordained an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the first elder of this church;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a></font></span> And to Oliver Cowdery, who was also called of God, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the second elder of this church, and ordained under his hand;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a></font></span> And this according to the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory, both now and forever. Amen.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a></font></span> After it was truly manifested unto this first elder that he had received a remission of his sins, he was entangled again in the vanities of the world;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a></font></span> But after repenting, and humbling himself sincerely, through faith, God ministered unto him by an holy angel, whose countenance was as lightning, and whose garments were pure and white above all other whiteness;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a></font></span> And gave unto him commandments which inspired him;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a></font></span> And gave him power from on high, by the means which were before prepared, to translate the Book of Mormon;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a></font></span> Which contains a record of a fallen people, and the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and to the Jews also;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a></font></span> Which was given by inspiration, and is confirmed to others by the ministering of angels, and is declared unto the world by them—</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a></font></span> Proving to the world that the holy scriptures are true, and that God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a></font></span> Thereby showing that he is the same God yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a></font></span> Therefore, having so great witnesses, by them shall the world be judged, even as many as shall hereafter come to a knowledge of this work.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a></font></span> And those who receive it in faith, and work righteousness, shall receive a crown of eternal life;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a></font></span> But those who harden their hearts in unbelief, and reject it, it shall turn to their own condemnation—</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a></font></span> For the Lord God has spoken it; and we, the elders of the church, have heard and bear witness to the words of the glorious Majesty on high, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a></font></span> By these things we know that there is a God in heaven, who is infinite and eternal, from everlasting to everlasting the same unchangeable God, the framer of heaven and earth, and all things which are in them;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a></font></span> And that he created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness, created he them;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:19">20:19</a></font></span> And gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:20">20:20</a></font></span> But by the transgression of these holy laws man became sensual and devilish, and became fallen man.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:21">20:21</a></font></span> Wherefore, the Almighty God gave his Only Begotten Son, as it is written in those scriptures which have been given of him.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:22">20:22</a></font></span> He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:23">20:23</a></font></span> He was crucified, died, and rose again the third day;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:24">20:24</a></font></span> And ascended into heaven, to sit down on the right hand of the Father, to reign with almighty power according to the will of the Father;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:25">20:25</a></font></span> That as many as would believe and be baptized in his holy name, and endure in faith to the end, should be saved—</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:26">20:26</a></font></span> Not only those who believed after he came in the meridian of time, in the flesh, but all those from the beginning, even as many as were before he came, who believed in the words of the holy prophets, who spake as they were inspired by the gift of the Holy Ghost, who truly testified of him in all things, should have eternal life,</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:27">20:27</a></font></span> As well as those who should come after, who should believe in the gifts and callings of God by the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the Father and of the Son;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:28">20:28</a></font></span> Which Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are one God, infinite and eternal, without end. Amen.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:29">20:29</a></font></span> And we know that all men must repent and believe on the name of Jesus Christ, and worship the Father in his name, and endure in faith on his name to the end, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:30">20:30</a></font></span> And we know that justification through the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is just and true;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:31">20:31</a></font></span> And we know also, that sanctification through the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is just and true, to all those who love and serve God with all their mights, minds, and strength.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:32">20:32</a></font></span> But there is a possibility that man may fall from grace and depart from the living God;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:33">20:33</a></font></span> Therefore let the church take heed and pray always, lest they fall into temptation;</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:34">20:34</a></font></span> Yea, and even let those who are sanctified take heed also.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:35">20:35</a></font></span> And we know that these things are true and according to the revelations of John, neither adding to, nor diminishing from the prophecy of his book, the holy scriptures, or the revelations of God which shall come hereafter by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, the voice of God, or the ministering of angels.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:36">20:36</a></font></span> And the Lord God has spoken it; and honor, power and glory be rendered to his holy name, both now and ever. Amen.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:37">20:37</a></font></span> <i>And again, by way of commandment to the church concerning the manner of baptism</i>—All those who humble themselves before God, and desire to be baptized, and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and witness before the church that they have truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins, shall be received by baptism into his church.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_20:38">20:38</a></font></span> <i>The</i> <i>duty of the elders, priests, teachers, deacons, and members of the church of Christ</i>—An apostle is an elder, and it is his calling to baptize;</p>
