 <p align="center">ABRAHAM IN EGYPT.--CONFIRMATORY STATEMENTS OR JOSEPHUS, NICOLAUS 
 OF DAMASCUS, AND OTHERS.--ABRAHAM'S INFLUENCE ON THE RELIGIONS OF EGYPT, PERSIA 
 AND HINDOOSTAN.--TRACES OF GOSPEL TEACHING IN THE MYTHOLOGIES OF EGYPT, PERSIA, 
 CHALDEA, GREECE AND ROME.--FIRST DEPARTURES FROM THE TRUE FAITH.--THE EGYPTIAN WORSHIP 
 OF ADAM AND THE PATRIARCHS.--THE BOOK OF THE DEAD. </p>
 <p align="left">THE Book of Abraham states that God commanded the patriarch to show 
 unto the Egyptians the things that He had revealed unto him. Josephus, in narrating 
 this portion of Abraham's history--being only partially acquainted with the facts 
 of the case from the authorities at his disposal--tell us that Abraham went down 
 into Egypt to avoid the famine in Canaan, and to "become an auditor of their priests, 
 and to know what they said concerning the gods; designing either to follow them 
 if they had better notions than he, or to convert them into a better way if his 
 own notions proved the truest."[<a name="text1" href="#foot1">1</a>] After his arrival 
 in Egypt, and the circumstances arising out of the attempt of Pharaoh to add Sarah 
 to the number of his wives, the outcome of which placed the monarch under obligations 
 to the patriarch, Josephus states that "Pharaoh gave Abraham leave to enter into 
 conversation with the most learned among the Egyptians, from which conversation 
 his virtue and his reputation became more conspicuous than they had been before. 
 For whereas the Egyptians were formerly addicted to different customs, and despised 
 one another's sacred and accustomed rites, and were very angry one with another 
 on that account, Abraham conferred with each of them, and, confuting the reasonings 
 they made use of, every one for his own practices, he demonstrated that such reasonings 
 were vain and void of truth; whereupon he was admired by them in those conferences 
 as a very wise man, and one of great sagacity, when he discoursed upon any subject 
 he undertook; and this not only in understanding it, but in persuading other men 
 also to assent to him."[<a name="text2" href="#foot2">2</a>] In another place the 
 Jewish historian states, "He (Abraham) was a person of great sagacity, both for 
 understanding all things, and persuading his hearers, and not mistaken in his opinions; 
 for which reason he began to have higher notions of virtue than others had, and 
 he determined to renew and to change the opinion all men happened then to have concerning 
 God."[<a name="text3" href="#foot3">3</a>] </p>
 <p align="left">So far as Josephus' testimony, confirmatory of this portion of the 
 Book of Abraham, is concerned, we deem the above abundant. In later chapters we 
 shall show the great political and religious changes that Abraham's visits to Egypt 
 produced. </p>
 <p align="left">From Egypt we will turn to Persia, and from the writings of various 
 modern authors adduce testimony to prove that Abraham's power as a religious teacher 
 was felt, known and recognized in the faith and creed of that nation. </p>
 <p align="left">In the sacred book of the ancient Persians and modern Parsees-- 
 the Zend Avista--"it is declared that the religion taught in it was received from 
 Abraham; and according to Hyde, who supports his statements by quotations and references, 
 this was believed by leading Arabian writers not only of Persian Magianism but of 
 Indian Brahmanism." The same writer remarks: "The claims of Magianism to have been 
 influenced by the revelations made to Abraham are far from being discountenanced 
 by the laws of historical probability. For the war waged so successfully by Abraham 
 in behalf of his kinsman, Lot, against the five kings, among whom was the king of 
 Elam [<i>i.e., </i>Persia], is of itself a sufficient proof that the Father of the 
 Faithful, Abraham, the Hebrew from Ur of the Chaldees, must have been as well known 
 to the eastern kingdoms as Moses was in after times."[<a name="text4" href="#foot4">4</a>]
 </p>
 <p align="left">It is generally admitted that in the days of Abraham the forefathers 
 of the Persians and Brahmins were one people, inhabiting one region of country. 
 It is supposed that the ancestors of the latter race moved to India from 1500 to 
 1300 years B. C. That these two races are of common descent is urged from the close 
 relationship existing between the Sanskrit, the language of the Brahmins, and the 
 Zend or Persian; it is also said that the "remarkable identity between the Brahminical 
 and Persian mythologies indicates, unerringly, the original union of the two." It 
 may also be noticed that Hitzig, in his "Geschichte dcs Volkes Israel," reasons 
 from the identity of certain practices observed by Abraham and the patriarchs of 
 Israel on the one hand, and by Brahminical Hindoos on the other, that a community 
 of some kind once existed between these people. </p>
 <p align="left">The two nations being thus admitted, by authors of research, to 
 have been one people in Abraham's time, it is supposable that the Brahmin as well 
 as the Persian branch of the family would exhibit some traces of Abraham's ministry. 
 On this point it has been written "Abraham's influence extended to Bactria, and 
 the most complete proof at once of its spread, and the spread with it of the name 
 and renown of Abraham, is contained in the language and name of the Brahminical 
 Hindoos."[<a name="text5" href="#foot5">5</a>] </p>
 <p align="left">"The name Brahma signifies he who multiplies; the name Abraham likewise 
 means the father of a multitude. (Arabic, Rahama, a multitude. Genesis xxii, 5.) 
 The wife of Brahma was named Savitree. The wife of Abraham was named Sarai or Sarah." 
 [<a name="text6" href="#foot6">6</a>] </p>
 <p align="left">Mr. Goodsir, remarking on this last extract, writes: "These coincidences 
 appear to us to be well deserving of attention, though we are not aware that they 
 have ever before been noticed. We leave them and the whole question of the identity 
 of Brahma and Abraham to the judgment of our readers, merely observing, in conclusion, 
 that having found Adam and Noah and Ham to have been the father-gods of Egyptian 
 mythology, and Japhet the father-god of that of Greece, there is abundant analogy 
 as well as probability in our inference that the father-god of the Indian superstition 
 was Abraham." </p>
 <p align="left">Admitting the truth of the following extract from the writings of 
 Nicolaus of Damascus, referred to by Josephus, it is very easy to understand when 
 and how Abraham obtained his great influence in Persia; and we know of no conflicting 
 testimony to render the statements unworthy of our consideration. He writes, in 
 the fourth book of his history: "Abram reigned in Damascus, being a foreigner, who 
 came with an army out of the land above Babylon, called the land of the Chaldees; 
 but after a long time he got him up and removed from that country also, with his 
 people, and went into the land then called the land of Canaan, but now the land 
 of Judea. * * * Now the name of Abram is even still famous in the country of Damascus, 
 and there is shewed a village named from him, the habitation of Abraham." </p>
 <p align="left">We now come to the consideration of the traces, ofttimes scarcely 
 discernable, found in the pagan religions of the ancient nations of the eastern 
 continent, of a time when the worship of the true God was taught and understood 
 in their midst, for we fully believe that having made of one blood all the nations 
 of the earth, "God guided and ruled over pagan nations in a manner the same in kind, 
 though much modified in degree, as in the case of the chosen people; and for the 
 same great final end." Let it not be supposed, in the following pages, that we desire 
 to extenuate the sinfulness, or to palliate the foulness of idolatrous, cruel, unclean 
 and licentious paganism in any of its branches. Our desire is to exalt the goodness 
 of God, as well as to show that under all the vileness, the indecency, the lust 
 and cruelty of many of the forms of ancient paganism, could be found a sub-stratum 
 of pure revealed truth, testifying to us that at some period the fathers of these 
 peoples held intercourse with the servants of the true God, but had fallen away 
 from the principles of righteousness aforetime taught them, and after their own 
 peculiar ways and to suit their own peculiar notions and desires, had heaped to 
 themselves gods and demons, creeds and rites, ceremonies and mysteries, oracles 
 and auguries, differing in different nations according to the force of circumstances 
 and the direction given to them by master minds. </p>
 <p align="left">As a proof of the truth of our position, we have but to refer to 
 the fact that it has been demonstrated that the further we go back through the centuries 
 to the primeval days succeeding the dispersion of mankind at the Tower of Babel, 
 the more frequent and more noticeable are the traces of pure religious truth found 
 intermingled with the follies and vagueries of man-made religions. As an example 
 of this, it is recounted by Levy, the Roman historian, that certain sacred books 
 having been found at the burying place of Numa, the great religious legislator of 
 early Rome, they were burned because they were not suited to the times in which 
 they were discovered, when Rome had added scores of gods to its Pantheon, though 
 they were considered suited to the early era in which they were written, when Numa 
 forbade images and their worship as well as the offering of human sacrifices.
 </p>
 <p align="left">It is not difficult for those who believe in the Bible as it is 
 written, to understand that immediately after the flood there was but one form of 
 faith upon the earth, and that the true one. Noah was a preacher of righteousness 
 both before and after the deluge, and because of their obedience to God's laws, 
 he and his family were saved from the universal destruction that came upon the wicked. 
 But their descendants, in an early day, began to depart from the purity of the truths 
 that had saved "the fathers," and a knowledge of the forms of iniquity that existed 
 amongst the antediluvians was in some manner conveyed to them, and incorporated 
 in their debased new systems of worship. Noah, Melchizedek and others battled with 
 but partial success against these growing infamies, and Abraham was especially called 
 of the Lord to usher in a new dispensation. We have seen, in part, how he fulfilled 
 this call; we shall now refer to some Gospel ideas that for many centuries afterwards 
 were found incorporated amongst the filth and rubbish of paganism, some in Egypt, 
 some in Persia, some in Chaldea, some in Greece, Rome and other nations. From this 
 almost universal admixture of the true and the false it is evident that there was 
 some primeval source from which the ancient gentile nations drew that which was 
 good and true in their religions. </p>
 <p align="left">In our researches into the mythology of these peoples we find, amongst 
 others, the following Gospel ideas: </p>
 <p align="left">The belief in the existence of one great father God. </p>
 <p align="left">The prophecy and expectation of the coming of a Son of God in the 
 flesh. </p>
 <p align="left">A reverence for Adam as the great prince of his race, in some nations, 
 extended to his worship as the father of the terrestrial gods. </p>
 <p align="left">The belief in a resurrection, and in future rewards and punishments.
 </p>
 <p align="left">The necessity of faith in the gods, and under certain very remarkable 
 circumstances, to be hereafter noticed, of repentance and baptism. </p>
 <p align="left">The administration of washings and anointings. </p>
 <p align="left">Traditions, more or less perfect, of the great war in heaven when 
 Lucifer and his angels were cast down upon the earth. </p>
 <p align="left">The belief in good and bad angels, ministers of the will of heaven.
 </p>
 <p align="left">A belief in the eternity of matter, and </p>
 <p align="left">The almost universal practice of sacrifice. </p>
 <p align="left">To give strength to the above assertions we shall now appeal to 
 a number of well-known authors. </p>
 <p align="left">The Rev. Mr. Goodsir, in his work on Ethnic Inspiration, writes: 
 "The principles of mythology enable us to discern the true order in which the various 
 erroneous and morbid developments of human belief arose. It proves both that monotheism--the 
 knowledge of the true God, preceded the various forms of polytheism, and especially 
 the worship of the heavenly bodies; and that the worship of dead men preceded other 
 forms of false or idolatrous worship; and the same facts which show that the worship 
 of dead men was the first step in false religion, prove at the same time the original 
 grafting of this on the belief of a heavenly Creator and Father. Were there no other 
 than the single case of Egypt, as explained from its language, hieroglyphics and 
 monuments, by Mr. Os-born, it would place the matter beyond all doubt, so clear 
 and well-supported is that case. Adam and Eve, Noah and Tamer, Ham, Mizraim[<a name="text7" href="#foot7">7</a>] 
 and Phut were all deified there, while the supreme God was incontrovertibly known; 
 and the sun was only a symbol and the supposed abode of Adam. There is reason to 
 believe that the state of things in Chaldea and Babylon was substantially the same 
 as this." </p>
 <p align="left">To this we may append the remark that the Egyptians appear to have 
 recognized the partial truth that there be "that are called gods, whether in heaven 
 or on earth, as there be gods many and lords many," but were ignorant of the corollary, 
 "but to us there is but one God the Father." (1 Corinthians, viii, v. 5, 6.) </p>
 <p align="left">It must be evident from the light thown on the early history of 
 the world, more especially of Egypt, by the Book of Abraham, that under the almost 
 universally existing form of patriarchal government that "the fathers" were not 
 only High Priests unto God by right of their "fatherhood," but also the kings of 
 the earth by that same right,[<a name="text8" href="#foot8">8</a>] and it was 0ne 
 of the easiest things in the world for the descendants of these men, who ruled by 
 right divine, to not only reverence them as ministers of heaven's will in all things, 
 temporal and spiritual, but also to deify and afterwards worship them. Indeed in 
 the case of most of these holy patriarchs it was but a very small step in advance 
 of their true position in relation to the sons of men; for "He called them Gods 
 unto whom the word of God came, and the scriptures cannot be broken." (John, x, 
 35.) </p>
 <p align="left">We next appeal to Mr. Osborn, author of "The Religions of the World." 
 In writing of the Egyptian mythology, he states: "This most ancient mythology, as 
 described by authors who lived before the Christian era, and as set forth on the 
 walls of the temples in which its ritual or worship was performed, was taught to 
 the initiated and concealed from the vulgar, that God created all things at the 
 first by the primary emanation from himself, his firstborn, who was the author and 
 giver of all knowledge in heaven and on earth, being at the same time the wisdom 
 and the word of God. The birth of this all-powerful being, his manifestation as 
 an infant, his nurture and education through all the succeeding periods of childhood 
 and of boyhood, constituted the grand mystery of the entire system." So convinced 
 were the priests of this people of the coming of a Son of God, that they had chambers 
 prepared in their temples for his nativity. </p>
 <p align="left">Another quotation from Mr. Osborn will, we trust, make the matter 
 yet clearer to our readers. He says: "The founders of the nation knew not only of 
 Ham and Mizriam, but of various men and women contemporary with, them, even of our 
 first parents, Adam and Eve, as well as of our second progenitors, Noah and his 
 wife Tamer. Adam has thus been handed down to us as Athom, the guide or governor 
 of the sun; Eve <i>as </i>Hathor, who presided over the moon; Noah as Nuh, who presided 
 over the Nile; while Ham, Mizraim, Phut, Neveth, or Neith, the wife of Ham, and 
 others, occupied singular and sometimes multiform positions and offices in the Egyptian 
 Pantheon."[<a name="text9" href="#foot9">9</a>] </p>
 <p align="left">We will now leave modern writers, and draw attention to that wonderful 
 papyrus, the Ancient Egyptian Ritual or Book of the Dead, and from its hieroglyphics 
 show the relation in which Adam stood in their mythology, reminding our readers 
 that the abode of the great father of humanity was supposed by them to be the sun, 
 and that the chief seat of his worship was at Heliopolis, the city of the sun, the 
 On of the Scriptures, Aseniath, a daughter of one of whose priests was married to 
 Joseph, the son of Jacob. </p>
 <p align="left">Our extracts are necessarily brief, and simply intended to prove 
 the trustworthiness of the quotations already made. </p>
 <p align="left">In the fifteenth chapter it is written : </p>
 <p align="left">"The praise of Athom[<a name="text10" href="#foot10">10</a>] when 
 he sets from the land of life, saith the Osir,[<a name="text11" href="#foot11">11</a>]
 </p>
 <p align="left">" Glory be to Athom, setting from the gate of life, </p>
 <p align="left">"When his colors glow in the western gate of the horizon, </p>
 <p align="left">"Hail to thee setting from the land of life, </p>
 <p align="left">"Thou father of the Gods." </p>
 <p align="left">Again, (chapter xvii,) Adam<i> </i>is represented as saying: </p>
 <p align="left">"I am the great God, creating myself; </p>
 <p align="left">"I am the great Phoenix which is in On; </p>
 <p align="left">"I am the creator of beings and existences." </p>
 <p align="left">In another place it proclaims: </p>
 <p align="left">"Glory be to thee, O Sun; glory be to thee, O Athom, </p>
 <p align="left">"When thou goest down, perfect, crowned and glorious." </p>
 <p align="left">Adam is also called "the old man whose palace is at On," the "God 
 alone in the firmament," "Father Athom," "Righteous Athom," and much more. Probably 
 were we better versed in the mysteries of its hieroglyphics and idioms, the translation 
 of this wonderful testimony to the belief of the ancients in the immortality of 
 the soul, which this ritual is, would be yet plainer and more instructive. As it 
 is, much of its imagery is very difficult for modern minds to grasp. </p>
 <p align="left">From the Egyptians we will turn to the Persians, the people next 
 most likely to show traces in their religion of the influence left by the preaching 
 of the Gospel in patriarchal days. Mr. Hyde, in his "Religion of the Ancient Persians," 
 points out how that Magianism, as set forth in its sacred books, taught that the 
 human race sprang from a single pair; that it bore testimony to the occurrence of 
 the flood; that it mentions Noah and his sons; that as far as Abraham is concerned, 
 it declares him to have been its own author; and that it makes mention also of Moses. 
 Moreover, it contains predictions respecting the appearance on earth of a Savior, 
 who would ultimately overthrow the kingdom of darkness and make supreme and universal 
 the kingdom of light and of God. It also taught the existence of good and of bad 
 angels, also a resurrection of the dead. </p>
 <p align="left">The religions of ancient Greece and Rome were, to a very great extent, 
 originally drawn from those of Egypt, Persia and Phoenicia. Many traces of Gospel 
 principles can be found in them, hidden concealed under the mass of filth and abomination 
 that in later ages disgraced the religions of the kingdoms of brass and iron. Still, 
 in all these nations it is admitted that "so far from atheism and godless irreligion 
 being the rule, belief in the Divine, however mistaken, and worship of the Divine, 
 however superstitious, everywhere prevailed." With regard to special Gospel ideas 
 prevailing in all these nations, it has been remarked that "baptism was as completely 
 a portion of the primeval ceremonial worship as was the tenet of immortality and 
 resurrection a portion of the primeval creed." It is also noticeable that all the 
 Greek schools of philosophy taught the doctrine of the eternity of matter, and not 
 only had these races a knowledge of things that occurred in antediluvian days, but 
 in their different, absurd ways they recounted the history of the war in heaven 
 when Lucifer was cast out. Those curious on this point can read their accounts of 
 the war between the Titians and Heaven, and of the giants against Jupiter. </p>
 <p align="left">Late discoveries at Nineveh have demonstrated that the Chaldeans 
 had also a very distinct tradition of this pre-Adamite war, as many particulars 
 relating thereto have been found transcribed on the earthen tiles exhumed from the 
 mounds where that once mighty city is supposed to have stood. These tablets having 
 been translated by Mr. Geo. Smith, of the British Museum, prove to be an account 
 of the war in heaven before the creation of this earth, of the fall of man, of the 
 flood, the building of the tower of Babel, etc. The similarity between the statements 
 on these cuneiform records and the Bible account of the same events is very remarkable 
 and interesting, while at the same time they prove how wide spread in ancient times 
 was the knowledge of God's dealings with humanity. </p>
