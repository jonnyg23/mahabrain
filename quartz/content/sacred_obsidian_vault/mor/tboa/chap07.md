 <p align="center">THE MEANS BY WHICH ABRAHAM WAS TAUGHT ASTRONOMY.--THE ABRAHAMIC 
 SYSTEM OF ASTRONOMY.--FROM THE EARTH TO KOLOB.--THE SYSTEM PROVEN TRUE BY RECENT 
 RESEARCH.--TESTIMONY OR VARIOUS AUTHORS.--ALCYONE.--MR. PETRIE'S TESTIMONY.--ADMISSIONS 
 THAT THE ANCIENTS WERE TAUGHT SCIENTIFIC TRUTHS BY DIVINE REVELATION.</p>
 <p align="left">A BRAHAM tells us that there were three ways by which he received 
 his knowledge of astronomy. </p>
 <p align="left">1st. Through the records handed down to him from the antediluvian 
 patriarchs. </p>
 <p align="left">2d. By the use of the Urim and Thummim, which he received from the 
 Lord in Ur of Chaldea. </p>
 <p align="left">3d. By direct communication with the Almighty, who, face to face, 
 and with His own voice, explained to him the laws that govern His countless creations.
 </p>
 <p align="left">The system of astronomy revealed by God to Abraham is so vast, so 
 grand, so comprehensive, that no uninspired man ever searched out its depths or 
 ascended its heights. Occasionally a patient searcher after truth caught a faint 
 glimmer of its glory, but that was all. But they none learned as Abraham learned, 
 nor did the profoundest astronomers of forty years ago have aught but the most meagre 
 and vain conception of the truths given to the world by Joseph Smith in his inspired 
 translation of Abraham's record. Indeed, the truths there set forth are, today, 
 scarcely recognized by the more conservative schools of astronomy, it is only the 
 more daring minds that accept them, even in part. </p>
 <p align="left">The great truths told by Abraham regarding the starry hosts of heaven 
 are recorded thus: "I saw the stars that they were very great, and that one of them 
 was nearest unto the throne of God; and there were many great ones that were near 
 it; and the Lord said unto me, These are the governing ones: and the name of the 
 great one is Kolob, because it is near unto me, for I am the Lord thy God; I have 
 set this one to govern all those which belong to the same order of that upon which 
 thou standest. And the Lord said unto me, by the Urim and Thummim, that Kolob was 
 after the manner of the Lord, according to its times and seasons in the revolution 
 thereof, that one revolution was a day unto the Lord, after his manner of reckoning, 
 it being one thousand years according to the time appointed unto that whereon thou 
 standest. This is the reckoning of the Lord's time, according to the reckoning of 
 Kolob." </p>
 <p align="left">In other words these great, governing planets control all others 
 in their revolutions, or are the centres around which the others revolve. As the 
 moon revolves around the earth, and the earth with the other primary and secondary 
 planets belonging to this solar system revolve around the sun, so has the sun a 
 centre around which it, with all its earths and moons, revolves, while this grand 
 centre has a governing planet also, a sun or world around which it, with its attendant 
 systems of suns and worlds, revolves, and so on until we come to Kolob, the "nearest 
 to the celestial or the residence of God," which is the grand centre which governs 
 all the suns and systems of suns "which belong to the same order" as our earth and 
 those that move with it. </p>
 <p align="left">Still further than this the Book of Abraham teaches us: </p>
 <p align="left">1st. That Kolob is the greatest of all the stars seen by that patriarch.
 </p>
 <p align="left">That it is so because it is nearest to the celestial, or residence 
 of God. </p>
 <p align="left">That it is nigh unto the throne of God. </p>
 <p align="left">That it governs all the planets which belong to the same order as 
 this earth. </p>
 <p align="left">That it is after the reckoning of the Lord's time. </p>
 <p align="left">That it is after the manner of the Lord according to its times and 
 seasons and the revolutions thereof. </p>
 <p align="left">That one revolution is a day unto the Lord. </p>
 <p align="left">That one day, in Kolob, is equal to a thousand years, according 
 to the measurement of this earth. </p>
 <p align="left">That Kolob signifies first creation. </p>
 <p align="left">That it is the first in government, and last pertaining to the measurement 
 of time. The measurement according to celestial time; which celestial time signifies 
 one day to a cubit. </p>
 <p align="left">2d. That Oliblish stands next to Kolob. </p>
 <p align="left">That it is the next grand governing creation. </p>
 <p align="left">That it is equal to Kolob in its revolution and in its measurement 
 of time. </p>
 <p align="left">That it holds the key of power as pertaining to other planets.
 </p>
 <p align="left">3d. That Enish-go-on-dosh is also a governing planet, which was 
 said, by the ancient Egyptians, to be the sun, and to borrow (receive) its light 
 from Kolob through the medium of Kae-e-vanrash. </p>
 <p align="left">4th. That Kae-e-vanrash is the grand key, or governing power, which 
 governs fifteen other fixed planets or stars, as also the moon (Floeese), the earth 
 and the sun in their annual revolutions. That Kae-e-vanrash receives its power through 
 Kli-flos-is-es or Hah-ko-kau-beam. </p>
 <p align="left">5th. Kli-flos-is-es and </p>
 <p align="left">6th. Hah-ko-kau-beam receive their light from the revolutions of 
 Kolob. </p>
 <p align="left">To summarize: That this solar system is governed by Kae-e-vanrash, 
 which is governed by Kli-flos-is-es or Hah-ko-kau-beam, which are governed by Kolob. 
 Whether Oliblish belongs to the same order of systems as this earth, or simply holds 
 the keys of power-pertaining to other planets, is not so apparent. </p>
 <p align="left">When Joseph Smith enunciated the sublime truths above noticed no 
 such thoughts were prevalent amongst the students of astronomy. The Herschels had 
 some inkling of the facts, but their ideas were crude and undeveloped. It was not 
 until the Book of Abraham had been published in America, and if we mistake not in 
 England also, that Sir Wm. G. Hamilton, of the Dublin University, advanced the idea 
 that our solar system had a centre around which the sun and all its attendant planets 
 moved. To-day the scholars in the most radical school of astronomy will only admit 
 that our system has a centre, and that the probabilities are that that centre has 
 a centre also round which it and all its satellites move. Further than this they 
 cannot go. However, the little they do admit, confirms the mighty truths revealed 
 to Abraham of old and Joseph of today. On the other hand, the followers of the more 
 conservative schools will simply acknowledge that our solar system has a proper 
 motion of its own, independent of its relative or apparent motions with regard to 
 other stars. They admit that "relative to the general mass of stars, our sun is 
 moving in the direction of the constellation of Hercules." They have come to this 
 conclusion, because they find that the stars in that part of the heavens are continually 
 growing brighter, (thus showing they are coming nearer,) whilst those in exactly 
 the </p>
 <p align="left">opposite direction are as continually growing more dim. They have 
 also discovered that "there are in the heavens several cases of widely extended 
 groups of stars, having a common proper motion entirely different from that of She 
 stars around and among them. Such groups they say "must form connected systems,"[<a name="text1" href="#foot1">1</a>] 
 or in other words, are all controlled by one and the same governing planet. It is 
 also admitted that "the stars in all parts of the heavens move in all directions 
 with all sorts of velocities;[<a href="#foot2" name="text2">2</a>] but they claim 
 that the distances of the stars from the earth are so immense, and so short a period 
 of time has elapsed since they first began to notice these movements, that they 
 cannot with certainty say whether they are moving in circles or straight lines, 
 it is only by analogy that they reason that they are moving around a centre. So 
 little are some of these observers willing to admit, that Prof. Newcomb simply allows 
 that "as our sun is merely one of the stars, and rather a small one too, it may 
 have a proper motion as well as other stars." The Smithsonian report for 1871, speaking 
 of Herschel, says: "The world can afford to wait. Astronomy advances. It may be, 
 in the distant future, that the mysterious centre around which our sun and his worlds 
 revolve, may be detected and afford a solution for other mysteries as well as these. 
 The greatest astronomer is equipped for no more than a Sabbath-day's journey." Another 
 writer remarks, "Madler attempted to show, from an examination of the proper motions 
 of the stars, that the whole stellar universe was revolving around Alcyone, of the 
 Pleiades (or 'seven stars') as a centre--a theory, the grandeur of which led to 
 its wide diffusion in popular writing." Mr. Wm. Petrie, of London, writing with 
 regard to this same star says: "Alcyone, a primeval name of the star, means <i>the 
 centre, </i>and has quite recently been discovered to be really the centre around 
 which even our whole solar system, amongst others, revolves." </p>
 <p align="left">Short as is this last quotation, it testifies to three things confirmatory 
 of the divine inspiration that gave to the world the Book of Abraham. </p>
 <p align="left">1st. That this solar system has a central or governing sun or planet.
 </p>
 <p align="left">2d. That this fact was known to the ancients, who gave to this particular 
 star the name of <i>the centre.</i> </p>
 <p align="left">3d. That in modern times this truth has only been "quite recently 
 discovered." That is to say; Joseph Smith could not have learned it from living 
 men or modern books, but only through the revelations of God. </p>
 <p align="left">And here let us observe that the word planet, as given by Joseph 
 Smith to the suns, in common parlance called fixed stars, is scientifically correct, 
 as a planet is a world that moves or wanders through space, and the common nomenclature 
 of fixed stars is untruthful and scientifically incorrect, as none are absolutely 
 at a standstill or fixed immovably in one place. </p>
 <p align="left">Elder Joseph L. Barfoot affords us the following additional particulars 
 with regard to the revolution of the solar system around Alcyone. He states: "The 
 entire march of our sun and its system around its centre is 25,868 years. (The period 
 of the precession of the equinoxes.) I believe this to be the period of the solar 
 orbit, and that there is some relation to this period and the sacred cubit (25.025) 
 which may yet be discovered. The change of 50.1" per annum in the appearance of 
 the stars as seen from the earth results from the orbital motion around Kolob or 
 some other large body. This would be a degree in seventy-two years. Of course the 
 orbit would be immense; the Lord evidently gave the Prophet Joseph an insight into 
 the order of this grand eternal round, which I think is really pictured in the Hypocephalus.
 </p>
 <p align="left">"The earth rotates on its axis, and moves in its orbit by the power 
 imparted to its mass by the solar forces; the deflective force from the line of 
 the sun's motion, produced by the sun's rotation on its axis, and its progression 
 around the centre of momentum of the system to which it belongs. And, since neither 
 the earth, nor any other body of matter, has power without motion, so, in the sun's 
 great power, we have evidence of its great progressive motion. The rotation of the 
 sun of more than 6,500 feet per second would demand a velocity of progression of 
 over 26,000 feet per second. Herschel, by observation, was led to conclude that 
 'the sun somehow moved towards Hercules with the velocity of the earth, or 100,000 
 feet per second,' and to infer that the sun actually describes 'a great orbit around 
 some undiscriminated centre.' Sir R. Phillips analogically estimated the size of 
 this orbit, and announced that with equal centripetal and centrifugal force, it 
 would require an orbit of 162,885 millions of miles, performed in exactly 25,868 
 years, the period of the precession of the equinoxes. </p>
 <p align="left">"And as the earth and the other planets of this system rotate by 
 reason of the central solar motion, and turn on their axis by being deflected from 
 a right line in their respective orbits, Philips has shown that the sun and all 
 other planets rotate, as a result of the operation of the same law of motion, and 
 the fact that its satellites move in elliptical (egg-shaped, to be exact) orbits 
 shows that the solar centre is advancing. </p>
 <p align="left">"That this earth is part of a system that suffers no permanent change, 
 is seen in the unvarying order of the eclipses, which return in periods of eighteen 
 years and eleven days, if there are four leap years, and in eighteen years and ten 
 days, if there are five leap years in the period. And although astronomy does not 
 yet recognize the different orders of planets alluded to in the Book of Abraham, 
 the teachings of science are all tending to show that there are great governing, 
 central forces and periodic cycles." </p>
 <p align="left">Having thus shown that present research and investigation are proving 
 the astronomical truths first given to this generation by that unlearned but heaven-inspired 
 man, the Prophet Joseph Smith, we have next to show that the Egyptians were familiar 
 with them, and that they learned them through the teachings of Abraham. To have 
 done this some fifteen or twenty years ago would have been next to an impossibility; 
 but to-day, through the researches of various talented and earnest men, it can be 
 demonstrated with comparative ease. </p>
 <p align="left">But before we attempt to prove that Abraham was actually the instrument 
 used of God to instruct the Egyptians in the mysteries of the starry worlds, we 
 will present a few extracts, from various writers, to manifest that even the scientific 
 world is beginning to admit that the Egyptians obtained their knowledge of astronomy 
 through divine agency or revelation, as it was entirely out of their power in those 
 early postdiluvian days to make such stupendous advances in this science with the 
 instruments and learning then at their disposal, without they received such aid 
 from records, etc., of antediluvian times. </p>
 <p align="left">Rev. Mr. Mackay, referring to some of the astronomical truths known 
 to the ancient inhabitants of the land of the Pharaohs, states that he believes 
 they were <i>"revealed </i>to man, ages and generations before science had any existence," 
 and strange to say, the truths to which this gentleman refers have a direct relation 
 to those contained in the Book of Abraham. Mr. Wm. Osborn, in a sketch of the history 
 of ancient Egypt, remarks: "According to Moses, moreover, the age that produced 
 by far the most remarkable of those monuments (the pyramids) was one in which the 
 Almighty had frequent and familiar intercourse with man, as in the case of the patriarchs, 
 Abraham, Melchizedek and Job; while the monument itself evinces innumerable evidences 
 of a knowledge and wisdom to which unaided humanity has <i>nowhere ever attained</i>."</p>
 <p align="left">Rev. Mr. Goodsir, from the demonstration of facts akin to the foregoing, 
 remarks: "The conclusion that some men in primeval times were taught by God, for 
 important religious and moral purposes, scientific truths which modern men of science 
 are only now discovering, is maintained on the strength of two lines of evidence--first, 
 the freedom of scripture rightly interpreted from scientific error, and from the 
 religious and moral errors witnessed among the pagans as the result of ignorance 
 and errors in science: and second, the possession by primeval man of such scientific 
 knowledge <i>as we are only now reaching, </i>as demonstrated by the great pyramid. 
 Certain things render it extremely probable that this knowledge was imparted to 
 the Ethnics [the gentiles] (who employed it in constructing the great pyramid) by
 <i>servants of God, whom He had taught; </i>and though ultimately corrupted and 
 obscured by the pagans, still it is highly probable that, evincing its truth even 
 from the midst of enveloping error, this scientific knowledge continued to stimulate 
 the Egyptian, and afterwards the Greek, mind to scientific inquiry. * * * For as 
 there is the clearest evidence that a revelation of religious truth existed in primeval 
 times, and continued to benefit men, even when it became more or less corrupted, 
 so is there as clear evidence that men were primevally instructed in the most important 
 cosmologic and scientific truths. * * * The extreme probability is that a true scientific 
 conception of the Kosmos in general would be at first conveyed to man directly by 
 God, to guard his intelligent and highly-favored child from nature worship." </p>
 <p align="left">That God did use Abraham, as stated in his book, to convey astronomical 
 knowledge to the Egyptians, is, we think, fully demonstrated by the following: Josephus 
 (book 1, chapter viii,) states that Abraham "communicated to them (the Egyptians) 
 arithmetic, and delivered to them the science of astronomy, for before Abraham came 
 into Egypt they were unacquainted with those parts of learning, for that science 
 came by the Chaldeans into Egypt, and from them to the Greeks also." </p>
 <p align="left">This is very strong corroborative testimony, but modern research 
 actually claims to have discovered the year in which Abraham did this. The British 
 text book already referred to, entitled "Facts and Dates," published in 1870 by 
 the well-known firm of Wm. Blackwood &amp; Sons, of Edinburgh (we are particular in 
 giving details, to show that it proceeds from a reliable and highly respectable 
 firm), in its history of ancient Egypt, gives the following: </p>
 <p align="left">"B.C. 1980. Abraham teaches the king of Egypt the true chronology, 
 after which the inscriptions bear the name of the year and month." </p>
 <p align="left">So far as the actual year is concerned, we deem it a matter of minor 
 importance, so that the fact is acknowledged, and the truth of modern revelation 
 vindicated. </p>
