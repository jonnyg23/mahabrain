 <p>WHEN a woman sees that her lover is fatigued by constant congress, without having his desire satisfied, she should, with his permission, lay him down upon his back, and give him assistance by acting his part. She may also do this to satisfy the curiosity of her lover, or her own desire of novelty.</p> 
 <p>There are two ways of doing this, the first is when during congress she turns round, and gets on the top of her lover, in such a manner as to continue the congress, without obstructing the pleasure of it; and the other is when she acts the man's part from the beginning. At such a time, with flowers in her hair hanging loose, and her smiles broken by hard breathings, she should press upon her lover's bosom with her own breasts, and lowering her head frequently, should do in return the same actions which he used to do before, returning his blows and chaffing him, should say, 'I was laid down by you, and fatigued with hard congress, I shall now therefore lay you down in return.' She should then again manifest her own bashfulness, her fatigue, and her desire of stopping the congress. In this way she should do the work of a man, which we shall presently relate.</p> 
 <p>Whatever is done by a man for giving pleasure to a woman is called the work of a man, and is as follows:</p> 
 <p>While the woman is lying on his bed, and is as it were abstracted by his conversation, he should loosen the knot of her undergarments, and when she begins to dispute with him, he should overwhelm her with kisses. Then when his lingam is erect he should touch her with his hands in various places, and gently manipulate various parts of the body. If the woman is bashful, and if it is the first time that they have come together, the man should place his hands between her thighs, which she would probably keep close together, and if she is a very young girl, he should first get his hands upon her breasts, which she would probably cover with her own hands, and under her armpits and on her neck. If however she is a seasoned woman, he should do whatever is agreeable either to him or to her, and whatever is fitting for the occasion. After this he should take hold of her hair, and hold her chin in his fingers for the purpose of kissing her. On this, if she is a young girl, she will become bashful and close her eyes. Anyhow he should gather from the action of the woman what things would be pleasing to her during congress.</p> 
 <p>Here Suvarnanabha says that while a man is doing to the woman what he likes best during congress, he should always make a point of pressing those parts of her body on which she turns her eyes.</p> 
 <p>The signs of the enjoyment and satisfaction of the woman are as follows: her body relaxes, she closes her eyes, she puts aside all bashfulness, and shows increased willingness to unite the two organs as closely together as possible. On the other hand, the signs of her want of enjoyment and of failing to be satisfied are as follows: she shakes her hands, she does not let the man get up, feels dejected, bites the man, kicks him, and continues to go on moving after the man has finished. In such cases the man should rub the yoni of the woman with his hand and fingers (as the elephant rubs anything with his trunk) before engaging in congress, until it is softened, and after that is done he should proceed to put his lingam into her.</p> 
 <p>The acts to be done by the man are:</p><dir>  
 <p>Moving forward<br> Friction or churning<br> Piercing<br> Rubbing<br> Pressing<br> Giving a blow<br> The blow of a boar<br> The blow of a bull<br> The sporting of a sparrow</p></dir>  
 <p>When the organs are brought together properly and directly it is called 'moving the organ forward'.</p> 
 <p>When the lingam is held with the hand, and turned all round in the yoni, it is called 'churning'.</p> 
 <p>When the yoni is lowered, and the upper part of it is struck with the lingam, it is called 'piercing'.</p> 
 <p>When the same thing is done on the lower part of the yoni, it is called 'rubbing'.</p> 
 <p>When the yoni is pressed by the lingam for a long time, it is called 'pressing'.</p> 
 <p>When the lingam is removed to some distance from the yoni, and then forcibly strikes it, it is called 'giving a blow'.</p> 
 <p>When only one part of the yoni is rubbed with the lingam, it is called the 'blow of a boar'.</p> 
 <p>When both sides of the yoni are rubbed in this way, it is called the 'blow of a bull'.</p> 
 <p>When the lingam is in the yoni, and moved up and down frequently, and without being taken out, it is called the 'sporting of a sparrow'. This takes place at the end of congress.</p> 
 <p>When a woman acts the part of a man, she has the following things to do in addition to the nine given above:</p><dir>  
 <p>The pair of tongs<br> The top<br> The swing</p></dir>  
 <p>When the woman holds the lingam in her yoni, draws it in, presses it, and keeps it thus in her for a long time, it is called the 'pair of tongs'.</p> 
 <p>When, while engaged in congress, she turns round like a wheel, it is called the 'top'. This is learnt by practice only.</p> 
 <p>When, on such an occasion, the man lifts up the middle part of his body, and the woman turns round her middle part, it is called the 'swing'.</p> 
 <p>When the woman is tired, she should place her forehead on that of her lover, and should thus take rest without disturbing the union of the organs, and when the woman has rested herself the man should turn round and begin the congress again.</p> 
 <p>There are also some verses on the subject as follows:</p> 
 <p>'Though a woman is reserved, and keeps her feelings concealed; yet when she gets on the top of a man, she then shows all her love and desire. A man should gather from the actions of the woman of what disposition she is, and in what way she likes to be enjoyed. A woman during her monthly courses, a woman who has been lately confined, and a fat woman should not be made to act the part of a man.'</p>
