 <p>Coming to January 1, the modern and the Roman New Year's Day, we shall 
 find that most of its customs have been anticipated at earlier festivals; the 
 Roman Kalends practices have often been shifted to Christmas, while old Celtic 
 and Teutonic New Year practices have frequently been transferred to the Roman 
 date.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_113">113</a><a name="FNanchor_113"></a></p>
 <p>The observances of New Year's Day mainly rest, as was said in  <a href="crt10.htm#Chapter_VI">VI</a>, on the principle that “a good beginning makes a good ending,” that as 
 the first day is so will the rest be. If you would have plenty to eat during the 
 year, dine lavishly on New Year's Day, if you would be rich see that your 
 pockets are not empty at this critical season, if you would be lucky avoid like 
 poison at this of all times everything of ill omen.</p>
 <p>“On the Borders,” says Mr. W. Henderson, “care is taken that no one enters a 
 house empty-handed on New Year's Day. A visitor must bring in his hand some 
 eatable; he will be doubly welcome if he carries in a hot stoup or plotie. 
 Everybody <a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a> <a name="Page_322"></a>should wear a new dress on New Year's Day, and if its 
 pockets contain money of every description they will be certain not to be empty 
 throughout the year.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-2">16-2</a><a name="Nanchor_16-2"></a> </p>
 <p>The laying of stress on what happens on New Year's Day is by no means 
 peculiarly European. Hindus, for instance, as Mr. Edgar Thurston tells us, “are 
 very particular about catching sight of some auspicious object on the morning of 
 New Year's Day, as the effects of omens seen on that occasion are believed to 
 last throughout the year.” It is thought that a man's whole prosperity depends 
 upon the things that he then happens to fix his eyes upon.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-3">16-3</a><a name="Nanchor_16-3"></a> </p>
 <p>Charms, omens, and good wishes are naturally the most prominent customs of 
 January 1 and its Eve. The New Year in England can hardly be called a 
 popular festival; there is no public holiday and the occasion is more associated 
 with penitential Watch Night services and good resolutions than with rejoicing. 
 But let the reader, if he be in London, pay a visit to Soho at this time, and he 
 will get some idea of what the New Year means to the foreigner. The little 
 restaurants are decorated with gay festoons of all colours and thronged with 
 merrymakers, the shop-windows are crowded with all manner of <i>recherché</i> 
 delicacies; it is the gala season of the year.</p>
 <p>In France January 1 is a far more festal day than Christmas; it is then 
 that presents are given, family gatherings held, and calls paid. In the morning 
 children find their stockings filled with gifts, and then rush off to offer good 
 wishes to their parents. In the afternoon the younger people call upon their 
 older relations, and in the evening all meet for dinner at the home of the head 
 of the family.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-4">16-4</a><a name="Nanchor_16-4"></a> </p>
 <p>In Germany the New Year is a time of great importance. Cards are far more 
 numerous than at Christmas, and “New Year boxes” are given to the tradespeople, 
 while on the Eve (<i>Sylvesterabend</i>) there are dances or parties, the custom 
 of forecasting the future by lead-pouring is practised, and at the stroke of 
 midnight there is a general cry of “Prosit Neu Jahr!”, a drinking of healths, 
 and a shaking of hands.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-5">16-5</a><a name="Nanchor_16-5"></a> </p>
 <p>New Year wishes and “compliments of the season” are <a name="page_323"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 323</font></a> <a name="Page_323"></a>familiar to us all, but in England we have not that custom 
 of paying formal calls which in France is so characteristic of January 1, 
 when not only relations and personal friends, but people whose connection is 
 purely official are expected to visit one another. In devout Brittany the wish 
 exchanged takes a beautiful religious form﻿—“I wish you a good year and Paradise 
 at the end of your days.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-6">16-6</a><a name="Nanchor_16-6"></a> </p>
 <p>New Year calling is by no means confined to France. In the United States it 
 is one of the few traces left by the early Dutch settlers on American manners. 
 The custom is now rapidly falling into disuse,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-7">16-7</a><a name="Nanchor_16-7"></a> but in New York up to the middle of the nineteenth 
 century “New Year's Day was devoted to the universal interchange of visits. 
 Every door was thrown wide open. It was a breach of etiquette to omit any 
 acquaintance in these annual calls, when old friendships were renewed and family 
 differences amicably settled. A hearty welcome was extended even to strangers of 
 presentable appearance.” At that time the day was marked by tremendous eating 
 and drinking, and its visiting customs sometimes developed into wild riot. Young 
 men in barouches would rattle from one house to another all day long. “The 
 ceremony of calling was a burlesque. There was a noisy and hilarious greeting, a 
 glass of wine was swallowed hurriedly, everybody shook hands all round, and the 
 callers dashed out and rushed into the carriage and were driven rapidly to the 
 next house.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-8">16-8</a><a name="Nanchor_16-8"></a> </p>
 <p>The New Year calling to offer good wishes resembles in some respects the 
 widespread custom of “first-footing,” based on the belief that the character of 
 the first visitor on New Year's Day affects the welfare of the household during 
 the year. We have already met with a “first-foot” in the <i>polaznik</i> of the 
 southern Slavs on Christmas Day. It is to be borne in mind that for them, or at 
 all events for the Crivoscian highlanders whose customs are described by Sir 
 Arthur Evans, Christmas is essentially the festival of the New Year: New Year's 
 Day is not spoken of at all, its name and ceremonies being completely absorbed 
 by the feasts of “Great” and “Little” Christmas.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-9">16-9</a><a name="Nanchor_16-9"></a> </p>
 <p>The “first-foot” superstition is found in countries as far apart as <a name="page_324"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 324</font></a> <a name="Page_324"></a>Scotland and Macedonia. Let us begin with some English 
 examples of it. In Shropshire the most important principle is that if luck is to 
 rest on a house the “first-foot” must not be a woman. To provide against such an 
 unlucky accident as that a woman should call first, people often engage a 
 friendly man or boy to pay them an early visit. It is particularly interesting 
 to find a Shropshire parallel to the <i>polaznik's</i> action in going straight 
 to the hearth and striking sparks from the Christmas log,﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_114">114</a><a name="FNanchor_114"></a> when Miss Burne tells us that one old man who used 
 to “let the New Year in” “always entered without knocking or speaking, and 
 silently stirred the fire before he offered any greeting to the family.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-10">16-10</a><a name="Nanchor_16-10"></a> </p>
 <p>In the villages of the Teme valley, Worcestershire and Herefordshire, “in the 
 old climbing-boy days, chimneys used to be swept on New Year's morning, that one 
 of the right sex should be the first to enter; and the young urchins of the 
 neighbourhood went the round of the houses before daylight singing songs, when 
 one of their number would be admitted into the kitchen for good luck all the 
 year.” In 1875 this custom was still practised; and at some of the farmhouses, 
 if washing-day chanced to fall on the first day of the year, it was either put 
 off, or to make sure, before the women could come, the waggoner's lad was called 
 up early that he might be let out and let in again.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-11">16-11</a><a name="Nanchor_16-11"></a> </p>
 <p>The idea of the unluckiness of a woman's being the “first-foot” is 
 extraordinarily widespread; the present writer has met with it in an ordinary 
 London restaurant, where great stress was laid upon a man's opening the place on 
 New Year's morning before the waitresses arrived. A similar belief is found even 
 in far-away China: it is there unlucky on New Year's Day to meet a woman on 
 first going out.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-12">16-12</a><a name="Nanchor_16-12"></a> Can the belief be connected with such ideas about 
 dangerous influences proceeding from women as have been described by Dr. Frazer 
 in Vol. III. of “The Golden Bough,”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-13">16-13</a><a name="Nanchor_16-13"></a> or does it rest merely on a view of woman as the 
 inferior sex? The unluckiness of first meeting a woman is, we may note, not 
 confined to, but merely intensified on New Year's Day; in Shropshire﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-14">16-14</a><a name="Nanchor_16-14"></a> and in Germany﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-15">16-15</a><a name="Nanchor_16-15"></a> it belongs to any ordinary day.</p>
 <p><a name="page_325"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 325</font></a> <a name="Page_325"></a>As to the general attitude towards woman suggested by these 
 superstitions I may quote a striking passage from Miss Jane Harrison's “Themis.” 
 “Woman to primitive man is a thing at once weak and magical, to be oppressed, 
 yet feared. She is charged with powers of child-bearing denied to man, powers 
 only half understood, forces of attraction, but also of danger and repulsion, 
 forces that all over the world seem to fill him with dim terror. The attitude of 
 man to woman, and, though perhaps in a less degree, of woman to man, is still 
 to-day essentially magical.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-16">16-16</a><a name="Nanchor_16-16"></a> </p>
 <p>“First-foot” superstitions flourish in the north of England and in Scotland. 
 In the northern counties a man is often specially retained as “first-foot” or 
 “lucky bird”; in some parts he must be a bachelor, and he is often expected to 
 bring a present with him﻿—a shovelful of coals, or some eatable, or whisky.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-17">16-17</a><a name="Nanchor_16-17"></a> In the East Riding of Yorkshire a boy called the 
 “lucky bird” used to come at dawn on Christmas morning as well as on New Year's 
 Day, and bring a sprig of evergreens﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-18">16-18</a><a name="Nanchor_16-18"></a> ﻿—an offering by now thoroughly familiar to us. In 
 Scotland, especially in Edinburgh, it is customary for domestic servants to 
 invite their sweethearts to be their “first-foots.” The old Scotch families who 
 preserve ancient customs encourage their servants to “first-foot” them, and 
 grandparents like their grandchildren to perform for them the same service.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-19">16-19</a><a name="Nanchor_16-19"></a> In Aberdeenshire it is considered most important 
 that the “first-foot” should not come empty-handed. Formerly he carried spiced 
 ale; now he brings a whisky-bottle. Shortbread, oat-cakes, “sweeties,” or 
 sowens, were also sometimes brought by the “first-foot,” and occasionally the 
 sowens were sprinkled on the doors and windows of the houses visited﻿—a custom 
 strongly suggesting a sacramental significance of some sort.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-20">16-20</a><a name="Nanchor_16-20"></a> </p>
 <p>Before we leave the subject of British “first-footing” we may notice one or 
 two things that have possibly a racial significance. Not only must the 
 “first-foot” be a man or boy, he is often required to be dark-haired; it is 
 unlucky for a fair- or red-haired person to “let in” the New Year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-21">16-21</a><a name="Nanchor_16-21"></a> It has been suggested by Sir John Rhys that this 
 idea rested in the first instance upon <a name="page_326"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 326</font></a> <a name="Page_326"></a>racial antipathy﻿—the natural antagonism of an indigenous 
 dark-haired people to a race of blonde invaders.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-22">16-22</a><a name="Nanchor_16-22"></a> Another curious requirement﻿—in the Isle of Man and 
 Northumberland﻿—is that the “first-foot” shall not be flat-footed: he should be 
 a person with a high-arched instep, a foot that “water runs under.” Sir John 
 Rhys is inclined to connect this also with some racial contrast. He remarks, by 
 way of illustration, that English shoes do not as a rule fit Welsh feet, being 
 made too low in the instep.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-23">16-23</a><a name="Nanchor_16-23"></a> </p>
 <p>Some reference has already been made to Scottish New Year customs. In 
 Scotland, the most Protestant region of Europe, the country in which Puritanism 
 abolished altogether the celebration of Christmas, New Year's Day is a great 
 occasion, and is marked by various interesting usages, its importance being no 
 doubt largely due to the fact that it has not to compete with the Church feast 
 of the Nativity. Nowadays, indeed, the example of Anglicanism is affecting the 
 country to a considerable extent, and Christmas Day is becoming observed in the 
 churches. The New Year, however, is still the national holiday, and 
 January 1 a great day for visiting and feasting, the chief, in fact, of all 
 festivals.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-24">16-24</a><a name="Nanchor_16-24"></a> New Year's Day and its Eve are often called the 
 “Daft Days”; cakes and pastry of all kinds are eaten, healths are drunk, and 
 calls are paid.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-25">16-25</a><a name="Nanchor_16-25"></a> </p>
 <p>In Edinburgh there are striking scenes on New Year's Eve. “Towards evening,” 
 writes an observer, “the thoroughfares become thronged with the youth of the 
 city.... As the midnight hour approaches, drinking of healths becomes frequent, 
 and some are already intoxicated.... The eyes of the immense crowd are ever 
 being turned towards the lighted clock-face of Auld and Faithful Tron 
 [Church], the hour approaches, the hands seem to stand still, but in one second 
 more the hurrahing, the cheering, the hand-shaking, the health-drinking, is all 
 kept up as long as the clock continues to ring out the much-longed-for midnight 
 hour.... The crowds slowly disperse, the much-intoxicated and helpless ones 
 being hustled about a good deal, the police urging them on out of harm's way. 
 The first-footers are off and away, flying in every direction through the city, 
 singing, cheering, and shaking hands with all and sundry.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-26">16-26</a><a name="Nanchor_16-26"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_327"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 327</font></a> <a name="Page_327"></a>One need hardly allude to the gathering of London Scots 
 around St. Paul's to hear the midnight chime and welcome the New Year with the 
 strains of “Auld Lang Syne,” except to say that times have changed and Scotsmen 
 are now lost in the swelling multitude of roysterers of all nationalities.</p>
 <p>Drinking is and was a great feature of the Scottish New Year's Eve. “On the 
 approach of twelve o'clock, a <i>hot pint</i> was prepared﻿—that is, a kettle or 
 flagon full of warm, spiced, and sweetened ale, with an infusion of spirits. 
 When the clock had struck the knell of the departed year, each member of the 
 family drank of this mixture A good health and a happy New Year and many of 
 them to all the rest, with a general hand-shaking.” The elders of the family 
 would then sally out to visit their neighbours, and exchange greetings.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-27">16-27</a><a name="Nanchor_16-27"></a> </p>
 <p>At Biggar in Lanarkshire it was customary to “burn out the old year” with 
 bonfires, while at Burghead in Morayshire a tar-barrel called the “Clavie” was 
 set on fire and carried about the village and the fishing boats. Its embers were 
 scrambled for by the people and carefully kept as charms against witchcraft.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-28">16-28</a><a name="Nanchor_16-28"></a> These fire-customs may be compared with those on 
 Hallowe'en, which, as we have seen, is probably an old New Year's Eve.</p>
 <p>Stewart in his “Popular Superstitions of the Highlands of Scotland” tells how 
 on the last night of the year the Strathdown Highlanders used to bring home 
 great loads of juniper, which on New Year's Day was kindled in the different 
 rooms, all apertures being closed so that the smoke might produce a thorough 
 fumigation. Not only human beings had to stand this, but horses and other 
 animals were treated in the same way to preserve them from harm throughout the 
 year. Moreover, first thing on New Year's morning, everybody, while still in 
 bed, was asperged with a large brush.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-29">16-29</a><a name="Nanchor_16-29"></a> There is a great resemblance here to the Catholic 
 use of incense and holy water in southern Germany and Austria on the 
 <i>Rauchnächte</i> (see also  <a href="crt12.htm#Chapter_VIII">VIII</a>). In Tyrol these nights are Christmas, New Year's, and Epiphany Eves. 
 When night falls the Tyrolese peasant goes with all his household through each 
 room and outhouse, his wife bearing the holy water vessel and the censer. Every 
 corner of the buildings, every animal, <a name="page_328"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 328</font></a> <a name="Page_328"></a>every human being is purified with the sacred smoke and the 
 holy sprinkling, and even the Christmas pie must be hallowed in this way. In 
 Orthodox Greek countries something of the same kind takes place, as we shall 
 see, at the Epiphany. To drive away evil spirits is no doubt the object of all 
 these rites.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-30">16-30</a><a name="Nanchor_16-30"></a> </p>
 <p>The most interesting of Scottish New Year customs, considered as religious 
 survivals, is a practice found in the Highlands on New Year's Eve, and evidently 
 of sacrificial origin. It has been described by several writers, and has various 
 forms. According to one account the hide of the mart or winter cow was wrapped 
 round the head of one of a company of men, who all made off belabouring the hide 
 with switches. The disorderly procession went three times <i>deiseal</i> 
 (according to the course of the sun) round each house in the village, striking 
 the walls and shouting on coming to a door a rhyme demanding admission. On 
 entering, each member of the party was offered refreshments, and their leader 
 gave to the goodman of the house the “breast-stripe” of a sheep, deer, or goat, 
 wrapped round the point of a shinty stick.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-31">16-31</a><a name="Nanchor_16-31"></a> </p>
 <p>We have here another survival of that oft-noted custom of skin-wearing, 
 which, as has been seen, originated apparently in a desire for contact with the 
 sanctity of the sacrificed victim. Further, the “breast-stripe” given to the 
 goodman of each house is evidently meant to convey the hallowed influences to 
 each family. It is an oval strip, and no knife may be used in removing it from 
 the flesh. The head of the house sets fire to it, and it is given to each person 
 in turn to smell. The inhaling of its fumes is a talisman against fairies, 
 witches, and demons. In the island of South Uist, according to a quite recent 
 account, each person seizes hold of it as it burns, making the sign of the 
 cross, if he be a Catholic, in the name of the Trinity, and it is put thrice 
 sun-wise about the heads of those present. If it should be extinguished it is a 
 bad omen for the New Year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-32">16-32</a><a name="Nanchor_16-32"></a> </p>
 <p>The writer of the last account speaks of the “breast-strip” as the 
 “Hogmanay,” and it is just possible that the well-known Hogmanay processions of 
 children on New Year's Eve (in Scotland and elsewhere) may have some connection 
 with the ritual above described. It is customary for the poorer children to <a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 329</font></a> <a name="Page_329"></a>swaddle themselves in a great sheet, doubled up in front so 
 as to form a vast pocket, and then go along the streets in little bands, calling 
 out “Hogmanay” at the doors of the wealthier classes, and expecting a dole of 
 oaten bread. Each child gets a quadrant of oat-cake (sometimes with cheese), and 
 this is called the “Hogmanay.” Here is one of the rhymes they sing:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Get up, goodwife, and shake your 
 feathers,</span><br><span class="i2">And dinna think that we are 
 beggars;</span><br><span class="i2">For we are bairns come out to 
 play,</span><br><span class="i2">Get up and gie's our hogmanay!”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-33">16-33</a><a name="Nanchor_16-33"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>The word <i>Hogmanay</i>﻿—it is found in various forms in the northern 
 English counties as well as in Scotland﻿—has been a puzzle to etymologists. It 
 is used both for the last day of the year and for the gift of the oaten cake or 
 the like; and, as we have seen, it is shouted by the children in their quest. 
 Exactly corresponding to it in sense and use is the French word 
 <i>aguillanneuf</i>, from which it appears to be derived. Although the phonetic 
 difference between this and the Scottish word is great, the Norman form 
 <i>hoguinané</i> is much closer. There is, moreover, a Spanish word 
 <i>aguinaldo</i> (formerly <i>aguilando</i>) = Christmas-box. The popular 
 explanation of the French term as <i>au-guy-l'an-neuf</i> (to the mistletoe the 
 New Year) is now rejected by scholars, and it seems likely that the word is a 
 corruption of the Latin <i>Kalendae</i>.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-34">16-34</a><a name="Nanchor_16-34"></a> </p>
 <p>A few instances of <i>aguillanneuf</i> customs may be given. Here are 
 specimens of rhymes sung by the New Year <i>quêteurs</i>:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Si vous veniez à la dépense,</span><br><span class="i2">À la dépense de chez nous,</span><br><span class="i2">Vous mangeriez de 
 bons choux,</span><br><span class="i2">On vous servirait du rost.</span><br><span class="i6">Hoguinano.</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">Donnez-moi mes hoguignettes</span><br><span class="i2">Dans un panier que voicy.</span><br><span class="i2">Je l'achetai

 <p><a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 330</font></a> <a name="Page_330"></a>Formerly at Matignon and Ploubalay in Brittany on Christmas 
 Eve the boys used to get together, carry big sticks and wallets, and knock at 
 farmhouse doors. When the inmates called out, “Who's there?” they would answer, 
 “The <i>hoguihanneu</i>,” and after singing something they were given a piece of 
 lard. This was put on a pointed stick carried by one of the boys, and was kept 
 for a feast called the <i>bouriho</i>.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-36">16-36</a><a name="Nanchor_16-36"></a> Elsewhere in Brittany poor children went round 
 crying “<i>au guyané</i>,” and were given pieces of lard or salt beef, which 
 they stuck on a long spit.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-37">16-37</a><a name="Nanchor_16-37"></a> In Guernsey the children's quest at the New Year was 
 called <i>oguinane</i>. They chanted the following rhyme:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Oguinâni! Oguinâno!</span><br><span class="i2">Ouvre ta pouque, et pis la recclios.”﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_115">115</a><a name="FNanchor_115"></a>﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-38">16-38</a><a name="Nanchor_16-38"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>Similar processions are common in eastern Europe at the New Year. In some 
 parts of Macedonia on New Year's Eve men or boys go about making a noise with 
 bells. In other districts, early on New Year's morning, lads run about with 
 sticks or clubs, knock people up, cry out good wishes, and expect to be rewarded 
 with something to eat. Elsewhere again they carry green olive- or cornel-boughs, 
 and touch with them everyone they meet.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-39">16-39</a><a name="Nanchor_16-39"></a> We have already considered various similar customs, 
 the noise and knocking being apparently intended to drive away evil spirits, and 
 the green boughs to bring folks into contact with the spirit of growth therein 
 immanent.</p>
 <p>In Roumania on New Year's Eve there is a custom known as the “little plough.” 
 Boys and men go about after dark from house to house, with long greetings, 
 ringing of bells, and cracking of whips. On New Year's morning Roumanians throw 
 handfuls of corn at one another with some appropriate greeting, such as:﻿—</p>

 <p>Generally this greeting is from the young to the old or from the poor to the 
 rich, and a present in return is expected.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-40">16-40</a><a name="Nanchor_16-40"></a> </p>
 <p>In Athens models of war-ships are carried round by waits, who make a 
 collection of money in them. “St. Basil's ships” they are called, and they are 
 supposed to represent the vessel on which St. Basil, whose feast is kept on 
 January 1, sailed from Caesarea.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-41">16-41</a><a name="Nanchor_16-41"></a> It is probable that this is but a Christian gloss on 
 a pagan custom. Possibly there may be here a survival of an old Greek practice 
 of bearing a ship in procession in honour of Dionysus,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-42">16-42</a><a name="Nanchor_16-42"></a> but it is to be noted that similar observances are 
 found at various seasons in countries like Germany and Belgium where no Greek 
 influence can be traced. The custom is widespread, and it has been suggested by 
 Mannhardt that it was originally intended either to promote the success of 
 navigation or to carry evil spirits out to sea.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-43">16-43</a><a name="Nanchor_16-43"></a> </p>
 <p>It is interesting, lastly, to read a mediaeval account of a New Year 
 <i>quête</i> in Rome. “The following,” says the writer, “are common Roman sports 
 at the Kalends of January. On the Eve of the Kalends at a late hour boys arise 
 and carry a shield. One of them wears a mask; they whistle and beat a drum, they 
 go round to the houses, they surround the shield, the drum sounds, and the 
 masked figure whistles. This playing ended, they receive a present from the 
 master of the house, whatever he thinks fit to give. So they do at every house. 
 On that day they eat all kinds of vegetables. And in the morning two of the boys 
 arise, take olive-branches and salt, enter into the houses, and salute the 
 master with the words, Joy and gladness be in the house, so many sons, so many 
 little pigs, so many lambs, and they wish him all good things. And before the 
 sun rises they eat either a piece of honeycomb or something sweet, that the 
 whole year may pass sweetly, without strife and great trouble.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-44">16-44</a><a name="Nanchor_16-44"></a> </p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">Various methods of peering into the future, more or less 
 like <a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 332</font></a> <a name="Page_332"></a>those described at earlier festivals, are practised at the 
 New Year. Especially popular at German New Year's Eve parties is the custom of 
 <i>bleigiessen</i>. “This ceremony consists of boiling specially prepared pieces 
 of lead in a spoon over a candle; each guest takes his spoonful and throws it 
 quickly into the basin of water which is held ready. According to the form which 
 the lead takes so will his future be in the coming year ... ships (which 
 indicate a journey), or hearts (which have, of course, only one meaning), or 
 some other equally significant shape is usually discerned.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-45">16-45</a><a name="Nanchor_16-45"></a> </p>
 <p>In Macedonia St. Basil's Eve (December 31) is a common time for 
 divination: a favourite method is to lay on the hot cinders a pair of 
 wild-olive-leaves to represent a youth and a maid. If the leaves crumple up and 
 draw near each other, it is concluded that the young people love one another 
 dearly, but if they recoil apart the opposite is the case. If they flare up and 
 burn, it is a sign of excessive passion.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-46">16-46</a><a name="Nanchor_16-46"></a> </p>
 <p>In Lithuania on New Year's Eve nine sorts of things﻿—money, cradle, bread, 
 ring, death's head, old man, old woman, ladder, and key﻿—are baked of dough, and 
 laid under nine plates, and every one has three grabs at them. What he gets will 
 fall to his lot during the year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-47">16-47</a><a name="Nanchor_16-47"></a> </p>
 <p>Lastly, in Brittany it is supposed that the wind which prevails on the first 
 twelve days of the year will blow during each of the twelve months, the first 
 day corresponding to January, the second to February, and so on.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-48">16-48</a><a name="Nanchor_16-48"></a> Similar ideas of the prophetic character of 
 Christmastide weather are common in our own and other countries.</p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">Practically all the customs discussed in this chapter have 
 been of the nature of charms; one or two more, practised on New Year's Day or 
 Eve, may be mentioned in conclusion.</p>
 <p>There are curious superstitions about New Year water. At Bromyard in 
 Herefordshire it was the custom, at midnight on New Year's Eve, to rush to the 
 nearest spring to snatch the “cream of the well”﻿—the first pitcherful of 
 water﻿—and with it the prospect of the best luck.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-49">16-49</a><a name="Nanchor_16-49"></a> A Highland practice was to send <a name="page_333"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 333</font></a> <a name="Page_333"></a>some one on the last night of the year to draw a pitcherful 
 of water in silence, and without the vessel touching the ground. The water was 
 drunk on New Year's morning as a charm against witchcraft and the evil eye.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-50">16-50</a><a name="Nanchor_16-50"></a> A similar belief about the luckiness of “new water” 
 exists at Canzano Peligno in the Abruzzi. “On New Year's Eve, the fountain is 
 decked with leaves and bits of coloured stuff, and fires are kindled round it. 
 As soon as it is light, the girls come as usual with their copper pots on their 
 head; but the youths are on this morning guardians of the well, and sell the 
 new water for nuts and fruits﻿—and other sweet things.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-51">16-51</a><a name="Nanchor_16-51"></a> </p>
 <p>In some of the Aegean islands when the family return from church on New 
 Year's Day, the father picks up a stone and leaves it in the yard, with the wish 
 that the New Year may bring with it “as much gold as is the weight of the 
 stone.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-52">16-52</a><a name="Nanchor_16-52"></a> Finally, in Little Russia “corn sheaves are piled 
 upon a table, and in the midst of them is set a large pie. The father of the 
 family takes his seat behind them, and asks his children if they can see him. 
 We cannot see you, they reply. On which he proceeds to express what seems to 
 be a hope that the corn will grow so high in his fields that he may be invisible 
 to his children when he walks there at harvest-time.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_16-53">16-53</a><a name="Nanchor_16-53"></a> </p>
 <p>With a curious and beautiful old carol from South Wales I must bring this 
 chapter to a close. It was formerly sung before dawn on New Year's Day by poor 
 children who carried about a jug of water drawn that morning from the well. With 
 a sprig of box or other evergreen they would sprinkle those they met, wishing 
 them the compliments of the season. To pay their respects to those not abroad at 
 so early an hour, they would serenade them with the following lines, which, 
 while connected with the “new water” tradition, contain much that is of doubtful 
 interpretation, and are a fascinating puzzle for folk-lorists:﻿—</p>
