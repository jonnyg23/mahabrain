 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">The Epiphany.</span></h3>
 <p>Though the Epiphany has ceased to be a popular festival in England, it was 
 once a very high day indeed, and in many parts of Europe it is still attended by 
 folk-customs of great interest.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_116">116</a><a name="FNanchor_116"></a> For the peasant of Tyrol, indeed, it is New Year's 
 Day, the first of January being kept only by the townsfolk and modernized 
 people.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-1">17-1</a><a name="Nanchor_17-1"></a> </p>
 <p>To Englishmen perhaps the best known feature of the secular festival is the 
 Twelfth Cake. Some words of Leigh Hunt's will show what an important place this 
 held in the mid-nineteenth century:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“Christmas goes out in fine style,﻿—with Twelfth Night. It is a finish 
   worthy of the time. Christmas Day was the morning of the season; New Year's 
   Day the middle of it, or noon; Twelfth Night is the night, brilliant with 
   innumerable planets of Twelfth-cakes. The whole island keeps court; nay, all 
   Christendom. All the world are <a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 338</font></a> <a name="Page_338"></a>kings and queens. Everybody is somebody else, and learns 
   at once to laugh at, and to tolerate, characters different from his own, by 
   enacting them. Cakes, characters, forfeits, lights, theatres, merry rooms, 
   little holiday-faces, and, last not least, the painted sugar on the cakes, so 
   bad to eat but so fine to look at, useful because it is perfectly useless 
   except for a sight and a moral﻿—all conspire to throw a giddy splendour over 
   the last night of the season, and to send it to bed in pomp and colours, like 
   a Prince.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-2">17-2</a><a name="Nanchor_17-2"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">For seventeenth-century banqueting customs and the 
 connection of the cake with the “King of the Bean” Herrick may be quoted:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">“Now, now the mirth comes</span><br><span class="i3">With the cake full of plums,</span><br><span class="i2">Where bean's the 
 king of the sport here;</span><br><span class="i3">Besides we must 
 know,</span><br><span class="i3">The pea also</span><br><span class="i2">Must revel 
 as queen in the court here.</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i3">Begin then to choose</span><br><span class="i3">This night as ye use,</span><br><span class="i2">Who shall for the 
 present delight here</span><br><span class="i3">Be a king by the 
 lot,</span><br><span class="i3">And who shall not</span><br><span class="i2">Be 
 Twelfth-day queen for the night here</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i3">Which known, let us make</span><br><span class="i3">Joy-sops with the cake;</span><br><span class="i2">And let not a man then 
 be seen here,</span><br><span class="i3">Who unurg'd will not 
 drink,</span><br><span class="i3">To the base from the brink,</span><br><span class="i2">A health to the king and the queen here.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-3">17-3</a><a name="Nanchor_17-3"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>There are many English references to the custom of electing a Twelfth Day 
 monarch by means of a bean or pea, and this “king” is mentioned in royal 
 accounts as early as the reign of Edward II.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-4">17-4</a><a name="Nanchor_17-4"></a> He appears, however, to have been even more popular in 
 France than in England.</p>
 <p><a name="page_339"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 339</font></a> <a name="Page_339"></a>The method of choosing the Epiphany king is thus described 
 by the sixteenth-century writer, Étienne Pasquier:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“When the cake has been cut into as many portions as there are guests, a 
   small child is put under the table, and is interrogated by the master under 
   the name of Phebé [Phoebus], as if he were a child who in the innocence of his 
   age represented a kind of Apollo's oracle. To this questioning the child 
   answers with a Latin word: <i>Domine</i>. Thereupon the master calls on him to 
   say to whom he shall give the piece of cake which he has in his hand: the 
   child names whoever comes into his head, without respect of persons, until the 
   portion where the bean is given out. He who gets it is reckoned king of the 
   company, although he may be a person of the least importance. This done, 
   everyone eats, drinks, and dances heartily.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-5">17-5</a><a name="Nanchor_17-5"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p>In Berry at the end of the festive repast a cake is brought before the head 
 of the household, and divided into as many portions as there are guests, plus 
 one. The youngest member of the family distributes them. The portion remaining 
 is called <i>la part du bon Dieu</i> and is given to the first person who asks 
 for it. A band of children generally come to claim it, with a leader who sings a 
 little song.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-6">17-6</a><a name="Nanchor_17-6"></a> There was formerly a custom of dressing up a king in 
 full robes. He had a fool to amuse him during the feast, and shots were fired 
 when he drank.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-7">17-7</a><a name="Nanchor_17-7"></a> </p>
 <p>Here is a nineteenth-century account from Lorraine:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“On the Vigil of the Epiphany all the family and the guests assemble round 
   the table, which is illuminated by a lamp hanging above its centre. Lots are 
   cast for the king of the feast, and if the head of anyone present casts no 
   shadow on the wall it is a sign that he will die during the year. Then the 
   king chooses freely his queen: they have the place of honour, and each time 
   they raise their glasses to their mouths cries of The king drinks, the queen 
   drinks! burst forth on all sides.... The next day an enormous cake, divided 
   into equal portions, is distributed to the company by the youngest boy. The 
   first portion is always for <i>le bon Dieu</i>, the second for the Blessed 
   Virgin (these two portions are always given to the first poor person who 
   presents himself); then come those of relations, servants, and visitors. He 
   who finds a bean in his portion is proclaimed king; if it is a lady she 
   chooses her <a name="page_340"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 340</font></a> <a name="Page_340"></a>king, and he invites the company to a banquet on the 
   Sunday following, at which black kings are made by rubbing the face with a 
   burnt cork.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-8">17-8</a><a name="Nanchor_17-8"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p>The use of the <i>gâteau des Rois</i> goes pretty far back. At the monastery 
 of Mont-St.-Michel in the thirteenth century the Epiphany king was chosen from 
 among the monks by means of a number of cakes in one of which a bean was placed. 
 At Matins, High Mass, and Vespers he sat upon a special throne.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-9">17-9</a><a name="Nanchor_17-9"></a> </p>
 <p>It may be added that there is a quaint old story of a curate “who having 
 taken his preparations over evening, when all men cry (as the manner is) <i>the 
 king drinketh</i>, chanting his Masse the next morning, fell asleep in his 
 Memento: and, when he awoke, added with a loud voice, <i>The king 
 drinketh</i>.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-10">17-10</a><a name="Nanchor_17-10"></a> </p>
 <p>One more French “king” custom may be mentioned, though it relates to 
 Christmas Day, not Epiphany. At Salers in the centre of France there were 
 formerly a king and queen whose function was to preside over the festival, sit 
 in a place of honour in church, and go first in the procession. The kingship was 
 not elective, but was sold by auction at the church door, and it is said to have 
 been so much coveted that worthy citizens would sell their heritage in order to 
 purchase it.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-11">17-11</a><a name="Nanchor_17-11"></a> </p>
 <p>It may be remarked that Epiphany kings and cakes similar to the French can be 
 traced in Holland and Germany,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-12">17-12</a><a name="Nanchor_17-12"></a> and that the “King of the Bean” is known in modern 
 Italy, though there he may be an importation from the north.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-13">17-13</a><a name="Nanchor_17-13"></a> </p>
 <p>How is this merry monarch to be accounted for? His resemblance to the king of 
 the <i>Saturnalia</i>, who presided over the fun of the feast in the days of 
 imperial Rome, is certainly striking, but it is impossible to say whether he 
 derives directly from that personage. No doubt his association with the feast of 
 the Three Kings has helped to maintain his rule. As for the bean, it appears to 
 have been a sacred vegetable in ancient times. There is a story about the 
 philosopher Pythagoras, how, when flying before a host of rebels, he came upon a 
 field of beans and refused to pass through it for fear of crushing the plants, 
 thus enabling his pursuers to overtake him. Moreover, the <i>flamen dialis</i> 
 in Rome was forbidden to eat or even name the vegetable, and the <a name="page_341"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 341</font></a> <a name="Page_341"></a>name of the Fabii, a Roman <i>gens</i>, suggests a totem 
 tribe of the bean.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-14">17-14</a><a name="Nanchor_17-14"></a> </p>
 <p>In eastern Europe, though I know of no election of a king, there are New Year 
 customs with cakes, closely resembling some of the French practices described a 
 page or two back. “St. Basil's Cake” on New Year's Eve in Macedonia is a kind of 
 shortbread with a silver coin and a cross of green twigs in it. When all are 
 seated round the table the father and mother take the cake, “and break it into 
 two pieces, which are again subdivided by the head of the family into shares. 
 The first portion is destined for St. Basil, the Holy Virgin, or the patron 
 saint whose icon is in the house. The second stands for the house itself. The 
 third for the cattle and domestic animals belonging thereto. The fourth for the 
 inanimate property, and the rest for each member of the household according to 
 age. Each portion is successively dipped in a cup of wine.” He who finds the 
 cross or the coin in his share of the cake will prosper during the year. The 
 money is considered sacred and is used to buy a votive taper.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-15">17-15</a><a name="Nanchor_17-15"></a> </p>
 <p>In Macedonia when the New Year's supper is over, the table, with the remnants 
 of the feast upon it, is removed to a corner of the room in order that St. Basil 
 may come and partake of the food.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-16">17-16</a><a name="Nanchor_17-16"></a> He appears to have been substituted by the Church 
 for the spirits of the departed, for whom, as we have seen, food is left in the 
 West on All Souls and Christmas Eves. Probably the Macedonian practice of 
 setting aside a portion of the cake for a saint, and the pieces cut in France 
 for <i>le bon Dieu</i> and the Virgin or the three Magi, have a like origin. One 
 may compare them with the Serbian breaking of the <i>kolatch</i> cake in honour 
 of Christ “the Patron Namegiver.” Is it irrelevant, also, to mention here the 
 Greek Church custom, at the preparation of the elements for the Eucharist, of 
 breaking portions of the bread in memory of the Virgin and other saints?</p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">In many countries the Epiphany is a special time for the 
 expulsion of evils. At Brunnen in Switzerland boys go about in procession on 
 Twelfth Night, with torches and lanterns, and make a great noise with horns, 
 bells, whips, &amp;c., in order to <a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 342</font></a> <a name="Page_342"></a>frighten away two wood-spirits. In Labruguière in southern 
 France on the Eve of Twelfth Day the inhabitants rush through the streets, 
 making discordant noises and a huge uproar, with the object of scaring away 
 ghosts and devils.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-17">17-17</a><a name="Nanchor_17-17"></a> </p>
 <p>In parts of the eastern Alps there takes place what is called 
 <i>Berchtenlaufen</i>. Lads, formerly to the number of two or three hundred, 
 rush about in the strangest masks, with cowbells, whips, and all sorts of 
 weapons, and shout wildly.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-18">17-18</a><a name="Nanchor_17-18"></a> In Nuremberg up to the year 1616 on <i>Bergnacht</i> 
 or Epiphany Eve boys and girls used to run about the streets and knock loudly at 
 the doors.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-19">17-19</a><a name="Nanchor_17-19"></a> Such knocking, as we have seen, may well have been 
 intended to drive away spirits from the houses.</p>
 <p>At Eschenloh near Partenkirchen in Upper Bavaria three women used to 
 <i>berchten</i> on that evening. They all had linen bags over their heads, with 
 holes for the mouth and eyes. One carried a chain, another a rake, and the third 
 a broom. Going round to the houses, they knocked on the door with the chain, 
 scraped the ground with the rake, and made a noise of sweeping with the 
 broom.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-20">17-20</a><a name="Nanchor_17-20"></a> The suggestion of a clearing away of evils is here 
 very strong.</p>
 <p>In connection with the <i>Kallikantzaroi</i> mention has already been made of 
 the purification of houses with holy water, performed by Greek priests on the 
 Epiphany. In Roumania, where a similar sprinkling is performed, a curious piece 
 of imitative magic is added﻿—the priest is invited to sit upon the bed, in order 
 that the brooding hen may sit upon her eggs. Moreover there should be maize 
 grains under the mattress; then the hen will lay eggs in abundance.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-21">17-21</a><a name="Nanchor_17-21"></a> </p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">We noted in an earlier chapter the name <i>Berchtentag</i> 
 applied in southern Germany and in Austria to the Epiphany, and we saw also how 
 the mysterious Frau Berchta was specially connected with the day. On the 
 Epiphany and its Eve in the Möllthal in Carinthia a female figure, “the 
 Berchtel,” goes the round of the houses. She is generally dressed in a hide, 
 wears a hideous wooden mask, and hops wildly about, inquiring as to the 
 behaviour of children, and demanding gifts.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-22">17-22</a><a name="Nanchor_17-22"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_343"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 343</font></a> <a name="Page_343"></a>Something of the terrible, as well as the beneficent, 
 belongs to the “Befana,” the Epiphany visitor who to Italian children is the 
 great gift-bringer of the year, the Santa Klaus of the South. “Delightful,” say 
 Countess Martinengo, “as are the treasures she puts in their shoes when 
 satisfied with their behaviour, she is credited with an unpleasantly sharp eye 
 for youthful transgressions.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-23">17-23</a><a name="Nanchor_17-23"></a> Mothers will sometimes warn their children that if 
 they are naughty the Befana will fetch and eat them. To Italian youngsters she 
 is a very real being, and her coming on Epiphany Eve is looked forward to with 
 the greatest anxiety. Though she puts playthings and sweets in the stockings of 
 good children, she has nothing but a birch and coal for those who misbehave 
 themselves.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-24">17-24</a><a name="Nanchor_17-24"></a> </p>
 <p>Formerly at Florence images of the Befana were put up in the windows of 
 houses, and there were processions through the streets, guys being borne about, 
 with a great blowing of trumpets.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-25">17-25</a><a name="Nanchor_17-25"></a> Toy trumpets are still the delight of little boys at 
 the Epiphany in Italy.</p>
 <p>The Befana's name is obviously derived from <i>Epiphania</i>. In Naples the 
 little old woman who fills children's stockings is called “Pasqua Epiphania,”﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_117">117</a><a name="FNanchor_117"></a> the northern contraction not having been 
 acclimatized there.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-26">17-26</a><a name="Nanchor_17-26"></a> </p>
 <p>In Spain as well as Italy the Epiphany is associated with presents for 
 children, but the gift-bringers for little Spaniards are the Three Holy Kings 
 themselves. There is an old Spanish tradition that the Magi go every year to 
 Bethlehem to adore the infant Jesus, and on their way visit children, leaving 
 sweets and toys for them if they have behaved well. On Epiphany Eve the 
 youngsters go early to bed, put out their shoes on the window-sill or balcony to 
 be filled with presents by the Wise Men, and provide a little straw for their 
 horses.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-27">17-27</a><a name="Nanchor_17-27"></a> </p>
 <p>It is, or was, a custom in Madrid to look out for the Kings on Epiphany Eve. 
 Companies of men go out with bells and pots and pans, and make a great noise. 
 There is loud shouting, and torches cast a fantastic light upon the scene. One 
 of the men carries a large ladder, and mounts it to see if the Kings are <a name="page_344"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 344</font></a> <a name="Page_344"></a>coming. Here, perhaps, some devil-scaring rite, resembling 
 those described above, has been half-Christianized.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-28">17-28</a><a name="Nanchor_17-28"></a> </p>
 <p>In Provence, too, there was a custom of going to meet the Magi. In a charming 
 chapter of his Memoirs Mistral tells us how on Epiphany Eve all the children of 
 his countryside used to go out to meet the Kings, bearing cakes for the Magi, 
 dried figs for their pages, and handfuls of hay for their horses. In the glory 
 and colour of the sunset young Mistral thought he saw the splendid train; but 
 soon the gorgeous vision died away, and the children stood gaping alone on the 
 darkening highway﻿—the Kings had passed behind the mountain. After supper the 
 little ones hurried to church, and there in the Chapel of the Nativity beheld 
 the Kings in adoration before the Crib.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-29">17-29</a><a name="Nanchor_17-29"></a> </p>
 <p>At Trest not only did the young people carry baskets or dried fruit, but 
 there were three men dressed as Magi to receive the offerings and accept 
 compliments addressed to them by an orator. In return they presented him with a 
 purse full of counters, upon which he rushed off with the treasure and was 
 pursued by the others in a sort of dance.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-30">17-30</a><a name="Nanchor_17-30"></a> Here again the Magi are evidently mixed up with 
 something that has no relation to Christianity.</p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">We noted in  <a href="crt07.htm#Chapter_IV">IV</a> the elaborate ceremonies connected in Greece with the Blessing of the 
 Waters at the Epiphany, and the custom of diving for a cross. It would seem, as 
 was pointed out, that the latter is an ecclesiastically sanctioned form of a 
 folk-ceremony. This is found in a purer state in Macedonia, where, after Matins 
 on the Epiphany, it is the custom to thrust some one into water, be it sea or 
 river, pond or well. On emerging he has to sprinkle the bystanders.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-31">17-31</a><a name="Nanchor_17-31"></a> The rite may be compared with the drenchings of 
 human beings in order to produce rain described by Dr. Frazer in “The Magic 
 Art.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-32">17-32</a><a name="Nanchor_17-32"></a> </p>
 <p>Another Greek custom combines the purifying powers of Epiphany water with the 
 fertilizing influences of the Christmas log﻿—round Mount Olympos ashes are taken 
 from the hearth where a cedar log has been burning since Christmas, and are 
 baptized in the blessed water of the river. They are then borne <a name="page_345"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 345</font></a> <a name="Page_345"></a>to the vineyards, and thrown at their four corners, and 
 also at the foot of apple- and fig-trees.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-33">17-33</a><a name="Nanchor_17-33"></a> </p>
 <p>This may remind us that in England fruit-trees used to come in for special 
 treatment on the Vigil of the Epiphany. In Devonshire the farmer and his men 
 would go to the orchard with a large jug of cider, and drink the following toast 
 at the foot of one of the best-bearing apple-trees, firing guns in 
 conclusion:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i5">“Here's to thee, old 
 apple-tree,</span><br><span class="i2">Whence thou may'st bud, and whence thou 
 may'st blow!</span><br><span class="i2">And whence thou may'st bear apples 
 enow!</span><br><span class="i6">Hats full! caps full!</span><br><span class="i6">Bushel!﻿—bushel﻿—sacks full,</span><br><span class="i6">And my pockets 
 full too! Huzza!”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-34">17-34</a><a name="Nanchor_17-34"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>In seventeenth-century Somersetshire, according to Aubrey, a piece of toast 
 was put upon the roots.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-35">17-35</a><a name="Nanchor_17-35"></a> According to another account each person in the 
 company used to take a cupful of cider, with roasted apples pressed into it, 
 drink part of the contents, and throw the rest at the tree.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-36">17-36</a><a name="Nanchor_17-36"></a> The custom is described by Herrick as a Christmas 
 Eve ceremony:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Wassail the trees, that they may 
 bear</span><br><span class="i2">You many a plum and many a pear;</span><br><span class="i2">For more or less fruits they will bring,</span><br><span class="i2">As 
 you do give them wassailing.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-37">17-37</a><a name="Nanchor_17-37"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>In Sussex the wassailing (or “worsling”) of fruit-trees took place on 
 Christmas Eve, and was accompanied by a trumpeter blowing on a cow's horn.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-38">17-38</a><a name="Nanchor_17-38"></a> </p>
 <p>The wassailing of the trees may be regarded as either originally an offering 
 to their spirits or﻿—and this seems more probable﻿—as a sacramental act intended 
 to bring fertilizing influences to bear upon them. Customs of a similar 
 character are found in Continental countries during the Christmas season. In 
 Tyrol, for instance, when the Christmas pies are a-making on St. Thomas's Eve, 
 the maids are told to go out-of-doors and put their arms, sticky with paste, 
 round the fruit-trees, in order that they <a name="page_346"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 346</font></a> <a name="Page_346"></a>may bear well next year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-39">17-39</a><a name="Nanchor_17-39"></a> The uses of the ashes of the Christmas log have 
 already been noticed.</p>
 <p>Sometimes, as in the Thurgau, Mecklenburg, Oldenburg, and Tyrol, the trees 
 are beaten to make them bear. On New Year's Eve at Hildesheim people dance and 
 sing around them,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-40">17-40</a><a name="Nanchor_17-40"></a> while the Tyrolese peasant on Christmas Eve will go 
 out to his trees, and, knocking with bent fingers upon them, will bid them wake 
 up and bear.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-41">17-41</a><a name="Nanchor_17-41"></a> There is a Slavonic custom, on the same night, of 
 threatening apple-trees with a hatchet if they do not produce fruit during the 
 year.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-42">17-42</a><a name="Nanchor_17-42"></a> </p>
 <p>Another remarkable agricultural rite was practised on Epiphany Eve in 
 Herefordshire and Gloucestershire. The farmer and his servants would meet in a 
 field sown with wheat, and there light thirteen fires, with one larger than the 
 rest. Round this a circle was formed by the company, and all would drink a glass 
 of cider to the success of the harvest.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_118">118</a><a name="FNanchor_118"></a> This done, they returned to the farm, to feast﻿—in 
 Gloucestershire﻿—on cakes made with caraways, and soaked in cider. The 
 Herefordshire accounts give particulars of a further ceremony. A large cake was 
 provided, with a hole in the middle, and after supper everyone went to the 
 wain-house. The master filled a cup with strong ale, and standing opposite the 
 finest ox, pledged him in a curious toast; the company followed his example with 
 the other oxen, addressing each by name. Afterwards the large cake was put on 
 the horn of the first ox.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-43">17-43</a><a name="Nanchor_17-43"></a> </p>
 <p>It is extremely remarkable, and can scarcely be a mere coincidence, that far 
 away among the southern Slavs, as we saw in  <a href="crt16.htm#Chapter_XII">XII</a>, a Christmas cake with a hole in its centre is likewise put upon the 
 horn of the chief ox. The wassailing of the animals is found there also. On 
 Christmas Day, Sir Arthur <a name="page_347"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 347</font></a> <a name="Page_347"></a>Evans relates, the house-mother “entered the stall set 
 apart for the goats, and having first sprinkled them with corn, took the 
 wine-cup in her hand and said, Good morning, little mother! The Peace of God be 
 on thee! Christ is born; of a truth He is born. May'st thou be healthy. I drink 
 to thee in wine; I give thee a pomegranate; may'st thou meet with all good 
 luck! She then lifted the cup to her lips, took a sup, tossed the pomegranate 
 among the herd, and throwing her arms round the she-goat, whose health she had 
 already drunk, gave it the Peace of God﻿—kissed it, that is, over and over 
 again.” The same ceremony was then performed for the benefit of the sheep and 
 cows, and all the animals were beaten with a leafy olive-branch.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-44">17-44</a><a name="Nanchor_17-44"></a> </p>
 <p>As for the fires, an Irish custom to some extent supplies a parallel. On 
 Epiphany Eve a sieve of oats was set up, “and in it a dozen of candles set 
 round, and in the centre one larger, all lighted.” This was said to be in memory 
 of the Saviour and His apostles, lights of the world.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-45">17-45</a><a name="Nanchor_17-45"></a> Here is an account of a similar custom practised in 
 Co. Leitrim:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“A piece of board is covered with cow-dung, and twelve rushlights are stuck 
   therein. These are sprinkled with ash at the top, to make them light easily, 
   and then set alight, each being named by some one present, and as each dies so 
   will the life of its owner. A ball is then made of the dung, and it is placed 
   over the door of the cowhouse for an increase of cattle. Sometimes mud is 
   used, and the ball placed over the door of the dwelling-house.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-46">17-46</a><a name="Nanchor_17-46"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p>There remains to be considered under Epiphany usages an ancient and very 
 remarkable game played annually on January 6 at Haxey in Lincolnshire. It 
 is known traditionally as “Haxey Hood,” and its centre is a struggle between the 
 men of two villages for the possession of a roll of sacking or leather called 
 the “hood.” Over it preside the “boggans” or “bullocks” of Plough Monday (see p. 
  <a href="crt20.htm#Page_352">352</a>), 
 headed by a figure known as “My Lord,” who is attended by a fool. The 
 proceedings are opened on the village green by a mysterious speech from the 
 fool:﻿—</p>
 <p>“Now, good folks, this is Haxa Hood. We've killed two <a name="page_348"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 348</font></a> <a name="Page_348"></a>bullocks and a half, but the other half we had to leave 
 running about field: we can fetch it if it's wanted. Remember it's﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">Hoose agin hoose, toon agin 
 toon,</span><br><span class="i2">And if you meet a man knock him 
 doon.”</span><br></div></div>
 <p>Then, in an open field, the hoods﻿—there are six of them, one apparently for 
 each of the chief hamlets round﻿—are thrown up and struggled for. “The object is 
 to carry them off the field away from the boggans. If any of these can get hold 
 of them, or even touch them, they have to be given up, and carried back to My 
 Lord. For every one carried off the field the boggans forfeit half-a-crown, 
 which is spent in beer, doubtless by the men of the particular hamlet who have 
 carried off the hood.” The great event of the day is the struggle for the last 
 hood﻿—made of leather﻿—between the men of Haxey and the men of 
 Westwoodside﻿—“that is to say really between the customers of the public-houses 
 there﻿—each party trying to get it to his favourite house. The publican at the 
 successful house stands beer.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-47">17-47</a><a name="Nanchor_17-47"></a> </p>
 <p>Mr. Chambers regards the fool's strange speech as preserving the tradition 
 that the hood is the half of a bullock﻿—the head of a sacrificial victim, and he 
 explains both the Haxey game and also the familiar games of hockey and football 
 as originating in a struggle between the people of two villages to get such a 
 head, with all its fertilizing properties, over their own boundary.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-48">17-48</a><a name="Nanchor_17-48"></a> At Hornchurch in Essex, if we may trust a note given 
 by Hone, an actual boar's head was wrestled for on Christmas Day, and afterwards 
 feasted upon at one of the public-houses by the victor and his friends.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-49">17-49</a><a name="Nanchor_17-49"></a> </p>
 <p>One more feature of the Haxey celebration must be mentioned (it points 
 apparently to a human sacrifice): the fool, the morning after the game, used to 
 be “smoked” over a straw fire. “He was suspended above the fire and swung 
 backwards and forwards over it until almost suffocated; then allowed to drop 
 into the smouldering straw, which was well wetted, and to scramble out as he 
 could.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-50">17-50</a><a name="Nanchor_17-50"></a> </p>
 <p>Returning to the subject of football, I may here condense an <a name="page_349"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 349</font></a> <a name="Page_349"></a>account of a Welsh Christmas custom quoted by Sir Laurence 
 Gomme, in his book “The Village Community,” from the <i>Oswestry Observer</i> of 
 March 2, 1887:﻿—“In South Cardiganshire it seems that about eighty years 
 ago the population, rich and poor, male and female, of opposing parishes, turned 
 out on Christmas Day and indulged in the game of football with such vigour that 
 it became little short of a serious fight.” Both in north and south Wales the 
 custom was found. At one place, Llanwenog near Lampeter, there was a struggle 
 between two parties with different traditions of race. The Bros, supposed to be 
 descendants from Irish people, occupied the high ground of the parish; the 
 Blaenaus, presumably pure-bred Brythons, occupied the lowlands. After morning 
 service on Christmas Day, “the whole of the Bros and Blaenaus, rich and poor, 
 male and female, assembled on the turnpike road which divided the highlands from 
 the lowlands.” The ball was thrown high in the air, “and when it fell Bros and 
 Blaenaus scrambled for its possession.... If the Bros, by hook or by crook, 
 could succeed in taking the ball up the mountain to their hamlet of Rhyddlan 
 they won the day, while the Blaenaus were successful if they got the ball to 
 their end of the parish at New Court.” Many severe kicks were given, and the 
 whole thing was taken so keenly “that a Bro or a Blaenau would as soon lose a 
 cow from his cowhouse as the football from his portion of the parish.” There is 
 plainly more than a mere pastime here; the thing appears to have been originally 
 a struggle between two clans.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-51">17-51</a><a name="Nanchor_17-51"></a> </p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">Anciently the Carnival, with its merrymaking before the 
 austerities of Lent, was held to begin at the Epiphany. This was the case in 
 Tyrol even in the nineteenth century.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-52">17-52</a><a name="Nanchor_17-52"></a> As a rule, however, the Carnival in Roman Catholic 
 countries is restricted to the last three days before Ash Wednesday. The pagan 
 origin of its mummeries and licence is evident, but it is a spring rather than a 
 winter festival, and hardly calls for treatment here.</p>
 <p>The Epiphany is in many places the end of Christmas. In Calvados, Normandy, 
 it is marked by bonfires; red flames mount <a name="page_350"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 350</font></a> <a name="Page_350"></a>skywards, and the peasants join hands, dance, and leap 
 through blinding smoke and cinders, shouting these rude lines:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Àdieu les Rois</span><br><span class="i2">Jusquà douze mois,</span><br><span class="i2">Douze mois

 <p>Another French Epiphany <i>chanson</i>, translated by the Rev. R. L. Gales, 
 is a charming farewell to Christmas:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Noël is leaving us,</span><br><span class="i2">Sad tis to tell,</span><br><span class="i2">But he will come

 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">Post-Epiphany Festivals.</span></h3>
 <p>Though with Twelfth Day the high festival of Christmas generally ends, later 
 dates have sometimes been assigned as the close of the season. At the old 
 English court, for instance, the merrymaking was sometimes carried on until 
 Candlemas, while in some English country places it was customary, even in the 
 late nineteenth century, to leave Christmas decorations up, in houses and 
 churches, till that day.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-55">17-55</a><a name="Nanchor_17-55"></a> The whole time between Christmas and the 
 Presentation in the Temple was thus treated as sacred to the Babyhood of Christ; 
 the withered evergreens would keep alive memories of Christmas joys, even, 
 sometimes, after Septuagesima had struck the note of penitence.</p>
 <p>Before we pass on to a short notice of Candlemas, we may <a name="page_351"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 351</font></a> <a name="Page_351"></a>glance at a few last sparks, so to speak, of the Christmas 
 blaze, and then at the English festivals which marked the resumption of work 
 after the holidays.</p>
 <p>In Sweden Yule is considered to close with the Octave of the Epiphany, 
 January 13, “St. Knut's Day,” the twentieth after Christmas.</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Twentieth day Knut</span><br><span class="i2">Driveth Yule out”</span><br></div></div>
 <p>sing the old folks as the young people dance in a ring round the festive Yule 
 board, which is afterwards robbed of the viands that remain on it, including the 
 Yule boar. On this day a sort of mimic fight used to take place, the master and 
 servants of the house pretending to drive away the guests with axe, broom, 
 knife, spoon, and other implements.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-56">17-56</a><a name="Nanchor_17-56"></a> The name, “St. Knut's Day,” is apparently due to the 
 fact that in the laws of Canute the Great (1017-36) it is commanded that there 
 is to be no fasting from Christmas to the Octave of the Epiphany.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-57">17-57</a><a name="Nanchor_17-57"></a> </p>
 <p>In England the day after the Epiphany was called St. Distaff's or Rock Day 
 (the word Rock is evidently the same as the German <i>Rocken</i> = distaff). It 
 was the day when the women resumed their spinning after the rest and gaiety of 
 Christmas. From a poem of Herrick's it appears that the men in jest tried to 
 burn the women's flax, and the women in return poured water on the men:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Partly work, and partly play</span><br><span class="i2">You must on St. Distaff's day:</span><br><span class="i2">From the plough 
 soon free your team,</span><br><span class="i2">Then come home and fother 
 them;</span><br><span class="i2">If the maids a-spinning go,</span><br><span class="i2">Burn the flax and fire the tow.</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">*       *       *       *       *</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">Bring in pails of water then,</span><br><span class="i2">Let the maids bewash the men;</span><br><span class="i2">Give St. Distaff 
 all the right,</span><br><span class="i2">Then bid Christmas sport good 
 night;</span><br><span class="i2">And next morrow, every one</span><br><span class="i2">To his own vocation.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-58">17-58</a><a name="Nanchor_17-58"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p><a name="page_352"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 352</font></a> <a name="Page_352"></a>A more notable occasion was Plough Monday, the first after 
 Twelfth Day. Men's labour then began again after the holidays.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-59">17-59</a><a name="Nanchor_17-59"></a> We have already seen that it is sometimes associated 
 with the mummers plays. Often, however, its ritual is not developed into actual 
 drama, and the following account from Derbyshire gives a fairly typical 
 description of its customs:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“On Plough Monday the Plough bullocks are occasionally seen; they consist 
   of a number of young men from various farmhouses, who are dressed up in 
   ribbons.... These young men yoke themselves to a plough, which they draw 
   about, preceded by a band of music, from house to house, collecting money. 
   They are accompanied by the Fool and Bessy; the fool being dressed in the skin 
   of a calf, with the tail hanging down behind, and Bessy generally a young man 
   in female attire. The fool carries an inflated bladder tied to the end of a 
   long stick, by way of whip, which he does not fail to apply pretty soundly to 
   the heads and shoulders of his team. When anything is given a cry of 
   Largess! is raised, and a dance performed round the plough. If a refusal to 
   their application for money is made they not unfrequently plough up the 
   pathway, door-stone, or any other portion of the premises they happen to be 
   near.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-60">17-60</a><a name="Nanchor_17-60"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p>By Plough Monday we have passed, it seems probable, from New Year festivals 
 to one that originally celebrated the beginning of spring. Such a feast, 
 apparently, was kept in mid-February when ploughing began at that season; later 
 the advance of agriculture made it possible to shift it forward to early 
 January.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-61">17-61</a><a name="Nanchor_17-61"></a> </p>
 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">Candlemas.</span></h3>
 <p>Nearer to the original date of the spring feast is Candlemas, 
 February 2; though connected with Christmas by its ecclesiastical meaning, 
 it is something of a vernal festival.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-62">17-62</a><a name="Nanchor_17-62"></a> </p>
 <p>The feast of the Purification of the Virgin or Presentation of Christ in the 
 Temple was probably instituted by Pope Liberius at Rome in the fourth century. 
 The ceremonial to which it owes its popular name, Candlemas, is the blessing of 
 candles in church and the procession of the faithful, carrying them lighted in 
 their hands. During the blessing the “Nunc dimittis” is chanted, <a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 353</font></a> <a name="Page_353"></a>with the antiphon “Lumen ad revelationem gentium et gloriam 
 plebis tuae Israel,” the ceremony being thus brought into connection with the 
 “light to lighten the Gentiles” hymned by Symeon. Usener has however shown 
 reason for thinking that the Candlemas procession was not of spontaneous 
 Christian growth, but was inspired by a desire to Christianize a Roman rite, the 
 <i>Amburbale</i>, which took place at the same season and consisted of a 
 procession round the city with lighted candles.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-63">17-63</a><a name="Nanchor_17-63"></a> </p>
 <p>The Candlemas customs of the sixteenth century are thus described by 
 Naogeorgus:</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Then numbers great of Tapers large, both men 
 and women beare</span><br><span class="i2">To Church, being halowed there with 
 pomp, and dreadful words to heare.</span><br><span class="i2">This done, eche man 
 his Candell lightes, where chiefest seemeth hee,</span><br><span class="i2">Whose 
 taper greatest may be seene, and fortunate to bee,</span><br><span class="i2">Whose Candell burneth cleare and brighte; a wondrous force and 
 might</span><br><span class="i2">Doth in these Candells lie, which if at any time 
 they light,</span><br><span class="i2">They sure beleve that neyther storme or 
 tempest dare abide,</span><br><span class="i2">Nor thunder in the skies be heard, 
 nor any devils spide,</span><br><span class="i2">Nor fearefull sprites that walke 
 by night, nor hurts of frost or haile.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-64">17-64</a><a name="Nanchor_17-64"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>Still, in many Roman Catholic regions, the candles blessed in church at the 
 Purification are believed to have marvellous powers. In Brittany, Franche-Comté, 
 and elsewhere, they are preserved and lighted in time of storm or sickness.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-65">17-65</a><a name="Nanchor_17-65"></a> In Tyrol they are lighted on important family 
 occasions such as christenings and funerals, as well as on the approach of a 
 storm﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-66">17-66</a><a name="Nanchor_17-66"></a> ; in Sicily in time of earthquake or when somebody 
 is dying.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-67">17-67</a><a name="Nanchor_17-67"></a> </p>
 <p>In England some use of candles on this festival continued long after the 
 Reformation. In 1628 the Bishop of Durham gave serious offence by sticking up 
 wax candles in his cathedral at the Purification; “the number of all the candles 
 burnt that evening was two hundred and twenty, besides sixteen torches; sixty of 
 <a name="page_354"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 354</font></a> <a name="Page_354"></a>those burning tapers and torches standing upon and near the 
 high Altar.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-68">17-68</a><a name="Nanchor_17-68"></a> Ripon Cathedral, as late as the eighteenth century, 
 was brilliantly illuminated with candles on the Sunday before the festival.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-69">17-69</a><a name="Nanchor_17-69"></a> And, to come to domestic customs, at Lyme Regis in 
 Dorsetshire the person who bought the wood-ashes of a family used to send a 
 present of a large candle at Candlemas. It was lighted at night, and round it 
 there was festive drinking until its going out gave the signal for retirement to 
 rest.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-70">17-70</a><a name="Nanchor_17-70"></a> </p>
 <p>There are other British Candlemas customs connected with fire. In the western 
 isles of Scotland, says an early eighteenth-century writer, “as Candlemas Day 
 comes round, the mistress and servants of each family taking a sheaf of oats, 
 dress it up in woman's apparel, and after putting it in a large basket, beside 
 which a wooden club is placed, they cry three times, Briid is come! Briid is 
 welcome! This they do just before going to bed, and as soon as they rise in the 
 morning, they look among the ashes, expecting to see the impression of Briid's 
 club there, which if they do, they reckon it a true presage of a good crop and 
 prosperous year, and the contrary they take as an ill-omen.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-71">17-71</a><a name="Nanchor_17-71"></a> Sir Laurence Gomme regards this as an illustration 
 of belief in a house-spirit whose residence is the hearth and whose element is 
 the ever-burning sacred flame. He also considers the Lyme Regis custom mentioned 
 above to be a modernized relic of the sacred hearth-fire.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-72">17-72</a><a name="Nanchor_17-72"></a> </p>
 <p>Again, the feast of the Purification was the time to kindle a “brand” 
 preserved from the Christmas log. Herrick's Candlemas lines may be 
 recalled:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Kindle the Christmas brand, and 
 then</span><br><span class="i3">Till sunne-set let it burne;</span><br><span class="i2">Which quencht, then lay it up agen,</span><br><span class="i3">Till 
 Christmas next returne.</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">Part must be kept wherewith to 
 teend</span><br><span class="i3">The Christmas Log next yeare;</span><br><span class="i2">And where tis safely kept, the Fiend</span><br><span class="i3">Can do 
 no mischiefe there.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-73">17-73</a><a name="Nanchor_17-73"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p><a name="page_355"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 355</font></a> <a name="Page_355"></a>Candlemas Eve was the moment for the last farewells to 
 Christmas; Herrick sings:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“End now the White Loafe and the 
 Pye,</span><br><span class="i2">And let all sports with Christmas 
 dye,”</span><br></div></div>
 <p>and</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Down with the Rosemary and 
 Bayes,</span><br><span class="i3">Down with the Misleto;</span><br><span class="i2">Instead of Holly, now up-raise</span><br><span class="i3">The greener Box 
 for show.</span><br></div>
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i2">The Holly hitherto did sway;</span><br><span class="i3">Let Box now domineere</span><br><span class="i2">Until the dancing Easter

 <p>An old Shropshire servant, Miss Burne tells us, was wont, when she took down 
 the holly and ivy on Candlemas Eve, to put snow-drops in their place.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_17-75">17-75</a><a name="Nanchor_17-75"></a> We may see in this replacing of the winter 
 evergreens by the delicate white flowers a hint that by Candlemas the worst of 
 the winter is over and gone; Earth has begun to deck herself with blossoms, and 
 spring, however feebly, has begun. With Candlemas we, like the older English 
 countryfolk, may take our leave of Christmas.</p>
