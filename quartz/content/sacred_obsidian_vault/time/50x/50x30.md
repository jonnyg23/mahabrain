 <p>THERE were sparkles on the window-pane and sparkles in the sky,<br> The moon it sparkled like a star above the world so high,<br> There was star-shine on the ceiling, there was star-shine on the bed,<br> There was star-shine in my eyes, I think, and star-shine in my head.<br> I clambered from my sleep, I did; I flung the window wide,<br> I wanted all that waited in the Christmas Eve outside,<br> I wanted for myself to hear the Christmas people sing,<br> I wanted for myself to hear the Christmas joy-bells ring.<br> And there outside were waiting three grey Shepherds in the snow,<br> (I knew that they were Shepherds, for they all had crooks, you know,)<br> And when they saw me waiting too they sang to me a song--<br> The stars, they caught and whispered it the whole wide sky along.<br> And then the Shepherds went their way and three black camels came,<br> They stayed beneath the window there and waited just the same,<br> And each black camel on his back had brought an Eastern King,<br> And though each King was very great each had a song to sing.<br> They sang it as the Shepherds sang, a little low sweet song,--<br> The white stars caught and whispered it the whole wide sky along;<br> And then the camels went their way, I watched them down the street,<br> The snow lay white and soft and still beneath their silent feet.<br> There was singing in the tree-tops, there was singing in the sky,<br> The moon was singing to the clouds above the world so high,<br> And all the stars were singing too and when I looked below,<br> I saw a little, tiny Child was waiting in the snow.<br> And first I watched him wait there--watched and only waved my hand,<br> For though the song was in my heart I did not understand,<br> Until at last it burst in words, because at last I knew,<br> And then he looked at me and laughed and sang the star-song too.<br> And right across the misty fields I heard the church bells ring,<br> The star-song echoed far and wide for all the world to sing,<br> But still the tiny Child stood there--the Child that once was born--<br> We sang His birthday song--we did--upon His Christmas morn.</p>
