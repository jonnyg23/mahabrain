 <p>Preface A revelation has been made by the Lord concerning heaven and hell, concerning the Last Judgment which has been accomplished, concerning the spiritual sense of the Word; thus has been revealed the way to salvation, and concerning the state of man after death; and this has been done fully and manifestly, so that anyone who understands the Latin language may know. All this was done and published a year ago. But still the church does not care for this. In heaven they wonder very greatly that the church is in such a state that the things which are its very essentials are not even looked into, but are left as matters of no moment-an indication that heavenly things do not occupy their minds at all, and are not seen when revealed. </p>

 <p>(Let all the articles in the four treatises be transcribed in their order.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3.">3.</a></font></span>
 <p>CONCERNING THE LORD The Lord as to the Human was life from Himself (from the Word). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4.">4.</a></font></span>
 <p>The Lord was from eternity (from the Word). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5.">5.</a></font></span>
 <p>The Lord is almighty (from the Word). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6.">6.</a></font></span>
 <p>The Lord became invisible; nevertheless He was in the Human Body; this could not have been from the mother (from the Word). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7.">7.</a></font></span>
 <p>What is this: that the Divine is distinguished into three Persons? Where is this in the Word? </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8.">8.</a></font></span>
 <p>What is this: that the Lord was born from eternity? But that the Divine is one, or one Person, or one Man, this is understood; then that the Divine was from eternity. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9.">9.</a></font></span>
 <p>But they are to be excused who have not known anything concerning the style of the Word - that there is a spiritual sense in every expression. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10.">10.</a></font></span>
 <p>Concerning the mother He also said:      That she was not blessed because she bare Him; but that they are blessed that hear the Word and keep it (Luke 11:27, 28). He said this lest they should attribute to her something Divine because she was the mother. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11.">11.</a></font></span>
 <p>He went out from the Father, and came into the world, and returns to the Father (John 14:27-28). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12.">12.</a></font></span>
 <p>He went out from the Father (John 14:12; 16:5, 10, 16-17, 30; 17:8; also John 10:9; Isaiah 25:9). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13.">13.</a></font></span>
 <p>He came down from heaven (from the Word). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14.">14.</a></font></span>
 <p>WHAT IS BELIEVED It is believed in the Christian world that angels have assumed human bodies, and have thus appeared to men; but they did not assume them, but the eyes of man's spirit were opened, and so they were seen. So did angels appear to Abraham and to the others; so did the horses and chariots of fire appear around Elisha, where it is said, "Open his eyes" (2 Kings 6:17). That the Lord appeared thus, is known; but with the difference that the Lord appeared as to the body which He had in the world; angels, however, as to the bodies which belong to spirits, which are in human form, but not as the Lord was. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="15.">15.</a></font></span>
 <p>So were seen by John the things which are in Revelation. He also says this (Rev. 1:10). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="16.">16.</a></font></span>
 <p>It is known that men are made spiritual through temptations. Much more was this the case with the Lord, because He was God from conception. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="17.">17.</a></font></span>
 <p>Through temptations man becomes spiritual and is conjoined to heaven. But the Lord through temptations conjoined His Human to the Divine Itself which was in Him, and so He became God as to the Human. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="18.">18.</a></font></span>
 <p>Anyone can see that the Soul which was the very Divine could not dwell in an infirm body such as it is from its own nature. The case is different with the bodies of men who from the father are born into evil affections. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="19.">19.</a></font></span>
 <p>All are allotted places in the heavens according to the idea of their faith in respect to the Divine Human of the Lord, and therefore according to their reception of the Lord through truths and goods. (Let the Gentiles be considered, concerning whom . . .) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="20.">20.</a></font></span>
 <p>FROM REASON Through this the Papists have claimed for themselves Divine authority. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="21.">21.</a></font></span>
 <p>The affection itself which is of the love, is from the father; and this is also a man's very life or soul; but the clothing is from the mother. Hence it is manifest of what quality the Lord was, as to the soul, or life - that He was the Divine love. And this could not be together with what was put on from the mother, without casting it off successively, for the mother was born into sins, as is every man. This was the infirm human which He assumed, so as to be able to admit into Himself temptations, and to conquer the hells, and to dispose into order all things in the heavens and the hells; when this was cast off, He united the Human to the Divine, or glorified the Human. It may be known that such as a man is as to affection which is of love, such is the man. Who does not value another according to his affection? </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="22.">22.</a></font></span>
 <p>That the Lord executed a judgment when He was in the world, is plainly evident from many passages in the Word, as from all those in which is named "the day of Jehovah," which is said to be terrible, and which is called "the day of Zebaoth." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="23.">23.</a></font></span>
 <p>FROM ATHANASIUS It is there said that the Divine took to itself the Human. But it is according to the Lord's words that the Divine took to itself the Human, and that the Human took to itself the Divine; for He says, "Believe me that the Father is in Me and I am in the Father." That He said this concerning His Human, is evident from the words that immediately precede, "He that seeth me, seeth the Father," etc. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="24.">24.</a></font></span>
 <p>I can assert, and declare it as certain, that such as is man's idea of faith concerning the Lord, such is the conjunction that he has in heaven. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="25.">25.</a></font></span>
 <p>FROM EXPERIENCE Because it has been granted me to have consociation with angels, to speak with them, and to see the things that are in the heavens, and also to speak with those who have died - with nearly all whom I have known - I wish to tell something concerning it that I have heard on this subject: </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="26.">26.</a></font></span>
 <p>Christians for the most part acknowledge three Gods, and they seek for one or another; only they who are in the affection of spiritual truth acknowledge the Lord alone as God. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="27.">27.</a></font></span>
 <p>They who acknowledge the Father as separate and as the one only God, worship nature, etc. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="28.">28.</a></font></span>
 <p>All the angels from perception acknowledge the Divine. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="29.">29.</a></font></span>
 <p>All who in heart acknowledge the Divine of the Lord in His Human, are received into heaven; and the rest cannot be received; the reasons. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="30.">30.</a></font></span>
 <p>The Gentiles acknowledge when instructed; and therefore they are received; according to the Lord's words, "They shall come from the east and the west." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="31.">31.</a></font></span>
 <p>Mary acknowledged Him for her God and her Lord; this was heard with the living voice. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="32.">32.</a></font></span>
 <p>The Papists turned themselves away, and were not able to answer anything, when it was said that no other is meant for the Father than the Lord's Divine. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="33.">33.</a></font></span>
 <p>All infants in heaven know no other Divine. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="34.">34.</a></font></span>
 <p>No one comes into the New Jerusalem, who does not acknowledge the Divine Human of the Lord. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="35.">35.</a></font></span>
 <p>This is meant by the Coming of the Lord in glory. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="36.">36.</a></font></span>
 <p>(Read Deut. 33:8, 9; also Zech. 14:9; Isa. 40:3-12; 25:9. Other passages which agree with these may be introduced from the collected passages.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="37.">37.</a></font></span>
 <p>FROM THE WORD From the Word that God is one; or "Beside me there is no God." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="38.">38.</a></font></span>
 <p>The Lord was conceived of the Divine Itself, which is named Jehovah and the Father. (Let Matt. 1:18-25 and Luke 1:35-37 be introduced.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="39.">39.</a></font></span>
 <p>God Himself came into the world and put on the Human, and made this Divine (John 1:1, 3, 14), namely:      God was the Word, and the Word was made Flesh (John 1:1, 14); thus God was made Flesh, that is, Man. He also was the Creator, for it is said:      The world was made by Him (John 1:10). (See also Isa. 9:6; 7:14; Jer. 23:5, 6; 33:15, 16; Isa. 42:8; Mal. 3:1; Isa. 25:9.) Also, He was from eternity (from the Gospels). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="40.">40.</a></font></span>
 <p>It was His own Divine which assumed the Human, and this was the Divine which He called the Father, and not another Divine. Therefore He says:      He that seeth Me, seeth the Father (John 14:7-11);      He is in the Father and the Father in Him, and that they are One (John 10:30, 38) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="41.">41.</a></font></span>
 <p>He glorified His Human from the Divine in Himself. (See Index Biblicus, s. v. "to glorify.") </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="42.">42.</a></font></span>
 <p>He no longer acknowledged the mother, nor David (let passages be quoted), and so He was not his son. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="43.">43.</a></font></span>
 <p>Wherefore the Divine Human is to be approached and worshiped from faith and love. (Let passages be introduced from New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="44.">44.</a></font></span>
 <p>They saw the Lord in Human form; and He was called Jehovah by Abraham (let this also be brought in). This was confirmed by the Lord, when He said that He was before Abraham. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="45.">45.</a></font></span>
 <p>He was also seen by the disciples; He was Man before their eyes, and He was also Man when He became invisible (Luke 24:31). Whence this was. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="46.">46.</a></font></span>
 <p>He is omnipresent "all the days" (Matt. 28:20); and in the Holy Supper He is omnipresent as to the Human; and omnipresence is Divine. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="47.">47.</a></font></span>
 <p>He has all authority in the heavens and in earth, as to the Human also. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="48.">48.</a></font></span>
 <p>He is to judge all; to him has been given judgment, also, in the last day. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="49.">49.</a></font></span>
 <p>He was united to His Divine by successive steps, for reasons that will be given below; and He was united [to it] through temptations and victories. Full unition was accomplished by the passion of the cross. (From passages in the Word.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="50.">50.</a></font></span>
 <p>So far as He was united, so far He spoke with Himself; but so far as He was not yet united, so far He spoke as with another. The latter was His state of humiliation, but the former the state of glorification. </p>
