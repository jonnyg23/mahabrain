 <p>And Joseph said unto his father. That this signifies an answer from within, may be seen without explication, for by "Joseph" is meant the internal (n. 6177); for when a man perceives, he then on making inquiry with himself about anything, also answers himself from within. I have also observed that when spirits have made inquiry with me, they received an answer by merely looking into my thought. </p>

 <p>These are my sons, whom God hath given me here. That this signifies that they were from the internal in the natural, is evident from the representation of Joseph, whose sons they were, as being the internal (see n. 6177, 6224); and from the signification of the "land of Egypt," meant by "here," as being the natural mind (n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301), thus the natural. </p>

 <p>And he said, Take them I pray unto me. That this signifies that they should accede to spiritual good, is evident from the signification of "taking them to him," as being that they should accede; and from the representation of Israel to whom they should accede, as being spiritual good (n. 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6254.">6254.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I will bless them. That this signifies a prediction about good and truth, is evident from the signification of "blessing," as being prediction (see above, n. 6230), here about good and truth, which are represented by Manasseh and Ephraim. As "to bless" is a very general expression, it signifies various things; that it signifies also a prediction, both about the good things that will happen, and about the evil, is plain in the following chapter, where Israel foretold to his sons what should befall them; to some, evil things, as to Reuben, Simeon, and Levi; and to some, good things, as to Judah and Joseph. This prediction is called a "blessing" in verse 28 of this chapter: "This is what their father spake of them, and blessed them, everyone according to his blessing he blessed them." That "blessing" denotes prediction, is evident from the words in the first verse of the chapter: "Jacob called his sons, and said, Be ye gathered together, and I will tell you what shall happen to you in the extremity of the days." </p>

 <p>Verses 10-14. And the eyes of Israel were heavy with old age; he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them and embraced them. And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy faces, and lo God hath made me see thy seed also. And Joseph brought them away from his thighs; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand on Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand on Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. And Israel put forth his right hand, and put it upon Ephraim's head, and he was the younger; and his left hand upon Manasseh's head; he put forth his hands crosswise; for Manasseh was the firstborn.  "And the eyes of Israel were heavy," signifies his obscure perception; "with old age," signifies because at the end of the representation; "he could not see," signifies no advertence; "and he brought them near unto him," signifies presence; "and he kissed them," signifies conjunction from the affection of truth; "and embraced them," signifies conjunction from the affection of good; "and Israel said unto Joseph," signifies elevation to the internal; "I had not thought to see thy faces," signifies that he had had no hope of the influx of his love; "and lo God hath made me see thy seed also," signifies that not only was the influx of love perceived, but also the good and truth thence derived; "and Joseph brought them away from his thighs," signifies the good of the will and the truth of the intellectual in the natural from the affection of love on the part of spiritual good; "and he bowed himself with his face to the earth," signifies their humiliation; "and Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand on Israel's left hand," signifies the truth of the intellectual as in the second place; "and Manasseh in his left hand on Israel's right hand," signifies the good of the will in the first place; "and brought them near unto him," signifies adjunction; "and Israel put forth his right hand, and put it upon Ephraim's head," signifies that he accounted truth as being in the first place; "and he was the younger," signifies although it is in the second; "and his left hand upon Manasseh's head," signifies that he accounted good as being in the second place; "he put forth his hands crosswise," signifies thus not according to order; "for Manasseh was the firstborn," signifies since indeed good is in the prior place. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6256.">6256.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the eyes of Israel were heavy. That this signifies his obscure perception, is evident from the signification of "eyes," as being the intellectual sight (see n. 2701, 4403-4421, 4083, 4086, 4339), as also "seeing" (n. 6249); from the representation of Israel, as being spiritual good in the natural (as above, n. 6253); and from the signification of "being heavy," when said of the eyes, as being what is obscure, thus obscure perception. That Israel was in obscure perception when he blessed the sons of Joseph, is because he was at the end of the representation; but in general, because that spiritual good which is represented by Israel is in obscure perception; for it is from the natural, where natural light rules, but not heavenly light, in which is the spiritual and celestial good which is from the rational. Such is the external man, which is also called natural. When spiritual good from the natural is mentioned, they are meant who are in this good, namely, they who are of the Lord's spiritual church, and therefore also this church is represented by Israel (see n. 4286). That the spiritual, who are they of that church, are relatively in obscurity, may be seen above (n. 2708, 2715, 2716, 2718, 2831, 2849, 2935, 2937, 3246, 3833, 4402); and being in obscurity, they also put the truth that is of faith in the first place, as here did Israel, in that he set Ephraim before Manasseh. [2] The reason why the spiritual so believe is that they are introduced to good by means of truth (n. 2954), and when they are being introduced, they do not perceive good, because it flows into the affection of truth from within, thus not into perception until they have been regenerated. Hence also it is that they call the goods of charity the fruits of faith; and yet those are but little solicitous about fruits who assert that faith alone saves without good works, even in death's last hour, no matter how the man had previously lived. It is evident that this is an obscure perception with respect to good and truth. Nevertheless the case is as follows: those who from principles derived from doctrine set faith before charity, and yet live a life of charity, are they who are of the Lord's spiritual church, and are saved; for in their life they set the good of charity first, but in doctrine the truth of faith. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6257.">6257.</a></font></span>
 <p>With old age. That this signifies because at the end of the representation, is evident from the signification of "old age," as being newness of representation (see n. 3254), thus the end of the former one. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6258.">6258.</a></font></span>
 <p>He could not see. That this signifies no advertence, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being perception (see n. 6249), thus also advertence. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6259.">6259.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he brought them near unto him. That this signifies presence, is evident from the signification of "bringing," as being to make present. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6260.">6260.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he kissed them. That this signifies conjunction from the affection of truth, is evident from the signification of "kissing," as being conjunction from affection (see n. 3573, 3574, 4215, 4353, 5929). That it is from the affection of truth, is because it follows that "he embraced them," by which is signified conjunction from the affection of good, for "embracing" denotes a more interior and therefore a closer affection than "kissing," as is the affection of good compared with the affection of truth. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6261.">6261.</a></font></span>
 <p>And embraced them. That this signifies conjunction from the affection of good, is evident from the signification of "embracing," as being the conjunction of love (n. 4351), thus conjunction from the affection of good (as just above, n. 6260). That "embracing" denotes this affection is very evident from the testifying of love by an embrace, which is an act that flows from this; for every spiritual affection has a gesture in man's body that corresponds to it, and this gesture is representative of the affection. That this is also true of kissing (spoken of just above) is known. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6262.">6262.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Israel said unto Joseph. That this signifies elevation to the internal, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being perception, and also influx (of which above). That it denotes elevation is because the subject treated of in this verse is the influx of love, and thus of good and truth from the internal, which influx is elevation to the internal; for the external cannot be in love toward the internal, except by means of influx and elevation from the internal. For the very love which is felt in the external is of the internal, and because in order to the producing of any effect every acting must have its reacting or reciprocal, and the acting is the cause, and the reacting is the thing caused, therefore reaction is also of action, as the thing caused is of the cause; for all the force in the thing caused is from the cause. This is the case with reaction in every single thing in universal nature. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6263.">6263.</a></font></span>
 <p>I had not thought to see thy faces. That this signifies that he had no hope of the influx of his love, is evident from the signification of "faces," as being the interiors (see n. 358, 2434, 3527, 3573, 4066, 4796, 4798, 5695), thus the affections, for these shine forth chiefly from the face (n. 4796, 5102), hence the "face of God" denotes the Divine love, consequently mercy (n. 5585); and from the signification of "I had not thought," as being that he had had no hope. That it is the influx of love which is signified by "seeing the face," is also plain from what precedes and what follows. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6264.">6264.</a></font></span>
 <p>And lo God hath made me see thy seed also. That this signifies that not only was the influx of love perceived, but also good and truth thence derived, is evident from the representation of Manasseh and Ephraim, who here are the "seed," as being the good of the will and the truth of the intellectual (see n. 5354, 6222); and also from the signification of "seed," as also being good and truth (n. 1610, 2848, 3310, 3373, 3671); and because it is said, "I had not thought to see thy faces, and lo God hath made me see thy seed also," it is signified that not only was the influx of love perceived, but also the good and truth thence derived; for by "seeing the faces" is signified the influx of love (n. 6263). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6265.">6265.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Joseph brought them away from his thighs. That this signifies the good of the will and the truth of the intellectual from the affection of love on the part of spiritual good, is evident from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal celestial (see n. 5869, 5877); from the representation of Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Joseph brought away, as being the good of the will and the truth of the intellectual (n. 5354, 6222); and from the signification of "thighs," as being the affection of love (n. 3021, 4277, 4280, 4575, 5050-5062). That it was "on the part of spiritual good" is because they were brought away from Israel, who is spiritual good (see n. 6253). By these things is signified that the internal celestial removed the good of the will and the truth of the intellectual from spiritual good, that is, from the affection of love thereof, because Israel, by whom is represented spiritual good, had caused this good and truth to approach to himself; besides their being brought to him by Joseph, by whom is represented the internal celestial; for which reason they were brought away, and were afterward brought again by Joseph, as follows. The reason is, that there is in this way an influx of love from the internal celestial through spiritual good into them. For this is according to order, and hence this external ritual had to be rigidly observed when they were to be blessed; for they were then being presented before the Lord, from whom is the prediction here signified by the "blessing" (see n. 6254). Hence then it is that Joseph brought his sons from the thighs of his father, and himself afterward brought them thither. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6266.">6266.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he bowed himself with his face to the earth. That this signifies their humiliation, is evident from the signification of "bowing himself with his face to the earth," as being interior humiliation (see n. 5682); for such bowing is a bodily act that corresponds to humiliation of mind; hence they who adore God from the heart, thus bow themselves. It is said "he bowed himself," because Joseph was in their stead, not then before Israel, but before the Lord, from whom was the blessing by Israel. That this was done by Joseph in their stead, is because such is the case in things spiritual; the good of the will and the truth of the intellectual in the natural cannot from themselves humble themselves before the Lord, but only from the internal by means of influx; for without influx through the internal into the natural, there is nothing of will and understanding therein, and not even anything of life; for the internal is the intermediate through which is life from the Lord therein. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6267.">6267.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand on Israel's left hand. That this signifies the truth of the intellectual as in the second place; and that Manasseh in his left hand on Israel's right hand signifies the good of the will in the first place, is evident from the representation of Ephraim, as being the truth of the intellectual, and from the representation of Manasseh, as being the good of the will (n. 5354, 6222); and from the signification of the "right hand," as being to be in the first place; and of the "left hand," as being to be in the second place; as is manifest from all the usage in life. How the case herein is will be shown in what follows. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6268.">6268.</a></font></span>
 <p>And brought them near unto him. That this signifies adjunction, is evident without explication. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6269.">6269.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Israel put forth his right hand, and put it upon Ephraim's head. That this signifies that he accounted truth as being in the first place, is evident from the signification of "putting forth his right hand," as being to account in the first place (that the "right hand" denotes in the first place, is manifest); and from the representation of Ephraim, as being the intellectual, thus also the truth of faith, for this dwells in man's intellectual part when there is sight there from the light of heaven, thus spiritual sight (see n. 6222). It is set forth in this verse, and also in verses 17-19, that Israel put his right hand on Ephraim's head, and his left hand on Manasseh's head; and by this is signified that he accounted the truth of faith as being in the first place, and the good of charity in the second. The reason was that until he has been regenerated, the spiritual man, who is represented by Israel (n. 4286, 6256), supposes no otherwise; for he has a sensible apprehension of what the truth of faith is, but not what the good of charity is; because the latter flows in by an interior way, but the former, by an exterior way, just as does memory-knowledge. [2] But they who are not being regenerated say absolutely that faith is in the first place, that is to say, that it is the essential of the church, because in this way they can live as they desire, and still say that they have hope of salvation. Hence also at this day charity has so disappeared that the nature of it is known to scarcely anyone, and consequently so has faith, for the one is not possible without the other. If charity were in the first place, and faith in the second, the aspect of the church would be different; for then no others would be called Christians than those who live a life according to the truth of faith, that is, a life of charity; and they would then also know what charity is. Then too they would not make a number of churches by making a distinction among them according to opinions about the truths of faith; but they would say that there is one church, in which are all who are in the good of life, not only those within the region where the churches are, but also those who are outside of it. In this manner the church would be an illustration about such things as belong to the Lord's kingdom; for charity enlightens, and never faith without charity; and the errors that are brought in by means of faith separated would be clearly seen. [3] Hence it is evident how different an aspect the church would have if the good of charity were in the first place, that is, were the essential, and the truth of faith in the second, that is, its formal. The aspect of the church would then be like that of the Ancient Church, which made the church consist in charity, and had no other doctrinals of the church than those of charity: from this they had wisdom from the Lord. The quality of that church is described in these words in Moses:      Jehovah led him about, He instructed him, He guarded him as the pupil of His eye. As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, He took him, He bare him upon His wings; Jehovah alone did lead him, neither was there any strange god with him. He made him ride on the high places of the earth, and fed him with the increase of the fields; He made him suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flint of the rock; butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, and of rams the sons of Bashan, and of he-goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and of the blood of the grape thou drinkest pure wine (Deut. 32:10-14). Wherefore they who were of that church are in heaven, and in all happiness and glory there. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6270.">6270.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he was the younger. That this signifies although it is in the second place, is evident from the signification of the "younger," as being to be in the second place. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6271.">6271.</a></font></span>
 <p>And his left hand upon Manasseh's head. That this signifies that he accounted good as being in the second place, is evident from the signification of "putting his left hand," as being to account in the second place; and from the representation of Manasseh, as being the will, thus also the good of charity. How the case herein is may be seen above (n. 6269). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6272.">6272.</a></font></span>
 <p>He put forth his hands crosswise. That this signifies, thus not according to order, is evident from the signification of "putting forth the hands crosswise," as being not according to order; for thereby he makes the younger the firstborn, and the reverse; consequently the truth of faith prior and higher; and the good of charity posterior and lower; for "birthright" denotes priority and superiority (see n. 3325). It is evident how much evil this introduces into the church; for thereby its people get into such obscurity that they do not know what good is, thus neither what truth is; for good is like flame, and truth like the light from it: if you take away the flame, the light also perishes; and if any light appears, it is like a deceptive light that is not from flame. Hence it is that churches are at variance with one another, and dispute about truth, and one congregation asserts a thing to be true, which another asserts to be false. And what is still worse, when once they have set faith in the prior place in the assemblage of the church, they next begin to separate faith from charity, and to make the latter of comparatively no account, and thus to care nothing for the life, a thing to which man naturally inclines. Hence the church perishes, for it is the life which makes the church with man, but not doctrine without life; thus not confidence, which is eminent faith; for genuine confidence is possible with those only who are in charity, from which is the life of confidence. (Moreover, that the good of charity is actually the firstborn, that is, in the prior place, and that the truth of faith appears to be so, may be seen above, n. 3324, 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576, 3603, 3701, 4243, 4244, 4247, 4337, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930, 4977.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6273.">6273.</a></font></span>
 <p>For Manasseh was the firstborn. That this signifies since indeed good is in the prior place, is evident from the representation of Manasseh, as being the good that is of the will (of which above); and from the signification of "birthright," as being priority and superiority (see n. 3325), thus the "firstborn" is one who is in the prior place. Who cannot see from natural light alone, provided it is enlightened a little, that good is in the prior place, as is also man's will; and that truth is in the posterior place, as is also man's thinking? And also that man's will causes him to think one way and not another, consequently that the good with a man causes this or that to be true; thus that truth is in the second place, and good in the first? Think and reflect whether the truth that is of faith can take root except in good, and whether faith is faith unless it is therein rooted. Hence you may conclude what is primary or essential to the church, that is, to the man in whom the church is. </p>

 <p>Verses 15,16. And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers walked, Abraham and Isaac, the God who feedeth me since I am, unto this day, the Angel who redeemeth me from all evil, bless the boys; and let my name be called in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow unto a multitude in the midst of the earth. "And he blessed Joseph," signifies a prediction with respect to the truth of the intellectual and the good of the will having life from the internal; "and said, The God before whom my fathers walked, Abraham and Isaac," signifies the Divine from which internal good and internal truth had life; "the God who feedeth me," signifies this Divine vivifying the good of spiritual truth from the natural; "since I am, unto this day," signifies continually; "the Angel who redeemeth me from all evil," signifies the Lord's Divine Human, by which is effected deliverance from hell; "bless the boys," signifies give them to have truth and good; "and let my name be called in them," signifies that in them should be the quality of the good of spiritual truth from the natural; "and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac," signifies and the quality of internal good and truth; "and let them grow unto a multitude in the midst of the earth," signifies extension from the inmost. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6275.">6275.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he blessed Joseph. That this signifies a prediction with respect to the truth of the intellectual and the good of the will having life from the internal, is evident from the signification of "blessing," as being prediction (see n. 6230, 6254); and from the representation of Ephraim and Manasseh, who here are "Joseph," as being the truth of the intellectual and the good of the will in the natural, born from the internal (n. 6234, 6249). That by "Joseph" are meant his sons, is evident from the blessing itself, in which it is said, "The Angel who redeemeth me from all evil, bless the boys, and let my name be called in them;" and the reason is that this good and truth in the natural, represented by Manasseh and Ephraim, are the very internal there. The internal and the external are indeed distinct from each other; but in the natural, where they are together, the internal is as in its own adapted form, which form does nothing from itself, but only from the internal within it; thus it is merely acted upon. The case herein is like the efficient in the effect: the efficient and the effect are distinct from each other, yet the efficient is in the effect as in its own adapted form, and through it acts as cause in the sphere where the effect is produced. In man the like is the case with the good and truth in the natural, born from the internal; for the internal clothes itself with such things as belong to the natural, in order that it may be there and lead a life there; but the things with which it clothes itself are nothing but coverings, which of themselves do nothing at all. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6276.">6276.</a></font></span>
 <p>And said, The God before whom my fathers walked, Abraham and Isaac. That this signifies the Divine from which internal good and internal truth had life, is evident from the signification of "God," as being the Divine; from the signification of "walking," as being to live, or to have life (see n. 519, 1794); from the representation of Abraham, as being in the supreme sense the Lord's Divine Itself; and from the representation of Isaac, as being His Divine rational, thus the internal human-for Jacob is the Lord's Divine natural, or His external human (see n. 2011, 3245, 3305, 3439, 4615). But in the representative sense "Abraham" is internal good, and "Isaac" internal truth (n. 3703, 6098, 6185). That these things in the representative sense are signified by "Abraham and Isaac," is because that good and truth which are in the Lord's kingdom proceed from His Divine and Divine Human; and make the Lord Himself to be there; thus He Himself is His kingdom. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6277.">6277.</a></font></span>
 <p>The God who feedeth me. That this signifies this Divine vivifying the good of spiritual truth from the natural, is evident from the signification of "feeding," as being to vivify. That "to feed" is to instruct, (see n. 6044) is because a "pasture" is that which sustains the spiritual life of man (n. 6078); but "feeding" and a "pasture" are there said of a flock, whereas "feeding" is here said of Jacob-that he was sustained with food and the necessaries of life; by which in the internal sense the like is signified; for that which sustains and vivifies the life of the body, in the internal sense signifies that which sustains the spiritual life and vivifies it. That Israel represents spiritual good from the natural, has been shown above (n. 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833); and because this good which Israel represents is the good of truth, therefore the good of spiritual truth is here signified; for in the genuine sense "Israel" is the spiritual church, and the good of this church is the good of truth; because those who belong to this church are instructed about good by means of truth, and when they do according to the truth in which they are instructed, then this truth is called good. This is the good which is called the good of truth, and is represented by Israel. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6278.">6278.</a></font></span>
 <p>Since I am, unto this day. That this signifies continually, is evident from the signification of "today" and "to this day," as being what is perpetual and eternal (see n. 2838, 4304, 6165); here therefore "since I am, unto this day" signifies continually, namely, vivifying, which is "feeding" (n. 6277). </p>

 <p>The Angel who redeemeth me from all evil. That this signifies the Lord's Divine Human by which is effected deliverance from hell, is evident from the signification of "angel," as being the Lord's Divine Human (of which below); from the signification of "redeeming," as being to deliver (of which also below); and from the signification of "evil," as being hell. The reason why "evil" denotes hell is that hell itself is nothing but evil; for whether you say that all in hell are evil, or that hell is evil, it is the same. In the spiritual sense, when "evil" is mentioned, hell is meant, for they who are in the spiritual sense, as are the angels in heaven, think and speak abstractedly from persons, because universally, and therefore to them evil is hell. It is the same with "sin," when thereby is meant the ruling evil, as in Genesis:      Jehovah said unto Cain, If thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee is his desire, and thou shall rule over him (Gen. 4:6, 7); where "sin" denotes hell, which is at hand when a man does evil. The very evil with man is nothing else than hell, for it inflows therefrom, and the man is then a hell in the least form, as also is everyone there. So on the other hand, the very good in man is nothing else than heaven in him; for good flows in through heaven from the Lord; and the man who is in good, is heaven in the smallest image, as also is everyone in heaven. </p>

 <p>That the "redeeming Angel" is the Lord as to the Divine Human, is evident from the fact that by assuming the Human and making it Divine the Lord redeemed man, that is, delivered him from hell; whence the Lord as to His Divine Human is called the "Redeemer." That the Divine Human is called the "Angel" is because the word "angel" means "sent," and the Lord as to the Divine Human is said to be "sent," as is plain from many passages in the Word of the Evangelists. Moreover before the Lord's coming into the world the Divine Human was Jehovah Himself flowing in through heaven when He spoke the Word; for Jehovah was above the heavens, but that which passed from Him through the heavens was at that time the Divine Human; for by the influx of Jehovah into heaven, He set forth a man, and the very Divine thence derived was a Divine man. This then is the Divine Human from eternity, and is what is called "Sent," by which is meant proceeding, and this is the same as "Angel." [2] But as Jehovah by this Divine Human of His, could not flow in any longer with men, because they had so far removed themselves from this Divine, He therefore took on the Human and made it Divine, and thus by influx from this into heaven He could reach even those of the human race who would receive the good of charity and the truth of faith from the Divine Human, which was thus made visible, and could thus deliver them from hell, which could not possibly have been effected in any other way. This deliverance is that which is called "redemption," and the Divine Human Itself, which delivered or redeemed, is what is called the "redeeming Angel." [3] But be it known that in respect to the Divine Human, as well as in respect to the Divine Itself, the Lord is above heaven; for He is the Sun which illumines heaven; thus that heaven is far beneath Him. The Divine Human which is in heaven is the Divine truth which proceeds from Him, which is the light from Him as a sun. In respect to His essence the Lord is not Divine truth, for this is from Him as light from the sun, but He is Divine good itself, one with Jehovah. [4] The Lord's Divine Human is called "Angel" in other places also in the Word, as when He appeared to Moses in the bush, of which it is written in Exodus:      When Moses came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb, the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. Jehovah saw that Moses turned aside to see, therefore God called unto him out of the midst of the bush. And he said further, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (Exod. 3:1, 2, 4, 6); it is the Lord's Divine Human which is here called the "Angel of Jehovah," and it is plainly said that it was Jehovah Himself. That Jehovah was there in the Divine Human may be seen from the fact that the Divine Itself could not appear except through the Divine Human; according to the Lord's words in John: "No one hath ever seen God, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath set Him forth" (John 1:18); and in another place: "Ye have neither ever heard the voice of the Father, nor seen His shape" (John 5:37). [5] Moreover the Lord as to the Divine Human is called the "Angel" where it treats of leading the people into the land of Canaan, of which we read in Exodus:      Behold I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee unto the place which I have prepared. Beware thou of His faces, for He will not bear your transgression, because My name is in the midst of Him (Exod. 23:20, 21, 23);  that the "Angel" in this passage is the Divine Human, is evident from the fact that it is said, "because My name is in the midst of Him," that is, Jehovah Himself is. By "My name" is signified the quality of Jehovah which is in the Divine Human (that the Lord as to the Divine Human is the "name of Jehovah," may be seen above, n. 2628; and that the "name of God" is His quality, as also everything in one complex by means of which God is worshiped, n. 2724, 3006). [6] In Isaiah:      In all their distress He had distress, and the Angel of His faces will deliver them; in His love and in His indulgence He redeemed them, and He took them, and carried them all the days of eternity (Isa. 63:9); that the "Angel of the faces of Jehovah" is the Lord as to the Divine Human, is manifest, for it is said that "He redeemed them." [7] In Malachi:      Behold the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come unto His temple, even the Angel of the covenant whom ye desire; Behold He cometh, saith Jehovah Zebaoth. But who shall endure the day of His coming, and who shall stand when He appeareth? Then shall the meat-offering of Judah and Jerusalem be sweet to Jehovah, as in the days of eternity, and as in former years (Mal. 3:1, 2, 4);  that the "Angel of the covenant" is the Lord as to the Divine Human is very evident, for the subject treated of is His coming; the "offering of Judah and Jerusalem being then sweet to Jehovah" signifies that worship from love and faith in Him will then be sweet. That by "Judah" here is not meant Judah, nor by "Jerusalem" Jerusalem, is clearly evident; for neither then nor afterward was the offering of Judah and Jerusalem sweet. That the "days of eternity" are the states of the Most Ancient Church, which was celestial; and that the "former years" are the states of the Ancient Church, which was spiritual, may be seen above (n. 6239). Moreover by an "angel" in the Word, in the internal sense, is not signified an angel, but something Divine in the Lord (n. 1925, 2319, 2821, 3039, 4085). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6281.">6281.</a></font></span>
 <p>As regards "redeeming," in the proper sense this signifies to restore and appropriate to Himself that which had been His; and it is predicated of slavery, of death, and of evil; when of slavery, they are meant who have been enslaved, in the spiritual sense enslaved by hell; when of death, they are meant who are in condemnation; and when of evil, as here, they are meant who are in hell, for the evil from which the angel redeems is hell (see n. 6279). As the Lord delivered man from these evils by making the Human in Himself Divine, therefore His Divine Human is called in the Word the "Redeemer," as in Isaiah:      I aid thee, saith Jehovah, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel (Isa. 41:14). Again:      Thus hath said Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One (Isa. 49:7, 26). Again:      Jehovah Zebaoth is His name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; the God of the whole earth shall He be called (Isa. 54:5). In these passages, the Divine Itself, which is called "Jehovah," is distinguished from the Divine Human, which is called the "Redeemer the Holy One of Israel." [2] But that it is Jehovah Himself in the Divine Human, is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah:      Thus hath said Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah Zebaoth, I am the first, and I am the last, and besides Me there is no God (Isa. 44:6).      Thus hath said Jehovah thy Redeemer, I am Jehovah thy God, that teacheth thee (Isa. 48:17). Again:      Thou art our Father, for Abraham knoweth us not, and Israel doth not acknowledge us; Thou Jehovah art our Father, our Redeemer; from everlasting is Thy name (Isa. 63:16). In David:      Jehovah who redeemed thy life from the pit (Ps. 103:4).  [3] From these passages also it is plain that by "Jehovah" in the Word no other is meant than the Lord (see n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 3035, 5663); and that "Jehovah the Redeemer" is His Divine Human. Therefore also those who have been redeemed are called the "redeemed of Jehovah" in Isaiah:      Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy salvation cometh; Behold His reward is with Him, and the price of His work before Him. They shall call them, The people of holiness, the redeemed of Jehovah (Isa. 62:11, 12); that it is the Lord from whom they are called the "redeemed of Jehovah," is very clear; for it is said of His coming: "Behold thy salvation cometh; behold His reward is with Him." See besides Isa. 43:1; 52:2, 3; 63:4, 9; Hos. 13:14; Exod. 6:6; 15:13; Job 19:25, where it is evident that "redemption" is predicated of slavery, of death, and of evil. </p>

 <p>Bless the boys. That this signifies give them to have truth and good, is evident from the signification of "blessing," as being to endow with truth and good; for in the spiritual sense "blessing" involves nothing else (see n. 1420, 1422, 4981); and from the representation of Ephraim and Manasseh, who here are the "boys," as being the intellectual and the will of the church, to which truth and good should be given: to the intellectual, truth; and to the will, good. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6283.">6283.</a></font></span>
 <p>And let my name be called in them. That this signifies that in them should be the quality of the good of spiritual truth from the natural, is evident from the signification of the "name being called in" anyone, as being his quality in him (see n. 1754, 1896, 2009, 3421); and from the representation of Israel, as being the good of spiritual truth from the natural (of which above, n. 6277); and because the quality of Israel was in them, therefore they also were received among the rest of the sons of Jacob, and were made tribes, one of Manasseh and the other of Ephraim, and with them the twelve tribes were made up, when the tribe of Levi, being made the priesthood, was not numbered among the tribes that obtained inheritance by lot (see Joshua and also Ezekiel 48). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6284.">6284.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac. That this signifies, and the quality of internal good and truth, is evident from the signification of "name," as being the quality (see n. 6283); and from the representation of Abraham and Isaac, as being internal good and truth (of which above, n. 6276). Internal good and truth must be in external good and truth, in order for these to be good and truth. For, as was said above (n. 6275), the external is merely a formed something, of such a nature that the internal can be in it, and lead a life there according to the influx into itself from the Lord; neither also is the internal anything else relatively to the highest, which is the Lord, whence is all life; and the things beneath are merely forms recipient of life through the degrees in their order, down to the last, which is the body. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6285.">6285.</a></font></span>
 <p>And let them grow unto a multitude in the midst of the earth. That this signifies extension from the inmost, is evident from the signification of the "midst," as being the inmost (see n. 2940, 2973, 6068, 6084, 6103). Hence "growing unto a multitude" is extension; for the truths that are signified by a "multitude" extend themselves round about from the inmost, as from a center; and the greater the extension thence is, and the better this is in accordance with heavenly order, so much the more perfect is the state; this is the state which is signified by this part of the blessing: "and let them grow unto a multitude in the midst of the earth." </p>

 <p>Verses 17-20. And Joseph saw that his father put his right hand, upon the head of Ephraim, and it was evil in his eyes; and he laid hold of the hand of his father to remove it from upon Ephraim's head upon Manasseh's head. And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. And his father refused, and said, I know, my son, I know; he also shall be for a people, and he also shall become great; and nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall be the fullness of the nations. And he blessed them in this day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God set thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh; and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.  "And Joseph saw that his father put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim," signifies a perception that he accounted truth as being in the first place; "and it was evil in his eyes," signifies displeasure; "and he laid hold of the hand of his father," signifies influx into the power of his obscure perception; "to remove it from upon Ephraim's head upon Manasseh's head," signifies to turn him away from error; "and Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn" signifies perceptible influx with respect to good that it has priority; "put thy right hand upon his head," signifies that thus it should be in the first place; "and his father refused," signifies no consent; "and said, I know, my son, I know," signifies that so it is, but that it appears otherwise; "he also shall be for a people, and he also shall become great," signifies that truth from good also shall be increased, thus the celestial man; "and nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he," signifies that good from truth shall receive more increase, thus the spiritual man; "and his seed shall be the fullness of the nations," signifies that the truth of faith shall reign; "and he blessed them in this day," signifies foresight and providence eternally; "saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God set thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh," signifies that his own spiritual may be in the truth of the intellectual and in the good of the will; "and he set Ephraim before Manasseh," signifies that he accounted truth as being in the first place, because he was spiritual. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6287.">6287.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Joseph saw that his father put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim. That this signifies a perception that he accounted truth as being in the first place, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being to understand and perceive (see n. 2150, 2807, 3764, 4567, 4723, 5400); from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal celestial (n. 5869, 5877, 6224); from the representation of Israel, who here is the "father," as being spiritual good from the natural; from the signification of "putting the right hand on the head," as being to account in the first place (n. 6269); and from the representation of Ephraim, as being the truth of the intellectual in the natural (n. 6234, 6238, 6267). From this it is plain that by "Joseph saw that his father put his right hand on the head of Ephraim," is signified a perception of the internal celestial that spiritual good from the natural accounted truth as being in the first place. (See what was said and shown above, n. 6256, 6269, 6272, 6273.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6288.">6288.</a></font></span>
 <p>And it was evil in his eyes. That this signifies displeasure, is evident without explication. The reason why it displeased Joseph was that by him is represented the internal celestial, which is above the spiritual good that is represented by Israel. What is higher can perceive how the case is with what is done in what is lower, thus also whether it is truth that is being thought there, or not. For as what is higher sees from the light of heaven, it sees the things that are below; thus the internal celestial which is "Joseph," saw that the spiritual good from the natural which is "Israel," was in error, and therefore it displeased him. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6289.">6289.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he laid hold of the hand of his father. That this signifies influx into the power of his obscure perception, is evident from the signification of "laying hold of the hand," as being influx into the power of perception; for when the internal desires by means of influx to compel the external to think and will something, it as it were takes hold of it, here of the power of perception that is signified by the "hand." (That the "hand" is power may be seen above, n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937.) That the perception is called obscure, is because relatively to the celestial, who are represented by Joseph, the spiritual, who are represented by Israel, are in obscurity. (That the spiritual are relatively in obscurity, may be seen above, n. 2708, 2715, 2716, 2718, 2831, 2849, 2935, 2937, 3833, 4402.) That the spiritual are in obscurity, is very evident from the fact that before they have been regenerated they are altogether in thick darkness with respect to truth and good, and that while they are being regenerated, it is such truth as is in the doctrine of their church that they acknowledge, and in which truth they have faith, whether it is true or not. Nevertheless it is this truth that becomes good with them when it becomes of the will and thence of the life, and then it is that good which is called the good of truth, and also the good of faith, and likewise spiritual good, or the good of the spiritual church. The quality of the good that is from such an origin may be known to everyone who considers the matter. Nevertheless the good from such truth, even with the Gentiles, is accepted by the Lord, provided it has for a principle or starting point charity toward the neighbor, and that in this charity there is innocence. </p>

 <p>To remove it from upon Ephraim's head upon Manasseh's head. That this signifies to turn him away from error, is evident from the signification of "removing," as being to turn away; and from the signification of "from upon Ephraim's head upon Manasseh's head," as being from error; for it was an error for him to account truth as being in the first place and good in the second, as has been shown above. </p>

 <p>And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn. That this signifies perceptible influx with respect to good, that it has the priority, is evident from the signification of "saying," when predicated of the internal celestial, which here is "Joseph," as being influx (see n. 6152); here perceptible influx, because he not only took hold of his hand, but also said, "Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6292.">6292.</a></font></span>
 <p>Put thy right hand upon his head. That this signifies that thus it should be in the first place, is evident from the signification of "putting the right hand on the head," as being to account in the first place (see n. 6269, 6287). That when he was blessing, Israel placed his hand on the head, was from a ritual received from the ancients; for in the head are the very intellectual and will of man, but in the body are acts according thereto, and compliance; thus putting the hand on the head was a representative that a blessing was being communicated to the intellectual and the will, thus to the man himself. From that ancient time the same ritual remains even to this day, and is in use in inaugurations, and also in the act of blessing. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6293.">6293.</a></font></span>

 <p>And said, I know, my son, I know. That this signifies that so it is, but that it appears otherwise, is evident from the signification of "knowing," as here being to know that it is so, but that it appears otherwise. That spiritual good which is "Israel" now perceived this, was from the influx of the internal celestial, which is "Joseph" (which influx has been treated of above, n. 6289, 6291). When spiritual good is in enlightenment from such an influx, it perceives that it is so, that is, that good is in the prior place, and truth in the posterior, and also that it appears otherwise; but at this time it makes the priority consist in the fact that truth should reign over good (as said below), and for this reason he retains the right hand on the head of the younger son, and the left on the head of the firstborn. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6295.">6295.</a></font></span>
 <p>He also shall be for a people, and he also shall become great. That this signifies that truth from good also shall be increased, thus the celestial man, is evident from the signification of "people," as being truth (see n. 1259, 1260, 3581, 4619); from the signification of "becoming great," as being to be increased; and from the representation of Manasseh, of whom this is said, as being the good of the will in the natural, born from the internal (see n. 6234, 6238, 6267). That truth from good is of the celestial man, is evident from what has already been frequently said and shown with respect to the celestial man, namely, that the celestial man is one who is in good from the will, and from this in truth; and that he is distinguished from the spiritual man by the fact that the latter is in truth from the intellectual, and from this in good. And because "Manasseh" is the good of the will, therefore by him is represented the celestial man, but the external celestial man, or the man of the external celestial church; for "Manasseh" is the good of the will in the natural, thus in the external man; whereas "Joseph" is the man of the internal celestial church, because he is the good of the will in the rational, thus in the internal man. [2] In a few words something must be said of the truth of good which is of the celestial man. This truth is indeed called truth, but it is good. With the celestial man there is the good of love to the Lord and the good of love toward the neighbor. The good of love to the Lord is his internal, and the good of love toward the neighbor is his external. Therefore as regards the men who are of the celestial church, those are in the internal of this church who are in love to the Lord, and those are in its external who are in love toward the neighbor. The good of this love, namely, of love toward the neighbor with the celestial man, is what is here called the "truth of good," and is represented by Manasseh. For the celestial man is such that he does not reason from truth, nor about truth, because he has perception from good (that is, through good from the Lord) that a thing is so or is not so (see n. 202, 337, 2715, 3246, 4448); and yet the good of charity with him is what is called truth, but celestial truth. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6296.">6296.</a></font></span>
 <p>And nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he. That this signifies that good from truth shall receive more increase, thus the spiritual man, is evident from the representation of Ephraim, here the "younger brother," as being the truth of the intellectual in the natural born from the internal (see n. 6234, 6238, 6267), but here "Ephraim" is good from truth (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "becoming greater" than another; as being to receive more increase. That here "Ephraim" is good from truth, is because he represents the man of the spiritual church, but the man of the external spiritual church, as Manasseh represents the man of the external celestial church (n. 6295). Good from truth constitutes this man, that is, the man of the spiritual church. The internal of this church is what is represented by Israel, but the external by Ephraim. The man of the spiritual church differs from the man of the celestial church in this, that the good of the spiritual church is implanted in the intellectual part, but the good of the celestial church in the will part (see n. 863, 875, 895, 927, 928, 1023, 1043, 1044, 2256, 4328, 4493, 5113); therefore Ephraim represents the spiritual man, and Manasseh the celestial. [2] That good from truth, or the spiritual man, receives more increase than the good from which is truth, or the celestial man, is because the will of man has continually been depraved, and at last so that evil has taken entire possession of it, insomuch that nothing sound (integer) has remained there. Therefore lest man should perish, the Lord provided that he might be regenerated as to the intellectual part, and thus be saved. Hence then it is that there are few with whom there is anything sound left in the will part, thus few who can become celestial men, but many who can become spiritual men; thus that the latter receive more increase than the former. This is what is signified by his "younger brother becoming greater than he." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6297.">6297.</a></font></span>
 <p>And his seed shall be the fullness of the nations. That this signifies that the truth which is of faith shall reign, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being faith and charity (see n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 1940, 2848, 3187, 3310, 3373, 3671), here faith, because predicated of Ephraim; and from the signification of the "fullness of the nations," as being abundance, thus that the truth of faith shall reign. "Fullness" in the Word signifies all, and where it does not signify all, it signifies abundant, and is predicated both of truth and of good; for "multitude" is predicated of truth, but "magnitude" of good, thus "fullness of both," as in Jeremiah:      Behold waters rise up out of the north, which shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land and the fullness thereof, the city and them that dwell therein (Jer. 47:2);  "the land and the fullness" denote all, both truth and good, that is of the church. For this reason it is added, "the city and them that dwell therein;" for by "city" are signified truths, and by "them that dwell therein," goods (n. 2268, 2451, 2712). [2] In Ezekiel:      They shall eat their bread with solicitude, and drink their waters with amazement, that the land thereof may be devastated from its fullness (Ezek. 12:19); the "land" denotes the church, and the "fullness" the good and truth there. That both are signified is evident from what precedes, that "they should eat bread with solicitude, and drink waters with amazement;" for by "bread" is signified the good of love, and by "waters" the truth of faith, which are called the "fullness of the earth." [3] In like manner in Amos:      The pride of Jacob, and his palaces, I hate, therefore will I shut up the city and the fullness thereof (Amos 6:8). In David:      The heavens are Thine, the earth also is Thine; the world and the fullness thereof Thou hast founded (Ps. 89:11).       The earth is Jehovah's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. For He hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the streams (Ps. 24:1, 2);  where also the "fullness" denotes truth and good; the "earth," the church in a specific, and the "world," the church in a universal sense. That "Jehovah founded the world upon the seas" denotes upon the things that are of memory-knowledge (n. 28); and that "He established it upon the streams" denotes upon the things that are of intelligence (n. 3051). Who cannot see that it is not meant that Jehovah founded the world upon the seas, and established it upon the streams, for the world is not founded and established thereon; and therefore he who reflects can see that by "seas" and by "streams" something else is signified, and that this something else is the spiritual or internal of the Word. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6298.">6298.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he blessed them in this day. That this signifies foresight and providence eternally, is evident from the signification of "blessing," as being prediction (see n. 6230, 6254), but in the supreme sense the Lord's foresight; and because foresight, it is also Providence, for the one is impossible without the other; for evil is foreseen and good is provided, and the evil which is foreseen is by providence bent into good. That here "to bless" denotes foresight and providence, is because Israel, who here blesses, in the supreme sense is the Lord (n. 4286). That eternally is meant, is evident from the signification of "this day," or "today," as being what is eternal (n. 2838, 3998, 4304, 6165). </p>

 <p>Saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God set thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. That this signifies that his own spiritual may be in the truth of the intellectual and the good of the will, is evident from the representation of Israel, as being spiritual good (see n. 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833); and from the representation of Ephraim, as being the truth of the intellectual, and of Manasseh, as being the good of the will (of which above). That the spiritual, which is "Israel," may be in them, is signified by the words, "in thee shall Israel bless, and God set thee." [2] As regards the spiritual represented by Israel being in the truth of the intellectual and the good of the will, which are "Ephraim and Manasseh," the case is this. The spiritual good which is represented by Israel is the spiritual of the internal church; whereas the truth and good represented by Ephraim and Manasseh are of the external church (see n. 6296). In order for an internal to be an internal of the church, it must needs be in the external of the church, for the external holds the place of the foundation on which the internal stands, and is the receptacle into which the internal flows. Hence it is that the natural, which is external, must needs be regenerated; for unless it is regenerated, the internal has neither foundation nor receptacle; and if it has no foundation nor receptacle, it utterly perishes. This then is what is meant by his own spiritual being in the truth of the intellectual and the good of the will. [3] As an illustration of this matter take this example. The very affection of charity which a man feels within himself as a quietude and bliss in benefiting the neighbor without regard to any recompense, is the internal of the church; but to will this good and to do it from truth, that is, because it has been so commanded in the Word, is the external of the church. If the natural, which is the external, is not in agreement, that is, does not will nor do this good, because it sees in it no recompense, thus nothing of self (for in the natural or external man there is such a disposition both from what is hereditary and from what is actual), then the internal has no foundation, nor corresponding receptacle, except such as either rejects, or perverts, or extinguishes the influx; and therefore the internal perishes, that is, is closed and stopped up, so that nothing from heaven can pass into the natural through the internal, except some light of a general nature that passes through the chinks everywhere round about, in order that there may be a faculty of thinking, of willing, and of speaking, but according to that which is in the natural, thus in favor of evil and falsity against good and truth, to which purpose it makes subservient that amount of spiritual light which in a general manner flows in through the chinks everywhere round about. </p>

 <p>And he set Ephraim before Manasseh. That this signifies that he accounted truth as being in the first place, because he was spiritual, is evident from what has been unfolded above (verses 13, 14, 17-19). </p>
