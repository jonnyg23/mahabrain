 <p>Verse 19. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for swearing he had called the sons of Israel to swear, saying, Visiting God will visit you; and ye shall bring up my bones with you from hence. "And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him," signifies the representative of a church, which they had; "for swearing he had caused the sons of Israel to swear, saying," signifies a binding; "Visiting God will visit you," signifies when this last state and first state of the church would come; "and ye shall bring up my bones with you from hence," signifies as above, the representative of a church with them, and not a church, which moreover is in what is internal. </p>

 <p>It is needless to unfold these words further, because they have been already unfolded at Gen. 50:24, 25, where like words occur (see n. 6590, 6952). 8102a. Verses 20-22. And they journeyed from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, at the end of the wilderness. And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them in the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and by night. The pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people. "And they journeyed from Succoth, and encamped in Etham," signifies the second state after they were liberated; "at the end of the wilderness," signifies the first state of temptations; "and Jehovah went before them," signifies the continuous presence of the Lord; "by day in a pillar of cloud," signifies that when there was a state of enlightenment, it was tempered by obscurity of truth; "to lead them in the way," signifies the Divine auspices; "and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light," signifies that when there was a state of obscurity it was tempered by enlightenment from good; "to go by day and by night," signifies thus life in both states; "the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people," signifies that the presence of the Lord was perpetual. </p>

 <p>And they journeyed from Succcoth, and encamped in Etham. That this signifies the second state after they were liberated, is evident from the fact that the journeyings and encampments of the sons of Israel after they went forth from Egypt, signify the spiritual states of those who were liberated by the Lord (concerning whom see above). The changes of states are signified by the journeys from one place to another and the residing there; the second state is here signified by the journeying from Succoth to Etham, because the first state was signified by the journeying from Rameses to Succoth (see n. 7972). Moreover by "journeyings" in the internal sense of the Word are signified states and purposes of life (n. 1293, 3335, 5605), and by "encampments" the settings in order of truth and good which are of the life (n. 4236). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8104.">8104.</a></font></span>
 <p>At the end of the wilderness. That this signifies the first state of temptations, is evident from the signification of a "wilderness," as being a state for the undergoing of temptations (of which above, n. 8098); and as this state began at the end of the wilderness, therefore by "the end of the wilderness" is signified the first state. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8105.">8105.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Jehovah went before them. That this signifies the continuous presence of the Lord, is evident without explication. (That "Jehovah" denotes the Lord, see above, n. 8046.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8106.">8106.</a></font></span>
 <p>By day in a pillar of cloud. That this signifies that when there was a state of enlightenment it was tempered by obscurity of truth, is evident from the signification of "by day," or "in the day," as being in a state of enlightenment; for the times of day, as morning, noon, evening, and night, correspond to the various degrees of enlightenment which belong to intelligence and wisdom in the other life (see n. 5672, 5962, 6110); whence "day" denotes a state of enlightenment or clear perception, and "night" a state of no enlightenment, or of obscure perception (n. 7680); and from the signification of "cloud," as being obscurity of truth, because a cloud takes away the brightness of light from the sun, and also tempers it. [2] In the Word throughout it is said that Jehovah appeared "in a cloud," and that He was "girded with a cloud," also that "beneath His feet was a cloud;" in which passages by "cloud" is meant obscurity of truth, specifically, the literal sense of the Word, for relatively to the internal sense this sense is obscurity of truth (see the preface to Gen. 18; also n. 4391, 5922, 6343, 6752). This was signified by the "cloud" when the Lord was seen by Peter, James, and John in glory (Luke 9:34); when from Mount Sinai by the people; and when by Moses upon his entering to Him there (Exod. 19:9; 20:18; 24:15-18; 34:5); and also by the circumstance that the Lord so often said that He "would come in the clouds of heaven" (Matt. 24:30; 26:63, 64; Mark 13:26; 14:61, 62; Luke 21:27).  [3] The literal sense of the Word is called a "cloud," because the internal sense, which is called "glory," cannot be comprehended by man, except one who is regenerated, and is also enlightened. If the internal sense of the Word, or truth Divine in its glory, were to appear before a man who is not regenerated, it would be like thick darkness, in which he would see nothing at all, and by which he would also be blinded, that is, would believe nothing. From all this it can be seen what is signified by a "cloud by day," namely, obscurity of truth; and when the Word is treated of, the literal sense.  [4] It is said "in a pillar of cloud and of fire," because by "a pillar" is signified a prop which supports (see Jer. 1:18; Ps. 75:3; Rev. 3:12; Job 9:6); and it is predicated of the natural, because the natural is like a prop or base to the spiritual; for the spiritual closes in the natural, and there rests. Hence it is that the feet of the angel descending from heaven appeared "as pillars of fire" (Rev. 10:1); for by "feet" is signified the natural (see n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952, 5327, 5328). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8107.">8107.</a></font></span>
 <p>To lead them in the way. That this signifies the Divine auspices, is evident from the signification of "leading in the way," when said of Jehovah, as being Providence, and the Divine auspices (see n. 8093, 8098). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8108.">8108.</a></font></span>
 <p>And by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light. That this signifies that when there was a state of obscurity, it was tempered by enlightenment from good, is evident from the signification of "night," as being a state of obscurity (see n. 1712, 6000); from the signification of "fire," as being the good of love (n. 934, 4906, 5215, 6314, 6832, 6834, 6849, 7324, 7852); and from the signification of "giving light," as being enlightenment. That Jehovah or the Lord appeared or went before in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night, was because thereby was represented the state of heaven, for in heaven there are never-ceasing variations and changes of state; for the angels are continually being perfected, which cannot possibly be done without unceasing changes of states. In general these variations and changes are like the changes of times in the world; namely, the changes of the times of the year; spring, summer, autumn, winter, and again spring; and the changes of the times of the day-morning, noon, evening, night, and again morning. When it is morning and noon in heaven, there is enlightenment of the understanding from the Lord, but this enlightenment is then tempered by obscurity of truth as by a cloud; and when it is evening and night there, they have obscurity of understanding, but this is tempered by the Lord by means of the good of love, as by a fire which gives light. These are the things which were represented by the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night with the sons of Israel in the wilderness. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8109.">8109.</a></font></span>
 <p>To go by day and by night. That this signifies life in both states, is evident from the signification of "going" and "journeying," as being to live (see n. 3335, 3690, 4882, 5493, 5605); and from the signification of "day," as being a state of enlightenment; and of "night," as being a state of obscurity (of which just above, n. 8106, 8108); thus both states. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8110.">8110.</a></font></span>
 <p>The pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people. That this signifies that the presence of the Lord was perpetual, is evident from what has now been unfolded; for so the angels, in whose midst was the Lord, appeared before the people. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8111.">8111.</a></font></span>
 <p>ON THE SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE PLANET JUPITER, CONTINUED By long continued interaction with the spirits of the earth Jupiter, it became evident that they are better disposed than the spirits of some other earths. Their approach when they came, their stay, and their influx at the time, were inexpressibly gentle and sweet. In the other life goodness manifests itself by gentleness and sweetness. These qualities could be very clearly distinguished from the gentleness and sweetness of the good spirits of our earth. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8112.">8112.</a></font></span>
 <p>When any slight disagreement arises among them, there appears to them as it were a slender ray of white light, such as usually is that of lightning; or a little band in which are sparkling stars. These are signs of disagreement; but the disagreement among them is quickly repaired. When the stars sparkle and at the same time wander, the sign is not good; but when the sparkling stars are fixed, the sign is good. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8113.">8113.</a></font></span>
 <p>I was able to recognize the presence of the spirits of Jupiter, not only from the gentleness and sweetness of their approach and influx, but also from the fact that they inflowed most especially into the face, and that they disposed it to be smiling and cheerful, and continually so while they were present. It was said that they so dispose the faces of the inhabitants of their earth, for they wish to inspire them with tranquillity and delight of heart. This tranquillity and delight with which they inspired me sensibly filled my chest and heart. The desires and anxieties about the future, which induce intranquility and unpleasantness, and excite and agitate the mind into various disturbances, were then removed. From this I could clearly see what was the quality of the life of the inhabitants of the planet Jupiter. They told me that they do not fear death, except a little on account of the loss of their married partner and children, because they know of a certainty that the death of the body is a continuation of life, and that after it they become more happy. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8114.">8114.</a></font></span>
 <p>I noticed that they had a still more interior state of happiness, and that they were susceptible of a state of happiness still more interior yet. This is discerned from the fact that their interiors are not closed, but are open to the Lord; for the more open the interiors are, the more susceptible men are of the Divine good and the Divine happiness. Very different is the case with those who do not live in the order of heaven. With such the interiors are closed and the exteriors are open to hell, whence flow in contempt for others, hatreds, revenges, and cruelties, which it is a delight for them to exercise against those who do not reverence them, or do not favor their desires. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8115.">8115.</a></font></span>
 <p>The spirits of the earth Jupiter cannot be together with the spirits of our earth, because these are of a wholly different genius, and do not love the delight of tranquillity as they do. It surprised them to hear that people from our earth who become angels are wholly different in heart, and retain scarcely anything that is like their state when they were spirits. To show them that such is the case there came in succession from heaven a number of choirs of angels from our earth. (There are choirs when many think, speak, and act all together as a one in an uninterrupted series: the celebration of the Lord in the heavens is for the most part effected by means of choirs: as to choirs, see n. 1648, 1649, 2595, 2596, 3350, 5182.) These choirs gave so much delight to the spirits of Jupiter who were with me that they seemed to themselves to be as it were transported into heaven. This glorification by means of choirs lasted about an hour. The delicious feelings excited thereby in the spirits, being communicated to me, I was enabled to feel them. They said that they would tell this to their people who were elsewhere. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8116.">8116.</a></font></span>
 <p>They reported that in the region of their earth where they had been, there is a great multitude of men, as great as the planet can feed; and that the planet is fertile, and abounds in all things; and that its inhabitants desire no more than will suffice for the necessaries of life, and that consequently the multitude of men is so great. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8117.">8117.</a></font></span>
 <p>They reported further that they are there distinguished into nations, families, and houses; that they all dwell separately with their own; that their interaction is mostly with their family connections; that no one ever desires the goods of another, and that it never comes into their minds to claim anything thereof for themselves, still less to attack and plunder, which they regard as a crime contrary to human nature, and horrible. When I desired to tell them that in this earth there are wars, plunderings, and slaughterings, they turned away, and were averse to hear. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8118.">8118.</a></font></span>
 <p>I have been told by the angels that the most ancient people on this earth dwelt in like manner, that is, distinguished into nations, families and houses; that they were all content with their own goods; and that to grow rich from the goods of others, and to exercise dominion, were then quite unknown. On this account, the ancient times, and especially the most ancient, were more acceptable to the Lord than the succeeding ones; and such being the state, innocence also then reigned, and with innocence, wisdom. Everyone then did what is good from good, and what is just from justice. They did not know what it is to do what is good and just with a view to self-honor, or for the sake of profit. They did not then speak anything but the truth; and this not so much from truth, as from good; that is, not from the understanding separate, but from the will conjoined. Such were the ancient times, and therefore angels could then have interaction with men, and lead their minds home to heaven in a state almost separated from bodily things, and could take them round, and show them the magnificent and happy things there, and likewise communicate to them their own happinesses and delights. Moreover those times were known to ancient writers, and were called by them the Golden and also the Saturnian Age.  [2] Those times were of this nature, because, as before said, they lived distinguished into nations, and the nations into families, and the families into houses, and each house dwelt by itself; and because it never then came into anyone's mind to attack the inheritance of another, and thereby get for himself wealth and dominion. Far removed then were the love of self and the love of the world, and everyone rejoiced at heart by reason of his own good, and not less by reason of another's.  [3] But in the succeeding time this scene was changed and turned into the opposite, when the lust of dominion and of possessing the goods of others invaded the mind. Then for the sake of self-defense, the human race gathered into kingdoms and empires. And as the laws of charity and conscience, which had been written on hearts, ceased to operate, it became necessary to enact laws to restrain acts of violence; in which laws, honors, and riches were the rewards, and the deprivation of these were the penalties. When the state was thus changed, heaven removed itself from man, and this more and more, even to the present age, when it is no longer known whether there is a heaven, and consequently whether there is a hell, and when it is even denied that these exist. These things have been stated, in order that by the parallelism there may be illustrated the quality of the state of those who are on the earth Jupiter, and whence comes their good disposition, and also their wisdom, of which more will be said in what follows. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8119.">8119.</a></font></span>
 <p>A continuation about the spirits and inhabitants of the earth Jupiter will be found at the end of the following chapter. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8120.">8120.</a></font></span>
 <p>Exodus 14 THE DOCTRINE OF CHARITY It is believed that charity toward the neighbor consists in giving to the poor, in helping the needy, and in doing good to everyone without exception. Nevertheless genuine charity consists in acting prudently, and to the end that good may come thereby. He who helps any poor or needy rogue, does evil to his neighbor through him, for by the help which he affords he confirms him in evil, and supplies him with the means of doing evil to others. It is otherwise with him who gives assistance to the good. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8121.">8121.</a></font></span>
 <p>But charity toward the neighbor extends much more widely than to the poor and needy. Charity toward the neighbor consists in doing right in every work, and one's duty in every office. If a judge does what is just for the sake of justice, he exercises charity toward the neighbor; if he punishes the guilty and acquits the guiltless, he exercises charity toward the neighbor, for he thus consults the welfare of his fellow-citizen, of his country, and also of the Lord's kingdom. By doing what is just for the sake of justice he consults the welfare of the Lord's kingdom; by acquitting the guiltless, he consults that of his fellow-citizen; and by punishing the guilty, that of his country. The priest who teaches truth, and leads to good, for the sake of truth and good, exercises charity; but he who does such things for the sake of himself and the world does not exercise charity, because he does not love his neighbor, but himself. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8122.">8122.</a></font></span>
 <p>The case is the same in all other instances, whether men be in any employment or not; as with children toward their parents, and with parents toward their children; with servants toward their masters, and with masters toward their servants; with subjects toward their king, and with the king toward his subjects. In these cases he who does his duty from a sense of duty, and what is just from a sense of justice, exercises charity. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8123.">8123.</a></font></span>
 <p>That such things belong to charity toward the neighbor, is because every man is the neighbor, but in various ways (see n. 6818); a society smaller or larger is more the neighbor (n. 6819, 6820); our country is yet more the neighbor (n. 6819, 6821); the church still more (n. 6819, 6822); the Lord's kingdom still more (n. 6819, 6823); and the Lord above all (n. 6819, 6824). In the universal sense the good which proceeds from the Lord is the neighbor (n. 6706, 6711), consequently so also are justice and right. And therefore he who does any good whatsoever for the sake of good, and anything just for the sake of justice, loves the neighbor and exercises charity, for he acts from the love of what is good, and the love of what is just, and thus from the love of those in whom these are. But he who does what is unjust for the sake of any self-advantage whatever, hates his neighbor. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8124.">8124.</a></font></span>
 <p>He who is in charity toward the neighbor from internal affection is a charity toward the neighbor in everything which he thinks and speaks, and which he wills and does. It can be said that as to his interiors a man or an angel is a charity when good is to him the neighbor. So widely does charity toward the neighbor extend.            EXODUS 14      1. And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,       2. Speak unto the sons of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon: over against it shall ye encamp by the sea.      3. And Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut upon them.      4. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his army; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.      5. And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?      6. And he harnessed his chariot, and took his people with him:      7. And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and tertian captains upon all of them.      8. And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the sons of Israel; and the sons of Israel went out with a lofty hand.      9. And the Egyptians pursued after them, and overtook them encamping by the sea, all the horses of the chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, beside Pi-hahiroth before Baal-zephon.      10. And Pharaoh drew nigh, and the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold the Egyptian marching after them, and they were sore afraid; and the sons of Israel cried unto Jehovah.      11. And they said unto Moses, are there no graves in Egypt, that thou hast taken us to die in the wilderness? Why hast thou done this to us, to lead us forth out of Egypt?      12. Is not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Cease from us, and let us serve the Egyptians? because it is good for us to serve the Egyptians, rather than that we should die in the wilderness.      13. And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which He will do for you today; for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever.      14. Jehovah shall wage war for you, and ye shall keep silence.      15. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Why criest thou unto Me? speak unto the sons of Israel, that they set forward.      16. And thou, lift up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and cleave it asunder; and the sons of Israel shall come into the midst of the sea on the dry.      17. And I, behold I will harden the heart of the Egyptians, and they shall come after them; and I will be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his army, in his chariots, and in his horsemen.      18. And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I am glorified in Pharaoh, in his chariots, and in his horsemen.      19. And the angel of God set out, marching before the camp of Israel, and he went behind them; and the pillar of cloud set out from before them and stood behind them:      20. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness, and it lighted up the night; and the one came not near the other all the night.      21. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah made the sea go away by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry, and the waters were cleft asunder.      22. And the sons of Israel came into the midst of the sea in the dry; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.      23. And the Egyptians pursued, and came after them, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen, into the midst of the sea.      24. And it was in the morning watch, and Jehovah looked forth to the camp of the Egyptians in the pillar of fire and of cloud, and troubled the camp of the Egyptians.      25. And He took off the wheel of his chariots, and he drew it in heaviness; and the Egyptian said, I will flee before Israel; because Jehovah wageth war for them against the Egyptians.      26. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, and let the waters return upon the Egyptians, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.      27. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned at the turn of the morning to the strength of its flow; and the Egyptians fled to meet it; and Jehovah shook out the Egyptians into the midst of the sea.      28. And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the army of Pharaoh that came after them into the sea; there was not left of them even one.      29. And the sons of Israel went on the dry into the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.      30. And Jehovah saved Israel on this day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.      31. And Israel saw the great hand which Jehovah wrought on the Egyptians, and the people feared Jehovah; and they believed in Jehovah, and in His servant Moses. </p>

 <p>THE CONTENTS.      In this chapter, in the internal sense, the subject treated of is the first temptation of those who are of the spiritual church, and the conducting of them through the midst of hell, and their protection then by the Lord; and also the immersion of those who were in faith separate from charity in hell, where are falsities from evils. They who are of the spiritual church are represented by the sons of Israel; they who are in faith separate from charity by the Egyptians. The first temptation is described by the murmuring of the sons of Israel when they saw the army of Pharaoh. Hell is signified by the "sea Suph" through which the sons of Israel were conducted in safety, and in which the Egyptians were immersed. Falsities from evils are signified by the waters which covered the latter. </p>

 <p>THE INTERNAL SENSE Verses 1-4. And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the sons of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon; over against it shall ye encamp by the sea. And Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut upon them. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his army; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so. "And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying," signifies instruction by the Divine by means of Divine truth; "Speak unto the sons of Israel," signifies the influx of truth Divine with those who are of the spiritual church; "that they turn back," signifies that they were not yet prepared; "and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon," signifies the beginning of a state for undergoing temptations; "over against it shall ye encamp by the sea," signifies that the influx of temptation is thence; "and Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel," signifies the thought of those who are in damnation concerning the state of those who are of the spiritual church; "They are entangled in the land," signifies that they are in confusion in respect to the things of the church; "the wilderness hath shut upon them," signifies that obscurity has taken possession of them; "and I will harden Pharaoh's heart," signifies that they who were in falsities from evil would still be determined; "and he shall follow after them," signifies that they would still endeavor to subjugate them; "and I will be glorified," signifies that they should see a Divine effect from the Divine Human of the Lord in the dissipation of falsity; "in Pharaoh, and in all his army," signifies the immersion in hell of those who were in falsities from evil, and an environment there by falsities as by waters; "and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah," signifies that from this it will be known that the Lord is the only God; "and they did so," signifies obedience. </p>

 <p>And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying. That this signifies instruction by the Divine by means of Divine truth, is evident from the signification of "Jehovah spake and said," when concerning those things which shall be done and come to pass, as being instruction by the Divine (see n. 7186, 7241, 7267, 7304, 7380, 7517); and from the representation of Moses, as being the Lord as to Divine truth (n. 6723, 6752, 6771, 6827, 7010, 7014, 7089, 7382). It is said by means of Divine truth, because Moses, by whom Divine truth is represented, was to speak unto the people. The Divine Itself does not instruct and speak with men, nor indeed with angels, immediately; but mediately by means of Divine truth (n. 7009). This is meant by the Lord's words in John:      No one hath ever seen God; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath set Him forth (John 1:18; 5:37). By "the only-begotten Son" is meant the Lord as to Divine truth; from this also the Lord calls Himself "the Son of man" (n. 2628, 2803, 2813, 3704). The Lord also, when in the world, was Divine truth; but afterward, when He was glorified, He became also as to the Human, Divine good; and then from this proceeded Divine truth, which is the "Spirit of truth" or "Holy Spirit." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8128.">8128.</a></font></span>
 <p>Speak unto the sons of Israel. That this signifies the influx of truth Divine with those who are of the spiritual church, is evident from the signification of "speaking," as being influx (see n. 2951, 5481, 5797, 7270), and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (n. 6426, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223). "To speak" denotes influx, because in the internal representative sense Moses is Divine truth, and Divine truth comes into perception and thought by influx. Thought from perception is internal speech, to which external speech corresponds; and therefore in the internal sense the former is meant by the latter. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8129.">8129.</a></font></span>
 <p>That they turn back. That this signifies that they were not yet prepared, is evident from the signification of "turning back," namely, from the way of the land of the Philistines to the way of the wilderness at the sea Suph, as being that they were not yet prepared, namely for introduction into heaven, which is signified by their entrance into the land of Canaan. How the case herein is, and that "turning back" denotes that they were not prepared, can be seen from what was unfolded and shown at verse 18 of the preceding chapter (n. 8098, 8099); namely, that they could not be introduced into heaven until they had undergone temptations, and the Lord had thereby confirmed truths and goods and had conjoined them. This is here meant by "being prepared." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8130.">8130.</a></font></span>
 <p>And encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon. That this signifies the beginning of a state for undergoing temptations, is evident from the signification of "encamping," as being the setting in order of truth and good (see n. 4236, 8103), here for undergoing temptations. This state is what is signified by the places at which they were to encamp. That this state is signified is plain from what follows, in that Pharaoh with his army afterward pitched his camp there, and that at the sight of them the sons of Israel came into grievous anxiety, by which the first state of temptations is signified (see what follows at verses 9 to 12). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8131.">8131.</a></font></span>
 <p>Over against it shall ye encamp by the sea. That this signifies that the influx of temptation is thence, is evident from the signification of "over against it," as being near, so as to be in sight, and in the internal sense so that there was influx thence; and from the signification of "encamping," as being the setting in order of truth and good for the undergoing of temptations (as just above, see n. 8130); and from the signification of "the sea Suph," as being the hell where are falsities from evils (n. 8099). How it is to be understood that the influx of temptation was from there shall be briefly told. Temptations with man are spiritual combats between evil and good spirits, which combats are from those things and concerning those things which the man has done and thought, and which are in his memory. The evil spirits accuse and attack; but the good excuse and defend. These combats appear as if in the man, for the things which flow in from the spiritual world with a man are not presented as being from that world, but in himself (n. 741, 751, 761, 1820, 3927, 4249, 4307, 4572, 5036, 6657, 6666). It is the same with spirits when they undergo temptations. Therefore when people are about to undergo temptations, the interior things in them, that is, the truths and goods, are arranged by the Lord into such a state that by immediate influx from Himself and mediate influx through heaven, the falsities and evils which are from the hells may be resisted, and thereby he who is in temptation may be protected. When a man is being tempted he is also near hell, especially near that hell which is signified by "the sea Suph," for in this hell are they who have been in the memory-knowledge of truth but in a life of evil, and thereby in falsities derived from evil. From the hells, through spirits, those things flow in which bring anxiety upon man in temptations. From all this it can be seen what is meant by the influx of temptation from hell, which is signified by their "encamping over against it by the sea Suph." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8132.">8132.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel. That this signifies the thought of those who are in damnation concerning the state of those who are of the spiritual church, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being thought (see n. 7094, 7107, 7244, 7937); from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who infest by means of falsities (n. 7107, 7110, 7126, 7142, 7220, 7228, 7317), here those who are in damnation, that is, in mere falsities from evil, for they who are merely in these, are in damnation (this state is signified by Pharaoh and the Egyptians after the firstborn were slain in Egypt, for by the slaying of the firstborn is signified damnation, n. 7766, 7778); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (as just above, n. 8128). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8133.">8133.</a></font></span>
 <p>They are entangled in the land. That this signifies that they are in confusion in respect to the things of the church, is evident from the signification of "being entangled," as being to be perplexed, thus to be in confusion (n. 2831); and from the signification of "land," as being those things which are of the church. (That "land" denotes the church, see n. 8011.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8134.">8134.</a></font></span>
 <p>The wilderness hath shut upon them. That this signifies that obscurity has taken possession of them, is evident from the signification of "shutting upon them," when said of the obscurity which is signified by "the wilderness," as being to take complete possession of them; and from the signification of "wilderness," as being the obscurity of faith (see n. 7313). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8135.">8135.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I will harden Pharaoh's heart. That this signifies that they who were in falsities from evil would still be determined, is evident from the signification of "hardening the heart," as being to be determined (see n. 7272, 7300, 7305); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who are in falsities from evil, or what is the same thing, who are in damnation (n. 8132). It is said "Pharaoh's heart," because by "heart" in the genuine sense is signified the good of celestial love (n. 3313, 3635, 3883-3896, 7542), consequently in the opposite sense is signified evil; here the evil of those who have been in the memory-knowledge of faith and in a life of evil. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8136.">8136.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he shall follow after them. That this signifies that they would still endeavor to subjugate them, is evident from the signification of "following after them," as being to endeavor to subjugate; for the intention of their pursuit was to reduce them into a state of servitude, and by "making to serve," when said of the Egyptians, is signified the intention to subjugate (n. 6666, 6670, 6671). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8137.">8137.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I will be glorified. That this signifies that they should see a Divine effect from the Divine Human of the Lord in the dissipation of falsity, is evident from the signification of "to be glorified," when said of Jehovah or the Lord, as being a Divine effect, here from His Divine Human, because by coming into the world and assuming the Human and making it Divine, the Lord cast into the hells all evils and falsities, and reduced the heavens into order, and also liberated from damnation those who were of the spiritual church (see n. 6854, 6914, 7091, 7828, 7932, 8018). These things are in general signified by "being glorified," but here there is signified that they who had infested the well-disposed should be cast into hell, and there encompassed about with falsities as with waters of a sea, and this as a Divine effect from the mere presence of the Lord.  [2] To show how the case herein is, it shall be further unfolded. There are as many hells as there are genera and species of evils, each hell being separated from others as it were by rain-storms, clouds, or waters. In the other life evils and falsities appear before the eyes of spirits as rain-storms and clouds, and also as waters; the falsities from evils of those who have been of the spiritual church and have lived evilly, appear as waters; but the falsities from evils of those who have been of the celestial church, appear as rain-storms. They who are in the hells appear to be thus encompassed, with a difference everywhere in respect to amount and kind, density and rarity, thick darkness and dimness, according to the genus and species of the falsity from evil. The hell where they are who have lived in faith separate from charity and in a life of evil, is encompassed as by the waters of a sea; the falsities of evil do not indeed appear as waters to those who are there, but to those who look from without. Above that sea, where these are, are the hells of adulterers; these are above, because in the internal sense adulteries denote adulterations of good and the consequent perversions of truth, thus they denote evils from which come falsities contrary to the truths and goods of faith (n. 2466, 2729, 3399), being such falsities as are with those who are in the hell beneath, and who have lived contrary to the truth of the church, and have made its good of no account, and therefore have also adulterated and perverted everything that is said in the Word about good, that is, about charity toward the neighbor and about love to God.  [3] As regards the "glorification in Pharaoh and in his army," this here denotes immersion in this hell and being encompassed by waters as of a sea at the mere presence of the Lord, as was said above. For the evil flee from the presence of the Lord, that is, the presence of the good and truth that are from Him, feeling horror and torment at their mere approach; and also by reason of this presence they become encompassed about with their own evils and falsities, for these then burst forth from them; and indeed these evils and falsities encompass and are interposed in order to prevent the Divine from flowing in and tormenting them. This is the Divine effect which is here signified by the "glorification in Pharaoh and in his army." That this effect is from the Divine Human of the Lord, is because, as before said, by the Lord's coming into the world and assuming the Human and making it Divine, He cast all falsities and evils into hell, and reduced truths and goods in the heavens into order, and liberated from damnation those who were of the spiritual church. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8138.">8138.</a></font></span>
 <p>In Pharaoh and in all his army. That this signifies the immersion in hell of those who were in falsities from evil, and an environment there by falsities as by waters, is evident from what has just been mentioned (n. 8137), namely, that by "Pharaoh" and also by "his army," are signified those who were cast into hell; by "Pharaoh," those who are in falsities from evil, and by "his army," the falsities themselves. (That "armies" denote truths from good see n. 3448, 7236, 7988, and therefore in the opposite sense they signify falsities from evil n. 3448.) It is said "an environment by falsities as by waters," because falsities from evil, such as belong to those of the church who have been in faith separate and in a life of evil, appear there like waters (n. 8137), and it is from this that inundations of waters signify vastations of truth, and the waters of them, falsities (n. 705, 739, 756, 6346, 6853, 7307). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8139.">8139.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. That this signifies that from this it will be known that the Lord is the only God, is evident from what has been unfolded above (n. 7401, 7444, 7544, 7598, 7636), where like words occur. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8140.">8140.</a></font></span>

 <p>Verses 5-9. And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us? And he harnessed his chariot, and took his people with him; and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and tertian captains upon all of them. And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the sons of Israel; and the sons of Israel went out with a lofty hand. And the Egyptians pursued after them, and overtook them encamping by the sea, all the horses of the chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon. "And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled," signifies the thought of those who were in mere falsities from evil, that they were completely separated; "and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people," signifies a change of state into evil in the case of those who were in falsities from evil; "and they said, What is this we have done?" signifies chiding; "that we have let Israel go from serving us," signifies that they have left and have not subjugated them; "and he harnessed his chariot," signifies the doctrine of falsity, which is that of faith separate in general; "and took his people with him," signifies with all falsities both in general and in particular; "and he took six hundred chosen chariots," signifies all and each of the doctrinal things of falsity which are of faith separate in their order; "and all the chariots of Egypt," signifies also the doctrinal things of falsity that are of service to them; "and tertian captains upon all of them," signifies reduced into order under generals; "and Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt," signifies obstinacy from the falsity which is from evil; "and he pursued after the sons of Israel," signifies an attempt to subjugate those who were in faith conjoined with charity; "and the sons of Israel went out with a lofty hand," signifies when nevertheless they had been released by the Divine power from the endeavor to subjugate them; "and the Egyptians pursued after them," signifies the effect from the endeavor to subjugate on the part of those who were in falsities from evil; "and overtook them encamping by the sea," signifies communication around the region of hell where are falsities from evil; "all the horses of the chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army," signifies all things which are of falsity from a perverted understanding; "beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon," signifies whence there was communication, and therefore the beginning of the state of undergoing temptations. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8142.">8142.</a></font></span>
 <p>And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled. That this signifies the thought of those who were in mere falsities from evil, that they were completely separated, is evident from the signification of anyone's being told, as being to think and reflect (see n. 2862, 5508); from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who are in falsities from evil (n. 8132, 8135), and who when he is called "king of Egypt" denotes those who are in mere falsities (n. 7220, 7228), for by "king" are signified truths (n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 4575, 4581, 4966, 5044, 6148), consequently in the opposite sense falsities; and from the signification of "fleeing," as being to be separated. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8143.">8143.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people. That this signifies a change of state into evil in the case of those who were in falsities from evil, is evident from the signification of "the heart being turned," as being a change of state into evil; (that "to be turned," denotes to be changed, here as to the mind, thus as to the state, is evident, and that "heart" denotes evil see above, n. 8135); from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who are in falsities from evil (n. 8132); from the signification of "servants," as being those who are of lower condition, and who minister, consequently all and each who are in falsities from evil (n. 7396), and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church. Hence it is evident that by "the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants being turned against the people," is signified a change of state into evil in the case of all those who are in falsities from evil, against those who are of the spiritual church. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8144.">8144.</a></font></span>
 <p>And they said, What is this we have done? That this signifies a chiding, namely, of themselves, is evident without explication. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8145.">8145.</a></font></span>
 <p>That we have let Israel go from serving us. That this signifies that they have left and have not subjugated them, is evident from the signification of "letting go," as being to leave; and from the signification of "from serving us," when said by the Egyptians concerning the sons of Israel, as being from assaulting by means of falsities and infesting (see n. 7120, 7129), and from subjugating thereby (n. 6666, 6670, 6671). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8146.">8146.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he harnessed his chariot. That this signifies the doctrine of falsity, which is that of faith separate in general, is evident from the signification of a "chariot," as being doctrine (see n. 2760, 5321, 5945), here the doctrine of falsity which is of faith separate, because it is the chariot of Pharaoh, and by Pharaoh are represented the falsities which are of faith separate; for they who are in faith separate from charity and at the same time in a life of evil must needs be in falsities (n. 8094).  [2] In what now follows, the subject treated of is the gathering together of all the falsities derived from evil with those who have been in faith separate from charity and in a life of evil. In what precedes, the vastation of the truths of faith with them was described, and their final reduction to the state of being in mere falsities from evil, thus in damnation. In this chapter their being cast down into hell is now treated of, for this follows damnation. With this state of being cast down into hell, the case is this. When this is to be done, all the falsities that appertain to them are gathered together into one, which is effected by the opening of all the hells with which they have had communication, and their being poured in upon them. Thence come the condensations around them of falsities from evil which appear as waters to those who look at them from without (n. 8137, 8138), for they are exhalations from their life; and when they are encompassed about with these, they are in hell. That the falsities from evil are gathered together into one and are poured in upon them, is done in order that they may be surrounded by such things as have been of their life, and may be afterward kept in them. Their kind of evil and its derivative falsity then distinguish them and their hell from other hells.  [3] As the subject treated of is the gathering together of all the falsities from evil which appertain to them, therefore such frequent mention is made in this chapter of the chariots of Pharaoh, his horses, horsemen, army, and people, for by these are signified all things of falsity which appertain to them, as in this verse, "He harnessed his chariot, and took his people with him;" in the seventh verse, "He took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt;" in the ninth verse, "And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army;" in verse seventeen, "I will be glorified in Pharaoh, in all his army, in his chariots, and in his horsemen;" in like manner in verse eighteen; again in verse twenty-three, "And the Egyptians pursued, and came after them, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen;" in verse twenty-five, "Jehovah removed the wheel of their chariots;" in verse twenty-six, "That the waters may return upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen;" in verse twenty-eight, "The waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even to all the army of Pharaoh." These things are repeated so many times because the subject treated of is falsities from evil, in that these were gathered together and poured in upon them; for by the things mentioned above are signified all things of falsity from evil; by "Pharaoh and the Egyptians," the men themselves who are in falsities from evil; by "chariots," the doctrinal things of falsity; by "horses," false memory-knowledges from a perverted understanding; by "horsemen," the derivative reasonings; by "army," and "people," the falsities themselves. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8147.">8147.</a></font></span>
 <p>And took his people with him. That this signifies with all falsities both in general and in particular, is evident from the signification of "people," as being truths, and in the opposite sense falsities (see n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 3581), here falsities derived from evil, which are represented by Pharaoh and the Egyptians when it is said "Pharaoh and his servants," or "Pharaoh and his people," there are signified all, both in general and in particular, who are in these falsities, also all the falsities both in general and in particular (n. 7396). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8148.">8148.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he took six hundred chosen chariots. That this signifies all and each of the doctrinal things of falsity which are of faith separate, in their order, is evident from the signification of the number "six hundred," as being each and all things of the truth and good of faith in one complex, thus in the opposite sense each and all things of the falsity and evil of faith separate from charity (that these are signified by "six hundred" can be seen from what has been shown concerning the number "six hundred thousand," n. 7973); and from the signification of "chariots," as being doctrinal things of faith, here of faith separate (see just above, n. 8146). By "chosen chariots" are signified the chief doctrinal things of this faith, on which the rest depend; those which depend on them, or serve them, being signified by "the chariots of Egypt" (of which presently).  [2] Be it known that these falsities, which are here signified by "Pharaoh, his army, and his people," also by his "chariots, horses, and horsemen," are especially the falsities of those who are in persuasive faith, that is, who persuade themselves that the doctrinal things of the church in which they are, are true, and yet are in a life of evil. Persuasive faith exists together with evil of life, but not saving faith; for persuasive faith is a persuasion that all things that belong to the doctrine of the church are true, not for the sake of truth, nor for the sake of life, nor even for the sake of salvation, for in this they scarcely believe; but for the sake of self-advantage, that is, for the sake of getting honors and wealth, and for the sake of reputation with a view to these. They learn doctrinal things in order to acquire such things, thus not to the end that they may be of service to the church and the salvation of souls, but to serve themselves and those who belong to them; and therefore it is all the same to them whether these doctrinal things are true, or false; this they care nothing about, still less inquire into, for they are in no affection of truth for the sake of truth. No matter what kind of doctrinal things they may be, they confirm them; and when they have confirmed them, they persuade themselves that they are true, not considering that falsities can be confirmed equally as well as truths (n. 4741, 5033, 6865, 7012, 7680, 7950).  [3] This is the source of persuasive faith, which, because it has not for its end, and does not regard, the neighbor and his good, thus not the Lord, but self and the world, that is, honors and self-advantage, is conjoined with evil of life, but not with good of life; for assuredly the faith that is conjoined with this is saving faith. This faith is given by the Lord, but the other is from the man himself. The one remains to eternity; the other is dissipated in the other life, and is also dissipated in the world if nothing is gained by it. But so long as men profit by it, they fight for it as for heaven itself, although it is not for that faith, but for themselves; for the things of faith, that is, of doctrine, are to them as means to an end; that is, to eminence and opulence. They who are in this faith in the world can with difficulty be distinguished from those who are in saving faith, for they speak and preach from an ardor as of zeal for the doctrine; but it is an ardor from the fire of the love of self and of the world.  [4] These are they who are especially signified by "Pharaoh and the Egyptians," and in the other life they are vastated in respect to this faith; and this being vastated, they are in mere falsities from evil, for falsities then burst forth from the evil. Every evil is attended with its falsity, for they are joined together; and the falsities appear when they are left to the evil of their life. The evil is then like a fire, and the falsities are like the light from it. This kind of evil and the consequent falsity is quite different from other kinds of evils and the consequent falsities, being more detestable than all others, because it is contrary to the goods and truths of faith, and therefore there is profanation in this evil. (Profanation is the acknowledgment of truth and good and yet a life contrary thereto, n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059, 2051, 3398, 3898, 4289, 4601, 6959, 6963, 6971.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8149.">8149.</a></font></span>
 <p>And all the chariots of Egypt. That this signifies also the doctrinal things of falsity that are of service to them, is evident from the signification of "the chariots of Pharaoh," as being the chief doctrinal things of falsity on which the others depend; consequently by "the chariots of Egypt" are signified the doctrinal things of falsity which are of service to them (of which just above, n. 8148); for by a king and his chariots are signified principal things, but by the people, that is, "the Egyptians," and their "chariots," are signified secondary things. The doctrinal things of the church with those who are in evil of life are called doctrinal things of falsity, although it is possible that as to some part, greater or less, they are true. The reason is that with those who are in evil of life, truths, insofar as such people are concerned, are not truths, because by application to the evil which is of the life they put off the essence of truth, and put on the nature of falsity, for they look to evil, with which they conjoin themselves. Truths cannot be conjoined with evil unless they are falsified, which is done by means of wrong interpretations, and thus perversions. Hence it is that with such the doctrinal things of the church are called doctrinal things of falsity, even although they had been truths; for it is a canon that with those who are in evil of life truths are falsified, and with those who are in good of life falsities are made true. The reason why with these falsities are made true, is that they are applied so as to agree with good, and in this way the crudities of the falsity are wiped away (n. 8051). </p>

 <p>And tertian captains <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">8150-1</font></a> upon all of them. That this signifies reduced into order under generals, is evident from the signification of "tertian captains," as being generals under which are particulars. "Tertian captains" have this signification because "three," from which they are called "tertian," signifies what is complete and perfect (see n. 2788, 4495, 7715), and "captains" signify chief things; and these together with what is complete and perfect are generals, for each and all things that must be in a series are set in order under generals; the setting in order under the generals causes the several things to act as a one, and to be in a form, and to have a quality together. (Concerning generals, that under them are particulars, and under these singulars, see n. 920, 2384, 3739, 4325, 4329, 4345, 4383, 5208, 5339, 6115, 6146.) </p>
