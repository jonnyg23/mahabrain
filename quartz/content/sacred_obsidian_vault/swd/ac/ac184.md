 <p>If the thief be caught. That this signifies remembrance, is evident from the signification of "being caught," when said of truths and knowledges in the memory that have been taken away, as being remembrance; and from the signification of "the thief," as being that which has been taken away; for by "the thief" the like is signified as by "the theft" (see n. 9125, 9126). </p>

 <p>He shall repay double. That this signifies restoration to the full, is evident from the signification of "repaying," as being restoration (see n. 9087); and from the signification of "double," as being to the full (n. 9103). In this verse, and in those which follow, as far as verse 14, the subject treated of in the internal sense is the loss of the truth of faith with a man, thus the loss of spiritual life, and its restoration; for by means of the truths of faith a man is brought into the good of charity, and becomes spiritual. But the things treated of in the internal sense in what now follows are for the most part unknown to man. The reason is that it is not known what spiritual life is, thus neither that spiritual life is an interior life distinct from the natural life, which is exterior. Neither is it known that spiritual life is given by the Lord to man through the reception of the truth of faith in the good of charity. Consequently what is said about the loss of this spiritual life and its restoration falls into thick darkness with a man, because it falls among things of which he has no knowledge. Nevertheless such things make angelic wisdom, for they are suited to the light in which the angels are; and therefore when a man of the church who is in the good of faith reads the Word, angels adjoin themselves to him, and are delighted in the man, because of the wisdom which then inflows to them through the Word from the Lord. From this is the conjunction of heaven with man, which would not be possible without the Word. For the Word is such that there is not even a point or a jot in its original tongue which does not affect the angels, and conjoin them with man. That this is the case I can assever, because it has been shown me from heaven. </p>

 <p>If the thief be not caught. That this signifies if there is no remembrance of that which has been taken away, is evident from the signification of "if the thief be caught," as being the remembrance of that which had been taken away (see n. 9151); here, no remembrance is signified, because it is said, "if the thief be not caught." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9154.">9154.</a></font></span>
 <p>The lord of the house shall be brought unto God. That this signifies a search from good, is evident from the signification of "being brought unto God," as being that a search be made (see n. 9160); and from the signification of "the lord of the house," as being the good from which this is to be done. The reason why "the lord of the house" denotes good, is that the subject treated of is truths and memory-knowledges that have been taken away from the memory, which are signified by "the silver and vessels given to be taken care of, and which have been stolen" (n. 9149, 9150); and as these belong to good, and are in good, therefore "the lord of the house" denotes the good to which they belong, and with which they are. Good is called "a lord," because truths and memory-knowledges belong to good as their lord; and good is also called "a house," because truths and memory-knowledges are in good as in their house, see n. 3652, where are unfolded the words of the Lord in Matthew:      Let he that is upon the roof of the house not go down to take anything out of his house (Matt. 24:17). [2] As to the search about the truths and knowledges taken away from the memory having to be made from good, the case is this. The good with a man is that which receives in itself all truths, for good has its quality from truths; and so far as truths have good in them and also around them, so far they are living. The case is the same as with a fiber or a blood-vessel in a living animal. So far as a fiber has spirit in it, and so far as a vessel has blood in it, so far they live; in like manner does a blood-vessel live insofar as it has around it fibers in which is spirit. It is similar with truth and good, truth without good being like a fiber without spirit, and a vein or an artery without blood, the quality of which everyone can comprehend, namely, that they would be devoid of life, and therefore without any use in a living animal. It is similar in respect to faith without charity. Because, as before said, good has its quality from truths, it has its form also from them; for where there is form there is quality, and where there is no form there is no quality. The case is also like that of spirit and blood in a living animal; spirit receiving its determinations and thus its form through fibers; in like manner the blood through its vessels. From this it is evident that truth without good has no life; and that good without truth has no quality, consequently that faith without charity is not living faith. By faith is here meant the faith of truth, and by charity the life of good.  [3] From all this it can be seen how it is to be understood that a search is to be made from good for the truths and memory-knowledges that have been taken away; namely, that when a man is in good, that is, in the affection of doing good, he then comes into the remembrance of all the truths which have entered into the good; but that when he turns away from good, the truths disappear, for it is the falsity of evil which takes them away as if by theft. But the truths which have disappeared come again into remembrance when the man by his life returns into the affection of good or of truth. That it is so everyone who reflects may know by experience in himself and with others. From this it is evident what is meant by searching from good for the truths and knowledges that have been taken away from the memory or from the mind of a man. </p>

 <p>To see whether he hath put his hand to his companion's work. That this signifies to see whether they have entered into good, is evident from the signification of "whether he hath put his hand," as being whether good has caused to be of its own right and power; and from the signification of "in his companion's work," as being the truth and memory-knowledge which have been taken away; for the silver and vessels that were given to be taken care of, and were stolen, are what are called the "companion's work." (That the "silver and vessels" denote truths and memory-knowledges, see above, n. 9149.) From this it is evident that by "to see whether the lord of the house hath put his hand to his companion's work" is signified whether good has caused to be of its own right and power the truths and memory-knowledges that had been taken away; thus whether these had previously entered into good (according to what was shown just above, n. 9154). (That "the hand" denotes power, see n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937, 5296, 6292, 7188, 7189, 7518, 7673, 8153; also that "in the hand" denotes that which is with anyone and in anyone, n. 9133.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9156.">9156.</a></font></span>
 <p>Upon every word of transgression. That this signifies whatsoever injury and whatsoever loss, is evident from the signification of "transgression," as being everything that is contrary to the truth of faith, thus that injures or extinguishes it, consequently all injury and loss thereof whatsoever. In the Word, evils are sometimes called "sins," sometimes "iniquities," and sometimes "transgressions;" but what is meant specifically by these several terms is not clear except from the internal sense. Those evils are called "transgressions" which are done contrary to the truths of faith; those are called "iniquities," which are done contrary to the goods of faith; and those are called "sins," which are done contrary to the goods of charity and of love. The first two proceed from a perverted understanding, but the last from a depraved will. As in David:      Wash me from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin; for I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me (Ps. 51:2, 3); "iniquity" denotes evil contrary to the goods of faith; "sin," evil contrary to the goods of charity and love; and "transgressions," evil contrary to the truths of faith. As the latter is evil proceeding from a perverted understanding, and thus is known from the truths of faith, it is said, "I acknowledge my transgressions." [2] Again:      Remember, O Jehovah, Thy mercies, and Thy compassions; remember not the sins of my youth, and my transgressions (Ps. 25:6-7); sins" denote evils from a depraved will; and "transgressions," evils from a perverted understanding. In Isaiah:      Behold for iniquities were ye sold, and for transgressions was your mother put away (Isa. 50:1); "iniquities" denote evils contrary to goods, and "transgressions," evils contrary to the truths of faith of the church; the "mother" denotes the church, which is said to be "put away" when it departs from faith. In Micah:      For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sin of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee (Micah 1:5, 13); here in like manner "sin" denotes what is contrary to the good of charity and love; and "transgression" what is contrary to the truth of faith; for "Samaria" denotes the church of perverted faith, and so does "Israel" in this passage. [3] As "transgressions" denote evils that are contrary to the truths of faith, they are also "trespasses" and "revolts," which moreover, in the original tongue are signified by the same expression, as is evident in David:      For the multitude of their transgressions thrust out those who rebel against Thee (Ps. 5:10); "to rebel" is said when there are both revolt and trespass. And in Isaiah:      Are ye not children of transgression, the seed of a lie; who have heated yourselves with gods under every green tree; who slay the children in the rivers? (Isa. 57:4-5). That "transgression" denotes evil contrary to the truths of faith is very evident from these passages, for the "children of transgression" denote the falsities which destroy the truths of faith; and therefore they are also called "the seed of a lie," for "a lie" denotes falsity (n. 8908); and therefore it is said of them that they "heat themselves with gods under every green tree," by which in the internal sense is meant worship from falsities; for "gods" denote falsities (n. 4402, 4544, 7873, 8867); and a "green tree," the perception of falsity from a perverted understanding (n. 2722, 4552); and therefore it is also said "ye slay the children in the rivers," by which is meant the extinction of the truths of faith by means of falsities; for "to slay" denotes to extinguish; "children" or "sons" denote the truths of faith (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2813, 3373); and "rivers" denote falsities (n. 6693). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9157.">9157.</a></font></span>
 <p>Upon ox, upon ass, upon one of the small cattle. That this signifies of good and of truth exterior and interior, that is, their injury or loss, is evident from the signification of "ox" and "ass," as being exterior good and truth; and from the signification of "small cattle," as being interior truth and good (see above, n. 9135). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9158.">9158.</a></font></span>
 <p>Upon garment. That this signifies of sensuous truth, is evident from the signification of "garment," as being truth (see n. 4545, 4763, 5319, 5954, 6914, 6918). In general "garment" denotes the exterior or lower truth which covers interior or higher truths (n. 297, 2576, 5248, 6918); here therefore sensuous truth, because this is the outermost or lowest (n. 5081, 5125, 5767, 6564, 6614). That "garments" denote truths has its origin from the representatives in the other life; for spirits and angels all appear clothed in garments in accordance with the truths of faith they have (n. 165, 5248, 5954). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9159.">9159.</a></font></span>
 <p>Upon every lost thing, whereof he shall say, This is it. That this signifies everything doubtful, is evident from the signification of "what is lost," as being everything that has suffered injury or loss; and from the signification of "whereof he saith, This is it," as being that which is doubtful, for the words "of which he shall say, This is it" denote whether it is so or not, and therefore it comes under investigation and judgment. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9160.">9160.</a></font></span>
 <p>Even unto God shall come the word of them both; he whom God shall condemn. That this signifies a searching and a judging by means of truth, is evident from the signification of "even unto God shall come the word," as being a searching by means of truth (of which below); and from the signification of "condemning," as being a judging and awarding of the penalty to him who has transgressed. That "even unto God shall come the word" signifies a searching by means of truth, is because "coming to God" denotes to come to the judges, who from truth were to search concerning this matter. Therefore also it is said "he whom God shall condemn," with the verb in the plural number. Moreover, in the original tongue God is called El, in the singular number, but more frequently Elohim, in the plural; for the reason that the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is shared in heaven in many ways among the angels; for as many as are the angels, so many are the recipients of truth Divine, each in his own manner (n. 3241, 3744-3746, 3986, 4149, 5598, 7236, 7833, 7836). Hence it is that the angels are called "gods" (n. 4295, 4402, 7268, 7873, 8301); and also "judges," because the judges were not to judge from themselves, but from the Lord. They judged also from the law of Moses, and thus from the Word which is from the Lord. Even at this day judgment is administered from the Lord when it is done from conscience, in accordance with truths. [2] In the Word the Lord is called "God" from the Divine truth which proceeds from Him; and "Jehovah" from the Divine good (n. 4402, 6303, 6905, 7268, 8988). Hence where good is treated of in the Word, the Lord is called "Jehovah," and "God" where truth is treated of (n. 2586, 2769, 2807, 2822, 3921, 4402, 7268, 8988); thus "God" denotes truth (n. 4287, 7010, 7268). From all this it is now evident what is signified by "if the thief be not caught, the lord of the house shall be brought unto God" (verse 7); and here by "even unto God shall come the word of them both, and he whom God shall condemn, shall repay;" and also what is signified by "God" in the following passages:      Aaron shall speak for thee unto the people; and it shall come to pass that he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou shall be to him for God (Exod. 4:16); that "Moses" denotes the Divine truth, or the Law; and that "for a mouth" denotes the doctrine therefrom, which was represented by Aaron, see n. 7010. Again: Jehovah said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet (Exod. 7:1; n. 7265). And in the first book of Samuel: Aforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come and let us go to the Seer; for he that is now called the prophet was beforetime called the seer (1 Sam. 9:9); where "the Seer" and "the prophet" denote truth Divine, and the doctrine of truth and good thence derived (n. 2534, 7269). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9161.">9161.</a></font></span>
 <p>Shall repay double to his companion. That this signifies amendment to the full, is evident from the signification of "repaying" as being amendment (n. 9097); and from the signification of "double," as being to the full (n. 9103). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9162.">9162.</a></font></span>
 <p>When a man shall give to his companion an ass, or an ox, or one of the small cattle, or any beast, to take care of. That this signifies truth and good exterior and interior, and everything that belongs to the affection of them in the memory, is evident from the signification of "an ass, an ox, and one of the small cattle," as being truth exterior and interior (see above, n. 9135); from the signification of a "beast," as being the affection of good and truth (n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714-716, 719, 1823, 2179, 2180, 2781, 3218, 3519, 5198, 7424, 7523, 9090); and from the signification of "giving to take care of," as being to be stored up and kept in the memory (of which above, n. 9149). (That "a man" and "his companion" are not one and another, but two in one, see n. 9149.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9163.">9163.</a></font></span>
 <p>And it die or be broken. That this signifies loss or injury, is evident from the signification of "dying," as being extinction and loss; and from the signification of "to be broken," as being injury. In the Word "a breach," and "to be broken," signifies dispersion and also injury. This has its origin from the spiritual world, where each and all things are conjoined according to the reception of truth Divine from the Lord, thus according to the reception of order, which is induced on each and all things through the truth Divine which proceeds from the Lord (see n. 8700, 8988). From this it is that the truths in a man have a connection one with another according to their reception in good. Truths which are so connected make a one; and therefore when they are broken in general, the truths together with the good are dispersed; and when they are broken in particular, the truths which are there are dispersed. For while they are in connection, the one subsists from the other; but when they are broken, the one recedes from the other. It is from this that in the Word by "being broken," as also by "being divided," is signified dispersion (n. 9093), and likewise injury. [2] Dispersion is signified when the whole is broken, and injury when a part is broken, as is evident from the following passages in the Word. In Isaiah:      Many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken (Isa. 8:15; 28:13); "to stumble" denotes to be induced to commit evil, and thus to fall from truths into falsities; "to fall and be broken" denotes to be dispersed, here in general. In Ezekiel:      Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt; I will break his arms, the strong, and that which is broken (Ezek. 30:22); "Pharaoh king of Egypt" denotes the memory-knowledges that pervert and destroy the truths and goods of faith (n. 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692); "to break his arms" denotes to disperse their strength, and thus these memory-knowledges (n. 4932); "the strong, and that which is broken" denote those things which not having suffered injury, resist, and those which having suffered injury do not resist. [3] In Luke:      It is written, The stone which the builders rejected hath become the head of the corner; whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken, and on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder (Luke 20:17-18); "the stone" denotes the Lord as to Divine truth (n. 6426); and "to be broken," being said of the truths which are from Him, denotes to be dispersed, and thus to be destroyed; and together with the truths, those things which are of the spiritual life; as comes to pass with those who deny the Lord and discard the truths which are from Him, and these are they who "reject the stone." In Jeremiah:      Bring upon them the day of evil, and break them with a double breaking (Jer. 17:18); "to break with a double breaking" denotes to utterly destroy. [4] Again:      I disposed myself even unto the morning; as a lion, so He breaketh all my bones; from day even to night Thou wilt make an end of me (Isa. 38:13).      My flesh and my skin hath He made old, and hath broken my bones (Lam. 3:4).      Thou shalt not carry forth out of the house any of the flesh of the paschal lamb, neither shall ye break a bone in it (Exod. 12:46). "To break the bones" denotes to destroy the truths from the Divine which are the last in order, and on which interior truths and goods rest, and by which they are supported; for if these are destroyed, those things also fall which are built upon them. The truths last in order are those of the literal sense of the Word, within which are the truths of the internal sense; and upon which these latter rest as columns on their bases. (That "bones" denote truths, see n. 3812, 6592, 8005.) From all this it is evident what was represented and signified by what is written concerning the Lord in John:      They came to Jesus, and when they saw that He was dead, they broke not His legs. This came to pass that the Scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of Him ye shall not break (John 19:33, 36). The reason was that He was the Divine truth itself in the first as well as in the last of order. [5] Again:      Jehovah shall bind up the breach of His people, and shall heal the wound of their blow (Isa. 30:26).      From the prophet even unto the priest everyone maketh a lie, and they heal the breach by a thing of no weight (Jer. 6:13-14).      For the breach of My people am I broken, I am in black (Jer. 8:21).       Thou hast made the earth to tremble; Thou hast broken it; heal the breaches thereof (Ps. 60:2).      I will stir up a shepherd in the land; he shall not heal the broken one, he shall not uphold that which standeth (Zech. 11:16).      There is no scar of thy breach; thy blow is desperate (Nah. 3:19). In these passages a "breach" signifies injury done to the truths and goods of faith, and thus to the church; "healing" denotes amending and restoration. The like was signified by the words:      A man that is brokenfooted or brokenhanded shall not come nigh to offer the bread of God (Lev. 21:17, 19).      That which is broken shall not be offered upon the altar unto Jehovah (Lev. 22:22); for "that which is broken" signified that which is destroyed. Injury is signified also by a "fracture," as in these passages:      Ye have seen the fractures of the house of David, that they are many (Isa. 22:9).      In that day will I raise up the tent of David that is fallen, and close up the fractures thereof; I will set up again its ruins, and I will build them as in the days of eternity (Amos 9:11); "the house of David," and "the tent of David," denote the church of the Lord, for "David," in the prophetic Word, denotes the Lord (n. 1888). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9164.">9164.</a></font></span>
 <p>Or be led away captive. That this signifies removal, is evident from the signification of "to be led away captive," when predicated of the good and truth with man, as being removal. The case herein is as follows. When a man is in truth from good, then that truth in which he has the greatest faith is in the middle; next follow the truths in which he has less faith; and finally those which are of doubtful faith. In the borders round about are falsities, which, however, are not in a series with the truths, and do not stand upright toward heaven as do the truths of good; but are bent downward, and look toward hell insofar as they come forth from evil. But when falsity usurps the place of truth, the order is inverted, and the truths pass off to the sides, and form the circumference, while the falsities of evil occupy the middle. From this it is evident what is here meant by "removal" (on which see n. 3436, 6084, 6103). That such a removal is signified by "being led away captive," is because when falsities take truths captive, they lead them away in this manner. Such also is the signification of "being taken captive," or "being led away captive," in Jeremiah:      The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall be led away into captivity (Jer. 22:22).      Woe to thee, O Moab! The people of Chemosh hath perished; for thy sons have been led away into captivity, and thy daughters into captivity. Yet will I bring back the captivity of Moab in the end of the days (Jer. 48:46-47); the "sons who were led away into captivity" denote truths; and the "daughters," goods. And in Luke:      They shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive among all the nations; and finally Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the nations (Luke 21:24); speaking of the consummation of the age, which is the last time of the church. "To fall by the edge of the sword" denotes to perish through falsities, for "the sword" denotes falsity fighting against truth (n. 2799, 4499, 6353, 7102, 8294); "the nations among whom they were to be led away captive," and by whom the church would be "trodden down," denote evils from which are falsities (n. 1259, 1260, 1849, 1868, 6306); that "Jerusalem," which should then be trodden down, denotes the church, see n. 2117, 3654. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9165.">9165.</a></font></span>
 <p>No one seeing it. That this signifies of which the mind is not conscious, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being to understand, and also to have faith (n. 2325, 2807, 3863, 3869, 4403-4421, 5114, 5400); and as the understanding is the sight of the mind, "to see" denotes that the mind is conscious; here that the mind is not conscious, because it is said, "no one seeing it." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9166.">9166.</a></font></span>
 <p>The oath of Jehovah shall be between them both. That this signifies a search by means of truths from the Word in respect to each and all of these things, is evident from the signification of an "oath," as being confirmation by means of truths (see n. 2842, 3037, 3375), thus "the oath of Jehovah" denotes by means of truths from the Word, for in the Word are the truths of Jehovah, or truths Divine; and from the signification of "them both," as being in each and all things, for in the internal sense "between both" does not signify between two persons, but in each and all things, for "two" denotes conjunction into one (n. 1686, 3519, 5194, 8423), thus whatsoever is in the one, or each and all things therein. That these things are perceived in heaven by "two," is because when the angels are conversing about two truths which do not agree together, there are presented below two debating spirits, who are the subjects of a number of societies. With the one spirit appear each and all things that belong to the one truth, and with the other spirit each and all things that belong to the other truth; and in this way it is perceived how these truths may be conjoined. That this is so I have been given to know from experience. Hence it is that by "two" is also signified what is full (n. 9103). [2] The reason why it was allowable for the Israelitish and Jewish nation to swear by Jehovah, was that they were not internal, but external men; and while they were in Divine worship, they were in the external apart from the internal. (That such was their nature, see n. 4281, 4293, 4429, 4433, 4680, 4844, 4847, 4865, 4903, 6304, 8588, 8788, 8806.) When the confirmation of truth descends into the external man separated from the internal, it is effected by an oath. It is otherwise when it descends into the external through the internal; for in the internal man truth appears in its own light, but in the external apart from the internal man, truth appears in darkness. From this it is that the celestial angels, who are in the inmost or third heaven, being in the highest light, do not even confirm truths by reasons, still less do they debate or reason about them, but merely say Yea, or Nay. This is because they perceive and see truths from the Lord. [3] Therefore the Lord said concerning oaths:      Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not forswear thyself; but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is God's throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your speech be, Yea, yea; nay, nay; whatsoever is more than these is from evil (Matt. 5:33-37). These words involve that truths Divine are to be confirmed from the Lord, and not from man, which is effected when men are internal, and not external; for external men confirm truths by oaths, but internal men by reasons. They who are still more internal do not confirm them; but only say that it is so, or that it is not so. External men are they who are called natural men; internal men are they who are called spiritual men; and still more internal men are they who are called celestial men. (That these celestial men perceive from the Lord whether a thing is true or not, see n. 2708, 2715, 2718, 3246, 4448, 7877.) From all this it is evident what is involved in the Lord's saying, "Swear not at all," and "Let your speech be, Yea, yea; nay, nay." But it shall be explained why He also said that they should not swear by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by Jerusalem, nor by the head, and that any speech more than yea, yea, and nay, nay, is from evil. [4] "To swear by heaven" denotes by the Divine truth, and thus by the Lord in heaven; for heaven is not heaven from the angels regarded in themselves, but from the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and thus from the Lord in them; for it is the Divine in them that causes them to be, and to be called, angels of heaven. From this it is that they who are in heaven are said to be "in the Lord;" also that the Lord is everything in each and all things of heaven; and likewise that the angels are truths Divine, because they are recipients of truth Divine from the Lord. (That heaven is, and is called, heaven, from the Divine of the Lord therein, see n. 552, 3038, 3700; also that the angels are truths Divine, n. 4295, 4402, 7268, 7873, 8301; and that something of the Lord is meant in the Word by an "angel," n. 1925, 2821, 3039, 4085, 4295, 6280.) Because heaven is the Lord as to Divine truth, it is said, "thou shalt not swear by heaven, for it is God's throne," for "God's throne" denotes the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord (see n. 5313, 6397, 9039). [5] But "to swear by the earth" denotes by the church, and thus by the Divine truth therein; for as heaven is the Lord by virtue of the Divine truth which proceeds from Him, so also is the church, because the church is the Lord's heaven, or His kingdom, on earth ("earth" in the Word being the church, n. 662, 1066, 1262, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 3355, 4535, 4447, 5577, 8011, 8732). And as "the earth" denotes the church, wherein is the Divine of the Lord beneath heaven, it is therefore said, "thou shalt not swear by the earth, for it is God's footstool." "The footstool" denotes truth Divine under heaven, such as is the Word in the literal sense, for upon this sense rests, and as it were stands, the truth Divine in heaven, which is the Word in the internal sense. This truth is signified by "footstool" in David (Ps. 99:5; 132:7); in Isaiah (60:13); and in the Lamentations of Jeremiah (2:1). [6] "To swear by Jerusalem" denotes by the doctrine of truth from the Word, for "Jerusalem" in a wide sense denotes the church (n. 2117, 3654). But when mention is made of "the earth," which denotes the church, and afterward of "Jerusalem," then by "Jerusalem" is signified the doctrine of the church, consequently the doctrine of truth Divine from the Word. Hence it is that it is called "the city of the great King," for by "a city" in the Word in its internal sense is signified the doctrine of truth (see n. 402, 2449, 2943, 3216, 4478, 4492, 4493). [7] "To swear by one's own head" denotes by the truth which the man himself believes to be truth, and which he makes of his faith, for this makes the head with the man, and is also signified by the "head" in Isa. 15:2; 29:10; Ezek. 7:18; 13:18; 16:12; 29:18; Matt. 6:17; and elsewhere. Wherefore it is also said, "for thou canst not make one hair white or black," for "hair" denotes the truth of the external or natural man (n. 3301), such as those have who are in the faith of truth, not because they perceive it to be truth, but because the doctrine of the church so teaches. And because they do not know it from any other source, it is said that they "shall not swear by it, because they cannot make one hair white or black." "To make a hair white" denotes to declare from one's self that truth is truth; and "to make a hair black" denotes to declare from one's self that falsity is falsity; for "white" is predicated of truth (n. 3301, 3993, 4007, 5319), and consequently "black" is predicated of falsity. [8] From all this it is now evident what is meant by "not swearing at all, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by Jerusalem, nor by one's own head," namely, that truth Divine is not to be confirmed from man, but from the Lord in man. On this account it is lastly said, "let your speech be, Yea, yea; nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these is from evil." For they who perceive and see truth from the Lord, do not otherwise confirm it; as is the case with the angels of the inmost or third heaven, who are called celestial angels, and are spoken of above. The reason why speech more than this is from evil, is that what is more than this is not from the Lord, but from man's own, thus from evil, for man's own is nothing but evil (n. 210, 215, 874-876, 987, 1023, 1044, 1047, 3812, 4328, 5660, 8941, 8944). From all this it is again evident in what manner the Lord spoke, namely, so that in each and all things there is an internal sense; because He spoke from the Divine, and thus for the angels at the same time as for men, for the angels perceive the Word according to its internal sense. </p>

 <p>To see whether he hath put his hand to his companion's work, or whether its lord hath taken it. That this signifies conjunction under good, is evident from the signification of "to see whether he hath put his hand to his companion's work," when this is said of truth and good exterior and interior, as being to see whether these have entered into good (see above, n. 9155), and thus whether they have been conjoined under good (what conjunction under good is, see n. 9154); and from the signification of "lord," as being good (n. 9154). Thus "to see whether its lord hath taken it" denotes to see whether good has made them its own by conjunction. That "the lord" denotes good is because with a spiritual man good is in the first place, and truth in the second; and that which is in the first place is the lord. [2] Moreover, all the truths with a man are arranged in accordance with the quality of the good, just as a house is arranged by its lord. From this it is that by "Lord" in the Word is meant the Lord as to Divine good, and by "God," "King," and "Master," the Lord as to Divine truth; as in the following passages:      Jehovah your God, He is God of gods, and Lord of lords (Deut. 10:17).      The Lamb shall overcome them, for He is Lord of lords, and King of kings (Rev. 17:14).      He hath upon His garment and upon His thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords (Rev. 19:16). (That the Lord is called "God" in respect to Divine truth, see n. 2586, 2769, 2807, 2822, 4402, 7268, 8988; and that He is also called "King" in respect to Divine truth, n. 2015, 3009, 3670, 4581, 4966, 5068, 6148.) From this it is evident that the Lord is called "Lord" in respect to Divine good, for where truth is spoken of in the Word, good is also spoken of (n. 683, 793, 801, 2516, 2618, 2712, 2803, 3004, 4138, 5138, 5502, 6343, 8339). In John:      Ye call Me Master and Lord; and ye say well, for so I am. I, the Lord and Master, have washed your feet (John 13:13-14); here also the Lord is called "Lord" from Divine good, and "Master" from Divine truth. In Malachi:      The Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the Angel of the covenant whom ye desire (Mal. 3:1); speaking of the coming of the Lord, and He is called "Lord" from Divine good, and "Angel" from Divine truth (n. 1925, 2821, 3039, 4085, 4295, 6280). [3] From this it is that in the Old Testament He is so often called "the Lord Jehovih," and this when supplication is made, by which is meant "Good Jehovah" (n. 1793, 2921); and that in the New Testament He is called "Lord" instead of "Jehovah" (n. 2921). From all this it can also be known what is meant by these words in Matthew:      No man can serve two lords; for either he will hate the one, and love the other (Matt. 6:24); "two lords" denote good and evil, for a man must be either in good or in evil; he cannot be in both together. He can be in many truths, provided they have been set in order under one good; for good makes heaven with man, but evil makes hell, and a man must be either in heaven or in hell, and cannot be in both, nor between the two. From this then it is evident what is meant in the Word by "Lord." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9168.">9168.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he shall not repay. That this signifies that there is no injury, is evident from the signification of "repaying," as being amendment, and also restoration (n. 9087, 9097); consequently "not to repay" denotes no restoration, and no amendment, because there is no injury. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9169.">9169.</a></font></span>
 <p>And if stealing it shall be stolen from him. That this signifies if there is loss, is evident from the signification of "theft," as being the taking away of good and truth (see n. 9125), thus loss. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9170.">9170.</a></font></span>
 <p>He shall repay to its lord. That this signifies restoration in the place of it, is evident from the signification of "repaying," as being restoration (see n. 9087); and from the signification of "lord," as being good (n. 9167). Thus by "he shall repay to its lord," is signified the restoration of truth to good in the place of that which had been taken away. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9171.">9171.</a></font></span>
 <p>If tearing it shall be torn. That this signifies if the injury is not of fault, is evident from the signification of "torn," as being injury done by falsities from evil without one's fault (see n. 4171, 5828). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9172.">9172.</a></font></span>
 <p>He shall bring a witness for it. That this signifies that this is confirmed, is evident from the signification of "witness," as being confirmation (see n. 4197). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9173.">9173.</a></font></span>
 <p>He shall not repay that which was torn. That this signifies no penalty, that is, for the injury done without fault, is evident from the signification of "torn," as being injury without fault (as just above, n. 9171); and from the signification of "repaying," as being the penalty (n. 9102), here no penalty, because it is said "he shall not repay." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9174.">9174.</a></font></span>
 <p>And when a man shall borrow from his companion. That this signifies truth and good from another stock, is evident from the signification of "borrowing," as being to receive truth from some other source than one's self, and thus truth from another stock. "Borrowing" has this signification because in the spiritual world there are no other goods that are asked from others, and given, than those which are of intelligence and wisdom. There are indeed many other things offered to view, nay, things innumerable, but they are appearances arising from those things which are of intelligence and wisdom. From this it is evident that "to borrow" denotes to be instructed by another, and thus to receive truths, or knowledges of truth and good, from some other source than one's self. How this is shall be further explained. A man is said to receive truths from himself when he infers them from the truths he has with him. In this case he conjoins them with those he formerly possessed. But in doing this he admits only those truths which agree together under the same good; for it is good that disposes truths into series and connects them together. Good is like the soul in man, and truths are like those things with which the soul clothes itself, and by means of which it acts. It is well known that each and all things in man live from his soul; and so also do the truths of faith live from the good of love to the Lord and of love toward the neighbor. If this good is not the soul of a man, but the good of the love of self or the love of the world, then the man is not a man, but a wild beast, and in the other life in the light of heaven he also appears as a wild beast; though in his own light, which at the approach of the light of heaven becomes thick darkness, he appears as a man. It is, however, to be understood that the Lord disposes truths into order in accordance with the good of the man's life. [2] A man is said to receive truths from some other source, when he is instructed by another; and if these truths do not agree together under the good in which he is, they are indeed stored up in his memory among memory-knowledges; but they do not become his - that is, of his faith - because they are of another stock. These are the truths which are treated of in this verse and the following one. [3] When "borrowing" and "lending" are mentioned in the Word, there is signified to be instructed and to instruct from the affection of charity; as in Matthew:      Give to everyone that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away (Matt. 5:42); it is evident that "asking" here does not mean asking, for it is said, "Give to everyone that asketh"; and that neither by "borrowing" is meant borrowing; for if a person were to give to everyone that asketh, and also to everyone that would borrow, he would be stripped of all his goods. But as the Lord spoke from the Divine, by "asking," and "wishing to borrow;" and by giving and receiving a loan, is meant the communication of heavenly goods, which are those of the knowledges of good and truth; for in regard to such a communication the fact is that the more an angel gives to another from the affection of charity, the more there flows in with him of the general good from heaven, that is, from the Lord (n. 6478). Thus by "giving to him that asketh," an angel is not deprived of goods, but is enriched with them. The case is the same with a man, when he does good to another from the affection of charity; but charity consists in giving to the good, and it is not charity to give to the evil what they ask and desire (n. 8120); according to these words in David:      The wicked borroweth, and restoreth not; but the righteous showeth mercy and giveth (Ps. 37:21). And in Luke:      If ye lend to them from whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? Rather love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hope for nothing again; then shall your reward be great, and ye shall be the sons of the Highest (Luke 6:34-35). [4] Here also by "lending" is meant doing good from the affection of charity, and thus communicating the goods of heaven; and also the goods of the world, but the latter for the sake of the former as the end in view. The affection of charity consists in communicating goods without any recompense as the end in view; but there is no affection of charity in communicating goods for the sake of recompense as the end in view (n. 2373, 2400, 3816, 3956, 4943, 6388-6390, 6392, 6393, 6478, 8002). The affection of charity consists in loving one's enemies, and in benefiting the evil; but enemies are loved and are benefited when they are instructed, and also when they are corrected by suitable means (n. 8121). [5] The exercise of charity is also signified by "lending," in Moses:      If thou shalt obey the voice of Jehovah, and shalt observe to do His commandments, thou shalt lend to many peoples, but thou shalt not borrow (Deut. 28:1, 12); "to lend to many peoples" denotes to abound in the goods of intelligence and wisdom, and to communicate them to others out of this abundance; and not to be in need of the goods of others, because all things are given him by the Lord. So in David:      A good man who hath mercy and lendeth, will maintain his words in judgment; for he will never be moved (Ps. 112:5-6); by "having mercy and lending" is described the state of those who are in genuine charity. In like manner, Psalm 37:21; and other passages. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9175.">9175.</a></font></span>
 <p>And it be broken or die. That this signifies injury to it, or extinction, is evident from the signification of "to be broken," as being injury (see n. 9163); and from the signification of "dying," as being extinction. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9176.">9176.</a></font></span>
 <p>Its lord not being with it. That this signifies if the good of this truth is not together with it in the general form, is evident from the signification of "the lord," as being good (see n. 9167); and from the signification of "not being with it," as being not together with it in the general form. How the case herein is can be seen from what was shown above (n. 9154), about truths in good, namely, that all the truths in the general form are disposed under their good. But the subject here treated of is truths "borrowed," that is, received from others (n. 9174), and these truths either have their good with them, or they have it not. The truths that have their good with them, are those which when heard affect the man; but those which have it not, are those which do not affect him. The truths which have their good with them, are meant by the borrowed things that are broken or die when their lord is with them. But the truths which have not their good with them, are meant by the borrowed things that are broken or die when their lord is not with them.  [2] These latter truths can indeed be described, but not to the apprehension, except that of those who are in the light of heaven from the Lord. All others, who see only by the light of this world, that is, by natural light, will fail to comprehend them, because in respect to heavenly things they are in thick darkness; and if they seem to themselves to comprehend them, it is nevertheless from fallacies and things material, which rather cause obscurity and envelope in shadows, than impart light. It is enough to know that the subject treated of is truths of faith conjoined with their good, and not conjoined with it. Truths not conjoined are those learned from others, which enter no further than into the memory, and abide there as memory-knowledges, and are not perceived among those truths which are set in order in a general form under good. From all this it can in some measure be known in what angelic wisdom consists; for the angels not only comprehend how the case is with these things, but also at the same time countless things about them; and thus things of which a man does not even know that they exist, and still less what they are; for the angels are in the light of heaven, and the light of heaven has within itself infinite things, because the light of heaven is the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord. </p>

 <p>Repaying he shall repay. That this signifies restoration, is evident from the signification of "repaying," as being restoration (see n. 9087). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9178.">9178.</a></font></span>
 <p>If the lord thereof be with it, he shall not repay. That this signifies that if the good of truth be together with it, there shall be no restoration, is evident from the signification of "if the lord be with it," as being if the good of truth be together with it (of which above, n. 9176); and from the signification of "repaying," as being restoration (as just above, n. 9177); thus "not to repay" denotes that there shall be no restoration. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9179.">9179.</a></font></span>
 <p>If a hireling be with it. That this signifies if it is for the sake of the good of self-advantage, is evident from the signification of "a hireling," as being one who does what is good for the sake of self-advantage, or for the sake of reward (see n. 8002); thus in the abstract sense it signifies the good of self-advantage, or reward. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9180.">9180.</a></font></span>
 <p>He shall come in his hire. That this signifies submission and service, is evident from the signification of "coming in his hire," as being to submit one's self and serve. The case herein is this. Those who learn and draw forth truths from the Word, or from the doctrine of the church, or from anyone soever, or even by means of inferences, from themselves, for the sake of self-advantage, that is, in order that they may acquire honors or wealth, or that they may merit heaven; are those who are meant in the internal sense by "hirelings who shall come in their hire," that is, who will submit themselves and serve. For self-advantage ought to be in the last place with the man of the church, and not in the first. When it is in the last place, it is a servant; but if it is in the first place, it is a lord. He who regards self-advantage in the first place is an inverted man, and in the other life is also represented as being so, with his head in hell; but he who regards charity and faith in the first place, and thus the Lord and the neighbor, is an upright man, and in the other life is represented as standing so, with his head in heaven. From this it is evident what is meant by good done for the sake of self-advantage; and that this good must submit itself and serve, which things are signified by "if a hireling be with it, he shall come in his hire." </p>

 <p>Verses 15, 16. When a man shall persuade a virgin who is not betrothed, and shall lie with her, endowing he shall endow her to himself for a woman. If refusing her father shall refuse to give her to him, he shall pay silver according to the dowry of virgins. "When a man shall persuade a virgin who is not betrothed," signifies good not conjoined with truth: "and shall lie with her," signifies unlawful conjunction; "endowing he shall endow her to himself for a woman," signifies a token of consent to a lawful conjunction; "if refusing her father shall refuse to give her to him," signifies if interior good does not allow conjunction; "he shall pay silver according to the dowry of virgins," signifies other truth consenting in its place. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9182.">9182.</a></font></span>
 <p>When a man shall persuade a virgin who is not betrothed. That this signifies good not conjoined with truth, is evident from the signification of "persuading," when said of a man and a virgin, as being to entice to conjunction; from the signification of "a man" [vir] as being truth (see n. 3134, 7716, 9007); from the signification of "a virgin," as being the church as to good (n. 3081, 4638), thus the good which is the church; and from the signification of "to be betrothed," as being conjunction. It shall here be briefly stated what is the cause and the origin of the law relating to unlawful conjunction that is here treated of. All the laws delivered to the sons of Israel have their cause in heaven, and their origin in the laws of order there. All the laws of order in heaven are from the Divine truth and good which proceed from the Lord, consequently they are the laws of the good of love and truth of faith. The conjunction of good and truth in heaven is called the heavenly marriage, and this is represented in marriages on earth, and is also signified by "marriages" in the Word. From this it is plain what is involved in unlawful conjunctions, and also in scortations and adulteries. In these two verses an unlawful conjunction is treated of which is afterward either made lawful or is dissolved. The unlawful conjunction which afterward is made lawful, is the subject treated of in this verse; and the unlawful conjunction which afterward is dissolved, is the subject treated of in the following verse.  [2] Unlawful conjunction is that which is not made from conjugial affection; but from some other affection, as the affection of beauty, the affection of gain, or the affection of personal rank; and also which is made from lasciviousness. In the beginning these conjunctions are unlawful, because that which conjoins is external, and not at the same time internal. Nevertheless, a lawful conjunction may afterward be effected from them as means, which takes place when the minds are conjoined; and on the other hand no conjunction may result from them, as is the case when the minds are disjoined. That this is so, is generally known in the world. [3] Lawful conjunction, which is that of minds, is effected when both are in the like good and truth; for good and truth make a man's life; moral and civil good and truth, the life of the external man; and spiritual good and truth, the life of the internal man. Be it known that a man's life is from no other source than good and truth, for all that a man loves is called good, and all that he believes is called truth; or, what is the same, all that a man wills is called good, and all that he understands is called truth. From this it is evident that a lawful conjunction is effected when the husband is in truth, and the wife is in the corresponding good, for in this way the heavenly marriage, which is that of good and truth, is represented in the pair. From this it is that conjugial love descends from this marriage (see n. 2727-2759, 2803, 3132, 4434, 4835). [4] From these as premises it can be known how the case is with the conjunctions treated of in this verse and the following one. Betrothals before marriage have been in use from ancient times, and represented the first conjunction, which is that of the internal man apart from the external. The subsequent marriages themselves represented the second conjunction, which is that of the internal man with the external; for during man's regeneration by means of the goods and truths of faith, the internal man is first regenerated, and afterward the external, because the latter is regenerated by the former (n. 3286, 3321, 3493, 3882, 8746). [5] From this it is evident what is signified in the Word by "betrothing" and by "being betrothed," and also what by "bridegroom" and "bride;" namely, by "betrothing" is signified the conjunction of truth and good in the internal man; by "bridegroom" (where the Lord and the church are treated of) is signified good; and by "bride," truth: as in the following passages. In Jeremiah:      I remembered for thee the mercy of thy youth, the love of thy betrothals, when thou wentest after Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown (Jer. 2:2); speaking of the Ancient Church and of its being set up by the Lord; "the love of betrothals" denotes the affection of spiritual life, which is from the truths of faith and the good of love; and the state of desire, when as yet they were in ignorance and in want of these things, is signified by "going after Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown." [6] In Hosea:      In that day I will make a covenant for them with the wild animal of the field, and with the bird of the heavens, and the creeping thing of the earth; and I will break the bow and the sword and the war; and I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness and in judgment, and in mercy, and in compassions (Hos. 2:18-19); the setting up of a new church is here treated of; "to make a covenant with the wild animal of the field, with the bird of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of the earth," denotes the conjunction of the Lord through the internal and external good and truth in a man. That "a covenant" denotes conjunction, see n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804, 8767, 8778; "the wild animal of the field" denotes life from good (n. 841, 908); "the bird" denotes the life of truth (n. 40, 745, 776, 991, 3219, 5149, 7441); "the creeping thing of the earth" denotes the goods and truths of the external and sensuous man (n. 746, 909); "to break the bow, and the sword, and the war," denotes to destroy the doctrine and the forces of falsity; "the bow" denotes the doctrine of falsity (n. 2686, 2709); "the sword," falsity fighting against truth (n. 2799, 4499, 6353, 7102); "the war," the combat itself, or spiritual combat (n. 1664, 2686, 8273), and "to break" these denotes to destroy them. [7] "To betroth in righteousness and in judgment" denotes to be conjoined with the Lord in good and truth; "to betroth" denotes to conjoin with one's self; "righteousness" is predicated of good, and "judgment" of truth (n. 2235); "to betroth in mercy and in compassions," denotes doing so from love toward those who are in good, and in love toward those who are in truths; the Lord's "mercy" is predicated as being directed toward those who are in need of good and who yet long for it; and His "compassions," toward those who are in ignorance of truth and who yet long for it. From all this it is evident that "betrothal" denotes the conjunction of good and truth with a man by the Lord. Everyone can see that such things are here signified; for it is clear even to the perception from merely natural light that Jehovah does not make a covenant with the wild animal of the field, with the bird, and with the creeping thing of the earth; but with those who are in the good and truth of faith, thus with the good and truth in the man; consequently that such things are hidden in this prophecy. [8] And in Malachi:      Judah hath dealt treacherously, for he hath profaned the holiness of Jehovah, in that he hath loved, and hath betrothed to himself, the daughter of a strange god (Mal. 2:11); "to betroth the daughter of a strange god" denotes to be conjoined with the evil of falsity; "a strange god" denotes falsity (n. 4402, 4544, 7873). [9] That where the Lord and the church are treated of, the "bridegroom" denotes good, and the "bride" truth, may be seen in the following passages:      Jehovah hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, He hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom putteth on his headdress, and as a bride adorneth herself with her vessels (Isa. 61:10).      I saw the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband (Rev. 21:2).      The angel said, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the lamb's wife (Rev. 21:9); where "the bride" denotes the church. [10] In Matthew:      Jesus said unto the disciples of John, Can the sons of the wedding mourn, so long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast (Matt. 9:15, and Luke 5:34-35); those are called "sons of the wedding" who are in the truths of the church, and receive good, for the good which is from the Lord is "the bridegroom;" that "the sons of the wedding do not mourn so long as the bridegroom is with them" denotes that they are in a blessed and happy state, thus with the Lord, when they are in truths conjoined with their good; "they shall fast when the bridegroom is taken away from them" denotes that they are in an unhappy state when good is no longer conjoined with truths; this state is the last state of the church, but the former is its first state. [11] The like is signified in Matthew 25:1-12 by the bridegroom whom the ten virgins went forth to meet; for the virgins who had oil in their lamps denote those who have good in their truths, but those who had no oil in their lamps denote those who have no good in their truths (see n. 4638; and that "oil" denotes the good of love, n. 886, 3728, 4582). [12] In John:      John said, I am not the Christ, but I am sent before Him. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy because of the bridegroom's voice (John 3:28-29); "the bride" denotes the truth of faith of the church; and "the bridegroom" the good of love of the church, both from the Lord; thus they denote the man of the church with whom good has been conjoined with truths. From all this it is also plain what is meant in the internal sense by the "joy" and the "voice of the bridegroom and of the bride" in Isa. 62:5; Jer. 7:34; 16:9; 25:10; 33:11; Rev. 18:23; namely, heaven and the happiness resulting from the conjunction of good and truth with man and angel. </p>

 <p>And shall lie with her. That this signifies unlawful conjunction, is evident from the signification of "lying with a virgin not betrothed," as being an unlawful conjunction; for by "being betrothed" is signified the conjunction of the internal man; but by "lying with" is signified the conjunction of the external man (of which just above, n. 9182). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9184.">9184.</a></font></span>
 <p>Endowing he shall endow her to himself for a woman. That this signifies a token of consent to a lawful conjunction, is evident from the signification of a "dowry" and of "endowing," as being a token of consent (see n. 4456); and from the signification of "for a woman," as being to a lawful conjunction, for to take anyone for a woman denotes to be lawfully conjoined. In the spiritual sense an unlawful conjunction is the conjunction of truth with an affection from the delight of self-advantage or from the delight of being honored. In such an affection are they who learn the truths of the church for the sake of these delights. But this conjunction does no harm to those who are afterward regenerated by the Lord, for although these affections remain with them, they are subordinated under the affection of truth for the sake of the good of use and of life; and they serve, for they are in the last place, although at first they appeared to be in the first place. For while a man is being regenerated, the order of his life is inverted. In this manner is lawful conjunction made out of unlawful conjunction.  [2] That this is possible is because the truths which are of faith enter through the hearing, thus through the external man; and the external man relishes only those things which belong to the world and to self, and which are the delights arising from self-advantage and honors. But when the internal man has been opened by means of regeneration, good from the Lord then flows in through it, and adopts and conjoins with itself the truths of faith which have entered through the external man, and according to this conjunction the order is inverted, that is, what had been in the first place is put in the last. The Lord then draws to Himself all things in the man which belong to life, so that they may look upward. The man then regards as ends those things which belong to the Lord and to heaven; and the Lord Himself as the end for the sake of which are all things; and the former things, which are the delights of self-advantage and of honors, he regards as means to this end. It is known that the means derive their life solely from the end, and that apart from the end they have no life. Thus when the delights of self-advantage and of honors have become means, they then have their life from the life which comes from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord; for the end for the sake of which they exist is the Lord. When a man is in such an order of life, matters of self-advantage and honors are then blessings to him; whereas if he is in the inverted order, these things are curses to him. That all things are blessings when a man is in the order of heaven, the Lord teaches in Matthew:      Seek ye first the kingdom of the heavens and His righteousness, and all things shall be added unto you (Matt. 6:33). </p>

 <p>If refusing her father shall refuse to give her to him. That this signifies if interior good does not allow conjunction, is evident from the signification of "refusing," as being not to allow; from the signification of "giving her to him," that is, "for a woman," as being lawful conjunction (of which just above, n. 9184); and from the signification of "father," as being good (n. 3703, 3704, 5581, 5902, 6050, 7499, 8328, 8897); and as being interior good, because from interior good as a father, and from interior truth as a mother, are conceived and born exterior truths and goods, which are therefore in the Word called "sons and daughters." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9186.">9186.</a></font></span>
 <p>He shall pay silver according to the dowry of virgins. That this signifies other truth consenting in its place, is evident from the signification of "silver," as being truth (see n. 1551, 2954, 5658, 6112, 6914, 6917); from the signification of "paying," as being substitution in the place of the former, for he who pays a dowry and does not take the virgin gives something else in place of her; and from the signification of "the dowry of virgins," as being a token of consent to conjunction (of which just above, n. 9184), which token is truth consenting to interior good. For the dowry was fifty pieces of silver given to the father of the girl (Deut. 22:29), and thus denotes truths initiating to full conjunction; for "silver" denotes truth, as shown just above; and "fifty" denotes to the full (n. 2252); here other truths in place of the former, and consenting to good. [2] How the case is with these truths is clear from what was shown above; to which is to be added what follows, namely, in order that an unlawful conjunction may become lawful, the good which flows in from the Lord through the internal man, must conjoin with itself the truth which enters through the external man, that is, through its hearing. If this truth does not agree with that good, then in place of it there has to be substituted some other truth which does agree; that is, which consents to conjunction.  [3] This might be illustrated by examples; but as the conjunction of good and truth is enveloped in thick darkness on account of the good of love having been removed from the truths of faith, and rejected behind the truths, and almost behind the back, this subject will not become any clearer by examples. In general no one can apprehend the internal sense of the Word, and thus the things of angelic wisdom, unless he knows and understands that each and all things in heaven bear relation to good and truth; and that nothing exists there except from the one of these conjoined with the other. Hence it is that those are in darkness who separate the one from the other, namely, the truth which is of faith from the good which is of charity, as do those who say that a man is saved by faith alone, that is, by the mere confidence which is of faith. As these persons ascribe all things to faith, and nothing to charity, they cannot possibly apprehend anything about those heavenly things which are in the internal sense of the Word; for they are in darkness concerning good, thus also in darkness concerning the conjunction of good and truth; and consequently concerning truth itself, for this is then involved in the same darkness. Hence arise mental wanderings and heresies so many and so great. They who are enlightened in respect to truths, are the few who are in the doctrine, and at the same time in the life, of truth. [4] Let those who are in faith alone know that all the ideas of thought of the angels who are in the second heaven, and are called spiritual, are from truths which have become goods by life; and that all the ideas of thought of the angels who are in the third heaven, and are called celestial, are from good; and that therefore these latter are in wisdom itself, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy, wonderful things shall be told elsewhere. </p>

 <p>Verses 17-19. Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live. Everyone that lieth with a beast, dying he shall die. He that sacrificeth to gods, save to Jehovah alone, shall be accursed. "A sorceress" signifies those in whom something of the church has been conjoined with the falsities of the evil of the love of self; "thou shalt not suffer to live," signifies the deprivation of spiritual life; "everyone that lieth with a beast," signifies conjunction with the evils of the cupidities of the love of self; "dying he shall die," signifies damnation; "he that sacrificeth to gods," signifies the worship of falsities from evil; "shall be accursed" signifies a casting out; "save to Jehovah alone," signifies that the Lord, who is the one and only God, is to be worshiped. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9188.">9188.</a></font></span>
 <p>A sorceress. That this signifies those in whom something of the church has been conjoined with the falsities of the evil of the love of self, is evident from the signification of "sorceries," as being the falsities of the evil of the love of self conjoined with such things as are of the church. There are two things which make heaven and thus spiritual life with man-the truth of faith in the Lord, and the good of love to Him. And there are two things which make hell and thus spiritual death with man-the falsity of faith, and the evil of the love of self. The two latter are conjoined in those who are in hell, and make the infernal marriage; but the two former are conjoined in those who are in heaven, and make the heavenly marriage. So far as possible, the Lord withholds man from the conjunction of truth and good with falsity and evil, because this conjunction is profanation. Nevertheless many of those who are within the church cannot be withheld, because from early childhood they have learned the things of the church from the Word, and from doctrine drawn from the Word; and some of them have become imbued with such things, and have made them of their faith. When these persons have arrived at mature age, and have begun to think from themselves, and not as before from others, then they have made nothing of the things they had made of their faith, and in their stead have seized on falsities and imbued themselves with them. These are they who have conjoined within them truths with falsities; for those truths which have once become truths of faith remain, and cannot be rooted out; and the falsities which are afterward made of their faith conjoin themselves with them.  [2] It is this conjunction which is signified in the internal sense by "sorceries." The reason why these falsities are falsities of the evil of the love of self, is that all evil springs chiefly from this love, and together with evil, falsity, because they cohere together. From this it is evident that in such persons there is no spiritual life, because it has been destroyed by falsities of evil; and insofar as they have conjoined these falsities with truths, so far they have extinguished spiritual life within them; and as in this way instead of being alive, they have become dead, it is said, "Thou shalt not suffer them to live." [3] That the conjunction in question is signified in the Word by "sorceries," is plain in Isaiah:      She said, I shall not sit a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children; but these two things shall come upon thee in a moment in one day, loss of children, and widowhood, because of the multitude of thy sorceries, because of the exceeding greatness of thy magical deeds. Thou hast trusted in thy wickedness; thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge have led thee astray; when thou saidst in thine heart, I am, and there is none else besides me. Therefore shall evil come upon thee which thou shalt not know how to ward off; and calamity shall fall upon thee which thou shalt not be able to atone: devastation shall come upon thee suddenly, thou not knowing. For indeed persist thou in thy magical deeds, and in the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast labored from thy youth. Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsel. Let the searchers of the heavens, the stargazers, and those who know the new moons, now stand and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee. Behold they are become as stubble; the fire hath burned them; they shall not rescue their soul from the hand of the flame (Isa. 47:8-14). [4] That "sorcerers" denote those who conjoin the falsities of the evil of the love of self with the truths of faith, and thus perish, is plain from every particular in the above passage viewed in the internal sense, for they are here described. The extinction of their spiritual life is described by "widowhood and loss of children." "Widowhood" denotes the privation of truth and of the derivative good; and "loss of children" the privation of truth and good. The origin of falsity, as being from the evil of the love of self, is described by these words, "thy wisdom and thy knowledge have led thee astray when thou saidst in thine heart, I am, and there is none else besides me;" and the evil itself of the love of self, by these words, "behold, they are become as stubble, the fire hath burned them, they shall not rescue their soul from the hand of the flame;" "fire" and "flame" denote the love of self. That everything of spiritual life has been extinguished, is described by these words, "evil shall come upon thee which thou shalt not know how to ward off, and calamity shall fall upon thee which thou shalt not be able to atone." They are called "searchers of the heavens, stargazers, and those who know the new moons," from being in external things without any internal; for such see from the external man and not at all from the internal, thus from natural light and not at all from spiritual light; for in the internal sense "heaven," the "stars," and "new moons" denote knowledges and memory-knowledges; here, such as are seen from the world, and not from heaven. [5] That "sorceries" denote such falsities, is also plain in Micah:      I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strongholds; I will cut off sorceries out of thine hand; and thou shall have no soothsayers (Micah 5:11-12): "the cities of the land" denote the false doctrinal things of their church, which are called "sorceries" because they destroy the truths of faith. In Nahum:      Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well- favored <a name="fr_192"></a><a href="#fn_192"><font size="1">9188-1</font></a> harlot, the mistress of sorceries, that selleth nations in her whoredom, and families in her sorceries (Nah. 3:4); "whoredoms" denote perversions of truth; and "sorceries," the falsities thence derived. In like manner in the second book of Kings:      Jehoram said unto Jehu, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, even unto the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel, and her many sorceries? (2 Kings 9:22). [6] That those are "sorcerers" who have been taught by themselves, and trust in themselves alone to the extent of loving themselves and desiring to be worshiped as deities, is also plain from passages which treat openly of the coming of the Lord, who will teach them and cast out the sorcerers; for he who shall be taught in the truths and goods of faith must be taught by the Lord, and in no wise by himself. Wherefore it is thus written in Malachi:      Behold I send Mine angel, who shall prepare the way before Me; and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the angel of the covenant whom ye desire. And I will draw nigh to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and those who swear to what is false (Mal. 3:1, 5); "sorcerers" denote those who have been taught by themselves, and who thus destroy truths which are from the Lord; "adulterers" denote those who destroy goods; and "those who swear to what is false," those who confirm falsities. That it is the Lord who will cast them out is plain, for it is said, "the Lord shall come to His temple, even the angel of the covenant." [7] So also in Moses:      When thou comest unto the land which Jehovah God will give thee, there shall not be found in thee anyone that maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire, one that divineth divinations, and one that questioneth the hells, and an augur, and a sorcerer, and an enchanter, and one that consulteth a familiar spirit, and a soothsayer, and a questioner of the dead. For everyone that doeth these things is an abomination to Jehovah; and because of these abominations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee. Jehovah thy God will raise up to thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; him shall ye obey. Jehovah said in Horeb, I will raise him up a prophet from the midst of their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put My words in his mouth, that he may speak unto them all that I shall command him. Whence it shall come to pass that the man who will not obey My words, which he shall speak in My name, I will require it of him (Deut. 18:9-19). [8] By "diviners," "augurs," "sorcerers," and the rest who are here named, are meant in the internal sense those who destroy the truths and goods of the church by means of memory-knowledges wrongly applied; thus who do so from their own intelligence and through falsities from the evils of the love of self and the love of the world, consequently who learn and teach from the cupidity of profit and of honors, and not from any affection for the truth of faith and the good of life. And as all falsities of doctrine and evils of life come forth from this source, mention is made of "a prophet who shall come and teach." That this "prophet" is the Lord, is known in the church, and was known also to the Jews and Gentiles of that time, as is evident in Matthew 21:11; Luke 1:76; 7:16; 13:33; Mark 6:4. Those are taught by the Lord who read the Word not for the sake of self and the world, but for the sake of good and truth itself, for then they are enlightened. But when men read it for the sake of self and the world, they are blinded. "A prophet" signifies one who teaches, and in a sense abstracted from person, doctrine (n. 2534, 7269); thus the Lord as to the Word, that is, as to Divine truth. </p>

 <p>Thou shalt not suffer to live. That this signifies the privation of spiritual life, is evident from the signification of "suffering to live," as being to endow with spiritual life (see n. 5890); thus "not to suffer to live" denotes to deprive of spiritual life. (That those deprive themselves of spiritual life who conjoin falsities from the evil of the love of self with the truths of faith, and who are signified by "sorcerers," see just above, n. 9188.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9190.">9190.</a></font></span>
 <p>Everyone that lieth with a beast. That this signifies conjunction with the evils of the cupidities of the love of self, is evident from the signification of "lying with" as being to be conjoined; and from the signification of "a beast," as being good affection with the good, and evil affection with the evil (45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 719, 776, 2781, 3518, 3519, 5198, 7424, 7523, 7872, 9090), thus cupidities; here the cupidities of the love of self. Evil affections are called "cupidities." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9191.">9191.</a></font></span>
 <p>Dying he shall die. That this signifies damnation, is evident from the signification of "dying," as being damnation (see n. 5407, 6119, 9008). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9192.">9192.</a></font></span>
 <p>He that sacrificeth to gods. That this signifies the worship of falsities from evil, is evident from the signification of "sacrificing," as being worship (that "to sacrifice" denotes worship is because sacrifices were the chief things of worship with the Israelitish and Jewish people, see n. 923, 6905, 8680, 8936); and from the signification of "gods," as being falsities (n. 4402, 4544, 7873, 8941). The worship of falsities from evil is here mentioned, because this is opposed to the worship of truths from good. For all worship has matters of doctrine for its rules; and these matters of doctrine are truths insofar as they are from good; and they are falsities insofar as they are from evil; for truths have their essence and life from good, and on the other hand falsities have their death from evil. [2] But the case herein is as follows. There are some who are in genuine truths, some who are in truths not genuine, and some who are in falsities; and yet those who are in genuine truths are often damned, while those who are in truths not genuine, and also those who are in falsities, are often saved. This will appear paradoxical to most people, but still it is the truth. Experience itself has confirmed it; for there have been seen in hell those who had been more learned than others in truths from the Word and from the doctrine of their church, both dignitaries and others; on the other hand there have been seen in heaven those who had been devoid of truths, and even those who had been in falsities, both Christians and Gentiles.  [3] The reason why the former were in hell, was that they had indeed been in truths as to doctrine but in evils as to life; and the reason why the latter were in heaven, was that they had not indeed been in truths as to doctrine but nevertheless had been in good as to life. Some spirits recently deceased, with whom it was given me to speak, wondered that those who had been preeminent for learning in the Word and in the doctrine of their church, were among the damned, whom they nevertheless had believed would become shining lights in heaven, according to these words in Daniel:      The intelligent shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever (Dan. 12:3). But they were told that "the intelligent" are those who are in truth, and who teach truths, and that "they who turn others to righteousness" are those who are in good, and who lead to good; and that therefore the Lord said:      The righteous shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father (Matt. 13:43). (That righteousness is predicated of good, and thus that "the righteous" are those who are in good, see n. 2235.) [4] And they were further told that those who are learned as to doctrine, but evil as to life, are those who are meant by the Lord in the following passages:      Many shall say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied by Thy name, and by Thy name have cast out demons, and in Thy name done many mighty deeds? But then will I confess unto them, I know you not; depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity (Matt. 7:22, 23).      Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in Thy presence, and Thou hast taught in our streets. But He will say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity (Luke 13:26-27). And they were also told that the same were meant by "the foolish virgins who had no oil in their lamps," of whom it is written in Matthew:      At last came the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But He answering said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not (Matt. 25:11-12); "to have oil in the lamps" denotes good in the truths which are of the faith of the church (n. 4638; that "oil" denotes the good of love, see n. 886, 4582). [5] They were told furthermore, that those who are not in truths, nay, who are in falsities from ignorance, and yet are in good and from this in the affection of knowing truth, were meant by the Lord when He said:      I say unto you, that many shall come from the east even unto the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens; but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness (Matt. 8:11-12).      They shall come from the east and west, and from the north and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. And behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last (Luke 13:29-30). (That the Gentiles who are in good, though from ignorance in things not true, are received into heaven, see n. 2589-2604, 2861, 2863, 3263, 4190, 4197.) [6] From all this it can now be seen that by "those who sacrifice unto gods" are signified those who are in the worship of falsity from evil, and that these are they who shall be "accursed," that is, shall be cast out. For falsities from evil are evils in form, because when evil shows itself in the light, and takes form, it is called falsity. Hence it is that those who are in evil as to life, although in truths as to doctrine, are nevertheless in the falsities of their evils. That this is so is clearly visible in the other life; for when these persons are left to themselves they think from their evil against the truths which they had known and professed; thus they think falsities. And they do the very same in this world when thinking by themselves; for they then either pervert truths, or deny them, in order to defend the evils of their life.  [7] But they who are in good, and yet in things not true, nay, who are in falsities from ignorance, as are many within the church, and many also outside of the church who are called Gentiles, these indeed regard their falsities as truths; but because their falsities come forth from good, they bend them to good, and therefore there is nothing wicked in these falsities, as there is in those which are from evil. And as falsities from good are mild and pliant, such persons are in the capacity of receiving truths, and moreover, do receive them when they are instructed by the angels. These falsities may be compared to foods which look unclean, but yet are savory; whereas falsities from evil may be compared to unclean foods which inwardly are putrid. But truths from evil may be compared to foods which look clean, but are inwardly baneful, and if attended with hypocrisy are poisonous; as the Lord teaches in Matthew:      Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye make yourselves like unto whited sepulchers which outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness (Matt. 23:27). </p>

 <p>Shall be accursed. That this signifies a casting out, is evident from the signification of "being accursed," when said of those who are in the worship of falsities from evil, as being to be cast out, that is, from the church. That to be cast out from the church, and thus the rooting out of such falsities, is signified by "being accursed" is plain in Moses:      If men of Belial shall go out from the midst of thee, and shall urge the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known; if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in the midst of thee; smiting thou shalt smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, making it accursed, and everyone that is therein, and also the beast thereof, with the edge of the sword. All the spoil of it thou shalt carry together into the midst of the street, and shalt burn the city with fire, and all the spoil thereof, to Jehovah thy God; that it may be a heap for eternity; neither shall it be built any more; so that there may not cleave to thine hand anything of the accursed thing (Deut. 13:13-17). [2] That it is the falsity from evil which is signified by "the accursed thing," is plain from each detail in the above passage in the internal sense; for "the cities which were to be accursed" denote doctrines, here false doctrines (see n. 2712, 2943, 3216); "the edge of the sword, with which the men and beasts were to be smitten," denotes truth fighting and destroying the falsity which is from evil (n. 2799, 4499, 7102, 8294); "the street into the midst of which the spoil was to be carried together" denotes the truth of doctrine, and in the opposite sense, the falsity of doctrine (n. 2336); "the fire with which the spoil was to be burned together with the city," denotes the evil of the love of self (n. 1297, 2446, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, 7324). From this it is evident that this "accursing" denotes a casting out from the church, and a rooting out. Wherefore also it was commanded that the nations in the land of Canaan should be "accursed" (Deut. 7:2, 24-26); for these nations had formerly constituted the church in that land, and therefore they had altars, and likewise offered sacrifices (n. 3686, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136, 6306, 6516, 8054); but when they turned the representative worship, which belonged to the Ancient Church, into idolatrous worship, and thus falsified truths and adulterated goods (n. 8317), it was ordered that not only the men, but also the cities and what was in the cities, should be "accursed."  [3] The reason was that all things therein represented falsities from evil; the cities themselves, doctrines of falsity; the beasts, evil affections; the gold and silver, their evils and falsities; and all other things in like manner. The main feature of the worship of the Ancient Church was the worship of God under a human form, thus of the Lord. But when they turned aside from good to evil, they began to worship the representatives themselves, such as the sun, the moon, the stars, also groves, statues, and God under various idol forms, thus external things apart from anything internal, as is the case when the internal man has been closed. The internal man is closed by a life of evil; for the Lord flows in by good, and opens the internal man; and consequently it is closed by evil. And when the internal man has been closed, truths are turned into falsities; and where they remain as truths, they merely serve the evils which are of the love of self and the love of the world. The main thing of internal worship is to acknowledge the Lord as the one and only God, and that everything good and true is from Him. Those in the church who do not acknowledge Him cannot be in good, thus neither can they be in truth. Those acknowledge Him who are in faith, and at the same time in the good of life; but not those who are in evil of life (n. 8878). That to acknowledge and worship the Lord is to live according to His commandments, that is, to live a life of faith and charity, see n. 8252-8257. A life of faith consists in doing the commandments from obedience and a life of charity in doing the commandments from love. </p>

 <p>Save to Jehovah alone. That this signifies that the Lord, who is the one and only God, is to be worshiped, is evident from the signification of "offering sacrifices," here to Jehovah alone, as being worship (see above, n. 9192). That "to Jehovah" denotes to the Lord, is because by "Jehovah" in the Word is meant no other than the Lord (see n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 3023, 3035, 4692, 5663, 6303, 6905, 8864). (That the Divine which He called "the Father" is the Divine good in Himself, see n. 2803, 3704, 7499, 8897; thus that the Lord is the one and only God, n. 1607, 2149, 2156, 2329, 2447, 2751, 3194, 3704, 3712, 3938, 4577, 4687, 5321, 6280, 6371, 6849, 6993, 7014, 7182, 7209, 8241, 8724, 8760, 8864, 8865.) </p>

 <p>Verses 20-23. And a sojourner thou shalt not afflict, and shalt not oppress; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt. Any widow and orphan ye shall not afflict. If afflicting thou shalt afflict him, so that crying he shall cry unto Me, hearing I will hear his cry; and Mine anger shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your women shall become widows, and your sons orphans. "And a sojourner thou shalt not afflict, and shalt not oppress," signifies that those who wish to be instructed in the truths and goods of faith are not to be infested with falsities of doctrine and evils of life; "for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt," signifies that they were protected from falsities and evils when infested by the infernals; "any widow," signifies those who are in good without truth, and yet long for truth; "and orphan," signifies those who are in truth, and not yet in good, and nevertheless long for good; "ye shall not afflict," signifies that they are not to be defrauded; "if afflicting thou shalt afflict him," signifies if they are defrauded; "so that crying he shall cry unto Me," signifies supplication to the Lord for aid; "hearing I will hear his cry," signifies that they are to be aided; "and Mine anger shall wax hot," signifies the state of those who do this; "and I will kill you with the sword," signifies that they would deprive themselves of good and truth through falsities; "and your women shall become widows," signifies that the goods with them will perish; "and your sons orphans," signifies that then at the same time truths will perish. </p>

 <p>And a sojourner thou shalt not afflict, and shalt not oppress. That this signifies that those who wish to be instructed in the truths and goods of faith are not to be infested with falsities of faith and evils of life, is evident from the signification of "a sojourner," as being one who wishes to be instructed in those things which are of the church, thus in the truths and goods of faith, and who receives these and lives according to them (see n. 1463, 8007, 8013); that "a sojourner" has this signification, is because "to sojourn" signifies to be instructed, and also to live (n. 2025, 3672, 6095); and from the signification of "not to afflict," when said of those who wish to be instructed in the truths and goods of faith, as being that they are not to be infested with falsities of faith; and from the signification of "oppressing," when said of the same, as being that they are not to be infested with evils of life; for they who infest such with falsities afflict them; and they who infest such with evils oppress them. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9197.">9197.</a></font></span>
 <p>For ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt. That this signifies that they were protected from falsities and evils when infested by the infernals, is evident from what was said concerning the affliction and oppression of the sons of Israel in Egypt, and of their protection and final bringing forth from thence, in Exodus 7 to 14, where it was shown that the afflictions and oppressions of the sons of Israel in Egypt signified the infestations by the infernals, of the faithful who were of the spiritual church, before the Lord's coming; and that the protection and bringing forth of the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt signified the protection and liberation of those who were of the spiritual church by the Lord, when He was in the world, and when He rose again. But it would be too tedious to repeat now the explication of these particulars. (See what has been shown in the above-mentioned chapters of Exodus, especially in n. 6854, 6914, 7035, 7091, 7474, 7828, 7932a, 8018, 8054, 8099, 8159, 8321.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9198.">9198.</a></font></span>
 <p>Any widow. That this signifies those who are in good without truth, and yet long for truth, is evident from the signification of "a widow," as being good without truth, and yet longing for it. That "a widow" has this signification is because by "a man" is signified truth, and by his "woman" is signified good; and therefore when the woman of a man becomes a widow, she signifies good without truth. But in a still more interior sense "a widow" signifies truth without good. The reason is that in this sense "a husband" signifies good, and his "wife" truth (see n. 3236, 4510, 4823). In this sense the Lord is called "Husband" and "Bridegroom," from the Divine good; and His kingdom and church is called "Wife" and "Bride" from the reception of the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord (n. 9182). But as in the passage under consideration the Lord's celestial church is not treated of, but His spiritual church, by "a widow" is signified one who is in good and not in truth, and yet longs for truth. The case is similar with "an orphan." In the inmost or celestial, sense "an orphan" signifies those who are in good and long for truth. See the passages quoted and explained in regard to the signification of "widow" and "orphan" in the celestial sense, in n. 4844; to which may be added what the Lord says in Luke concerning the widow in Sarepta:      Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country. Of a truth I say unto you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there was a great famine over all the land; yet unto none of them was Elias sent, save to Sarepta of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow (Luke 4:24-26). [2] As all things the Lord spoke, He spoke from the Divine, therefore His words have an internal sense, and in this sense the subject here treated of is the Lord Himself and His kingdom and church. What therefore the Lord meant in this sense by the words He spoke of the widow in Sarepta of Sidon, is plain when they are unfolded. That "no prophet is accepted in his own country" signifies that the Lord, and the Divine truth which is from Him, are less received and loved in heart within the church, than outside of it. He spoke to the Jews, with whom the church then was; and it is known that the Lord was less received by them than by the nations outside the church. The case is similar at this day in the church which from Him is called the Christian Church. In this the Lord is indeed received in doctrine; but only by a few with acknowledgment of heart; and by still fewer from the affection of love. It is otherwise with the converted Gentiles outside the church. These worship and adore Him as their one only God, and they say with the mouth, and think at heart, that they acknowledge Him as God, because He has appeared in a human form (n. 5256). The reverse is the case within the church, where because He was born a man He is with difficulty acknowledged from the heart as God. These make His Human like their own human, although they know that His Father was Jehovah, and not a man. From all this it is evident what is meant in the internal sense by "no prophet being accepted in his own country." A "prophet" in this sense denotes the Lord as to Divine truth, thus in respect to the doctrine of the church. (That "a prophet" denotes one who teaches, and in the abstract sense doctrine, and when predicated of the Lord, the Divine truth of the Word, see above, n. 9188.) [3] That "there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elias" signifies in the internal sense the state of acknowledgment of truth Divine from the Word at that time in the church. For as before said, "widows" denote those who are in good without truth; "Elias" denotes the Lord as to the Word; "the days of Elias" denote the states of reception of truth Divine from the Word at that time; and "Israel" denotes the church. (That "Elias" represented the Lord as to the Word, may be seen in the preface to Genesis 18, and n. 2762, 5247, 8029; that "days" denote states, n. 893, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850, 6110, 8426; and that "Israel" denotes the church, n. 4286, 6426, 6637, 8805.) [4] "When the heaven was shut up three years and six months" signifies the full vastation of the internal church; for "heaven" denotes the internal of the church; and "three years and six months" denotes to the full. That "heaven" denotes the internal of the church, see n. 1733, 1850, 3355, 4535; and this is said to be "shut up" when it is vastated, that is, when it is no more. That "three years and six months" denotes to the full, is evident from the signification of "a thousand two hundred and sixty days" in Rev. 11:3; 12:6 (which days make three years and six months), as being to the full, that is, even unto the end; in like manner from the signification of "three days and a half" in Rev. 11:9-11; and also from the signification of "a time and times and half a time" in Rev. 12:14, and Dan. 12:7, as being to the full, or, even to the end. [5] "When there was a great famine over all the land" signifies the vastation of the external church also; for "a famine" denotes the lack and desolation of truth and good (n. 3364, 5277, 5279, 5281, 5300, 5360, 5376, 5415, 5576, 6110, 7102); and "the land" denotes the external church (n. 1262, 1413, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355, 4535, 5577, 8011, 8732). "Yet unto none of them was Elias sent" signifies the Lord as to the Word-and thus the Word of the Lord-not sent to others, because He would not have been received elsewhere; for "Elias," as before said, denotes the Lord as to the Word. [6] "Save to Sarepta of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow," signifies only unto those who are in good and long for truth. It is said "Sarepta of Sidon" because "Sidon" signifies the knowledges of good and truth (n. 1201). That "a woman a widow" denotes one who is in good, and longs for truth, is evident from what has just been said, and especially from what is related of her in the first book of Kings, where are these words: "Elijah came to Sarepta of Sidon to a widow woman, that she might sustain him; and he said to her, Fetch me a little water that I may drink, and bring me a morsel of bread in thine hand; and she said that she had only a little meal in the barrel, and a little oil in the cruse, sufficient only for a cake for herself and her son." And Elijah said:      Make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it out to me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son. She did so; and the barrel of meal was not consumed; and the cruse of oil did not fail (1 Kings 17:9-16). [7] Obedience, and the longing of good for truth, are described by her giving water to the prophet at his bidding, and afterward by her first making a cake for him out of her own little supply, and then for herself and her son; and that thereby she was enriched with the good of truth is signified by "the barrel of meal not being consumed, and the cruse of oil failing not;" for in the internal sense "water" denotes truth (n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, 8568); "meal," truth from good (n. 2177); "oil," the good of love (n. 886, 4582, 4638); and "a cake" made of these, truth conjoined with its good (n. 7978). From all this it is clear that "a widow" denotes one who is in good and longs for truth. Good and its longing for truth is described by the charity toward the prophet, which was greater than toward herself and her son. "The prophet," as before shown, denotes the doctrine of truth. [8] From all this it is evident what is the nature of the Word, namely, that it conceals within itself the secret things of heaven, which are not apparent in the letter; when yet in every word which the Lord Himself spoke when He was in the world, and which He had before spoken through the prophets, there are things heavenly and wholly Divine, and raised above the sense of the letter; and this not only in each word, but also in each syllable of the words, nay, in every point of each syllable. But who believes that this is so? Nevertheless it is a certain fact, of which I have received full and unquestionable proof, concerning which of the Lord's Divine mercy elsewhere. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9199.">9199.</a></font></span>
 <p>And an orphan. That this signifies those who are in truth and not yet in good, and nevertheless long for good, is evident from the signification of "an orphan," as being those who are in truth and long for good. The reason why these are signified by "orphans," is that sons bereaved of father and mother, thus they who are deprived of interior good and truth, are "orphans;" for by "father" in the Word is signified interior good, and by "mother" truth conjoined with this good (see n. 5581); and by "sons" are signified the truths thence derived. (That "sons" denote truths may be seen above, n. 489, 491, 553, 1147, 2813, 3373, 6583.) That sons are here meant by "orphans," and not daughters, is plain from the following verse, where it is said, "and your sons shall be orphans." That "orphan sons" denote those who long for good, is "because the Lord is then in the place of a father to them; as in David:      A father of the orphans, and a judge of the widows, is God in the habitation of His holiness (Ps. 68:5). [2] That "orphans" denote those who have been instructed in the truths of faith of the church from the Word, and thereby are afterward led to good, is plain also from the Lord's words in John:      I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Paraclete, <a name="fr_193"></a><a href="#fn_193"><font size="1">9199-1</font></a> that he may abide with you to eternity, the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, for it seeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for he abideth with you, and is among you. I will not leave you orphans; I will come unto you. These things have I spoken unto you while abiding with you. But the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, he shall teach you all things (John 14:16-18, 25-26). [3] That those are "orphans" who are in truths and long for good can be seen here from every detail; for by "the Paraclete" is meant the Divine truth, which the Lord was while in the world, and which proceeded from the Lord after He had glorified His Human and had gone out of the world. Therefore He says that "He will send the Paraclete," and that "He Himself will come." "Sending the Paraclete" denotes enlightening and instructing in the truths of faith; and "coming to them" denotes leading into good. Therefore He says, "I will not leave you orphans." It has been stated that by "the Paraclete" is meant the Divine truth which the Lord was while in the world, and which proceeded from Him after He had glorified His Human and had gone out of the world. That this is so, the Lord several times plainly taught. But those who distinguish the Divine into Persons, and not into Essences united in one, do not apprehend this; for the Word is explained and apprehended by a man according to the ideas previously received by him. So also where the Lord says that "He is in the Father and the Father in Him; that the Father and He are one; and that all things that are His are the Father's and all things of the Father are His" (John 10:30; 14:1-11, 20; 16:15; 17:10). [4] But to proceed with the further explanation of the things stated above. That by "the Paraclete" is meant the Divine truth, is plain from the very words of the Lord, for he is called "the Spirit of truth," and it is also said, "the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, shall teach you all things." That the Lord was the Divine truth while in the world, is plain also from the words of the Lord in the above passage, for He says that He will send another Paraclete (that is, in His place), even the Spirit of truth;" and of Himself He says that they know Him, because He abideth with them, and is among them. And also:      I tell you the truth, if I go not away, the Paraclete will not come unto you; but if I go away, I will send him unto you (John 16:7). And in another passage:      This spoke He of the Spirit, which they that believed in Him should receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified (John 7:39). And again He says that "He is the way, and the truth" (John 14:6); and also that "He is the Word, and that God is the Word, and that the Word became flesh" (John 1:1-3, 14); where "the Word" denotes the Divine truth. (That the Lord while in the world was the Divine truth, see n. 3195, 4687, 4727, 6716, 6864, 7499, 8127, 8724.)  [5] And that the Divine truth proceeds from the Lord since He glorified His Human, and went away out of the world, is plain also from the Lord's words, "When I go away, I will send the Spirit of truth unto you" ("to send" denotes to go forth and to proceed, n. 2397, 4710); and also, "When he is come, he shall teach you all the truth; for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak. He shall glorify Me; for he shall take of Mine, and shall declare it unto you" (John 16:13-14). That when the Lord went away out of the world He became the Divine good even as to the Human, may be seen above (n. 3704, 3712, 3737, 3969, 4577, 5704, 6864, 7014, 7499, 8241, 8724, 8760, 9167); and that then, from the Divine good, which He Himself is, proceeds the Divine truth, even as from the sun proceeds the light of the universe (n. 3636, 3643, 3969, 5704, 7083, 8127). To these references may be added those cited above (n. 9194). </p>
 
 
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9200.">9200.</a></font></span>
 <p>Ye shall not afflict. That this signifies that they are not to be defrauded, is evident from the signification of "afflicting," when said of those who wish to be instructed in truth, and to be led to good, as being to defraud; here, not to defraud, because it is said "Ye shall not afflict." The "sojourner," the "orphan," and the "widow" are often mentioned together in the Word, as in the following passages:      Jehovah, who preserveth the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow (Ps. 146:9).      Defraud ye not the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow (Jer. 22:3).       In thee they have dealt with the sojourner by oppressions; in thee have they defrauded the orphan and the widow (Ezek. 22:7).      Wrest not the judgment of the sojourner, of the orphan, and the widow (Deut. 24:17; 27:19).      What is left in the fields, the oliveyards and the vineyards, shall be for the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow (Deut. 24:19-22; 26:12-13).      Jehovah executeth the judgment of the orphan, of the widow, and loveth the sojourner (Deut. 10:18). In like manner in the passage before us, "a sojourner thou shalt not afflict, and shalt not oppress; any widow and orphan ye shall not afflict." When these three are thus mentioned together, they fall with the angels into one sense; namely, that with those who are in the church, good and truth are to be conjoined according to order; thus reciprocally, truth with good, and good with truth; for by "a sojourner" are meant those who wish to be instructed in such things as are of the church; by "widows," the conjunction of good with truth; and by "orphans," the conjunction of truth with good; which conjunction is reciprocal. The case is similar with all other passages in the Word; when explained as to the internal sense they seem scattered; but with the angels they are combined into one sense; nay into one idea. </p>
