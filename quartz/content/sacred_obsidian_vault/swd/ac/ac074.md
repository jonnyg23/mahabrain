 <p>Everyone may see that these words contain arcana, and that unless these arcana are disclosed it is impossible to know what is meant by "them that are in Judea fleeing to the mountains;" by "him that is upon the housetop not going down to take anything out of his house;" and by "him that is in the field not returning back to take his garment." Unless the internal sense were to teach what these words signify and enfold within them, the investigators and interpreters of the Word might be led away and fall into opinions altogether foreign to the truth; or it might even happen that those who at heart deny the holiness of the Word might come to the conclusion that such expressions merely describe flight and escape on the approach of an enemy; consequently that there is nothing more holy contained therein; when yet by these words of the Lord there is fully described a state of the devastation of the church in respect to the goods of love and the truths of faith; as may be seen from the following explication of the words in question. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3652.">3652.</a></font></span>
 <p>According to the internal sense, the signification is as now follows.      When therefore ye shall see the abomination of desolation; signifies the devastation of the church, which occurs when the Lord is no longer acknowledged; consequently when there is no love and no faith in Him; also when there is no longer any charity toward the neighbor; and consequently when there is not any faith of good and truth. When this is the case in the church, or rather in the region where the Word is in existence-that is, when men are such in the thoughts of the heart, even if not in the doctrine of their lips-then there is "desolation," and the things just mentioned are its "abomination;" so that the words "when ye shall see the abomination of desolation" signify when anyone observes such things; and what is to be done in such a case is told in what now follows in verses 16 to 18.      [2] Which was told of by Daniel the prophet; in the internal sense signifies by the prophets; for where any prophet is mentioned by name in the Word, it is not the prophet that is meant, but the prophetic Word itself; because names never penetrate into heaven (see n. 1876, 1888); and yet the same is not signified by one prophet as by another. What is signified by "Moses," "Elias," and "Elisha," may be seen in the preface to chapter 18 and in n. 2762; but by "Daniel" is signified everything prophetic concerning the Lord's advent, and concerning the state of the church; in the present case concerning its last state. The subject of devastation is largely treated of in the Prophets, and by it in the sense of the letter is signified the devastation of the Jewish and Israelitish Church, but in the internal sense there is signified the devastation of the church in general, thus also the devastation which is now at hand.      [3] Standing in the holy place; signifies devastation as to all things which are of good and truth; the "holy place" is a state of love and faith (that "place" in the internal sense is state, see above, n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387); the holy of this state is the good which is of love, and the derivative truth which is of faith; and nothing else than these is meant by "holy" in the Word, because these things are from the Lord, who is the Holy itself, or the Sanctuary.      Let him that readeth understand; signifies that these things are to be well observed by those who are in the church, especially by those who are in love and faith; who now come to be treated of.      [4] Then let them that are in Judea flee into the mountains; signifies that they who are of the church will not look elsewhere than to the Lord, thus to love to Him, and to charity toward the neighbor (that by "Judea" is signified the church, will be shown below; that by a "mountain" is signified the Lord Himself, but by "mountains" love to Him, and charity toward the neighbor, may be seen above, n. 795, 796, 1430, 2722). According to the sense of the letter the meaning would be that when Jerusalem was besieged, as it came to be by the Romans, then they should not betake themselves thither, but to the mountains, according to what is written in Luke:      When ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that her devastation is at hand. Then let them that are in Judea flee upon the mountains; and let them that are in the midst of her depart out; and let not them that are in the regions enter therein (Luke 21:20-21); [5] but in this passage the case is the same with Jerusalem, namely, that in the sense of the letter it is Jerusalem which is understood, while in the internal sense it is the Lord's church (see n. 402, 2117); for each and all of the things recorded in the Word concerning the Jewish and Israelitish people are representative of the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, and of His kingdom on earth; that is, of the church, as has been often shown. Hence it is that by "Jerusalem" in the internal sense is nowhere meant Jerusalem, nor by "Judea," Judea. But these matters were of such a nature as to be capable of representing the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, and the events took place for the sake of the representation. In this way the Word could be so written as to be adapted to the apprehension of the man who should read it, and also to the understanding of the angels who are with the man. This likewise was the reason why the Lord spoke in the same manner; for had He spoken otherwise, His Word would not have been adapted to the understanding of those who read it, especially at that time; nor to the understanding of the angels; thus it would neither have been received by man, nor understood by the angels.      [6] Let him that is upon the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house; signifies that such as are in the good of charity should not betake themselves to those things which belong to doctrinal matters of faith. In the Word the "housetop" signifies the higher state of man, thus his state as to good; but those things which are below it signify the lower state of man, thus his state as to truth (n. 710, 1708, 2233, 2234, 3142, 3538). As regards the state of a man of the church, the case is this: While he is being regenerated he learns truths for the sake of good, for he has the affection of truth on this account; but after he has been regenerated he acts from truth and good. After the man has arrived at this state he ought not to betake himself to his former state, for if he should do this he would reason from truth concerning the good in which he is, and would thereby pervert his state, for all reasoning ceases, and ought to cease, when a man is in a state to will what is true and good; for he then thinks and acts from the will, consequently from conscience, and not as before from the understanding; and if he should again think and act from this, he would fall into temptations in which he would succumb. This then is what is signified by "Let him that is upon the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house."      [7] And let him that is in the field not return back to take his garment; (that is, his tunic), signifies that such as are in the good of truth should not betake themselves from the good thereof to what is doctrinal of truth. In the Word a "field" signifies this state of man in respect to good (what is meant by "field" may be seen above, n. 368, 2971, 3196, 3310, 3317, 3500, 3508); and a "garment" or "tunic" signifies that which clothes good, that is, what is doctrinal of truth, for this is as clothing to good (that a "garment" has this signification may be seen above, n. 297, 1073, 2576, 3301). Everyone can see that in these words deeper things are hidden than those which appear in the letter, for they were spoken by the Lord Himself. </p>

 <p>From all this it is now evident that in these verses there is fully described the state of devastation of the church in respect to the goods of love and the truths of faith, and that at the same time there is given an exhortation to those who are in these goods and truths in regard to what they ought then to do. There are three kinds of men within the church; namely, those who are in love to the Lord; those who are in charity toward the neighbor; and those who are in the affection of truth. Those who belong to the first class, who are in love to the Lord, are specifically signified in the words, "let them that are in Judea flee into the mountains." Those in the second class, who are in charity toward their neighbor, are specifically signified in the words, "let him that is upon the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house." Those in the third class, who are in the affection of truth, are specifically signified in the words, "and let him that is in the field not return back to take his garment." (See what has been said and explained above in regard to these words, n. 2454; and what is meant by "returning back," and "looking behind him.") </p>

 <p>That in the internal sense of the Word "Judea" does not signify Judea; nor in like manner "Jerusalem," Jerusalem, may be seen from many passages in the Word. "Judea" is not so frequently mentioned in the Word as is the "land of Judah," and by the "land of Judah," as well as by the "land of Canaan," is signified the Lord's kingdom (consequently also the church, for the church is the Lord's kingdom on earth), and this for the reason that the Lord's celestial kingdom was represented by Judah, or by the Jewish nation, and His spiritual kingdom by Israel, or the Israelitish people; and inasmuch as it was so represented, therefore also when mention is made in the Word of that nation and people, in the internal sense there is nothing else signified thereby. [2] That this is the case will appear from what of the Lord's Divine mercy will be said hereafter concerning Judah and the land of Judah; and in the meantime from the following few passages in the Prophets. In Isaiah:      My beloved had a vineyard in the horn of a son of oil; and he made a hedge about it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with a noble vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein; and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. And now O inhabitant of Jerusalem, and man of Judah, judge I pray you between Me and My vineyard. I will make it a desolation. For the vineyard of Jehovah Zebaoth is the house of Israel, and the man of Judah is the plant of His delights; and He looked for judgment, but behold a festering; for righteousness, but behold a cry (Isa. 5:1-3, 6-7). In this passage, in the sense of the letter, the perverted state of the Israelites and Jews is treated of, but in the internal sense the perverted state of the church as represented by Israel and Judah. The "inhabitant of Jerusalem" is the good of the church (that "inhabitant" signifies good, or what is the same, those who are in good, may be seen above, n. 2268, 2451, 2712, 3613; and that "Jerusalem" signifies the church, see n. 402, 2117). The signification of the "house of Israel" is similar (that "house" signifies good may be seen above, n. 710, 1708, 2233, 2234, 3142, 3538; and that "Israel" signifies the church, n. 3305); in like manner the "man of Judah," for by "man" is signified truth (n. 265, 749, 1007, 3134, 3310, 3459), and by "Judah" good, but with the difference that the "man of Judah" signifies truth from the good of love to the Lord (which is called celestial truth), that is, those who are in such truth. [3] In the same:      And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four wings of the earth. The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the enemies of Judah shall be cut off. Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not straiten Ephraim. Jehovah shall accurse the tongue of the Egyptian sea, and with the vehemence of His breath shall shake His hand over the river. And there shall be a highway for the remains of His people, which shall be left from Asshur (Isa. 11:12-13, 15-16). The subject here treated of in the sense of the letter is the bringing back of the Israelites and Jews from captivity, but in the internal sense it is concerning a new church in general and with every individual in particular who is being regenerated or is becoming a church. The "outcasts of Israel" denote the truths of such persons; the "dispersed of Judah," their goods; "Ephraim," their intellectual part in that it will no longer be resistant; "Egypt," memory-knowledges; and "Asshur," the derivative reasoning, which they have perverted; the "outcasts," the "dispersed," the "remains," and "those who are left," denote the truths and goods which survive. (That "Ephraim" denotes the intellectual part, will be made manifest elsewhere; and that "Egypt" is memory-knowledge, n. 1164-1165, 1186, 1462, 2588, 3325; that "Asshur" is reasoning, n. 119, 1186; and that "remains" are goods and truths from the Lord stored up in the interior man, n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 660, 661, 798, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284.) [4] In the same:      Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, called by the name of Israel, and they have come forth out of the waters of Judah. For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel (Isa. 48:1-2); where the "waters of Judah" denote the truths which are from the good of love to the Lord; the truths thence derived are the very goods of charity, which are called spiritual goods, and constitute the spiritual church, the internal of which is "Israel," and the external the "house of Jacob;" hence it is manifest what is signified by the "house of Jacob called by the name of Israel," and by their "coming forth out of the waters of Judah." [5] In the same:      I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of My mountains; and Mine elect shall possess it, and My servants shall dwell there (Isa. 65:9); "out of Judah an inheritor of mountains" in the supreme sense denotes the Lord, and in the representative sense those who are in love to Him, thus in the good of love to the Lord and of love to the neighbor. (That "mountains" signify these goods was shown above, n. 3652.) [6] So in Moses:      Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey my son thou art gone up; he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? (Gen. 49:9); where it is clearly manifest that in the supreme sense by "Judah" is meant the Lord, and in the representative sense those who are in the good of love to Him. So in David:      When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a barbarous people, Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominion (Ps. 114:1-2); in this passage also "Judah" denotes celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord; and "Israel," celestial truth, or spiritual good. [7] So in Jeremiah:      Behold the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will raise unto David a righteous offshoot, and He shall reign as king, and prosper, and shall execute judgment and righteousness in the earth. In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell securely; and this is His name whereby He shall be called: JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS (Jer. 23:5, 6; 33:15, 16); where the Lord's advent is treated of, "Judah" denoting those who are in the good of love to the Lord; "Israel," those who are in the truth of this good. That by "Judah" is not meant Judah, nor by "Israel" Israel, is evident from the fact that neither Judah nor Israel was saved. In like manner in the same:      I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them as at the first (Jer. 33:7). In the same:      In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the sons of Israel shall come, they and the sons of Judah together; going and weeping shall they go, and shall seek Jehovah their God; and they shall seek Zion in the way with their faces thitherward (Jer. 50:4-5). Again:      At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, for the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem; neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart. In those days the house of Judah shall walk to the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north upon the land (Jer. 3:17-18). [8] Again:      Behold the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast. And I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days; I will put My law in the midst of them, and will write it on their heart (Jer. 31:27, 31, 33). That Israel or the house of Israel is not here meant, is very evident, because they were dispersed among the Gentiles, and were never brought back out of captivity; consequently neither was Judah nor the house of Judah meant, but thereby were signified, in the internal sense, those who are of the Lord's spiritual and celestial kingdom. With these is made a new covenant, and on their heart is the law written; a "new covenant" denoting conjunction with the Lord by means of good (see n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 2037); the "law written on their heart," denoting the consequent perception of good and of truth, and also conscience. [9] So in Joel:      And it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the streams of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall go forth out of the house of Jehovah, and shall water the stream of Shittim. Egypt shall be a waste, and Edom shall be for a wilderness of a waste for the violence done to the sons of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land. But Judah shall abide forever, and Jerusalem to generation and generation (Joel 3:18, 20); from all the particulars in this passage also it is manifest that by "Judah" is not meant Judah, nor by "Jerusalem," Jerusalem, but those who are in the holy of love and of charity; for these "shall abide forever, and to generation and generation." [10] So in Malachi:      Behold I send Mine angel who shall prepare the way before Me; and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the angel of the covenant whom ye desire. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of eternity, and as in former years (Mal. 3:1, 4); where the Lord's advent is treated of. That at that time the offering of Judah and Jerusalem was not pleasant unto Jehovah, is evident; and from this it is manifest that by "Judah and Jerusalem" are signified such things as are of the Lord's church. The case is the same everywhere in the Word where mention is made of "Judah," of "Israel," and of "Jerusalem." From all this then it is evident what is signified by "Judah" in Matthew, namely, the Lord's church, in the present case vastated. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3655.">3655.</a></font></span>
 <p>The subject treated of in the preceding verses from the evangelist, was the first and second state of the church's perversion. That the first state consisted in their beginning no longer to know what is good and what is true, and in disputing together about them, whence came falsities, may be seen above (n. 3354); and that the second state consisted in their despising what is good and true, and also in being averse thereto, and thus in the dying out of faith in the Lord, according to the degrees of the cessation of charity, may be seen above (n. 3487, 3488). So that the subject treated of in this preface is the third state of the church, which is its state of desolation in respect to good and truth.            GENESIS 28      1. And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and commanded him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters of Canaan.      2. Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father, and take thee from thence a woman of the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother.      3. And God Shaddai will bless thee, and will make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and thou shalt be a company of peoples.      4. And He will give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee and to thy seed with thee, to cause thee to inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham.      5. And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.      6. And Esau saw that Isaac blessed Jacob, and sent him to Paddan-aram, to take him from thence a woman, and in blessing him commanded him, saying, Thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters of Canaan.      7. And Jacob hearkened to his father and to his mother, and went to Paddan-aram.      8. And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father.      9. And Esau went to Ishmael, and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, over his women to himself for a woman.      10. And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.      11. And he lighted upon a place, and passed the night there, for the sun was set; and he took of the stones of the place, and placed them for his pillows, and lay down in that place.      12. And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set on the earth, and its head reaching to heaven; and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.      13. And behold Jehovah standing upon it; and He said, I am Jehovah the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.      14. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt break forth to the sea, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south; and in thee shall all the families of the ground be blessed, and in thy seed.      15. And behold I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee back to this ground; for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee.      16. And Jacob awoke out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this place; and I knew it not.      17. And he feared, and said, How terrible is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.      18. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had placed for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the head of it.      19. And he called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of the city was Luz at the first.      20. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me and will keep me in this way wherein I walk, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on.      21. And I return in peace to my father's house, Jehovah shall be to me for God.      22. And this stone which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house; and all that Thou shalt give me, tithing I will tithe it to Thee. </p>

 <p>THE CONTENTS.      In the supreme sense this chapter treats of the Lord, how He began to make His natural Divine both as to truth and as to good; and the means by which He effected this are described in general. But in the representative sense it treats of how the Lord regenerates or makes new the natural of man both as to truth and as to good; the process in general is in like manner described (verses 1-10). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3657.">3657.</a></font></span>
 <p>In the internal supreme sense there is described how the Lord began to make His natural Divine as to truth from the ultimate of order, that thereby He might make disposition of the intermediates, and might conjoin each and all things with the First; that is, with His Divine Itself. But in the internal representative sense there is described how the Lord regenerates the human natural also from the ultimate of order, and thereby disposes the intermediates, in order that through the rational He may conjoin them with Himself (verses 11-22). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3658.">3658.</a></font></span>
 <p>THE INTERNAL SENSE.      Verses 1, 2. And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and commanded him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters of Canaan. Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, thy mother's father, and take thee from thence a woman of the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother. "And Isaac called Jacob," signifies perception by the Lord of the quality in respect to the good of truth; "and blessed him," signifies that thus conjunction would be effected; "and commanded him, and said unto him," signifies reflection and consequent perception; "thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters of Canaan," signifies provided that it be not conjoined with the affections of falsity and evil; "arise" signifies provided it should elevate that good thence; "go to Paddan-aram," signifies the knowledges of such truth; "to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father, and take thee from thence a woman of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother," signifies collateral external good, and the derivative truth that was to be conjoined. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3659.">3659.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Isaac called Jacob. That this signifies perception by the Lord of the quality in respect to the good of truth, is evident from the signification of "calling" anyone as being to perceive the quality (n. 3609); and from the representation of Isaac, as being the Lord as to the Divine good of the Divine rational (n. 1893, 2066, 2072, 2083, 2630, 3012, 3194, 3210); and from the representation of Jacob, as being the Lord as to natural truth (n. 1893, 3305, 3509, 3525, 3546, 3576, 3599). But here, and in what follows in this chapter, Jacob represents the good of this truth; from which it is evident that by the words, "Isaac called Jacob," is signified perception by the Lord of the quality in respect to the good of truth.  [2] The reason why Jacob here represents the good of this truth, is that he has now carried off the birthright of Esau, and also his blessing, and has thereby put on the person of Esau, but still no further than in respect to the good of the truth which he had before represented; for all truth, whatsoever it be and whatsoever its quality, has good within it, inasmuch as truth is not truth except from good; it is from this that it is called truth. By the birthright which he took, and by the blessing, he obtained over Esau the privilege that his posterity should succeed to the promise made to Abraham and Isaac concerning the land of Canaan, and thus that by him should be represented the Lord's Divine natural, as by Isaac was represented the Divine rational, and by Abraham His Divine Itself. In order therefore that the representative might fall upon one person, it was permitted that he should thus take from Esau the birth-right, and afterwards the blessing. Hence it is that Jacob now represents the good of the natural, but here at first the good of that truth, namely, of the truth which he had represented just before. Esau is also still further treated of, as in the following verses (6-8) of this chapter, to the intent that there might be represented the good of truth and the interior truth of good of the Lord's natural, which could not as yet be represented by Jacob. What and of what quality is the good of truth here represented by Jacob, will appear from what follows. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3660.">3660.</a></font></span>
 <p>And blessed him. That this signifies that thus conjunction would be effected, is evident from the signification of being "blessed," as being to be conjoined (see n. 3504, 3514, 3530, 3565, 3584). The reason why Isaac the father now blesses Jacob the son, although he had come with guile and taken the blessing from Esau, and Isaac had shuddered at that deed (as appears from the preceding chapter, verses 33 and 35), is that Isaac now perceived that it was the posterity of Jacob, and not that of Esau, that was to possess the land of Canaan; and therefore the blessing was confirmed by Isaac. But the guile at which Isaac shuddered signified and foretold what was deceptive in the posterity of Jacob in regard to the representatives; that is to say, that they were very far from sincerely or at heart representing the Divine or celestial things of the Lord's kingdom, and were thus utterly unlike the Ancient Church, being merely in externals separate from what is internal, and not even in these, inasmuch as they so often fell away into open idolatries. [2] What is meant by being conjoined, or by conjunction, here signified in the internal sense by being "blessed," was shown above, namely, that the natural as to good and as to truth should be adjoined to the rational, or what is the same thing, the external man to the internal; for in order that the Lord might make His natural Divine, He had to implant therein such good and truth as would correspond with the good and truth of the Divine rational. Without corresponding goods and truths no conjunction is possible. There are innumerable goods and truths of the natural, or such as are proper to the natural man; so innumerable that man can scarcely know their most general kinds, in spite of the fact that when mention is made of natural good and truth it appears to man as one simple thing; for the whole natural and all that is in it is nothing else than this good and truth. And this being the case, it is evident that there are goods and truths of the natural in which the goods and truths of the rational can be, and that there are goods and truths of the natural in which the goods and truths of the rational cannot be; consequently, that there are goods and truths of the natural which can be adjoined to the goods and truths of the rational by correspondence. Such goods and truths are treated of in this and the following chapters.  [3] To know these goods and truths, and to distinguish them from one another, and also to view their qualities, and thus how they are adapted for conjunction, does not so well appear to man so long as he does not think from what is interior, or from enlightenment by the light of heaven; for in this case such things appear to him to be both obscure and undelightful. But nevertheless they are suited to the apprehension and understanding of angels, and even to the apprehension of spirits; for the thoughts of angels and spirits are not distracted by cares for worldly, corporeal, and earthly things, as they had formerly been when they lived as men in the world. Angels and spirits are in the pleasantness of intelligence and the bliss of wisdom when such things are present with them from the internal sense of the Word; for then what is Divine shines upon them, because in the supreme sense the Lord is treated of, and in the representative sense the church and regeneration; and thereby they are in the Lord's Divine sphere, and in that of His ends and uses. </p>

 <p>And commanded him, and said unto him. That this signifies reflection and consequent perception, is evident from the signification in the historicals of the Word of "commanding," as being to reflect; and from the signification of "saying," as being to perceive (see n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862). Reflection is the mental view of a thing in regard to its nature and quality, and from this comes perception. </p>

 <p>Thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters of Canaan. That this signifies provided that it be not conjoined with the affections of falsity and evil, is evident from the signification of "taking a woman," as being to be associated or conjoined; from the signification of "daughters," as being affections (n. 568, 2362, 3024); and from the signification of "Canaan," as being falsity and evil (n. 1093, 1140, 1141, 1167, 1205, 1444, 1573, 1574, 1868). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3663.">3663.</a></font></span>
 <p>Arise. That this signifies provided it should elevate that good thence, is evident from the signification of "arising," as implying some elevation (n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171); in the present case an elevation from such things as are signified by the "daughters of Canaan," to such things as are signified by the "daughters of Laban," concerning which in what follows. </p>

 <p>Go to Paddan-aram. That this signifies the knowledges of such truth, is evident from the signification of "Aram," or "Syria," as being knowledges (see n. 1232, 1234, 3249). That "Paddan-aram" signifies the knowledges of truth is because it was in Syria of the rivers, where Nahor, Bethuel, and Laban dwelt; and that by "Syria" are signified the knowledges of truth may be seen above (n. 3051). Paddan-aram is also mentioned above (25:20), and again below (31:18); in which places likewise it signifies the knowledges of truth. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3665.">3665.</a></font></span>
 <p>To the house of Bethuel, thy mother's father, and take thee from thence a woman of the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother. That this signifies collateral external good, and the derivative truth that was to be conjoined, is evident from the representation of Bethuel, as being the good of the Gentiles of the first class (see n. 2865); from the representation of Laban, as being the affection of good in the natural man, that is the affection of external good, and properly the collateral good of a common stock (n. 3129, 3130, 3160, 3612); and from the signification of "taking a woman of his daughters," as being to be associated to or conjoined with the derivative affections of truth. That "taking a woman" denotes to be conjoined, is manifest, and that "daughters" are affections, may be seen above (n. 568, 2362, 3024). Hence it is evident what these words signify, namely, that the good of the natural, here represented by Jacob, was to be conjoined with the truths derived from collateral external good.  [2] The case herein is this: When man is being regenerated, he is at first led by the Lord as an infant, then as a child, afterwards as a youth, and at last as an adult. The truths he learns as an infant child are altogether external and corporeal, for as yet he is unable to apprehend interior truths. These truths are no other than knowledges of such things as contain, in their inmost, things Divine; for there are knowledges of things that do not contain anything Divine in their inmost; and there are knowledges that do contain it. The knowledges that do contain what is Divine are such that they can admit interior truths more and more, successively, and in order; whereas the knowledges which do not contain what is Divine are such that they do not admit, but reject these interior truths; for the knowledges of external and corporeal good and truth are like ground, which according to its quality admits seeds of one nature and not of another, bringing to maturity one kind of seeds, and suffocating another. Knowledges which contain in their inmost what is Divine, admit into them spiritual and celestial truth and good, possessing this capacity from the Divine which is within, and which disposes; but the knowledges which do not contain in them what is Divine, admit only what is false and evil, such being their nature. Those knowledges of external and corporeal truth which admit spiritual and celestial truth and good, are here signified by the "daughters of Laban of the house of Bethuel;" but those which do not thus admit them, are signified by the "daughters of Canaan." [3] The knowledges which are learned from infancy to childhood are like most general vessels, which are to be filled with goods, and in proportion as they are filled the man is enlightened. If the vessels are such as to admit into them genuine goods, then the man is enlightened from the Divine that is within them, and this successively more and more; but if they are such that genuine goods cannot be in them, then the man is not enlightened. It does appear that he is enlightened, but this is from a fatuous light, which is that of falsity and evil, whereby he is more and more darkened in respect to good and truth.  [4] Such knowledges are manifold, and so manifold that their genera can scarcely be counted; still less can their species be discriminated; for they are derived in many ways from the Divine through the rational into the natural. For some flow in immediately through the good of the rational, and thence into the good of the natural; and also into the truth of this good, and thence further into the external or corporeal natural, where also they divide into various streams. And some flow in mediately through the truth of the rational into the truth of the natural, and also into the good of this truth, and thence further into the external or corporeal natural (see n. 3573, 3616). They are like nations, families, and houses, and like the blood-relationships and the connections therein, there being in them some which descend in a direct line from the first father, and some which descend in a line more and more indirect or collateral. In the heavens these things are most distinct, for all the societies therein, and thus the proximities, are distinguished according to the genera and species of good and truth (n. 685, 2508, 2524, 2556, 2739, 3612). These societies and proximities were represented by the most ancient people, who were celestial men, by their dwelling together classified in this manner into nations, families, and houses (n. 470, 471, 483, 1159, 1246); and for this reason it was enjoined that they who were of the representative church should contract marriages within the families of their own nation; for in this way they could represent heaven, and the conjunction of its societies as to good and truth-as was the case here with Jacob, in that he was to go to the house of Bethuel, his mother's father, and take him a woman of the daughters of Laban, his mother's brother.  [5] With regard to these very knowledges of external or corporeal truth which are from collateral good, and which as before said contain in them what is Divine, and thus are capable of admitting genuine goods-such as are the knowledges with young children who are afterwards regenerated-they are in general such as are contained in the historicals of the Word, such as what is said therein concerning paradise, concerning the first man in it, concerning the tree of life in its midst, and concerning the tree of knowledge, where was the serpent that practiced the deception. These are the knowledges that contain within them what is Divine, and admit into them spiritual and celestial goods and truths, because they represent and signify these goods and truths. Such knowledges also are all other things in the historicals of the Word, as what is said concerning the tabernacle and the temple and concerning the construction of these; in like manner what is said concerning the garments of Aaron and of his sons; also concerning the feasts of tabernacles, of the firstfruits of harvest, of unleavened bread, and concerning other like things. When such knowledges as these are known and thought of by a young child, the angels who are with him think of the Divine things which they represent and signify; and because the angels are affected therewith, their affection is communicated, and causes the delight and pleasure which the child experiences therein; and prepares his mind to receive genuine truths and goods. Such and very many others are the knowledges of external and corporeal truth that are derived from collateral good. </p>

 <p>Verses 3-5. And God Shaddai will bless thee, and will make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and thou shalt be a company of peoples. And He will give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee and to thy seed with thee, to cause thee to inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham. And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau. "And God Shaddai will bless thee," signifies the temptations of that truth and good through which there is conjunction; "and will make thee fruitful and multiply thee," signifies the derivative goods and truths; "and thou shalt be a company of peoples," signifies abundance; "and He will give thee the blessing of Abraham," signifies the conjunction of the Divine Itself with the good and truth of the natural; "to thee and to thy seed with thee," signifies with the good and its derivative truth; "to cause thee to inherit the land of thy sojournings," signifies the life of instructions; which God gave unto Abraham," signifies which is from the Divine; "and Isaac sent away Jacob," signifies the beginning of manifestation; "and he went to Paddan-aram," signifies here as before the knowledges of that truth; "to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean," signifies collateral good; "the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau," signifies the affinity from the mother, with the good of truth which is "Jacob," and with the truth of good which is "Esau." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3667.">3667.</a></font></span>
 <p>And God Shaddai will bless thee. That this signifies the temptations of that truth and good through which there is conjunction, is evident from the signification of "God Shaddai," as being temptations (concerning which signification in what follows); and from the signification of being "blessed," as being conjunction (see n. 3504, 3514, 3530, 3565, 3584). Inasmuch as by Jacob is now represented the good of truth, as before shown (n. 3659), therefore that good and truth are here meant by "thee." The reason why "God Shaddai" signifies temptations, is that in ancient times they distinguished the Supreme God (that is, the Lord) by various names, and this in accordance with His attributes, and in accordance with the goods which are from Him, and also in accordance with the truths, the multiplicity of which is a fact that is known to everyone. They who were of the Ancient Church by all these appellations understood only one God, namely, the Lord, whom they called Jehovah; but after the church had declined from good and truth, and at the same time from this wisdom, they began to worship as many gods as there were appellations of the one God; insomuch that every nation, and at last every family, acknowledged one of them for its own god; hence came the many gods of which mention is often made in the Word.  [2] The same thing took place in the family of Terah the father of Abraham, and also in the house of Abraham himself, who worshiped other gods (as may be seen above, n. 1356, 2559), and especially the God Shaddai (n. 1992). That the worship of this God remained in that house, is evident also from these words in Moses:      I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, in God Shaddai, but by My name Jehovah I was not known to them (Exod. 6:3). This is the reason why it was said to Abraham: "I am God Shaddai; walk before Me, and be perfect" (Gen. 17:1); and why it is here said by Isaac to Jacob, "God Shaddai will bless thee." That this is the case is also clearly evident from what follows in this chapter, in that after the Lord had said to Jacob in a dream, "I am Jehovah the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac" (verse 13), still Jacob afterwards said, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way wherein I walk, and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, and I return in peace to my father's house, then Jehovah shall be to me for God" (verses 20, 21); from which it is evident that neither did the house of Jacob acknowledge Jehovah; but that Jacob would acknowledge Him as his God if He would be his benefactor-just as is the case at this day in Christian Gentilism. [3] But as specifically regards God Shaddai, the Lord had been so called in the Ancient Church with respect to temptations and to blessings and benefits after temptations, as was shown in volume 2 (n. 1992). This is the reason why by "God Shaddai" in the internal sense are signified temptations. That by temptations is effected a conjunction of good and truth, see what has already been stated and shown concerning temptations (n. 2819). </p>

 <p>And will make thee fruitful and multiply thee. That this signifies the derivative goods and truths, is evident from the mention of "being fruitful," as having reference to good; and of "being multiplied," as having reference to truth (n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3669.">3669.</a></font></span>
 <p>And thou shalt be a company of peoples. That this signifies abundance, is evident without explication; a "company of peoples" is specifically predicated of truths, for by "peoples" in the Word are signified those who are in truth (n. 1259, 1260, 2928, 3581), whereas by "nations" are signified those who are in good (n. 1259, 1260, 1416, 1849). It is here said a "company of peoples," because the subject treated of is the good of truth represented by Jacob; for the good which is from truth is one thing, and the good from which is truth is another; the good which is from truth is that which is here called "Jacob," and the good from which is truth is that which is called "Esau." The good which is from truth is inverse to the good from which is truth. Those who are being regenerated, before their regeneration is completed, are in the good which is from truth; whereas the same when regenerated are in the good from which is truth. That their state is inverse may be seen above (n. 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576, 3603). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3670.">3670.</a></font></span>
 <p>And He will give thee the blessing of Abraham. That this signifies the conjunction of the Divine Itself with the good and truth of the natural, is evident from the signification of a "blessing," as being conjunction (n. 3660, 3667); and from the representation of Abraham, as being the Lord's Divine Itself which is called the "Father" (concerning which see n. 2011, 3251, 3439). And inasmuch as these words are spoken to Jacob, by whom there would be represented the Lord's Divine natural as to the Divine good and truth therein, therefore the conjunction of the Divine Itself with the good and truth of the natural is what is signified, in the internal sense, by "He will give thee the blessing of Abraham." In the sense of the letter, it is the possession of the land of Canaan that is meant by the "blessing of Abraham," and also by the words which follow: "to cause thee to inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham;" and according to this sense do all apprehend the words who believe that the historicals of the Word do not contain within them things more heavenly and secret: and especially so do the Jewish nation, who on the strength of these words claim for themselves privileges above every other nation and people. Their fathers understood the words in the same manner, and especially were they so understood by Jacob, whose quality is evident from what was said just above (n. 3667), in that he would not have known Jehovah, nor have been willing to acknowledge Him, unless He had given him corporeal and worldly blessings. But that neither Abraham, nor Isaac, nor Jacob was meant, and that by Jacob is represented the Lord as to the natural which He would make Divine, is abundantly manifest from the explications given above. That it is immaterial what is the quality of the man who represents, as to whether he is evil or good, and that evil men equally with good men can represent and have represented the Lord's Divine, may be seen above (n. 665, 1097, 1361).  [2] The same may be seen from the representatives which exist even to this day; for all kings, whoever they may be, and of whatever quality, by the royalty itself that appertains to them represent the Lord; in like manner all priests, whoever and of whatever quality they may be, by the priestly office itself. The royal and the priestly office itself is holy, whatever be the quality of him who ministers therein; and this is the reason why the Word taught by an evil man is equally holy, and also the sacrament of baptism and the Holy Supper, and other such things. And from this it is also evident that no king can possibly claim for himself anything of the sanctity that belongs to his royalty; nor any priest anything of the sanctity that belongs to his priesthood. Insofar as either claims anything thereof to himself, or attributes it to himself, so far he brands himself with the character of a spiritual thief, or with the mark of spiritual theft; and also insofar as he does evil, that is, acts contrary to what is just and equitable, and contrary to what is good and true, so far a king puts off the representative of holy royalty, and a priest the representative of holy priesthood, and represents the opposite. For this reason in the representative Jewish Church there were so many laws enjoined concerning the holiness in which priests especially should be during their ministration-on which subject, of the Lord's Divine mercy, more will be said in what follows. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3671.">3671.</a></font></span>
 <p>To thee and to thy seed with thee. That this signifies with the good and its derivative truth, is evident from the representation of Jacob, who is here meant by "thee," as being the good of truth, or the good which is from truth (concerning which see above); and from the signification of "seed," as being the good and truth of faith (n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 2848, 3373). "With thee" signifies that it was adjoined to the good of truth which is "Jacob." With good and truth the case is the same as with seeds and the ground; interior good is as the seed which brings forth, but only in good ground; exterior good and truth are as the ground in which the seed brings forth; this seed (that is, interior good and truth) cannot otherwise be rooted. For this reason man's rational is first of all regenerated, for therein are seeds, and afterwards the natural, in order that it may serve as ground (n. 3286, 3288, 3321, 3368, 3493, 3576, 3620, 3623); and since the natural is as ground, good and truth are capable of being made fruitful and multiplying in the rational, which could not be the case unless they had ground somewhere, in which they might take root like seed. From this comparison it may be seen as in a mirror how the case is with regeneration and with many of its arcana.  [2] To understand good and truth and to will them is of the rational; the perceptions of good and truth therefrom are as seed; but to know them and bring them into act is of the natural. The very memory-knowledges and works are like ground, and when man is affected with the memory-knowledges which confirm good and truth; and especially when he feels a delight in bringing them into act, the seeds are therein, and grow as in their ground. By this means good is made fruitful, and truth is multiplied, and they continually ascend from this ground into the rational, and perfect it. The case is otherwise when man understands good and truth, and also inwardly perceives some inclination of will thereto, but yet does not love to know them, and still less to do them. In this case good cannot be made fruitful nor truth be multiplied, in the rational. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3672.">3672.</a></font></span>
 <p>To cause thee to inherit the land of thy sojournings. That this signifies the life of instructions, is evident from the signification of "inheriting," as being to have another's life (n. 2658, 2851); in the present case, life from the Divine, which is signified by the words which presently follow; and from the signification of "sojournings," as being instructions (n. 1463, 2025); "land" signifies where life is. The life of instructions here treated of is the life of good from truth, which is here represented by Jacob; for when man lives according to the truths in which he is instructed, he is then in the life of instructions. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3673.">3673.</a></font></span>
 <p>Which God gave unto Abraham. That this signifies which is from the Divine, is evident from the representation of Abraham, as being the Lord as to the Divine which in the Word is called the "Father" (n. 2011, 3251, 3439). That "God gave" signifies that it was appropriated to the Lord, is evident; for that which is given is his to whom it is given. Hence it is manifest that by the words "which God gave unto Abraham," is signified life which is from the Divine. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3674.">3674.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Isaac sent away Jacob. That this signifies the beginning of manifestation [existentia] is evident from the fact that Jacob now begins to represent the good of truth, thus the beginning of the manifestation of the Lord's Divine natural; for this is contained in what follows concerning the sojourning of Jacob with Laban. Wherefore by "Isaac sent away Jacob" is signified the beginning of manifestation. </p>

 <p>To Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean. That this signifies collateral good, is evident from the representation of Laban, as being collateral good of a common stock (concerning which see also above, n. 3665); and from the representation of Bethuel, as being the good of the Gentiles of the first class (see n. 2865, 3665), from which as from a common stock comes the good which is represented by Laban. The reason why Bethuel is here surnamed the "Aramean," is that by "Aram" or "Syria" are signified the knowledges of good and truth (see n. 1232, 1234, 3249), which are here treated of. External truth, from which is the good here represented by Jacob, is nothing else than knowledges; for these are the truths which are learned first of all, and are also accounted as truths by those who are in the beginning of regeneration. Yet knowledges are not truths in themselves, but from the Divine things within them; and when these Divine things shine forth, the knowledges for the first time become truths. Meanwhile they are like general vessels, through which and in which truths can be received, like those spoken of above (n. 3665), and like all the memory-knowledges that are first learned. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3677.">3677.</a></font></span>
 <p>The brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau. That this signifies the affinity from the mother with the good of truth which is "Jacob" and with the truth of good which is "Esau," is evident from the representation of Rebekah, as being the Lord's Divine rational as to Divine truth (of which frequently above); and from the representation of Jacob, as being the good of truth, or the good which is from truth in the natural; and from the representation of Esau, as being the truth of good, or the good from which is truth in the natural (see above, n. 3669). And because all the goods and truths that are in the natural or external man are conceived and born of the rational or internal man; that is, of the good of the rational as a father, and of the truth thereof as a mother (n. 3314, 3573, 3616), therefore by the above words is signified the affinity from the mother with the good of truth which is "Jacob" and with the truth of good which is "Esau." [2] Moreover they are circumstanced in precisely the same way; but to explain these things to the apprehension is very difficult, because even the most general facts in regard to the subject are at this day unknown-as for instance, what spiritual good is and what its truth, and that there are innumerable genera of good and its truth, and still more innumerable species, also that they are conjoined with each other by degrees as it were of consanguinity and affinity. These most general things being unknown, a description of the degrees and affinities would fall into mere shade, and the more so because the learned of the day do not desire to know such things, for they love to stray in the mere shell; and to dispute, not concerning the quality of such things, but whether they exist or not; and so long as they are in this state they desire to know nothing whatever concerning these innumerable kinds of good and truth. </p>

 <p>Verses 6-9. And Esau saw that Isaac blessed Jacob, and sent him to Paddan-aram, to take him from thence a woman, and in blessing him commanded him, saying, Thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters of Canaan. And Jacob hearkened to his father and to his mother, and went to Paddan-aram. And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father. And Esau went to Ishmael, and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, over his women to himself for a woman. "And Esau saw that Isaac blessed Jacob," signifies the thought of natural good concerning conjunction by the good of truth, which is "Jacob;" "and sent him to Paddan-aram," signifies the beginning of manifestation through the knowledges of this good; "to take him from thence a woman," signifies conjunction thereby through the affection of truth; "and in blessing him commanded him, saying," signifies reflection and thence perception in order that conjunction might be effected; "thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters of Canaan," signifies that he should not be conjoined with the affections of falsity and evil; "and Jacob hearkened to his father and to his mother," signifies obedience and affection; and went to Paddan-aram," signifies here as above to become imbued with those knowledges of good and truth; "and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father," signifies the Lord's foresight and providence that the affections of that truth with which natural good had been heretofore conjoined would not conduce to conjunction; "and Esau went to Ishmael, and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son," signifies the conjunction of this good with truth from a Divine origin; "the sister of Nebaioth, over his women to himself for a woman," signifies the affection of celestial truth more interiorly. </p>

That this signifies the thought of natural good concerning conjunction through the good of truth which is "Jacob," is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being to think; for thinking is nothing else than seeing inwardly, or internal sight; and from the representation of Esau, as being the good of the natural (see n. 3300, 3302, 3322, 3494, 3504, 3576, 3599); from the signification of being "blessed," as being conjunction (n. 3504, 3514, 3530, 3565, 3584); from the representation of Isaac, as being the Lord's Divine rational as to Divine good (treated of above); and from the representation of Jacob, as being the good of truth (n. 3669, 3677). From all this it is evident that by "Esau saw that Isaac blessed Jacob," is signified the thought of natural good concerning conjunction through the good of truth.  [2] What is meant by the thought of natural good concerning conjunction through the good of truth cannot be fully explained to the apprehension, but yet must be briefly explained. The thought of natural good is the thought of the rational or internal man within the natural or external man, and indeed from the good of the latter; for it is the rational or internal man which thinks, and not the natural or external man; the former, or internal man, is in the light of heaven, in which light there is intelligence and wisdom from the Lord (n. 3195, 3339, 3636, 3643); but the external man is in the light of the world, in which there is no intelligence, and not even life; and therefore unless the internal man were to think within the external, it would not be possible to think at all. And yet thought appears to man to be in his external man, inasmuch as he thinks from those things which have entered in by the senses and are of the world. [3] The case is the same as with the sight of the eye. The sensuous man supposes that the eye sees of itself, when yet the eye is merely an organ of the body by which the internal man sees those things which are out of the body, or which are in the world. It is also the same as with speech. The sensuous man would suppose that the mouth and tongue speak of themselves; and they who think somewhat more deeply, that the larynx and interior organs speak by breath from the lungs; when yet it is the thought which speaks by means of these organs, for speech is nothing but thought speaking. There are many such fallacies of the senses. The case is the same in regard to all apparent life in the external man in that it is the life of the internal man therein as in its material and corporeal organ.  [4] With respect to thought, the case is this: So long as man lives in the body he thinks from the rational in the natural, but with a difference accordingly as the natural corresponds to the rational, or does not so correspond. When the natural corresponds, the man is rational, and thinks spiritually; but when the natural does not correspond, the man is not rational, nor can he think spiritually; for with the man whose natural corresponds to his rational the communication is opened, so that the light of heaven from the Lord can flow in through the rational into the natural, and enlighten it with intelligence and wisdom; hence the man becomes rational and thinks spiritually. But with the man whose natural does not correspond to the rational the communication is closed, and there only flows in somewhat of light in general round about, and through chinks through the rational into the natural; and the result is that the man is not rational, and does not think spiritually; for a man thinks according to the influx of the light of heaven that he enjoys. This shows that every man thinks according to the state of correspondence in respect to good and truth of the natural with the rational. [5] But spirits and angels do not think in the same way as man; their thought is indeed also terminated in a natural, for they have with them all the natural memory and its affections, but are not allowed to use this memory (see n. 2475-2479); yet although they are not allowed to use it, it nevertheless serves them as a plane, or as a foundation, in order that the ideas of their thought may be terminated therein. Hence it is that the ideas of their thought are more interior, and their speech is not as with man from forms of words, but from forms of actual things; showing that their thought also is such as is the correspondence of their natural with their rational; and that there are spirits who are rational, who think spiritually, and also those who are not rational, who do not think spiritually; and this exactly in accordance with their affections and consequent thoughts of things in the life of the body; that is, with the state of life they had acquired in the world.  [6] From this it may in some measure appear what the thought of natural good is, namely, that it is thought in the good of the natural. According to the idea of spirits that is called the thought of natural good which according to the idea of men is called thought in the good of the natural. In this latter, that is, in the good of the natural, the rational thinks when it has regard to good as the end. Thus the thought of natural good concerning conjunction through the good of truth, is thought in the natural concerning the end, namely, how truth can be conjoined therewith; and this according to Divine order by the common way; which, as has often been said above, is from such things as are external, and thus which are the ultimate or last in order; for all the regeneration of the natural commences from these. These last or ultimate things are the first knowledges, such as are those of infants and children, concerning which see above (n. 3665). [7] In the beginning the truth of good, which is "Esau," is not conjoined in the external form with the good of truth, which is "Jacob;" for the good of truth is inverse in respect to the truth of good (n. 3669); but still they are inmostly conjoined, that is, in respect to ends. For the end of the truth which is from good is that truths may be adjoined to it according to order; and this also is the end of the good which is from truth; and inasmuch as the end conjoins, therefore they are conjoined (n. 3562, 3565). The inverse of order is at first only a means that has respect to the end. </p>

 <p>And sent him to Paddan-aram. That this signifies the beginning of manifestation [existentia] through the knowledges of this good, is evident from the signification of "sending him," as being the beginning of manifestation (n. 3674); and from the signification of "Paddan-aram," as being the knowledges of truth (n. 3664). They are called the knowledges of good, because all truths are knowledges of good; and truths which are not from good, or which do not look to good as the end, are not truths; but insofar as they look to doctrine, they are called the knowledges of truth. </p>

 <p>To take him from thence a woman. That this signifies conjunction thereby through the affection of truth, is evident from the signification of a "woman," as being the affection of truth (n. 1468, 2517, 3236) to receive which is to be adjoined thereto. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3682.">3682.</a></font></span>
 <p>And in blessing him commanded him, saying. That this signifies reflection and thence perception in order that conjunction might be effected, is evident from the signification of being "blessed," as being conjunction (n. 3504, 3514, 3530, 3565, 3584); and from the signification of "commanding and saying," as being reflection and consequent perception (n. 3661). </p>

 <p>Thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters of Canaan. That this signifies that he should not be conjoined with the affections of falsity and evil, is evident from the signification of "taking a woman," as being to be associated and conjoined; and from the signification of the "daughters of Canaan," as being the affections of falsity and evil (see above, n. 3662). </p>

 <p>And Jacob hearkened to his father and to his mother. That this signifies obedience and affection, is evident from the signification of "hearkening" or "listening to anyone" as being to obey (n. 2542); and when to the father and mother, it signifies obedience from affection. </p>

 <p>And went to Paddan-aram. That this signifies to become imbued with the knowledges of that good and truth, is evident from the signification of "going" and "journeying," as being the order and plan of life (see n. 1293, 3335); here therefore to become imbued with according to order, namely, with the knowledges of that good and truth which are signified by "Paddan-aram" (see n. 3664, 3675). </p>

 <p>And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father. That this signifies the Lord's foresight and providence, that the affections of that truth with which natural good had been heretofore conjoined would not conduce to conjunction, is evident from the signification here of "seeing," as being foresight and providence (see n. 2837, 2839); and from the representation of Esau, as being the Lord in respect to the Divine good of the natural (concerning which see above); from the signification of the "daughters of Canaan," here the daughters of Heth, as being the affections of truth from a ground not genuine (n. 3470, 3620, 3621, 3622); and from the signification of "being evil in the eyes of Isaac his father," as being not to conduce to conjunction, namely, through the good of the natural, which is "Esau," with the good of the rational, which is "Isaac." From all this it is evident that by these words is signified the Lord's foresight and providence, that the affections of that truth, because not from a genuine ground, would not conduce to conjunction. How the case herein is, may be seen from the explication at chapter 26, verses 34, 35, where the daughters of Heth are treated of whom Esau had taken to himself for women; and at chapter 27, verse 46, where it is said of Jacob that he should not take to himself a woman of the daughters of Canaan [Heth]. That by the "daughters of Canaan" are here signified the affections of truth from a ground not genuine, and above by the "daughters of Canaan," the affections of falsity and evil (n. 3662, 3683), is because the Hittites were of the Church of the Gentiles in the land of Canaan, and were not so much in falsity and evil as were the other nations there-the Canaanites, Amorites, and Perizzites. Hence also by the Hittites there was represented the Lord's spiritual church among the Gentiles (n. 2913, 2986).  [2] That the Most Ancient Church, which was celestial and existed before the flood, was in the land of Canaan, may be seen above (n. 567); and that the Ancient Church, which was after the flood, was also in that land, and moreover in a number of other kingdoms, see above (n. 1238, 2385). From this it came to pass that all the nations in that land, and likewise all the regions and all the rivers thereof, became representative; for the most ancient people, who were celestial men, by means of all the objects which they saw, perceived such things as are of the Lord's kingdom (n. 920, 1409, 2896, 2897, 2995); thus also by means of the regions and rivers of that land. After their times these representatives remained in the Ancient Church, thus also the representatives of the places in that land. The Word in the Ancient Church (n. 2897-2899), also had thence the names of places representative, as had also the Word after their time which is called "Moses and the Prophets;" and because this was so, Abraham was commanded to go thither, and a promise was made him that his posterity should possess that land; and this not because of their being better than other nations, for they were among the worst of all (n. 1167, 3373), but in order that by them a representative church might be instituted, in which no attention should be paid to person or to place, but to the things that were represented (n. 3670); and that thereby also the names used in the Most Ancient and the Ancient Church might be retained. </p>

 <p>And Esau went to Ishmael, and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son. That this signifies the conjunction of this good with truth from a Divine origin, is evident from the representation of Esau, as being the good of the natural (concerning which see above); and from the representation of Ishmael, Abraham's son, as being truth from a Divine origin. That Ishmael represents the Lord's spiritual church, consequently truth, may be seen above (n. 1949-1951, 2078, 2691, 2699, 3268); and that Abraham represents the Lord's Divine called the "Father," see above (n. 2011, 3251, 3439). Hence by "Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael the son of Abraham," is signified truth from a Divine origin. That "taking a wife" signifies to be associated and conjoined, is manifest; and from this it is evident that by "Esau going to Ishmael, and taking Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son," is signified the conjunction of this good with truth from a Divine origin. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3688.">3688.</a></font></span>
 <p>The sister of Nebaioth, over his women to himself for a woman. That this signifies the affection of celestial truth more interiorly, is evident from the signification of "sister," as being intellectual or rational truth (see n. 1495, 2508, 2524, 2556, 3386); from the representation of Nebaioth, as being the good which is of the spiritual church (n. 3268); from which the "sister of Nebaioth" signifies the affection of celestial truth; or what is the same thing, the affection of spiritual good; from the signification of "women," or the "daughters of Heth," as being the affections of truth from a ground not genuine (n. 3470, 3620-3622, 3686); and from the signification of "taking a woman," as being to be associated and conjoined. From this it is evident that by these words, together with those immediately preceding, there is signified the conjunction of the good represented by Esau with truth from a Divine origin, thus with the affection of celestial truth more interiorly. [2] How these things are circumstanced has indeed been already stated, but they are such as are understood with difficulty so long as the most general things of the subject are unknown. Moreover at the present day the world cares not for such things, because earthly things and not heavenly ones are the objects of its care, for the reason as they allege, that they see and know the former things, while the latter they neither see nor know. But inasmuch as the things contained in the internal sense of the Word are not merely to be disclosed, but are also to be explained, we may illustrate by an example how the case is with the truth of good that Esau represents and the good of truth that Jacob represents; and at the same time how the case is with the fact that before the man has been regenerated the good of truth is the inverse of the truth of good; but that they are afterwards conjoined; thus how the case is with all that has been said before.  [3] Let the following serve as the example: A man who is such as to be capable of being regenerated-for the Lord foresees, and since He foresees, He also provides for this-at first, like an infant child, does not yet know what works of charity toward his neighbor are, because he does not as yet know what charity is, nor what his neighbor is, and therefore as he knows from the Word that he ought to give to the poor, and that whoever gives to the poor has a reward in heaven, he does good to beggars more than to others, because he believes that they are the poor who are meant in the Word, not considering that such as beg in the streets for the most part live an impious and wicked life, despise whatever belongs to Divine worship, and surrender themselves to mere sloth and idleness. Nevertheless he who is in the first state of regeneration does good to such persons from his heart; and these good deeds are the goods of external truth from which regeneration begins; the truth of good, which is interior, flows thus into these acts, and does the work according to the knowledges in which the child is.  [4] But afterwards, when he is more enlightened, he is desirous to do good to all whom he believes to be in want and distress; but as yet hardly makes a distinction between the pious and the impious who are in this state, believing everyone to be his neighbor in the same respect and degree. But when he is further enlightened in these matters, he then makes the distinction, and renders aid only to the upright and good, knowing that to aid the wicked is to do harm to many, inasmuch as by his benefits and services he supplies the wicked with the means of injuring others. At last, when he is regenerate, he does good only to the good and pious, because he is then affected not with the person of him to whom he does good, but with the good that is in him; and inasmuch as the Lord is present in what is good and pious, he thereby through his affection for what is good testifies his love to the Lord. When the man is in this charity from the heart, he is regenerate. [5] From this it is evident that his former state was inverse in respect to this state, inasmuch as he had believed that to be good which was not good; but still at the beginning of regeneration he must needs do that good, because his knowledge of the matter then goes no further; and because the interior good of charity could not flow into any other truth than that which was of the knowledge thereof; and it is also evident that interior good had always been present and had wrought this, but was not able to manifest itself until by knowledges the man had been successively enlightened concerning the true nature of goods and truths. From this it is in some measure evident what the good of truth is which Jacob here represents; and what the truth of good which Esau represents; and that at first these are inverse, but afterwards are conjoined. </p>

 <p>Verses 10, 11. And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. And he lighted upon a place, and passed the night there, for the sun was set; and he took of the stones of the place, and placed them for his pillows, and lay down in that place. "And Jacob went out from Beersheba" signifies life more remote from Divine doctrinal things; "and went toward Haran," signifies the good and truth of that degree; "and he lighted upon a place," signifies the state; "and passed the night there, for the sun was set," signifies life in what is obscure; "and he took of the stones of the place," signifies the truths of that state; "and placed them for his pillows," signifies communication of a most general nature with the Divine; "and lay down in that place," signifies the tranquillity of the state. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3690.">3690.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Jacob went out from Beersheba. That this signifies life more remote from Divine doctrinal things, is evident from the signification of "going," as being to live (see n. 3335, 3685); thus "going out" signifies living more remotely; and from the signification of "Beersheba" as being Divine doctrine (see n. 2723, 2858, 2859, 3466); hence it is evident that by "Jacob went out from Beersheba" is signified life more remote from Divine doctrinal things. Life is said to be more remote when it is in external truths, and is lived according to them, as is the life of the infancy and childhood of those who are being regenerated (concerning whom see above, n. 3688). [2] In order to show further what this life is, and what its quality, it may be expedient to add a few words. All the histories of the Word are truths more remote from essential Divine doctrinal things, but still are of service to little children and older children, in order that thereby they may be by degrees introduced into the interior doctrinal matters of truth and good; and at last to Divine things themselves; for within them, in their inmost, is the Divine. While children are reading them and are affected by them from innocence, the angels who are with them are in a happy celestial state, being affected from the Lord with the internal sense, consequently with those things which the historical facts represent and signify; and it is the celestial happiness of the angels that flows in and causes the delight with the children. In order that this first state may exist, that is, the first state of infancy and childhood of those to be regenerated, the histories of the Word were given, and were so written that all things therein both in general and in particular contain within them things Divine.  [3] How far removed these historical matters are from Divine doctrinal things can be seen from the following example from them. When anyone first knows only that God descended on Mount Sinai, and gave tables to Moses, on which were written the Ten Commandments, and that Moses broke those tables, and that God wrote like commandments on other tables; while delighted solely with this history, he is in the life of external truth remote from Divine doctrinal things; but afterwards when he begins to be delighted and affected with the commandments or precepts themselves therein contained, and lives according to them, he is then in the life of truth, yet still remote from the Divine doctrinal things themselves. For a life according to the commandments is only a moral life, the precepts whereof are known to all who live in human society, from civil life itself and the laws thereof-as that the Deity is to be worshiped, and parents honored; and that murder, adultery, and theft must not be committed. [4] But he who is being regenerated is led by degrees from this more remote life (that is, moral life), into a life nearer to Divine doctrinal things; that is, into spiritual life. When this comes to pass the man begins to wonder why such commandments or precepts were sent down from heaven in so miraculous a manner, and written on tables by the finger of God, when yet they are known to every people, and are also written in the laws of those who have never heard anything from the Word. If when he comes into this state of thought he is among those who are capable of being regenerated, he is brought by the Lord into a still more interior state, namely, into a state of thinking that deeper things lie concealed therein, with which as yet he is unacquainted; and when he reads the Word in this state, he finds everywhere in the Prophets, and especially in the Evangelists, that each one of these precepts contains within it things still more heavenly.  [5] For example, in respect to the honoring of parents, he now sees that when men are born anew, that is, when being regenerated, they receive another Father, and then become His sons, and that it is He who is to be honored; thus that this is the sense that lies hidden within this precept. And by degrees he learns that this new Father is the Lord; and at last that He is to be honored by being worshiped, and that He is worshiped when He is loved. When one who is being regenerated is in this truth, and in a life according to it, he is in Divine doctrine, and is then in an angelic state, and from this state looks at the things he before knew as following on in order, and as flowing from the Divine as it were according to the steps of a ladder, above which is Jehovah or the Lord; and on the steps whereof are His angels ascending and descending; thus he sees the things with which he had previously been delighted as more remote from him according to degrees. The case is the same with the other precepts of the Decalogue (see n. 2609). From this it is now evident what is meant by a life more remote from Divine doctrinal things, which is here signified by "Jacob went out from Beersheba." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3691.">3691.</a></font></span>
 <p>And went toward Haran. That this signifies to the good and truth of that degree, is evident from the signification of "Haran," as being external good and truth, for by "Haran" is signified what is external, and by "Laban" who dwelt there, good and truth; thus by "Haran" is here meant external good and truth. (That this is the signification of "Haran" may be seen above, n. 1430, 3612.) It follows that by "Jacob went forth from Beersheba and went to Haran," in the internal sense is signified that he betook himself further from Divine doctrinal things; thus to external good and truth.  [2] It is said "to good and truth of that degree," because goods and truths are perfectly distinguished from each other according to degrees; interior goods and truths being in a higher degree, and exterior ones in a lower degree. In a higher degree are the goods and truths of the rational; in a lower degree are the goods and truths of the natural; and in the lowest are the sensuous goods and truths of the body. Interior goods and truths, or those of a higher degree, flow into exterior goods and truths, or those of a lower degree, and exhibit therein an image of themselves, almost as man's interior affections exhibit themselves in the countenance and its changes. From this it is manifest that interior goods and truths are completely separate from exterior goods and truths, or what is the same, those in a higher degree from those in a lower one; so separate that it is possible for the interior ones, or those in a higher degree, to exist quite apart from the exterior ones, or those in a lower degree. He who has not a distinct notion of degrees cannot have a distinct notion of interior and exterior goods, nor how the case is with man's soul, or with his spirit and body, nor how it is with the heavens in the other life. [3] That there are three heavens is known, and that one heaven is more interior than another, and that the third heaven is inmost. These heavens are most distinct from each other according to degrees. They who are in the inmost or third heaven are nearest the Lord; they who are in the interior or second heaven are more remote; and they who are in the exterior or first heaven are still more remote. No other communication between these heavens is possible than such as is that of man's inmosts with his exteriors; for the man who is in love to the Lord and in charity toward his neighbor is a little heaven that in an image corresponds to the three heavens, and he receives the influx of good and truth out of the three heavens from the Lord according to the same degrees. The relative nature of these degrees to one another may be seen from the two cases adduced above (n. 3688, 3690). [4] They who are in real love to the Lord, so as to have a perception of it, are in a higher degree of good and truth, and are in the inmost or third heaven; thus are nearer to the Lord, and are called celestial angels. They who are in charity toward the neighbor so as to have a perception of charity, and not so much a perception of love to the Lord, are in a lower degree of good and truth, and are in the interior or second heaven; thus are more remote from the Lord, and are called spiritual angels. But they who are in charity toward the neighbor merely from the affection of truth, so as not to have a perception of charity itself toward the neighbor, except from the truth with which they are affected, are in a still lower degree of good and truth, and are in the exterior or first heaven; thus are still more remote from the Lord, and are called good spirits.  [5] From this it may in some measure be evident how the case is in respect to degrees; namely, that those things which are in a higher degree exhibit themselves in an image in those which are in the degree next lower. In love to the Lord there is a proximate image of the Lord, which is called a "likeness," wherefore they who are in love itself to the Lord are called His "likenesses." In charity there is also an image of the Lord (only more remote), for in true charity the Lord is present; and therefore they who are therein are called His "images" (n. 50, 51, 1013); while they who are in the affection of truth, and thence in a certain species of charity toward the neighbor, are also images of the Lord, but still more remotely. The three heavens are distinguished into these degrees, and according to these degrees the Lord flows in with Divine good and truth, thus with wisdom and intelligence, and with heavenly joy and happiness. </p>

 <p>And he lighted upon a place. That this signifies the state, is evident from the signification of "place," as being state (see n. 1273-1275, 1377, 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3693.">3693.</a></font></span>
 <p>And passed the night there, for the sun was set. That this signifies life in what is obscure, is evident from the signification of "night," as being a state of shade (n. 1712); thus "passing the night" signifies living in this state; and from the signification of the "sun being set," as being to be in what is obscure; for it is then "evening," and that "evening" signifies that which is obscure, may be seen above (n. 3056). By that which is obscure is here meant obscurity of intelligence in respect to truth, and obscurity of wisdom in respect to good; for the light which the angels have from the Lord has within it intelligence and wisdom, and is also thence derived (see n. 1521, 1524, 1529, 1530, 3138, 3167, 3195, 3339, 3341, 3636, 3637, 3643); and therefore insofar as they are in light, so far they are also in intelligence and wisdom; but insofar as they are not in light, thus insofar as they are in shade, so far they are not in intelligence and wisdom (n. 2776, 3190, 3337). It is for this reason that in common speech "light" is predicated of the things of the understanding. Man is not aware of this reason, and therefore believes that these terms are used merely by way of comparison. Men use many other forms of expression that flow from a perception of such things as exist in the other life, in which they are as to their spirits, and that have been received in conversation because they are interiorly acknowledged, but are blotted out of notice by the things of the body, which are of such a nature as to extinguish the things of perception in which man's interior man is. [2] That in the Word the "setting of the sun" signifies the falsity and evil in which they are who have no charity and faith; thus that it signifies also the last time of the church, may be seen above (n. 1837); and also that it signifies obscurity in respect to those things which are of good and truth, such as exists with those who are in a degree more remote from Divine doctrinal things, may be seen above (n. 3691). That the "setting of the sun," or the "sun being set," has these significations, may be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Micah:      Night unto you instead of vision; and darkness unto you instead of divination; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them (Micah 3:6); "the sun shall go down upon the prophets" signifies that they have no longer any truth and understanding of truth; "prophets" denote those who teach the truths of doctrine (see n. 2534). In Amos:      It shall come to pass in that day that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the day of light; and I will turn your feast into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation (Amos 8:9-10); "to cause the sun to go down at noon" denotes obscurity as to truth with those who are in the knowledges of good and truth (that "noon" signifies a state of light, or of the knowledges of truth, see above, n. 1458, 3195). [3] In Isaiah:      Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for Jehovah shall be thine everlasting light (Isa. 60:20); where the Lord's kingdom is treated of; the "sun shall no more go down" denotes that they shall be in the life of good and in wisdom, because in the Lord's celestial love and light; "the moon shall not withdraw itself" denotes that they shall be in the life of truth, and in intelligence, because in the Lord's spiritual love and light. (That in the other life the Lord is a sun to the celestial angels, and a moon to the spiritual angels, and that hence they have wisdom and intelligence, see above, n. 1053, 1521, 1529-1531, 2441, 2495, 3636, 3643.) From this it is evident what is meant in the internal sense of the Word by the rising" and "setting" of the sun. [4] In David:      O Jehovah my God Thou art very great Thou hast put on glory and honor; who covereth Himself with light as with a garment; He stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain; he made the moon for appointed festivals; He knoweth the going down of the sun. Thou disposest the darkness that it may become night (Ps. 104:1-2, 19-20); here in like manner the "moon" denotes intelligence, and the "sun" wisdom, from the Lord; the "going down of the sun" denotes the obscurity of each; "to dispose the darkness that it may become night," signifies the moderating of a state of obscurity. That the angels have changes of state between the highest degree of light and a less degree, or between the highest degree of wisdom and a less degree, and that these changes of state are as the morning when the sun rises, and as midday when it is in its greatest altitude, and as the evening when it sets, and afterwards as morning again, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be shown elsewhere. [5] In Joshua:      From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border (Josh. 1:4); where there is described the extension of the land of Canaan, by which is signified in the internal sense the Lord's kingdom (see n. 1607, 3038, 3481); (that the "river Euphrates" is one border of it, that is, of things spiritual and celestial, see above, n. 1866; and that the great sea" and the "going down of the sun" is another, by which is represented the ultimate, which is relatively obscure; also that all the borders and all the places in that land are representative, n. 1585). [6] In Moses:      If in taking a pledge thou shalt take for a pledge thy neighbor's garment, thou shalt restore it unto him before the sun goeth down; for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin, wherein he shall sleep (Exod. 22:26-27). And again      If he be a poor man, thou shalt not lie down upon his pledge; thou shalt surely restore to him the pledge before the sun goeth down, and he shall bless thee, and it shall be righteousness unto thee before Jehovah thy God (Deut. 24:12-13). That in this law, as in all the rest, there is what is representative and significative of the Divine law, which is that of good and truth in the Lord's kingdom, from which this law comes, is manifest from its particulars. That it contains as the very ground of the law that a man's companions ought not to be deprived of external truths, which are the doctrinal things according to which they live, and their rituals; and that such truths are the "garment," may be seen above (n. 297, 1073, 2576). "Restoring the pledge before the sun "went down," denotes before truth perishes with him; and because this truth is external, it is said that "the garment is for his skin in which he shall sleep." [7] Again:      The soul that hath touched what is unclean shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things; but when he has bathed his flesh in water, and the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterwards he shall eat of the holy things (Lev. 22:6-7). And again:      He that is not clean, toward evening shall bathe himself in waters; and when the sun is down, he shall enter into the midst of the camp (Deut. 23:10-11). That this law also has its origin in the laws of good and truth, or the laws of order in the Lord's kingdom, is evident; otherwise it would never have been commanded that the unclean person should be unclean until the evening, and should then wash himself with waters, and after the sun was down should be clean. The law of order in the Lord's kingdom from which the above law comes, is that when good and angelic spirits lapse into a state of the love of self, and thereby into a state of falsity, they are then remitted a little into their natural or lower state, and are there imbued with knowledges of good and truth that bear upon the matter in question, which is signified by "washing themselves with waters in the evening." (That "washing with waters" denotes to be purified from falsities, may be seen above, n. 3147, 3148; and that "waters" are the knowledges of truth, n. 28, 680, 739, 2702, 3058.) And after they have been in that obscure state which is signified by the "going down of the sun," they return into their former state, which is signified by their "being clean," and "entering into the midst of the camp," on which subject of the Lord's Divine mercy something shall be said elsewhere from experience. From what has been said it is now evident that when mentioned in the Word the "going down of the sun" with the good signifies an obscure state as to truth; and with the evil a state of falsity. </p>

 <p>And he took of the stones of the place. That this signifies the truths of that state, is evident from the signification of "stones," as being lower truths, such as are those of the natural man (see n. 643, 1298). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3695.">3695.</a></font></span>
 <p>And placed them for his pillows. That this signifies communication of a most general nature with the Divine, is evident from the signification of "pillows" for the head or the neck, as being communication with external things, thus communication of a most general nature; for that the nape or the neck signifies the communication of interior things with exterior things, or what is the same, of higher things with lower, and thereby conjunction, may be seen above (n. 3542, 3603). Hence those things which are under the nape or neck, that is, pillows, here signify the communication of inmost or Divine things with outermost ones, which communication is also of a most general nature; for that which is external is relatively general, and that which is outermost is most general; for the singulars of interior things appear as a one, thus as a general, in exterior things. These moreover are the things that are represented and signified by the "ladder set on the earth, whose top reached to heaven, with the angels of God ascending and descending upon it," concerning which presently. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3696.">3696.</a></font></span>
 <p>And lay down in that place. That this signifies the tranquillity of the state, is evident from the signification of "lying down," as being to be in a state of tranquillity; for "lying down" and "sleeping" signify nothing else. That in the internal sense this is the signification of "lying down," may, also be seen from other passages in the word, concerning which just below. With those who are to be regenerated, who are here treated of in the internal representative sense, the case is that first of all they are in a state of tranquillity, or in a state of external peace (for external peace, or peace in externals, is called "tranquillity"); and the same is produced from the Divine state of peace that is inmostly within it; and it comes forth into the externals through the removal of cupidities and falsities; for these are what cause all unrest. Moreover at the beginning of his life, that is, during his infancy, every man is in a state of tranquillity; but as he advances in life, that is, grows up to manhood, he removes himself from this state, because he gives himself up to worldly cares, and consequently to anxieties caused by the cupidities of the love of self and of the world, and the derivative falsities. [2] The case is almost the same with the new life in the man who is being regenerated: at first he is in a state of tranquillity; but as he passes into a new life, he also passes at the same time into an untranquil state; for the evils and falsities with which be had before become imbued emerge and come forth, and disturb him, and this at last to such a degree that he is in temptations and vexations inflicted by the diabolical crew, who are continually striving to destroy the state of his new life. Yet inmostly the man is in a state of peace, for unless this were with him inmostly, he would not combat, for in his battlings he is continually looking to this state as the end, and unless he had such an end, he would in no wise have power and strength to combat. This moreover is the reason why he overcomes; and because this is the end in view, he also comes into this state after the combats or temptations. This is like the state of spring, which succeeds the state of autumn and winter; or it is like the state of dawn, which succeeds evening and night. (That a state of peace in spiritual things is like spring and dawn in natural things, may be seen above, n. 1726, 2780; and that peace is from good and truth, and unrest from what is evil and false, n. 3170.) [3] That in the Word "to lie down" signifies a state of tranquillity, may be seen from the following passages. In Moses:      If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments and do them, I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; and I will cause the evil wild beast to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword pass through your land (Lev. 26:3, 6); where "lying down" is manifestly predicated of a state of peace and tranquillity; "evil beasts" denote the cupidities of evil (n. 45, 46, 908), which shall "cease;" the "sword" denotes, falsity fighting against truth (n. 2799), which shall not "pass through;" all which shows that peace and the tranquillity of peace are from good and truth, and that the destruction thereof is from evils and falsities. [4] In Isaiah:      The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together (Isa. 11:6-7);      where the Lord is treated of, and the state of peace in His kingdom; that they shall "lie down together" signifies that they cannot be infested by any evil and falsity. In Hosea:      In that day will I make a covenant for them with the wild beast of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of the earth; and I will break the bow and the sword and war out of the land, and will make them to lie down in confidence (Hos. 2:18); where in like manner "to lie down" signifies a state of tranquillity on the removal of falsities and evils, which occasion unrest. [5] In David:      I will lay me down and sleep; and I will awake, for Jehovah sustaineth me. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people that have set themselves against me round about (Ps. 3:5-6); where "to lie down and sleep" signifies a state of tranquillity and security. Again:      In peace I will both lay me down and sleep; for Thou, Jehovah alone, makest me to dwell in confidence (Ps. 4:8). And again:      He will make me to lie down in green pastures; He will lead me to the waters of rest; He will restore my soul (Ps. 23:2-3). From these passages it is evident that a state of peace and tranquillity is signified by "lying down;" and that by "lying down in that place" is signified the tranquillity of the state, for in the internal sense "place" signifies state (n. 3692). </p>

 <p>Verses 12-15. And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set on the earth, and its head reaching to heaven; and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And behold Jehovah standing upon it; and He said, I am Jehovah the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt break forth to the sea, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south; and in thee shall all the families of the ground be blessed, and in thy seed; and behold I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee back to this ground; for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee. "And he dreamed," signifies foresight; "and behold a ladder set on the earth," signifies the communication of the lowest truth and its derivative good; "and its head reaching to heaven," signifies with the Divine; "and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it," signifies infinite and eternal communication, and the consequent conjunction; and that from what is lowest there is as it were an ascent, and afterwards when the order is inverted, a descent; "and behold Jehovah standing upon it," signifies the Lord in the highest; "and He said, I am Jehovah the God of Abraham thy father," signifies the Lord, that from Him that good comes; "and the God of Isaac," signifies the Lord as to the Divine Human; "the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it," signifies the good in which He was, that it was from what was His own; "and to thy seed," signifies that so also was the truth; "and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth," signifies that Divine truth natural would be as natural good; "and thou shalt break forth to the sea, and to the east," signifies the infinite extension of good; "and to the north, and to the south," signifies the infinite extension of truth; thus all states of good and truth; "and in thee shall all the families of the ground be blessed," signifies that all truths of the good of doctrine will be conjoined with good; "and in thy seed," signifies and with truth; "and behold I am with thee," signifies the Divine "and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest," signifies the Divine Providence; "and will bring thee back to this ground," signifies conjunction with Divine doctrine; "for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee," signifies that nothing would be wanting to prevent its having effect. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3698.">3698.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he dreamed. That this signifies foresight, is evident from the signification of "dreaming," as being in the internal sense to foretell future things; for prophetic dreams, which were Divine, were predictions of things to come, as is evident from those related in the Word (see n. 1975, 1976). Such being, in the internal sense, the signification of "dreams" and of "to dream," therefore in the supreme sense, in which the Lord is treated of, they signify foresight; for predictions are from the Lord's Divine foresight. That this is the only source of predictions concerning events which do not flow according to the common order of nature, and cannot thence be foreseen, may be seen from the Word, as from these words in Moses:      When a prophet speaketh in the name of Jehovah, but the word doth not come to pass, and that word doth not happen, Jehovah hath not spoken; the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously (Deut. 18:22); and this although predictions of things which come to pass might be from the wicked and worshipers of another god, as is evident from this passage:      If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams; for Jehovah your God trieth you (Deut. 13:1-3); from which it is evident that the prediction itself was from the Divine, but the persuasion to worship other gods was from what belonged to the prophet, to whom this was permitted for the sake of trying them, as is said. From this also it is, and from other causes, that very often in olden time they who worshiped the Baals and other gods also prophesied, saw visions, and dreamed dreams, and likewise that the things which were spoken by them came to pass, whereby many were seduced; concerning whom we read in Jeremiah 23; besides others who were called "diviners," "soothsayers," "jugglers," and "pythons," who were among those who studied natural magic, whereby nothing of what was Divine could be foretold, but only what was contrary to the Divine, that is, contrary to the Lord, and contrary to the good of love and the truth of faith in Him. This is magic, of whatsoever quality it may appear in external form. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3699.">3699.</a></font></span>
 <p>And behold a ladder set on the earth. That this signifies the communication of the lowest truth and its derivative good, is evident from the signification of a "ladder," as being communication, concerning which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of the "earth," as being what is lowest, for it is said immediately afterwards that "its head reached unto heaven," which denotes that which is highest; all which shows that the "ladder set between earth and heaven," or between the lowest and the highest, signifies communication; that it is the communication of the lowest truth and its derivative good that is here signified by the "ladder set on the earth," is evident from the fact that the subject here is truth and its derivative good of that degree which in the internal sense is here represented by Jacob. In the original tongue the term "ladder" is derived from an expression which signifies a "path" or "way," and that "path" or "way" is predicated of truth, may be seen above (n. 627, 2333). Moreover, when angels are conversing about truth, this is exhibited representatively in the world of spirits by "ways" (n. 189, 3477); all of which shows what is signified by a "ladder, one extremity of which is set on the earth, while the other reaches to heaven," namely, the communication of truth which is in the lowest place with truth which is in the highest, which communication is treated of in what follows. (That there are lowest truths and goods, and also highest truths and goods, and steps between them as of a ladder, may be seen above, n. 3691.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3700.">3700.</a></font></span>
 <p>And its head reaching to heaven. That this signifies with the Divine, namely, that there was communication therewith, is evident from the signification of the "head," or summit of the ladder, as being that which is highest; and from the signification of "heaven," as being that which is Divine; for in the supreme sense, in which the Lord is treated of, "heaven" signifies the Divine Itself; but in the representative sense, which treats of the man who is being regenerated, it signifies the inmost good and its derivative truth that is from the Lord, such as there is in heaven, and from which is heaven itself. This is also called "Divine," because from the Lord; for the Lord, or what is the same, the Divine, which is from the Lord alone, is the all in all of heaven; and whatever is not from the Divine there, is not of heaven. For this reason it has been occasionally said above that the Lord is heaven itself, and that all who are in heaven are in the Lord. </p>
