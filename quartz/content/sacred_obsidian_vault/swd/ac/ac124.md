 <p>Wherefore they sold not their ground. That this signifies that for this reason they had no need to renounce and submit them, is evident from the signification of "selling," as being to renounce (of which above, n. 6143), thus to submit, for that which is renounced is submitted to another; and from the signification of the "ground," that is, of the priests of Egypt, as being the capacity to receive good in the natural (of which also above, n. 6148). That for this reason they had no need, namely, to renounce and submit them, is signified by the expression, "Wherefore not." </p>

 <p>And Joseph said unto the people. That this signifies the influx of the internal into the truths of memory-knowledge, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being perception (see n. 6063); and because it is predicated of the internal, which is "Joseph," it denotes influx, for that which is perceived in the external flows in from the internal; and from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal (as may be seen frequently above); and from the signification of the "people," as being the truths of memory-knowledge (n. 6146). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6153.">6153.</a></font></span>
 <p>Behold I have bought you the day and your ground for Pharaoh. That this signifies that it procured these for itself, and made them subject to what is general in the natural that was under the auspices of the internal, is evident from the signification of "buying," as being to appropriate and procure (n. 4397, 5374, 5397, 5406, 5410, 5426); and from the signification of "ground," as being receptacles of truth (n. 6135-6137). That it subjected them to what is general in the natural is signified by his "buying them for Pharaoh," by whom is represented the natural in general (n. 5160, 5799, 6015). It is said "under the auspices of the internal" in accordance with what was unfolded above (n. 6145). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6154.">6154.</a></font></span>
 <p>Lo here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the ground. That this signifies the good of charity and the truth of faith that were to be implanted, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being truth from good, or as being faith from charity, thus both (see n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 1940, 2848, 3038, 3310, 3373, 3671); from the signification of "sowing," as being to implant; and from the signification of the "ground," as being receptacles (n. 6135-6137). But when truth and good have been implanted, the "ground" no longer signifies a receptacle, but, like a "field," that which is of the church (n. 566). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6155.">6155.</a></font></span>
 <p>And it shall be in the ingatherings. That this signifies the fruits thence derived, is evident from the signification of the "ingatherings," as being the fruits; for the harvest, which is gathered in from the field, is the fruit of it. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6156.">6156.</a></font></span>
 <p>That ye shall give a fifth to Pharaoh. That this signifies remains, that these are for the general in the natural which is under the auspices of the internal, is evident from the signification of "five" and of a "fifth part," as being remains (see n. 5291, 5894); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being what is general in the natural (see above, n. 6153). It is said "under the auspices of the internal" for the reason spoken of above (n. 6145). What remains are may be seen above (n. 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284, 5135, 5897, 5898), namely, that they are goods and truths from the Lord stored up in the interior man. These are let down into the exterior or natural man when he is in a state of good; but the moment he comes into a state of evil they are drawn back and stored up again. The reason of their being drawn back and stored up again, is to prevent their being mingled with evils, and thus perishing. When a man cannot be regenerated, the remains in him are carefully preserved in his interiors. But when a man is being regenerated, then, Insofar as this is the case, the remains are let down from the interiors into the exteriors, for the reason that by regeneration the interiors are conjoined with the exteriors and act as a one. Remains are then first let down to generals, and afterward successively to particulars. As the subject here treated of in the internal sense is the regeneration of the natural, it may be known from what has been said what is meant by remains being for what is general in the natural. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6157.">6157.</a></font></span>
 <p>And four parts shall be for you. That this signifies those things which were not yet remains, is evident from the signification of "four parts," when said of the residue when a fifth part, by which are signified remains, has been taken away (see n. 6156), as being the things which are not yet remains. By "four" is signified the like as by "two," namely, things which are pairs and which are conjoined together (n. 1686), as are good and truth. When these have not as yet become remains, they are here signified by "four parts." For goods and truths do not become remains until they are being appropriated to man, and they are for the first time being appropriated to man when they are received from affection in freedom. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6158.">6158.</a></font></span>
 <p>For seed of the field. That this signifies for the nourishment of the mind, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being truth and good, thus as being faith and charity (of which above, n. 6154); and from the signification of "field," as being in a general sense the church (see n. 2971, 3766), and in a particular sense the church in a man, thus a man in whom the church is, that is, who receives truth and good. When he is called a "field," it is his mind that is meant; for man is not man from his external form, but from his mind, that is, from his understanding and will which constitute his mind, and also from the truth of faith and the good of charity which constitute the still more inward mind. This, namely, the mind, when it is in the genuine sense a man, is nourished and sustained by truth and good; and as truth and good are signified by "seed," nourishment also is signified by it, which indeed is plain from the words that directly follow: "for your food, and for them in your houses, and for food for your babes." Hence then it is that the "seed of the field" denotes the nourishment of the mind. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6159.">6159.</a></font></span>
 <p>And for your food, and for them in your houses. That this signifies that thereby the good of truth may be in each and all things, is evident from the signification of "food," as being the good of truth (see n. 5410, 5426, 5487, 5582, 5588, 5655); and from the signification of "those who are in the houses," as being each and all things of good derived from truth. Thus "for food for those in the houses" denotes the good of truth in each and all things. As regards the good of truth being in each and all things, the case is this. In proportion as a man is being regenerated, good insinuates itself into each and all things that appertain to him; for the affection of good becomes that which reigns universally in him; and that which reigns universally reigns also singularly, that is, in each and all things. This may be seen from the ruling affection with everyone. This affection, whatever it may be, is present in each particular of his will, and also in each particular of his thought, and although it does not always appear to be present in the thought, nevertheless it is in it. The reason why it does not appear is that at these moments it is clothed with affections that are insinuated by means of objects; but as these affections are put off, the ruling affection comes into plain view. [2] This cannot be better seen than from the case of spirits and angels. Spirits who are evil, or with whom evil is dominant, are evil in each and all things, even when they are speaking what is true and are doing what is good, for in all this they have no other intention than to deceive others so as to be believed to be good, and thus to beguile under a semblance of good. When this is the case, it is plainly heard from the very tone of their speech, and is also perceived from their sphere. The angels in heaven, with whom good rules, that is, universally reigns, are good in each and all things; or in other words, with them good from the Lord shines forth in each and all things; for even if they do anything of evil in the outward form, it is nevertheless their end or intention that good may come therefrom. From all this it is evident that where good universally reigns, it reigns in each and all things; and it is the same with evil. For that which reigns universally comes into existence for the first time when each and all things are of the same nature; and the universal is according to the quality and quantity of these; for that which is called universal is universal from the fact that it is in all things individually. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6160.">6160.</a></font></span>
 <p>And for food for your babes. That this signifies in those things which are of innocence, is evident from the signification of "food," as being the good of truth (as just above, n. 6159); and from the signification of "babes," as being innocence (n. 430, 3183, 5608). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6161.">6161.</a></font></span>
 <p>And they said, Thou hast made us live. That this signifies spiritual life in no other manner and from no other source, is evident from the signification of "making live," as being spiritual life (see n. 5890). As in what precedes the subject treated of has been the vivification or regeneration of the natural, the whole process of which is there described, which is of such a nature and no other, it is therefore added that it is in no other manner and from no other source. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6162.">6162.</a></font></span>
 <p>Let us find grace in the eyes of my lord. That this signifies the will that in this way they be made subject, and humiliation, is evident from the fact that these words, uttered after all things appertaining to them have been renounced, are words of acknowledgment, thus also of the will that in this way they be subjected; thus that they are words of humiliation. That this sense is within these words is evident from the state in which the people then were, which state is also manifest from the series of what goes before and of what follows. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6163.">6163.</a></font></span>
 <p>And we will be Pharaoh's servants. That this signifies that they renounce their own, and submit to the natural which is under the auspices of the internal, is evident from the signification of "servants," as being to be devoid of freedom from their own (see n. 5760, 5763), thus to renounce their own; and from the signification of "being Pharaoh's," as being submitted to the natural which is under the auspices of the internal (n. 6145). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6164.">6164.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Joseph made it a statute. That this signifies what is concluded from consent, is evident from the signification of "making a statute," as being to conclude from consent; for that which is made a statute is done with consent on both sides, and is accounted among things ordained by agreement, thus duly. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6165.">6165.</a></font></span>
 <p>Even unto this day. That this signifies eternally, is evident from the signification of "even unto this day," as being eternally (see n. 2838, 4304). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6166.">6166.</a></font></span>
 <p>Concerning the ground of Egypt, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. This signifies remains, as before (n. 6156). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6167.">6167.</a></font></span>
 <p>Only the ground of the priests, only theirs, was not Pharaoh's. This signifies capacities to receive good, which are immediately from the internal (as also above, n. 6148). What has now been said about the conjunction of the natural with the internal, and thus about its regeneration by means of repeated desolations and vivifications, must needs seem to the man of the church at this day as things unheard of. Nevertheless the case is really so, and is one of those things with which even simple spirits in the other life are well acquainted. Wherefore when the Word is being read by a man, they who are in the other life, being in the internal sense of the Word, not only perceive all these things, but see besides innumerable arcana therein, and such as cannot be expressed by any human speech. Those which have been adduced are comparatively only few. </p>

 <p>Verses 27-31. And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they had a possession therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly. And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were seven years, and a hundred and forty years. And the days of Israel drew near to die; and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If I pray I have found grace in thine eyes, put I pray thy hand under my thigh, and do mercy and truth with me; bury me not I pray in Egypt; and I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their sepulcher. And he said, I will do according to thy word. And he said, Swear to me; and he sware to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head. "And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt," signifies that spiritual good lived among the memory-knowledges which are of the church; "in the land of Goshen," signifies in the midst of them; "and they had a possession therein," signifies given and set in order in this way by the internal; "and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly," signifies the derivative goods of charity and truths of faith; "and Jacob lived in the land of Egypt," signifies that the truth of the natural was in memory-knowledges; "seventeen years," signifies the state therein; "and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were seven years, and a hundred and forty years," signifies the general state and its quality; "and the days of Israel drew near to die," signifies the state immediately before regeneration; "and he called his son Joseph," signifies the presence of the internal; "and said to him, If I pray I have found grace in thine eyes," signifies longing; "put I pray thy hand under my thigh," signifies a sacred binding; "and do mercy and truth with me," signifies humiliation; "bury me not I pray in Egypt," signifies regeneration not in memory-knowledges; "and I will lie with my fathers," signifies life such as the ancients had; "and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt," signifies that there may be elevation out of memory-knowledges; "and bury me in their sepulcher," signifies such regeneration; "and he said, I will do according to thy word," signifies that so it shall be done of providence by the Divine; "and he said, Swear to me," signifies that it may be irrevocable; "and he sware to him," signifies that it was irrevocable; "and Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head," signifies that he turned to those things which are of the interior natural. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6169.">6169.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt. That this signifies that spiritual good lived among the memory-knowledges which are of the church, is evident from the signification of "dwelling," as being to live (see n. 1293, 3384, 3613, 4451); from the representation of Israel, as being spiritual good (see n. 5801, 5803, 5807, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833); and from the signification of the "land of Egypt," as being the natural mind where memory-knowledges are (n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301); (that "Egypt" signifies the memory-knowledges of the church may be seen above, n. 4749, 4964, 4966, 6004). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6170.">6170.</a></font></span>
 <p>In the land of Goshen. That this signifies in the midst of them, is evident from the signification of the "land of Goshen," as being the midst or inmost in the natural (see n. 5910, 6028, 6031, 6068), thus in the midst of memory-knowledges, because Goshen was the best tract of land in Egypt. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6171.">6171.</a></font></span>
 <p>And they had a possession therein. That this signifies given and set in order in this way by the internal, is evident from the signification of a "possession," as being the residence of spiritual life (see n. 6103); and as Joseph gave them this possession (verse 11), it is signified that this residence was given and set in order by the internal. That this is signified, follows from the series. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6172.">6172.</a></font></span>
 <p>And were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly. That this signifies the derivative goods of charity and truths of faith, is evident from the signification of "being fruitful," as being to bring forth the goods of charity; and from the signification of "multiplying," as being to bring forth the truths of faith (see n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847); for the expression "to be fruitful" comes from "fruits," which in the internal sense signify the works of charity; and "to be multiplied," from "multitude," which in the internal sense is predicated of the truths of faith; for in the Word "many" is said of truths, and "great" of goods. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6173.">6173.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt. That this signifies that the truth of the natural was in memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "living," as being spiritual life (see n. 5890); from the representation of Jacob, as being the truth of the natural (n. 3305, 3509, 3525, 3546, 3599, 3775, 4009, 4234, 4520, 4538); and from the signification of the "land of Egypt," as being the memory-knowledges of the church (as just above, n. 6169). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6174.">6174.</a></font></span>
 <p>Seventeen years. That this signifies the state therein, is evident from the signification of "seventeen," as being from beginning to end, or from the beginning to what is new (n. 755, 4670); and from the signification of "years," as being states (n. 487, 488, 493, 893). Thus here by the "seventeen years which Jacob lived in Egypt" is signified the beginning of a state of spiritual life in the natural among memory-knowledges even to its end. (That all numbers in the Word are significative of things, see n. 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 1963, 1988, 2075, 2252, 3252, 4264, 4495, 4670, 5265.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6175.">6175.</a></font></span>
 <p>So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were seven years and a hundred and forty years. That this signifies the general state and its quality, may be seen if the numbers "seven," "forty," and a "hundred" are unfolded. What "seven" signifies may be seen above (n. 395, 433, 716, 728, 881, 5265, 5268); what "forty" signifies (n. 730, 862, 2272, 2273); and what a "hundred" (n. 1988, 2636, 4400). But the numbers thus compounded cannot be easily unfolded, for they contain more things than can be reduced to a summary statement, and be expressed to the apprehension. These numbers in general contain the whole state of that which is represented by Jacob, and its quality. These things the angels see in one complex from the very number a hundred and forty-seven; for all numbers in the Word fall with them into ideas of things, as has been made plain to me from the fact that sometimes numbers in a long succession have appeared to me, and the angels then said that those numbers enfolded within them in succession likewise the things of which they were conversing. From this also the most ancient people, who were of the celestial church, made a computation consisting of numbers, by which were conveyed heavenly things not easily comprehensible to the ideas of the natural mind. But after their times these computations perished, together with the perception of heavenly things, and there remained only the knowledge of the general signification of the simple numbers, as "three," "six," "seven," "twelve;" and not so much of the signification of compound numbers. But at this day it is not known that the numbers in the Word signify anything except number, and therefore what has been said on the subject will perhaps be thought incredible. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6176.">6176.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the days of Israel drew near to die. That this signifies the state immediately before regeneration, is evident from the signification of "drawing near," as being to be nigh, thus immediately previous; from the signification of "days," as being states (see n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850); from the representation of Israel, as being spiritual good (of which above, n. 6169); and from the signification of "dying," as being to rise again and be awakened into spiritual life (n. 3326, 3498, 3505, 4618, 4621, 6036), thus to be regenerated; for he who is being regenerated rises again from spiritual death, and is awakened into new life. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6177.">6177.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he called his son Joseph. That this signifies the presence of the internal, is evident from the signification of "calling unto himself," as being to make present with himself, thus as being presence; and from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal (as frequently shown above, n. 6089, 6117, 6120, 6128, 6132, 6136, 6145, 6149, 6152, 6153, 6156, 6163, 6167). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6178.">6178.</a></font></span>
 <p>And said to him, If I pray I have found grace in thine eyes. That this signifies longing, is evident from the affection in which Jacob was when he spoke these words to Joseph. This affection is within this form of speech; for the words "If I pray I have found grace in thine eyes" are merely a form of speech by which is expressed the affection, thus the longing of the will (as also above, n. 6162). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6179.">6179.</a></font></span>
 <p>Put I pray thy hand under my thigh. That this signifies a sacred binding, is evident from the signification of "putting the hand under the thigh," as being a binding, with all power, by means of that which belongs to conjugial love; for by the "hand" is signified power (see n. 878, 3091, 4931-4937, 5328, 5544), and by the "thigh" that which is of conjugial love (n. 3021, 4277, 4280, 4575, 5050-5062). In the supreme sense the conjugial is the union of the Divine and the Divine Human In the Lord; and from this it is the union of the Divine good and the Divine truth in heaven; for that which proceeds from the Lord is the Divine truth from the Divine good. From this, heaven is heaven, and is called a "marriage," for it is the conjunction of the good and the truth there, which proceed from the Lord, that makes it. And as the Lord is the good there, and heaven is the truth thence derived, therefore in the Word the Lord is called the "bridegroom," and heaven and also the church are called the "bride;" for good and truth make a marriage, and their conjunction is what is meant by the conjugial. Hence it is plain how sacred a thing it was to be bound by means of what is conjugial, which was signified by "putting the hand under the thigh." From this marriage of good and truth descends genuine conjugial love, In regard to which and its sanctity see what was said above (n. 2727-2759). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6180.">6180.</a></font></span>
 <p>And do mercy and truth with me. That this signifies humiliation, is evident from the signification of "doing mercy," as being the good of love; and from the signification of "doing truth," as being the truth of faith (of which significations in what follows). These words are uttered as words of supplication, thus of humiliation. That "doing mercy" denotes the good of love is because all mercy is of love; for he who is in love or charity is also in mercy, and the love and charity in him become mercy when the neighbor is In need or misery, and he affords him help in that state. Hence it is that by "mercy" is signified the good of love. That "doing truth" denotes the truth of faith is because all truth is of faith, and for this reason in the original tongue faith is meant by the same expression. [2] Because the good of love and the truth of faith are in the closest conjunction, and the one is not possible without the other, therefore this form of speaking was usual among the ancients, because they knew that the good of love is inseparable from the truth of faith, and for this reason also these two are often spoken of conjointly in the Word, as in Exodus:      Jehovah great in mercy and truth (Exod. 34:6). In the second book of Samuel:      David said unto the men of Jabesh, Jehovah do mercy and truth with you (2 Sam. 2:5, 6). In the same:      David said unto Ittai the Gittite, Return thou, and take back thy brethren with thee, with mercy and truth (2 Sam. 15:20). In Hosea:      Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, and no mercy, and no knowledge of God in the land (Hos. 4:1). In David:      All the ways of Jehovah are mercy and truth to them that keep His covenant (Ps. 25:10). Again:      Thou wilt not withhold Thy mercies from me, O Jehovah; Thy mercy and Thy truth will perpetually guard me (Ps. 40:11). Again:      I will sing the eternal mercies of Jehovah; with my mouth will I make known Thy truth to generation and generation. For I have said, Eternally shall mercy be builded; in the very heavens Thou wilt confirm Thy truth. Righteousness and judgment are the support of Thy throne; mercy and truth stand before Thy faces (Ps. 89:1, 2, 14); and in other passages in David (Ps. 26:3; 36:5; 57:3, 10; 61:7; 85:10; 86:15; 89:24, 33; 92:2). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6181.">6181.</a></font></span>
 <p>Bury me not I pray in Egypt. That this signifies regeneration not in memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "burying," as being resurrection and regeneration (see n. 2916, 2917, 4621, 5551); and from the signification of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledges (of which frequently above). What is meant by regeneration not in memory-knowledges, may be seen in what presently follows (n. 6183). </p>

 <p>And I will lie with my fathers. That this signifies life such as the ancients had, is evident from the signification of "lying," as being life; for "to lie" here means to be buried with them, and as "being buried" denotes resurrection and regeneration, "lying with them" denotes life, because resurrection is into life, and in like manner regeneration; and from the signification of "fathers," as being those who were of the Ancient and Most Ancient Churches (see n. 6075), thus the ancients. </p>

 <p>And thou shalt carry me out of Egypt. That this signifies that there may be elevation out of memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "carrying me," as being elevation; for "going up" is said of passing from Egypt to the land of Canaan, whereby is signified elevation (see n. 3084, 4539, 4969, 5406, 5817, 6007), and the same by "carrying there out of Egypt;" and from the signification of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledges (of which above). What elevation from memory-knowledges is, shall be briefly stated. The regeneration of the natural is effected by means of the insinuation by the Lord of spiritual life through the internal man into the memory-knowledges in the natural. This insinuation has been treated of in this chapter. But if when the man has been regenerated thus far, he is of such a character that he can be further regenerated, he is elevated thence to the interior natural, which is under the immediate auspices of the internal; whereas if the man is not of such a character, in this case his spiritual life is in the exterior natural. The elevation is effected by a withdrawing from things of sense and memory-knowledge, thus by elevation above them, and then the man comes into a state of interior thought and affection, thus interiorly into heaven. They who are in this latter state are in the internal church; but they who are in the former state are in the external church, and are represented by Jacob, whereas they who are in the latter state are represented by Israel. To the end therefore that "Jacob" may be "Israel," and thus by him as "Israel" may be represented the spiritual good which is in the interior natural, thus the internal spiritual church, these words were said by Jacob. </p>

 <p>And bury me in their sepulcher. That this signifies such regeneration, is evident from the signification of "burying," as being regeneration (of which above, n. 6181). Thus "to be buried in their sepulcher," that is, in the same one, denotes such regeneration. </p>

 <p>And he said, I will do according to thy word. That this signifies that so it shall be done of providence by the Divine, is evident from the signification of "doing according to the word" of anyone, as being that so it shall be done. It is added "of providence by the Divine" because Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob represented three things which make a one. In the supreme sense, Abraham represented in the Lord the Divine Itself, Isaac the Divine rational, and Jacob the Divine natural (see n. 3305, 4615, 6098); and in the sense that regards man, these three patriarchs represented the inmost which is celestial good, the interior which is spiritual good, and the exterior which is natural good. These are signified by those three in one sepulcher, because by a "sepulcher" is signified resurrection into life and regeneration (n. 2916, 2917, 4621, 5551). </p>

 <p>And he said, Swear to me. That this signifies that it may be irrevocable, is evident from the signification of "swearing," as being irrevocable confirmation (see n. 2842). </p>

 <p>And he sware to him. That this signifies that it was irrevocable, is evident from the signification of "swearing," as being what is irrevocable (as just above, n. 6186). </p>

 <p>And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head. That this signifies that he turned to those things which are of the interior natural, is evident from the signification of "bowing oneself," as here being to turn himself; and from the signification of "bed," as being the natural (of which in what follows). Thus the "head of the bed" is what is higher in the natural, that is, what is interior; for by "head" when mentioned in the Word is signified what is interior, and this in respect to the body, which is exterior. By his turning himself to those things which are of the interior natural, is signified that natural truth, which is "Jacob," was being elevated to spiritual good, which is "Israel," according to what was said and unfolded above (n. 6183). [2] That a "bed" denotes what is natural, is because the natural is beneath the rational, and serves it as a bed; for the rational as it were lies down upon the natural; and because the natural is thus spread out underneath, it is called a "bed," as also in Amos:      As the shepherd hath rescued out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the sons of Israel be rescued that dwell in Samaria, In the corner of a bed, and on the end of a couch (Amos 3:12); "in the corner of a bed" denotes in the lowest of the natural; and "on the end of a couch" denotes in what is sensuous. For by the "people Israel," whose metropolis was Samaria, was represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom. Of this it is said, as of the father Israel here, that it is "upon the head of the bed," for spiritual good, which is represented by the father Israel, is the "head of the bed." But when they turn themselves thence to those things which are of the lowest natural and which are of the sensuous, it is then said that they are "in the corner of the bed," and "on the end of the couch." [3] Again in the same prophet:      They that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches; but they are not grieved for the breach of Joseph (Amos 6:4, 6); "beds of ivory" denote the pleasures of the lowest natural, which are those of the proud; "not to be grieved for the breach of Joseph," is to have no concern about the dissipation of good from the internal. So in David:      If I come into the tent of my house, If I go up upon the couch of my bed (Ps. 132:3); the "tent of my house" denotes the holy of love (n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152, 3312, 4128, 4391, 4599); "to go up upon the couch of the bed" denotes upon the natural, to the truth which is from the good of love. Everyone can see that "coming into the tent of the house," and "going up upon the couch of the bed," is a prophetic saying, which cannot be understood without the internal sense. </p>

 <p>Continuation about influx and the interaction of the soul and the body.           That two angels from heaven and two spirits from hell are with man, and that thereby he has communication with both heaven and hell, and also has freedom thereby to turn to the one or to the other, has been shown at the end of chapters 44 and 45. But that each and all things with man flow in according to his freedom-evil from hell, and good from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord-is what man does not know, and therefore will perhaps scarcely believe. </p>

 <p>As the subject here treated of is Influx, and this is mentioned so frequently, it is necessary to say in advance what influx is. What is meant by spiritual influx cannot be better seen than by means of the natural influxes which take place and appear in this world-as by the influx of heat from the sun into all things of the earth, with all variety in accordance with the seasons of the year and the climates of the earth; and by the influx of light into the same, with all variety likewise in accordance with the times of the days and also of the years, also in a varied manner according to the climates. From the influx of heat from the sun into all things of the earth, whence comes vegetative life; and from the influx of light into the same, whence comes support to that life, and also colors and displays of beauties; in like manner from the influx of the same heat into the surface of our bodies, and also of light into the eye; likewise from the influx of sound into the ear; and from other instances of a similar kind, it may be comprehended what is the influx of life from the Lord, who is the Sun of heaven, from whom comes heavenly heat, which is the good of love, and heavenly light, which is the truth of faith. The influx of these is also plainly felt, for heavenly heat which is love produces the vital heat which is in man, and heavenly light which is faith produces his understanding, because the truth of faith which proceeds from the Lord enlightens his intellectual; but in both cases with much variety, for it is according to the reception on the part of man. </p>

 <p>That man is governed by the Lord by means of angels and spirits, has been given me to know by experience so manifest as not to leave even the smallest doubt concerning it; for now through a course of many years all my thoughts and all my affections, even to the most minute of all, have flowed in by means of spirits and angels. This it has been given me to perceive so plainly that nothing could be more plain; for I have perceived, I have seen, and I have heard, who they were, what was their quality, and where they were. And when anything adverse fell into my thought or will, I have spoken with them and chided them. And I have also observed that the power they had of infusing such things was restrained by the angels; and also in what manner; and likewise often that they were driven away, and that then new spirits were present in their place, from whom again there was influx. It has also been given me to perceive whence those spirits came, or of what societies they were the subjects; and an opportunity of speaking with those societies themselves has likewise frequently been granted. And notwithstanding that everything, even to the most minute, of the thoughts and affections, flowed in through the spirits and angels, still I thought as before, and willed as before, and conversed with men as before, no difference from my former life being observed by anyone. I am aware that scarcely anyone will believe that such is the fact, but still it is an eternal verity. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6192.">6192.</a></font></span>
 <p>It has been shown me to the life in what manner spirits flow in with man. When they come to him, they put on all things of his memory, thus all things which the man has learned and imbibed from infancy, and the spirits suppose these things to be their own. Thus they act as it were the part of the man in the man. But they are not allowed to enter further with a man than to his interiors which are of the thought and will, and not to the exteriors which are of the actions and speech; for these latter come into act by means of a general influx from the Lord without the mediation of particular spirits and angels. But although the spirits act the part of the man with a man in respect to those things which are of his thought and will, they nevertheless do not know that they are with a man, for the reason that they possess all things of his memory, and believe that these are not another's, but their own; and this for the reason also that they may not injure the man. For unless the spirits from hell who are with a man believed these things to be their own, they would attempt in every way to destroy the man both body and soul, because this is the infernal delight itself. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6193.">6193.</a></font></span>
 <p>As in this way spirits possess all things of a man's thought and will, and angels things which are still more interior, and as the man is thus most closely conjoined with them, therefore the man must necessarily perceive and feel that it is he himself who thinks and wills; for the communications in the other life are of such a nature that in a society containing similar spirits each one believes that to be his own which is another's. And therefore when the good come into heavenly society, they at once enter into all the intelligence and wisdom of that society, insomuch that they know no otherwise than that these are in themselves. And such also is the case with a man, and with a spirit who is attendant upon him. The things which flow in from the spirits who are from hell are evils and falsities, but those which flow in from the angels who are from heaven are goods and truths. Thus by means of influxes opposite to each other the man is kept in the midst, thus in freedom. As the things which flow in from the angels, flow in through the more inward interiors, they are not so apparent to the outward sense as are those which flow in from evil spirits. Moreover the angels are of such a character that they never desire to hear that the influxes of good and truth are from themselves, but that they are from the Lord, and they are indignant if it is thought otherwise; for they are in the manifest perception that it is so, and they love nothing more than to will and think not from themselves, but from the Lord. On the other hand, evil spirits are angry if told that they do not think and will from themselves, because this is contrary to the delight of their loves; and they are more angry when told that life is not in them, but that it flows in. When this is shown them by experience to the life, which has often been done, they then indeed confess that it is so, for they cannot speak contrary to experience; but still after some delay they deny it, and then they are not willing that it should be any further confirmed by experience. </p>

 <p>It has sometimes happened that I have meditated by myself, and have also talked with others, without reflecting that spirits were present who excited these activities. But directly afterward the spirits accosted me, and told me the state in which they had then been, namely, that they knew no otherwise than that they were the ones who were thinking, and this in my case in such a manner that the nearest believed themselves to be absolutely those who were thinking, but the more remote less so, and they who were still more remote, still less so. And it was also shown what societies flowed into the spirits as into their subjects. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6195.">6195.</a></font></span>
 <p>There were spirits with me a long time, neither very good nor very evil, a little above the head. They had the power to inflow deeply into the affections, and because they so willed, after a while they entered, and then bound themselves with me in such a manner that it seemed as if they could scarcely be separated. I spoke with them in regard to this, saying that they ought to separate themselves; but they could not. When they attempted it, and separated themselves a little, they then so dulled my thoughts that I could not think except confusedly and disconnectedly, and a painful sensation was felt in my head, like that with those who fall into a swoon. By this it was made evident in what manner loves conjoin, and that thereby is the conjunction of all in the other life. Wherefore spirits who enter into the very affections possess the other, as is also the case In the world when a man favors another's love; whereas truths do not conjoin, but the affections of truth. From this it was made evident to me how man is conjoined either with heaven or with hell, namely, by means of his loves; with hell by means of the loves of self and of the world, but with heaven by means of the loves of the neighbor and of God. It was also evident that a man bound to hell can in no wise be loosed therefrom except through Divine means by the Lord; as was also shown from those who were bound with me only by slight affections, and yet I was not loosed from them except by means of intermediate loves, whereby they were gradually conjoined with others. And as they were separated they appeared to be removed to a distance from me toward the left in front, and the separation was observed by means of changes of state of the affections; for as the affections were changed, so they receded. From this it is also evident whence come the appearances of distance in the other life. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6196.">6196.</a></font></span>
 <p>That spirits are associated with a man in accordance with his loves, has been made known to me by manifold experience, for as soon as I have begun to intensely love anything, spirits were present who were In such love, and they were not removed until the love ceased. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6197.">6197.</a></font></span>
 <p>As often as anything has fallen into my thought and the desires of my will, the source of which I have not known, so often when I have desired to know the source, I have been shown from what societies it came, and sometimes through what spirits as subjects. They have also then spoken with me, and confessed that they were thinking that thing, and likewise that they knew that it flowed in with me and appeared to me as in myself. The deceitful, who appear directly above the head, have occasionally flowed in with me with such subtlety that I knew not whence the influx was, and also that I scarcely perceived any otherwise than that what flowed in was in myself and from myself, as is usual with others. But as I knew of a certainty that it was from another source, perception was given me by the Lord so exquisite that I perceived each single influx from them, also where they were and who they were. When they observed this, they were very indignant, especially because I reflected upon what came from them. This reflection flowed in through angels. Those deceitful ones chiefly insinuated such things as were contrary to the Lord; and then it was given me to reflect upon the fact that no one in hell acknowledges the Lord; but that insofar as they may, they are full of abuse of Him; yet they are not unwilling to hear mention made of the Father, the Creator of the universe. From this very plain indication it is evident that it is the Lord who rules the universal heaven, as He Himself teaches in Matthew: "All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth" (Matt. 28:18); and that they are opposed to the Lord because they are opposed to heaven, where the Lord is all in all. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6198.">6198.</a></font></span>
 <p>There were spirits with me who supposed that it was they themselves who live, and that I had life from no other source than they, thus that they were I. But when they were told that they were separate spirits, and that I also was a spirit as to my interiors: this they could not believe. That they might know it, they were separated, and in this way it was shown that they were spirits by themselves. But still they were unwilling to believe, and were obstinately insistent. They went away for a time, and when they returned they were in the same persuasion. From this also it is evident that spirits know no otherwise than that the things appertaining to man are their own. But such as obstinately believe so are not readily admitted to men, because they cannot be separated without difficulty. A like persuasion is indeed impressed on all other spirits, to the intent that they may be of service to man, but with a difference. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6199.">6199.</a></font></span>
 <p>Another spirit also supposed himself to be me, insomuch that when he talked with me In my native language he believed that he was speaking from his own, saying that the language was his. But it was shown that the language that belongs to spirits is entirely different, and that it is the universal language of all, and that from it ideas flowed into my native language, and thus they speak, not from themselves, but in me; and that this is a proof that they not only come into those things which are man's, but also that they suppose them to be their own. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6200.">6200.</a></font></span>
 <p>As I have been now continuously for nine years in company with spirits and angels, I have carefully observed how the case is with regard to influx. While I have been thinking, the material ideas of my thought appeared as it were In the middle of a kind of undulation, <a name="fr_144"></a><a href="#fn_144"><font size="1">6200-1</font></a> and I noticed that this undulation was nothing else than such things as had been adjoined to that subject in the memory, and that the full thought appears in this way to the spirits; but that nothing else then comes to the man's apprehension than that which is In the middle and which had appeared as material. I have likened that surrounding undulation to spiritual wings, by which the thing thought of is elevated out of the memory. From this the man has perception of a subject. That in that surrounding undulation there were innumerable things which agreed with the subject thought of, was made evident to me from the fact that the spirits who were in a more subtle sphere thereby knew all those things which I had ever known on that subject; and thus that they fully imbibe and put on all things which belong to the man; and genii, who attend solely to the cupidities and affections, imbibe and put on those things which are of the loves. To illustrate this by an example: When I thought of a man whom I know, then the idea of him, such as it appears when his name is mentioned before a man, was presented in the midst; but round about, like an undulating volatile something (undans volatile), was everything that I had known and thought about him from childhood; whereby the whole of him, such as he was in my thought and affection, appeared among the spirits In an instant. Moreover when I have been thinking about any city, then from that undulating sphere that was round about, the spirits instantly knew all that I had seen and known about it. The case was the same with matters of science. </p>
