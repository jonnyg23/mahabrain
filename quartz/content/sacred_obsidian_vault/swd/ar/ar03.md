 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="101.">101.</a></font></span>
 <p>And ye shall have affliction ten days, signifies that this will endure its full time, that is, as long as they are willing to remain in falsities. "Affliction" here signifies infestation (of which above, n. 33, 95), thus temptation; and "ten days" signify the duration of that state to the full; therefore it follows, "Be thou faithful unto death," by which is signified the reception and acknowledgment of truths, until by their means falsities are removed, and as it were abolished. That "ten days" signify duration of state even to the full is, because "days" signify states, and "ten" what is full: for times in the Word signify states (n. 947), and numbers describe their quality (n. 9).  [2] As "ten" signify what is full, they also signify much and many, also each and all, as may appear from these passages which follow:     The men who have seen My glory, have tempted Me ten times (Num. 14:22).     These ten times have ye treated me with ignominy (Job 19:3).     Daniel was found ten times wiser than the astrologers (Dan. 1:20).      Ten women shall bake bread in one oven (Lev. 26:26).     Ten men out of all languages of the nations shall take hold of the skirt of a man a Jew (Zech. 8:23). Because "ten" signifies many, and also all, therefore the things which were written upon the tables of the Decalogue by Jehovah, are called the "Ten Words" (Deut. 4:13; 10:4); the "Ten Words" signify all truths, for they include them. And because "ten" signifies all and all things, therefore the Lord compared the kingdom of the heavens to "ten virgins" (Matt. 25:1). Likewise in the parable He said of the nobleman, that he gave his servants "ten pounds" to trade with (Luke 19:12-27). Many are also signified by:     The ten horns of the beast which came up out of the sea (Dan. 7:7);  And by the ten horns and the ten diadems upon the horns of the beast coming up out of the sea (Rev. 13:1);     Also by the ten horns of the dragon (Rev. 12:3);     And by the ten horns of the scarlet-colored beast, upon which the woman sat (Rev. 17:3, 7, 12). [3] By "ten horns" is signified much power. From the signification of the number "ten," as being what is full, much, and all, it may be seen why it was ordained, that:     A tenth part of all the produce of the earth was given to Jehovah, and by Jehovah to Aaron and the Levites (Num. 18:24, 28; Deut. 14:22); also, why Abram gave Melchizedek tithes of all (Gen. 14:18, 20); for by this was signified that thus all they had was from Jehovah, and was sanctified (see Mal. 3:10). From these things, it may now appear, that by having "affliction ten days," is signified that temptation will last its full time, that is, so long as they are willing to remain in falsities; for falsities are never taken away from a man against his will, but with it. </p>

 <p>Be thou faithful unto death, signifies reception and acknowledgment of truths, until falsities are removed, and as it were abolished. By "be thou faithful unto death," in the natural sense, is meant, that they must not depart from fidelity even to the end of life; but in the spiritual sense, that they must receive and acknowledge truths, even until falsities are removed by them, and as it were abolished; for this sense is properly for those who are in the spiritual world, for whom there is no death. Therefore by "death" is here meant the end of their temptation. It is said, until they are, as it were, abolished, because falsities and evils with man are not abolished, but removed, and when they are removed they appear as if they were abolished, because when evils and falsities are removed, man is kept in goods and truths by the Lord. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="103.">103.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I will give thee a crown of life, signifies that they will then have eternal life, the reward of victory. Because temptations even unto death are here treated of, it is said that a crown of life will be given them, such as the martyrs had, who were faithful even unto death; and because the martyrs wished for it, therefore after death crowns were given them, by which was signified the reward of victory; they still appear in their crowns in heaven, which it has been granted me to see. </p>

 <p>Verse 11. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; that this signifies that he who understands these things, ought to obey what the Divine truth of the Word teaches those who will be of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, is evident from the explanation of like words above (n. 87). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="105.">105.</a></font></span>
 <p>He that overcometh; that this signifies he that fights against evils and falsities, and is reformed, is evident from the explanation (n. 88), where like words occur. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="106.">106.</a></font></span>
 <p>Shall not be hurt of the second death, signifies that afterwards they shall not succumb to the evils and falsities from hell. By the first death is meant the death of the body, and by the "second death" is meant the death of the soul, which is damnation (see below, n. 853, 873); and because "Be thou faithful unto death," signifies that they ought to acknowledge truths till by their means falsities are removed (n. 102), it follows, that by "not being hurt of the second death," is signified that afterwards they shall not succumb under evils and falsities from hell, for thereby they are exempted from damnation. </p>

 <p>Verse 12. And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write, signifies to those and concerning those who place the all of the church in good works, and not anything in the truths of doctrine. That these are meant by "the church in Pergamos," is evident from what is written to it, when understood in the spiritual sense. But something must be premised concerning these, that it may be known who they are in the church, and what is their quality. There are two kinds of men of whom the Christian church at this day for the most part consists; one, who are in works alone, and in no truths; the other, who are in worship alone, and neither in works nor in truths; the former are here treated of; the latter in what is written to the church in Sardis (n. 154). They who are in works alone and in no truths, are like those who act and do not understand, and deeds without understanding are inanimate. They appear before the angels like images carved out of wood; and they who have placed merit in their works, appear like those carved images, naked, without any covering whatever; they appear also like sheep without wool; and they who place merit in them, like such sheep covered with dung; for all works are done from the will by the understanding, and in the understanding they receive life, and at the same time clothing; hence it is, as was said, that they appear to the angels as things inanimate and naked. </p>

 <p>These things saith He that hath the sharp two-edged sword, signifies the Lord as to the truths of doctrine from the Word, by which evils and falsities are dispersed. In the preceding chapter, where the Son of man is described, Who is the Lord as to the Word, it is said that:     A sharp two-edged sword was seen to go out of His mouth (Rev. 2:16). That by this is signified the dispersion of falsities by the Word, and by doctrine thence from the Lord, may be seen above (n. 52). This is said to those and concerning those, who place the all of the church in works alone, and not anything in the truths of doctrine; to whom, because they omit or lightly esteem truths of doctrine which yet are necessary, it is said in what follows:     Repent, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight with them with the sword of My mouth (Rev. 2:16). </p>

 <p>Verse 13. I know thy works; that this signifies that the Lord sees all their interiors and exteriors at once, may be seen above (n. 76), where the same is explained; here that the Lord sees that they are in works alone, and not in doctrinals. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="110.">110.</a></font></span>
 <p>And where thou dwellest, where Satan's throne is, signifies their life in thick darkness. That by "Satan" is meant the hell of those who are in falsities may be seen above (n. 97); and to be in falsities is to be in spiritual thick darkness. "Spiritual thick darkness," "the shadow of death," and "darkness" are nothing else but the states of those in hell, who are in the falsities of evil; therefore, in the Word, falsities are described by them; from which it may appear, that by "Satan's throne" is signified mere thick darkness. But by thick darkness here is not meant that they are in mere falsities, but that they are in no truths of doctrine; for truths of the doctrine, which are from the Word, are in light, therefore not to be in truths is not to be in light, consequently to be in thick darkness. That truths are in the light of heaven, may be seen in Heaven and Hell (n. 126-140); and in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning Sacred Scripture (n. 73, 104-113).  [2] The Word in many places treats of those who are in "darkness," in "the shadow of death," and in "thick darkness," whose eyes the Lord will open; and by them are meant the Gentiles, who were in good works, but not in any truths, because they did not know the Lord, nor did they have the Word. Exactly similar to these are they in the Christian world, who are in works alone and in no truths of doctrine, therefore they cannot be called anything else than Gentiles; they know the Lord indeed, but yet do not approach Him, and they have the Word, but yet do not search for the truths therein. By "I know where thou dwellest" is signified to know their quality, because in the spiritual world everyone dwells according to the quality of his affection. Hence it may appear, that by "thou dwellest where Satan's throne is" is signified the life of their good in thick darkness.  [3] Satanic spirits also have power through those in the spiritual world who are in works alone, but without them they have none; for they adjoin them to themselves, provided one of them says, I am thy neighbor, and on this account good offices ought to be extended to me; on hearing this they approach, and give aid; nor do they inquire who and what he is, because they do not have truths, by which alone one can be distinguished from another. This also is signified by "thou dwellest where satan's throne is." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="111.">111.</a></font></span>
 <p>And thou holdest fast My name, and hast not denied My faith, signifies when yet they have religion and worship according to it, and also acknowledge the Word to be the Divine truth. That by the "name" of Jehovah, or of the Lord is meant all by which He is worshiped, thus the all of religion, may be seen above (n. 81); here therefore it signifies that they have religion, and, according to religion, worship. By "faith," here is not meant that which exists in the church at this day, but the Divine truth, because faith is of truth and truth is of faith; nothing else is meant by "faith" in heaven, nor by the "faith of God" in the Word; hence it is that faith and truth are expressed in the Hebrew language by one and the same word, and are called Amuna. Since then by "the faith of God" is meant the Divine truth, and the Word is Divine truth itself, it is evident that by "thou hast not denied My faith," is meant, that they acknowledge that the Word is the Divine truth. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="112.">112.</a></font></span>
 <p>Even in those days wherein Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth, signifies when all truth was extinguished by falsities in the church. By "martyr" is signified confession of the truth, the same as by "a witness" (above, n. 6, 16), because "martyr" and "witness" are expressed in the Greek language by one expression. "Antipas" is named from the spiritual or angelic language. Since by "Antipas the martyr" is signified a confessor of the truth, and, abstractly, the truth itself, it is evident that, by "in the days wherein Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth," is signified, when truth was extinguished by falsities in the church. That by "Satan" is meant the hell where and from whence falsities are, may be seen above (n. 97). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="113.">113.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 14. But I have a few things against thee, signifies that the things which follow are against them, as is evident without explanation. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="114.">114.</a></font></span>
 <p>Because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol-sacrifices, and to commit whoredom, signifies that there are some among them who do hypocritical works, by which the worship of God in the church is defiled and adulterated. That by these things are meant they who do works by which worship is defiled and adulterated, is evident from the historical parts of the Word concerning Balaam and Balak king of Moab. For Balaam was a hypocrite, and a diviner; for he spoke well of the sons of Israel from Jehovah, when yet he cherished in his heart a desire to destroy them, and also he did destroy them by the counsel he gave Balak; from which it was evident that his works were hypocritical. That he was a diviner we read in Num. 22:7; 24:1; Josh. 13:22. That he spoke in favor of the children of Israel, by blessing them (see Num. 23:7-15, 18-24; 24:5-9, 16-19). But that he spoke these things from Jehovah (see Num. 23:5, 12, 16; 24:13). That he cherished in his heart a desire to destroy them, and also did destroy them by the counsel given to Balak (see Num. 31:16). The counsel which he gave is in Num. 25:1, 9, 18. This was the stumbling block which he cast before the sons of Israel, concerning which it is thus written:     In Shittim the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab, and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; the people did eat and bowed themselves down to their gods, especially they adjoined themselves unto Baalpeor: therefore there were slain of Israel twenty-four thousand (Num. 25:1-3, 9, 18). By "the sons of Israel" is signified the church; by eating of their sacrifices, is signified the appropriation of what is holy; therefore by eating of the sacrifices of other gods, or idol-sacrifices, is signified the defilement and profanation of what is holy; by "committing whoredom," is signified to adulterate and pervert worship; that by "Moab," and therefore by its king, and its daughters, are also signified they who defile and adulterate worship, may be seen in The Arcana Coelestia, published at London (n. 2468). From hence it is evident, that this is the spiritual sense of these words. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="115.">115.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 15. So thou hast, even thou, them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I hate, signifies that there are some among them also who make works meritorious. That the "works of the Nicolaitans" are meritorious works, may be seen above (n. 86). Among those who place the all of the church and of salvation in good works, and not anything in truths of doctrine, who are those who are meant by "the church in Pergamos," there are some who do hypocritical works and also meritorious works, but still not all; therefore it is said, "Thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam;" as also, "So thou hast, even thou, them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans;" and all works of worship are either good, or meritorious, or hypocritical, therefore the two latter are here spoken of, and good works afterwards in what follows. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="116.">116.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 16. Repent, signifies that they should guard themselves against such works, and do works which are good. That these things are signified by "repent," is, because it now treats of meritorious and hypocritical goods, against which they should guard themselves who place the all of the church and of salvation in good works, and not anything in the truths of doctrine; when yet the truths of doctrine teach how and what is to be willed and thought, or loved and believed, that the works may be good. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="117.">117.</a></font></span>
 <p>Or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight with them with the sword of my mouth, signifies, if not, that the Lord will contend with them from the Word, and convince them that their works are evil. But the explanation of these words may be seen above (n. 108). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="118.">118.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 17. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches, signifies that he who understands these things, ought to obey what the Divine truth of the Word teaches those who will be of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, as appears above (n. 87), where similar words are explained. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="119.">119.</a></font></span>
 <p>To him that overcometh, signifies he that fights against his evils and falsities and is reformed, as is also evident from the explanation given above (n. 88). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="120.">120.</a></font></span>
 <p>I will give to eat of the hidden manna, signifies wisdom, and at the same time the appropriation of the good of celestial love in works, and thus conjunction of the Lord with those who work. By "the hidden manna," which they will have who are in good works, and who at the same time adjoin the truths of doctrine to works, is meant hidden wisdom of a quality like that which they have who are in the third heaven. For these, because they were in good works, and at the same time in truths of doctrine in the world, are in wisdom above other angels, but in hidden wisdom, for it is written in their life and not so much on their memory; therefore they are of such a nature that they do not talk of the truths of doctrine, but do them, and they do them because they know them, and also see them when others speak them. That the good of love is appropriated to them, and the Lord conjoins Himself with those who adjoin truths of doctrine to good works, and thus gives them wisdom in their good, and that this is "giving to eat of the hidden manna," may appear from these words of the Lord:     The bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. I am the bread of life; your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that he who eateth thereof may not die. I am the living bread, that came down from heaven; if anyone eat of this bread he shall live forever (John 6:31-51).     From which it is evident, that the Lord Himself is "the hidden manna" which will be in their works, if they approach Him alone. Whether you say "the Lord" or "the good of celestial love," and "the wisdom of that love," it is the same. But this is an arcanum which enters with difficulty into the natural idea of anyone, so long as it is veiled over with a cloud from worldly things; but it does enter when the mind is serene and in the sunshine, as may be seen in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom from beginning to end. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="121.">121.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I will give him a white stone, signifies truths favoring and united to good. "A white stone" signifies this because in judgments votes were collected by stones, and by white stones those which were affirmative; that it is affirmative truths which are signified is, because "white" is predicated of truths (n. 167, 379); hence it is, that by a "white stone" are signified truths favoring good; the reason why they are also united to good, is, because good invites and unites them to itself; for all good loves truth and conjoins to itself such as agrees with itself, especially the good of celestial love; this so unites truths to itself, that they altogether make a one. Hence it is, that they see truths from good alone. These are meant by "those who have the law written in their hearts," of whom it is said in Jeremiah:     I will put My law in the midst of them, and I will write it on their heart; neither shall they teach any longer everyone his neighbor, and everyone his brother, saying, Know ye Jehovah, for all shall know Me (Jer. 31:33-34). Such are all who are in the third heaven. They do not speak of truths from any memory, but clearly see them when they hear others speaking of them, especially when they are reading the Word; the reason is, because they are in the very marriage of good and truth. Such do they become in the world, who have approached the Lord alone, and have done good works, because they are according to the truths of the Word; concerning whom something may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (n. 25-26, 270-271). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="122.">122.</a></font></span>
 <p>And in the stone a new name written, signifies that thus they will have good of a quality such as they had not before. That "name" signifies the quality of a thing, may be seen above (n. 81), therefore here the quality of good. All the quality of good is from the truths that are united to it; for good without truths is like bread and food without wine and water, which do not nourish; and also like fruit in which there is no juice. It appears also like trees stripped of the leaves, on which there hang a few dry apples left from the autumn. This is also meant by these words of the Lord:     For everyone shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves (Mark 9:49-50). Salt here is the desire of truth. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="123.">123.</a></font></span>
 <p>Which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it, signifies that it does not appear to anyone, because it is inscribed on their life. That truths united to good are not inscribed on their memories, but on their lives, may be seen above (n. 121, 122), and what is inscribed on the life alone, and not on the memory, does not appear to anyone, not even to themselves, except from this, that they perceive whether it is true, and what is true, when they hear and read; for the interiors of their mind are open even unto the Lord; and because the Lord is in them, and He sees all things, therefore He causes them to see as from themselves; but yet from their wisdom they know that they do not see truths from themselves, but from the Lord. Hence, it may appear what is meant by all this, "I will give him to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it:" the sum of its signification is, that they will be angels of the third heaven, if they read the Word, draw therefrom truths of doctrine, and approach the Lord. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="124.">124.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 18. And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write, signifies, to those and concerning those, who are in faith from charity, and thence in good works; and also to those and concerning those, who are in faith separate from charity, and thence in evil works. That both the former and latter are described by "the church in Thyatira," is evident from what is written to it, when understood in the spiritual sense. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="125.">125.</a></font></span>
 <p>These things saith the Son of God, who hath His eyes like unto a flame of fire, signifies the Lord as to the Divine wisdom of His Divine love. That this is the signification, may be seen explained above (n. 48). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="126.">126.</a></font></span>
 <p>And His feet like fine brass, signifies the Divine good natural, as is evident from the explanation given above (n. 49). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="127.">127.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 19. I know thy works, signifies that the Lord sees all their interiors and exteriors at once, as may be seen above, where these words are explained (n. 76). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="128.">128.</a></font></span>
 <p>And charity and ministry, signifies the spiritual affection which is called charity, and its operation. Charity is a spiritual affection, because charity is love towards the neighbor, and love towards the neighbor is that affection: that "ministry" is its operation, follows from their being called "ministers" in the Word who do the things which are of charity. The man who is a worshiper of God is sometimes called "a servant," and sometimes a "minister," and he is called "a servant of God" who is in truths, and "a minister of God" who is in goods; the reason is, because truth serves good, and good ministers to truth. That he is called "a servant" who is in truths, may be seen above (n. 3); but that he is called "a minister" who is in good, is evident from these passages:     Ye shall be called the priests of Jehovah, the ministers of our <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">128-1</font></a> God (Isa. 61:6).     My covenant shall not be broken with the Levites My ministers (Jer. 33:21). They are called "ministers," because priests represented the Lord as to Divine good.     Bless Jehovah all His hosts, ye ministers of His that do His will (Ps. 103:21-22). Jehovah maketh His angels spirits; His ministers a flaming fire (Ps. 104:4). "Angels spirits" are they who are in truths, and "angels ministers" they who are in goods; "flaming fire" also signifies the good of love. Jesus said:     Whosoever will be great, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be first, let him be your servant (Matt. 20:26-27; 23:11-12). "Minister" is here predicated of good, and "servant" of truth. The same is signified by "ministering" and "ministry" in Isaiah 61:6; John 12:26; Luke 12:37; and in other places. Hence it is evident, that by "charity" and "ministry," is signified spiritual affection and its operation; for good is of charity, and truth is of faith. </p>
 
 
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="129.">129.</a></font></span>
 <p>And thy faith and endurance, signifies truth, and the study to procure and teach it. That "faith" signifies truth, may be seen above (n. 111); and that in such case endurance signifies study and labor of procuring and teaching it, follows as a consequence. <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">129-1</font></a> </p>
 
 
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="130.">130.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the last to be more than the first, signifies the increase thereof from the spiritual affection of truth, which is charity. By "the last works more than the first," are meant all things of their charity and faith, for these are the interior things from which are works (n. 73, 76, 94). These things increase when charity is in the first place and faith in the second; for charity is the spiritual affection of doing good, and from it comes the spiritual affection of knowing truth, for good loves truth as food does drink, for it desires to be nourished, and is nourished, by truths; hence it is, that they who are in genuine charity have a continual increase of truth. This then is what is signified by "I know thy works the last more than the first." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="131.">131.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 20. But I have a few things against thee, signifies that the following things may possibly be a stumblingblock to them. For what now follows relates to faith separated from charity, which may be a stumblingblock to those who are in faith from charity. </p>

 <p>That thou permittest the woman Jezebel, signifies that among them there are some in the church who separate faith from charity, and make faith alone saving. That faith separated from charity is meant by "the woman Jezebel" is evident from the things which now follow, when they are unfolded in series by means of the spiritual sense and when they are compared with that faith; for these were the evil deeds of Jezebel the wife of Ahab:     That she went and served Baal, and built him an altar in Samaria, and made a grove (1 Kings 16:31-33).     That she slew the prophets of Jehovah (1 Kings 18:4, 13).     That she wished to kill Elijah (1 Kings 19:1-2).     That through deceit by substituting false witnesses, she took away the vineyard from Naboth, and killed him (1 Kings 21:6-7 seq.).     That on account of these evil deeds, it was foretold to her by Elijah, that the dogs should eat her (1 Kings 21:23).     That she was thrown down from the window where she stood painted, and that some of her blood was sprinkled upon the wall, and upon the horses which trampled her (2 Kings 9:30-33). [2] As all the historical as well as the prophetical parts of the Word signify the spiritual things of the church, so also do these; and they signify faith separated from charity is evident from the spiritual sense, and from collating them together; for by "going and serving Baal" and "building him an altar" and "making a grove" is signified to serve lusts of all kinds, or what is the same, the devil, not thinking of any evil lust, nor of any sin, as they do who have no doctrine of charity and life, but of faith only. By "slaying the prophets" is signified to destroy the truths of doctrine from the Word. By "wishing to kill Elijah" is signified to wish to do the same to the Word itself. By "taking away the vineyard from Naboth and killing him" is signified the church, for "the vineyard" is the church: by "the dogs" which ate her, are signified lusts. By "casting from the window, sprinkling the blood on the wall, and being trampled by the horses" is signified their destruction, for the particulars signify that also; "window" signifies truth in the light; "blood" falsity; "wall" truth in ultimates, "horse" the understanding of the Word. Hence it may be concluded, that these things, collated together, coincide with faith separated from charity, as may further appear from what follows in Revelation, where this faith is treated of. </p>

 <p>Who calleth herself a prophetess, signifies and who make it the very doctrine of the church, and found all theology upon it. That by "prophet" in the Word is signified the doctrine of the church, may be seen above (n. 8); therefore the like is signified by "prophetess." It is known that in the Reformed Christian church faith alone has been accepted as the only means of salvation, and that thence the works of charity have been separated from faith, as not saving; hence it is that the entire doctrine of the salvation of man, which is called theology, at this day is that faith, consequently "the woman Jezebel." </p>

 <p>To teach and to seduce My servants to commit whoredom, signifies, from which it comes to pass that the truths of the Word are falsified. By "to teach and to seduce the servants of the Lord," is meant those who are able and willing to be instructed in truths from the Word; that they are called "servants of the Lord" who are in truths, may be seen above (n. 3, 128); and by "committing whoredom," is signified to adulterate and falsify the Word: that this is signified by "committing whoredom," is, because in every particular of the Word there is the marriage of good and truth, and this marriage is broken when good is separated and taken away from truth. That in every particular of the Word there is the marriage of the Lord and the church, and thence the marriage of good and truth, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 80-90). From this it is, that "to commit whoredom" signifies to adulterate the goods and falsify the truths of the Word; and because this is spiritual whoredom, therefore also they who from their own reason have falsified the Word, after death, when they come into the spiritual world, become whoremongers: and, what has hitherto been concealed from the world, they who have confirmed themselves in faith alone to the exclusion of works of charity, are in the lust of committing the adultery of a son with his mother. That they are in the lust of committing so abominable a kind of adultery, has often been perceived in the spiritual world. Remember this, and inquire after death, and you will be confirmed.  [2] I have not ventured to reveal this before, because it offends the ears. This adultery is signified by the adultery of Reuben with Bilhah his father's concubine (Gen. 35:22); for by "Reuben" that faith is signified, for which cause he was cursed by his father Israel, and afterwards his birthright was taken away from him; for his father Israel, prophesying concerning his sons, said of Reuben:     Reuben my firstborn, thou art my strength, and the beginning of my power, light as water, thou shalt not excel, because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then thou didst profane it: he went up to my couch (Gen. 49:3-4). Therefore his birthright was taken from him.     Reuben was the firstborn of Israel; but because he polluted his father's couch, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph (1 Chron. 5:1).  That by "Reuben" was represented truth from good, or faith from charity, and afterwards truth separated from good, or faith separated from charity, will be seen in the explanation of chapter 7:5.  [3] That by "whoredoms" are signified adulterations of good and falsifications of truth in the Word, may appear from the following passages:     When Joram saw Jehu, he said, Is it peace, Jehu? Who said, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel, and her incantations are so many? (2 Kings 9:22). By "the whoredoms of Jezebel" are not meant any whoredoms, but her deeds, of which above (n. 132).     Your sons shall be pasturing in the wilderness forty <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">134-1</font></a> years, and they shall bear your <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">134-2</font></a> whoredoms (Num. 14:33).     And I will cut off the soul that looketh back to pythons and soothsayers to go a whoring after them (Lev. 20:6).     Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods (Exod. 34:15-16).     Jerusalem, thou didst trust in thy beauty, and didst commit whoredom on account of thy fame, even so that thou didst pour out thy whoredoms on everyone that passed by. Thou didst commit whoredom with the sons of Egypt, thy neighbors, great of flesh, and didst multiply thy whoredom. Thou didst commit whoredom with the sons of Assyria even when there was no satiety to thee with whom thou didst commit whoredom. Thou hast multiplied thy whoredom even to Chaldea. A woman, an adulteress, that taketh strangers instead of her husband. All give reward to their harlots; but thou hast given rewards to all, that they may come unto thee on every side in thy whoredoms. Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah (Ezek. 16:15-16, 26, 28-29, 32-33, 35 seq.). "Jerusalem" in this passage is the Israelitish and Jewish church; by her "whoredoms" are meant adulterations and falsifications of the Word; and because in the Word by "Egypt" is signified the science of the natural man, by "Assyria" ratiocination thence, by "Chaldea" profanation of truth, and by "Babylon" profanation of good, therefore it is said that she committed whoredom with them.     [4] There were two women, the daughters of one mother; they committed whoredom in Egypt; they committed whoredom in their youth; one committed whoredom under Me, and she doted on her lovers, the Assyrians her neighbors. Thus she gave her whoredoms with them; yet she did not abandon her whoredoms in Egypt. The other corrupted her love more than she, and her whoredoms more than the whoredoms of her sister. She added to her whoredoms, she loved the Chaldeans. The sons of Babel came to her to the bed of loves, and they polluted her by their whoredoms (Ezek. 23:2-3, 5, 7-8, 11, 14, 16-17 seq.). Here "the two daughters of one mother" are likewise the Israelitish and Jewish church, whose adulterations and falsifications of the Word are here described as above by "whoredoms."  [5] So in the following passages:     Thou hast committed whoredom with many companions; thou hast profaned the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness. Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? going up upon every high mountain, and committing whoredom. Also perfidious Judah went and committed whoredom. So that by the voice of her whoredom, she hath profaned the land; she hath committed adultery with stone and wood (Jer. 3:1-2, 6, 8-9; and in other places).     Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, seek if you can find a man, who doeth judgment, and seeketh the truth. When I had satiated them, they committed whoredom and came into the harlot's house in a crowd (Jer. 5:1, 7).     I have seen thy adulteries, thy neighings, the crime of thy whoredoms, thy abominations on the hills in the field. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem, wilt thou not be made clean? (Jer. 13:27).     I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible stubbornness, in committing adultery and walking in lies (Jer. 23:14).     They have committed foolishness in Israel, they committed whoredom and spoke My word in My name with lying (Jer. 29:23).     They sinned against Me, I will turn their glory into reproach; they committed whoredom, because they have forsaken Jehovah. Whoredom occupied their heart. Your daughters commit whoredom, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery (Hos. 4:7, 10-11, 13).     I know, Ephraim, that he hath altogether committed whoredom, and Israel is polluted (Hos. 5:3).     I have seen a foul thing in the house of Israel; there Ephraim committeth whoredom; Israel is polluted (Hos. 6:10).     "Israel" here is the church, and "Ephraim" is the understanding of the Word, from which, and according to which, the church is; therefore it is said "Ephraim hath committed whoredom, and Israel is polluted."  [6] Because the church had falsified the Word, the prophet Hosea was commanded to take unto himself a harlot to wife, saying:     Take unto thee a woman of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms; for the land, by committing whoredom, hath committed whoredom against Jehovah (Hos. 1:2). Again:     Love a woman beloved of her companion, and an adulteress (Hos. 3:1). As the Jewish church was such, therefore the Jewish nation was called by the Lord "an adulterous generation" (Matt. 12:39; 16:4; Mark 8:38); and in Isaiah, "a seed of adulterers" (57:3); and in Nahum:     Woe to the city of bloods, wholly in a lie, a multitude of those pierced, above the multitude of the whoredoms of the harlot, that selleth nations by her whoredoms (Nahum 3:1, 3-4). [7] Since "Babylon" adulterates and falsifies the Word more than others in the Christian world, she is therefore called "the great harlot," and the following is said of her in Revelation:     Babylon hath made all nations to drink of the wine of the anger of her whoredom (Rev. 14:8).     For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom, and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her (Rev. 18:3).     The angel said, I will show unto thee the judgment of the great harlot, with whom the kings of the earth have committed whoredom (Rev. 17:1-2).     He hath judged the great harlot, which did corrupt the earth with her whoredom (Rev. 19:2). From these passages it manifestly appears, that "to commit adultery" and "to commit whoredom" signify to adulterate and falsify the goods and truths of the Word. </p>

 <p>And to eat idol-sacrifices, signifies the defilement of worship thence, and profanations, as is clear from the explanation given above (n. 114); for they who adulterate goods appropriate to themselves unclean things, by which they defile and profane worship. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="136.">136.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 21. And I gave her time to repent of her whoredom, and she repented not, signifies that they who have confirmed themselves in that doctrine, will not recede, although they see things contrary to it in the Word. By receding from whoredom, is here signified to recede from falsifying the Word. That they see things contrary to their doctrine, is evident from a thousand passages in the Word, where it is said that evils are to be shunned, and that goods are to be done; also that they who do goods come into heaven, and they who do evils into hell, as also that faith without works is dead and diabolical. But it may be asked, what part of the Word have they falsified, or where have they spiritually committed whoredom with the Word? It may be answered, that they have falsified the whole Word; for the whole Word is nothing else but the doctrine of love to the Lord, and of love towards the neighbor, for the Lord says, that on the commandments concerning those two loves hang all the law and the prophets (Matt. 22:40). There is also in the Word the doctrine of faith, yet not of such faith, but of the faith of love. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="137.">137.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 22. Behold I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great affliction, signifies that thus they will be left in their doctrine with the falsifications, and that they will be grievously infested by falsities. That by "bed" is signified doctrine, will be seen presently; that by "committing adultery" falsifications of truth are signified, may be seen above (n. 134, 136); and that by "affliction" is signified infestation from falsities (n. 33, 95, 101); and hence by "great affliction" is signified grievous infestation. That "a bed" signifies doctrine is from correspondence, for as the body rests in its bed, so does the mind rest in its doctrine. But by "bed" is signified the doctrine which everyone acquires to himself either from the Word, or from his own intelligence, for therein the mind rests and, as it were, sleeps. The beds in which they lie in the spiritual world, are from no other origin; for there everyone's bed is according to the quality of his science and intelligence, magnificent for the wise, mean for the unwise, and filthy for falsifiers.  [2] This is signified by "a bed" in Luke:     I say unto you, in that night there shall be two in one bed; the one shall be taken and the other left (Luke 17:34). This is concerning the Last Judgment; "two in one bed" means two in one doctrine, but not in similar life. In John:     Jesus saith unto the sick man, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk; and he took up his bed, and walked (John 5:8-9); and in Mark:     Jesus said unto the palsied, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee; and He said unto the Scribes, Whether is it easier to say, thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say, take up thy bed, and walk? then He said, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk; and he took up the bed, and went forth from them (Mark 2:5, 9, 11-12). That here something is signified by "bed" is evident, because Jesus said, "Whether is it easier to say, thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say, take up thy bed and walk?" By "carrying his bed and walking" is signified to meditate in doctrine; it is so understood in heaven.  [3] Doctrine is also signified by "bed" in Amos:     As the shepherd rescueth from the mouth of the lion, so shall the sons of Israel be rescued that dwell in Samaria, in the corner of a bed, and in the extremity of a couch (Amos 3:12). "In the corner of a bed" and "in the extremity of a couch" means what is more remote from the truths and goods of doctrine. "Bed" and "couch" and "bed chamber" have a similar signification in other places (as in Isa. 28:20; 57:2, 7-8; Ezek. 23:41; Amos 6:4; Micah 2:1; Ps. 4:4; Ps. 36:4; Ps. 41:3; Job 7:13; Lev. 15:4-5). Since by "Jacob" in the Propheticals of the Word is signified the church as to doctrine, therefore it is said of him, that:     He bowed himself upon the head of the bed (Gen. 47:31).     That when Joseph came, he sat upon the bed (Gen. 48:2).     That he gathered up his feet upon the bed, and expired (Gen. 49:33). The doctrine of the church is signified by "Jacob" therefore sometimes when I have thought of Jacob, there has appeared to me above, in front, a man lying in a bed. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="138.">138.</a></font></span>
 <p>Except they repent of their works, signifies if they will not desist from separating faith from charity, and from falsifying the Word, as may appear without further explanation. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="139.">139.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 23. And I will kill her sons with death, signifies that all the truths of the Word with them will be turned into falsities. By "sons" in the Word, are signified truths, and in the opposite sense, falsities; therefore "to kill sons" signifies to turn truths into falsities, for thus they perish; neither is anything else meant by "the slain and pierced of Jehovah;" by "killing her sons with death" is also signified to condemn their falsities. That "sons" signify truths, and in the opposite sense falsities is because in the spiritual sense of the Word by generations, are meant spiritual generations, and in like manner by consanguinities and affinities; thus by their names, as by father, mother, sons, daughters, brethren, sisters, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, and the rest; neither does spiritual generation give birth to any other sons and daughters, than truths and goods. See (n. 542, 543), below. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="140.">140.</a></font></span>
 <p>And all the churches shall know that I am He which searcheth the reins and hearts, signifies that the church shall know that the Lord sees the quality of everyone's truth and the quality of everyone's good. By "the seven churches" is signified the whole church, as before; and by "searching the reins and hearts," is signified to see all the things which a man believes and loves, thus the quality of his truth and of his good. That this is the signification of "searching the reins and hearts," is from correspondence, for the Word in its literal sense consists of mere correspondences. The correspondence is from this, that as the reins purify the blood from the impurities which are called urinous, and the heart purifies the blood from the unclean things which are called foul, so the truth of faith purifies man from falsities, and the good of love from evils.  [2] Thence it is that the ancients placed love and its affections in the heart, and intelligence and its perceptions in the reins; as may appear from these passages in the Word:     Behold, thou desirest truth in the reins, and in the hidden part thou makest wisdom known to me (Ps. 51:6).     Thou possessest my reins, my bone was not hid from thee when I was made in secret (Ps. 139:13, 15).     My heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins, but I am stupid, I do not know (Ps. 73:21-22).     I Jehovah search the heart, and try the reins, even to give everyone according to his ways (Jer. 17:10).     Thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins; Thou, O Jehovah, wilt see me, and try my heart (Jer. 12:2-3).     Jehovah is a judge of justice, trying the reins and the heart (Jer. 11:20; 20:12).     Confirm the just, for it is the just God who trieth the hearts and reins (Ps. 7:9). Prove me, O Jehovah, and try me, explore my reins and my heart (Ps. 26:2). By "reins" in these places are signified truths of intelligence and faith, and by "heart," the good of love and charity. That "heart" signifies the love and its affections, may be seen in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom (n. 371-393). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="141.">141.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I will give unto everyone according to his works, signifies that He gives unto everyone according to the charity and its faith which are in his works. That "works" are the containers of charity and faith, and that charity and faith without works are only like airy images, which vanish as soon as they have appeared, may be seen above (n. 76). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="142.">142.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 24. But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, signifies both to those with whom the doctrine of faith is separated from charity, and to those with whom the doctrine of faith is joined with charity, is evident from what is said above, without further explanation. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="143.">143.</a></font></span>
 <p>And who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, signifies they who do not understand their interiors, which are mere falsities. That by "Satan" is meant the hell of those who are in falsities, and abstractly, falsities, may be seen above (n. 97); therefore by its "depths" are signified the interiors of the doctrine separated from charity, which are mere falsities. The depths and interiors of that doctrine are what are delivered in their books and lectures in the universities, and thence in their preachings, the nature of which is pointed out in what is prefixed to the first chapter, where their doctrines are quoted; and particularly in what is there adduced concerning Justification by Faith and concerning Good Works; where it may be seen stated that the clergy alone know the arcana of that doctrine, but not the laity, therefore the latter principally are meant by those "who have not known the depths of Satan." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="144.">144.</a></font></span>
 <p>I will put upon you none other burden, signifies, only that they should beware of them. The reason is, because they confirm their falsities by reasonings from the natural man, and by some things from the Word which they falsify, for by these they can seduce. They are like serpents in the grass which bite those that pass by; or like concealed poisons which kill the unwary. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="145.">145.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 25. Nevertheless, that which ye have, hold fast till I come, signifies that they should retain the few things which they know from charity and faith, thence from the Word, and live according to them, until the New Heaven and the New Church are formed, which are the Lord's coming. For these and no others receive the things which the doctrine of the New Jerusalem teaches concerning the Lord and charity. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="146.">146.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 26. And he that overcometh and keepeth My works unto the end, signifies those who fight against evils and falsities and are reformed, and are actually in charity, and thence faith, and remain in them to the end of life. That "to overcome" is to fight against evils and falsities, may be seen above (n. 88); and that "works" are charity and thence faith in act (n. 76, 141); that "to keep them unto the end," is to be in them, and remain in them to the end of life, is evident. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="147.">147.</a></font></span>
 <p>To him will I give power over the nations, signifies that they shall overcome evils in themselves which are from hell. That by "nations" in the Word are meant those who are in good, and in the opposite sense, those who are in evil, thus, abstractly, goods and evils, may be seen below (n. 483); therefore here by "giving power over the nations," is signified to give them to overcome the evils from hell in themselves. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="148.">148.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 27. And He shall rule them with a rod of iron, signifies by truths from the literal sense of the Word, and at the same time by rational things from natural light. These things are signified by "a rod or staff of iron" because "a rod or staff" in the Word signifies power, and "iron" signifies natural truth, consequently the natural sense of the Word, and at the same time the natural light of man; in these two consists the power of truth. That Divine truth in the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of its letter is in its power, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 37-49); from this cause the literal sense is the basis, container, and support of its spiritual sense (n. 27-36). And that all power is in the ultimates which are called things natural, may be seen in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Wisdom (n. 205-221); consequently in the natural sense of the letter of the Word, and in the natural light of man. These, therefore, are "the rod of iron" by which He shall "rule the nations" that is, overcome the evils which are from hell. The like is signified by a "rod of iron" in these passages:     Thou shalt break the nations in pieces with a rod of iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel (Ps. 2:9).     The woman brought forth a male who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron (Rev. 12:5).     Out of the mouth of Him that sat upon the white horse went a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations; but He shall rule them with a rod of iron (Rev. 19:15).     Jehovah shall smite the wicked with the rod of His mouth (Isa. 11:4). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="149.">149.</a></font></span>
 <p>As the vessels of a potter shall they be broken in pieces, signifies, as of little or no account. It is said "the vessels of a potter" because by them are signified the things which are of one's own intelligence, which are all falsities, and in themselves of no account; so in David:     Thou shall break the nations in pieces with a rod of iron, Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel (Ps. 2:9). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="150.">150.</a></font></span>
 <p>Even as I have received from My Father, signifies that they have this from the Lord, who, when He was in the world procured to Himself all power over the hells, from His Divine which was in Himself. That the Lord, when He was in the world, by admitting temptations into Himself, and finally by the last of them, which was the passion of the cross, subjugated the hells and glorified His Human, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 29-36); as also above (n. 67); from which it may appear, that "to receive from His Father" is to receive from the Divine which was in Him, for He said that "the Father is in Him and He in the Father"; that "the Father and He are one"; as also "the Father who is in Me"; and more. </p>
