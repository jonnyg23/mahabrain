 <p>We give below three forms of breath, quite popular among the Yogis. The first is the well-known Yogi Cleansing Breath, to which is attributed much of the great lung endurance found among the Yogis. They usually finish up a breathing exercise with this Cleansing Breath, and we have followed this plan in this book. We also give the Yogi Nerve Vitalizing Exercise, which has been handed down among them for ages, and which has never been improved on by Western teachers of Physical Culture, although some of them have "borrowed" it from teachers of Yoga. We also give the Yogi Vocal Breath, which accounts largely for the melodious, vibrant voices of the better class of the Oriental Yogis. We feel that if this book contained nothing more than these three exercises, it would be invaluable to the Western student. Take these exercises as a gift from your Eastern brothers and put them into practice.</p>  
 <p align="center">THE YOGI CLEANSING BREATH</p>  
 <p>The Yogis have a favorite form of breathing which they practice when they feel the necessity of ventilating and cleansing the lungs. They conclude many of their other breathing exercises with this breath, and we have followed this practice in this book. This Cleansing Breath ventilates and cleanses the lungs, stimulates the cells and gives a general tone to the respiratory organs, and is conducive to their general healthy condition. Besides this effect, it is found to greatly refresh the entire system. Speakers, singers,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></a></p>  
 <p>etc., will find this breath especially restful, after having tired the respiratory organs.</p>  
 <p>(1) Inhale a complete breath.</p>  
 <p>(2) Retain the air a few seconds.</p>  
 <p>(3) Pucker up the lips as if for a whistle (but do not swell out the cheeks), then exhale a little air through the opening, with considerable vigor. Then stop for a moment, retaining the air, and then exhale a little more air. Repeat until the air is completely exhaled. Remember that considerable vigor is to be used in exhaling the air through the opening in the lips.</p>  
 <p>This breath will be found quite refreshing when one is tired and generally "used up." A trial will convince the student of its merits. This exercise should be practiced until it can be performed naturally and easily, as it is used to finish up a number of other exercises given in this book, and it should be thoroughly understood.</p>  
 <p align="center">THE YOGI NERVE VITALIZING BREATH</p>  
 <p>This is an exercise well known to the Yogis, who. consider it one of the strongest nerve stimulants and invigorants</p>  
 <p>known to man. Its purpose is to stimulate the Nervous System, develop nerve force, energy and vitality. This exercise brings a stimulating pressure to bear on important nerve centers, which in turn stimulate and energize the entire nervous system, and send an increased flow of nerve force to all parts of the body.</p>  
 <p>(1) Stand erect.</p>  
 <p>(2) Inhale a Complete Breath, and retain same.</p>  
 <p>(3) Extend the arms straight in front of you, letting them be somewhat limp and relaxed, with only sufficient nerve force to hold them out.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></a></p>  
 <p>(4) Slowly draw the hands back toward the shoulders, gradually contracting the muscles and putting force into them, so that when they reach the shoulders the fists will be so tightly clenched that a tremulous motion is felt.</p>  
 <p>(5) Then, keeping the muscles tense, push the fists slowly out, and then draw them back rapidly (still tense) several times.</p>  
 <p>(6) Exhale vigorously through the mouth.</p>  
 <p>(7) Practice the Cleansing Breath.</p>  
 <p>The efficiency of this exercise depends greatly upon the speed of the drawing back of the fists, and the tension of the muscles, and, of course, upon the full lungs. This exercise must be tried to be appreciated. It is without equal as a "bracer," as our Western friends put it.</p>  
 <p align="center">THE YOGI VOCAL BREATH</p>  
 <p>The Yogis have a form of breathing to develop the voice. They are noted for their wonderful voices, which are strong, smooth and clear, and have a wonderful trumpet-like carrying power. They have practiced this particular form of breathing exercise which has resulted in rendering their voices soft, beautiful and flexible, imparting to it that indescribable, peculiar floating quality, combined with great power. The exercise given below will in time impart the above-mentioned qualities, or the Yogi Voice, to the student who practices it faithfully. It is to be understood, of course, that this form of breath is to be used only as an occasional exercise, and not as a regular form of breathing.</p>  
 <p>(1) Inhale a Complete Breath very slowly, but steadily, through the nostrils, taking as much time as possible in the inhalation. </p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>(2) Retain for a few seconds.</p>  
 <p>(3) Expel the air vigorously in one great breath, through the wide opened mouth.</p>  
 <p>(4) Rest the lungs by the Cleansing Breath.</p>  
 <p>Without going deeply into the Yogi theories of sound-production in speaking and singing, we wish to say that experience has taught them that the timbre, quality and power of a voice depends not alone upon the vocal organs in the throat, but that the facial muscles, etc., have much to do with the matter. Some men with large chests produce but a poor tone, while others with comparatively small chests produce tones of amazing strength and quality. Here is an interesting experiment worth trying: Stand before a glass and pucker up your mouth and whistle, and note the shape of your mouth and the general expression of your face. Then sing or speak as you do naturally, and see the difference. Then start to whistle again for a few seconds, and then, without changing the position of your lips or face, sing a few notes and notice what a vibrant resonant, clear and beautiful tone is produced.</p>
