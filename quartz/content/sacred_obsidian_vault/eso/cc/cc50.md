 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Born</span> 1842. Entered Cosmic Consciousness 1877, at the age of thirty-five years. Had a very strong and original mind and a wonderful memory. A gentleman who knew him writes: "He was an extraordinary conversationalist; it was as if he had absorbed the minds and works of Darwin, Huxley and Spencer, and spoke with the authority and knowledge of all three; their works, thought, language, were at his tongue's end; it was an education to be with him for a few days. He was a wonderful violinist—the equal of the best not known as a star. He heard of J. B. [the J.
