 <p align="center"><b>DIVINE COMPANIONSHIP</b></p>  
 <p align="center"><b>A SONG OF HOPE</b></p>  
 <p>My Life is in Thee, O Inner Presence.<br> I look upon Thee and hope springs forth into realization.<br> O Hope within me, undying evidence of Good,<br> Thou dost completely hold me in Thy loving embrace,<br> And from this fond caress assurance shall be born, and confidence and love.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>My hope is in Thee</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><a name="page_327"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 327</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><b>BE STILL AND KNOW</b></p>  
 <p>"Be still and know that I am God."<br> I am still in Thy Presence.<br> I am quiet and peaceful, for I put my trust in Thee.<br> A great stillness steals over me and a great calm quiets my whole being, as I realize Thy Presence.<br> The heart knows of Thee, O Most High within.<br> It is still in Thy Presence, and it puts its whole confidence in Thee alone.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>In Thy Presence I am still</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>CAST ASIDE ALL DOUBT</b></p>  
 <p>Cast aside all doubt, O Soul of mine, and be unafraid, for Thy power is from On High.<br> He Who sitteth in the heavens shall be Thy champion;<br> Thou need not fear; Come forth, O Spirit, from within and express Thyself through me and let not my doubts hinder Thy approach.<br> My faith shall go forth to meet Thee, and my confidence shall embrace Thee.<br> My waiting thought shall bid Thee welcome to my house of Love,<br> And Joy shall accompany us through the ages yet to come.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I lay aside all fear and doubt</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>DIVINE COMPANIONSHIP</b></p>  
 <p>I have an Inner Friend who walks and talks with me daily.<br> He is not afar off, but is within me, a constant companion.<br> I shall never become lonely, for my Friend is always near.<br> I have but to speak and He answers.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_328"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 328</font></a></p>  
 <p>Before ever my lips spoke He told me of His love.<br> O my kind Friend, how dear to me is Thy presence.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The Spirit within me is my Friend</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>HIS EYE IS ON THE SPARROW</b></p>  
 <p>"His eye is on the sparrow and I know He watches me."<br> This is a blessed thought, for it means that we cannot wander from His Presence, nor depart from His care.<br> Always He will watch over us and comfort us.<br> Forever we shall sit in His house and ceaselessly He will care for us.<br> The All-Seeing Eye cannot overlook any one, and all, all shall be kept in His care.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>All are kept in His care</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>HOPE CANNOT DIE</b></p>  
 <p>Hope cannot die. Eternal Hope is forever warm and fresh within me; the deathless Hope built upon the rock of sure knowledge.<br> O Hope Sublime, O Life Supreme, behold I come to Thee as a tired child, and Thou dost rekindle within me the fires of Faith.<br> Strong, swift and sure, Faith springs forth into action and my entire Being rises to meet the Dawn.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Hope, Faith and Love are in me</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>I AM NOT ALONE</b></p>  
 <p>I am not alone, for a Presence goes with me and daily accompanies me on my travels.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 329</font></a></p>  
 <p>Always I shall find this Divine Companion with me.<br> He will not desert nor allow me to go alone.<br> He will always be with me and near me, and will always provide for every want.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>My life is hid with Christ in God</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>I WENT TO THE MOUNTAIN</b></p>  
 <p>I have discovered a Secret Place within, where the thought goes into a mountain high above the din of the world.<br> I have found in this mountain a Place of Peace and rest,<br> A Place of joy and comfort to the heart.<br> I have found that the Secret Place of God is within my own Soul.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I will listen for Thy Voice</i>.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><b>THE JOY OF THE SOUL</b></p>  
 <p>My Soul within me rejoices at the realization of Life.<br> I am made glad as I behold my inner Light;<br> I cannot be sad nor depressed, for the All Good has claimed me as Its own.<br> O Soul within me, rejoice and become glad, for Thy Light has come and Thy Day of Salvation is at hand.<br> Be still within me and behold Him Who sitteth On High.<br> Reflect to me Thy revelation and flood me with Thy marvelous Light.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>I rejoice in my Life within me</i>.</p>
