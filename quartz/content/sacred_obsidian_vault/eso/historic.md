 <p>The Order of the G.D. in the Outer is a Hermetic 
   Society whose members are taught the principles of Occult Science and the Magic 
   of Hermes. During the early part of the second half of the 19th Century, several 
   adepti and chiefs of this order in France and England died, and their deaths 
   caused a temporarily dormant condition of Temple work. Prominent among these 
   were Eliphas Levi, Ragon, Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie, author of the Masonic Encyclopedia 
   and Frederick Hockley, possessed of crystal vision whose M.S.S. we highly esteemed. 
   These and other adepti received their knowledge and power from predecessors 
   of greater imminence and have handed down to us this doctrine and system of 
   Theosophy and Hermetic Science of the Higher Alchemy from a series of practical 
   investigations whose origin is traced to the Fratres Rosae Crucis of Germany, 
   which association was founded by Christian Rosenkreuz about 1398. </p>
 <p align="Justify"> <font color="#000000">He and the theologian, Valentine Andrea, 
   have left us, in the works published about 1614, an account of the exoteric 
   arrangements of the Rosicrucian Society. It seems likely it was Andrea who published 
   in 1614 the Fama Fraternitatis, or Theory of the Society, which must have been 
   derived from the old records of the pupils of Christian Rosenkrawz. But even 
   this arrival of mysticism was a new development of the older wisdom of the Qabalistic 
   Rabbis and of that very ancient secret knowledge of the magic of the Egyptians 
   into which Moses had been initiated. Through the Qabalah, indeed, Europe became 
   possessed of the ancient Wisdom more than from any one other source, for the 
   Hebrews were taught at one time by the Egyptians and later by the Chaldees of 
   Babylon.</font> </p>
 <p align="Justify"> <font color="#000000">It is a curious fact that the classic 
   nations, the Greeks and Romans, have handed down to us but slight glimpses of 
   the Ancient Magic, and this is more notable because Greece succeeded to the 
   mastership of Egypt, and Rome to the Empire of both the Greeks and Jews. Greece 
   did indeed succeed to a share in the mysteries of the Egyptians for the Eleusinian 
   Mysteries were copies of the ancient ceremonies of Isis, Osiris and Serapis; 
   but they lacked true magic. And further, the classic writings contain but faint 
   glimpses of even the Eleusinian Mysteries, and these disclose the fact that 
   the pupils were partly ignorant of the true mysteries, a notable example of 
   which is seen in the use of the words Konx Om Pax, of which they knew not the 
   meaning, the words being the Greek imitation or translation of really ancient 
   Egyptian words, whose meanings has been kept secret for centuries. Hence the 
   0=0 Grade is found to possess Egyptian characteristics and symbolism and the 
   Higher Grades will reveal the source of much of the culture and illustrate the 
   language of Eliphas Levi, through whose adeptship the study of occultism has 
   been popularized.</font> </p>
 <p align="Justify"> <font color="#000000">The First Order is a group of four grades 
   of which Neophytes are admissible when approved by the G.H. Chiefs after showing 
   themselves possessed of sufficient aptitude and knowledge. Beyond the above, 
   there are three grades of Adeptship forming the Second Order . These have the 
   power of selecting Candidates, initiating students into the lower grades and 
   their Chiefs have, in addition, the power of issuing warrants of Temples such 
   as that of Isis Urania. But the highest of all in this ancient scheme are the 
   Great Rulers of the whole system who severally sustain and govern the Third 
   Order, which includes three Magic Titles of Honor and Supremacy. These represent 
   the Supernal Triad of the Sephiroth and are shrouded and unapproachable to the 
   profane and to all others but the Chiefs of the Adepts. In case of a vacancy 
   in this Order, the Chief most learned Adept obtains by decree the well-earned 
   award.</font> </p>
 <p align="Justify"> <font color="#000000">The scheme of the G.D. then is formed 
   upon the type of the Decad of the Sephiroth, the ten Emanations of Deity as 
   figured in the Qabalah whose professors were illuminated by the higher magic 
   of the ancient world. The grades of the First Order will be found to be Hebrew 
   in design and tendency; and inasmuch as the influx of time brought on the revelation 
   of the Christos, the Tiphareth, the Beauty of Microprosopos, Christian design 
   is reflected in the higher degrees.</font> </p>
 <p align="Justify"> <font color="#000000">The Neophyte Grade and the 1st, 2nd, 
   3rd and 4th Grades, which this present Isis Urania Temple is authorized to confer 
   after due examination and approval, posses rituals and secrets which have been 
   received from the G.H. Chief adepts and these are placed in our hands to use 
   in the tuition of pupils in the ancient methods of this Order. This Temple (Isis 
   Urania) was consecrated as a successor to Hermanubis No. 2 which had ceased 
   to exist owing to the death of all its Chiefs.</font> </p>
 <p align="Justify"> <font color="#000000">The Temple No. 1 of Licht, Liebe, Libra 
   is a group of Continental mystics who have not been in the habit of performing 
   ceremonies in open lodge, but have conferred the grades chiefly in privacy and 
   in the presence of two or three members, so there is no accurate record of name 
   and rank of all these members. Soon after the formation of Temple No. 3, permission 
   was granted for the consecration of Osiris Temple No. 4 at Weston-Super-Mare 
   under rule of V.H. Frater "Crux dat Salubrem" and the West of England 
   has been assigned to him as a province. Almost at the same time, the Horus Temple 
   No. 5 under the rule of V.H. Fratre "Vote Vita Mea" was also consecrated 
   at Bredford in Yorkshire. These three Temples have members also in the United 
   States, Hindustan, Palestine, Denmark, etc.</font> </p>
 <p align="Justify"> <font color="#000000">The name of the Order in various languages 
   is:</font> </p>
 <p align="Justify"> <font color="#000000">In Hebrew: Morning Light Shining Society 
   (Chabrath (or Chaorah) Zoreh Aour Bakker) which means The Society of the Shining 
   Light of Dawn.</font> </p>
 <p align="Justify"> <font color="#000000">In Latin: Aurora. In German: Die Goldene 
   Demmerung. In French: L'Aube d' OrÆ.</font> </p>
 <p align="Justify"> <font color="#000000">Reference may now be made to the Society 
   which was reconstructed by Robert Wentworth Little, student of the mysteries. 
   This Society, which has branches in England, Scotland and the United States, 
   is allied with the G.D. It perpetuated one form of Rosicrucian initiation which 
   was conferred 100 years ago in England and which was mentioned by Godfrey Higgins 
   in his work The Anacalypsis, or an Attempt to Withdraw the Veil of the Saitic 
   Isis. Fratre Little was a student of the school of Levi and also an eminent 
   Freemason, and the Rosicrucian Society as revised by him was made by intention 
   and permission essentially masonic, thus severing all connection with those 
   Adepts who have not been Craftsmen, as Basil Valentine, Artephus, Nicolas Flamel, 
   Jacob Behmen and Robert Fludd. The Rosicrucian Society in the same manner fails 
   to recognize any worth for occult research in women. This is also an innovation 
   or the scheme of the Ancient Mysteries in many of which, notably those of Isis 
   priestesses and virgin prophetesses, were prominent ministers.</font> </p>
 <p align="Justify"> <font color="#000000">Note specifically, that there are several 
   instances in the ancient M.S. of our Order, which are written in cypher, where 
   reference is made to the fratres and sorores, the words "her or him" 
   occur showing that in olden time, as at the present day, women rose to high 
   rank and attainment in the secret knowledge of the Order. Mention may be suitably 
   made to Pernelle, the wife and fellow-worker of Nicolas Flamel, of Martine Berthereau, 
   companion of Baron Jean de Chatelet who died about 1645 and of the widow lady 
   afterwards symbolized by him as Sophia (Heavenly Wisdom), fellow student and 
   inspirer of John Georg Gichtel who died about 1700. The occultists of today 
   cannot need to be reminded of the great Hermetists and Theosophists of recent 
   times: of D. Anna Kingsford, who was indeed illuminated by the Sun of Light; 
   of Madame Blavatsky, leader of the T.S. No occult student, however wide apart 
   his own favored path of wisdom, could fail to recognize in her a master mind 
   in a woman's frame.</font> </p>
 <p align="Justify"> <font color="#000000">I cannot fail to express the lament 
   which followed the passing of D. William Robert Woodman, for many years known 
   as the supreme Magus of the Society Ros. in Anglia which is exoteric in its 
   outer grades but whose concerns are regulated by an inner circle of adepti who 
   still hold the secrets of the R.:. C.:. and its masonic society.</font> </p>
 <p align="Justify"> <font color="#000000">The eastern school of Theosophy and 
   Occultism and our own Hermetic Society of the G.D. are fraternities of students 
   whose predecessors must have come from the same stock of magi as the scientific 
   priests of a remote antiquity. The two Societies, different in modes of teaching 
   and in language, are allied by mutual understanding and respect, and their aim 
   is similar. Be assured that the Order of the G.D. can show the way to much secret 
   knowledge and spiritual progress and lead true and patient students who can 
   Will, Dare, Learn and Be Silent to the Summum Bonum, True Wisdom, and Perfect 
   Happiness.</font> </p>
