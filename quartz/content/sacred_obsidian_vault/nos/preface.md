 Preface by M. Nostradamus to His Prophecies 
 </p><p>
 Greetings and happiness to Cesar Nostradamus my son. Your late arrival, 
 Cesar Nostredame, my son, has made me spend much time in constant nightly 
 reflection so that I could communicate with you by letter and leave you this 
 reminder, after my death, for the benefit of all men, of which the divine 
 spirit has vouchsafed me to know by means of astronomy. And since it was the 
 Almighty's will that you were not born here in this region and I do not want 
 to talk of years to come but of the months during which you will struggle to 
 grasp and understand the work I shall be compelled to leave you after my 
 death: assuming that it will not be possible for me to leave you such writing 
 as may be destroyed through the injustice of the age. The key to the hidden 
 prediction which you will inherit will be locked inside my heart. 
 </p><p>
 Also bear in mind that the events here described have not yet come to pass, 
 and that all is ruled and governed by the power of Almighty God, inspiring us 
 not by bacchic frenzy nor by enchantments but by astronomical assurances: 
 predictions have been made through the inspiration of divine will alone 
 and the spirit of prophecy in particular. 
 </p><p>
 On numerous occasions and over a long period of time I have predicted 
 specific events far in advance, attributing all to the workings of divine 
 power and inspiration, together with other fortunate or unfortunate 
 happenings, foreseen in their full unexpectedness, which have already come to 
 pass in various regions of the earth. Yet I have wished to remain silent and 
 abandon my work because of the injustice not only of the present time but 
 also for most of the future. I will not commit to writing. 
 </p><p>
 Since governments, sects and countries will undergo such sweeping changes, 
 diametrically opposed to what now obtains, that were I to relate events to 
 come, those in power now - monarchs, leaders of sects and religions - would 
 find these so different from their own imaginings that they would be led to 
 condemn what later centuries will learn how to see and understand. Bear in 
 mind also Our Saviour's words: "Do not give anything holy to the dogs, nor 
 throw pearls in front of swine lest they trample them with their feet and 
 turn on you and tear you apart." For this reason I withdrew my pen from the 
 paper, because I wished to amplify my statement touching the Vulgar Advent by 
 means of ambiguous and enigmatic comments about future causes, even those 
 closest to us and those I have perceived, so that some human change which may 
 come to pass shall not unduly scandalize delicate sensibilities. The whole 
 work is thus written in a nebulous rather than plainly prophetic form. 
 So much so that, "You have hidden these things from the wise and the 
 circumspect, that is from the mighty and the rulers, and you have purified 
 those things for the small and the poor," and through Almighty God's will, 
 revealed unto those prophets with the power to perceive what is distant and 
 thereby to foretell things to come. For nothing can be accomplished without 
 this faculty, whose power and goodness work so strongly in those to whom 
 it is given that, while they contemplate within themselves, these powers are 
 subject to other influences arising from the force of good. This warmth and 
 strength of prophecy invests us with its influence as the sun's rays affect 
 both animate and inanimate entities. 
 </p><p>
 We human beings cannot through our natural consciousness and intelligence 
 know anything of God the Creator's hidden secrets,  For it is not for us to 
 know the times or the instants, etc.  
 </p><p>
 So much so that persons of future times may be seen in present ones, because 
 God Almighty has wished to reveal them by means of images, together with 
 various secrets of the future vouchsafed to orthodox astrology, as was the 
 case in the past, so that a measure of power and divination passed through 
 them, the flame of the spirit inspiring them to pronounce upon inspiration 
 both human and divine. God may bring into being divine works, which are 
 absolute; there is another level, that of angelic works; and a third way, 
 that of the evildoers. 
 </p><p>
 But my son, I address you here a little too obscurely. As regards the occult 
 prophecies one is vouchsafed through the subtle spirit of fire, which the 
 understanding sometimes stirs through contemplation of the distant stars as 
 if in vigil, likewise by means of pronouncements, one finds oneself surprised 
 at producing writings without fear of being stricken for such impudent 
 loquacity. The reason is that all this proceeds from the divine power of 
 Almighty God from whom all bounty proceeds. 
 </p><p>
 And so once again, my son, if I have eschewed the word prophet, I do not wish 
 to attribute to myself such lofty title at the present time, for whoever is 
 called a prophet now was once called a seer; since a prophet, my son, is 
 properly speaking one who sees distant things through a natural knowledge of 
 all creatures. And it can happen that the prophet bringing about the perfect 
 light of prophecy may make manifest things both human and divine, because 
 this cannot be done otherwise, given that the effects of predicting the 
 future extend far off into time. 
 </p><p>
 God's mysteries are incomprehensible and the power to influence events is 
 bound up with the great expanse of natural knowledge, having its nearest most 
 immediate origin in free will and describing future events which cannot be 
 understood simply through being revealed. Neither can they be grasped through 
 men's interpretations nor through another mode of cognizance or occult power 
 under the firmament, neither in the present nor in the total eternity to come 
 But bringing about such an indivisible eternity through Herculean efforts, 
 things are revealed by the planetary movements. 
 </p><p>
 I am not saying, my son - mark me well, here - that knowledge of such things 
 cannot be implanted in your deficient mind, or that events in the distant 
 future may not be within the understanding of any reasoning being. 
 Nevertheless, if these things current or distant are brought to the awareness 
 of this reasoning and intelligent being they will be neither too obscure nor 
 too clearly revealed. 
 </p><p>
 Perfect knowledge of such things cannot be acquired without divine 
 inspiration, given that all prophetic inspiration derives its initial origin 
 from God Almighty, then from chance and nature. Since all these portents are 
 produced impartially, prophecy comes to pass partly as predicted. For 
 understanding created by the intellect cannot be acquired by means of the 
 occult, only by the aid of the zodiac, bringing forth that small flame by 
 whose light part of the future may be discerned. 
 </p><p>
 Also, my son, I beseech you not to exercise your mind upon such reveries and 
 vanities as drain the body and incur the soul's perdition, and which trouble 
 our feeble frames. Above all avoid the vanity of that most execrable magic 
 formerly reproved by the Holy Scriptures - only excepting the use of official 
 astrology. 
 </p><p>
 For by the latter, with the help of inspiration and divine revelation, and 
 continual calculations, I have set down my prophecies in writing. Fearing 
 lest this occult philosophy be condemned, I did not therefore wish to make 
 known its dire import; also fearful that several books which had lain hidden 
 for long centuries might be discovered, and of what might become of them, 
 after reading them I presented them to Vulcan. And while he devoured them, 
 the flame licking the air gave out such an unexpected light, clearer than 
 that of an ordinary flame and resembling fire from some flashing cataclysm, 
 and suddenly illumined the house as if it were caught in a furnace. Which is 
 why I reduced them to ashes then, so that none might be tempted to use occult 
 labours in searching for the perfect transmutation, whether lunar or solar, 
 of incorruptible metals. 
 </p><p>
 But as to that discernment which can be achieved by the aid of planetary 
 scrutiny, I should like to tell you this. Eschewing any fantastic imaginings, 
 you may through good judgement have insight into the future if you keep to 
 the specific names of places that accord with planetary configurations, and 
 with inspiration places and aspects yield up hidden properties, namely that 
 power in whose presence the three times are understood as Eternity whose 
 unfolding contains them all: for all things are naked and open.  
 </p><p>
 That is why, my son, you can easily, despite your young brain, understand 
 that events can be foretold naturally by the heavenly bodies and by the 
 spirit of prophecy: I do not wish to ascribe to myself the title and role of 
 prophet, but emphasize inspiration revealed to a mortal man whose perception 
 is no further from heaven than the feet are from the earth.  I cannot fail, 
 err or be deceived, although I may be as great a sinner as anyone else upon 
 this earth and subject to all human afflictions. 
 </p><p>
 But after being surprised sometimes by day while in a trance, and having long 
 fallen into the habit of agreeable nocturnal studies, I have composed books 
 of prophecies, each containing one hundred astronomical quatrains, which I 
 want to condense somewhat obscurely. The work comprises prophecies from today 
 to the year 3797. 
 </p><p>
 This may perturb some, when they see such a long timespan, and this will 
 occur and be understood in all the fullness of the Republic; these things 
 will be universally understood upon earth, my son. If you live the normal 
 lifetime of man you will know upon your own soil, under your native sky, 
 how future events are to turn out.  
 </p><p>
 For only Eternal God knows the eternity of His light which proceeds from Him, 
 and I speak frankly to those to whom His immeasurable, immense and 
 incomprehensible greatness has been disposed to grant revelations through 
 long, melancholy inspiration, that with the aid of this hidden element 
 manifested by God, there are two principal factors which make up the 
 prophet's intelligence.  
 </p><p>
 The first is when the supernatural light fills and illuminates the person who 
 predicts by astral science, while the second allows him to prophesy through 
 inspired revelation, which is only a part of the divine eternity, whereby the 
 prophet comes to assess what his divinatory power has given him through the 
 grace of God and by a natural gift, namely, that what is foretold is true and 
 ethereal in origin.  
 </p><p>
 And such a light and small flame is of great efficacy and scope, and nothing 
 less than the clarity of nature itself. The light of human nature makes the 
 philosophers so sure of themselves that with the principles of the first 
 cause they reach the loftiest doctrines and the deepest abysses. 
 </p><p>
 But my son, lest I venture too far for your future perception, be aware that 
 men of letters shall make grand and usually boastful claims about the way I 
 interpreted the world, before the worldwide conflagration which is to bring 
 so many catastrophes and such revolutions that scarcely any lands will not be 
 covered by water, and this will last until all has perished save history 
 and geography themselves. This is why, before and after these revolutions in 
 various countries, the rains will be so diminished and such abundance of fire 
 and fiery missiles shall fall from the heavens that nothing shall escape the 
 holocaust. And this will occur before the last conflagration.  
 </p><p>
 For before war ends the century and in its final stages it will hold the 
 century under its sway. Some countries will be in the grip of revolution for 
 several years, and others ruined for a still longer period. And now that we 
 are in a republican era, with Almighty God's aid, and before completing its 
 full cycle, the monarchy will return, then the Golden Age. For according to 
 the celestial signs, the Golden Age shall return, and after all calculations, 
 with the world near to an all-encompassing revolution - from the time of 
 writing 177 years 3 months 11 days - plague, long famine and wars, and still 
 more floods from now until the stated time. Before and after these, humanity 
 shall several times be so severely diminished that scarcely anyone shall be 
 found who wishes to take over the fields, which shall become free where they 
 had previously been tied.  
 </p><p>
 This will be after the visible judgement of heaven, before we reach the 
 millennium which shall complete all. In the firmament of the eighth sphere, 
 a dimension whereon Almighty God will complete the revolution, and where the 
 constellations will resume their motion which will render the earth stable 
 and firm, but only if He will remain unchanged for ever until His will be 
 done.  
 </p><p>
 This is in spite of all the ambiguous opinions surpassing all natural reason, 
 expressed by Mahomet; which is why God the Creator, through the ministry of  
 his fiery agents with their flames, will come to propose to our perceptions  
 as well as our eyes the reasons for future predictions.  
 </p><p>
 Signs of events to come must be manifested to whomever prophesies. For  
 prophecy which stems from exterior illumination is part of that light and  
 seeks to ally with it and bring it into being so that the part which seems to 
 possess the faculty of understanding is not subject to a sickness of the mind.  
 </p><p>
 Reason is only too evident. Everything is predicted by divine afflatus and  
 thanks to an angelic spirit inspiring the one prophesying, consecrating his  
 predictions through divine unction. It also divests him of all fantasies by  
 means of various nocturnal apparitions, while with daily certainty he  
 prophesies through the science of astronomy, with the aid of sacred prophecy,  
 his only consideration being his courage in freedom.  
 </p><p>
 So come, my son, strive to understand what I have found out through my  
 calculations which accord with revealed inspiration, because now the sword  
 of death approaches us, with pestilence and war more horrible than there has  
 ever been - because of three men's work - and famine. And this sword shall  
 smite the earth and return to it often, for the stars confirm this upheaval  
 and it is also written: "I shall punish their injustices with iron rods, and  
 shall strike them with blows." 
 </p><p>
 For God's mercy will be poured forth only for a certain time, my son, 
 until the majority of my prophecies are fulfilled and this fulfillment is  
 complete. Then several times in the course of the doleful tempests the Lord  
 shall say: Therefore I shall crush and destroy and show no mercy; and many  
 other circumstances shall result from floods and continual rain of which I  
 have written more fully in my other prophecies, composed at some length, not  
 in a chronological sequence, in prose, limiting the places and times and  
 exact dates so that future generations will see, while experiencing these  
 inevitable events, how I have listed others in clearer language, so that  
 despite their obscurities these things shall be understood: When the time  
 comes for the removal of ignorance, the matter will be clearer still.  
 </p><p>
 So in conclusion, my son, take this gift from your father M. Nostradamus,  
 who hopes you will understand each prophecy in every quatrain herein. May  
 Immortal God grant you a long life of good and prosperous happiness.
