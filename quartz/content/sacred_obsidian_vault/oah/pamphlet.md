 THE ORIGIN OF OAHSPE
 
 In view of the numerous enquiries which reach the
 Kosmon Press regarding the origin of OAHSPE the following
 brief account of how the work came to be written and published
 is offered to the public.
 
 The teachings contained in the volume were communicated
 from the interior planes through an American medium,
 J. B. Newbrough (1828-1891). From the testimony of those
 who knew him while on earth he appears to have been a man
 of exceptional moral character who possessed also the most
 remarkable powers in the direction of inspiration and clairvoyance.
 The exercise of these faculties over many years culminated
 in 1881 in his becoming the instrument through
 which OAHSPE was communicated to the world.   Fortunately
 enough in a letter addressed to The Banner of Light,
 Boston, in 1883 he himself has given a detailed account of
 the origin of the book so that it will be sufficient here to
 reproduce his original words :-
 
 
 New York.
 January 21st, 1883.
 
 To the Editor of
 The Banner of Light,
 Boston, Mass.
 
 Dear Sir,
 
 In compliance with your request that I furnish for publication a
 brief article in regard to the writing of Oahspe, the new bible, I
 cheerfully proceed to do so.
 
 You have observed, no doubt, that in Oahspe no mention is made
 of the manner in which the book was written, nor by whom. Well,
 was it not plain to anybody acquainted with such matters, that any
 statement on my part would not be believed by persons unacquainted
 with spiritual manifestations? And had I said that I myself wrote it,
 my own acquaintances would have known better. Had I said that the
 angels wrote it through my hands, then I would have been denounced
 as a pretender. Again, if a book have merit, what matters it as to
 who wrote it? And if it have no merit, then certainly it does not
 matter whence it came.   The time has been when the name of an
 author clothed his product with some sort of authority. I rejoice that
 that day is past; that man-worship is at an end, and that all books,
 including Bibles, are perused not as authorities, but as pastimes, to lead
 us nearer and nearer to the Everlasting Light. And if a man turn out
 a good book, I accord him little more credit than I would a ripe apple
 for being on the sunny side of the tree.   But I rejoice most of all
 because our Heavenly Father, through his angels co-operating with our
 forefathers, provided us a government that protects us in publishing
 our highest conceptions, regardless of creeds or dogmas. Why, to-day
 we have Protestant preachers in their pulpits denying the inspiration
 of the Old and New Testaments, and only in the slightest possible
 degree less than Thomas Paine. They begin to judge so-called sacred
 books according to what they are, and not by a supposed authority.
 This is progress, undoubtedly.
 
 On reflecting on these things, it was concluded to publish the first
 edition of Oahspe without any reference to its authorship. No attempt
 has been made to conceal the method in which, it was written, but most
 of the particulars have been told from time to time to inquiring friends.
 
 Briefly, then, Oahspe was mechanically written through my hands
 by some other intelligence than my own.   Many spiritualists are
 acquainted with this automatic movement of the hands, independent of
 one's volition. There are thousands and thousands of persons who
 have this quality. It can also be educated, or rather, the susceptibility
 to external power can be increased. In my own case I discovered,
 many years ago, in sitting in circles to obtain spiritual manifestations,
 that my hands could not lie on the table without flying off into these
 "tantrums." Often they would write messages, left or right, back-
 ward or forward, nor could I control them in any other way than by
 withdrawing from the table. Sometimes the power thus baffled would
 attack my tongue, or my eyes, or my ears, and I talked and saw and
 heard differently from my normal state.   Then I went to work in
 earnest to investigate spiritualism, and I investigated over two hundred
 mediums, travelling hundreds and hundreds of miles for this purpose.
 Often I took them to my own house and experimented with them to
 my heart's content. I found that nearly all of them were subject to this
 involuntary movement of the hands, or to entrancement. They told me
 it was angels controlling them. In course of time, about ten or fifteen            
 years, I began to believe in spiritualism. But I was not satisfied with            
 the communications; I was craving for the light of heaven. I did not            
 desire communications from friends or relatives, or information about           
 earthly things; I wished to learn something about the spirit-world;            
 what the angels did, how they travelled, and the general plan of the            
 universe. So, after awhile I took it into my head that wise and exalted
 angels would commune better with us if we purified ourselves physically
 and spiritually. Then I gave up eating flesh and fish, milk and butter,
 and took to rising before day, bathing twice a day, and occupying a
 small room alone, where I sat every morning half-an-hour before sunrise,
 recounting daily to my Creator my shortcomings in governing
 myself in thought and deed. In six years' training I reduced myself
 from two hundred and fifty pounds down to one hundred and eighty;
 my rheumatism was all gone, and I had no more headaches. I became
 limber and sprightly. A new lease of life came to me.
 
 Then a new condition of control came upon my hands; instead of
 the angels holding my hands as formerly, they held their hands over my
 head (and they were clothed with sufficient materiality for me to see
 them) and a light fell upon my hands as they lay on the table. In the
 meantime I had attained to hear audible angel voices near me. I was
 directed to get a typewriter, which writes by keys, like a piano. This I
 did, and I applied myself industriously to learn 'it, but with only indifferent
 success.   For two years more the angels propounded to me
 questions relative to heaven and earth, which no mortal could answer
 very intelligently. I always look back on those two years as an enigma.
 Perhaps it was to show me that man is but an ignoramus at best; perhaps
 I was waiting for constitutional growth to be good. Well, one morning
 the light struck both my hands on the back, and they went for the typewriter,
 for some fifteen minutes, very vigorously. I was told not to
 read what was printed, and I had worked myself into such a religious
 fear of losing this new power that I obeyed reverently. The next
 morning, also before sunrise, the same power came and wrote (or
 printed rather) again. Again I laid the matter away very religiously,
 saying little about it to anybody. One morning I accidentally (seemed
 accidental to me) looked out of the window and beheld the line of light
 that rested on my hands extending heavenward like a. telegraph wire
 towards the sky.   Over my head were three pairs of hands, fully
 materialised; behind me stood another angel, with her hands on my
 shoulders. My looking did not disturb the scene; my hands kept right
 on, printing . . . printing.
 
 For fifty weeks this continued, every morning half-an-hour or so
 before sunrise, and then it ceased, and I was told to read and publish
 the book Oahspe. The peculiar drawings in Oahspe were made with
 pencil in the same way. A few of the drawings I was told to copy
 from other books, such as Saturn, the Egyptian ceremonies, etc.
 
 Now during all the while I have pursued my vocation (dentistry)
 nor has this matter nor my diet (vegetables, fruit and farinaceous food)
 detracted any from my health or strength, although I have continued
 this discipline for upwards of ten or more years. I am firmly convinced
 that there are numberless persons who might attain to marvellous
 development if they would thus train themselves.
 A strict integrity to one's highest light is essential to development.
 Self-abnegation and purity should be the motto and discipline of every
 one capable of angel communion.
 
 Yours truly,
 J. B. NEWBROUGH.
 
 
 Newbrough immediately printed and published the
 manuscript, the first edition of the work, a folio, being issued
 in New York and London in 1882.   A second edition, a
 quarto, and cheaper in price, was published in Boston and
 London in 1891. This contained in addition, a series of
 reproductions of paintings of great spiritual teachers made by
 the author when in the trance state. They were not, however,
 an integral part of the original work.
 
 Half a century later in 1936 the Kosmon Press in California
 acquired a number of sheets of this imprint (including
 two important pages which for some reason were not included
 therein) and issued a new edition, which is now obtainable
 in America and England.
 
 The first cheap edition was one which was printed
 privately in England in 1912, but which is now no longer in
 circulation.   It may be identified through the fact that the
 plates are all bound together at the end of the volume.
 
 Almost at the same time there appeared the first English
 edition (also at a low price) issued by the Kosmon Press in
 London. A revised edition was published in London, Sydney
 and Melbourne in 1926.
 
 As to the original manuscript of OAHSPE, from which
 all these editions ultimately take their authority, for some time
 after Newbrough's death this was kept in the basement of a
 house in El Paso, Texas, until it was ultimately destroyed by
 a flood. Although this happening may appear to be unfortunate
 from the point of view of the scholar and the archaeologist
 it is clear also that there was thereby avoided all danger that
 authority should come to be vested in a historical document
 rather than in that interior light of the soul in which OAHSPE
 itself teaches man to place his trust.
 
 It appears, however, that the destruction) of the manuscript
 took place only when its correspondence with the printed
 version had already been carefully established. In the Preface
 to the second edition it is stated that although certain errors
 had crept into the first edition they had been thoroughly
 eliminated by comparison with the original, which was then
 (1891) still in existence. As Newbrough died the same year
 in April it is just possible that he himself was able to undertake
 the task before he passed over.
 
 With regard to the contents of this extraordinary book,
 it will suffice here to say that it contains detailed teachings
 regarding the Creator and His relation to Man and the
 Universe; the history of the earth and its heavens for the past
 24,000 years; the principles of cosmogony and cosmology,
 embracing a completely revolutionary conception of physics;
 the nature of the angelic worlds and their relation to the earth;
 the origin of man and his path onwards and upwards during
 life and after death towards spiritual emancipation; the principles
 of an enlightened morality; the lost keys to all the
 different religious doctrines and symbols in the world; the
 history of the great teachers who have been sent to humanity
 in different cycles; the character of the civilisation which will
 supersede that in which we are at present living; and a mass
 of remarkable teachings regarding metaphysics, rites and ceremonies,
 magic, prophecy and the like.
 
 Like all Bibles OAHSPE is so conceived that it can
 profitably be read on every level. The simple may find set
 forth therein that which they need to know, while the philosopher,
 the mystic and the esotericist will never exhaust the
 profundity of its more recondite pages.
