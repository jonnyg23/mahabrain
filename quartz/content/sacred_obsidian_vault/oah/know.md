 <h1 align="CENTER">Book of Knowledge</h1>
 <p>[This book (and the following <i>Book of Ouranothen</i>) was not part of the 1882 or 1891 published versions but was found later as fragments of original proof sheets. It may have been a part of the <i>Book of Ben.</i></p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter I</h3>
 <p>1. Jehovih spake through His sons and daughters. His voice came up out of the marsh and down from the heavens above, and the children of men heard and saw, and raised up because of the spirit in them. And they answered to Him, Who is Almighty; and their voices were called Tae, because as it is the universal word of all children born, so doth it represent the universal prayer of man.</p>
 <p>2. Tae said: Reveal, O Father, give me light! I behold the wide earth, the sun, moon and stars. But the great vault of heaven is as an empty sky. Where is the abode of the dead; the place of the souls of men?</p>
 <p>3. In times past Thou hast quickened seers and prophets, and through them lifted up Thy children and proclaimed other worlds! Am I more dumb than those in past ages? All the while myself and forefathers have withstood Thy mighty Presence.</p>
 <p>4. Thou hast quickened my members by thine own hand, to be dissatisfied by the old revelations, and made me to peer deeper into the cause and place of things, and to desire further light from Thy holy places.</p>
 <p>5. By Thy Power hath my manhood been raised up. By Thy Power and Wisdom only will I be appeased.</p>
 <p>6. When I was a child I believed as a child, because it was told me; but now that I am grown up, I would know who Thy prophets were, and how they attained their gifts, and wisdom of words.</p>
 <p>7. The cosmogony Thou taughtest in the olden time was sufficient for that day; but I am raised up by Thee to perceive the sun and stars of other worlds, and their travel in Thy great firmament. Now, I cry out unto Thee, where is the promised heaven? Where is the proof of immortal life? By Thee was I quickened into life and made conscious that I am. To Thee I come in the majesty Thou madest me, Thou my Father! By Thee was I made determined to sift all things to the bottom. In Thee do I know there is magnitude to encompass all my holy desires, and answer me.</p>
 <p>8. Give me of Thy Light! When I was a child I besought Thee as a child; now, I call out in the manhood Thou hast bestowed upon me! I will know Thy Lords, Thy Gods, and Thy Saviors, and Thy promised heaven.</p>
 <p>9. I have scaled the mountain; Thy myriads of corporeal worlds that travel in the eternal sea of space! I have beholden that all the stars in heaven would not fill the hollow of Thy Hand; yea, that Thy breath moveth the universe! The glory of Thy works hath inspired me with madness to come to Thy Mighty Home!</p>
 <p>10. Speak, O Jehovih! Thou alone canst assuage this soaring spirit that sprang forth from Thee, inspired. Give me light!</p>
 <p>11. I have encompassed the earth around, and bridged the nations thereof with assimilative words. My geography is finished. Give me a book of heaven! I have burrowed deep in corporeal knowledge, and seen the drift of all on earth. Where is the spirit world, and land of the dead? Give me light!</p>
 <p>12. Kosmon said: Jehovih heard the voice of Tae, and answered him. He said: Let the angels of heaven go down to the earth. My blessed son called to me in wisdom and truth. And the angels of heaven descended to the earth, for it was in the time of danha in the firmament of heaven, and the angels manifested and proved the immortal life of men.</p>
 <p>13. Jehovih said: Let this day be the beginning of the reign of Kosmon; for it is the beginning of the wisdom of the earth, being cojoined in My Name.</p>
 <p>14. Tae said: The half is not yet answered, O my Father in heaven. Since Thou hast proved the immortal life, Thou hast stirred me to my soul's foundation. Whence come these inhabitants of the unseen world? Where lieth this footstool for Thy Majesty?</p>
 <p>15. If when I am dead I shall see the place, is not the germ of that sight already in me? How am I made that I see, but see not this? Hear, but hear not this? If I am now dead to that which is to be, will I not then be dead to what is not? Give me light, O Father!</p>
 <p>16. Jehovih said: Man I gave a corporeal body that he might learn corporeal things; but death I made that he might rise in spirit and inhabit My etherean worlds.</p>
 <p>17. Two senses gave I to all men, corporeal and spiritual senses; nevertheless the twain are one person. A man with corporeal senses in the ascendancy, chooseth corporeal things; a man with spiritual senses chooseth spiritual things.</p>
 <p>18. Two kinds of worlds have I made, corporeal and es worlds. He who desireth corpor shall receive from corpor, for he is My son, in whom I am well pleased. He who desireth from es shall receive from es, for she is my daughter in whom I am well pleased.</p>
 <p>19. Kosmon said: Because man liveth on corporeal worlds, corpor is called son; but because man in spirit liveth in the es world, es is called daughter.</p>
 <p>20. Tae said: Because Thou hast sent angels to me, and I have seen them, and talked to them face to face; yea, of my own flesh and kin, and proved them to be the spirits of the dead, verily, I know this much is true. Yet I cannot see them nor hear them, save they manifest through corporeal things. How, then, shall I know that they know one another?</p>
 <p>21. Hear me, O Jehovih! Am I still a child, and must needs fall back on angels' testimony? Hast thou not given me an inquiring spirit that I must prove things to mine own knowledge? Verily, have I seen an angel's face and stature change to look like another person, even whilst I talked therewith. If these things are thus so subtle, cannot even our own presence mold them to truth or falsehood? Such a witness is of no value. When then, O Jehovih, shall I find growth for mine own members, that I may know the es worlds and the inhabitants thereof? I will not be appeased by merely seeing the spirits of the dead, nor by their testimony. They may call themselves God, Christ, Buddha, Brahma or Confucius, yet I will not rest on them for their word. To Thee, only, O Jehovih, will I put forth my plea. I am Thy son.</p>
 <p>22. Thou hast quickened me to know things of my own knowledge; and though it be told me: Thus said the Lord or thy God ..., yet will I raise my voice ever above them, and though a spirit say: I am thy Jehovih, believe thou me! I will deny him.</p>
 <p>23. Thou hast quickened me to rise up above the tales of the ancients, and to demand knowledge from Thy throne. By Thee is my soul moved to this magnificence, and only Thy magnificence can satisfy Thy son.</p>
 <p>24. Since I have seen the spirits of the dead, I will know their abiding place, how they live, how they travel, their manner of growth, their food and clothes, and how they spend heir time; whether they labor or live idly, and above all how far, and in what manner their corporeal lives had to bear on their spiritual happiness in heaven.</p>
 <p>25. Give me light, O Jehovih! Not by word of mouth. I will have my members quickened that I shall comprehend within myself. Yet not one alone! Rather waste me in annihilation than not to give it unto all men or teach the way. For if one alone, he would become a god amongst men. Jehovih, forbid this!</p>
 <p>26. Jehovih spake, through His sons and daughters, and each of them gave voice to the Spirit of the Creator's Voice in turn.</p>
 <p>27. Kosmon said: Hear me, O man, I will speak in wisdom. Follow thou my counsel and be wise. What, then, hast thou learned in all the time of earth? Canst thou tell why the grass is green, or why one rose is red and another white, or the mountains raised up, or the valleys sunken low?</p>
 <p>28. Knowest thou how all the people of earth clothe themselves, or travel over; why a man was not to fly as a bird, or live in the water like a fish? Whence came the thought of shame? Even thyself thou dost not comprehend, nor know of thine own knowledge the time of thy beginning. Thou knowest three times three are nine; and even this thou canst not prove but by symbols and images. Nor is there aught in thy corporeal knowledge that thou canst prove otherwise, save it be thy presence; and even that that thou seest is not thy presence, but the symbol and image of it, for thyself art but as a seed, a germ of the Father.</p>
 <p>29. Be wise, therefore, in knowing thine own knowledge, and of a surety right the matter from the side of the es world.</p>
 <p>30. Tae said: I will reason with Thee, Jehovih, for all I know shall be based on science and truth. From Thine own perfection am I inspired to this end, and my talents shall be strengthened by pursuing the exact sciences of all the known truths. neither will I put away mine own judgment, nor accept for truth that which is at variance with Thy established laws.</p>
 <p>31. Thou madest both the seen and the unseen. Are they at war, or in harmony? My corporeal body is made of earth, and stone and water. Is the spiritual body, then, not made of air, oxygen and hydrogen, and imperceptible dust?</p>
 <p>32. The angels Thou hast sent have feet and legs! Wherefore? Do they walk on the air, or wade through it? They have no wings, they cannot fly; they have not seen the illustrious angels who have been long dead. Must I also go into the es world simply to meet my neighbors, and never salute the wise of olden time? Give me light O Jehovih!</p>
 <p>33. Something within me maketh me to anticipate the light and glory of what I have not seen; but I must have it tangible and demonstrated--the immaculate truth!</p>
 <p>34. Then answered Jehovih, through His daughter Esfoma.</p>
 <p>35. Esfoma said: Hear me, O Tae; I will speak words of wisdom and truth, and thou shall not depart from my word.</p>
 <p>36. Science is that which the ignorant look up to, but seeth not. Is a ship, science, or a stone arch, or a machine?   Verily not. Is the idea of these things, science? Can an idea be science, or a multitude of ideas?</p>
 <p>37. Is it not said of the man who findeth the vertebra of an insect, he is scientific? But he who findeth the backbone of a horse, is a vulgar fellow. Another man findeth a route over a mountain or through the forest, and he is scientific. Why, a dog can do this.</p>
 <p>38. Another man findeth a new way to solve problems, and he is scientific! but the pupil after him who doeth the same thing is nothing. Who, then are the scientific? For have they not all borrowed, compiled, and only added a little? Verily, then, what is science? Is not the sand-glass more scientific than a clock? What, then, meanest thou by science? Is not the sum of it all but a figurehead, undesignable and without foundation? Yet all thy life thou hast heard of science. and so have thy neighbors, and ye understand one another, though not one understandeth himself.</p>
 <p>39. Esfoma said: Hear me further, O man, for this, of all things, should stand high in thy soul. Take now, therefore, the chalk, and write thou ten for me. Tae took the chalk and wrote 10. saying, that is ten.</p>
 <p>40. Esfoma said: Now will I convict thee before thine own face, that thou hast uttered falsely. Thou hast written but two strokes, and called them ten. Esfoma wrote | | | | | | | | | |. Yet, be not surprised, O Tae, for now will I convict myself, also, inasmuch as I have deceived thee. I said I would show thee ten, and straightway, I made ten marks; wherefore I should have written the word <i>ten.</i> Now thou art wise! Nay, hear me further, for all I have spoken is false; for have I not tried to persuade thee that the one uttered word <i>ten</i>, was ten; wherefore I should have uttered ten utterances.</p>
 <p>41. Pursue thy studies, O Tae, and thou shalt find that supposed exact science is nothing, and that supposed truth is only falsehood compounded and acquiesced in. Find thou the time the sun will rise tomorrow, and thou art scientific; but deviate thou the ten thousandth part of a second, and thou art not scientific; nay thou art a falsifier before Jehovih.</p>
 <p>42. Yet be not discouraged of the exact sciences, or of finding the truth according to thy judgment. Thou art wise to desire to attain knowledge of thine own self, and not to accept, neither from man nor angels, on belief merely; but, wherein beginneth and endeth thyself?</p>
 <p>43. Hast thou not robbed the tree of its fruit in order to feed the body? And the field of its wheat, and the young corn that was growing? Give to them their parts, and what hast thou left of thy corporeal body that is thine own?</p>
 <p>44. Yet less than these hast thou of thine own judgment. Thou art but the fragment of an entity in all thou knowest of thine own judgment. Nine parts to ten are the gleanings of thy surrounding.</p>
 <p>45. Wherefore, then, shalt thou expect to know the laws of earth or heaven! Give ear to my words, and be wise in thy proceedings.</p>
 <p>46. Is it not a law of the earth that earth substance shall fall to it? Yet thou seest a tree come up out of the ground, ten thousand corporeal pounds, and stand erect in the air. Hast Jehovih made one law to pull one way, and another in another way? How knowest thou there is any law about the matter? Knowest thou of thine own knowledge?</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter II</h3>
 <p>1. Tae said: Now I do perceive, O Jehovih, I am not wise, and that of myself I am nothing - having nothing. Neither is it possible for man to discern truth in abstract, nor Thy laws, whether Thou hast laws or hast not laws. Nay, he cannot adjust the scales for his own self, and prove what part is his alone; nor in fact if he have an entity of self within himself.</p>
 <p>2. How then shall I comprehend the magnitude of the laws of Thy universe? Yet in what time of my life have I not talked learnedly of these things, and the exact science?</p>
 <p>3. Hear me, O Jehovih; I will not go back to the ancients to learn wisdom, nor will I shut up mine eyes against trying to understand. In Thee, only, have I faith. And since all other things in heaven and earth are Thine, there is none else to whom I can come justly. Give me light, O Jehovih! Thou, who gavest me myself shall answer me. What, then, is the true pursuit of man? Shall he be a beggar, and pray for light, and yet not receive it after all?</p>
 <p>4. Jehovih answered Tae through His son, Corpor, saying:</p>
 <p>5. Corpor said: Hear me, O man, for my wisdom shall be borne home to thee. Neither will I discourage thee in thy knowledge.</p>
 <p>6. Know then, thou art, and that thy body is made from the corporeal earth. Jehovih is sufficient, for Jehovih so made thee. To thee he gave the desires of the earth. Is it wise, then, to defer corporeal happiness until thou hast risen in heaven? What mattereth it to thee, whether thou art built up out of wheat and fruits or flesh? Is it not sufficient that thou canst enjoy the building thereof?</p>
 <p>7. What is science to thee? Or truth or laws of the universe? Is not thy earth life sufficient for the earth, and the earth for thee? If Jehovih made the earth in wisdom, has He not also wisely made heaven?</p>
 <p>8. Leave off these abstract studies, O man, and be contented in the place thy Father has assigned thee. Thou that talkest of science understandeth not thyself and art without explanation. Neither canst thou define truth. How, then, canst thou judge, or even know what is before thee.</p>
 <p>9. Thou talkest of laws, divine and natural, but knowest no law, no divinity, no nature. Is law a thing? Whither does it keep? Thou seeth a tree grow, but puttest Jehovih away, and sayest: Behold it groweth by natural laws! Art thou ashamed of Jehovih, that thou sayest not He groweth it? Is He not sufficient? Wherefore, then, sayest thou <i>law,</i> save but to put Him away? Wherefore sayest thou <i>nature,</i> save but to put Him away and deny His Person.</p>
 <p>10. Corpor said: Is not the earth good, that thou turnest away, calling: Heaven! Give me light from thy far off worlds! Endow me with signs, and miracles and prophecies!</p>
 <p>11. I will not discourage Thee, but thou shall not be wise and happy in thy dwelling place. Are not these greater to be desired than all things else? To this end is the Kosmon era come; not to carry man up to heaven, but to found the Father's kingdom on earth.</p>
 <p>12. Thou has wisely asked: How shall a corporean's life affect his life in the next world? Hear me, then, and be wise in thy corporeal judgment. For am not I, Corpor, Jehovih's? Science is great; great learning is great; truth is great; but a greater than all is to know how to be happy. Thou shalt not put me away saying: All the earth is sin. I will not have it. For if thou profitest not in Jehovih's Person, how canst thou attain His spirit? For are not the twain His Person and His Spirit, the All One?</p>
 <p>13. Teach thyself to be happy: and to perfect thyself in the way Jehovih hath created thee.</p>
 <p>14. Tae said: Now I will be wise in thee, O Jehovih. Neither will I more talk of nature, nor of law; but when I mean Thee, I will speak of Thee, and to Thee.</p>
 <p>15. Neither will I boast of science, nor of learning, nor of truth; nor will I deny them. For as Thy spirit is within and over all, what is science and learning, and truth but glimpses of Thy All Light?</p>
 <p>16. Yet as a man proud in his estate, I come before Thee, saying: Give me light! I have looked over the broad earth, and found it full of sin and misery, and death.</p>
 <p>17. I will not pray to Thee to remove these things. I will not meddle in Thy affairs. What more is it at best to pray than to beg? I am no beggar. As Thou goest forth, I too go forth in Thy behalf.</p>
 <p>18. If Thou hast filled this world full of darkness and death, of darkness, and sin, and misery, what more can I hope to find in heaven? By Thy Spirit, Majesty, so am I, Thy son inspired. Are they not both the work of Thy hands?</p>
 <p>19. My hope hath ever looked ahead for the achievement of happiness, but when the time cometh I am sorely tried. My judgment teachest me, therefore, that heaven can be, at most, but little improvement on earth.</p>
 <p>20. Then give me light, O Jehovih! For I would answer the children of darkness with good argument, and teach them to glorify Thee in Thy works.</p>
 <p>21. Then answered Jehovih through His son, Uz, saying:</p>
 <p>22. Uz said: Behold me in my power, O Tae. I am the fourth dimension, the vanishment of things unseen. Thou hast labored with Kosmon, but found not, and with Corpor, and found not. Hear thou me and be wise.</p>
 <p>23. This, thy corporeal body is mine; thy flesh waiteth for me, and the moment thou relinquish thy hold, I will molder thee in dust. Yet I am not thy enemy, for whilst thou art master over thy flesh, I will touch it not.</p>
 <p>24. Out of the darkness man is brought forth a blank, and his entity is a spark of Jehovih. His entity will never cease to grow. Yea, from the hour of conception it is a new star in the world, and it magnifieth itself forever.</p>
 <p>25. The trials of the flesh to man are as nutriment to his spirit's growth. And yet, think not that thou shouldst rejoice in thy neighbor's trials, saying, it is good for his spirit's growth. But as Jehovih gave all He had, and thus made all things, be thou like unto Jehovih, and give to the man in trial, lest thou robbest thyself.</p>
 <p>26. Thou knowest not how far thou hast been lifted up thyself. Can any man with his own hands lift himself up in the air? Flatter not thyself, then, that man alone can lift himself up in spirit, or that he hath power to evolve himself, one generation above another. Do not all nations perish? As they come up out of darkness, do they not go down in darkness?</p>
 <p>27. Is it not unwise to say: O Jehovih, why didst Thou thus, or not thus? All thy questionings will not turn Jehovih or His plans one jot or tittle. Turn thine eyes inward, then, O Tae, and seek to adapt thyself to the Father and His kingdoms, of which this earth is one.</p>
 <p>28. Tae said: How can I comprehend Thy wisdom, O my Father in heaven? I am tripped up at every corner; and yet I perceive that my generation is wiser than the ancients. Wherefore, then, didst Thou stir me up? The ancients found joy in an idol; were content to eat and sleep, their faith being equal to their wisdom.</p>
 <p>29. But these that came after, cried out unto Thee for wisdom, and Thou gavest. Thus am I born above the faith of the ancients. I have grown beyond the measures of Thy olden revelations; my soul crieth out to Thee for more light.</p>
 <p>30. I know that Thou hast sufficiency for all things. Give me wisdom, that I may help myself. Had I been born in darkness, the idols of my forefathers would have sufficed.</p>
 <p>31. Hear me, O Jehovih, in what I have done. I have measured the earth and high standing rocks, and the mountains Thou reardest up, and the valleys Thou has scooped out. Thy footstool hast shown me a record not written by man, and it proclaimeth the earth millions of years old.</p>
 <p>32. Yea, I have measured the stars in Thy firmament, and the sun and moon, and weighed them, and they proclaimed a greater glory unto Thee. Their number is more than there are drops of water in the ocean; and many of them a thousand times larger than the earth. I have found them rich in air, and water, and heat and cold, and they proclaim themselves birth places for men, even as is the earth.</p>
 <p>33. I have measured the light and computed the time of its coming, and lo, they also have existed for millions of years.</p>
 <p>34. Wherein have I done wrong in this? Thou gavest me my talents, and Thou hast forever pressed me forward to search Thy glorious works.</p>
 <p>35. A man cannot make himself a small child, neither can I compress my outbursting soul, which hath ripened on the magnitude and glory of Thy works.</p>
 <p>36. How, then, shall I say that Thy worlds, which have run millions of years, were created by man born two thousand years ago! Must I stop myself to blaspheme against Thee for sake of swallowing the idols of men in darkness? Forbid Thou this, O Jehovih.</p>
 <p>37. Now will I put my question to Thee plainly, and Thy voice shall not fail me. Wherefore, then, did not Thy angels of olden time reveal to man the truth about Thy works? Or if they revealed the truth, why permittedst Thou man to lose the truth? Give me light, O Jehovih!</p>
 <p>38. Thou madest me! Thou art my Father; and I come to Thee in majesty, by the power Thou gavest me. None shall stand betwixt me and Thee; neither Thy Lords nor Thy angels from heaven, nor any man that is on the earth. I will know why Thou permittedst idols of stone and wood and graven images? Yea, I will know why man buildeth an idol on earth or imagineth one in heaven? I know Thou art sufficient unto the worship of all men. Wherefore, then, have men set up Zarathustra, and Brahma, and Buddha, and Christ, and the prophets of old? For, for these idols have they cursed the whole earth around about with war and destruction. Give me light, O Jehovih!</p>
 <p>39. Jehovih heard the voice of Tae, and He answered him through His son, Seffas.</p>
 <p>40. Seffas said: Hear me, O man, and be wise, for I will answer thee because of the justness of thy questions. Yea, I will answer thee, and also put thee in the way to prove all things to thine own judgment.</p>
 <p>41. But be thou not puffed up with conceit; thou art little in advance of the ancients. They erected pyramids, and obelisks, and great temples, and they said: Behold, how greater and wiser we are than the ancients!</p>
 <p>42. Thou also hast boasted, saying: Behold our ships of war! Behold our engines and railroads, and the telegraphs. How greater and wiser are we than the ancients!</p>
 <p>43. I charge thee! The pyramids and temples did not raise up the poor, and cause them to glorify the Father because they were born into life. Neither do the warships in this day, nor the engines, nor railroads contribute but little to raise man up out of sorrow and poverty. Is not this the true scale to weigh the resurrection of men and nations?</p>
 <p>44. Be considerate and wise in the Father's sight. Thou art prone to overlook all things; thou beratest idols and graven images, without weighing thy speech. What more are the letters of a written word than graven images? Doth not all the wisdom in books hang on these? Nor canst thou prove a single problem in mathematics without graven images, and idols and symbols.</p>
 <p>45. To a man who never saw a hat, without a sign, or image, or symbol or an idol of one, or by one itself, how wilt thou convince him? But, if thou hast none to show him, then wilt thou make something of some corporeal in order to convey to his mind that which is in your mind.</p>
 <p>46. Why, then, complainest thou against the angels of old? Wert thou, then, with Asu, who could not talk? Bethink thee what stratagems thou wouldst have resorted to in order to teach him to think. For is it not the greatest of all wisdom to teach man to think for himself? Is this not better for man, than to reveal all things to him? For, in the latter case thou wouldst deprive him of the use of his own talents, and thus thwart the plan of Jehovih.</p>
 <p>47. Thou hast portraits of thy wife and daughters, for they assist thy memory to recall their beauty to thy soul; but when thou desirest to convey to thy friend's mind a place he never saw, thou bringest him a landscape picture, saying: Behold, this is the place! Now, thou utterest a falsehood, for it is only a piece of cloth painted, whilst the place thou speakest of, is land, and trees, and water.</p>
 <p>48. Bethink thee, now thou hast resorted to falsehood in order to convey a truth to thy friend's mind. Was such, a falsehood, if it really succeeded in conveying a truth, nor couldst thou convey the truth to thy friend, save thou wouldst have taken him to the place.</p>
 <p>49. How, then, could the angels of Jehovih teach man of Jehovih, but by idols and graven images? Weigh the matter, and thou shalt perceive that knowledge is conveyed from man to man by idols and images. Even the sound of a spoken word, is an idol of an idea; and the idea is carried within that which is not the real thing itself, but merely wind.</p>
 <p>50. Thy corporeal senses can only be reached by corporeal things. Spiritual things, of which ideas are a part, can be conveyed by es force, and without idols and images. Give heed to my words, and thou shalt find the way to thy Father's kingdom.</p>
 <p>51. Having taught man of Jehovih through stone and wood, it was necessary, next, to teach him by means of spirit, that Jehovih was disassociated from the earth, otherwise man would not have desire to rise to the heavens in etherea. To this end man was taught that Jehovih's sons had ascended and were sitting at His right hand.</p>
 <p>52. As thou speaketh not to the picture of thy wife, neither shalt thou worship the Lord, nor Buddha, nor Christ, but Jehovih alone. He is sufficient to all men and nations, and acceptable to them. Be not angry with the past but broad in thy perception; for all things, whether stones or wood or men, are from Jehovih for the ultimate resurrection of the souls of men to His etherean worlds, for their own happiness, and to glorify Jehovih forever.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter III</h3>
 <p>1. Tae said: How shall I come to Thee, O Jehovih? I have nothing more to stand upon.</p>
 <p>2. My self-conceit hath been as a mountain before my vision. I have nothing to boast over the ancients; the things I gloried in, the inventions, and sciences, and discoveries of my time, I saw not from Thy standpoint, I exulted in myself, saying, have I not done great things?</p>
 <p>3. But I had not done a hand's turn with all my inventions and discoveries to better the poor and unlearned. What, then, is the measure of the good I have done more than the ancients?</p>
 <p>4. Verily hast Thou turned my eyes inward and made me ashamed. The sciences I boasted of, hast Thou nailed down to the earth, and I perceive my spirit was burrowing into corporeal things only. And as to Thy Gods and saviors, and idols of all kinds, I was cursing Thee in cursing them. In my conceit I was demanding light from Thee, and straightway plunging my head into darkness.</p>
 <p>5. Yet I come to Thee, O Jehovih! Thou alone art my theme. Thou my Love and my Glory. But I will not say: Give me light! Thine is the wisdom and the power to bestow whatever is for my own good.</p>
 <p>6. When I called for light, it was for myself, and was void before Thee. I had raised up my voice against prayer lest I appear as a beggar in Thy presence. What, more, then, is any man, but a living prayer? One desireth riches, one power, one wisdom, one love, one food, and one rest. Henceforth, then, I will pray for nothing, but accept whatever Thou bestoweth. Yet how can I restrain myself? Do I not desire to know Thy heavens in the firmament? To find a way whereby I may come to the spirits of the wise men of olden time?</p>
 <p>7. Can I restrain my desire to know all that hath been on the earth; to find the people who once lived in the buried cities; put myself in rapport with them in spirit, and hear them tell their earthly exploits of thousands of years ago?</p>
 <p>8. Since thou hast put away words and become a worker in My behalf, I have drawn nearer thee in wisdom and power. Behold, then thy reward!</p>
 <p>9. Kosmon said: And Jehovih touched Tae on the forehead, and his spirit sense was opened. And Esfoma came and brought Tae a lava-stone, saying: Lay this on thy forehead. Tae laid the lava-stone on his forehead, but he saw it not.</p>
 <p>10. Esfoma said: What now?</p>
 <p>11. Tae said: I feel like a burning mountain. Lo, this stone has been hurled from a burning crater. Then Esfoma took a sealed record and gave it to Tae, saying: What of this, O man?</p>
 <p>12. Tae said: I will lay it on my forehead, where the light cometh. And when he had done this he read the record without opening it.</p>
 <p>13. Jehovih said: Unto all men I gave two senses, corpor and es. In the time of Seffas I allotted to man to mature corpor. But now is the time of Kosmon come, and man shall mature es.</p>
 <p>14. It is well that thou shalt be believing toward men and angels; but it is better to develop thyself. Thou hast desired to know the mysteries of My unseen worlds, and the past histories of the earth. Behold, I give unto thee a new sense, the which will fulfill thy soul's desire. Yea, thou shalt read the books in the libraries of heaven!</p>
 <p>15. Have I not said of old: All things shall be revealed! Think not that a messenger will come, loud speaking, for man would not believe; but I quickened the righteous with Mine own hand, and they will comprehend without belief.</p>
 <p>16. The time of preaching and believing is at an end. Man shall know of his knowledge, and practice that which he knoweth. Herein is My light being manifested in this day.</p>
 <p>17. Kosmon said: Tae called the new sense, suis, because it is spirit-seeing and spirit-hearing. And Tae comprehended that approximate things leave an impression on each other, which impression can be read by the suis sense.</p>
 <p>18. Tae said: Now will I cultivate this talent Jehovih hath given me, for I perceive it lieth closely to the es'ean worlds. Was it not for the cultivation of this sense that Samuel of old founded a college of prophecy? And did not Zarathustra do so also?</p>
 <p>19. Jehovih spake through Kosmon: Whoever pursueth righteousness by this talent shall rise to receive not only the past, but the future also. But whosoever turneth suis down into the earth shall fall, and not rise. When danha is upon the earth, I give suis to as many as have risen in spirit above the flesh.</p>
 <p>20. But many turned away from Me, using suis for riches, and they descended to darkness. Suis being a talent above the earth, shall not be used for earthly things, and in this respect, there are many dead who have not attained to suis.</p>
 <p>21. Then went Tae forth, that he might comprehend unseen things; and the light of Jehovih went with him, and angels also.</p>
 <p>22. And when he had come within a temple of worship where Christians were worshipping, Jehovih drew near, and the power and light of Jehovih's sons and daughters were upon him; and they said, what beholdest thou?</p>
 <p>23. Tae said: Two peoples are before me, corporeans and es'eans (spirits) and they are alike, save one hath not corporeal bodies and the other hath, and they are clothed alike. As one worshippeth, so worshippeth the other, and the light that is upon them all is the same, no greater, no less.</p>
 <p>24. Now, when Tae departed and came to a temple where Buddhans were worshipping, Kosmon said: What beholdest thou? And Tae answered, saying: Even as in the other place, mortals and spirits worshipping, and the same light is upon them both.</p>
 <p>25. Jehovih led Tae forth again, saying: Since thou hast suis, thou shalt attain also to ethe, in after time. After that, Tae departed, and went into a saloon, where men were smoking and drinking, and Jehovih touched him and said: What beholdest thou?</p>
 <p>26. Tae said: Corporeans and es'eans, and the same light is upon them both, and their habits are the same, and their avocations also. They are smoking and drinking, both mortals and spirits, neither is one above the other.</p>
 <p>27. Jehovih caused Tae then to go to a place of pollution, and when Tae had beholden all, he said: Alas, that mine eyes have beholden this day! Both peoples are the same! And there came into the place the son of a rich man and the son of a king, and the spirits of darkness went and fondled them, but the young men saw them not. But their flesh was moved upon, for they lived for the flesh's sake, and they fell in sin. And when the young men departed out of the place of evil, lo and behold, many of the spirits of pollution went with them,</p>
 <p>28. Jehovih said: Tae, My son, thou shalt follow them and bear testimony to what happeneth. And Tae did as commanded.</p>
 <p>29. Presently the prince and the rich man's son came to a neighbor's house where assembled many young women, with their mothers and fathers. And the spirits of pollution went and fondled the women, yet the mothers urged their daughters to comply with the visitors' wishes, being desirous of wedding them. And whilst Tae was yet in the house a cloud of darkness came upon it, and he departed. But yet not many days elapsed when there went up from that house weeping and wailing because of the wickedness done therein.</p>
 <p>30. Tae said: Thou art just, O Jehovih! The gift of suis has made me strong in righteousness, and filled me with fear also. I perceive how Thou hast measured the lovers of earthly things, and meted to them the companions they have chosen. Herein doth it devolve on me to develop suis in my sons and daughters, and in all children whom I can raise up, and in time to come neither the good or evil that is in any man can escape their observation. Is not this the foundation of prophecy?</p>
 <p>31. Kosmon said: By the light of Jehovih that dwelleth in me I declare unto thee, O Tae! Be thou wise not only in suis, but in the corporeal judgment also. Thou hast perceived that all things leave an impression on all approximate things. To read these is suis.</p>
 <p>32. Hath it not been written of old: save thou separatest thyself in body and spirit from the world, thou shalt not reach Nirvana. Put this and that together, learning from the past as well as the present.</p>
 <p>33. Tae said: Now do I perceive, O Jehovih, I must avoid the imprint of evil things in order to attain Thy higher light. Is not this the true course to raise up my sons and daughters? For of what benefit in the world is suis if it remain amidst clouds. Tae withdrew from the world, taking his sons and daughters with him, besides orphans and infants without number. And he built a home in the country, and founded a college of suis, teaching the exercise of both the spiritual senses and the corporeal senses.</p>
 <p>34. Tae said: Lo and behold, infants have suis at the first. In all the ages past hath man smothered it out by ministering to the corporeal senses alone. And Tae preserved to his sons and daughters, and to the infants, the power of suis.</p>
 <p>35. Jehovih said: Fear not for them, O man, for in having suis, they will not depart away from Me. They shall be the founders of My kingdom on earth. Then Jehovih spake through Es.</p>
 <p>26. Es said: For thy good works thou hast enlisted angels from the second heaven (etherea). Hear me, O Tae, and be wise in thy judgment. Whilst thou wert in the world and with it, thy voice of prayer rose not, but wasted itself amidst familiar spirits and mortals. The impressions of these being around about thee, transcend all other powers in thy soul. But now that thou hast freed thyself from the presence of them who live for earthly things alone, thou art open to receive the Father.</p>
 <p>37. Remember that in this day Kosmon is bestowed on the earth; that is, the era in which man shall combine the wisdom of earth knowledge with the wisdom of spirit knowledge; the light of the hermit and recluse with the light of the city; the learning of the books of old with the spirit of making books of his own.</p>
 <p>38. Give heed to my words! Jehovih giveth to one the power to heal by means of the spirit. Let such a person not fall back on spirit power alone, but diligently pursue all corporeal knowledge of healing. This is Kosmon.</p>
 <p>39. Jehovih giveth to another oratory and music by means of spirit power. Let such a person not fall back on spirit alone, but diligently pursue also corporeal knowledge on oratory and music. This is Kosmon.</p>
 <p>40. Did not the teacher of music under the reign of Seffas apply the corporeal notes and not the Spirit? And yet when he taught a bird to sing, he shut it up in a dark room and made it learn from es only. In this he was wiser with the bird than with his sons and daughters.</p>
 <p>41. So also hath the man of much learning drowned his own spirit in darkness; nevertheless, the man of suis shall not neglect book learning; otherwise he is but as a clock without a regulator, a ship without a rudder.</p>
 <p>42. To attain to Kosmon is to find the secret of prophecy. Think not that prophecy can be attained without diligence in pursuing knowledge. As thou wouldst from corporeal knowledge foretell an eclipse, so from es knowledge shalt thou fore-tell and past-tell the nations of the earth. Yet all knowledge, corporeal or es'ean, is compatible with general principles, and one may lead to unfolding the other.</p>
 <p>43. In olden times wise angels came to men and informed them of what was to happen, and these men were called prophets. but I tell thee, O Tae, such men were only instruments of revelation. In the time of Kosmon, men shall not be merely instruments of prophecy, but actual prophets themselves.</p>
 <p>44. As man computeth motions of corporeal earth, and foretelleth an eclipse, so shalt thou compute the es of man and nations, and the vortices of the unseen worlds, and foretell coming events, and cause the hidden things of the earth to deliver up their long hidden secrets.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter IV</h3>
 <p>1. Tae said: Now will I apply myself to Thy works, O Jehovih. Thine is a book that never errs. The times Thou bestoweth shall be my sign-posts. Is this not the most exalted science under the sun?</p>
 <p>2. Thereupon Tae collected histories from the arc of Bon to the coming of Kosmon; and the sons and daughters of Jehovih quickened him to remember all the knowledge that had come into the world from the revelations of that day. When Tae had completed his labors he made a tablet of events, and classified them, and he called the tablet Orachnebauhgalah, because it was of the line of the tree of Jehovih, being the last of the fruits of the Hebrew language. But the people called it the tablet of prophecy, signifying, the mathematics of both evil and good.</p>
 <p>3. And Tae divided the time of the tablet according to the darkness and the light of the period, and for four hundred years prior, and it was in all, three thousand four hundred years.</p>
 <p>4. Tae said: According to the light of my Father in heaven will I call the ends of the tablet dan'ha, for these are the quickened times mentioned by the prophets of old. Not only will I prove them whether they are true or not; but I will find the motion of the Great Serpent and this will determine the orbit thereof.</p>
 <p>5. For since Jehovih hath made years, hath He not also made cycles, and will not the cycles comport with the rules of members?</p>
 <p>6. Thus did Tae determine that an arc was three thousand years, but that the dan'ha varied from fifty to six hundred years.</p>
 <p>7. Tae said: Though Thou, O Jehovih, hath made Thy arcs three thousand years, Thou hast wisely varied the heights thereof. Now will I compute the events within the cycle of Bon and find the members born into atmospherea, and the times of their abiding lights.</p>
 <p>8. And Tae perceived that he could determine the dominions of the lower heaven, and from this revert to the earth and discover what had been in ages past. Thereupon Tae classified cycles at three thousand years, and the wave of the Great Serpent at two hundred years and four hundred years. These again he subdivided, and he found that every thirty-third year was alike on the earth in heat and cold, and he discovered from these the nebulous regions within the vortex of the earth, and the cause of the variations in the times of falling meteors.</p>
 <p>9. Again Tae subdivided the thirty-third year into eleven, and he found the variation one in ninety-nine years. Then sorrow came upon his soul, and he cried out unto the Father.</p>
 <p>10. Tae said: O Jehovih, wherein have I done wrongfully? In all my computations I was puffed up with promised surety, but in my farthest research I am tripped up. The power betwixt the sun and the earth could not make this defect. Jehovih heard the voice of Tae, and answered him through His son Corpor.</p>
 <p>11. Corpor said: Why repinest thou, O Tae. Thou hast taken for granted a power existeth betwixt the sun and earth, because, forsooth, philosophers have taught it. Did not the philosophers of old say the sun was the Creator?</p>
 <p>12. Tae then cast aside the philosophy of this day, proved the attraction of the corporeal worlds do not exceed seven diameters, each of its own, but many of them less than two. And he measured the satellites and their distances from their central corpor, and he perceived the diameters of the vortices could be determined by the loss or gain in the velocity of the satellites.</p>
 <p>13. Where vortices had matured in form, he called them wark, as they had been called amongst the ancients, and the wark of the earth was one million five hundred and four miles in diameter, but the vortex of the sun in the places where the earth rideth, is three thousand years, which is to say, one year of the earth's wark is equal to one year of the sun's vortex, which is as one year to three thousand years in the trail of the serpent, and this again giveth the orbit of the Great Serpent four million seven hundred thousand years.</p>
 <p>14. Tae said: All approximate things impress each other and to find the roadway in the earth's travel is to find what hath been and what will be. If, therefore, the past history of the earthly people for three thousand years were written truthfully it would disclose the roadways of one cycle of time, and this must be repeated each thirty-third cycle with one deviation in ninety-nine cycles, and half a deviation in eight cycles, which is equivalent to twenty-four thousand years.</p>
 <p>15. And Tae measured the past cycles for twenty-four thousand years, and the sons and daughters of Jehovih were with him, contributing every one a part.</p>
 <p>16. This, then, is the genesis of the Cycles, i.e., First Jehovih and His times, and all the created things from without a beginning. And Jehovih was the Unseen, which is Spirit, and the Seen, which is His Person and Body.</p>
 <p>17. By Jehovih in mastery over His Person created He countless worlds of which the corporeal earth is one, and He created the living thereon, and the time was one gadol, i.e., twenty-four thousand years.</p>
 <p>18. Hak was second born, and then Semu, and they covered the earth abroad with asu, till hotu came, and Jehovih ceased creating new living things; and the second time of the earth was hotu,</p>
 <p>19. Jehovih sent Seffas, word-maker, with a sword; and in the seventh cycle of Seffas the continent of Pan was peopled over with men raised up to words and deeds of blood.</p>
 <p>20. And yet in other cycles the earth had prospered only on one continent, and none could be inspired to go abroad and live with asu. So Jehovih saw wisdom in the arc of Suth, who held dominion for three thousand years; and He begat Iz, who was in dominion three thousand one hundred years, and He begat Aph, who reigned three thousand six hundred years; who begat Apollo, who reigned two thousand eight hundred years; who begat Osiris, the first, who reigned three thousand three hundred years; who begat Abraham and Brahma, who reigned two thousand four hundred years; who begat Moses and Capilya, who reigned three thousand four hundred years; who begat Kosmon, of which this is the thirty-third years; (1881) and the Great Serpent is in the sixty-fourth Huy of the orbit of c'warkum (C'Vorkum).</p>
 <p>21. It came to pass, that when the earth had entered into the thirty-third year of the arc of Kosmon in the etherean firmament, Jehovih spake out of the midst of heaven, and there were quickened up those whom His holy angels had prepared to hear the Father's voice.</p>
 <p>22. Jehovih said: All who hear My voice shall know Me, and comprehend My Person. And as many as hear Me and behold My presence shall be called Tae, for they are the first-fruit of the resurrection in Kosmon. Of such were the Faithists in the arc of Bon and in the cycles prior to that period.</p>
 <p>23. And Tae shall come forth in Me, for he is My word, speaking in his labor to that end, and not by books nor by the words of the mouth.</p>
 <p>24. And I will quicken Tae and he shall be as a new race on the earth, practicing holiness by good works, and by associative labor; dwelling in peace and love with one another, abnegating self in all things; for of such are My kingdoms; and Tae shall lay the foundation thereof upon the earth.</p>
 <p>25. To the organic associations who labor in Me, I send representative angels from My etherean worlds; but to him who liveth for self, and by isolation and inorganically with neighbors, I permit the angels of atmospherea to minister. Neither shall My hosts of the second heaven (etherea) come to those who are wrapped up in the earth, for they are as a reservoir for the spirits of darkness.</p>
 <p>26. And it came to pass that Tae was as one man, being attuned with the Father, and the light of the past and present came upon him. And the second heaven was let down to the earth, and the hosts of etherea ministered to Tae, and quickened him, that he might understand what it was to hear the voice of Jehovih, neither depending on the sacred books of the ancients, nor on the angels of heaven.</p>
 <p>27. For Jehovih had said: In that day shall each and every one be as a covenant with Me, speaking and conversing with Me. They shall be as seers and prophets themselves, making their own sacred books, rites and ceremonies; and these shall stand above all else that have ever been.</p>
 <p>28. When Tae pursued suis, which is the reading of unseen impressions, he was also developed in ethe, which is the overtaking of the vibrations of things long past. For as one may cast a stone in a lake, and it waveth the water, and the air above it, so also do all things vibrate to the uttermost places. He who hath developed in ethe, becometh as an unraveler of tangled threads; and things that are past are as an open book. To him the books of the libraries of heaven are open, for he not only seeth and heareth the spirits of the dead, but he goeth forth out of the corporeal body (for such have no longer sin and self in them) and he beholdeth the glories of heaven, and returneth again to his corporeal body unharmed.</p>
 <p>29. Tae took the histories of men from the time of Moses to Kosmon, and for the periods of war and destruction he made one place, and for the periods of peace and good will amongst men, he made another place, for he saw that the actions and behaviors of nations were governed largely by the unseen worlds around about them. These formed a map of light and darkness, as it had been for three thousand four hundred years. And this became as a key to unlock the past, and a base to foretell the future.</p>
 <p>30. So he made plates and tables of the firmament above, for even as they reveal the past, they also become as an index to what will happen on the earth for the next three thousand years, and they unfold the conditions of nations now on the earth and show what will be their places in heaven.</p>
 <p>31. Tae said: To all peoples on earth, and to the spirits of the lower heaven do I declare in the name of Jehovih: Through Him and of His hand have I been lifted up. Hear me, O mortals: Give ear, O ye spirits of the dead! The Father has spoken. The secrets of His glory is in my keeping. By Him do I reveal; in Him am I mighty!</p>
 <p>32. I was in darkness, but am now in light. His presence is upon me. Harken thee to my words, and be wise in your lives.</p>
 <p>33. Seek not to disprove Him; seek not to prove that these things cannot be; seek not to deny His Person or Spirit. Of such was my bondage. In bitterness of heart was I bound in darkness. For those who deny, those who try to disprove His voice, are in darkness.</p>
 <p>34. He is the same today and forever. The prophets of old found Him; so also can ye. But He cometh not to the denier, nor to the disprover.</p>
 <p>35. He who will find His Person must look for Him. He who will hear His voice must harken.</p>
 <p>36. Are there not those who hear and see the spirits of the dead? This is suis. But ethe lieth higher. This is hearing Jehovih, seeing His hand.</p>
 <p>37. Who can believe, not knowing this? Who but His prophets have the just compounding of words? They do not utter and quibble as men, but give forth as Gods. Consider this: Seek to become one with Him, by proclaiming and practicing Him.</p>
 <p>38. Go ye forth, saying: Now will I find Thee; now will I hear Thee, O Jehovih! Thy voice shall become my words.</p>
 <p>39. This is the secret, O man: This is the attuning of thyself with Him. Seek, then, to make Him thine own holy book. Art thou as a servant coming to a master to read and write letters for thee? Such is not Kosmon.</p>
 <p>40. Be a man in the presence of Jehovih. Build up thy kingdom at once. It shall be thine in heaven. Think not that thou canst sin by coming to Him. Sin lieth the other way.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter V</h3>
 <p>1. Tae then made a tablet of the nations of the earth, and of the people therein, rank and rank, caste and caste. And when it was completed, Jehovih spake to him through His sons and daughters.</p>
 <p>2. Jehovih said: Separate thou all the people into four groups, and thou shalt determine the kingdoms of atmospherea. And thou shalt divide them after the manner of My judgment upon them. Remember, O man, that in all My kingdoms, like attracts like. According to their talents so do I prosper them.</p>
 <p>3. He who desireth of the earth, I give of the earth. He who desireth of heaven, I give heavenly treasures.</p>
 <p>4. Tae said: I perceive why the king desireth to be king, why the idler desireth to be idle, why the general desireth to rule, and the captain to become a leader of men, and why the rich man glorieth in riches. If they prosper in these things, is it not because the corporeal transcended the spirit?</p>
 <p>5. And Tae brought all these together, and this he called the first division, saying: He who is farthest from Jehovih prospereth best in the corporeal world, for his desires show the direction of his soul.</p>
 <p>6. Tae then called together all the laborers of the earth who were diligent but prospered not, and he found their spiritual judgment transcended their corporeal judgment. These he called the second division.</p>
 <p>7. Tae then collected together all the infants in the world, and they were without judgment, and this he called the third division.</p>
 <p>8. Tae then called together all the people who lived off the earnings and industry of others, and these were thieves, robbers, politicians, lawyers, judges, and preachers who live in fine houses. This he called the fourth division.</p>
 <p>9. And when Tae looked abroad over the earth, lo and behold there was one man left, and he was alone of his kind on the earth.</p>
 <p>10. Tae said: Who art thou? And the man answered, I know not, neither do I know whence I came, or whither I shall go.</p>
 <p>11. Tae said: What is thy labor? The man answered: Whatsoever I can turn my hand to, that I do; and I give all I have, and my time to whosoever needeth me. Tae said: Shall I give thee gold? The man said: Nay, I need nothing. Tae said: Shall I make thee a leader of men? The man answered: Nay, to be a leader on earth is to be bound in heaven. Tae said: Then thou shalt have renown, for thou art the highest of men. But the man answered: Nay, I will not have renown, for when I am dead and gone to heaven I would be called back continually by the prayers of men. Naked I came into the world; permit me to depart when my time cometh as Jehovih directeth. Now when Tae found the man desired nothing of the earth for earth's sake, he cried out to the Father saying:</p>
 <p>12. Four divisions have I made of the people of the earth, but there is one man beside, and he fitteth none of the divisions. Where, then, shall I place him?</p>
 <p>13. Jehovih said: Leave thou him alone, and when his death is at hand, My etherean angels shall carry his soul to the second heaven, for he is My son.</p>
 <p>14. Then Jehovih questioned Tae, saying: How judgeth thou the children of men?</p>
 <p>15. Tae said: The leaders, that is kings, queens, emperors, popes, and rich men, I have made into one division; producers into another division; idlers and babes another; and thieves, liars, robbers, politicians, judges, lawyers, and priests who live in fine houses, another division.</p>
 <p>16. Then spake Jehovih, through His sons and daughters, saying: Thou hast done well, for what is one man more than another when stripped of his flesh body, save in the righteousness of his soul? And is not the labor of man the true basis to weigh the worth of his spirit? What is the king or the rich man, more in My sight than the most menial servant?</p>
 <p>17. Then Tae counted the numbers of people whom he had collected in the four divisions, and they corresponded to the statistics of mortals.</p>
 <p>18. Jehovih said: Of such, rank and rank, caste and caste, are My kingdoms in atmospherea. According to that which they have developed on the earth so do I assign them in heaven. Let every man judge for himself and assign himself whithersoever he will. My kingdoms are open to all.</p>
 <p>19. Thus did Tae discover the rank and grade of the lower heaven, and the numbers of people dwelling in each and every division thereof.</p>
 <p>20. Jehovih called His sons and daughters, and Tae stood upright before Him.</p>
 <p>21. Jehovih said: What is thy wisdom, O man!</p>
 <p>22. Tae then answered: I have learned by corporeal things, which are seen and heard. I have learned also of spiritual things, which are unseen and unheard.</p>
 <p>23. Jehovih said: What thine eyes behold or what thine ears hear, is My Person; the others are of My spirit. When was the birth of this, thy Kosmon knowledge?</p>
 <p>24. Tae said: When the inhabitants, who were descendants of Thy people had circumscribed the earth, and settled it around about, then Thy holy angels came and knocked on the walls of Rochester! They proclaimed Thee, and no other God or Lord.</p>
 <p>25. Jehovih said: Before this I had searched the earth over, and selected and provided a place for My kingdom. By My angels did I inspire the founders of this new country to banish the dominion of Church with State, and to provide for the spirit of man to proclaim Me and My Person. They became a mighty nation, and the spirit of manhood was in them, for as I taught them to deny the divine right of kings, I foresaw they would also deny the same thing of Christ, and cast him out.</p>
 <p>26. Tae perceived that these things were so, and that the time had come when all the people will bow to none save Jehovih, the Great Spirit.</p>
 <p>27. Jehovih said: Hear Me, O Tae, for I speak through all the members of My Family, and I will declare Myself to all My nations and peoples under the sun. Nor shall there be any more Gods or Lords or saviors on My footstool.</p>
 <p>28. In the time of Kosmon, up to the thirty-third year thereof, these things have come to pass:</p>
 <p>29. Thousands and thousands of men, women and children have been quickened by Jehovih to signs and miracles, even as in the time of the ancients, and many of them have attained to suis, seeing without corporeal eyes and hearing without corporeal hearing, knowing things far and near, by a sense not belonging to the corporeal organs.</p>
 <p>30. And these people being distinguished from others are comprehended under the name Tae, being the first-fruits of heaven on earth in this day. And many of them have foresense around about them of such kind that the spirits of the dead can come to them and openly commune, proving themselves unto all who are willing to receive truth, to be the spirits of friends and relatives deceased on the earth.</p>
 <p>31. And the knowledge that cometh from the spirits of the dead proveth itself in many ways to transcend the knowledge of mortals, as is classed and distinguished from mortal knowledge by the word es, because it cometh from the unseen, which is one of the kingdoms of Jehovih.</p>
 <p>32. That, therefore, when Tae speaketh, it signifieth the highest and the combined knowledge that hath come to mortals in the time of Kosmon, from the wisest of the spirits, who have communicated as aforesaid. And since all wisdom cometh from Jehovih, whether uttered by a mortal or a spirit, so is it said He speaketh through them.</p>
 <p>33. Now when Tae had put away self, striving to come, by his behavior, to Jehovih, a new light dawned upon him, for as it was given to him to see the spirit of the recently dead, so by purification, did he attain to intercourse with associative bodies in the unseen worlds.</p>
 <p>34. And these associative bodies being exalted angels in wisdom and purity, speak of the first elements and not of the instruments used, because it is their mode of language; that is to say, for example, Jehovih spake through es saying: Whereas mortals, and spirits of the first heaven would the same thing, thus: According to the accumulated testimony from the most advanced spirit world.</p>
 <p>35. Let man be wise and perceive that the Father standeth behind all and within all; for as he riseth out of individualities, becoming comprehensive in expression, so riseth his spirit also.</p>
 <p>36. These things Tae perceived. And the Father came to him through Es and unfolded the scroll of heaven.</p>
 <p>37. Es said: Transversely, as seen by man, the worlds are: First the earth, then atmospherea, and then to the ether beyond.</p>
 <p>38. Jehovih commanded man to be brought forth on the earth, and dwell thereon for a season; then to die and rise in spirit and dwell for a season in atmospherea, traveling with the earth, daily and yearly, even in its journey throughout the etherean heavens.</p>
 <p>39. He who would know, therefore, the rank a man will inherit in heaven shall estimate the comparative strength of spirit and the purity of behavior. If a man live isolated on earth, laboring for self, he will be isolated in heaven and companionless.</p>
 <p>40. It was said in olden time: Judge not, lest ye be judged; but I say unto thee, judge all men spiritually and corporeally, but hold thy tongue, looking to thyself to know how the Father judgeth thee by talents and by works. But above all things observe the unseen causes that play upon thee, quickening thy memory and thy perception, for herein lieth a great secret of acquiring spiritual knowledge.</p>
 <p>41. Thou art a type of the world; thou hast a daily life, a yearly life, and a cyclic life; the latter of which, is first, infancy; second, puberty; third, maximus; fourth, old age; fifth, death. A corporeal world hath these, and she imparteth her periods to the people thereof.</p>
 <p>42. Perceive, then, O man, to attune thyself to Jehovih is to become a prophet. To understand the kingdoms of the lower heaven is to know the appointments of familiar spirits and guardian spirits over mortals. Thus shalt thou perceive the first place allotted to them at the death. But to understand the realms in etherea, thou shalt discern the times of associative redemption of atmosphereans.</p>
 <p>43. For as there are spirits, who are captains over a star, or the earth, or sun, so are there generals over the etherean worlds; and yet beyond them, great commanders over the vortices in the wide universe. As thou hast felt the cold breeze of the spirit circle, made by the spirits in attendance, know there are those high raised in heaven in power and wisdom whose presence fashion the currents of the embryonic worlds, and propel them forth by a breath! They have others beneath them who are themselves Gods and Goddesses.</p>
 <p>44. But remember, O man, that in all the glories there is still One who is higher than all, even the Person of All, who is Jehovih.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter VI</h3>
 <p>1. The light of the following truths will be manifest to him. Let him, on the other hand, shut himself up in denial; saying: I defy thee to prove the matter, and he shall not be enlightened.</p>
 <p>2. In the testimony of Jehovih, speaking through Es, and by the spirit of man quickened.</p>
 <p>3. As a man liveth on earth, acquiring perfections or imperfections in spirit, so will he enter the es world at death.</p>
 <p>4. Death is the severing knife which separateth the corporeal man from the spiritual man. The former returneth to the earth, but the latter surviveth, and in time riseth upward.</p>
 <p>5. By death man suffereth the loss of companionship of mortals, but is quickened and united with those he loved before.</p>
 <p>6. A new world is open to him, full of light and splendor, having a fitness to his spirit, even more gloriously real than the corporeal world was to his mortal part.</p>
 <p>7. As a corporeal man requireth corporeal food and clothes, with a habitable place to dwell, so in like manner requireth his spirit, and is so provided within atmospherea, but spiritually.</p>
 <p>8. The first habitable place in es is on the earth, and near around the earth, and mostly within the same house wherein he dwelt in mortal form. But the spirit is subtle and moveth, but not as corporeal things move, having power and presence with friends and kin at remote distances, as if all was in one place; for of such nature is the es world.</p>
 <p>9. Spirit existeth within corporea, and by this means are the dead enabled to manifest to the living. However, to such of the living who have no consciousness of their own spirit, the spirits of the dead cannot manifest intelligently.</p>
 <p>10. For a mortal to be conscious of his own spirit, it must transcend his corporeal senses; he who knoweth not of his own spirit is weak indeed. Such a man born into the spirit world is as a newborn child, knowing nothing.</p>
 <p>11. All men born into spirit life die imperfect and ignorant, and weak, depending on nurses, guardians and doctors. Many such are slain in war, or in desperate madness, are born into spirit life in chaos. Some will not leave the battlefield.</p>
 <p>12. To the long suffering and to the weary, who are upright of heart, death is a doorway to a world of bliss, of rest, and love.</p>
 <p>13. To the captain and general, who were slayers of men, death is a doorway to them whence spring up at them ghastly wounds and frenzied maniacs, crying out or vengeance. And the slayers of men run away, but escape not; they cry out, but are mocked at. The wailing of the widows and orphans is an increasing horror to them. Their nose is suffocated and their eyes appalled with gaping, bloody wounds.</p>
 <p>14. The leader of men entereth the es world to meet an army of misled confidants; and his tricks and falsehoods are as garments soiled and spotted to hide a blackened heart. He turneth away, but the mirror of his past deeds hangeth up before him.</p>
 <p>15. The rich man entereth the es world at the door of his bank. In the bank he tarrieth all day. At night he wandereth up and down. He meeteth another rich man; they shake hands but speak not. Then he goeth forth. In the morning he is in the door of his bank again, and all day he loitereth around about. He worrieth at the manner of clerks; he feareth his widow will come to want, or that his bank will soon run low. He seeth the glory of the spirit world, but he cannot enter it. The servants that washed his clothes stand fairer than he. Yea, he is abashed for the whiteness of their raiment and the light of their souls; and so he turneth and hideth in his bank again.</p>
 <p>16. But lo, the spirit of him who is dead sucketh out the spirit of the wine and leaveth him distracted still.</p>
 <p>17. Another darker chamber openeth; a dealer in wines is dead; one with fashionable home, and wife and daughters, high aspiring. Confronted in his stores with the spirits of such as died from his temptations, bleary-eyed and boisterous, they come to welcome the newly dead, and with atmospherean potions sucked out of his plenteous barrels, greet him with rich applause. Then he flieth to wife and daughters in his mansion richly furnished. But lo, the drunken sots and spirits, foul smelling, fill his habitation. With terrible anger, helpless, beholdeth he the spirits of pollution fondling his daughter's person, and his widow a fountain for their revelry.</p>
 <p>18. And yet the depth is not full. In a stately mansion a woman of high caste is dead. And it was said she was blessed, because since not having borne children, ease and glory were at her command. And now, with curious mirth and some envy, the spirits of other women who were outcasts come to behold the newborn spirit of the leader of fashion. And as they turn about, nurses come with children born from her body and her spirit, by abortion cast into heaven, even in Jehovih's face accursed: A curtain of black death that will not away, choketh her. To the left, the right, or up and down, there is nothing but the wail of sweet babes - Mother, why murderest thou me? Was I not Jehovih's gift? The woman of fashion hides but is not hidden, even the soiled outcasts are white beside her; like a woman that is crushed but cannot die, she squirmeth and writheth in the kingdom she built with her own hands.</p>
 <p>19. From the scene of horrors now opened Uz the door of the man of corporeal learning. His spirit wandereth in libraries and ancient tombs and hieroglyphs, or sigheth over problems never solved. Day by day, night by night, he restlessly peereth into the same paths, and over and over burroweth deep in darkness. Stripling youths and fairies pull his wig or upturn his spectacles, saying: O fool, knoweth thou not thou art dead? Turn from these corporeal tombs and behold Great Jehovih's light. In sorrow and pity he regardeth them, saying: I am not dead: When I am dead, there is the end. I am but sick, still dwelling in my corporeal body. And then he wandereth on, a living sepulchre.</p>
 <p>20. A farmer is dead. It was his wont to rise early and toil all day; to ponder much on the fruit of his labor and to glory in his freedom. For himself and his family he lived; to himself and his family that Jehovih gaveth him. In his house and his fields his spirit walketh about; he knoweth no heaven or hell. As a weed that is worthless to itself and the world, so is his spirit, and as the weed knoweth the field that brought it forth, neither doth he know Jehovih's heaven. Nor can he go but from field to field, and back to his house, day and night. He liveth for nothing higher, and Jehovih gave him that which he desired.</p>
 <p>21. What spirit is this that glutteth itself in the slaughter house? He was a gormandizer; he is dead. He goeth from saloon to saloon sniffing the air of roasted viands, and fat meats, and of wines; the smell of the fat man is his delight; and the woman that rejoiceth in sin, rare flesh and fat soups, is as a cushion for him to roll upon. One saith: I never come into this saloon but I recollect him that is dead; he so loved this place: And the other saith: I believe his spirit loitereth here still else why do we so oft think of him. And thereupon they gorge themselves, even whilst the spirit of the dead feedeth on the atmospherean part. This is all the heaven he sought on earth, and Jehovih gave it to him.</p>
 <p>22. And now cometh confusion in heaven. He that forever argued is dead. Scarce newborn in spirit life he setteth up to prove his position and enlighten all the world. The curious and the idler gather around to hear his speech again. He striveth to show that all the world is a fool; in endless ways he turneth his arguments, and repeateth them over, day by day, night by night. This was what he strove to build on earth, and Jehovih gave him the same.</p>
 <p>23. And here, newborn in spirit, is the moderate man, who by industry earned a handsome house and raised up sons and daughters, creditable to the state. He is in his home still; heaven is too narrow for him. He saith: I would argue with Jehovih that I have not my share of heaven! Did I not give alms daily; the poor man a crust, and a poor woman a penny? When did I pass a blind man and not give? But none answer him. It is as if talking to the wind. Again and again he repeateth his complaint; but none take him by the hand, and he remaineth helplessly in his own home, which he asked Jehovih to help him build for his heirs.</p>
 <p>24. The recluse, with a new philosophy and scheme of diet, but aimless and of little producing, to benefit anything under the sun, is dead. The breath of mortals was poison to him, and all human influence to be avoided as poison infecting his most holy spirit. Here again gather nymphs and fairies to see his spirit make its etherean flight. As mortals gather around a pretender that promises to sail a balloon around the world, so gather these jocose and mischief loving spirits in the house of the recluse, to see his promised ascent. He will show them how the higher spheres in heaven are reached; he would not deign even in mortal life to commune with the spirits of the dead. None so low for him! But now he is dead and his spirit limps and trembles in his hovel, still boasting. And as he produced nothing in the corporeal world, so produceth he nothing still; but boasteth and secludeth, secludeth and boasteth; and this is his heaven, day and night.</p>
 <p>25. The light of Jehovih touched on the earth, and the heavens above were stirred to the foundation. Things past were moved forward. His voice was from the depth of darkness to the summit of All Light.</p>
 <p>26. The nations that had not known Him, now knew Him. Acceptable, and with loud rejoicings, they shouted, Jehovih! Jehovih! Almighty and Everlasting! Glory be to Thee on High! Creator, Father! All praise to Thee forever!</p>
 <p>27. And Jehovih went far and near swiftly, quickening with a new power, both the living and the dead. And the peoples raised up, and heard His voice from every corner, calling: Come forth! Come forth! O My beloved! And it was not like any sound under the sun, for it reached deep into the souls of men.</p>
 <p>28. And in the stirring up of things long past, it was as if a cloud of dust and darkness, foul and poisonous, overspread heaven, and earth, was to be cleared away and make room for the immortal kingdom.</p>
 <p>29. High above the clouds, and deep down in all the blackness, the All Light of Great Jehovih shone as the everlasting sun. The faith of men and angels rose up in increasing assurance to the Most High, that He in His matchless majesty, alone, would rise triumphant over all.</p>
 <p>30. Jehovih said: Bring forth the legions of earth and heaven! Summon up the dead! Let the living rejoice! My kingdom is at hand! And the dead came forth as if out of their graves, but clothed in the raiment of heaven; and they walked upon the earth; yea, face to face talked with the living, proclaiming the fullness of Jehovih and His everlasting kingdoms.</p>
 <p>31. Little infants that were long dead, returned to the living, full grown in heaven, singing in Jehovih's praise. Mothers returned from the unseen world with love and angel kisses for their mortal babes and sorrow-stricken husbands.</p>
 <p>32. Then rose the cloud of darkness higher and higher and higher; the poisonous smell and damnable tricks of hades belched forth in blackness terrible. The spirits of those slain in war, delirious, mad, and full of vengeance; and those whose earth lives had bound them in torments; and those who lived on earth to glut themselves to the full in abhorrent lust, came assuming the names of Gods and Saviors.</p>
 <p>33. And yet the voice of Jehovih called: Bring forth the legions of earth and heaven! Summon up the dead! Let the living rejoice! My kingdom is at hand.</p>
 <p>34. And now the cloud reached all around the earth. And almost was the light of Jehovih obscured. Still the faith of angels and mortals rose up in one increasing voice: Jehovih is mighty! I know He will prevail!</p>
 <p>35. And still the black giant arose, awful in gloom and blood-stained mantle, till the earth around became as a solemn night before a battle of death. Rattling bones and empty skulls, with gnashing teeth, all stained with human gore, made hideous by the portentous omen, caused angels and men to stand appalled.</p>
 <p>36. Jehovih said: Bring forth the legions of earth and heaven! Summon up the dead! Let the living rejoice! My kingdom is at hand!</p>
 <p>37. And now as the cloud of darkness stretched up out of the earth, girdling it all around, as a venomous reptile secureth his living food, lo and behold, the monster beast stretched forth four heads with flaming nostrils all on fire:</p>
 <p>38. On each head were two horns, blood stained and fresh with human victims flesh macerated. Their tongues darted forth in menace, and their open mouths watered for human souls, and with suspicion mad, and much distrusted, their blood-shot eyes pierced the foul darkness, making many a mortal quake in fear.</p>
 <p>39. And still the upraised of earth and heaven, with one voice, cried out: All hail, O Jehovih! Thou art mighty! Thou alone, shall prevail!</p>
 <p>40. And Jehovih answered to His faithful sons and daughters, the living and the dead: Bring forth the legions of earth and heaven! Summon up the dead! Let the living rejoice! My kingdom is at hand!</p>
 <p>41. Then men and women of wealth and fashion cast aside their earthly goods and went and labored with the poor, teaching cleanliness, and wisdom and uprighteousness of heart. And those that preached were the spirits of the dead, who were ripe in experience in Jehovih's unseen worlds.</p>
 <p>42. But the beast with his countless millions, was cast out from the earth. As a long black cloud, riven and broken, floating, floating, floating, it passed away, and was seen no more! Nor was there more any God known upon the earth. But Jehovih rose supreme in every land; and all people under the sun sang anthems of glory to His name:</p>
 <p>43. The voice of Jehovih came upon Es, saying:</p>
 <p>44. Of the past, these things shalt thou comprehend, O Tae. The beast walked forth on the earth in every guise, and in the second sphere of atmospherea he became a living person, born out of the sins of men.</p>
 <p>45. For one man worshipped science, and it was his beast; one worshipped riches, and it was his beast; one fashion, and it was her beast; another lust, and it was his; another worshipping nothing, and it was his beast; now all these and of such like order, continued to do the same things after death, for that which they had builded up on earth became as a living entity within them, and they could not put it away. This was the first resurrection, being the birth of unclean man into the spirit world.</p>
 <p>46. In the second sphere of atmospherea, which is the second resurrection, the condition was like unto the first but organic.</p>
 <p>47. For one people worshipped Brahma, making a beast of him; another worshipped Buddha, making a beast of him; another worshipped Christ, making a beast of him; another Jesus, making a beast of him, and forever parading his crucifixion; and the beast that each one builded up within his soul became an entity to him on his entrance into spirit life, and he became bound to the machinations of evil spirits professing to be that beast. And these evil spirits became as Gods, in fact, building kingdoms in the lower heavens, and making subjects and slaves of their worshippers, compelling them to contribute of their earnings and labor in spirit, even tribute on earth. Thousands and millions, and tens of millions of subjects and slaves had they, and their cities were even as represented to mortals, paved with comparative pearls and diamonds.</p>
 <p>48. These things hast thou witnessed; that the spirits of the first birth discourse on the things of the earth, and of marriage and begetting; not having risen even to the second resurrection. Their hope and belief in heaven is to re-enter wombs and be born again, teaching reincarnation, ministering to the proclivities of lust in mortals; inspiring visions of sexual desires and practices in heaven. For all such spirits have not risen up from the earth, and know no other abode, but to revel and glut themselves in corporeal debauchery. And many of them boastingly, and in darkness teach falsely that spirits in heaven beget sons and daughters, and even that sons and daughters reincarnate themselves in mortal flesh, becoming children of the earth.</p>
 <p>49. All such spirits shalt thou know by such teachings; for whatsoever seemeth the highest delight of a man on earth or a spirit in es, that will he exult in and proclaim.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter VII</h3>
 <p>1. Again Jehovih spake through Es saying:</p>
 <p>2. The first resurrection in heaven have I made to inspire the first resurrection on earth; the second resurrection in heaven have I made to inspire the second resurrection on earth. The third resurrection in heaven have I made to inspire the third resurrection on earth, the like to like made I them.</p>
 <p>3. Es said: Consider then, if a man on the earth strive for riches, or power, or in any manner, whence he draweth his inspiration; and determine thou also by this what will be his rank in his birth into the es world.</p>
 <p>4. And if a man be a preacher and not a practitioner, doing not the thing he knoweth to be the highest, thou shalt determine what will be his spirit birth.</p>
 <p>5. On the other hand, he that liveth to the full, the highest of all he knoweth, by his own strength, producing for others all he can, thou shalt determine his place also.</p>
 <p>6. These resurrections are possible, either on the earth or in heaven, but there are many so immersed in the earth, that only by death and by suffering hades, can they be aroused to strive for higher light in heaven.</p>
 <p>7. Now, it will be said to thee: Such a man hath lived a good and exemplary life, giving to the poor, being temperate and respectable before the world. What will be his place in heaven?</p>
 <p>8. Answer thou him, O Tae saying: He that serveth himself, goeth to the lowest of bound heavens; he who serveth Jehovih with all his wisdom and strength, goeth to the third realm, but he who serveth betwixt these two goeth to the second lowest of the bound realms. Shall a man deceive Jehovih, saying: I did the best I knew, when he knoweth he did not?</p>
 <p>9. Be thou wise in discerning Jehovih in all things, and seeing and judging as He would judge, for there are deceivers in heaven; and to him who would shelter his own deceit, these spirits come by thousands. But he of the second and third resurrection escapeth them.</p>
 <p>10. And now, touching the prophecy of a nation, weigh thou the people and determine what resurrection they are already in, and the number of each division. Then determine the generation antecedent; and the one again antecedent to that, making tablets thereof.</p>
 <p>11. They that are heavily laden, and dwell in Him, he is the type of My etherean worlds!</p>
 <p>12. Forswear yourselves away from the world; she worshippeth the beast, the cloud of the second resurrection is upon her. Wash your hands and be clean. My hosts from Most High heavens wait at your doors.</p>
 <p>13. Behold, the spirits of darkness and of lies and deception have knocked, and ye opened unto them.</p>
 <p>14. And now Tae looked abroad over the nations, and he said: What of the emperor, the queens, the king, and lords of the land?</p>
 <p>15. Es said: Weigh thou them, O man, they and their peoples under them, and enumerate them according to the tablets, and thou shalt foretell the times that are set for them. As they were built up by the sword, they shall fall by the sword; as they stand by the strength of their standing armies, even by standing armies shall they be cut down.</p>
 <p>16. By the sword shall Christ destroy Mohammed, and Brahma and Buddha; but he shall come against Confucius and fall. Then shall Christ destroy himself; for as his followers have cast him out of Rome, he will have no abiding place on the earth.</p>
 <p>17. Search thou the road of Vishnu and Etau, and Ram, and Osiris, for all the idols of heaven run the same course, as thou shalt prove in Orachnebuahgalah, nor is here any help for them.</p>
 <p>18. Jehovih is Omnipotent over all. He by His Almighty command came they. There are books He bestoweth upon the generations of men, but when they are of no more use to man, behold, He taketh them away and giveth instead that which is suited to the progress of the world.</p>
 <p>19. Be wise and remember thy Creator all the days of thy 1ife; be thou one with Him, and thou shalt live forever!</p>
 <p>End of Book of Knowledge.</p>
 
 <h1 align="CENTER">Book of Ouranothen</h1>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter I</h3>
 <p>1. These are the words of Ouranothen: By Thy Light and Dominion, O Jehovih, peace and goodwill be unto all men, with faith in Thee, and forbearance toward one another for thy glory. Amen.</p>
 <p>2. I come not to abridge liberty, but to give more unto you, with love and wisdom, that the resurrection of men be established on earth as it is in heaven.</p>
 <p>3. Him that ye worship under diverse names, placing him afar off, declare I unto you in actual presence. And accord to you much praise and thanks wherein ye worship in truth, fulfilling His commandments, acknowledging there is but one God, even Jehovih.</p>
 <p>4. Whether ye say, Brahma, Brahma or Buddha, Buddha, or Christ, Christ, doing so in reverence to the Almighty, our Creator, practicing good works with all your wisdom and strength--therein do I proclaim your good deeds in heaven.</p>
 <p>5. For all of these are the Father's buildings, to bring His children into ultimate resurrection, for joy and glory within His kingdoms.</p>
 <p>6. Therefore come I not to take from you any of your Gods or Saviors, nor to abridge your field for righteousness, but rather to show you a greater glory in comprehending all of them in the plan of the Almighty, to reach the different peoples in all parts of the earth.</p>
 <p>7. Pleading with you to be charitable to one another, and more comprehensive in your judgment, putting away egotism in professing amongst yourselves that such of you alone were the favored of Jehovih.</p>
 <p>8. First, then His Living Presence declare I unto you: that He is now, always was and ever shall be present in all places, worlds without end.</p>
 <p>9. Doing by virtue of His Presence; quickening into life, and moving all things onward to a wise and definite purpose.</p>
 <p>10. Whose Presence is everywhere and boundless.</p>
 <p>11. That all are not as orphans, but possessed of a Father, part and parcel of your flesh and spirit, even the Creator.</p>
 <p>12. Into whose harmony ye are as keys to one instrument, with Whom ye can become as one, by practicing His commandments.</p>
 <p>13. That herein only is there peace and happiness to any man on earth or angel in heaven.</p>
 <p>14. Second: this I also declare unto you, that wherein ye have put the Father afar off, saying such as: There is a divine law; there is a natural law--ye comprehend not the Living Presence of Jehovih, but profane Him and His works.</p>
 <p>15. For there is no divine law, nor is there a natural law.</p>
 <p>16. But all good things are accomplished by the living presence of the Creator.</p>
 <p>17. Things commonly called evil being done by striving to go against Him.</p>
 <p>18. Third, that Jehovih hath not finished His creations and retired from His works; that wherein ye have said: He tired, or He rested from His works--ye have suffered yourselves to fall, through the errors of language, into profanation of the Almighty.</p>
 <p>19. For He is also master over all weariness, and is His own everlasting rest and unrest, beyond the comprehension of mortals and angels.</p>
 <p>20. For He is forever bringing together, and forever dissolving and dissipating worlds without number.</p>
 <p>21. Illimitable in Soul and Spirit, forever quickening into life from His own parts, without loss or waste, or lack of space, and without hindrance.</p>
 <p>22. Fourth, that Jehovih is the soul of all, and that ye are as independent atoms of His Person.</p>
 <p>23. Wherein then shall man say: Behold, my people are the chosen of the Almighty! He hath singled out my people to go forth and redeem the world!</p>
 <p>24. I proclaim all people His People; and I say also, go forth and redeem the world. But not with words only, nor by the sword, nor by armies of destroyers but by peace and love, and providing remedies for the poor, and afflicted, and helpless, and distressed.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter II</h3>
 <p>1. These are the words of Ouranothen: In the name of Jehovih, peace and love unto the angels and mortals of earth.</p>
 <p>2. Because it hath been demonstrated unto you that the knowledge of man is but his own consciousness of the records that have been written on his body and spirit, so let it be testimony that the affairs of heaven and earth are registered everlastingly on the soul of man.</p>
 <p>3. Whether by his own behavior or indulgence, or by the places of his resort, so is he the book of his own dominion in the hands of Jehovih, or else against Him.</p>
 <p>4. Which shall also be testimony that the eye of the Father is ever upon all men, both in this world and the next.</p>
 <p>5. For which reason no man shall say: God cut him off--meaning Jehovih turned away from the evil man.</p>
 <p>6. Which is a profanation against the Father. For He turneth not away, nor cutteth He off any man. Nevertheless many cut themselves off by denying Him and by not obeying His commandments.</p>
 <p>7. And they bring darkness and misery upon themselves; and they cry out: Where is the justice of God, that He afflicteth me? or why cometh He not to those that are in distress?</p>
 <p>8. And when they are in darkness, they marry and bring forth in darkness and with pre-disposition to misery and death.</p>
 <p>9. For which reason it was said of old that the sins of a man are visited on the third and fourth generations of those that come after.</p>
 <p>10. And then cryeth out the infidel: Behold the misery of the creatures of God!</p>
 <p>11. But I say unto you, all these things were revealed long since, and ye are the testimonies of those that deny the wisdom and glory of Jehovih, your God.</p>
 <p>12. What then is the register of the earth? Where shall the Father find an exemplary people?</p>
 <p>13. Where ye love your neighbors as yourselves, practicing virtue and exaltation in righteousness above all else?</p>
 <p>14. For I say unto you they have cunningly interpreted the revelations of heaven so as to open the door to unrighteous teaching.</p>
 <p>15. By saying such and such things are done by divine law instead of being done by the actual presence of the Creator. Persuading themselves that their God had gone away, leaving certain laws to carry on His Works.</p>
 <p>16. And the ungodly interpreted them, that since God had gone afar off, He saw not the behavior of men. Nor registered their deeds in truth as done in the body.</p>
 <p>17. For they have been thus led to believe that sin and evil deeds are hid away, and not man, nor angels nor God knoweth what they have done.</p>
 <p>18. And they have grown up on disbelief, ignoring the person of the Almighty, even though the powers of life and death stand before them.</p>
 <p>19. Being addicted to crimes and misdemeanors against one another, in no fear of God the Father, and only restrained by the laws and prisons of man.</p>
 <p>20. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, as being afar off, declare I unto you.</p>
 <p>21. And that His Eye is ever upon you; and that ye are a perpetual register of both the good and evil that ye practice toward one another and in the Father.</p>
 <p>22. This is the foundation on which I proclaim Jehovih's kingdom on earth. Without this there is no resurrection either in this world or the next.</p>
 <p>23. And as much as ye establish this doctrine in the understanding of the young, so will ye have laid the corner stone for the edifice of Jehovih, your Creator.</p>
 <p>24. To which end ye shall put away all such terms as divine law and natural law.</p>
 <p>25. And henceforth teach them of the Living I AM, the Jehovih, who is over all and within all His Works, doing by virtue of His Presence, call Him Lord or God as ye may.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter III</h3>
 <p>1. These are the words of Ouranothen: By the power and wisdom of Jehovih in me, I salute you in peace, love and reconciliation with the Father.</p>
 <p>2. To make you magnanimous and of comprehensive judgment in discerning the dominion of Jehovih.</p>
 <p>3. That ye be not puffed up with your knowledge of the ancient prophets and revelators of God, the Father, saying: His words were revealed of old; the ancient revelations were final.</p>
 <p>4. Jehovih is the same today, yesterday and forever. His Voice and His Hands are with you; He changeth not as the wind bloweth.</p>
 <p>5. Open your understanding to the Living Present, the I AM, in remembrance of the olden times, when the prophets of God were denied also.</p>
 <p>6. For the same things come in every cycle in the travel of the world. And the same doctrines are revealed, embracing the same exalted commandments, proclaiming the actual presence of the Creator unto all men.</p>
 <p>7. But they who love not Him with all their hearts and souls, and their neighbors as themselves, cry out: We will not have this; let us crucify him.</p>
 <p>8. Now, behold, Jehovih's season is manifest amongst all nations and peoples. Do they not cry out against the skepticism of man? And are not their doctrines trembling on their foundation?</p>
 <p>9. The enthusiasm they put forth is but for a day; with the death of the preacher his church becometh as the house of a stranger.</p>
 <p>10. For they worship not the Father, but bow down before the oratory of man.</p>
 <p>11. Wherefore in this day I say unto you the time is greater than of old, for the cycle embraceth the whole earth; becoming as one people around about it, so is the light of Jehovih being manifest amongst all nations and peoples.</p>
 <p>12. And the skepticism and breaking to pieces in one region of the earth is but a type of the same manifestations in the others.</p>
 <p>13. Think not then, with the circumscribing of the earth, that Jehovih is not sufficient unto a universal doctrine, adapted to all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
 <p>14. For He plieth His angel hosts according to the work He hath on hand.</p>
 <p>15. Raising up on man to one work and another man to another work; appropriating all people to building His kingdom.</p>
 <p>16. And He sendeth His angels to man to give him signs and omens; and man saith: I feel it coming; a new advent is at hand. Of which matters the earth is stored with history.</p>
 <p>17. As when in Egypt, in the great kingdom, the Pharaohs had fortified themselves with learning and with monuments designed by man to be everlasting.</p>
 <p>18. And both, angels of darkness, and angels of light, descended upon that land, and the people were overwhelmed with miracles and necromancy.</p>
 <p>19. And the Father called unto the multitude to come out of Egypt; and as many as had faith in Him rose up and departed away from that land.</p>
 <p>20. Then came darkness upon Egypt, and she went down to destruction. Her temples and places of great learning fell down or became known no more.</p>
 <p>21. Now this declare I unto you, that the same kinds of necromancy and angel manifestations appear in the beginning of every cycle.</p>
 <p>22. For the Father suffereth even angels of darkness to appear before men to confound them in their unbelief, and to make them fearful in their unrighteous behavior.</p>
 <p>23. And this also happeneth soon after the advent of a cycle--the angels of the second heaven come, calling sinners to repentance, and proclaiming the difference between the higher and lower heavens.</p>
 <p>24. And such mortals as have faith in Jehovih, practicing righteousness, are led forth into a new place and holier condition. But such as heed not the voice of the angels of God go down in darkness.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter IV</h3>
 <p>1. The words of Ouranothen: By the grace and power of the Creator, God of all peoples, faith be unto you and within you, for your own redemption.</p>
 <p>2. First come signs and presentiments, then belief, and after that, faith, which is followed by works.</p>
 <p>3. And this law is unto all the living, whether man, or bird, or beast, or creeping thing; there being signs and presentiments unto all the living, according to what concerneth them.</p>
 <p>4. Behold the times of the heaven and earth are made of summers and winters unto all things. A time when the harvest of one revelation or one doctrine cometh to its ripening, and a time afterward when it is gathered in by the Father, and is known no more.</p>
 <p>5. To one age God bestoweth revelation on man, according to what is good for man, but when it hath fulfilled its work God gathereth it in, and bestoweth another revelation.</p>
 <p>6. Such are works of Jehovih, nor can man nor angels stay His Hand.</p>
 <p>7. To Greece, and to Egypt and to India, He gave many gods. According to the necessities of the times and light of man, that man might be raised up through belief and faith, so gave He them gods and doctrines suited to them.</p>
 <p>8. And man became tenacious of his gods, verily making idols of them, and depending on the gods and angels to accomplish by intercession and otherwise, man's ultimate exaltation in heaven.</p>
 <p>9. So man ceased to work out his own salvation, depending on his gods to save him, even in his crimes and blasphemy.</p>
 <p>10. And Jehovih caused disbelievers and signs and miracles to overrun these peoples, and He raised up new prophets unto them, rebuking them for their unrighteous behavior.</p>
 <p>11. The adherents of the past revelations rose up in might and slew the prophets of God, declaring them breakers of the laws of man.</p>
 <p>12. Nevertheless, it came to pass with all these peoples, their many gods went away from them, and the new revelations took root in the persecution and death of God's prophets.</p>
 <p>13. Such as cycles upon the earth; they are as the harvests of the Almighty, which He giveth unto the different periods of His Creations.</p>
 <p>14. Here is wisdom O man, to heed the signs of Jehovih's seasons and the march of His dominion on the earth.</p>
 <p>15. Not suffering thyself to become bound by things of the past whilst the signs of the Almighty rise up before thee.</p>
 <p>16. Nor judge thou the ways of God by the little that is done in a corner, nor of prejudices deep-rooted in thine own understanding, because of thy birth and surroundings.</p>
 <p>17. But survey thou abroad over all the earth, considering what is good unto all people, as to whether the doctrines and revelations are powerful enough to abolish poverty and war and manner of crimes amongst men.</p>
 <p>18. This the guide thy Creator gave unto thee, that thou mightst learn to prophesy of the administration of thy God, Jehovih, being the only master of life and death (because whosoever He hath quickened into life is His, and death is His decree in His own time and way).</p>
 <p>19. And whosoever cometh between man and his Creator, visiting death unto his brother, wageth war against his Creator.</p>
 <p>20. Life and death are Mine, saith Jehovih.</p>
 <p>21. Who then presumeth to engage in death no longer fulfilled the righteousness of God.</p>
 <p>22. In which sign thou shalt judge all people who engage in war, and know of a truth whether their doctrines and their gods be appropriate to establishing the Father's kingdom on earth.</p>
 <p>23. Not suffering thyself to be blinded by their pretensions and professions of peace, but by their practice, observing if they have more faith in weapons of war and standing armies than in Jehovih.</p>
 <p>24. This is one of the signs also, in addition to infidelity and necromancy, wherefrom thou shalt surely prophesy that the doctrines and revelations have fulfilled their time unto mortals.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER">Chapter V</h3>
 <p>1. The words of Ouranothen: In the love of God, peace and goodwill be unto you all, Amen.</p>
 <p>2. In times past, the Almighty hath bestowed His signs and monuments and histories, whereby ye shall understand the dominion of His Word.</p>
 <p>3. Because the ancients were bound down by the doctrines and revelations of their predecessors, Jehovih suffered evil disposed men to fall upon their libraries and destroy them.</p>
 <p>4. And man mourned on the earth, saying the light of heaven was consumed.</p>
 <p>5. But Jehovih comprehended what was good for man, desiring him not to be bound down to the ancients; but rather that man should be quickened to the Ever Present Light of God.</p>
 <p>6. For man had become like a drowning man clinging to that which was taking him down under the water. So, only by the destruction of the ancient records could man be persuaded to turn to that which is Ever-Present, even Jehovih.</p>
 <p>7. And the like condition hath ever come unto all the ancient gods and men; for men fear to let go from that which is carrying them further and further away from their Creator.</p>
 <p>8. This do I also declare unto you; the sum of revelation in each and every cycle hath been to bring man nearer and nearer to the comprehension of the Ever-Present; to make man know that Jehovih now is, even as He was with the ancients.</p>
 <p>9. That man might ultimately have his understanding open, so as to receive his own revelations from his Creator, and from the angels of God.</p>
 <p>10. Such being, in fact, the founding of His kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.</p>
 <p>11. Since then direct inspiration shall come from the Father unto all men, how hope ye not to be bound by the revelations of the prophets of old?</p>
 <p>12. The same Creator now is, always was and ever shall be.</p>
 <p>13. To be as near Him, and as much in Him, and as much one with Him, as were the ancient prophets, shall ye not also be one with the Father, to prophecy and to accomplish good works?</p>
 <p>14. For if God, the Father, be ever the same, and ye fulfill His requirements as did the ancient prophets, the same result shall happen unto you as to them.</p>
 <p>15. To quicken man, therefore, to enter into the living present, instead of leaving him as a follower of the ancient light, is the work of your God.</p>
 <p>16. Whereto ye shall join in wisdom and earnestness regardless of self-sacrifice.</p>
 <p>17. Now, therefore, when the signs of decadence in the old systems manifest themselves, as for example, when those who are of good mind and sound judgment, having been believers in the ancient doctrines and revelations, but afterward turn away from them because the doctrines are impotent, ye shall know of a truth a new cycle is at hand.</p>
