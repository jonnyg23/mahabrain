 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Flourished about</span> A.D. 700</p>  
 <p><small>One of the earliest distinguished poets of Japan. He was the rival  of Hitómaro. He accompanied the Mikado Shoran. to Kii; and afterwards visited the Eastland, where he composed the well-known lines to Fuji.</small></p>  <h3 align="center">ON WAKA'S SHORE</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Akáhito—7th Century</span></p>  
 <p>On Waka's shore<br>   The tide comes flowing.<br> No resting-place<br>   Above the waters showing,<br> Towards the reeds<br>   The cranes are swiftly flying,<br> All the night sky<br>   Resonant with their crying.</p>

 <p>By Tago's shore, I wander to and fro,<br>   Gazing on Fuji's peak, where Autumn's earliest snow,<br>     White-gleaming, sparkles.</p>  <h3 align="center">ON PASSING THE TOMB OF THE MAID OF MAMA</h3>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Akáhito</span></p>  
 <p>Fair was the Maid who dwelt in olden time<br> In Mama village—and well wooed was she.<br> Exchanged were Shidzu girdles. Bride-hut built,<br> And here among dense maki leafage hid,<br>      There lay her tomb.<br> Long as the pine endures, her piteous tale,<br> The record of her sorrows shall endure<br> Engraven on my heart compassionate.<br> Still the smooth sea-wrack floats upon the tide,<br> In the clear waters of Kátsushika.<br> How oft the shining tendrils from the sea<br> Hath the fair maid of Mama gathered!</p>

 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Kamo no Kimitari-Hito</span></p>  
 <p>The Spring mists hover round the hill,<br> The Hill of Kagu, where of old<br> The Gods descended, sacred still.<br> The pine-breeze murmurs through the wold;<br> A little ripple grows, and fades,<br> As the light air the clear pool stirs.<br> The cherry blooms still star the glades,<br> Mist-wreaths of blossom ’mid dark firs.<br> The wild duck seeks his mate, the teal<br> Rise from the reeds on whirring wings,<br> But on the lake no cleaving keel<br> Over the shining water swings.<br> Empty, the pleasure-barges lie,<br> Oarless and desolate they float;<br> No more for waiting courtiers ply,<br> As in Imperial days remote.</p>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ENVOY</span></p>  
 <p>On the straight cedar-shafts the moss grows green,<br> Witness how long this solitude has been!</p>

 <p align="center">(From the "Manyôshiu "—Lay 78)</p>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Kuramochi no Asomi Chitosē</span></p>  
 <p>By the wide sea, wherein the great whales dwell,<br> Pleasant it is to wander o’er the shore,<br> And watch the seaweed tendrils undulate<br> In the green depths translucent, to and fro.<br> Fair 'tis to see the thousand ripples gleam,<br> In endless sequence in the morning calm;<br> And in the eventide to watch the curves<br> Of myriad wavelets breaking ceaselessly;<br> While always from the depths of ocean rolls<br> Through months and years the ever-heaving swell.<br> Pleasant it is on Suminoyé's strand<br> To watch the great white combers break in foam</p>  
 <p align="center">SIGHS</p>  
 <p>The mists that drift across the hill—<br> High Hill of Ohonu—<br> They are my sighs that hover chill,<br> Of sorrow born across the hill—<br> High Hill of Ohonu!</p>

 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By Tanobe Sakimaro</span></p>  
 <p align="center">(From the "Manyôshiu"—A.D. 744)</p>  
 <p>Gentle the rise of wooded hills,<br> The rapid's murmur pleasant falls,<br> With rippled song and rushing trills<br> There by Futagi's Palace walls,<br> Where our great Prince and sacred Lord<br>         Rules as he wills.</p>  
 <p>Long as in Spring, when soft and clear,<br> The warblers’ liquid love-song flows,<br> Upon the rocks resplendent flung,<br> The rich brocade of blossom glows,<br> Brightening the sombre mountain-foot<br>         With gold and rose.</p>  
 <p>Long as in Autumn when afar<br> Unto his mate the proud stag calls,<br> From the brown boughs, a crimson star,<br> Trailing to earth, the red leaf falls,<br> Hurt by the rainy gusts that sweep<br>         Through Heaven's blue halls.</p>  
 <p>So while a thousand years go by,<br> Still may His life endure, august,<br> While the great Palace shall defy<br> Ages where Empires turn to dust.<br> Still may the Gods preserve His sway<br>         Imperial, just!</p>

 <p align="center">(Lay 117 from the "Manyôshiu"—A.D. 728)</p>  
 <p>Heavy the burden of this Life to bear!<br> By some strange chance we come into this world;<br> Yet, live or die, for us one Duty still<br> Shines through the dark perplexities of earth,<br> Obedience to the bidding of our Lord!<br> Therefore, O friend I while yet thy mortal frame<br> Dwells in this world, liege-loyal must thou bide<br> To thy great Sovereign—thou who farest forth<br> Guard to the distant frontier far away,<br> With a great company—as wild-fowl flock,<br> Winging their flight in the pale shine of Dawn!<br> Forget not thou, in far-flung wilds thy friend<br> Left far behind in the City-Royal here,<br> Whose love is thine, tho’ long thine absence be!</p>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Envoy</span></p>  
 <p>To Koshi as thou farest, crossing hills<br> Steep and snow-clad, thy friend remember still<br> Who, left behind, ever remembers thee I</p>

 <p align="center">(From the "Manyôshiu.")</p>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">By One of the Ladies of the Court</span></p>  
 <p>I may not follow where my Lord<br> Blissful ascends to Heaven's high plant;<br> But, far from Him whom I adored,<br> My sleeve is wet with bitter rain—<br> Earthly and mortal I abide<br> From His dear Presence sundered wide.</p>  
 <p>Were I a jewelled ornament,<br> A vesture, an embroidered sleeve,<br> I had not been so rudely rent<br> From Him I saw but yester-eve<br> In a dream-vision—Heaven-seat.</p>
