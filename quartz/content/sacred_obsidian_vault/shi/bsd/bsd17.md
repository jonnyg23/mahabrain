 <p>OF these two institutions (the former known as <i>hara-kiri</i> and the latter as <i>kataki-uchi</i>), many foreign writers have treated more or less fully.</p> 
 <p>To begin with suicide, let me state that I confine my observations only to <i>seppuku</i> or <i>kappuku</i>, popularly known as <i>hara-kiri</i>--which means self-immolation by disembowelment. "Ripping the abdomen? How absurd!"--so cry those to whom the name is new. Absurdly odd as it may sound at first to foreign ears, it cannot be so very foreign to students of Shakespeare, who puts these words in Brutus's mouth--"Thy [Caesar's] spirit walks abroad and turns our swords into our proper entrails." Listen to a modern</p> 
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></a></p> 
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> English poet who, in his <i>Light of Asia</i>, speaks of a sword piercing the bowels of a queen;--none blames him for bad English or breach of modesty. Or, to take still another example, look at Guercino's painting of Cato's death in the Palazzo Rossa, in Genoa. Whoever has read the swan-song which Addison makes Cato sing, will not jeer at the sword half-buried in his abdomen. In our minds this mode of death is associated with instances of noblest deeds and of most touching pathos, so that nothing repugnant, much less ludicrous, mars our conception of it. So wonderful is the transforming power of virtue, of greatness. of tenderness, that the vilest form of death assumes a sublimity and becomes a symbol of new life, or else the sign which Constantine beheld would not conquer the world!</p> 
 <p>Not for extraneous associations only does <i>seppuku</i> lose in our mind any taint of absurdity; for the choice of this particular part of the body to operate upon, was based on an old anatomical belief as to the seat of the soul and of the affections. When Moses</p> 
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></a></p> 
 <p>wrote of Joseph's "bowels yearning upon his brother," or David prayed the Lord not to forget his bowels, or when Isaiah, Jeremiah, and other inspired men of old spoke of the "sounding" or the "troubling" of bowels, they all and each endorsed the belief prevalent among the Japanese that in the abdomen was enshrined the soul. The Semites habitually spoke of the liver and kidneys and surrounding fat as the seat of emotion and of life. The term "<i>hara</i>" was more comprehensive than the Greek <i>phren</i> or <i>thumos</i>, and the Japanese and Hellenese alike thought the spirit of man to dwell somewhere in that region. Such a notion is by no means confined to the peoples of antiquity. The French, in spite of the theory propounded by one of their most distinguished philosophers, Descartes, that the soul is located in the pineal gland, still insist in using the term <i>ventre</i> in a sense which, if anatomically too vague, is nevertheless physiologically significant. Similarly, <i>entrailles</i> stands in their language for affection and compassion. Nor is such a belief mere</p> 
 <p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></a></p> 
 <p>superstition, being more scientific than the general idea of making the heart the centre of the feelings. Without asking a friar, the Japanese knew better than Romeo "in what vile part of this anatomy one's name did lodge." Modern neurologists speak of the abdominal and pelvic brains, denoting thereby sympathetic nerve centres in those parts which are strongly affected by any psychical action. This view of mental physiology once admitted, the syllogism of <i>seppuku</i> is easy to construct. "I will open the seat of my soul and show you how it fares with it. See for yourself whether it is polluted or clean."</p> 
 <p>I do not wish to be understood as asserting religious or even moral justification of suicide, but the high estimate placed upon honour was ample excuse with many for taking one's own life. How many acquiesced in the sentiment expressed by Garth,</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>"When honour's lost, 't is a relief to die;<br> Death's but a sure retreat from infamy,"</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>and have smilingly surrendered their souls to</p> 
 <p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></a></p> 
 <p>oblivion! Death involving a question of honour, was accepted in Bushido as a key to the solution of many complex problems, so that to an ambitious samurai a natural departure from life seemed a rather tame affair and a consummation not devoutly to be wished for. I dare say that many good Christians, if only they are honest enough, will confess the fascination of, if not positive admiration for, the sublime composure with which Cato, Brutus, Petronius, and a host of other ancient worthies terminated their own earthly existence. Is it too bold to hint that the death of the first of the philosophers was partly suicidal? When we are told so minutely by his pupils how their master willingly submitted to the mandate of the state--which he knew was morally mistaken--in spite of the possibilities of escape, and how he took the cup of hemlock in his own hand, even offering libation from its deadly contents, do we not discern, in his whole proceeding and demeanour, an act of self-immolation? No physical compulsion here, as in ordinary</p> 
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></a></p> 
 <p>cases of execution. True, the verdict of the judges was compulsory: it said, "Thou shalt die,--and that by thine own hand." If suicide meant no more than dying by one's own hand, Socrates was a clear case of suicide. But nobody would charge him with the crime; Plato, who was averse to it, would not call his master a suicide.</p> 
 <p>Now my readers will understand that <i>seppuku</i> was not a mere suicidal process. It was an institution, legal and ceremonial. An invention of the middle ages, it was a process by which warriors could expiate their crimes, apologise for errors, escape from disgrace, redeem their friends, or prove their sincerity. When enforced as a legal punishment, it was practised with due ceremony. It was a refinement of self-destruction, and none could perform it without the utmost coolness of temper and composure of demeanour, and for these reasons it was particularly befitting the profession of bushi.</p> 
 <p>Antiquarian curiosity, if nothing else, would tempt me to give here a description of this</p> 
 <p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="green">p. 117</font></a></p> 
 <p>obsolete ceremony; but seeing that such a description was made by a far abler writer, whose book is not much read nowadays, I am tempted to make a somewhat lengthy quotation. Mitford, in his <i>Tales of Old Japan</i>, after giving a translation of a treatise on <i>seppuku</i> from a rare Japanese manuscript, goes on to describe an instance of such an execution of which he was an eye-witness:</p> 
 <p>"We (seven foreign representatives) were invited to follow the Japanese witnesses into the <i>hondo</i> or main hall of the temple, where the ceremony was to be performed. It was an imposing scene. A large hall with a high roof supported by dark pillars of wood. From the ceiling hung a profusion of those huge gilt lamps and ornaments peculiar to Buddhist temples. In front of the high altar, where the floor, covered with beautiful white mats, is raised some three or four inches from the ground, was laid a rug of scarlet felt. Tall candles placed at regular intervals gave out a dim mysterious light, just sufficient to let all the proceedings be seen. The seven Japanese took their places on the left of the raised floor, the seven foreigners on the right. No other person was present.</p> 
 <p>"After the interval of a few minutes of anxious suspense, Taki Zenzaburo, a stalwart man thirty-two years of age, with a noble air, walked into the</p> 
 <p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="green">p. 118</font></a></p> 
 <p>hall attired in his dress of ceremony, with the peculiar hempen-cloth wings which are worn on great occasions. He was accompanied by a <i>kaishaku</i> and three officers, who wore the <i>jimbaori</i> or war surcoat with gold tissue facings. The word <i>kaishaku</i>, it should be observed, is one to which our word executioner is no equivalent term. The office is that of a gentleman; in many cases it is performed by a kinsman or friend of the condemned, and the relation between them is rather that of principal and second than that of victim and executioner. In this instance, the <i>kaishaku</i> was a pupil of Taki Zenzaburo, and was selected by friends of the latter from among their own number for his skill in swordsmanship.</p> 
 <p>"With the <i>kaishaku</i> on his left hand, Taki Zenzaburo advanced slowly toward the Japanese witnesses, and the two bowed before them, then drawing near to the foreigners they saluted us in the same way, perhaps even with more deference; in each case the salutation was ceremoniously returned. Slowly and with great dignity the condemned man mounted on to the raised floor, prostrated himself before the high altar twice, and seated <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">1</font></a> himself on the felt carpet with his back to the high altar, the <i>kaishaku</i> crouching on his left-hand side. One of the three attendant officers then came forward, bearing a stand of the kind used in the temple for offerings, on which,</p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 119</font></a></p> 
 <p>wrapped in paper, lay the <i>wakizashi</i>, the short sword or dirk of the Japanese, nine inches and a half in length, with a point and an edge as sharp as a razor's. This he handed, prostrating himself, to the condemned man, who received it reverently raising it to his head with both hands, and placed it in front of himself.</p> 
 <p>"After another profound obeisance, Taki Zenzaburo, in a voice which betrayed just so much emotion and hesitation as might be expected from a man who is making a painful confession, but with no sign of either in his face or manner, spoke as follows:--</p> 
 <p>"'I, and I alone, unwarrantably gave the order to fire on the foreigners at Kobe, and again as they tried to escape. For this crime I disembowel myself, and I beg you who are present to do me the honour of witnessing the act.'</p> 
 <p>"Bowing once more, the speaker allowed his upper garments to slip down to his girdle, and remained naked to the waist. Carefully, according to custom, he tucked his sleeves under his knees to prevent himself from falling backward; for a noble Japanese gentleman should die falling forwards. Deliberately, with a steady hand he took the dirk that lay before him; he looked at it wistfully, almost affectionately; for a moment he seemed to collect his thoughts for the last time, and then stabbing himself deeply below the waist in the left-hand side, he drew the dirk slowly across to his right side, and turning it in the wound, gave a slight cut upwards. During this sickeningly painful operation he never moved a muscle of his face.</p> 
 <p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></a></p> 
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> When he drew out the dirk, he leaned forward and stretched out his neck; an expression of pain for the first time crossed his face, but he uttered no sound. At that moment the <i>kaishaku</i>, who, still crouching by his side, had been keenly watching his every movement, sprang to his feet, poised his sword for a second in the air; there was a flash, a heavy, ugly thud, a crashing fall; with one blow the head had been severed from the body.</p> 
 <p>"A dead silence followed, broken only by the hideous noise of the blood throbbing out of the inert heap before us, which but a moment before had been a brave and chivalrous man. It was horrible.</p> 
 <p>"The <i>kaishaku</i> made a low bow, wiped his sword with a piece of paper which he had ready for the purpose, and retired from the raised floor; and the stained dirk was solemnly borne away, a bloody proof of the execution.</p> 
 <p>"The two representatives of the Mikado then left their places, and crossing over to where the foreign witnesses sat, called to us to witness that the sentence of death upon Taki Zenzaburo had been faithfully carried out. The ceremony being at an end, we left the temple."</p> 
 <p>I might multiply any number of descriptions of <i>seppuku</i> from literature or from the relations of eye-witnesses; but one more instance will suffice.</p> 
 <p>Two brothers, Sakon and Naiki, respectively</p> 
 <p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></a></p> 
 <p>twenty-four and seventeen years of age, made an effort to kill Iyéyasu in order to avenge their father's wrongs; but before they could enter the camp they were made prisoners. The old general admired the pluck of the youths who dared an attempt on his life and ordered that they should be allowed to die an honourable death. Their little brother Hachimaro, a mere infant of eight summers, was condemned to a similar fate, as the sentence was pronounced on all the male members of the family, and the three were taken to a monastery where it was to be executed. A physician who was present on the occasion has left us a diary, from which the following scene is translated:</p> 
 <p>"When they were all seated in a row for final despatch, Sakon turned to the youngest and said--'Go thou first, for I wish to be sure that thou doest it aright.' Upon the little one's replying that, as he had never seen <i>seppuku</i> performed, he would like to see his brothers do it and then he could follow them, the older brothers smiled between their tears:--'Well said, little fellow! So canst thou well boast of being our father's child.' When they had placed him between them, Sakon thrust</p> 
 <p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="green">p. 122</font></a></p> 
 <p>the dagger into the left side of his abdomen and said--'Look brother! Dost understand now? Only, don't push the dagger too far, lest thou fall back. Lean forward, rather, and keep thy knees well composed.' Naiki did likewise and said to the boy--'Keep thine eyes open or else thou mayst look like a dying woman. If thy dagger feels anything within and thy strength fails, take courage and double thy effort to cut across.' The child looked from one to the other, and, when both had expired, he calmly half denuded himself and followed the example set him on either hand."</p> 
 <p>The glorification of <i>seppuku</i> offered, naturally enough, no small temptation to its unwarranted committal. For causes entirely incompatible with reason, or for reasons entirely undeserving of death, hot-headed youths rushed into it as insects fly into fire; mixed and dubious motives drove more samurai to this deed than nuns into convent gates. Life was cheap--cheap as reckoned by the popular standard of honour. The saddest feature was that honour, which was always in the <i>agio</i>, so to speak, was not always solid gold, but alloyed with baser metals. No one circle in the Inferno will boast of greater density of Japanese population than the</p> 
 <p><a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></a></p> 
 <p>seventh, to which Dante consigns all victims of self-destruction!</p> 
 <p>And yet, for a true samurai to hasten death or to court it, was alike cowardice. A typical fighter, when he lost battle after battle and was pursued from plain to hill and from bush to cavern, found himself hungry and alone in the dark hollow of a tree, his sword blunt with use, his bow broken and arrows exhausted--did not the noblest of the Romans fall upon his own sword in Philippi under like circumstances?--deemed it cowardly to die, but, with a fortitude approaching a Christian martyr's, cheered himself with an impromptu verse:</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>"Come! evermore come,<br>   Ye dread sorrows and pains!<br> And heap on my burden'd back;<br> That I not one test may lack<br>   Of what strength in me remains!"</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>This, then, was the Bushido teaching--Bear and face all calamities and adversities with patience and a pure conscience; for, as Mencius <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">1</font></a> taught, "When Heaven is about to</p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></a></p> 
 <p>confer a great office on anyone, it first exercises his mind with suffering and his sinews and bones with toil; it exposes his body to hunger and subjects him to extreme poverty: and it confounds his undertakings. In all these ways it stimulates his mind, hardens his nature, and supplies his incompetencies." True honour lies in fulfilling Heaven's decree and no death incurred in so doing is ignominious, whereas, death to avoid what Heaven has in store is cowardly indeed! In that quaint book of Sir Thomas Browne's, <i>Religio Medici</i>, there is an exact English equivalent for what is repeatedly taught in our Precepts. Let me quote it: "It is a brave act of valour to contemn death, but where life is more terrible than death, it is then the truest valour to dare to live." A renowned priest of the seventeenth century satirically observed--"Talk as he may, a samurai who ne'er has died is apt in decisive moments to flee or hide." Again--"Him who once has died in the bottom of his breast, no spears of Sanada nor all the arrows of Tametomo can pierce."</p> 
 <p><a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="green">p. 125</font></a></p> 
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> How near we come to the portals of the temple whose Builder taught "He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it"! These are but a few of the numerous examples that tend to confirm the moral identity of the human species, notwithstanding an attempt so assiduously made to render the distinction between Christian and Pagan as great as possible.</p> 
 <p>We have thus seen that the Bushido institution of suicide was neither so irrational nor barbarous as its abuse strikes us at first sight. We will now see whether its sister institution of Redress--or call it Revenge, if you will--has its mitigating features. I hope I can dispose of this question in a few words, since a similar institution, or call it custom, if that suits you better, prevailed among all peoples and has not yet become entirely obsolete, as attested by the continuance of duelling and lynching. Why, has not an American captain recently challenged Esterhazy, that the wrongs of Dreyfus be avenged? Among a savage tribe which has</p> 
 <p><a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="green">p. 126</font></a></p> 
 <p>no marriage, adultery is not a sin, and only the jealousy of a lover protects a woman from abuse; so in a time which has no criminal court, murder is not a crime, and only the vigilant vengeance of the victim's people preserves social order. "What is the most beautiful thing on earth?" said Osiris to Horus. The reply was, "To avenge a parent's wrongs,"--to which a Japanese would have added "and a master's."</p> 
 <p>In revenge there is something which satisfies one's sense of justice. The avenger reasons:--"My good father did not deserve death. He who killed him did great evil. My father, if he were alive, would not tolerate a deed like this: Heaven itself hates wrongdoing. It is the will of my father; it is the will of Heaven that the evil-doer cease from his work. He must perish by my hand; because he shed my father's blood, I, who am his flesh and blood, must shed the murderer's. The same Heaven shall not shelter him and me." The ratiocination is simple and childish (though we know Hamlet did not reason</p> 
 <p><a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="green">p. 127</font></a></p> 
 <p>much more deeply); nevertheless it shows an innate sense of exact balance and equal justice. "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." Our sense of revenge is as exact as our mathematical faculty, and until both terms of the equation are satisfied we cannot get over the sense of something left undone.</p> 
 <p>In Judaism, which believed in a jealous God, or in Greek mythology, which provided a Nemesis, vengeance may be left to superhuman agencies; but common sense furnished Bushido with the institution of redress as a kind of ethical court of equity, where people could take cases not to be judged in accordance with ordinary law. The master of the forty-seven Ronins was condemned to death; he had no court of higher instance to appeal to; his faithful retainers addressed themselves to vengeance, the only Supreme Court existing; they in their turn were condemned by common law,--but the popular instinct passed a different judgment, and hence their memory is still kept as green and fragrant as are their graves at Sengakuji to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 128</font></a></p> 
 <p>Though Lâo-tse taught to recompense injury with kindness, the voice of Confucius was very much louder, which taught that injury must be recompensed with justice;--and yet revenge was justified only when it was undertaken in behalf of our superiors and benefactors. One's own wrongs, including injuries done to wife and children, were to be borne and forgiven. A samurai could therefore fully sympathise with Hannibal's oath to avenge his country's wrongs, but he scorns James Hamilton for wearing in his girdle a handful of earth from his wife's grave, as an eternal incentive to avenge her wrongs on the Regent Murray.</p> 
 <p>Both of these institutions of suicide and redress lost their <i>raison d'être</i> at the promulgation of the Criminal Code. No more do we hear of romantic adventures of a fair maiden as she tracks in disguise the murderer of her parent. No more can we witness tragedies of family vendetta enacted. The knight errantry of Miyamoto Musashi is now a tale of the past. The well-ordered police</p> 
 <p><a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="green">p. 129</font></a></p> 
 <p>spies out the criminal for the injured party and the law metes out justice. The whole state and society will see that wrong is righted. The sense of justice satisfied, there is no need of <i>kataki-uchi</i>. If this had meant that "hunger of the heart which feeds upon the hope of glutting that hunger with the life blood of the victim," as a New England divine has described it, a few paragraphs in the Criminal Code would not so entirely have made an end of it.</p> 
 <p>As to <i>seppuku</i>, though it too has no <i>existence de jure</i>, we still hear of it from time to time, and shall continue to hear, I am afraid, as long as the past is remembered. Many painless and time-saving methods of self-immolation will come in vogue, as its votaries are increasing with fearful rapidity throughout the world; but Professor Morselli will have to concede to <i>seppuku</i> an aristocratic position among them. He maintains that "when suicide is accomplished by very painful means or at the cost of prolonged agony, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, it may be</p> 
 <p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="green">p. 130</font></a></p> 
 <p>assigned as the act of a mind disordered by fanaticism, by madness, or by morbid excitement." <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">1</font></a> But a normal <i>seppuku</i> does not savour of fanaticism, or madness or excitement, utmost <i>sang froid</i> being necessary to its successful accomplishment. Of the two kinds into which Dr. Strahan <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">2</font></a> divides suicide, the Rational or Quasi, and the Irrational or True, <i>seppuku</i> is the best example of the former type.</p> 
 <p>From these bloody institutions, as well as from the general tenor of Bushido, it is easy to infer that the sword played an important part in social discipline and life. The saying passed as an axiom which called the sword the soul of the samurai.</p>
