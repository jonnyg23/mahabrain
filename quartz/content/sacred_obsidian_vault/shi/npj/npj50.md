 <h3 align="CENTER">HOTOKE NO HARA</h3>
 <p align="CENTER">By SEAMI</p>
 <p>GIO was the mistress of Kiyomori (1118-1181), the greatest of the Tairas. One day there arrived at his camp a famous dancing-.girl called Hotoke. Kiyomori was for sending her away; but Giō, who had heard wonderful stories of Hotoke's beauty, was anxious to see her, and persuaded Kiyomori to let Hotoke dance before him.</p>
 <p>Kiyomori fell in love with the dancer, and after a while Giō was dismissed. She became a nun, and with her mother and sister lived in a hut in the wilds of Sagano.</p>
 <p>Hotoke, full of remorse at her rival's dismissal, found no pleasure in her new honours, and saying "It was I who brought her to this," fled in nun's clothing to the hut at Sagano. Here the four women lived together, singing ceaseless prayers to Buddha.</p>
 <p>In the play the ghost of Hotoke appears to a "travelling priest" and tells the story, which is indeed a curious and arresting one.</p>
