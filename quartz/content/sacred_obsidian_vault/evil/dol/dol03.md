 <p>THE declaration of the Evil Spirit could not to make a great commotion, and to have results which required precautions to be taken at once. The Canon, like a wise man, put himself in communication with Justice, and informed the magistrates of what was passing at the convent, on the 11th October, 1632. Grandier, prepared for all contingencies, had already taken his measures. Many of the magistrates belonged to the new religion and were favourable to him, looking upon him as a secret adherent; they served him as he expected. At the same time, he made all possible use of his extraordinary talents for pettifogging, presented petition on petition, questioned every statement of the exorcists and of the nuns, threatened their confessor</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Mignon, complained that his reputation was attacked, and that the means were thus taken from him of doing the good his position required, and demanded that the nuns should be locked up and the exorcisms be put an end to. He knew well enough that his demands were out of the question, and that civil justice has nothing to do with the exercise of religious functions. But he wished, if possible, to embarrass the exorcists, and commit the judges with the bishops, or, at any rate, throw discord among them, and give his Calvinists an opportunity of crying out; he succeeded.</p>  
 <p>The magistrates separated. Only those who were favourable to him remained: the rest ceased to appear at the exorcisms, and Mignon soon withdrew from the convent. Excitement rose in the public mind, a thousand arguments on this or that side permeated the town, and a thousand quarrels took place on all sides.</p>  
 <p>This excitement, however, and these disputes settled nothing, and the exorcisms, which continued, had no better result. Grandier triumphed, and his friends admired his wit, his skill, and proclaimed aloud that he could be convicted of nothing, not even as regards women, although they knew well how far he had gone in this matter. Until now, the Court had taken no notice of the affair; but the noise it had made in</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></a></p>  
 <p>the world since the first days of October 1632 had reached the Queen's ears. She requested information, and the Abbé Marescot, one of her chaplains, was sent to examine into the matter and report to her. He arrived at Loudun on the 28th November, and witnessed what was going on. No immediate consequences followed: but an incident soon occurred, which caused a sudden change in the position of affairs.</p>  
 <p>The King had resolved to raze the castles and fortresses existing in the heart of the kingdom, and commissioned M. de Laubardemont to see to the demolition of that of Loudun. He arrived, and saw what a ferment the town was in, the animosity that reigned there, and the kind of man who caused the commotion. The complaints of those who were victims of the debaucheries, of the pride, or of the vengeance of the curate, touched him, and it seemed to him important to put an end to the scandal. On his return he informed the King and the Cardinal-Minister of the facts: Louis XIII., naturally pious and just, perceived the greatness of the evil, and deemed it his duty to put a stop to it. He appointed M. de Laubardemont to investigate the matter without appeal; with orders to choose in the neighbouring jurisdictions the most straightforward and learned judges. The Commission is dated 30th November, 1633.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></a></p>  
 <p>Nothing less was needed to bring to justice a man upheld by a seditious and enterprising party, and so well versed in the details of <i>chicannerie:</i> an art always shameful in any man, but especially to an ecclesiastic. The King issued at the same time two decrees, to arrest and imprison Grandier and his accomplices. Armed with such powers, the Commissioner did not fear to attack a man who had so often succeeded in gaining either a nonsuit on some question of form, or in turning accusations to his own advantage, or else dragging out proceedings to such a length as to weary his adversaries and his judges.</p>  
 <p>The Calvinists, already irritated at the razing of the Castle which served them as a rallying place in times of rebellion, cried out against this new tribunal, because they saw that it was the sole means of rendering useless the knaveries of their friend. But they cried out much louder when the Commissioner arrested the accused, without waiting for informations, and seized all his papers. As if it were not well known that, in criminal matters, this mode of proceeding is usual. In this case it was absolutely necessary. For, without this precaution, Grandier might have fled, and defended himself from afar, engaging the attention of judges, who had plenty of work elsewhere. He might even have raised tumults in the city, which might have necessitated violent remedies.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></a></p>  
 <p>These precautions being taken, the Commissioner commenced his investigation, and proceeded to hear witnesses on the 17th December, 7633.</p>  
 <p>The Commissioner now learned of what Grandier and his party were capable. The witnesses were so intimidated that none would speak, and it required all the Royal Authority to reassure them. He therefore issued a proclamation forbidding the intimidation of witnesses, under penalty of prosecution; and the Bishop of Poitiers having supported the King's decision, the two priests, Gervais Méchin and Martin Boulieau, who had been forced to retract their evidence in the former trial, presented a petition in which they declared that they had been seduced and constrained by several persons in authority to recall their evidence, and they now affirmed their first evidence to be true. The evidence of the nuns was also heard, and that of lay persons of both sexes, amongst others of two women, the one of whom confessed having had criminal relations with Grandier, and that he had offered to make her Princess of Magicians, whilst the second confirmed the evidence of the first. <a name="fr_6"></a><a href="#fn_6"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></a></p>  
 <p>As regards the nuns, they deposed that Grandier had introduced himself into the convent by day <a name="page_v2_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></a> and night for four months, without anyone knowing how he got in; that he presented himself to <a name="page_v2_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></a> them whilst standing at divine service and tempted them to indecent actions both by word and deed; <a name="page_v2_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></a> that they were often struck by invisible persons; and that the marks of the blows were so visible <a name="page_v2_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></a> that the doctors and surgeons had easily found them, and that the beginning of all these troubles <a name="page_v2_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></a> was signalized by the apparition of Prior Moussaut, their first confessor. The Mother Superior and <a name="page_v2_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></a> seven or eight other nuns, when confronted with Grandier, identified him, although it was ascertained <a name="page_v2_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></a> that they had never seen him save by magic, and that he had never had anything to do <a name="page_v2_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></a> with their affairs. The two women formerly mentioned and the two priests maintained the <a name="page_v2_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></a> truth of their evidence. In a word, besides the nuns and six lay women, "sixty witnesses deposed <a name="page_v2_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></a> to adulteries, incests, sacrileges, and other crimes, committed by the accused, even in the most secret <a name="page_v2_21"><font size="1" color="green">p. 21</font></a> places of his church, as in the vestry, where the Holy Host was kept, on all days and at all hours."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></a></p>  
 <p>It may well be imagined that the mother, brothers and friends of the accused did not <a name="page_v2_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></a> abandon him. They appealed to every possible authority. The details of these proceedings would be as wearisome as useless, as the Commissioner, by the very terms of his Commission, was placed above all such dilatory pettifogging, and therefore refused or annulled all applications in that direction. He then questioned the accused as to the facts and articles of accusation, and after, having made hint sign his confessions and denials, proceeded to Paris to inform the Court of what he had done.</p>  
 <p>The King and his Council thought it right to furnish him with means to overcome all obstacles to a speedy decision. This precaution was necessary, for letters from the Bailly of Loudun, Grandier's chief supporter, to the Procurator-General of the Parliament, were intercepted, in which it was asserted that the "possession" was an imposter. The latter's reply was also seized. Monsieur de Laubardemont returned therefore to Loudun with a Decree of the Council, dated 31st</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> May 1634, confirming all his powers and <i>prohibiting Parliament and all other judges from interfering in this business, and forbidding all parties concerned from appealing, under penalty of a fine of five hundred livres</i>. He caused Grandier to be transferred from the prison of Augers to that of <a href="errata.htm#6">Loudun</a>, so as to have him at hand to confront with witnesses, if need be.</p>  
 <p>But, first of all, he considered it necessary to examine the nuns carefully; for this purpose, with the consent of the Bishop, he sequestrated them in different convents, and interrogated them so severely that one might have thought that they themselves were the magicians. "He saw them all, the one after the other, for several days; and listened to their conversations, to observe their mode of thought. He enquired minutely into their lives, their morals, their behavior, not only secular but religious. His depositions, or notes, which represented the evidence of twenty girls, including a few not nuns, filled fifty rolls of official paper, and were the admiration of all judges, so great was the prudence and care they demonstrated."</p>  
 <p>On the other hand the Bishop of Poitiers, after having sent several Doctors of Theology to examine the victims, came to Loudun in person, and exorcised them himself, or had them exorcised by others in his presence for two months and a</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></a></p>  
 <p>half. Never was work done with such care and attention.</p>  
 <p>All precognitions over, the Commissioner began to confront the accused with the witnesses, and the latter maintained, face to face with Grandier, the evidence they had given against him.</p>  
 <p>As regard the nuns, it was observed that they never contradicted themselves, whether questioned together or separately, though they were examined often, by different persons, and as skilfully as possible. Now, criminals do not manage this, for the cleverest have the greatest difficulty in avoiding contradictory statements. Those writers, who have supported Grandier, have never discovered the least discrepancy in the evidence of the nuns. Nor did Grandier ever plead malice on their part as a defence, for they had never seen him, nor had he had anything to do with their affairs, as we have said.</p>  
 <p>If, as calumny asserts, the only thing sought was the death of Grandier, here were sufficient proofs to burn him, if only for abusing the privileges of his ministry and of his Church, or for the sacrileges he had committed therein. But justice is not satisfied with punishing one kind of crime, when she finds traces of another still more serious. It was moreover a Christian duty to assist the views of God, who permitted so strange an event, to confound the calumnies of the protestants, and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_26"><font size="1" color="green">p. 26</font></a></p>  
 <p>to prove the demonstration the "possession" of the nuns, and the magic exercised by the accused. To this the Commissioners and the other judges applied themselves.</p>  
 <p>Thus, as it was a matter rather of religion than of jurisprudence, they resolved to begin by prayer to God, who is the Father of all Light, rightly considering that all France was watching the trial with eager eyes, that it was shrouded in a thick veil of obscurity, and that their verdict would entail important consequences. They therefore prepared to receive divine assistance and grace by frequent confessions, and by often receiving the Holy Sacrament. Then they decreed a general procession to implore celestial aid in so difficult a matter; and, to excite the devotion of the masses by their example, they went in a body, during the whole of the trial, to visit the Churches of the city, set aside by the Bishop for forty hour services, and reached each in time for the elevation of the host. Thence the Exorcists went to the Church fixed upon for the Exorcisms, and the judges proceeded to the tribunal to continue the case; in the evening all returned to church for evensong.</p>  
 <p>The examination lasted forty days, during which Demons gave them the clearest proofs of their presence in the bodies of the persons exorcised, and every day added new evidence against Grandier, and yet never said anything against him which</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></a></p>  
 <p>did not turn out strictly true. These assertions merit distinct proof, which will be found interesting.</p>  
 <p>As regards the presence of Devils in the possessed, the Church teaches us in its ritual, that there are four principal signs, by which it can be undoubtedly recognised. These signs are the speaking or understanding of a language unknown to the person possessed; the revelation of the future, or of events happening far away; the exhibition of strength beyond the years and nature of the actor; and floating in the air for a few moments.</p>  
 <p>The Church does not require, in order to have recourse to Exorcisms, that all these marks should be found in the same subject; one alone, if well authenticated, is sufficient to demand public exorcism.</p>  
 <p>Now, they are all to be found in the Nuns <a href="errata.htm#7">of</a> Loudun, and in such numbers that we can only. mention the principal cases.</p>  
 <p>Acquaintance with unknown tongues first showed itself in the Mother-Superior. At the beginning, she answered in Latin the questions of the Ritual proposed to her in that language. Later, she and the others answered in any language they thought proper to question in.</p>  
 <p>M. de Launay de Razilli, who had lived in America, attested that, during a visit to Loudun, he had spoken to them in the language of a certain</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_28"><font size="1" color="green">p. 28</font></a></p>  
 <p>savage tribe of that country, and that they had answered quite correctly, and had revealed to him events that had taken place there.</p>  
 <p>Some gentlemen of Normandy certified in writing that they had questioned Sister Clara de Sazilli in Turkish, Spanish, and Italian, and that her answers were correct.</p>  
 <p>M. de Nismes, Doctor of the Sorbonne, and one of the chaplains of the Cardinal de Lyon, having questioned them in Greek and German, was satisfied with their replies in both languages.</p>  
 <p>Father Vignier, Superior of the Oratory at La Rochelle, bears witness in his Latin Narrative, that, having questioned Sister Elizabeth a whole afternoon in Greek, she always replied correctly and obeyed him in every particular.</p>  
 <p>The Bishop of Nimes commanded Sister Clara in Greek to raise veil and to kiss the railings at a certain spot; she obeyed, and did many other things he ordered, which caused the prelate to exclaim that one must be an Atheist or lunatic not to believe in "possession."</p>  
 <p>Some doctors questioned them also as to the meaning of some Greek technical terms, extremely difficult to explain, and only known to the most learned men, and they clearly expressed the real signification of the words.</p>  
 <p>Lastly, Grandier himself being confronted with them, his Bishop invested him with the stole to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></a></p>  
 <p>exorcise the Mother Superior, who, he declared, knew Latin; but he did not dare to question her or the others in Greek, though they dared him to it; whereon he remained very embarrassed. <a name="fr_8"></a><a href="#fn_8"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>As to the Revelation of hidden matters or of events passing afar off, proofs are still more abundant. We will only select a few of the most remarkable.</p>  
 <p>M. Morin, Prior of St. Jacques de Thouars, having requested M. Morans, Commissioner appointed by the Bishop of Poitiers to watch over the possessed, and to assist in the trial of Grandier, to allow some sign to be given proving <i>actual infernal possession</i>, whispered to M. de Morans that he wished one of the possessed to bring him five rose leaves. Sister Clara was then away in the refectory; M. de Morans ordered, in his thoughts, the Demon who possessed her to obey the wish of M. Morin, for the greater glory of God. Thereupon the Nun left the refectory, and went into the garden, whence she brought first a pansy and other plants, and presented them with roars of laughter, saying to M. de Morans:</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_30"><font size="1" color="green">p. 30</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> "Is that what you wish, father? I am not a Devil, to guess your thoughts."—To which he replied simply: "<i>Obedias</i>," obey. She then returned to the garden, and after several repetitions of the order, presented through the railings a little rose branch, on which were six leaves. The Exorcist said to her: "<i>Obedias punctualiter sub pœnâ maledictionis</i>," obey to the letter under penalty of malediction; she then plucked off one leaf, and offered the branch saying: "I see you will only have five; the other was one too many." The Prior was so convinced by what he saw, that he went out with tears in his eyes. An official report of the fact was drawn up.</p>  
 <p>Madame de Laubardemont also tried the sane experiment, in order to convince many sceptics who were present: and she was equally successful.</p>  
 <p>The <i>Liententant-Criminel</i> of Orleans, the President Tours, Lieutenant-General de S. Maixant, and myself <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">*</font></a> also had our curiosity gratified. I desired that Sister Clara should bring me her beads, and say an <i>Ave-Maria</i>. She first brought e. pin, and then some aniseed; being urged to obey, she said: "I see you want something else,"</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_31"><font size="1" color="green">p. 31</font></a></p>  
 <p>and then she brought me her beads and offered to say an <i>Ave-Maria</i>.</p>  
 <p>M. Chiron, Prior of Maillezais, desiring to strengthen his belief in demoniacal possession, begged M. de Morans to allow him to whisper to a third party the sign he required; and he thereon whispered to M. de Fernaison, Canon and Provost of the same Church, that he wished the nun to fetch a missal then lying near the door, and to put her finger on the introit of the mass of the Holy Virgin, beginning "Salve, Sancta parens." M. de Morans, who had heard nothing, ordered Sister Clara, who was likewise ignorant of what had been said, to obey the intentions of M. Chiron. This young girl then fell into strange convulsions, blaspheming, rolling on the ground, exposing her person in the most indecent manner, without a blush, and with foul and lascivious expressions and actions, <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">*</font></a> till she caused all who looked on to hide their eyes with shame. Though she had never seen the prior, she called him by his name, and said he should be her lover. It was only</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p>after many repeated commands, and an hour's struggling, that she took up the missal, saying: "I will pray." Then, turning her eyes in another direction, she placed her finger on the capital S at the beginning of the introit aforesaid, of which facts reports were drawn up.</p>  
 <p>M. de Milliere, a gentleman of Maine, certified that, being present at the Exorcism of Sister Clara, and on his knees, the Devil asked him whether he was saying a <i>De Profundis</i> for his wife, which was the case. The Marquis de la Mothe, son of M. de Parabel, governor of Poitou, certified that sister Louise de Nogeret had disclosed his most secret faults in the presence of Father Tranquille, and of Madame de Neuillant, his aunt.</p>  
 <p>The same M. de la Mothe also asked an Exorcist to make Sister Clara, who was in the convent, come out, kneel down, and say an Ave Maria; she came after repeated commands, and obeyed.</p>  
 <p>Chevalier de Mere, who was present, asked the Devil on what day he had last confessed. The Devil answered Friday. The Chevalier acknowledged this to be correct; whereupon Sister Clara withdrew. But as he wished to try the Devil again, he begged the exorcist to make her return, and whispered some words to the Marquis and the Monk, for the nun to repeat. The exorcist refused, as the words were indecent. He changed</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></a></p>  
 <p>them, therefore, into <i>Pater, et Filius et Spiritus Sanctus!</i> He whispered these words so low, that the exorcist could hardly hear them. The nun, who was in another room, came at the command of the Father, and addressing the Chevalier, first said the indecent words the monk had refused, and then repeated several times <i>Gloria patri et filio et Spiritui Sancta</i>. She was ordered to say the words, exactly as she had been desired, but she said she would not.</p>  
 <p>The Bishop of Nîmes, being present at an exorcism by Father Surin, begged him to order something in difficult Latin; and the Demon thereupon performed what was wanted.</p>  
 <p>A Jesuit wishing to try what so many people stated they had experienced, gave an inward order to a demon who had been exorcised; and then immediately another. In the space of a second he gave five or six orders, which he countermanded one after another; and thus tormented the Devil, who was ordered to obey his intentions. The Demon repeated his commands aloud, beginning by the first, and adding, "But you wont," and when he had come to the last he said, "Now let's see whether we can do this."</p>  
 <p>"When it rained," says Father Surin, "the Devil used to place the Mother Superior under the wafer spout. As I knew this to be a habit of his, I commanded him mentally to bring her to me;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></a></p>  
 <p>whereupon she used to come and ask me: 'What do you want.'"</p>  
 <p>Another thing which struck the Exorcists, was the instantaneous answers they gave to the most difficult questions of Theology, as to grace, the vision of God, Angels, the Incarnation and similar subjects, always in the very terns used in the schools.</p>  
 <p>The corporal effect of possession is a proof which strikes the coarsest minds. It has this other advantage, that an example convinces a whole <a href="errata.htm#8">assembly</a>. <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>

 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></a></p>  
 <p>Now the nuns of Loudun gave these proofs daily. When the Exorcist gave some order to <a name="page_v2_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></a> the Devil, the nuns suddenly passed from a state of quiet into the most terrible convulsions, and <a name="page_v2_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></a> without the <a href="errata.htm#13">slightest</a> increase of pulsation. They struck their chests and backs with their heads, <a name="page_v2_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></a> as if they had had their neck broken, and with inconceivable rapidity; they twisted their arms <a name="page_v2_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></a> at the joints of the shoulder, the elbow and the wrist two or three times round; lying on their <a name="page_v2_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></a> stomachs they joined their palms of their hands to the soles of their feet; their faces became so as the commissioners should incline. It further <a name="page_v2_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></a> frightful one could not bear to look at them; their eyes remained open without winking; their tongues <a name="page_v2_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a> issued suddenly from their mouths, horribly swollen, black, hard, and covered with pimples, <a name="page_v2_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></a> and yet while in this state they spoke distinctly; they threw themselves back till their heads touched <a name="page_v2_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></a> their feet, and walked in this position with wonderful rapidity, and for a long time. They uttered: cries so horrible and so loud that nothing like it was ever heard before; they made use of expressions so indecent as to shame the most debauched of men, while their acts, both in exposing themselves and inviting lewd behaviour from those present, would have astonished the inmates of the lowest brothel in the country; they <a name="page_v2_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></a> uttered maledictions against the three Divine Persons of the Trinity, oaths and blasphemous expressions so execrable, so unheard of, that they could not have suggested themselves to the human mind. They used to watch without rest, and fast five or six days at a time, or be tortured twice a day as we have described during several hours, without their health suffering; on the contrary, those that were somewhat delicate, appeared healthier than before their possession.</p>  
 <p>The Devil sometimes made them fall suddenly asleep: they fell to the ground and became so heavy, that the strongest man had great trouble in even moving their heads. Françoise Filestreau having her mouth closed, one could hear within her body different voices speaking at the same time, quarrelling, and discussing who should make her speak.</p>  
 <p>Lastly, one often saw Elizabeth Blanchard, in her convulsions, with her feet in the air and her head on the ground, leaning against a chair or a window sill without other support.</p>  
 <p>The Mother Superior from the beginning was carried off her feet and remained suspended in the air at the height of 24 inches. A report of this was drawn up and sent to the Sorbonne, signed by a great number of witnesses, ecclesiastics and doctors, and the judgement thereon of the Bishop of Poitiers who was also a witness. The doctors</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_46"><font size="1" color="green">p. 46</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the Sorbonne were of the same opinion as the Bishop, and declared that infernal possession was proved.</p>  
 <p>Both she and other nuns lying flat, without moving foot, hand, or body, were suddenly lifted to their feet like statues.</p>  
 <p>In another exorcism the Mother Superior was suspended in the air, only touching the ground with her elbow.</p>  
 <p>Others, when comatose, became supple like a thin piece of lead, so that their body could be bent in every direction, forward, backward, or sideways, till their head touched the ground; and they remained thus so long as their position was not altered by others.</p>  
 <p>At other times they passed the left foot over their shoulder to the cheek. They passed also their feet over their head till the big toe touched the tip of the nose.</p>  
 <p>Others again were able to stretch their legs so far to the right and left that they sat on the ground without any space being visible between their bodies and the floor, their bodies erect and their hands joined.</p>  
 <p>One, the Mother Superior, stretched her legs to such an extraordinary extent, that from toe to toe the distance was 7 feet, though she was herself but 4 feet high.</p>  
 <p>But sometime before the death of Grandier,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_v2_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></a></p>  
 <p>this lady had a still stranger experience. In a few words this is what happened: In an exorcism the Devil promised Father Lactance as a sign of his exit, that he would make three wounds on the left side of the Mother Superior. He described their appearance and stated the day and hour when they would appear. He said he would come out from within, without affecting the nun's health, and forbade that any remedy should be applied, as the wounds would leave no mark.</p>  
 <p>On the day named, the exorcism took place; and as many doctors had come from the neighbouring towns to be present at this event, M. de Laubardemont made them draw near, and permitted then to examine the clothes of the nun, to uncover her side in the presence of the assembly, to look into all the folds of her dress, of her stays which were of whalebone, and of her chemise, to make sure there was no weapon: she only had about her her scissors, which were given over to another. M. de Laubardemont asked the doctors to tie her; hut they begged him to let them first see the convulsions they had heard spoken of. He granted this, and during the convulsions the Superior suddenly came to herself with a sigh, pressed her right hand to her left side and withdrew it covered with blood. She was again examined, and the doctors with the whole assembly saw three bloody wounds, of the size stated by the Devil; the</p>

 <p>chemise, the stays, and the dress were pierced in three places, the largest hole looking as if a pistol bullet had passed through. The nun was thereupon entirely stripped, but no instrument of any description was found upon her. A report was immediately drawn up, and <i>Monsieur</i>, brother of the King, who witnessed the facts, with all the nobles of his Court, attested the document.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_11"></a><a href="dol03.htm#fr_11">v2_34:*</a> A curious case is mentioned in Arnot's Criminal Trials:—</p>  
 <p>"In 1697 an impostor appeared, in the character of a person tormented by witches, Christian Shaw, daughter of John Shaw of Bargarran, a gentleman of some note in the county of Renfrew. She is said to have been hut eleven years of age. And although it is probable that hysterical affections may in part have occasioned her rhaphsodies to proceed from real illusion, as well as accounted for the contortions which agitated her body; yet she seems to have displayed an artifice above her years, an address superior to her situation, and to have been aided by accomplices, which dulness of apprehension, or violence of prejudice, forbade the bystanders to discover.</p>  
 <p>"This actress was abundantly pert and lively; and <a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></a> her challenging one of the house-maids for drinking, perhaps for stealing, a little milk, which drew on her an angry retort, was the simple prelude to a complicated and wonderful scene of artifice and delusion, of fanaticism and barbarity.</p>  
 <p>"In the month of August 1696, <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">1</font></a> within a few days after her quarrel with the house-maid, the girl was seized with hysterical convulsions, which in repeated fits displayed that variety of symptoms which characterise this capricious disease. To these, other appearances were speedily added, which could only to attributed to supernatural influence, or to fraud and imposition. She put out of her mouth quantities of egg-shells, orange-pill, feathers of wild, and bones of tame fowl, hair of various colours, hot coal-cinders, straws, crooked pins, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>"Having by those sensible objects impressed the publick with the most complete and fearful conviction of her being 'grievously vexed <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">2</font></a> with a Devil,' she found herself capable to command the implicit assent of the spectators, in matters that were repugnant to the evidence of their own senses. For this purpose, she fell upon the device of seeming to possess the <a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></a> faculties of seeing and hearing, in a manner opposite to that of the rest of mankind. She would address some invisible beings as if actually present; at other times, in her conversations with those invisible beings, she would rail at them for telling her that persons actually present were in the room; protesting that she did not see them, yet at the same time minutely describing their dress. For instance, she spake as follows to the chief of her alledged tormentors, Catherine Campbell, with whom she had the quarrel, and who, to use the language of those times, was not <i>discernibly</i> present: 'Thou sittest with a stick in thy hand to put into my mouth, but thorough God's strength thou shalt not get leave: Thou art permitted to torment me, but I trust in God thou shalt never get my life. I'll let thee see, <i>Kattie</i>, there is no repentance in hell. O what ailed thee to be a witch! Thou sayest it is but three nights since thou wast a witch. O, if thou would’st repent, it may be God might give thee repentance, if thou would'st seek it, and confess; if thou would desire me, I would do what I could; for the Devil is an ill master to serve,' &amp;c. &amp;c. After that, she took up her Bible, read passages, and expounded them; and, upon one's offering to take it from her, she shrieked horribly, exclaiming, 'She would keep her Bible in spite of all the Devils <a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></a> in hell!' Then she fought, and kicked, and writhed herself, as if struggling with some invisible tormentor. When the sheriff-depute of the county, accompanied by a macer of Justiciary, carne to apprehend some of the persons whom her diabolical malice had accused, and were actually in her presence, she addressed an imaginary and invisible correspondent thus: 'Is the sheriff come? Is he near me?' (Then stretching forth her hand, as if to grope, and the sheriff putting his hand into hers, she proceeded:) '<i>I cannot feel the sheriff</i>. How can he be present here? or how can I have him by the hand, as thou sayest, seeing I feel it not? Thou sayest he has brown coloured cloaths, red plush breeches, with black stripes, flowered muslin cravat, and an embroidered sword-belt: Thou sayest there is an old gray haired man with him, having a ring upon his hand; but I can neither see nor feel any of them. What, <i>are they come to apprehend the gentlewoman?</i> Is this their errand indeed?'</p>  
 <p>"These reiterated and aweful exercises of the dominion of Satan (for such they were universally deemed), impressed all ranks with amazement and terror. The clergy, as was their duty, were the foremost to embrace the cause of a disciple that was engaged in more than spiritual warfare with the grand enemy. Clergymen, by rotation, attended the afflicted <a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></a> damsel, to assist the minister of the parish, the family of Bargarran, and other pious Christians, in the expiatory offices of fasting and prayer. A publick fast was ordained by authority of the presbytery. Three popular clergymen successively harangued the trembling audience; and one of them chose for his theme this awful text, "Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea, for the Devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. <i>And when the dragon saw that he was cast down unto the earth, he persecuted the woman</i>." <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">3</font></a> And the prayers and exhortations of the church were speedily seconded with the weight of the secular arm.</p>  
 <p>"On the 19th of January, a warrant of Privy Council was issued, <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">4</font></a> which set forth, that there were pregnant grounds of suspicion of witchcraft in the shire of Renfrew, especially from the afflicted aril extraordinary condition of Christian Shaw, daughter of John Shaw of Bargarran. It therefore granted commission to Alexander Lord Blantyre, Sir John Maxwell of Pollock, Sir John Shaw of Greenock, William Cunnyngham of Craigens, Alexander Porterfield of Duchall, —— Caldwall of Glanderstoun, Gavin <a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></a> Cochrane of Thornlymuir, Alexander Porterfield of Fullwaod, and Robert Semple sheriff-depute of Renfrew, or any five of them, to interrogate and imprison persons suspected of witchcraft, to examine witnesses, &amp;c. but not upon oath, and to transmit their report before the 10th of March. The act of Privy Council is subscribed thus, 'Polwarth <i>Cancellar</i>, Argyle, Leven, Forfar, Raith, Belhaven, Ja. Steuart, J. Hope, W. Anstruther, J. Maxwell, Ro. Sinclair.'</p>  
 <p>"In the report which was presented on the 9th of March, the commissioners represented that there were 'twenty-four persons male and female suspected and accused of <a href="errata.htm#9">witchcraft</a>,' and that further inquiry ought to be made into this crime. Among these unhappy objects of suspicion, it is to be remarked, that there was 'a girl of fourteen, and a boy not twelve years of age.' Agreeable to this report, a new warrant was issued by the Privy Council to most of the commissioners formerly named, with the addition of Lord Hallcraig, Mr. Francis Montgomery of Giffin, Sir John Houston of that Ilk, Mr John Kincaid of Corsbasket, Advocate, and Mr John Stewart younger of Blackhall, Advocate, or any five of them, to meet at Renfrew, Paisley, or Glasgow, to take trial of judge, and do justice upon the foresaid persons; and to sentence the guilty 'to be burned or <a href="errata.htm#10">otherwise</a> executed to death, <a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></a> ordained the commissioners to transmit to the Court of Justiciary an authentick extract of their proceedings, to be entered upon its records; and contained a recommendation to the Lords of the Treasury to defray the expences of the trial. The act is subscribed, Polwarth <i>Cancellar</i>. Douglass, Lauderdale, Annandale, Yester, Kintore, Carmichael, W. Anstruther, Arch. Mure.'</p>  
 <p>"The commissioners, thus empowered, were not remiss in acting under the authority delegated to them. After twenty hours were spent in the examination of witnesses, who <i>gave testimony</i> that the <i>malefices</i> <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">5</font></a> libelled could not have proceeded from natural causes, and that the prisoners were the authors of these malefices.—After five of the unhappy prisoners confessed their own guilt, and criminated their alledged associates—after counsel had been heard on both sides, and the counsel for the prosecution had declared, that 'he would not press the jury with the <i>ordinary severity of threatening an assize of error:</i>' <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">6</font></a> But recommended to them to proceed according to the evidence; and <a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></a> loudly declared to them, that although they ought to beware of condemning the innocent, yet if they should acquit the prisoners, in opposition to legal evidence, 'they would be accessory to all the blasphemies, apostacies, murders, tortures, and seductions, whereof these enemies of heaven and earth should hereafter be guilty.' After the jury had spent six hours in deliberation, seven of those miserable persons were condemned to the flames. <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">7</font></a></p>  
 <p>"The time however fast approached, when these human sacrifices were to be abolished. The last person who was prosecuted before the Lords of Justiciary for witchcraft was Elspeth Rule, who was tried before Lord Anstruther at the Dumfries circuit, on the 3d of May, 1709. <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">8</font></a> No special act of <a href="errata.htm#11">witchcraft</a> was charged against her; the indictment was of a very general nature, that the prisoner was 'habit and repute' <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">9</font></a> <a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a> (that is, generally holden and deemed) a witch; and that she had used threatening expressions against persons at enmity with her, who were afterwards visited with the loss of cattle, or the death of friends, and one of whom run mad. The jury, by a majority of voices, <a href="errata.htm#12">found</a> these articles proved, and the Judge ordained the prisoner to be burned on the cheek, and to be banished Scotland for life. The last person who was brought to the stake in Scotland for the crime of witchcraft was condemned by Captain David Ross of Little Daan <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">10</font></a> sheriff-depute of Sutherland, A.D. 1722.</p>  
 <p>"Besides in the sufferings, and tragical end of the persons already specified, human ingenuity seems to have been exhausted in devising variety of torment, against other persons who lay under the suspicion of witchcraft, and who persisted, with astonishing fortitude, in denying the absurd imputation, even when urged with the sharpest tortures. <a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></a></p>  
 <p>From the universal and excessive abhorrence entertained at a witch, a suspicion of that crime, independent of judicial severities, <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">11</font></a> was sufficient to render the unhappy object anxious for death.—Thrusting of pins into the flesh, and keeping the accused from sleep, were the ordinary treatment of a witch. But if the prisoner was endued with uncommon fortitude, other methods were used to extort confession. The 'boots,' the 'caspie-claws,' and the 'pilniewinks, engines for torturing the legs, the arms, and the fingers, were applied to either sex; and that with such violence, that sometimes the blood would have spouted from the limbs. Loading with heavy irons, and whipping with cords, till the skin and flesh were torn from the bones, have also been the adopted methods of torment.</p>  
 <p>The bloody zeal of those inquisitors attained to a refinement in cruelty so shocking to humanity, <a name="fr_23"></a><a href="#fn_23"><font size="1">12</font></a> and so <a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></a> repugnant to justice, as to be almost incredible. Not satisfied with torturing <i>the person</i> of the accused, their ingenious malice assailed the more delicate feelings, and ardent affections of the <i>mind</i>. An aged husband, an infant daughter, would have been tortured in presence of the accused, in order to subdue her resolution.—Nay, death itself <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">13</font></a> did not screen the remains of those miserable persons from the malice of their prosecutors. If an unfortunate woman, trembling at a citation for witchcraft, ended her sufferings by her own hands, she was dragged from her house at a horse's tail, and buried under the gallows.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_20"></a><a href="dol03.htm#fr_20">v2_34:9</a> "Habit and repute" is a very dangerous doctrine of the law of Scotland, at that time in full force, by which a man might be hanged altho’ hardly any charge were exhibited against him, but that he had a bad character. For instance, if a man was charged with stealing a pair of old shoes, value threepence, and with being <a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a> "habit and repute" a thief, if the jury found such indictment proved, or such prisoner guilty, the Court would by law be bound to sentence the prisoner to be hanged; if my temerity may be pardoned, for supposing that any such thing exists as a precise established ruin of criminal law in Scotland.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_21"></a><a href="dol03.htm#fr_21">v2_34:10</a> It is no small disappointment to me that I cannot lay this trial before the reader. The Sheriff Court books of the county of Sutherland were carried off by the Sheriff Clerk about 1735. I am somewhat however consoled for my disappointment, by the politeness shown me by James Traill, Esq. of Hobbister, Advocate, Sheriff-depute of Caithness and Sutherland, who was so obliging as to make a laborious but ineffectual search to recover the books.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_23"></a><a href="dol03.htm#fr_23">v2_34:12</a> Records of Justiciary, June 24. 1596. When Alison Balfour was accused of witchcraft, she was put in the caspie-claws, where she was kept forty-eight hours; her husband was put in heavy irons, <i>her son put in the boots, where he suffered fifty-seven strokes</i>, and her little daughter, of about seven years of age, put its the pilniewinks, in her presence, in order to make her confess.—She did confess.—She retracted her confession in the course of the trial; and publickly, at <a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></a> her execution, declared that the confession was extorted from her by the torments.—The mode of tormenting and executing those miserable women is further illustrated by the authentic account of the expence of burning a witch at Burncastle, near Lauder, A.D. 1649.</p>
