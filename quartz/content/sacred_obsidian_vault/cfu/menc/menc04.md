 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 4</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius, having an interview with the king Hsüan of Ch'î, 
 said to him, 'When men speak of "an ancient kingdom," it is not meant thereby
 that it has lofty trees in it, but that it has ministers sprung from
 families which have been noted in it for generations. Your Majesty has no
 intimate ministers even. Those whom you advanced yesterday are gone to-day,
 and you do not know it.'</p>
 
 <p>2. The king said, 'How shall I know that they have not ability, and so
 avoid employing them at all?'</p>
 
 <p>3. The reply was, 'The ruler of a State advances to office men of talents
 and virtue only as a matter of necessity. Since he will thereby cause the
 low to overstep the honourable, and distant to overstep his near relatives,
 ought he to do so but with caution?</p>
 
 <p>4. 'When all those about you say,-- "This is a man of talents and
 worth," you may not therefore believe it. When your great officers all
 say,-- "This is a man of talents and virtue," neither may you for that
 believe it. When all the people say,-- "This is a man of talents and
 virtue," then examine into the case, and when you find that the man is
 such, employ him. When all those about you say,-- "This man won't do,"
 don't listen to them. When all your great officers say,-- "This man won't
 do," don't listen to them. When the people all sav,-- "This man won't do,"
 then examine into the case, and when you find that the man won't do, send
 him away.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'When all those about you say,-- "This man deserves death," don't
 listen to them. When all your great officers say,-- "This man deserves
 death," don't listen to them. When the people all say,"This man deserves
 death," then inquire into the case, and when you see that the man deserves
 death, put him to death. In accordance with this we have the saying, "The
 people killed him."</p>
 
 <p>6. 'You must act in this way in order to be the parent of the
 people.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The king Hsüan of Ch'î asked, saying, 'Was it so,
 that T'ang banished Chieh, and that king Wû smote Châu?' 
 Mencius replied, 'It is so in the records.'</p>
 
 <p>2. The king said, 'May a minister then put his sovereign to death?'</p>
 
 <p>3. Mencius said, 'He who outrages the benevolence proper to his nature,
 is called a robber; he who outrages righteousness, is called a ruffian. The
 robber and ruffian we call a mere fellow. I have heard of the cutting off
 of the fellow Châu, but I have not heard of the putting a sovereign
 to death, in his case.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius, having an interview with the king Hsüan of Ch'î,
 said to him, 'If you are going to build a large mansion, you will surely
 cause the Master of the workmen to look out for large trees, and when he
 has found such large trees, you will be glad, thinking that they will
 answer for the intended object. Should the workmen hew them so as to make
 them too small, then your Majesty will be angry, thinking that they will
 not answer for the purpose. Now, a man spends his youth in learning the
 principles of right government, and, being grown up to vigour, he wishes to
 put them in practice;-- if your Majesty says to him, "For the present put
 aside what you have learned, and follow me," what shall we say?</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Here now you have a gem unwrought, in the stone. Although it may be
 worth 240,000 taels, you will surely employ a lapidary to cut and polish
 it. But when you come to the government of the State, then you say,-- "For
 the present put aside what you have learned, and follow me." How is it that
 you herein act so differently from your conduct in calling in the lapidary
 to cut the gem?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The people of Ch'î attacked Yen, and conquered it.</p>
 
 <p>2. The king Hsüan asked, saying, 'Some tell me not to take
 possession of it for myself, and some tell me to take possession of it. For
 a kingdom of ten thousand chariots, attacking another of ten thousand
 chariots, to complete the conquest of it in fifty days, is an achievement
 beyond mere human strength. If I do not take possession of it, calamities
 from Heaven will surely come upon me. What do you say to my taking
 possession of it?'</p>
 
 <p>3. Mencius replied, 'If the people of Yen will be pleased with your taking
 possession of it, then do so.-- Among the ancients there was one who acted on
 this principle, namely king Wû. If the people of Yen will not be pleased
 with your taking possession of it, then do not do so.-- Among the ancients
 there was one who acted on this principle, namely king Wan.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'When, with all the strength of your country of ten thousand
 chariots, you attacked another country of ten thousand chariots, and the
 people brought baskets of rice and vessels of congee, to meet your
 Majesty's host, was there any other reason for this but that they hoped to
 escape out of fire and water ? If you make the water more deep and the fire
 more fierce, they will in like manner make another revolution.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The people of Ch'î, having smitten Yen, took possession of it,
 and upon this, the princes of the various States deliberated together, and
 resolved to deliver Yen from their power. The king Hsüan said to
 Mencius, 'The princes have formed many plans to attack me:-- how shall I
 prepare myself for them?' Mencius replied, 'I have heard of one who with
 seventy lî exercised all the functions of government throughout the
 kingdom. That was T'ang. I have never heard of a prince with a thousand
 lî standing in fear of others.'</p>
 
 <p>2. 'It is said in the Book of History, As soon as T'ang began his work
 of executing justice, he commenced with Ko. The whole kingdom had
 confidence in him. When he pursued his work in the east, the rude tribes on
 the west murmured. So did those on the north, when he was engaged in the
 south. Their cry was-- "Why does he put us last?" Thus, the people looked
 to him, as we look in a time of great drought to the clouds and rainbows.
 The frequenters of the markets stopped not. The husbandmen made no change
 in their operations. While he punished their rulers, he consoled the
 people. His progress was like the falling of opportune rain, and the people
 were delighted. It is said again in the Book of History, "We have waited
 for our prince long; the prince's coming will be our reviving!"</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Now the ruler of Yen was tyrannizing over his people, and your
 Majesty went and punished him. The people supposed that you were going to
 deliver them out of the water and the fire, and brought baskets of rice and
 vessels of congee, to meet your Majesty's host. But you have slain their
 fathers and elder brothers, and put their sons and younger brothers in
 confinement. You have pulled down the ancestral temple of the State, and
 are removing to Ch'î its precious vessels. How can such a course be
 deemed proper? The rest of the kingdom is indeed jealously afraid of the
 strength of Ch'î; and now, when with a doubled territory you do not
 put in practice a benevolent government;-- it is this which sets the arms
 of the kingdom in in motion.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'If your Majesty will make haste to issue an ordinance, restoring
 your captives, old and young, stopping the removal of the precious vessels,
 and saying that, after consulting with the people of Yen, you will appoint
 them a ruler, and withdraw from the country;-- in this way you may still be
 able to stop the threatened attack.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. There had been a brush between Tsâu and Lû, when the duke
 Mû asked Mencius, saying,'Of my officers there were killed
 thirty-three men, and none of the people would die in their defence. Though
 I sentenced them to death for their conduct, it is impossible to put such a
 multitude to death. If I do not put them to death, then there is the crime
 unpunished of their looking angrily on at the death of their officers, and
 not saving them. How is the exigency of the case to be met?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'In calamitous years and years of famine, the old
 and weak of your people, who have been found lying in the ditches and
 water-channels, and the able-bodied who have been scattered about to the
 four quarters, have amounted to several thousands. All the while, your
 granaries, 0 prince, have been stored with grain, and your treasuries and
 arsenals have been full, and not one of your officers has told you of the
 distress. Thus negligent have the superiors in your State been, and cruel
 to their inferiors. The philosopher Tsang said, "Beware, beware. What
 proceeds from you, will return to you again." Now at length the people have
 paid back the conduct of their officers to them. Do not you, 0 prince,
 blame them.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'If you will put in practice a benevolent government, this people
 will love you and all above them, and will die for their officers.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The duke Wan of T'ang asked Mencius, saying, 'T'ang is a small 
 kingdom, and lies between Ch'î and Ch'û. Shall I serve
 Ch'î? Or shall I serve Chû?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'This plan which you propose is beyond me. If you will
 have me counsel you, there is one thing I can suggest. Dig deeper your
 moats; build higher your walls; guard them as well as your people. In case
 of attack, be prepared to die in your defence, and have the people so that
 they will not leave you;-- this is a proper course.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The duke Wan of T'ang asked Mencius, saying, 'The people of
 Ch'î are going to fortify Hsieh. The movement occasions me great 
 alarm. What is the proper course for me to take in the case?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'Formerly, when king T'âi dwelt in Pin, the
 barbarians of the north were continually making incursions upon it. He
 therefore left it, went to the foot of mount Ch'î, and there took up
 his residence. He did not take that situation, as having selected it. It
 was a matter of necessity with him.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'If you do good, among your descendants, in after generations, there
 shall be one who will attain to the royal dignity. A prince lays the
 foundation of the inheritance, and hands down the beginning which he has
 made, doing what may be continued by his successors. As to the
 accomplishment of the great result, that is with Heaven. What is that
 Ch'î to you, 0 prince? Be strong to do good. That is all your
 business.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The duke Wan of T'ang asked Mencius, saying, 'T'ang is a small State.
 Though I do my utmost to serve those large kingdoms on either side of it,
 we cannot escape suffering from them. What course shall I take that we may
 do so?' Mencius replied, 'Formerly, when king T'âi dwelt in Pin, the
 barbarians of the north were constantly making incursions upon it. He
 served them with skins and silks, and still he suffered from them. He
 served them with dogs and horses, and still he suffered from them. He
 served them with pearls and gems, and still he suffered from them. Seeing
 this, he assembled the old men, and announced to them, saying, "What the
 barbarians want is my territory. I have heard this,-- that a ruler does not
 injure his people with that wherewith he nourishes them. My children, why
 should you be troubled about having no prince? I will leave this."
 Accordingly, he left Pin, crossed the mountain Liang, built a town at the
 foot of mount Ch'î, and dwelt there. The people of Pin said, "He is a
 benevolent man. We must not lose him." Those who followed him looked like
 crowds hastening to market.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'On the other hand, some say, "The kingdom is a thing to be kept
 from generation to generation. One individual cannot undertake to dispose
 of it in his own person. Let him be prepared to die for it. Let him not
 quit it."</p>
 
 <p>3. 'I ask you, prince, to make your election between these two
 courses.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The duke P'ing of Lû was about to leave his palace, when his
 favourite, one Tsang Ts'ang, made a request to him, saying, 'On other days,
 when you have gone out, you have given instructions to the officers as to
 where you were going.  But now, the horses have been put to the carriage,
 and the officers do not yet know where you are going. I venture to ask.'
 The duke said, 'I am going to see the scholar Mang.' ' How is this?' said
 the other. 'That you demean yourself, prince, in paying the honour of the
 first visit to a common man, is, I suppose, because you think that he is a
 man of talents and virtue. By such men the rules of ceremonial proprieties
 and right are observed. But on the occasion of this Mang's second mourning,
 his observances exceeded those of the former. Do not go to see him, my
 prince.' The duke said, 'I will not.'</p>
 
 <p>2. The officer Yo-chang entered the court, and had an audience. He said,
 'Prince, why have you not gone to see Mang K'o?' the duke said, 'One told
 me that, on the occasion of the scholar Mang's second mourning, his
 observances exceeded those of the former. It is on that account that I have
 not gone to see him.' 'How is this!' answered Yo-chang. 'By what you call
 "exceeding," you mean, I suppose, that, on the first occasion, he used the
 rites appropriate to a scholar, and, on the second, those appropriate to a
 great officer; that he first used three tripods, and afterwards five
 tripods.' The duke said, 'No; I refer to the greater excellence of the
 coffin, the shell, the grave-clothes, and the shroud.' Yo-chAng said, 'That
 cannot be called "exceeding." That was the difference between being poor
 and being rich.'</p>
 
 <p>3. After this, Yo-chang saw Mencius, and said to him, 'I told the prince
 about you, and he was consequently coming to see you, when one of his
 favourites, named Tsang Ts'ang, stopped him, and therefore he did not come
 according to his purpose.' Mencius said, 'A man's advancement is effected,
 it may be, by others, and the stopping him is, it may be, from the efforts
 of others. But to advance a man or to stop his advance is really beyond the
 power of other men. My not finding in the prince of Lû a ruler who
 would confide in me, and put my counsels into practice, is from Heaven. How
 could that scion of the Tsang family cause me not to find the ruler that
 would suit me?'</p>
