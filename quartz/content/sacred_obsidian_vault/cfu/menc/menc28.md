 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 28</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'For the mouth to desire sweet tastes, the eye to
 desire beautiful colours, the ear to desire pleasant sounds, the nose to
 desire fragrant odours, and the four limbs to desire ease and rest;-- these
 things are natural. But there is the appointment of Heaven in connexion
 with them, and the superior man does not say of his pursuit of them, "It is
 my nature."</p>
 
 <p>2. 'The exercise of love between father and son, the observance of
 righteousness between sovereign and minister, the rules of ceremony between
 guest and host, the display of knowledge in recognising the talented, and
 the fulfilling the heavenly course by the sage;-- these are the appointment
 of Heaven. But there is an adaptation of our nature for them. The superior
 man does not say, in reference to them, "It is the appointment of
 Heaven."'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Hâo-shang Pû-hâi asked, saying, 'What sort of man
 is Yo-chang?' Mencius replied, 'He is a good man, a real man.'</p>
 
 <p>2. 'What do you mean by "A good man," "A real man?"'</p>
 
 <p>3. The reply was, 'A man who commands our liking is what is called a
 good man.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'He whose goodness is part of himself is what is called real man.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'He whose goodness has been filled up is what is called beautiful
 man.</p>
 
 <p>6. He whose completed goodness is brightly displayed is what is called a
 great man.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'When this great man exercises a transforming influence, he is what is
 called a sage.</p>
 
 <p>8. 'When the sage is beyond our knowledge, he is what is called a
 spirit-man.</p>
 
 <p>9. 'Yo-chang is between the two first characters, and below the four
 last.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Those who are fleeing from the errors of Mo naturally
 turn to Yang, and those who are fleeing from the errors of Yang naturally
 turn to orthodoxy. When they so turn, they should at once and simply be
 received.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Those who nowadays dispute with the followers of Yang and Mo do so
 as if they were pursuing a stray pig, the leg of which, after they have got
 it to enter the pen, they proceed to tie.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'There are the exactions of hempen-cloth and silk, of
 grain, and of personal service. The prince requires but one of these at
 once, deferring the other two. If he require two of them at once, then the
 people die of hunger. If he require the three at once, then fathers and
 sons are separated.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'The precious things of a prince are three;-- the
 territory, the people, the government and its business. If one value as
 most precious pearls and jade, calamity is sure to befall him.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Pan-ch'ang Kwo having obtained an official situation in Ch'î,
 Mencius said, 'He is a dead man, that Pan-ch'ang Kwo!' Pan-chang Kwo being
 put to death, the disciples asked, saying, 'How did you know, Master, that
 he would meet with death?' Mencius replied, 'He was a man, who had a little
 ability, but had not learned the great doctrines of the superior man. He
 was just qualified to bring death upon himself, but for nothing more.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. When Mencius went to T'ang, he was lodged in the Upper palace. A
 sandal in the process of making had been placed there in a window, and when
 the keeper of the place came to look for it, he could not find it.</p>
 
 <p>2. On this, some one asked Mencius, saying, 'Is it thus that your
 followers pilfer?' Mencius replied, 'Do you think that they came here to
 pilfer the sandal?' The man said, 'I apprehend not. But you, Master, having
 arranged to give lessons, do not go back to inquire into the past, and you
 do not reject those who come to you. If they come with the mind to learn,
 you receive them without any more ado.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'All men have some things which they cannot bear;--
 extend that feeling to what they can bear, and benevolence will be the
 result. All men have some things which they will not do;-- extend that
 feeling to the things which they do, and righteousness will be the
 result.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'If a man can give full development to the feeling which makes him
 shrink from injuring others, his benevolence will be more than can be
 called into practice. If he can give full development to the feeling which
 refuses to break through, or jump over, a wall, his righteousness will be
 more than can be called into practice.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'If he can give full development to the real feeling of dislike with
 which he receives the salutation, "Thou," "Thou," he will act righteously
 in all places and circumstances.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'When a scholar speaks what he ought not to speak, by guile of speech
 seeking to gain some end; and when he does not speak what he ought to
 speak, by guile of silence seeking to gain some end;-- both these cases are
 of a piece with breaking through a neighbour's wall.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Words which are simple, while their meaning is
 far-reaching, are good words.  Principles which, as held, are compendious,
 while their application is extensive, are good principles. The words of the
 superior man do not go below the girdle, but great principles are contained
 in them.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'The principle which the superior man holds is that of personal
 cultivation, but the kingdom is thereby tranquillized.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'The disease of men is this:-- that they neglect their own fields,
 and go to weed the fields of others, and that what they require from others
 is great, while what they lay upon themselves is light.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Yâo and Shun were what they were by nature;
 T'ang and Wû were so by returning to natural virtue.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'When all the movements, in the countenance and every turn of the
 body, are exactly what is proper, that shows the extreme degree of the
 complete virtue. Weeping for the dead should be from real sorrow, and not
 because of the living. The regular path of virtue is to be pursued without
 any bend, and from no view to emolument. The words should all be
 necessarily sincere, not with any desire to do what is right.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'The superior man performs the law of right, and thereby waits simply
 for what has been appointed.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Those who give counsel to the great should
 despise them, and not look at their pomp and display.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Halls several times eight cubits high, with beams projecting several
 cubits;-- these, if my wishes were to be realized, I would not have. Food
 spread before me over ten cubits square, and attendants and concubines to
 the amount of hundreds;-- these, though my wishes were realized, I would
 not have. Pleasure and wine, and the dash of hunting, with thousands of
 chariots following after me;-- these, though my wishes were realized, I
 would not have. What they esteem are what I would have nothing to do with;
 what I esteem are the rules of the ancients.-- Why should I stand in awe of
 them?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'To nourish the mind there is nothing better than to make
 the desires few. Here is a man whose desires are few:-- in some things he
 may not be able to keep his heart, but they will be few. Here is a man
 whose desires are many:-- in some things he may be able to keep his heart,
 but they will be few.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Tsang Hsî was fond of sheep-dates, and his son,
 the philosopher Tsang, could not bear to eat sheep-dates.'</p>
 
 <p>2. Kung-sun Ch'âu asked, saying, 'Which is best,-- minced meat and
 broiled meat, or sheep-dates?' Mencius said, 'Mince and broiled meat, to be
 sure.' Kung-sun Ch'âu went on, 'Then why did the philosopher Tsang
 eat mince and broiled meat, and would not eat sheep-dates?' Mencius
 answered, 'For mince and broiled meat there is a common liking, while that
 for sheep-dates was peculiar. We avoid the name, but do not avoid the
 surname. The surname is common; the name is peculiar.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Wan Chang asked, saying, 'Confucius, when he was in Ch'an, said: "Let
 me return. The scholars of my school are ambitious, but hasty. They are for
 advancing and seizing their object, but cannot forget their early ways."
 Why did Confucius, when he was in Ch'an, think of the ambitious scholars of
 Lû?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'Confucius not getting men pursuing the true medium,
 to whom he might communicate his instructions, determined to take the
 ardent and the cautiously-decided. The ardent would advance to seize their
 object; the cautiously-decided would keep themselves from certain things.
 It is not to be thought that Confucius did not wish to get men pursuing the
 true medium, but being unable to assure himself of finding such, he
 therefore thought of the next class.'</p>
 
 <p>3. 'I venture to ask what sort of men they were who could be styled "The
 ambitious?"'</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Such,' replied Mencius, 'as Ch'in Chang, Tsang Hsî, and
 Mû P'ei, were those whom Confucius styled "ambitious."'</p>
 
 <p>5. 'Why were they styled "ambitious?"'</p>
 
 <p>6. The reply was, 'Their aim led them to talk magniloquently, saying, "The
 ancients!" "The ancients!" But their actions, where we fairly compare them
 with their words, did not correspond with them.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'When he found also that he could not get such as were thus
 ambitious, he wanted to get scholars who would consider anything impure as
 beneath them. Those were the cautiously-decided, a class next to the
 former.'</p>
 
 <p>8. Chang pursued his questioning, 'Confucius said, "They are only your
 good careful people of the villages at whom I feel no indignation, when
 they pass my door without entering my house. Your good careful people of
 the villages are the thieves of virtue." What sort of people were they who
 could be styled "Your good careful people of the villages?"'</p>
 
 <p>9. Mencius replied, 'They are those who say, "Why are they so
 magniloquent? Their words have not respect to their actions and their
 actions have not respect to their words, but they say, "The ancients! The
 ancients! Why do they act so peculiarly, and are so cold and distant? Born
 in this age, we should be of this age, to be good is all that is needed."
 Eunuch-like, flattering their generation;-- such are your good careful men
 of the villages.'</p>
 
 <p>10. Wan Chang said, 'Their whole village styles those men good and
 careful. In all their conduct they are so. How was it that Confucius
 considered them the thieves of virtue?'</p>
 
 <p>11. Mencius replied, 'If you would blame them, you find nothing to
 allege. If you would criticise them, you have nothing to criticise. They
 agree with the current customs. They consent with an impure age. Their
 principles have a semblance of right-heartedness and truth. Their conduct
 has a semblance of disinterestedness and purity. All men are pleased with
 them, and they think themselves right, so that it is impossible to proceed
 with them to the principles of Yâo and Shun. On this account they are
 called "The thieves of virtue."</p>
 
 <p>12. 'Confucius said, "I hate a semblance which is not the reality. I
 hate the darnel, lest it be confounded with the corn. I hate
 glib-tonguedness, lest it be confounded with righteousness. I hate
 sharpness of tongue, lest it be confounded with sincerity. I hate the music
 of Chang, lest it be confounded with the true music. I hate the reddish
 blue, lest it be confounded with vermilion. I hate your good careful men of
 the villages, lest they be confounded with the truly virtuous."</p>
 
 <p>13. 'The superior man seeks simply to bring back the unchanging
 standard, and, that being correct, the masses are roused to virtue. 
 When they are so aroused, forthwith perversities and glossed wickedness
 disappear.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'From Yâo and Shun down to T'ang were 500 years
 and more. As to Yu and Kâo Yâo, they saw those earliest sages,
 and so knew their doctrines, while T'ang heard their doctrines as
 transmitted, and so knew them.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'From T'ang to king Wan were 500 years and more. As to Î Yin,
 and Lâi Chû, they saw T'ang and knew his doctrines, while king
 Wan heard them as transmitted, and so knew them.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'From king Wan to Confucius were 500 years and more. As to
 T'âi-kung Wang and San Î-shang, they saw Wan, and so knew his
 doctrines, while Confucius heard them as transmitted, and so knew
 them.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'From Confucius downwards until now, there are only 100 years and
 somewhat more. The distance in time from the sage is so far from being
 remote, and so very near at hand was the sage's residence. In these
 circumstances, is there no one to transmit his doctrines? Yea, is there no
 one to do so?'</p>
