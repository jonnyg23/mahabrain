 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 10</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. There came from Ch'û to T'ang one Hsü Hsing, who gave out
 that he acted according to the words of Shan-nang. Coming right to his
 gate, he addressed the duke Wan, saying, 'A man of a distant region, I have
 heard that you, Prince, are practising a benevolent government, and I wish
 to receive a site for a house, and to become one of your people.' The duke
 Wan gave him a dwelling-place. His disciples, amounting to several tens,
 all wore clothes of haircloth, and made sandals of hemp and wove mats for a
 living.</p>
 
 <p>2. At the same time, Ch'an Hsiang, a disciple of Ch'an Liang, and his
 younger brother, Hsin, with their plough-handles and shares on their backs,
 came from Sung to T'ang, saying, 'We have heard that you, Prince, are
 putting into practice the government of the ancient sages, showing that you
 are likewise a sage. We wish to become the subjects of a sage.'</p>
 
 <p>3. When Ch'an Hsiang saw Hsü Hsing, he was greatly pleased with
 him, and, abandoning entirely whatever he had learned, became his disciple.
 Having an interview with Mencius, he related to him with approbation the
 words of Hsü Hsing to the following effect:-- 'The prince of T'ang is
 indeed a worthy prince. He has not yet heard, however, the real doctrines
 of antiquity. Now, wise and able princes should cultivate the ground
 equally and along with their people, and eat the fruit of their labour.
 They should prepare their own meals, morning and evening, while at the same
 time they carry on their government. But now, the prince of T'ang has his
 granaries, treasuries, and arsenals, which is an oppressing of the people
 to nourish himself. How can he be deemed a real worthy prince?'</p>
 
 <p>4. Mencius said,'I suppose that Hsü Hsing sows grain and eats the
 produce. Is it not so?' 'It is so,' was the answer. 'I suppose also he
 weaves cloth, and wears his own manufacture. Is it not so?' 'No. Hsü
 wears clothes of haircloth.' 'Does he wear a cap?' 'He wears a cap.' 'What
 kind of cap?' 'A plain cap.' 'Is it woven by himself?' 'No. He gets it in
 exchange for grain.' 'Why does Hsü not weave it himself?' 'That would
 injure his husbandry.' 'Does Hsü cook his food in boilers and
 earthenware pans, and does he plough with an iron share?' 'Yes.' 'Does he
 make those articles himself?' 'No. He gets them in exchange for
 grain.'</p>
 
 <p>5. Mencius then said, 'The getting those various articles in exchange for
 grain, is not oppressive to the potter and the founder, and the potter and
 the founder in their turn, in exchanging their various articles for grain,
 are not oppressive to the husbandman. How should such a thing be supposed?
 And moreover, why does not Hsü act the potter and founder, supplying
 himself with the articles which he uses solely from his own establishment?
 Why does he go confusedly dealing and exchanging with the handicraftsmen?
 Why does he not spare himself so much trouble?' Ch'an Hsiang replied, 'The
 business of the handicraftsman can by no means be carried on along with the
 business of husbandry.'</p>
 
 <p>6. Mencius resumed, 'Then, is it the government of the kingdom which
 alone can be carried on along with the practice of husbandry? Great men
 have their proper business, and little men have their proper business.
 Moreover, in the case of any single individual, whatever articles he can
 require are ready to his hand, being produced by the various
 handicraftsmen:-- if he must first make them for his own use, this way of
 doing would keep all the people running about upon the roads. Hence, there
 is the saying, "Some labour with their minds, and some labour with their
 strength. Those who labour with their minds govern others; those who labour
 with their strength are governed by others. Those who are governed by
 others support them; those who govern others are supported by them." This
 is a principle universally recognised.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'In the time of Yâo, when the world had not yet been perfectly
 reduced to order, the vast waters, flowing out of their channels, made a
 universal inundation. Vegetation was luxuriant, and birds and beasts
 swarmed. The various kinds of grain could not be grown. The birds and
 beasts pressed upon men. The paths marked by the feet of beasts and prints
 of birds crossed one another throughout the Middle Kingdom. To Yâo
 alone this caused anxious sorrow. He raised Shun to office, and measures to
 regulate the disorder were set forth. Shun committed to Yî the
 direction of the fire to be employed, and Yî set fire to, and
 consumed, the forests and vegetation on the mountains and in the marshes,
 so that the birds and beasts fled away to hide themselves. Yü
 separated the nine streams, cleared the courses of the Tsî and
 T'â, and led them all to the sea. He opened a vent also for the
 Zû and Han, and regulated the course of the Hwâ'i and Sze, so
 that they all flowed into the Chiang. When this was done, it became
 possible for the people of the Middle Kingdom to cultivate the ground and
 get food for themselves. During that time, Yü was eight years away
 from his home, and though he thrice passed the door of it, he did not
 enter. Although he had wished to cultivate the ground, could he have done
 so?'</p>
 
 <p>8. 'The Minister of Agriculture taught the people to sow and reap,
 cultivating the five kinds of grain. When the five kinds of grain were
 brought to maturity, the people all obtained a subsistence. But men possess
 a moral nature; and if they are well fed, warmly clad, and comfortably
 lodged, without being taught at the same time, they become almost like the
 beasts. This was a subject of anxious solicitude to the sage Shun, and he
 appointed Hsieh to be the Minister of Instruction, to teach the relations
 of humanity:-- how, between father and son, there should be affection;
 between sovereign and minister, righteousness; between husband and wife,
 attention to their separate functions; between old and young, a proper
 order; and between friends, fidelity. The high meritorious sovereign said
 to him, "Encourage them; lead them on; rectify them; straighten them; help
 them; give them wings:-- thus causing them to become possessors of
 themselves. Then follow this up by stimulating them, and conferring
 benefits on them." When the sages were exercising their solicitude for the
 people in this way, had they leisure to cultivate the ground?</p>
 
 <p>9. 'What Yâo felt giving him anxiety was the not getting Shun.
 What Shun felt giving him anxiety was the not getting Yü and Kâo
 Yâo. But he whose anxiety is about his hundred mâu not being
 properly cultivated, is a mere husbandman.</p>
 
 <p>10. 'The imparting by a man to others of his wealth, is called
 "kindness." The teaching others what is good, is called "the exercise of
 fidelity." The finding a man who shall benefit the kingdom, is called
 "benevolence." Hence to give the throne to another man would be easy; to
 find a man who shall benefit the kingdom is difficult.</p>
 
 <p>11. 'Confucius said, "Great indeed was Yâo as a sovereign. It is
 only Heaven that is great, and only Yâo corresponded to it. How vast
 was his virtue! The people could find no name for it. Princely indeed was
 Shun! How majestic was he, having possession of the kingdom, and yet
 seeming as if it were nothing to him!" In their governing the kingdom, were
 there no subjects on which Yâo and Shun employed their minds? There
 were subjects, only they did not employ their minds on the cultivation of
 the ground.</p>
 
 <p>12. 'I have heard of men using the doctrines of our great land to change
 barbarians, but I have never yet heard of any being changed by barbarians.
 Ch'an Liang was a native of Ch'û. Pleased with the doctrines of
 Châu-kung and Chung-nE, he came northwards to the Middle Kingdom and
 studied them. Among the scholars of the northern regions, there was perhaps
 no one who excelled him. He was what you call a scholar of high and
 distinguished qualities. You and your brother followed him some tens of
 years, and when your master died, you forthwith turned away from him.</p>
 
 <p>13. 'Formerly, when Confucius died, after three vears had elapsed, his
 disciples collected their baggage, and prepared to return to their several
 homes. But on entering to take their leave of Tsze-kung, as they looked
 towards one another, they wailed, till they all lost their voices. After
 this they returned to their homes, but Tsze-kung went back, and built a
 house for himself on the altar-ground, where he lived alone other three
 years, before he returned home. On another occasion, Tsze-hsiâ,
 Tsze-chang, and Tsze-yû, thinking that Yû Zo resembled the
 sage, wished to render to him the same observances which they had rendered
 to Confucius. They tried to force the disciple Tsang to join with them, but
 he said, "This may not be done. What has been washed in the waters of the
 Chiang and Han, and bleached in the autumn sun:-- how glistening is it!
 Nothing can be added to it."</p>
 
 <p>14. 'Now here is this shrike-tongued barbarian of the south, whose
 doctrines are not those of the ancient kings. You turn away from your
 master and become his disciple. Your conduct is different indeed from that
 of the philosopher Tsang.</p>
 
 <p>15. 'I have heard of birds leaving dark valleys to remove to lofty
 trees, but I have not heard of their descending from lofty trees to enter
 into dark valleys.</p>
 
 <p>16. 'In the Praise-songs of Lû it is said,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 "He smote the barbarians of the west and the north,<br>
 He punished Ching and Shû."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p class="noindent">Thus Châu-kung would be sure to smite them, and
 you become their disciple again; it appears that your change is not
 good.'</p>
 
 <p>17. Ch'an Hsiang said, 'If Hsü's doctrines were followed, then
 there would not be two prices in the market, nor any deceit in the
 kingdom. If a boy of five cubits were sent to the market, no one would
 impose on him; linen and silk of the same length would be of the same
 price. So it would be with bundles of hemp and silk, being of the same
 weight; with the different kinds of grain, being the same in quantity; and
 with shoes which were of the same size.'</p>
 
 <p>18. Mencius replied, 'It is the nature of things to be of unequal
 quality. Some are twice, some five times, some ten times, some a hundred
 times, some a thousand times, some ten thousand times as valuable as
 others. If you reduce them all to the same standard, that must throw the
 kingdom into confusion. If large shoes and small shoes were of the same
 price, who would make them? For people to follow the doctrines of Hsü,
 would be for them to lead one another on to practise deceit. How can they
 avail for the government of a State?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The Mohist, Î Chih, sought, through Hsü Pî, to see
 Mencius. Mencius said, 'I indeed wish to see him, but at present I am still
 unwell. When I am better, I will myself go and see him. He need not come
 here again.'</p>
 
 <p>2. Next day, Î Chih again sought to see Mencius. Mencius said,
 'To-day I am able to see him. But if I do not correct his errors, the true
 principles will not be fully evident. Let me first correct him. I have
 heard that this Î is a Mohist. Now Mo considers that in the
 regulation of funeral matters a spare simplicity should be the rule.
 Î thinks with Mo's doctrines to change the customs of the kingdom;--
 how does he regard them as if they were wrong, and not honour them?
 Notwithstanding his views, Î buried his parents in a sumptuous
 manner, and so he served them in the way which his doctrines
 discountenance.'</p>
 
 <p>3. The disciple Hsü informed Î of these remarks. Î
 said, 'Even according to the principles of the learned, we find that the
 ancients acted towards the people "as if they were watching over an
 infant." What does this expression mean? To me it sounds that we are to
 love all without difference of degree; but the manifestation of love must
 begin with our parents.' Hsü reported this reply to Mencius, who said,
 'Now, does Î really think that a man's affection for the child of his
 brother is merely like his affection for the infant of a neighbour? What is
 to be approved in that expression is simply this:-- that if an infant
 crawling about is likely to fall into a well, it is no crime in the infant.
 Moreover, Heaven gives birth to creatures in such a way that they have one
 root, and Î makes them to have two roots. This is the cause of his
 error.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'And, in the most ancient times, there were some who did not inter
 their parents. When their parents died, they took them up and threw them
 into some water-channel. Afterwards, when passing by them, they saw foxes
 and wild-cats devouring them, and flies and gnats biting at them. The
 perspiration started out upon their foreheads, and they looked away, unable
 to bear the sight. It was not on account of other people that this
 perspiration flowed. The emotions of their hearts affected their faces and
 eyes, and instantly they went home, and came back with baskets and spades
 and covered the bodies. If the covering them thus was indeed right, you may
 see that the filial son and virtuous man, in interring in a handsome manner
 their parents, act according to a proper rule.'</p>
 
 <p>5. The disciple Hsü informed Î of what Mencius had said.
 Î was thoughtful for a short time, and then said, 'He has instructed
 me.'</p>
