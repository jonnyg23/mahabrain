 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 2</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius went to see the king Hsiang of Liang.</p>
 
 <p>2. On coming out from the interview, he said to some persons, 'When I
 looked at him from a distance, he did not appear like a sovereign; when I
 drew near to him, I saw nothing venerable about him. Abruptly he asked me,
 "How can the kingdom be settled?" I replied, "It will be settled by being
 united under one sway."</p>
 
 <p>3. '"Who can so unite it?"</p>
 
 <p>4. 'I replied, "He who has no pleasure in killing men can so unite
 it."</p>
 
 <p>5. "'Who can give it to him?"</p>
 
 <p>6. 'I replied, " All the people of the nation will unanimously
 give it to him. Does your Majesty understand the way of the growing grain?
 During the seventh and eighth months, when drought prevails, the plants
 become dry. Then the clouds collect densely in the heavens, they send down
 torrents of rain, and the grain erects itself, as if by a shoot. When it
 does so, who can keep it back? Now among the shepherds of men throughout
 the nation, there is not one who does not find pleasure in killing men. If
 there were one who did not find pleasure in killing men, all the people in
 the nation would look towards him with outstretched necks. Such being
 indeed the case, the people would flock to him, as water flows downwards
 with a rush, which no one can repress."'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The king Hsüan of Ch'î asked, saying, 'May
 I be informed by you of the transactions of Hwan of Ch'î, and Wan of
 Tsin?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'There were none of the disciples of Chuncg-nî who
 spoke about the affairs of Hwan and WAn, and therefore they have not been
 transmitted to these after-ages ;-- your servant has not heard them. If you
 will have me speak, let it be about royal government.'</p>
 
 <p>3. The king said, 'What virtue must there be in order to attain to royal
 sway?' Mencius answered, 'The love and protection of the people; with this
 there is no power which can prevent a ruler from attaining to it.'</p>
 
 <p>4. The king asked again, 'Is such an one as I competent to love and protect
 the people?' Mencius said, 'Yes.' 'How do you know that I am competent for
 that?' 'I heard the following incident from Hû Ho:-- "The king," said
 he, "was sitting aloft in the hall, when a man appeared, leading an ox past
 the lower part of it. The king saw him, and asked, Where is the ox going?
 The man replied, We are going to consecrate a bell with its blood. The king
 said, Let it go. I cannot bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an
 innocent person going to the place of death. The man answered, Shall we
 then omit the consecration of the bell ? The king said, How can that be
 omitted? Change it for a sheep." I do not know whether this incident really
 occurred.'</p>
 
 <p>5. The king replied, 'It did,' and then Mencius said, 'The heart
 seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the royal sway. The
 people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal, but
 your servant knows surely, that it was your Majesty's not being able
 to bear the sight, which made you do as you did.'</p>
 
 <p>6. The king said, 'You are right. And yet there really was an appearance of
 what the people condemned. But though Chî be a small and narrow
 State, how should I grudge one ox? Indeed it was because I could not bear its
 frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place
 of death, that therefore I changed it for a sheep.'</p>
 
 <p>7. Mencius pursued, 'Let not your Majesty deem it strange that the people
 should think you were grudging the animal. When you changed a large one for
 a small, how should they know the true reason? If you felt pained by its
 being led without guilt to the place of death, what was there to choose
 between an ox and a sheep?  The king laughed and said, 'What really was my
 mind in the matter?  I did not grudge the expense of it, and changed it for
 a sheep!-- There was reason in the people's saying that I grudged it.'</p>
 
 <p>8. 'There is no harm in their saying so,' said Mencius. 'Your conduct was
 an artifice of benevolence. You saw the ox, and had not seen the sheep. So
 is the superior man affected towards animals, that, having seen them alive,
 he cannot bear to see them die; having heard their dying cries, he cannot
 bear to eat their flesh. Therefore he keeps away from his slaughter-house
 and cook-room.'</p>
 
 <p>9. The king was pleased, and said, 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,
 "The minds of others, I am able by reflection to measure;" -- this is
 verified, my Master, in your discovery of my motive. I indeed did
 the thing, but when I turned my thoughts inward, and examined into it, I
 could not discover my own mind. When you, Master, spoke those words, the
 movements of compassion began to work in my mind. How is it that this heart
 has in it what is equal to the royal sway?'</p>
 
 <p>10. Mencius replied, 'Suppose a man were to make this statement to your
 Majesty:-- "My strength is sufficient to lift three thousand catties, but
 it is not sufficient to lift one feather;-- my eyesight is sharp enough to
 examine the point of an autumn hair, but I do not see a waggon-load of
 faggots;-- "would your Majesty allow what he said?' 'No,' was the answer,
 on which Mencius proceeded, 'Now here is kindness sufficient to reach to
 animals, and no benefits are extended from it to the people.-- How is this?
 Is an exception to be made here? The truth is, the feather is not lifted ,
 because strength is not used; the waggon-load of firewood is not seen,
 because the eyesight is not used; and the people are not loved and
 protected, because kindness is not employed. Therefore your Majesty's not
 exercising the royal sway, is because you do not do it, not because you are
 not able to do it.'</p>
 
 <p>11. The king asked, 'How may the difference between the not doing a thing,
 and the not being able to do it, be represented? Mencius replied,'In such a
 thing as taking the T'âi mountain under your arm, and leaping over
 the north sea with it, if you say to people-- "I am not able to do it,"
 that is a real case of not being able. In such a matter as breaking off a
 branch from a tree at the order of a superior, if you say to people-- "I am
 not able to do it," that is a case of not doing it, it is not a case of not
 being able to do it. Therefore your Majesty's not exercising the royal
 sway, is not such a case as that of taking the T'âi mountain under
 your arm, and leaping over the north sea with it. Your Majesty's not
 exercising the royal sway is a case like that of breaking off a branch from
 a tree.</p>
 
 <p>12. 'Treat with the reverence due to age the elders in your own family, so
 that the elders in the families of others shall be similarly treated; treat
 with the kindness due to youth the young in your own family, so that the
 young in the families of others shall be similarly treated:-- do this, and
 the kingdom may be made to go round in your palm. It is said in the Book of
 Poetry, "His example affected his wife. It reached to his brothers, and his
 family of the State was governed by it."-- The language shows how king Wan
 simply took his kindly heart, and exercised it towards those parties.
 Therefore the carrying out his kindness of heart by a prince will suffice
 for the love and protection of all within the four seas, and if he do not
 carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife and children. The way
 in which the ancients came greatly to surpass other men, was no other but
 this:-- simply that they knew well how to carry out, so as to affect
 others, what they themselves did. Now your kindness is sufficient to reach
 to animals, and no benefits are extended from it to reach the people.-- How
 is this? Is an exception to be made here?</p>
 
 <p>13. 'By weighing, we know what things are light, and what heavy.  By
 measuring, we know what things are long, and what short.  The relations of
 all things may be thus determined, and it is of the greatest importance to
 estimate the motions of the mind. I beg your Majesty to measure it.</p>
 
 <p>14. 'You collect your equipments of war, endanger your soldiers and
 officers, and excite the resentment of the other princes;-- do these things
 cause you pleasnre in your mind?'</p>
 
 <p>15. The king replied, 'No.  How should I derive pleasure from these things?
 My object in them is to seek for what I greatly desire.'</p>
 
 <p>16. Mencius said, 'May I hear from you what it is that you greatly desire?'
 The king laughed and did not speak. Mencius resumed, 'Are you led to desire
 it, because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for your mouth? Or
 because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for your body? Or
 because you have not enough of beautifully coloured objects to delight your
 eyes? Or because you have not voices and tones enough to please your ears?
 Or because you have not enough of attendants and favourites to stand before
 you and receive your orders?  Your Majesty's various officers are
 sufficient to supply you with those things. How can your Majesty be led to
 entertain such a desire on account of them?' 'No,' said the king; 'my
 desire is not on account of them.' Mencius added, 'Then, what your Majesty
 greatly desires may be known. You wish to enlarge your territories, to have
 Ch'in and Ch'û wait at your court, to rule the Middle Kingdom, and to
 attract to you the barbarous tribes that surround it. But doing what you do
 to seek for what you desire is like climbing a tree to seek for fish.'</p>
 
 <p>17. The king said, 'Is it so bad as that?' 'It is even worse,' was the 
 reply. 'If you climb a tree to seek for fish, although you do
 not get the fish, you will not suffer any subsequent calamity. But doing
 what you do to seek for what you desire, doing it moreover with all your
 heart, you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamities.' The king asked,
 'May I hear from you the proof of that?' Mencius said, 'If the people of
 Tsâu should fight with the people of Ch'û, which of them does
 your Majesty think would conquer?' 'The people of Ch'û would
 conquer.' 'Yes;-- and so it is certain that a small country cannot contend
 with  a great, that few cannot contend with many, that the weak cannot
 contend with the strong. The territory within the four seas embraces nine
 divisions, each of a thousand lî square. All Ch'î together is
 but one of them. If with one part you try to subdue the other eight, what
 is the difference between that and Tsâu's contending with Ch'û?
 For, with such a desire, you must turn back to the proper course for its
 attainment.</p>
 
 <p>18. 'Now if your Majesty will institute a government whose action shall be
 benevolent, this will cause all the officers in the kingdom to wish to
 stand in your Majesty's court, and all the farmers to wish to plough in
 your Majesty's fields, and all the merchants, both travelling and
 stationary, to wish to store their goods in your Majesty's market-places,
 and all travelling strangers to wish to make their tours on your Majesty's
 roads, and all throughout the kingdom who feel aggrieved by their rulers to
 wish to come and complain to your Majesty. And when they are so bent, who
 will be able to keep them back?'</p>
 
 <p>19. The king said, 'I am stupid, and not able to advance to this. I wish
 you, my Master, to assist my intentions. Teach me clearly; although I am
 deficient in intelligence and vigour, I will essay and try to carry your
 instructions into effect.'</p>
 
 <p>20. Mencius replied, 'They are only men of education, who, without a
 certain livelihood, are able to maintain a fixed heart. As to the people,
 if they have not a certain livelihood, it follows that they will not have a
 fixed heart. And if they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which
 they will not do, in the way of self-abandonment, of moral deflection, of
 depravity, and of wild license. When they thus have been involved in crime,
 to follow them up and punish them;-- this is to entrap the people. How can
 such a thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a
 benevolent man?</p>
 
 <p>21. 'Therefore an intelligent ruler will regulate the livelihood of the
 people, so as to make sure that, for those above them, they shall have
 sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and, for those below them,
 sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; that in good
 years they shall always be abundantly satisfied, and that in bad years they
 shall escape the danger of perishing. After this he may urge them, and they
 will proceed to what is good, for in this case the people will follow after
 it with ease.</p>
 
 <p>22. 'Now, the livelihood of the people is so regulated, that, above, they
 have not sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and, below, they have
 not sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children.
 Notwithstanding good years, their lives are continually embittered, and, in
 bad years, they do not escape perishing. In such circumstances they only
 try to save themselves from death, and are afraid they will not succeed.
 What leisure have they to cultivate propriety and righteousness?'</p>
 
 <p>23. 'If your Majesty wishes to effect this regulation of the livelihood
 of the people, why not turn to that which is the essential step to it?</p>
 
 <p>24. 'Let mulberry-trees be planted about the homesteads with their five
 mâu, and persons of fifty years may be clothed with silk. In keeping
 fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their times of breeding be neglected,
 and persons of seventy years may eat flesh. Let there not be taken away the
 time that is proper for the cultivation of the farm with its hundred
 mâu, and the family of eight mouths that is supported by it shall not
 suffer from hunger. Let careful attention be paid to educatlon in
 schools,-- the inculcation in it especially of the filial and fraternal
 duties, and grey-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying
 burdens on their backs or on their heads. It never has been that the ruler
 of a State where such results were seen,-- the old wearing silk and eating
 flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunger nor
 cold,-- did not attain to the royal dignity.'</p>
