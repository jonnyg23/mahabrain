 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 11</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. Ch'an Tâi said to Mencius, 'In not going to wait upon any of
 the princes, you seem to me to be standing on a small point. If now you
 were once to wait upon them, the result might be so great that you would
 make one of them sovereign, or, if smaller, that you would make one of them
 chief of all the other princes. Moreover, the History says, "By bending
 only one cubit, you make eight cubits straight." It appears to me like a
 thing which might be done.'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius said, 'Formerly, the duke Ching of Ch'î, once when he
 was hunting, called his forester to him by a flag. The forester would not
 come, and the duke was going to kill him. With reference to this incident,
 Confucius said, "The determined officer never forgets that his end may be
 in a ditch or a stream; the brave officer never forgets that he may lose
 his head." What was it in the forester that Confucius thus approved? He
 approved his not going to the duke, when summoned by the article which was
 not appropriate to him. If one go to see the princes without waiting to be
 invited, what can be thought of him?</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Moreover, that sentence, "By bending only one cubit, you make
 eight cubits straight," is spoken with reference to the gain that may be
 got. If gain be the object, then, if it can be got by bending eight cubits
 to make one cubit straight, may we likewise do that?</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Formerly, the officer Châo Chien made Wang Liang act as
 charioteer for his favourite Hsî, when, in the course of a whole day,
 they did not get a single bird. The favourite Hsî reported this
 result, saying, "He is the poorest charioteer in the world." Some one told
 this to Wang Liang, who said, "I beg leave to try again." By dint of
 pressing, this was accorded to him, when in one morning they got ten birds.
 The favourite, reporting this result, said, "He is the best charioteer in
 the world." Chien said, "I will make him always drive your chariot for
 you." When he told Wang Liang so, however, Liang refused, saying, "I drove
 for him, strictly observing the proper rules for driving, and in the whole
 day he did not get one bird. I drove for him so as deceitfully to intercept
 the birds, and in one morning he got ten. It is said in the Book of
 Poetry,</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 'There is no failure in the management of their horses;<br>
 The arrows are discharged surely, like the blows of an axe.'
 </blockquote>
 
 <p class="noindent">I am not accustomed to drive for a mean man. I beg
 leave to decline the office."</p>
 
 <p>5. 'Thus this charioteer even was ashamed to bend improperly to the will
 of such an archer. Though, by bending to it, they would have caught birds
 and animals sufficient to form a hill, he would not do so. If I were to
 bend my principles and follow those princes, of what kind would my conduct
 be? And you are wrong. Never has a man who has bent himself been able to
 make others straight.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>2. Mencius said, 'How can such men be great men? Have you not read the
 Ritual Usages?-- "At the capping of a young man, his father admonishes him.
 At the marrying away of a young woman, her mother admonishes her,
 accompanying her to the door on her leaving, and cautioning her with these
 words, 'You are going to your home. You must be respectful; you must be
 careful. Do not disobey your husband.'" Thus, to look upon compliance as
 their correct course is the rule for women.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'To dwell in the wide house of the world, to stand in the correct
 seat of the world, and to walk in the great path of the world; when he
 obtains his desire for office, to practise his principles for the good of
 the people; and when that desire is disappointed, to practise them alone;
 to be above the power of riches and honours to make dissipated, of poverty
 and mean condition to make swerve from principle, and of power and force to
 make bend:-- these characteristics constitute the great man.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Châu Hsiâo asked Mencius, saying, 'Did superior men of
 old time take office?' Mencius replied, 'They did. The Record says, "If
 Confucius was three months without being employed by some ruler, he looked
 anxious and unhappy. When he passed from the boundary of a State, he was
 sure to carry with him his proper gift of introduction." Kung-ming Î
 said, "Among the ancients, if an officer was three months unemployed by a
 ruler, he was condoled with."'</p>
 
 <p>2. Hsiâo said, 'Did not this condoling, on being three months
 unemployed by a ruler, show a too great urgency?'</p>
 
 <p>3. Mencius answered, 'The loss of his place to an officer is like the
 loss of his State to a prince. It is said in the Book of Rites, "A prince
 ploughs himself, and is assisted by the people, to supply the millet for
 sacrifice. His wife keeps silkworms, and unwinds their cocoons, to make the
 garments for sacrifice." If the victims be not perfect, the millet not
 pure, and the dress not complete, he does not presume to sacrifice. "And
 the scholar who, out of office, has no holy field, in the same way, does
 not sacrifice. The victims for slaughter, the vessels, and the garments,
 not being all complete, he does not presume to sacrifice, and then neither
 may he dare to feel happy." Is there not here sufficient ground also for
 condolence?'</p>
 
 <p>4. Hsiâo again asked, 'What was the meaning of Confucius's always
 carrying his proper gift of introduction with him, when he passed over the
 boundaries of the State where he had been?'</p>
 
 <p>5. 'An officer's being in office,' was the reply, 'is like the ploughing
 of a husbandman. Does a husbandman part with his plough, because he goes
 from one State to another?'</p>
 
 <p>6. Hsiâo pursued, 'The kingdom of Tsin is one, as well as others,
 of official employments, but I have not heard of anyone being thus earnest
 about being in office. If there should be this urge why does a superior man
 make any difficulty about taking it?' Mencius answered, 'When a son is
 born, what is desired for him is that he may have a wife; when a daughter
 is born, what is desired for her is that she may have a husband. This
 feeling of the parents is possessed by all men. If the young people,
 without waiting for the orders of their parents, and the arrangements of
 the go-betweens, shall bore holes to steal a sight of each other, or get
 over the wall to be with each other, then their parents and all other
 people will despise them. The ancients did indeed always desire to be in
 office, but they also hated being so by any improper way. To seek office by
 an improper way is of a class with young people's boring holes.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. P'ang Kang asked Mencius, saying, 'Is it not an extravagant procedure
 to go from one prince to another and live upon them, followed by several
 tens of carriages, and attended by several hundred men?' Mencius replied,
 'If there be not a proper ground for taking it, a single bamboo-cup of rice
 may not be received from a man. If there be such a proper ground, then
 Shun's receiving the kingdom from Yâo is not to be considered
 excessive. Do you think it was excessive?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Kang said, 'No. But for a scholar performing no service to receive
 his support notwithstanding is improper.'</p>
 
 <p>3. Mencius answered, 'If you do not have an intercommunication of the
 productions of labour, and an interchange of men's services, so that one
 from his overplus may supply the deficiency of another, then husbandmen
 will have a superfluity of grain, and women will have a superfluity of
 cloth. If you have such an interchange, carpenters and carriage-wrights may
 all get their food from you. Here now is a man, who, at home, is filial,
 and abroad, respectful to his elders; who watches over the principles of
 the ancient kings, awaiting the rise of future learners:-- and yet you will
 refuse to support him. How is it that you give honour to the carpenter and
 carriage-wright, and slight him who practises benevolence and
 righteousness?'</p>
 
 <p>4. P'ang Kang said, 'The aim of the carpenter and carriagewright is by
 their trades to seek for a living. Is it also the aim of the superior man
 in his practice of principles thereby to seek for a living?' 'What have you
 to do,' returned Mencius, 'with his purpose? He is of service to you. He
 deserves to be supported, and should be supported. And let me ask,-- Do you
 remunerate a man's intention, or do you remunerate his service.' To this
 Kang replied, 'I remunerate his intention.'</p>
 
 <p>5. Mencius said, 'There is a man here, who breaks your tiles, and draws
 unsightly figures on your walls;-- his purpose may be thereby to seek for
 his living, but will you indeed remunerate him?' 'No,' said Kang; and
 Mencius then concluded, 'That being the case, it is not the purpose which
 you remunerate, but the work done.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'Sung is a small State. Its ruler is
 now setting about to practise the true royal government, and Ch'î and
 Ch'û hate and attack him. What in this case is to be done?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'When T'ang dwelt in Po, he adjoined to the State of
 Ko, the chief of which was living in a dissolute state and neglecting his
 proper sacrifices. T'ang sent messengers to inquire why he did not
 sacrifice. He replied, "I have no means of supplying the necessary
 victims." On this, T'ang caused oxen and sheep to be sent to him, but he
 ate them, and still continued not to sacrifice. T'ang again sent messengers
 to ask him the same question as before, when he replied, "I have no means
 of obtaining the necessary millet."  On this, T'ang sent the mass of the
 people of Po to go and till the ground for him, while the old and feeble
 carried their food to them. The chief of Ko led his people to intercept
 those who were thus charged with wine, cooked rice, millet, and paddy, and
 took their stores from them, while they killed those who refused to give
 them up. There was a boy who had some millet and flesh for the labourers,
 who was thus slain and robbed. What is said in the Book of History, "The
 chief of Ko behaved as an enemy to the provision-carriers," has reference
 to this.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Because of his murder of this boy, T'ang proceeded to punish him.
 All within the four seas said, "It is not because he desires the riches of
 the kingdom, but to avenge a common man and woman."</p>
 
 <p>4. 'When T'ang began his work of executing justice, he commenced with Ko,
 and though he made eleven punitive expeditions, he had not an enemy in the
 kingdom. When he pursued his work in the east, the rude tribes in the west
 murmured. So did those on the north, when he was engaged in the south.
 Their cry was-- "Why does he make us last." Thus, the people's longing for
 him was like their longing for rain in a time of great drought. The
 frequenters of the markets stopped not. Those engaged in weeding in
 the fields made no change in their operations. While he punished their
 rulers, he consoled the people. His progress was like the falling of
 opportune rain, and the people were delighted. It is said in the Book of
 History, "We have waited for our prince. When our prince comes, we may
 escape from the punishments under which we suffer."</p>
 
 <p>5. 'There being some who would not become the subjects of Châu,
 king Wû proceeded to punish them on the east. He gave tranquillity to
 their people, who welcomed him with baskets full of their black and yellow
 silks, saying-- "From henceforth we shall serve the sovereign of our
 dynasty of Châu, that we may be made happy by him." So they joined
 themselves, as subjects, to the great city of Châu. Thus, the men of
 station of Shang took baskets full of black and yellow silks to meet the
 men of station of Châu, and the lower classes of the one met those of
 the other with baskets of rice and vessels of congee. Wû saved the
 people from the midst of fire and water, seizing only their oppressors, and
 destroying them.'</p>
 
 <p>6. 'In the Great Declaration it is said, "My power shall be put forth,
 and, invading the territories of Shang, I will seize the oppressor. I will
 put him to death to punish him:-- so shall the greatness of my work appear,
 more glorious than that of T'ang."</p>
 
 <p>7. 'Sung is not, as you say, practising true royal government, and so
 forth. If it were practising royal government, all within the four seas
 would be lifting up their heads, and looking for its prince, wishing to
 have him for their sovereign. Great as Ch'î and Ch'û are, what
 would there be to fear from them?'</p>
