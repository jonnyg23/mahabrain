 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 25</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'He who has exhausted all his mental constitution knows
 his nature. Knowing his nature, he knows Heaven.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'To preserve one's mental constitution, and nourish one's nature, is
 the way to serve Heaven.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'When neither a premature death nor long life causes a man any
 double-mindedness, but he waits in the cultivation of his personal
 character for whatever issue;-- this is the way in which he establishes his
 Heaven-ordained being.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'There is an appointment for everything. A man should
 receive submissively what may be correctly ascribed thereto.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Therefore, he who has the true idea of what is Heaven's appointment
 will not stand beneath a precipitous wall.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Death sustained in the discharge of one's duties may correctly be
 ascribed to the appointment of Heaven.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Death under handcuffs and fetters cannot correctly be so
 ascribed.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'When we get by our seeking and lose by our
 neglecting;-- in that case seeking is of use to getting, and the things
 sought for are those which are in ourselves.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'When the seeking is according to the proper course, and the getting
 is only as appointed;-- in that case the seeking is of no use to getting,
 and the things sought are without ourselves.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'All things are already complete in us.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'There is no greater delight than to be conscious of sincerity on
 self-examination.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'If one acts with a vigorous effort at the law of reciprocity, when
 he seeks for the realization of perfect virtue, nothing can be closer than
 his approximation to it.'</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>2. 'Those who form contrivances and versatile schemes distinguished for
 their artfulness, do not allow their sense of shame to come into action.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'When one differs from other men in not having this sense of shame, what
 will he have in common with them?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'The able and virtuous monarchs of antiquity loved virtue
 and forgot their power. And shall an exception be made of the able and
 virtuous scholars of antiquity, that they did not do the same? They
 delighted in their own principles, and were oblivious of the power of
 princes. Therefore, if kings and dukes did not show the utmost respect, and
 observe all forms of ceremony, they were not permitted to come frequently
 and visit them. If they thus found it not in their power to pay them
 frequent visits, how much less could they get to employ them as
 ministers?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said to Sung Kâu-ch'ien, 'Are you fond, Sir, of
 travelling to the different courts? I will tell you about such
 travelling.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'If a prince acknowledge you and follow your counsels, be perfectly
 satisfied. If no one do so, be the same.'</p>
 
 <p>3. Kâu-ch'ien said, 'What is to be done to secure this perfect
 satisfaction?' Mencius replied, 'Honour virtue and delight in
 righteousness, and so you may always be perfectly satisfied.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Therefore, a scholar, though poor, does not let go his righteousness;
 though prosperous, he does not leave his own path.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'Poor and not letting righteousness go;-- it is thus that the scholar
 holds possession of himself. Prosperous and not leaving the proper path;--
 it is thus that the expectations of the people from him are not
 disappointed.</p>
 
 <p>6. 'When the men of antiquity realized their wishes, benefits were
 conferred by them on the people. If they did not realize their wishes, they
 cultivated their personal character, and became illustrious in the world.
 If poor, they attended to their own virtue in solitude; if advanced to
 dignity, they made the whole kingdom virtuous as well.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'The mass of men wait for a king Wan, and then they will
 receive a rousing impulse. Scholars distinguished from the mass, without a
 king Wan, rouse themselves.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'Add to a man the families of Han and Wei. If he then look
 upon himself without being elated, he is far beyond the mass of men.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'Let the people be employed in the way which is intended
 to secure their ease, and though they be toiled, they will not murmur. Let
 them be put to death in the way which is intended to preserve their lives,
 and though they die, they will not murmur at him who puts them to
 death.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Under a chief, leading all the princes, the people
 look brisk and cheerful. Under a true sovereign, they have an air of deep
 contentment.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Though he slay them, they do not murmur. When he benefits them, they
 do not think of his merit. From day to day they make progress towards what
 is good, without knowing who makes them do so.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Wherever the superior man passes through, transformation follows;
 wherever he abides, his influence is of a spiritual nature. It flows
 abroad, above and beneath, like that of Heaven and Earth. How can it be
 said that he mends society but in a small way!'</p>
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Kindly words do not enter so deeply into men
 as a reputation for kindness.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Good government does not lay hold of the people so much as good
 instructions.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Good government is feared by the people, while good instructions are
 loved by them. Good government gets the people's wealth, while good
 instructions get their hearts.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'The ability possessed by men without having been
 acquired by learning is intuitive ability, and the knowledge possessed by
 them without the exercise of thought is their intuitive knowledge.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Children carried in the arms all know to love their parents, and when
 they are grown a little, they all know to love their elder brothers.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Filial affection for parents is the working of benevolence. Respect for
 elders is the working of righteousness. There is no other reason for those
 feelings;-- they belong to all under heaven.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'When Shun was living amid the deep retired mountains,
 dwelling with the trees and rocks, and wandering among the deer and swine,
 the difference between him and the rude inhabitants of those remote hills
 appeared very small. But when he heard a single good word, or saw a single
 good action, he was like a stream or a river bursting its banks, and
 flowing out in an irresistible flood.'</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>2. 'They are the friendless minister and concubine's son, who keep their
 hearts under a sense of peril, and use deep precautions against calamity.
 On this account they become distinguished for their intelligence.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>2. 'There are ministers who seek the tranquillity of the State, and find
 their pleasure in securing that tranquillity.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'There are those who are the people of Heaven. They, judging that, if
 they were in office, they could carry out their principles, throughout the
 kingdom, proceed so to carry them out.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'There are those who are great men. They rectify themselves and others
 are rectified.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>2. 'That his father and mother are both alive, and that the condition of
 his brothers affords no cause for anxiety;-- this is one delight.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'That, when looking up, he has no occasion for shame before Heaven,
 and, below, he has no occasion to blush before men;-- this is a second
 delight.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'That he can get from the whole kingdom the most talented individuals,
 and teach and nourish them;-- this is the third delight.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'The superior man has three things in which he delights, and to be
 ruler over the kingdom is not one of them.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Wide territory and a numerous people are
 desired by the superior man, but what he delights in is not here.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'To stand in the centre of the kingdom, and tranquillize the people
 within the four seas;-- the superior man delights in this, but the highest
 enjoyment of his nature is not here.</p>
 
 <p>3. What belongs by his nature to the superior man cannot be increased by
 the largeness of his sphere of action, nor diminished by his dwelling in
 poverty and retirement;-- for this reason that it is determinately
 apportioned to him by Heaven.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'What belongs by his nature to the superior man are benevolence,
 righteousness, propriety, and knowledge. These are rooted in his heart;
 their growth and manifestation are a mild harmony appearing in the
 countenance, a rich fullness in the back, and the character imparted to the
 four limbs. Those limbs understand to arrange themselves, without being
 told.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Po-î, that he might avoid Châu, was
 dwelling on the coast of the northern sea when he heard of the rise of king
 Wan. He roused himself and said, "Why should I not go and follow him? I
 have heard that the chief of the West knows well how to nourish the old."
 T'âi-kung, to avoid Châu, was dwelling on the coast of the
 eastern sea. When he heard of the rise of king Wan, he said, "Why should I
 not go and follow him? I have heard that the chief if the West knows well
 how to nourish the old." If there were a prince in the kingdom, who knew
 well how to nourish the old, all men of virtue would feel that he was the
 proper object for them to gather to.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Around the homestead with its five mâu, the space beneath the
 walls was planted with mulberry trees, with which the women nourished
 silkworms, and thus the old were able to have silk to wear. Each family had
 five brood hens and two brood sows, which were kept to their breeding
 seasons, and thus the old were able to have flesh to eat. The husbandmen
 cultivated their farms of 100 mâu, and thus their families of eight
 mouths were secured against want.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'The expression, "The chief of the West knows well how to nourish the
 old," refers to his regulation of the fields and dwellings, his teaching
 them to plant the mulberry and nourish those animals, and his instructing
 the wives and children, so as to make them nourish their aged. At fifty,
 warmth cannot be maintained without silks, and at seventy flesh is
 necessary to satisfy the appetite. Persons not kept warm nor supplied with
 food are said to be starved and famished, but among the people of king Wan,
 there were no aged who were starved or famished. This is the meaning of
 the expression in question.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Let it be seen to that their fields of grain and hemp
 are well cultivated, and make the taxes on them light;-- so the people may
 be made rich.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Let it be seen to that the people use their resources of food
 seasonably, and expend their wealth only on the prescribed ceremonies:-- so
 their wealth will be more than can be consumed.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'The people cannot live without water and fire, yet if you knock at
 a man's door in the dusk of the evening, and ask for water and fire, there
 is no man who will not give them, such is the abundance of these things. A
 sage governs the kingdom so as to cause pulse and grain to be as abundant
 as water and fire. When pulse and grain are as abundant as water and fire,
 how shall the people be other than virtuous?'</p>
