 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 24</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'The five chiefs of the princes were sinners against
 the three kings. The princes of the present day are sinners against the
 five chiefs. The Great officers of the present day are sinners against the
 princes.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'The sovereign visited the princes, which was called "A tour of
 Inspection." The princes attended at the court of the sovereign, which was
 called "Giving a report of office." It was a custom in the spring to
 examine the ploughing, and supply any deficiency of seed; and in autumn to
 examine the reaping, and assist where there was a deficiency of the crop.
 When the sovereign entered the boundaries of a State, if the new ground was
 being reclaimed, and the old fields well cultivated; if the old were
 nourished and the worthy honoured; and if men of distinguished talents were
 placed in office: then the prince was rewarded,-- rewarded with an addition
 to his territory. On the other hand, if, on entering a State, the ground
 was found left wild or overrun with weeds; if the old were neglected and
 the worthy unhonoured; and if the offices were filled with hard
 taxgatherers: then the prince was reprimanded. If a prince once omitted his
 attendance at court, he was punished by degradation of rank; if he did so a
 second time, be was deprived of a portion of his territory; if he did so a
 third time, the royal forces were set in motion, and he was removed from
 his government. Thus the sovereign commanded the punishment, but did not
 himself inflict it, while the princes inflicted the punishment, but did not
 command it. The five chiefs, however, dragged the princes to punish other
 princes, and hence I say that they were sinners against the three
 kings.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Of the five chiefs the most powerful was the duke Hwan. At the
 assembly of the princes in K'wei-ch'iû, he bound the victim and
 placed the writing upon it, but did not slay it to smear their mouths with
 the blood. The first injunction in their agreement was,-- "Slay the
 unfilial; change not the son who has been appointed heir; exalt not a
 concubine to be the wife." The second was,-- "Honour the worthy, and
 maintain the talented, to give distinction to the virtuous." The third
 was,-- "Respect the old, and be kind to the young. Be not forgetful of
 strangers and travellers." The fourth was, "Let not offices be hereditary,
 nor let officers be pluralists. In the selection of officers let the object
 be to get the proper men. Let not a ruler take it on himself to put to
 death a Great officer."  The fifth was,-- "Follow no crooked policy in
 making embankments. Impose no restrictions on the sale of grain. Let there
 be no promotions without first announcing them to the sovereign." It was
 then said, "All we who have united in this agreement shall hereafter
 maintain amicable relations." The princes of the present day all violate
 these five prohibitions, and therefore I say that the princes of the
 present day are sinners against the five chiefs.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'The crime of him who connives at, and aids, the wickedness of his
 prince is small, but the crime of him who anticipates and excites that
 wickedness is great. The officers of the present day all go to meet their
 sovereigns' wickedness, and therefore I say that the Great officers of the
 present day are sinners against the princes.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The prince of Lû wanted to make the minister Shan commander of
 his army.</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius said, 'To employ an uninstructed people in war may be said to
 be destroying the people. A destroyer of the people would not have been
 tolerated in the times of Yâo and Shun.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Though by a single battle you should subdue Ch'î, and get
 possession of Nan-yang, the thing ought not to be done.'</p>
 
 <p>4. Shan changed countenance, and said in displeasure, 'This is what I,
 Kû-Lî, do not understand.'</p>
 
 <p>5. Mencius said, 'I will lay the case plainly before you. The territory
 appropriated to the sovereign is 1,000 lî square. Without a thousand
 lî, he would not have sufficient for his entertainment of the
 princes. The territory appropriated to a Hâu is 100 lî square.
 Without 100 lî, he would not have sufficient wherewith to observe the
 statutes kept in his ancestral temple.</p>
 
 <p>6. 'When Châu-kung was invested with the principalily of Lû,
 it was a hundred lî square. The territory was indeed enough, but it
 was not more than 100 lî. When T'âi-kung was invested with the
 principality of Ch'î, it was 100 lî square. The territory was
 indeed enough, but it was not more than 100 lî.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'Now Lû is five times 100 lî square. If a true royal
 ruler were to arise, whether do you think that Lû would be diminished
 or increased by him?</p>
 
 <p>8. 'If it were merely taking the place from the one State to give it to
 the other, a benevolent man would not do it;-- how much less will he do so,
 when the end is to be sought by the slaughter of men!</p>
 
 <p>9. 'The way in which a superior man serves his prince contemplates
 simply the leading him in the right path, and directing his mind to
 benevolence.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Those who now-a-days serve their sovereigns say, "We
 can for our sovereign enlarge the limits of the cultivated ground, and fill
 his treasuries and arsenals." Such persons are now-a-days called "Good
 ministers," but anciently they were called "Robbers of the people." If a
 sovereign follows not the right way, nor has his mind bent on benevolence,
 to seek to enrich him is to enrich a Chieh.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Or they will say, "We can for our sovereign form alliances with
 other States, so that our battles must be successful." Such persons are
 now-a-days called "Good ministers," but anciently they were called "Robbers
 of the people." If a sovereign follows not the right way, nor has his mind
 directed to benevolence, to seek to enrich him is to enrich a Chieh.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Although a prince, pursuing the path of the present day, and not
 changing its practices, were to have the throne given to him, he could not
 retain it for a single morning.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Pâi Kwei said, 'I want to take a twentieth of the produce only
 as the tax. What do you think of it?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius said, 'Your way would be that of the Mo.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'In a country of ten thousand families, would it do to have only one
 potter?' Kwei replied, 'No. The vessels would not be enough to use.'</p>
 
 <p>4. Mencius went on, 'In Mo all the five kinds of grain are not grown; it
 only produces the millet. There are no fortified cities, no edifices, no
 ancestral temples, no ceremonies of sacrifice; there are no princes
 requiring presents and entertainments; there is no system of officers with
 their various subordinates. On these accounts a tax of one-twentieth of the
 produce is sufficient there.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'But now it is the Middle Kingdom that we live in. To banish the
 relationships of men, and have no superior men;-- how can such a state of
 things be thought of?</p>
 
 <p>6. 'With but few potters a kingdom cannot subsist;-- how much less can
 it subsist without men of a higher rank than others?</p>
 
 <p>7. 'If we wish to make the taxation lighter than the system of Yâo
 and Shun, we shall just have a great Mo and a small Mo. If we wish to make
 it heavier, we shall just have the great Chieh and the small Chieh.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Pâi Kwei said, 'My management of the waters is superior to that
 of Yü.'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'You are wrong, Sir. Yü's regulation of the
 waters was according to the laws of water.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'He therefore made the four seas their receptacle, while you make the
 neighbouring States their receptacle.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'Water flowing out of its channels is called an inundation.
 Inundating waters are a vast waste of water, and what a benevolent man
 detests. You are wrong, my good Sir.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Mencius said, 'If a scholar have not faith, how shall he take a
 firm hold of things?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. The prince of Lû wanting to commit the administration of his
 government to the disciple Yo-chang, Mencius said, 'When I heard of it, I
 was so glad that I could not sleep.'</p>
 
 <p>2. Kung-sun Ch'âu asked, 'Is Yo-chang a man of vigour?' and was
 answered, 'No.' 'Is he wise in council?' 'No.' 'Is he possessed of much
 information?' 'No.'</p>
 
 <p>3. 'What then made you so glad that you could not sleep?'</p>
 
 <p>4. 'He is a man who loves what is good.'</p>
 
 <p>5. 'Is the love of what is good sufficient?'</p>
 
 <p>6. 'The love of what is good is more than a sufficient qualification for
 the government of the kingdom;-- how much more is it so for the State of
 Lû!</p>
 
 <p>7. 'If a minister love what is good, all within the four seas will count
 1000 lî but a small distance, and will come and lay their good thoughts
 before him.</p>
 
 <p>8. If he do not love what is good, men will say, "How self-conceited he
 looks? He is sayinq to himself, I know it." The language and looks of that
 self-conceit will keep men off at a distance of 1,000 lî. When good
 men stop 1,000 lî off, calumniators, flatterers, and sycophants will
 make their appearance. When a minister lives among calumniators,
 flatterers, and sycophants, though he may wish the State to be well
 governed, is it possible for it to be so?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>2. 'If received with the utmost respect and all polite observances, and
 they could say to themselves that the prince would carry their words into
 practice, then they took office with him. Afterwards, although there might
 be no remission in the polite demeanour of the prince, if their words were
 not carried into practice, they would leave him.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'The second case was that in which, though the prince could not be
 expected at once to carry their words into practice, yet being received by
 him with the utmost respect, they took office with him. But afterwards, if
 there was a remission in his polite demeanour, they would leave him.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'The last case was that of the superior man who had nothing to eat,
 either morning or evening, and was so famished that he could not move out
 of his door. If the prince, on hearing of his state, said, "I must fail in
 the great point,-- that of carrying his doctrines into practice, neither am
 I able to follow his words, but I am ashamed to allow him to die of want in
 my country;" the assistance offered in such a case might be received, but
 not beyond what was sufficient to avert death.'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Mencius said, 'Shun rose from among the channelled fields. Fû
 Yüeh was called to office from the midst of his building frames;
 Chiâo-ko from his fish and salt; Kwan Î-wû from the hands
 of his gaoler; Sun-shû Âo from his hiding by the sea-shore; and
 Pâi-lî Hsî from the market-place.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Thus, when Heaven is about to confer a great office on any man, it
 first exercises his mind with suffering, and his sinews and bones with
 toil. It exposes his body to hunger, and subjects him to extreme poverty.
 It confounds his undertakings. By all these methods it stimulates his mind,
 hardens his nature, and supplies his incompetencies.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'Men for the most part err, and are afterwards able to reform. They
 are distressed in mind and perplexed in their thoughts, and then they arise
 to vigorous reformation. When things have been evidenced in men's looks,
 and set forth in their words, then they understand them.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'If a prince have not about his court families attached to the laws
 and worthy counsellors, and if abroad there are not hostile States or other
 external calamities, his kingdom will generally come to ruin.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'From these things we see how life springs from sorrow and calamity,
 and death from ease and pleasure.'</p>
