 <center><h1>Mencius Chapter 18</h1></center>
 
 
 <p>1. Wan Chang said, 'Was it the case that Yâo gave the throne to
 Shun?' Mencius said, 'No. The sovereign cannot give the throne to
 another.'</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Yes;-- but Shun had the throne. Who gave it to him?' 'Heaven gave it
 to him,' was the answer.</p>
 
 <p>3. '" Heaven gave it to him:"-- did Heaven confer its appointment on him
 with specific injunctions?'</p>
 
 <p>4. Mencius replied, 'No. Heaven does not speak. It simply showed its will
 by his personal conduct and his conduct of affairs.'</p>
 
 <p>5. '"It showed its will by his personal conduct and his conduct of
 affairs:"-- how was this?' Mencius's answer was, 'The sovereign can present
 a man to Heaven, but he cannot make Heaven give that man the throne. A
 prince can present a man to the sovereign, but he cannot cause the
 sovereign to make that man a prince. A great officer can present a man to
 his prince, but he cannot cause the prince to make that man a great
 officer. Yâo presented Shun to Heaven, and Heaven accepted him. He
 presented him to the people, and the people accepted him. Therefore I say,
 "Heaven does not speak. It simply indicated its will by his personal
 conduct and his conduct of affairs."'</p>
 
 <p>6. Chang said, 'I presume to ask how it was that Yâo presented
 Shun to Heaven, and Heaven accepted him; and that he exhibited him to the
 people, and the people accepted him.' Mencius replied, 'He caused him to
 preside over the sacrifices, and all the spirits were well pleased with
 them;-- thus Heaven accepted him. He caused him to preside over the conduct
 of affairs, and affairs were well administered, so that the people reposed
 under him;-- thus the people accepted him. Heaven gave the throne to him.
 The people gave it to him. Therefore I said, "The sovereign cannot give the
 throne to another."</p>
 
 <p>7. 'Shun assisted Yâo in the government for twenty and eight
 years;-- this was more than man could have done, and was from Heaven. After
 the death of Yâo, when the three years' mourning was completed, Shun
 withdrew from the son of Yâo to the south of South river. The princes
 of the kingdom, however, repairing to court, went not to the son of
 Yâo, but they went to Shun. Litigants went not to the son of
 Yâo, but they went to Shun. Singers sang not the son of Yâo,
 but they sang Shun. Therefore I said, "Heaven gave him the throne." It was
 after these things that he went to the Middle Kingdom, and occupied the
 seat of the Son of Heaven. If he had, before these things, taken up his
 residence in the palace of Yâo, and had applied pressure to the son
 of Yâo, it would have been an act of usurpation, and not the gift of
 Heaven.</p>
 
 <p>8. 'This sentiment is expressed in the words of The Great Declaration,--
 "Heaven sees according as my people see; Heaven hears according as my people
 hear."'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'People say, "When the disposal of
 the kingdom came to Yü, his virtue was inferior to that of Yâo
 and Shun, and he transmitted it not to the worthiest but to his son." Was
 it so?' Mencius replied, 'No; it was not so. When Heaven gave the kingdom
 to the worthiest, it was given to the worthiest. When Heaven gave it to the
 son of the preceding sovereign, it was given to him. Shun presented Yü
 to Heaven. Seventeen years elapsed, and Shun died. When the three years'
 mourning was expired, Yü withdrew from the son of Shun to Yang-ch'ang.
 The people of the kingdom followed him just as after the death of
 Yâo, instead of following his son, they had followed Shun. Yü
 presented Yî to Heaven. Seven years elapsed, and Yü died. When
 the three years' mourning was expired, Yî withdrew from the son of
 Yü to the north of mount Ch'î. The princes, repairing to court,
 went not to Yî, but they went to Ch'î. Litigants did not go to
 Yî, but they went to Ch'î, saying, "He is the son of our
 sovereign;" the singers did not sing Yî, but they sang Ch'î,
 saying, "He is the son of our sovereign."</p>
 
 <p>2. 'That Tan-chû was not equal to his father, and Shun's son not
 equal to his; that Shun assisted Yâo, and Yü assisted Shun, for
 many years, conferring benefits on the people for a long time; that thus
 the length of time during which Shun, Yü, and Yî assisted in the
 government was so different; that Ch'î was able, as a man of talents
 and virtue, reverently to pursue the same course as Yü; that Yî
 assisted Yü only for a few years, and had not long conferred benefits
 on the people; that the periods of service of the three were so different;
 and that the sons were one superior, and the other superior:-- all this was
 from Heaven, and what could not be brought about by man. That which is done
 without man's doing is from Heaven. That which happens without man's
 causing is from the ordinance of Heaven.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'In the case of a private individual obtaining the throne, there must
 be in him virtue equal to that of Shun or Yü; and moreover there must
 be the presenting of him to Heaven by the preceding sovereign. It was on
 this account that Confucius did not obtain the throne.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'When the kingdom is possessed by natural succession, the sovereign
 who is displaced by Heaven must be like Chieh or Châu. It was on this
 account that Yî, Î Yin, and Châu-kung did not obtain the
 throne.</p>
 
 <p>5. 'Î Yin assisted T'ang so that he became sovereign over the
 kingdom. After the demise of T'ang, T'âi-ting having died before he
 could be appointed sovereign, Wâ'i-ping reigned two years, and
 Chung-zin four. T'âi-chiâ was then turning upside down the
 statutes of T'ang, when Î Yin placed him in T'ung for three years.
 There T'âi-chiâ repented of his errors, was contrite, and
 reformed himself. In T'ung be came to dwell in benevolence and walk in
 righteousness, during those threee years, listening to the lessons given to
 him by Î Yin.  Then Î Yin again returned with him to Po.</p>
 
 <p>6. 'Châu-kung not getting the throne was like the case of Yî
 and the throne of Hsiâ, or like that of Î Yin and the throne of
 Yin.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'Confucius said, "T'ang and Yü resigned the throne to their
 worthy ministers. The sovereign of Hsiâ and those of Yin and
 Châu transmitted it to their sons. The principle of righteousness was
 the same in all the cases."'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'People say that Î Yin
 sought an introduction to T'ang by his knowledge of cookery. Was it
 so?'</p>
 
 <p>2. Mencius replied, 'No, it was not so. Î Yin was a farmer in the
 lands of the prince of Hsin, delighting in the principles of Yâo and
 Shun. In any matter contrary to the righteousness which they prescribed, or
 contrary to their principles, though he had been offered the throne, he
 would not have regarded it; though there had been yoked for him a thousand
 teams of horses, he would not have looked at them. In any matter contrary
 to the righteousness which they prescribed, or contrary to their
 principles, he would neither have given nor taken a single straw.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'T'ang sent persons with presents of silk to entreat him to enter his
 service. With an air of indifference and self-satisfaction he said, "What
 can I do with those silks with which T'ang invites me? Is it not best for
 me to abide in the channelled fields, and so delight myself with the
 principles of Yâo and Shun?"</p>
 
 <p>4. 'T'ang thrice sent messengers to invite him. After this, with the
 change of resolution displayed in his countenance, he spoke in a different
 style,-- "Instead of abiding in the channelled fields and thereby
 delighting myself with the principles of Yâo and Shun, had I not
 better make this prince a prince like Yâo or Shun, and this people
 like the people of Yâo or Shun ? Had I not better in my own person
 see these things for myself?</p>
 
 <p>5. '"Heaven's plan in the production of mankind is this:-- that they who
 are first informed should instruct those who are later in being informed,
 and they who first apprehend principles should instruct those who are
 slower to do so. I am one of Heaven's people who have first apprehended;--
 I will take these principles and instruct this people in them. If I do not
 instruct them, who will do so?"</p>
 
 <p>6. 'He thought that among all the people of the kingdom, even the
 private men and women, if there were any who did not enjoy such benefits as
 Yâo and Shun conferred, it was as if he himself pushed them into a
 ditch. He took upon himself the heavy charge of the kingdom in this way,
 and therefore he went to T'ang, and pressed upon him the subject of
 attacking Hsiâ and saving the people.</p>
 
 <p>7. 'I have not heard of one who bent himself, and at the same time made
 others straight;-- how much less could one disgrace himself, and thereby
 rectify the whole kingdom? The actions of the sages have been different.
 Some have kept remote from court, and some have drawn near to it; some have
 left their offices, and some have not done so:-- that to which those
 different courses all agree is simply the keeping of their persons
 pure.</p>
 
 <p>8. 'I have heard that Î Yin sought an introduction to T'ang by the
 doctrines of Yâo and Shun. I have not heard that he did so by his
 knowledge of cookery.</p>
 
 <p>9. 'In the "Instructions of Î," it is said, "Heaven destroying
 Chieh commenced attacking him in the palace of Mû. I commenced in
 Po."'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'Some say that Confucius, when he
 was in Wei, lived with the ulcer-doctor, and when he was in Ch'î,
 with the attendant, Ch'î Hwan;-- was it so?' Mencius replied, 'No; it
 was not so. Those are the inventions of men fond of strange things.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'When he was in Wei, he lived with Yen Ch'âu-yû. The
 wives of the officer Mî and Tsze-lû were sisters, and Mî
 told Tsze-lû, "If Confucius will lodge with me, he may attain to the
 dignity of a high noble of Wei." Tsze-lû informed Confucius of this,
 and he said, "That is as ordered by Heaven." Confucius went into office
 according to propriety, and retired from it according to righteousness. In
 regard to his obtaining office or not obtaining it, he said, "That is as
 ordered." But if he had lodged with the attendant Chî Hwan, that
 would neither have been according to righteousness, nor any ordering of
 Heaven.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'When Confucius, being dissatisfied in Lû and Wei, had left those
 States, he met with the attempt of Hwan, the Master of the Horse, of Sung,
 to intercept and kill him. He assumed, however, the dress of a common man,
 and passed by Sung. At that time, though he was in circumstances of
 distress, he lodged with the city-master Ch'ang, who was then a minister of
 Châu, the marquis of Ch'an.</p>
 
 <p>4. 'I have heard that the characters of ministers about court may be
 discerned from those whom they entertain, and those of stranger officers,
 from those with whom they lodge. If Confucius had lodged with the
 ulcer-doctor, and with the attendant Chî Hwan, how could he have been
 Confucius?'</p>
 
 
 
 <p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, 'Some say that Pâi-lî Hsî
 sold himself to a cattle-keeper of Ch'in for the skins of five rams, and
 fed his oxen, in order to find an introduction to the duke Mû of
 Ch'in;-- was this the case?' Mencius said, 'No; it was not so. This story
 was invented by men fond of strange things.</p>
 
 <p>2. 'Pâi-lî Hsî was a man of Yü. The people of
 Tsin, by the inducement of a round piece of jade from
 Ch'ûi-chî, and four horses of the Ch'ü breed, borrowed a
 passage through Yü to attack Kwo. On that occasion, Kung
 Chih-ch'î remonstrated against granting their request, and
 Pâi-lî Hsî did not remonstrate.</p>
 
 <p>3. 'When he knew that the duke of Yü was not to be remonstrated
 with, and, leaving that State, went to Ch'in, he had reached the age of
 seventy. If by that time he did not know that it would be a mean thing to
 seek an introduction to the duke Mû of Ch'in by feeding oxen, could
 he be called wise? But not remonstrating where it was of no use to
 remonstrate, could he be said not to be wise? Knowing that the duke of
 Yü would be ruined, and leaving him before that event, he cannot be
 said not to have been wise. Being then advanced in Ch'in, he knew that the
 duke Mû was one with whom he would enjoy a field for action, and
 became minister to him;-- could he, acting thus, be said not to be wise?
 Having become chief minister of Ch'in, he made his prince distinguished
 throughout the kingdom, and worthy of being handed down to future ages;--
 could he have done this, if he had not been a man of talents and virtue? As
 to selling himself in order to accomplish all the aims of his prince, even
 a villager who had a regard for himself would not do such a thing; and
 shall we say that a man of talents and virtue did it?'</p>
