 <h2>Question XVIII</h2>
 <h3>The Method of passing Sentence upon one who hath Confessed to Heresy but is Relapsed, Albeir now Penitent</h3></center>
 
 
         
 THE ninth method of arriving at a conclusive sentence in a 
 process on behalf of the faith is used when the person accused of 
 heresy, after a careful investigation of the circumstances of the 
 process in consultation with men of good judgement, is found to 
 have confessed her heresy and to be penitent, but that she has 
 truly relapsed. And this is when the accused herself confesses in 
 Court before the Bishop or Judges that she has at another time 
 abjured all heresy, and this is legally proved, and that she has 
 afterwards fallen into such a heresy or error: or that she has 
 abjured some particular heresy, such as that of witches, and has 
 afterwards returned to it; but that following better advice she 
 is penitent, and believes the Catholic faith, and returns to the 
 unity of the Church. Such a one is not, if she humbly ask for 
 them, to be denied the sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist; 
 but however much she may repent, she is nevertheless to be 
 delivered up as a backslider to the secular Court to suffer the 
 extreme penalty. But it must be understood that this refers to 
 one who had made her abjuration as one manifestly taken in 
 heresy, or as one strongly suspected of heresy, and not to one 
 who has so done as being under only a light suspicion.<br> 
 
         
 The following procedure must be observed in this case. When, 
 after mature and careful and, if necessary, repeated 
 investigation by learned men, it has been concluded that the said 
 prisoner has actually and prepense relapsed into heresy, the 
 Bishop or Judge shall send to the said prisoner in the place of 
 detention two or three honest men, especially religious or 
 clerics, who are zealous for the faith, of whom the prisoner has 
 no suspicion, but rather places confidence in them; and they 
 shall go in to her at a suitable time and speak to her sweetly of 
 the contempt of this world and the miseries of this life, and of 
 the joys and glory of Paradise. And leading up from this, they 
 shall indicate to her on the part of the Bishop or Judge that she 
 cannot escape temporal death, and that she should therefore take 
 care for the safety of her soul, and prepare herself to confess 
 her sins and receive the Sacrament of the Eucharist. And they 
 shall visit her often, persuading her to penitence and patience, 
 strengthening her as much as they can in the Catholic truth, and 
 they shall diligently cause her to confess, so that she may 
 receive the Sacrament of the Eucharist at her humble petition. 
 For these Sacraments are not to be denied to such offenders.<br> 
 
         
 And when she has received these Sacraments, and been well 
 disposed by these men to salvation; after two or three days 
 during which they have strengthened her in the Catholic faith and 
 induced her to repentance, the Bishop or Judge of that place 
 shall notify the bailiff of the place or the authorities of the 
 secular Court, that on such a day at such an hour (not a Feast 
 Day) he should be with his attendants in such a square or place 
 (but it must be outside a church) to receive from their Court a 
 certain backslider whom the Bishop and Judge will hand over to 
 him.<br> 
 
         
 And on the morning of the day fixed, or on the day before, it 
 shall be publicly proclaimed throughout the city of place in 
 those towns and villages where such proclamations are customary, 
 that on such a day at such an hour in such a place there will be 
 a sermon preached in defence of the Faith, and that the Bishop 
 and other Judges will condemn a certain person who has relapsed 
 into the sin of heresy, delivering her up to secular justice.<br> 
 
         
 But here it must be considered that, if he who has so relapsed 
 should have been ordained in any Holy Orders, or should be a 
 priest or a religious of any Order, before he is handed over he 
 is to be degraded and stripped of the privileges of his 
 ecclesiastic order. And so, when he has been degraded from all 
 ecclesiastical office, let him be handed over to secular justice 
 to receive his due punishment.<br> 
 
         
 When, therefore, such a one is to be degraded from his orders and 
 handed over to the secular Court, let the Bishop summon together 
 all the prelates and religious men of his Diocese. For in this 
 case, though not in others, only the Bishop together with the 
 other prelates and religious and learned men of his diocese can 
 degrade one who has received Holy Orders when he is to be 
 delivered to the secular Court, or is to be imprisoned for life 
 for the sin of heresy.<br> 
 
         
 On the day appointed for the degrading of the backslider and the 
 handing of him over to the secular Court, if he be a cleric, or, 
 if he be a layman, for leaving him to hear his definitive 
 sentence, the people shall gather together in some square or open 
 place outside the church, and the Inquisitor shall preach a 
 sermon, and the prisoner shall be set on a high place in the 
 presence of the secular authorities. And if the prisoner be a 
 cleric who is to be degraded, the Bishop shall don his Pontifical 
 robes, together with the other prelates of his Diocese in their 
 vestments and copes, and the prisoner shall be clothed and robed 
 as if he were to minister his office; and the Bishop shall 
 degrade him from his order, beginning from the higher and 
 proceeding to the lowest. And just as in conferring Holy Orders 
 the Bishop uses the words ordained by the Church, so in degrading 
 him he shall take off his chasuble and stole, and so with the 
 other vestments, using words of a directly opposite meaning.<br> 
 
         
 When this degradation has been accomplished, the proceedings must 
 continue in the legal and accustomed manner, and the Notary or 
 religious or clerk shall be bidden to read the sentence, which 
 shall be after the following manner, whether the prisoner be a 
 layman or a degraded cleric:<br> 
 
         
 We, N., by the mercy of the God Bishop of such city, and Judge in 
 the territories of such Prince, seeing that we are legitimately 
 informed that you, N., of such a place in such a Diocese, have 
 been before us (or before such Bishop and Judges) accused of such 
 heresy or heresies (naming them), of which you were lawfully 
 convicted by your own confession and by witnesses, and that you 
 had obstinately persisted in them for so long, but afterwards, 
 listening to better advice, publicly in such a place abjured, 
 renounced and revoked those heresies in the form provided by the 
 Church, on which account the said Bishop and Inquisitor, 
 believing that you had truly returned to the bosom of the Holy 
 Church of God, did absolve you from the sentence of 
 excommunication by which you were bound, enjoining upon you a 
 salutary penance if with true heart and faith unfeigned you had 
 returned to the unity of the Holy Church; but whereas after all 
 the aforesaid and the lapse of so many years you are again 
 accused before us and have again fallen into such heresies which 
 you had abjured (naming them), and though it was sore grief to us 
 to hear such things of you, yet we were by justice compelled to 
 investigate the matter, to examine the witnesses, and to summon 
 and question you on oath, proceeding in each and every way as we 
 are bidden by the canonical institutions.<br> 
 
         
 And since we wished to conclude this case without any doubt, we 
 convened in solemn council learned men of the Theological faculty 
 and men skilled in the Canon and the Civil Law, and in 
 consultation with them maturely and carefully examined all and 
 singular which had been done, said and seen in the process and 
 diligently discussed each circumstance, weighing all equally in 
 the balance as it behoved us; and we find both by the legitimate 
 evidence of witnesses and by your own confession received in 
 Court that you have fallen into the heresies which you had 
 abjured. For we find that you have said or done such and such 
 (let all be named), on account of which, with the concurrence of 
 the said learned men, we have judged and now judge that you are a 
 backslider, according tot he canonical institutions, to which we 
 refer in grief and grieve to refer.<br> 
 
         
 But since it has come to the knowledge of Us and of many honest 
 Catholic men that, by the inspiration of Divine grade, you have 
 once more returned to the bosom of the Church and to the truth of 
 the faith detesting the aforesaid errors and heresies and with 
 true orthodoxy unfeigned believing and protesting the Catholic 
 faith, we have admitted you to receive the Church's Sacraments of 
 Penance and the Holy Eucharist at your humble request. But since 
 the Church of God has no more which it can do in respect of you, 
 seeing that it has acted so mercifully towards you in the manner 
 we have said, and you have abused that mercy by falling back into 
 the heresies which you had abjured: therefore We the said Bishop 
 and Judges, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, having before 
 us the Holy Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from the 
 countenance of God and our eyes see with equity, and having 
 before our eyes only God and the irrefragable truth of the Holy 
 Faith and the extirpation of the plague of heresy; against you, 
 N., in this place on the day and at the hour before assigned to 
 you for the hearing of your definitive sentence, we pronounce in 
 sentence that you have truly fallen back into the sin of heresy, 
 although you are penitent; and as one truly so relapsed we cast 
 you forth from this our ecclesiastical Court, and leave you to be 
 delivered to the secular arm. But we earnestly pray that the said 
 secular Court may temper its justice with mercy, and that there 
 be no bloodshed or danger of death.<br> 
 
         
 And here the Bishop and his assessors shall withdraw, and the 
 secular Court shall perform its office.<br> 
 
         
 It is to be noted that, although the Bishop and Inquisitor ought 
 to use their utmost diligence, both by their own efforts and 
 those of others, to induce the prisoner to repent and return to 
 the Catholic faith; yet, after he has repented and it has been 
 decided in council that, though he is penitent, he is 
 nevertheless truly a backslider and as such to be handed over in 
 person to the secular Court, they ought not to inform him of such 
 sentence and punishment. therefore from that time, neither before 
 nor after the sentence should they present themselves before him, 
 that he be not moved in his spirit against them, a thing which is 
 very carefully to be avoided in death of this sort. But, as we 
 have said, let them send to him some honest men, especially those 
 in religious orders, or clerics, in whom he has confidence; and 
 let them inform him of the sentence to come and of his death, and 
 strengthen him in the faith, exhorting him to have patience; and 
 let them visit him after the sentence, and console him and pray 
 with him, and not leave him until he has rendered his spirit to 
 his Creator.<br> 
 
         
 Let them, therefore, beware and be on their guard not to do or 
 say anything which may enable the prisoner to anticipate his 
 death, or place themselves in an irregular position. And, as they 
 have burdened themselves with the care of his soul, let them then 
 share also in his punishment and guilt.<br> 
 
         
 It must also be remarked that such a sentence which delivers up a 
 person to the secular Court ought not to be pronounced on a 
 Festival or Solemn Day, nor in a church, but outside in some open 
 space. For it is a sentence which leads to death; and it is more 
 decent that it should be delivered on an ordinary day and outside 
 the church; for a Feast Day and the church are dedicated to 
 God.
