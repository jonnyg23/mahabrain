 <h2>Question XXXI</h2>
 <h3>Of One Taken and Convicted, but Denying Everything</h3></center>
 
 
         
 THE twelfth method of finishing and concluding a process on 
 behalf of the faith is used when the person accused of heresy, 
 after a diligent examination of the merits of the process in 
 consultation with skilled lawyers, is found to be convicted of 
 heresy by the evidence of the facts or by the legitimate 
 production of witnesses, but not by his own confession. That is 
 to say, he may be convicted by the evidence of the facts, in that 
 he has publicly practiced heresy; or by the evidence of witnesses 
 against whom he can take no legitimate exception; yet, though so 
 taken and convicted, he firmly and constantly denies the charge. 
 See Henry of Segusio <i>On Heresy</i>, question 34.<br> 
 
         
 The procedure in such a case is as follows. The accused must be 
 kept in strong durance fettered and chained, and must often be 
 visited by the officers, both in a body and severally, who will 
 use their own best endeavours and those of others to induce him 
 to discover the truth; telling him that if he refuses and 
 persists in his denial, he will in the end be abandoned to the 
 secular law, and will not be able to escape temporal death.<br> 
 
         
 But if he continues for a long time in his denials, the Bishop 
 and his officers, now in a body and now severally, now personally 
 and now with the assistance of other honest and upright men, 
 shall summon before them now one witness, now another, and warm 
 him to attend strictly to what he has deposed, and to be sure 
 whether or not he has told the truth; that he should beware lest 
 in damning another temporally he damn himself eternally; that if 
 he be afraid, let him at least tell them the truth in secret, 
 that the accused should not die unjustly. And let them be careful 
 to talk to him in such a way that they may see clearly whether or 
 not his depositions have been true.<br> 
 
         
 But if the witnesses, after this warning, adhere to their 
 statements, and the accused maintains his denials, let not the 
 Bishop and his officers on that account be in any haste to 
 pronounce a definitive sentence and hand the prisoners over to 
 secular law; but let them detain him still longer, now persuading 
 him to confess, now yet again urging the witnesses (but one at a 
 time) to examine their consciences as well. And let the Bishop 
 and his officers pay particular attention to that witness who 
 seems to be of the best conscience and the most disposed to good, 
 and let them more insistently charge him on his conscience to 
 speak the truth whether or not the matter was as he had deposed. 
 And if they see any witness vacillate, or there are any other 
 indications that he has given false evidence, let them attest him 
 according to the counsel of learned men, and proceed as justice 
 shall require.<br> 
 
         
 For it is very often found that after a person so convicted by 
 credible witnesses has long persisted in his denials, he has at 
 length relented, especially on being truly informed that he will 
 not be delivered to the secular Court, but be admitted to mercy 
 if he confesses his sin, and he has then freely confessed the 
 truth which he had so long denied. And it is often found that the 
 witnesses, actuated by malice and overcome by enmity, have 
 conspired together to accuse an innocent person of the sin of 
 heresy; but afterwards, at the frequent entreaty of the Bishop 
 and his officers, their consciences have been stricken with 
 remorse and, by Divine inspiration, they have revoked their 
 evidence and confessed that they have out of malice put that 
 crime upon the accused. Therefore the prisoner in such a case is 
 not to be sentenced hastily, but must be kept for a year or more 
 before he is delivered up to the secular Court.<br> 
 
         
 When a sufficient time has elapsed, and after all possible care 
 has been taken, if the accused who has been thus legally 
 convicted has acknowledged his guilt and confessed in legal from 
 that he hath been for the period stated ensnared in the crime of 
 heresy, and has consented to abjure that and every heresy, and to 
 perform such satisfaction as shall seem proper to the Bishop and 
 Inquisitor for one convicted of heresy both by his own confession 
 and the legitimate production of witnesses; then let him as a 
 penitent heretic publicly abjure all heresy, in the manner which 
 we have set down in the eighth method of concluding a process on 
 behalf of the faith.<br> 
 
         
 But if he has confessed that he hath fallen into such heresy, but 
 nevertheless obstinately adheres to it, he must be delivered to 
 the secular Court as an impenitent, after the manner of the tenth 
 method which we have explained above.<br> 
 
         
 But if the accused has remained firm and unmoved in his denial of 
 the charges against him, but the witnesses have withdrawn their 
 charges, revoking their evidence and acknowledging their guilt, 
 confessing that they had put so great a crime upon an innocent 
 man from motives of rancour and hatred, or had been suborned or 
 bribed thereto; then the accused shall be freely discharged, but 
 they shall be punished as false witnesses, accusers or informers. 
 This made clear by Paul of Burgos in his comment on the Canon c. 
 <i>multorum</i>. And sentence or penance shall be pronounced 
 against them as shall seem proper to the Bishop and Judges; but 
 in any case such false witnesses must be condemned to perpetual 
 imprisonment on a diet of bread and water, and to do penance for 
 all the days of their life, being made to stand upon the steps 
 before the church door, etc. However, the Bishops have power to 
 mitigate or even to increase the sentence after a year or some 
 other period, in the usual manner.<br> 
 
         
 But if the accused, after a year or other longer period which has 
 been deemed sufficient, continues to maintain his denials, and 
 the legitimate witnesses abide by their evidence, the Bishop and 
 Judges shall prepare to abandon him to the secular Court; sending 
 to him certain honest men zealous for the faith, especially 
 religious, to tell him that he cannot escape temporal death while 
 he thus persists in his denial, but will be delivered up as an 
 impenitent heretic to the power of the secular Court. And the 
 Bishop and his officers shall give notice to the Bailiff or 
 authority of the secular Court that on such a day at such an hour 
 and in such a place (not inside a church) he should come with his 
 attendants to receive an impenitent heretic whom they will 
 deliver to him. And let him make public proclamation in the usual 
 places that all should be present on such a day at such an hour 
 and place to hear a sermon preached on behalf of the faith, and 
 that the Bishop and his officer will hand over a certain 
 obstinate heretic to the secular Court.<br> 
 
         
 On the appointed day for the pronouncement of sentence the Bishop 
 and his officer shall be in the place aforesaid, and the prisoner 
 shall be placed on high before the assembled clergy and people so 
 that he may be seen by all, and the secular authorities shall be 
 present before the prisoner. Then sentence shall be pronounced in 
 the following manner:<br> 
 
         
 We, N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such city, or Judge in the 
 territories of such Prince, seeing that you, N., of such a place 
 in such a Diocese, have been accused before us of such heresy 
 (naming it); and wishing to be more certainly informed whether 
 the charges made against you were true, and whether you walked in 
 darkness or in the light; we proceeded to inform ourselves by 
 diligently examining the witnesses, by often summoning and 
 questioning you on oath, and admitting an Advocate to plead in 
 your defence, and by proceeding in every way as we were bound by 
 the canonical decrees.<br> 
 
         
 And wishing to conclude your trial in a manner beyond all doubt, 
 we convened in solemn council men learned in the Theological 
 faculty and in the Canon and Civil Laws. And having diligently 
 examined and discussed each circumstance of the process and 
 maturely and carefully considered with the said learned men 
 everything which has been said and done in this present case, we 
 find that you, N., have been legally convicted of having been 
 infected with the sin of heresy for so long a time, and that you 
 have said an done such and such (naming them) on account of which 
 it manifestly appears that you are legitimately convicted of the 
 said heresy.<br> 
 
         
 But since we desired, and still desire, that you should confess 
 the truth and renounce the said heresy, and be led back to the 
 bosom of Holy Church and to the unity of the Holy Faith, that so 
 you should save your soul and escape the destruction of both your 
 body and soul in hell; we have by our own efforts and those of 
 others, and by delaying your sentence for a long time, tried to 
 induce you to repent; but you being obstinately given over to 
 wickedness have scorned to agree to our wholesome advice, and 
 have persisted and do persist with stubborn and defiant mind in 
 your contumacious and dogged denials; and this we say with grief, 
 and grieve and mourn in saying it. But since the Church of God 
 has waited so long for you to repent and acknowledge your guilt, 
 and you have refused and still refuse, her grace and mercy can go 
 no farther.<br> 
 
         
 Wherefore that you may be an example to others and that they may 
 be kept from all such heresies, and that such crimes may not 
 remain unpunished: We the Bishop and Judges named on behalf of 
 the faith, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, and having 
 before us the Holy Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from 
 the countenance of God and our eyes see with equity, and having 
 before our eyes only God and the glory and honour of the Holy 
 Faith, we judge, declare and pronounce sentence that you standing 
 here in our presence on this day at the hour and place appointed 
 for the hearing of your final sentence, are an impenitent 
 heretic, and as such to be delivered or abandoned to secular 
 justice; and as an obstinate and impenitent heretic we have by 
 this sentence cast you off from the ecclesiastical Court and 
 deliver and abandon you to secular justice and the power of the 
 secular Court. And we pray that the said secular Court may 
 moderate its sentence of death upon you. this sentence was given, 
 etc.<br> 
 
         
 The Bishop and Judges may, moreover, arrange that just men 
 zealous for the faith, known to and in the confidence of the 
 secular Court, shall have access to the prisoner while the 
 secular Court is performing its office, in order to console him 
 and even yet induce him to confess the truth, acknowledge his 
 guilt, and renounce his errors.<br> 
 
         
 But if it should happen that after the sentence, and when the 
 prisoner is already at the place where he is to be burned, he 
 should say that he wishes to confess the truth and acknowledge 
 his guilt, and does so; and if he should be willing to abjure 
 that and every heresy; although it may be presumed that he does 
 this rather from fear of death than for love of the truth, yet I 
 should be of the opinion that he may in mercy be received as a 
 penitent heretic and be imprisoned for life. See the gloss on the 
 chapters <i>ad abolendam</i> and <i>excommunicamus</i>. 
 Nevertheless, according to the rigour of the law, the Judges 
 ought not to place much faith in a conversion of this sort; and 
 furthermore, they can always punish him on account of the 
 temporal injuries which he has committed.
