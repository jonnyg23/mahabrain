 <h2>Question XXXII</h2>
 <h3>Of One who is Convicted but who hath Fled or who Contumaciously Absents himself</h3></center>
 
 
         
 THE Thirteenth and last method of arriving at a definite sentence 
 in a process on behalf of the Faith is used when the person 
 accused of heresy, after a diligent discussion of the merits of 
 the process in consultation with learned lawyers, is found to be 
 convicted of heresy, but has made his escape, or defiantly 
 absents himself after the expiration of a set time. And this 
 happens in three cases.<br> 
 
         
 First, when the accused is convicted of heresy by his own 
 confession, or by the evidence of the facts, or by the legitimate 
 production of witnesses, but has fled, or has absented himself 
 and refused to appear after being legally summoned.<br> 
 
         
 Secondly, when a person has been accused and certain information 
 has been laid against him on account of which he rests under some 
 suspicion, even if it be only a light one, and he has been 
 summoned to answer for his faith; and because he has defiantly 
 refused to appear, he is excommunicated, and has stubbornly 
 remained in that excommunication for a year, and always defiantly 
 absents himself.<br> 
 
         
 The third case is when someone directly obstructs the Bishop's or 
 Judge's sentence or process on behalf of the Faith, or lends his 
 help, advice or protection for that purpose, and such a person 
 has been stricken with the sword of excommunication. And if he 
 was obstinately endured that excommunication for a year, he is 
 then to be condemned as a heretic who has defied the 
 administration of justice.<br> 
 
         
 In the first case, such a person is, according to the Canon <i>ad 
 abolendam</i>, to be condemned as an impenitent heretic. In the 
 second and third cases he is not to be judged as an impenitent 
 heretic, but to be condemned as if he were a penitent heretic. 
 And in any of these cases the following procedure should be 
 observed. When such a person has been awaited for sufficient 
 time, let him be summoned by the Bishop and his officer in the 
 Cathedral Church of that Diocese in which he has sinned, and in 
 the other churches of that place where he had his dwelling, and 
 especially from where he has fled; and let him be summoned in the 
 following manner:<br> 
 
         
 We, N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such Diocese, having in our 
 charge the welfare of souls, and having above all the desires of 
 our heart this most earnest desire that in our time in the said 
 Diocese the Church should flourish and that there should be a 
 fruitful and abundant harvest in that vineyard of the Lord of 
 Hosts, which the right hand of the Most High Father has planted 
 in the bosom of the righteous, which the Son of that Father has 
 plentifully watered with His own life-giving Blood, which the 
 reviving Spirit the Paraclete has made fruitful within by His 
 wonderful and ineffable gifts, which the whole incomprehensible 
 and ineffable Blessed Trinity has endowed and enriched with many 
 very great and holy privileges; but the wild boar out of the 
 forest, by which is meant any sort of heretic, has devoured and 
 despoiled it, laying waste the fair fruit of the faith and 
 planting thorny briars among the vines; and that tortuous 
 serpent, the evil enemy of our human race, who is Satan and the 
 devil, has breathed out venom and poisoned the fruit of the 
 vineyard with the plague of heresy: And this is the field of the 
 Lord, the Catholic Church, to till and cultivate which the only 
 first-born Son of God the Father descended from the heights of 
 Heaven, and sowed it with miracles and Holy discourse, going 
 through towns and villages and teaching not without great labour; 
 and He chose as His Apostles honest labouring men, and showed 
 them the way, endowing them with eternal rewards; and the Son of 
 God Himself expects to gather from that field on the Day of the 
 Last Judgement a plentiful harvest, and by the hands of His Holy 
 Angels to store it in His Holy barn in Heaven: But the foxes of 
 Samson, two-faced like them who 
 have fallen into the sin of heresy, having their faces looking 
 both ways but tied together by their burning tails, run about 
 with many torches amidst the fields of the Lord now white unto 
 harvest and shining with the splendour of the faith, and bitterly 
 despoil them, speeding most cunningly here and there, and with 
 their strong attacks burning, dissipating, and decastation, and 
 subtly and damnably subverting the truth of the Holy Catholic 
 Faith.<br> 
 
         
 Wherefore, since you, N., are fallen into the damned heresies of 
 witches, practising them publicly in such place (naming it), and 
 have been by legitimate witnesses convicted of the sin of heresy, 
 or by your own confession received by us in Court; and after your 
 capture you have escaped, refusing the medicine of your 
 salvation: therefore we have summoned you to answer for the said 
 crimes in person before us, but you, led away and seduced by a 
 wicked spirit, have refused to appear.<p> 
 
 </p><center>
 Or as follows:
 </center><p>
 
         
 Wherefore, since you, N., have been accused before us of the sin 
 of heresy, and from information received against you we have 
 judged that you are under a light suspicion of that sin, we have 
 summoned you to appear personally before us to answer for the 
 Catholic faith. And since, having been summoned, you have 
 defiantly refused to appear, we excommunicated you and caused you 
 to be proclaimed excommunicate. And in this state you have 
 remained stubborn for a year, or so many years, hiding here and 
 there, so that even now we do not know whither the evil spirit 
 has led you; and though we have awaited you kindly and 
 mercifully, that you might return to the bosom and the unity of 
 the Holy Faith, you being wholly given up to evil have scorned to 
 do so. Yet we wish and are bound to justice to conclude this case 
 beyond any question, now can we pass over with connivent eyes 
 your iniquitous crimes.<br> 
 
         
 We the Bishop and Judges in the said cause on behalf of the faith 
 require and strictly command by this our present public edict 
 that you the aforesaid, at present in hiding and runaway and 
 fugitive, shall on such a day of such a month in such a year, in 
 such Cathedral Church of such Diocese, at the hour of Terce 
 appear personally before us to hear your final sentence: 
 signifying that, whether you appear or not, we shall proceed to 
 our definitive sentence against you as law and justice shall 
 require. And that our summons may come to your knowledge 
 beforehand and you may not be able to protect yourself with a 
 plea of ignorance, we wish and command that our said present 
 letters, requisition and summons be publically affixed to the 
 doors of the said Cathedral Church. In witness of all which we 
 have ordered these our present letters to be authorized by the 
 impressions of our seals. Given, etc.<br> 
 
         
 On the appointed day assigned for the hearing of the final 
 sentence, if the fugitive shall have appeared and consented to 
 abjure publicly all heresy, humbly praying to be admitted to 
 mercy, he is to be admitted if he has not been a backslider; and 
 if he was convicted by his own confession or by the legitimate 
 production of witnesses, he shall abjure and repent as a penitent 
 heretic, according to the manner explained in the eighth method 
 of concluding a process on behalf of the faith. If he was gravely 
 suspected, and refused to appear when he was summoned to answer 
 for his faith, and was therefore excommunicated and had endured 
 that excommunication obstinately for a year, but becomes 
 penitent, let him be admitted, and abjure all heresy, in the 
 manner explained in the sixth method of pronouncing sentence. But 
 if he shall appear, and not consent to abjure, let him be 
 delivered as a truly impenitent heretic to the secular Court, as 
 was explained in the tenth method. But if he still defiantly 
 refuses to appear, let the sentence be pronounced in the 
 following manner:<br> 
 
         
 We, N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such city, seeing that you, 
 N., of such a place in such a Diocese were accused before us by 
 public report and the information of worthy men of the sin of 
 heresy: We, whose duty it is, proceeded to examine and inquire 
 whether there was any truth in the report which had come to our 
 ears. And finding that you were convicted of heresy by the 
 depositions of many credible witnesses, we commanded that you be 
 brought before us in custody. (Here let it be said whether he had 
 appeared and been questioned under oath or not.) But afterwards, 
 led away and seduced by the advice of the evil spirit, and 
 fearing to have your wounds wholesomely healed with wine and oil, 
 you fled away (or, if it was the case, You broke from your prison 
 and place of detention and fled away), hiding here and there, and 
 we are altogether ignorant of whither the said evil spirit has 
 led you.</p><p> 
 
 </p><center>
 Or after this manner:
 </center><p>
 
         
 And finding that against you, accused as aforesaid before us of 
 the sin of heresy, there were many indications by reason of which 
 we judged you to be lightly suspected of the said heresy, we 
 summoned you by public edict in such and such churches of such 
 Diocese within a certain time assigned to appear in person before 
 to answer to the said charges against you and otherwise on matter 
 concerning the Faith. But you, following some mad advice, 
 obstinately refused to appear. And when, as in justice bound, we 
 excommunicated you and caused you to be publicly proclaimed 
 excommunicate, you stubbornly remained in that excommunication 
 for more than a year, and kept hidden here and there, so that we 
 do not know whither the evil spirit has led you.<br> 
 
         
 And where the Holy Church of God has long awaited you up to this 
 present day in kindness and mercy, that you might fly to the 
 bosom of her mercy, renouncing your errors and professing the 
 Catholic Faith, and be nourished by the bounty of her mercy; but 
 you have refused to consent, persisting in your obstinacy; and 
 since we wished and still wish, as we ought to do and as justice 
 compels us, to bring your case to an equitable conclusion, we 
 have summoned you to appear in person before us on this day at 
 this hour and place, to hear your final sentence. And since you 
 have stubbornly refused to appear, you are manifestly proved to 
 abide permanently in your errors and heresies; and this we say 
 with grief, and grieve in saying it.<br> 
 
         
 But since we cannot and will not delay to do justice, nor may we 
 tolerate so great disobedience and defiance of the Church of God; 
 for the exaltation of the Catholic Faith and the extirpation of 
 vile heresy, at the call of justice, and by reason of your 
 disobedience and obstinacy, on this day and at this hour and 
 place heretofore strictly and precisely assigned to you for the 
 hearing of your final sentence, having diligently and carefully 
 discussed each several circumstance of the process with learned 
 men in the Theological faculty and in the Canon and Civil Laws, 
 sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, having before us the Holy 
 Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from the countenance of 
 God and our eyes see with equity, and having before our eyes only 
 God and the irrefragable truth of the Holy Faith, and following 
 in the footsteps of the Blessed Apostle Paul, in these writings 
 we pronounce final sentence against you, N., absent or present, 
 as follows, invoking the Name of Christ.<br> 
 
         
 We the Bishop and Judges named on behalf of the Faith, whereas 
 the process of this cause on behalf of the Faith has in all 
 things been conducted as the laws require; and whereas you, 
 having been legally summoned, have not appeared, and have not by 
 yourself or any other person excused yourself; and whereas you 
 have for a long time persisted and still obstinately persist in 
 the said heresies, and have endured excommunication in the cause 
 of the Faith for so many years, and still stubbornly endure it; 
 and whereas the Holy Church of God can do no more for you, since 
 you have persisted and intend to persist in your excommunication 
 and said heresies: Therefore, following in the footsteps of the 
 Blessed Apostle Paul, we declare, judge and sentence you, absent 
 or present, to be a stubborn heretic, and as such to be abandoned 
 to secular justice. And by this our definitive sentence we drive 
 you from the ecclesiastical Court, and abandon you to the power 
 of the secular Court; earnestly praying the said Court that, if 
 ever it should have you in its power, it will moderate its 
 sentence of death against you. This sentence was give, etc.<br> 
 
         
 Here it is to be considered that, if that stubborn fugitive had 
 been convicted of heresy, either by his own confession or by 
 credible witnesses, and had fled before his abjuration, he is by 
 the sentence to be judged an impenitent heretic, and so it must 
 be expressed in the sentence. But if, on the other hand, he had 
 not been convicted, but had been summoned as one under suspicion 
 to answer for his faith; and, because he has refused to appear, 
 has been excommunicated, and has obstinately endured that 
 excommunication for more than a year, and has finally refused to 
 appear; then he is not to be judged a heretic, but as a heretic, 
 and must be condemned as such; and so it must be expressed in the 
 sentence,as it is said above.
