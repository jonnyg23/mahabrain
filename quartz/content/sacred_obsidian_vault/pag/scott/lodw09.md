 <p>     FOR many years the Scottish nation had been remarkable    for a credulous belief in witchcraft, and repeated examples were supplied by    the annals of sanguinary executions on this sad accusation. Our acquaintance    with the slender foundation on which Boetius and Buchanan reared the early part    of their histories may greatly incline us to doubt whether a king named Duffus    ever reigned in Scotland, and, still more, whether he died by the agency of    a gang of witches, who inflicted torments upon an image made in his name, for    the sake of compassing his death. In the tale of Macbeth, which is another early    instance of Demonology in Scottish history, the weird-sisters, who were the    original prophetesses,  appeared to the usurper in a dream, and are described    as <i>volæ</i>, or sibyls, rather than as witches, though Shakspeare a    stamped the latter character indelibly upon them. 
 </p><p>      One of the earliest real cases of importance    founded upon witchcraft was, like those of the Duchess of Gloucester and others    in the sister country, mingled with an accusation of political nature, which,    rather than the sorcery, brought the culprits to their fate. The Earl of Mar,    brother of James III. of Scotland, fell under the king's suspicion for consulting    wit witches and sorcerers how to shorten the king's days. On such a charge,    very inexplicitly stated, the unhappy Mar was bled to death in his own lodgings    without either trial or conviction; immediately after which catastrophe twelve    women of obscure rank and three or four wizards, or warlocks, as they were termed,    were burnt at Edinburgh, to give a colour to the Earl's guilt. 
 </p><p>      In the year 1537 a noble matron fell a victim    to a similar charge. This was Janet Douglas, Lady Glammis, who, with her son,    her second husband, and several others, stood accused of attempting James's    life by poison, with a view to the restoration of the Douglas family, of which    Lady Glammis's brother, the Earl of Angus, was the bead. She died much pitied    by the people, who seem to have thought the articles against her forged for    the purpose of taking her life, her kindred and very name being so obnoxious    to the King. 
 </p><p>      Previous to this lady's execution there would    appear to have been but few prosecuted to death on the score of witchcraft,    although the want of the justiciary records of that period leaves us in uncertainty.    But in the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries, when    such charges grew general over Europe, cases of the kind occurred very often    in Scotland, and, as we have already noticed, were sometimes of a peculiar character.    There is, indeed, a certain monotony in most tales of the kind. The vassals    are usually induced to sell themselves at a small price to the  Author of Ill, who, having commonly to do with    women, drives a very hard bargain. On the contrary, when he was pleased to enact    the female on a similar occasion, he brought his gallant, one William Barton,    a fortune of no less than fifteen pounds, which, even supposing it to have been    the Scottish denomination. of coin, was a very liberal endowment compared with    his niggardly conduct towards the fair sex on such an occasion. Neither did    he pass false coin on this occasion, but, on the contrary, generously gave Burton    a merk, to keep the fifteen pounds whole. In observing on Satan's conduct in    this matter, Master George Sinclair observes that it is fortunate the Enemy    is but seldom permitted to bribe so high (as £15 Scots); for were this    the case, he might find few men or women capable of resisting his munificence.    I look upon this as one of the most severe reflections on our forefathers' poverty    which is extant. 
 </p><p>      In many of the Scottish witches' trials, as    to the description of Satan's Domdaniel, and the Sabbath which he there celebrates,    the northern superstition agrees with that of England. But some of the confessions    depart from the monotony of repetition, and add some more fanciful circumstances    than occur in the general case. Isobel Gowdie's confession, already mentioned,    is extremely minute, and some part of it at least may be quoted, as there are    other passages not very edifying. The witches of Auldearne, according to this    penitent, were so numerous, that they were told off into squads, or <i>covines</i>,    as they were termed, to each of which were appointed two officers. One of these    was called the Maiden of the Covine, and was usually, like Tam o'Shanter's Nannie,    a girl of personal attractions, whom Satan placed beside himself, and treated    with particular attention, which greatly provoked the spite of the old bags,    who felt themselves insulted by the preference. <a name="fr_64"></a><a href="#fn_64"><font size="1">65</font></a> When assembled,    they dug up graves, and possessed themselves of the carcases  (of unchristened infants in particular), whose    joints and members they used in their magic unguents and salves. When they desired    to secure for their own use the crop of some neighbour, they made a pretence    of ploughing it with a yoke of paddocks. These foul creatures drew the plough,    which was held by the devil himself. The plough-harness and soams were of quicken    grass, the sock and coulter were made out of a riglen's horn, and the covine    attended on the operation, praying the devil to transfer to them the fruit of    the ground so traversed, and leave the proprietors nothing but thistles and    briars. The witches' sports, with their elfin archery, I have already noticed    (page 136). They entered the house of the Earl of Murray himself, and such other    mansions as were not fenced against them by vigil and prayer, and feasted on    the provisions they found there. 
 </p><p>      As these witches were the countrywomen of the    weird sisters in Macbeth, the reader may be desirous to bear some of their spells,    and of the poetry by which they were accompanied and enforced. They used to    bash the flesh of an unchristened child, mixed with that of dogs and sheep,    and place it in the house of those whom they devoted to destruction in body    or goods, saying or singing --  <br> <br> "We put this intill this hame, <br> In our lord the Devil's name; <br> The first hands that handle thee, <br> Burn'd and scalded may they be! <br> We will destroy houses and hald, <br> With the sheep and nolt into the fauld; <br> And little sall come to the fore, <br> Of all the rest of the little store!" <br> 
 </p><p>     Metamorphoses were, according to Isobel, very    common among them, and the forms of crows, cats, hares, and other  animals, were on such occasions assumed. In the    hare shape Isobel herself had a bad adventure. She had been sent by the devil    to Auldearne in that favourite disguise, with some message to her neighbours,    but had the misfortune to meet Peter Papley of Killhill's servants going to    labour, having his hounds with them. The hounds sprung on the disguised witch,    " and I," says Isobel, " run a very long time, but being hard pressed, was forced    to take to my own house, the door being open, and there took refuge behind a    chest." But the hounds came in and took the other side of the chest, so that    Isobel only escaped by getting into another house, and gaining time to say the    disenchanting rhyme: --  <br> <br> "Hare, hare, God send thee care ! <br> I am in a hare's likeness now; <br> But I shall be a woman even now -- <br> Hare, hare, God send thee care!" <br> 
 </p><p>      Such accidents, she said, were not uncommon,    and the witches were sometimes bitten by the dogs, of which the marks remained    after their restoration to human shape. But none had been killed on such occasions. 
 </p><p>     The ceremonial of the Sabbath meetings was very    strict. The Foul Fiend was very rigid in exacting the most ceremonious attention    from his votaries, and the title of Lord when addressed by them. Sometimes,    however, the weird sisters, when whispering amongst themselves, irreverently    spoke of their sovereign by the name of Black John; upon such occasions the    Fiend rushed on them like a schoolmaster who surprises his pupils in delict,    and beat and buffeted them without mercy or discretion, saying, " I ken weel    eneugh what you are saying of me." Then might be seen the various tempers of    those whom he commanded. Alexander Elder, in Earlseat, often fell under his    lord's displeasure for neglect of duty, and, being weak and simple, could never    defend himself save with tears, cries, and entreaties for mercy; but some of    the women, according to  Isobel Gowdie's confession, had more of the spirit    which animated the old dame of Kellyburn Braes. Margaret Wilson, in Auldearne,    would " defend herself finely," and make her hands save her head, after the    old Scottish manner. Bessie Wilson could also speak very crustily with her tongue,    and " belled the cat" with the devil stoutly. The others chiefly took refuge    in crying "Pity ! mercy !" and such like, while Satan kept beating them with    wool cards and other sharp scourges, without attending to their entreaties or    complaints. There were attendant devils and imps, who served the witches. They    were usually distinguished by their liveries, which were sad-dun, grass-green,    sea-green, and yellow. The witches were taught to call these imps by names,    some of which might belong to humanity, while others had a diabolical sound.    These were Robert the Jakis, Saunders the Red Reaver, Thomas the Feary, Swein,    an old Scandinavian Duerg probably; the Roaring Lion, Thief of Hell, Wait-upon-Herself,    MacKeeler, Robert the Rule, Hendrie Craig, and Rorie. These names, odd and uncouth    enough, are better imagined at least than those which Hopkins contrived for    the imps which he discovered -- such as Pyewacket, Peck-in-the-Crown, Sack-and-Sugar,    News, Vinegar-Tom, and Grizell Greedigut, the broad vulgarity of which epithets    shows what a flat imagination he brought to support his impudent fictions. 
 </p><p>      The devil, who commanded the fair sisterhood,    being fond of mimicking the forms of the Christian church, used to rebaptize    the witches with their blood, and in his own great name. The proud-stomached    Margaret Wilson, who scorned to take a blow unrepaid, even from Satan himself,    was called Pickle-nearest-the-Wind; her compeer, Bessie Wilson, was Throw-the-Cornyard;    Elspet Nishe's was Bessie Bald; Bessie Hay's nickname was Able-and-Stout; and    Jane Mairten, the Maiden of the Covine, was called Ower-the-Dike-with-it. 
 </p><p>      Isobel took upon herself, and imputed to her    sisters, as  already mentioned, the death of sundry persons    shot with elf-arrows, because they had omitted to bless themselves as the aerial    flight of the hags swept past them. <a name="fr_65"></a><a href="#fn_65"><font size="1">66</font></a> She had herself the temerity    to shoot at the Laird of Park as he was riding through a ford, but missed him    through the influence of the running stream, perhaps, for which she thanks God    in her confession; and adds, that at the time she received a great cuff from    Bessie Hay for her awkwardness. They devoted the male children of this gentleman    (of the well-known family of Gordon of Park, I presume) to wasting illness,    by the following lines, placing at the same time in the fire figures composed    of clay mixed with paste, to represent the object: --  <br> <br> " We put this water amongst this meal, <br> For long dwining  <a name="fr_66"></a><a href="#fn_66"><font size="1">67</font></a>  and ill heal; <br> We put it in into the fire, <br> To burn them up stook and stour <a name="fr_67"></a><a href="#fn_67"><font size="1">68</font></a>. <br> That they be burned with our will, <br> Like any stikkle  <a name="fr_68"></a><a href="#fn_68"><font size="1">69</font></a> in a kiln." <br> 
 </p><p>     Such was the singular confession of Isobel Gowdie,    made voluntarily, it would seem, and without compulsion of any kind, judicially    authenticated by the subscription of the notary, clergymen, and gentlemen present;    adhered to after their separate diets, as they are called, of examination, and    containing no variety or contradiction in its details. Whatever might be her    state of mind in other respects, she seems to have been perfectly conscious    of the perilous consequence of her disclosures to her own person. " I do not    deserve," says she, " to be seated here at ease and unharmed, but rather to    be stretched on an iron rack: nor can my crimes be atoned for, were I to be    drawn asunder by wild horses." 
 </p><p>      It only remains to suppose that this wretched    creature was under the dominion of some peculiar species of lunacy,  to, which a full perusal of her confession might,    perhaps guide a medical person of judgement and experience. Her case is interesting,    as throwing upon the rites and ceremonies of the Scottish witches a light which    we seek in vain elsewhere. 
 </p><p>      Other unfortunate persons were betrayed to their    own reproof by other means than the derangement of mind which seems to, have    operated on Isobel Gowdie. Some, as we have seen, endeavoured to escape from    the charge of witchcraft by admitting an intercourse with the fairy people;    an excuse which was never admitted as relevant. Others were subjected to cruel    tortures, by which our ancestors thought the guilty might be brought to confession,    but which far more frequently compelled the innocent to bear evidence against    themselves. On this subject the celebrated Sir George Mackenzie, " that noble    wit of Scotland," as he is termed by Dryden, has some most judicious reflections    which we shall endeavour to abstract as the result of the experience of one    who, in his capacity of Lord Advocate, had often occasion to conduct witch-trials,    and who, not doubting the existence of the crime, was of opinion that, on account    of its very horror, it required the clearest and most strict probation. 
 </p><p>      He first insists on the great improbability    of the fiend, without riches to bestow, and avowedly subjected to a higher power,    being able to enlist such numbers of recruits, and the little advantage which    he himself would gain by doing so. But, 2dly, says Mackenzie, " the persons    ordinarily accused of this crime are poor ignorant men, or else women, who understand    not the nature of what they are accused of; and many mistake their own fears    and apprehensions for witchcraft, of which I shall give two instances. One,    of a poor weaver who, after he had confessed witchcraft, being asked how he    saw the devil, made answer, ' Like flies dancing about the candle.' Another,    of a woman, who asked seriously, when she was accused, if  a woman might be a witch and not know it? And    it is dangerous that persons, of all others the most simple, should be tried    for a crime of all others the most mysterious. 3rdly, These poor creatures,    when they are defamed, become so confounded with fear and the close prison in    which they are kept, and so starved for want of meat and drink, either of which    wants is enough to disarm the strongest reason, that hardly wiser and more serious    people than they would escape distraction; and when men are confounded with    fear and apprehension, they will imagine things the most ridiculous and absurd    " of which instances are given. 4thly, " Most of these poor creatures are tortured    by their keepers, who, being persuaded they do God good service, think it their    duty to vex and torment poor prisoners delivered up to them as rebels to heaven    and enemies to men; and I know" (continues Sir George), " <i>ex certissima scientia</i>,    that most of all that ever were. taken were tormented in this manner, and this    usage was the ground of all their confession; and albeit the poor miscreants    cannot prove this usage, the actors being the only witnesses, yet the judge    should be jealous of it, as that which did at first elicit the confession, and    for fear of which they dare not retract it." 5thly, This learned author gives    us an instance how these unfortunate creatures might be reduced to confession    by the very infamy which the accusation cast upon them, and which was sure to    follow, condemning them for life to a state of necessity, misery, and suspicion,    such as any person of reputation would willingly exchange for a short death,    however painful. 
 </p><p>      " I went when I was a justice-deput to examine    some women who had confessed judicially, and one of them, who, was a silly creature,    told me under secresie, that she had not confest because she was guilty, but    being a poor creature who wrought for her meat, and being defamed for a witch,    she knew she would starve, for no person thereafter would either give her meat    or lodging, and that all men would  beat her and hound dogs at her, and that therefore    she desired to be out of the world; whereupon she wept most bitterly, and upon    her knees called God to witness to what she said. Another told me that she was    afraid the devil would challenge a right to her, after she was said to be his    servant, and would haunt her, as the minister said, when he was desiring her    to confess, and therefore she desired to die. And really ministers are oft times    indiscreet in their zeal to have poor creatures to confess in this; and I recommend    to judges that the wisest ministers should be sent to them, and those who are    sent should be cautious in this particular." <a name="fr_69"></a><a href="#fn_69"><font size="1">70</font></a> 
 </p><p>      As a corollary to this affecting story, I may    quote the case of a woman in Lauder jail, who lay there with other females on    a charge of witchcraft. Her companions in prison were adjudged to die, and she    too had, by a confession as full as theirs, given herself up as guilty. She    therefore sent for the minister of the town, and entreated to be put to death    with the others who bad been appointed to suffer upon the next Monday. The clergyman,    however, as well as others, had adopted a strong persuasion that this confession    was made up in the pride of her heart, for the destruction of her own life,    and had no foundation in truth. We give the result in the minister's words:    --  
 </p><p>      " Therefore much pains was taken on her by ministers    and others on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday morning, that she might resile from    that confession which was suspected to be but a temptation of the devil, to    destroy both her soul and body; yea, it was charged home upon her by the ministers,    that there was just ground of jealousy that her confession was not sincere,    and she was charged before the Lord to declare the truth, and not to take her    blood upon her own head. Yet she stiffly adhered to what she had said, and cried    always to be put away with the rest. Whereupon, on Monday morning, being called    before the judges,  and confessing before them what she had said,    she was found guilty and condemned to die with the rest that same clay. Being    carried forth to the place of execution, she remained silent during the first,    second, and third prayer, and then perceiving that there remained no more but    to rise and go to the stake, she lifted tip her body, and with a loud voice    cried out, 'Now all you that see me this day, know that I am now to die as a    witch by my own confession, and I free all men especially the ministers and    magistrates, of the guilt of my blood. I take it wholly upon myself -- my blood    be upon my own head; and as I must make answer to the God of Heaven presently,    I declare I am as free of witchcraft as any child; but being delated by a malicious    woman, and put in prison under the name of a witch, disowned by my husband and    friends, and seeing no ground of hope of my coming out of prison, or ever coming    in credit again, through the temptation of the devil I made up that confession    on purpose to destroy my own life, being weary of it, and choosing rather to    die than live;'-and so died. Which lamentable story, as it did then astonish    all the spectators, none of which could restrain themselves from tears ; so    it may be to all a demonstration of Satan's subtlety, whose design is stilt    to destroy all, partly by tempting many to presumption, and some others to despair.    These things to be of truth, are attested by an eye and ear witness who is yet    alive, a faithful minister of the gospel." <a name="fr_70"></a><a href="#fn_70"><font size="1">71</font></a> It is strange the    inference does not seem to have been deduced, that as one woman out of very    despair renounced her own life, the same might have been the case in many other    instances, wherein the confessions of the accused constituted the principal    if not sole evidence of the guilt. 
 </p><p>      One celebrated mode of detecting witches and    torturing them at the same time, to draw forth confession, was by running pins    into their body, on pretence of discovering the  devil's stigma, or mark, which was said to be    inflicted by him upon all his vassals, and to be insensible to pain. This species    of search, the practice of the infamous Hopkins, was in Scotland reduced to    a trade; and the young witchfinder was allowed to torture the accused party,    as if in exercise of a lawful calling, although Sir George Mackenzie stigmatises    it as a horrid imposture. I observe in the Collections of Mr. Pitcairn, that    at the trial of Janet Peaston of Dalkeith the magistrates and ministers of that    market town caused John Kincaid of Tranent, the common pricker, to exercise    his craft upon her, " who found two marks of what he called the devil's making,    and which appeared indeed to be so, for she could not feel the pin when it was    put into either of the said marks, nor did they (the marks) bleed when they    were taken out again; and when she was asked where she thought the pins were    put in, she pointed to a part of her body distant from the real place. They    were pins of three inches in length." 
 </p><p>      Besides the fact that the persons of old people    especially sometimes contain spots void of sensibility, there is also room to    believe that the professed prickers used a pin the point or lower part of which    was, on being pressed down, sheathed in the upper, which was hollow for the    purpose, and that which appeared to enter the body did not pierce it at all.    But, were it worth while to dwell on a subject so ridiculous, we might recollect    that in so terrible an agony of shame as is likely to convulse a human being    under such a trial, and such personal insults, the blood is apt to return to    the heart, and a slight wound, as with a pin, may be inflicted without being    followed by blood. In the latter end of the seventeenth century this childish,    indecent, and brutal practice began to be called by its right name. Fountainhall    has recorded that in 1678 the Privy Council received the complaint of a poor    woman who had been abused by a country magistrate and one of those impostors    called prickers. They expressed high displeasure against the presumption of  the parties complained against, and treated the    pricker as a common cheat. <a name="fr_71"></a><a href="#fn_71"><font size="1">72</font></a> 
 </p><p>      From this and other instances it appears that    the predominance of the superstition of witchcraft, and the proneness to persecute    those accused of such practices in Scotland, were increased by the too great    readiness of subordinate judges to interfere in matters which were, in fact,    beyond their jurisdiction. The Supreme Court of Justiciary was that in which    the cause properly and exclusively ought to have been tried. But, in practice,    each inferior judge in the country, the pettiest bailie in the most trifling.    burgh, the smallest and most ignorant baron of a rude territory, took it on    him to arrest, imprison, and examine, in which examinations, as we have already    seen, the accused suffered the grossest injustice. The copies of these examinations,    made up of extorted confessions, or the evidence of inhabile witnesses, were    all that were transmitted to the Privy Council, who were to direct the future    mode of procedure. Thus no creature was secure against the malice or folly of    some defamatory accusation, if there was a timid or superstitious judge, though    of the meanest denomination, to be found within the district. 
 </p><p>      But, secondly, it was the course of the Privy    Council to appoint commissions of the gentlemen of the country, and particularly    of the clergymen, though not likely, from their education, to be freed from    general prejudice, and peculiarly liable to be affected by the clamour of the    neighbourhood againt the delinquent. Now, as it is well known that such a commission    could not be granted in a case of murder in the county where the crime was charged,    there seems no good reason why the trial of witches, so liable to excite the    passions, should not have been uniformly tried by a court whose rank and condition    secured them from the suspicion of partiality. But our ancestors arranged it    otherwise, and it was the consequence that such commissioners  very seldom, by acquitting the persons brought    before them, lost an opportunity of destroying a witch. 
 </p><p>      Neither must it be forgotten that the proof    led in support of the prosecution was of a kind very unusual in jurisprudence.    The lawyers admitted as evidence what they called <i>damnumm minatum</i>,<i>    et malum secutum</i> -- mischief, that is to say, following close upon a threat,    or wish of revenge, uttered by the supposed witch, which, though it might be    attributed to the most natural course of events, was supposed necessarily to    be in consequence of the menaces of the accused. 
 </p><p>      Sometimes this vague species of evidence loosely    adduced, and allegations of danger threatened and mischief ensuing were admitted,    though the menaces had not come from the accused party herself. On Ith June,    1661, as John Stewart, one of a party of stout burghers of Dalkeith appointed    to guard an old woman called Christian Wilson from that town to Niddrie, was    cleaning his gun, he was slyly questioned by Janet Cocke, another confessing    witch, who probably saw his courage was not entirely constant, " What would    you think if the devil raise a whirlwind, and take her from you on the road    to-morrow ?" Sure enough, on their journey to Niddrie the party actually were    assailed by a sudden gust of wind (not a very uncommon event in that climate),    which scarce permitted the valiant guard to keep their feet, while the miserable    prisoner was blown into a pool of water, and with difficulty raised again. There    is some ground to hope that this extraordinary evidence was not admitted upon    the trial. 
 </p><p>      There is a story told of an old wizard, whose    real name was Alexander Hunter, though he was more generally known by the nickname    of Hatteraick, which it had pleased the devil to confer upon him. The man had    for some time adopted the credit of being a conjurer, and curing the diseases    of man and beast by spells and charms. One summer's day, on a green hill-side,    the devil appeared to  him in shape of a grave " Mediciner," addressing    him thus roundly, " Sandie, you have too long followed my trade without acknowledging    me for a master. You must now enlist with me and become my servant, and I will    teach you your trade better." Hatteraick consented to the proposal, and we shall    let the Rev. Mr. George Sinclair tell the rest of e tale. 
 </p><p>      "After this he grew very famous through the    country for is charming and curing of diseases in men and beasts, and turned    a vagrant fellow like a jockie, <a name="fr_72"></a><a href="#fn_72"><font size="1">73</font></a> gaining meal, and flesh, and    money by his charms, such was the ignorance of any at that time. Whatever house    he came to none durst refuse Hatteraick an alms, rather for his ill than his    good. One day he came to the yait (gate) of Samuelston, when some friends after    dinner were going to horse. A young gentleman, brother to the lady, seeing him,    switcht him about the ears, saying -- ' You warlock carle, what have you to    do here ?' Whereupon the fellow goes away grumbling, and was overheard to say,    ' You shall dear buy this ere it be long.' This was <i>damnum minatum</i>. The    young gentleman conveyed his friends a far way off, and came home that way again,    where he supped. After supper, taking his horse and crossing Tyne water to go    home, he rides through a shady piece of a haugh, commonly called Allers, and    the evening being somewhat dark, he met with some persons there that begat a    dreadful consternation in him, which for the most part he would never reveal.    This was <i>malum secutum</i>. When he came home the servants observed terror    and fear in his countenance. The next day he became distracted, and was bound    for several days. His sister, the Lady Samuelston, hearing of it, was heard    say, ' Surely that knave Hatteraick is the cause of his trouble; call for him    in all haste.' When he had come to her, ' Sandie,' says she, ' what is this    you have done to my brother William ?' ' I told him,' says he, '  
 </p><p>     I should make  him repent of his striking me at the yait lately.'    She, giving the rogue fair words, and promising him his pockful of meal with    beef and cheese, persuaded the fellow to cure him again He undertook the business.    ' But I must first,' says he ' have one of his sarks' (shirts), which was soon    gotten. What pranks he played with it cannot be known, but within a short while    the gentleman recovered his health. When Hatteraic came to receive his wages    he told the lady, ' Your brother William shall quickly go off the country, but    shall never return.' She, knowing the fellow's prophecies to hold true, caused    the brother to make a disposition to her of all his patrimony, to the defrauding    of his younger brother, George. After that this warlock had abused the country    for a long time, he was at last apprehended at Dunbar, and brought into Edinburgh,    and burnt upon the Castle-hill." <a name="fr_73"></a><a href="#fn_73"><font size="1">74</font></a> 
 </p><p>      Now, if Hatteraick was really put to death on    such evidence, it is worth while to consider what was its real amount. A hot-tempered    swaggering young gentleman horsewhips a beggar of ill fame for loitering about    the gate of his sister's house. The beggar grumbles, as any man would. The young    man, riding in the night, and probably in liquor, through a dark shady place,    is frightened by, he would not, and probably could not, tell what, and has a    fever fit. His sister employs the wizard to take off the spell according to    his profession; and here is <i>damnum minatum</i>, <i>et malum secutum</i>,    and all legal cause for burning a man to ashes ! The vagrant Hatteraick probably    knew something of the wild young man which might soon oblige him to leave the    country; and the selfish Lady Samuelston, learning the probability of his departure,    committed a fraud which ought to have rendered her evidence inadmissible. Besides    these particular disadvantages, to which the parties accused of this crime in    Scotland were necessarily exposed, both in relation to the judicature by which    they  were tried and the evidence upon which they were    convicted, their situation was rendered intolerable by the detestation in which    they were held by all ranks. The gentry hated them because the diseases and    death of their relations and children were often imputed to them; the grossly    superstitious vulgar abhorred them with still more perfect dread and loathing.    And amongst those natural feelings, others of a less pardonable description    found means to shelter themselves. In one case, we are informed by Mackenzie,    a poor girl was to die for witchcraft, of whom the real crime was that she had    attracted too great a share, in the lady's opinion, of the attention of the    laird. 
 </p><p>      Having thus given some reasons why the prosecutions    for witchcraft in Scotland were so numerous and fatal, we return to the general    history of the trials recorded from the reign of James V. to the union of the    kingdoms. Through the reign of Queen Mary these trials for sorcery became numerous,    and the crime was subjected to heavier punishment by the 73rd Act of her 9th    Parliament. But when James VI. approached to years of discretion, the extreme    anxiety which he displayed to penetrate more deeply into mysteries which others    had regarded as a very millstone of obscurity, drew still larger attention to    the subject. The sovereign had exhausted his talents of investigation on the    subject of witchcraft, and credit was given to all who acted in defence of the    opinions of the reigning prince. This natural tendency to comply with the opinions    of the sovereign was much augmented by the disposition of the Kirk to the same    sentiments. We have already said that these venerable persons entertained, with    good faith, the general erroneous belief respecting witchcraft -- regarding    it indeed as a crime which affected their own order more nearly than others    in the state, since, especially called to the service of heaven, they were peculiarly    bound to oppose the incursions of Satan. The works which remain behind them    show, among better things, an unhesitating belief in what were called by them  " special providences;" and this was equalled,    at least, by their credulity as to the actual interference of evil spirits in    the affairs of this world. They applied these principles of belief to the meanest    causes. A horse falling lame was a snare of the devil to keep the good clergyman    from preaching; the arrival of a skilful farrier was accounted a special providence    to defeat the purpose of Satan. This was doubtless, in a general sense true,    since nothing can happen without the foreknowledge and will of Heaven; but we    are authorized to believe that the period of supernatural interference has long    passed away, and that the great Creator is content to execute his purposes by    the operation of those laws which influence the general course of nature. Our    ancient Scottish divines thought otherwise. Surrounded, as they conceived themselves,    by the snares and temptations of hell, and relying on the aid of Heaven, they    entered into war with the kingdom of Satan, as the crusaders of old invaded    the land of Palestine, with the same confidence in the justice of their cause    and similar indifference concerning the feelings of those whom they accounted    the enemies of God and man. We have already seen that even the conviction that    a woman was innocent of the crime of witchcraft did not induce a worthy clergyman    to use any effort to withdraw her from the stake; and in the same collection <a name="fr_74"></a><a href="#fn_74"><font size="1">75</font></a>    there occur some observable passages of God's providence to a godly minister    in giving him " full clearness" concerning Bessie Grahame, suspected of witchcraft.    The whole detail is a curious illustration of the spirit of credulity which    well-disposed men brought with them to such investigations, and how easily the    gravest doubts were removed rather than a witch should be left undetected. 
 </p><p>      Bessie Grahame had been committed, it would    seem, under suspicions of no great weight, since the minister,  after various conferences, found her defence    so successful, that he actually pitied her hard usage, and wished for her delivery    from prison, especially as he doubted whether a civil court would send her to    an assize, or whether an assize would be disposed to convict her. While the    minister was in this doubt, a fellow named Begg was employed as a skilful pricker;    by whose authority it is not said, he thrust a great brass pin up to the head    in a wart on the woman's back, which he affirmed to be the devil's mark. A commission    was granted for trial; but still the chief gentlemen in the county refused to    act, and the clergyman's own doubts were far from being removed. This put the    worthy man upon a solemn prayer to God, " that if he would find out a way for    giving the minister full clearness of her guilt, he would acknowledge it as    a singular favour and mercy." This, according to his idea, was accomplished    in the following manner, which he regarded as an answer to his prayer. One evening    the clergyman, with Alexander Simpson, the kirk-officer, and his own servant,    had visited Bessie in her cell, to urge her to confession, but in vain. As they    stood on the stair-head behind the door, they heard the prisoner, whom they    had left alone in her place of confinement, discoursing with another person,    who used a low and ghostly tone, which the minister instantly recognised as    the Foul Fiend's voice. But for this discovery we should have been of opinion    that Bessie Grahame talked to herself, as melancholy and despairing wretches    are in the habit of doing. But as Alexander Simpson pretended to understand    the sense of what was said within the cell, and the minister himself was pretty    sure he heard two voices at the same time, he regarded the overhearing this    conversation as the answer of the Deity to his petition, and thenceforth was    troubled with no doubts either as to the reasonableness and propriety of his    prayer, or the guilt of Bessie Grahame, though she died obstinate, and would    not confess; nay, made a most decent and Christian end, acquitting her  judges and jury of her blood, in respect of the    strong delusion under which they laboured. 
 </p><p>      Although the ministers, whose opinions were    but two strongly on this head in correspondence with the prevailing superstitious    of the people, nourished in the early system of church government a considerable    desire to secure their own immunities and privileges as a national church, which    failed not at last to be brought into contact with the king's prerogative; yet    in the earlier part of his reign, James, when freed from the influence of such    a favourite as the profligate Stuart, Earl of Arran, was in his personal qualities    rather acceptable to the clergy of his kingdom and period. At his departing    from Scotland on his romantic expedition to bring home a consort from Denmark,    he very politically recommended to the clergy to contribute all that lay in    their power to assist the civil magistrates, and preserve the public peace of    the kingdom. The king after his return acknowledged with many thanks the care    which the clergy had bestowed in this particular. Nor were they slack in assuming    the merit to themselves, for they often reminded him in their future discords    that his kingdom had never been so quiet as during his voyage to Denmark, when    the clergy were in a great measure intrusted with the charge of the public government. 
 </p><p>      During the halcyon period of union between kirk    and king their hearty agreement on the subject of witchcraft failed not to beat    the fires against the persons suspected of such iniquity. The clergy considered    that the Roman Catholics, their principal enemies, were equally devoted to the    devil, the mass, and the witches, which in their opinion were mutually associated    together, and natural allies in the great cause of mischief. On the other hand,    the pedantic sovereign having exercised his learning and ingenuity in the Demonologia,    considered the execution of every witch who was burnt as a necessary conclusion    of his own royal syllogisms. The juries were also afraid of the consequences  of acquittal to themselves, being liable to suffer    under an assize of error should they be thought to have been unjustly merciful;    and as the witches tried were personally as insignificant as the charge itself    was odious, there was no restraint whatever upon those in whose hands their    fate lay, and there seldom wanted some such confession as we have often mentioned,    or such evidence as that collected by the minister who overheard the dialogue    between the witch and her master, to salve their consciences and reconcile them    to bring in a verdict of guilty. 
 </p><p>      The execution of witches became for these reasons    very common in Scotland, where the king seemed in some measure to have made    himself a party in the cause, and the clergy esteemed themselves such from the    very nature of their profession. But the general spite of Satan and his adherents    was supposed to be especially directed against James, on account of his match    with Anne of Denmark -- the union of a Protestant princess with a Protestant    prince, the King of Scotland and heir of England being, it could not be doubted,    an event which struck the whole kingdom of darkness with alarm. James was self-gratified    by the unusual spirit which he had displayed on his voyage in quest of his bride,    and well disposed to fancy that he had performed it in positive opposition,    not only to the indirect policy of Elizabeth, but to the malevolent purpose    of hell itself. His fleet had been tempest-tost, and he very naturally believed    that the prince of the power of the air had been personally active on the occasion. 
 </p><p>      The principal person implicated in these heretical    and treasonable undertakings was one Agnes Simpson, or Samson, called the Wise    Wife of Keith, and described by Archbishop Spottiswood, not as one of the base    or ignorant class of ordinary witches, but a grave matron, composed and deliberate    in her answers, which were all to some purpose. This grave dame, from the terms    of her indictment, seems to have been a kind of white witch,  affecting to cure diseases by words and charms,    a dangerous profession considering the times in which she lived. Neither did    she always keep the right and sheltered side of the law in such delicate operations.    One article of her indictment proves this, and at the same time establishes    that the Wise Woman of Keith knew how to turn her profession to account; for,    being consulted in the illness of Isobel Hamilton, she gave her opinion that    nothing could amend her unless the devil was raised; and the sick woman's husband,    startling at the proposal, and being indifferent perhaps about the issue, would    not bestow the necessary expenses, whereupon the Wise Wife refused to raise    the devil, and the patient died. This woman was principally engaged in an extensive    conspiracy to destroy the fleet of the queen by raising a tempest; and to take    the king's life by anointing his linen with poisonous materials, and by constructing    figures of clay, to be wasted and tormented after the usual fashion of necromancy. 
 </p><p>      Amongst her associates was an unhappy lady of    much higher degree. This was Dame Euphane MacCalzean, the widow of a Senator    of the College of justice, and a person infinitely above the rank of the obscure    witches with whom she was joined in her crime. Mr. Pitcairn supposes that this    connexion may have arisen from her devotion to the Catholic faith and her friendship    for the Earl of Bothwell. 
 </p><p>      The third person in this singular league of    sorcerers was Doctor John Fian, otherwise Cunninghame, who was schoolmaster    at Tranent, and enjoyed much hazardous reputation as a warlock. This man was    made the hero of the whole tale of necromancy, in an account of it published    at London, and entitled, " News from Scotland," which has been lately reprinted    by the Roxburghe Club. It is remarkable that the Scottish witchcrafts were not    thought sufficiently horrible by the editor of this tract, without adding to    them the story of a philtre being applied to a cow's hair instead of  that of the young woman for whom it was designed,    and telling how the animal came lowing after the sorcerer to his schoolroom    door, like a second Pasiphaë, the original of which charm occurs in the    story of Apuleius. <a name="fr_75"></a><a href="#fn_75"><font size="1">76</font></a> 
 </p><p>      Besides these persons, there was one Barbara    Napier, alias Douglas, a person of some rank; Geillis Duncan, a very active    witch; and about thirty other poor creatures of the lowest condition -- among    the rest, and doorkeeper to the conclave, a silly old ploughman, called as his    nickname Graymeal, who was cuffed by the devil for saying simply, " God bless    the king !" 
 </p><p>      When the monarch of Scotland sprung this strong    covey of his favourite game, they afforded the Privy Council and him sport for    the greatest part of the remaining winter. He attended on the examinations himself,    and by one means or other, they were indifferently well dressed to his palate. 
 </p><p>      Agnes Sampson, the grave matron before mentioned,    after being an hour tortured by the twisting of a cord around her head, according    to the custom of the Buccaneers, confessed that she had consulted with one Richard    Grahame concerning the probable length of the king's life, and the means of    shortening it. But Satan, to whom they at length resorted for advice, told them    in French respecting King James, <i>Il est un homme de Dieu</i>. The poor woman    also acknowledged that she had held a meeting with those of her sisterhood,    who had charmed a cat by certain spells, having four joints of men knit to its    feet, which they threw into the sea to excite a tempest. Another frolic they    had when, like the weird sisters in Macbeth, they embarked in sieves with much    mirth and jollity, the Fiend rolling himself before them upon the waves, dimly    seen, and resembling a huge haystack in size and appearance. They went on board    of, foreign ship richly laded with wines, where, invisible to the crew, they    feasted till the sport grew tiresome, and then Satan sunk the vessel and all    on board.   Fian, or Cunninghame, was also visited by the    sharpest tortures, ordinary and extraordinary. The nails were torn from his    fingers with smith's pincers; pins were driven into the places which the nails    usually defended; his knees were crushed in <i>the boots</i>, his finger bones    were splintered in the pilniewinks. At length his constancy, hitherto sustained,    as the bystanders supposed, by the help of the devil, was fairly overcome, and    he gave an account of a great witch-meeting at North Berwick, where they paced    round the church.<i>withershinns</i>, that is, in reverse of the motion of the    sun. Fian then blew into the lock of the church-door, whereupon the bolts gave    way, the unhallowed crew entered, and their master the devil appeared to his    servants in the shape of a black man occupying the pulpit. He was saluted with    an " Hail, " Master !" but the company were dissatisfied with his not having    brought a picture of the king, repeatedly promised, which was to place his majesty    at the mercy of this infernal crew. The devil was particularly upbraided on    this subject by divers respectable-looking females -- no question, Euphane MacCalzean,    Barbara Napier, Agnes Sampson, and some other amateur witch above those of the    ordinary profession. The devil on this memorable occasion forgot himself, and    called Fian by his own name, instead of the demoniacal <i>sobriquet of</i> Rob    the Rowar, which had been assigned to him as Master of the Rows or Rolls. This    was considered as bad taste, and the rule is still observed at every rendezvous    of forgers, smugglers, or the like, where it is accounted very indifferent manners    to name an individual by his own name, in case of affording ground of evidence    which may upon a day of trial be brought against him. Satan, something disconcerted,    concluded the evening with a divertisement and a dance after his own manner.    The former consisted in disinterring a new-buried corpse, and dividing it in    fragments among the company, and the ball was maintained by well-nigh two hundred    persons, who danced a ring dance, singing this chant --   After this choral exhibition, the music seems    to have been rather imperfect, the number of dancers considered. Geillis Duncan    was the only instrumental performer, and she played on a Jew's harp, called    in Scotland a <i>trump</i>. Dr. Fian, muffled, led the ring, and was highly    honoured, generally acting as clerk or recorder, as above mentioned. 
 </p><p>      King James was deeply interested in those mysterious    meetings, and took great delight to be present at the examinations of the accused.    He sent for Geillis Duncan, and caused her to play before him the same tune    to which Satan and his companions led the brawl in North Berwick churchyard. <a name="fr_76"></a><a href="#fn_76"><font size="1">77</font></a>    His ears were gratified in another way, for at this meeting it was said the    witches demanded of the devil why he did bear such enmity against the king ?    who returned the flattering answer that the king was the greatest enemy whom    he had in the world. 
 </p><p>      Almost all these poor wretches were executed,    nor did Euphane MacCalzean's station in life save her from the common doom,    which was strangling to death, and burning to ashes thereafter. The majority    of the jury which tried Barbara Napier having acquitted her of attendance at    the North Berwick meeting, were themselves threatened with a trial for wilful    error upon an assize, and could only escape from severe censure and punishment    by pleading guilty, and submitting themselves to the king's pleasure. This rigorous    and iniquitous conduct shows a sufficient reason why there should be so few    acquittals from a charge of witchcraft where the juries were so much at the    mercy of the crown. 
 </p><p>     It would be disgusting to follow the numerous    cases  in which the same uniform credulity, the same    extort confessions, the same prejudiced and exaggerated evidence, concluded    in the same tragedy at the stake and the pile The alterations and trenching    which lately took place the purpose of improving the Castlehill of Edinburgh    displayed the ashes of the numbers who had perished in manner, of whom a large    proportion must have be executed between 1590, when the great discovery was    made concerning Euphane MacCalzean and the Wise Wire Keith and their accomplices,    and the union of the crowns. 
 </p><p>      Nor did King James's removal to England soften    this horrible persecution. In Sir Thomas Hamiltons's Minutes of Proceedings    in the Privy Council, there occurs a singular entry, evincing plainly that the    Earl of Mar, and others of James's Council, were becoming fully sensible of    the desperate iniquity and inhumanity of these proceedings. I have modernized    the spelling that this appalling record may be legible to all my readers. 
 </p><p>      "1608, December I. The Earl of Mar declared    to the Council that some women were taken in Broughton as witches, and being    put to an assize and convicted, albeit they persevered constant in their denial    to the end, yet they were burned quick [alive], after such a cruel manner that    some of them died in despair, renouncing and blaspheming [God]; and others,    half burned, brak out of the fire,  <a name="fr_77"></a><a href="#fn_77"><font size="1">78</font></a> and were cast quick in    it again, till they were burned to the death." 
 </p><p>      This singular document shows that even in the    reign of James, so soon as his own august person was removed from Edinburgh,    his dutiful Privy Council began to think that they had supt full with horrors,    and were satiated with the  excess of cruelty which dashed half-consumed    wretches back to the flames from which they were striving to escape. 
 </p><p>      But the picture, however much it may have been    disgusting and terrifying to the Council at the time, and though the intention    of the entry upon the records was obviously for the purpose of preventing such    horrid cruelties in future, had no lasting effect on the course of justice,    as the severities against witches were most unhappily still considered necessary.    Through the whole of the sixteenth, and the greater part of the seventeenth    century, little abatement in the persecution of this metaphysical crime of witchcraft    can be traced in the kingdom. Even while the Independents held the reins of    government, Cromwell himself, and his major-generals and substitutes, were obliged    to please the common people of Scotland by abandoning the victims accused of    witchcraft to the power of the law, though the journals of the time express    the horror and disgust with which the English sectarians beheld a practice so    inconsistent with their own humane principle of universal toleration. 
 </p><p>      Instead of plunging into a history of these    events which, generally speaking, are in detail as monotonous as they are melancholy,    it may amuse the reader to confine the narrative to a single trial, having in    the course of it some peculiar and romantic events. It is the tale of a sailor's    wife, more tragic in its event than that of the chestnut-muncher in Macbeth. <a name="fr_78"></a><a href="#fn_78"><font size="1">79</font></a> 
 </p><p>      Margaret Barclay, wife of Archibald Dein, burgess    of Irvine, had been slandered by her sister-in-law, Janet Lyal, the spouse of    John Dein, brother of Archibald, and by John Dein himself, as guilty of some    act of theft. Upon this provocation Margaret Barclay raised an action of slander    before the church court, which prosecution, after some procedure, the kirk-session    discharged by directing a. reconciliation  between the parties. Nevertheless, although the    two women shook hands before the court, yet the said Margaret Barclay declared    that she gave her hand only in obedience to the kirk-session, but that she still    retained her hatred and ill-will against John Dein and his wife, Janet Lyal.    About this time the bark of John Dein was about to sail for France, and Andrew    Train, or Tran, provost of the burgh of Irvine, who was an owner of the vessel,    went with him to superintend the commercial part of the voyage. Two other merchants    of some consequence went in the same vessel, with a sufficient number of mariners.    Margaret Barclay, the revengeful person already mentioned, was heard to imprecate    curses upon the provost's argosy, praying to God that sea nor salt-water might    never bear the ship, and that <i>partans</i> (crabs) might eat the crew at the    bottom of the sea. 
 </p><p>      When, under these auspices, the ship was absent    on her voyage, a vagabond fellow, named John Stewart, pretending to have knowledge    of jugglery, and to possess the power of a spaeman, came to the residence of    Tran, the provost, and dropped explicit hints that the ship was lost, and that    the good woman of the house was a widow. The sad truth was afterwards learned    on more certain information. Two of the seamen, after a space of doubt and anxiety,    arrived, with the melancholy tidings that the bark, of which John Dein was skipper    and Provost Tran part owner, had been wrecked on the coast of England, near    Padstow, when all on board had been lost, except the two sailors who brought    the notice. Suspicion of sorcery, in those days easily awakened, was fixed on    Margaret Barclay, who had imprecated curses on the ship, and on John Stewart,    the juggler, who had seemed to know of the evil fate of the voyage before he    could have become acquainted with it by natural means. 
 </p><p>      Stewart, who was first apprehended, acknowledged    that Margaret Barclay, the other suspected person, had applied to him to teach    her some magic arts, " in order that she might get gear, kye's milk, love of    man, her heart's desire on  such persons as had done her wrong, and, finally,    that she might obtain the fruit of sea and land." Stewart declared that he denied    to Margaret that he possessed the said arts himself, or had the power of communicating    them. So far as well; but, true or false, he added a string of circumstances,    whether voluntarily declared or extracted by torture, which tended to fix the    cause of the loss of the bark on Margaret Barclay. He had come, he said, to    this woman's house in Irvine, shortly after the ship set sail from harbour.    He went to Margaret's house by night, and found her engaged, with other two    women, in making clay figures; one of the figures was made handsome, with fair    hair, supposed o represent Provost Tran. They then proceeded to mould a figure    of a ship in clay, and during this labour the devil appeared to the company    in the shape of a handsome black lap-dog, such as ladies use to keep. <a name="fr_79"></a><a href="#fn_79"><font size="1">80</font></a>    He added that the whole party left the house together, and went into an empty    waste-house nearer the seaport, which house he pointed out to the city magistrates.    From this house they went to the sea-side, followed by the black lap-dog aforesaid,    and cast in the figures of clay representing the ship and the men; after which    the sea raged, roared, and became red like the juice of madder in a dyer's cauldron. 
 </p><p>      This confession having been extorted from the    unfortunate juggler, the female acquaintances of Margaret Barclay were next    convened, that he might point out her associates in forming the charm, when    he pitched upon a woman called Isobel Insh or Taylor, who resolutely denied    having ever seen him before. She was imprisoned, however, in the belfry of the    church. An addition to the evidence against the poor old woman Insh was then    procured from her own daughter, Margaret Tailzeour, a <i>child of eight years    old</i>, who lived as servant with Margaret Barclay, the person principally    accused. This child, who was keeper of a baby belonging to Margaret Barclay,    either from terror or the innate love of  falsehood which we have observed as proper to    childhood, declared that she was present when the fatal models of clay were    formed, and that, in plunging them in the sea, Margaret Barclay her mistress,    and her mother Isobel Insh, were assisted by another woman, and a girl of fourteen    years old who dwelt at the town-head. Legally considered, the evidence of this    child was contradictory and inconsistent with the confession of the juggler,    for it assigned other particular and <i>dramatis personæ</i> in many respects    different. But was accounted sufficiently regular, especially since the girl    failed not to swear to the presence of the black dog, to whose appearance she    also added the additional terrors of that of a black man. The dog also, according    to her account, emitted flashes from its jaws and nostrils to illuminate the    witches during the performance of the spell. The child maintained this story    even to her mother's face, only alleging that Isobel Insh remained behind in    the waste-house, and was not present when the images were put into the sea.    For her own countenance and presence on the occasion, and to ensure her secrecy,    her mistress promised her a pair of new shoes. 
 </p><p>      John Stewart, being re-examined and confronted    with the child, was easily compelled to allow that the " little smatchet" was    there, and to give that marvellous account of his correspondence with Elfland    which we have noticed elsewhere. 
 </p><p>      The conspiracy thus far, as they conceived,    disclosed, the magistrates and ministers wrought bard with Isobel Insh to prevail    upon her to tell the truth; and she at length acknowledged her presence at the    time when the models of the ship and mariners were destroyed, but endeavoured    so to modify her declaration as to deny all personal accession to the guilt.    This poor creature almost admitted the supernatural powers imputed to her, promising    Bailie Dunlop (also a mariner), by whom she was imprisoned, that, if he would    dismiss her, he should never make a bad voyage, but have success in all his  dealings by sea and land. She was finally brought    to promise that she would fully confess the whole that she knew of the affair    on the morrow. 
 </p><p>      But finding herself in so hard a strait, the    unfortunate woman made use of the darkness to attempt an escape. With this view    she got out by a back window of the belfry, although, says the report, there    were " iron bolts, locks, and fetters on her," and attained the roof of the    church, where, losing her footing, she sustained a severe fall and was greatly    bruised. Being apprehended, Bailie Dunlop again urged her to confess; but the    poor woman was determined to appeal to a more merciful tribunal, and maintained    her innocence to the last minute of her life, denying all that she had formerly    admitted, and dying five days after her fall from the roof of the church. The    inhabitants of Irvine attributed her death to poison. 
 </p><p>      The scene began to thicken, for a commission    was granted for the trial of the two remaining persons accused, namely, Stewart,    the juggler, and Margaret Barclay. The day of trial being arrived, the following    singular events took place, which we give as stated in the record: --  
 </p><p>      " My Lord and Earl of Eglintoune (who dwells    within the space of one mile to the said burgh) having come to the said burgh    at the earnest request of the said justices, for giving to them of his lordship's    countenance, concurrence and assistance, in trying of the foresaid devilish    practices, conform to the tenor of the foresaid commission, the said John Stewart,    for his better preserving to the day of the assize, was put in a sure lockfast    booth, where no manner of person might have access to him till the downsitting    of the justice Court, and for avoiding of putting violent bands on himself,    he was very strictly guarded and fettered by the arms, as use is. And upon that    same day of the assize, about half an hour before the downsitting of the justice    Court, Mr. David Dickson, minister at Irvine, and Mr. George Dunbar, minister    of Air, having gone to  him to exhort him to call on his God for mercy    for his bygone wicked and evil life, and that God would of his infinite mercy    loose him out of the bonds of the devil, whom he had served these many years    bygone, he acquiesced in their prayer and godly exhortation, and uttered these    words: -- " I am so straitly guarded that it lies not in my power to get my    hand to take off my bonnet, nor to get bread to my mouth.' And immediately after    the departing of the two ministers from him, the juggler being sent for at the    desire of my Lord of Eglintoune, to be confronted with a woman of the burgh    of Air, called Janet Bous, who was apprehended by the magistrates of the burgh    of Air for witchcraft, and sent to the burgh of Irvine purposely for that affair,    he was found by the burgh officers who went about him, strangled and hanged    by the cruik of the door, with a <i>tait</i> of hemp, or a string made of hemp,    supposed to have been his garter, or string of his bonnet, not above the length    of two span long, his knees not being from the ground half a span, and was brought    out of the house, his life not being totally expelled. But notwithstanding of    whatsoever means used in the contrary for remeid of his life, he revived not,    but so ended his life miserably, by the help of the devil his master. 
 </p><p>      " And because there was then only in life the    said Margaret Barclay, and that the persons summoned to pass upon her assize    and upon the assize of the juggler who, by the help of the devil his master,    had put violent hands on himself, were all present within the said burgh; therefore,    and for eschewing of the like in the person of the said Margaret, our sovereign    lord's justices in that part particularly above-named, constituted by commission    after solemn deliberation and advice of the said noble lord, whose concurrence    and advice was chiefly required and taken in this matter, concluded with all    possible diligence before the downsitting of the Justice Court to put the said    Margaret in torture; in respect the devil, by God's permission, had made her    associates  who were the lights of the cause, to be their    own <i>burrioes</i> (slayers). They used the torture underwritten as being most    safe and gentle (as the said noble lord assured the said justices), by putting    of her two bare legs in a pair of stocks, and thereafter by onlaying of certain    iron gauds (bars) severally one by one, and then eiking and augmenting the weight    by laying on more gauds, and in easing of her by offtaking of the iron gauds    one or more as occasion offered, which iron gauds were but little short gauds,    and broke not the skin of her legs, &amp;c. 
 </p><p>      " After using of the which kind of gentle torture,    the said Margaret began, according to the increase of the pain, to cry and crave    for God's cause to take off her shins the foresaid. irons, and she should declare    truly the whole matter. Which being removed, she began at her former denial;    and being of new essayed in torture as of befoir, she then uttered these words:    ' Take off, take off, and before God I shall show you the whole form !' 
 </p><p>      " And the said irons being of new, upon her    faithfull promise, removed, she then desired my Lord of Eglintoune, the said    four justices, and the said Mr. David Dickson, minister of the burgh, Mr. George    Dunbar, minister of Ayr, and Mr. Mitchell Wallace, minister of Kilmarnock, and    Mr. John Cunninghame, minister of Dalry, and Hugh Kennedy, provost of Ayr, to    come by themselves and to remove all others, and she should declare truly, as    she should answer to God the whole matter. Whose desire in that being fulfilled    she made her confession in this manner, but (<i>i.e.</i>, without) any kind    of demand, freely, without interrogation; God's name by earnest prayer being    called upon for opening of her lips, and easing of her heart, that she, by rendering    of the truth, might glorify and magnify his holy name, and disappoint the enemy    of her salvation." -- <i>Trial of Margaret Barclay, &amp;c.</i>, 1618. 
 </p><p>      Margaret Barclay, who was a young and lively    person, had hitherto conducted herself like a passionate and high  tempered woman innocently accused, and the only    appearance of conviction obtained against her was, that she carried about her    rowan-tree and coloured thread, to make, as she said, her cow give milk, when    it began to fail. But the <i>gentle torture</i> -- a strange junction of words    -- recommended as an anodyne by the good Lord Eglinton -- the placing, namely,    her legs in the stocks, and loading her bare shins with bars of iron, overcame    her resolution; when, at her screams and declarations that she was willing to    tell all, the weights were removed. She then told a story of destroying the    ship of John Dein, affirming that it was with the purpose of killing only her    brother-in-law and Provost Tran, and saving the rest of the crew. She at the    same time involved in the guilt Isobel Crawford. This poor woman was also apprehended,    and in great terror confessed the imputed crime, retorting the principal blame    on Margaret Barclay herself. The trial was then appointed to proceed, when Alexander    Dein, the husband of Margaret Barclay, appeared in court with a lawyer to act    in his wife's behalf. Apparently, the sight of her husband awakened some hope    and desire of life, for when the prisoner was asked by the lawyer whether she    wished to be defended ? she answered, " As you please. But all I have confest    was in agony of torture; and, before God, all I have spoken is false and untrue."    To which she pathetically added, " Ye have been too long in coming." 
 </p><p>      The jury, unmoved by these affecting circumstances,    proceeded upon the principle that the confession of the accused could not be    considered as made tinder the influence of torture, since the bars were not    actually upon her limbs at the time it was delivered, although they were placed    at her elbow ready to be again laid on her bare shins, if she was less explicit    in her declaration than her auditors wished. On this nice distinction they in    one voice found Margaret Barclay guilty. It is singular that she should have    again returned to her confession after sentence, and died affirming it; the    explanation of which, however, might be either that she had  really in her ignorance and folly tampered with    some idle spells, or that an apparent penitence for her offence, however imaginary,    was the only mode in which she could obtain any share of public sympathy at    her death, or a portion of the prayers of the clergy and congregation, which,    in her circumstances, she might be willing to purchase, even by confession of    what all believed respecting her. It is remarkable that she earnestly entreated    the magistrates that no harm should be done to Isobel Crawford, the woman whom    she had herself accused. This unfortunate young creature was strangled at the    stake, and her body burnt to ashes, having died with many expressions of religion    and penitence. 
 </p><p>      It was one fatal consequence of these cruel    persecutions, that one pile was usually lighted at the embers of another. Accordingly    in the present case, three victims having already perished by this accusation,    the magistrates, incensed at the nature of the crime, so perilous as it seemed    to men of a maritime life, and at the loss of several friends of their own,    one of whom had been their principal magistrate, did not forbear to insist against    Isobel Crawford, inculpated by Margaret Barclay's confession. A new commission    was granted for her trial, and after the assistant minister of Irvine, Mr. David    Dickson, had made earnest prayers to God for opening her obdurate and closed    heart, she was subjected to the torture of iron bars laid upon her bare shins,    her feet being in the stocks, as in the case of Margaret Barclay. 
 </p><p>      She endured this torture with incredible firmness,    since she did " admirably, without any kind of din or exclamation, suffer above    thirty stone of iron to be laid on her legs, never shrinking thereat in any    sort, but remaining, as it were, steady." But in shifting the situation of the    iron bars, and removing them to another part of her shins, her constancy gave    way; she broke out into horrible cries (though not more than three bars were    then actually on her person) of -- " Tak aff -- tak aff!" On being relieved    from the torture,  she made the usual confession of all that she    was charged with, and of a connexion with the devil which had subsisted for    several years. Sentence was given against her accordingly. After this had been    denounced, she openly denied all her former confessions, and died without any    sign of repentance, offering repeated interruption to the minister in his prayer,    and absolutely refusing to pardon the executioner. 
 </p><p>      This tragedy happened in the year 1613, and    recorded, as it is, very particularly and at considerable length, forms the    most detailed specimen I have met with of a Scottish trial for witchcraft --    illustrating, in particular, how poor wretches, abandoned, as they conceived,    by God and the world, deprived of all human sympathy, and exposed to personal    tortures of an acute description, became disposed to throw away the lives that    were rendered bitter to them by a voluntary confession of guilt, rather than    struggle hopelessly against so many evils. Four persons here lost their lives,    merely because the throwing some clay models into the sea, a fact told differently    by the witnesses who spoke of it, corresponded with the season, for no day was    fixed in which a particular vessel was lost. It is scarce possible that, after    reading such a story, a man of sense can listen for an instant to the evidence    founded on confessions thus obtained, which has been almost the sole reason    by which a few individuals, even in modern times, have endeavoured to justify    a belief in the existence of witchcraft. 
 </p><p>      The result of the judicial examination of a    criminal, when extorted by such means, is the most suspicious of all evidence,    and even when voluntarily given, is scarce admissible without the corroboration    of other testimony. 
 </p><p>      We might here take leave of our Scottish history    of witchcraft by barely mentioning that many hundreds, nay perhaps thousands,    lost their lives during two centuries on such charges and such evidence as proved    the death of those persons in the trial of the Irvine witches. One case, however,    is so much distinguished by fame among the  numerous instances which occurred in Scottish    history, that we are under the necessity of bestowing a few words upon those    celebrated persons, Major Weir and his sister. 
 </p><p>      The case of this notorious wizard was remarkable    chiefly from his being a man of some condition (the son of a gentleman, and    his mother a lady of family in Clydesdale), which was seldom the case with those    that fell under similar accusations. It was also remarkable in his case that    he had been a Covenanter, and peculiarly attached to that cause. In the years    of the Commonwealth this man was trusted and employed by those who were then    at the head of affairs, and was in 1649 commander of the City-Guard of Edinburgh,    which Procured him his title of Major. In this capacity he was understood, as    was indeed implied in the duties of that officer at the period, to be very strict    in executing severity upon such Royalists as fell under his military charge.    It appears that the Major, with a maiden sister who had kept his house, was    subject to fits of melancholic lunacy, an infirmity easily reconcilable with    the formal pretences which he made to a high show of religious zeal. He was    peculiar in his gift of prayer, and, as was the custom of the period, was often    called to exercise his talent by the bedside of sick persons, until it came    to be observed that, by some association, which it is more easy to conceive    than to explain, he could not pray with the same warmth and fluency of expression    unless when he had in his hand a stick of peculiar shape and appearance, which    he generally walked with. It was noticed, in short, that when this stick was    taken from him, his wit and talent appeared to forsake him. This Major Weir    was seized by the magistrates on a strange whisper that became current respecting    vile practices, which he seems to have admitted without either shame or contrition.    The disgusting profligacies which he confessed were of such a character that    it may be charitably hoped most of them were the fruits of a depraved imagination,  though he appears to have been in many respects    a wicked and criminal hypocrite. When he had completed his confession, he avowed    solemnly that he had not confessed the hundredth part of the crimes which he    had committed. From this time he would answer no interrogatory, nor would he    have recourse to prayer, arguing that, as he had no hope whatever of escaping    Satan, there was no need of incensing him by vain efforts at repentance. His    witchcraft seems to have been taken for granted on his own confession, as his    indictment was chiefly founded on the same document, in which he alleged he    had never seen the devil, but any feeling he had of him was in the dark. He    received sentence of death, which he suffered 12th April, 1670, at the Gallow-hill,    between Leith and Edinburgh. He died so stupidly sullen and impenitent as to    justify the opinion that he was oppressed with a kind of melancholy frenzy,    the consequence perhaps of remorse, but such as urged him not to repent, but    to despair. It seems probable that he was burnt alive. His sister, with whom    he was supposed to have had an incestuous connexion, was condemned also to death,    leaving a stronger and more explicit testimony of their mutual sins than could    be extracted from the Major. She gave, as usual, some account of her connexion    with the queen of the fairies, and acknowledged the assistance she received    from that sovereign in spinning an unusual quantity of yarn. Of her brother    she said that one day a friend called upon them at noonday with a fiery chariot,    and invited them to visit a friend at Dalkeith, and that while there her brother    received information of the event of the battle of Worcester. No one saw the    style of their equipage except themselves. On the scaffold this woman, determining,    as she said, to die " with the greatest shame possible," was with difficulty    prevented from throwing off her clothes before the people, and with scarce less    trouble was she flung from the ladder by the executioner. Her last words were    in the tone of the sect to which  her brother had so long affected to belong: "    Many," said, " weep and lament for a poor old wretch like me; but alas ! few    are weeping for a broken Covenant." 
 </p><p>      The Scottish prelatists, upon whom the Covenanters    used to throw many aspersions respecting their receiving proof against shot    from the devil, and other infernal practices, rejoiced to have an opportunity,    in their turn, to retort on their adversaries the charge of sorcery. Dr. Hickes,    the author of " Thesaurus Septentrionalis," published on the subject of Major    Weir, and the case of Mitchell, who fired at the Archbishop of St. Andrews his    book called " Ravaillac Redivivus," written with the unjust purpose of attaching    to the religious sect to which the wizard and assassin belonged the charge of    having fostered and encouraged the crimes they committed or attempted. 
 </p><p>      It is certain that no story of witchcraft or    necromancy, so many of which occurred near and in Edinburgh, made such a lasting    impression on the public mind as that of Major Weir. The remains of the house    in which he and his sister lived are still shown at the head of the West Bow,    which has a gloomy aspect, well suited for a necromancer. It was at different    times a brazier's shop and a magazine for lint, and in my younger days was employed    for the latter use; but no family would inhabit the haunted walls as a residence;    and bold was the urchin from the High School who dared approach the gloomy ruin    at the risk of seeing the Major's enchanted staff parading through the old apartments,    or hearing the hum of the necromantic wheel, which procured for his sister such    a character as a spinner. At the time I am writing this last fortress of superstitious    renown is in the the course of being destroyed, in order to the modern improvements    now carrying on in a quarter long thought unimprovable. 
 </p><p>      As knowledge and learning began to increase,    the gentlemen and clergy of Scotland became ashamed of the credulity of their    ancestors, and witch trials, although not  discontinued, more seldom disgrace our records    of criminal jurisprudence. 
 </p><p>      Sir John Clerk, a scholar and an antiquary,    the grandfather of the late celebrated John Clerk of Eldin, had the honour to    be amongst the first to decline acting as a commissioner on the trial of a witch,    to which he was appointed so early as 1678, <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="lodw10.htm#fn_80"><font size="1">81</font></a> alleging, drily,    that he did not feel himself warlock (that is, conjurer) sufficient to be a    judge upon such an inquisition. Allan Ramsay, his friend, and who must be supposed    to speak the sense of his many respectable patrons, had delivered his opinion    on the subject in the " Gentle Shepherd," where Mause's imaginary witchcraft    constitutes the machinery of the poem. 
 </p><p>      Yet these dawnings of sense and humanity were    obscured by the clouds of the ancient superstition on more than one distinguished    occasion. In 1676, Sir George Maxwell, of Pollock, apparently a man of melancholic    and valetudinary habits, believed himself bewitched to death by six witches,    one man and five women, who were leagued for the purpose of tormenting a clay    image in his likeness. The chief evidence on the subject was a vagabond girl,    pretending to be deaf and dumb. But as her imposture was afterwards discovered    and herself punished, it is reasonably to be concluded that she had herself    formed the picture or image of Sir George, and had hid it where it was afterwards    found in consequence of her own information. In the meantime, five of the accused    were executed, and the sixth only escaped on account of extreme youth. 
 </p><p>      A still more remarkable case occurred at Paisley    in 1697, where a young girl, about eleven years of age, daughter of John Shaw,    of Bargarran, was the principal evidence. This unlucky damsel, beginning her    practices out of a quarrel with a maid-servant, continued to imitate a case    of possession so accurately that no less than twenty persons were condemned    upon her evidence, of whom five were executed, besides one  John Reed, who hanged himself in prison, or,    as was charitably said, was strangled by the devil in person, lest he should    make disclosures to the detriment of the service. But even those who believed    in witchcraft were now begin to open their eyes to the dangers in the present    mode of prosecution. " I own," says the Rev. Mr. Bell in his MS. " Treatise    on Witchcraft," " there has been much harm done to worthy and innocent persons    in the common way of finding out witches, and in the means made use of for promoting    the discovery of such wretches and bringing them to justice; so that oftentimes    old age, poverty, features, and ill-fame, with such like grounds not worthy    to be represented to a magistrate, have yet moved many to suspect and defame    their neighbours, to the unspeakable prejudice of Christian charity; a late    instance whereof we had in the west, in the business of the sorceries exercised    upon the Laird of Bargarran's daughter, anno 1697 -- a time when persons of    more goodness and esteem than most of their calumniators were defamed for witches,    and which was occasioned mostly by the forwardness and absurd credulity of diverse    otherwise worthy ministers of the gospel, and some topping professors in and    about the city of Glasgow."  <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="lodw10.htm#fn_81"><font size="1">82</font></a> 
 </p><p>      Those who doubted of the sense of the law or    reasonableness of the practice in such cases, began to take courage and state    their objections boldly. In the year 1704 a frightful instance of popular bigotry    occurred at Pittenweem. A strolling vagabond, who affected fits, laid an accusation    of witchcraft against two women, who were accordingly seized on, and imprisoned    with the usual severities. One of the unhappy creatures, Janet Cornfoot by name,    escaped from prison, but was unhappily caught, and brought back to Pittenweem,    where she fell into the hands of a ferocious mob, consisting of rude seamen    and fishers. The magistrates made no attempts for her rescue, and the crowd  exercised their brutal pleasure on the poor old    woman, pelted her with stones, swung her suspended on a rope betwixt a ship    and the shore, and finally ended her miserable existence by throwing a door    over her as she lay exhausted on the beach, and heaping stones upon it till    she was pressed to death. As even the existing laws against witchcraft were    transgressed by this brutal riot, a warm attack was made upon the magistrates    and ministers of the town by those who were shocked at a tragedy of such a horrible    cast. There were answers published, in which the parties assailed were zealously    defended. The superior authorities were expected to take up the affair, but    it so happened, during the general distraction of the country concerning the    Union, that the murder went without the investigation which a crime so horrid    demanded. Still, however, it was something gained that the cruelty was exposed    to the public. The voice of general opinion was now appealed to, and in the    long run the sentiments which it advocates are commonly those of good sense    and humanity. 
 </p><p>      The officers in the higher branches of the law    dared now assert their official authority and reserve for their own decision    cases of supposed witchcraft which the fear of public clamour had induced them    formerly to leave in the hands of inferior judges, operated upon by all the    prejudices of the country and the populace. 
 </p><p>      In 1718, the celebrated lawyer, Robert Dundas    of Arniston, then King's Advocate, wrote a severe letter of censure to the Sheriff-depute    of Caithness, in the first place, as having neglected to communicate officially    certain precognitions which he had led respecting some recent practices of witchcraft    in his county. The Advocate reminded this local judge that the duty of inferior    magistrates, in such cases, was to advise with the King's Counsel, first, whether    they should be made subject of a trial or not; and if so, before what court,    and in what manner, it should take place. He also called the magistrate's attention    to a report, that he,  the Sheriff-depute, intended to judge in the    case himself; " a thing of too great difficulty to be tried without very deliberate    advice, and beyond the jurisdiction of an inferior court." The Sheriff-depute    sends, with his apology, the <i>precognition</i> <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="lodw10.htm#fn_82"><font size="1">83</font></a> of the affair,    which is one of the most nonsensical in this nonsensical department of the law.    A certain carpenter, named William Montgomery, was so infested with cats, which,    as his servant-maid reported, " spoke among themselves," that he fell in a rage    upon a party of these animals which had assembled in his house at irregular    hours, and betwixt his Highland arms of knife, dirk, and broad-sword, and his    professional weapon of an axe, he made such a dispersion that they were quiet    for the night. In consequence of his blows, two witches were said to have died.    The case of, a third, named Nin Gilbert, was still more remarkable. Her leg    being broken, the injured limb withered, pined, and finally fell off; on which    the hag was enclosed in prison, where she also died; and the question which    remained was, whether any process should be directed against persons whom, in    her compelled confession, she had, as usual, informed against. The Lord Advocate,    as may be supposed, quashed all further procedure. 
 </p><p>      In 1720, an unlucky boy, the third son of James,    Lord Torphichen, took it into his head, under instructions, it is said, from    a knavish governor, to play the possessed and bewitched person, laying the cause    of his distress on certain old witches in Calder, near to which village his    father had his mansion. The women were imprisoned, and one or two of them died;    but the Crown counsel would not proceed to trial. The noble family also began    to see through the cheat. The boy was sent to sea, and though he is said at    one time to have been disposed to try his fits while on  board, when the discipline of the navy proved    too sever for his cunning, in process of time he became a good sailor, assisted    gallantly in defence of the vessel against the pirates of Angria, and finally    was drowned in a storm. 
 </p><p>      In the year 1722, a Sheriff-depute of Sutherland,    Captain David Ross of Littledean, took it upon him, in flagrant violation of    the then established rules of jurisdiction, to pronounce the last sentence of    death for witchcraft which was ever passed in Scotland. The victim was an insane    old woman belonging to the parish of Loth, who had so little idea of her situation    as to rejoice at the sight of the fire which was destined to consume her. She    had a daughter lame both of hands and feet, a circumstance attributed to the    witch's having been used to transform her into a pony, and get her shod by the    devil. It does not appear that any punishment was inflicted for this cruel abuse    of the law on the person of a creature so helpless; but the lame daughter, he    himself distinguished by the same misfortune, was living so lately as to receive    the charity of the present Marchioness of Stafford, Countess of Sutherland in    her own right, to whom the poor of her extensive country are as well known as    those of the higher order. 
 </p><p>      Since this deplorable action there has been    no judicial interference in Scotland on account of witchcraft, unless to prevent    explosions of popular enmity against people suspected of such a crime, of which    some instances could be produced. The remains of the superstition sometimes    occur; there can be no doubt that the vulgar are still addicted to the custom    of scoring above the breath <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="lodw10.htm#fn_83"><font size="1">84</font></a> (as it is termed), and other counter-spells,    evincing that the belief in witchcraft is only asleep, and might in remote comers    be again awakened to deeds of blood. An instance or two may be quoted chiefly    as facts known to the author himself.   In a remote part of the Highlands, an ignorant    and malignant woman seems really to have meditated the destruction of her neighbour's    property, by placing in a cowhouse, or byre as we call it, a pot of baked clay    containing locks of hair, parings of nails, and other trumpery. This precious    spell was discovered, the design conjectured, and the witch would have been    torn to pieces had not a high-spirited and excellent lady in the neighbourhood    gathered some of her people (though these were not very fond of the service),    and by main force taken the unfortunate creature out of the hands of the populace.    The formidable spell is now in my possession. 
 </p><p>      About two years since, as they were taking down    the walls of a building formerly used as a feeding-house for cattle, in the    town of Dalkeith, there was found below the threshold-stone the withered heart    of some animal stuck fall of many scores of pins -- a counter-charm, according    to tradition, against the operations of witchcraft on the cattle which are kept    within. Among the almost innumerable droves of bullocks which come down every    year from the Highlands for the south, there is scarce one but has a curious    knot upon his tail, which is also a precaution lest an evil eye or an evil spell    may do the animal harm. 
 </p><p>      The last Scottish story with which I will trouble    you happened in or shortly after the year 1800, and the whole circumstances    are well known to me. The dearth of the years in the end of the eighteenth and    beginning of this century was inconvenient to all, but distressing to the poor.    A solitary old woman, in a wild and lonely district, subsisted chiefly by rearing    chickens, an operation requiring so much care and attention that the gentry,    and even the farmers' wives, often find it better to buy poultry at a certain    age than to undertake the trouble of bringing them up. As the old woman in the    present instance fought her way through life better than her neighbours, envy    stigmatized her as having some unlawful mode of increasing the gains of her  little trade, and apparently she did not take    much alarm at the accusation. But she felt, like others, the dearth of the years    alluded to, and chiefly because the farmers were un-willing to sell grain in    the very moderate quantities which she was able to purchase, and without which    her little stock of poultry must have been inevitably starved. In distress on    this account, the dame went to a neigbbouring farmer, a very good-natured, sensible,    honest man, and requested him as a favour to sell her a peck of oats at any    price. " Good neighbour," he said, " I am sorry to be obliged to refuse you,    but my corn is measured out for Dalkeith market; my carts are loaded to set    out, and to open these sacks again, and for so small a quantity, would cast    my accounts loose, and create much trouble and disadvantage; I dare say you    will get all you want at such a place, or such a place." On receiving this answer,    the old woman's temper gave way. She scolded the wealthy farmer, and wished    evil to his property, which was just setting off for the market. They parted,    after some angry language on both sides; and sure enough, as the carts crossed    the ford of the river beneath the farm-house, off came the wheel from one of    them, and five or six sacks of corn were damaged by the water. The good farmer    hardly knew what to think of this; there were the two circumstances deemed of    old essential and sufficient to the crime of witchcraft-<i>Damnum minatum</i>,    <i>et malum secutum</i>. Scarce knowing what to believe, he hastened to consult    the sheriff of the county, as a friend rather than a magistrate, upon a case    so extraordinary. The official person showed him that the laws against witchcraft    were abrogated, and had little difficulty to bring him to regard the matter    in its true light of an accident. 
 </p><p>      It is strange, but true, that the accused herself    was not to be reconciled to the sheriff's doctrine so easily. He reminded her    that, if she used her tongue with so much license, she must expose herself to    suspicions, and that should coincidences happen to irritate her neighbours,    she  might suffer harm at a time when there was no    one to protect her. He therefore requested her to be more cautious in her language    for her own sake, professing, at the same time, his belief that her words and    intentions were perfectly harmless, and that he had no apprehension of being    hurt by her, let her wish her worst to him. She was rather more angry than pleased    at the well-meaning sheriff's scepticism. " I would be laith to wish ony ill    either to you or yours, sir," she said; " for I kenna how it is, but something    aye comes after my words when I am ill-guided and speak ower fast." In short,    she was obstinate in claiming an influence over the destiny of others by words    and wishes, which might have in other times conveyed her to the stake, for which    her expressions, their consequences, and her disposition to insist upon their    efficacy, would certainly of old have made her a fit victim. At present the    story is scarcely worth mentioning, but as it contains material resembling those    out of which many tragic incidents have arisen. 
 </p><p>      So low, in short, is now the belief in witchcraft,    that perhaps it is only received by those half-crazy individuals who feel a    species of consequence derived from accidental coincidences, which, were they    received by the community in general, would go near, as on former occasions,    to cost the lives of those who make their boast of them. At least one hypochondriac    patient is known to the author, who believes himself the victim of a gang of    witches, and ascribes his illness to their charms, so that he wants nothing    but an indulgent judge to awake again the old ideas of sorcery. <br> <br>
