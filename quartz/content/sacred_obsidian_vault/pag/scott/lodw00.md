 <p>     Sir Walter Scott's "Letters on Demonology and    Witchcraft" were his contribution to a series of books, published by John Murray,    which appeared between the years 1829 and 1847, and formed a collection of eighty    volumes known as "Murray's Family Library." The series was planned to secure    a wide diffusion of good literature in cheap five shilling volumes, and Scott's    "Letters," written and published in 1830, formed one of the earlier books in    the collection. 
 </p><p>      The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge    had been founded in the autumn of 1826, and Charles Knight, who had then conceived    a plan of a National Library, was entrusted, in July, 1827, with the superintendence    of its publications. Its first treatises appeared in sixpenny numbers, once    a fortnight. Its " British Almanac" and "Companion to the Almanac" first    appeared at the beginning of 1829. Charles Knight started also in that year    his own " Library of Entertaining Knowledge." John Murray's " Family Library"    was then begun, and in the spring of 1832-the year of the Reform Bill-the advance    of civilization by the diffusion of good literature, through cheap journals    as well as cheap books, was sought by the establishment of " Chambers's Edinburgh    journal" in the North, and in London of " The Penny Magazine." 
 </p><p>      In the autumn of that year, 1832, on the 21st    of September, Sir Walter Scott died. The first warning of death had come to    him in February, 1830, with a stroke of apoplexy. He had been visited by an    old friend who brought him memoirs of her father, which he had promised to revise    for the press. He seemed for half  an hour to be bending over the papers at his    desk, and reading them; then he rose, staggered into the drawing-room, and fell,    remaining speechless until he had been bled. Dieted for weeks on pulse and water,    he so far recovered that to friends outside his family but little change in    him was visible. In that condition, in the month after his seizure, he was writing    these Letters, and also a fourth series of the "Tales of a Grandfather." The    slight softening of the brain found after death had then begun. But the old    delight in anecdote and skill in story-telling that, at the beginning of his    career, had caused a critic of his " Border Minstrelsy" to say that it contained    the germs of a hundred romances, yet survived. It gave to Scott's " Letters    on Demonology and Witchcraft" what is for us now a pathetic charm. Here and    there some slight confusion of thought or style represents the flickering of    a light that flashes yet with its old brilliancy. There is not yet the manifest    suggestion of the loss of power that we find presently afterwards in " Count    Robert of Paris" and " Castle Dangerous," published in 1831 as the Fourth Series    of " Tales of My Landlord," with which he closed his life's work at the age    of sixty. 
 </p><p>     Milton has said that he who would not be frustrate    of his hope to write well in laudable things, ought himself to be a true poem.    Scott's life was a true poem, of which the music entered into all he wrote.    If in his earlier days the consciousness of an unlimited productive power tempted    him to make haste to be rich, that he might work out, as founder of a family,    an ideal of life touched by his own genius of romance, there was not in his    desire for gain one touch of sordid greed, and his ideal of life only brought    him closer home to all its duties. Sir Walter Scott's good sense, as Lord Cockburn    said, was a more wonderful gift than his genius. When the mistake of a trade    connection with James Ballantyne brought ruin to him in 1826, he repudiated    bankruptcy, took on himself the burden of' debt of £ 130,000, and sacrificed    his life to the successful  endeavour to pay off all. What was left unpaid    at his death was cleared afterwards by the success of his annotated edition    of his novels. No tale of physical strife in the battlefield could be as heroic    as the story of the close of Scott's life, with five years of a death-struggle    against adversity, animated by the truest sense of honour. When the rum was    impending he wrote in his diary, " If things go badly in London, the magic wand    of the Unknown will be shivered in his grasp. The feast of fancy will be over    with the feeling of independence. He shall no longer have the delight of waking    in the morning with bright ideas in his mind, hasten 'to commit them to paper,    and count them monthly, as the means of planting such scaurs and purchasing    such wastes; replacing dreams of fiction by other prospective visions of walks    by <br> <br> 'Fountain-heads, and pathless groves; <br> Places which pale passion loves.' <br> 
 </p><p>     This cannot be; but I may work substantial husbandry    <i>i.e</i>., write history, and such, concerns." It was under pressure of calamity    like this that Sir Walter Scott was compelled to make himself known as the author    of "Waverley." Closely upon this followed the death of his wife, his thirty    years' companion. "I have been to her room," he wrote in May, 1826; "there    was no voice in it no stirring; the pressure of the coffin was visible on the    bed, but it had been removed elsewhere; all was neat as she loved it, but all    was calm-calm as death. I remembered the last sight of her: she raised herself    in bed, and tried to turn her eyes after me, and said with a sort of smile,    'You have all such melancholy faces.' These were the last words I ever heard    her utter, and I hurried away, for she did not seem quite conscious of what    she said; when I returned, immediately departing, she was in a deep sleep. It    is deeper now. This was but seven days since. They are arranging the chamber    of death-that which was, long the  apartment of connubial happiness, and of whose    arrangement (better than in richer houses) she was so proud. They are treading    fast and thick. For weeks you could have heard a footfall. Oh, my God!" 
 </p><p>      A few years yet of his own battle, while the    shadows of night and death were gathering about him, and they were re-united.    In these "Letters upon Demonology and Witchcraft," addressed to his son-in-law,    written under the first grasp of death, the old kindliness and good sense, joined    to the old charm in story-telling, stand firm yet against every assault; and    even in the decay that followed, when the powers were broken of the mind that    had breathed, and is still breathing, its own health into the minds of tens    of thousands of his countrymen, nothing could break the fine spirit of love    and honour that was in him. When the end was very near, and the son-in-law to    whom these Letters were addressed found him one morning entirely himself, though    in the last extreme of feebleness: his eye was clear and calm-every trace of    the wild fire of delirium was extinguished: "Lockhart," he said, "I may have    but a minute to speak to you. My dear, be a good man--be virtuous, be religious--be    a good man. Nothing else will give you any comfort when you come to lie here." 
 </p><p>      Another volume of this Library may give occasion    to recall Scott in the noontide of his strength, companion of <br> <br> "The blameless Muse who trains her sons <br> For hope and calm enjoyment." <br> 
 </p><p>     Here we remember only how from among dark clouds    the last light of his genius shone on the path of those who were endeavouring    to make the daily bread of intellectual life-good books-common to all.
