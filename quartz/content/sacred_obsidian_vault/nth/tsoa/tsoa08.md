 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/finit.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">For</span> thousands of years the riddle of the universe has been the question of causation. Did the egg come first, or the chicken? "The globe," says an Eastern proverb, "rests upon the howdah of an elephant. The elephant stands upon a tortoise, swimming in a sea of milk." But then what?  
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p>And what is life? As the Persian poet puts it—</p>

 <p>It has been said that every man, consciously or unconsciously, is either a materialist or an idealist. Certainly throughout the ages the schools of philosophy as well as individuals have argued and quarrelled, but always human thought through one or the other of these channels "has rolled down the hill of speculation into the ocean of doubt."</p>  
 <p>The materialist, roughly speaking, declares that nothing exists but matter and the forces inherent therein.</p>  
 <p>The idealist declares that all is mind or energy, and that matter is necessarily unreal.</p>  
 <p>The time has come when people have</p>  
 <p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="green">p. 79</font></a></p>  
 <p>become dissatisfied with these unceasing theories which get them nowhere. And today, as the appreciation of a Primal Cause becomes more clearly defined, the spiritual instinct asserts itself determinedly.</p>  
 <p>"Give me a base of support," said Archimedes, "and with a lever I will move the world."</p>  
 <p>And the base of support is that all started with <i>mind</i>. In the beginning was nothing—a fire mist. Before anything could come of it there had to be an idea, a model on which to build. <i>Universal Mind</i> supplied that idea, that model. Therefore the primal cause is mind. Everything must start with an idea. Every event, every condition, every thing is first an idea in the mind of someone.</p>  
 <p>Before you start to build a house, you</p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>draw up a plan of it. You make an exact blue-print of that plan, and your house takes shape in accordance with your blue-print. Every material object takes form in the same way. Mind draws the plan. Thought forms the blueprint, well drawn or badly done as your thoughts are clear or vague. It all goes back to the one cause. The creative principle of the universe is mind, and thought is the eternal energy.</p>  
 <p>But just as the effect you get from electricity depends upon the mechanism to which the power is attached, so the effects you get from mind depend upon the way you use it. We are all of us dynamos. The power is there—unlimited power. But we've got to connect it up to something—set it some task—give it work to do—else are we no better off then the animals.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></a></p>  
 <p>The "Seven Wonders of the World" were built by men with few of the opportunities or facilities that are available to you. They conceived these gigantic projects first in their own minds, pictured them so vividly that their subconscious minds came to their aid and enabled them to overcome obstacles that most of us would regard as insurmountable. Imagine building the Pyramids of Gizeh, enormous stone upon enormous stone, with nothing but bare hands. Imagine the labor, the sweat, the heartbreaking toil of erecting the Colossus of Rhodes, between whose legs a ship could pass! Yet men built these wonders, in a day when tools were of the crudest and machinery was undreamed of, by using the unlimited power of Mind.</p>  
 <p>Mind is creative, but it must have a</p>  
 <p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></a></p>  
 <p>model on which to work. It must have thoughts to supply the power.</p>  
 <p>There are in Universal Mind ideas for millions of wonders greater far than the "Seven Wonders of the World." And those ideas are just as available to you as they were to the artisans of old, as they were to Michael Angelo when he built St. Peter's in Rome, as they were to the architect who conceived the Woolworth Building, or the engineer who planned the Hell Gate bridge.</p>  
 <p>Every condition, every experience of life is the result of our mental attitude. We can <i>do</i> only what we think we can do. We can <i>be</i> only what we think we can be. We can <i>have</i> only what we think we can have. What we do, what we are, what we have, all depend upon what we think. We can never express anything that we do not first have in</p>  
 <p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></a></p>  
 <p>mind. The secret of all power, all success, all riches, is in first thinking powerful thoughts, successful thoughts, thoughts of wealth, of supply. We must build them in our own mind first.</p>  
 <p>William James, the famous psychologist, said that the greatest discovery in a hundred years was the discovery of the power of the sub-conscious mind. It is the greatest discovery of all time. It is the discovery that man has within himself the power to control his surroundings, that he is not at the mercy of chance or luck, that he is the arbiter of his own fortunes, that he can carve out his own destiny. He is the master of all the forces round about him. As James Allen puts it:</p>  
 <p>“Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so shall you become. Your vision is the promise of what you shall one</p>  
 <p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></a></p>  
 <p>day be; your Ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil.”</p>  
 <p>For matter is in the ultimate but a product of thought. Even the most material scientists admit that matter is not what it appears to be. According to physics, matter (be it the human body or a log of wood—it makes no difference which) is made up of an aggregation of distinct minute particles called atoms. Considered individually, these atoms are so small that they can be seen only with the aid of a powerful microscope, if at all.</p>  
 <p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Matter</span>—<br> <i>Dream or Reality?</i></p>  
 <p>Until recently these atoms were supposed to be the ultimate theory regarding matter. We ourselves—and all the material world around us—were supposed</p>  
 <p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></a></p>  
 <p>to consist of these infinitesimal particles of matter, so small that they could not be seen or weighed or smelled or touched individually—but still particles of matter <i>and indestructible</i>.</p>  
 <p>Now, however, these atoms have been further analyzed, and physics tells us that they are not indestructible at all—that they are mere positive and negative buttons of force or energy called protons and electrons, without hardness, without density, without solidity, without even positive actuality. In short, they are vortices in the ether—whirling bits of energy—dynamic, never static, pulsating with life, but the life is <i>spiritual!</i> As one eminent British scientist put it—"Science now explains matter by <i>explaining it away!</i>"</p>  
 <p>And that, mind you, is what the solid table in front of you is made of, is what</p>  
 <p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></a></p>  
 <p>your house, your body, the whole world is made of—<i>whirling bits of energy!</i></p>  
 <p>To quote the New York <i>Herald-Tribune</i> of March 11, 1926: "We used to believe that the universe was composed of an unknown number of different kinds of matter, one kind for each chemical element. The discovery of a new element had all the interest of the unexpected. It might turn out to be anything, to have any imaginable set of properties.</p>  
 <p>"That romantic prospect no longer exists. We know now that instead of many ultimate kinds of matter there are only two kinds. Both of these are really kinds of electricity. One is negative electricity, being, in fact, the tiny particle called the electron, familiar to radio fans as one of the particles vast swarms of which operate radio vacuum tubes.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> The other kind of electricity is positive electricity. Its ultimate particles are called protons. From these protons and electrons all of the chemical elements are built up. Iron and lead and oxygen and gold and all the others differ from one another merely in the number and arrangement of the electrons and protons which they contain. That is the modern idea of the nature of matter. <i>Matter is really nothing but electricity</i>."</p>  
 <p>Can you wonder then that scientists believe the time will come when mankind <i>through mind</i> can control all this energy, can be absolute master of the winds and the waves, can literally follow the Master's precept—"If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="green">p. 88</font></a></p>  
 <p>For Modern Science is coming more and more to the belief that what we call <i>matter is a force subject wholly to the control of mind</i>.</p>  
 <p>How tenuous matter really is, is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that a single violin string, tuned to the proper pitch, could start a vibration that would shake down the Brooklyn Bridge! Oceans and mountains, rocks and iron, all can be reduced to a point little short of the purely spiritual. Your body is 85 per cent water, 15 per cent ash and phosphorus! And they in turn can be dissipated into gas and vapor. Where do we go from there?</p>  
 <p>Is not the answer that, to a great degree at least, and perhaps altogether, this world round about us is one of our mind's own creating? And that we can put into it, and get from it, pretty much</p>  
 <p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="green">p. 89</font></a></p>  
 <p>what we wish? You see this illustrated every day. A panorama is spread before you. To you it is a beautiful picture; to another it appears a mere collection of rocks and trees. A girl comes out to meet you. To you she is the embodiment of loveliness; to another all that grace and beauty may look drab and homely. A moonlit garden, with its fragrant odors and dew-drenched grass, may mean all that is charming to you, while to another it brings only thoughts of asthma or fever or rheumatism. A color may be green to you that to another is red. A prospect may be inviting for you that to another is rugged and hard.</p>  
 <p>To quote "Applied Psychology," by Warren Hilton:</p>  
 <p>“The same stimulus acting on different organs of sense will produce different sensations. A blow upon the eye will</p>  
 <p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></a></p>  
 <p>cause you to 'see stars'; a similar blow upon the ear will cause you to hear an explosive sound. In other words, the vibratory effect of a touch on eye or ear is the same as that of light or sound vibrations.</p>  
 <p>“The notion you may form of any object in the outer world depends solely upon what part of your brain happens to be connected with that particular nerve-end that receives an impression from the object.</p>  
 <p>“You see the sun without being able to hear it because the only nerve-ends tuned to vibrate in harmony with the ether-waves set in action by the sun are nerve-ends that are connected with the brain center devoted to sight. ‘If,’ says Professor James, ‘we could splice the outer extremities of our optic nerves to our ears, and those of our auditory</p>  
 <p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></a></p>  
 <p>nerves to our eyes, we should hear the lightning and see the thunder, see the symphony and hear the conductor's movements.’</p>  
 <p>“In other words, the kind of impressions we receive from the world about us, the sort of mental pictures we form concerning it, in fact, the character of the outer world, the nature of the environment in which our lives are cast—all these things depend for each one of us simply upon how he happens to be put together, upon his individual mental make-up.”</p>  
 <p>In short, it all comes back to the old fable of the three blind men and the elephant. To the one who caught hold of his leg, the elephant was like a tree. To the one who felt of his side, the elephant was like a wall. To the one who seized his tail, the elephant was like a</p>  
 <p><a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="green">p. 92</font></a></p>  
 <p>rope. The world is to each one of us the world of <i>his individual perceptions</i>.</p>  
 <p>You are like a radio receiving station. Every moment thousands of impressions are reaching you. You can tune in on whatever ones you like—on joy or sorrow, on success or failure, on optimism or fear. You can select the particular impressions that will best serve you, you can hear only what you want to hear, you can shut out all disagreeable thoughts and sounds and experiences, or you can tune in on discouragement and failure and despair.</p>  
 <p>Yours is the choice. You have within you a force against which the whole world is powerless. By using it, you can make what you will of life and of your surroundings.</p>  
 <p>"But," you will say, "objects themselves do not change. It is merely the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="green">p. 93</font></a></p>  
 <p>difference in the way you look at them." Perhaps. But to a great extent, at least, we find what we look for; just as, when we turn the dial on the radio, we tune in on whatever kind of entertainment or instruction we may wish to hear. And who can say that it is not our thoughts that put it there? Who, for the matter of that, can prove that our surroundings in waking hours are not as much the creature of our minds as are our dreams? You've had dreams many a time where every object seemed just as real as when you were awake. You've felt of the objects, you've pinched yourself, yet still you were convinced that you were actually <i>living</i> those dreams. May not your waking existence be largely the creation of your own mind, just as your dream pictures are?</p>  
 <p>Many scientists believe that it is, and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="green">p. 94</font></a></p>  
 <p>that in proportion as you try to put into your surroundings the good things you desire, rather than the evil ones you fear, <i>you will find those good things</i>. Certain it is that you can do this with your own body. Just as certain that many people are doing it with the good things of life. They have risen above the conception of life in which matter is the master.</p>  
 <p>Just as the most powerful forces in nature are the invisible ones—heat, light, air, electricity—so the most powerful forces of man are his invisible forces, his thought forces. And just as electricity can fuse stone and iron, so can your thought forces control your body, so can they make or mar your destiny.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The Philosopher's Charm</i></p>  
 <p>There was once a shrewd necromancer who told a king that he had discovered</p>  
 <p><a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="green">p. 95</font></a></p>  
 <p>a way to make gold out of sand. Naturally the king was interested and offered him great rewards for his secret. The necromancer explained his process. It seemed quite easy, except for one thing. Not once during the operation must the king think of the word Abracadabra. If he did, the charm was broken and the gold would not come. The king tried and tried to follow the directions, but he could not keep that word Abracadabra out of his mind. And he never made the gold.</p>  
 <p>Dr. Winbigler puts the same idea in another way: "Inspiration, genius, power, are often interfered with by the conscious mind's interposing, by man's failing to recognize his power, afraid to assist himself, lacking the faith in himself necessary to stimulate the subconscious so as to arouse the genius asleep in each."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="green">p. 96</font></a></p>  
 <p>From childhood on we are assured on every hand—by scientists, by philosophers, by our religious teachers, that "ours is the earth and the fullness thereof." Beginning with the first chapter of Genesis, we are told that "God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth—and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." All through the Old and the New Testament, we are repeatedly adjured to use these God-given powers. "He that believeth on me," said Jesus, "the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do." "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you." "For verily I say</p>  
 <p><a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="green">p. 97</font></a></p>  
 <p>unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith." "The kingdom of God is within you."</p>  
 <p>We hear all this, perhaps we even think we believe, but always, when the time comes to use these God-given talents, there is the "doubt in our heart."</p>  
 <p>Baudouin expressed it clearly: “To be ambitious for wealth and yet always expecting to be poor; to be always doubting your ability to get what you long for, is like trying to reach east by travelling west. There is no philosophy which will help a man to succeed when he is always doubting his ability to do so, and thus attracting failure.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></a></p>  
 <p>“You will go in the direction in which you face.…</p>  
 <p>“There is a saying that every time the sheep bleats, it loses a mouthful of hay. Every time you allow yourself to complain of your lot, to say, 'I am poor; I can never do what others do; I shall never be rich; I have not the ability that others have; I am a failure; luck is against me;' you are laying up so much trouble for yourself.</p>  
 <p>“No matter how hard you may work for success, if your thought is saturated with the fear of failure, it will kill your efforts, neutralize your endeavors, and make success impossible.”</p>  
 <p>And that is responsible for all our failures. We are like the old lady who decided she wanted the hill behind her house removed. So she got down on her knees and prayed the good Lord to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="green">p. 99</font></a></p>  
 <p>remove it. The next morning she got up and hurried to the window. The hill was still in its same old place. "I knew it!" she snapped. "I gave Him his chance. But I knew all the time there was nothing to this prayer business."</p>  
 <p>Neither is there, as it is ordinarily done. Prayer is not a mere asking of favors. Prayer is not a pæan of praise. Rather prayer is a realization of the God-power within you—of your right of dominion over your own body, your environment, your business, your health, your prosperity. It is an understanding that you are "heir of God and co-heir with Christ." And that as such, no evil has power over you, whereas you have all power for good. And "good" means not merely holiness. Good means happiness—the happiness of everyday people. Good means everything that is good in</p>  
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="green">p. 100</font></a></p>  
 <p>this world of ours—comforts and pleasures and prosperity for ourselves, health and happiness for those dependent upon us. There are no limits to "Good" except those we put upon it ourselves.</p>  
 <p>What was it made Napoleon the greatest conqueror of his day? Primarily his magnificent faith in Napoleon. He had a sublime belief in his destiny, an absolute confidence that the obstacle was not made which Napoleon could not find a way through, or over, or around. It was only when he lost that confidence, when he hesitated and vacillated for weeks between retreat and advance, that winter caught him in Moscow and ended his dreams of world empire. Fate gave him every chance first. The winter snows were a full month late in coming. But Napoleon hesitated—and was lost. It was not the snows that defeated him. It</p>  
 <p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="green">p. 101</font></a></p>  
 <p>was not the Russians. It was his loss of faith in himself.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The Kingdom of Heaven</i></p>  
 <p>"The Kingdom of Heaven is within you." Heaven is not some far-away state—the reward of years of tribulation here. Heaven is right here—here and now! When Christ said that Heaven was within us, He meant just what He said—that the power for happiness, for good, for everything we need of life, is within each one of us.</p>  
 <p>That most of us fail to realize this Heaven—that many are sickly and suffering, that more are ground down by poverty and worry—is no fault of His. He gave us the power to overcome these evils; He stands ready and waiting to help us use it. If we fail to find the way, the fault is ours. To enjoy the Heaven</p>  
 <p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="green">p. 102</font></a></p>  
 <p>that is within us, to begin here and now to live the life eternal, takes only a fuller understanding of the Power-that-is-within-us.</p>  
 <p>Even now, with the limited knowledge at our command, we can control circumstances to the point of making the world without an expression of our own world within, where the real thoughts, the real power, resides. Through this world within you can find the solution of every problem, the cause for every effect. Discover it—and all power, all possession is within your control.</p>  
 <p>For the world without is but a reflection of that world within. Your thought creates the conditions your mind images. Keep before your mind's eye the image of all you want to be and you will see it reflected in the world without. Think abundance, feel abundance, BELIEVE</p>  
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="green">p. 103</font></a></p>  
 <p>abundance, and you will find that as you think and feel and believe, abundance will manifest itself in your daily life. But let fear and worry be your mental companions, thoughts of poverty and limitation dwell in your mind, and worry and fear, limitation and poverty will be your constant companions day and night.</p>  
 <p>Your mental concept is all that matters. Its relation to matter is that of idea and form. There has got to be an idea before it can take form. As Dr. Terry Walter says:</p>  
 <p>“The impressions that enter the subconscious form indelible pictures, which are never forgotten, and whose power can change the body, mind, manner, and morals; can, in fact, revolutionize a personality.</p>  
 <p>“All during our waking hours the conscious mind, through the five senses, acts</p>  
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="green">p. 104</font></a></p>  
 <p>as constant feeder to the subconscious; the senses are the temporal source of supply for the content of the soul mind; therefore it is most important that we know and realize definitely and explicitly that every time we think a thought or feel an emotion, we are adding to the content of this powerful mind, good or bad, as the case may be. Life will be richer or poorer for the thoughts and deeds of today.”</p>  
 <p>Your thoughts supply you with limitless energy which will take whatever form your mind demands. The thoughts are the mold which crystalizes this energy into good or ill according to the form you impress upon it. You are free to choose which. But whichever you choose, the result is sure. Thoughts of wealth, of power, of success, can bring only results commensurate with your</p>  
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>idea of them. Thoughts of poverty and lack can bring only limitation and trouble.</p>  
 <p>"A radical doctrine," you'll say, and think me wildly optimistic. Because the world has been taught for so long to think that some must be rich and some poor, that trials and tribulations are our lot. That this is at best a vale of tears.</p>  
 <p>The history of the race shows that what is considered to be the learning of one age is ignorance to the next age.</p>  
 <p>Dr. Edwin E. Slosson, Editor of <i>Science Service</i>, speaking of the popular tendency to fight against new ideas merely because they were new, said: "All through the history of science, we find that new ideas have to force their way into the common mind in disguise, as though they were burglars instead of benefactors of the race."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="green">p. 106</font></a></p>  
 <p>And Emerson wrote: "The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs."</p>  
 <p>In the ages to come man will look back upon the poverty and wretchedness of so many millions today, and think how foolish we were not to take advantage of the abundance all about us. Look at Nature; how profuse she is in everything. Do you suppose the Mind that imaged that profuseness ever intended you to be limited, to have to scrimp and save in order to eke out a bare existence?</p>  
 <p>There are hundreds of millions of stars in the heavens. Do you suppose the Mind which could bring into being worlds without number in such prodigality intended to stint you of the few things necessary to your happiness?</p>  
 <p>What is money but a mere idea of</p>  
 <p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 107</font></a></p>  
 <p>mind, a token of exchange? The paper money you have in your pockets is supposed to represent so much gold or silver currency. There are billions upon billions of this paper money in circulation, yet all the gold in the world amounts to only about $8,000,000,000. Wealth is in ideas, not in money or property. You can control those ideas through mind.</p>  
 <p>Reduced to the ultimate—to the atom or to the electron—everything in this world is an idea of mind. All of it has been brought together through mind. If we can change the things we want back into mental images, we can multiply them as often as we like, possess all that we like.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>“To Him That Hath”</i>—</p>  
 <p>Take as an example the science of numbers. Suppose all numbers were of</p>  
 <p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="green">p. 108</font></a></p>  
 <p>metal—that it was against the law to write figures for ourselves. Every time you wanted to do a sum in arithmetic you'd have to provide yourself with a supply of numbers, arrange them in their proper order, work out your problems with them. If your problems were too abstruse you might run out of numbers, have to borrow some from your neighbor or from the bank.</p>  
 <p>"How ridiculous," you say. "Figures are not things; they are mere ideas, and we can add them or divide them or multiply them or subtract them as often as we like. Anybody can have all the figures he wants."</p>  
 <p>To be sure he can. And when you get to look upon money in the same way, you will have all the money you want.</p>  
 <p>"To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be taken</p>  
 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></a></p>  
 <p>away even that which he hath." To him that hath the right idea everything shall be given, and from him who hath not that right idea shall be taken away everything he hath.</p>  
 <p>Thought externalizes itself. What we are depends entirely upon the images we hold before our mind's eye. Every time we think, we start a chain of causes which will create conditions similar to the thoughts which originated it. Every thought we hold in our consciousness for any length of time becomes impressed upon our subconscious mind and creates a pattern which the mind weaves into our life or environment.</p>  
 <p>All power is from within and is therefore under our own control. When you can direct your thought processes, you can consciously apply them to any condition, for all that comes to us from the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></a></p>  
 <p>world without is what we've already imaged in the world within.</p>  
 <p>Do you want more money? Sit you down now quietly and realize that money is merely an idea. That your mind is possessed of unlimited ideas. That being part of Universal Mind, there is no such thing as limitation or lack. That somewhere, somehow, the ideas that shall bring you all the money you need for any right purpose are available for you. That you have but to put it up to your subconscious mind to find these ideas.</p>  
 <p>Realize that—<i>believe</i> it—and your need will be met. "What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive it and ye shall have it." Don't forget that "<i>believe that ye receive it</i>." This it is that images the thing you want on your subconscious mind. And this it is that brings it to you. Once you can</p>  
 <p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></a></p>  
 <p>image the belief clearly on your subconscious mind, "whatsoever it is that ye ask for…ye shall have it."</p>  
 <p>For the source of all good, of everything you wish for, is the Universal Mind, and you can reach it only through the subconscious.</p>  
 <p>And Universal Mind will be to you whatever you believe it to be—the kind and loving Father whom Jesus pictured, always looking out for the well-being of his children—or the dread Judge that so many dogmatists would have us think.</p>  
 <p>When a man realizes that his mind is part of Universal Mind, when he realizes that he has only to take any right aspiration to this Universal Mind to see it realized, he loses all sense of worry and fear. He learns to dominate instead of to cringe. He rises to meet every situation, secure in the knowledge that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></a></p>  
 <p>everything necessary to the solution of any problem is in Mind, and that he has but to take his problem to Universal Mind to have it correctly answered.</p>  
 <p>For if you take a drop of water from the ocean, you know that it has the same properties as all the rest of the water in the ocean, the same percentage of sodium chloride. The only difference between it and the ocean is in volume. If you take a spark of electricity, you know that it has the same properties as the thunderbolt, the same power that moves trains or runs giant machines in factories. Again the only difference is in volume. It is the same with your mind and Universal Mind. The only difference between them is in volume. Your mind has the same properties as the Universal Mind, the same creative genius, the same power over all the earth, the same access to all</p>  
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></a></p>  
 <p>knowledge. Know this, believe it, use it, and "yours is the earth and the fulness thereof." In the exact proportion that you believe yourself to be part of Universal Mind, sharing in Its all-power, in that proportion can you demonstrate the mastery over your own body and over the world about you.</p>  
 <p>All growth, all supply is from the world-within. If you would have power, if you would have wealth, you have but to image it on this world within, on your subconscious mind, through belief and understanding.</p>  
 <p>If you would remove discord, you have but to remove the wrong images—images of ill health, of worry and trouble from within. The trouble with most of us is that we live entirely in the world without. We have no knowledge of that inner world which is responsible for all</p>  
 <p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></a></p>  
 <p>the conditions we meet and all the experiences we have. We have no conception of "the Father that is within us."</p>  
 <p>The inner world promises us life and health, prosperity and happiness—dominion over all the earth. It promises peace and perfection for all its offspring. It gives you the right way and the adequate way to accomplish any normal purpose. Business, labor, professions, exist primarily in thought. And the outcome of your labors in them is regulated by thought. Consider the difference, then, in this outcome if you have at your command only the limited capacity of your conscious mind, compared with the boundless energy of the subconscious and the Universal Mind. "Thought, not money, is the real business capital," says Harvey S. Firestone, "and if you know absolutely that what you are doing is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></a></p>  
 <p>right, then you are bound to accomplish it in due season."</p>  
 <p>Thought is a dynamic energy with the .power to bring its object out from the invisible substance all about us. Matter is inert, unintelligent. Thought can shape and control. Every form in which matter is today is but the expression of some thought, some desire, some idea.</p>  
 <p>You have a mind. You can originate thought. And thoughts are creative. Therefore you can create for yourself that which you desire. Once you realize this you are taking a long step toward success in whatever undertaking you have in mind.</p>  
 <p>More than half the prophecies in the Scriptures refer to the time when man shall possess the earth, when tears and sorrow shall be unknown, and peace and plenty shall be everywhere. That time</p>  
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></a></p>  
 <p>will come. It is nearer than most people think possible. You are helping it along. Every man who is honestly trying to use the power of mind in the right way is doing his part in the great cause. For it is only through Mind that peace and plenty can be gained. The earth is laden with treasures as yet undiscovered. But they are every one of them known to Universal Mind, for it was Universal Mind that first imaged them there. And as part of Universal Mind, they can be known to you.</p>  
 <p>How else did the Prophets of old foretell, thousands of years ago, the aeroplane, the cannon, the radio? What was the genius that enabled Ezekiel to argue from his potter's wheel, his water wheel and the stroke of the lightning to an airplane, with its wheels within wheels, driven by electricity and guided</p>  
 <p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="green">p. 117</font></a></p>  
 <p>by man? How are we to explain the descriptions of artillery in the Apocalypse and the astonishing declaration in the Gospels that the utterances of the chamber would be broadcast from the housetops?</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>“To the Manner Born”</i></p>  
 <p>Few of us have any idea of our mental powers. The old idea was that man must take this world as he found it. He'd been born into a certain position in life, and to try to rise above his fellows was not only the height of bad taste, but sacrilegious as well. An All wise Providence had decreed by birth the position a child should occupy in the web of organized society. For him to be discontented with his lot, for him to attempt to raise himself to a higher level, was tantamount to tempting Providence. The gates of Hell</p>  
 <p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="green">p. 118</font></a></p>  
 <p>yawned wide for such scatterbrains, who were lucky if in this life they incurred nothing worse than the ribald scorn of their associates.</p>  
 <p>That is the system that produced aristocracy and feudalism. That is the system that feudalism and aristocracy strove to perpetuate.</p>  
 <p>The new idea—the basis of all democracies—is that man is not bound by any system, that he need not accept the world as he finds it. He can remake the world to his own ideas. It is merely the raw material. He can make what he wills of it.</p>  
 <p>It is this new idea that is responsible for all our inventions, all our progress. Man is satisfied with nothing. He is constantly remaking his world. And now more than ever will this be true, for psychology teaches us that each one has</p>  
 <p><a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 119</font></a></p>  
 <p>within himself the power to become what he wills.</p>  
 <p><i>Learn to control your thought</i>. Learn to image upon your mind only the things you want to see reflected there.</p>  
 <p>You will never improve yourself by dwelling upon the drawbacks of your neighbors. You will never attain perfect health and strength by thinking of weakness or disease. No man ever made a perfect score by watching his rival's target. You have got to think strength, think health, think riches. To paraphrase Pascal—"Our achievements today are but the sum of our thoughts of yesterday."</p>  
 <p>For thought is energy. Mental images are concentrated energy. And energy concentrated on any definite purpose becomes power. To those who perceive the nature and transcendency of this</p>  
 <p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></a></p>  
 <p>force, all physical power sinks into insignificance.</p>  
 <p>What is imagination but a form of thought? Yet it is the instrument by which all the inventors and discoverers have opened the way to new worlds. Those who grasp this force, be their state ever so humble, their natural gifts ever so insignificant, become our leading men. They are our governors and supreme law-givers, the guides of the drifting host which follows them as by an irrevocable decree. To quote Glenn Clark in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, “Whatever we have of civilization is their work, theirs alone. If progress was made they made it. If spiritual facts were discerned, they discerned them. If justice and order were put in place of insolence and chaos, they wrought the change. Never is progress achieved by</p>  
 <p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></a></p>  
 <p>the masses. Creation ever remains the task of the individual.”</p>  
 <p>Our railroads, our telephones, our automobiles, our libraries, our newspapers, our thousands of other conveniences, comforts and necessities are due to the creative genius of but two per cent of our population.</p>  
 <p>And the same two per cent own a great percentage of the wealth of the country.</p>  
 <p>The question arises, Who are they? What are they? The sons of the rich? College men? No—few of them had any early advantages. Many of them have never seen the inside of a college. It was grim necessity that drove them, and somehow, some way, they found a method of drawing upon their Genie-of-the-Mind, and through that inner force they have reached success.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="green">p. 122</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>You</i> don't need to stumble and grope. You can call upon your inner forces at will. There are three steps necessary:</p>  
 <p>First, to realize that you have the power;</p>  
 <p>Second, to know what you want.</p>  
 <p>Third, to center your thought upon it with singleness of purpose.</p>  
 <p>To accomplish these steps takes only a fuller understanding of the Power-that-is-within-you.</p>  
 <p>But what is this power? Where should you go to locate it? Is it a thing, a place, an object? Has it bounds, form or material shape? No! Then how shall you go about finding it?</p>  
 <p>If you have begun to <i>realize</i> that there is a power within you, if you have begun to arouse in your conscious mind the ambition and desire to use this power—you have started in the pathway of Wisdom.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> If you are willing to go forward, to endure the mental discipline of mastering this method, nothing in the world can hinder you or keep you from overcoming every obstacle.</p>  
 <p>Begin at once, today, to use what you have learned. All growth comes from practice. All the forces of life are active—peace—joy—power. The unused talent decays. Open the door</p>  
 <p>"Behold I stand at the door and knock; if ANY MAN hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him and he with me."</p>  
 <p>So let us make use of this dynamo, which is <i>you</i>. What is going to start it working? Your <i>Faith</i>, the faith that is begotten of understanding. Faith is the impulsion, the propulsion of this power within. Faith is the confidence, the assurance,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></a></p>  
 <p>the enforcing truth, the knowing that the right idea of life will bring you into the reality of existence and the manifestation of the All power.</p>  
 <p>All cause is in Mind—and Mind is everywhere. All the knowledge there is, all the wisdom there is, all the power there is, is all about you—no matter where you may be. Your Mind is part of it. You have access to it. If you fail to avail yourself of it, you have no one to blame but yourself. For, as the drop of water in the ocean shares in all the properties of the rest of the ocean water so you share in that all-power, all-wisdom of Mind. If you have been sick and ailing, if poverty and hardship have been your lot, don't blame it on "fate." Blame yourself. "Yours is the earth and everything that's in it." But you've got to <i>take</i> it. The power is there—but <i>you</i> </p>  
 <p><a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="green">p. 125</font></a></p>  
 <p>must use it. It is round about you like the air you breathe. You don't expect others to do your breathing for you. Neither can you expect them to use your Mind for you. Universal Intelligence is not only the mind of the Creator of the universe, but it is also the mind of MAN, <i>your</i> intelligence, <i>your</i> mind. "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus!"</p>  
 <p>So start today by KNOWING that you can do anything you wish to do, have anything you wish to have, be anything you wish to be. The rest will follow.</p>  
 <p>"Ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you."</p>
