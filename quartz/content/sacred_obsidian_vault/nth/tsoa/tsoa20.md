 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%"><div style="font-size: 90%;">For life is the mirror of king and slave.<br>   ’Tis just what you are and do;<br> Then give to the world the best you have,<br>   And the best will come back to you.<br>                 —<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Madeline Bridges</span>.</div></div>

 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/tinit.jpg" align="LEFT"></td></tr></table><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> old adage that "He profits most who serves best" is no mere altruism.  
 <p>Look around you. What businesses are going ahead? What men are making the big successes? Are they the ones who grab the passing dollar, careless of what they offer in return? Or are they those who are striving always to give a little greater value, a little more work than they are paid for?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="green">p. 306</font></a></p>  
 <p>When scales are balanced evenly, a trifle of extra weight thrown into either side overbalances the other as effectively as a ton.</p>  
 <p>In the same way, a little better value, a little extra effort, makes the man or the business stand out from the great mass of mediocrity like a tall man among pigmies, and brings results out of all proportion to the additional effort involved.</p>  
 <p>It pays—not merely altruistically, but in good, hard, round dollars—to give a little more value than seems necessary, to work a bit harder than you are paid for. It's that extra ounce of value that counts.</p>  
 <p>For the law of attraction is service. We receive in proportion as we give out. In fact, we usually receive in far greater proportion. "Cast thy bread upon the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_307"><font size="1" color="green">p. 307</font></a></p>  
 <p>waters and it will return to you an hundred-fold."</p>  
 <p>Back of (everything is the immutable law of the Universe—that what you are is but the effect. Your thoughts are the causes. The only way you can change the effect is by first changing the cause.</p>  
 <p>People live in poverty and want because they are so wrapped up in their sufferings that they give out thoughts only of lack and sorrow. They expect want. They open the door of their mind only to hardship and sickness and poverty. True—they hope for something better—but their hopes are so drowned by their fears that they never have a chance.</p>  
 <p>You cannot receive good while expecting evil. You cannot demonstrate plenty while looking for poverty. "Blessed is he that expecteth much, for verily his</p>  
 <p><a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="green">p. 308</font></a></p>  
 <p>soul shall be filled." Solomon outlined the law when he said:</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%"><div style="font-size: 90%;">"There is that scattereth, and increaseth yet more;<br>  And there is that withholdeth more than is meet,<br>     but it tendeth only to want.<br>  The liberal soul shall be made fat;<br>  And he that watereth shall be watered also himself."</div></div>  
 <p>The Universal Mind expresses itself largely through the individual. It is continually seeking an outlet. It is like a vast reservoir of water, constantly replenished by mountain sp rings. Cut a channel to it and the water will flow in ever-increasing volume. In the same way, if you once open up a channel of service by which the Universal Mind can express itself through you, its gifts will flow in ever-increasing volume and YOU will be enriched in the process.</p>  
 <p>This is the idea through which great</p>  
 <p><a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="green">p. 309</font></a></p>  
 <p>bankers are made. A foreign country needs millions for development. Its people are hard-working, but lack the necessary implements to make their work productive. How are they to find the money?</p>  
 <p>They go to a banker—put their problem up to him. He has not the money himself, but he knows how and where to raise it. He sells the promise to pay of the foreign country (their bonds, in other words) to people who have money to invest. His is merely a service. But it is such an invaluable service that both sides are glad to pay him liberally for it.</p>  
 <p>In the same way, by opening up a channel between universal supply and human needs—by doing your neighbors or your friends or your customers service—you are bound to profit yourself. And the wider you open your channel-</p>  
 <p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="green">p. 310</font></a></p>  
 <p>the greater service you give or the better values you offer—the more things are bound to flow through your channel, the more you are going to profit thereby.</p>  
 <p>But you've got to <i>use</i> your talent if you want to profit from it. It matters not how small your service—using it will make it greater. You don't have to retire to a cell and pray. That is a selfish method—selfish concern for your own soul to the exclusion of all others. Mere self-denial or asceticism as such does no one good. You've got to DO something, to USE the talents God has given you to make the world better for your having been in it.</p>  
 <p>Remember the parable of the talents. You know what happened to the man who went off and hid his talent, whereas those who made use of theirs were given charge over many things.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="green">p. 311</font></a></p>  
 <p>That parable, it has always seemed to me, expresses the whole law of life. The only right is to <i>use</i> all the forces of good. The only wrong is to <i>neglect</i> or to abuse them.</p>  
 <p>"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God. This is the first and the greatest Commandment." Thou shalt show thy love by using to the best possible advantage the good things (the "talents" of the par-able) that He has placed in your hands. "And the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Thou shalt not abuse the good things that have been provided you in such prodigality, by using them against your neighbor. Instead, thou shalt treat him (love him) as you would be treated by him. Thou shalt use the good about you for the advantage of all.</p>  
 <p>If you are a banker, you've got to use</p>  
 <p><a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="green">p. 312</font></a></p>  
 <p>the money you have in order to make more money. If you are a merchant, you've got to sell the goods you have in order to buy more goods. If you are a doctor, you must help the patient you have in order to get more practice. If you are a clerk, you must do your work a little better than those around you if you want to earn more money than they. And if you want more of the universal supply, you must use that which you have in such a way as to make yourself of greater service to those around you.</p>  
 <p>"Whosoever shall be great among you," said Jesus, "shall be your minister, and whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all." In other words, if you would be great, you must serve. And he who serves most shall be greatest of all.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="green">p. 313</font></a></p>  
 <p>If you want to make more money, instead of seeking it for yourself, see how you can make more for others. In the process you will inevitably make more for yourself, too. We get as we give—but we must give first.</p>  
 <p>It matters not where 'you Start you may be a day laborer. But still you can give—give a bit more of energy, of work, of thought, than you are paid for. "Whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile," said Jesus, "go with him twain." Try to put a little extra skill into your work. Use your mind to find some better way of doing whatever task may be set for you. It won't be long before you are out of the common labor class.</p>  
 <p>There is no kind of work than can-not be bettered by thought. There is no method that cannot be improved by</p>  
 <p><a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="green">p. 314</font></a></p>  
 <p>thought. So give generously of your thought to your work. Think every minute you are at it—"Isn't there some way in which this could be done easier, quicker, better?" Read in your spare time everything that relates to your own work or to the job ahead of you. In these days of magazines and books and libraries, few are the occupations that are not thoroughly covered in some good work.</p>  
 <p>Remember in Lorimer's "Letters of a Self-Made Merchant to His Son," the young fellow that old Gorgan Graham hired against his better judgment and put in the "barrel gang" just to get rid of him quickly? Before the month was out the young fellow had thought himself out of that job by persuading the boss to get a machine that did the work at half the cost and with a third of the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="green">p. 315</font></a></p>  
 <p>gang. Graham just had to raise his pay and put him higher up. But he wouldn't stay put. No matter what the job, he always found some way it could be done better and with fewer people. Until he reached the top of the ladder.</p>  
 <p>There are plenty of men like that in actual life. They won't stay down. They are as full of bounce as a cat with a small boy and a dog after it. Thrown to the dog from an upper window, it is using the time of falling to get set for the next jump. By the time the dog leaps for where it hit, the cat is up the tree across the street.</p>  
 <p>The true spirit of business is the spirit of that plucky old Danish sea captain, Peter Tordenskjold. Attacked by a Swedish frigate, after all his crew but one had been killed and his supply of cannon balls was exhausted, Peter boldly</p>  
 <p><a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="green">p. 316</font></a></p>  
 <p>kept up the fight, firing pewter dinner-plates and mugs from his one remaining gun.</p>  
 <p>One of the pewter mugs hit the Swedish captain and killed him, and Peter sailed off triumphant!</p>  
 <p>Look around YOU now. How can YOU give greater value for what you get? How can you SERVE better? How can you make more money for your employers or save more for your customers. Keep that thought ever in the forefront of your mind and <i>you'll never need to worry about making more for yourself!</i></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>A Blank Check</i></p>  
 <p>There was an article by Gardner Hunting in a recent issue of "Christian Business," that was so good that I reprint it here entire:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="green">p. 317</font></a></p>  
 <p>"All my life I have known in a vague way that getting money is the result of earning it; but I have never had a perfect vision of that truth till recently. Summed up now, the result of all my experience, pleasant and unpleasant, is that a man gets back exactly what he gives out, only multiplied.</p>  
 <p>"If I give to anybody service of a kind that he wants I shall get back the benefit myself. If I give more service I shall get more benefit. If I give a great deal more, I shall get a great deal more. But I shall get back more than I give. Exactly as when I plant a bushel of potatoes, I get back thirty or forty bushels, and more in proportion to the attention I give the growing crop. If I give more to my employer than he expects of me, he will give me a raise—and on no other condition. What is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="green">p. 318</font></a></p>  
 <p>more, his giving me a raise does not depend on his fair-mindedness—he has to give it to me or lose me, because if he does not appreciate me somebody else will.</p>  
 <p>"But this is only part of it. If I give help to the man whose desk is next to mine, it will come back to me multiplied, even if he apparently is a rival. What I give to him, I give to the firm, and the firm will value it, because it is team-work in the organization that the firm primarily wants, not brilliant individual performance. If I have an enemy in the organization, the same rule holds; if I give him, with the purpose of helping him, something that will genuinely help him, I am giving service to the organization. Great corporations appreciate the peace-maker, for a prime requisite in their success is harmony</p>  
 <p><a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="green">p. 319</font></a></p>  
 <p>among employees. If my boss is unappreciative, the same rule holds; if I give him more, in advance of appreciation, he cannot withhold his appreciation and keep his own job.</p>  
 <p>"The more you think about this law, the deeper you will see it goes. It literally hands you a blank check, signed by the Maker of Universal Law, and leaves you to fill in the amount—and the kind—of payment you want! Mediocre successes are those that obey this law a little way—that fill in the check with a small amount—but that stop short of big vision in it. If every employee would only get the idea of this law firmly fixed in him as a principle, not subject to wavering with fluctuating moods, the success of the organization would be miraculous. One of my fears is apt to be that, by promoting the other fellow's</p>  
 <p><a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="green">p. 320</font></a></p>  
 <p>success, I am side-tracking my own; but the exact opposite is the truth.</p>  
 <p>"Suppose every employee would look at his own case as an exact parallel to that of his firm. What does his firm give for the money it gets from the public? Service! Service in advance! The better the service that is given out, the more money comes back. What does the firm do to bring public attention w its service? It advertises; that is part of the service. Now, suppose that I, as an employee, begin giving my service to the firm in advance of all hoped for payment. Suppose I advertise my service. How do I do either? I cannot do anything constructive in that firm's office or store or plant or premises that is not service, from filing a letter correctly to mending the fence or pleasing a customer; from looking up a word for the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="green">p. 321</font></a></p>  
 <p>stenographer, to encouraging her to look it up herself; demonstrating a machine to a customer or encouraging him to demonstrate it himself; from helping my immediate apparent rival to get a raise, to selling the whole season's output. As for advertising myself, I begin advertising myself the moment I walk into the office or the store or the shop in the morning; I cannot help it. Everybody who looks at me sees my advertisement. Everybody around me has my advertisement before his eyes all day long. So has the boss—my immediate chief and the head of the firm, no matter where they are. And if I live up to my advertising, nobody can stop me from selling my goods—my services! The more a man knocks me, the more he advertises me; because he calls attention to me; and if I am delivering</p>  
 <p><a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="green">p. 322</font></a></p>  
 <p>something better than he says I am, the interested parties—my employers—will see it, and will not be otherwise influenced by what he says.</p>  
 <p>"More than that, I must give to every human being I come in contact with, from my wife to the bootblack who shines my shoes; from my brother to my sworn foe. Sometimes people will tell you to smile; but the smile I give has got to be a real smile that lives up to its advertising. If I go around grinning like a Cheshire cat, the Cheshire-cat grin will be what I get back—multiplied! If I give the real thing, I'll get back the real thing—multiplied! If anybody objects that this is a selfish view to take, I answer him that any law of salvation from anything by anybody that has ever been offered for any purpose, is a selfish view to take. The only</p>  
 <p><a name="page_323"><font size="1" color="green">p. 323</font></a></p>  
 <p>unselfishness that has ever been truly taught is that of giving a lesser thing in hope of receiving a greater.</p>  
 <p>"Now, why am I so sure of this law? How can you be sure? I have watched it work; it works everywhere. You have only to try it, and keep on trying it and it will prove true for you. It is not true because I say so, nor because anybody else says so; it is just true. Theosophists call it the law of Karma; humanitarians call it the law of Service; business men call it the law of common sense; Jesus Christ called it the law of Love. It rules whether I know it or not, whether I believe it or not, whether I defy it or not. I <i>can't</i> break it! Jesus of Nazareth, without reference to any religious idea you may have about Him, without consideration as to whether He was or was not divine, was the greatest business Man</p>  
 <p><a name="page_324"><font size="1" color="green">p. 324</font></a></p>  
 <p>that ever lived, and he said: 'Give and ye shall receive—good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over!' And this happens to be so—not because He said it—but because it is the Truth, which we all, whether we admit it or not, worship <i>as</i> God. No man can honestly say that he does not put the truth supreme.</p>  
 <p>"It is the truth—the principle of giving and receiving—only there are few men who go the limit on it. But going the limit is the way to unlimited returns!</p>  
 <p>"What shall I give? What I have, of course. Suppose you believe in this idea—and suppose you should start giving it out, the idea itself, tactfully, wisely, and living it yourself in your organization. How long do you think it will be before you are a power in that organization, recognized as such and getting pay as</p>  
 <p><a name="page_325"><font size="1" color="green">p. 325</font></a></p>  
 <p>such? It is more valuable than all the cleverness and special information you can possibly possess without it. What you have, give—to everybody. If you have an idea, do not save it for your own use only; give it. It is the best thing you have to give and therefore the thing best to give—and therefore the thing that will bring the best back to you. I believe that if a man would follow this principle, even to his trade-secrets, he would profit steadily more and more; and more certainly than he will by holding on to anything for himself. He would never have to worry about his own affairs—because he would be working on fundamental Law. Law never fails—and it will be easy for you to discover what is or is not law. And if law is worth using part of the time, it is worth using all the time.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_326"><font size="1" color="green">p. 326</font></a></p>  
 <p>"Look around you first, with an eye to seeing the truth, and then put the thing to the test. Through both methods of investigation you will find a blank check waiting for you to fill in with 'whatsoever you desire,' and a new way to pray and to get what you pray for."</p>
