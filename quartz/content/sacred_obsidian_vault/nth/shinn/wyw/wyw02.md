 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Your Word is Your Wand</i>, by Florence Scovel Shinn, [1928], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  
 <p></p>  <h3 align="center">SUCCESS</h3>  
 <p>There are certain words or pictures which impress the subconscious mind.</p>  
 <p>For example: A man called asking me to speak the word for his right work.</p>  
 <p>I gave him the statement: "Behold I have set before thee the open door of destiny and no man shall shut it!"</p>  
 <p>It didn't seem to make much impression, so I was inspired to add: "And no man shall shut it for it is <i>nailed back!</i>"</p>  
 <p>The man was electrified and went out walking on air. Within a few weeks he was called to a distant city to fill a wonderful position which came about in a miraculous way.</p>  
 <p>I give another example of a woman who fearlessly followed a "hunch."</p>  
 <p>She was working for a small salary when she read my book, <i>The Game of Life and How to Play It</i>. The thought came in a flash, to start in business for herself and open a Tearoom and Candy Shop.</p>  
 <p>The idea staggered her at first, but it persisted, so she boldly went forth and procured a shop and assistants. </p>  
 <p>She "spoke the word for supply," for she did not have money to back her enterprise. It came in miraculous ways, and the shop opened!</p>  
 <p>From the first day it was filled with people, and now it is "crammed jammed"; they stand in line and wait.</p>  
 <p>One day, being a holiday, her assistants became gloomy and said they could not expect to do much business. My student, however, replied that God was her supply and every day was a good day.</p>  
 <p>In the afternoon an old friend came in to see the shop and bought a two pound box of candy. He gave her a check and when she looked at it she found it was for a hundred dollars. So it was indeed a good day! One hundred dollars for a box of candy!</p>  
 <p>She says every morning she enters the shop with wonder and gives thanks that she had the fearless faith that wins!</p>  
 <p></p>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATIONS</h4>  
 <p>The decks are now cleared for Divine Action and my own comes to me under grace in a magical way.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>

 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>I make friends with hindrances and every obstacle becomes a stepping-stone. Every-thing in the Universe, visible and invisible, is working to bring to me my own.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>I give thanks that the walls of Jericho fall down and all lack, limitation and failure are wiped out of my consciousness in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>I am now on the royal road of Success, Happiness and Abundance, all the traffic goes my way.</p>

 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>I do not limit God by seeing limitation in myself. With God and myself all things are possible.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Giving precedes receiving and my gifts to others precede God's gifts to me. </p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>Every man is a golden link in the chain of my good.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>My poise is built upon a rock. I see clearly and act quickly.</p>  
 <p align="center"></p>  
 <p>God cannot fail, so I cannot fail. "The warrior within me" has already won.</p>
