 <p></p><div style="font-size: 90%">THIS Part explains how we may come into possession of power sufficient to meet every situation which may arise in life. It explains that the ability to eliminate imperfect conditions depends upon mental action. It explains that great ideas have a tendency to eliminate smaller ideas, so that it is well to hold ideas which are large enough to counteract and destroy all small or undesirable tendencies. This is one of the secrets of success, one of the accomplishments of the Master Mind. It explains that the creative energy finds no more difficulty in handling a large situation than a small one. It explains how conditions are produced in our lives by the predominant thoughts which we entertain. It explains how you may set causes in motion which will create an irresistible magnetic power which will bring the things you require to you. It explains the issue between the old regime and the new, it explains the crux of the social problem, it explains the true secret of health, wealth and power.</div>  
 <p><a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="green">p. 268</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">INTRODUCTION. PART TWENTY-ONE</h4>  
 <p>In paragraph seven of this Part you will find that one of the secrets of success, one of the methods of organizing victory, one of the accomplishments of the Master Mind is to think big thoughts.</p>  
 <p>In paragraph eight you will find that everything which we hold in our consciousness for any length of time becomes impressed upon our subconsciousness and so becomes a pattern which the creative energy will weave into our life and environment. This is the secret of the wonderful power of prayer.</p>  
 <p>We know that the universe is governed by law; that for every effect there must be a cause, and that the same cause, under the same conditions, will invariably produce the same effect. Consequently, if prayer has ever been answered, it will always be answered, if the proper conditions are complied with. This must necessarily be true; otherwise the Universe would be a chaos instead of a cosmos. The answer to prayer is therefore subject to law, and this law is definite, exact and scientific, just as are the laws governing gravitation and electricity. An understanding of this law takes the foundation of Christianity out of the realm of superstition and credulity and places it upon the firm rock of scientific understanding.</p>  
 <p>But, unfortunately, there are comparatively few persons who know how to pray. They understand that there are laws governing electricity, mathematics and chemistry, but, for some inexplicable reason, it never seems to occur to them that there are also spiritual laws, and that these laws are also definite, scientific, exact, and operate with immutable precision.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="green">p. 269</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">PART TWENTY-ONE</h4>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:1">XXI, 1</a></font></span>1. The real secret of power is consciousness of power. The Universal Mind is unconditional; therefore, the more conscious we become of our unity with this mind, the less conscious we shall become of conditions and limitations, and as we become emancipated or freed from conditions we come into a realization of the unconditional. We have become free!</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:2">XXI, 2</a></font></span>2. As soon as we become conscious of the inexhaustible power in the world within, we begin to draw on this power and apply and develop the greater possibilities which this discernment has realized, because whatever we become conscious of, is invariably manifested in the objective world, is brought forth into tangible expression.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:3">XXI, 3</a></font></span>3. This is because the Infinite mind, which is the source from which all things proceed, is one and indivisible, and each individual is a channel whereby this Eternal Energy is being manifested. Our ability to think is our ability to act upon this Universal substance, and what we think is what is created or produced in the objective world.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:4">XXI, 4</a></font></span>4. The result of this discovery is nothing less than marvellous, and means that mind is extraordinary in quality, limitless in quantity and contains possibilities without number. To become conscious of this power is to become a "live wire"; it has the same effect as placing an ordinary wire in contact with a wire that is</p>  
 <p><a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="green">p. 270</font></a></p>  
 <p>charged. The Universal is the live wire. It carries power sufficient to meet every situation which may arise in the life of every individual. When the individual mind touches the Universal Mind it receives all the power it requires. This is the world within. All science recognizes the reality of this world, and all power is contingent upon our recognition of this world.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:5">XXI, 5</a></font></span>5. The ability to eliminate imperfect conditions depends upon mental action, and mental action depends upon consciousness of power; therefore, the more conscious we become of our unity with the source of all power, the greater will be our power to control and master every condition.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:6">XXI, 6</a></font></span>6. Large ideas have a tendency to eliminate all smaller ideas so that it is well to hold ideas large enough to counteract and destroy all small or undesirable tendencies. This will remove innumerable petty and annoying obstacles from your path. You also become conscious of a larger world of thought, thereby increasing your mental capacity as well as placing yourself in position to accomplish something of value.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:7">XXI, 7</a></font></span>7. This is one of the secrets of success, one of the methods of organizing victory, one of the accomplishments of the Master-mind. He thinks big thoughts. The creative energies of mind find no more difficulty in handling large situations than small ones. Mind is just as</p>  
 <p><a name="page_271"><font size="1" color="green">p. 271</font></a></p>  
 <p>much present in the Infinitely large as in the Infinitely small.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:8">XXI, 8</a></font></span>8. When we realize these facts concerning mind we understand how we may bring to ourselves any condition by creating the corresponding conditions in our consciousness, because everything which is held for any length of time in the consciousness, eventually becomes impressed upon the sub-conscious and thus becomes a pattern which the creative energy will weave into the life and environment of the individual.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:9">XXI, 9</a></font></span>9. In this way conditions are produced and we find that our lives are simply the reflection of our predominant thoughts, our mental attitude; we see then that the science of correct thinking is the one science, that it includes all other sciences.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:10">XXI, 10</a></font></span>10. From this science we learn that every thought creates an impression in the brain, that these impressions create mental tendencies, and these tendencies create character, ability and purpose, and that the combined action of character, ability and purpose determines the experiences with which we shall meet in life.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:11">XXI, 11</a></font></span>11. These experiences come to us through the law of attraction; through the action of this law we meet in the world without the experiences which correspond to our world within.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:12">XXI, 12</a></font></span>12. The predominant thought or the mental attitude is the magnet, and the law is that like</p>  
 <p><a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="green">p. 272</font></a></p>  
 <p>attracts like, consequently the mental attitude will invariably attract such conditions as correspond to its nature.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:13">XXI, 13</a></font></span>13. This mental attitude is our personality and is composed of the thoughts which we have been creating in our own mind; therefore, if we wish a change in conditions all that is necessary is to change our thought; this will in turn change our mental attitude, which will in turn change our personality, which will in turn change the persons, things and conditions, or the experiences with which we meet in life.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:14">XXI, 14</a></font></span>14. It is, however, no easy matter to change the mental attitude, but by persistent effort it may be accomplished; the mental attitude is patterned after the mental pictures which have been photographed on the brain; if you do not like the pictures, destroy the negatives and create new pictures; this is the art of visualization.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:15">XXI, 15</a></font></span>15. As soon as you have done this you will begin to attract new things, and the new things will correspond to the new pictures. To do this: impress on the mind a perfect picture of the desire which you wish to have objectified and continue to hold the picture in mind until results are obtained.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:16">XXI, 16</a></font></span>16. If the desire is one which requires determination, ability, talent, courage, power or any other spiritual power, these are necessary essentials for your picture; build them in; they are</p>  
 <p><a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="green">p. 273</font></a></p>  
 <p>the vital part of the picture; they are the feeling which combines with thought and creates the irresistible magnetic power which draws the things you require to you. They give your picture life, and life means growth, and as soon as it begins to grow, the result is practically assured.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:17">XXI, 17</a></font></span>17. Do not hesitate to aspire to the highest possible attainments in anything you may undertake, for the mind forces are ever ready to lend themselves to a purposeful will in the effort to crystallize its highest aspirations into acts, accomplishments and events.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:18">XXI, 18</a></font></span>18. An illustration of how these mind forces operate is suggested by the method in which all our habits are formed. We do a thing, then do it again, and again, and again, until it becomes easy and perhaps almost automatic; and the same rule applies in breaking any and all bad habits; we stop doing a thing, and then avoid it again, and again until we are entirely free from it; and if we do fail now and then, we should by no means lose hope, for the law is absolute and invincible and gives us credit for every effort and every success, even though our efforts and successes are perhaps intermittent.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:19">XXI, 19</a></font></span>19. There is no limit to what this law can do for you; dare to believe in your own ideal; remember that Nature is plastic to the ideal; think of the ideal as an already accomplished fact.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="green">p. 274</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:20">XXI, 20</a></font></span>20. The real battle of life is one of ideas; it is being fought out by the few against the many; on the one side is the constructive and creative thought, on the other side the destructive and negative thought; the creative thought is dominated by an ideal, the passive thought is dominated by appearances. On both sides are men of science, men of letters and men of affairs.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:21">XXI, 21</a></font></span>21. On the creative side are men who spend their time in laboratories, or over microscopes and telescopes, side by side with the men who dominate the commercial, political and scientific world; on the negative side are men who spend their time investigating law and precedent, men who mistake theology for religion, statesmen who mistake might for right, and all the millions who seem to prefer precedent to progress, who are eternally looking backward instead of forward, who see only the world without, but know nothing of the world within.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:22">XXI, 22</a></font></span>22. In the last analysis there are but these two classes; all men will have to take their place on one side or the other; they will have to go forward, or go back; there is no standing still in a world where all is motion; it is this attempt to stand still that gives sanction and force to arbitrary and unequal codes of law.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:23">XXI, 23</a></font></span>23. That we are in a period of transition is evidenced by the unrest which is everywhere apparent. The complaint of humanity is as a</p>  
 <p><a name="page_275"><font size="1" color="green">p. 275</font></a></p>  
 <p>roll of heaven's artillery, commencing with low and threatening notes and increasing until the sound is sent from cloud to cloud, and the lightning rends the air and earth.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:24">XXI, 24</a></font></span>24. The sentries who patrol the most advanced outposts of the Industrial, Political and Religious world are calling anxiously to each other. What of the night? The danger and insecurity of the position they occupy and attempt to hold is becoming more apparent every hour. The dawn of a new era necessarily declares that the existing order of things cannot much longer be.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:25">XXI, 25</a></font></span>25. The issue between the old regime and the new, the crux of the social problem, is entirely a question of conviction in the minds of the people as to the nature of the Universe. When they realize that the transcendent force of spirit or mind of the Cosmos is within each individual, it will be possible to frame laws that shall consider the liberties and rights of the many instead of the privileges of the few.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:26">XXI, 26</a></font></span>26. As long as the people regard the Cosmic power as a power non-human and alien to humanity, so long will it be comparatively easy for a supposed privileged class to rule by Divine right in spite of every protest of social sentiment. The real interest of humanity is therefore to exalt, emancipate and recognize the divinity of the human spirit. To recognize that all power is from within. That no human being has any more power than any other human being, except</p>  
 <p><a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="green">p. 276</font></a></p>  
 <p>such as may willingly be delegated to him. The old regime would have us believe that the law was superior to the law-makers; herein is the gist of the social crime of every form of privilege and personal inequality, the institutionalizing of the fatalistic doctrine of Divine election.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:27">XXI, 27</a></font></span>27. The Divine Mind is the Universal Mind; it does not act through sheer caprice or from anger, jealousy or wrath; neither can it be flattered, cajoled or moved by sympathy or petition to supply man with some need which he thinks necessary for his happiness or even his existence. The Divine Mind makes no exceptions in favour of any individual; but when the individual understands and realizes his Unity with the Universal Principle he will appear to be favoured because he will have found the source of all health, all wealth and all power.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_XXI:28">XXI, 28</a></font></span>28. For your next exercise, concentrate on the Truth. Try to realize that the Truth shall make you free, that is, nothing can permanently stand in the way of your perfect success when you learn to apply the scientifically correct thought methods and principles. Realize that you are eternalizing in your environment, your inherent soul potencies. Realize that the Silence offers an ever available and almost unlimited opportunity for awakening the highest conception of Truth. Try to comprehend that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="green">p. 277</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Omnipotence itself is absolute silence; all else is change, activity, limitation. Silent thought concentration is therefore the true method of reaching, awakening and then expressing the wonderful potential power of the world within.</p>
