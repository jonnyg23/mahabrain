 </p><h3 align="CENTER"><i>B. The theory of Dome Architecture.</i></h3>
 <p>
 This subject has been more extensively treated by Leonardo in
 drawings than in writing. Still we may fairly assume that it was his
 purpose, ultimately to embody the results of his investigation in a
 "Trattato delle Cupole." <i>The amount of materials is remarkably
 extensive. MS. B is particularly rich in plans and elevations of
 churches with one or more domes--from the simplest form to the most
 complicated that can be imagined. Considering the evident connexion
 between a great number of these sketches, as well as the
 impossibility of seeing in them designs or preparatory sketches for
 any building intended to be erected, the conclusion is obvious that
 they were not designed for any particular monument, but were
 theoretical and ideal researches, made in order to obtain a clear
 understanding of the laws which must govern the construction of a
 great central dome, with smaller ones grouped round it; and with or
 without the addition of spires, so that each of these parts by
 itself and in its juxtaposition to the other parts should produce
 the grandest possible effect.
 </i></p><p>
 In these sketches Leonardo seems to have exhausted every imaginable
 combination.  <a name="fr_33"></a><a href="#fn_33"><font size="1">367</font></a>
  The results of some of these problems are perhaps
 not quite satisfactory; still they cannot be considered to give
 evidence of a want of taste or of any other defect in Leonardo s
 architectural capacity. They were no doubt intended exclusively for
 his own instruction, and, before all, as it seems, to illustrate the
 features or consequences resulting from a given principle.
 </p><p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>
 <p></p><p>
 <i>I have already, in another place,</i>  <a name="fr_34"></a><a href="#fn_34"><font size="1">368</font></a>
  <i>pointed out the law of construction for
 buildings crowned by a large dome: namely, that such a dome, to
 produce the greatest effect possible, should rise either from the
 centre of a Greek cross, or from the centre of a structure of which
 the plan has some symmetrical affinity to a circle, this circle
 being at the same time the centre of the whole plan of the building.
 </i></p><p>
 Leonardo's sketches show that he was fully aware, as was to be
 expected, of this truth. Few of them exhibit the form of a Latin
 cross, and when this is met with, it generally gives evidence of the
 determination to assign as prominent a part as possible to the dome
 in the general effect of the building.
 </p><p>
 While it is evident, on the one hand, that the greater number of
 these domes had no particular purpose, not being designed for
 execution, on the other hand several reasons may be found for
 Leonardo's perseverance in his studies of the subject.
 </p><p>
 Besides the theoretical interest of the question for Leonardo and
 his Trattato <i>and besides the taste for domes prevailing at that
 time, it seems likely that the intended erection of some building of
 the first importance like the Duomos of Pavia and Como, the church
 of Sta. Maria delle Grazie at Milan, and the construction of a Dome
 or central Tower</i> (Tiburio) <i>on the cathedral of Milan, may have
 stimulated Leonardo to undertake a general and thorough
 investigation of the subject; whilst Leonardo's intercourse with
 Bramante for ten years or more, can hardly have remained without
 influence in this matter. In fact now that some of this great
 Architect's studies for S. Peter's at Rome have at last become
 known, he must be considered henceforth as the greatest master of
 Dome-Architecture that ever existed. His influence, direct or
 indirect even on a genius like Leonardo seems the more likely, since
 Leonardo's sketches reveal a style most similar to that of Bramante,
 whose name indeed, occurs twice in Leonardo's manuscript notes. It
 must not be forgotten that Leonardo was a Florentine; the
 characteristic form of the two principal domes of Florence, Sta.
 Maria del Fiore and the Battisterio, constantly appear as leading
 features in his sketches.
 </i></p><p>
 The church of San Lorenzo at Milan, was at that time still intact.
 The dome is to this day one of the most wonderful cupolas ever
 constructed, and with its two smaller domes might well attract the
 attention and study
 </p><p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a></p>
 <p><i>of a never resting genius such as Leonardo. A
 whole class of these sketches betray in fact the direct influence of
 the church of S. Lorenzo, and this also seems to have suggested the
 plan of Bramante's dome of St. Peter's at Rome.
 </i></p><p>
 In the following pages the various sketches for the construction of
 domes have been classified and discussed from a general point of
 view. On two sheets: <a href="pl084.htm#img_pl084">Pl. LXXXIV</a> (C.A. 354b; 118a) and <a href="pl085.htm#img_pl085">Pl. LXXXV</a>,
 Nos. 1-11 (Ash. II, 6b) we see various dissimilar types, grouped
 together; thus these two sheets may be regarded as a sort of
 nomenclature of the different types, on which we shall now have to
 treat.
