 and with the opposite limbs thrust forward; that is where a man puts
 forward the right foot the left arm must be advanced. And if you
 make any one fallen, you must show the place where he has slipped
 and been dragged along the dust into blood stained mire; and in the
 half-liquid earth arround show the print of the tramping of men and
 horses who have passed that way. Make also a horse dragging the dead
 body of his master, and leaving behind him, in the dust and mud, the
 track where the body was dragged along. You must make the conquered
 and beaten pale, their brows raised and knit, and the skin above
 their brows furrowed with pain, the sides of the nose with wrinkles
 going in an arch from the nostrils to the eyes, and make the
 nostrils drawn up--which is the cause of the lines of which I
 speak--, and the lips arched upwards and discovering the upper
 teeth; and the teeth apart as with crying out

 <p>and lamentation. And
 make some one shielding his terrified eyes with one hand, the palm
 towards the enemy, while the other rests on the ground to support
 his half raised body. Others represent shouting with their mouths
 open, and running away. You must scatter arms of all sorts among the
 feet of the combatants, as broken shields, lances, broken swords and
 other such objects. And you must make the dead partly or entirely
 covered with dust, which is changed into crimson mire where it has
 mingled with the flowing blood whose colour shows it issuing in a
 sinuous stream from the corpse. Others must be represented in the
 agonies of death grinding their teeth, rolling their eyes, with
 their fists clenched against their bodies and their legs contorted.
 Some might be shown disarmed and beaten down by the enemy, turning
 upon the foe, with teeth and nails, to take an inhuman and bitter
 revenge. You might see some riderless horse rushing among the enemy,
 with his mane flying in the wind, and doing no little mischief with
 his heels. Some maimed warrior may be seen fallen to the earth,
 covering himself with his shield, while the enemy, bending over him,
 tries to deal him a deathstroke. There again might be seen a number
 of men fallen in a heap over a dead horse. You would see some of the
 victors leaving the fight and issuing from the crowd, rubbing their
 eyes and cheeks with both hands to clean them of the dirt made by
 their watering eyes smarting from the dust and smoke. The reserves
 may be seen standing, hopeful but cautious; with watchful eyes,
 shading them with their hands and gazing through the dense and murky
 confusion, attentive to the commands of their captain. The captain
 himself, his staff raised, hurries towards these auxiliaries,
 pointing to the spot where they are most needed. And there may be a
 river into which horses are galloping, churning up the water all
 round them into turbulent waves of foam and water, tossed into the
 air and among the legs and bodies of the horses. And there must not
 be a level spot that is not trampled with gore.
