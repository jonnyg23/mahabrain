 Of all human opinions that is to be reputed the most foolish which
 deals with the belief in Necromancy, the sister of Alchemy, which
 gives birth to simple and natural things. But it is all the more
 worthy of reprehension than alchemy, because it brings forth nothing
 but what is like itself, that is, lies; this does not happen in
 Alchemy which deals with simple products of nature and whose
 function cannot be exercised by nature itself, because it has no
 organic instruments with which it can work, as men do by means of
 their hands, who have produced, for instance, glass &amp;c but this
 Necromancy the flag and flying banner, blown by the winds, is the
 guide of the stupid crowd which is constantly witness to the
 dazzling and endless effects of this art; and there are books full,
 declaring that enchantments and spirits can work and speak without
 tongues and without organic instruments-- without which it is
 impossible to speak-- and can carry heaviest weights and raise
 storms and rain; and that men can be turned into cats and wolves and
 other beasts, although indeed it is those who affirm these things
 who first became beasts.

 And surely if this Necromancy did exist, as is believed by small
 wits, there is nothing on the earth that would be of so much
 importance alike for the detriment and service of men, if it were
 true that there were in such an art a power to disturb the calm
 serenity of the air, converting it into darkness and making
 coruscations or winds, with terrific thunder and lightnings rushing
 through the darkness, and with violent
 </p><p><a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 305</font></a></p>
 <p>storms overthrowing high
 buildings and rooting up forests; and thus to oppose armies,
 crushing and annihilating them; and, besides these frightful storms
 may deprive the peasants of the reward of their labours.--Now what
 kind of warfare is there to hurt the enemy so much as to deprive him
 of the harvest? What naval warfare could be compared with this? I
 say, the man who has power to command the winds and to make ruinous
 gales by which any fleet may be submerged, --surely a man who could
 command such violent forces would be lord of the nations, and no
 human ingenuity could resist his crushing force. The hidden
 treasures and gems reposing in the body of the earth would all be
 made manifest to him. No lock nor fortress, though impregnable,
 would be able to save any one against the will of the necromancer.
 He would have himself carried through the air from East to West and
 through all the opposite sides of the universe. But why should I
 enlarge further upon this? What is there that could not be done by
 such a craftsman? Almost nothing, except to escape death. Hereby I
 have explained in part the mischief and the usefulness, contained in
 this art, if it is real; and if it is real why has it not remained
 among men who desire it so much, having nothing to do with any
 deity? For I know that there are numberless people who would, to
 satisfy a whim, destroy God and all the universe; and if this
 necromancy, being, as it were, so necessary to men, has not been
 left among them, it can never have existed, nor will it ever exist
 according to the definition of the spirit, which is invisible in
 substance; for within the elements there are no incorporate things,
 because where there is no body, there is a vacuum; and no vacuum can
 exist in the elements because it would be immediately filled up.
 Turn over.
