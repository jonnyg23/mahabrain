 benefits, I have received from your Excellency, have not made you
 </p><p><a name="page_404"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 404</font></a></p>
 <p>somewhat angry with me, and that this is why to so many letters
 which I have written to your Lordship I have never had an answer. I
 now send Salai to explain to your Lordship that I am almost at an
 end of the litigation I had with my brother; that I hope to find
 myself with you this Easter, and to carry with me two pictures of
 two Madonnas of different sizes. These were done for our most
 Christian King, or for whomsoever your Lordship may please. I should
 be very glad to know on my return thence where I may have to reside,
 for I would not give any more trouble to your Lordship. Also, as I
 have worked for the most Christian King, whether my salary is to
 continue or not. I wrote to the President as to that water which the
 king granted me, and which I was not put in possession of because at
 that time there was a dearth in the canal by reason of the great
 droughts and because  <a name="fr_377"></a><a href="#fn_377"><font size="1">683</font></a>
  its
 outlets were not regulated; but he certainly promised me that when
 this was done I should be put in possession. Thus I pray your
 Lordship that you will take so much trouble, now that these outlets
 are regulated, as to remind the President of my matter; that is, to
 give me possession of this water, because on my return I hope to
 make there instruments and other things which will greatly please
 our most Christian King. Nothing else occurs to me. I am always
 yours to command.  <a name="fr_378"></a><a href="#fn_378"><font size="1">684</font></a>

 <p><a name="fn_377"></a><a href="1349.htm#fr_377">404:683</a> :Compare Nos. 1009 and 1010. Leonardo
 has noted the payment of the pension from the king in 1505.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_378"></a><a href="1349.htm#fr_378">404:684</a> :1349. Charles d'Amboise, Marechal de
 Chaumont, was Governor of Milan under Louis XII. Leonardo was in
 personal communication with him so early as in 1503. He was absent
 from Milan in the autumn of 1506 and from October l5l0--when he
 besieged Pope Julius II. in Bologna--till his death, which took
 place at Correggio, February 11, 1511. Francesco Vinci, Leonardo's
 uncle, died--as Amoretti tells us--in the winter of l5l0-11 (or
 according to Uzielli in 1506?), and Leonardo remained in Florence
 for business connected with his estate. The letter written with
 reference to this affair, No. 1348, is undoubtedly earlier than the
 letters Nos. 1349 and 1350. Amoretti tells us, <i>Memorie Storiche</i>,
 ch. II, that the following note existed on the same leaf in MS. C.
 A. I have not however succeeded in finding it. The passage runs
 thus: <i>Jo sono quasi al fine del mio letizio che io o con mie
 fratetgli ... Ancora ricordo a V. Excia la facenda che o cum Ser
 Juliana mio Fratello capo delli altri fratelli ricordandoli come se
 offerse di conciar le cose nostre fra noi fratelli del comune della
 eredita de mio Zio, e quelli costringa alla expeditione, quale
 conteneva la lettera che lui me mando.</i></p>
