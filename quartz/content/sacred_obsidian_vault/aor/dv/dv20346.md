 <i>A large part of the texts published in this section might perhaps
 have found their proper place in connection with the foregoing
 chapters on Physical Geography. But these observations on Physical
 Geography, of whatever kind they may be, as soon as they are
 localised acquire a special interest and importance and particularly
 as bearing on the question whether Leonardo himself made the
 observations recorded at the places mentioned or merely noted the
 statements from hearsay. In a few instances he himself tells us that
 he writes at second hand. In some cases again, although the style
 and expressions used make it seem highly probable that he has
 derived his information from others-- though, as it seems to me,
 these cases are not very numerous--we find, on the other hand, among
 these topographical notes a great number of observations, about
 which it is extremely difficult to form a decided opinion. Of what
 the Master's life and travels may have been throughout his
 sixty-seven years of life we know comparatively little; for a long
 course of time, and particularly from about 1482 to 1486, we do not
 even know with certainty that he was living in Italy. Thus, from a
 biographical point of view a very great interest attaches to some of
 the topographical notes, and for this reason it seemed that it would
 add to their value to arrange them in a group by themselves.
 Leonardo's intimate knowledge with places, some of which were
 certainly remote from his native home, are of importance as
 contributing to decide the still open question as to the extent of
 Leonardo's travels. We shall find in these notes a confirmation of
 the view, that the MSS. in which the Topographical Notes occur are
 in only a very few instances such diaries as may have been in use
 during a journey. These notes are mostly found in the MSS. books of
 his later and quieter years, and it is certainly remarkable that
 Leonardo is very reticent as to the authorities from whom he quotes
 his facts and observations: For instance, as to the Straits of
 Gibraltar, the Nile, the Taurus Mountains and the Tigris and
 Euphrates. Is it likely that he, who declared that in all scientific
 research, his own experience should be the foundation of his
 statements (see XIX Philosophy No. 987--991,) should here have made
 an exception to this rule without mentioning it?</i>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <i>As for instance in the discussion as to the equilibrium of the mass
 of water in the Mediterranean Sea--a subject which, it may be
 observed, had at that time attracted the interest and study of
 hardly any other observer. The acute remarks, in Nos. 985--993, on
 the presence of shells at the tops of mountains, suffice to
 prove--as it seems to me--that it was not in his nature to allow
 himself to be betrayed into wide generalisations, extending beyond
 the limits of his own investigations, even by such brilliant results
 of personal study.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Most of these Topographical Notes, though suggesting very careful
 and thorough research, do not however, as has been said, afford
 necessarily indisputable evidence that that research was Leonardo's
 own. But it must be granted that in more than one instance
 probability is in favour of this idea.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Among the passages which treat somewhat fully of the topography of
 Eastern places by far the most interesting is a description of the
 Taurus Mountains; but as this text is written in the style of a
 formal report and, in the original, is associated with certain
 letters which give us the history of its origin, I have thought it
 best not to sever it from that connection. It will be found under
 No. XXI (Letters).</i>

 <i>That Florence, and its neighbourhood, where Leonardo spent his
 early years, should be nowhere mentioned except in connection with
 the projects for canals, which occupied his attention for some short
 time during the first ten years of the XVIth century, need not
 surprise us. The various passages relating to the construction of
 canals in Tuscany, which are put together at the beginning, are
 immediately followed by those which deal with schemes for canals in
 Lombardy; and after these come notes on the city and vicinity of
 Milan as well as on the lakes of North Italy.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The notes on some towns of Central Italy which Leonardo visited in
 1502, when in the service of Cesare Borgia, are reproduced here in
 the same order as in the note book used during these travels (MS.
 L., Institut de France). These notes have but little interest in
 themselves excepting as suggesting his itinerary. The maps of the
 districts drawn by Leonardo at the time are more valuable (see No.
 1054 note). The names on these maps are not written from right to
 left, but in the usual manner, and we are permitted to infer that
 they were made in obedience to some command, possibly for the use of
 Cesare Borgia himself; the fact that they remained nevertheless in
 Leonardo's hands is not surprising when we remember the sudden
 political changes and warlike events of the period. There can be no
 doubt that these maps, which are here published for the first time,
 are original in the strictest sense of the word, that is to say
 drawn from observations of the places themselves; this is proved by
 the fact--among others--that we find among his manuscripts not only
 the finished maps themselves but the rough sketches and studies for
 them. And it would perhaps be difficult to point out among the
 abundant contributions to geographical knowledge published during
 the XVIth century, any maps at all approaching these in accuracy and
 finish.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>The interesting map of the world, so far as it was then known,
 which is among the Leonardo MSS. at Windsor (published in the</i>
 'Archaeologia' <i>Vol. XI) cannot be attributed to the Master, as the
 Marchese Girolamo d'Adda has sufficiently proved; it has not
 therefore been reproduced here.</i>

 <i>Such of Leonardo's observations on places in Italy as were made
 before or after his official travels as military engineer to Cesare
 Borgia, have been arranged in alphabetical order, under Nos.
 1034-1054. The most interesting are those which relate to the Alps
 and the Appenines, Nos. 1057-1068.</i>
 </p><p>
 <i>Most of the passages in which France is mentioned have hitherto
 remained unknown, as well as those which treat of the countries
 bordering on the Mediterranean, which come at the end of this
 section. Though these may be regarded as of a more questionable
 importance in their bearing on the biography of the Master than
 those which mention places in France, it must be allowed that they
 are interesting as showing the prominent place which the countries
 of the East held in his geographical studies. He never once alludes
 to the discovery of America.</i>
