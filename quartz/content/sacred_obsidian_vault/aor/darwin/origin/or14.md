 <h3>Chapter XIV: Mutual Affinities of Organic Beings: Morphology: Embryology: Rudimentary Organs</h3>
 
 <h4>Classification</h4>
 
   <p>FROM the most remote period in the history of the world organic
 beings have been found to resemble each other in descending degrees,
 so that they can be classed in groups under groups. This
 classification is not arbitrary like the grouping of the stars in
 constellations. The existence of groups would have been of simpler
 significance, if one group had been exclusively fitted to inhabit
 the land and another the water; one to feed on flesh, another on
 vegetable matter, and so on; but the case is widely different, for
 it is notorious how commonly members of even the same subgroup have
 different habits. In the second and fourth chapters, on Variation
 and on Natural Selection, I have attempted to show that within each
 country it is the widely ranging, the much diffused and common, that
 is the dominant species, belonging to the larger genera in each class,
 which vary most. The varieties, or incipient species, thus produced,
 ultimately become converted into new and distinct species; and
 these, on the principle of inheritance, tend to produce other new
 and dominant species. Consequently the groups which are now large,
 and which generally include many dominant species, tend to go on
 increasing in size. I further attempted to show that from the
 varying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as
 different places as possible in the economy of nature, they constantly
 tend to diverge in character. This latter conclusion is supported by
 observing the great diversity of forms which, in any small area,
 come into the closest competition, and by certain facts in
 naturalisation.
   </p><p>I attempted also to show that there is a steady tendency in the
 forms which are increasing in number and diverging in character, to
 supplant and exterminate the preceding, less divergent and less
 improved forms. I request the reader to turn to the diagram
 illustrating the action, as formerly explained, of these several
 principles; and he will see that the inevitable result is, that the
 modified descendants proceeding from one progenitor become broken up
 into groups subordinate to groups. In the diagram each letter on the
 uppermost line may represent a genus including several species, and
 the whole of the genera along this upper line form together one class,
 for all are descended from one ancient parent, and, consequently, have
 inherited something in common. But the three genera on the left hand
 have, on this same principle, much in common, and form a sub-family,
 distinct from that containing the next two genera on the right hand,
 which diverged from a common parent at the fifth stage of descent.
 These five genera have also much in common, though less than when
 grouped in sub-families; and they form a family distinct from that
 containing the three genera still farther to the right hand, which
 diverged at an earlier period. And all these genera, descended from
 (A), form an order distinct from the genera descended from (I). So
 that we here have many species descended from a single progenitor
 grouped into genera; and the genera into sub-families, families, and
 orders, all under one great class. The grand fact of the natural
 subordination of organic beings in groups under groups, which, from
 its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in my
 judgment thus explained. No doubt organic beings, like all other
 objects, can be classed in many ways, either artificially by single
 characters, or more naturally by a number of characters. We know, for
 instance, that minerals and the elemental substances can be thus
 arranged. In this case there is of course no relation to genealogical
 succession, and no cause can at present be assigned for their falling
 into groups. But with organic beings the case is different, and the
 view above given accords with their natural arrangement in group under
 group; and no other explanation has ever been attempted.
   </p><p>Naturalists, as we have seen, try to arrange the species, genera,
 and families in each class, on what is called the Natural System.
 But what is meant by this system? Some authors look at it merely as
 a scheme for arranging together those living objects which are most
 alike, and for separating those which are most unlike; or as an
 artificial method of enunciating, as briefly as possible, general
 propositions,- that is, by one sentence to give the characters common,
 for instance, to all mammals, by another those common to all
 carnivora, by another those common to the dog-genus, and then, by
 adding a single sentence, a full description is given of each kind
 of dog. The ingenuity and utility of this system are indisputable. But
 many naturalists think that something more is meant by the Natural
 System; they believe that it reveals the plan of the Creator; but
 unless it be specified whether order in time or space, or both, or
 what else is meant by the plan of the Creator, it seems to me that
 nothing is thus added to our knowledge. Expressions such as that
 famous one by Linnaeus, which we often meet with in a more or less
 concealed form, namely, that the characters do not make the genus, but
 that the genus gives the characters, seem to imply that some deeper
 bond is included in our classifications than mere resemblance. I
 believe that this is the case, and that community of descent- the
 one known cause of close similarity in organic beings- is the bond,
 which though observed by various degrees of modification, is partially
 revealed to us by our classifications.
   </p><p>Let us now consider the rules followed in classification, and the
 difficulties which are encountered on the view that classification
 either gives some unknown plan of creation, or is simply a scheme
 for enunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms
 most like each other. It might have been thought (and was in ancient
 times thought) that those parts of the structure which determined
 the habits of life, and the general place of each being in the economy
 of nature, would be of very high importance in classification. Nothing
 can be more false. No one regards the external similarity of a mouse
 to a shrew, of a dugong to a whale, of a whale to a fish, as of any
 importance. These resemblances, though so intimately connected with
 the whole life of the being, are ranked as merely " adaptive or
 analogical characters "; but to the consideration of these
 resemblances we shall recur. It may even be given as a general rule,
 that the less any part of the organisation is concerned with special
 habits, the more important it becomes for classification. As an
 instance: Owen, in speaking of the dugong, says, "The generative
 organs, being those which are most remotely related to the habits
 and food of an animal, I have always regarded as affording very
 clear indications of its true affinities. We are least likely in the
 modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an
 essential character." With plants how remarkable it is that the organs
 of vegetation, on which their nutrition and life depend, are of little
 significance; whereas the organs of reproduction, with their product
 the seed and embryo, are of paramount importance! So again in formerly
 discussing certain morphological characters which are not functionally
 important, we have seen that they are often of the highest service
 in classification. This depends on their constancy throughout many
 allied groups; and their constancy chiefly depends on any slight
 deviations not having been preserved and accumulated by natural
 selection, which acts only on serviceable characters.
   </p><p>That the mere physiological importance of an organ does not
 determine its classificatory value, is almost proved by the fact
 that in allied groups, in which the same organ, as we have every
 reason to suppose, has nearly the same physiological value, its
 classificatory value is widely different. No naturalist can have
 worked long at any group without being struck with this fact; and it
 has been fully acknowledged in the writings of almost every author. It
 will suffice to quote the highest authority, Robert Brown, who, in
 speaking of certain organs in the Proteaceae, says their generic
 importance, "like that of all their parts, not only in this, but, as
 apprehend, in every natural family, is very unequal, and in some cases
 seems to be entirely lost." Again, in another work he says, the genera
 of the Connaraceae "differ in having one or more ovaria, in the
 existence or absence of albumen, in the imbricate or valvular
 aestivation. Any one of these characters singly is frequently of
 more than generic importance, though here even when all taken together
 they appear insufficient to separate Cnestis from Connarus." To give
 an example amongst insects: in one great division of the
 Hymenoptera, the antennae, as Westwood has remarked, are most constant
 in structure; in another division they differ much, and the
 differences are of quite subordinate value in classification; yet no
 one will say that the antennae in these two divisions of the same
 order are of unequal physiological importance. Any number of instances
 could be given of the varying importance for classification of the
 same important organ within the same group of beings.
   </p><p>Again, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of
 high physiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs in
 this condition are often of much value in classification. No one
 will dispute that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young
 ruminants, and certain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly
 serviceable in exhibiting the close affinity between ruminants and
 pachyderms. Robert Brown has strongly insisted on the fact that the
 position of the rudimentary florets is of the highest importance in
 the classification of the grasses.
   </p><p>Numerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts
 which must be considered of very trifling physiological importance,
 but which are universally admitted as highly serviceable in the
 definition of whole groups. For instance, whether or not there is an
 open passage from the nostrils to the mouth, the only character,
 according to Owen, which absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles-
 the inflection of the angle of the lower jaw in marsupials- the manner
 in which the wings of insects are folded- mere colour in certain
 Algae- mere pubescence on parts of the flower in grasses- the nature
 of the dermal covering, as hair or feathers, in the Vertebrata. If the
 Ornithorhynchus had been covered with feathers instead of hair, this
 external and trifling character would have been considered by
 naturalists as an important aid in determining the degree of
 affinity of this strange creature to birds.
   </p><p>The importance, for classification, of trifling characters, mainly
 depends on their being correlated with many other characters of more
 or less importance. The value indeed of an aggregate of characters
 is very evident in natural history. Hence, as has often been remarked,
 a species may depart from its allies in several characters, both of
 high physiological importance, and of almost universal prevalence, and
 yet leave us in no doubt where it should be ranked. Hence, also, it
 has been found that a classification founded on any single
 character, however, important that may be, has always failed; for no
 part of the organisation is invariably constant. The importance of
 an aggregate of characters, even when none are important, alone
 explains the aphorism enunciated by Linnaeus, namely, that the
 characters do not give the genus, but the genus gives the
 characters; for this seems founded on the appreciation of many
 trifling points of resemblance, too slight to be defined. Certain
 plants, belonging to the Malpighiaceae, bear perfect and degraded
 flowers; in the latter, as A. de Jussieu has remarked, " The greater
 number of the characters proper to the species, to the genus, to the
 family, to the class, disappear, and thus laugh at our
 classification." When Aspicarpa produced in France, during several
 years, only these degraded flowers, departing so wonderfully in a
 number of the most important points of structure from the proper
 type of the order, yet M. Richard sagaciously saw, as Jussieu
 observes, that this genus should still be retained amongst the
 Malpighiaceae. This case well illustrates the spirit of our
 classifications.
   </p><p>Practically, when naturalists are at work, they do not trouble
 themselves about the physiological value of the characters which
 they use in defining a group or in allocating any particular
 species. If they find a character nearly uniform, and common to a
 great number of forms, and not common to others, they use it as one of
 high value; if common to some lesser number, they use it as of
 subordinate value. This principle has been broadly confessed by some
 naturalists to be the true one; and by none more clearly than by
 that excellent botanist, Auguste de Saint-Hilaire. If several trifling
 characters are always found in combination, though no apparent bond of
 connection can be discovered between them, especial value is set on
 them. As in most groups of animals, important organs, such as those
 for propelling the blood, or for Aerating it, or those for propagating
 the race, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as highly
 serviceable in classification; but in some organs all these, the
 most important vital organs, are found to offer characters of quite
 subordinate value. Thus, as Fritz Muller has lately remarked, in the
 same group of crustaceans, Cypridina is furnished with a heart, whilst
 in two closely allied genera, namely Cypris and Cytherea, there is
 no such organ; one species of Cypridina has well-developed
 branchiae, whilst another species is destitute of them.
   </p><p>We can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal
 importance with those derived from the adult, for a natural
 classification of course includes all ages. But it is by no means
 obvious, on the ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo
 should be more important for this purpose than that of the adult,
 which alone plays its full part in the economy of nature. Yet it has
 been strongly urged by those great naturalists, Milne Edwards and
 Agassiz, that embryological characters are the most important of
 all; and this doctrine has very generally been admitted as true.
 Nevertheless, their importance has sometimes been exaggerated, owing
 to the adaptive characters of larvae not having been excluded; in
 order to show this, Fritz Muller arranged by the aid of such
 characters alone the great class of crustaceans, and the arrangement
 did not prove a natural one. But there can be no doubt that
 embryonic, excluding larval characters, are of the highest value for
 classification, not only with animals but with plants. Thus the main
 divisions of flowering plants are founded on differences in the
 embryo,- on the number and position of the cotyledons, and on the mode
 of development of the plumule and radicle. We shall immediately see
 why these characters possess so high a value in classification,
 namely, from the natural system being genealogical in its arrangement.
   </p><p>Our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of
 affinities. Nothing can be easier than to define a number of
 characters common to all birds; but with crustaceans, any such
 definition has hitherto been found impossible. There are crustaceans
 at the opposite ends of the series, which have hardly a character in
 common; yet the species at both ends, from being plainly allied to
 others, and these to others, and so onwards, can be recognised as
 unequivocally belonging to this, and to no other class of the
 Articulata.
   </p><p>Geographical distribution has often been used, though perhaps not
 quite logically, in classification, more especially in very large
 groups of closely allied forms. Temminck insists on the utility or
 even necessity of this practice in certain groups of birds; and it has
 been followed by several entomologists and botanists.
   </p><p>Finally, with respect to the comparative value of the various groups
 of species, such as orders, sub-orders, families, sub-families, and
 genera, they seem to be, at least at present, almost arbitrary.
 Several of the best botanists, such as Mr. Bentham and others, have
 strongly insisted on their arbitrary value. Instances could be given
 amongst plants and insects, of a group first ranked by practised
 naturalists as only a genus, and then raised to the rank of a
 sub-family or family; and this has been done, not because further
 research has detected important structural differences, at first
 overlooked, but because numerous allied species with slightly
 different grades of difference, have been subsequently discovered.
   </p><p>All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in
 classification may be explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself,
 on the view that the Natural System is founded on descent with
 modification;- that the characters which naturalists consider as
 showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which
 have been inherited from a common parent, all true classification
 being genealogical;- that community of descent is the hidden bond
 which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some
 unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general
 propositions, and the mere putting together and separating objects
 more or less alike.
   </p><p>But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe that the
 arrangement of the groups within each class, in due subordination
 and relation to each other, must be strictly genealogical in order
 to be natural; but that the amount of difference in the several
 branches or groups, though allied in the same degree in blood to their
 common progenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the different
 degrees of modification which they have undergone; and this is
 expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera,
 families, sections, or orders. The reader will best understand what is
 meant, if he will take the trouble to refer to the diagram in the
 fourth chapter.
   </p><p>We will suppose the letters A to L to represent allied genera
 existing during the Silurian epoch, and descended from some still
 earlier form. In three of these genera (A, F, and I), a species has
 transmitted modified descendants to the present day, represented by
 the fifteen genera (a14 to z14) on the uppermost horizontal line. Now
 all these modified descendants from a single species, are related in
 blood or descent in the same degree; they may metaphorically be called
 cousins to the same millionth degree; yet they differ widely and in
 different degrees from each other. The forms descended from A, now
 broken up into two or three families, constitute a distinct order from
 those descended from I, also broken up into two families. Nor can
 the existing species, descended from A, be ranked in the same genus
 with the parent A; or those from I, with the parent I. But the
 existing genus f14 may be supposed to have been but slightly modified;
 and it will then rank with the parent-genus F; just as some few
 still living organisms belong to Silurian genera. So that the
 comparative value of the differences between  </p><p>these organic beings,
 which are all related to each other in the same degree in blood, has
 come to be widely different. Nevertheless their genealogical
 arrangement remains strictly true, not only at the present time, but
 at each successive period of descent. All modified descendants from
 A will have inherited something in common from their common parent, as
 will all the descendants from I; so will it be with each subordinate
 branch of descendants, at each successive stage. If, however, we
 suppose any descendant of A, or of I, to have become so much
 modified as to have lost all traces of its parentage, in this case,
 its place in the natural system will be  </p><p>lost, as seems to have
 occurred with some few existing organisms. All the descendants of
 the genus F, along its whole line of descent, are supposed to have
 been but little modified, and they form a single genus. But this
 genus, though much isolated, will still occupy its proper intermediate
 position. The representation of the groups, as here given in the
 diagram on a flat surface, is much too simple. The branches ought to
 have diverged in all directions. If the names of the groups had been
 simply written down in a linear series, the representation would have
 been still less natural; and it is notoriously not possible to
 represent in a series, on a flat surface, the affinities which we
 discover in nature amongst the beings of the same group. Thus, the
 Natural System is genealogical in its arrangement, like a pedigree:
 but the amount of modification which the different groups have
 undergone has to be expressed by ranking them under different
 so-called genera, sub-families, families, sections, orders, and
 classes.
   </p><p>It may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification,
 by taking the case of languages. If we possessed a perfect pedigree of
 mankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford
 the best classification of the various languages now spoken
 throughout the world; and if all extinct languages, and all
 intermediate and slowly changing dialects, were to be included, such
 an arrangement would be the only possible one. Yet it might be that
 some ancient languages had altered very little and had given rise to
 few new languages, whilst others had altered much owing to the
 spreading, isolation, and state of civilisation of the several
 co-descended races, and had thus given rise to many new dialects and
 languages. The various degrees of difference between the languages
 of the same stock, would have to be expressed by groups subordinate to
 groups; but the proper or even the only possible arrangement would
 still be genealogical; and this would be strictly natural, as it would
 connect together all languages, extinct and recent, by the closest
 affinities, and would give the filiation and origin of each tongue.
   </p><p>In confirmation of this view, let us glance at the classification of
 varieties, which are known or believed to be descended from a single
 species. These are grouped under the species, with the sub-varieties
 under the varieties; and in some cases, as with the domestic pigeon,
 with several other grades of difference. Nearly the same rules are
 followed as in classifying species. Authors have insisted on the
 necessity of arranging varieties on a natural instead of an
 artificial system; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two
 varieties of the pineapple together, merely because their fruit,
 though the most important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one
 puts the Swedish and common turnip together, though the esculent and
 thickened stems are so similar. Whatever part is found to be most
 constant, is used in classing varieties: thus the great
 agriculturist Marshall says the horns are very useful for this purpose
 with cattle, because they are less variable than the shape or colour
 of the body, &amp;c.; whereas with sheep the horns are much less
 serviceable, because less constant. In classing varieties, I
 apprehend that if we had a real pedigree, a genealogical
 classification would be universally preferred; and it has been
 attempted in some cases. For we might feel sure, whether there had
 been more or less modification, that the principle of inheritance
 would keep the forms together which were allied in the greatest number
 of points. In tumbler pigeons, though some of the sub-varieties differ
 in the important character of the length of the beak, yet all are kept
 together from having the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced
 breed has nearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any
 thought on the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group,
 because allied in blood and alike in some other respects.
   </p><p>With species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact
 brought descent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest
 grade, that of species, the two sexes; and how enormously these
 sometimes differ in the most important characters, is known to every
 naturalist: scarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of
 the adult males and hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes, and yet no
 one dreams of separating them. As soon as the three orchidean forms,
 Monachanthus, Myanthus, and Catasetum, which had previously been
 ranked as three distinct genera, were known to be sometimes produced
 on the same plant, they were immediately considered as varieties;
 and now I have been able to show that they are the male, female, and
 hermaphrodite forms of the same species. The naturalist includes as
 one species the various larval stages of the same individual,
 however much they may differ from each other and from the adult, as
 well as the so-called alternate generations of Steenstrup, which can
 only in a technical sense be considered as the same individual. He
 includes monsters and varieties, not from their partial resemblance to
 the parent-form, but because they are descended from it.
   </p><p>As descent has universally been used in classing together the
 individuals of the same species, though the males and females and
 larvae are sometimes extremely different; and as it has been used in
 classing varieties which have undergone a certain, and sometimes a
 considerable amount of modification, may not this same element of
 descent have been unconsciously used in grouping species under
 genera, and genera under higher groups, all under the so-called
 natural system? I believe it has been unconsciously used; and thus
 only can I understand the several rules and guides which have been
 followed by our best systematists. As we have no written pedigrees, we
 are forced to trace community of descent by resemblances of any
 kind. Therefore we chose those characters which are the least likely
 to have been modified, in relation to the conditions of life to
 which each species has been recently exposed. Rudimentary structures
 on this view are as good as, or even better than, other parts of the
 organisation. We care not how trifling a character may be- let it be
 the mere inflection of the angle of the jaw, the manner in which an
 insect's wing is folded, whether the skin be covered by hair or
 feathers- if it prevail throughout many and different species,
 especially those having very different habits of life, it assumes high
 value; for we can account for its presence in so many forms with
 such different habits, only by inheritance from a common parent. We
 may err in this respect in regard to single points of structure, but
 when several characters, let them be ever so trifling, concur
 throughout a large group of beings having different habits, we may
 feel almost sure, on the theory of descent, that these characters
 have been inherited from a common ancestor; and we know that such
 aggregated characters have especial value in classification.
   </p><p>We can understand why a species or a group of species may depart
 from its allies, in several of its most important characteristics, and
 yet be safely classed with them. This may be safely done, and is
 often done, as long as a sufficient number of characters, let them
 be ever so unimportant, betrays the hidden bond of community of
 descent. Let two forms have not a single character in common, yet,
 if these extreme forms are connected together by a chain of
 intermediate groups, we may at once infer their community of
 descent, and we put them all into the same class. As we find organs of
 high physiological importance- those which serve to preserve life
 under the most diverse conditions of existence- are generally the most
 constant, we attach especial value to them; but if these same
 organs, in another group or section of a group, are found to differ
 much, we at once value them less in our classification. We shall
 presently see why embryological characters are of such high
 classificatory importance. Geographical distribution may sometimes
 be brought usefully into play in classing large genera, because all
 the species of the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and isolated
 region, are in all probability descended from the same parents.
   </p><p>Analogical Resemblances.- We can understand, on the above views, the
 very important distinction between real affinities and analogical or
 adaptive resemblances. Lamarck first called attention to this subject,
 and he has been ably followed by Macleay and others. The resemblance
 in the shape of the body and in the fin-like anterior limbs between
 dugongs and whales, and between these two orders of mammals and
 fishes, are analogical. So is the resemblance between a mouse and a
 shrewmouse (Sorex), which belong to different orders; and the still
 closer resemblance, insisted on by Mr. Mivart, between the mouse and a
 small marsupial animal (Antechinus) of Australia. These latter
 resemblances may be accounted for, as it seems to me, by adaptation
 for similarly active movements through thickets and herbage,
 together with concealment from enemies.
   </p><p>Amongst insects there are innumerable similar instances; thus
 Linnaeus, misled by external appearances, actually classed an
 homopterous insect as a moth. We see something of the same kind even
 with our domestic varieties, as in the strikingly similar shape of the
 body in the improved breeds of the Chinese and common pig, which are
 descended from distinct species; and in the similarly thickened
 stems of the common and specifically distinct Swedish turnip. The
 resemblance between the greyhound and the race-horse is hardly more
 fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authors
 between widely different animals.
   </p><p>On the view of characters being of real importance for
 classification, only in so far as they reveal descent, we can
 clearly understand why analogical or adaptive characters, although
 of the utmost importance to the welfare of the being, are almost
 valueless to the systematist. For animals, belonging to two most
 distinct lines of descent, may have become adapted to similar
 conditions, and thus have assumed a close external resemblance; but
 such resemblances will not reveal- will rather tend to conceal their
 blood-relationship. We can thus understand the apparent paradox,
 that the very same characters are analogical when one group is
 compared with another, but give true affinities when the members of
 the same group are compared together: thus, the shape of the body
 and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared with
 fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming through the
 water; but between the several members of the whale family, the
 shape of the body and the fin-like limbs offer characters exhibiting
 true affinity; for as these parts are so nearly similar throughout the
 whole family, we cannot doubt that they have been inherited from a
 common ancestor. So it is with fishes.
   </p><p>Numerous cases could be given of striking resemblances in quite
 distinct beings between single parts or organs, which have been
 adapted for the same functions. A good instance is afforded by the
 close resemblance of the jaws of the dog and Tasmanian wolf or
 Thylacinus,- animals which are widely sundered in the natural
 system. But this resemblance is confined to general appearance, as
 in the prominence of the canines, and in the cutting shape of the
 molar teeth. For the teeth really differ much: thus the dog has on
 each side of the upper jaw four pre-molars and only two molars; whilst
 the Thylacinus has three pre-molars and four molars. The molars also
 differ much in the two animals in relative size and structure. The
 adult dentition is preceded by a widely different milk dentition.
 Any one may of course deny that the teeth in either case have been
 adapted for tearing flesh, through the natural selection of successive
 variations; but if this be admitted in the one case, it is
 unintelligible to me that it should be denied in the other. I am
 glad to find that so high an authority as Professor Flower has come to
 this same conclusion.
   </p><p>The extraordinary cases given in a former chapter, of widely
 different fishes possessing electric organs,- of widely different
 insects possessing luminous organs,- and of orchids and asclepiads
 having pollen-masses with viscid discs, come under this same head of
 analogical resemblances. But these cases are so wonderful that they
 were introduced as difficulties or objections to our theory. In all
 such cases some fundamental difference in the growth or development of
 the parts, and generally in their matured structure, can be
 detected. The end gained is the same, but the means, though
 appearing superficially to be the same, are essentially different. The
 principle formerly alluded to under the term of analogical variation
 has probably in these cases often come into play; that is, the members
 of the same class, although only distantly allied, have inherited so
 much in common in their constitution, that they are apt to vary
 under similar exciting causes in a similar manner; and this would
 obviously aid in the acquirement through natural selection of parts or
 organs, strikingly like each other, independently of their direct
 inheritance from a common progenitor.
   </p><p>As species belonging to distinct classes have often been adapted
 by successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar
 circumstances,- to inhabit, for instance, the three elements of
 land, air, and water,- we can perhaps understand how it is that a
 numerical parallelism has sometimes been observed between the
 sub-groups of distinct classes. A naturalist, struck with a
 parallelism of this nature, by arbitrarily raising or sinking the
 value of the groups in several classes (and all our experience shows
 that their valuation is as yet arbitrary), could easily extend the
 parallelism over a wide range; and thus the septenary, quinary,
 quarternary and ternary classifications have probably arisen.
   </p><p>There is another and curious class of cases in which close
 external resemblance does not depend on adaptation to similar habits
 of life, but has been gained for the sake of protection. I allude to
 the wonderful manner in which certain butterflies imitate, as first
 described by Mr. Bates, other and quite distinct species. This
 excellent observer has shown that in some districts of S. America,
 where, for instance, an Ithomia abounds in gaudy swarms, another
 butterfly, namely, a leptalis, is often found mingled in the same
 flock; and the latter so closely resembles the Ithomia in every
 shade and stripe of colour and even in the shape of its wings, that
 Mr. Bates, with his eyes sharpened by collecting during eleven
 years, was, though always on his guard, continually deceived. When the
 mockers and the mocked are caught and compared, they are found to be
 very different in essential structure, and to belong not only to
 distinct genera, but often to distinct families. Had this mimicry
 occurred in only one or two instances, it might have been passed
 over as a strange coincidence. But, if we proceed from a district
 where one Leptalis imitates an Ithomia, another mocking and mocked
 species, belonging to the same two genera, equally close in their
 resemblance, may be found. Altogether no less than ten genera are
 enumerated, which include species that imitate other butterflies.
 The mockers and mocked always inhabit the same region; we never find
 an imitator living remote from the form which it imitates. The mockers
 are almost invariably rare insects; the mocked in almost every case
 abound in swarms. In the same district in which a species of
 laptalis closely imitates an Ithomia, there are sometimes other
 Lepidoptera mimicking the same Ithomia: so that in the same place,
 species of three genera of butterflies and even a moth are found all
 closely resembling a butterfly belonging to a fourth genus. It
 deserves especial notice that many of the mimicking forms of the
 leptalis, as well as of the mimicked forms, can be shown by a
 graduated series to be merely varieties of the same species; whilst
 others are undoubtedly distinct species. But why, it may be asked, are
 certain forms treated as the mimicked and others as the mimickers? Mr.
 Bates satisfactorily answers this question, by showing that the form
 which is imitated keeps the usual dress of the group to which it
 belongs, whilst the counterfeiters have changed their dress and do not
 resemble their nearest allies.
   </p><p>We are next led to inquire what reason can be assigned for certain
 butterflies and moths so often assuming the dress of another and
 quite distinct form; why, to the perplexity of naturalists, has nature
 condescended to the tricks of the stage? Mr. Bates has, no doubt,
 hit on the true explanation. The mocked forms, which always abound
 in numbers, must habitually escape destruction to a large extent,
 otherwise they could not exist in such swarms; and a large amount of
 evidence has now been collected, showing that they are distasteful
 to birds and other insect-devouring animals. The mocking forms, on the
 other hand, that inhabit the same district, are comparatively rare,
 and belong to rare groups; hence they must suffer habitually from some
 danger, for otherwise, from the number of eggs laid by all
 butterflies, they would in three or four generations swarm over the
 whole country. Now if a member of one of these persecuted and rare
 groups were to assume a dress so like that of a well-protected species
 that it continually deceived the practised eye of an entomologist,
 it would often deceive predaceous birds and insects, and thus often
 escape destruction. Mr. Bates may almost be said to have actually
 witnessed the process by which the mimickers have come so closely to
 resemble the mimicked; for he found that some of the forms of Leptalis
 which mimic so many other butterflies, varied in an extreme degree. In
 one district several varieties occurred, and of these one alone
 resembled to a certain extent, the common Ithomia of the same
 district. In another district there were two or three varieties, one
 of which was much commoner than the others, and this closely mocked
 another form of Ithomia. From facts of this nature, Mr. Bates
 concludes that the leptalis first varies; and when a variety happens
 to resemble in some degree any common butterfly inhabiting the same
 district, this variety, from its resemblance to a flourishing and
 little-persecuted kind, has a better chance of escaping destruction
 from predaceous birds and insects, and is consequently oftener
 preserved;- "the less perfect degrees of resemblance being
 generation after generation eliminated, and only the others left to
 propagate their kind." So that here we have an excellent
 illustration of natural selection.
   </p><p>Messrs. Wallace and Trimen have likewise described several equally
 striking cases of imitation in the Lepidoptera of the Malay
 Archipelago and Africa, and with some other insects. Mr. Wallace has
 also detected one such case with birds, but we have none with the
 larger quadrupeds. The much greater frequency of imitation with
 insects than with other animals, is probably the consequence of
 their small size; insects cannot defend themselves, excepting indeed
 the kinds furnished with a sting, and I have never heard of an
 instance of such kinds mocking other insects, though they are
 mocked; insects cannot easily escape by flight from the larger animals
 which prey on them; therefore, speaking metaphorically, they are
 reduced, like most weak creatures, to trickery and dissimulation.
   </p><p>It should be observed that the process of imitation probably never
 commenced between forms widely dissimilar in colour. But starting with
 species already somewhat like each other, the closest resemblance,
 if beneficial, could readily be gained by the above means; and if
 the imitated form was subsequently and gradually modified through
 any agency, the imitating form would be led along the same track,
 and thus be altered to almost any extent, so that it might
 ultimately assume an appearance or colouring wholly unlike that of the
 other members of the family to which it belonged. There is, however,
 some difficulty on this head, for it is necessary to suppose in some
 cases that ancient members belonging to several distinct groups,
 before they had diverged to their present extent, accidentally
 resembled a member of another and protected group in a sufficient
 degree to afford some slight protection; this having given the basis
 for the subsequent acquisition of the most perfect resemblance.
 </p><p>On the Nature of the Affinities connecting Organic Beings.- As the
 modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the larger
 genera, tend to inherit the advantages which made the groups to
 which they belong large and their parents dominant, they are almost
 sure to spread widely, and to seize on more and more places in the
 economy of nature. The larger and more dominant groups within each
 class thus tend to go on increasing in size; and they consequently
 supplant many smaller and feebler groups. Thus we can account for
 the fact that all organisms, recent and extinct, are included under
 a few great orders, and under still fewer classes. As showing how
 few the higher groups are in number, and how widely they are spread
 throughout the world, the fact is striking that the discovery of
 Australia has not added an insect belonging to a new class; and that
 in the vegetable kingdom, as I learn from Dr. Hooker, it has added
 only two or three families of small size.
   </p><p>In the chapter on Geological Succession I attempted to show, on
 the principle of each group having generally diverged much in
 character during the long-continued process of modification, how it is
 that the more ancient forms of life often present characters in some
 degree intermediate between existing groups. As some few of the old
 and intermediate forms have transmitted to the present day descendants
 but little modified, these constitute our so-called osculant or
 aberrant species. The more aberrant any form is, the greater must be
 the number of connecting forms which have been exterminated and
 utterly lost. And we have some evidence of aberrant groups having
 suffered severely from extinction, for they are almost always
 represented by extremely few species; and such species as do occur are
 generally very distinct from each other, which again implies
 extinction. The genera Ornithorhynchus and lepidosiren, for example,
 would not have been less aberrant had each been represented by a
 dozen species, instead of as at present by a single one, or by two
 or three. We can, I think, account for this fact only by looking at
 aberrant groups as forms which have been conquered by more
 successful competitors, with a few members still preserved under
 unusually favourable conditions.
   </p><p>Mr. Waterhouse has remarked that, when a member belonging to one
 group of animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group,
 this affinity in most cases is general and not special; thus,
 according to Mr. Waterhouse, of all rodents, the bizcacha is most
 nearly related to marsupials; but in the points in which it
 approaches this order, its relations are general, that is, not to
 any one marsupial species more than to another. As these points of
 affinity are believed to be real and not merely adaptive, they must be
 due in accordance with our view to inheritance from a common
 progenitor. Therefore we must suppose either that all rodents,
 including the bizcacha, branched off from some ancient marsupial,
 which will naturally have been more or less intermediate in
 character with respect to all existing marsupials; or that both
 rodents and marsupials branched off from a common progenitor, and that
 both groups have since undergone much modification in divergent
 directions. On either view we must suppose that the bizcacha has
 retained, by inheritance, more of the, characters of its ancient
 progenitor than have other rodents; and therefore it will not be
 specially related to any one existing marsupial, but indirectly to all
 or nearly all marsupials, from having partially retained the character
 of their common progenitor, or of some early member of the group. On
 the other hand, of all marsupials, as Mr. Waterhouse has remarked, the
 Phascolomys resembles most nearly, not any one species, but the
 general order of rodents. In this case, however, it may be strongly
 suspected as the resemblance is only analogical, owing to the
 Phascolomys having become adapted to habits like those of a rodent.
 The elder De Candolle has made nearly similar observations on the
 general nature of the affinities of distinct families of plants.
   </p><p>On the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in
 character of the species descended from a common progenitor,
 together with their retention by inheritance of some characters in
 common, we can understand the excessively complex and radiating
 affinities by which all the members of the same family or higher group
 are connected together. For the common progenitor of a whole family,
 now broken up by extinction into distinct groups and sub-groups,
 will have transmitted some of its characters, modified in various ways
 and degrees, to all the species; and they will consequently be related
 to each other by circuitous lines of affinity of various lengths (as
 may be seen in the diagram so often referred to), mounting up through
 many predecessors. As it is difficult to show the blood relationship
 between the numerous kindred of any ancient and noble family even by
 the aid of a genealogical tree, and almost impossible to do so without
 this aid, we can understand the extraordinary difficulty which
 naturalists have experienced in describing, without the aid of a
 diagram, the various affinities which they perceive between the many
 living and extinct members of the same great natural class.
   </p><p>Extinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an
 important part in defining and widening the intervals between the
 several groups in each class. We may thus account for the distinctness
 of whole classes from each other- for instance, of birds from all
 other vertebrate animals- by the belief that many ancient forms of
 life have been utterly lost, through which the early progenitors of
 birds were formerly connected with the early progenitors of the
 other and at that time less differentiated vertebrate classes. There
 has been much less extinction of the forms of life which once
 connected fishes with batrachians. There has been still less within
 some whole classes, for instance the Crustacea, for here the most
 wonderfully diverse forms are still linked together by a long and only
 partially broken chain of affinities. Extinction has only defined
 the groups: it has by no means made them; for if every form which
 has ever lived on this earth were suddenly to reappear, though it
 would be quite impossible to give definitions by which each group
 could be distinguished, still a natural classification, or at least
 a natural arrangement, would be possible. We shall see this by turning
 to the diagram; the letters, A to L, may represent eleven Silurian
 genera, some of which have produced large groups of modified
 descendants, with every link in each branch and sub-branch still
 alive; and the links not greater than those between existing
 varieties. In this case it would be quite impossible to give
 definitions by which the several members of the several groups could
 be distinguished from their more immediate parents and descendants.
 Yet the arrangement in the diagram would still hold good and would be
 natural; for, on the principle of inheritance, all the forms
 descended, for instance, from A, would have something in common. In a
 tree we can distinguish this or that branch, though at the actual fork
 the two unite and blend together. We could not, as I have said, define
 the several groups; but we could pick out types, or forms,
 representing most of the characters of each group, whether large or
 small, and thus give a general idea of the value of the differences
 between them. This is what we should be driven to, if we were ever to
 succeed in collecting all the forms in any one class which have lived
 throughout all time and space. Assuredly we shall never succeed in
 making so perfect a collection: nevertheless, in certain classes, we
 are tending towards: this end; and Milne Edwards has lately insisted,
 in an able paper, on the high importance of looking to types, whether
 or not we can separate and define the groups to which such types
 belong.
   </p><p>Finally we have seen that natural selection, which follows from
 the struggle for existence, and which almost inevitably leads to
 extinction and divergence of character in the descendants from any one
 parent species, explains that great and universal feature in the
 affinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination in group
 under group. We use the element of descent in classing the individuals
 of both sexes and of all ages under one species, although they may
 have but few characters in common; we use descent in classing
 acknowledged varieties, however different they may be from their
 parents; and I believe that this element of descent is the hidden bond
 of connection which naturalists have sought under the term of the,
 Natural System. On this idea of the natural system, being, in so far
 as it has been perfected, genealogical in its arrangement, with the
 grades of difference expressed by the terms genera, families,
 orders, &amp;c., we can understand the rules which we are compelled to
 follow in our classification. We can understand why we value certain
 resemblances far more than others; why we use rudimentary and
 useless organs, or others of trifling physiological importance; why,
 in finding the relations between one group and another, we summarily
 reject analogical or adaptive characters, and yet use these same
 characters within the limits of the same group. We can clearly see how
 it is that all living and extinct forms can be grouped together within
 a few great classes; and how the several members of each class are
 connected together by the most complex and radiating lines of
 affinities. We shall never, probably, disentangle the inextricable web
 of the affinities between the members of any one class; but when we
 have a distinct object in view, and do not look to some unknown plan
 of creation, we may hope to make sure but slow progress.
   </p><p>Professor Haeckel in his Generelle Morphologie and in other works,
 has recently brought his great knowledge and abilities to bear on what
 he calls phylogeny, or the lines of descent of all organic beings.
 In drawing up the several series he trusts chiefly to embryological
 characters, but receives aid from homologous and rudimentary organs,
 as well as from the successive periods at which the various forms of
 life are believed to have first appeared in our geological formations.
 He has thus boldly made a great beginning, and shows us how
 classification will in the future be treated.
 
 </p><h4>Morphology</h4>
 
   <p>We have seen that the members of the same class, independently of
 their habits of life, resemble each other in the general plan of their
 organisation. This resemblance is often expressed by the term "unity
 of type"; or by saying that the several parts and organs in the
 different species of the class are homologous. The whole subject is
 included under the general term of Morphology. This is one of the
 most interesting departments of natural history, and may almost be
 said to be its very soul. What can be more curious than that the
 hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the
 leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat,
 should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include
 similar bones, in the same relative positions? How curious it is, to
 give a subordinate though striking instance, that the hind-feet of the
 kangaroo, which are so well fitted for bounding over the open
 plains, those of the climbing, leaf-eating koala, equally well
 fitted for grasping the branches of trees,- those of the
 ground-dwelling, insect or root-eating, bandicoots,- and those of some
 other Australian marsupials,- should all be constructed on the same
 extraordinary type, namely with the bones of the second and third
 digits extremely slender and enveloped within the same skin, so that
 they appear like a single toe furnished with two claws.
 Notwithstanding this similarity of pattern, it is obvious that the
 hind feet of these several animals are used for as widely different
 purposes as it is possible to conceive. The case is rendered all the
 more striking by the American opossums, which follow nearly the same
 habits of life as some of their Australian relatives, having feet
 constructed on the ordinary plan. Professor Flower, from whom these
 statements are taken, remarks in conclusion: "We may call this
 conformity to type, without getting much nearer to an explanation of
 the phenomenon"; and he then adds "but is it not powerfully suggestive
 of true relationship, of inheritance from a common ancestor?"
   </p><p>Geoffroy St-Hilaire has strongly insisted on the high importance
 of relative position or connection in homologous parts; they may
 differ to almost any extent in form and size, and yet remain connected
 together in the same invariable order. We never find, for instance,
 the bones of the arm and fore-arm, or of the thigh and leg,
 transposed. Hence the same names can be given to the homologous
 bones in widely different animals. We see the same great law in the
 construction of the mouths of insects: what can be more different than
 the immensely long spiral proboscis of a sphinxmoth, the curious
 folded one of a bee or bug, and the great jaws of a beetle?- yet all
 these organs, serving for such widely different purposes, are formed
 by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip, mandibles, and
 two pairs of maxillae. The same law governs the construction of the
 mouths and limbs of crustaceans. So it is with the flowers of plants.
   </p><p>Nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this
 similarity of pattern in members of the same class, by utility or by
 the doctrine of final causes. The hopelessness of the attempt has been
 expressly admitted by Owen in his most interesting work on the
 Nature of Limbs. On the ordinary view of the independent creation of
 each being, we can only say that so it is;- that it has pleased the
 Creator to construct all the animals and plants in each great class on
 a uniform plan; but this is not a scientific explanation.
   </p><p>The explanation is to a large extent simple on the theory of the
 selection of successive slight modifications,- each modification being
 profitable in some way to the modified form, but often  </p><p>affecting by
 correlation other parts of the organisation. In changes of this
 nature, there will be little or no tendency to alter the original
 pattern, or to transpose the parts. The bones of a limb might be
 shortened and flattened to any extent, becoming at the same time
 enveloped in thick membrane, so as to serve as a fin; or a webbed
 hand might have all its bones, or certain bones, lengthened to any
 extent, with the membrane connecting them increased, so as to serve as
 a wing; yet all these would not tend to alter the framework of the
 bones or the relative connection of the parts. If we suppose that an
 early progenitor- the archetype as it may be called- of all mammals,
 birds, and reptiles, had its limbs constructed on the existing general
 pattern, for whatever purpose they served, we can at once perceive the
 plain signification of the homologous construction of the limbs
 throughout the class. So with the mouths of insects, we have only to
 suppose that their common progenitor had an upper lip, mandibles,
 and two pairs of maxillae, these parts being perhaps very simple in
 form; and then natural selection will account for the infinite
 diversity in the structure and functions of the mouths of insects.
 Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the general pattern of an organ
 might become so much obscured as to be finally lost, by the
 reduction and ultimately by the complete abortion of certain parts, by
 the fusion of other parts, and by the doubling or multiplication of
 others,- variations which we know to be within the limits of
 possibility. In the paddles of the gigantic extinct sea-lizards, and
 in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans, the general pattern
 seems thus to have become partially obscured.
   </p><p>There is another and equally curious branch of our subject;
 namely, serial homologies, or the comparison of the different parts or
 organs in the same individual, and not of the same parts or organs
 in different members of the same class. Most physiologists believe
 that the bones of the skull are homologous- that is, correspond in
 number and in relative connexion- with the elemental parts of a
 certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and posterior limbs in all
 the higher vertebrate classes are plainly homologous. So it is with
 the wonderfully complex jaws and legs of crustaceans. It is familiar
 to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the
 sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate
 structure, are intelligible on the view that they consist of
 metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we
 often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being
 transformed into another; and we can actually see, during the early or
 embryonic stages of development in flowers, as well as in
 crustaceans and many other animals, that organs, which when mature
 become extremely different are at first exactly alike.
   </p><p>How inexplicable are the cases of serial homologies on the
 ordinary view of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box
 composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of
 bone, apparently representing vertebrae? As Owen has remarked, the
 benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of
 parturition by mammals, will by no means explain the same
 construction in the skulls of birds and reptiles. Why should similar
 bones have been created to form the wing and the leg of a bat, used as
 they are for such totally different purposes, namely flying and
 walking? Why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex
 mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or
 conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the
 sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, in each flower, though fitted
 for such distinct purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern?
   </p><p>On the theory of natural selection, we can, to a certain extent,
 answer these questions. We need not here consider how the bodies of
 some animals first became divided into a series of segments, or how
 they became divided into right and left sides, with corresponding
 organs, for such questions are almost beyond investigation. It is,
 however, probable that some serial structures are the result of
 cells multiplying by division, entailing the multiplication of the
 parts developed from such cells. It must suffice for our purpose to
 bear in mind that an indefinite repetition of the same part or organ
 is the common characteristic, as Owen has remarked, of all low or
 little specialised forms; therefore the unknown progenitor of the
 Vertebrata probably possessed many vertebrae; the unknown progenitor
 of the Articulata, many segments; and the unknown progenitor of
 flowering plants, many leaves arranged in one or more spires. We
 have also formerly seen that parts many times repeated are eminently
 liable to vary, not only in number, but in form. Consequently such
 parts, being already present in considerable numbers, and being
 highly variable, would naturally afford the materials for adaptation
 to the most different purposes; yet they would generally retain,
 through the force of inheritance, plain traces of their original or
 fundamental resemblance. They would retain this resemblance all the
 more, as the variations, which afforded the basis for their
 subsequent modification through natural selection, would tend from the
 first to be similar; the parts being at an early stage of growth
 alike, and being subjected to nearly the same conditions. Such
 parts, whether more or less modified, unless their common origin
 became wholly obscured, would be serially homologous.
   </p><p>In the great class of molluscs, though the parts in distinct species
 can be shown to be homologous, only a few serial homologies, such as
 the valves of chitons, can be indicated; that is, we are seldom
 enabled to say that one part is homologous with another part in the
 same individual. And we can understand this fact; for in molluscs,
 even in the lowest members of the class, we do not find nearly so much
 indefinite repetition of any one part as we find in the other great
 classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
   </p><p>But morphology is a much more complex subject than it at first
 appears, as has lately been well shown in a remarkable paper by Mr.
 E. Ray Lankester, who has drawn an important distinction between
 certain classes of cases which have all been equally ranked by
 naturalists as homologous. He proposes to call the structures which
 resemble each other in distinct animals, owing to their descent from a
 common progenitor with subsequent modification, homogenous; and the
 resemblances which cannot thus be accounted for, he proposes to call
 homoplastic. For instance, he believes that the hearts of birds and
 mammals are as a whole homogenous,- that is, have been derived from
 a common progenitor; but that the four cavities of the heart in the
 two classes are homoplastic,- that is, have been independently
 developed. Mr. Lankester also adduces the close resemblance of the
 parts on the right and left sides of the body, and in the successive
 segments of the same individual animal; and here we have parts
 commonly called homologous, which bear no relation to the descent of
 distinct species from a common progenitor. Homoplastic structures
 are the same with those which I have classed, though in a very
 imperfect manner, as analogous modifications or resemblances. Their
 formation may be attributed in part to distinct organisms, or to
 distinct parts of the same organism, having varied in an analogous
 manner; and in part to similar modifications, having been preserved
 for the same general purpose or function,- of which many instances
 have been given.
   </p><p>Naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed
 vertebrae; the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the stamens and
 pistils in flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it would in most
 cases be more correct, as Professor Huxley has remarked, to speak of
 both skull and vertebrae, jaws and legs, &amp;c., as having been
 metamorphosed, not one from the other, as they now exist, but from
 some common and simpler element. Most naturalists, however, use such
 language only in a metaphorical sense; they are far from meaning
 that during a long course of descent, primordial organs of any kind-
 vertebrae in the one case and legs in the other- have actually been
 converted into skulls or jaws. Yet so strong is the appearance of this
 having occurred, that naturalists can hardly avoid employing
 language having this plain signification. According to the views
 here maintained, such language may be used literally; and the
 wonderful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab retaining numerous
 characters which they probably would have retained through
 inheritance, if they had really been metamorphosed from true though
 extremely simple legs, is in part explained.
 
 </p><h4>Development and Embryology</h4>
 
   <p>This is one of the most important subjects in the whole round of
 history. The metamorphoses of insects, with which every one is
 familiar, are generally effected abruptly by a few stages; but the
 transformations are in reality numerous and gradual, though
 concealed. A certain ephemerous insect  </p><p>(Chloeon) during its
 development, moults, as shown by Sir J. Lubbock, above twenty times,
 and each time undergoes a certain amount of change; and in this case
 we see the act of metamorphosis performed in a primary and gradual
 manner. Many insects, and especially certain crustaceans, show us what
 wonderful changes of structure can be effected during development.
 Such changes, however, reach their acme in the so-called alternate
 generations of some of the lower animals. It is, for instance, an
 astonishing fact that a delicate branching coralline, studded with
 polypi and attached to a submarine rock, should produce, first by
 budding and then by transverse division, a host of huge floating
 jelly-fishes; and that these should produce eggs, from which are
 hatched swimming animalcules, which attach themselves to rocks and
 become developed into branching corallines; and so on in an endless
 cycle. The belief in the essential identity of the process of
 alternate generation and of ordinary metamorphosis has been greatly
 strengthened by Wagner's discovery of the larva or maggot of a fly,
 namely the Cecidomyia, producing asexually other larvae, and these
 others, which finally are developed into mature males and females,
 propagating their kind in the ordinary manner by eggs.
   </p><p>It may be worth notice that when Wagner's remarkable discovery was
 first announced, I was asked how was it possible to account for the
 larvae of this fly having acquired the power of asexual
 reproduction. As long as the case remained unique no answer could be
 given. But already Grimm has shown that another fly, a Chironomus,
 reproduces itself in nearly the same manner, and he believes that this
 occurs frequently in the Order. It is the pupa, and not the larva,
 of the Chironomus which has this power; and Grimm further shows that
 this case, to a certain extent, "unites that of the Cecidomyia with
 the parthenogenesis of the Coccidae";- the term parthenogenesis
 implying that the mature females of the Coccidae are capable of
 producing fertile eggs without the concourse of the males. Certain
 animals belonging to several classes are now known to have the power
 of ordinary reproduction at an unusually early age; and we have only
 to accelerate parthenogenetic production by gradual steps to an
 earlier and earlier age,- Chironomus showing us an almost exactly
 intermediate stage, viz., that of the pupa- and we can perhaps account
 for the marvellous case of the Cecidomyia.
   </p><p>It has already been stated that various parts in the same individual
 which are exactly alike during an early embryonic period, become
 widely different and serve for widely different purposes in the
 adult state. So again it has been shown that generally the embryos
 of the most distinct species belonging to the same class are closely
 similar, but become, when fully developed, widely dissimilar. A better
 proof of this latter fact cannot be given than the statement by von
 Baer that "The embryos of mammalia, of birds, lizards, and snakes,
 probably also of chelonia are in their earliest states exceedingly
 like one another, both as a whole and in the mode of development of
 their parts; so much so, in fact, that we can often distinguish the
 embryos only by their size. In my possession are two little embryos in
 spirit, whose names I have omitted to attach, and at present I am
 quite unable to say to what class they belong. They may be lizards
 or small birds, or very young mammalia, so complete is the
 similarity in the mode of formation of the head and trunk in these
 animals. The extremities, however, are still absent in these
 embryos. But even if they had existed in the earliest stage of their
 development we should learn nothing, for the feet of lizards and
 mammals, the wings and feet of birds, no less than the hands and
 feet of man, all arise from the same fundamental form." The larvae
 of most crustaceans, at corresponding stages of development, closely
 resemble each other, however different the adult may become; and so it
 is with very many other animals. A trace of the law of embryonic
 resemblance occasionally lasts till a rather late age; thus birds of
 the same genus, and of allied genera, often resemble each other in
 their immature plumage; as we see in the spotted feathers in the
 young of the thrush group. In the cat tribe, most of the species
 when adult are striped or spotted in lines; and stripes or spots can
 be plainly distinguished in the whelp of the lion and the puma. We
 occasionally though rarely see something of the same kind in plants;
 thus the first leaves of the ulex or furze, and the first leaves of
 the phyllodineous aeacias, are pinnate or divided like the ordinary
 leaves of the leguminosae.
   </p><p>The points of structure, in which the embryos of widely different
 animals within the same class resemble each other, often have no
 direct relation to their conditions of existence. We cannot, for
 instance, suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar
 looplike courses of the arteries near the branchial slits are
 related to similar conditions,- in the young mammal which is nourished
 in the womb of its mother, in the egg of the bird which is hatched
 in a nest, and in the spawn of a frog under water. We have no more
 reason to believe in such a relation, than we have to believe that the
 similar bones in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, and fin of a
 porpoise, are related to similar conditions of life. No one supposes
 that the stripes on the whelp of a lion, or the spots on the young
 blackbird, are of any use to these animals.
   </p><p>The case, however, is different when an animal during any part of
 its embryonic career is active, and has to provide for itself. The
 period of activity may come on earlier or later in life; but
 whenever it comes on, the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of
 life is just as perfect and as beautiful as in the adult animal. In
 how important a manner this has acted, has recently been well shown by
 Sir J. Lubbock in his remarks on the close similarity of the larvae of
 some insects belonging to very different orders, and on the
 dissimilarity of the larvae of other insects within the same order,
 according to their habits of life. Owing to such adaptations, the
 similarity of the larvae of allied animals is sometimes greatly
 obscured; especially when there is a division of labour during the
 different stages of development, as when the same larva has during one
 stage to search for food, and during another stage has to search for a
 place of attachment. Cases can even be given of the larvae of allied
 species, or groups of species, differing more from each other than
 do the adults. In most cases, however, the larvae, though active,
 still obey, more or less closely, the law of common embryonic
 resemblance. Cirripedes afford a good instance of this; even the
 illustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was a
 crustacean: but a glance at the larva shows this in an unmistakable
 manner. So again the two main divisions of cirripedes, the
 pedunculated and sessile, though differing widely in external
 appearance, have larvae in all their stages barely distinguishable.
   </p><p>The embryo in the course of development generally rises in
 organisation; I use this expression, though I am aware that it is
 hardly possible to define clearly what is meant by the organisation
 being higher or lower. But no one probably will dispute that the
 butterfly is higher than the caterpillar. In some cases, however,
 the mature animal must be considered as lower in the scale than the
 larva, as with certain parasitic crustaceans. To refer once again to
 cirripedes: the larvae in the first stage have three pairs of
 locomotive organs, a simple single eye, and a probosciformed mouth,
 with which they feed largely, for they increase much in size. In the
 second stage, answering to the chrysalis stage of butterflies, they
 have six pairs of beautifully constructed natatory legs, a pair of
 magnificent compound eyes, and extremely complex antennae; but they
 have a closed and imperfect mouth, and cannot feed: their function
 at this stage is, to search out by their well-developed organs of
 sense, and to reach by their active powers of swimming, a proper
 place on which to become attached and to undergo their final
 metamorphosis. When this is completed they are fixed for life: their
 legs are now converted into prehensile organs; they again obtain a
 well-constructed mouth; but they have no antennae, and their two
 eyes are now reconverted into a minute, single, simple eye-spot. In
 this last and complete state, cirripedes may be considered as either
 more highly or more lowly organised than they were in the larval
 condition. But in some genera the larvae become developed into
 hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure, and into what I have
 called complemental males; and in the latter the development has
 assuredly been retrograde, for the male is a mere sack, which lives
 for a short time and is destitute of mouth, stomach, and every other
 organ of importance, excepting those for reproduction.
   </p><p>We are so much accustomed to see a difference in structure between
 the embryo and the adult, that we are tempted to look at this
 difference as in some necessary manner contingent on growth. But there
 is no reason why, for instance, the wing of a bat, or the fin of a
 porpoise, should not have been sketched out with all their parts in
 proper proportion, as soon as any part became visible. In some whole
 groups of animals and in certain members of other groups this is the
 case, and the embryo does not at any period differ widely from the
 adult: thus Owen has remarked in regard to cuttlefish, "There is no
 metamorphosis; the cephalopodic character is manifested long before
 the parts of the embryo are completed." Landshells and fresh-water
 crustaceans are born having their proper forms, whilst the marine
 members of the same two great classes pass through considerable and
 often great changes during their development. Spiders, again, barely
 undergo any metamorphosis. The larvae of most insects pass through a
 worm-like stage, whether they are active and adapted to diversified
 habits, or are inactive from being placed in the midst of proper
 nutriment or from being fed by their parents; but in some few cases,
 as in that of Aphis, if we look to the admirable drawings of the
 development of this insect, by Professor Huxley, we see hardly any
 trace of the vermiform stage.
   </p><p>Sometimes it is only the earlier developmental stages which fail.
 Thus Fritz Muller has made the remarkable discovery that certain
 shrimp-like crustaceans (allied to Penaeus) first appear under the
 simple nauplius-form, and after passing through two or more
 zoea-stages, and then through the mysis-stage, finally acquire their
 mature structure: now in the whole great malacostracan order, to
 which these crustaceans belong, no other member is as yet known to
 be first developed under the nauplius-form, though many appear as
 zoeas; nevertheless Muller assigns reasons for his belief, that if
 there had been no suppression of development, all these crustaceans
 would have appeared as nauplii.
   </p><p>How, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology,-
 namely, the very general, though not universal, difference in
 structure between the embryo and the adult;- the various parts in
 the same individual embryo, which ultimately become very unlike and
 serve for diverse purposes, being at an early period of growth alike;-
 the common, but not invariable, resemblance between the embryos or
 larvae of the most distinct species in the same class;- the embryo
 often retaining, whilst within the egg or womb, structures which are
 of no service to it, either at that or at a later period of life; on
 the other hand, larvae, which have to provide for their own wants,
 being perfectly adapted to the surrounding conditions;- and lastly the
 fact of certain larvae standing higher in the scale of organisation
 than the mature animal into which they are developed? I believe that
 all these facts can be explained, as follows.
   </p><p>It is commonly assumed, perhaps from monstrosities affecting the
 embryo at a very early period, that slight variations or individual
 differences necessarily appear at an equally early period. We have
 little evidence on this head, but what we have certainly points the
 other way; for it is notorious that breeders of cattle, horses, and
 various fancy animals, cannot positively tell, until some time after
 birth, what will be the merits or demerits of their young animals.
 We see this plainly in our own children; we cannot tell whether a
 child will be tall or short, or what its precise features will be. The
 question is not, at what period of life each variation may have been
 caused, but at what period the effects are displayed. The cause may
 have acted, and I believe often has acted, on one or both parents
 before the act of generation. It deserves notice that it is of no
 importance to a very young animal, as long as it remains in its
 mother's womb or in the egg, or as long as it is nourished and
 protected by its parent, whether most of its characters are acquired
 little earlier or later in life. It would not signify, for instance,
 to a bird which obtained its food by having a much-curved beak whether
 or not whilst young it possessed a beak of this shape, as long as it
 was fed by its parents.
   </p><p>I have stated in the first chapter, that at whatever age a
 variation first appears in the parent, it tends to re-appear at a
 corresponding age in the offspring. Certain variations can only appear
 at corresponding ages; for instance, peculiarities in the caterpillar,
 cocoon, or imago states of the silk-moth; or, again, in the full-grown
 horns of cattle. But variations, which, for all that we can see
 might have first appeared either earlier or later in life, likewise
 tend to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring and parent. I
 am far from meaning that this is invariably the case, and I could give
 several exceptional cases of variations (taking the word in the
 largest sense) which have supervened at an earlier age in the child
 than in the parent.
   </p><p>These two principles, namely, that slight variations generally
 appear at a not very early period of life, and are inherited at a
 corresponding not early period, explain, as I believe, all the
 above-specified leading facts in embryology. But first let us look
 to a few analogous cases in our domestic varieties. Some authors who
 have written on dogs, maintain that the greyhound and bulldog,
 though so different, are really closely allied varieties, descended
 from the same wild stock; hence I was curious to see how far their
 puppies differed from each other: I was told by breeders that they
 differed just as much as their parents, and this, judging by the
 eye, seemed almost to be the case; but on actually measuring the old
 dogs and their six-days-old puppies, I found that the puppies had
 not acquired nearly their full amount of proportional difference.
 So, again, I was told that the foals of cart- and race-horses-
 breeds which have been almost wholly formed by selection under
 domestication- differed as much as the full-grown animals; but
 having had careful measurements made of the dams and of three-days-old
 colts of race and heavy cart-horses, I find that this is by no means
 the case.
   </p><p>As we have conclusive evidence that the breeds of the pigeon are
 descended from a single wild species, I compared the young within
 twelve hours after being hatched; I carefully measured the proportions
 (but will not here give the details) of the beak, width of mouth,
 length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length of leg, in
 the wild parent-species, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs,
 dragons, carriers, and tumblers. Now some of these birds, when mature,
 differ in so extraordinary a manner in the length and form of beak,
 and in other characters, that they would certainly have been ranked as
 distinct genera if found in a state of nature. But when the nestling
 birds of these several breeds were placed in a row, though most of
 them could just be distinguished, the proportional differences in
 the above specified points were incomparably less than in the
 full-grown birds. Some characteristic points of difference- for
 instance, that of the width of mouth- could hardly be detected in
 the young. But there was one remarkable exception to this rule, for
 the young of the short-faced tumbler differed from the young of the
 wild rock-pigeon and of the other breeds, in almost exactly the same
 proportions as in the adult state.
   </p><p>These facts are explained by the above two principles. Fanciers
 select their dogs, horses, pigeons, &amp;c., for breeding, when nearly
 grown up: they are indifferent whether the desired qualities are
 acquired earlier or later in life, if the full-grown animal
 possesses them. And the cases just given, more especially that of
 the pigeons, show that the characteristic differences which have
 been accumulated by man's selection, and which give value to his
 breeds, do not generally appear at a very early period of life, and
 are inherited at a corresponding not early period. But the case of the
 shortfaced tumbler, which when twelve hours old possessed its proper
 characters, proves that this is not the universal rule; for here the
 characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier
 period than usual, or, if not so, the differences must have been
 inherited, not at a corresponding, but at an earlier age.
   </p><p>Now let us apply these two principles to species in a state of
 nature. Let us take a group of birds, descended from some ancient
 form and modified through natural selection for different habits.
 Then, from the many slight successive variations having supervened
 in the several species at a not early age, and having been inherited
 at a corresponding age, the young will have been but little
 modified, and they will still resemble each other much more closely
 than do the adults,- just as we have seen with the breeds of the
 pigeon. We may extend this view to widely distinct structures and to
 whole classes. The fore-limbs, for instance, which once served as legs
 to a remote progenitor, may have become, through a long course of
 modification, adapted in one descendant to act as hands, in another as
 paddles, in another as wings; but on the above two principles the
 fore-limbs will not have been much modified in the embryos of these
 several forms; although in each form the fore-limb will differ greatly
 in the adult state. Whatever influence long-continued use or disuse
 may have had in modifying the limbs or other parts of any species,
 this will chiefly or solely have affected it when nearly mature,
 when it was compelled to use its full powers to gain its own living;
 and the effects thus produced will have been transmitted to the
 offspring at a corresponding nearly mature age. Thus the young will
 not be modified, or will be modified only in a slight degree,
 through the effects of the increased use or disuse of parts.
   </p><p>With some animals the successive variations may have supervened at a
 very early period of life, or the steps may have been inherited at
 an earlier age than that at which they first occurred. In either of
 these cases, the young or embryo will closely resemble the mature
 parent-form, as we have seen with the short-faced tumbler. And this is
 the rule of development in certain whole groups, or in certain
 sub-groups alone, as with cuttle-fish, land-shells, fresh-water
 crustaceans, spiders, and some members of the great class of
 insects. With respect to the final cause of the young in such groups
 not passing through any metamorphosis, we can see that this would
 follow from the following contingencies; namely, from the young having
 to provide at a very early age for their own wants, and from their
 following the same habits of life with their parents; for in this
 case, it would be indispensable for their existence that they should
 be modified in the same manner as their parents. Again, with respect
 to the singular fact that many terrestrial and fresh-water animals
 do not undergo any metamorphosis, whilst marine members of the same
 groups pass through various transformations, Fritz Muller has
 suggested that the process of slowly modifying and adapting an
 animal to live on the land or in fresh water, instead of in the sea,
 would be greatly simplified by its not passing through any larval
 stage; for it is not probable that places well adapted for both the
 larval and mature stages, under such new and greatly changed habits of
 life, would commonly be found unoccupied or ill-occupied by other
 organisms. In this case the gradual acquirement at an earlier and
 earlier age of the adult structure would be favoured by natural
 selection; and all traces of former metamorphoses would finally be
 lost.
   </p><p>If, on the other hand, it profited the young of an animal to
 follow habits of life slightly different from those of the
 parent-form, and consequently to be constructed on a slightly
 different plan, or if it profited a larva already different from its
 parent to change still further, then, on the principle of
 inheritance at corresponding ages, the young or the larvae might be
 rendered by natural selection more and more different from their
 parents to any conceivable extent. Differences in the larva might,
 also, become correlated with successive stages of its development;
 so that the larva, in the first stage might come to differ greatly
 from the larva in the second stage, as is the case with many
 animals. The adult might also become fitted for sites or habits, in
 which organs of locomotion or of the senses, &amp;c., would be useless;
 and in this case the metamorphosis would be retrograde.
   </p><p>From the remarks just made we can see how by changes of structure in
 the young, in conformity with changed habits of life, together with
 inheritance at corresponding ages, animals might come to pass
 through stages of development, perfectly distinct from the
 primordial condition of their adult progenitors. Most of our best
 authorities are now convinced that the various larval and pupal stages
 of insects have thus been acquired through adaptation, and not
 through inheritance from some ancient form. The curious case of
 Sitaris- a beetle which passes through certain unusual stages of
 development- will illustrate how this might occur. The first larval
 form is described by M. Fabre, as an active, minute insect,
 furnished with six legs, two long antennae, and four eyes. These
 larvae are hatched in the nests of bees; and when the male-bees emerge
 from their burrows, in the spring, which they do before the females,
 the larvae spring on them, and afterwards crawl on to the females
 whilst paired with the males. As soon as the female bee deposits her
 eggs on the surface of the honey stored in the cells, the larvas of
 the Sitaris leap on the eggs and devour them. Afterwards they
 undergo a complete change; their eyes disappear; their legs and
 antennae become rudimentary, and they feed on honey; so that they
 now more closely resemble the ordinary larvae of insects; ultimately
 they undergo a further transformation, and finally emerge as the
 perfect beetle. Now, if an insect, undergoing transformations like
 those of the Sitaris, were to become the progenitor of a whole new
 class of insects, the course of development of the new class would
 be widely different from that of our existing insects; and the first
 larval stage certainly would not represent the former condition of
 any adult and ancient form.
   </p><p>On the other hand it is highly probable that with many animals the
 embryonic or larval stages show us, more or less completely, the
 condition of the progenitor of the whole group in its adult state.
 In the great class of the Crustacea, forms wonderfully distinct from
 each other, namely, suctorial parasites, cirripedes, entomostraca, and
 even the malacostraca, appear at first as larvae under the
 nauplius-form; and as these larvae live and feed in the open sea,
 and are not adapted for any peculiar habits of life, and from other
 reasons assigned by Fritz Muller it is probable that at some very
 remote period an independent adult animal, resembling the nauplius,
 existed, and subsequently produced, along several divergent lines of
 descent, the above-named great crustacean groups. So again it is
 probable, from what we know of the embryos of mammals, birds,
 fishes, and reptiles, that these animals are the modified
 descendants of some ancient progenitor, which was furnished in its
 adult state with branchiae, a swimbladder, four finlike limbs, and a
 long tail, all fitted for an aquatic life.
   </p><p>As all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever
 lived, can be arranged within a few great classes; and as all within
 each class have, according to our theory, been connected together by
 fine gradations, the best, and, if our collections were nearly
 perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical; descent
 being the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking
 under the term of the Natural System. On this view we can understand
 how it is that, in the eyes of most naturalists, the structure of
 the embryo is even more important for classification than that of
 the adult. In two or more groups of animals, however much they may
 differ from each other in structure and habits in their adult
 condition, if they pass through closely similar embryonic stages, we
 may feel assured that they all are descended from one parent-form, and
 are therefore closely related. Thus, community in embryonic
 structure reveals community of descent; but dissimilarity in embryonic
 development does not prove discommunity of descent, for in one of
 two groups the developmental stages may have been suppressed, or may
 have been so greatly modified through adaptation to new habits of
 life, as to be no longer recognisable. Even in groups, in which the
 adults have been modified to an extreme degree, community of origin is
 often revealed by the structure of the larvae; we have seen, for
 instance, that cirripedes, though externally so like shell-fish, are
 at once known by their larvae to belong to the great class of
 crustaceans. As the embryo often shows us more or less plainly the
 structure of the less modified and ancient progenitor of the group, we
 can see why ancient and extinct forms so resemble in their adult state
 the embryos of existing species of the same class. Agassiz believes
 this to be a universal law of nature; and we may hope hereafter to see
 the law proved true. It can, however, be proved true only in those
 cases in which the ancient state of the progenitor of the group has
 not been wholly obliterated, either by successive variations having
 supervened at a very early period of growth, or by such variations
 having been inherited at an earlier age than that at which they
 first appeared. It should also be borne in mind, that the law may be
 true, but yet, owing to the geological record not extending far enough
 back in time, may remain for a long period, or for ever, incapable
 of demonstration. The law will not strictly hold good in those cases
 in which an ancient form became adapted in its larvae state to some
 special line of life, and transmitted the same larval state to a whole
 group of descendants; for such larvae will not resemble any still more
 ancient form in its adult state.
   </p><p>Thus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which
 are second to none in importance, are explained on the principle of
 variations in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor,
 having appeared at a not very early period of life, and having been
 inherited at a corresponding period. Embryology rises greatly in
 interest, when we look at the embryo as a picture, more or less
 obscured, of the progenitor, either in its adult or larval state, of
 all the members of the same great class.
 
 </p><h4>Rudimentary, Atrophied, and Aborted Organs</h4>
 
   <p>Organs or parts in this strange condition, bearing the plain stamp
 of inutility, are extremely common, or even general, throughout
 nature. It would be impossible to name one of the higher animals in
 which some part or other is not in a rudimentary condition. In the
 mammalia, for instance, the males possess rudimentary mammae; in
 snakes one lobe of the lungs is rudimentary; in birds the
 "bastardwing" may safely be considered as a rudimentary digit, and
 in some species the whole wing is so far rudimentary that it cannot be
 used for flight. What can be more curious than the presence of teeth
 in foetal whales, which when grown up have not a tooth in their heads;
 or the teeth, which never cut through the gums, in the upper jaws of
 unborn calves?
   </p><p>Rudimentary organs plainly declare their origin and meaning in
 various ways. There are beetles belonging to closely allied species,
 or even to the same identical species, which have either full-sized
 and perfect wings, or mere rudiments of membrane, which not rarely lie
 under wing-covers firmly soldered together; and in these cases it is
 impossible to doubt, that the rudiments represent wings. Rudimentary
 organs sometimes retain their potentiality: this occasionally occurs
 with the mammae of male mammals, which have been known to become
 well developed and to secrete milk. So again in the udders in the
 genus Bos, there are normally four developed and two rudimentary
 teats; but the latter in our domestic cows sometimes become well
 developed and yield milk. In regard to plants the petals are sometimes
 rudimentary, and sometimes well-developed in the individuals of the
 same species. In certain plants having separated sexes Kolreuter found
 that by crossing a species, in which the male flowers included a
 rudiment of a pistil, with an hermaphrodite species, having of
 course a well-developed pistil, the rudiment in the hybrid offspring
 was much increased in size; and this clearly shows that the
 rudimentary and perfect pistils are essentially alike in nature. An
 animal may possess various parts in a perfect state, and yet they
 may in one sense be rudimentary, for they are useless: thus the
 tadpole of the common salamander or water-newt, as Mr. G. H. Lewes
 remarks, "has gills, and passes its existence in the water; but the
 Salamandra atra, which lives high up among the mountains, brings forth
 its young full-formed. This animal never lives in the water. Yet if we
 open a gravid female, we find tadpoles inside her with exquisitely
 feathered gills; and when placed in water they swim about like the
 tadpoles of the water-newt. Obviously this aquatic organisation has no
 reference to the future life of the animal, nor has it any
 adaptation to its embryonic condition; it has solely reference to
 ancestral adaptations, it repeats a phase in the development of its
 progenitors."
   </p><p>An organ, serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or
 utterly aborted for one, even the more important purpose, and remain
 perfectly efficient for the other. Thus in plants, the office of the
 pistil is to allow the pollen-tubes to reach the ovules within the
 ovarium. The pistil consists of a stigma supported on a style; but
 in some Compositae, the male florets, which of course cannot be
 fecundated, have a rudimentary pistil, for it is not crowned with a
 stigma; but the style remains well developed and is clothed in the
 usual manner with hairs, which serve to brush the pollen out of the
 surrounding and conjoined anthers. Again, an organ may become
 rudimentary for its proper purpose, and be used for a distinct one: in
 certain fishes the swimbladder seems to be rudimentary for its
 proper function of giving buoyancy, but has become converted into a
 nascent breathing organ or lung. Many similar instances could be
 given.
   </p><p>Useful organs, however little they may be developed, unless we
 have reason to suppose that they were formerly more highly
 developed, ought not to be considered as rudimentary. They may be in a
 nascent condition, and in progress towards further development.
 Rudimentary organs, on the other hand, are either quite useless,
 such as teeth which never cut through the gums, or almost useless,
 such as the wings of an ostrich, which serve merely as sails. As
 organs in this condition would formerly, when still less developed,
 have been of even less use than at present, they cannot formerly
 have been produced through variation and natural selection, which acts
 solely by the preservation of useful modifications. They have been
 partially retained by the power of inheritance, and relate to a former
 state of things. It is, however, often difficult to distinguish
 between rudimentary and nascent organs; for we can judge only by
 analogy whether a part is capable of further development, in which
 case alone it deserves to be called nascent. Organs in this
 condition will always be somewhat rare; for beings thus provided
 will commonly have been supplanted by their successors with the same
 organ in a more perfect state, and consequently will have become
 long ago extinct. The wing of the penguin is of high service, acting
 as a fin; it may, therefore, represent the nascent state of the
 wing: not that I believe this to be the case; it is more probably a
 reduced organ, modified for a new function: the wing of the Apteryx,
 on the other hand, is quite useless, and is truly rudimentary. Owen
 considers the simple filamentary limbs of the lepidosiren as the
 "beginnings of organs which attain full functional development in
 higher vertebrates"; but, according to the view lately advocated by
 Dr. Gunther, they are probably remnants, consisting of the
 persistent axis of a fin, with the lateral rays of branches aborted.
 The mammary glands of the Ornithorhynchus may be considered, in
 comparison with the udders of a cow, as in a nascent condition. The
 ovigerous frena of certain cirripedes, which have ceased to give
 attachment to the ova and are feebly developed, are nascent branchiae.
   </p><p>Rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very
 liable to vary in the degree of their development and in other
 respects. In closely allied species, also, the extent to which the
 same organ has been reduced occasionally differs much. This latter
 fact is well exemplified in the state of the wings of female moths
 belonging to the same family. Rudimentary organs may be utterly
 aborted; and this implies, that in certain animals or plants, parts
 are entirely absent which analogy would lead us to expect to find in
 them, and which are occasionally found in monstrous individuals.
 Thus in most of the Scrophulariaceae the fifth stamen is utterly
 aborted; yet we may conclude that a fifth stamen once existed, for a
 rudiment of it is found in many species of the family, and this
 rudiment occasionally becomes perfectly developed, as may sometimes be
 seen in the common snap-dragon. In tracing the homologies of any
 part in different members of the same class, nothing is more common,
 or, in order fully to understand the relations of the parts, more
 useful than the discovery of rudiments. This is well shown in the
 drawings given by Owen of the leg-bones of the horse, ox, and
 rhinoceros.
   </p><p>It is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth in
 the upper jaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in the
 embryo, but afterwards wholly disappear. It is also, I believe, a
 universal rule, that a rudimentary part is of greater size in the
 embryo relatively to the adjoining parts, than in the adult; so that
 the organ at this early age is less rudimentary, or even cannot be
 said to be in any degree rudimentary. Hence rudimentary organs in
 the adult are often said to have retained their embryonic condition.
   </p><p>I have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary
 organs. In reflecting on them, every one must be struck with
 astonishment; for the same reasoning power which tells us that most
 parts and organs are exquisitely adapted for certain purposes, tells
 us with equal plainness that these rudimentary or atrophied organs are
 imperfect and useless. In works on natural history, rudimentary organs
 are generally said to have been created "for the sake of symmetry," or
 in order "to complete the scheme of nature." But this is not an
 explanation, merely a re-statement of the fact. Nor is it consistent
 with itself; thus the boa constrictor has rudiments of hind-limbs
 and of a pelvis, and if it be said that these bones have been retained
 "to complete the scheme of nature," why, as Professor Weismann asks,
 have they not been retained by other snakes, which do not possess even
 a vestige of these same bones? What would be thought of an
 astronomer who maintained that the satellites revolve in elliptic
 courses round their planets "for the sake of symmetry," because the
 planets thus revolve round the sun? An eminent physiologist accounts
 for the presence of rudimentary organs, by supposing that they serve
 to excrete matter in excess, or matter injurious to the system; but
 can we suppose that the minute papilla, which often represents the
 pistil in male flowers, and which is formed of mere cellular tissue,
 can thus act? Can we suppose that rudimentary teeth, which are
 subsequently absorbed, are beneficial to the rapidly growing embryonic
 calf by removing matter so precious as phosphate of lime? When a
 man's fingers have been amputated, imperfect nails have been known
 to appear on the stumps, and I could as soon believe that these
 vestiges of nails are developed in order to excrete horny matter, as
 that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee have been
 developed for this same purpose.
   </p><p>On the view of descent with modification, the origin of
 rudimentary organs is comparatively simple; and we can understand to a
 large extent the laws governing their imperfect development. We have
 plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our domestic productions,- as
 the stump of a tail in tailless breeds,- the vestige of an ear in
 earless breeds of sheep,- the reappearance of minute dangling horns in
 hornless breeds of cattle, more especially, according to Youatt, in
 young animals,- and the state of the whole flower in the
 cauliflower. We often see rudiments of various parts in monsters;
 but I doubt whether any of these cases throw light on the origin of
 rudimentary organs in a state of nature, further than by showing
 that rudiments can be produced; for the balance of evidence clearly
 indicates that species under nature do not undergo great and abrupt
 changes. But we learn from the study of our domestic productions
 that the disuse of parts leads to their reduced size; and that the
 result is inherited.
   </p><p>It appears probable that disuse has been the main agent in rendering
 organs rudimentary. It would at first lead by slow steps to the more
 and more complete reduction of a part, until at last it became
 rudimentary,- as in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark
 caverns, and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands, which
 have seldom been forced by beasts of prey to take flight, and have
 ultimately lost the power of flying. Again, an organ, useful under
 certain conditions, might become injurious under others, as with the
 wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands; and in this
 case natural selection will have aided in reducing the organ, until it
 was rendered harmless and rudimentary.
   </p><p>Any change in structure and function, which can be effected by small
 stages, is within the power of natural selection; so that an organ
 rendered, through changed habits of life, useless or injurious for
 one purpose, might be modified and used for another purpose. An
 organ might, also, be retained for one alone of its former
 functions. Organs, originally formed by the aid of natural
 selection, when rendered useless may well be variable, for their
 variations can no longer be cheeked by natural selection. All this
 agrees well with  </p><p>what we see under nature. Moreover, at whatever
 period of life either disuse or selection reduces an organ, and this
 will generally be when the being has come to maturity and has to exert
 its full powers of action, the principle of inheritance at
 corresponding ages will tend to reproduce the organ in its reduced
 state at the same mature age, but will seldom effect it in the embryo.
 Thus we can understand the greater size of rudimentary organs in the
 embryo relatively to the adjoining parts. and their lesser relative
 size in the adult. If, for instance, the digit of an adult animal
 was used less and less during many generations, owing to some change
 of habits, or if an organ or gland was less and less functionally
 exercised, we may infer that it would become reduced in size in the
 adult descendants of this animal, but would retain nearly its original
 standard of development in the embryo.
   </p><p>There remains, however, this difficulty. After an organ has ceased
 being used, and has become in consequence much reduced, how can it
 be still further reduced in size until the merest vestige is left; and
 how can it be finally quite obliterated? It is scarcely possible
 that disuse can go on producing any further effect after the organ has
 once been rendered functionless. Some additional explanation is here
 requisite which I cannot give. If, for instance, it could be proved
 that every part of the organisation tends to vary in a greater
 degree towards diminution than towards augmentation of size, then we
 should be able to understand how an organ which has become useless
 would be rendered, independently of the effects of disuse,
 rudimentary and would at last be wholly suppressed; for the variations
 towards diminished size would no longer be checked by natural
 selection. The principle of the economy of growth, explained in a
 former chapter, by which the materials forming any part, if not useful
 to the possessor, are saved as far as possible, will perhaps come into
 play in rendering a useless part rudimentary. But this principle
 will almost necessarily be confined to the earlier stages of the
 process of reduction; for we cannot suppose that a minute papilla, for
 instance, representing in a male flower the pistil of the female
 flower, and formed merely of cellular tissue, could be further
 reduced or absorbed for the sake of economising nutriment.
   </p><p>Finally, as rudimentary organs, by whatever steps they may have been
 degraded into their present useless condition, are the record of a
 former state of things, and have been retained solely through the
 power of inheritance,- we can understand, on the genealogical view
 of classification, how it is that systematists, in placing organisms
 in their proper places in the natural system, have often found
 rudimentary parts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than,
 parts of high physiological importance. Rudimentary organs may be
 compared with the letters in a word, still retained in the spelling,
 but become useless in the pronunciation, but which serve as a clue for
 its derivation. On the view of descent with modification, we may
 conclude that the existence of organs in a rudimentary, imperfect, and
 useless condition, or quite aborted, far from presenting a strange
 difficulty, as they assuredly do on the old doctrine of creation,
 might even have been anticipated in accordance with the views here
 explained.
 
 </p><h4>Summary</h4>
 
   <p>In this chapter I have attempted to show, that the arrangement of
 all organic beings throughout all time in groups under groups- that
 the nature of the relationships by which all living and extinct
 organisms are united by complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of
 affinities into a few grand classes,- the rules followed and the
 difficulties encountered by naturalists in their classifications,- the
 value set upon characters, if constant and prevalent, whether of
 high or of the most trifling importance, or, as with rudimentary
 organs, of no importance,- the wide opposition in value between
 analogical or adaptive characters, and characters of true affinity;
 and other such rules;- all naturally follow if we admit the common
 parentage of allied forms, together with their modification through
 variation and natural selection, with the contingencies of
 extinction and divergence of character. In considering this view of
 classification, it should be borne in mind that the element of descent
 has been universally used in ranking together the sexes, ages,
 dimorphic forms, and acknowledged varieties of the same species,
 however much they may differ from each other in structure. If we
 extend the use of this element of descent,- the one certainly known
 cause of similarity in organic beings,- we shall understand what is
 meant by the Natural System: it is genealogical in its attempted
 arrangement, with the grades of acquired difference marked by the
 terms, varieties, species, genera, families, orders, and classes.
   </p><p>On this same view of descent with modification, most of the great
 facts in Morphology become intelligible,- whether we look to the
 same pattern displayed by the different species of the same class in
 their homologous organs, to whatever purpose applied; or to the serial
 and lateral homologies in each individual animal and plant.
   </p><p>On the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily or
 generally supervening at a very early period of life, and being
 inherited at a corresponding period, we can understand the leading
 facts in Embryology; namely, the close resemblance in the individual
 embryo of the parts which are homologous, and which when matured
 become widely different in structure and function; and the resemblance
 of the homologous parts or organs in allied though distinct species,
 though fitted in the adult state for habits as different as is
 possible. Larvae are active embryos, which have been specially
 modified in a greater or less degree in relation to their habits of
 life, with their modifications inherited at a corresponding early age.
 On these same principles,- and bearing in mind that when organs are
 reduced in size, either from disuse or through natural selection, it
 will generally be at that period of life when the being has to provide
 for its own wants, and bearing in mind how strong is the force of
 inheritance- the occurrence of rudimentary organs might even have been
 anticipated. The importance of embryological characters and of
 rudimentary organs in classification is intelligible, on the view
 that a natural arrangement must be genealogical.
   </p><p>Finally, the several classes of facts which have been considered
 in this chapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the
 innumerable species, genera and families, with which this world is
 peopled, are all descended, each within its own class or group, from
 common parents, and have all been modified in the course of descent,
 that I should without hesitation adopt this view, even if it were
 unsupported by other facts or arguments.
