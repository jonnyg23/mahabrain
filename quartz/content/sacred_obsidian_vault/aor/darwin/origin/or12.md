 <h3>Chapter XII: Geographical Distribution</h3>
 
   <p>IN considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of
 the globe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that neither
 the similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various
 regions can be wholly accounted for by climatal and other physical
 conditions. Of late, almost every author who has studied the subject
 has come to this conclusion. The case of America alone would almost
 suffice to prove its truth; for if we exclude the arctic and
 northern temperate parts, all authors agree that one of the most
 fundamental divisions in geographical distribution is that between the
 New and Old Worlds; yet if we travel over the vast American continent,
 from the central parts of the United States to its extreme southern
 point, we meet with the most diversified conditions; humid
 districts, arid deserts, lofty mountains, grassy plains, forests,
 marshes, lakes, and great rivers, under almost every temperature.
 There is hardly a climate or condition in the Old World which cannot
 be paralleled in the New- at least as closely as the same species
 generally require. No doubt small areas can be pointed out in the
 Old World hotter than any in the New World; but these are not
 inhabited by a fauna different from that of the surrounding
 districts; for it is rare to find a group of organisms confined to a
 small area, of which the conditions are peculiar in only a slight
 degree. Notwithstanding this general parallelism in the conditions
 of the Old and New Worlds, how widely different are their living
 productions!
   </p><p>In the southern hemisphere, if we compare large tracts of land in
 Australia, South Africa, and western South America, between
 latitudes 25 and 35, we shall find parts extremely similar in all
 their conditions, yet it would not be possible to point out three
 faunas and floras more utterly dissimilar. Or, again, we may compare
 the productions of South America south of lat. 35 with those north
 of 25, which consequently are separated by a space of ten degrees of
 latitude, and are exposed to considerably different conditions; yet
 they are incomparably more closely related to each other than they are
 to the productions of Australia or Africa under nearly the same
 climate. Analogous facts could be given with respect to the
 inhabitants of the sea.
   </p><p>A second great fact which strikes us in our general review is,
 that barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related
 in a close and important manner to the differences between the
 productions of various regions. We see this in the great difference in
 nearly all the terrestrial productions of the New and Old Worlds,
 excepting in the northern parts, where the land almost joins, and
 where, under a slightly different climate, there might have been
 free migration for the northern temperate forms, as there now is for
 the strictly arctic productions. We see the same fact in the great
 difference between the inhabitants of Australia, Africa, and South
 America under the same latitude; for these countries are almost as
 much isolated from each other as is possible. On each continent, also,
 we see the same fact; for on the opposite sides of lofty and
 continuous mountain-ranges, of great deserts and even of large rivers,
 we find different productions; though as mountain-chains, deserts,
 &amp;c., are not as impassable, or likely to have endured so long, as
 the oceans separating continents, the differences are very inferior in
 degree to those characteristic of distinct continents.
   </p><p>Turning to the sea, we find the same law. The marine inhabitants
 of the eastern and western shores of South America are very
 distinct, with extremely few shells, Crustacea, or Echinodermata in
 common; but Dr. Gunther has recently shown that about thirty per cent.
 of the fishes are the same on the opposite sides of the isthmus of
 Panama; and this fact has led naturalists to believe that the
 isthmus was formerly open. Westward of the shores of America, a wide
 space of open ocean extends, with not an island as a halting-place for
 emigrants; here we have a barrier of another kind, and as soon as this
 is passed we meet in the eastern islands of the Pacific with another
 and totally distinct fauna. So that three marine faunas range far
 northward and southward in parallel lines not far from each other,
 under corresponding climates; but from being separated from each other
 by impassable barriers, either of land or open sea, they are almost
 wholly distinct. On the other hand, proceeding still farther
 westward from the eastern islands of the tropical parts of the
 Pacific, we encounter no impassable barriers, and we have
 innumerable islands as halting-places, or continuous coasts, until,
 after travelling over a hemisphere, we come to the shores of Africa;
 and over this vast space we meet with no well-defined and distinct
 marine faunas. Although so few marine animals are common to the
 above-named three approximate faunas of eastern and western America
 and the eastern Pacific islands, yet many fishes range from the
 Pacific into the Indian Ocean, and many shells are common to the
 eastern islands of the Pacific and the eastern shores of Africa on
 almost exactly opposite meridians of longitude.
   </p><p>A third great fact, partly included in the foregoing statement, is
 the affinity of the productions of the same continent or of the same
 sea, though the species themselves are distinct at different points
 and stations. It is a law of the widest generality, and every
 continent offers innumerable instances. Nevertheless the naturalist,
 in travelling, for instance, from north to south, never fails to be
 struck by the manner in which successive groups of beings,
 specifically distinct, though nearly related, replace each other. He
 hears from closely allied, yet distinct kinds of birds, notes nearly
 similar, and sees their nests similarly constructed, but not quite
 alike, with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner. The plains near
 the Straits of Magellan are inhabited by one species of Rhea (American
 ostrich) and northward the plains of La Plata by another species of
 the same genus; and not by a true ostrich or emu, like those
 inhabiting Africa and Australia under the same latitude. On these
 same plains of La Plata we see the agouti and bizcacha, animals having
 nearly the same habits as our hares and rabbits, and belonging to
 the same order of rodents, but they plainly display an American type
 of structure. We ascend the lofty peaks of the Cordillera, and we find
 an alpine species of bizcacha; we look to the waters, and we do not
 find the beaver or musk-rat, but the coypu and capybara, rodents of
 the S. American type. Innumerable other instances could be given. If
 we look to the islands off the American shore, however much they may
 differ in geological structure, the inhabitants are essentially
 American, though they may be all peculiar species. We may look back to
 past ages, as shown in the last chapter, and we find American types
 then prevailing on the American continent and in the American seas. We
 see in these facts some deep organic bond, throughout space and
 time, over the same areas of land and water, independently of physical
 conditions. The naturalist must be dull who is not led to enquire
 what this bond is.
   </p><p>The bond is simply inheritance, that cause which alone, as far as we
 positively know, produces organisms quite like each other, or, as we
 see in the case of varieties, nearly alike. The dissimilarity of the
 inhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification
 through variation and natural selection, and probably in a subordinate
 degree to the definite influence of different physical conditions. The
 degrees of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the more
 dominant forms of life from one region into another having been more
 or less effectually prevented, at periods more or less remote;- on the
 nature and number of the former immigrants;- and on the action of
 the inhabitants on each other in leading to the preservation of
 different modifications; the relation of organism to organism in the
 struggle for life being, as I have already often remarked, the most
 important of all relations. Thus the high importance of barriers
 comes into play by checking migration; as does time for the slow
 process of modification through natural selection. Widely-ranging
 species, abounding in individuals, which have already triumphed over
 many competitors in their own widely-extended homes, will have the
 best chance of seizing on new places, when they spread into new
 countries. In their new homes they will be exposed to new
 conditions, and will frequently undergo further modification and
 improvement; and thus they will become still further victorious, and
 will produce groups of modified descendants. On this principle of
 inheritance with modification we can understand how it is that
 sections of genera, whole genera, and even families, are confined to
 the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.
   </p><p>There is no evidence, as was remarked in the last chapter, of the
 existence of any law of necessary development. As the variability of
 each species is an independent property, and will be taken advantage
 of by natural selection, only so far as it profits each individual
 in its complex struggle for life, so the amount of modification in
 different species will be no uniform quantity. If a number of species,
 after having long competed with each other in their old home, were
 to migrate in a body into a new and afterwards isolated country,
 they would be little liable to modification; for neither migration nor
 isolation in themselves effect anything. These principles come into
 play only by bringing organisms into new relations with each other and
 in a lesser degree with the surrounding physical conditions. As we
 have seen in the last chapter that some forms have retained nearly the
 same character from an enormously remote geological period, so certain
 species have migrated over vast spaces, and have not become greatly or
 at all modified.
   </p><p>According to these views, it is obvious that the several species
 of the same genus, though inhabiting the most distant quarters of
 the world, must originally have proceeded from the same source, as
 they are descended from the same progenitor. In the case of those
 species which have undergone during the whole geological periods
 little modification, there is not much difficulty in believing that
 they have migrated from, the same region; for during the vast
 geographical and climatal changes which have supervened since
 ancient times, almost any amount of migration is possible. But in many
 other cases, in which we have reason to believe that the species of
 a genus have been produced within comparatively recent times, there is
 great difficulty on this head. It is also obvious that the
 individuals of the same species, though now inhabiting distant and
 isolated regions, must have proceeded from one spot, where their
 parents were first produced: for, as has been explained, it is
 incredible that individuals identically the same should have been
 produced from parents specifically distinct.
   </p><p>Single Centres of supposed Creation.- We are thus brought to the
 question which has been largely discussed by naturalists, namely,
 whether species have been created at one or more points of the earth's
 surface. Undoubtedly there are many cases of extreme difficulty in
 understanding how the same species could possibly have migrated from
 some one point to the several distant and isolated points, where now
 found. Nevertheless the simplicity of the view that each species was
 first produced within a single region captivates the mind. He who
 rejects it, rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation with
 subsequent migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle. It is
 universally admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a
 species is continuous; and that when a plant or animal inhabits two
 points so distant from each other, or with an interval of such a
 nature, that the space could not have been easily passed over by
 migration, the fact is given as something remarkable and
 exceptional. The incapacity of migrating across a wide sea is more
 clear in the case of terrestrial mammals than perhaps with any other
 organic beings; and, accordingly, we find no inexplicable instances of
 the same mammals inhabiting distant points of the world. No
 geologist feels any difficulty in Great Britain possessing the same
 quadrupeds with the rest of Europe, for they were no doubt once
 united. But if the same species can be produced at two separate
 points, why do we not find a single mammal common to Europe and
 Australia or South America? The conditions of life are nearly the
 same, so that a multitude of European animals and plants have become
 naturalised in America and Australia; and some of the aboriginal
 plants are identically the same at these distant points of the
 northern and southern hemispheres. The answer, as I believe, is,
 that mammals have not been able to migrate, whereas some plants,
 from their varied means of dispersal, have migrated across the wide
 and broken interspaces. The great and striking influence of barriers
 of all kinds, is intelligible only on the view that the great majority
 of species have been produced on one side, and have not been able to
 migrate to the opposite side. Some few families, many sub-families,
 very many genera, and a still greater number of sections of genera,
 are confined to a single region; and it has been observed by several
 naturalists that the most natural genera, or those genera in which the
 species are most closely related to each other, are generally confined
 to the same, country, or if they have a wide range that their range is
 continuous. What a strange anomaly it would be, if a directly
 opposite rule were to prevail, when we go down one step lower in the
 series, namely, to the individuals of the same species, and these
 had not been, at least at first, confined to some one region!
   </p><p>Hence it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that
 the view of each species having been produced in one area alone, and
 having subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of
 migration and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted,
 is the most probable. Undoubtedly many cases occur, in which we cannot
 explain how the same species could have passed from one point to the
 other. But the geographical and climatal changes which have
 certainly occurred within recent geological times, must have
 rendered discontinuous the formerly continuous range of many
 species. So that we are reduced to consider whether the exceptions
 to continuity of range are so numerous and of so grave a nature,
 that we ought to give up the belief, rendered probable by general
 considerations, that each species has been produced within one area,
 and has migrated thence as far as it could. It would be hopelessly
 tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same species,
 now living at distant and separated points, nor do I for a moment
 pretend that any explanation could be offered of many instances.
 But, after some preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of the
 most striking classes of facts; namely, the existence of the same
 species on the summits of distant mountain ranges, and at distant
 points in the arctic and antarctic regions; and secondly (in the
 following chapter), the wide distribution of fresh-water
 productions; and thirdly, the occurrence of the same terrestrial
 species on islands and on the nearest mainland, though separated by
 hundreds of miles of open sea. If the existence of the same species at
 distant and isolated points of the earth's surface, can in many
 instances be explained on the view of each species having migrated
 from a single birthplace; then, considering our ignorance with respect
 to former climatal and geographical changes and to the various
 occasional means of transport, the belief that a single birthplace
 is the law, seems to me incomparably the safest.
   </p><p>In discussing this subject, we shall be enabled at the same time
 to consider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the
 several species of a genus which must on our theory all be descended
 from a common progenitor, can have migrated, undergoing modification
 during their migration, from some one area. If, when most of the
 species inhabiting one region are different from those of another
 region, though closely allied to them, it can be shown that
 migration from the one region to the other has probably occurred at
 some former period, our general view will be much strengthened; for
 the explanation is obvious on the principle of descent with
 modification. A volcanic island, for instance, upheaved and formed
 at the distance of a few hundreds of miles from a continent, would
 probably receive from it in the course of time a few colonists, and
 their descendants, though modified, would still be related by
 inheritance to the inhabitants of that continent. Cases of this nature
 are common, and are, as we shall hereafter see, inexplicable on the
 theory of independent creation. This view of the relation of the
 species of one region to those of another, does not differ much from
 that advanced by Mr. Wallace, who concludes that "every species has
 come into existence coincident both in space and time with a
 pre-existing closely allied species." And it is now well known that he
 attributes this coincidence to descent with modification.
   </p><p>The question of single or multiple centres of creation differs
 from another though allied question,- namely, whether all the
 individuals of the same species are descended from a single pair, or
 single hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many
 individuals simultaneously created. With organic beings which never
 intercross, if such exist, each species must be descended from a
 succession of modified varieties, that have supplanted each other, but
 have never blended with other individuals or varieties of the same
 species; so that, at each successive stage of modification, all the
 individuals of the same form will be descended from a single parent.
 But in the great majority of cases, namely, with all organisms which
 habitually unite for each birth, or which occasionally intercross, the
 individuals of the same species inhabiting the same area will be
 kept nearly uniform by intercrossing; so that many individuals will go
 on simultaneously changing, and the whole amount of modification at
 each stage will not be due to descent from a single parent. To
 illustrate what I mean: our English race-horses differ from the horses
 of every other breed; but they do not owe their difference and
 superiority to descent from any single pair, but to continued care
 in the selecting and training of many individuals during each
 generation.
   </p><p>Before discussing the three classes of facts, which I have
 selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory
 of "single centres of creation," I must say a few words on the means
 of dispersal.
 
 </p><h4>Means of Dispersal</h4>
 
   <p>Sir C. Lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject. I can
 give here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts.
 Change of climate must have had a powerful influence on migration. A
 region now impassable to certain organisms from the nature of its
 climate, might have been a high road for migration, when the climate
 was different. I shall, however, presently have to discuss this branch
 of the subject in some detail. Changes of level in the land must
 also have been highly influential: a narrow isthmus now separates
 two marine faunas; submerge it, or let it formerly have been
 submerged, and the two faunas will now blend together, or may formerly
 have blended. Where the sea now extends, land may at a former period
 have connected islands or possibly even continents together, and
 thus have allowed terrestrial productions to pass from one to the
 other No geologist disputes that great mutations of level have
 occurred within the period of existing organisms. Edward Forbes
 insisted that all the islands in the Atlantic must have been
 recently connected with Europe or Africa, and Europe likewise with
 America. Other authors have thus hypothetically bridged over every
 ocean, and united almost every island with some mainland. If indeed
 the arguments used by Forbes are to be trusted, it must be admitted
 that scarcely a single island exists which has not recently been
 united to some continent. This view cuts the Gordian knot of the
 dispersal of the same species to the more distant points, and
 removes many a difficulty; but to the best of my judgment we are not
 authorised in admitting such enormous geographical changes within
 the period of existing species. It seems to me that we have abundant
 evidence of great oscillations in the level of the land or sea; but
 not of such vast change in the position and extension of our
 continents, as to have united them within the recent period to each
 other and to the several intervening oceanic islands. I freely admit
 the former existence of many islands, now buried beneath the sea,
 which may have served as halting-places for plants and for many
 animals during their migration. In the coral-producing oceans such
 sunken islands are now marked by rings of coral or atolls standing
 over them. Whenever it is fully admitted, as it will some day be, that
 each species has proceeded from a single birthplace, and when in the
 course of time we know something definite about the means of
 distribution, we shall be enabled to speculate with security on the
 former extension of the land. But I do not believe that it will ever
 be proved that within the recent period most of our continents which
 now stand quite separate have been continuously, or almost
 continuously united with each other, and with the many existing
 oceanic islands. Several facts in distribution,- such as the great
 difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost
 every continent,- the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of
 several lands and even seas to their present inhabitants,- the
 degree of affinity between the mammals inhabiting islands with those
 of the nearest continent, being in part determined (as we shall
 hereafter see) by the depth of the intervening ocean,- these and other
 such facts are opposed to the admission of such prodigious
 geographical revolutions within the recent period, as are necessary on
 the view advanced by Forbes and admitted by his followers. The
 nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants of oceanic
 islands are likewise opposed to the belief of their former
 continuity with continents. Nor does the almost universally volcanic
 composition of such islands favour the admission that they are the
 wrecks of sunken continents;- if they had originally existed as
 continental mountain ranges, some at least of the islands would have
 been formed, like other mountain summits, of granite, metamorphic
 schists, old fossiliferous and other rocks, instead of consisting of
 mere piles of volcanic matter.
   </p><p>I must now say a few words on what are called accidental means,
 but which more properly should be called occasional means of
 distribution. I shall here confine myself to plants. In botanical
 works, this or that plant is often stated to be ill adapted for wide
 dissemination; but the greater or less facilities for transport across
 the sea may be said to be almost wholly unknown. Until I tried, with
 Mr. Berkeley's aid, a few experiments, it was not even known how far
 seeds could resist the injurious action of sea-water. To my surprise I
 found that out of 87 kinds, 64 germinated after an immersion of 28
 days, and a few survived an immersion of 137 days. It deserves
 notice that certain orders were far more injured than others: nine
 leguminosae were tried, and, with one exception, they resisted the
 salt-water badly; seven species of the allied orders,
 Hydrophyllaceae and Polemoniacae, were all killed by a month's
 immersion. For convenience' sake I chiefly tried small seeds without
 the capsule or fruit; and as all of these sank in a few days they
 could not have been floated across wide spaces of the sea, whether
 or not they were injured by the salt-water. Afterwards I tried some
 larger fruits, capsules, &amp;c., and some of these floated for a long
 time. It is well known what a difference there is in the buoyancy of
 green and seasoned timber; and it occurred to me that floods would
 often wash into the sea dried plants or branches with seed-capsules or
 fruit attached to them. Hence I was led to dry the stems and
 branches of 94 plants with ripe fruit, and to place them on sea-water.
 The majority sank rapidly, but some which, whilst green, floated for a
 short time, when dried floated much longer; for instance, ripe
 hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried they floated for 90
 days, and afterwards when planted germinated; an asparagus-plant
 with ripe berries floated for 23 days, when dried it floated for 85
 days, and the seeds afterwards germinated; the ripe seeds of
 Helosciadium sank in two days, when dried they floated for above 90
 days, and afterwards germinated. Altogether, out of the 94 dried
 plants, 18 floated for above 28 days; and some of the 18 floated for a
 very much longer period. So that as 64/87 kinds of seeds germinated
 after an immersion of 28 days; and as 18/94 distinct species with ripe
 fruit (but not all the same species as in the foregoing experiment)
 floated, after being dried, for above 28 days, we may conclude, as far
 as anything can be inferred from these scanty facts, that the seeds of
 14/100 kinds of plants of any country might be floated by sea currents
 during 28 days, and would retain their power of germination. In
 Johnston's Physical Atlas, the average rate of the several Atlantic
 currents is 33 miles per diem (some currents running at the rate of
 miles per diem); on this average, the seeds of 14/100 plants belonging
 to one country might be floated across 924 miles of sea to another
 country, and when stranded, if blown by an inland gale to a favourable
 spot, would germinate.
   </p><p>Subsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones, but
 in a much better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the
 actual sea, so that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air
 like really floating plants. He tried 98 seeds, mostly different
 from mine; but he chose many large fruits and likewise seeds from
 plants which live near the sea; and this would have favoured both
 the average length of their flotation and their resistance to the
 injurious action of the salt-water. On the other hand, he did not
 previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit; and this, as
 we have seen, would have caused some of them to have floated much
 longer. The result was that 18/98ths of his seeds of different kinds
 floated for 42 days, and were then capable of germination. But I do
 not doubt that plants exposed to the waves would float for a less time
 than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments.
 Therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the seeds of
 about 10/100 plants of a flora, after having been dried, could be
 floated across a space of sea 900 miles in width, and would then
 germinate. The fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than
 the small, is interesting; as plants with large seeds or fruit
 which, as Alph. de Candolle has shown, generally have restricted
 ranges, could hardly be transported by any other means.
   </p><p>Seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. Drift
 timber is thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of the
 widest oceans; and the natives of the coral islands in the Pacific
 procure stones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted
 trees, these stones being a valuable royal tax. I find that when
 irregularly shaped are embedded in the roots of trees, small parcels
 of earth are frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind
 them,- so perfectly that not a particle could be washed away during
 the longest transport: out of one small portion of earth thus
 completely enclosed by the roots of an oak about 50 years old, three
 dicotyledonous plants germinated: I am certain of the accuracy of this
 observation. Again, I can show that the carcases of birds, when
 floating on the sea, sometimes escape being immediately devoured:
 and many kinds of seeds in the crops of floating birds long retain
 their vitality: peas and vetches, for instance, are killed by even a
 few days' immersion in sea-water; but some taken out of the crop of
 a pigeon, which had floated on artificial sea-water for 30 days, to my
 surprise nearly all germinated.
   </p><p>Living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the
 transportation of seeds. I could give many facts showing how
 frequently birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances
 across the ocean. We may safely assume that under such circumstances
 their rate of flight would often be 35 miles an hour; and some authors
 have given a far higher estimate. I have never seen an instance of
 nutritious seeds passing through the intestines of a bird, but hard
 seeds of fruit pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a
 turkey. In the course of two months, I picked up in my garden 12 kinds
 of seeds, out of the excrement of small birds, and these seemed
 perfect, and some of them, which were tried, germinated. But the
 following fact is more important: the crops of birds do not secrete
 gastric juice, and do not, as I know by trial, injure in the least the
 germination of seeds; now, after a bird has found and devoured a large
 supply of food, it is positively asserted that all the grains do not
 pass into the gizzard for twelve or even eighteen hours. A bird in
 this interval might easily be blown to the distance of 500 miles,
 and hawks are known to look out for tired birds, and the contents of
 their torn crops might thus readily get scattered. Some hawks and owls
 bolt their prey whole, and, after an interval of from twelve to twenty
 hours, disgorge pellets, which, as I know from experiments made in the
 Zoological Gardens, include seeds capable of germination. Some seeds
 of the oat, wheat, millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated
 after having been from twelve to twenty-one hours in the stomachs of
 different birds of prey; and two seeds of beet grew after having
 been thus retained for two days and fourteen hours. Fresh-water
 fish, I find, eat seeds of many land and water plants; fish are
 frequently devoured by birds, and thus the seeds might be
 transported from place to place. I forced many kinds of seeds into the
 stomachs of dead fish, and then gave their bodies to fishing-eagles,
 storks, and pelicans; these birds, after an interval of many hours,
 either rejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their
 excrement; and several of these seeds retained the power of
 germination. Certain seeds, however, were always killed by this
 process.
   </p><p>Locusts are sometimes blown to great distances from the land; I
 myself caught one 370 miles from the coast of Africa, and have heard
 of others caught at greater distances. The Rev. R. T. Lowe informed
 Sir C. Lyell that in November, 1844, swarms of locusts visited the
 island of Madeira. They were in countless numbers, as thick as the
 flakes of snow in the heaviest snowstorm, and extended upwards as
 far as could be seen with a telescope. During two or three days they
 slowly careered round and round in an immense ellipse, at least five
 or six miles in diameter, and at night alighted on the taller trees,
 which were completely coated with them. They then disappeared over the
 sea, as suddenly as they had appeared, and have not since visited
 the island. Now, in parts of Natal it is believed by some farmers,
 though on insufficient evidence, that injurious seeds are introduced
 into their grass-land in the dung left by the great flights of locusts
 which often visit that country. In consequence of this belief Mr.
 Weale sent me in a letter a small packet of the dried pellets, out
 of which I extracted under the microscope several seeds, and raised
 from them seven grass plants, belonging to two species, of two genera.
 Hence a swarm of locusts, such as that which visited Madeira, might
 readily be the means of introducing several kinds of plants into an
 island lying far from the mainland.
   </p><p>Although the beaks and feet of birds are generally clean, earth
 sometimes adheres to them: in one case I removed sixty-one grains, and
 in another case twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from the
 foot of a partridge, and in the earth there was a pebble as large as
 the seed of a vetch. Here is a better case: the leg of a woodcock
 was sent to me by a friend, with a little cake of dry earth attached
 to the shank, weighing only nine grains; and this contained a seed
 of the toad-rush (Juncus bufonius) which germinated and flowered.
 Mr. Swaysland, of Brighton, who during the last forty years has paid
 close attention to our migratory birds, informs me that he has often
 shot wagtails (Motacillae), wheat-ears, and whinchats (Saxicolae),
 on their first arrival on our shores, before they had alighted; and he
 has several times noticed little cakes of earth attached to their
 feet. Many facts could be given showing how generally soil is
 charged with seeds. For instance, Prof. Newton sent me the leg of a
 red-legged partridge (Caccabis rufa) which had been wounded and
 could not fly, with a ball of hard earth adhering to it, and
 weighing six and a half ounces. The earth had been kept for three
 years, but when broken, watered and placed under a bell glass, no less
 than 82 plants sprung from it: these consisted of 12 monocotyledons,
 including the common oat, and at least one kind of grass, and of 70
 dicotyledons, which consisted, judging from the young leaves, of at
 least three distinct species. With such facts before us, can we
 doubt that the many birds which are annually blown by gales across
 great spaces of ocean, and which annually migrate- for instance, the
 millions of quails across the Mediterranean- must occasionally
 transport a few seeds embedded in dirt adhering to their feet or
 beaks? But I shall have to recur to this subject.
   </p><p>As icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and
 stones, and have even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a
 land-bird, it can hardly be doubted that they must occasionally, as
 suggested by Lyell, have transported seeds from one part to another of
 the arctic and antarctic regions; and during the Glacial period from
 one part of the now temperate regions to another. In the Azores,
 from the large number of plants common to Europe, in comparison with
 the species on the other islands of the Atlantic, which stand nearer
 to the mainland, and (as remarked by Mr. H. C. Watson) from their
 somewhat northern character in comparison with the latitude, I
 suspected that these islands had been partly stocked by ice-borne
 seeds, during the Glacial epoch. At my request Sir C. Lyell wrote to
 M. Hartung to inquire whether he had observed erratic boulders on
 these islands, and he answered that he had found large fragments of
 granite and other rocks, which do not occur in the archipelago.
 Hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landed their rocky
 burthens on the shores of these mid-ocean islands and it is at least
 possible that they may have brought thither some few seeds of
 northern plants.
   </p><p>Considering that these several means of transport, and that other
 means, which without doubt remain to be discovered, have been in
 action year after year for tens of thousands of years, it would, I
 think, be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become
 widely transported. These means of transport are sometimes called
 accidental, but this is not strictly correct: the currents of the
 sea are not accidental, nor is the direction of prevalent gales of
 wind. It should be observed that scarcely any means of transport would
 carry seeds for very great distances: for seeds do not retain their
 vitality when exposed for a great length of time to the action of
 sea-water; nor could they be long carried in the crops or intestines
 of birds. These means, however, would suffice for occasional transport
 across tracts of sea some hundred miles in breadth, or from island
 to island, or from a continent to a neighbouring island, but not
 from one distant continent to another. The floras of distant
 continents would not by such means become mingled; but would remain as
 distinct as they now are. The currents, from their course, would never
 bring seeds from North America to Britain, though they might and do
 bring seeds from the West Indies to our western shores, where, if
 not killed by their very long immersion in salt water, they could
 not endure our climate. Almost every year, one or two land-birds are
 blown across the whole Atlantic Ocean, from North America to the
 western shores of Ireland and England; but seeds could be
 transported by these rare wanderers only by one means, namely, by
 dirt adhering to their feet or beaks, which is in itself a rare
 accident. Even in this case, how small would be the chance of a seed
 falling on favourable soil, and coming to maturity! But it would be
 a great error to argue that because a well-stocked island, like
 Great Britain, has not, as far as is known (and it would be very
 difficult to prove this), received within the last few centuries,
 through occasional means of transport, immigrants from Europe or any
 other continent, that a poorly-stocked island, though standing more
 remote from the mainland, would not receive colonists by similar
 means. Out of a hundred kinds of seeds or animals transported to an
 island, even if far less well-stocked than Britain, perhaps not more
 than one would be so well fitted to its new home, as to become
 naturalised. But this is no valid argument against what would be
 effected by occasional means of transport, during the long lapse of
 geological time, whilst the island was being upheaved, and before it
 had become fully stocked with inhabitants. On almost bare land, with
 few or no destructive insects or birds living there, nearly every seed
 which chanced to arrive, if fitted for the climate, would germinate
 and survive.
 
 </p><h4>Dispersal during the Glacial Period</h4>
 
   <p>The identity of many plants and animals, on mountain-summits,
 separated from each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands, where
 Alpine species could not possibly exist, is one of the most striking
 cases known of the same species living at distant points without the
 apparent possibility of their having migrated from one point to the
 other. It is indeed a remarkable fact to see so many plants of the
 same species living on the snowy regions of the Alps or Pyrenees,
 and in the extreme northern parts of Europe; but it is far more
 remarkable, that the plants on the White Mountains, in the United
 States of America, are all the same with those of Labrador, and
 nearly all the same, as we hear from Asa Gray, with those on the
 loftiest mountains of Europe. Even as long ago as 1747, such facts led
 Gmelin to conclude that the same species must have been
 independently created at many distinct points; and we might have
 remained in this same belief, had not Agassiz and others called
 vivid attention to the Glacial period, which, as we shall
 immediately see, affords a simple explanation of these facts. We
 have evidence of almost every conceivable kind, organic and inorganic,
 that, within a very recent geological period, central Europe and North
 America suffered under an arctic climate. The ruins of a house burnt
 by fire do not tell their tale more plainly than do the mountains of
 Scotland and Wales, with their scored flanks, polished surfaces, and
 perched boulders, of the icy streams with which their valleys were
 lately filled. So greatly has the climate of Europe changed, that in
 northern Italy, gigantic moraines, left by old glaciers, are now
 clothed by the vine and maize. Throughout a large part of the United
 States, erratic boulders and scored rocks plainly reveal a former cold
 period.
   </p><p>The former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of
 the inhabitants of Europe, as explained by Edward Forbes, is
 substantially as follows. But we shall follow the changes more
 readily, by supposing a new glacial period slowly to come on, and then
 pass away, as formerly occurred. As the cold came on, and as each more
 southern zone became fitted for the inhabitants of the north, these
 would take the places of the former inhabitants of the temperate
 regions. The latter, at the same time, would travel further and
 further southward, unless they were stopped by barriers, in which case
 they would perish. The mountains would become covered with snow and
 ice, and their former Alpine inhabitants would descend to the
 plains. By the time that the cold had reached its maximum, we should
 have an arctic fauna and flora, covering the central parts of
 Europe, as far south as the Alps and Pyrenees, and even stretching
 into Spain. The now temperate regions of the United States would
 likewise be covered by arctic plants and animals and these would be
 nearly the same with those of Europe; for the present circumpolar
 inhabitants, which we suppose to have everywhere travelled
 southward, are remarkably uniform round the world.
   </p><p>As the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward,
 closely followed up in their retreat by the productions of the more
 temperate regions. And as the snow melted from the bases of the
 mountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed
 ground, always ascending, as the warmth increased and the snow still
 further disappeared, higher and higher, whilst their brethren were
 pursuing their northern journey. Hence, when the warmth had fully
 returned, the same species, which had lately lived together on the
 European and North American lowlands, would again be found in the
 arctic regions of the Old and New Worlds, and on many isolated
 mountain-summits far distant from each other.
   </p><p>Thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so
 immensely remote as the mountains of the United States and those of
 Europe. We can thus also understand the fact that the Alpine plants of
 each mountain range are more especially related to the arctic forms
 living due north or nearly due north of them: for the first
 migration when the cold came on, and the re-migration on the returning
 warmth, would generally have been due south and north. The Alpine
 plants, for example, of Scotland, as remarked by Mr. H. C. Watson,
 and those of the Pyrenees, as remarked by Ramond, are more
 especially allied to the plants of northern Scandinavia; those of
 the United States to Labrador; those of the mountains of Siberia to
 the arctic regions of that country. These views, grounded as they
 are on the perfectly well-ascertained occurrence of a former Glacial
 period, seem to me to explain in so satisfactory a manner the
 present distribution of the Alpine and arctic productions of Europe
 and America, that when in other regions we find the same species on
 distant mountain-summits, we may almost conclude, without other
 evidence, that a colder climate formerly permitted their migration
 across the intervening lowlands, now become too warm for their
 existence.
   </p><p>As the arctic forms moved first southward and afterwards backwards
 to the north, in unison with the changing climate, they will not
 have been exposed during their long migration to any great diversity
 of temperature; and as they all migrated in a body together, their
 mutual relations will not have been much disturbed. Hence, in
 accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume, these
 forms will not have been liable to much modification. But with the
 Alpine productions, left isolated from the moment of the returning
 warmth, first at the bases and ultimately on the summits of the
 mountains, the case will have been somewhat different; for it is not
 likely that all the same arctic species will have been left on
 mountain ranges far distant from each other, and have survived there
 ever since; they will also in all probability, have become mingled
 with ancient Alpine species, which must have existed on the
 mountains before the commencement of the Glacial epoch, and which
 during the coldest period will have been temporarily driven down to
 the plains; they will, also, have been subsequently exposed to
 somewhat different climatal influences. Their mutual relations will
 thus have been in some degree disturbed; consequently they will have
 been liable to modification; and they have been modified; for if we
 compare the present Alpine plants and animals of the several great
 European mountain ranges one with another, though many of the
 species remain identically the same, some exist as varieties, some
 as doubtful forms or sub-species, and some as distinct yet closely
 allied species representing each other on the several ranges.
   </p><p>In the foregoing illustration I have assumed that at the
 commencement of our imaginary Glacial period, the arctic productions
 were as uniform round the polar regions as they are at the present
 day. But it is also necessary to assume that many sub-arctic and
 some few temperate forms were the same round the world, for some of
 the species which now exist on the lower mountain-slopes and on the
 plains of North America and Europe are the same; and it may be asked
 how I account for this degree of uniformity in the sub-arctic and
 temperate forms round the world, at the commencement of the real
 Glacial period. At the present day, the sub-arctic and northern
 temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds are separated from
 each other by the whole Atlantic Ocean and by the northern part of the
 Pacific. During the Glacial period, when the inhabitants of the Old
 and New Worlds lived farther southward than they do at present, they
 must have been still more completely separated from each other by
 wider spaces of ocean; so that it may well be asked how the same
 species could then or previously have entered the two continents.
 The explanation, I believe, lies in the nature of the climate before
 the commencement of the Glacial period. At this, the newer Pliocene
 period, the majority of the inhabitants of the world were specifically
 the same as now, and we have good reason to believe that the climate
 was warmer than at the present day. Hence we may suppose that the
 organisms which now live under latitude 60, lived during the
 Pliocene period farther north under the Polar Circle, in latitude
 66-67; and that the present arctic productions then lived on the
 broken land still nearer to the pole. Now, if we looked at a
 terrestrial globe, we see under the Polar Circle that there is
 almost continuous land from western Europe, through Siberia, to
 eastern America. And this continuity of the circumpolar land, with the
 consequent freedom under a more favourable climate for intermigration,
 will account for the supposed uniformity of the sub-arctic and
 temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds, at a period
 anterior to the Glacial epoch.
   </p><p>Believing, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents
 have long remained in nearly the same relative position, though
 subjected to great oscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to
 extend the above view, and to infer that during some still earlier and
 still warmer period, such as the older Pliocene period, a large number
 of the same plants and animals inhabited the almost continuous
 circumpolar land; and that these plants and animals, both in the Old
 and New Worlds, began slowly to migrate southwards as the climate
 became less warm, long before the commencement of the Glacial
 period. We now see, as I believe, their descendants, mostly in a
 modified condition, in the central parts of Europe and the United
 States. On this view we can understand the relationship with very
 little identity, between the productions of North America and Europe,-
 a relationship which is highly remarkable, considering the distance of
 the two areas, and their separation by the whole Atlantic Ocean. We
 can further understand the singular fact remarked on by several
 observers that the productions of Europe and America during the
 later tertiary stages were more closely related to each other than
 they are at the present time; for during these warmer periods the
 northern parts of the Old and New Worlds will have been almost
 continuously united by land, serving as a bridge, since rendered
 impassable by cold, for the intermigration of their inhabitants.
   </p><p>During the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as
 soon as the species in common, which inhabited the New and Old Worlds,
 migrated south of the Polar Circle, they will have been completely cut
 off from each other. This separation, as far as the more temperate
 productions are concerned, must have taken place long ages ago. As the
 plants and animals migrated southwards, they will have become
 mingled in the one great region with the native American
 productions, and would have had to compete with them; and in the
 other great region, with those of the Old World. Consequently we
 have here everything favourable for much modification,- for far more
 modification than with the Alpine productions, left isolated, within a
 much more recent period, on the several mountain-ranges and on the
 arctic lands of Europe and N. America. Hence it has come, that when we
 compare the now living productions of the temperate regions of the New
 and Old Worlds, we find very few identical species (though Asa Gray
 has lately shown that more plants are identical than was formerly
 supposed), but we find in every great class many forms, which some
 naturalists rank as geographical races, and others as distinct
 species; and a host of closely allied or representative forms which
 are ranked by all naturalists as specifically distinct.
   </p><p>As on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern
 migration of a marine fauna, which, during the Pliocene or even a
 somewhat earlier period, was nearly uniform along the continuous
 shores of the Polar Circle, will account, on the theory of
 modification, for many closely allied forms now living in marine areas
 completely sundered. Thus, I think, we can understand the presence
 of some closely allied, still existing and extinct tertiary forms,
 on the eastern and western shores of temperate North America; and
 the still more striking fact of many closely allied crustaceans (as
 described in Dana's admirable work), some fish and other marine
 animals, inhabiting the Mediterranean and the seas of Japan,- these
 two areas being now completely separated by the breadth of a whole
 continent and by wide spaces of ocean.
   </p><p>These cases of close relationship in species either now or
 formerly inhabiting the seas on the eastern and western shores of
 North America, the Mediterranean and Japan, and the temperate lands of
 North America and Europe, are inexplicable on the theory of
 creation. We cannot maintain that such species have been created
 alike, in correspondence with the nearly similar physical conditions
 of the areas; for if we compare, for instance, certain parts of
 South America with parts of South Africa or Australia, we see
 countries closely similar in all their physical conditions, with their
 inhabitants utterly dissimilar.
 
 </p><h4>Alternate Glacial Periods in the North and South</h4>
 
   <p>But we must return to our more immediate subject. I am convinced
 that Forbes's view may be largely extended. In Europe we meet with the
 plainest evidence of the Glacial period, from the western shores of
 Britain to the Oural range, and southward to the Pyrenees. We may
 infer from the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation,
 that Siberia was similarly affected. In the Lebanon, according to
 Dr. Hooker, perpetual snow formerly covered the central axis, and
 fed glaciers which rolled 400 feet down the valleys. The same observer
 has recently found great moraines at a low level on the Atlas range in
 N. Africa. Along the Himalaya, at points 900 miles apart, glaciers
 have left the marks of their former low descent; and in Sikkim, Dr.
 Hooker saw maize growing on ancient and gigantic moraines. Southward
 of the Asiatic continent, on the opposite side of the equator, we
 know, from the excellent researches of Dr. J. Haast and Dr. Hector,
 that in New Zealand immense glaciers formerly descended to a low
 level; and the same plants found by Dr. Hooker on widely separated
 mountains in this island tell the same story of a former cold
 period. From facts communicated to me by the Rev. W. B. Clarke, it
 appears also that there are traces of former glacial action on the
 mountains of the south-eastern corner of Australia.
   </p><p>Looking to America; in the northern half, ice-borne fragments of
 rock have been observed on the eastern side of the continent, as far
 south as lat. 36-37, and on the shores of the Pacific, where the
 climate is now so different, as far south as lat. 46. Erratic boulders
 have, also, been noticed on the Rocky Mountains. In the Cordillera
 of South America, nearly under the equator, glaciers once extended far
 below their present level. In Central Chile I examined a vast mound of
 detritus with great boulders, crossing the Portillo valley, which
 there can hardly be a doubt once formed a huge moraine; and Mr. D.
 Forbes informs me that he found in various parts of the Cordillera,
 from lat. 13 deg. to 30 deg. S., at about the height of 19,000 feet,
 deeply furrowed rocks, resembling those with which he was familiar
 in Norway, and likewise great masses of detritus, including grooved
 pebbles. Along this whole space of the Cordillera true glaciers do not
 exist even at much more considerable heights. Farther south on both
 sides of the continent, from lat. 41 deg. to the southernmost
 extremity, we have the clearest evidence of former glacial action,
 in numerous immense boulders transported far from their parent source.
   </p><p>From these several facts, namely from the glacial action having
 extended all round the northern and southern hemispheres- from the
 period having been in a geological sense recent in both hemispheres-
 from its having lasted in both during a great length of time, as may
 be inferred from the amount of work affected- and lastly from glaciers
 having recently descended to a low level along the whole line of the
 Cordillera, it at one time appeared to me that we could not avoid
 the conclusion that the temperature of the whole world had been
 simultaneously lowered during the Glacial period. But now Mr. Croll,
 in a series of admirable memoirs, has attempted to show that a glacial
 condition of climate is the result of various physical causes, brought
 into operation by an increase in the eccentricity of the earth's
 orbit. All these causes tend towards the same end; but the most
 powerful appears to be the indirect influence of the eccentricity of
 the orbit upon oceanic currents. According to Mr. Croll, cold
 periods regularly occur every ten or fifteen thousand years; and these
 at long intervals are extremely severe, owing to certain
 contingencies, of which the most important, as Sir C. Lyell has shown,
 is the relative position of the land and water. Mr. Croll believes
 that the last great Glacial period occurred about 240,000 years ago,
 and endured with slight alterations of climate for about 160,000
 years. With respect to more ancient Glacial periods, several
 geologists are convinced from direct evidence that such occurred
 during the Miocene and Eocene formations, not to mention still more
 ancient formations. But the most important result for us, arrived at
 by Mr. Croll, is that whenever the northern hemisphere passes
 through a cold period the temperature of the southern hemisphere is
 actually raised, with the winters rendered much milder, chiefly
 through changes in the direction of the ocean currents. So
 conversely it will be with the northern hemisphere, whilst the
 southern passes through a Glacial period. This conclusion throws so
 much light on geographical distribution that I am strongly inclined to
 trust in it; but I will first give the facts, which demand an
 explanation.
   </p><p>In South America, Dr. Hooker has shown that besides many closely
 allied species, between forty and fifty of the flowering plants of
 Tierra del Fuego, forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty
 flora, are common to North America and Europe, enormously remote as
 these areas in opposite hemispheres are from each other. On the
 lofty mountains of equatorial America a host of peculiar species
 belonging to European genera occur. On the Organ mountains of
 Brazil, some few temperate European, some Antarctic, and some Andean
 genera were found by Gardner, which do not exist in the low
 intervening hot countries. On the Silla of Caraccas, the illustrious
 Humboldt long ago found species belonging to genera characteristic
 of the Cordillera.
   </p><p>In Africa, several forms characteristic of Europe and some few
 representatives of the flora of the Cape of Good Hope occur in the
 mountains of Abyssinia. At the Cape of Good Hope a very few European
 species, believed not to have been introduced by man, and on the
 mountains several representative European forms are found, which
 have not been discovered in the intertropical parts of Africa. Dr.
 Hooker has also lately shown that several of the plants living on
 the upper parts of the lofty island of Fernando Po and on the
 neighbouring Cameroon mountains, in the Gulf of Guinea, are closely
 related to those on the mountains of Abyssinia, and likewise to
 those of temperate Europe. It now also appears, as I hear from Dr.
 Hooker, that some of these same temperate plants have been
 discovered by the Rev. R. T. Lowe on the mountains of the Cape Verde
 Islands. This extension of the same temperate forms, almost under
 the equator, across the whole continent of Africa and to the mountains
 of the Cape Verde Archipelago, is one of the most astonishing facts
 ever recorded in the distribution of plants.
   </p><p>On the Himalaya, and on the isolated mountain-ranges of the
 peninsula of India, on the heights of Ceylon, and on the volcanic
 cones of Java, many plants occur, either identically the same or
 representing each other, and at the same time representing plants of
 Europe, not found in the intervening hot lowlands. A list of the
 genera of plants collected on the loftier peaks of Java, raises a
 picture of a collection made on a hillock in Europe! Still more
 striking is the fact that peculiar Australian forms are represented by
 certain plants growing on the summits of the mountains of Borneo. Some
 of these Australian forms, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, extend along the
 heights of the peninsula of Malacca, and are thinly scattered on the
 one hand over India, and on the other hand as far north as Japan.
   </p><p>On the southern mountains of Australia, Dr. F. Muller has discovered
 several European species; other species, not introduced by man,
 occur on the lowlands; and a long list can be given, as I am
 informed by Dr. Hooker, of European genera, found in Australia, but
 not in the intermediate torrid regions. In the admirable
 Introduction to the Flora of New Zealand, by Dr. Hooker, analogous and
 striking facts are given in regard to the plants of that large island.
 Hence we see that certain plants growing on the more lofty mountains
 of the tropics in all parts of the world, and on the temperate
 plains of the north and south, are either the same species or
 varieties of the same species. It should, however, be observed that
 these plants are not strictly arctic forms; for, as Mr. H. C. Watson
 has remarked, "in receding from polar towards equatorial latitudes,
 the Alpine or mountain floras really become less and less Arctic."
 Besides these identical and closely allied forms, many species
 inhabiting the same widely sundered areas, belong to genera not now
 found in the intermediate tropical lowlands.
   </p><p>These brief remarks apply to plants alone; but some few analogous
 facts could be given in regard to terrestrial animals. In marine
 productions, similar cases likewise occur; as an example, I may
 quote a statement by the highest authority, Prof. Dana, that "It is
 certainly a wonderful fact that New Zealand should have a closer
 resemblance in its Crustacea to Great Britain, its antipode, than to
 any other part of the world." Sir J. Richardson, also, speaks of the
 reappearance on the shores of New Zealand, Tasmania, &amp;c., of
 northern forms of fish. Dr. Hooker informs me that twenty-five species
 of Algae are common to New Zealand and to Europe, but have not been
 found in the intermediate tropical seas.
   </p><p>From the foregoing facts, namely, the presence of temperate forms on
 the highlands across the whole of equatorial Africa, and along the
 Peninsula of India, to Ceylon and the Malay Archipelago, and in a less
 well-marked manner across the wide expanse of tropical South
 America, it appears almost certain that at some former period, no
 doubt during the most severe part of a Glacial period, the lowlands of
 these great continents were everywhere tenanted under the equator by
 considerable number of temperate forms. At this period the
 equatorial climate at the level of the sea was probably about the same
 with that now experienced at the height of from five to six thousand
 feet under the same latitude, or perhaps even rather cooler. During
 this, the coldest period, the lowlands under the equator must have
 been clothed with a mingled tropical and temperate vegetation, like
 that described by Hooker as growing luxuriantly at the height of
 from four to five thousand feet on the lower slopes of the Himalaya,
 but with perhaps a still greater preponderance of temperate forms.
 So again in the mountainous island of Fernando Po, in the Gulf of
 Guinea, Mr. Mann found temperate European forms beginning to appear at
 the height of about five thousand feet. On the mountains of Panama, at
 the height of only two thousand feet, Dr. Seemann found the vegetation
 like that of Mexico, "with forms of the torrid zone harmoniously
 blended with those of the temperate."
   </p><p>Now let us see whether Mr. Croll's conclusion that when the northern
 hemisphere suffered from the extreme cold of the great Glacial period,
 the southern hemisphere was actually warmer, throws any clear light on
 the present apparently inexplicable distribution of various
 organisms in the temperate parts of both hemispheres, and on the
 mountains of the tropics. The Glacial period, as measured by years,
 must have been very long; and when we remember over what vast spaces
 some naturalised plants and animals have spread within a few
 centuries, this period will have been ample for any amount of
 migration. As the cold became more and more intense, we know that
 arctic forms invaded the temperate regions; and, from the facts just
 given, there can hardly be a doubt that some of the more vigorous,
 dominant, and widest-spreading temperate forms invaded the
 equatorial lowlands. The inhabitants of these hot lowlands would at
 the same time have migrated to the tropical and subtropical regions of
 the south, for the southern hemisphere was at this period warmer. On
 the decline of the Glacial period, as both hemispheres gradually
 recovered their former temperatures, the northern temperate forms
 living on the lowlands under the equator, would have been driven to
 their former homes or have been destroyed, being replaced by the
 equatorial forms returning from the south. Some, however, of the
 northern temperate forms would almost certainly have ascended any
 adjoining high land, where, if sufficiently lofty, they would have
 long survived like the arctic forms on the mountains of Europe. They
 might have survived, even if the climate was not perfectly fitted
 for them, for the change of temperature must have been very slow,
 and plants undoubtedly possess a certain capacity for acclimatisation,
 as shown by their transmitting to their offspring different
 constitutional powers of resisting heat and cold.
   </p><p>In the regular course of events the southern hemisphere would in
 its turn be subjected to a severe Glacial period, with the northern
 hemisphere rendered warmer; and then the southern temperate forms
 would invade the equatorial lowlands. The northern forms which had
 before been left on the mountains would now descend and mingle with
 the southern forms. These latter, when the warmth returned, would
 return to their former homes, leaving some few species on the
 mountains, and carrying southward with them some of the northern
 temperate forms which had descended from their mountain fastnesses.
 Thus, we should have some few species identically the same in the
 northern and southern temperate zones and on the mountains of the
 intermediate tropical regions. But the species left during a long time
 on these mountains, or in opposite hemispheres, would have to
 compete with many new forms and would be exposed to somewhat different
 physical conditions; hence they would be eminently liable to
 modification, and would generally now exist as varieties or as
 representative species; and this is the case. We must, also, bear in
 mind the occurrence in both hemispheres of former Glacial periods; for
 these will account, in accordance with the same principles, for the
 many quite distinct species inhabiting the same widely separated
 areas,  </p><p>and belonging to genera not now found in the intermediate
 torrid zones.
   </p><p>It is a remarkable fact strongly insisted on by Hooker in regard
 to America, and by Alph. de Candolle in regard to Australia, that many
 more identical or slightly modified species have migrated from the
 north to the south, than in a reversed direction. We see, however, a
 few southern forms on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia. I suspect
 that this preponderant migration from the north to the south is due to
 the greater extent of land in the north, and to the northern forms
 having existed in their own homes in greater numbers, and having
 consequently been advanced through natural selection and competition
 to a higher stage of perfection, or dominating power, than the
 southern forms. And thus, when the two sets became commingled in the
 equatorial regions, during the alternations to the Glacial periods,
 the northern forms were the more powerful and were able to hold
 their places on the mountains, and afterwards to migrate southward
 with the southern forms; but not so the southern in regard to the
 northern forms. In the same manner at the present day, we see that
 very many European productions cover the ground in La Plata, New
 Zealand, and to a lesser degree in Australia, and have beaten the
 natives; whereas extremely few southern forms have become
 naturalised in any part of the northern hemisphere, though hides,
 wool, and other objects likely to carry seeds have been largely
 imported into Europe during the last two or three centuries from La
 Plata and during the last forty or fifty years from Australia. The
 Neilgherrie mountains in India, however, offer a partial exception;
 for here, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, Australian forms are rapidly
 sowing themselves and becoming naturalised. Before the last great
 Glacial period, no doubt the intertropical mountains were stocked with
 endemic Alpine forms; but these have almost everywhere yielded to
 the more dominant forms generated in the larger areas and more
 efficient workshops of the north. In many islands the native
 productions are nearly equalled, or even outnumbered, by those which
 have become naturalised; and this is the first stage towards their
 extinction. Mountains are islands on the land, and their inhabitants
 have yielded to those produced within the larger areas of the north,
 just in the same way as the inhabitants of real islands have
 everywhere yielded and are still yielding to continental forms
 naturalised through man's agency.
   </p><p>The same principles apply to the distribution of terrestrial animals
 and of marine productions, in the northern and southern temperate
 zones, and on the intertropical mountains. When, during the height
 of the Glacial period, the ocean-currents were widely different to
 what they now are, some of the inhabitants of the temperate seas might
 have reached the equator; of these a few would perhaps at once be able
 to migrate southward, by keeping to the cooler currents, whilst
 others might remain and survive in the colder depths until the
 southern hemisphere was in its turn subjected to a glacial climate and
 permitted their further progress; in nearly the same manner as,
 according to Forbes, isolated spaces inhabited by arctic productions
 exist to the present day in the deeper parts of the northern temperate
 seas.
   </p><p>I am far from supposing that all the difficulties in regard to the
 distribution and affinities of the identical and allied species, which
 now live so widely separated in the north and south, and sometimes
 on the intermediate mountain-ranges, are removed on the views above
 given. The exact lines of migration cannot be indicated. We cannot say
 why certain species and not others have migrated; why certain
 species have been modified and have given rise to new forms, whilst
 others have remained unaltered. We cannot hope to explain such
 facts, until we can say why one species and not another becomes
 naturalised by man's agency in a foreign land; why one species
 ranges twice or thrice as far, and is twice or thrice as common, as
 another species within their own homes.
   </p><p>Various special difficulties also remain to be solved; for instance,
 the occurrence, as shown by Dr. Hooker, of the same plants at points
 so enormously remote as Kerguelen Land, New Zealand, and Fuegia; but
 icebergs, as suggested by Lyell, may have been concerned in their
 dispersal. The existence at these and other distant points of the
 southern hemisphere, of species, which, though distinct, belong to
 genera exclusively confined to the south, is a more remarkable case.
 Some of these species are so distinct, that we cannot suppose that
 there has been time since the commencement of the last Glacial
 period for their migration and subsequent modification to the
 necessary degree. The facts seem to indicate that distinct species
 belonging to the same genera have migrated in radiating lines from a
 common centre; and I am inclined to look in the southern, as in the
 northern hemisphere, to a former and warmer period, before the
 commencement of the last Glacial period, when the Antarctic lands, now
 covered with ice, supported a highly peculiar and isolated flora. It
 may be suspected that before this flora was exterminated during the
 last Glacial epoch, a few forms had been already widely dispersed to
 various points of the southern hemisphere by occasional means of
 transport, and by the aid as halting-places, of now sunken islands.
 Thus the southern shores of America, Australia, and New Zealand may
 have become slightly tinted by the same peculiar forms of life.
   </p><p>Sir C. Lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language
 almost identical with mine, on the effects of great alterations of
 climate throughout the world on geographical distribution. And we have
 now seen that Mr. Croll's conclusion that successive Glacial periods
 in the one hemisphere coincide with warmer periods in the opposite
 hemisphere, together with the admission of the slow modification of
 species, explains a multitude of facts in the distribution of the same
 and of the allied forms of life in all parts of the globe. The
 living waters have flowed during one period from the north and
 during another from the south, and in both cases have reached the
 equator; but the stream of life has flowed with greater force from the
 north than in the opposite direction, and has consequently more freely
 inundated the south. As the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines,
 rising higher on the shores where the tide rises highest, so have
 the living waters left their living drift on our mountain summits,
 in a line gently rising from the arctic lowlands to a great altitude
 under the equator. The various beings thus left stranded may be
 compared with savage races of man, driven up and surviving in the
 mountain fastnesses of almost every land, which serves as a record,
 full of interest to us, of the former inhabitants of the surrounding
 lowlands.
