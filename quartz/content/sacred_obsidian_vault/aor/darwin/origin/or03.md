 <h3>Chapter III: Struggle For Existence</h3>
 
   <p>BEFORE entering on the subject of this chapter, I must make a few
 preliminary remarks, to show how the struggle for existence bears on
 Natural Selection. It has been seen in the last chapter that amongst
 organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual
 variability: indeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed.
 It is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be
 called species or sub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance,
 the two or three hundred doubtful forms of British plants are entitled
 to hold, if the existence of any well-marked varieties be admitted.
 But the mere existence of individual variability and of some few
 well-marked varieties, though necessary as the foundation for the
 work, helps us but little in understanding how species arise in
 nature. How have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of the
 organisation to another part, and to the conditions of life, and of
 one organic being to another being, been perfected? We see these
 beautiful co-adaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and the
 mistletoe; and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite
 which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird; in the
 structure of the beetle which dives through the water; in the plumed
 seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we see
 beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic
 world.
   </p><p>Again, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have
 called incipient species, become ultimately converted into good and
 distinct species which in most cases obviously differ from each
 other far more than do the varieties of the same species? How do those
 groups of species, which constitute what are called distinct genera,
 and which differ from each other more than do the species of the
 same genus, arise? All these results, as we shall more fully see in
 the next chapter, follow from the struggle for life. Owing to this
 struggle, variations, however slight and from whatever cause
 proceeding, if they be in any degree profitable to the individuals
 of a species, in their infinitely complex relations to other organic
 beings and to their physical conditions of life, will tend to the
 preservation of such individuals, and will generally be inherited by
 the offspring. The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance
 of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are
 periodically born, but a small number can survive. I have called
 this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is
 preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its
 relation to man's power of selection. But the expression often used by
 Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate,
 and is sometimes equally convenient. We have seen that man by
 selection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt organic
 beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of slight but
 useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature. But Natural
 Selection, as we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for
 action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as
 the works of Nature are to those of Art.
   </p><p>We will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for
 existence. In my future work this subject will be treated, as it
 well deserves, at greater length. The elder De Candolle and Lyell have
 largely and philosophically shown that all organic beings are
 exposed to severe competition. In regard to plants, no one has treated
 this subject with more spirit and ability than W. Herbert, Dean of
 Manchester, evidently the result of his great horticultural knowledge.
 Nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal
 struggle for life, or more difficult- at least I have found it so-
 than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind. Yet unless it be
 thoroughly engrained in the mind, the whole economy of nature, with
 every fact on distribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and
 variation, will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood. We behold the
 face of nature bright with gladness, we often see superabundance of
 food; we do not see or we forget, that the birds which are idly
 singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus
 constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these
 songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds
 and beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that, though food
 may be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each
 recurring year.
 
 </p><h4>The Term, Struggle for Existence, used in a large sense</h4>
 
   <p>I should premise that I use this term in a large and metaphorical
 sense including dependence of one being on another, and including
 (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but
 success in leaving progeny. Two canine animals, in a time of dearth
 may be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and
 live. But a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life
 against the drought, though more properly it should be said to be
 dependent on the moisture. A plant which annually produces a
 thousand seeds, of which only one of an average comes to maturity, may
 be more truly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other
 kinds which already clothe the ground. The mistletoe is dependent on
 the apple and a few other trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense
 be said to struggle with these trees, for, if too many of these
 parasites grow on the same tree, it languishes and dies. But several
 seedling mistletoes, growing close together on the same branch, may
 more truly be said to struggle with each other. As the mistletoe is
 disseminated by birds, its existence depends on them; and it may
 methodically be said to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in
 tempting the birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds. In
 these several senses, which pass into each other, I use for
 convenience' sake the general term of Struggle for Existence.
 
 </p><h4>Geometrical Ratio of Increase</h4>
 
   <p>A struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at
 which all organic beings tend to increase. Every being, which during
 its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer
 destruction during some period of its life, and during some season
 or occasional year, otherwise, on the principle of geometrical
 increase, its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great
 that no country could support the product. Hence, as more
 individuals are produced than can possibly survive, there must in
 every case be a struggle for existence, either one individual with
 another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct
 species, or with the physical conditions of life. It is the doctrine
 of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and
 vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial
 increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage.
 Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly,
 in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them.
   </p><p>There is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally
 increases at so high a rate, that, if not destroyed, the earth would
 soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow-breeding
 man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in less than a
 thousand years, there would literally not be standing-room for his
 progeny. Linnaeus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only
 two seeds- and there is no plant so unproductive as this- and their
 seedlings next year produced two, and so on, then in twenty years
 there should be a million plants. The elephant is reckoned the slowest
 breeder of all known animals, and I have taken some pains to
 estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase; it will be
 safest to assume that it begins breeding when thirty years old, and
 goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing forth six young in
 the interval, and surviving till one hundred years old; if this be so,
 after a period of from 740 to 750 years there would be nearly nineteen
 million elephants alive, descended from the first pair.
   </p><p>But we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical
 calculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly
 rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when
 circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three
 following seasons. Still more striking is the evidence from our
 domestic animals of many kinds which have run wild in several parts of
 the world; if the statements of the rate of increase of
 slow-breeding cattle and horses in South America, and latterly in
 Australia, had not been well authenticated, they would have been
 incredible. So it is with plants; cases could be given of introduced
 plants which have become common throughout whole islands in a period
 of less than ten years. Several of the plants, such as the cardoon and
 a tall thistle, which are now the commonest over the whole plains of
 La Plata, clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion
 of every other plant, have been introduced from Europe; and there
 are plants which now range in India, as I hear from Dr. Falconer, from
 Cape Comorin to the Himalaya, which have been imported from America
 since its discovery. In such cases, and endless others could be given,
 no one supposes that the fertility of the animals or plants has been
 suddenly and temporarily increased in any sensible degree. The obvious
 explanation is that the conditions of life have been highly
 favourable, and that there has consequently been less destruction of
 the old and young, and that nearly all the young have been enabled
 to breed. Their geometrical ratio of increase, the result of which
 never fails to be surprising, simply explains their extraordinarily
 rapid increase and wide diffusion in their new homes.
   </p><p>In a state of nature almost every full-grown plant annually produces
 seed, and amongst animals there are very few which do not annually
 pair. Hence we may confidently assert, that all plants and animals are
 tending to increase at a geometrical ratio,- that all would rapidly
 stock every station in which they could anyhow exist,- and that this
 geometrical tendency to increase must. be checked by destruction at
 some period of life. Our familiarity with the larger domestic
 animals tends, I think, to mislead us: we see no great destruction
 falling on them, but we do not keep in mind that thousands are
 annually slaughtered for food, and that in a state of nature an
 equal number would have somehow to be disposed of.
   </p><p>The only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs or
 seeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely few, is, that
 the slow-breeders would require a few more years to people, under
 favourable conditions, a whole district, let it be ever so large.
 The condor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score, and yet in
 the same country the condor may be the more numerous of the two; the
 Fulmar petrel lays but one egg, yet it is believed to be the most
 numerous bird in the world. One fly deposits hundreds of eggs, and
 another, like the hippobosca, a single one; but this difference does
 not determine how many individuals of the two species can be supported
 in a district. A large number of eggs is of some importance to those
 species which depend on a fluctuating amount of food, for it allows
 them rapidly to increase in number. But the real importance of a large
 number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much destruction at some
 period of life; and this period in the great majority of cases is an
 early one. If an animal can in any way protect its own eggs or
 young, a small number may be produced, and yet the average stock be
 fully kept up; but if many eggs or young are destroyed, many must be
 produced, or the species will become extinct. It would suffice to keep
 up the full number of a tree, which lived on an average for a thousand
 years, if a single seed were produced once in a thousand years,
 supposing that this seed were never destroyed, and could be ensured to
 germinate in a fitting place. So that, in all cases, the average
 number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on the number of
 its eggs or seeds.
   </p><p>In looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing
 considerations always in mind- never to forget that every single
 organic being may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase
 in numbers; that each lives by a struggle at some period of its
 life; that heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or
 old, during each generation or at recurrent intervals. Lighten any
 cheek, mitigate the destruction ever so little, and the number of
 the species will almost instantaneously increase to any amount.
 
 </p><h4>Nature of the Checks to Increase</h4>
 
   <p>The causes which cheek the natural tendency of each species to
 increase are most obscure. Look at the most vigorous species; by as
 much as it swarms in numbers, by so much will it tend to increase
 still further. We know not exactly what the checks are even in a
 single instance. Nor will this surprise any one who reflects how
 ignorant we are on this head, even in regard to mankind, although so
 incomparably better known than any other animal. This subject of the
 checks to increase has been ably treated by several authors, and I
 hope in a future work to discuss it at considerable length, more
 especially in regard to the feral animals of South America. Here I
 will make only a few remarks, just to recall to the reader's mind some
 of the chief points. Eggs or very young animals seem generally to
 suffer most, but this is not invariably the case. With plants there is
 a vast destruction of seeds, but, from some observations which I
 have made, it appears that the seedlings suffer most from
 germinating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants.
 Seedlings, also, are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies; for
 instance, on a piece of ground three feet long and two wide, dug and
 cleared, and where there could be no choking from other plants, I
 marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up, and
 out of 357 no less than 295 were destroyed, chiefly by slugs and
 insects. If turf which has long been mown, and the case would be the
 same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds, be let to grow, the more
 vigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous, though fully grown
 plants; thus out of twenty species growing on a little plot of mown
 turf (three feet by four) nine species perished, from the other
 species being allowed to grow up freely.
   </p><p>The amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme
 limit to which each can increase; but very frequently it is not the
 obtaining food, but the serving as prey to other animals, which
 determines the average numbers of a species. Thus, there seems to be
 little doubt that the stock of partridges, grouse, and hares on any
 large estate depends chiefly on the destruction of vermin. If not
 one head of game were shot during the next twenty years in England,
 and, at the same time, if no vermin were destroyed, there would, in
 all probability, be less game than at present, although hundreds of
 thousands of game animals are now annually shot. On the other hand, in
 some cases, as with the elephant, none are destroyed by beasts of
 prey; for even the tiger in India most rarely dares to attack a
 young elephant protected by its dam.
   </p><p>Climate plays an important part in determining the average number of
 a species, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought seem to
 be the most effective of all checks. I estimated (chiefly from the
 greatly reduced numbers of nests in the spring) that the winter of
 1854-5 destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and
 this is a tremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent
 is an extraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man. The
 action of climate seems at first sight to be quite independent of
 the struggle for existence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in
 reducing food, it brings on the most severe struggle between the
 individuals, whether of the same or of distinct species, which subsist
 on the same kind of food. Even when climate, for instance, extreme
 cold, acts directly, it will be the least vigorous individuals, or
 those which have got least food through the advancing winter, which
 will suffer most. When we travel from south to north, or from a damp
 region to a dry, we invariably see some species gradually getting
 rarer and rarer, and finally disappearing; and the change of climate
 being conspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its
 direct action. But this is a false view; we forget that each
 species, even where it most abounds, is constantly suffering
 enormous destruction at some period of its life, from enemies or
 from competitors for the same place and food; and if these enemies
 or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of
 climate, they will increase in numbers; and as each area is already
 fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species must decrease.
 When we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers, we
 may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being
 favoured, as in this one being hurt. So it is when we travel
 northward, but in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of
 species of all kinds, and therefore of competitors, decreases
 northwards; hence in going northwards, or in ascending a mountain,
 we far oftener meet with stunted forms, due to the directly
 injurious action of climate, than we do in proceeding southwards or in
 descending a mountain. When we reach the arctic regions, or snowcapped
 summits, or absolute deserts, the struggle for life is almost
 exclusively with the elements.
   </p><p>That climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other
 species, we clearly see in the prodigious number of plants which in
 our gardens can perfectly well endure our climate, but which never
 become naturalised, for they cannot compete with our native plants nor
 resist destruction by our native animals.
   </p><p>When a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances,
 increases inordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics- at
 least, this seems generally to occur with our game animals- often
 ensue; and here we have a limiting check independent of the struggle
 for life. But even some of these so-called epidemics appear to be
 due to parasitic worms, which have from some cause, possibly in part
 through facility of diffusion amongst the crowded animals, been
 disproportionally favoured: and here comes in a sort of struggle
 between the parasite and its prey.
   </p><p>On the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of
 the same species, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is
 absolutely necessary for its preservation. Thus we can easily raise
 plenty of corn and rape-seed, &amp;c., in our fields, because the seeds
 are in great excess compared with the number of birds which feed on
 them; nor can the birds, though having a super-abundance of food at
 this one season, increase in number proportionally to the supply of
 seed, as their numbers are checked during the winter; but any one
 who has tried, knows how troublesome it is to get seed from a few
 wheat or other such plants in a garden: I have in this case lost every
 single seed. This view of the necessity of a large stock of the same
 species for its preservation, explains, I believe, some singular facts
 in nature, such as that of very rare plants being sometimes
 extremely abundant, in the few spots where they do exist; and that
 of some social plants being social, that is abounding in
 individuals, even on the extreme verge of their range. For in such
 cases, we may believe, that a plant could exist only where the
 conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist
 together, and thus save the species from utter destruction. I should
 add that the good effects of intercrossing, and the ill effects of
 close interbreeding, no doubt come into play in many of these cases;
 but I will not here enlarge on this subject.
 
 </p><h4>Complex Relations of all Animals and Plants to each other in the
 Struggle for Existence</h4>
 
   <p>Many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are
 the checks and relations between organic beings, which have to
 struggle together in the same country. I will give only a single
 instance, which, though a simple one, interested me. In Staffordshire,
 on the estate of a relation, where I had ample means of investigation,
 there was a large and extremely barren heath, which had never been
 touched by the hand of man; but several hundred acres of exactly the
 same nature had been enclosed twenty-five years previously and planted
 with Scotch fir. The change in the native vegetation of the planted
 part of the heath was most remarkable, more than is generally seen
 in passing from one quite different soil to another: not only the
 proportional numbers of the heath-plants were wholly changed, but
 twelve species of plants (not counting grasses and carices) flourished
 in the plantations, which could not be found on the heath. The
 effect on the insects must have been still greater, for six
 insectivorous birds were very common in the plantations, which were
 not to be seen on the heath; and the heath was frequented by two or
 three distinct insectivorous birds. Here we see how potent has been
 the effect of the introduction of a single tree, nothing whatever else
 having been done, with the exception of the land having been enclosed,
 so that cattle could not enter. But how important an element enclosure
 is, I plainly saw near Farnham, in Surrey. Here there are extensive
 heaths, with a few clumps of old Scotch firs on the distant
 hilltops: within the last ten years large spaces have been enclosed,
 and self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so close
 together that all cannot live. When I ascertained that these young
 trees had not been sown or planted, I was so much surprised at their
 numbers that I went to several points of view, whence I could
 examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and literally I
 could not see a single Scotch fir, except the old planted clumps.
 But on looking closely between the stems of the heath, I found a
 multitude of seedlings and little trees which had been perpetually
 browsed down by the cattle. In one square yard, at a point some
 hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps, I counted thirty-two
 little trees; and one of them, with twenty-six rings of growth, had,
 during many years, tried to raise its head above the stems of the
 heath, and had failed. No wonder that, as soon as the land was
 enclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young
 firs. Yet the heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no
 one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely and
 effectually searched it for food.
   </p><p>Here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the
 Scotch fir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the
 existence of cattle. Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance
 of this; for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run
 wild, though they swarm southward and northward in a feral state;
 and Azara and Rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater
 number in Paraguay of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels
 of these animals when first born. The increase of these flies,
 numerous as they are, must be habitually checked by some means,
 probably by other parasitic insects. Hence, if certain insectivorous
 birds were to decrease in Paraguay, the parasitic insects would
 probably increase; and this would lessen the number of the
 navel-frequenting flies- then cattle and horses would become feral,
 and this would certainly greatly alter (as indeed I have observed in
 parts of South America) the vegetation: this again would largely
 affect the insects; and this, as we have just seen in Staffordshire,
 the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in ever-increasing circles
 of complexity. Not that under nature the relations will ever be as
 simple as this. Battle within battle must be continually recurring
 with varying success; and yet in the long run the forces are so nicely
 balanced, that the face of nature remains for long periods of time
 uniform, though assuredly the merest trifle would give the victory
 to one organic being over another. Nevertheless, so profound is our
 ignorance, and so high our presumption, that we marvel when we hear of
 the extinction of an organic being; and as we do not see the cause, we
 invoke cataclysms to desolate the world, or invent laws on the
 duration of the forms of life!
   </p><p>I am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and
 animals remote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web
 of complex relations. I shall hereafter have occasion to show that the
 exotic Lobelia fulgens is never visited in my garden by insects, and
 consequently, from its peculiar structure, never sets a seed. Nearly
 all our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of insects
 to remove their pollen-masses and thus to fertilise them. I find
 from experiments that humble-bees are almost indispensable to the
 fertilisation of the heartsease (Viola tricolor), for other bees do
 not visit this flower. I have also found that the visits of bees are
 necessary for the fertilisation of some kinds of clover; for instance,
 90 heads of Dutch clover (Trifolium repens) yielded 2,290 seeds, but
 20 other heads protected from bees produced not one. Again, 100
 heads of red clover (T. pratense) produced 2,700 seeds, but the same
 number of protected heads produced not a single seed. Humble-bees
 alone visit red clover, as other bees cannot reach the nectar. It
 has been suggested that moths may fertilise the clovers; but I doubt
 whether they could do so in the case of the red clover, from their
 weight not being sufficient to depress the wing petals. Hence we may
 infer as highly probable that, if the whole genus of humble-bees
 became extinct or very rare in England, the heartsease and red
 clover would become very rare, or wholly disappear. The number of
 humble-bees in any district depends in a great measure upon the number
 of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and Col. Newman,
 who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes that
 "more than two-thirds of them are thus destroyed all over England."
 Now the number of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on
 the number of cats; and Col. Newman says, "Near villages and small
 towns I have found the nests of humble-bees more numerous than
 elsewhere, which I attribute to the number of cats that destroy the
 mice." Hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal
 in large numbers in a district might determine, through the
 intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of
 certain flowers in that district!
   </p><p>In the case of every species, many different checks, acting at
 different periods of life, and during different seasons or years,
 probably come into play; some one check or some few being generally
 the most potent; but all will concur in determining the average number
 or even the existence of the species. In some cases it can be shown
 that widely-different checks act on the same species in different
 districts. When we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled
 bank, we are tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds
 to what we call chance. But how false a view is this! Every one has
 heard that when an American forest is cut down a very different
 vegetation springs up; but it has been observed that ancient Indian
 ruins in the southern United States, which must formerly have been
 cleared of trees, now display the same beautiful diversity and
 proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forest. What a
 struggle must have gone on during long centuries between the several
 kinds of trees each annually scattering its seeds by the thousand;
 what war between insect and insect- between insects, snails, and other
 animals with birds and beasts of prey- all striving to increase, all
 feeding on each other, or on the trees, their seeds and seedlings,
 or on the other plants which first clothed the ground and thus checked
 the growth of the trees! Throw up a handful of feathers, and all
 fall to the ground according to definite laws; but how simple is the
 problem where each shall fall compared to that of the action and
 reaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have
 determined, in the course of centuries, the proportional numbers and
 kinds of trees now growing on the old Indian ruins!
   </p><p>The dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite
 on its prey, lies generally between beings remote in the scale of
 nature. This is likewise sometimes the case with those which may be
 strictly said to struggle with each other for existence, as in the
 case of locusts and grass-feeding quadrupeds. But the struggle will
 almost invariably be most severe between the individuals of the same
 species, for they frequent the same districts, require the same
 food, and are exposed to the same dangers. In the case of varieties of
 the same species, the struggle will generally be almost equally
 severe, and we sometimes see the contest soon decided: for instance,
 if several varieties of wheat be sown together, and the mixed seed
 be resown, some of the varieties which best suit the soil or
 climate, or are naturally the most fertile, will beat the others and
 so yield more seed, and will consequently in a few years supplant
 the other varieties. To keep up a mixed stock of even such extremely
 close varieties as the variously-coloured sweet peas, they must be
 each year harvested separately, and the seed then mixed in due
 proportion, otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease in
 number and disappear. So again with the varieties of sheep; it has
 been asserted that certain mountain-varieties will starve out other
 mountain-varieties, so that they cannot be kept together. The same
 result has followed from keeping together different varieties of the
 medicinal leech. It may even be doubted whether the varieties of any
 of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength,
 habits, and constitution, that the original proportions of a mixed
 stock (crossing being prevented) could be kept up for half-a-dozen
 generations, if they were allowed to struggle together, in the same
 manner as beings in a state of nature, and if the seed or young were
 not annually preserved in due proportion.
 
 </p><h4>Struggle for Life most severe between Individuals and Varieties of
 the same Species</h4>
 
   <p>As the species of the same genus usually have, though by no means
 invariably, much similarity in habits and constitution, and always
 in structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between them,
 if they come into competition with each other, than between the
 species of distinct genera. We see this in the recent extension over
 parts of the United States of one species of swallow having caused the
 decrease of another species. The recent increase of the
 missel-thrush in parts of Scotland has caused the decrease of the
 song-thrush. How frequently we hear of one species of rat taking the
 place of another species under the most different climates! In
 Russia the small Asiatic cockroach has everywhere driven before it its
 great congener. In Australia the imported hive-bee is rapidly
 exterminating the small, stingless native bee. One species of charlock
 has been known to supplant another species; and so in other cases.
 We can dimly see why the competition should be most severe between
 allied forms, which fill nearly the same place in the economy of
 nature; but probably in no one case could we precisely say why one
 species has been victorious over another in the great battle of life.
   </p><p>A corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the
 foregoing remarks, namely, that the structure of every organic being
 is related, in the most essential yet often hidden manner, to that
 of all the other organic beings, with which it comes into
 competition for food or residence, or from which it has to escape,
 or on which it preys. This is obvious in the structure of the teeth
 and talons of the tiger; and in that of the legs and claws of the
 parasite which clings to the hair on the tiger's body. But in the
 beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion, and in the flattened and
 fringed legs of the water-beetle, the relation seems at first confined
 to the elements of air and water. Yet the advantage of plumed seeds no
 doubt stands in the closest relation to the land being already thickly
 clothed with other plants; so that the seeds may be widely distributed
 and fall on unoccupied ground. In the water-beetle, the structure of
 its legs, so well adapted for diving, allows it to compete with
 other aquatic insects, to hunt for its own prey, and to escape serving
 as prey to other animals.
   </p><p>The store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems
 at first to have no sort of relation to other plants. But from the
 strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds, as peas and
 beans, when sown in the midst of long grass, it may be suspected
 that the chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the
 growth of the seedlings, whilst struggling with other plants growing
 vigorously all around.
   </p><p>Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or
 quadruple its numbers? We know that it can perfectly well withstand
 a little more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for elsewhere it
 ranges into slightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts. In
 this case we can clearly see that if we wish in imagination to give
 the plant the power of increasing in number, we should have to give it
 some advantage over its competitors, or over the animals which prey on
 it. On the confines of its geographical range, a change of
 constitution with respect to climate would clearly be an advantage
 to our plant; but we have reason to believe that only a few plants
 or animals range so far, that they are destroyed exclusively by the
 rigour of the climate. Not until we reach the extreme confines of
 life, in the Arctic regions or on the borders of an utter desert, will
 competition cease. The land may be extremely cold or dry, yet there
 will be competition between some few species, or between the
 individuals of the same species, for the warmest or dampest spots.
   </p><p>Hence we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new
 country amongst new competitors, the conditions of its life will
 generally be changed in an essential manner, although the climate
 may be exactly the same as in its former home. If its average
 numbers are to increase in its new home, we should have to modify it
 in a different way to what we should have had to do in its native
 country; for we should have to give it some advantage over a different
 set of competitors or enemies.
   </p><p>It is good thus to try in imagination to give to any one species
 an advantage over another. Probably in no single instance should we
 know what to do. This ought to convince us of our ignorance on the
 mutual relations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary as
 it is difficult to acquire. All that we can do, is to keep steadily in
 mind that each organic being is striving to increase in a
 geometrical ratio; that each at some period of its life, during some
 season of the year, during each generation or at intervals, has to
 struggle for life and to suffer great destruction. When we reflect
 on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief,
 that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that
 death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the
 happy survive and multiply.
