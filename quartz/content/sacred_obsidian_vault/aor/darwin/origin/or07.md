 <h3>Chapter VII: Miscellaneous Objections to the Theory of Natural Selection</h3>
 
   <p>I WILL devote this chapter to the consideration of various
 miscellaneous objections which have been advanced against my views, as
 some of the previous discussions may thus be made clearer; but it
 would be useless to discuss all of them, as many have been made by
 writers who have not taken the trouble to understand the subject. Thus
 a distinguished German naturalist has asserted that the weakest part
 of my theory is, that I consider all organic beings as imperfect: what
 I have really said is, that all are not as perfect as they might
 have been in relation to their conditions; and this is shown to be the
 case by so many native forms in many quarters of the world having
 yielded their places to intruding foreigners. Nor can organic
 beings, even if they were at any one time perfectly adapted to their
 conditions of life, have remained so, when their conditions changed,
 unless they themselves likewise changed; and no one will dispute
 that the physical conditions of each country, as well as the numbers
 and kinds of its inhabitants, have undergone many mutations.
   </p><p>A critic has lately insisted, with some parade of mathematical
 accuracy, that longevity is a great advantage to all species, so
 that he who believes in natural selection "must arrange his
 genealogical tree" in such a manner that all the descendants have
 longer lives than their progenitors! Cannot our critic conceive that a
 biennial plant or one of the lower animals might range into a cold
 climate and perish there every winter; and yet, owing to advantages
 gained through natural selection, survive from year to year by means
 of its seeds or ova? Mr. E. Ray Lankester has recently discussed
 this subject, and he concludes, as far as its extreme complexity
 allows him to form a judgment, that longevity is generally related
 to the standard of each species in the scale of organisation, as
 well as to the amount of expenditure in reproduction and in general
 activity. And these conditions have, it is probable, been largely
 determined through natural selection.
   </p><p>It has been argued that, as none of the animals and plants of Egypt,
 of which we know anything, have changed during the last three or
 four thousand years, so probably have none in any part of the world.
 But, as Mr. G. H. Lewes has remarked, this line of argument proves too
 much, for the ancient domestic races figured on the Egyptian
 monuments, or embalmed, are closely similar or even identical with
 those now living; yet all naturalists admit that such races have
 been produced through the modification of their original types. The
 many animals which have remained unchanged since the commencement of
 the glacial period, would have been an incomparably stronger case, for
 these have been exposed to great changes of climate and have
 migrated over great distances; whereas, in Egypt, during the last
 several thousand years, the conditions of life, as far as we know,
 have remained absolutely uniform. The fact of little or no
 modification having been effected since the glacial period would
 have been of some avail against those who believe in an innate and
 necessary law of development, but is powerless against the doctrine of
 natural selection or the survival of the fittest, which implies that
 when variations or individual differences of a beneficial nature
 happen to arise, these will be preserved; but this will be effected
 only under certain favourable circumstances.
   </p><p>The celebrated palaeontologist, Bronn, at the close of his German
 translation of this work, asks, how, on the principle of natural
 selection, can a variety live side by side with the parent species? If
 both have become fitted for slightly different habits of life or
 conditions, they might live together; and if we lay on one side
 polymorphic species, in which the variability seems to be of a
 peculiar nature, and all mere temporary variations, such as size,
 albinism, &amp;c., the more permanent varieties are generally found, as
 far as I can discover, inhabiting distinct stations,- such as high
 land or low land, dry or moist districts. Moreover, in the case of
 animals which wander much about and cross freely, their varieties seem
 to be generally confined to distinct regions.
   </p><p>Bronn also insists that distinct species never differ from each
 other in single characters, but in many parts; and he asks, how it
 always comes that many parts of the organisation should have been
 modified at the same time through variation and natural selection .
 " But there is no necessity for supposing that all the parts of any
 being have been simultaneously modified. The most striking
 modifications, excellently adapted for some purpose, might, as was
 formerly remarked, be acquired by successive variations, if slight,
 first in one part and then in another; and as they would be
 transmitted all together, they would appear to us as if they had
 been simultaneously developed. The best answer, however, to the
 above objection is afforded by those domestic races which have been
 modified, chiefly through man's power of selection, for some special
 purpose. Look at the race and dray horse, or at the greyhound and
 mastiff. Their whole frames and even their mental characteristics have
 been modified; but if we could trace each step in the history of their
 transformation,- and the latter steps can be traced,- we should not
 see great and simultaneous changes, but first one part and then
 another slightly modified and improved. Even when selection has been
 applied by man to some one character alone,- of which our cultivated
 plants offer the best instances,- it will invariably be found that
 although this one part, whether it be the flower, fruit, or leaves,
 has been greatly changed, almost all the other parts have been
 slightly modified. This may be attributed partly to the principle of
 correlated growth, and partly to so-called spontaneous variation.
   </p><p>A much more serious objection has been urged by Bronn, and
 recently by Broca, namely, that many characters appear to be of no
 service whatever to their possessors, and therefore cannot have been
 influenced through natural selection. Bronn adduces the length of
 the ears and tails in the different species of hares and mice,- the
 complex folds of enamel in the teeth of many animals, and a
 multitude of analogous cases. With respect to plants, this subject has
 been discussed by Nageli in an admirable essay. He admits that natural
 selection has effected much, but he insists that the families of
 plants differ chiefly from each other in morphological characters,
 which appear to be quite unimportant for the welfare of the species.
 He consequently believes in an innate tendency towards progressive and
 more perfect development. He specifies the arrangement of the cells in
 the tissues, and of the leaves on the axis, as cases in which
 natural selection could not have acted. To these may be added the
 numerical divisions in the parts of the flower, the position of the
 ovules, the shape of the seed, when not of any use for
 dissemination, &amp;c.
   </p><p>There is much force in the above objection. Nevertheless, we
 ought, in the first place, to be extremely cautious in pretending to
 decide what structures now are, or have formerly been, use to each
 species. In the second place, it should always be borne in mind that
 when part is modified, so will be other parts, through certain dimly
 seen causes, such as an increased or diminished flow of nutriment to a
 part, mutual pressure, an early developed part affecting one
 subsequently developed, and so forth,- as well as through other causes
 which lead to the many mysterious cases of correlation, which we do
 not in the least understand. These agencies may be all grouped
 together, for the sake of brevity, under the expression of the laws of
 growth. In the third place, we have to allow for the direct and
 definite action of changed conditions of life, and for so-called
 spontaneous variations, in which the nature of the conditions
 apparently plays a quite subordinate part. Bud-variations, such as the
 appearance of a moss-rose on a common rose, or of a nectarine on a
 peach tree offer good instances of spontaneous variations; but even in
 these cases, if we bear in mind the power of a minute drop of poison
 in producing complex galls, we ought not to feel too sure that the
 above variations are not the effect of some local change in the nature
 of the sap, due to some change in the conditions. There must be some
 efficient cause for each slight individual difference, as well as
 for more strongly marked variations which occasionally arise; and if
 the unknown cause were to act persistently, it is almost certain
 that all the individuals of the species would be similarly modified.
   </p><p>In the earlier editions of this work I underrated, as it now seems
 probable, the frequency and importance of modifications due to
 spontaneous variability. But it is impossible to attribute to this
 cause the innumerable structures which are so well adapted to the
 habits of life of each species. I can no more believe in this than
 that the well-adapted form of a race-horse or greyhound, which
 before the principle of selection by man was well understood,
 excited so much surprise in the minds of the older naturalists, can
 thus be explained.
   </p><p>It may be worth while to illustrate some of the foregoing remarks.
 With respect to the assumed inutility of various parts and organs,
 it is hardly necessary to observe that even in the higher and
 best-known animals many structures exist, which are so highly
 developed that no one doubts that they are of importance, yet their
 use has not been, or has only recently been, ascertained. As Bronn
 gives the length of the ears and tail in the several species of mice
 as instances, though trifling ones, of differences in structure
 which can be of no special use, I may mention that, according to Dr.
 Schobl, the external ears of the common mouse are supplied in an
 extraordinary manner with nerves, so that they no doubt serve as
 tactile organs; hence the length of the ears can hardly be quite
 unimportant. We shall, also, presently see that the tail is a highly
 useful prehensile organ to some of the species; and its use would be
 much influenced by its length.
   </p><p>With respect to plants, to which on account of Nageli's essay I
 shall confine myself in the following remarks, it will be admitted
 that the flowers of orchids present a multitude of curious structures,
 which a few years ago would have been considered as mere morphological
 differences without any special function; but they are now known to be
 of the highest importance for the fertilisation of the species through
 the aid of insects, and have probably been gained through natural
 selection. No one until lately would have imagined that in dimorphic
 and trimorphic plants the different lengths of the stamens and
 pistils, and their arrangement, could have been of any service, but
 now we know this to be the case.
   </p><p>In certain whole groups of plants the ovules stand erect, and in
 others they are suspended; and within the same ovarium of some few
 plants, one ovule holds the former and a second ovule the latter
 position. These positions seem at first purely morphological, or of no
 physiological signification; but Dr. Hooker informs me that within the
 same ovarium, the upper ovules alone in some cases, and in other cases
 the lower ones alone are fertilised; and he suggests that this
 probably depends on the direction in which the pollen-tubes enter
 the ovarium. If so, the position of the ovules, even when one is erect
 and the other suspended within the same ovarium, would follow from the
 selection of any slight deviations in position which favoured their
 fertilisation, and the production of seed.
   </p><p>Several plants belonging to distinct orders habitually produce
 flowers of two kinds,- the one open of the ordinary structure, the
 other closed and imperfect. These two kinds of flowers sometimes
 differ wonderfully in structure, yet may be seen to graduate into each
 other on the same plant. The ordinary and open flowers can be
 intercrossed; and the benefits which certainly are derived from this
 process are thus secured. The closed and imperfect flowers are,
 however, manifestly of high importance, as they yield with the
 utmost safety a large stock of seed, with the expenditure of
 wonderfully little pollen. The two kinds of flowers often differ much,
 as just stated, in structure. The petals in the imperfect flowers
 almost always consist of mere rudiments, and the pollen-grains are
 reduced in diameter. In Ononis columnae five of the alternate
 stamens are rudimentary; and in some species of Viola three stamens
 are in this state, two retaining their proper function, but being of
 very small size. In six out of thirty of the closed flowers in an
 Indian violet (name unknown, for the plants have never produced with
 me perfect flowers), the sepals are reduced from the normal number
 of five to three. In one section of the Malpighiaceae the closed
 flowers, according to A. de Jussieu, are still further modified, for
 the five stamens which stand opposite to the sepals are all aborted,
 sixth stamen standing opposite to a petal being alone developed; and
 this stamen is not present in the ordinary flowers of these species;
 the style is aborted; and the ovaria are reduced from three to two.
 Now although natural selection may well have had the power to
 prevent some of the flowers from expanding, and to reduce the amount
 of pollen, when rendered by the closure of the flowers superfluous,
 yet hardly any of the above special modifications can have been thus
 determined, but must have followed from the laws of growth,
 including the functional inactivity of parts, during the progress of
 the reduction of the pollen and the closure of the flowers.
   </p><p>It is so necessary to appreciate the important effects of the laws
 of growth, that I will give some additional cases of another kind,
 namely of differences in the same part or organ, due to differences in
 relative position on the same plant. In the Spanish chestnut, and in
 certain fir-trees, the angles of divergence of the leaves differ,
 according to Schacht, in the nearly horizontal and in the upright
 branches. In the common rue and some other plants, one flower, usually
 the central or terminal one, opens first, and has five sepals and
 petals, and five divisions to the ovarium; whilst all the other
 flowers on the plant are tetramerous. In the British Adoxa the
 uppermost flower generally has two calyx-lobes with the other organs
 tetramerous, whilst the surrounding flowers generally have three
 calyx-lobes with the other organs pentamerous. In many Compositae
 and Umbelliferae (and in some other plants) the circumferential
 flowers have their corollas much more developed than those of the
 centre; and this seems often connected with the abortion of the
 reproductive organs. It is a more curious fact, previously referred
 to, that the achenes or seeds of the circumference and centre
 sometimes differ greatly in form, colour, and other characters. In
 Carthamus and some other Compositae the central achenes alone are
 furnished with a pappus; and in Hyoseris the same head yields
 achenes of three different forms. In certain Umbelliferae the exterior
 seeds, according to Tausch, are orthospermous, and the central one
 coelospermous, and this is a character which was considered by De
 Candolle to be in other species of the highest systematic
 importance. Prof. Braun mentions a Fumariaceous genus, in which the
 flowers in the lower part of the spike bear oval, ribbed, one-seeded
 nutlets; and in the upper part of the spike, lanceolate, two-valved,
 and two-seeded siliques. In these several cases, with the exception of
 that of the well developed rayflorets, which are of service in
 making the flowers conspicuous to insects, natural selection cannot,
 as far as we can judge, have come into play, or only in a quite
 subordinate manner. All these modifications follow from the relative
 position and inter-action of the parts; and it can hardly be doubted
 that if all the flowers and leaves on the same plant had been
 subjected to the same external and internal condition, as are the
 flowers and leaves in certain positions, all would have been
 modified in the same manner.
   </p><p>In numerous other cases we find modifications of structure, which
 are considered by botanists to be generally of a highly important
 nature, affecting only some of the flowers on the same plant, or
 occurring on distinct plants, which grow close together under the same
 conditions. As these variations seem of no special use to the
 plants, they cannot have been influenced by natural selection. Of
 their cause we are quite ignorant; we cannot even attribute them, as
 in the last class of cases, to any proximate agency, such as
 relative position. I will give only a few instances. It is so common
 to observe on the same plant, flowers indifferently tetramerous,
 pentamerous, &amp;c., that I need not give examples; but as numerical
 variations are comparatively rare when the parts are few, I may
 mention that, according to De Candolle, the flowers of Papaver
 bracteatum offer either two sepals with four petals (which is the
 common type with poppies), or three sepals with six petals. The manner
 in which the petals are folded in the bud is in most groups a very
 constant morphological character; but Professor Asa Gray states that
 with some species of Mimulus, the aestivation is almost as
 frequently that of the Rhinanthideae as of the Antirrhinideae, to
 which latter tribe the genus belongs. Auguste de Saint-Hilaire gives
 the following cases: the genus Zanthoxylon belongs to a division of
 the Rutacese with a single ovary, but in some species flowers may be
 found on the same plant, and even in the same panicle, with either one
 or two ovaries. In Helianthemum the capsule has been described as
 unilocular or trilocular; and in H. mutabile, "Une lame, plus ou moins
 large, s'etend entre le pericarpe et le placenta." In the flowers of
 Saponaria officinalis, Dr. Masters has observed instances of both
 marginal and free central placentation. Lastly, Saint-Hilaire found
 towards the southern extreme of the range of Gomphia oleaeformis two
 forms which he did not at first doubt were distinct species, but he
 subsequently saw them growing on the same bush; and he then adds,
 "Voila donc dans un meme individu des loges et un style qui se
 rattachent tantot a un axe verticale et tantot a un gynobase."
   </p><p>We thus see that with plants many morphological changes may be
 attributed to the laws of growth and the inter-action of parts,
 independently of natural selection. But with respect to Nageli's
 doctrine of an innate tendency towards perfection or progressive
 development, can it be said in the case of these strongly pronounced
 variations, that the plants have been caught in the act of progressing
 towards a higher state of development? On the contrary, I should infer
 from the mere fact of the parts in question differing or varying
 greatly on the same plant, that such modifications were of extremely
 small importance to the plants themselves, of whatever importance they
 may generally be to us for our classifications. The acquisition of a
 useless part can hardly be said to raise an organism in the natural
 scale; and in the case of the imperfect, closed flowers above
 described, if any new principle has to be invoked, it must be one of
 retrogression rather than of progression; and so it must be with
 many parasitic and degraded animals. We are ignorant of the exciting
 cause of the above specified modifications; but if the unknown cause
 were to act almost uniformly for a length of time, we may infer that
 the result would be almost uniform; and in this case all the
 individuals of the species would be modified in the same manner.
   </p><p>From the fact of the above characters being unimportant for the
 welfare of the species, any slight variations which occurred in them
 would not have been accumulated and augmented through natural
 selection. A structure which has been developed through long-continued
 selection, when it ceases to be of service to a species, generally
 becomes variable, as we see with rudimentary organs; for it will no
 longer be regulated by this same power of selection. But when, from
 the nature of the organism and of the conditions, modifications have
 been induced which are unimportant for the welfare of the species,
 they may be, and apparently often have been, transmitted in nearly the
 same state to numerous, otherwise modified, descendants. It cannot
 have been of much importance to the greater number of mammals,
 birds, or reptiles, whether they were clothed with hair, feathers,
 or scales; yet hair has been transmitted to almost all mammals,
 feathers to all birds, and scales to all true reptiles. A structure,
 whatever it may be, which is common to many allied forms, is ranked by
 us as of high systematic importance, and consequently is often assumed
 to be of high vital importance to the species. Thus, as I am
 inclined to believe, differences, which we consider as important- such
 as the arrangement of the leaves, the divisions of the flower or of
 the ovarium, the position of the ovules, &amp;c.- first appeared in many
 cases as fluctuating variations, which sooner or later became constant
 through the nature of the organism and of the surrounding
 conditions, as well as through the intercrossing of distinct
 individuals, but not through natural selection; for as these
 morphological characters do not affect the welfare of the species, any
 slight deviations in them could not have been governed or
 accumulated through this latter agency. It is a strange result which
 we thus arrive at, namely that characters of slight vital importance
 to the species, are the most important to the systematist; but, as
 we shall hereafter see when we treat of the genetic principle of
 classification, this is by no means so paradoxical as it may at
 first appear.
   </p><p>Although we have no good evidence of the existence in organic beings
 of an innate tendency towards progressive development, yet this
 necessarily follows, as I have attempted to show in the fourth
 chapter, through the continued action of natural selection. For the
 best definition which has ever been given of a high standard of
 organisation, is the degree to which the parts have been specialised
 or differentiated; and natural selection tends towards this end,
 inasmuch as the parts are thus enabled to perform their functions more
 efficiently.
 
   </p><p>A distinguished zoologist, Mr. St. George Mivart, has recently
 collected all the objections which have ever been advanced by myself
 and others against the theory of natural selection, as propounded by
 Mr. Wallace and myself, and has illustrated them with admirable art
 and force. When thus marshalled, they make a formidable array; and
 as it forms no part of Mr. Mivart's plan to give the various facts and
 considerations opposed to his conclusions, no slight effort of
 reason and memory is left to the reader, who may wish to weigh the
 evidence on both sides. When discussing special cases, Mr. Mivart
 passes over the effects of the increased use and disuse of parts,
 which I have always maintained to be highly important, and have
 treated in my Variation under Domestication at greater length than, as
 I believe, any other writer. He likewise often assumes that I
 attribute nothing to variation, independently of natural selection,
 whereas in the work just referred to I have collected a greater number
 of well-established cases than can be found in any other work known to
 me. My judgment may not be trustworthy, but after reading with care
 Mr. Mivart's book, and comparing each section with what I have said on
 the same head, I never before felt so strongly convinced of the
 general truth of the conclusions here arrived at, subject, of
 course, in so intricate a subject, to much partial error.
   </p><p>All Mr. Mivart's objections will be, or have been, considered in the
 present volume. The one new point which appears to have struck many
 readers is, "that natural selection is incompetent to account for
 the incipient stages of useful structures." This subject is intimately
 connected with that of the gradation of characters, often
 accompanied by a change of function,- for instance, the conversion
 of a swimbladder into lungs,- points which were discussed in the
 last chapter under two headings. Nevertheless, I will here consider in
 some detail several of the cases advanced by Mr. Mivart, selecting
 those which are the most illustrative, as want of space prevents me
 from considering all.
   </p><p>The giraffe, by its lofty stature, much elongated neck, fore-legs,
 head and tongue, has its whole frame beautifully adapted for
 browsing on the higher branches of trees. It can thus obtain food
 beyond the reach of the other Ungulata or hoofed animals inhabiting
 the same country; and this must be a great advantage to it during
 dearths. The Niata cattle in S. America show us how small a difference
 in structure may make, during such periods, a great difference in
 preserving an animal's life. These cattle can browse as well as others
 on grass, but from the projection of the lower jaw they cannot, during
 the often recurrent droughts, browse on the twigs of trees, reeds,
 &amp;c., to which food the common cattle and horses are then driven; so
 that at these times the Niatas perish, if not fed by their owners.
 Before coming to Mr. Mivart's objections, it may be well to explain
 once again how natural selection will act in all ordinary cases. Man
 has modified some of his animals, without necessarily having
 attended to special points of structure, by simply preserving and
 breeding from the fleetest individuals, as with the race-horse and
 greyhound, or as with the game-cock, by breeding from the victorious
 birds. So under nature with the nascent giraffe the individuals
 which were the highest browsers, and were able during dearths to reach
 even an inch or two above the others, will often have been
 preserved; for they will have roamed over the whole country in
 search of food. That the individuals of the same species often
 differ slightly in the relative lengths of all their parts may be seen
 in many works of natural history, in which careful measurements are
 given. These slight proportional differences, due to the laws of
 growth and variation, are not of the slightest use or importance to
 most species. But it will have been otherwise with the nascent
 giraffe, considering its probable habits of life; for those
 individuals which had some one part or several parts of their bodies
 rather more elongated than usual, would generally have survived. These
 will have intercrossed and left offspring, either inheriting the
 same bodily peculiarities, or with a tendency to vary again in the
 same manner; whilst the individuals, less favoured in the same
 respects, will have been the most liable to perish.
   </p><p>We here see that there is no need to separate single pairs, as man
 does, when he methodically improves a breed: natural selection will
 preserve and thus separate all the superior individuals, allowing them
 freely to intercross, and will destroy all the inferior individuals.
 By this process long-continued, which exactly corresponds with what
 I have called unconscious selection by man, combined no doubt in a
 most important manner with the inherited effects of the increased
 use of parts, it seems to me almost certain that an ordinary hoofed
 quadruped might be converted into a giraffe.
   </p><p>To this conclusion Mr. Mivart brings forward two objections. One
 is that the increased size of the body would obviously require an
 increased supply of food, and he considers it as "very problematical
 whether the disadvantages thence arising would not, in times of
 scarcity, more than counterbalance the advantages." But as the giraffe
 does actually exist in large numbers in S. Africa, and as some of
 the largest antelopes in the world, taller than an ox, abound there,
 why should we doubt that, as far as size is concerned, intermediate
 gradations could formerly have existed there, subjected as now to
 severe dearths. Assuredly the being able to reach, at each stage of
 increased size, to a supply of food, left untouched by the other
 hoofed quadrupeds of the country, would have been of some advantage to
 the nascent giraffe. Nor must we overlook the fact, that increased
 bulk would act as a protection against almost all beasts of prey
 excepting the lion; and against this animal, its tall neck,- and the
 taller the better,- would, as Mr. Chauncey Wright has remarked,
 serve as a watch-tower. It is from this cause, as Sir S. Baker
 remarks, that no animal is more difficult to stalk than the giraffe.
 This animal also uses its long neck as a means of offence or
 defence, by violently swinging his head armed with stump-like horns.
 The preservation of each species can rarely be determined by any one
 advantage, but by the union of all, great and small.
   </p><p>Mr. Mivart then asks (and this is his second objection), if
 natural selection be so potent, and if high browsing be so great an
 advantage, why has not any other hoofed quadruped acquired a long neck
 and lofty stature, besides the giraffe, and, in a lesser degree, the
 camel, guanaeo, and macrauchenia? Or, again, why has not any member of
 the group acquired a long proboscis? With respect to S. Africa,
 which was formerly inhabited by numerous herds of the giraffe, the
 answer is not difficult, and can best be given by an illustration.
 In every meadow in England in which trees grow, we see the lower
 branches trimmed or planed to an exact level by the browsing of the
 horses or cattle; and what advantage would it be, for instance, to
 sheep, if kept there, to acquire slightly longer necks? In every
 district some one kind of animal will almost certainly be able to
 browse higher than the others; and it is almost equally certain that
 this one kind alone could have its neck elongated for this purpose,
 through natural selection and the effects of increased use. In S.
 Africa the competition for browsing on the higher branches of the
 acacias and other trees must be between giraffe and giraffe, and not
 with the other ungulate animals.
   </p><p>Why, in other quarters of the world, various animals belonging to
 this same order have not acquired either an elongated neck or a
 proboscis, cannot be distinctly answered; but it is as unreasonable to
 expect a distinct answer to such a question, as why some event in
 the history of mankind did not occur in one country, whilst it did
 in another. We are ignorant with respect to the conditions which
 determine the numbers and range of each species; and we cannot even
 conjecture what changes of structure would be favourable to its
 increase in some new country. We can, however, see in a general manner
 that various causes might have interfered with the development of a
 long neck or proboscis. To reach the foliage at a considerable
 height (without climbing, for which hoofed animals are singularly
 ill-constructed) implies greatly increased bulk of body; and we know
 that some areas support singularly few large quadrupeds, for
 instance S. America, though it is so luxuriant; whilst S. Africa
 abounds with them to an unparalleled degree. Why this should be so, we
 do not know; nor why the later tertiary periods should have been so
 much more favourable for their existence than the present time.
 Whatever the causes may have been, we can see that certain districts
 and times would have been much more favourable than others for the
 development of so large a quadruped as the giraffe.
   </p><p>In order that an animal should acquire some structure specially
 and largely developed, it is almost indispensable that several other
 parts should be modified and co-adapted. Although every part of the
 body varies slightly, it does not follow that the necessary parts
 should always vary in the right direction and to the right degree.
 With the different species of our domesticated animals we know that
 the parts vary in a different manner and degree; and that some species
 are much more variable than others. Even if the fitting variations did
 arise, it does not follow that natural selection would be able to
 act on them, and produce a structure which apparently would be
 beneficial to the species. For instance, if the number of
 individuals existing in a country is determined chiefly through
 destruction by beasts of prey,- by external or internal parasites,
 &amp;c.,- as seems often to be the case, then natural selection will be
 able to do little, or will be greatly retarded, in modifying any
 particular structure for obtaining food. Lastly, natural selection
 is a slow process, and the same favourable conditions must long endure
 in order that any marked effect should thus be produced. Except by
 assigning such general and vague reasons, we cannot explain why, in
 many quarters of the world, hoofed quadrupeds have not acquired much
 elongated necks or other means for browsing on the higher branches
 of trees.
   </p><p>Objections of the same nature as the foregoing have been advanced by
 man writers. In each case various causes, besides the general ones
 just indicated, have probably interfered with the acquisition
 through natural selection of structures, which it is thought would
 be beneficial to certain species. One writer asks, why has not the
 ostrich acquired the power of flight? But a moment's reflection will
 show what an enormous supply of food would be necessary to give to
 this bird of the desert force to move its huge body through the air.
 Oceanic islands are inhabited by bats and seals, but by no terrestrial
 mammals; yet as some of these bats are peculiar species, they must
 have long inhabited their present homes. Therefore Sir C. Lyell
 asks, and assigns certain reasons in answer, why have not seals and
 bats given birth on such islands to forms fitted to live on the
 land? But seals would necessarily be first converted into
 terrestrial carnivorous animals of considerable size, and bats into
 terrestrial insectivorous animals; for the former there would be no
 prey; for the bats ground-insects would serve as food, but these would
 already be largely preyed on by the reptiles or birds, which first
 colonise and abound on most oceanic islands. Gradations of
 structure, with each stage beneficial to a changing species, will be
 favoured only under certain peculiar conditions. A strictly
 terrestrial animal, by occasionally hunting for food in shallow water,
 then in streams or lakes, might at last be converted into an animal so
 thoroughly aquatic as to brave the open ocean. But seals would not
 find on oceanic islands the conditions favourable to their gradual
 reconversion into a terrestrial form. Bats, as formerly shown,
 probably acquired their wings by at first gliding through the air from
 tree to tree, like the so-called flying squirrels, for the sake of
 escaping from their enemies, or for avoiding falls; but when the power
 of true flight had once been acquired, it would never be reconverted
 back, at least for the above purposes, into the less efficient power
 of gliding through the air. Bats might, indeed, like many birds,
 have had their wings greatly reduced in size, or completely lost,
 through disuse; but in this case it would be necessary that they
 should first have acquired the power of running quickly on the ground,
 by the aid of their hind legs alone, so as to compete with birds or
 other ground animals; and for such a change a bat seems singularly
 ill-fitted. These conjectural remarks have been made merely to show
 that a transition of structure, with each step beneficial, is a highly
 complex affair; and that there is nothing strange in a transition
 not having occurred in any particular case.
   </p><p>Lastly, more than one writer has asked, why have some animals had
 their mental powers more highly developed than others, as such
 development would be advantageous to an? Why have not apes acquired
 the intellectual powers of man? Various causes could be assigned;
 but as they are conjectural, and their relative probability cannot
 be weighed, it would be useless to give them. A definite answer to the
 latter question ought not to be expected, seeing that no one can solve
 the simpler problem why, of two races of savages, one has risen higher
 in the scale of civilisation than the other; and this apparently
 implies increased brain-power.
   </p><p>We will return to Mr. Mivart's other objections. Insects often
 resemble for the sake of protection various objects, such as green
 or decayed leaves, dead twigs, bits of lichen, flowers, spines,
 excrement of birds, and living insects; but to this latter point I
 shall hereafter recur. The resemblance is often wonderfully close, and
 is not confined to colour, but extends to form, and even to the manner
 in which the insects hold themselves. The caterpillars which project
 motionless like dead twigs from the bushes on which they feed, offer
 an excellent instance of a resemblance of this kind. The cases of
 the imitation of such objects as the excrement of birds, are rare
 and exceptional. On this head, Mr. Mivart remarks, "As, according to
 Mr. Darwin's theory, there is a constant tendency to indefinite
 variation, and as the minute incipient variations will be in all
 directions, they must tend to neutralise each other, and at first to
 form such unstable modifications that it is difficult, if not
 impossible, to see how such indefinite oscillations of infinitesimal
 beginnings can ever build up a sufficiently appreciable resemblance to
 a leaf, bamboo, or other object, for Natural Selection to seize upon
 and perpetuate."
   </p><p>But in all the foregoing cases the insects in their original state
 no doubt presented some rude and accidental resemblance to an object
 commonly found in the stations frequented by them. Nor is this at
 all improbable, considering the almost infinite number of
 surrounding objects and the diversity in form and colour of the
 hosts of insects which exist. As some rude resemblance is necessary
 for the first start, we can understand how it is that the larger and
 higher animals do not (with the exception, as far as I know, of one
 fish) resemble for the sake of protection special objects, but only
 the surface which commonly surrounds them, and this chiefly in colour.
 Assuming that an insect originally happened to resemble in some degree
 a dead twig or a decayed leaf, and that it varied slightly in many
 ways, then all the variations which rendered the insect at all more
 like any such object, and thus favoured its escape, would be
 preserved, whilst other variations would be neglected and ultimately
 lost; or, if they rendered the insect at all less like the imitated
 object, they would be eliminated. There would indeed be force in Mr.
 Mivart's objection, if we were to attempt to account for the above
 resemblances, independently of natural selection, through mere
 fluctuating variability; but as the case stands there is none.
   </p><p>Nor can I see any force in Mr. Mivart's difficulty with respect to
 "the last touches of perfection in the mimicry"; as in the case
 given by Mr. Wallace, of a walking-stick insect (Ceroxylus laceratus),
 which resembles "a stick grown over by a creeping moss or
 jungermannia." So close was this resemblance, that a native Dyak
 maintained that the foliaceous excrescences were really moss.
 Insects are preyed on by birds and other enemies, whose sight is
 probably sharper than ours, and every grade in resemblance which aided
 an insect to escape notice or detection, would tend towards its
 preservation; and the more perfect the resemblance so much the
 better for the insect. Considering the nature of the differences
 between the species in the group which includes the above Ceroxylus,
 there is nothing improbable in this insect having varied in the
 irregularities on its surface, and in these having become more or less
 green-coloured; for in every group the characters which differ in
 the several species are the most apt to vary, whilst the generic
 characters, or those common to all the species, are the most constant.
 
   </p><p>The Greenland whale is one of the most wonderful animals in the
 world, and the baleen, or whale-bone, one of its greatest
 peculiarities. The baleen consists of a row, on each side of the upper
 jaw, of about 300 plates or laminae, which stand close together
 transversely to the longer axis of the mouth. Within the main row
 there are some subsidiary rows. The extremities and inner margins of
 all the plates are frayed into stiff bristles, which clothe the
 whole gigantic palate, and serve to strain or sift the water, and thus
 to secure the minute prey on which these great animals subsist. The
 middle and longest lamina in the Greenland whale is ten, twelve, or
 even fifteen feet in length; but in the different species of cetaceans
 there are gradations in length; the middle lamina being in one
 species, according to Scoresby, four feet, in another three, in
 another eighteen inches, and in the Balaenoptera rostrata only about
 nine inches in length. The quality of the whale-bone also differs in
 the different species.
   </p><p>With respect to the baleen, Mr. Mivart remarks that if it "had
 once attained such a size and development as to be at all useful, then
 its preservation and augmentation within serviceable limits would be
 promoted by natural selection alone. But how to obtain the beginning
 of such useful development?" In answer, it may be asked, why should
 not the early progenitors of the whales with baleen have possessed a
 mouth constructed something like the lamellated beak of a duck? Ducks,
 like whales, subsist by sifting the mud and water; and the family
 has sometimes been called Criblatores, or sifters. I hope that I may
 not be misconstrued into saying that the progenitors of whales did
 actually possess mouths lamellated like the beak of a duck. I wish
 only to show that this is not incredible, and that the immense
 plates of baleen in the Greenland whale might have been developed from
 such lamellae by finely graduated steps, each of service to its
 possessor.
   </p><p>The beak of a shoveller-duck (Spatula elypedta) is a more
 beautiful and complex structure than the mouth of a whale. The upper
 mandible is furnished on each side (in the specimen examined by me)
 with a row or comb formed of 188 thin, elastic lamellae, obliquely
 bevelled so as to be pointed, and placed transversely to the longer
 axis of the mouth. They arise from the palate, and are attached by
 flexible membrane to the sides of the mandible. Those standing towards
 the middle are the longest, being about one-third of an inch in
 length, and they project .14 of an inch beneath the edge. At their
 bases there is a short subsidiary row of obliquely transverse
 lamellae. In these several respects they resemble the plates of baleen
 in the mouth of a whale. But towards the extremity of the beak they
 differ much, as they project inwards, instead of straight downwards.
 The entire head of the shoveller, though incomparably less bulky, is
 about one-eighteenth of the length of the head of a moderately large
 Balaenoptera rostrata, in which species the baleen is only nine inches
 long; so that if we were to make the head of the shoveller as long
 as that of the Balaenoptera, the lamellae would be six inches in
 length,- that is, two-thirds of the length of the baleen in this
 species of whale. The lower mandible of the shoveller-duck is
 furnished with lamellae of equal length with those above, but finer;
 and in being thus furnished it differs conspicuously from the lower
 jaw of a whale, which is destitute of baleen. On the other hand the
 extremities of these lower lamellae are frayed into fine bristly
 points, so that they thus curiously resemble the plates of baleen.
 In the genus Prion, a member of the distinct family of the petrels,
 the upper mandible alone is furnished with lamellae, which are well
 developed and project beneath the margin; so that the beak of this
 bird resembles in this respect the mouth of a whale.
   </p><p>From the highly developed structure of the shoveller's beak we may
 proceed (as I have learnt from information and specimens sent to me by
 Mr. Salvin), without any great break, as far as fitness for sifting is
 concerned, through the beak of the Merganetta armata, and in some
 respects through that of the Aix sponsa, to the beak of the common
 duck. In this latter species, the lamellae are much coarser than in
 the shoveller, and are firmly attached to the sides of the mandible;
 they are only about 50 in number on each side, and do not project at
 all beneath the margin. They are square-topped, and are edged with
 translucent hardish tissue, as if for crushing food. The edges of
 the lower mandible are crossed by numerous fine ridges, which
 project very little. Although the beak is thus very inferior as a
 sifter to that of the shoveller, yet this bird, as every one knows,
 constantly uses it for this purpose. There are other species, as I
 hear from Mr. Salvin, in which the lamellae are considerably less
 developed than in the common duck; but I do not know whether they
 use their beaks for sifting the water.
   </p><p>Turning to another group of the same family: in the Egyptian goose
 (Chenalopex) the beak closely resembles that of the common ducks;
 but the lamellae are not so numerous, nor so distinct from each other,
 nor do they project so much inwards; yet this goose, as I am
 informed by Mr. E. Bartlett, "uses its bill like a duck by throwing
 the water out at the corners." Its chief food, however, is grass,
 which it crops like the common goose. In this latter bird, the
 lamellae of the upper mandible are much coarser than in the common
 duck, almost confluent, about 27 in number on each side, and
 terminating upwards in teeth-like knobs. The palate is also covered
 with hard rounded knobs. The edges of the lower mandible are
 serrated with teeth much more prominent, coarser, and sharper than
 in the duck. The common goose does not sift the water, but uses its
 beak exclusively for tearing or cutting herbage, for which purpose
 it is so well fitted, that it can crop grass closer than almost any
 other animal. There are other species of geese, as I hear from Mr.
 Bartlett, in which the lamellae are less developed than in the
 common goose.
   </p><p>We thus see that a member of the duck family, with a beak
 constructed like that of the common goose and adapted solely for
 grazing, or even a member with a beak having less well-developed
 lamellae, might be converted by small changes into a species like
 the Egyptian goose,- this into one like the common duck,- and, lastly,
 into one like the shoveller, provided with a beak almost exclusively
 adapted for sifting the water; for this bird could hardly use any part
 of its beak, except the hooked tip, for seizing or tearing solid food.
 The beak of a goose, as I may add, might also be converted by small
 changes into one provided with prominent, recurved teeth, like those
 of the merganser (a member of the same family), serving for the widely
 different purpose of securing live fish.
   </p><p>Returning to the whales: the Hyperoodon bidens is destitute of
 true teeth in an efficient condition, but its palate is roughened,
 according to Lacepide, with small, unequal, hard points of horn. There
 is, therefore, nothing improbable in supposing that some early
 cetacean form was provided with similar points of horn on the
 palate, but rather more regularly placed, and which, like the knobs on
 the beak of the goose, aided it in seizing or tearing its food. If so,
 it will hardly be denied that the points might have been converted
 through variation and natural selection into lamellae as well
 developed as those of the Egyptian goose, in which case they would
 have been used both for seizing objects and for sifting the water;
 then into lamellae like those of the domestic duck; and so onwards,
 until they became as well constructed as those of the shoveller, in
 which case they would have served exclusively as a sifting
 apparatus. From this stage, in which the lamellae would be
 two-thirds of the length of the plates of baleen in the Balaenoptera
 rostrata, gradations, which may be observed in still-existing
 cetaceans, lead us onwards to the enormous plates of baleen in the
 Greenland whale. Nor is there the least reason to doubt that each step
 in this scale might have been as serviceable to certain ancient
 cetaceans, with the functions of the parts slowly changing during
 the progress of development, as are the gradations in the beaks of the
 different existing members of the duck family. We should bear in
 mind that each species of duck is subjected to a severe struggle for
 existence, and that the structure of every part of its frame must be
 well adapted to its conditions of life.
   </p><p>The Pleuronectidae, or flat-fish, are remarkable for their
 asymmetrical bodies. They rest on one side,- in the greater number
 of species on the left, but in some on the right side; and
 occasionally reversed adult specimens occur. The lower, or
 resting-surface, resembles at first sight the ventral surface of an
 ordinary fish: it is of a white colour, less developed in many ways
 than the upper side, with the lateral fins often of smaller size.
 But the eyes offer the most remarkable peculiarity; for they are
 both placed on the upper side of the head. During early youth,
 however, they stand opposite to each other, and the whole body is then
 symmetrical, with both sides equally coloured. Soon the eye proper
 to the lower side begins to glide slowly round the head to the upper
 side; but does not pass right through the skull, as was formerly
 thought to be the case. It is obvious that unless the lower eye did
 thus travel round, it could not be used by the fish whilst lying in
 its habitual position on one side. The lower eye would, also, have
 been liable to be abraded by the sandy bottom. That the Pleuronectidae
 are admirably adapted by their flattened and asymmetrical structure
 for their habits of life, is manifest from several species, such as
 soles, flounders, &amp;c., being extremely common. The chief advantages
 thus gained seem to be protection from their enemies, and facility for
 feeding on the ground. The different members, however, of the family
 present, as Schiodte remarks, "a long series of forms exhibiting a
 gradual transition from Hippoglossus pinguis, which does not in any
 considerable degree alter the shape in which it leaves the ovum, to
 the soles, which are entirely thrown to one side."
   </p><p>Mr. Mivart has taken up this case, and remarks that a sudden
 spontaneous transformation in the position of the eyes is hardly
 conceivable, in which I quite agree with him. He then adds: "If the
 transit was gradual, then how such transit of one eye a minute
 fraction of the journey towards the other side of the head could
 benefit the individual is, indeed, far from clear. It seems, even,
 that such an incipient transformation must rather have been
 injurious." But he might have found an answer to this objection in the
 excellent observations published in 1867 by Malm. The Pleuronectidae
 whilst very young and still symmetrical, with their eyes standing on
 opposite sides of the head, cannot long retain a vertical position,
 owing to the excessive depth of their bodies, the small size of
 their lateral fins, and to their being destitute of a swimbladder.
 Hence soon growing tired, they fall to the bottom on one side.
 Whilst thus at rest they often twist, as Malm observed, the lower
 eye upwards, to see above them; and they do this so vigorously that
 the eye is pressed hard against the upper part of the orbit. The
 forehead between the eyes consequently becomes, as could be plainly
 seen, temporarily contracted in breadth. On one occasion Malm saw a
 young fish raise and depress the lower eye through an angular distance
 of about seventy degrees.
   </p><p>We should remember that the skull at this early age is cartilaginous
 and flexible, so that it readily yields to muscular action. It is also
 known with the higher animals, even after early youth, that the
 skull yields and is altered in shape, if the skin or muscles be
 permanently contracted through disease or some accident. With
 long-eared rabbits, if one ear lops forwards and downwards, its weight
 drags forward all the bones of the skull on the same side, of which
 I have given a figure. Malm states that the newly-hatched young of
 perches, salmon, and several other symmetrical fishes, have the
 habit of occasionally resting on one side at the bottom; and he has
 observed that they often then strain their lower eyes so as to look
 upwards; and their skulls are thus rendered rather crooked. These
 fishes, however, are soon able to hold themselves in a vertical
 position, and no permanent effect is thus produced. With the
 Pleuronectidae, on the other hand, the older they grow the more
 habitually they rest on one side, owing to the increasing flatness
 of their bodies, and a permanent effect is thus produced on the form
 of the head, and on the position of the eyes. Judging from analogy,
 the tendency to distortion would no doubt be increased through the
 principle of inheritance. Schiodte believes, in opposition to some
 other naturalists, that the Pleuronectidae are not quite symmetrical
 even in the embryo; and if this be so, we could understand how it is
 that certain species, whilst young, habitually fall over and rest on
 the left side, and other species on the right side. Malm adds, in
 confirmation of the above view, that the adult Trachypterus
 arcticus, which is not a member of the Pleuronectidae, rests on its
 left side at the bottom, and swims diagonally through the water; and
 in this fish, the two sides of the head are said to be somewhat
 dissimilar. Our great authority on fishes, Dr. Gunther, concludes
 his abstract of Malm's paper, by remarking that "the author gives a
 very simple explanation of the abnormal condition of the
 pleuronectoids."
   </p><p>We thus see that the first stages of the transit of the eye from one
 side of the head to the other, which Mr. Mivart considers would be
 injurious, may be attributed to the habit, no doubt beneficial to
 the individual and to the species, of endeavouring to look upwards
 with both eyes, whilst resting on one side at the bottom. We may
 also attribute to the inherited effects of use the fact of the mouth
 in several kinds of flat-fish being bent towards the lower surface,
 with the jaw bones stronger and more effective on this, the eyeless
 side of the head, than on the other, for the sake, as Dr. Traquair
 supposes, of feeding with ease on the ground. Disuse, on the other
 hand, will account for the less developed condition of the whole
 inferior half of the body, including the lateral fins; though Yarrel
 thinks that the reduced size of these fins is advantageous to the
 fish, as "there is so much less room for their action, than with the
 larger fins above." Perhaps the lesser number of teeth in the
 proportion of four to seven in the upper halves of the two jaws of the
 plaice, to twenty-five to thirty in the lower halves, may likewise
 be accounted for by disuse. From the colourless state of the ventral
 surface of most fishes and of many other animals, we may reasonably
 suppose that the absence of colour in flat-fish on the side, whether
 it be the right or left, which is undermost, is due to the exclusion
 of light. But it cannot be supposed that the peculiar speckled
 appearance of the upper side of the sole, so like the sandy bed of the
 sea, or the power in some species, as recently shown by Pouchet, of
 changing their colour in accordance with the surrounding surface, or
 the presence of bony tubercles on the upper side of the turbot, are
 due to the action of the light. Here natural selection has probably
 come into play, as well as in adapting the general shape of the body
 of these fishes, and many other peculiarities, to their habits of
 life. We should keep in mind, as I have before insisted, that the
 inherited effects of the increased use of parts, and perhaps of
 their disuse, will be strengthened by natural selection. For all
 spontaneous variations in the right direction will thus be
 preserved; as will those individuals which inherit in the highest
 degree the effects of the increased and beneficial use of any part.
 How much to attribute in each particular case to the effects of use,
 and how much to natural selection, it seems impossible to decide.
   </p><p>I may give another instance of a structure which apparently owes its
 origin exclusively to use or habit. The extremity of the tail in
 some American monkeys has been converted into a wonderfully perfect
 prehensile organ, and serves as a fifth hand. A reviewer who agrees
 with Mr. Mivart in every detail, remarks on this structure: "It is
 impossible to believe that in any number of ages the first slight
 incipient tendency to grasp could preserve the lives of the
 individuals possessing it, or favour their chance of having and of
 rearing offspring." But there is no necessity for any such belief.
 Habit, and this almost implies that some benefit great or small is
 thus derived, would in all probability suffice for the work. Brehm saw
 the young of an African monkey (Cercopithecus) clinging to the under
 surface of their mother by their hands, and at the same time they
 hooked their little tails round that of their mother. Professor
 Henslow kept in confinement some harvest mice (Mus messorius) which do
 not possess a structurally prehensile tail; but he frequently observed
 that they curled their tails round the branches of a bush placed in
 the cage, and thus aided themselves in climbing. I have received an
 analogous account from Dr. Gunther, who has seen a mouse thus
 suspend itself. If the harvest mouse had been more strictly
 arboreal, it would perhaps have had its tail rendered structurally
 prehensile, as is the case with some members of the same order. Why
 Cereopithecus, considering its habits whilst young, has not become
 thus provided, it would be difficult to say. It is, however,
 possible that the long tail of this monkey may be of more service to
 it as a balancing organ in making its prodigious leaps, than as a
 prehensile organ.
 
   </p><p>The mammary glands are common to the whole class of mammals, and are
 indispensable for their existence; they must, therefore, have been
 developed at an extremely remote period, and we can know nothing
 positively about their manner of development. Mr. Mivart asks: "Is
 it conceivable that the young of any animal was ever saved from
 destruction by accidentally sucking a drop of scarcely nutritious
 fluid from an accidentally hypertrophied cutaneous gland of its
 mother? And even if one was so, what chance was there of the
 perpetuation of such a variation?" But the case is not here put
 fairly. It is admitted by most evolutionists that mammals are
 descended from a marsupial form; and if so, the mammary glands will
 have been at first developed within the marsupial sack. In the case of
 the fish (Hippocampus) the eggs are hatched, and the young are
 reared for a time, within a sack of this nature; and an American
 naturalist, Mr. Lockwood, believes from what he has seen of the
 development of the young, that they are nourished by a secretion
 from the cutaneous glands of the sack. Now with the early
 progenitors of mammals, almost before they deserved to be thus
 designated, is it not at least possible that the young might have been
 similarly nourished? And in this case, the individuals which
 secreted a fluid, in some degree or manner the most nutritious, so
 as to partake of the nature of milk, would in the long run have reared
 a larger number of well-nourished offspring, than would the
 individuals which secreted a poorer fluid; and thus the cutaneous
 glands, which are the homologues of the mammary glands, would have
 been improved or rendered more effective. It accords with the widely
 extended principle of specialisation, that the glands over a certain
 space of the sack should have become more highly developed than the
 remainder; and they would then have formed a breast, but at first
 without a nipple as we see in the Ornithorhynchus, at the base of
 the mammalian series. Through what agency the glands over a certain
 space became more highly specialised than the others, I will not
 pretend to decide, whether in part through compensation of growth, the
 effects of use, or of natural selection.
   </p><p>The development of the mammary glands would have been of no service,
 and could not have been effected through natural selection, unless the
 young at the same time were able to partake of the secretion. There is
 no greater difficulty in understanding how young mammals have
 instinctively learnt to suck the breast, than in understanding how
 unhatched chickens have learnt to break the egg-shell by tapping
 against it with their specially adapted beaks; or how a few hours
 after leaving the shell they have learnt to pick up grains of food. In
 such cases the most probable solution seems to be, that the habit
 was at first acquired by practice at a more advanced age, and
 afterwards transmitted to the offspring at an earlier age. But the
 young kangaroo is said not to suck, only to cling to the nipple of its
 mother, who has the power of injecting milk into the mouth of her
 helpless, half-formed offspring. On this head, Mr. Mivart remarks:
 "Did no special provision exist, the young one must infallibly be
 choked by the intrusion of the milk into the windpipe. But there is
 a special provision. The larynx is so elongated that it rises up
 into the posterior end of the nasal passage, and is thus enabled to
 give free entrance to the air for the lungs, while the milk passes
 harmlessly on each side of this elongated larynx, and so safely
 attains the gullet behind it." Mr. Mivart then asks how did natural
 selection remove in the adult kangaroo (and in most other mammals,
 on the assumption that they are descended from a marsupial form),
 "this at least perfectly innocent and harmless structure?" It may be
 suggested in answer that the voice, which is certainly of high
 importance to many animals, could hardly have been used with full
 force as long as the larynx entered the nasal passage; and Professor
 Flower has suggested to me that this structure would have greatly
 interfered with an animal swallowing solid food.
   </p><p>We will now turn for a short space to the lower divisions of the
 animal kingdom. The Echinodermata (star-fishes, sea-urchins, &amp;c.)
 are furnished with remarkable organs, called pedicellariae, which
 consist, when well developed, of a tridactyle forceps- that is, of one
 formed of three serrated arms, neatly fitting together and placed on
 the summit of a flexible stem, moved by muscles. These forceps can
 firmly seize hold of any object; and Alexander Agassiz has seen an
 Echinus or sea-urchin rapidly passing particles of excrement from
 forceps to forceps down certain lines of its body, in order that its
 shell should not be fouled. But there is no doubt that besides
 removing dirt of all kinds, they subserve other functions; and one
 of these apparently is defence.
   </p><p>With respect to these organs, Mr. Mivart, as on so many previous
 occasions, asks: "What would be the utility of the first rudimentary
 beginnings of such structures, and how could such incipient buddings
 have ever preserved the life of a single Echinus?" He adds, "Not
 even the sudden development of the snapping action could have been
 beneficial without the freely moveable stalk, nor could the latter
 have been efficient without the snapping jaws, yet no minute merely
 indefinite variations could simultaneously evolve these complex
 co-ordinations of structure; to deny this seems to do no less than
 to affirm a startling paradox." Paradoxical as this may appear to
 Mr. Mivart, tridactyle forcepses, immovably fixed at the base, but
 capable of a snapping action, certainly exist on some starfishes;
 and this is intelligible if they serve, at least in part, as a means
 of defence. Mr. Agassiz, to whose great kindness I am indebted for
 much information on the subject, informs me that there are other
 star-fishes, in which one of the three arms of the forceps is
 reduced to a support for the other two; and again, other genera in
 which the third arm is completely lost. In Echinoneus, the shell is
 described by M. Perrier as bearing two kinds of pedicellariae, one
 resembling those of Echinus, and the other those of Spatangus; and
 such cases are always interesting as affording the means of apparently
 sudden transitions, through the abortion of one of the two states of
 an organ.
   </p><p>With respect to the steps by which these curious organs have been
 evolved, Mr. Agassiz infers from his own researches and those of
 Muller, that both in star-fishes and sea-urchins the pedicellariae
 must undoubtedly be looked at as modified spines. This may be inferred
 from their manner of development in the individual, as well as from
 a long and perfect series of gradations in different species and
 genera, from simple granules to ordinary spines, to perfect tridactyle
 pedicellariae. The gradations extend even to the manner in which
 ordinary spines and pedicellariae with their supporting calcareous
 rods are articulated to the shell. In certain genera of star-fishes,
 "the very combinations needed to show that the pedicellariae are
 only modified branching spines" may be found. Thus we have fixed
 spines, with three equidistant, serrated, moveable branches,
 articulated to near their bases; and higher up, on the same spine,
 three other moveable branches. Now when the latter arise from the
 summit of a spine they form in fact a rude tridactyle pedicellaria,
 and such may be seen on the same spine together with the three lower
 branches. In this case the identity in nature between the arms of
 the pedicellariae and the moveable branches of a spine, is
 unmistakable. It is generally admitted that the ordinary spines
 serve as a protection; and if so, there can be no reason to doubt that
 those furnished with serrated and moveable branches likewise serve for
 the same purpose; and they would thus serve still more effectively
 as soon as by meeting together they acted as a prehensile or
 snapping apparatus. Thus every gradation, from an ordinary fixed spine
 to a fixed pedicellaria, would be of service.
   </p><p>In certain genera of star-fishes these organs, instead of being
 fixed or borne on an immoveable support, are placed on the summit of a
 flexible and muscular, though short, stem; and in this case they
 probably subserve some additional function besides defence. In the
 sea-urchins the steps can be followed by which a fixed spine becomes
 articulated to the shell, and is thus rendered moveable. I wish I
 had space here to give a fuller abstract of Mr. Agassiz's
 interesting observations on the development of the pedicellariae.
 All possible gradations, as he adds, may likewise be found between the
 pedicellariae of the star-fishes and the hooks of the ophiurians,
 another group of Echinodermata; and again between the pedicellariae of
 sea-urchins and the anchors of the Holothuriae, also belonging to
 the same great class.
 
   </p><p>Certain compound animals, or zoophytes as they have been termed,
 namely the Polyzoa, are provided with curious organs called
 avicularia. These differ much in structure in the different species.
 In their most perfect condition, they curiously resemble the head
 and beak of a vulture in miniature, seated on a neck and capable of
 movement, as is likewise the lower jaw or mandible. In one species
 observed by me all the avicularia on the same branch often moved
 simultaneously backwards and forwards, with the lower jaw widely open,
 through an angle of about 90 degrees, in the course of five seconds;
 and their movement caused the whole polyzoary to tremble. When the
 jaws are touched with a needle they seize it so firmly that the branch
 can thus be shaken.
   </p><p>Mr. Mivart adduces this case, chiefly on account of the supposed
 difficulty of organs, namely the avicularia of the Polyzoa and the
 pedicellariae of the Echinodermata, which he considers as "essentially
 similar," having been developed through natural selection in widely
 distinct divisions of the animal kingdom. But, as far as structure
 is concerned, I can see no similarity between tridactyle pedicellariae
 and avicularia. The latter resemble somewhat more closely the chelae
 or pincers of crustaceans; and Mr. Mivart might have adduced with
 equal appropriateness this resemblance as a special difficulty; or
 even their resemblance to the head and beak of a bird. The
 avicularia are believed by Mr. Busk, Dr. Smitt, and Dr. Nitsche-
 naturalists who have carefully studied this group- to be homologous
 with the zooids and their cells which compose the zoophyte; the
 moveable lip or lid of the cell corresponding with the lower and
 moveable mandible of the avicularium. Mr. Busk, however, does not know
 of any gradations now existing between a zooid and an avicularium.
 It is therefore impossible to conjecture by what serviceable
 gradations the one could have been converted into the other: but it by
 no means follows from this that such gradations have not existed.
   </p><p>As the chelae of crustaceans resemble in some degree the
 avicularia of Polyzoa, both serving as pincers, it may be worth
 while to show that with the former a long series of serviceable
 gradations still exists. In the first and simplest stage, the terminal
 segment of a limb shuts down either on the square summit of the
 broad penultimate segment, or against one whole side; and is thus
 enabled to catch hold of an object; but the limb still serves as an
 organ of locomotion. We next find one corner of the broad
 penultimate segment slightly prominent, sometimes furnished with
 irregular teeth; and against these the terminal segment shuts down. By
 an increase in the size of this projection, with its shape, as well as
 that of the terminal segment, slightly modified and improved, the
 pincers are rendered more and more perfect, until we have at last an
 instrument as efficient as the chelae of a lobster; and all these
 gradations can be actually traced.
   </p><p>Besides the avicularia, the Polyzoa possess curious organs called
 vibracula. These generally consist of long bristles, capable of
 movement and easily excited. In one species examined by me the
 vibracula were slightly curved and serrated along the outer margin;
 and all of them on the same polyzoary often moved simultaneously; so
 that, acting like long oars, they swept a branch rapidly across the
 object-glass of my microscope. When a branch was placed on its face,
 the vibracula became entangled, and they made violent efforts to
 free themselves. They are supposed to serve as a defence, and may be
 seen, as Mr. Busk remarks, "to sweep slowly and carefully over the
 surface of the polyzoary, removing what might be noxious to the
 delicate inhabitants of the cells when their tentacula are protruded."
 The avicularia, like the vibracula, probably serve for defence, but
 they also catch and kill small living animals, which it is believed
 are afterwards swept by the currents within reach of the tentacula
 of the zooids. Some species are provided with avicularia and
 vibracula; some with avicularia alone, and a few with vibracula alone.
   </p><p>It is not easy to imagine two objects more widely different in
 appearance than a bristle or vibraculum, and an avicularium like the
 head of a bird; yet they are almost certainly homologous and have been
 developed from the same common source, namely a zooid with its cell.
 Hence we can understand how it is that these organs graduate in some
 cases, as I am informed by Mr. Busk, into each other. Thus with the
 avicularia of several species of Lepralia, the moveable mandible is so
 much produced and is so like a bristle, that the presence of the upper
 or fixed beak alone serves to determine even its avicularian nature.
 The vibracula may have been directly developed from the lips of the
 cells, without having passed through the avicularian stage; but it
 seems more probable that they have passed through this stage, as
 during the early stages of the transformation, the other parts of
 the cell with the included zooid could hardly have disappeared at
 once. In many cases the vibracula have a grooved support at the
 base, which seems to represent the fixed beak; though this support
 in some species is quite absent. This view of the development of the
 vibracula, if trustworthy, is interesting; for supposing that all
 the species provided with avicularia had become extinct, no one with
 the most vivid imagination would ever have thought that the
 vibracula had originally existed as part of an organ, resembling a
 bird's head or an irregular box or hood. It is interesting to see
 two such widely different organs developed from a common origin; and
 as the moveable lip of the cell serves as a protection to the zooid,
 there is no difficulty in believing that all the gradations, by
 which the lip became converted first into the lower mandible of an
 avicularium and then into an elongated bristle, likewise served as a
 protection in different ways and under different circumstances.
 
   </p><p>In the vegetable kingdom Mr. Mivart only alludes to two cases,
 namely the structure of the flowers of orchids, and the movements of
 climbing plants. With respect to the former, he says, "The explanation
 of their origin is deemed thoroughly unsatisfactory- utterly
 insufficient to explain the incipient, infinitesimal beginnings of
 structures which are of utility only when they are considerably
 developed." As I have fully treated this subject in another work, I
 will here give only a few details on one alone of the most striking
 peculiarities of the flowers of orchids, namely their pollinia. A
 pollinium when highly developed consists of a mass of pollen-grains,
 affixed to an elastic footstalk or caudicle, and this to a little mass
 of extremely viscid matter. The pollinia are by this means transported
 by insects from one flower to the stigma of another. In some orchids
 there is no caudicle to the pollen-masses, and the grains are merely
 tied together by fine threads; but as these are not confined to
 orchids, they need not here be considered; yet I may mention that at
 the base of the orchidaceous series, in Cypripedium, we can see how
 the threads were probably first developed. In other orchids the
 threads cohere at one end of the pollen-masses; and this forms the
 first or nascent trace of a caudicle. That this is the origin of the
 caudicle, even when of considerable length and highly developed, we
 have good evidence in the aborted pollen-grains which can sometimes be
 detected embedded within the central and solid parts.
   </p><p>With respect to the second chief peculiarity, namely the little mass
 of viscid matter attached to the end of the caudicle, a long series of
 gradations can be specified, each of plain service to the plant. In
 most flowers belonging to other orders the stigma secretes a little
 viscid matter. Now in certain orchids similar viscid matter is
 secreted, but in much larger quantities by one alone of the three
 stigmas; and this stigma, perhaps in consequence of the copious
 secretion, is rendered sterile. When an insect visits a flower of this
 kind, it rubs off some of the viscid matter and thus at the same
 time drags away some of the pollen-grains. From this simple condition,
 which differs but little from that of a multitude of common flowers,
 there are endless gradations,- to species in which the pollen-mass
 terminates in a very short, free caudicle,- to others in which the
 caudicle becomes firmly attached to the viscid matter, with the
 sterile stigma itself much modified. In this latter case we have a
 pollinium in its most highly developed and perfect condition. He who
 will carefully examine the flowers of orchids for himself will not
 deny the existence of the above series of gradations- from a mass of
 pollen-grains merely tied together by threads, with the stigma
 differing but little from that of an ordinary flower, to a highly
 complex pollinium, admirably adapted for transportal by insects; nor
 will he deny that all the gradations in the several species are
 admirably adapted in relation to the general structure of each
 flower for its fertilisation by different insects. In this, and in
 almost every other case, the enquiry may be pushed further
 backwards; and it may be asked how did the stigma of an ordinary
 flower become viscid, but as we do not know the full history of any
 one group of beings, it is as useless to ask, as it is hopeless to
 attempt answering, such questions.
   </p><p>We will now turn to climbing plants. These can be arranged in a long
 series, from those which simply twine round a support, to those
 which I have called leaf-climbers, and to those provided with
 tendrils. In these two latter classes the stems have generally, but
 not always, lost the power of twining, though they retain the power of
 revolving, which the tendrils likewise possess. The gradations from
 leaf-climbers to tendril-bearers are wonderfully close, and certain
 plants may be indifferently placed in either class. But in ascending
 the series from simple twiners to leaf-climbers, an important
 quality is added, namely sensitiveness to a touch, by which means
 the foot-stalks of the leaves or flowers, or these modified and
 converted into tendrils, are excited to bend round and clasp the
 touching object. He who will read my memoir on these plants will, I
 think, admit that all the many gradations in function and structure
 between simple twiners and tendril-bearers are in each case beneficial
 in a high degree to the species. For instance, it is clearly a great
 advantage to a twining plant to become a leaf-climber; and it is
 probable that every twiner which possessed leaves with long
 foot-stalks would have been developed into a leaf-climber if the
 footstalks had possessed in any slight degree the requisite
 sensitiveness to a touch.
   </p><p>As twining is the simplest means of ascending a support, and forms
 the basis of our series, it may naturally be asked how did plants
 acquire this power in an incipient degree, afterwards to be improved
 and increased through natural selection. The power of twining depends,
 firstly, on the stems whilst young being extremely flexible (but
 this is a character common to many plants which are not climbers);
 and, secondly, on their continually bending to all points of the
 compass, one after the other in succession, in the same order. By this
 movement the stems are inclined to all sides, and are made to move
 round and round. As soon as the lower part of a stem strikes against
 any object and is stopped, the upper part still goes on bending and
 revolving, and thus necessarily twines round and up the support. The
 revolving movement ceases after the early growth of each shoot. As
 in many widely separated families of plants, single species and single
 genera possess the power of revolving, and have thus become twiners,
 they must have independently acquired it, and cannot have inherited it
 from a common progenitor. Hence I was led to predict that some
 slight tendency to a movement of this kind would be found to be far
 from uncommon with plants which did not climb; and that this had
 afforded the basis for natural selection to work on and improve.
 When I made this prediction, I knew of only one imperfect case,
 namely, of the young flower-peduncles of a Maurandia which revolved
 slightly and irregularly, like the stems of twining plants, but
 without making any use of this habit. Soon afterwards Fritz Muller
 discovered that the young stems of an Alisima and of a Linum,-
 plants which do not climb and are widely separated in the natural
 system,- revolved plainly, though irregularly; and he states that he
 has reason to suspect that this occurs with some other plants. These
 slight movements appear to be of no service to the plants in question;
 anyhow, they are not of the least use in the way of climbing, which is
 the point that concerns us. Nevertheless we can see that if the
 stems of these plants had been flexible, and if under the conditions
 to which they are exposed it had profited them to ascend to a
 height, then the habit of slightly and irregularly revolving might
 have been increased and utilised through natural selection, until they
 had become converted into well-developed twining species.
   </p><p>With respect to the sensitiveness of the footstalks of the leaves
 and flowers, and of tendrils, nearly the same remarks are applicable
 as in the case of the revolving movements of twining plants. As a vast
 number of species, belonging to widely distinct groups, are endowed
 with this kind of sensitiveness, it ought to be found in a nascent
 condition in many plants which have not become climbers. This is the
 case: I observed that the young flower-peduncles of the above
 Maurandia curved themselves a little toward the side which was
 touched. Morren found in several species of Oxalis that the leaves and
 their foot-stalks moved, especially after exposure to a hot sun,
 when they were gently and repeatedly touched, or when the plant was
 shaken. I repeated these observations on some other species of
 Oxalis with the same result; in some of them the movement was
 distinct, but was best seen in the young leaves; in others it was
 extremely slight. It is a more important fact that according to the
 high authority of Hofmeister, the young shoots and leaves of all
 plants move after being shaken; and with climbing plants it is, as
 we know, only during the early stages of growth that the foot-stalks
 and tendrils are sensitive.
   </p><p>It is scarcely possible that the above slight movements, due to a
 touch or shake, in the young and growing organs of plants, can be of
 any functional importance to them. But plants possess, in obedience to
 various stimuli, powers of movement, which are of manifest
 importance to them; for instance, towards and more rarely from the
 light,- in opposition to, and more rarely in the direction of, the
 attraction of gravity. When the nerves and muscles of an animal are
 excited by galvanism or by the absorption of strychnine, the
 consequent movements may be called an incidental result, for the
 nerves and muscles have not been rendered specially sensitive to these
 stimuli. So with plants it appears that, from having the power of
 movement in obedience to certain stimuli, they are excited in an
 incidental manner by a touch, or by being shaken. Hence there is no
 great difficulty in admitting that in the case of leaf-climbers and
 tendril-bearers, it is this tendency which has been taken advantage of
 and increased through natural selection. It is, however, probable,
 from reasons which I have assigned in my memoir, that this will have
 occurred only with plants which had already acquired the power of
 revolving, and had thus become twiners.
   </p><p>I have already endeavoured to explain how plants became twiners,
 namely, by the increase of a tendency to slight and irregular
 revolving movements, which were at first of no use to them; this
 movement, as well as that due to a touch or shake, being the
 incidental result of the power of moving, gained for other and
 beneficial purposes. Whether, during the gradual development of
 climbing plants, natural selection has been aided by the inherited
 effects of use, I will not pretend to decide; but we know that certain
 periodical movements, for instance the so-called sleep of plants,
 are governed by habit.
 
   </p><p>I have now considered enough, perhaps more than enough, of the
 cases, selected with care by a skilful naturalist, to prove that
 natural selection is incompetent to account for the incipient stages
 of useful structures; and I have shown, as I hope, that there is no
 great difficulty on this head. A good opportunity has thus been
 afforded for enlarging a little on gradations of structure, often
 associated with changed functions,- an important subject which was not
 treated at sufficient length in the former editions of this work. I
 will now briefly recapitulate the foregoing cases.
   </p><p>With the giraffe, the continued preservation of the individuals of
 some extinct high-reaching ruminant, which had the longest necks,
 legs, &amp;c., and could browse a little above the average height, and the
 continued destruction of those which could not browse so high, would
 have sufficed for the production of this remarkable quadruped; but the
 prolonged use of all the parts together with inheritance will have
 aided in an important manner in their co-ordination. With the many
 insects which imitate various objects, there is no improbability in
 the belief that an accidental resemblance to some common object was in
 each case the foundation for the work of natural selection, since
 perfected through the occasional preservation of slight variations
 which ma de the resemblance at all closer; and this will have been
 carried on as long as the insect continued to vary, and as long as a
 more and more perfect resemblance led to its escape from sharp-sighted
 enemies. In certain species of whales there is a tendency to the
 formation of irregular little points of horn on the palate; and it
 seems to be quite within the scope of natural selection to preserve
 all favourable variations, until the points were converted first
 into lamellated knobs or teeth, like those on the beak of a goose,-
 then into short lamellae, like those of the domestic ducks,- and
 then into lamellae, as perfect as those of the shoveller-duck,- and
 finally into the gigantic plates of baleen, as in the mouth of the
 Greenland whale. In the family of the ducks, the lamellae are first
 used as teeth, then partly as teeth, and partly as a sifting
 apparatus, and at last almost exclusively for this latter purpose.
   </p><p>With such structures as the above lamellae of horn or whalebone,
 habit or use can have done little or nothing, as far as we can
 judge, towards their development. On the other hand, the transportal
 of the lower eye of a flat-fish to the upper side of the head, and the
 formation of a prehensile tail, may be attributed almost wholly to
 continued use, together with inheritance. With respect to the mammae
 of the higher animals, the most probable conjecture is that
 primordially the cutaneous glands over the whole surface of a
 marsupial sack secreted a nutritious fluid; and that these glands were
 improved in function through natural selection, and concentrated
 into a confined area, in which case they would have formed a mamma.
 There is no more difficulty in understanding how the branched spines
 of some ancient echinoderm, which served as a defence, became
 developed through natural selection into tridactyle pedicellariae,
 than in understanding the development of the pincers of crustaceans,
 through slight, serviceable modifications in the ultimate and
 penultimate segments of a limb, which was at first used solely for
 locomotion. In the avicularia and vibracula of the Polyzoa we have
 organs widely different in appearance developed from the same
 source; and with the vibracula we can understand how the successive
 gradations might have been of service. With the pollinia of orchids,
 the threads which originally served to tie together the pollen-grains,
 can be traced cohering into caudicles; and the steps can likewise be
 followed by which viscid matter, such as that secreted by the
 stigmas of ordinary flowers, and still subserving nearly but not quite
 the same purpose, became attached to the free ends of the
 caudicles;- all these gradations being of modest benefit to the plants
 in question. With respect to climbing plants, I need not repeat what
 has been so lately said.
   </p><p>It has often been asked, if natural selection be so potent, why
 has not this or that structure been gained by certain species, to
 which it would apparently have been advantageous? But it is
 unreasonable to expect a precise answer to such questions, considering
 our ignorance of the past history of each species, and of the
 conditions which at the present day determine its numbers and range.
 In most cases only general reasons, but in some few cases special
 reasons, can be assigned. Thus to adapt a species to new habits of
 life, many co-ordinated modifications are almost indispensable, and it
 may often have happened that the requisite parts did not vary in the
 right manner or to the right degree. Many species must have been
 prevented from increasing in numbers through destructive agencies,
 which stood in no relation to certain structures, which we imagine
 would have been gained through natural selection from appearing to
 us advantageous to the species. In this case, as the struggle for life
 did not depend on such structures, they could not have been acquired
 through natural selection. In many cases complex and long-enduring
 conditions, often of a peculiar nature, are necessary for the
 development of a structure; and the requisite conditions may seldom
 have concurred. The belief that any given structure, which we think,
 often erroneously, would have been beneficial to a species, would have
 been gained under all circumstances through natural selection, is
 opposed to what we can understand of its manner of action. Mr.
 Mivart does not deny that natural selection has effected something;
 but he considers it as "demonstrably insufficient" to account for
 the phenomena which I explain by its agency. His chief arguments
 have now been considered, and the others will hereafter be considered.
 They seem to me to partake little of the character of demonstration,
 and to have little weight in comparison with those in favour of the
 power of natural selection, aided by the other agencies often
 specified. I am bound to add, that some of the facts and arguments
 here used by me, have been advanced for the same purpose in an able
 article lately published in the Medico-Chirurgical Review.
   </p><p>At the present day almost all naturalists admit evolution under some
 form. Mr. Mivart believes that species change through "an internal
 force or tendency," about which it is not pretended that anything is
 known. That species have a capacity for change will be admitted by all
 evolutionists; but there is no need, as it seems to me, to invoke
 any internal force beyond the tendency to ordinary variability,
 which through the aid of selection by man has given rise to many
 well-adapted domestic races, and which through the aid of natural
 selection would equally well give rise by graduated steps to natural
 races or species. The final result will generally have been, as
 already explained, an advance, but in some few cases a
 retrogression, in organisation.
   </p><p>Mr. Mivart is further inclined to believe, and some naturalists
 agree with him, that new species manifest themselves "with
 suddenness and by modifications appearing at once." For instance, he
 supposes that the differences between the extinct three-toed Hipparion
 and the horse arose suddenly. He thinks it difficult to believe that
 the wing of a bird "was developed in any other way than by a
 comparatively sudden modification of a marked and important kind"; and
 apparently he would extend the same view to the wings of bats and
 pterodactyles. This conclusion, which implies great breaks or
 discontinuity in the series, appears to me improbable in the highest
 degree.
   </p><p>Every one who believes in slow and gradual evolution, will of course
 admit that specific changes may have been as abrupt and as great as
 any single variation which we meet with under nature, or even under
 domestication. But as species are more variable when domesticated or
 cultivated than under their natural conditions, it is not probable
 that such great and abrupt variations have often occurred under
 nature, as are known occasionally to arise under domestication. Of
 these latter variations several may be attributed to reversion; and
 the characters which thus reappear were, it is probable, in many cases
 at first gained in a gradual manner. A still greater number must be
 called monstrosities, such as six-fingered men, porcupine men, Ancon
 sheep, Niata cattle, &amp;c.; and as they are widely different in
 character from natural species, they throw very little light on our
 subject. Excluding such cases of abrupt variations, the few which
 remain would at best constitute, if found in a state of nature,
 doubtful species, closely related to their parental types.
   </p><p>My reasons for doubting whether natural species have changed as
 abruptly as have occasionally domestic races, and for entirely
 disbelieving that they have changed in the wonderful manner
 indicated by Mr. Mivart, are as follows. According to our
 experience, abrupt and strongly marked variations occur in our
 domesticated productions, singly and at rather long intervals of time.
 If such occurred under nature, they would be liable, as formerly
 explained, to be lost by accidental causes of destruction and by
 subsequent inter-crossing; and so it is known to be under
 domestication, unless abrupt variations of this kind are specially
 preserved and separated by the care of man. Hence in order that a
 new species should suddenly appear in the manner supposed by Mr.
 Mivart, it is almost necessary to believe, in opposition to all
 analogy, that several wonderfully changed individuals appeared
 simultaneously within the same district. This difficulty, as in the
 case of unconscious selection by man, is avoided on the theory of
 gradual evolution, through the preservation of a large number of
 individuals, which varied more or less in any favourable direction,
 and of the destruction of a large number which varied in an opposite
 manner.
   </p><p>That many species have been evolved in an extremely gradual
 manner, there can hardly be a doubt. The species and even the genera
 of many large natural families are so closely allied together, that it
 is difficult to distinguish not a few of them. On every continent in
 proceeding from north to south, from lowland to upland, &amp;c., we meet
 with a host of closely related or representative species; as we
 likewise do on certain distinct continents, which we have reason to
 believe were formerly connected. But in making these and the following
 remarks, I am compelled to allude to subjects hereafter to be
 discussed. Look at the many outlying islands round a continent, and
 see how many of their inhabitants can be raised only to the rank of
 doubtful species. So it is if we look to past times, and compare the
 species which have just passed away with those still living within the
 same areas; or if we compare the fossil species embedded in the
 sub-stages of the same geological formation. It is indeed manifest
 that multitudes of species are related in the closest manner to
 other species that still exist, or have lately existed; and it will
 hardly be maintained that such species have been developed in an
 abrupt or sudden manner. Nor should it be forgotten, when we look to
 the special parts of allied species, instead of to distinct species,
 that numerous and wonderfully fine gradations can be traced,
 connecting together widely different structures.
   </p><p>Many large groups of facts are intelligible only on the principle
 that species have been evolved by very small steps: for instance,
 the fact that the species included in the larger genera are more
 closely related to each other, and present a greater number of
 varieties than do the species in the smaller genera. The former are
 also grouped in little clusters, like varieties round species, and
 they present other analogies with varieties, as was shown in our
 second chapter. On this same principle we can understand how it is
 that specific characters are more variable than generic characters;
 and how the parts which are developed in an extraordinary degree or
 manner are more variable than other parts of the same species. Many
 analogous facts, all pointing in the same direction, could be added.
   </p><p>Although very many species have almost certainly been produced by
 steps not greater than those separating fine varieties; yet it may
 be maintained that some have been developed in a different and
 abrupt manner. Such an admission, however, ought not to be made
 without strong evidence being assigned. The vague and in some respects
 false analogies, as they have been shown to be by Mr. Chauncey Wright,
 which have been advanced in favour of this view, such as the sudden
 crystallisation of inorganic substances, or the falling of a
 facetted spheroid from one facet to another, hardly deserve
 consideration. One class of facts, however, namely, the sudden
 appearance of new and distinct forms of life in our geological
 formations, supports at first sight the belief in abrupt
 development. But the value of this evidence depends entirely on the
 perfection of the geological record, in relation to periods remote
 in the history of the world. If the record is as fragmentary as many
 geologists strenuously assert, there is nothing strange in new forms
 appearing as if suddenly developed.
   </p><p>Unless we admit transformations as prodigious as those advocated
 by Mr. Mivart, such as the sudden development of the wings of birds or
 bats, or the sudden conversion of a Hipparion into a horse, hardly any
 light is thrown by the belief in abrupt modifications on the
 deficiency of connecting links in our geological formations. But
 against the belief in such abrupt changes, embryology enters a
 strong protest. It is notorious that the wings of birds and bats,
 and the legs of horses or other quadrupeds, are undistinguishable at
 an early embryonic period, and that they become differentiated by
 insensibly fine steps. Embryological resemblances of all kinds can
 be accounted for, as we shall hereafter see, by the progenitors of our
 existing species having varied after early youth, and having
 transmitted their newly acquired characters to their offspring, at a
 corresponding age. The embryo is thus left almost unaffected, and
 serves as a record of the past condition of the species. Hence it is
 that existing species during the early stages of their development
 so often resemble ancient and extinct forms belonging to the same
 class. On this view of the meaning of embryological resemblances,
 and indeed on any view, it is incredible that an animal should have
 undergone such momentous and abrupt transformations, as those above
 indicated; and yet should not bear even a trace in its embryonic
 condition of any sudden modification; every detail in its structure
 being developed by insensibly fine steps.
   </p><p>He who believes that some ancient form was transformed suddenly
 through an internal force or tendency into, for instance, one
 furnished with wings, will be almost compelled to assume, in
 opposition to all analogy, that many individuals varied
 simultaneously. It cannot be denied that such abrupt and great changes
 of structure are widely different from those which most species
 apparently have undergone. He will further be compelled to believe
 that many structures beautifully adapted to all the other parts of the
 same creature and to the surrounding conditions, have been suddenly
 produced; and of such complex and wonderful co-adaptations, he will
 not be able to assign a shadow of an explanation. He will be forced to
 admit that these great and sudden transformations have left no trace
 of their action on the embryo. To admit all this is, as it seems to
 me, to enter into the realms of miracle, and to leave those of
 Science.
