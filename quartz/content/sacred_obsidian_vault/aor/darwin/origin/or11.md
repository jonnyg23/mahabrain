 <h3>Chapter XI: On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings</h3>
 
  <p>LET us now see whether the several facts and laws relating to the
 geological succession of organic beings accord best with the common
 view of the immutability of species, or with that of their slow and
 gradual modification, through variation and natural selection.
   </p><p>New species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both on
 the land and in the waters. Lyell has shown that it is hardly possible
 to resist the evidence on this head in the case of the several
 tertiary stages; and every year tends to fill up the blanks between
 the stages, and to make the proportion between the lost and existing
 forms more gradual. In some of the most recent beds, though
 undoubtedly of high antiquity if measured by years, only one or two
 species are extinct, and only one or two are new, having appeared
 there for the first time, either locally, or, as far as we know, on
 the face of the earth. The secondary formations are more broken;
 but, as Bronn has remarked, neither the appearance nor disappearance
 of the many species embedded in each formation has been simultaneous.
   </p><p>Species belonging to different genera and classes have not changed
 at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the older tertiary beds
 a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude
 of extinct forms. Falconer has given a striking instance of a
 similar fact, for an existing crocodile is associated with many lost
 mammals and reptiles in the sub-Himalayan deposits. The Silurian
 Lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus;
 whereas most of the other Silurian molluscs and all the crustaceans
 have changed greatly. The productions of the land seem to have changed
 at a quicker rate than those of the sea, of which a striking
 instance has been observed in Switzerland. There is some reason to
 believe that organisms high in the scale, change more quickly than
 those that are low: though there are exceptions to this rule. The
 amount of organic change, as Pictet has remarked, is not the same in
 each successive so-called formation. Yet if we compare any but the
 most closely related formations, all the species will be found to have
 undergone some change. When a species has once disappeared from the
 lace of the earth, we have no reason to believe that the same
 identical form ever reappears. The strongest apparent exception to
 this latter rule is that of the so-called "colonies" of M. Barrande,
 which intrude for a period in the midst of an older formation, and
 then allow the pre-existing fauna to reappear; but Lyell's
 explanation, namely, that it is a case of temporary migration from a
 distinct geographical province, seems satisfactory.
   </p><p>These several facts accord well with our theory, which includes no
 fixed law of development, causing all the inhabitants of an area to
 change abruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree. The process
 of modification must be slow, and will generally affect only a few
 species at the same time; for the variability of each species is
 independent of that of all others. Whether such variations or
 individual differences as may arise will be accumulated through
 natural selection in a greater or less degree, thus causing a
 greater or less amount of permanent modification, will depend on
 many complex contingencies- on the variations being of a beneficial
 nature, on the freedom of intercrossing, on the slowly changing
 physical conditions of the country, on the immigration of new
 colonists, and on the nature of the other inhabitants with which the
 varying species come into competition. Hence it is by no means
 surprising that one species should retain the same identical form much
 longer than others; or, if changing, should change in a less degree.
 We find similar relations between the existing inhabitants of distinct
 countries; for instance, the land-shells and coleopterous insects of
 Madeira have come to differ considerably from their nearest allies
 on the continent of Europe, whereas the marine shells and birds have
 remained unaltered. We can perhaps understand the apparently quicker
 rate of change in terrestrial and in more highly organised productions
 compared with marine and lower productions, by the more complex
 relations of the higher beings to their organic and inorganic
 conditions of life, as explained in a former chapter. When many of the
 inhabitants of any area have become modified and improved, we can
 understand, on the principle of competition, and from the
 all-important relations of organism to organism in the struggle for
 life, that any form which did not become in some degree modified and
 improved, would be liable to extermination. Hence we see why all the
 species in the same region do at last, if we look to long enough
 intervals of time, become modified, for otherwise they would become
 extinct.
   </p><p>In members of the same class the average amount of change, during
 long and equal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the same;
 but as the accumulation of enduring formations, rich in fossils,
 depends on great masses of sediment being deposited on subsiding
 areas, our formations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide
 and irregularly intermittent intervals of time; consequently the
 amount of organic change exhibited by the fossils embedded in
 consecutive formations is not equal. Each formation, on this view,
 does not mark a new and complete act of creation, but only an
 occasional scene, taken almost at hazard, in an ever slowly changing
 drama.
   </p><p>We can clearly understand why a species when once lost should
 never reappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic
 and inorganic, should recur. For though the offspring of one species
 might be adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable
 instances) to fill the place of another species in the economy of
 nature, and thus supplant it; yet the two forms- the old and the
 new- would not be identically the same; for both would almost
 certainly inherit different characters from their distinct
 progenitors; and organisms already differing would vary in a different
 manner. For instance, it is possible, if all our fantail pigeons
 were destroyed, that fanciers might make a new breed hardly
 distinguishable from the present breed; but if the parent
 rock-pigeon were likewise destroyed, and under nature we have every
 reason to believe that parent-forms are generally supplanted and
 exterminated by their improved off spring, it is incredible that a
 fantail, identical with the existing breed, could be raised from any
 other species of pigeon, or even from any other well-established
 race of the domestic pigeon, for the successive variations would
 almost certainly be in some degree different, and the newly-formed
 variety would probably inherit from its progenitor some characteristic
 differences.
   </p><p>Groups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same
 general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single
 species, changing more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser
 degree. A group, when it has once disappeared, never reappears; that
 is, its existence, as long as it lasts, is continuous. I am aware that
 there are some apparent exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions
 are surprisingly few, so few that E. Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward
 (though all strongly opposed to such views as I maintain) admit its
 truth; and the rule strictly accords with the theory. For all the
 species of the same group, however long it may have lasted, are the
 modified descendants one from the other, and all from a common
 progenitor. In the genus Lingula, for instance, the species which have
 successively appeared at all ages must have been connected by an
 unbroken series of generations, from the lowest Silurian stratum to
 the present day.
   </p><p>We have seen in the last chapter that whole groups of species
 sometimes falsely appear to have been abruptly developed; and I have
 attempted to give an explanation of this fact, which if true would
 be fatal to my views. But such cases are certainly exceptional; the
 general rule being a gradual increase in number, until the group
 reaches its maximum, and then, sooner or later, a gradual decrease. If
 the number of the species included within a genus, or the number of
 the genera within a family, be represented by a vertical line of
 varying thickness, ascending through the successive geological
 formations, in which the species are found, the line will sometimes
 falsely appear to begin at its lower end, not in a sharp point, but
 abruptly; it then gradually thickens upwards, often keeping of equal
 thickness for a space, and ultimately thins out in the upper beds,
 marking the decrease and final extinction of the species. This gradual
 increase in number of the species of a group is strictly conformable
 with the theory, for the species of the same genus, and the genera
 of the same family, can increase only slowly and progressively; the
 process of modification and the production of a number of allied forms
 necessarily being a slow and gradual process,- one species first
 giving rise to two or three varieties, these being slowly converted
 into species, which in their turn produce by equally slow steps
 other varieties and species, and so on, like the branching of a
 great tree from a single stem, till the group becomes large.
 
 </p><h4>On Extinction</h4>
 
   <p>We have as yet only spoken incidentally of the disappearance of
 species and of groups of species. On the theory of natural
 selection, the extinction of old forms and the production of new and
 improved forms are intimately connected together. The old notion of
 all the inhabitants of the earth having been swept away by
 catastrophes at successive periods is very generally given up, even by
 those geologists, as Elie de Beaumont, Murchison, Barrande, &amp;c., whose
 general views would naturally lead them to this conclusion. On the
 contrary, we have every reason to believe, from the study of the
 tertiary formations, that species and groups of species gradually
 disappear, one after another, first from one spot, then from
 another, and finally from the world. In some few cases however, as
 by the breaking of an isthmus and the consequent irruption of a
 multitude of new inhabitants into an adjoining sea, or by the final
 subsidence of an island, the process of extinction may have been
 rapid. Both single species and whole groups of species last for very
 unequal periods; some groups, as we have seen, have endured from the
 earliest known dawn of life to the present day; some have
 disappeared before the close of the palaeozoic period. No fixed law
 seems to determine the length of time during which any single
 species or any single genus endures. There is reason to believe that
 the extinction of a whole group of species is generally a slower
 process than their production: if their appearance and disappearance
 be represented, as before, by a vertical line of varying thickness the
 line is found to taper more gradually at its upper end, which marks
 the progress of extermination, than at its lower end, which marks
 the first appearance and the early increase in number of the
 species. In some cases, however, the extermination of whole groups, as
 of ammonites, towards the close of the secondary period, has been
 wonderfully sudden.
   </p><p>The extinction of species has been involved in the most gratuitous
 mystery. Some authors have even supposed that, as the individual has a
 definite length of life, so have species a definite duration. No one
 can have marvelled more than I have done at the extinction of species.
 When I found in La Plata the tooth of a horse embedded with the
 remains of Mastodon, Megatherium, Toxodon, and other extinct monsters,
 which all co-existed with still living shells at a very late
 geological period, I was filled with astonishment; for, seeing that
 the horse, since its introduction by the Spaniards into South America,
 has run wild over the whole country and has increased in numbers at an
 unparalleled rate, I asked myself what could so recently have
 exterminated the former horse under conditions of life apparently so
 favourable. But my astonishment was groundless. Professor Owen soon
 perceived that the tooth, though so like that of the existing horse,
 belonged to an extinct species. Had this horse been still living,
 but in some degree rare, no naturalist would have felt the least
 surprise at its rarity; for rarity is the attribute of a vast number
 of species of all classes, in all countries. If we ask ourselves why
 this or that species is rare, we answer that something is unfavourable
 in its conditions of life; but what that something is we can hardly
 ever tell. On the supposition of the fossil horse still existing as
 a rare species, we might have felt certain, from the analogy of all
 other mammals, even of the slow-breeding elephant, and from the
 history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in South
 America, that under more favourable conditions it would in a very
 few years have stocked the whole continent. But we could not have told
 what the unfavourable conditions were which checked its increase,
 whether some one or several contingencies, and at what period of the
 horse's life, and in what degree they severally acted. If the
 conditions had gone on, however slowly, becoming less and less
 favourable, we assuredly should not have perceived the fact, yet the
 fossil horse would certainly have become rarer and rarer, and
 finally extinct;- its place being seized on by some more successful
 competitor.
   </p><p>It is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every
 creature is constantly being checked by unperceived hostile
 agencies; and that these same unperceived agencies are amply
 sufficient to cause rarity, and finally extinction. So little is
 this subject understood, that I have heard surprise repeatedly
 expressed at such great monsters as the Mastodon and the more
 ancient dinosaurians having become extinct; as if mere bodily strength
 gave victory in the battle of life. Mere size, on the contrary,
 would in some cases determine, as has been remarked by Owen, quicker
 extermination from the greater amount of requisite food. Before man
 inhabited India or Africa, some cause must have checked the
 continued increase of the existing elephant. A highly capable judge,
 Dr. Falconer, believes that it is chiefly insects which, from
 incessantly harassing and weakening the elephant in India, check its
 increase; and this was Bruce's conclusion with respect to the
 African elephant in Abyssinia. It is certain that insects and
 bloodsucking bats determine the existence of the larger naturalized
 quadrupeds in several parts of S. America.
   </p><p>We see in many cases in the more recent tertiary formations, that
 rarity precedes extinction; and we know that this has been the
 progress of events with those animals which have been exterminated,
 either locally or wholly, through man's agency. I may repeat what I
 published in 1845, namely, that to admit that species generally become
 rare before they become extinct- to feel no surprise at the rarity
 of a species, and yet to marvel greatly when the species ceases to
 exist, is much the same as to admit that sickness in the individual is
 the forerunner of death- to feel no surprise at sickness, but, when
 the sick man dies, to wonder and to suspect that he died by some
 deed of violence.
   </p><p>The theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that
 each new variety and ultimately each new species, is produced and
 maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes
 into competition; and the consequent extinction of the less-favoured
 forms almost inevitably follows. It is the same with our domestic
 productions; when a new and slightly improved variety has been raised,
 it at first supplants the less improved varieties in the same
 neighbourhood; when much improved it is transported far and near, like
 our short-horn cattle, and takes the place of other breeds in other
 countries. Thus the appearance of new forms and the disappearance of
 old forms, both those naturally and those artificially produced, are
 bound together. In flourishing groups, the number of new specific
 forms which have been produced within a given time has at some periods
 probably been greater than the number of the old specific forms
 which have been exterminated; but we know that species have not gone
 on indefinitely increasing, at least during the later geological
 epochs, so that, looking to later times, we may believe that the
 production of new forms has caused the extinction of about the same
 number of old forms.
   </p><p>The competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained
 and illustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like
 each other in all respects. Hence the improved and modified
 descendants of a species will generally cause the extermination of the
 parent-species; and if many new forms have been developed from any one
 species, the nearest allies of that species, i.e. the species of the
 same genus, will be the most liable to extermination. Thus, as I
 believe, a number of new species descended from one species, that is a
 new genus, comes to supplant an old genus, belonging to the same
 family. But it must often have happened that a new species belonging
 to some one group has seized on the place occupied by a species
 belonging to a distinct group, and thus have caused its extermination.
 If many allied forms be developed from the successful intruder, many
 will have to yield their places; and it will generally be the allied
 forms, which will suffer from some inherited inferiority in common.
 But whether it be species belonging to the same or to a distinct
 class, which have yielded their places to other modified and
 improved species, a few of the sufferers may often be preserved for
 a long time, from being fitted to some peculiar line of life, or
 from inhabiting some distant and isolated station, where they will
 have escaped severe competition. For instance, some species of
 Trigonia, a great genus of shells in the secondary formations, survive
 in the Australian seas; and a few members of the great and almost
 extinct group of ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters.
 Therefore the utter extinction of a group is generally, as we have
 seen, a slower process than its production.
   </p><p>With respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole
 families or orders, as of trilobites at the close of the palaeozoic
 period and of ammonites at the close of the secondary period, we
 must remember what has been already said on the probable wide
 intervals of time between our consecutive formations; and in these
 intervals there may have been much slow extermination. Moreover, when,
 by sudden immigration or by unusually rapid development, many
 species of a new group have taken possession of an area, many of the
 older species will have been exterminated in a correspondingly rapid
 manner; and the forms which thus yield their places will commonly be
 allied, for they will partake of the same inferiority in common.
   </p><p>Thus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and
 whole groups of species become extinct accords well with the theory of
 natural selection. We need not marvel at extinction; if we must
 marvel, let it be at our own presumption in imagining for a moment
 that we understand the many complex contingencies on which the
 existence of each species depends. If we forget for an instant that
 each species tends to increase inordinately, and that some check is
 always in action, yet seldom perceived by us, the whole economy of
 nature will be utterly obscured. Whenever we can precisely say why
 this species is more abundant in individuals than that; why this
 species and not another can be naturalised in a given country; then,
 and not until then, we may justly feel surprise why we cannot
 account for the extinction of any particular species or group of
 species.
 
 </p><h4>On the Forms of Life changing almost simultaneously throughout the
 World</h4>
 
   <p>Scarcely any palaeontological discovery is more striking than the
 fact that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout
 the world. Thus our European Chalk formation can be recognised in many
 distant regions, under the most different climates, where not a
 fragment of the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely in North
 America, in equatorial South America, in Tierra del Fuego, at the Cape
 of Good Hope, and in the peninsula of India. For at these distant
 points, the organic remains in certain beds present an unmistakable
 resemblance to those of the Chalk. It is not that the same species are
 met with; for in some cases not one species is identically the same,
 but they belong to the same families, genera, and sections of
 genera, and sometimes are similarly characterised in such trifling
 points as mere superficial sculpture. Moreover, other forms, which are
 not found in the Chalk of Europe, but which occur in the formations
 either above or below, occur in the same order at these distant points
 of the world. In the several successive palaeozoic formations of
 Russia, Western Europe, and North America, a similar parallelism in
 the forms of life has been observed by several authors; so it is,
 according to Lyell, with the European and North American tertiary
 deposits. Even if the few fossil species which are common to the Old
 and New Worlds were kept wholly out of view, the general parallelism
 in the successive forms of life, in the palaeozoic and tertiary
 stages, would still be manifest, and the several formations could be
 easily correlated.
   </p><p>These observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of the
 world: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the productions of
 the land and of fresh water at distant points change in the same
 parallel manner. We may doubt whether they have thus changed: if the
 Megatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon had been brought to
 Europe from La Plata, without any information in regard to their
 geological position, no one would have suspected that they had
 co-existed with seashells all still living; but as these anomalous
 monsters co-existed with the mastodon and horse, it might at least
 have been inferred that they had lived during one of the later
 tertiary stages.
   </p><p>When the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed
 simultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this
 expression relates to the same year, or to the same century, or even
 that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the marine
 animals now living in Europe, and all those that lived in Europe
 during the pleistocene period (a very remote period as measured by
 years, including the whole glacial epoch) were compared with those now
 existing in South America or in Australia, the most skilful naturalist
 would hardly be able to say whether the present or the pleistocene
 inhabitants of Europe resembled most closely those of the southern
 hemisphere. So, again, several highly competent observers maintain
 that the existing productions of the United States are more closely
 related to those which lived in Europe during certain late tertiary
 stages, than to the present inhabitants of Europe; and if this be
 so, it is evident that fossiliferous beds now deposited on the
 shores of North America would hereafter be liable to be classed with
 somewhat older European beds. Nevertheless, looking to a remotely
 future epoch, there can be little doubt that all the more modern
 marine formations, namely, the upper pliocene, the pleistocene and
 strictly modern beds of Europe, North and South America, and
 Australia, from containing fossil remains in some degree allied, and
 from not including those forms which are found only in the older
 underlying deposits, would be correctly ranked as simultaneous in a
 geological sense.
   </p><p>The fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously, in the
 above large sense, at distant parts of the world, has greatly struck
 these admirable observers, MM. de Verneuil and d'Archiae. After
 referring to the parallelism of the palaeozoic forms of life in
 various parts of Europe, they add, "If, struck by this strange
 sequence, we turn our attention to North America, and there discover a
 series of analogous phenomena, it will appear certain that all these
 modifications of species, their extinction, and the introduction of
 new ones, cannot be owing to mere changes in marine currents or
 other causes more or less local and temporary, but depend on general
 laws which govern the whole animal kingdom." M. Barrande has made
 forcible remarks to precisely the same effect. It is, indeed, quite
 futile to look to changes of currents, climate, or other physical
 conditions, as the cause of these great mutations in the forms of life
 throughout the world, under the most different climates. We must, as
 Barrande has remarked, look to some special law. We shall see this
 more clearly when we treat of the present distribution of organic
 beings, and find how slight is the relation between the physical
 conditions of various countries and the nature of their inhabitants.
   </p><p>This great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life
 throughout the world, is explicable on the theory of natural
 selection. New species are formed by having some advantage over
 older forms; and the forms, which are already dominant, or have some
 advantage over the other forms in their own country, give birth to the
 greatest number of new varieties or incipient species. We have
 distinct evidence on this head, in the plants which are dominant, that
 is, which are commonest and most widely diffused, producing the
 greatest number of new varieties. It is also natural that the
 dominant, varying, and far-spreading species, which have already
 invaded to a certain extent the territories of other species, should
 be those which would have the best chance of spreading still
 further, and of giving rise in new countries to other new varieties
 and species. The process of diffusion would often be very slow,
 depending on climatal and geographical changes, on strange
 accidents, and on the gradual acclimatisation of new species to the
 various climates through which they might have to pass, but in the
 course of time the dominant forms would generally succeed in spreading
 and would ultimately prevail. The diffusion would, it is probable,
 be slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than
 with the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea. We might
 therefore expect to find, as we do find, a less strict degree of
 parallelism in the succession of the productions of the land than with
 those of the sea.
   </p><p>Thus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large
 sense, simultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout
 the world, accords well with the principle of new species having
 been formed by dominant species spreading widely and varying; the
 new species thus produced being themselves dominant, owing to their
 having had some advantage over their already dominant parents, as well
 as over other species, and again spreading, varying, and producing new
 forms. The old forms which are beaten and which yield their places
 to the new and victorious forms, will generally be allied in groups,
 from inheriting some inferiority in common; and therefore, as new
 and improved groups spread throughout the world, old groups
 disappear from the world; and the succession of forms everywhere tends
 to correspond both in their first appearance and final disappearance.
   </p><p>There is one other remark connected with this subject worth
 making. I have given my reasons for believing that most of our great
 formations, rich in fossils, were deposited during periods of
 subsidence; and that blank intervals of vast duration, as far as
 fossils are concerned, occurred during the periods when the bed of the
 sea was either stationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was
 not thrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic
 remains. During these long and blank intervals I suppose that the
 inhabitants of each region underwent a considerable amount of
 modification and extinction, and that there was much migration from
 other parts of the world. As we have reason to believe that large
 areas are affected by the same movement, it is probable that
 strictly contemporaneous formations have often been accumulated over
 very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world; but we are very far
 from having any right to conclude that this has invariably been the
 case, and that large areas have invariably been affected by the same
 movements. When two formations have been deposited in two regions
 during nearly, but not exactly, the same period, we should find in
 both, from the causes explained in the foregoing paragraphs, the
 same general succession in the forms of life; but the species would
 not exactly correspond; for there will have been a little more time in
 the one region than in the other for modification, extinction, and
 immigration.
   </p><p>I suspect that cases of this nature occur in Europe. Mr.
 Prestwich, in his admirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of
 England and France, is able to draw a close general parallelism
 between the successive stages in the two countries; but when he
 compares certain stages in England with those in France, although he
 finds in both a curious accordance in the numbers of the species
 belonging to the same genera, yet the species themselves differ in a
 very, difficult to account for, considering the proximity of the two
 areas,- unless, indeed, it be assumed that an isthmus separated two
 seas inhabited by distinct, but contemporaneous, faunas. Lyell has
 made similar observations on some of the later tertiary formations.
 Barrande, also, shows that there is a striking general parallelism
 in the successive Silurian deposits of Bohemia and Scandinavia;
 nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of difference in the
 species. If the several formations in these regions have not been
 deposited during the same exact periods,- a formation in one region
 often corresponding with a blank interval in the other,- and if in
 both regions the species have gone on slowly changing during the
 accumulation of the several formations and during the long intervals
 of time between them; in this case the several formations in the two
 regions could be arranged in the same order, in accordance with the
 general succession of the forms of life, and the order would falsely
 appear to be strictly parallel; nevertheless the species would not
 be all the same in the apparently corresponding stages in the two
 regions.
 
 </p><h4>On the Affinities of Extinct Species to each other, and to Living Forms</h4>
 
   <p>Let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living
 species. All fall into a few grand classes; and this fact is once
 explained on the principle of descent. The more ancient any form is,
 the more, as a general rule, it differs from living forms. But, as
 Buckland long ago remarked, extinct species can all be classed
 either in still existing groups, or between them. That the extinct
 forms of life help to fill up the intervals between existing genera,
 families, and orders, is certainly true; but as this statement has
 often been ignored or even denied, it may be well to make some remarks
 on this subject, and to give some instances. If we confine our
 attention either to the living or to the extinct species of the same
 class, the series is far less perfect than if we combine both into one
 general system. In the writings of Professor Owen we continually
 meet with the expression of generalised forms, as applied to extinct
 animals; and in the writings of Agassiz, of prophetic or synthetic
 types; and these terms imply that such forms are in fact
 intermediate or connecting links. Another distinguished
 palaeontologist, M. Gaudry, has shown in the most striking manner that
 many of the fossil mammals discovered by him in Attica serve to
 break down the intervals between existing genera. Cuvier ranked the
 ruminants and pachyderms as two of the most distinct orders of
 mammals: but so many fossil links have been disentombed that Owen
 has had to alter the whole classification, and has placed certain
 pachyderms in the same sub-order with ruminants; for example, he
 dissolves by gradations the apparently wide interval between the pig
 and the camel. The Ungulata or hoofed quadrupeds are now divided
 into the even-toed or odd-toed divisions; but the Maerauchenia of S.
 America connects to a certain extent these two grand divisions. No one
 will deny that the Hipparion is intermediate between the existing
 horse and certain older ungulate forms. What a wonderful connecting
 link in the chain of mammals is the Typotherium from S. America, as
 the name given to it by Professor Gervais expresses, and which
 cannot be placed in any existing order. The Sirenia form a very
 distinct group of mammals, and one of the most remarkable
 peculiarities in the existing dugong and lamentin is the entire
 absence of hind limbs without even a rudiment being left; but the
 extinct Halitherium had, according to Professor Flower, an ossified
 thighbone "articulated to a well-defined acetabulum in the pelvis,"
 and it thus makes some approach to ordinary hoofed quadrupeds, to
 which the Sirenia are in other respects allied. The cetaceans or
 whales are widely different from all other mammals but the tertiary
 Zeuglodon and Squalodon, which have been placed by some naturalists in
 an order by themselves, are considered by Professor Huxley to be
 undoubtedly cetaceans, "and to constitute connecting links with the
 aquatic carnivora."
   </p><p>Even the wide interval between birds and reptiles has been shown
 by the naturalist just quoted to be partially bridged over in the most
 unexpected manner, on the one hand, by the ostrich and extinct
 Archeopteryx, and on the other hand, by the Compsognathus, one of
 the dinosaurians- that group which includes the most gigantic of all
 terrestrial reptiles. Turning to the Invertebrata, Barrande asserts, a
 higher authority could not be named, that he is every day taught that,
 although palaeozoic can certainly be classed under existing groups,
 yet that at this ancient period the groups were not so distinctly
 separated from each other as they now are.
   </p><p>Some writers have objected to any extinct species, or group of
 species, being considered as intermediate between any two living
 species, or groups of species. If by this term it is meant that an
 extinct form is directly intermediate in all its characters between
 two living forms or groups, the objection is probably valid. But in
 a natural classification many fossil species certainly stand between
 living species, and some extinct genera between living genera, even
 between genera belonging to distinct families. The most common case,
 especially with respect to very distinct groups, such as fish and
 reptiles, seems to be, that, supposing them to be distinguished at the
 present day by a score of characters, the ancient members are
 separated by a somewhat lesser number of characters; so that the two
 groups formerly made a somewhat nearer approach to each other than
 they now do.
   </p><p>It is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so much
 the more it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now
 widely separated from each other. This remark no doubt must be
 restricted to those groups which have undergone much change in the
 course of geological ages; and it would be difficult to prove the
 truth of the proposition, for every now and then even a living animal,
 as the Lepidosiren, is discovered having affinities directed towards
 very distinct groups. Yet if we compare the older reptiles and
 batrachians, the older fish, the older cephalopods, and the eocene
 mammals, with the more recent members of the same classes, we must
 admit that there is truth in the remark.
   </p><p>Let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with
 the theory of descent with modification. As the subject is somewhat
 complex, I must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the
 fourth chapter. We may suppose that the numbered letters in italics
 represent genera, and the lines diverging from them the species in
 each genus. The diagram is much too simple, too few genera and too few
 species being given, but this is unimportant for us. The horizontal
 lines may represent successive geological formations, and all the
 forms beneath the uppermost line may be considered as extinct. The
 three existing genera a14, q14, p14, will form a small family; b14,
 and f14 a closely allied family or sub-family; and o14, e14, m14, a
 third family. These three families, together with the many extinct
 genera on the several lines of descent diverging from the
 parent-form (A) will form an order, for all will have inherited
 something in common from their ancient progenitor. On the principle of
 the continued tendency to divergence of character, which was
 formerly illustrated by this diagram, the more recent any form is, the
 more it will generally differ from its ancient progenitor. Hence we
 can understand the rule that the most ancient fossils differ most from
 existing forms. We must not, however, assume that divergence of
 character is a necessary contingency; it depends solely on the
 descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize on many and
 different places in the economy of nature. Therefore it is quite
 possible, as we have seen in the case of some Silurian forms, that a
 species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its
 slightly altered conditions of life, and yet retain throughout a vast
 period the same general characteristics. This is represented in the
 diagram by the letter F14.
   </p><p>All the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from (A), make, as
 before remarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects
 of extinction and divergence of character, has become divided into
 several sub-families and families, some of which are supposed to
 have perished at different periods, and some to have endured to the
 present day.
   </p><p>By looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct
 forms supposed to be imbedded in the successive formations, were
 discovered at several points low down in the series, the three
 existing families on the uppermost line would be rendered less
 distinct from each other. If, for instance, the genera a1, a5, a10,
 f8, m3, m6, m9, were disinterred, these three families would be so
 closely linked together that they probably would have to be united
 into one great family, in nearly the same manner as has occurred
 with ruminants and certain pachyderms. Yet he who objected to consider
 as intermediate the extinct genera, which thus link together the
 living genera of three families, would be partly justified, for they
 are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long and circuitous
 course through many widely different forms. If many extinct forms were
 to be discovered above one of the middle horizontal lines or
 geological formations- for instance, above No. VI.- but none from
 beneath this line, then only two of the families (those on the left
 hand, a14, &amp;c., and b14, &amp;c.) would have to be united into one; and
 there would remain two families, which would be less distinct from
 each other than they were before the discovery of the fossils. So
 again if the three families formed of eight genera (a14 to m14), on
 the uppermost line, be supposed to differ from each other by
 half-a-dozen important characters, then the families which existed
 at the period marked VI. would certainly have differed from each other
 by a less number of characters; for they would at this early stage
 of descent have diverged in a less degree from their common
 progeneitor. Thus it comes that ancient and extinct genera are often
 in a greater or less degree intermediate in character between their
 modified descendants, or between their collateral relations.
   </p><p>Under nature the process will be far more complicated than
 represented in the diagram; for the groups will have been more
 numerous; they will have endured for extremely unequal lengths of
 time, and will have been modified in various degrees. As we possess
 only the last volume of the geological record, and that in a very
 broken condition, we have no right to expect, except in rare cases, to
 fill up the wide intervals in the natural system, and thus to unite
 distinct families or orders. All that we have a right to expect is,
 that those groups which have, within known geological periods,
 undergone much modification, should in the older formations make some
 slight approach to each other; so that the older members should differ
 less from each other in some of their characters than do the existing
 members of the same groups; and this by the concurrent evidence of our
 best palaeontologists is frequently the case.
   </p><p>Thus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts
 with respect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life
 to each other and to living forms, are explained in a satisfactory
 manner. And they are wholly inexplicable on any other view.
   </p><p>On this same theory, it is evident that the fauna during any one
 great period in the earth's history will be intermediate in general
 character between that which preceded and that which succeeded it.
 Thus the species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in
 the diagram are the modified offspring of those which lived at the
 sixth stage of descent, and are the parents of those which became
 still more modified at the seventh stage; hence they could hardly fail
 to be nearly intermediate in character between the forms of life above
 and below. We must, however, allow for the entire extinction of some
 preceding forms, and in any one region for the immigration of new
 forms from other regions, and for a large amount of modification
 during the long and blank intervals between the successive formations.
 Subject to these allowances, the fauna of each geological period
 undoubtedly is intermediate in character, between the preceding and
 succeeding faunas. I need give only one instance, namely, the manner
 in which the fossils of the Devonian system, when this system was
 first discovered, were at once recognized by palaeontologists as
 intermediate in character between those of the overlying
 carboniferous, and underlying Silurian systems. But each fauna is
 not necessarily exactly intermediate, as unequal intervals of time
 have elapsed between consecutive formations.
   </p><p>It is no real objection to the truth of the statement that the fauna
 of each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character
 between preceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer
 exceptions to the rule. For instance, the species of mastodons and
 elephants, when arranged by Dr. Falconer in two series,- the first
 place according to their mutual affinities, and in the second place
 according to their periods of existence,- do not accord in
 arrangement. The species extreme in character are not the oldest or
 the most recent; nor are those which are intermediate in character,
 intermediate in age. But supposing for an instant, in this and other
 such cases, that the record of the first appearance and
 disappearance of the species was complete, which is far from the case,
 we have no reason to believe that forms successively produced
 necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of time. A very ancient
 form may occasionally have lasted much longer than a form elsewhere
 subsequently produced, especially in the case of terrestrial
 productions inhabiting separated districts. To compare small things
 with great; if the principal living and extinct races of the
 domestic pigeon were arranged in serial affinity, this arrangement
 would not closely accord with the order in time of their production,
 and even less with the order of their disappearance; for the parent
 rock-pigeon still lives; and many varieties between the rock-pigeon
 and the carrier have become extinct; and carriers which are extreme in
 the important character of length of beak originated earlier than
 short-beaked tumblers, which are at the opposite end of the series
 in this respect.
   </p><p>Closely connected with the statement, that the organic remains
 from an intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in
 character, is the fact, insisted on by all palaeontologists, that
 fossils from two consecutive formations are far more closely related
 to each other, than are the fossils from two remote formations. Pictet
 gives as a well-known instance, the general resemblance of the organic
 remains from the several stages of the Chalk formation, though the
 species are distinct in each stage. This fact alone, from its
 generality, seems to have shaken Professor Pictet in his belief in the
 immutability of species. He who is acquainted with the distribution of
 existing species over the globe, will not attempt to account for the
 close resemblance of distinct species in closely consecutive
 formations, by the physical conditions of the ancient areas having
 remained nearly the same. Let it be remembered that the forms of life,
 at least those inhabiting the sea, have changed almost
 simultaneously throughout the world, and therefore under the most
 different climates and conditions. Consider the prodigious
 vicissitudes of climate during the pleistocene period, which
 includes the whole glacial epoch, and note how little the specific
 forms of the inhabitants of the sea have been affected.
   </p><p>On the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fossil remains
 from closely consecutive formations being closely related, though
 ranked as distinct species, is obvious. As the accumulation of each
 formation has often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have
 intervened between successive formations, we ought not to expect to
 find, as I attempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or in any
 two formations, all the intermediate varieties between the species
 which appeared at the commencement and close of these periods: but
 we ought to find after intervals, very long as measured by years,
 but only moderately long as measured geologically, closely allied
 forms, or, as they have been called by some authors, representative
 species; and these assuredly we do find. We find, in short, such
 evidence of the slow and scarcely sensible mutations of specific
 forms, as we have the right to expect.
 
 </p><h4>On the State of Development of Ancient compared with Living Forms</h4>
 
   <p>We have seen in the fourth chapter that the degree of
 differentiation and specialisation of the parts in organic beings,
 when arrived at maturity, is the best standard, as yet suggested, of
 their degree of perfection or highness. We have also seen that, as the
 specialisation of parts is an advantage to each being, so natural
 selection will tend to render the organisation of each being more
 specialised and perfect, and in this sense higher; not but that it may
 leave many creatures with simple and unimproved structures fitted
 for simple conditions of life, and in some cases will even degrade
 or simplify the organisation, yet leaving such degraded beings
 better fitted for their new walks of life. In another and more general
 manner, new species become superior to their predecessors; for they
 have to beat in the struggle for life all the older forms, with
 which they come into close competition. We may therefore conclude that
 if under a nearly similar climate the eocene inhabitants of the
 world could be put into competition with the existing inhabitants, the
 former would be beaten and exterminated by the latter, as would the
 secondary by the eocene, and the palaeozoic by the secondary forms. So
 that by this fundamental test of victory in the battle for life, as
 well as by the standard of the specialisation of organs, modern
 forms ought, on the theory of natural selection, to stand higher
 than ancient forms. Is this the case? A large majority of
 palaeontologists would answer in the affirmative; and it seems that
 this answer must be admitted as true, though difficult of proof.
   </p><p>It is no valid objection to this conclusion, that certain
 brachiopods have been but slightly modified from an extremely remote
 geological epoch; and that certain land and fresh-water shells have
 remained nearly the same, from the time when, as far as is known, they
 first appeared. It is not an insuperable difficulty that
 Foraminifera have not, as insisted on by Dr. Carpenter, progressed
 in organisation since even the Laurentian epoch; for some organisms
 would have to remain fitted for simple conditions of life, and what
 could be better fitted for this end than these lowly organised
 Protozoa? Such objections as the above would be fatal to my view, if
 it included advance in organisation as a necessary contingent. They
 would likewise be fatal, if the above Foraminifera, for instance,
 could be proved to have first come into existence during the
 Laurentian epoch, or the above brachiopods during the Cambrian
 formation; for in this case, there would not have been time sufficient
 for the development of these organisms up to the standard which they
 had then reached. When advanced up to any given point, there is no
 necessity, on the theory of natural selection, for their further
 continued progress; though they will, during each successive age, have
 to be slightly modified, so as to hold their places in relation to
 slight changes in their conditions. The foregoing objections hinge
 on the question whether we really know how old the world is, and at
 what period the various forms of life first appeared; and this may
 well be disputed.
   </p><p>The problem whether organisation on the whole has advanced is in
 many ways excessively intricate. The geological record, at all times
 imperfect, does not extend far enough back to show with unmistakable
 clearness that within the known history of the world organisation
 has largely advanced. Even at the present day, looking to members of
 the same class, naturalists are not unanimous which forms ought to
 be ranked as highest: thus, some look at the selaceans or sharks, from
 their approach in some important points of structure to reptiles, as
 the highest fish; others look at the teleosteans as the highest. The
 ganoids stand intermediate between the selaceans and teleosteans;
 the latter at the present day are largely preponderant in number;
 but formerly selaceans and ganoids alone existed; and in this case,
 according to the standard of highness chosen, so will it be said
 that fishes have advanced or retrograded in organisation. To attempt
 to compare members of distinct types in the scale of highness seem
 hopeless; who will decide whether a cuttle-fish be higher than a
 bee- that insect which the great von Baer believed to be "in fact more
 highly organised than a fish, although upon another type"? In the
 complex struggle for life it is quite credible that crustaceans, not
 very high in their own class, might beat cephalopods, the highest
 molluscs; and such crustaceans, though not highly developed, would
 stand very high in the scale of invertebrate animals, if judged by the
 most decisive of all trials- the law of battle. Besides these inherent
 difficulties in deciding which forms are the most advanced in
 organisation, we ought not solely to compare the highest members of
 a class at any two periods- though undoubtedly this is one and perhaps
 the most important element in striking a balance- but we ought to
 compare all the members, high and low, at the two periods. At an
 ancient epoch the highest and lowest molluscoidal animals, namely,
 cephalopods and brachiopods, swarmed in numbers; at the present time
 both groups are greatly reduced, whilst others, intermediate in
 organisation, have largely increased; consequently some naturalists
 maintain that molluscs were formerly more highly developed than at
 present; but a stronger case can be made out on the opposite side,
 by considering the vast reduction of brachiopods, and the fact that
 our existing cephalopods, though few in number, are more highly
 organised than their ancient representatives. We ought also to compare
 the relative proportional numbers at any two periods of the high and
 low classes throughout the world: if, for instance, at the present day
 fifty thousand kinds of vertebrate animals exist, and if we knew
 that at some former period only ten thousand kinds existed, we ought
 to look at this increase in number in the highest class, which implies
 a great displacement of lower forms, as a decided advance in the
 organisation of the world. We thus see how hopelessly difficult it
 is to compare with perfect fairness such extremely complex
 relations, the standards of organisation of the imperfectly-known
 faunas of successive periods.
   </p><p>We shall appreciate this difficulty more clearly, by looking to
 certain existing faunas and floras. From the extraordinary manner in
 which European productions have recently spread over New Zealand,
 and have seized on places which must have been previously occupied
 by the indigenes, we must believe, that if all the animals and
 plants of Great Britain were set free in New Zealand, a multitude of
 British forms would in the course of time become thoroughly
 naturalised there, and would exterminate many of the natives. On the
 other hand, from the fact that hardly a single inhabitant of the
 southern hemisphere has become wild in any part of Europe, we may well
 doubt whether, if all the productions of New Zealand were set free
 in Great Britain, any considerable number would be enabled to seize on
 places now occupied by our native plants and animals. Under this point
 of view, the productions of Great Britain stand much higher in the
 scale than those of New Zealand. Yet the most skilful naturalist, from
 an examination Of the species of the species of the two countries,
 could not have foreseen this result.
   </p><p>Agassiz and several other highly competent judges insist that
 ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent
 animals belonging to the same classes; and that the geological
 succession of extinct forms is nearly parallel with the
 embryological development of existing forms. This view accords
 admirably well with our theory. In a future chapter I shall attempt to
 show that the adult differs from its embryo, owing to variations
 having supervened at a not early age, and having been inherited at a
 corresponding age. This process, whilst it leaves the embryo almost
 unaltered, continually adds, in the course of successive
 generations, more and more difference to the adult. Thus the embryo
 comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of the
 former and less modified condition of the species. This view may be
 true, and yet may never be capable of proof. Seeing, for instance,
 that the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fishes strictly belong to
 their proper classes, though some of these old forms are in a slight
 degree less distinct from each other than are the typical members of
 the same groups at the present day, it would be vain to look for
 animals having the common embryological character of the Vertebrata,
 until beds rich in fossils are discovered far beneath the lowest
 Cambrian strata- a discovery of which the chance is small.
 
 </p><h4>On the Succession of the same Types within the same Areas, during
 the later Tertiary periods</h4>
 
   <p>Mr. Clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the
 Australian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of
 that continent. In South America a similar relationship is manifest,
 even to an uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour, like
 those of the armadillo, found in several parts of La Plata; and
 Professor Owen has shown in the most striking manner that most of
 the fossil mammals, buried there in such numbers, are related to
 South American types. This relationship is even more clearly seen in
 the wonderful collection of fossil bones made by MM. Lund and
 Clausen in the caves of Brazil. I was so much impressed with these
 facts that I strongly insisted, in 1839 and 1845, on this "law of
 the succession of types,"- on "this wonderful relationship in the same
 continent between the dead and the living." Professor Owen has
 subsequently extended the same generalisation to the mammals of the
 Old World. We see the same law in this author's restorations of the
 extinct and gigantic birds of New Zealand. We see it also in the birds
 of the caves of Brazil. Mr. Woodward has shown that the same law holds
 good with sea-shells, but, from the wide distribution of most
 molluscs, it is not well displayed by them. Other cases could be
 added, as the relation between the extinct and living land-shells of
 Madeira; and between the extinct and living brackish watershells of
 the Aralo-Caspian Sea.
   </p><p>Now what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same
 types within the same areas mean? He would be a bold man who, after
 comparing the present climate of Australia and of parts of South
 America, under the same latitude, would attempt to account, on the one
 hand through dissimilar physical conditions, for the dissimilarity
 of the inhabitants of these two continents; and, on the other hand
 through similarity of conditions, for the uniformity of the same types
 in each continent during the later tertiary periods. Nor can it be
 pretended that it is an immutable law that marsupials should have been
 chiefly or solely produced in Australia; or that Edentata and other
 American types should have been solely produced in South America.
 For we know that Europe in ancient times was peopled by numerous
 marsupials; and I have shown in the publications above alluded to,
 that in America the law of distribution of terrestrial mammals was
 formerly different from what it now is. North America formerly
 partook strongly of the present character of the southern half of
 the continent; and the southern half was formerly more closely allied,
 than it is at present, to the northern half. In a similar manner we
 know, from Falconer and Cautley's discoveries, that Northern India was
 formerly more closely related in its mammals to Africa than it is at
 the present time. Analogous facts could be given in relation to the
 distribution of marine animals.
   </p><p>On the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the
 long enduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types
 within the same areas, is at once explained; for the inhabitants of
 each quarter of the world will obviously tend to leave in that
 quarter, during the next succeeding period of time, closely allied
 though in some degree modified descendants. If the inhabitants of
 one continent formerly differed greatly from those of another
 continent, so will their modified descendants still differ in nearly
 the same manner and degree. But after very long intervals of time, and
 after great geographical changes, permitting much intermigration,
 the feebler will yield to the more dominant forms, and there will be
 nothing immutable in the distribution of organic beings.
   </p><p>It may be asked in ridicule, whether I suppose that the
 Megatherium and other allied huge monsters, which formerly lived in
 South America, have left behind them the sloth, armadillo, and
 anteater, as their degenerate descendants. This cannot for an
 instant be admitted. These huge animals have become wholly extinct,
 and have left no progeny. But in the caves of Brazil, there are many
 extinct species which are closely allied in size and in all other
 characters to the species still living in South America; and some of
 these fossils may have been the actual progenitors of the living
 species. It must not be forgotten that, on our theory, all the species
 of the same genus are the descendants of some one species; so that, if
 six genera, each having eight species, be found in one geological
 formation, and in a succeeding formation there be six other allied
 or representative genera each with the same number of species, then we
 may conclude that generally only one species of each of the older
 genera has left modified descendants, which constitute the new
 genera containing the several species; the other seven species of each
 old genus having died out and left no progeny. Or, and this will be
 a far commoner case, two or three species in two or three alone of the
 six older genera will be the parents of the new genera: the other
 species and the other old genera having become utterly extinct. In
 failing orders, with the genera and species decreasing in numbers as
 is the case with the Edentata of South America, still fewer genera and
 species will leave modified blood-descendants.
 
 </p><h4>Summary of the preceding and present Chapters</h4>
 
   <p>I have attempted to show that the geological record is extremely
 imperfect; that only a small portion of the globe has been
 geologically explored with care; that only certain classes of
 organic beings have been largely preserved in a fossil state; that the
 number both of specimens and of species, preserved in our museums,
 is absolutely as nothing compared with the number of generations which
 must have passed away even during a single formation; that, owing to
 subsidence being almost necessary for the accumulation of deposits
 rich in fossil species of many kinds, and thick enough to outlast
 future degradation, great intervals of time must have elapsed
 between most of our successive formations; that there has probably
 been more extinction during the periods of subsidence, and more
 variation during the periods of elevation, and during the latter the
 record will have been less perfectly kept; that each single
 formation has not been continuously deposited; that the duration of
 each formation is probably short compared with the average duration of
 specific forms; that migration has played an important part in the
 first appearance of new forms in any one area and formation; that
 widely ranging species are those which have varied most frequently,
 and have oftenest given rise to new species; that varieties have at
 first been local; and lastly, although each species must have passed
 through numerous transitional stages, it is probable that the periods,
 during which each underwent modification, though many and long as
 measured by years, have been short in comparison with the periods
 during which each remained in an unchanged condition. These causes,
 taken conjointly, will to a large extent explain why- though we do
 find many links- we do not find interminable varieties, connecting
 together all extinct and existing forms by the finest graduated steps.
 It should also be constantly borne in mind that any linking variety
 between two forms, which might be found, would be ranked, unless the
 whole chain could be perfectly restored, as a new and distinct
 species; for it is not pretended that we have any sure criterion by
 which species and varieties can be discriminated.
   </p><p>He who rejects this view of the imperfection of the geological
 record, will rightly reject the whole theory. For he may ask in vain
 where are the numberless transitional links which must formerly have
 connected the closely allied or representative species, found in the
 successive stages of the same great formation? He may disbelieve in
 the immense intervals of time which must have elapsed between our
 consecutive formations; he may overlook how important a part migration
 has played, when the formations of any one great region, as those of
 Europe, are considered; he may urge the apparent, but often falsely
 apparent, sudden coming in of whole groups of species. He may ask
 where are the remains of those infinitely numerous organisms which
 must have existed long before the Cambrian system was deposited? We
 now know that at least one animal did then exist; but I can answer
 this last, question only by supposing that where our oceans now extend
 they have extended for an enormous period, and where our oscillating
 continents now stand they have stood since the commencement of the
 Cambrian system; but that, long before that epoch, the world presented
 a widely different aspect; and that the older continents formed of
 formations older than any known to us, exist now only as remnants in a
 metamorphosed condition, or lie still buried under the ocean.
   </p><p>Passing from these difficulties, the other great leading facts in
 palaeontology agree admirably with the theory of descent with
 modification through variation and natural selection. We can thus
 understand how it is that new species come in slowly and successively;
 how species of different classes do not necessarily change together,
 or at the same rate, or in the same degree; yet in the long run that
 all undergo modification to some extent. The extinction of old forms
 is the almost inevitable consequence of the productions of new
 forms. We can understand why, when a species has once disappeared,
 it never reappears. Groups of species increase in numbers slowly,
 and endure for unequal periods of time; for the process of
 modification is necessarily slow, and depends on many complex
 contingencies. The dominant species belonging to large and dominant
 groups tend to leave many modified descendants, which form new
 sub-groups and groups. As these are formed, the species of the less
 vigorous groups, from their inferiority inherited from a common
 progenitor, tend to become extinct together, and to leave no
 modified offspring on the face of the earth. But the utter
 extinction of a whole group of species has sometimes been a slow
 process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in
 protected and isolated situations. When a group has once wholly
 disappeared, it does not reappear; for the link of generation has
 been broken.
   </p><p>We can understand how it is that dominant forms which spread
 widely and yield the greatest number of varieties tend to people the
 world with allied, but modified, descendants; and these will generally
 succeed in displacing the groups which are their inferiors in the
 struggle for existence. Hence, after long intervals of time, the
 productions of the world appear to have changed simultaneously.
   </p><p>We can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient
 and recent, make together a few grand classes. We can understand, from
 the continued tendency to divergence of character, why the more
 ancient a form is, the more it generally differs from those now
 living; why ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps
 between existing forms, sometimes blending two groups, previously
 classed as distinct, into one; but more commonly bringing them only
 a little closer together. The more ancient a form is, the more often
 it stands in some degree intermediate between groups now distinct; for
 the more ancient a form is, the more nearly it will be related to, and
 consequently resemble, the common progenitor of groups, since become
 widely divergent. Extinct forms are seldom directly intermediate
 between existing forms; but are intermediate only by a long and
 circuitous course through other extinct and different forms. We can
 clearly see why the organic remains of closely consecutive
 formations are closely allied; for they are closely linked together by
 generation. We can clearly see why the remains of an intermediate
 formation are intermediate in character.
   </p><p>The inhabitants of the world at each successive period in its
 history have beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and
 are, in so far, higher in the scale, and their structure has generally
 become more specialised; and this may account for the common belief
 held by so many palaeontologists, that organisation on the whole has
 progressed. Extinct and ancient animals resemble to a certain extent
 the embryos of the more recent animals belonging to the same
 classes, and this wonderful fact receives a simple explanation
 according to our views. The succession of the same types of
 structure within the same areas during the later geological periods
 ceases to be mysterious, and is intelligible on the principle of
 inheritance.
   </p><p>If then the geological record be as imperfect as many believe, and
 it may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be
 much more perfect, the main objections to the theory of natural
 selection are greatly diminished or disappear. On the other hand, an
 the chief laws of palaeontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me,
 that species have been produced by ordinary generation: old forms
 having been supplanted by new and improved forms of life, the products
 of Variation and the Survival of the Fittest.
