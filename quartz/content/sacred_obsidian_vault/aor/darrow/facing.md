      (Report of a lecture delivered at the University of Chicago,
 under the auspices of the Poetry Club, and the Liberal Club;
 revised by Mr. Darrow.)</p><p>
 
      I had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of Mr. A.E.
 Housman in the Summer of 1927. I spent two hours with him, and
 before that I had been to the home of Thomas Hardy. Mr. Hardy told
 me how much he thought of Housman, before I visited Housman; and
 Housman was a frequent visitor at the Hardy home. Their ideas of
 life were very much alike; they were what the orthodox people and
 the Rotary Clubs would call pessimistic. They didn't live on pipe
 dreams; they took the universe as they found it, and man as they
 found him. They tried to see what beauty there was in each of them,
 but didn't close their eyes to the misery and maladjustments of
 either the universe or man, because they ware realists, honest,
 thorough, and fearless.</p><p>
 
      Hardy himself had received the censure of all the good people
 of England and the world, who, in spite of that, bought his books.
 They all condemned him when he wrote his 'Tess;' so he determined
 not to write any more prose. He thought that people probably were
 not intelligent enough to appreciate him; certainly not his
 viewpoint, and he didn't wish to waste his time on them.</p><p>
 
      Housman's viewpoint is much the same, as all of you know. He
 has written very little. You can read all he has written in two
 hours, and less than that; but everything is exquisitely finished.
 met him he was in his study in Cambridge. He is a professor of
 Latin. I can't Imagine anythINg more useless than that -- unless it
 be Greek! He has been called the greatest Latin scholar in the
 world, and he seemed to take some pride in his Latin; not so much
 in his poetry. He said he didn't write poetry except when he felt
 he had to, it was always hard work for him, although some of the
 things he wrote very quickly; but as a rule he spent a great deal
 of time on most of them.</p><p>
 
      I asked him if it was true that the latest little volume was
 what it is entitled -- 'Last Poems.' He said he thought it was
 true; that it had been published as his last poems in 1922 -- five
 years before -- and he had only written four lines since: so he
 thought that would probably be the last. Upon my asking him to
 recite the four lines, he said he had forgotten them.</p><p>
 
      Both Hardy and Housman, and of course Omar, believed that man
 is rather small in comparison with the universe, or even with the
 earth; they didn't believe in human responsibility, in free will,
 in a purposeful universe, in a Being who watched over and cared for
 the people of the world. It is evident that if He does, He makes a
 poor job of It!</p><p>
 
      Neither Hardy nor Housman had any such delusions. They took
 the world as they found it and never tried to guess at its origin.
 They took man as they found him and didn't try to build castles for
 him after be was dead. They were essentially realists, both of
 them; and of course long before them Omar had gone over the same
 field.</p><p>
 
      It is hardly fair to call the Rubaiyat the work of Omar
 Khayyam. I have read a good many different editions and several
 different versions. I never read it in Persian, in which it was
 first written, but I have read not only poetical versions but prose
 ones. Justin McCarthy brought out a translation a number of years
 ago which was supposed to be a literal translation of Omar's book.
 There is no resemblance between that book and the classic under his
 name that was really written by FitzGerald. There is nothing very
 remarkable about the Omar Khayyam as found in Justin McCarthy's
 translation. It is probably ten times as expansive as the one we
 have, and no one would recognize it from the FitzGerald edition.</p><p>
 
      The beauty of the Rubaiyat is Edward FitzGerald's. He
 evidently was more or less modest or else he wanted to do great
 homage to Omar, because no one would ever have suspected that Omar
 had any more to do with the book than they would have suspected
 Plato. But, under the magic touch of FitzGerald, it is not only one
 of the wisest and most profound pieces of literature in the world,
 but one of the most beautiful productions that the world has ever
 known.</p><p>
 
      I remember reading somewhere that when this poem was thrown on
 the market in London, a long time ago, nobody bought it. They
 finally put it out in front of the shop in the form in which it was
 printed and sold it for a penny. One could make more money by
 buying those books at a penny and selling them now than he could
 make with a large block of Standard Oil! It took a long while for
 Omar and FitzGerald to gain recognition, which makes it rather
 comfortable for the rest of us who write books to give away, and
 feel happy when somebody asks us for one, although we suspect they
 will never read them. But we all think we will be discovered
 sometime. Some of us hope so and some are fearful that they will
 be. Neither Omar nor FitzGerald believed in human responsibility.
 That is the rock on which most religions are founded, and all laws
 -- that everybody is responsible for his conduct; that if he is
 good he is good because he deliberately chooses to be good, and if 
 he is bad it is pure cussedness on his part -- nobody had anything
 to do with it excepting himself. If he hasn't free will, why, he
 isn't anything! The English poet Henley, in one of his poems,
 probably expressed this about as well as anybody. It looks to me as
 if he had a case of the rabies or something like that. But people
 are fond of repeating it. In his brief poem about Fate he says:</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      I am the master of my fate<br>
      I am the captain of my soul.<p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      A fine captain of his soul; and a fine master of his fate! He
 wasn't master enough of his fate to get himself born, which is
 rather important, nor to do much of anything else, except brag
 about it. Instead of being the captain of his soul, as I have
 sometimes expressed it, man isn't even a deck-hand on a rudderless
 ship! He is just floating around and trying to hang on, and hanging
 on as long as he can. But if it does him any good to repeat Henley,
 or other nonsense, it is all right to give him a chance to do it,
 because he hasn't much to look forward to, any way. Free will never
 was a scientific doctrine; it never can be. It is probably a
 religious conception, which of course shows that it isn't a
 scientific one.</p><p>
 
      Neither one of these eminent men, Hardy or Housman, believed
 anything in free will. There is eight hundred years between Omar
 and Housman, and yet their, philosophy is wondrously alike. I have
 no doubt but that Omar's philosophy was very like what we find in
 the rendering of FitzGerald. It is not a strange and unusual
 philosophy, except in churches and Rotary Clubs and places like
 that. It is not strange in places where people think or try to, and
 where they do not undertake to fool themselves. It is rather a
 common philosophy; it is a common philosophy where people have any
 realization of their own importance, or, rather, unimportance. A
 realization of it almost invariably forces upon a human being his
 own insignificance and the insignificance of all the other human
 atoms that come and go.</p><p>
 
      Men's ideas root pretty far back. Their religious creeds are
 very old. By means of interest and hope and largely fear, they
 manage to hang on to the old, even when they know it is not true.
 The idea of man's importance came in the early history of the human
 race. He looked out on the earth, and of course he thought it was
 flat! It looks flat, and he thought it was. He saw the sun, and he
 formed the conception that somebody moved it out every morning and
 pulled it back in at night. He saw the moon, and he had the opinion
 that somebody pulled that out at sundown and took it in in the
 morning. He saw the stars, and all there was about the stars was,
 "He made the stars also." They were just "also." They were close
 by, and they were purely for man to look at, about like diamonds in
 the shirt bosoms of people who like them.</p><p>
 
      This was not an unreasonable idea, considering what they had
 to go on. The people who still believe it have no more to go on.
 Blind men can't be taught to see or deaf people to hear. The
 primitive people thought that the stars were right near by and just
 the size they seemed to be. Of course now we know that some of them
 are so far away that light traveling at nearly 286,000 miles a 
 second is several million light years getting to the earth, and
 some of them are so large that our sun, even, would be a fly-speck
 to them. The larger the telescopes the more of them we see, and the
 imagination can't compass the end of them. It is just humanly
 possible that somewhere amongst the infinite number of infinitely
 larger and more important specks of mud in the universe there might
 be some organisms of matter that are just as intelligent as our
 people on the earth. So to have the idea that all of this was made
 for man gives man a great deal of  what Weber and Field used to
 call "Proud flesh."</p><p>
 
      Man can't get conceited from what he knows today, and he can't
 get it from what intellectual people ever knew. You remember, in
 those days the firmament was put in to divide the water below from
 the water above. They didn't know exactly what it was made of, but
 they knew what it was. Heaven was up above the firmament. They knew
 what it was, because Jacob had seen the angels going up and down on
 a ladder. Of course, a ladder was the only transportation for such
 purposes known to Jacob. If he had been dreaming now, they would
 have been going up in a flying machine and coming down in the same
 way.</p><p>
 
      Our conceptions of things root back; and that, of course, is
 the reason for our crude religions, our crude laws, our crude
 ideas, and our exalted opinion of the human race.</p><p>
 
      Omar had it nearer right. He didn't much overestimate the
 human race. He knew it for what it was, and that wasn't much. He
 knew about what its power was; he didn't expect much from the human
 race. He didn't condemn men, because he knew he couldn't do any
 better. As he puts it.</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      But helpless Pieces of the Game He plays<br>
      Upon this Chequer-Board of Nights and Days:<br>
           Hither and thither moves, and checks and slays<br>
      And one by one back in the Closet lays.<p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      Compare that conception with Mr. Henley's, with his glorious
 boast that he is the captain of his soul and the master of his
 fate. Anyone who didn't catch that idea from the ordinary thought
 of the community, but carved it out for himself, would be a subject
 for psychopathic analysis and examination. When you have an idea
 that everybody else has, of course you are not crazy, but if you
 have silly ideas that nobody else has, of course you are crazy.
 That is the only way to settle it.</p><p>
 
      Most people believe every day many things for which others are
 sent to the insane asylum. The insane asylums are full of religious
 exaltants who have just varied a little bit from the standard of
 foolishness. It isn't the foolishness that places them in the bug-
 house, it is the slight variations from the other fellows'
 foolishness -- that is all. If a man says he is living with the
 spirits today, he is insane. If he says that Jacob did, he is all
 right. That is the only difference.</p><p>
 
      Omar says we are simply "impotent pieces in the game He plays"
 -- of course, he uses a capital letter when he spells, He which is 
 all right enough for the purpose -- "in the game He plays upon this
 chequer-board of nights and days." And that is what man is. If one
 could vision somebody playing a game with human pawns, one would
 think that everyone who is moved around here and there was moved
 simply at the will of a player and he had nothing whatever to do
 with the game, any more than any other pawn. And he has nothing
 more to do with it than any other pawn.</p><p>
 
      Omar expresses this opinion over and over again. He doesn't
 blame man; he knows the weakness of man. He knew the cruelty of
 judging him.</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      The Moving Finger writes; and having writ,<br>
      Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit<br>
           Shall lure it back to cancel half a line,<br>
      Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.<p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      Whatever the impulse calls one to do, whatever the baubles or
 the baits that set in motion many acts, however quickly or
 emotionally, the consequences of the acts, as far as he is
 concerned, never end. All your piety and all your wit cannot wipe
 out a word of it! Omar pities man; he doesn't exalt God, but he
 pities man. He sees what man can do; and, more important still, he
 sees what he cannot do. He condemns the idea that God could or
 should judge man. The injustice of it, the foolishness of it all,
 appeals to him and he puts it in this way:
 
 <cite><ul>
      O Thou who didst with pitfall and with gin<br>
      Beset the Road I was to wander in.<br>
           Thou wilt not with Predestin'd Evil round<br>
      Enmesh, and then impute my Fall to Sin!<p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      Nothing ever braver and stronger and truer than that!
 Preachers have wasted their time and their strength and such
 intelligence and learning as they can command, talking about God
 forgiving man, as if it was possible for man to hurt God, as if
 there was anything to be forgiven from man's standpoint. They pray
 that man be forgiven and urge that man should be forgiven. Nobody
 knows for what, but still it has been their constant theme. Poets
 have done it; Omar knew better. Brave and strong and clear and far-
 seeing, although living and dying eight hundred years ago. This is
 what he says about forgiveness:</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      0 thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,<br>
        And ev'n with Paradise devised the Snake:<br>
          For all the sin wherewith the Face of Man<br>
        Is blacken'd -- Man's forgiveness give -- and take!<p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      "Man's forgiveness give -- and take!" If man could afford to
 forgive God, He ought to be willing to forgive man. Omar knew it.
 "Ev'n with paradise devised the snake." Taking the orthodox theory,
 for all the sin with which the earth is blackened, "Man's
 forgiveness give -- and take!" That is courage; it is science. It
 is sense, and it isn't the weak, cowardly whining of somebody who 
 is afraid he might be hurt unless he whines and supplicates, which
 he always does, simply hoping that some great power will have
 compassion on him. Always cowardice and fear, and nothing else!</p><p>
 
      Omar was wise enough to know that if there was any agency
 responsible for it, that agency was responsible. He made us as we
 are, and as He wished to make us, and to say that a weak, puny,
 ignorant human being, here today and gone tomorrow, could possibly
 injure God or be responsible for his own weakness and his
 ignorance, of course is a travesty upon all logic; and of course it
 does great credit to all superstition, for it couldn't come any
 other way.</p><p>
 
      Housman is equally sure about this. He knows about the
 responsibility of man. Strange how wonderfully alike runs their
 philosophy! Housman condemned nobody. No pessimist does -- only
 good optimists. People who believe in a universe of law never
 condemn or hate individuals. Only those who enthrone man believe in
 free will, and make him responsible for the terrible crudities of
 Nature and the force back of it, if there is such a force. Only
 they are cruel to the limit.</p><p>
 
      One can get Housman's idea of the responsibility of the human
 being from his beautiful little poem, "The Culprit," the plaintive
 wailing of a boy to be executed the next morning, when he, in his
 blindness and terror, asked himself the question, "Why is it and
 what does it all mean?" and thought about the forces that made him,
 and what a blind path he traveled, as we all do. He says:</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      The night my father got me<br>
           His mind was not on me;<br>
      He did not plague his fancy<br>
           To muse if I should be<br>
           The son you see.<p>
 
      The day my mother bore me<br>
           She was a fool and glad,<br>
      For all the pain I cost her,<br>
           That she had borne the lad<br>
           That borne she had.</p><p>
 
      My mother and my father<br>
           Out of the light they lie;<br>
      The warrant would not find them,<br>
           And here 'tis only I<br>
           Shall hang on high.</p><p>
 
      Oh let no man remember<br>
           The soul that God forgot<br>
      But fetch the county kerchief<br>
           And noose me in the knot,<br>
           And I will rot.</p><p>
 
      For so the game is ended<br>
           That should not have begun.<br>
      My father and my mother<br>
           They have a likely son,<br>
           And I have none.</p><p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      Nobody lives in this world to himself or any part of himself.
 Nobody fashions his body, and still less is responsible for the
 size or the fineness of his brain and the sensitiveness of his
 nervous system. No one has anything to do with the infinite
 manifestations of the human body that produce the emotions, that
 force men here and there. And yet religion in its cruelty and its
 brutality brands them all alike. And the religious teachers are so
 conscious of their own guilt that they only seek to escape
 punishment by loading their punishment onto someone else. They say
 that the responsibility of the individual who in his weakness goes
 his way is so great and his crimes are so large that there isn't a
 possibility for him to be saved by his own works.</p><p>
 
 </p><hr>
 
      The law is only the slightest bit more intelligent. No matter
 who does it, or what it is, the individual is responsible. If he is
 manifestly and obviously crazy they may make some distinction; but
 no lawyer is wise enough to look into the human mind and know what
 it means. The interpretations of the human judges were delivered
 before we had any science on the subject whatever, and they
 continue to enforce the old ideas of insanity, in spite of the fact
 that there isn't an intelligent human being in the world who has
 studied the question who ever thinks of it in legal terms. Judges
 instruct the jury that if a man knows the difference between right
 and wrong he cannot be considered insane. And yet an insane man
 knows the difference better than an intelligent man, because he has
 not the intelligence and the learning to know that this is one of
 the hardest things to determine, and perhaps the most impossible.
 You can ask the inmates of any insane asylum whether it is right to
 steal, lie, or kill, and they will all say "No," just as little
 children will say it, because they have been taught it. It
 furnishes no test, but still lawyers and Judges persist in it, to
 give themselves an excuse to wreak vengeance upon unfortunate
 people.<p>
 
      Housman knew better. He knew that in every human being is the
 imprint of all that has gone before, especially the imprint of his
 direct ancestors. And not only that, but that it is the imprint of
 all the environment in which he has lived, and that human
 responsibility is utterly unscientific, and besides that, horribly
 cruel.</p><p>
 
      Another thing that impressed itself upon all these poets alike
 was the futility of life. I don't know whether a college succeeds
 in making pupils think that they are very important in the scheme
 of the universe. I used to be taught that we were all very
 important. Most all the boys and girls who were taught it when I
 was taught it are dead, and the world is going on just the same. I
 have a sort of feeling that after I am dead it will go on just the
 same, and there are quite a considerable number of people who think
 it will go on better. But it won't; I haven't been important enough
 even to harm it. It will go on just exactly the same.</p><p>
 
      We are always told of the importance of the human being and
 the importance of everything he does; the importance of his not
 enjoying life, because if he is happy here of course he can't be 
 happy hereafter, and if he is miserable here he must be happy
 hereafter. Omar made short work of that, of those promises which
 are not underwritten, at least not by any responsible people. He
 did not believe in foregoing what little there is of life in the
 hope of having a better time hereafter.</p><p>
 
      He says, "Ah, take the Cash and let the Credit go." Good
 advice that: "Ah, take the Cash and let the Credit go." If you take
 the "Credit," likely as not you will miss your fun both here and
 hereafter. Omar knew better.</p><p>
 
      It is strange how the religious creeds have hammered that idea
 into the human mind. They have always felt there was a kinship
 between pleasure and sin. A smile on the face is complete evidence
 of wickedness. A solemn, uninteresting countenance is a stamp of
 virtue and goodness, of self-denial, that will surely be rewarded.
 Of course, the religious people are strangely hedonistic without
 knowing it! There are some of us who think that the goodness or
 badness of an act in this world can be determined only by pain and
 pleasure units. The thing that brings pleasure is good, and the
 thing that brings pain is bad. There is no other way to determine
 the difference between good and bad. Some of us think so: I think
 so.</p><p>
 
      Of coarse, the other class roll their eyes and declaim against
 this heathen philosophy, the idea that pain and pleasure have
 anything to do with the worth-whileness of existence. It isn't
 important for you to be happy here. But why not? You are too
 miserable here so you will be happy hereafter; and the hereafter is
 long and the here is short. They promise a much bigger prize than
 the pagan for the reward of conduct. They simply want you to trust
 them. They take the pain and pleasure theory with a vengeance, but
 they do business purely on credit. They are dealers in futures! I
 could never understand, if it was admissible to have joy in heaven,
 why you couldn't have it here, too. And if joy is admissible at
 all, the quicker you get at it the better, and the surer you are of
 the result. Omar thought that: "Ah, take the Cash, and let the
 Credit go!" Take the Cash and let the other fellow have the Credit!
 That was his philosophy, and I insist it is much better, and more
 intelligent philosophy than the other.</p><p>
 
      But Omar had no delusions about how important this human being
 is. He had no delusions about the mind, about man's greatness. He
 knew something about philosophy or metaphysics, whatever it is. He
 knew the uncertainty of human calculations, no matter who arrived
 at them. He knew the round-about way that people try to find out
 something, and he knew the results. He knew the futility of all of
 it.</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      Myself When young did eagerly frequent<br>
      Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument<br>
           About it and about: but evermore<br>
      Came out by the same door where in I went.<p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      That is what Omar thought. Man evermore came out by the same
 door where in he went. Therefore, "take the Cash and let the Credit
 go!"' He put it even stronger than this. He knew exactly what these
 values were worth, if anything. He knew what a little bit there is
 to the whole bag of tricks. What's the difference whether you were
 born 75 years ago, or fifty or twenty-five? what's the difference
 whether you are going to live ten years, or twenty or thirty, or
 weather you are already dead? In that case you escape something!
 This magnifying the importance of the human being is one of the
 chief sins of man and results in all kinds of cruelty.</p><p>
 
      If we took the human race for what it is worth, we could not
 be so cruel. Omar Khayyam knew what it was, this life, that we talk
 so much about:</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      'Tis but a Tent where takes his one day's rest<br>
      A Sultan to the realm of Death addrest;<br>
           The Sultan rises, and the dark Forrash<br>
      Strikes, and prepares it for another Guest.<p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      "Tis but a Tent where takes his one day's rest" -- is there
 anything else, if one could just make a survey of the human being,
 passing across the stage of life? I suppose man has been upon the
 earth for over a million years. A million years, and perhaps his
 generations may be thirty to thirty-five years long. Think of the
 generations in a thousand years, in 5,000 years, in a hundred
 thousand, in a million years! There are a billion and a half of
 these important organisms on the earth at any one time. All of
 them, all important -- kings, priests and professors, and doctors
 and lawyers and presidents, and 100 per cent Americans, and
 everything on earth you could think of -- Ku Kluxers, W.C.T.U.'s,
 Knights of Columbus and Masons, everything. All of them important
 in this scheme of things! All of them seeking to attract attention
 to themselves, and not even satisfied when they get it!</p><p>
 
      What is it all about? it is strange what little things will
 interest the human mind -- baseball games, fluctuations of the
 stock market, revivals, foot races, hangings, Anything will
 interest them. And the wonderful importance of the human being!</p><p>
 
      Housman knew the importance just as well as Omar. He has
 something to say about it, too. He knew it was just practically
 nothing. Strangely like him! The little affairs of life, the little
 foolishnesses of life, the things that consume our lives without
 any result whatever; he knew them and knew what they were worth. He
 knew they were worth practically nothing. But we do them; the urge
 of living keeps us doing them, even when we know how useless and
 foolish they are. Housman understood them:</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      Yonder see the morning blink:<br>
           The sun is up, and up must I.<br>
      To wash and dress and eat and drink<br>
      And look at things and talk and think<br>
           And work, and God knows why.<p>
 
      Oh often have I washed and dressed<br>
           And what's to show for all my pain?<br>
      Let me lie abed and rest:<br>
      Ten thousand times I've done my best<br>
           And all's to do again.</p><p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      That is what life is, rising in the morning and washing and
 dressing and going to recitations and studying and forgetting it,
 and then going to bed at night, to get up the next morning and wash
 and dress and go to recitation, and so on, world without end.</p><p>
 
      One might get a focus on it from the flies. They are very busy
 buzzing round. You don't exactly know what they are saying, because
 we can't understand fly language. Professors can't teach you fly
 language! We can't tell what they are saying, but they are probably
 talking about the importance of being good, about what's going to
 happen to their souls and, when. And when they are stiff in the
 morning in the Autumn and can hardly move round, the housewife gets
 up and builds the fire, and the heat limbers them up. She sets out
 the bread and butter on the table. The flies come down and get into
 it, and they think the housewife is working for them. Why not?</p><p>
 
      Is there any difference? Only in the length of the agony. What
 other? Apparently they have a good time while the sun is shining,
 and apparently they die when they get cold. It is a proposition of
 life and death, forms of matter clothed with what seems to be
 consciousness, and then going back again into inert matter, and
 that is all. There isn't any manifestation that we humans make that
 we do not see in flies and in other forms of matter.</p><p>
 
      Housman understands it; they have all understood it. Read any
 of the great authors of the world -- any of them; their hopes and
 their fears and their queries and their doubt, are, about the same.
 There is only one man I know of that can answer everything, and
 that is Dr Cadman.</p><p>
 
      Housman saw it. He knew a little of the difference between age
 and youth -- and there is some. The trouble is, the old men always
 write the books; they write them not in the way they felt when they
 were young, but in the way they feel now. And they preach to the
 young, and condemn them for doing what they themselves did when
 they had the emotion to do it. Great teachers, when they grow old!
 Perhaps it is partly envy and the desire that no one shall have
 anything they can't have. Likely it is, but they don't know it.
 Housman says something about this:</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      When first my way to fair I took<br>
           Few pence in purse hid I,<br>
      And long I used to stand and look<br>
           At things I could not buy.<p>
 
      Now times are altered: if I care<br>
           To bay a thing I can;<br>
      The pence are here and here's the fair,<br>
           But where's the lost young man?</p><p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      The world is somewhat different. The lost young man was once
 looking at the fair. He couldn't go in, and he liked it more for
 that; but now he is tired of the fair and tired of the baubles that
 once amused him and the riddles he once tried to guess, and he
 can't understand that the young man still likes to go to the fair.</p><p>
 
      We hear a great deal said by the ignorant about the wickedness
 of the youth of today. Well, I don't know: some of us were wicked
 when we were young. I don't know what is the matter with the youth
 of today having their fling. I don't know that they are any
 wickeder today. First, I don't know what the word wicked moans. Oh,
 I do know what it means: It means unconventional conduct. But I
 don't know whether unconventional conduct is wicked in the sense
 they mean it is wicked, or whether conventional conduct is good in
 the sense they mean it is good. Nobody else knows!</p><p>
 
      But I remember when I was a boy -- it was a long time ago --
 I used to hear my mother complain. My mother would have been pretty
 nearly 125 years old if she had kept on living, but luckily for her
 she didn't! I used to hear her complain of how much worse the girls
 were that she knew than the girls were when she was a girl. Of
 course, she didn't furnish any bill of particulars; she didn't
 specify, except not hanging up their clothes, and gadding, and
 things like that. But at any rate, they were worse. And my father
 used to tell about it, and I have an idea that Adam and Eve used to
 talk the same fool way.</p><p>
 
      The truth is, the world doesn't change, or the generations of
 men or the human emotions. But the individual changes as he grows
 old. You hear about the Revolt of Youth. Some people are pleased at
 it and some displeased. Some see fine reasons for hope in what they
 call the youth movement. They can put it over on the old people,
 but not on the youth! There is a Revolt of Youth.</p><p>
 
      Well, youth has always been in revolt. The greatest trouble
 with youth is that it gets old. Age changes it. It doesn't bring
 wisdom, though most old people think because they are old they have
 wisdom. But you can't get wisdom by simply growing old. You can
 even forget it that way! Age means that the blood runs slow, that
 the emotions are not as strong, that you play safer, that you stay
 closer to the hearth. You don't try to find new continents or even
 explore old ones. You don't travel into unbeaten wilderness and lay
 out new roads. You stick to the old roads when you go out at all.</p><p>
 
      The world can't go on with old people. It takes young ones
 that are daring, with courage and faith.</p><p>
 
      The difference between youth and old age is the same in every
 generation. The viewpoint is in growing old, that is all. But the
 old never seem wise enough to know it, and forever the old have
 been preaching to the young. Luckily, however, the young pay very
 little attention to it. They sometimes pretend to, but they never
 do pay much attention to it. Otherwise, life could not exist.</p><p>
 
      Both of these poets saw the futility of life: the little
 things of which it is made, scarcely worth the while. It is all
 right to talk about futility. We all know it, if we know much of
 anything. We know life is futile. A man who considers that his life
 is of very wonderful importance is awfully close to a padded cell.
 Let anybody study the ordinary, everyday details of life; see how
 closely he is bound and fettered; see how little it all amounts to.</p><p>
 
      There are a billion and a half people in the world, all of
 them trying to shout loud enough to be heard all at once, so as to
 attract the attention of the public, so they may be happy. A
 billion and a half of them, and if they all attracted attention
 none of them would have attention! Of course, attention is only
 valuable if the particular individual attracts it and nobody, else
 can get it. That is what makes presidents and kings -- they get it
 and nobody else.</p><p>
 
      Then when you consider that it is all made up of little
 things, what is life all about, anyway? We do keep on living. It is
 easy enough to demonstrate to people who think that life is not
 worth while. We could do it easier if we could only settle what
 worth while means. But if we settle it and convince ourselves that
 it is not worth while, we still keep on living. life does not come
 from willing; rather it does not come from thought and reason. I
 don't live because I think it is worth while; I live because I am
 a going concern, and every going concern tries to keep on going, I
 don't care whether it is a tree, or a plant, or what we call a
 lower animal, or man, or the Socialist party. Anything that is
 going tries to go on by its own momentum, and it does just keep on
 going -- it is what Schopenhauer called the 'will to live.' So we
 must assume that we will live anyhow as long as we can. When the
 machine runs down we don't have to worry about it any longer.</p><p>
 
      Hotisman asked himself this question, and Omar asked himself
 this question. Life is of little value. What are we going to do
 while we live? In other words, what is the purpose, if we can use
 the word purpose in this way, which is an incorrect way? What
 purpose are we going to put into it? Why should we live; and if we
 must live, then what? Omar tells us what. He knew there was just
 one thing important; he knew what most thinkers know today. He put
 it differently -- he and FitzGerald together. It is a balance
 between painful and pleasurable emotions. Every organized being
 looks for pleasurable emotions and tries to avoid painful ones. The
 seed planted in the ground seeks the light. The instinct of
 everything is to move away from pain and toward pleasure. Human
 beings are just like all the rest. The earth and all its
 manifestations are simply that. Omar figured it out, and after
 philosophizing and finding that he ever came out the same door
 where in he went, he said:</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      You know, my Friends, with what a brave Carouse<br>
      I made a Second Marriage in my house;<br>
           Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed,<br>
      And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse.<p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      That is one way of forgetting life -- one way of seeking
 pleasurable emotions: "I took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse."
 A way that has been fairly popular down through the ages! Even in
 spite of the worst that all the fanatics could possibly do, it has
 been a fairly universal remedy for the ills of man. It would be
 perfect If it were not for the day after!</p><p>
 
      He says in his wild exuberance:</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      Come, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring<br>
      Your Winter-Garment of Repentance fling;<br>
           The Bird of Time has but a little way<br>
      To flutter -- and the Bird is on the Wing.<p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      There isn't much of it; but while it is fluttering, help it.
 It has but a little way to flutter, and it is on the wing!</p><p>
 
      To those who are not quite so strenuous, there is an appeal
 more to beauty, a somewhat more permanent although not much more,
 but a more beautiful conception of pleasure, which is all he could
 get:</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,<br>
      A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread -- and Thou<br>
           Beside me singing in the Wilderness --<br>
      Oh, Wilderness were Paradise now!<p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      Well, if you get the right jug and the right book and the rest
 of the paraphernalia, it isn't so bad!</p><p>
 
      It is strange that two so different human beings have sought
 about the same thing. This physical emotional life that we hear so
 much about is the only life we know anything about. They sought
 their exaltation there, and Omar Khayyam pictured it very well.
 Housman again does as well. What does he say about the way to spend
 life and about life?</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      Loveliest of trees, the cherry now<br>
      Is hung with bloom along the bough,<br>
      And stands about the woodland ride<br>
      Wearing white for Eastertide.<p>
 
      Now, of my threescore, years and ten,<br>
      Twenty will not come again,<br>
      And take from seventy springs a score,<br>
      It only leaves me fifty more.</p><p>
 
      And since to look at things in bloom<br>
      Fifty springs are little room,<br>
      About the woodlands I will go<br>
      To see the cherry hung with snow.</p><p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      What else is there? So while the light is still on and while
 I can still go, and when the cherry is in bloom -- I will go to see
 the cherries hung with snow.</p><p>
 
      That is the whole philosophy of life for those who think; that
 is all there is to it, and it is what everybody is trying to do,
 without fully realizing it. Many are taking the Credit and letting
 the Cash go. Housman is right about that.</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      Since to look at things in bloom<br>

      About the woodlands I will go<br>

 </p></ul></cite>
 
      That is why I have so little patience with the old preaching
 to the young. If youth, with its quick-flowing blood, its strong 
 imagination, its virile feeling; if youth, with its dreams and its
 hopes and ambitions, can go about the woodland to see the cherry
 hung with snow, why not? Who are the croakers, who have run their
 race and lived their time, who are they to keep back expression and
 hope and youth and joy from a world that is almost barren at the
 best?</p><p>
 
      It has been youth that has kept the world alive; it will be,
 because from the others emotion has fled; and with the fleeing of
 emotion, through the ossification of the brain, all there is left
 for them to do is to preach. I hope they have a good time doing
 that, and I am so glad the young pay no attention to it!</p><p>
 
      Of course, Housman and Omar and the rest of us are called
 pessimist's. It is a horrible name. What is a pessimist, anyway? It
 is a man or a woman who looks at life as life is. If you could, you
 might take your choice, perhaps, as to being a pessimist or a pipe
 dreamer. But you can't have it, because you look at the world
 according to the way you are made. Those are the two extremes. The
 pessimist takes life for what life is: not all sorrow, not all
 pain, not all beauty, not all good. Life is not black; life is not
 orange, red, or green, or all the colors of the rainbow. Life is no
 one shade or hue.</p><p>
 
      It is well enough to understand it. If pessimism could come as
 the result of thought, I would think a pessimist was a wise man.
 What is an optimist, anyway? He reminds "Me of a little boy running
 through the woods and looking up at the sky and not paying any
 attention to the brambles or thorns he is scrambling through. There
 is a stone in front of him and he trips over the stone. Browning
 said, "God's in his heaven and all's right with the world." Others
 say, "God is love, love is God," and so on. A man who thinks that
 is bound to be an optimist. He believes that things are good.</p><p>
 
      The pessimist doesn't necessarily think that everything is
 bad, but he looks for the worst. He knows it will come sooner or
 later. When an optimist falls, he falls a long way; when a
 pessimist falls it is a very short fall. When an optimist is
 disappointed he is very, very sad, because he believed it was the
 best of all possible worlds, and God's in his heaven and all's well
 with the world. When a pessimist is disappointed he is happy, for
 he wasn't looking for anything.</p><p>
 
      This is the safest and by all odds it is the wisest outlook.
 Housman has put it in a little poem. It is about the last thing I
 shall give you. Housman is the only man I know of who has written
 a poem about pessimism. Nearly all the people who are talking about
 pessimism talk in prose; it is very prosy. Poems are generally
 written about optimism:</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      I am the master of my fate;<br>
      I am the captain of my soul.<p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
 Those are the sort of poems. Of course there have been poems
 written about pessimism. Poetry is really, to my way of thinking, 
 good only if it is beauty and if it is music.</p><p>
 
      I don't mean tonight to discuss the question of free verse and
 poetry, or the comparative merits of the two styles, or of prose,
 but I do think that poetry is an exaltation and that you can't hold
 it for long. Poetry ought to have beauty and it ought to have
 music. It should have both. You can be the poet of sadness; sadness
 lends itself to poetry as much as gladness, although few poets know
 how to use it. Listen to this from Housman:</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      With rue my heart is laden;<br>
           For golden friends I had,<br>
      For many a rose-lipt maiden<br>
           And many a lightfoot lad.<p>
 
      By brooks too broad for leading<br>
           The lightfoot boys are laid,<br>
      The rose-lipt girls are sleeping<br>
           In fields where raises fade.</p><p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      That is sad, isn't it? But it is beautiful.</p><p>
 
      I remember once, years and years ago, reading Olive
 Schreiner's Story of an African farm, in which she describes the
 simple Boers of South Africa, with their sorrows and their
 pleasures. She used this expression: which it took me some time to
 understand, in describing pain and pleasure: "There is a depth of
 emotion so broad and deep that pain and pleasure are the same."
 They are the same, and I think they find their meeting in beauty.
 The beauty, even if it is painful, is still beauty. You find the
 meeting of pain and pleasure, and you can hardly distinguish
 between the two emotions.</p><p>
 
      Housman knew it; he knew how to do it. Here is his idea of the
 young lad who dies: not passes on -- passes off. He dies:</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      Now hollow fires burn out to black<br>
           And lights are guttering low:<br>
      Square your shoulders, lift your pack,<br>
           And leave your friends and go.<p>
 
      Oh never fear man, nought's to dread,<br>
           Look not left or right:<br>
      In all the endless road you tread<br>
           There's nothing but the night.</p><p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      Does it bring you painful or pleasurable emotions? It is
 beautiful; it is profound; it is deep. To me the painful and
 pleasurable are blended in the beauty, and I think the two may be
 one.</p><p>
 
      Housman, as I have said, is the only one I know who wrote a
 poem of pessimism; and this, like all of his, is very short, and I
 will read it. Somebody else may have written one; but Housman
 carries the philosophy of pessimism into poetry, perhaps the
 philosophy that I have given you. This poem is supposed to be
 introduced by somebody who complains of Housman's dark, almost
 tragical verses. For in every line that he ever wrote there is no
 let down. He is like Hardy; he never hauled down the flag. Life to 
 him was what he saw; what the world saw meant nothing. This was the
 view in all of Housman's work. In all of his work there is not one
 false note; and when I say a false note I mean one that is not in
 tune with the rest. This is his idea of pessimism in poetry:</p><p>
 
 <cite><ul>
      "Terence this is stupid stuff:<br>
      You eat your victuals fast enough;<br>
      There can't be much amiss, 'tis clear,<br>
      To see the rate you drink your beer.<br>
      But oh, good Lord, the verse you make,<br>
      It gives a chap the belly-ache.<p>
 
      We poor lads, 'tis our turn now<br>
      To hear such tunes as killed the cow.<br>
      Pretty friendship 'tis to rhyme<br>
      Your friends to death before their time<br>
      Moping melancholy mad:<br>
      Come, pipe a tune to dance to, lad."</p><p>
 
      Why, if 'tis dancing you would be,<br>
      There's brisker pipes than poetry.<br>
      Say, for what were hop-yards meant,<br>
      Or why was Burton built on Trent?<br>
      Oh many a peer of England brews<br>
      Livelier liquor than the Muse,<br>
      And malt does more than Milton can<br>
      To justify God's ways to man.<br>
      Ale, man, ale's the stuff to drink<br>
      For fellows whom it hurts to think:<br>
      Look into the pewter pot<br>
      To see the world as the world's not.<br>
      And faith, 'tis pleasant till 'tis past:<br>
      The mischief is that 'twill not last.</p><p>
 
      Oh I have been to Ludlow fair<br>
      And left my necktie God knows where,<br>
      And carried half way home, or near.<br>
      Pints and quarts of Ludlow beer:<br>
      Then the world seemed none so bad,<br>
      And I myself a sterling lad;<br>
      And down in lovely muck I've lain,<br>
      Happy till I woke again.<br>
      Then I saw the morning sky:<br>
      Heigho, the tale was all a lie;<br>
      The world it was the old world yet,<br>
      I was I, my things were wet.<br>
      And nothing now, remained to do<br>
      But begin the game anew.</p><p>
 
      Therefore, since the world has still<br>
      Much good, but much less good than Ill,<br>
      And while the sun and moon endure<br>
      Luck's a chance, but trouble's sure.<br>
      I'd face it as a wise man would,<br>
      And train for ill and not for good.<br>
      'Tis true the stuff I bring for sale<br>
      Is not so brisk a brew as ale:<br>
      Out of a stem that scored the hand<br>
      I wrung it in a weary land.<br>
      But take it: if the smack is sour,<br>
      The better for the embittered hour;<br>
      It should do good to heart and head<br>
      When your soul" is in my soul's stead;<br>
      And I will friend you, if I may,<br>
      In the dark and cloudy day.</p><p>
 </p></ul></cite>
 
      "Luck's a chance but trouble's sure." The moral of it is to
 "train for ill and not for good."</p><p>
 
      If I had my choice, I would not like to be an optimist, even
 assuming that people did not know that I was an idiot. I wouldn't
 want to be an optimist because when I fell I would fall such a
 terribly long way. The wise man trains for ill and not for good. He
 is sure he will need that training, and the other will take care of
 itself as it comes along.</p><p>
 
      Of course, life is not all pleasant: it is filled with
 tragedy. Housman has told us of it, and Omar Khayyam tells us of
 it. No man and no woman can live and forget death. However much
 they try. it is there, and it probably should be faced like
 anything else. Measured time is very short. Life, amongst other
 things, is full of futility.</p><p>
 
      Omar Khayyam understood, and Housman understood. There are
 other poets that have felt the same way. Omar Khayyam looked on the
 shortness of life and understood it. He pictured himself as here
 for a brief moment. He loved his friends; he loved companionship;
 he loved wine. I don't know how much of it he drank. He talked
 about it a lot. It might have symbolized more than it really meant
 to him. It has been a solace, all down through the ages. Not only
 that, but it has been the symbol of other things that mean as much
 -- the wine of life, the joy of living.</p><p>
