 I may carefully render you an answer to your desire, understand, <i>Nature
 is potent and admirable in her working, </i>yet Art using the advantage
 of
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 </p><p><b>2 <i>Of the Invocation of Spirits.</i></b>
 </p><p>nature as an instrument (experience tels us) is of greater efficacy
 than any natural activity.
 </p><p>    Whatsoever Acts otherwise than by natural or artificial
 means, is not humane, but merely fictitious and deceitfull.
 </p><p>    We have many men that by the nimblenesse and activity
 of body, diversification of sounds, exactness of instruments, darkness,
 or consent, make things seem to be present, which never were really existent
 in the course of Nature. The world, as any judicious eye may see, groans
 under such bastard burdens. A Jugler by an handsome sleight of hand, will
 put a compleat lie upon the very sight. The <i>Pythonissæ</i> sometimes
 speaking from their bellies, otherwhile from the throat, than by the mouth,
 do create what voices they please, either speaking at hand, or farre off,
 in such a manner, as if a Spirit discoursed with a man, and sometimes as
 though Beasts bellowed, which is all easily discovered by private laying
 hollow Canes in the grasse, or secret places, for so the voices of men
 will be known from other creatures.
 </p><p>    When inanimate things are violently moved, either
 in the Morning or Eve-
 <br> 
 </p><p><b><i>Of the Invocation of Spirits.</i> 3</b>
 </p><p>ning twilight, expect no truth therein, but down-right cheating and
 cousenage.
 </p><p>    As for consent, men by it may undertake any thing
 they please, if so be they have a mutual disposition.
 </p><p>    These I mention, as practices wherein neither philosophical
 Reasons, Art, or power of Nature is prevalent. Beyond these there is a
 more damnable practice, when men despising the Rules of Philosophy, irrationally
 call up wicked Spirits, supposing them of Energy to satisfie their desires.
 In which there is a very vast errour, because such persons imagine they
 have some authority over Spirits, and that Spirits may be compelled by
 humane authority, which is altogether impossible, since humane Energy or
 Authority is inferiour by much to that of Spirits. Besides, they admit
 a more vast mistake, supposing such natural instruments, as they use, to
 be able either to call up, or drive away any wicked Spirit. And they continue
 their mistake in endeavouring by Invocations, Deprecations or Sacrifices
 to please Spirits, making them propitious to their design. Without all
 question, the way is incomparably more easie

 <br><b>4 <i>Of Charms, Figures,</i></b>
 <p>to obtain any thing, that is truly good for men, of God, or good Angels,
 then of wicked Spirits. As for things which are incommodious for men, wicked
 Spirits can no further yeeld assistance, then they have permission, for
 the sins of the sonnes of men, from that God, who governs and directs all
 humane affairs. Hence therefore I shall conclude (these things being beyond,
 or rather against the Rules of Wisdome) No true Philosopher did ever regard
 to work by any of these six wayes.

 </p><p><font size="+1">C H A P. I I.</font>
 </p><p><b><i>Of Charms, Figures, and their Use.</i></b></p></center>
 
 <p><b><font size="+3">W</font></b>Hat men ought to believe touching Figures,
 Charmes, and such stuff, I shall deliver my opinion. Without doubt there
 is nothing in these dayes of this kind, but what is either deceitfull,
 dubious, or irrational, which Philosophers formerly invented to hide their
 secret operations of Nature and Art from the eyes of an unworthy generation.
 For instance, if the virtue of the Load-stone, whereby
 </p><p><b><i>and their Use. 5</i></b>
 </p><p>whereby it draws iron to it were not discovered, some one or other who
 hath a mind hereby to cosen the people, so goes about his businesse, as
 lest any by-stander should discover the work of attraction to be natural,
 he calls Figures, and mutters forth some Charmes. Thus many things lie
 dark in Philosophical writings; in which the wiser sort of Readers will
 expresse so much discretion, as reject the Figures and Charmes, eying the
 works of Nature and Art, that so they may see the mutual concurrence of
 animate and inanimate creatures, occasioned by Natures conformity, not
 any efficacy of Figures or Charmes. This is the cause why the unlearned
 crew have judged such natural or artificial operations to be merely Magical.
 And some fond Magicians beleeve, That their casting of Figures and Charmes
 was the sole cause of such operations; hereupon leaving their natural and
 artificial operations have stuck close to their erroneous casting of Figures
 and Charmes. And thus they both have by their own folly deprived themselves
 of the benefit of the others wisdome. In times past, godly and religious
 men, or rather God himself, or his <font color="#FF0000">{Nnmb.6.27.}</font>

 <br><b>6 <i>Of Charms, Figures,</i></b>
 <p>good Angels composed several Prayers which yet may retain their primitive
 virtue. As to this day, in several Countreys certain prayers are made over
 hot irons, and water in the River, &amp;c. By which the innocent are cleared,
 and guilty condemned; yet all this is done by the Authority of the Church,
 and her Prelates. Our Priests exercise their holy water, <font color="#FF0000">{Numb.
 5.} </font>as formerly the <i>Jews </i>did in the Old Testament, in making
 the water of Tryal, whereby the wise was tryed, whether she were an adultresse,
 or honest. Not to instance in others of the like nature. Concerning those
 Secrets, which are revealed in Magicians writings, although they may contain
 some truth, yet in regard those very truths are enveloped with such a number
 of deceits, as it's not very easie to judge betwixt the truth and falshood,
 they ought all worthily to be rejected. Neither must men be believed, who
 would assure us, That <i>Solomon,</i> or some other of our sage Progenitors
 were Authors of such Books, because those Books are not received either
 by the Churches Authority, or by any prudent men, but only by a few cheating
 Compa-
 </p><p><b><i>and their Use. </i>7</b>
 </p><p>nions to be the work of such men. Mine own experience assures me they
 compose and set forth new works and inventions of their own, in lofty high
 flown expressions, the more colourably to make their lies passe under the
 shelter of the Text; prefixing some specious titles, the better to set
 them off, impudently ascribe such bastard births to famous Authors.
 </p><p>    Figures are either composed of words involved in
 the formes of letters, invented to contain the sense of some * speech or
 prayer <font color="#FF0000">{* Oraionis.}</font>; or they are made according
 to the face of the Heavens in proper and select seasons. The Figures of
 the former sort must have the same sentence that I gave of prayers formerly;
 as for Figures and * <font color="#FF0000">{* Sigillis.}</font>Impressions
 of the other kind, unlesse they be made in their peculiar seasons, they
 are not of any efficacy. And hence it is that all wise men think they effect
 nothing, who only go according to their prescribed Characters, not at all
 regarding more than the bare external forme. The more knowing sonnes of
 Art, dispose all their works of Nature and Art accord-
 </p><p>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><b>8 <i>Of Charms, Figures,</i></b>
 <p>ing to the power of the Heavens, casting their work under a right Constellation,
 no lesse than the casting it in a right Figure. Now in regard there is
 much difficulty to discern the motion of Celestial Bodies, many are cousened,
 and very few know, how to begin their work either profitably or truly.
 Hence it comes to passe, that the croud of judicious Mathematicians and
 Starre gazers effect little, and that unprofitable, while the more expert
 Professours, who sufficiently understand their own Art, attain many conveniences
 both by their Operations and Judgements in select and proper opportunities:
 And yet let us take notice, how the Physician, or he that would re-erect
 a drooping soul, effects his designe by the use of Figures or Charmes,
 which in themselves are meerly fictitious (as <i>Constantine</i> the Physician
 is of opinion.) <font color="#FF0000">{Thus some</font>
 <br><font color="#FF0000">think the Kings evil is cured, by creating 
 a belief the touch of the King can cure.} </font>Physicians use Figures
 or Charmes, not for any prevalency in them, but that the raising of the
 soul is of great efficacy in the curing of the body, and raising it from
 infirmity to health, by oy and confidence is done by Charmes;
 </p><p><b><i>and their Use. </i>9</b>
 </p><p>for they make the Patient receive the Medicine with greater confidence
 and desire, exciting courage, more liberal belief, hope and pleasure. The
 Physician then who would magnifie his cure, may work some way of exciting
 hope and confidence in his Patient; not that hereby he should cheat, but
 stirre up the sick to believe he shall recover, which if we pin our faith
 on <i>Constantines</i> sleeve, is very tolerable. <font color="#FF0000">{This
 may be</font>
 <br><font color="#FF0000">done lawfully, if the party that is the principal
 agent doth nothing by way of compact with any Spirit, or sinistrously.}</font>
 Upon this account he defends the hanging Charmes or Figures about the Neck.
 The soul no question is of much prevalency by reason of its strong affections
 over its proper body, as <i>Avicen</i> saith in <i>lib. de anima, &amp;</i>
 8. <i>&amp; animal.</i> to which all wise men accord. Hereupon it was,
 that they concluded sick persons should be delighted by the company of
 children to play before them, and other pleasing objects. Yea they frequently
 consent to such things as please the appetite, though they be obnoxious
 to their disease; because affection, desire and hope of the soul conquers
 many diseases.

 </p><p>    As for the Virtues which flows from the Creature,
 some of them are sensible, some insensible. Man which is both the most

 <i>Hyæna</i> suffers not the dog which comes within his shadow to
 bark (as <i>Solinus de mirabili bus mundi,
 </i>and others) And <i>Aristotle
 lib</i>.3.<i> de Vegetab. </i>saith, That Female Palm-trees bring forth
 fruit to maturity by the smell of their Males. And Mares in some Kingdoms
 impregnate by the smell of Horses (as <i>Solinus
 </i>affirms.) <i>Aristotle</i>
 in his Secrets assures us of several other contingencies which issue from
 the <i>Species</i> and Virtues of Plants and Animals. Hence I argue, If
 Plants and Animals, which are inferiour in dignity to our humane Nature,
 can emit, then surely may man more abundantly emit <i>Species,</i> Virtues
 and Colours to the alteration of external Bodies. To this purpose is that,
 which <i>Aristotle</i> tels us (<i>Lib. de somno &amp; Vigilia</i>) a menstruous
 woman looking in a glasse, doth infect it with spots, like clouds of blood.
 <i>Solinus </i>further writes,

 know, That men of an evil complexion, full of contagious infirmities, as
 Leprosie, the Falling-sickness, spotted Feaver, bleer-eyed, or the like,
 infects those men in their company: While on the other side, men of a sound
 and wholesome complexion, especially young men, do by their very presence
 exhilerate and comfort others; which no question, as <i>Galen</i> in his
 T<i>echne, </i>proceeds from their pure spirits wholsome and delightsome
 vapours, their sweet natural colour, and from such <i>Species</i> and Virtues
 as they emit. <font color="#FF0000">{He holds sight by emission.}</font>
 </p><p>    That man whose soul <font color="#FF0000">{The soul

 the man who hath a body may do something <i>Medicante corpre.</i>}
 </font>is defiledwithmany hainous
 sins, his Body infirme, his Complexion evil, and hath a vehement fancy
 and desire to hurt his neighbour, may bring more inconveniences,
 </p><p><b><i>and a Check to Magick. </i>13</b>
 </p><p>then another man. The Reason may be, the Nature of Complexion and infirmity
 yeelds obedience to the thoughts of the Heart, and is more augmented by
 the intervention of our desires. Hence it is that a leprous person, who
 is solicitous, desirous and fancying to infect some one or other in the
 room, may more easily and forceably effect it, than he which hath no such
 intention, fancy or desire. For (as <i>Avicen </i>observes in the fore
 cited place) the nature of the body is obedient to the thoughts, and more
 intent fancies of the soul. And (as <i>Avicen</i> in the 3<sup>d</sup><i>Metaph.</i>
 affirms) the thought is the first mover, after that the desire is made
 conformable to the thought, then after that the natural virtue, which is
 in the members, obeys the desire and thought; and thus it is both in good
 and bad effects. Hence it is that a young man of a good Complexion, healthfull,
 fair, well featured Body, having his soul not debauched with sinne, but
 of a strong fancy and vehement desire to compasse the effecting of some
 magnificent designe, withall adding the power of his Virtues, <i>Species

 <br><b>14<i> Of the force of Speech,</i></b>
 <p>fluences work both more powerfully and vehemently, than if he should
 want any of these fore going qualifications, especially strong affections
 and forceable imaginations. Hence I conclude, Men by the concurrence of
 the foresaid Causes, Words and Works being the Instruments, bring great
 undertakings to perfection.
 </p><p>    As for words, they are hatched within, by the thoughts
 and desires of the mind, sent abroad by heat, <i>Vocale arteries</i>, and
 motion of the Spirits. The places of their generation are in open passages,
 by which there is a great efflux of such spirits, heat, vapours, virtues,
 and <i>Species,</i> as are made by the soul and heart. And therefore words
 may so farre cause alterations by these parts or passages, as their Nature
 will extend. For it's evident, That breathings, yawnings, several resolutions
 of Spirits and heat come thorow these open passages from the heart and
 inward parts: Now if these words come from an infirm and evil complexionated
 body, they are constantly obnoxious. But if from a pure sound and wholsome
 constitution, they are very beneficial and comfortable. It's clear then,
 That the
 </p><p><b><i>and a Check to Magick. </i>15</b>
 </p><p>bare generation and prolation of words joyned with desire and intention
 are considerable in natural operations. Hereupon we do justly say, <i>Vox
 viva magnum habet virtutem;</i> Living words are of great Virtue. Not that
 they have any such Virtue of doing or undoing, as <i>Magicians</i> speak
 of, but only they have the Virtue of Nature, which makes me put in this
 Caution of being extream cautelous herein. For a man may, as many have
 already done, erre on both hands: Some wholly denying any operation of
 words: Others superfluously decline to a Magical use thereof. Our duties
 should be to have a care of such Books, as are fraught with Charms, Figures,
 Orizons, Conjurations, Sacrifices, or the like, because they are purely
 Magical. For instance, the Book <i>De Officiis Spirituum,liber de morte
 animæ, liber de arte notoria</i> with infinite others, containing
 neither precepts of Nature or Art, having nothing save Magical Fopperies.
 Yet herewithall we must remember, there are many Books commonly reputed
 to be Magical, but have no other fault then discovering the dignity of

 <p>experience will show him. The Book which discovers natural or artificial
 operations imbrace; that which is void of either or leave both, as suspitious
 and unworthy the consideration of any wise man. 'Tis usual with <i>Magicians,</i>
 to treat of both unnecessary and superfluous subjects. 'Twas excellently
 said of <i>Isaac (in lib. de Febribus,) The rational soul is not impeded
 in its operations, unlesse by the Manicles of ignorance. </i>And <i>Aristotle</i>
 is of opinion, <i>(in lib. secret.) That a clear and strong intellect,
 being impregnated by the influences of divine Virtue, may attain to anything
 which is necessary. </i>And in 3<sup>d </sup>Meteor, he saith, <i>There
 is no influence or power, but from God.</i> In the Conclusion of his Ethics,
 <i>There
 is no Virtue, whether Moral or Natural without divine influence.
 </i>Hence
 it is, that when we discourse of particular agents, we exclude not the
 Regiment of the universal Agent, and first Cause of all things. For every
 first Cause hath more influence on the Effect, than any second Cause, as
 he speaks in the first proposition of Causes.

 yet of great efficacy, either to the depressing or elevation of the very

 For hereby a man may either ascend or descend any walls, delivering himself

 of Starres, or men assembled purposely to destroy them; Especially if the
 following designe be conjoyned to the former (<i>viz.</i>) Glasses so cast,
 that things at hand may appear at distance, and things at distance, as
 hard at hand: yea so farre may the designe be driven, as the least letters
 may be read, and things reckoned at an incredible distance, yea starres
 shine in what place you please. A way, as is verily believed, <i>Julius
 Cæsar</i> took by great Glasses from the Coasts of <i>France,</i>
 to view the site and disposition of stoth the Castles and SeaTowns in great
 <i>Britain.</i>
 By the framing of Glasses, bodies of the largest bulk, may in appearance
 be contracted to a minute volumne, things little in themselves show great,
 while others tall and lofty appear low and creeping, things creeping and
 low, high and mighty, things private and hidden to be clear and manifest.
 For as <i>Socrates</i> did discover a Dragon, whose prestiferous breathings
 and influences corrupted both City and Countrey thereabouts, to have

 </p><p>his residence in the Caverns of the Mountains. So may any other thing
 done in an Enemies Camp or Garison, be discovered. Glasses may be framed
 to send forth <i>Species,</i> and poisonous infectious influences, whither
 a man pleaseth. And this invention <i>Aristotle</i> shewed <i>Alexander,
 </i>by
 which he erecting the poison of a Basilisk upon the Wall of a City, which
 held out against his Army, conveyed the very poison into the City it self.

 is the description of Celestial Bodies, both according to their Longitude

 <p><b><font size="+3">T</font></b>O our former discourse we may adjoyn such
 work as are effected without Figurations. We may have an artificial composition
 of Saltpeter, and other ingredients; or of the oil of Red Petrolei, <font color="#FF0000">{Oleum

 he kept a City against the whole Roman Army: For by casting down <i>Maltha</i>
 he could burn a Souldier, though he had on his Armour. In the next place,
 to these we may place the <i>Grecian</i> fire, <font color="#FF0000">{Ignis

 burn, and waters to keep hot perpetually. For I know many things which
 are not consumed in the fire, as the Salamanders skin Talk, with others,
 which by some adjunct both are inflamed and shine, yet are not consumed,
 but rather purified. Besides these, we may speak of di-
 </p><p>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><b>24<i> Of strange Apparations.</i></b>
 <p>vers admirable peeces of * Nature. <font color="#FF0000">{* Art it should
 be, as I suppose.} </font>As the making Thunder and Lighting in the Air;
 yea with a greater advantage of horrour, then those which are onely produced
 by Nature. For a very competent quantity of matter rightly prepared (the
 bignesse of ones thumb) will make a most hideous noise and corruscation,
 this may be done several wayes; by which a City or Army may be overcome,
 much after the fashion as <i>Gideon</i> overcame that vast Army of the
 <i>Midianites
 </i>with three hundred men, by the breaking of their Pitchers, and shining
 of their Lamps, together with the sudden leaping forth of the fire, and
 inestimable crackings. These would appear strange, if they were designed
 to their just height both of proportion and matter. I might produce many
 strange works of another kind, which though they bring no sensible profit,
 yet contain an ineffible spectacle of wit, and may be applied to the probation
 of all such secrets, as the ignorant crew will not imbrace. Such might
 I name the attraction, of Iron to the Loadstone, a thing so in-
 <br> 
 </p><p><b><i>Of strange Apparations. </i>25</b>
 </p><p>credulous, as none save an eye-witnesse would believe. And in this attraction
 of Iron, experience will show a diligent searcher, more wonders than any
 vulgar capacity can entertain.
 </p><p>    But to proceed to greater, and more than these. There
 is an at-traction of gold, silver, and all other metals, by a certain stone,
 much after the same manner. <font color="#FF0000">{Silver and all other
 metals. Plin.Hist.l.36. cap.20. Aliter Vinegar.} </font>Besides one stone
 will runne to the heap. Plants may have their mutual concurrence, and the
 parts of sensible creatures locally divided, will naturally move to a mutual
 imbracement. The consideration whereof makes me think, that there is not
 any thing, whether in divine or outward matters too difficult for my faith.
 To proceed higher, The whole power of the Mathematicks may compose a spherical
 Engine, according to <i>Ptolomies</i> frame in eight Almagest; which sincerely
 describes both longitude and latitude of all Celestial Bodies; but to give
 them a natural diurnal motion is not in the power of the Mathematicks.
 However a discreet head-piece would do well to try the making hereof of
 </p><p>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><b>26<i> Of strange Apparations.</i></b>
 <p>such materials and artifice, as it might have a natural diurnal motion.
 Which seems to me possible; and because many things are moved with the
 motion of the Heavens, as Comets, the Sea tides, with several other things,
 which are turned about either in the whole or in part. Such a work might
 be thought more miracu-lous, and of a vaster benefit than any thing hitherto
 mentioned. For the perfecting of this would frustrate all other, whether
 the more curious, or the more vulgar Astronomical Instruments, which surely
 would be more valuable than a Kings Coffers; and yet there may matters
 be brought to passe, which though they will not reach so near a miracle,
 yet of farre greater publick and private profit. As the producing so much
 gold or silver, as we please, not by the work of Nature yet accomplishment
 of Art: seeing there may be ten and seven wayes of gold, eight by the mixture
 of silver with gold; and the first way is made by sixteen parts of gold
 with some parts of silver, which will attain the four and twentieth degree
 of gold, al- <font color="#FF0000">{Quid sint decem &amp; septem modi auri,

 <br> 
 </p><p><b><i>Of strange Apparations.</i> 27</b>
 </p><p>wayes augmenting one degree of gold with one of silver, and so for the
 mixture of brasse with gold. So the last way is * <font color="#FF0000">{*
 Ex from.}</font> by the four and twenty degrees of pure gold without mixture
 of other metal. And beyond this, Nature knows no further progresse, as
 experience tels us. Though Art may augment gold in the degrees of purity,
 even to infinitenesse, and compleat silver, without the least cheat: And
 yet that which seems more rare than all this is, That though the rational
 soul (hath so farre its free-will, as) it cannot be compelled, yet may
 effectually be excited,induced and disposed freely to alter its affections,
 desires and behaviours to the dictates of another man. And this may not
 only be practiced upon one particular person, but upon a whole Army, City,
 or Body of a Nation living under one Region, if we believe experience.
 And this experience, <i>Aristotle </i>discloseth in his Book of Secrets,
 both of an Army, Region and single person. And thus I have well nigh finished
 my thoughts of Nature and Art.

 of Life to a very old date. How farre this is attainable, manifold experience
 hath shewed us. <i>Pliny</i> reports, <font color="#FF0000">{Lib.22.cap.24.}</font>
 That <i>Pollio</i>, a man of a strong body and mind, lived much longer
 then men usually now: of whom <i>Octavius Augustus </i>enquiring, What
 course he took to live so long? was answered ænigmatically, he used
 Oyl without, and Mulsum within (now according to the opinion of some, it's
 eight parts of water, and nine of honey) I might produce many examples
 of the same quality: as that which fell out in the dayes of King <i>William</i>;
 A Countreyman plowing in the field, found a golden vessel, containing a
 certain liquor, which he supposing to be the Dew of Heaven, washed his
 face withall, and
 <br> 
 </p><p><b><i>Of Old Age, and Long Life.</i> 29</b>
 </p><p>drunk of it, whereby he became renued in spirit, body and excellency,
 <i>De
 bubulio factus est Bajulus Regis Sicilie, </i>from a Plow-man he was made
 Porter to the King of <i>Sicily.</i> And the Popes Letters assures us,
 That <i>Almannus,</i> held Prisoner by the <i>Saracens,</i> through the
 use of a Medicine lived five hundred years. For the King, whose Captive
 he was, having received this Medicine from the Embassadours of the great
 King, and being suspicious of them, made tryall hereof upon this Captive,
 which was brought him for that purpose. And the Lady of the Woods in great
 <i>Britanny</i>
 searching for a white Hinde, found an Ointment, wherewith the Keeper of
 the Woods anointed his whole body, except the soals of his feet, and he
 lived three hundred years without any corruption, save in the soals of
 his feet, which had some passions. We our selves know it frequent in these
 dayes, That plain Country men, without the advantage so much as of a Physicians
 advice, live very healthfully an hundred years, or little lesse. And these
 are the rather confirmed by the operations of Animals, as Harts, Ea-

 <br><b>30<i> Of Old Age, and Long Life.</i></b>
 <p>gles, Serpents, and many other, who by the efficacy of heart or stones,
 have renewed their youth: And wise men seeing that even bruits could reach
 so farre to their Prolongation, adjudging it no lesse feasable by reasonable
 men, set themselves on the Spurre to find out this secret. Hereupon <i>Artefius</i>
 from his own ingenuity, having found the Secrets, of Stones, Herbs, Sensibles,
 &amp;c. both for the knowledge of Nature, and especially the Prolongation
 of Life, did * rejoyce, <font color="#FF0000">{* Al. Glory. }</font> that
 he had lived 1025 yeares. Further, to confirme this Assertion of the Prolongation
 of Life, it's considerable, That man naturally is immortal, that is to
 say, <i>Potens non mori</i>, hath a possibility of not dying. Yea, even
 after his fall, he might live a thousand years, though by degrees the length
 of life was abbreviated. Hence it follows, That this abbreviation is Accidental,
 and consequentially may be repaired in whole or in part; and upon search
 we shall find the accidental cause of this corruption, is not from the
 Heavens, or any other than the defect of true Government of our health.
 In that our Fathers are
 <br> 
 </p><p><b><i>Of Old Age, and Long Life.</i> 31</b>
 </p><p>corrupt and imbecil, they beget sonnes of a corrupt complexion and composition,
 and their children upon the same score are corrupted. Thus the Pedigree
 of corruption is deprived from Fathers to sonnes, until we settle upon
 our heirs an assured abbreviation of our dayes. Yet this doth not conclude,
 That to perpetuity there shall succeed an abreviation of our life, since
 there is a positive period set to our life, men may live till they be eighty
 years, though then their dayes be but labour and sorrow. <font color="#FF0000">{Psalm

 </p><p>    Now if every man would from the brest exercise a
 compleat Regiment of health (which consists in such things as have relation
 to Meat, Drink, Sleep, Waking, Motion, Rest, Evacuation, Retention, Air,
 and the Passions of the mind) He might find a remedy resisting his proper
 malady. For upon the prosecution of such a Regiment, one might arrive at
 the uttermost limit of that Nature he had from his Parents will permit,
 <font color="#FF0000">{Deest

 of Nature (I mean Nature fallen from its origi-

 <br><b>32<i> Of Old Age, and Long Life.</i></b>
 <p>nal uprightness) beyond which there is no further progresse; because
 it doth little or nothing availe against the cor-ruption of our Ancestours:
 and yet the great impossibility of any mans so ordering himself in a mean,
 in all the fore-mentioned things, as the Regiment of health exacts, wherefore
 abbreviation of our dayes does not only from our Progenitors, but hath
 its advantages from the want of Regiment. However the Art of Physick sufficiently
 determines this. Although nor rich, or poor, wise or ignorant, no nor the
 most accurate Physicians themselves, do accomplish this Regiment in themselves
 or others, as every eye can discern; Yet Nature is not deficient in Necessaries,
 or Art any wayes incompleat, but rather is advantagious to make insurrections
 and irruptions against, and so farre into these accidental passions, as
 they are either wholly or in part rooted out. At first, and in the beginning
 of our ages declining, the remedy was easie: But since we have five thousand
 years or more disadvantage, the Cure is more craggy.
 </p><p>    But waving the Inconveniences wise
 <br> 
 </p><p><b><i>Of Old Age, and Long Life.</i> 33</b>
 </p><p>men moved by the considerations forementioned, have endeavoured to find
 out the means and wayes, which not only are forceable against the defects
 of every mans proper Regiment, but also against the corruptions of our
 Parents: Not that hereby they can attain to the yeares of <i>Adam</i> or
 <i>Artesius,</i>
 by reason of the growing corruption, but that our dayes may be augmented
 an hundred yeares, or more, above the ordinary age of most men in these
 dayes. And though it be impossible absolutely to retard the accidents of
 old age, yet hereby they may mitigate them, so as life will happily be
 prorogued beyond the common account, yet alwayes within the ultimate circuit
 of Nature. There is a bounder of Nature, set in men since their Fall. There
 is a bounder of every particulate man arising from the proper corruption
 of his Parents. Beyond both these bounders it's impossible to passe; yet
 happily one may arrive beyond the latter: nor yet so farre to go beyond
 it, as that the wisest of men can never reach the former. Although there
 be a pos-
 </p><p>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><b>34<i> Of Old Age, and Long Life.</i></b>
 <p>sibility and aptitude of Nature to proceed to that boundary our first
 Parents set them. Let no man think this strange, since this aptitude extends
 itself to immortality, as appears both before the fall,and shall be evident
 after the Resurrection.
 </p><p>    Perhaps you may object, That neither <i>Aristotle,
 Plato, Hippocrates,</i> or <i>Galen </i>ever attained that prolongation.
 I shall answer, They have not attained the knowledge of many ordinary truths,
 which other ingenious heads have found out; and if so, they may easily
 miscarry in a businesse of such weighty consequence, though they made it
 their study: especially, if we consider, how they were burdened with other
 impertinencies, and so were sooner brought to their gray haires, spending
 the inch of their Candles in more debased and vulgar subjects, than in
 finding out the wayes to so great Secrets. We are not ignorant <i>Aristotle
 </i>sayes
 in his Predicaments, <i>That the Quadrature of a Circle is possible, yet
 not then known,</i> Yea he cofesseth, himself and all his Predecessors
 were ignorant hereof, yet we in our times
 <br> 
 </p><p><b><i>Of obscuring Art and Nature. </i>35</b>
 </p><p>know it. Now if <i>Aristotle</i> did come short in such a trivial, much
 more might he in the deep mysteries of Nature. «E«ven in these
 dayes wise men are ig«norant of many things, which the «most
 ordinary capacity shall under«stand ere long. Thus the Objection
 is of little force.

 in his <i>Secreta Secretarum</i> affirmes, <i>He breaketh the Heavenly
 Seal, who communicateth the Secrets of Nature and Art; the disclosing of
 Secrets and Mysteries, producing many inconveniences.</i> In this case
 <i>Aulus
 Gellius in Noct. Atti. de Collatione Sapientum,</i> sayes, <i>It's but
 folly to profer Lettices to an Asse, since hee's content With his Thistles.
 Et in lib. lapidum, The divulging of Mysteries is the diminution of their
 Majesty, nor indeed continues that to be a Secret, of which the whole fry
 of men is conscious.</i>
 </p><p>    For that which all men, which wise, and the more
 noted men affirme is truth. That therefore which is held by the multitude,
 as a multitude, must be false ; I mean of that multitude, which is distinct
 from knowing men. The multitude, it's true, agree with wise men in the
 more vulgar conceptions of their mind; but when they ascend to the proper
 principles and conclusions of Sciences and Arts, they
 <br> 
 </p><p><b><i>Of obscuring Art and Nature. </i>37</b>
 </p><p>much dissent (striving to get onely the appearancies in Sophismes and
 subtilties which wise men altogether reject.) <font color="#FF0000">{Al.

 of the properties and Secrets, makes the division from knowing men. Though
 the common conception of the mind, have all one Rule and Agreement with
 knowing men. Yet as for common things, they are of small value, nor enquirable
 for themselves, but rather for particular and proper ends.
 </p><p>    The Reason then, why wise men have obscured their
 Mysteries from the multitude, was, because of their deriding and flighting
 wise mens Secrets of wisdome, being also ignorant to make a right use of
 such excellent matters. For if an accident help them to the knowledge of
 a worthy Mystery, they wrest and abuse it to the manifold inconvenience
 of persons and communities. Hee's then not discreet, who writes and Secrets,
 unlesse he conceal it from the vulgar, and make the more intelligent pay
 some labour and sweat before they understand it. In this
 </p><p>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><b>38<i> Of obscuring Art and Nature.</i></b>
 <p>stream the whole fleet of wise men have failed from the beginning of
 all, obscuring many wayes the abstuser parts of wisdome from the capacity
 of the penerality. Some by Characters and Verses have delivered many Secrets.
 Others by ænigmatical and figurative words, as <i>Aristotle</i> sayes,
 <i>(in
 lib. Secret, O Alexander, I shall disclose to you the greatest of Secrets,
 which it becomes you by divine Assistance to keep secret, and perfect the
 thing proposed. Take then then the Stone, which is no Stone, which is in
 every man, and in every place, and in all times; and it shall be called
 the Philosophers Egge, and the </i>Terminus Ovi. And thus we find multitudes
 of things obscured in the Writings and Sciences of men, which no man without
 his Teacher can unvail.
 </p><p>    Thirdly, They have obscured their Secrets by their
 manner of Writing, as by Consonants without Vowels, none knowing how to
 read them, unlesse he know the signification of those words. <font color="#FF0000">{Significata.}
 </font>Thus
 the <i>Hebrews, Caldees, Arabians, </i>nay the <i>major</i> part of men
 do most an end
 <br> 
 </p><p><b><i>Of obscuring Art and Nature. </i>39</b>
 </p><p>write their Secrets, which causeth a great obscurity amongst them, especially
 amongst the <i>Hebrewes.</i> For as <i>Aristotle </i>sayes in his fore-recited
 Book, <i>God gave them all manner of Wisdome long before they were Philosophers:
 And all Nations had their Originals of Philosophy from the Hebrewes, as
 Albumazar in lib. Introductorii Majoris;</i> and other Philoso phers, with
 <i>Josephus
 lib</i>.I. <i>&amp; lib.</i>8. <i>Antiquit.</i> makes it evident.
 </p><p>    Fourthly, This obscuring is occasioned by the mixture
 of several sorts of Letters, for so the <i>Ethnick</i> Astronomer hid his
 knowledge, writing it in <i>Hebrew, Greek </i>and <i>Latine</i> Letters
 altogether. <font color="#FF0000">{Ethicus Astronomus fortasse. N. deest
 ergo Anglice dedi Ethnick.}</font>
 </p><p>    Fifthly, This obscuring was by their inventing other
 letters, then those which were in use in their own, or any other Nation,
 being framed meerly by the pattern of their own fancy, which surely is
 the greatest impediment; yet this was the practice of <i>Artesius in lib.

 is called <i>Ars Notoria, </i>which is the Art of Noting and Writing, with
 what brevity, and in what manner we desire. This way the <i>Latines</i>

 Understand it if you can. For without doubt there will be a composition
 of Elements, and so it will be part of that Stone which is no Stone, which
 is in every man, and in every place of man; and you may find

 the form of a Saffron-cheese, and so viscouous first (as not to be smitten
 asunder by a stroak) <font color="#FF0000">{Al. Insensibile.}</font> divide
 the whole fiery virtue, and separate it by dissolution, and let it be dissolved
 in acute water, of a temperate acutenesse, with a slight fire, and let
 it be boyled till his â€¡ fatnesse, <font color="#FF0000">{â€¡ Al. Terrestreitas.}
 </font>as
 the fatnesse of flesh be separated by distillation, that nothing of the
 unctiousnesse may issue forth; and let this fiery virtue be distilled in
 the water of Urine. Afterwards boil it in Vinegar, until the least part,
 which is the cause of adustion be dried up, and the fiery virtue may be
 had; but if there be no regard of it, â€ again let it be made. <font color="#FF0000">{â€ 
 Al. Tum fac.}</font>  Mind and search what I say: for the speech is
 difficult. The Oyl is dissolved in acute waters, or in common Oil which
 works more expresly, â€  or in acute Oyl of Almonds upon the fire; <font color="#FF0000">{â€

 in the parts of living creatures, Sulphur and Arsnick. For the stones,
 in which the Oyl of humidity overflows, have their
 <br> 
 </p><p><b><i>Philosophers Egge. </i>43</b>
 </p><p><i>terminus</i> in the union of its parts: for there is no vehement
 union, but one may be dissolved from another by the nature of water, which
 is the subject of liquefaction in the spirit, which is the <i>Medium </i>betwixt
 the dry parts and the Oyl. The dissolution being made there will remain
 in the spirit, a pure humidity, vehemently mixed with dry parts, which
 are moved in it, when the fire resolves it, which is sometimes called of
 the Philosophers, <i>Sulphur fusibile,</i> sometimes Oyl, other while an
 aery humour, sometime a conjunctive substance, which the fire separates
 not, sometimes <i>Camphore:</i> and if you please, this is the Philosophers
 Egge, or rather the <i>Terminus</i> and end of the Egge; and it came to
 us from these Oyls, and may be esteemed amongst the subtilities, when it
 is purged and separated from the water and oyl in which it is. Further,
 the Oyl is corrupted by grinding it with deficeating things, as with salt
 or <i>Atrimentum,</i> and by assation, because there is a passion arising
 from the contrary; and afterwards it is to be sublimated, until it be deprived
 of â€  its oleagineity, <font color="#FF0000">{â€  Al. Olio suo.}</font> and
 because its as Sulphur or Arsnick amongst Minerals, it may be prepared,
 even as it is. Yet it's bet-

 <p>ter to boil it in waters, that are temperate in acuity, until it be
 purged and whitened. Which wholsom exaltation is made either in hot or
 moist fire: The distilation must be re-iterated, that it may sufficiently
 receive its goodnesse, until it be rectified, the signs of its last rectification
 are candor and crystalline serenity: And when other things grow black,
 by fire, this grows white, is cleansed, shines with clearnesse and admirable
 splendour. From this water and its earth comes <i>Argentum vivum</i> in
 Minerals, and * when the matter hath waxed white, <font color="#FF0000">{Al.
 Quandoque in salem Aru.oniacum.} </font>this way it is congealed; the Stone
 of <i>Aristotle,</i> which is no Stone, it's set in a Pyramid a hot place,
 or (if you please) in the belly of an Horse or Ox, and it imitateth an
 acute Feavor. For from seven to fourteen, and from that it sometimes proceeds
 to one and twenty, that the Fecis of the Elements may be dissolved in its
 water, before it be separate: The dissolution and distillation is to be
 iterated, until it be rectified. And here is the end of this intention.
 Yet know that when you have consummated your work, you are then to begin.
 <br> 
 </p><p><b><i>Philosophers Egge. </i>45</b>
 </p><p>    Another Secret I shall shew you, you must prepare
 <i>Argentum
 vivum </i>by mortifying it with the vapour of Tin for Pearls, and with
 the vapour of Lead for the Stone <i>Iberus; </i>then let it be ground with
 desiccating things, and <i>Attramentis,</i> and the like, as is said, and
 let there be an assation: Then let there be a sublimation * if for Pearles
 twelve times; <font color="#FF0000">{* Al. Septies.}</font>  if for
 rednesse one and twenty times, until the humidity within it be totally
 corrupted. Nor is it possible, that its humidity be separated by vapour,
 as the fore-said oyl; because its vehemently mixed with its dry parts;
 nor doth it constitute,as in the foresaid metals. In this Chapter you may
 be deceived, unlesse you distinguish of the signification of the words.
 It's now high time I involve the third Chapter: that you acquire the Calx,
 the * Calx of the body, <font color="#FF0000">{* Al. Clavem operis.} </font>which
 you intend, the body is calcined, when it is appodiated,<i> i.e.</i> that
 the humour in it may be corrupted by salt, and with salt Armoniack and
 vinegar, and sometimes with burning things, and with Sulphur and Arsnick:
 and sometimes bodies are fed with <i>Argentum vivum,</i> and sublimated

 <p>them, until they remain putred. The claves of the Art are congelation,
 resolution, inceration, proportion; and another way purification, distillation,
 separation, calcination and fixation, and then you may acquiesce. <font color="#FF0000">{*

 <p><b><font size="+3">I</font></b>N the 602. <i>Arabian</i> year you intreated
 me for some Secrets. Take then the Stone, and calcine it with a light assation
 and strong contrition, or with acute things. But in the end mingle it a
 little with sweet water, and compound a Laxative Medicine of seven things
 (if you will) or of six, or of five, or as many as you please; but my mind
 rests in two things, whose proportion is better than the other fixt proportion,
 or thereabouts, as experi-
 <br>

 </p><p>ence will teach you. Resolve notwithstanding the gold at the fire, and
 tried it better; <font color="#FF0000">{Al. Mollius caleseant.} </font>but
 if you will credit me, take one thing that is the Secret of Secrets of
 Nature, able to do Miracles. Let it be mixed from two or more, or a Phoenix,
 which is a singular creature â€  at the fire, <font color="#FF0000">{â€  Al.
 Adjunge.} </font>and incorporate by a strong motion: to which if hot liquor
 four or five times be applied, you have the composition. Yet afterwards
 the coelestial nature is deliberated, if you infuse hot water three or
 four times. Divide therefore the week from the strong in several vessels,
 if you believe me: Let that which is good be evacuated. Again, use the
 pouder, and the water which remains, carefully expresse: For of a certain,
 it will produce the parts of the pouder, not incorporated : therefore take
 the water by it self; because the pouder exiccated from it hath power to
 be incorporated into the Laxative Medicine. Work therefore as formerly,
 until you distinguish the strong from the weak, and apply the pouder three,
 four, five times or oftener, and
 </p><p>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><b>48<i> How to make the</i></b>
 <p>work alwayes the way: And if you cannot work with with hot waters, do
 it with water of <i>Alkali,</i> and by such acute things you make the violence
 of the Medicine. But if by reason of the acuity and softnesse of the Medicine
 it be broken, the pouder, being applied, apply very carefully more of the
 hard and soft. But if it be by reason of the abundance of the pouder apply
 more of the Medicine; if it be by reason of the strength of the water,
 water it with pistils; <font color="#FF0000">{Pistillo.}</font> and congregate
 the matter, as you can, and separate the water by little and little, and
 it will return to its state, which water you must exiccate: for it contains
 both pouder and water of the Medicine, which are to be incorporated, as
 the principle pouder. Here you may not sleep, because here is contained
 a very great and profitable Secret. If you rightly order in a right series
 of things, the parts of the Shrub or Willow, they will keep natural union
 : and do not deliver this to oblivion, for it is profitable for many things.
 You must mingle Pearls with the made union: <font color="#FF0000">{Unione
 facta.} </font>as I think there will arise some
 <br> 
 </p><p><b><i>Philosophers Egge. </i>49</b>
 </p><p>thing like the Stone <i>Iberus:</i> and without doubt it mortifies that
 which is to be mortified by the vapour of Lead. You shall find Lead, if
 you expresse the living from the dead; and the dead you must bury in <i>Olibanum</i>
 and <i>Sarcocolla.</i> Keep this Secret, for it is of some profit, and
 so must you do with the vapour of Pearls, and the Stone <i>Tagus,</i> and
 you must (as I have said) bury the dead.

 630. I return this Answer. You must have the Medicine which may be dissolved
 in the thing liquified and steeped in it, and penetrate its interiour parts,
 and may be mingled with it;and it may not be a fugitive servant,but transmute
 it. Let it be mingled by reason of the spirit, and let it be fixed by the
 Calx of the metal; it is to be thought that fixion is prepared, when the

 <p>body and spirit are set in its place, and the spirit is made a body.
 Take then of the bones of <i>Adam,</i> and of the Calx the same weight;
 let there be six to the Stone <i>Tagi, </i>and five to the stone of Pearl;
 let them be ground with <i>Aqua vitae,</i> whose property it is to dissolve
 all other things, so as in it they are dissolved and assated, until it
 be incerate, <i>i.e.</i> let the parts be united, as the parts in wax.
 The sign of inceration is, that the Medicine liquifies upon iron very hot.
 Then let it be put in the same water in some hot and moist place, or let
 it hang in the vapour of waters made very hot: after that dissolve and
 congeal them against the Sunne, Afterwards take Saltpeter, and <i>argentum
 vivum</i> shall be converted into lead : And again, wash the lead with
 it, and mundifie it, that it may be the next to silver, and then work as
 a pious man, and also the whole weight must be 30. But yet of Saltpeter
 <i>L
 U R UV O P O Vir Can Utriet Sulphuris :</i> and so you may make Thunder
 and Lightning, if you understand the Artifice : but you must observe, whether
 I speak ænigmatically, or according to the truth. Some men have supposed
 otherwise: For it is told me, that you must resolve all into its
 <br> 
 </p><p><b><i>Philosophers Egge. </i>51</b>
 </p><p>first matter, of which you have <i>Aristotle </i>speaking in vulgar
 and known places, which makes me silent herein. When you have this, you
 have pure, simple and equal Elements. And this you may do by contrary thing
 and various operations, which formerly I have called the Claves of the
 Art. And <i>Aristotle</i> sayes, <i>That the equality of potencies excludes
 action, and passion, and corruption.</i> And these things <i>Averrho's
 </i>affirms,
 reproving <i>Galen.</i> And this Medicine is esteemed the more pure and
 simple which may be found, which is prevalent against Feavers, passions
 of the mind and body. Farewell.<i> Whoever unlocks these,hath a key which
 opens and no man shutts: and when he hath shut no man opens.</i>
