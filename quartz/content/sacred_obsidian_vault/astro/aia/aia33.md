   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXX.</h3>  <h3 align="center">THE SEVENTH HOUSE, AND ITS QUESTIONS.</h3>  
 <p><i>This House signifies Marriage, Love Questions, Lawsuits and Controversies, Contracts, Wars, Duels, open Enemies, Bar-gains, Thefts, Fugitives, and all matters regarding Strangers</i>.</p>  
 <p>THE questions to be judged by this house being more difficult than those of any other house, I have been more lengthy in delivering the opinions of the ancients as well as moderns thereon; and have written several aphorisms concerning its questions.</p>  <h4 align="center">APHORISMS AND CONSIDERATIONS</h4>  
 <p align="center"><font size="-1">FOR THE BETTER JUDGING ANY HORARY QUESTION, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE 7TH HOUSE.</font></p>  
 <p>1. See the question be radical and fit to be judged.</p>  
 <p>2. Be not confident of the judgment if either the first or</p>  
 <p><a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 187</font></a></p>  
 <p>last degrees of a sign ascend. If few degrees ascend, the matter is not yet ripe for judgment: if the latter degrees, the matter of the question is elapsed, or the querent has been tampering with other artists, or despairs of success. Meddle not with it at that time.</p>  
 <p>3. If ♄, ♂, or ☋ be in the 10th house unfortunate, it will end in the discredit of the artist.</p>  
 <p>4. Judge not upon every trivial motion or light question, or when the querent has not wit to know what he would demand.</p>  
 <p>5. Observe well the strength and condition of ☽; for it is far better that the lord of the ascendant be unfortunate than the ☽.</p>  
 <p>6. The evil planets shew tardiness and difficulty in every question, unless ☽ and they receive each other in the signification.</p>  
 <p>7. The benefits, ♃ and ♀, never import evil but when ruling evil houses; and if they be significators without reception, even then they put forward the matter.</p>  
 <p>8. If ☽ be void of course, there is no great hope of the question, unless she be in ♋, ♉, ♐, or ♓.</p>  
 <p>9. Observe from what planet ☽ last separated; for it will shew what has already happened: if from a fortune, good; but from a malefic, evil; according to the nature of the house the planet rules and is in.</p>  
 <p>10. The application of ☽ shews the present condition of the matter, and what may be expected. If ☽ apply to a planet in his fall, it denotes trouble and delays.</p>  
 <p>11. If evil planets promise good, it will be imperfect or less than is expected, and come with much effort; and if they foreshew evil, it will be greater than may be feared.</p>  
 <p>12. If malefics threaten evil, observe whether ☉, ♃, or ☿</p>  
 <p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 188</font></a></p>  
 <p>cast any good aspect to them, for then the evil will be mitigated.</p>  
 <p>13. If the fortunes promise good, but are weak, or behold not the ascendant, they perform but little without reception.</p>  
 <p>14. A planet peregrine, viz. having no essential dignities at all, is very malicious.</p>  
 <p>15. Confide not too much in a fortune, unless he be in his essential dignities.</p>  
 <p>16. In a figure where both fortunes and infortunes are equally weak and ill placed, venture not a judgment, but defer the party for another time.</p>  
 <p>17. In all questions where the significator of the thing is combust, or in ☍ to ☉, he can bring nothing to perfection.</p>  
 <p>18. If one infortune be joined to another, the good they promise will come to nothing; but the evil they threaten will be more violent.</p>  
 <p>19. The lord of the ascendant out of his dignities, cadent, &amp;c., shews the querent out of all hopes in the business.</p>  
 <p>20. A planet under the beams of ☉, (viz. within 12 degrees), has no fortitude; <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">1</font></a> if within <i>sixteen minutes</i> of ☉, he is in cazimi or heart of ☉, and then he is very strong.</p>  
 <p>21. If the dispositor of the significator be <i>oriental</i>, and he either ♄, ♃, or ♂, the matter is sooner performed; but if ♀ or ☿, later: the reverse, if they be <i>occidental</i>.</p>  
 <p>22. If the significator of the thing desired be in a <i>fixed</i> sign, it denotes stability, and that the thing shall continue, whether it be begun or is to be begun; if he be in <i>common</i> signs, it shews the probability of the matter,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 189</font></a></p>  
 <p>but not its conclusion; and if in <i>moveable</i> signs, a sudden resolution or concluding the matter one way or other. Hence we begin the foundations of buildings when the significators are fixed; short journeys when moveable; but things wherein a mediocrity is desirable, when they are in moveable signs.</p>  
 <p>23. The ☽ or lord of the ascendant, with ☋, brings damage, according to the house they are in. The ☊ is in like manner beneficial.</p>  
 <p>24. If in any question you find ☽ afflicted, there is seldom any good comes of the matter.</p>  
 <p>25. If ☽ or lord of the ascendant be in their fall, the querent despairs of the matter, nor does he much care whether it be performed or not.</p>  
 <p>26. Consider diligently the planet afflicting the significator of the thing demanded, and what house he is lord of, and where placed; from the nature of those houses require the cause obstructing.</p>  
 <p>27. The most powerful affliction to the ☽ is when she is combust, and if she applies to ☉ it is the worst.</p>  
 <p>28. If an infortune aspect your significator, and they be both peregrine or retrograde, you may judge that the mischief threatened is almost inevitable.</p>  
 <p>29. Take especial notice whether any frustration or prohibition be before the perfect aspect of the significators; the planet which frustrates hinders the thing demanded.</p>  
 <p>30. In all questions of gain, look well to ⊕: the querent will get by persons or things connected with the house it is in; but if it be afflicted, he loses in the same way.</p>  
 <p>31. In questions of marriage, an evil planet in the 7th shews ill agreement in the married state.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 190</font></a></p>  
 <p>32. If the lord of the 8th be unfortunate in the 8th, the querent will suffer by the death of some female; or, concerning debts due to him, by dead men.</p>  
 <p>33. In what house you find ♃ or ♀ well dignified, expect benefits by men or things signified by that house; as if in the 3d, by kindred; in the 4th, by your father or lands, &amp;c.; in the 5th, by play, pleasure, &amp;c.; and so of the others. And beware of slander or damage through that house where ☋ falls.</p>  <h4 align="center">QUESTIONS CONCERNING MARRIAGE.</h4>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether a Man shall Marry</i>?</p>  
 <p>If a man ask this question, let the lord of the ascendant, ☽, and ♀, also planets in the ascendant, be his significators. Then if ☽ aspect favourably ☉, ♀, or lord of the 7th, or the lord of the 1st aspect the lord of the 7th, or be in the 7th, or the lord of the 7th be in the ascendant, or if most of these significators be in fruitful signs, or disposed of by ♀, the man shall marry.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether a Woman shall Marry</i>?</p>  
 <p>Follow the same rules as above, but, instead of ☽ and ♀, substitute ☉ and ♂. If ♂ have no aspect or familiarity with ☉, it is a strong testimony of the negative.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The Time of Marriage</i>.</p>  
 <p>The degree of the application of ☽ to ☉ or ♀, or of ☉ to ♂, or the lords of the 1st and 7th to good aspect, or to ☐ or ☍, if with strong mutual reception, or of the lord of the ascendant to the cusp of the ascendant, or the lord of the 7th to the cusp of the ascendant, must be noticed. And</p>  
 <p><a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 191</font></a></p>  
 <p>if the significators be swift, and the testimonies of marriage strong and numerous, moveable signs give days, weeks, or months, as the applying planet be angular, succeedent, or cadent; and common signs, in like way, give weeks, months, or years; and fixed signs give, in like manner, months or years.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of Marriage with any particular Person who may be desired</i>.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the ascendant or ☽ (or if the querent be a woman, the ☉) be joined to the lord of the 7th in any of his dignities in the ascendant, 10th, or 11th, the querent shall obtain the party desired.</p>  
 <p>If both significators behold each other by ✶ or △ out of the ascendant and 11th, or out of the 7th and 9th, or 7th and 5th, and no frustration or retrogradation of the chief significators happen before the good aspect be completed, the match will be perfected, if the <i>querent</i> please. For we always suppose a FREEDOM OF WILL to do or not to do. And if there be a ☐ or ☍ between the significators, without reception, the matter will come to nothing.</p>  
 <p>A ☐ aspect with reception will perfect the matter, but with some difficulty. If no reception be, there may be hopes, but no grounds to judge favourably.</p>  
 <p>When the lord of the ascendant is in the 7th, the querent loves best; and when the lord of the 7th is in the ascendant, the quesited loves best.</p>  
 <p>The match may be brought about, though there be no aspect between the significators, if there be any good translation of light; more especially if the planet who translates be a fortune, or be not retrograde, combust, or unfortunate, or afflicted by ♄ or ♂. The person signified may be known by the description of the planet, according to the sign he is in, and the way he is aspected; and the quality of the person,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 192</font></a></p>  
 <p>from the house he is lord of. A masculine diurnal planet shews a man, and a feminine nocturnal planet a female, or an effeminate man, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Testimonies that the Marriage shall be hindered</i>.</p>  
 <p>Observe the planet who receives the light of the significators. If he be a heavy planet, and have the ☐ or ☍ of a malefic, or be cadent, the intended match shall be broken off, though at present never so feasible.</p>  
 <p>Remark which party's significator is strongest; that party shall first marry after this dissolution.</p>  
 <p>If the significators apply by an evil aspect without reception, or if there be no good aspect between the luminaries, there will be no marriage; unless the lords of the ascendant and 7th be placed in each other's houses, and the other signs be very decided for the match.</p>  
 <p>If the evil ♄ be in the ascendant, he renders the querent cool, and but little inclined to marriage; unless he be very strong or well aspected. If he be in the 7th, he has the same effect on the quesited. He is generally an enemy to marriage, whereas ♀ assists marriage, and inclines the parties thereto.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>What shall be the Cause of the Marriage being prevented</i>?</p>  
 <p>Consider the evil planet who intercepts his rays between the significators, and hinders the marriage; and observe what house he is lord of, and where he is situated. If he be lord of the 2d, want of money will be objected to the querent, or he may fear to marry from lack of means.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 3d denotes that it will be caused by the querent's kindred or neighbours, or by means of some short journey.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 4th shews that his father will not agree,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 193</font></a></p>  
 <p>or it may (especially if a feminine planet) be the mother of the quesited; or it may be for want of some settlement of houses or lands, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 5th causes obstacles by means of children, or by the querent having a character for loose living, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>The 6th denotes sickness in the querent, or opposition by some relation of his father, or by means of servants, or some private enemy of the quesited.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 7th, or a planet therein, denotes a public enemy of the querent, or a lawsuit, or a rival.</p>  
 <p>The 8th denotes a lack of money on the part of the quesited; or, if other testimonies concur, it may be that the querent's death may intervene to prevent the match.</p>  
 <p>The 9th, in like manner, shews opposition by the relations of the quesited, or the interference of some lawyer or priest, or that the querent may go a long journey or voyage, and so the match be hindered.</p>  
 <p>The 10th and its lord shew the father of the quesited, or the mother of the querent, or some person having authority over the querent.</p>  
 <p>If it be the 11th house or its lord, then the friends of both parties dislike the match; or those who first introduced the parties, or endeavoured to bring it about, will now try to dissolve the connexion.</p>  
 <p>If it be by the lord of the 12th, or by a planet therein, there is some under-hand dealing or secret enmity to the querent. The affair shall be much retarded; but the querent shall never know by whom; or some private scandal will do much wrong, and quite break off the matter.</p>  
 <p>In the same manner that you may thus learn who will oppose the querent, you may ascertain who will assist him in his desires. And by varying the houses, you may know the persons who will aid or hinder the quesited.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 194</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>To describe the Person and Qualities of the future Wife or Husband</i>.</p>  
 <p>For the man, observe the planet the ☽ is nearest in aspect with and <i>applying</i>; as if with ♀, say she is fair, slender, and pleasant. And according as that planet is found in any of the twelve signs, describe her person; and as it is aspected and dignified, her qualities; observing also the sign on the 7th house. And if there be any planets in the 7th, take that planet nearest the cusp; unless ☽ aspect a planet there, then take that planet. For a woman, judge by the planet ☉ applies to, in like manner; as if ☉ be in ✶ or △ to ♄, he is grave and laborious; if ♃, honest; if ♂, violent; if ♀, fond of pleasure and agreeable; if ☿ active and industrious; and if ♅, strange and eccentric. If ☉ and ☽ are applying to ☐ or ☍, there will be contention and discord.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether the future Wife or Husband shall be rich or not</i>?</p>  
 <p>Observe the lord of the 8th and planets therein. If ☽ apply by good aspect to the lord of the 8th, or good planets be there, or the lord of the 8th have a good aspect to the querent's ⊕, or other significators of property, the future wife or husband will be rich. If evil planets be in the 8th, or its lord afflict the ☽ or ⊕, the querent will gain little by marriage. And if ♄ and ♂ be both in the 8th, he gains nothing; and though the party may have property, the querent will be cheated of it, or lose it in some manner. The persons or means by which the property will be injured, may be discovered by observing what houses the afflicting planets are lords of for the persons, and what houses they are placed in for the means; as ☿, lord of the 8th, being in the 9th, and throwing a ☐ to ⊕, might denote a lawsuit respecting the future wife or husband's property.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 195</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether the Marriage be legitimate or not</i>?</p>  
 <p>If the significators of either party be afflicted by ♄ or ♂, or joined to ☋, it denotes some dispute about the marriage; and if other testimonies agree, a lawsuit may be the consequence.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>How the Parties shall agree after Marriage</i>?</p>  
 <p>If the figure promise marriage, observe whether the lords of the ascendant and 7th are in good aspect; or if the ☽ behold with good aspect the planet disposing of her by house or exaltation, and the luminaries be in good aspect, they will agree.</p>  
 <p>If the lords of the ascendant and 7th be in ☐ or ☍, or the ☽ be afflicted, and behold the ascendant by ill aspect, or ♄, or ♂, or ☋, be in the ascendant, or 7th, they will live unhappily. If the ill planets, or ☋, be in the 1st, the querent is to blame; and if it be ♂, is given to quarrel, or be loose in conduct, according to the sign; and if they be in the 7th, it is the quesited. And judge the same way according as the significator of the 1st or 7th be afflicted. The ☽ in her fall, or ☐ or ☍ of ♄ or ♂, or any retrograde planet, and at the same time throwing any aspect to the ascendant, it is the man who brings on disputes, &amp;c. If the ☉ do the same, under the same circumstances, it is the woman.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 7th angular, and the more weighty planet, the quesited will strive for mastery; and if neither the lord of the ascendant nor 7th be in angles, then note the weightier planet, for he points out the party who will rule. If ♀ be afflicted, it is worse for the man; and if ☉, for the woman. The ☽ afflicted, is evil for both. The lights in evil aspects spew discord.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 196</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The Cause of Contention</i>.</p>  
 <p>if the afflicting planet be lord of the 3d, and be in the 1st or 7th, he denotes quarrels, or injuries by neighbours or kindred. If it be an <i>infortune</i> who afflicts, and he be in the 10th, it shews continual brawls. If he be in the 4th, a divorce or willingness thereto; or some hindrance in the dowry or fortune of the female. Evil planets in the 10th or 4th lead also to contention by means of the parents of the parties. If ☽ behold the ascendant, and be unfortunate, it denotes brawling, separation, or dishonest living. And if there be no application between the planet the ☽ separates from and that one to which she applies, there will be continual contention. If ☽ aspect evilly, or be in ☌ with ♄ or ♂, one of them shall die shortly, or have some misfortune; if in the 8th or 12th, (and she void of course), they meet troubles, grief, and sickness; and if in angles, long disagreements; and probably separation, if in a fixed sign. If this be in the 10th, and a masculine sign, the man is the chief sufferer; if in the 4th, and It feminine sign, the woman.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The Cause of Happiness</i>.</p>  
 <p>The ☽ in ✶ or △ of good planets, shews gifts or benefits by friends; if in ☐, by the dead. If ☽ be in ☌ with good planets, by their own conduct or industry.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Arabic Aphorisms not to be trusted to, unless the other Testimonies concur</i>.</p>  
 <p>The woman who departs from or loses her husband when ☽ is in the last 13° of ♐, shall never return or marry.</p>  
 <p>The man who shall engage to marry when ☽ is in the first 12° of ♑, shall lose his betrothed before marriage, or die within six months, or live in discord with her.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 197</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>From what Part a Person shall Marry</i>?</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 7th be in the 9th, the querent shall marry a stranger. If the lords of the 1st and 7th be in one quarter of heaven, or in one house or sign, the person will marry one near to their own residence. Consider the sign of the 7th, the sign and quarter of heaven the lord of the 7th is in; and judge by the majority of testimonies from what direction the querent shall marry; as if most of the testimonies be southern, the south, &amp;c. Mix the sign and the quarter of heaven, preferring the former.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Which of the two shall be most honourable in Connexions, &amp;c</i>.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the ascendant be angular, and the lord of the 7th succeedent, the querent is best connected, and <i>vice versâ</i>. In like manner you may judge of any two individuals. A more assured way is, by observing which of the two significators is the most powerful in dignities. You may combine the two systems.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether a Lady have a Lover besides the Querent</i>?</p>  
 <p>If there be any planet in the 7th, (if it be not lord of the 7th), she has one of the description of that planet. The lord of the 7th, or ☉ joined to ♂, she has a lover with whom she is familiar; but, (unless other and very evil testimonies accord), not improperly. The lord of the 7th void of course, or with ☊, or if no planet be in the 7th, judge that she has none: and if the lord of the 7th aspect only the lord of the ascendant, judge the same.</p>  
 <p>If either the lord of the 7th, or the ☉ be joined to the lord of the triplicity then ascending, and ☉ separate from the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 198</font></a></p>  
 <p>lord of the ascendant, it seems that she has some friend that she loves besides the querent.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 7th, or the ☉, or both, separating from any other planet but the lord of the ascendant, and he not separated above three degrees, the lady did love another, but she has now left him. If the lord of the 7th be with ☊, she is blameless; unless there be another planet in ☌ with them, and then she is not. And if it be ☋, she is faulty in her desires and affections; and if evil testimonies concur, such as aspects of ♂, or the ☌ be in ♏, it may be feared in acts also.</p>  
 <p>If the ☉, or lord of the 7th, be in ☌ with ♂, and ☊ be there, she loves a martial man, yet he cannot prevail on her entirely. If ☋ be there, she is sore pressed to comply. If they be near, or within very few degrees, the gentleman resides near her house; and if in the same degree, he is in the house, if it be a fixed sign; or frequently visits the house, if it be a moveable or common sign.</p>  
 <p>If ☉, or lord of the 7th, separate from ♂, she had formerly a lover, but now they have forsaken each other. If ☉ be lord of the 7th, and be in ☌ with ♂ or ♃ in any sign whatever, the lady has loved or does love a person described by ♂ or ♃; and he has rank as an officer, gentleman, or clergyman. And if there be mutual reception, they still love one another, and many acts of kindness pass between them.</p>  
 <p>If the ☉ or lord of the 7th be joined to ☿, the lover is a young clerk or merchant; lawyer or writer; a witty, nimble fellow. His age may be judged by the number of degrees is in the sign.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 7th be joined to ♀ with reception, (and it be a female who is inquired of,) then she cares little for the men; but is fond of female society, is rather free in her language, but not naturally vicious. If it be a male who is the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 199</font></a></p>  
 <p>quesited, he is found much in female company, and is partial to such an one as ♀ may describe, according to the sign she is in. If the aspect be ✶ or △ and with mutual reception, the lady is partial to him; but if the ☽ or lord of the 7th dispose not of ♀, she cares not for him, unless the aspect be very close and in angles. And if the aspect be evil, there is no mutual regard, without there be very strong reception.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 7th joined to ♄, she loves, (or did love if they separate), an elderly person, or farmer, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 7th joined to ☉, she loves some person of consequence, according to her rank in life; and if with mutual reception, he may do what he please with her. If they separate, or there be no reception, the feeling is passed away or was never mutual.</p>  
 <p>If other planets aspect ☉ and the lord of the 7th, especially ♄ or ☿, she has other admirers, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 7th aspect ☽, or the ☽ be in the 7th, especially if they be then in aspect, or ♂ be in aspect with ☽, she is given to change and acts discreditably, yielding up her affections upon slight solicitation.</p>  
 <p>Generally, you may consider that if ♂ be in the 7th, unless he be in his own house, the lady has a lover. If ♄ she loves one, but there is no familiarity between them; if ♃ be there, she is honest; if ♀, she is giddy and merry, and is thought to be wanton, but is not; if ☿, she had a friend, hut has not now; and if ☽, she has not yet, but will have more than one. If ☉ or ☊ be there, she is virtuous and honourable, and has no lover other than the querent. ☋ denotes discreditable desires at least.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether a Gentleman have a Lover besides the Querent</i>?</p>  
 <p>You may judge this question exactly by the rules for judging of a lady, if you substitute the ☽ for the ☉ and ♀ for</p>  
 <p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 200</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> ♂. You may in like way judge of <i>friends</i> by taking the 11th for the 7th.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether a Damsel be virtuous or not</i>?</p>  
 <p>Behold the lord of the 7th, the cusp of the 7th, and the ☉; and if they be in fixed signs and well aspected, you may judge that she is correct. If ♂ be in ♌ and ♏ descend, she is suspected, but yet is honest. If ♏ descend and ♂ therein, it is suspicious; and if there be a moveable sign on the 7th, or the ☉ and ♂ be in common or moveable signs, and be ill aspected; and if ♂ and ♀ be in ill aspect, or the ☉ or ☽ behold d, and the evil stars aspect them from fixed signs, there is great reason to doubt. Yet if there be <i>any good aspect</i> to either the 7th or its lord, ♂, or ☉, it is not safe to judge the lady to be unchaste, though she may have been much tempted. The student will do well to avoid a positive judgment <i>unfavourable</i> on this head, unless <i>all</i> the testimonies are decided.</p>  
 <p>If there be great reason to doubt, then observe whether ☽ be in the last face of ♊, or in a moveable sign, and in the 5th house, and the lord of the 5th in the ascendant or 7th, and in a moveable sign, and either of them in aspect to ♂; or the lords of the 5th and 7th in ☌ in one sign. If all these, or nearly all, concur, you may be more confident that the lady is faulty.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether the Child conceived is the Child of him who is the reputed Father</i>?</p>  
 <p>Observe the lord of the ascendant, and the ☽, who signify the querent; then observe the sign of the 11th, and its lord, which signify the issue in conception. If these significators behold one another by ✶ or △, with reception or not, the conception is legitimate, viz., the child of its supposed father.</p>

But if none of these things be, and ♄, ♂, or ☿ behold the 5th or lord thereof, there may be just suspicion that the child is conceived in adultery, or is not the child of the querent.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether a Woman living from her Husband shall ever return to him, or be restored to Favour</i>?</p>  
 <p>This question will equally resolve a doubt concerning a mistress or <i>person beloved</i>.</p>  
 <p>If the woman herself propose the question, consider the lord of the 7th, (for the 7th is ever given to the banished or expelled party;) and if the lord of the 7th behold the ascendant with a perfect aspect, and the lord of the ascendant be hold the 7th, or its lord, without doubt she shall again come into favour. If the lord of the 7th do not behold the ascendant, bat another planet, who is not afflicted, behold the ascendant, the woman shall be received again through some person who shall interpose his friendship with the husband or friend. If none of these things be, observe ☽ and ♂; and if ☽ be above the earth, and ♂ behold the ascendant with ✶ or △, she shall return quietly, and without much trouble.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be under the earth and ♂ above, and behold the ascendant with ✶ or △, she shall return, but with trouble and delays, and with much publicity. If ☽ aspect the ascendant favourably, and be not afflicted, she shall return, but with solicitation. If ☽ decrease in light, but be not near the beams of ☉, and behold the ascendant, she will return easily and speedily.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 202</font></a></p>  
 <p>If ♂ be retrograde, and hasten to aspect with ☽, she will of her own accord return; but if ♂ and ☽, or the lords of the 1st and 7th, separate from good aspect, they have no mutual desire to return, nor will the lady much respect the gentleman for the future.</p>  <h4 align="center">OF RUNAWAY SERVANTS, CATTLE STRAYED, AND THINGS LOST.</h4>  
 <p>The significator of the thing missing is the ☽; wherefore if you find ☽ applying to the lord of the ascendant, or to the lord of the 12th, (being herself in the ascendant,) or to the lord of the house of the ☽, the thing missing shall be found again. But if ☽ apply to none of these, nor be in the ascendant or 2d, the thing lost shall not be found. <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">1</font></a> If the lord of the house of ☽ be in the 3d, or in ✶ to the ascendant, there is some hope of finding the thing again during that aspect with the degree ascending. Also, if he separate from the lord of the 6th, 8th, or 12th, and apply by any aspect to the cusp of the 2d, or behold the ☽, you may hope to find it. But if there be contrary indications between these, judge the reverse.</p>  
 <p>If the ☽ be aspected well by both fortunes, the thing lost is in the hands of some trusty person; and if ☽ or one of the fortunes behold the ascendant, he will restore it to the owner.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The Place where the Thing lost is</i>.</p>  
 <p>This is shewn by ☽, according to the sign she is in; for if the sign be eastern, it is east; and if west, it is western, &amp;c. Observe also the place of ☽ in the figure; for if she be in the ascendant, it is east, &amp;c., but prefer the sign. If the lord of the house of ☽ be in human signs, (♊, ♍, ♒, or the first</p>

 <p>half of ♐), it is in a place where men frequent. If in signs of small cattle, as ♈ or ♑, it is where they are found. If ☽ be in a fiery sign, it is where fire is; if in a watery sign, where water is, &amp;c. If ☽ be in the same quarter as the Lord of the ascendant, and there be not more than 30° between them, the thing lost is in the house of the owner, or about it; if they be above 30° and less than 70° apart, it is in the town where he resides; but if they be not in one quarter, it is far from the owner.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>How the Thing was lost</i>.</p>  
 <p>Observe from what planet the lord of the ascendant last separated. If from ♄, it was through forgetfulness of the owner; or through cold or illness which afflicted the loser, especially if ♄ be retrograde. If from ♃, it was through some abstinence, or ordering of laws, or by excess of care in managing affairs, or putting too much trust in the person by whom it was carried away or mislaid. If from ♂, or the lord of the ascendant be in the house of ♂, it was lost through fear or some sudden passion, provoking the loser to anger; or by fire, or by enmity, or upon some quarrel. If from ☉, by means of the king or some gentleman, or the master of the family, or by hunting or pastime. If from ♀, or in her house, by drinking, cards, &amp;c., or making merry in a tavern, &amp;c., or by singing or dallying with women. If from ☿, by writing, letters, messages, or going a message, &amp;c. If from ☽, by too frequent use, or chewing the thing lost, or making it too common; or some messenger, widow, or servant lost the same.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>If it be an Animal, and you would know whether it be stolen or not</i>?</p>

 <p>planet, say that it went away of its own accord. If that lord be not separating, but another planet be separating from him, say that some person took it away. If the lord of the house of ☽ be in neither of these cases, look to the lord of the 2d house, and judge by him in the same way. And if you find no separation of either of these two lords, say that the animal <a href="errata.htm#2">is</a> still in or near its place, and is not gone away.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether it be dead</i>?</p>  
 <p>Observe the ☽; and if you find her in application to the lord of the 8th house from her, say it is dead. But if you find no such testimony, observe her dispositor; and if you find him applying to the lord of the 8th house from the Moon, say likewise that it is dead, or will shortly die; but if in neither of these you find application, take the lord of the 8th house of the figure in the same way; and if neither ☽ nor her dispositor apply to it, then the animal is not dead.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether the Thing missing be stolen</i>?</p>  
 <p>If the significator of the thief, (usually the lord of the 7th, unless there be any peregrine planet in an angle), be found in the ascendant, or disposing of the ☽, or ☽ disposing of him, or the lord of the ascendant be disposed of by him or dispose of him, or unless he apply to the ☽ or lord of the 1st or 2d, or ⊕, or its lord by ☌, ☐, or ☍, or some planet be in the ascendant, and be in ☐ or ☍ to the significator of the thief, the thing is <i>not</i> stolen. Generally any ill aspect of any evil planet, or the lord of the 7th to the ascendant or 2d house or their lords, or ☽ or ⊕, or their lords, denote that the thing is stolen.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether a Thing lost shall be found</i>?</p>

 <p>dispositor, it shall be found. ☽ in the ascendant, or her dispositor in ✶ or △ thereto, give hopes; the dispositor of ☽ separating from the lord of the 6th, 8th, or 12th, and applying to the lord of the ascendant or cusp of the 2d, give hopes also; and if ☽ be in aspect to her dispositor, it is good. But ☽ afflicted by the lords of the 6th, 8th, or 12th, it is in the hands of an evil person, who will not part with it; especially if an infortune afflict the ascendant or its lord. ☽ in △ to the ascendant, its lord or ☉, or in the ascendant, or ☉ there, unless in ♎ or ♒, it shall be found.</p>

 <p>If ☽ be in a human sign, <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">1</font></a> it is in a place where men frequent; and if in a brutal sign (♈, ♉, ♌, ♑, and the last half of ♐), the thing is where animals frequent. If ☽ be in fiery signs, it is where fire is or has been, or near a fire, or on hills or high ground; if in watery signs, where water is or has been; <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">2</font></a> if in airy signs, where many windows are, or open places, garrets, &amp;c.; if in earthy signs, in an earthy place, where houses are built of mud, clay, &amp;c., and in brickfields. The ☽, or her dispositor, in a moveable sign, shews a place newly peopled, or a house newly built, or where there are hills and dales: if in a fixed sign, in a level plain country; if in a common sign, in a place of much water, according to the nature of the thing missing. Also ♊, ♍, ♐, ♓, shew, if it be not living things, within the house; but if cattle, &amp;c., they shew ditches, pits, and among rushes, or in a marketplace.</p>

 <p align="center"><i>Of Animals missing</i>.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 6th be in the 6th, they are small animals; if the lord of the 12th be in the 12th, they are large.

If ☽ be in common signs, they are in rushy grounds; if in an angle, they are in enclosed ground; if in a succeedent, they are near enclosures; if in a cadent house, they are on commons.

 <p align="center"><i>Whether it shall be restored</i>?</p>  
 <p>The ☽ aspecting ♃ or ♀, it is in the hands of an honest man, who will restore it. If ♃ or ♀ have any aspect to the ascendant, or ☽ apply to the ascendant, it will be restored; and if ☽ be in the ascendant, it is restored without trouble or pain. The lord of the 7th, or 12th in the 12th house, the fugitive is imprisoned.</p>  
 <p>If the ☽ be within 30° of the lord of the 1st, the thing is with or near the loser; if ☽ be more than 30° off the lord or the 1st, it is far off.</p>  
 <p>If it be animals, and the lord of the 6th, (or if large cattle the 12th,) be fortunate by the good aspects of ♀ or ♃, or they be found in the 2d, 5th, or 11th, the animals will be had again.

 <p>The lord of the 7th aspecting an infortune from the 7th, the querent will discover the quesited with some person, to whom he must give money before he can have him back. If the lord of the 7th be retrograde, it is a testimony of his return.</p>  <h4 align="center">OF THEFTS.</h4>  
 <p>The ascendant is for the querent, and its lord for him that has lost the goods; and it signifies the place from whence they were taken.</p>  
 <p>The 7th house and its lord, or the peregrine planet in an angle, signify the thief.</p>  
 <p>The 2d house, its lord, and the ☽, signify the things lost ar stolen; and the 4th house, and its lord, shew the place where they are conveyed to, and then are.</p>  
 <p>The aspects of ☉ and ☽, the lords of the 1st and 2d, and</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 208</font></a></p>  
 <p>the dispositor of the ☽, by application to each other, shall shew whether they will be had again or not.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 2d and the ☽ be in the 7th, and the lord of the 7th behold them both by ✶ or △ (though the aspect be several degrees distant), then are the goods taken away by some one, and not merely lost.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be lady of the 2d, and going to ☌ of the lord of the 7th, then has the party mislain it; and the thing is neither lost nor stolen.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be lady of the ascendant, and in the 4th, and the lord of the 2d be in the 7th or 8th in ✶ or △ of ☽, the thing is not stolen, but taken away in jest.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be lady of the ascendant, and be in it, and ☉ lord of the 2d in the 10th, with the lord of the 7th, and the lord of the 7th ☐ ☽, then are the goods stolen and taken away. If ☽ be in the 3d, and in ☐ to the lord of the 7th, and the lord of the 2d be in the 7th, it was first taken in jest, but is now stolen, and will be hard to recover, unless ☉ and ☽ aspect the ascendant.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be lady of the 5th, and in ♑, and ♀ lady of the 2d to the 10th, and ☽ in ☍ to the lord of the 7th, then has the party lost the goods as he went by the way, or left them in some place. If ☽ be in ♋ in the 8th, and the lord of the 2d in the 5th, and neither of them behold the lord of the 7th, and he be in the 7th, the goods are taken away in jest by the master of the house, and he will deny it. If ☽ be in the 4th in ☍ to its lord, and the lord of the 2d in the 12th in ✶ to the lord of the 7th, then has somebody taken away the things in jest. If ☽ be in the house of the lord of the 7th, and be in the 12th, not beholding the lord of the 7th, and the lord of the 2d be in the 6th, then are the goods removed in jest; and if, in this ease, the lord of the 2d did last separate from the ruler of the ☽, they will scarcely be had again. If the ☽</p>  
 <p><a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 209</font></a></p>  
 <p>separate from the lord of the 2d by ☐, they are taken away end stolen; and the same, if the ☽, being lady of the 2d, separate from the lord of the house wherein she is.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the ascendant separate from ♃, (he not being lord of the 7th, or peregrine in an angle), or from the lord of the 2d, the querent has lain it down and forgotten it, and so it was lost; but, when both the lords of the 1st and 2d separate from ♃, this is surer. If (in such case) the lord of the 2d, or ♃, separate from the lord of the ascendant, then did the party lose the goods by the way as he went, or in some place where he was, or they fell out of his pocket accidentally, and they are neither found nor stolen. But if there be none of these separations, see if the peregrine planet, or lord of the 7th apply to ♃, or the lord of the 2d; then, if they do, the goods are absolutely stolen. If the lord of the 2d, or ♃, apply to the significator of the thief, he came easily by them, and did not come with intent to steal; but, seeing the thing unprotected, he was tempted to steal.</p>  
 <p>If the significator of the thief aspect the lord of the 1st or 2d, or the cusp of the 2d, or ⊕, or ☽, or their dispositor, or the planet in whose term ☽ is, or if he be in the ascendant, it is stolen; but, if there be no <i>evil</i> aspect to any of these, it is not stolen.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of the Age of the Thief</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>Guido Bonatus</i> says, that if the thief's significator be ☿, he is very young; if ♀, rather older, but yet a young female; ♂ shews him of full age; ♃ of middle age, and ♄, elderly. If the ☉ be his significator, and be between the ascendant and 10th, he is young, and so increasing in age until he come to the angle of the earth. If the ☽ shew the thief, his age will correspond to her age; and in all cases judge <i>also</i> by the position the thief's significator has reached in the sign where</p>  
 <p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 210</font></a></p>  
 <p>he is found. If he be just entered the sign, quite young; if in the middle of the sign, of middle age; and if towards the end of the sign, elderly; and if ♄ aspect him any way, it adds to his age. Oriental planets denote also younger persons, and occidental planets elderly persons. You must consider all the testimonies before you judge the thief's age.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether the Thief be Male or Female</i>?</p>  
 <p>The significator of the thief being masculine, and in a masculine sign, and the ☽ in a masculine sign, it is a male; <i>et e contrâ</i>. The angles of the figure masculine shew a man; and if feminine, a woman. If ♀ or the ☽ be the significator, or, when aspecting them, it is a female; ♄, ♃, ♂, ☉, and ☿ aspecting them, a male.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether one Thief or more</i>?</p>  
 <p>If the significator be in a fixed sign, it denotes one only; if he be in double-bodied signs, it denotes more than one, especially if there be more than one planet in the sign, and they peregrine. Also, when ☉ and ☽ are in angles, and in ☐ aspect, it shews more than one. If the significator be in ♋, ♏, or ♓, it is a testimony of there being more than one; the angles being moveable, the same. The ☽ in the ascendant, and in a double-bodied sign, shews more than one. And if the significator be in aspect with more than one planet, unless he be in a fixed sign, it shews plurality.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of the Colour of the Thief's Clothes</i>.</p>  
 <p>This must be judged in a general manner; and by the colours of the signs and houses of the significator, and the planets ruling them. Thus, ♄ is black; ♃ green, spotted, or ash; ♂ red; ☉ tawny, or saffron, or sandy; and if you mix the colours according to the signs and planets, &amp;c., you</p>  
 <p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 211</font></a></p>  
 <p>will judge very nearly the general colour of the thief's clothes. Thus, ♄ and ♃ mixed, give dark green, or green spotted with black; ♄ and ♂, a dark reddish brown, or tawny; ♄ and ☉, a blackish orange, and shining; ♄ and ♀, a whitish grey; ♃ and ☿, a black blue; ♄ and ☽, a deep russet, or grey; ♃ and ♂, a tawny, light spotted; ♃ and ☉, a deep, shining red; ♃ and ♀, a greenish grey; ♃ and ☿, a spotted green; ♃ and ☽, a high-coloured green; ♂ and ☉, a deep red, or scarlet; ♂ and ♀, light red, or crimson; ♂ and ☿, a tawny red, or brick colour; ♂ and ☽, a light red, glistening.</p>  
 <p>You must observe, that if the signifier be ♄, in his own house, ♑, and not in close aspect with any other planet, the thief will be dressed all in <i>black</i>; because both sign and planet rule that colour. But if he were in the 1st house, which rules <i>white</i>, he would have some <i>white</i> about his person. Also, if it were ♂, who rules <i>red</i>, and he were found in ♏, which rules <i>brown</i>, he would denote a rusty, dirty, reddish brown; but if he were in ♌, which rules <i>red and green</i>, and ♃ were in aspect, there would be much <i>green</i>, as well as <i>red</i>, about the dress; and so of the ethers.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The relation the Thief bears to the Owner</i>.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 7th, or significator of the thief, being in the ascendant, it is one well known to the querent, or one who frequents his house; and is in no way suspected.</p>  
 <p>If the significator of the thief be in the 2d, it is one of the household, or an acquaintance; but if in a feminine sign, it may be the querent's wife or maid-servant; and it is in the loser's power, and may be recovered by money.</p>  
 <p>If he be in the 3d, it is one of his near kindred or neighbours; or some messenger, or ether person, often in his sight.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 212</font></a></p>  
 <p>If in the 4th, it is his father, or some elderly person, or one who resides in the house. &amp;c., of his father; or he is a labourer or farm-servant.</p>  
 <p>If in the fifth, it is his son or daughter, or one of the near relations of his brother or sister, or near neighbour; or one of the household of his father, or his kept mistress, or some one connected with taverns, theatres, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>If he be in the 6th, it is a servant, or the querent's father's relation; or it is some person in bad health.</p>  
 <p>If he be in the 7th, it may be his own wife or lover, or some female who has been suspected of having connexion with the querent: or it is some person with whom he deals publicly, or one who is his open enemy.</p>  
 <p>If in the 8th, it is a stranger; yet it is likely to be one who is, or has been, at times employed about the house, such as an occasional gardener, or charwoman, washerwoman, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>If in the 9th, it is some traveller or vagrant, or some person employed about churches, &amp;c.; or a person in connexion with some jailor, or master of a workhouse, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>If in the 10th, it is a person of respectable circumstances, or some master tradesman, &amp;c.; one not necessitated to turn thief; and, generally, a person who lodged in the house, or visited it frequently when the thing was taken.</p>  
 <p>If in the 11th, a friend, or one who is trusted, and has done the querent some service; or one connected with a neighbouring clergyman, or the household of the querent's mother.</p>  
 <p>If in the 12th house, it is a stranger, or some poor, common thief or beggar; a person in miserable circumstances, who partly lives by thieving or thief taking.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Other Particulars of the Thief</i>.</p>  
 <p>If the thief's significator be in the end of a sign, or applying</p>  
 <p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a></p>  
 <p>to a planet in the 3d or 9th, he is going off; and if it be a superior planet, and leaving a sign, he is undoubtedly leaving his house or lodgings, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>If his significator be in an angle, he is still in the town; if succeedent, he is not far off; but if cadent, he is far gone.</p>  
 <p>If it be in an angle, he is in a house; and if ☽ be in an angle, in his own house, &amp;c.; if in a succeedent, in a field or enclosure; and if ☽ be succeedent, it is his own, or where he resides; and if in a cadent house, he is on a common or open place, and if ☽ be cadent, it belongs to the town, &amp;c. where he lives.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the ascendant and the significator of the thief be together, the thief is with the querent. And if the thief's significator be in the ascendant, the thief will be at the querent's house before the querent. But if the significator be in the 7th, he is hid at home, and dare not be seen. The direction in which the thief lives may be judged by the sign and quarter in which the significator is.</p>  
 <p>The ☽ denotes also the door of the thief's house. If she be in a fixed sign, the house has but one door; if in a moveable sign, the door is high above the earth, and it is probable that there is another smaller door. If ♄ aspect the sign of the ☽, the door has been broken, and often repaired, or is old or black. If ♂ aspect it, the gate or door has some mark of fire. If ♄ and ♂ both have a friendly aspect to the sign the ☽ is in, the door is iron, or is very strong. If be afflicted, it is broken or injured; and if ☽ be decreasing, and near ☉, the gate, &amp;c. opens on the back premises, and there is no front door to the street; if she increase, and is near ☉, it is low down, and there is a step to descend in entering. But if ☽ e in a moveable sign, there are steps up to it.</p>

 <p align="center"><i>Whether the Goods are in the Hands of the Thief</i>?</p>  
 <p>If the thief's significator be in aspect to, and disposed of by another planet, they are not in his hands; otherwise they are.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The Place where the Goods are</i>.</p>  
 <p>The nature of the place is judged by the lord of the 4th house. If he be in a moveable sign, it is in a place high above the ground; in a fixed sign, in the earth; and in a common sign, it is under the eaves of a house, &amp;c. <a name="fr_111"></a><a href="#fn_110"><font size="1">1</font></a> And you must judge also by the quality of the sign; as ♈ shews a place where small cattle are, as sheep, hogs, &amp;c. ♌ shews a place of animals that bite, as dogs, foxes, &amp;c.; ♐ a place of animals that are ridden, as horses, mules, &amp;c., and their stables. ♉, ♍, and ♑ shew a place of large cattle, as ♉ oxen, kine, &amp;c.; ♍ and ♑ shew camels, mules, asses, &amp;c., ♍ also shews barns where corn is kept, and a place about the earth. ♑ denotes goats, hogs, &amp;c.; ♊ shews a wall or partition in a house; ♎ a high part, or near a closet or little house; ♒ shews near a door, above another door or gate in a high part; ♏ shews a place of unclean water; ♓ a place always moist. But if the ☽ be in the same sign with the lord of the 4th, judge by her more than him.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>In what Part of a House Things lost, stolen, or concealed may be</i>.</p>  
 <p>If the thing lost be in the house, (whether stolen or not), behold the lord of the 4th, (or, if a planet be in the 4th, take him in preference.)</p>  
 <p>If it be ♄, it is in a dark or secret place; and if he be in</p>

 <p>If ♃, a place of wood, bushes, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>If ♂, a kitchen or place where fire is kept; if aspected by ☿, a shop.</p>  
 <p>If ☉, the hall, dining-room, or chief room where the master frequents.</p>  
 <p>If ♀, a bed, or among bed-clothes, or where females much frequent. In this case ♎ would shew the top of the bed.</p>  
 <p>If ☿, a place of books, pictures, carving, &amp;c.; and if ♍, where corn is.</p>  
 <p>If ☽, it is in a pit, cistern, or washing place.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Description of the House or Place where the Things are that are lost, &amp;c</i>.</p>  
 <p>The ☉ describes the house, and also its front entrance. If he be in an airy sign, it is high, &amp;c., and its colour may be known by the sign and house he is in. The ☽ describes the cellar, pump, or place holding the water; as, if she be in ♒, it is a cistern, high above the ground, &amp;c.; if ♏, a low pit or pond; if ♍, a deep well. ♀ shews the place of mirth, female apartments, &amp;c. ☊ denotes the stairs or ladder to climb by, &amp;c. ☋ describes the place the wood is in, or the animals are kept. ☿ denotes the room, &amp;c.; if in a common sign, it is a cupboard, or small room within another; if in a fixed sign, it shews a house having no cellar, or a single chamber. If ♃, ♀, or both, be in the 10th, the door has a fair appearance, and opening; if ♄ be in the 10th, the door is near some ditch, pit, or deep place; if ♂ be there, there is a fire-place near the door, or place for killing animals; if ☿ be there, near the door is a place where tools or instruments are kept; if ☉ be there, then there is some seat or porch near the door; and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 216</font></a></p>  
 <p>if ☽ be in the 10th, there is near the entrance a door to go under ground, a trap or cellar door, or some other convenience in very common use. <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_111"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The Nature of the Thing stolen</i>.</p>  
 <p>This is judged by the lord of the 2d house. ♄ shews lead, iron, things of a black or dark blue colour, wool, black garments, heavy things, earthy materials, agricultural implements, carts, &amp;c. ♃ oil, honey, silk, fruit, men's clothes, merchandize, horses, &amp;c. ♂ arms, pepper, brass, red clothes, red wine, and red things; generally sharp-pointed, cutting, and hot things, horses for war, &amp;c., and all warlike engines or instruments. ☉ gold, brass, yellow clothes, diamonds, and things of value. ♀ women's dresses, or ornaments, such as rings, ear-rings, &amp;c., white cloth, and white wine. ☿ shews money, paper, books, pictures, and party-coloured dresses, &amp;c., and scientific instruments, writing-desks, &amp;c. The ☽ all common commodities, such as crockery, &amp;c. cattle, poultry, and also silver.</p>

 <p>Also, if the lords of the term and house of the ☽ be both</p>

 <p>increasing in light and motion, <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">1</font></a> and free from affliction, it shall be recovered, and be uninjured.</p>  
 <p>Generally, if there be a diminution of their light and motion, the thing is already partly destroyed. If there be good aspects to the lords or cusps of the ascendant, or 2d, or to ⊕ or its lord, by planets in angles, it will soon be recovered.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 8th in the ascendant, or with its lord, shews recovery; the lord of the 7th in the 8th, denies it: ♄, ♂, or ☋ in the ascendant, or 2d, shew dividing and loss of the thing.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the 2d in the ascendant shews recovery; and the lord of the 1st in the 2d the same, after long search. If the 2d or its lord be afflicted, all the things lost shall not be recovered. If both luminaries be under the earth, it is a strong testimony against recovery.</p>  
 <p>If both ☉ and ☽ aspect the ascendant, the thing cannot be lost, but will shortly be discovered.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of the Time of the Thing being recovered</i>.</p>  
 <p>Observe the <i>application</i> of the planets that signify recovery, and determine the number of days, weeks, or months, as they may be in moveable, common, or fixed signs, in angles, succeedents, or cadents. And if the signifiers are swift in motion, it hastens the recovery; if slow, it retards.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of the Thief's Person</i>.</p>  
 <p>In addition to the planet's general description in the sign he is in, observe the aspects he has, and take all these into consideration. Moreover, if the significator be oriental, and in ♌, ♍, or ♐, the person is <i>large</i>; if occidental, and in ♋, ♏, or ♓, the body is <i>smaller</i>. If the planet have <i>south</i> </p>

 <p>If the lord of the 7th (or thief's significator) be in the 1st or 7th, in ☌ with the lord of the ascendant, or a retrograde planet. If the ☽ separate from the thief's significator, and apply to ☌ of the lord of the 1st; or go from ☌ of the lord of the 1st to him. Or if ☉ and ☽ be in ☌ with him; or if he be going to combustion, or be in ☌ with an infortune in the 7th. He is captured if ☽ be in the 7th, applying to ☐ of ♂, the ☉, or ☿; ☽ separating from ☐ of ♄ or ☿, and applying to ☐ of ☉, or separating from ☌ ♄, and going to ☐ ☿; or in the 8th, in ☍ ♂ or in the 7th, going to the lord of the 8th.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>The Thief escapes</i>.</p>

 <p>The lord of the ascendant, planets therein, and ☽, are for the querent or challenger, or him who attacks; the 7th house, its lord and planets therein, for the adversary. Behold whose significators are most angular, best dignified and aspected, and expect victory for that party. If evil planets be in the ascendant, and fortunes in the 7th, the adversary shall overcome, and <i>vice versâ</i> also the lord of the 7th, in the ascendant, betokens victory to the querent, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether any one shall return safe from War, or any dangerous Voyage, &amp;c</i>.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the ascendant, strong, well aspected, and his</p>  
 <p><a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 220</font></a></p>  
 <p>dispositor a good planet; good planets in the ascendant, or aspecting its cusp, are all good testimonies; and the reverse are evil. If the lord of the 7th, and the 7th house, be fortunate, (though the first be not,) the party returns, though not without great crosses and hinderances; <i>et e contra</i>. Observe how ☽ is disposed; for her application to the good planets is fortunate; <i>and the contrary</i>. Evil planets in the 8th are signs of fear and death; ♄ shews bruises and hurts by falls, &amp;c., and losses; ♂ denotes wounds by weapons; ☋, injuries and disgrace.</p>  
 <p>If an evil planet be with the lord of the ascendant, and a good one in the ascendant, he will suffer great loss or be sorely wounded, but not die.</p>  
 <p>♄ in the 1st, or with its lord, shews loss to the querent by one whom he will meet; ♄ in the 1st, and an evil planet with its lord, he shall be wounded by wood or stone; ♂ shews wounds by fire or iron, and if ☋ be in the ascendant, and ♄ afflict its lord, he shall receive a wound, and be nearly killed. It is evil if ☉ be with the lord of the 7th, or be in the 8th.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the ascendant in the 8th, or with its lord, or the lord of the 8th in the ascendant, denotes the querent's death. And the lord of the 7th in the second, or with its lord, shews the death of the adversary.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 7th be strong, and have good aspects from the 10th, or its lord, the querent will gain honour. And if the cusp of the 2d and its lord, and ⊕ or its lord, be fortunate, then he gains money by the war, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>In the same manner as the 8th house and its lord shew death, the 12th and its lord denote imprisonment.</p>  
 <p>And if the question concern the general result of a war or expedition, it must be judged on the same principles.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 221</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of Partnership</i>.</p>  
 <p>If good planets be in the 1st and 7th, the partnership shall be and do well. And if the lord of the 7th be strong, and in fixed signs, it shall endure. If the two lords agree in aspects, and by mutual reception, the partners will accord well together. But if they disagree, the fault will be with that party who has ♅, ♄, ♂, or ☋ in their house.</p>  
 <p>The significators of substance will shew the means of each party; and as they may be about to receive good or ill aspects, will they thrive or lose by the concern. The 8th, its lord, and planets there, are for the quesited's property.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ separate from one fortune, and apply to the other, they will neither of them gain much by the concern. If she leave a good planet and apply to an ill, they begin well but end ill: and if she separate from one evil planet, and apply to another, they begin with complaining, continue with jealousy, and end with lawsuits. An evil planet, or ☋ in the 2d, the querent gains but little, will be cheated, or get into debt: if they be in the 8th, judge this of the quesited. And if the lord of the 7th or 8th, ☐ or ☍ ⊕, the querent may hope but little gain from his partner, who will embezzle the common stock, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of removing from Place to Place</i>.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the ascendant and planets therein stronger than the 7th, and planets there, it is better to remain. If there be a benefic in the 7th or ☊, and especially if ☽ separate from an infortune, remove; an evil planet there, or the lord of the 1st or ☽ leaving a benefic, remain.</p>  
 <p>The 8th house shews the property of the querent in he place he desires to remove to: if evil planets be there, it is better to remain. (<i>See also p</i>. <a href="aia30.htm#page_141">141</a>)</p>  
 <p><a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 222</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">O<i>f Lawsuits, and their Success</i>.</p>  
 <p>The lord of the ascendant or ☽ joined to the lord of the 7th, or in ✶ or △ with reception mutual, the parties will easily agree together, and make up the quarrel. But if one dispose of the other, and the reception be not mutual, they will agree without a lawsuit, but not without the interceding of friends. If they be in good aspect without, or in evil aspect with, reception, they will accord, after one effort at law. That party shall be most ready to agree whose significator is disposed of by the other. If they hasten to a mutual good aspect, and the lord of the 9th or 10th interpose an evil aspect, they will be led to dispute by a lawyer or by the judge. If there be any translation of light by the ☽, or other planet, between the two significators, it denotes that they will be reconciled by a third person, described by that planet.</p>  
 <p>Observe whether the lord of the ascendant or 7th be strongest or most powerful, and best aspected; for that one shall gain the day. If they compound, the first motion thereto comes from the lighter planet, who is disposed of by the other. If the lord of the ascendant be in the 7th, the adversary will overcome, and <i>vice versâ</i>. If either lord of the 1st or 7th be retrograde, he shews that the party does not believe that he has right on his side; nor will he stand to it very stoutly.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 10th, which denotes the <i>judge</i>, be direct, he will proceed fairly, and endeavour to settle the cause speedily. But if he be retrograde, the judge will not act fairly according to law, nor strive to terminate the cause. If the lord of the 10th throw an evil aspect to either significator, the judge will be against that party.</p>  
 <p>If ☉ or ☽ be in the ascendant, or aspect its lord, or be in either of his houses, it is a good testimony for the querent;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 223</font></a></p>  
 <p>and if, on the contrary, the lord of the 7th be so situated, it is in favour of the quesited. If the lord of the 10th receive both significators, the judge will settle the matter before it comes to full trial.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 10th be in the 10th, in his own house, the judge will do justice, and decide the case with honour to himself, unless the lord of the 10th be ♄ . If the lord of the 10th be only in his own term, or triplicity, the judge will determine the cause, but he is indifferent about it. If a planet having no dignities, or not in reception with the lord of the 10th, be in the 10th, the parties will not be satisfied with that judge or court. If ♄ be judge, he will not decide aright; and if ♃, ♀, ☉, ☿, or ☽ be in any aspect to him but ☍, there will be an ill report against him, of which he will clear himself; but if it be ☍, he will have a hard report against him, which will long continue. And if ♂ ☍ to ♄, the judge will be sorely defamed; and if also ☉ ☐ ♄, he may be disgraced.</p>  
 <p>In deciding as to the result, observe well the lord of the 4th, and how he aspects the significators, or the lords of their substance; also the <i>application</i> of the ☽. If both significators aspect one planet, some person will intercede between them. If the ascendant and 7th be in fixed signs, both par-ties are resolutely bent on the suit; if common signs, they will continue it long also, and remove the cause out of one court into another; and if moveable signs, they are not very determined, and will soon bring it to an end.</p>  
 <p>That party who is weakest, and most afflicted by the infortunes, shall receive most prejudice by the contention.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of making Purchases or Sales</i>.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be joined with the lord of the 7th, the querent may make the purchase. The lighter planet of the two houses</p>  
 <p><a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 224</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> (1st and 7th) will be the occasion of the sale. Judge the nature of the commodity by the house by which it is governed; as the 4th for a house, the 12th for large cattle, the 9th for books, &amp;c., the 10th for merchandize.</p>  
 <p>If infortunes be in the 7th, be cautious of the seller; he will try to trick the purchaser. The fourth house will shew the final result: but if ☽ be void of course, there may be many meetings, &amp;c., but scarcely any bargain concluded.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether a City, Town, Castle, &amp;c. besieged, shall be taken or not</i>.</p>  
 <p>The ascendant and its lord are for the querent and for the besiegers; the 4th signifies the place besieged or to be besieged, and the lord of the 4th the governor; the 5th and planets therein the ammunition, soldiers, &amp;c. in the place.</p>  
 <p>If you find the lord of the first strong and fortunate, or joined to the lord of the 4th in the ascendant, or with the ☽ or lord of the 10th, or any where but in the 6th, 8th, or 12th, and the lord of the 1st dispose of the lord of the 4th; or if ☽ dispose him, and be not disposed of by him, it is an argument that the place shall be taken. Or if the lord of the 4th be in such houses as behold not the 4th, and be with infortunes, and weak, it will be taken, and the governor may be wounded. If infortunes be in the 4th, without some strong aspect of the fortunes, it will be taken. If ☋ be in the 4th, it will be taken, and some parties will try to betray it, or some principal work or fort therein: the sign will shew which part of the town, &amp;c. In this case the governor does not expect to preserve it.</p>  
 <p>If the lord of the 4th be in the 4th, strong and not afflicted. neither retrograde nor combust, nor besieged .of the infortunes, or if the lord of the 7th be there, <i>free from all impediments</i>, or if ♃, ♀, ☊ or is be therein, and no reception between</p>  
 <p><a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 225</font></a></p>  
 <p>the lords of the 1st and 4th, then shall not the city, &amp;c. be taken; and if there be both a fortune and infortune in the 4th, it shall not be taken, if the fortune be the nearest to the cusp, or first transit that degree; and this more certainly, if the lord of the ascendant be weak or unfortunate, especially if a light planet. But if the lord of the ascendant be strong, or fortune therein, and the ☽ behold the cusp of the 4th, it shall be surprised or surrendered. An infortune in the 2d, or its lord, &amp;c. afflicted, the querent lacks means to pursue the siege with vigour.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Of Commanders in Armies: and whether they shall be victorious or not</i>.</p>  
 <p>If there be an infortune in the ascendant, it shews that the querent has no great justice on his part, or cause of quarrel. And if an infortune ☐ the ascendant, the party shewn by it (viz. that for which the querent asks) will not manage their affairs well or discreetly. If a good planet be in the ascendant, or aspect it by ✶ or △, it shews a good cause, and that it will be well managed.</p>  
 <p>An evil star in the 2d, and having no dignities therein, or aspecting its cusp by ☐ aspect, denotes that either there will be no war, or that the querent will gain nothing by it; a benefit testifies the reverse. If ♃ (or ♂ well dignified) be in the 3d, the querent's party will have good warlike stores, &amp;c., and will consist of good, brave soldiers; but if ♂ be there, ill dignified, they will be bad characters, and ill disciplined.</p>  
 <p>If an infortune be in the 4th, the campaign will be held in a difficult country. If the sign describe a hilly country, it will offer obstacles by woods and bad roads; and if it shew a moist country, it will he unfit for military occupations, by</p>  
 <p><a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 226</font></a></p>  
 <p>reason of rivers, marshes, &amp;c.; and so the army can do no good service.</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be in the 5th, well dignified, or a fortune aspect it, the army on the querent's side will be good soldiers, and well behaved; but ♄ there, or ☋, denotes the contrary.</p>  
 <p>If a fortune or ☊ be in the 6th, the ammunition train, artillery, &amp;c. will be good; if ♂ be there, the horses will be fierce, wild and unbroken. If ♄ be there (without dignities), they will be unserviceable, slow, and worn out.</p>  
 <p>A fortune in the 7th, the arms and instruments of war will be plentiful and serviceable. If an infortune be there, or afflicting it by evil aspect, they will be the reverse. In the former case, the enemy will be brave and no fool, and will fight fair; in the latter case, the enemy will fight rather by craft and treachery, than fair manhood.</p>  
 <p>A fortune in the 8th, shews that there will not be many men slain on the querent's side; nor any very important battle be fought. If ♄ be there, there will be much plundering and destruction, and many prisoners be taken; also much death by sickness and want, &amp;c. If ♂ be there, then expect much bloodshed.</p>  
 <p>A fortune in or aspecting the 9th, the enemy is well situated, and will strive to gain by false reports, alarms, &amp;c.; he is politic. If an infortune, he will wear himself out by marching, and will be often deceived by false intelligence; and if a fortune be in the 3d at the same time, the querent's side will gain by this conduct of the enemy.</p>  
 <p>A fortune in the 10th, or aspecting its cusp by ✶ or △, shews that the commanding officer is expert and capable. But if ♄, ☋, or ♂, (unfortunate), be there, or afflict the 10th house by ☐, the commander on the querent's side will be extremely incapable and unworthy, and meet only disgrace.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 227</font></a></p>  
 <p>A fortune or ☊ in the 11th, shews the officers are clever, and understand their duty, and will well support the commander; but an infortune, or ☋, the reverse.</p>  
 <p>If a fortune (or ♂ well dignified) be in the 12th, it denotes that the enemy is well prepared, and will defend themselves well. An infortune there, shews that they are weak and will disagree among themselves, and fear their own forces. If ☋ be in the 12th, the querent may expect treachery; and if the lord of the 12th be there, and have any dignities in the ascendant, the querent's side will suffer by desertion.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether the two Armies will Fight or not</i>.</p>  
 <p>Observe the ascendant and its lord, the ☽ and lord of the 7th, if they be ☌ in any angle they will fight. If the lords of the 1st and 7th be not in ☌, but are in ☐ or ☍ from angles, they will engage; or if there be any planet which transfers the light of one to the other by ☐ or ☍, there will be a fight, if there be no reception between them. But if there be none of these, and the heavier planet receive the lighter, there will be no serious engagement.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Whether the Querent have any Adversaries or open Enemies</i>.</p>  
 <p>If the question regard not any relation, take the 7th house for any open enemy, if any person be specially considered; but if it he simply as to enemies in general, look to the 12th house. If it be as to some individual enemy, see whether the lord of the 7th, or planet therein, throw a ☐ or ☍ to the lord of the ascendant, or ☽; this denotes that the quesited is envious or inimical. If the aspect apply, the enmity will increase; and if the enemy's significator dispose of the querent's without reception mutual, the querent will suffer by him: the manner how may be learned by the house he is in. If the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 228</font></a></p>  
 <p>aspect be past, the injury is done, and the enmity is dying away, unless the querent's significator, or ☽, be about to receive another ill aspect.</p>  
 <p>If the quesited's significator be placed in the 12th, or in any good aspect with any planet which is in ☐ or ☍ to the ☽, or lord of the ascendant, without reception, there is enmity to the querent.</p>  
 <p>If the question be general, the lord of the 12th and planets therein must be taken; and they shew private enemies to the querent, unless a benefic planet be in the 12th, and throw a ✶, or △, to the querent's significators. If there be many planets in the 7th, it shews many open enemies; and if in the 12th, many secret foes. The ☐ shews envy and malice, which may be reconciled; the ☍, if without reception, denotes irreconcilable enemies. If an evil planet in the 12th throw a good aspect to the querent's significator, it chews that there is some person who under pretence of friendship wished to injure the querent. The same if the lord of the 11th be in the 12th. The house the lord of the 12th is in, will describe what person will injure the querent.</p>

 <p align="center">JUDGMENT ON THE FIGURE ABOVE.</p>  
 <p><i>State of the Querent's case</i>.--A gentleman had been a long time an earnest suitor unto her for marriage; but she had continually slighted, and at last had given him a positive denial; after which she sorely repented her conduct, and wished she had her former opportunity. She was in this state when she propounded her question to me.</p>  
 <p align="center">____________</p>  
 <p>The ascendant and ☉ are for the querent; ♄, lord of the 7th, and ☽, are for the gentleman. The querent was moderately</p>  
 <p><a name="page_230"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 230</font></a></p>  
 <p>tall, of round face, sanguine complexion, grey eyes, light brown hair, occasioned by ☉, lord of the ascendant, being in the terms of ♂, and she was of cheerful modest countenance, comely, and well spoken.</p>  
 <p>Finding ♄, in the south angle, in ☌ with ♂ in ♉, fixed, earthy sign, I judged the quesited to be of middle stature, not tall, nor handsome; a long face, not well composed; a wan, pale complexion; hair dark, or of a sad chesnut colour, curling and crisp; his eyes fixed, always down-looking, musing, stooping forward with his head, some impediment in his walking, as treading awry, &amp;c. (<i>All this was confessed</i>.)</p>  
 <p>Finding ♄ so elevated, and in ☌ ♂, I judged that he was gloomy and angry, discontented, scorning his former slights, (as all saturnine people do); and I judged him much incensed by a relation, a gentleman of respectability, shewn by ♂, lord of <i>his</i> 3d and 10th, and that this gentleman and he lived either in one house, or near each other; this being shewn by the significator's being in his 4th angle and fixed; (<i>and so it was</i>.)</p>  
 <p>I said the gentleman had no inclination for her, as the ☽ was void of course, and applied to ☍ of ☉, lord of the ascendant, which shewed that she herself was her own enemy. She then confessed the truth, and implored my advice how, consistent with honour, she might, if possible, bring it on again; and she appearing in great distress, I began to consider what hopes she had in the figure. I found ☉ applying to ✶ of ♄; this argued her desire and affection towards the quesited: but as there was no reception it gave little hopes. Finding reception between ♃ and ☽, and ☉ and ☽, and also that ☽ disposed of ♄ in her exaltation, and ♃ in her house, and that ♃ was very near a ✶ of ♄, <i>applying</i>, and not separating; and also that ♃ was in his exaltation, he being s</p>  
 <p><a name="page_231"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 231</font></a></p>  
 <p>fortune, and ever assisting nature and the afflicted, and that he was able to take off the malice of ♄; I was confident, from the exactness of the aspect, that the quesited was intimately acquainted with a person of rank and worth, (such as ♃ represented), whom I exactly described, and the lady very well knew. I directed her to apply to him, and acquaint him with the full extent of her folly, and I assured her that in him she would find all honour and secrecy; and I doubted not but, by God's blessing, he would again revive the business, and bring her to her heart's content. But finding that ☉ and ♄ came to ✶ aspect on the 27th of the month, I advised to hasten all before that aspect was over; and as on the 19th of June ♄ and ♃ came to a ✶, I told her that the gentleman should first move the quesited on that day near noon. My counsel was followed, and by that gentleman's means the match was brought on again, and completed within twenty days, to the content of the sorrowful (but to me unthankful) lady, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>I acquainted this lady, that shortly before her lover had been offered a match, and that the lady was well descended, of good fortune, and described by ♀; but that she need not fear his marrying her, as some officer or gentleman, who had been in the army, shewn by ♂, would prevent that. She well knew both the parties, and confessed that such a mattes had been.</p>  
 <p>Had the query been, <i>who should live longest</i>? I should have judged the female, because ☉ is going to ☌ ♃, and ♂ afflicts ♄.</p>  
 <p><i>If, whether the quesited were rich</i>? I should say he had a good estate, as ♃, lord of his 2d, was direct, swift, and in his exaltation, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><i>If, would they agree</i>? I should say they would, as ☉ and ♄ are applying to ✶; yet ♄ with ♂ shews a man who looks</p>  
 <p><a name="page_232"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 232</font></a></p>  
 <p>to have authority, one choleric as well as melancholy, jealous without a cause, &amp;c.; yet the ✶ of ♃ mitigates his ill manners by means of education.</p>  
 <p><i>If, will the querent be honest</i>? I answer, her significator ☉ is no way afflicted by ♂; her ascendant is <i>fixed</i>, and there is reception between ♃ and ☽, which are arguments of a virtuous woman. <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>  
 <p>In this manner you may examine any figure for discovery of what is necessary, &amp;c.</p>

 <p align="center">JUDGMENT ON THE ABOVE QUESTION.</p>  
 <p>The querent was of tall stature, ruddy complexion, sober, discreet, and well spoken, &amp;c. The quesited was very tall, slender, lean, and of a long visage, with black hair. His tallness I attribute to ♃ being in the terms of ☿, and the cusp of the 7th being also in his terms. Indeed, a significator being in the terms of any planet, does vary the party from his natural constitution; so that he will retain a tincture from that planet, according as he is dignified. <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">1</font></a> The darkness of his hair I attribute to the aspect of ♄ to ♃, and ☽ being in the term of ♃.</p>  
 <p>☿ is here the querent's significator, and being retrograde, and under the beams of ☉, shewed that she was in distress and fear that the quesited would not have her. And she had some reason for it; for ♃ was in his exaltation, and near the ✶ of ♀, an argument that the man stood upon high terms, and had been tampering with another: yet, as both significators were in <i>semi-sextile</i> aspect, and in good houses, I gathered hope that there were some mutual sparks of love. And when I found ☽ separating from ☐ of ♃ and hastening to △ of ☿, thus conveying the light of the quesited's significator to the lord of the ascendant, which he received willingly by his retrograde movement, I was confident that the match would be suddenly brought about by a person described by ☽; who did, indeed, though with a little difficulty, produce the marriage to the content of both parties.</p>

 <p align="center">JUDGMENT UPON THE ABOVE FIGURE.</p>  
 <p>The ascendant, ☿ in ♒, and ♂ in ♊, taken together, signified and described the querent, (the servant's master). He was short of stature, corpulent, of good complexion, and ruddy, fresh colour. His fatness I attribute to the north latitude of ☿, which was one degree; also the ascendant was in the terms of ♂, and face of ☉, who was in partile △ to ☽ in a moist sign, which shews a full body, and phlegmatic.</p>  
 <p>The servant was shewn by ♂ (lord of the 6th) and ♏.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_235"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 235</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> He was a well-set short fellow, large joints, broad and full face, dark brown hair, his teeth irregular, complexion obscure and sunburnt, yet his skin clear; his age about nineteen.</p>  
 <p>I observed that he went away from his master the preceding Sunday, when ☽ was in ♊, a western sign, where ♂ now was; and that ☿, the common significator of servants, was in ♒, a western sign, but south quarter of heaven.</p>  
 <p>I judged, therefore, that he went westward at first, and that at the time of the question he was west from the querent's house; and this I judged, because ♂ was angular, otherwise I should have judged by ☽. As ♂ and ☿, lord of the ascendant, were hastening to a △ out of angles, I judged that in a day or two he should have his servant again.</p>  
 <p>Upon the Friday following he came home, and said he had been at Kingston upon Thames; which, if true, he was nearly west, but a little south; and near a great water, (viz. the Thames), as the ☽ in ♋ might signify.</p>

 <p align="center">JUDGMENT UPON THE ABOVE FIGURE.</p>  
 <p>The queries to me were, <i>What part of the city they should search</i>? and, <i>should he be found</i>?</p>  
 <p>The querent was described by the sign ascending, and <i>Cauda</i> (☋) therein; and, indeed, he was <i>saturnine</i>, and vitiated both in body and mind; that is, he was a little deformed in body, of small stature, and extremely covetous in disposition, &amp;c. The sign of the 6th signifies a dog, as it would have done a sheep, hog, &amp;c., or any small cattle.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_237"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 237</font></a></p>  
 <p>The sign ♊ is west and by south, the quarter of heaven westerly; ☿, the dog's significator, is in ♎, a western sign, and is in a south-western quarter of heaven; the ☽ is in ♍, a south-west sign, verging to the west angle. The plurality of testimonies shewed that the dog ought to be <i>west</i> from where the owner lived, which was at Temple-bar; therefore I judged that the dog was about Long Acre, or upper part of Drury Lane. As ☿ was in a sign of the same triplicity with ♊, which signifies London, and applied to △ of the cusp of the 6th, I judged that the dog was not out of the lines of communication, but in the same quarter; of which I was more satisfied by the △ of ☉ to sa. ☿ being in an airy sign, I said the dog was in some garret or upper room; and, as ☽ was under the beams of ☉, and ☿, ☽, and ☉ were in the 8th house, that he was kept privately, or in great secrecy. But as ☉, on the following Monday, formed a △ to ♂, lord of the ascendant, and ☽ formed a △ to ♂, who has dignities in the ascendant, I intimated that he should then have news of his dog; and this proved true; for a gentleman of the querent's acquaintance, coming accidentally to see a friend in Long Acre, found the dog chained up under a table, and knowing him to belong to the querent, sent him home about ten o'clock on the Monday morning, to my very great credit.</p>  
 <p>Usually I find that all fugitives go by the ☽; and as she varies her sign, they waver and shift their flight, declining more to east, west, north, or south. But you must judge by the significator or the ☽, according to which is strongest; or if both be equally strong, take that which best describes the fugitive, with regard also to that one which is nearest in aspect to the cusp of the house from whence signification is taken. That is, if the fugitive be a servant or small animal, the 6th; if a large animal, the 12th; if a son or daughter, the 5th; and if a wife, the 7th, &amp;c.</p>

 <p align="center">JUDGMENT ON THE ABOVE FIGURE.</p>  
 <p>Here ♏ ascends, and partly describes the querent's person; ♂, his mind and disposition; ♂ in ☐ to ☿ and ♄, shewed him ill-conditioned, arrogant, proud, wasteful, &amp;c. As ♂ is in 25° 2' of ♌, he has entered his own <i>terms</i>, and is in his own <i>face</i>, I therefore refused him for the thief's significator. In the next place, ♄, though in the west angle, (the house of theft), is in his own <i>term</i> and <i>face</i>; I also passed him by. But finding ☿ in an angle, having no essential dignity, and in partile ☌ of ♄, and ☐ of ♂, I took him to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 239</font></a></p>  
 <p>signify the thief. But whether he described a malt or female was the question. The angles are part masculine, part feminine; no certain judgment could, therefore, be formed from thence. The ☽ was in a masculine sign, applying to a masculine planet, (♂), and ☿ was in ☌ with ♄, and ☐ to ♂, both masculine planets; I judged, therefore, that the sex was male.</p>  
 <p>As ☿ ever signifies youth, and as ☽ was so near the ☉, separating, I said he was a youth, of some 15 or 16. I described him of reasonable stature, thin visaged, hanging eye-brows, with some scar or blemish in his face, because ♂ casts his ☐ to ☿; bad eyesight, as ☿ is with evil fixed stars, (<i>the Pleiades</i>,) of the nature of ♂ and ☽; dark hair, because of his closeness to ♄; a scurvy countenance, and one formerly accused of theft and knavery.</p>  
 <p>The youth's significator being in ☌ with ♄, lord of the 3d and 4th houses, I judged him the child of some neighbour; and as ☽ is in ♊, and ☽ is in ♊, and ☿ in ♉ in the 7th, I said he dwelt either opposite to the querent, or a little south-west. The ⊕ being in the ascendant, and disposed of by ♂, lord of the ascendant in the 10th, and as ☽ applied to his ✶, and was within about four degrees of the aspect, I judged he should not only hear of, but have his money again within four days. He believed not one word I said, but would need persuade me that a woman servant, shewn by ♂, was one thief, and ♄ another; but I stood firm to the art, and would not consent to this, as both ♄ and ♂ were essentially dignified. The event proved me right, both as to the person and the return of the money, which was within three days after.</p>

 <p align="center">EXPLANATION OF THE ABOVE FIGURE.</p>  
 <p>Living in the country in 1637, I had bought at London some fish for my provision in Lent; it came down by the barge to Walton. On Saturday, the 10th February, one of the watermen, instead of bringing my fish home, acquainted me that their warehouse was robbed last night, and my fish stolen. I took the exact time I first heard the report, and erected this figure accordingly; endeavouring to give myself satisfaction as to what became of my goods, and, if possible, to recover part or all of them.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 241</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Judgment</i>.</p>  
 <p>I first observed that there was no peregrine planet in an angle but ♃, whom I found on the cusp of the 7th house. I considered the signification of ♃ in ♏ a moist sign, and the significator of my goods, ☿ in ♓, a moist sign; and that ⊕ was in ♋, a moist sign. Discretion, together with art, led me to think he who had my goods must be a person whose profession, or calling, was to live upon the water; and that they were in some low room, in a moist place, because ⊕ was in ♋, and ☽ was in ♉, an earthy sign, and under the earth.</p>  
 <p>I was confident I should hear of my goods again, as ☿, lord of the 2d, was applied to by ✶ of ☽, who was lady of ⊕, and yet without hope of recovering them, as ☿ was in his fall, and detriment; but as he was in his own terms. and had a △ to ⊕, there were hopes of regaining some of my goods.</p>  
 <p>There being no waterman in Walton described by ♃ in ♏, I examined what fisherman there was of that complexion and as ♂, lord of the 7th, was leaving ♏, his own sign, and entering another, I inquired if any fisherman of the nature of ♂ and ♃ had lately sold any land, or was leaving his own house and going to another; such a one I discovered, who lived near the Thames side, a mere fisherman, but a jovial fellow, though much suspected of thievery. He was of good stature, thick, and full-bodied, fair complexion, and red or yellowish hair.</p>  
 <p>I procured a warrant from a justice of peace, and reserved it privately until Sunday, the 18th of the month; and then, with a constable and the bargeman, I searched only that one house of the suspected fisherman. I found part of my fish in water, part eaten, part not consumed; all confessed. I</p>  
 <p><a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 242</font></a></p>  
 <p>asked the woman for seven <i>Portugal onions</i> which I had lost also; but she, not knowing what they were, had made pottage with them. I freely remitted the remainder of my fish, though the hireling priest of Walton affirmed that I had satisfaction for it. Bat he never hurt himself with a lie.</p>  
 <p>Thus you see, that the peregrine planet in an angle describes the thief; and that either ☉ or ☽ in the ascendant gives assured hopes of discovering who it was. The ☽ applying to the lord of the 2d, argues recovery; if they both be essentially dignified, <i>complete</i>; but if accidentally fortified, <i>partial</i>. If both be peregrine, and they apply, there will be a discovery, but no recovery.</p>

 <p><i>A Figure erected to know whether Sir </i>WILLIAM WALLER<i> or Sir </i>RALPH HOPTON<i> should overcome; they being supposed to be engaged near Alsford </i>♀<i> 29th March, 1644</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center">JUDGMENT ON THE ABOVE FIGURE.</p>  
 <p>The ascendant is for our army, the ☽, ♃, and ♀, for our generals, viz. Sir William Waller, and Major-General Browne, a valiant and prudent citizen of London, who may justly claim a large share of honour in that day's service. Sir Ralph Hopton is signified by ♄, lord of the 7th; his army by ♑ in the descending part of heaven which is usually</p>  
 <p><a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 244</font></a></p>  
 <p>given to the friends and assistants of the enemy. There are only ♂ and ☋ in the 9th; so it appears that Sir Ralph had no supplies ready to attend that day's success, &amp;c. From the ☽, having principal signification of us and our army, being in her exaltation with ♃, I concluded all was and would be well on our side, and that the victory would be ours. From her separation from ♃, I said, I verily conceived that we had already taken some ammunition from them, or performed some service against them. This I was confirmed in by ☉, lord of our substance and assistants, being posited in the 10th house, in the very degree of his exaltation; (the 19th). And though I thought by the proximity of ♄ to ☉ we should not gain the whole, or have a perfect victory, without diminution of some part of it; yet I was confident we should obtain a considerable proportion of their ammunition, and have a victory, the only thing inquired after; for the ☽ applied to ♀, and then to a ✶ of ☿, he being angular. I told the <i>querent</i> that within eleven or twelve hours after the question we should have perfect news, and it satisfactory. For, considering that the fight was within fifty miles of London, I ordered my time with discretion, not allowing days for the time, but <i>hours</i>; and this because ☽ is distant from ♀ 11°, but is withal swift in motion, and increasing in light. These were also signs of our success, and the enemies' defeat. It appeared, by a letter from the army on that same Friday, that our generals took on the previous day 120 commanders and gentlemen, 560 common soldiers, and much ammunition. Thus the enemy was worsted, as appeared by ♄, (the Lord Hopton's significator), being <i>sub radiis</i>, in his fall in no aspect to any planet, wholly peregrine, and unfortunate, and aspecting the cusp of the 7th by ☐. All this argued that he would bring loss to his army, and dishonour to himself by the fight, &amp;c.</p>

 <p>QUESTION.--<i>Whether his Excellency </i>ROBERT<i> Earl of </i>ESSEX<i> should take </i>READING<i>, having then surrounded it with his Army</i>?</p>  
 <p align="center">JUDGMENT ON THE ABOVE FIGURE.</p>  
 <p>The General Essex is here shewn by ♂, lord of ♏, and his Majesty by ☉, lord of the 10th, the forces that were to relieve Reading by ♀ in ♓, and ☉ in ♉; also the town by ♒, the sign on the 4th; the governor, Sir Arthur Acton, (reputed an able soldier), by the lord of the 4th, ♄; and their ammunition and provision by ♃, lord of the 5th, and by ♀ located therein.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 246</font></a></p>  
 <p>The significator of his Excellency ♂ is well fortified, and afflicted in no way but by being in his fall. This figure manifests that it is of great importance in questions of warfare to have ♂ friendly to the querent. The ☽ separated from <i>nothing</i>, and was void of course; and, indeed, there was little hope of its being gained in the time it was. She applied to ✶ of ♂ from signs of long ascension, which was equivalent to a ☐; which argued that his Excellency would have much difficulty and some fighting ere he could get it. But as ♂ and ☽ were in reception, viz. ♂ in her house, and she in his terms and face, and near <i>Cor</i>. ♌, and in the house of honour, I judged that his Excellency would obtain and take Reading, and gain honour thereby. Finding ☉, his Majesty's significator, in the 7th in a fixed sign, I said that he would send forces to relieve the town, and oppose all he could; but that he would not prevail, as ♂ was better fortified than ☉. The King did come in person, and was beaten back at Causham Bridge.</p>  
 <p>Finding that ♒ was not afflicted, I judged the town strong, and able to hold out; and ♀ being in the 5th, that they wanted not ammunition. Having well weighed all things, and that ♄, lord of the 4th, signifying the Governor, was in his fall with ☋, and that ☿ and ♃ were not far from ☋, I said, (and sent somebody word), that the most certain way, and which would assuredly occasion the surrender of the town, was to set division among the principal officers, and incense them against their chief officer, and that about eight days from the time of the question his Excellency would be master of the town; yet rather by composition than by blood. This because ☉ and ♂ were separated from their ✶ aspect, and ♂ was also separated from the ☐ of ♄; as also because the ☽ applied so directly to ✶ of the lord of the ascendant, without any frustration, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 247</font></a></p>  
 <p>The town was delivered for the Parliament's use on the 27th April, three days after the time I said; but it is observable that they began to treat on the very Monday before, just eight days after the figure was set.</p>  
 <p>The Governor was hurt in the head, as ♄ in ♈ with ☋ shews; nor did they want provisions, &amp;c., as ♀ in the 5th signifies. <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p align="center">JUDGMENT ON THE PRECEDING FIGURE.</p>  
 <p>This figure is erected for the latitude and longitude of Antwerp, and is an exact representation of the heavens at the time the French troops opened ground, (or began the siege), before the citadel of Antwerp. By it the student will perceive that the rules laid down by our author, being founded in truth and nature, are infallible; and that they hold equally true in the 19th as they did in the 17th century. They must eventually put the sceptic to silence, and convince the world of the truth of planetary influence.</p>  
 <p>The ascendant and its lady, the ☽, are for the besiegers, the 7th and its lord for the besieged, the 4th is for the town, and its lord for the governor. The 10th is the house of honour for the besiegers, and we find ♃ potent therein, denoting decidedly that they should gain honour by the siege. The ☋ in the ascendant shewed success to the French, and ☊ in the 7th the reverse to their enemies. The lord of the 4th, ☿, is in his detriment, cadent, and in exact ☐ to the evil ♄, denoting disgrace to the governor, who is thereby shewn to be extremely obstinate, as, indeed, he was. The malefic in the 4th denoted that the place should be taken, and, as ☽ was in close ☐ to ♂, it would be by much loss of men and bloodshed on the part of the besiegers. The ☽ is in the <i>terms</i> of ♂, and he in her <i>exaltation</i> and <i>triplicity</i>, which reception denotes courageous conduct on the part of the besiegers; and although the ☽ is in ☐ to ♂, yet, there being mutual reception, it shews success in a martial exploit; but with much difficulty, because of the ☐ aspect. The garrison were denoted by the 5th, and its ruler ♀; and as ♀ is in the 6th, (the 12th from the enemies' ascendant), it shewed that all the enemies' party would be made prisoners, which was the case.</p>

 <p>The citadel capitulated when a breach had been effected; mad they surrendered to the French on the 23d December following; when the ☽, the besiegers' significator, crossed the cusp of the 7th house; thus entering the 7th just as the besiegers entered the place itself. It deserves notice that on the day ☿ fell retrograde, and ☽ crossed the cusp of the 5th (Dec. 15th), the besiegers carried the horn work.</p>  
 <p>The student will observe, that the lord of the 7th was peregrine, having no essential dignity whatever; and that the ☽, besides her aspect and her mutual reception with ♂, the chief significator of warfare, is in her own face, and disposes of ♄ by triplicity. Hence the besiegers are decidedly the strongest party, and should, by the rules of the science, certainly prevail.</p>  
 <p>The student may rely that the figure of the heavens at the first moment of commencing any enterprise whatever, will infallibly point out, to those who really understand astrology, its final result.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_113"></a><a href="aia33.htm#fr_114">218:1</a> ♄ shews one of a pale, swarthy, dark complexion; hard, rough skin; hairy body; small, leering eyes; jaundiced look; lean, crooked, or ill made; beetle browed; thin beard; thick, negro lips; bow-legged, or one who knocks his knees or ancles one against the other, and shuffles in his gait. He has a down look, his eyes always on the earth; is seldom free from cough and bad breath. He is crafty, revengeful, and malicious; dirty, a great eater, covetous, and seldom rich.</p>  
 <p>♃ denotes a full face, white and red mixed; full eyes; good make, light beard, but this depends chiefly on the sign; thick hair, good teeth, but some defect in the two front teeth; moderately curling hair. If in a watery sign, fat and plump; in an earthy sign, large make: in an airy sign, strong--a person who bears a good moral character.</p>  
 <p>♂ denotes a full face, red or sunburnt; a sharp, fierce countenance; eyes fiery and ferocious, with rather a yellow tinge; hair and beard reddish; but this depends on the sign, unless he be with fixed stars of his own nature, such as <i>Aldebaran</i>, <i>the Lion's Heart</i>, &amp;c. In earthy signs it is a sad brown; in watery, lighter or flaxen; in airy, curling or crisping; in fiery, strong and wiry. He is strong, broad shouldered, proud, scornful, drunken, and debauched with a mark or scar, generally in the face.</p>  
 <p>☉ denotes a round full face; sanguine complexion; short chin; curling hair; fair, comely, sometimes swarthy or bronzed; bold, ambitious, vain, slow of speech; outwardly decent, but secretly vicious and lascivious.</p>  
 <p>♀ gives a fair, round face; full or large eyes; red, plump lips, the lower larger than the upper; black eyelids, smooth brown hair; person well-shaped and handsome; rather short than tall; face pleasing, with smiles and dimples.</p>

 <p>☽ a round face, more white than red; in watery signs, freckled; and if in ♋, and in no aspect to ♂ or ☉, very pale and white, or wan--a person generally short and full; and one who is dull and heavy, and also very vulgar and ill-mannered.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_115"></a><a href="aia33.htm#fr_116">233:1</a> We should rather consider that ☿ in ♊ aspecting the cusp of the 7th; and the ☽, the <i>man's</i> general significator, being in ♎ and aspecting ♃, shewed his tallness. ♊ and ♎ are tall signs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_116"></a><a href="aia33.htm#fr_117">247:1</a> The well-known instance of a military siege, the capture of the Castle of Antwerp, being so applicable to this question, and the time of its commencement by the opening of the trenches being so well authenticated, we are induced to offer to the student's notice a figure we erected for that time.</p>
