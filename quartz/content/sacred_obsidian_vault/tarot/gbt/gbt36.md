 <p>TRADITION: Servant, inferior, mercenary man, commissioner; interior of a house, the household; it is also said to denote great news and expectation, hope and trust, but sometimes not without some misgivings or a slight apprehension of treachery.</p>  
 <p>THEORY: It is <i>Air</i> on the house of Virgo, the <i>Sixth</i>, house of the servants and work, of exact science and the academy, of health and food, of the art of decoration and the interior of the house, as well as of the retail dealer. The element of thought (Air) on the earthy house of Virgo must naturally bring forth knowledge of every detail and reveal mistakes or shortcomings; it promotes efficiency, and the latter is one of the principal meanings of the card. Here again is a double mercurial expression, so this card must denote special abilities, capacities, technical insight; moreover food questions and medicine, medicaments and nursing; practical arrangement of details, but as Virgo "kills the prophets," this card may contain some or other discrepancy in the philosophical or logical, theoretical or strictly just side of things.</p>  
 <p>CONCLUSION: <i>Knowledge, exact and academical, decorative art, efficiency, work, servitude and servants, practical solution of problems, but at the same time perhaps some discrepancy; food, medicine, treatment, experiment;</i> it may relate to <i>persons in every subordinate position and to retail tradesmen;</i> the personal attitude under this card is rather passive and indeed that of <i>expectation, attention, waiting for orders or for the result of experiments, for the answer on question or demand; solicitation</i>.</p>
