 <p><font size="-1" color="green">This is a parallel presentation of the three texts of the poem <i>A Visit from St. Nicholas</i>. It will be seen that aside from minor punctuation and spelling differences, the texts are exactly the same. The one place where there is any real difference is the names of the last two reindeer.JBH.</font></p>  <table border="1">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">
