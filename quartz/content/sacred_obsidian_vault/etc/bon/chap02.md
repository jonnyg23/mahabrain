   GOTHAMITE DROLLERIES, WITH VARIANTS<br>
   AND ANALOGUES.</p>
 
   <p align="left">
   <img border="0" src="images/image007.png" alt="I" width="97" height="98">T seems to have been common to most countries, from very ancient times, for the inhabitants of a
   particular district, town, or village to be popularly regarded as pre-eminently foolish, arrant noodles or
   simpletons. The Greeks had their stories of the silly sayings and doings of the people of Bæotia, Sidonia, Abdera,
   etc. Among the Perso-Arabs the folk of Hums (ancient Emessa) are reputed to be exceedingly stupid. The Kabaïl, or
   wandering tribes of Northern Africa, consider the Beni Jennad as little better than idiots. The Schildburgers are the
   noodles of German popular tales. In Switzerland the townsmen of Belmont, near Lausanne, are typical blockheads. And
   England has her "men of Gotham"--a village in Nottinghamshire--who are credited with most of the noodle
   stories which have been current among the people</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.17"><font color="#0000ff">p.17</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">for centuries past, though other places share to some extent in their not very enviable reputation:
   in Yorkshire the "carles'' of Austwick, in Craven; some villages near Marlborough Downs, in Wiltshire;
   and in the counties of Sutherland and Ross, the people of Assynt.</p>
 
   <p align="left">But long before the men of Gotham were held up to ridicule as fools, a similar class of stories had
   been told of the men of Norfolk, as we learn from a curious Latin poem, <i>Descriptio Norfolciensium,</i> written,
   probably, near the end of the twelfth century, by a monk of Peterborough, which is printed in Wright's <i>Early
   Mysteries and Other Latin Poems.</i> This poem sets out with stating that Cæsar having despatched messengers
   throughout the provinces to discover which were bad and which were good, on their return they reported Norfolk as the
   most sterile, and the people the vilest and different from all other peoples. Among the stories related of the
   stupidity of the men of Norfolk is the following: Being oppressed by their lord, they gave him a large sum of money
   on condition that he should relieve them from future burdens, and he gave them his bond to that effect, sealed with a
   seal of green wax. To celebrate this, they all went to the tavern and got drunk. When it became dark, they</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.18"><font color="#0000ff">p.18</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">had no candle, and were puzzled how to procure one, till a clever fellow among the revellers
   suggested that they should use the wax seal of the bond for a candle--they should still have the words of the bond,
   which their lord could not repudiate; so they made the wax seal into a candle, and burned it while they continued
   their merry-making. This exploit coming to the knowledge of their lord, he reimposes the old burdens on the rustics,
   who complain of his injustice, at the same time producing the bond. The lord calls a clerk to examine the document,
   who pronounces it to be null and void in the absence of the lord's seal, and so their oppression continues.</p>
 
   <p align="left">Another story is of a man of Norfolk who put some honey in a jar, and in his absence his dog came and
   ate it all up. When he returned home and was told of this, he took the dog and forced him to disgorge the honey, put
   it back into the jar, and took it to market. A customer having examined the honey, declared it to be putrid.
   "Well," said the simpleton, "it was in a vessel that was not very clean."--Wright has pointed out
   that this reappears in an English jest-book of the seventeenth century. "A cleanly woman of Cambridgeshire made
   a good store of butter, and whilst she went a little way out</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.19"><font color="#0000ff">p.19</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">of the town about some earnest occasions, a neighbour's dog came in in the meantime, and eat up
   half the butter. Being come home, her maid told her what the dog had done, and that she had locked him up in the
   dairy-house. So she took the dog and hang'd him up by the heels till she had squeez'd all the butter out of
   his throat again, whilst she, pretty, cleanly soul, took and put it to the rest of the butter, and made it up for
   Cambridge market. But her maid told her she was ashamed to see such a nasty trick done. 'Hold your peace, you
   fool!' says she; ''tis good enough for schollards. Away with it to market!'"[1]--Perhaps the
   original form is found in the <i>Philogelos Hieraclis et Philagrii Facetiœ,</i> edited by Eberhard. A citizen of
   Cumæ was selling honey. Some one came up and tasted it, and said that it was all bad. He replied, "If a mouse
   had not fallen into it, I would not sell it."</p>
 
   <p align="left">The well-known Gothamite jest of the man who put a sack of meal on his own shoulders to save his
   horse, and then got on the animal's back and rode home, had been previously told of a man of Norfolk, thus:</p>

   <blockquote>
     <p align="left">"Ad foram ambulant diebus singulis;<br>
      Saccum de lolio portant in humeris,<br>
      Jumentis ne noccant: bene fatuis,<br>
      Ut prolocutiis sum acquantur bestiis."</p>
   </blockquote>
 
   <p align="left">It reappears in the <i>Bizarrures</i> of the Sieur Gaulard:[1] "Seeing one day his mule charged
   with a verie great Portmantle, [he] said to his groome that was vpon the back of the mule, thou lasie fellowe, hast
   thou no pitie vpon that poore Beast? Take that port-mantle vpon thine owne shoulders to ease the poore Beast."
   And in our own time it is told of an Irish exciseman with a keg of smuggled whisky.</p>
 
   <p align="left">How such stories came to be transferred to the men of Gotham, it were fruitless to inquire.[2]
   Similar jests have been long current in other countries of Europe and throughout Asia, and accident or malice may
   have fixed the stigma of stupidity on any particular spot. There is probably no ground whatever for crediting the
   tale of the origin of the proverb, "As wise as the men</p>

   <p align="left">of Gotham," although it is reproduced in Thoroton's <i>Nottinghamshire,</i> i. 42-3:</p>
 
   <p align="left">"King John, intending to pass through this place, towards Nottingham, was prevented by the
   inhabitants, they apprehending that the ground over which a king passed was for ever after to become a public road.
   The King, incensed at their proceedings, sent from his court soon afterwards some of his servants to inquire of them
   the reason of their incivility and ill-treatment, that he might punish them. The villagers, hearing of the approach
   of the King's servants, thought of an expedient to turn away his Majesty's displeasure from them. When the
   messengers arrived at Gotham, they found some of the inhabitants engaged in endeavouring to drown an eel in a pool of
   water; some were employed in dragging carts upon a large barn to shade the wood from the sun; and others were engaged
   in hedging a cuckoo, which had perched itself upon an old bush. In short, they were all employed in some foolish way
   or other, which convinced the King's servants that it was a village of fools."</p>
 
   <p align="left">The fooleries ascribed to the men of Gotham were probably first collected and printed in the
   sixteenth century; but that jests of the "fools of Gotham" were current among the people long before that
   period is</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.22"><font color="#0000ff">p.22</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">evident from a reference to them in the <i>Widkirk Miracle Plays,</i> the only existing MS. of which
   was written about the reign of Henry VI.:</p>
 
   <blockquote>
     <p align="left">"Foles al sam;<br>
      Sagh I never none so fare<br>
      Bote the foles of Gotham."</p>
   </blockquote>
 
   <p align="left">The oldest known copy of the <i>Merie Tales of the Mad Men of Gotam</i> was printed in 1630, and is
   preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Warton, in his <i>History of English Poetry,</i> mentions an edition,
   which he says was printed about 1568, by Henry Wikes, but he had never seen it. But Mr. Halliwell (now
   Halliwell-Phillips), in his <i>Notices of Popular English Histories,</i> cites one still earlier, which he thinks was
   probably printed between 1556 and 1566: "Merie Tales of the Mad Men of Gotam, gathered together by A.B., of
   Phisike Doctour. [colophon:] Imprinted at London, in Flet-Stret, beneath the Conduit, at the signe of S. John
   Evangelist, by Thomas Colwell, n. d. 12°, black letter." The book is mentioned in <i>A Briefe and Necessary
   Introduction,</i> etc., by E.D. (8vo, 1572), among a number of other folk-books: "Bevis of Hampton, Guy of
   Warwicke, Arthur of the Round Table, Huon of Bourdeaux, Oliver of the Castle,</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.23"><font color="#0000ff">p.23</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">The Four Sonnes of Amond, The Witles Devices of Gargantua, Howleglas, Esop, Robyn Hoode, Adam Bell,
   Frier Rushe, The Fooles of Gotham, and a thousand such other."[1] And Anthony a Wood, in his <i>Athenœ
   Oxonienses</i> (1691-2), says it was "printed at London in the time of K. Hen. 8, in whose reign and after it
   was accounted a book full of wit and mirth by scholars and gentlemen. Afterwards being often printed, [it] is now
   sold only on the stalls of ballad-singers." It is likely that the estimation in which the book was held "by
   scholars and gentlemen" was not a little due to the supposition that "A.B., of Phisike Doctour," by
   whom the tales were said to have been "gathered together," was none other than Andrew Borde, or Boorde, a
   Carthusian friar before the Reformation, one of the physicians to Henry VIII., a great traveller, even beyond the
   bounds of Christendom, "a thousand or two and more myles," a man of great learning, withal "of fame
   facete.'' For to Borde have the <i>Merie Tales of the Mad Men of Gotham</i> been generally ascribed down to
   our own times. There is, however, as Dr. F.J. Furnivall justly remarks, "no good external evidence that the
   book</p>
 
   <p align="left"><font color="#008000">[1] Collier's <i>Bibliographical Account,</i> etc., vol. i., p.
   327.</font></p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.24"><font color="#0000ff">p.24</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">was written by Borde, while the internal evidence is against his authorship."[1] In short, the
   ascription of its compilation to "A.B., of Phisike Doctour," was clearly a device of the printer to sell
   the book.[2]</p>
 
   <p align="left">The <i>Tales of the Mad Men of Gotham</i> continued to be printed as a chap-book down to the close of
   the first quarter of the present century; and much harmless mirth they must have caused at cottage firesides in
   remote rural districts occasionally visited by the ubiquitous pedlar, in whose well-filled pack of all kinds of petty
   merchandise such drolleries were sure to be found. Unlike other old collections of facetiae, the little work is
   remarkably free from objectionable stories; some are certainly not very brilliant, having, indeed, nothing in them
   particularly "Gothamite," and one or two seem to have been adapted from the Italian novelists. Of the
   twenty tales comprised in the collection, the first is certainly one of the most humorous:</p>

   Scogin</i> or <i>The Mylner of Abyngton,</i> the latter an imitation of Chaucer's <i>Reve's
   Tale.</i></font></p>

   <p align="left">of them was going to the market at Nottingham to buy sheep, and the other was coming from the market,
   and both met on Nottingham bridge. "Well met!" said the one to the other. "Whither are you
   a-going?" said he that came from Nottingham. "Marry," said he that was going thither, "I am going
   to the market to buy sheep." "Buy sheep!" said the other. "And which way will you bring them
   home?" "Marry," said the other, "I will bring them over this bridge." "By Robin
   Hood," said he that came from Nottingham, "but thou shalt not." "By Maid Marian," said he
   that was going thither, "but I will." "Thou shalt not," said the one. "I will," said
   the other. Then they beat their staves against the ground, one against the other, as if there had been a hundred
   sheep betwixt them. "Hold them there," said the one. "Beware of the leaping over the bridge of my
   sheep," said the other. "They shall all come this way," said one. "But they shall not," said
   the other. And as they were in contention, another wise man that belonged to Gotham came from the market, with a sack
   of meal upon his horse; and seeing and hearing his neighbours at strife about sheep, and none betwixt them, said he,
   "Ah, fools, will you never learn wit? Then help me," said he that had the meal,</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.26"><font color="#0000ff">p.26</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">"and lay this sack upon my shoulder." They did so, and he went to the one side of the
   bridge and unloosed the mouth of the sack, and did shake out all the meal into the river. Then said he, "How
   much meal is there in the sack, neighbours?" "Marry," answered they, "none." "Now, by
   my faith," answered this wise man, "even so much wit is there in your two heads to strive for the thing
   which you have not." Now which was the wisest of these three persons, I leave you to judge.</p>
 
   <p align="left">Allusions to these tales are of frequent occurrence in our literature of the sixteenth and
   seventeenth centuries. Dekker, in his <i>Gul's Horn Book</i> (1609), says, "It is now high time for me to
   have a blow at thy head, which I will not cut off with sharp documents, but rather set it on faster, bestowing upon
   it such excellent serving that if all the wise men of Gotham should lay their heads together, their jobbernowls
   should not be able to compare with thine;" and Wither, in his <i>Abuses,</i> says,</p>
 
   <blockquote>
     <p align="left">"And he that tryes to doe it might have bin<br>
      One of the crew that hedged the cuckoo in,"</p>
   </blockquote>
 
   <p align="left">alluding to one of the most famous exploits of the wittols:</p>
 
   <p align="left">On a time the men of Gotham would have</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.27"><font color="#0000ff">p.27</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">pinned in the cuckoo, whereby she should sing all the year, and in the midst of the town they made a
   hedge round in compass, and they had got a cuckoo, and had put her into it, and said, "Sing here all the year,
   and thou shalt lack neither meat nor drink." The cuckoo, as soon as she perceived herself encompassed within the
   hedge, flew away. "A vengeance on her!" said they. "We made not our hedge high enough."</p>
 
   <p align="left">The tales had, however, attained popular favour much earlier. Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps has pointed out
   that in <i>Philotimus</i> (1583) the men of Gotham are remembered as having "tied their rentes in a purse about
   an hare's necke, and bade her to carrie it to their landlord," an excellent plan, which is thus
   described:</p>
 
   <p align="left">On a time the men of Gotham had forgotten to pay their rent to their landlord. The one said to the
   other, "To-morrow is our payday, and what remedy shall we find to send our money to our lord?" The one
   said, "This day I have taken a quick [<i>i.e.,</i> live] hare, and she shall carry it, for she is light of
   foot." "Be it so," said all. "She shall have a letter and a purse to put in our money, and we
   shall direct her the ready way." And when the letters were written, and the money</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.28"><font color="#0000ff">p.28</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">put in a purse, they did tie them about the hare's neck, saying, "First thou must go to
   Loughborough, and then to Leicester; and at Newark there is our lord, and commend us to him, and there is his duty
   [<i>i.e.,</i> due]." The hare, as soon as she was out of their hands, she did run a clean contrary way. Some
   cried to her, saying, "Thou must go to Loughborough first." Some said, "Let the hare alone; she can
   tell a nearer way than the best of us all do: let her go." Another said, "It is a noble hare; let her
   alone; she will not keep the highway for fear of the dogs."</p>
 
   <p align="left">The well-worn "Joe Miller" of the Irishman who tried to count the party to which he
   belonged, and always forgot to count himself, which is also known in Russia and in the West Highlands of Scotland, is
   simply a variant of this drollery:</p>
 
   <p align="left">On a certain day there were twelve men of Gotham that went to fish, and some stood on dry land; and
   in going home one said to the other, "We have ventured wonderfully in wading: I pray God that none of us come
   home and be drowned." "Nay, marry," said one to the other, "let us see that; for there did twelve
   of us come out." Then they told (<i>i.e.,</i> counted) themselves, and every one told eleven. Said one to the
   other, "There is</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.29"><font color="#0000ff">p.29</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">one of us drowned." They went back to the brook where they had been fishing, and sought up and
   down for him that was wanting, making great lamentation. A courtier, coming by, asked what it was they sought for,
   and why they were sorrowful. "Oh," said they, "this day we went to fish in the brook; twelve of
   <i>us</i> came out together, and one is drowned." Said the courtier, "Tell [count] how many there be of
   you." One of them said, "Eleven," and he did not tell himself. "Well," said the courtier,
   "what will you give me, and I will find the twelfth man?" "Sir," said they, "all the money
   we have got." "Give me the money," said the courtier, and began with the first, and gave him a stroke
   over the shoulders with his whip, which made him groan, saying, "Here is one," and so served them all, and
   they all groaned at the matter. When he came to the last, he paid him well, saying, "Here is the twelfth
   man." "God's blessing on thy heart," said they, "for thus finding our dear brother!"</p>
 
   <p align="left">This droll adventure is also found in the <i>Gooroo Paramartan,</i> a most amusing work, written in
   the Tamil language by Beschi, an Italian Jesuit, who was missionary in India from 1700 till his death, in 1742. The
   Gooroo (teacher) and his five disciples, who are,</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.30"><font color="#0000ff">p.30</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">like himself, noodles, come to a river which they have to cross, and which, as the Gooroo informs
   them, is a very dangerous stream. To ascertain whether it is at present "asleep," one of them dips his
   lighted cheroot in the water, which, of course, extinguishes it, upon which he returns to the Gooroo and reports that
   the river is still in a dangerous mood. So they all sit down, and begin to tell stories of the destructive nature of
   this river. One relates how his grandfather and another man were journeying together, driving two asses laden with
   bags of salt, and coming to this river, they resolved to bathe in it, and the asses, tempted by the coolness of the
   water, at the same time knelt down in it. When the men found that their salt had disappeared, they congratulated
   themselves on their wonderful escape from the devouring stream, which had eaten up all their salt without even
   opening the bags. Another disciple relates a story similar to the so-called Æsopian fable of the dog and his shadow,
   this river being supposed to have devoured a piece of meat which the dog had dropped into it. At length the river is
   found to be quiescent, a piece of charred wood having been plunged into it without producing any effect like that of
   the former experiment; and they determine to ford it, but with great caution. Arrived on the other side, they
   count</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.31"><font color="#0000ff">p.31</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">their number, like the men of Gotham, and discover that one is not present. A traveller, coming up,
   finds the missing man by whacking each of them over the shoulder. The Gooroo, while gratified that the lost one was
   found, was grumbling at his sore bones--for the traveller had struck pretty hard--when an old woman, on learning of
   their adventure, told them that, in her young days, she and her female companions were once returning home from a
   grand festival, and adopted another plan for ascertaining if they were all together. Gathering some of the
   cattle-droppings, they kneaded them into a cake, in which they each made a mark with the tip of the nose, and then
   counted the marks--a plan which the Gooroo and his disciples should make use of on future occasions.</p>
 
   <p align="left">The Abbe Dubois has given a French translation of the Adventures of the Gooroo Paramartan among the
   <i>Contes Divers</i> appended to his not very valuable selection of tales and apologues from Tamil, Telegu, and
   Cannada versions of the <i>Panchatantra</i> (Five Chapters, not "Cinq Ruses," as he renders it), a Sanskrit
   form of the celebrated Fables of Bidpaï, or Pilpay. An English rendering of Beschi's work, by Babington, forms
   one of the publications of the Oriental Translation Fund. Dubois states that he found</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.32"><font color="#0000ff">p.32</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">the tales of the Gooroo current in Indian countries where Beschi's name was unknown, and he had
   no doubt of their Indian origin. However this may be, the work was probably designed, as Babington thinks, to
   satirise the Bráhmans, as well as to furnish a pleasing vehicle of instruction to those Jesuits in India whose duties
   required a knowledge of the Tamil language.</p>
 
   <p align="left">A story akin to that of the Gothamite fishers, if not, indeed, an older form of it, is told in
   Iceland of the Three Brothers of Bakki, who came upon one of the hot springs which abound in that volcanic island,
   and taking off their boots and stockings, put their feet into the water and began to bathe them. When they would rise
   up, they were perplexed to know each his own feet, and so they sat disconsolate, until a wayfarer chanced to pass by,
   to whom they told their case, when he soon relieved their minds by striking the feet of each, for which important
   service they gave him many thanks.[1] This story reappears, slightly modified, in Campbell's <i>Popular Tales of
   the West Highlands:</i> A party of masons, engaged in building a dyke, take shelter during a heavy shower, and when
   it has passed, they continue sitting, because</p>
 
   <p align="left"><font color="#008000">[1] Powell and Magnusson's <i>Legends of Iceland,</i> Second

   <p align="left">their legs had got mixed together, and none knew his own, until they were put right by a traveller
   with a big stick. We have here an evident relic of the Norsemen's occupation of the Hebrides.</p>
 
   <p align="left">Several of the tales of the Gothamites are found almost unaltered in Gaelic. That of the twelve
   fishers has been already mentioned, and here is the story of the attempt to drown an eel, which Campbell gives in
   similar terms in his <i>Tales of the West Highlands:</i></p>
 
   <p align="left">When that Good Friday was come, the men of Gotham did cast their heads together what to do with their
   white herring, their red herring, their sprats, and salt fish. One consulted with the other, and agreed that such
   fish should be cast into a pond or pool (the which was in the middle of the town), that it might increase the next
   year; and every man did cast them into the pool. The one said, "I have thus many white herrings;" another
   said, "I have thus many sprats;" another said, "I have thus many salt fishes; let us all go together
   into the pool, and we shall fare like lords the next Lent." At the beginning of next Lent the men did draw the
   pond, to have their fish, and there was nothing but a great eel. "Ah," said they all, "a mischief</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.34"><font color="#0000ff">p.34</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">on this eel, for he hath eat up all our fish!" "What shall we do with him?" said the
   one to the other. "Kill him!" said one of them. "Chop him all to pieces!" said another.
   "Nay, not so," said the other; "let us drown him." "Be it so," said all. They went to
   another pool, and did cast the eel into the water. "Lie there," said they, "and shift for thyself, for
   no help thou shalt have of us;" and there they left the eel to be drowned.</p>
 
   <p align="left">Campbell's Gaelic story differs so little from the above that we must suppose it to have been
   derived directly from the English chap-book. Oral tradition always produces local variations from a written story, of
   which we have an example in a Gaelic version of this choice exploit:</p>
 
   <p align="left">There was a man of Gotham who went to the market of Nottingham to sell cheese; and as he was going
   down the hill to Nottingham Bridge, one of his cheeses fell out of his wallet and ran down the hill. "Ah,"
   said the fellow, "can you run to the market alone? I will now send one after the other;" then laying down
   the wallet and taking out the cheeses, he tumbled them down the hill one after the other; and some ran into one bush,
   and some into another; so at last he said, "I do charge you to meet me in the market-place."</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.35"><font color="#0000ff">p.35</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">And when the man came into the market to meet the cheeses, he stayed until the market was almost
   done, then went and inquired of his neighbours and other men if they did see his cheeses come to market. "Why,
   who should bring them?" said one of the neighbours. "Marry, themselves," said the fellow; "they
   knew the way well enough," said he: "a vengeance on them! For I was afraid to see my cheeses run so fast,
   that they would run beyond the market. I am persuaded that they are at this time almost as far as York." So he
   immediately takes a horse and rides after them to York; but to this day no man has ever heard of the cheeses.</p>
 
   <p align="left">In one Gaelic variant a woman is going to Inverness with a basket filled with balls of worsted of her
   own spinning, and going down a hill, one of the balls tumbles out and rolls along briskly, upon which she sends the
   others after it, holding the ends of each in her hand; and when she reaches the town, she finds a "ravelled
   hank" instead of her neat balls of worsted. In another version a man goes to market with two bags of cheese, and
   sends them downhill, like the Gothamite. After waiting at the market all day in vain, he returns home, and tells his
   wife of his misfortune. She goes to the foot of the hill and finds all the cheese.</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.36"><font color="#0000ff">p.36</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">The next Gothamite tale also finds its counterpart in the Gaelic stories: There was a man of Gotham
   who bought at Nottingham a trivet, or brandiron, and as he was going home his shoulders grew sore with the carriage
   thereof, and he set it down; and seeing that it had three feet, he said, "Ha! hast thou three feet, and I but
   two? Thou shalt bear me home, if thou wilt," and set himself down thereupon, and said to the trivet, "Bear
   me as long as I have borne thee; but if thou do not, thou shalt stand still for me." The man of Gotham did see
   that his trivet would not go farther. "Stand still, in the mayor's name," said he, "and follow me
   if thou wilt. I will tell thee right the way to my home." When he did come to his house, his wife said,
   "Where is my trivet?" The man said, "He hath three legs, and I have but two; and I did teach him the
   way to my house. Let him come home if he will." "Where left ye the trivet?" said the woman. "At
   Gotham hill," said the man. His wife did run and fetch home the trivet her own self, or else she had lost it
   through her husband's wit.</p>
 
   <p align="left">In Campbell's version a man having been sent by his wife with her spinning-wheel to get mended,
   as he was returning home with it the wind set the wheel in motion, so he put it down, and bidding it go straight to
   his house,</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.37"><font color="#0000ff">p.37</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">set off himself. When he reached home, he asked his wife if the spinning-wheel had arrived yet, and
   on her replying that it had not, "I thought as much," quoth he, "for I took the shorter way."</p>
 
   <p align="left">A somewhat similar story is found in Rivière's French collection of tales of the Kabaïl, Algeria,
   to this effect: The mother of a youth of the Beni-Jennad clan gave him a hundred reals to buy a mule; so he went to
   market, and on his way met a man carrying a water-melon for sale. "How much for the melon?" he asks.
   "What will you give?'' says the man. "I have only got a hundred reals," answered the booby;
   "had I more, you should have it." "Well," rejoined the man, "I'll take them." Then
   the youth took the melon and handed over the money. "But tell me," says he, "will its young one be as
   green as it is?" "Doubtless," answered the man, "it will be green." As the booby was going
   home, he allowed the melon to roll down a slope before him. It burst on its way, when up started a frightened hare.
   "Go to my house, young one," he shouted. "Surely a green animal has come out of it." And when he
   got home, he inquired of his mother if the young one had arrived.</p>
 
   <p align="left">In the <i>Gooroo Paramartan</i> there is a parallel incident to this last. The noodles are
   desirous</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.38"><font color="#0000ff">p.38</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">of providing their Gooroo with a horse, and a man sells them a pumpkin, telling them it is a
   mare's egg, which only requires to be sat upon for a certain time to produce a fine young horse. The Gooroo
   himself undertakes to hatch the mare's egg, since his disciples have all other matters to attend to; but as they
   are carrying it through a jungle, it falls down and splits into pieces; just then a frightened hare runs before them;
   and they inform the Gooroo that a fine young colt came out of the mare's egg, with very long ears, and ran off
   with the speed of the wind. It would have proved a fine horse for their revered Gooroo, they add; but he consoles
   himself for the loss by reflecting that such an animal would probably have run away with him.</p>
 
   <p align="left">A number of the Gothamite tales in the printed collection are not only inferior to those which are
   preserved orally, but can be considered in no sense examples of preeminent folly. Three consist of tricks played by
   women upon their husbands, such as are found in the ordinary jest-books of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
   In one a man, who had taken a buzzard, invites some friends to dine with him. His wife, with two of her gossips,
   having secretly eaten the buzzard,</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.39"><font color="#0000ff">p.39</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">kills and cooks an old goose, and sets it before him and his guests; the latter call him a knave to
   mock them thus with an old goose, and go off in great anger. The husband, resolved to put himself right with his
   friends, stuffs the buzzard's feathers into a sack, in order to show them that they were mistaken in thinking he
   had tried to deceive them with an old goose instead of a fine fat buzzard. But before he started on this business,
   his wife contrived to substitute the goose's feathers, which he exhibited to his friends as those of the buzzard,
   and was soundly cudgelled for what they believed to be a second attempt to mock them.--Two other stories seem to be
   derived from the Italian novelists: of the man who intended cutting off his wife's hair[1] and of the man who
   defied his wife to cuckold him. Two others turn upon wrong responses at a christening and a marriage, which have
   certainly nothing Gothamite in them. Another is a dull story of a Scotchman who employed a carver to make him as a
   sign of his inn a boar's head, the tradesman supposing from his northern pronunciation</p>
 
   <p align="left"><font color="#008000">[1] An imitation of Boccaccio, <i>Decameron,</i> Day vii., nov. 8, who perhaps
   borrowed the story from Guérin's <i>fabliau</i> "De la Dame qui fit accroire à son Mari qu'il avait

   <p align="left">that he meant a <i>bare</i> head.--In the nineteenth tale, a party of gossips are assembled at the
   alehouse, and each relates in what manner she is profitable to her husband: one saves candles by sending all her
   household to bed in daylight; another, like the old fellow and Tib his wife in <i>Jolly Good Ale and Old,</i> eats
   little meat, but can swig a gallon or two of ale, and so forth.</p>
 
   <p align="left">We have, however, our Gothamite once more in the story of him who, seeing a fine cheese on the ground
   as he rode along the highway, tried to pick it up with his sword, and finding his sword too short, rode back to fetch
   a longer one for his purpose, but when he returned, he found the cheese was gone. "A murrain take it!"
   quoth he. "If I had had this sword, I had had this cheese myself, and now another hath got it!" Also in the
   smith who took a red-hot iron bar and thrust it into the thatch of his smithy to destroy a colony of wasps, and, of
   course, burned down the smithy--a story which has done duty in modern days to "point a moral" in the form
   of a teetotal tract, with a drunken smith in place of the honest Gothamite![1]</p>
 
   <p align="left"><font color="#008000">[1] A slightly different version occurs in the <i>Tale of Beryn,</i> which is

   <p align="left">The following properly belongs to stories of the "silly son" class: There was a young man
   of Gotham the which should go wooing to a fair maid. His mother did warn him beforehand, saying, "When thou dost
   look upon her, cast a sheep's-eye, and say, 'How do ye, sweet pigsnie?'" The fellow went to the
   butcher's and bought seven or eight sheep's eyes; and when this lusty wooer did sit at dinner, he would cast
   in her face a sheep's eye, saying, "How dost thou, my pretty pigsnie?" "How do I?" said the
   wench. "Swine's-face, why dost thou cast the sheep's eye upon me?" "O sweet pigsnie, have at
   thee another!" "I defy thee, Swine's-face," said the wench. The fellow, being abashed; said,
   "What, sweet pigsnie! Be content, for if thou do live until the next year, thou wilt be a foul sow."
   "Walk, knave, walk!" said she; "for if thou live till the</p>

   <p align="left">It is very evident that the men of Gotham were of "honest " Jack Falstaff's opinion
   that the better part of valour is discretion: On a time there was a man of Gotham a-mowing in the meads and found a
   great grasshopper. He cast down his scythe, and did run home to his neighbours, and said that there was a devil in
   the field that hopped in the grass. Then there was every man ready with clubs and staves, with halberts, and with
   other weapons, to go and kill the grasshopper. When they did come to the place where the grasshopper should be, said
   the one to the other, "Let every man cross himself from the devil, or we will not meddle with him." And so
   they returned again, and said, "We were all blessed this day that we went no farther." "Ah,
   cowards," said he that had his scythe in the mead, "help me to fetch my scythe." "No," said
   they; "it is good to sleep in a whole skin: better it is to lose thy scythe than to mar us all."</p>
 
   <p align="left">There is some spice of humour in the concluding tale of the printed collection, although it has no
   business there: On Ash Wednesday the priest said to the men of Gotham, "If I should enjoin you to prayer, there
   is none of you that can say your paternoster;</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.43"><font color="#0000ff">p.43</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">and you be now too old to learn. And to enjoin you to fast were foolishness, for you do not eat a
   good meal's meat in a year. Wherefore do I enjoin thee to labour all the week, that thou mayest fare well to dine
   on Sunday, and I will come to dinner and see it to be so, and take my dinner." Another man he did enjoin to fare
   well on Monday, and another on Tuesday, and one after another that one or other should fare well once a week, that he
   might have part of his meat. "And as for alms," said the priest, "ye be beggars all, except one or
   two; therefore bestow alms on yourselves."</p>
 
   <p align="left">Among the numerous stories of the Gothamites preserved orally, but not found in the collection of
   "A.B., of Phisicke Doctour," is the following, which seems to be of Indian extraction:</p>
 
   <p align="left">One day some men of Gotham were walking by the riverside, and came to a place where the contrary
   currents caused the water to boil as in a whirlpool. "See how the water boils!" says one. "If we had
   plenty of oatmeal," says another, "we might make enough porridge to serve all the village for a
   month." So it was resolved that part of them should go to the village and fetch their oatmeal, which was soon
   brought and thrown</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.44"><font color="#0000ff">p.44</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">into the river. But there presently arose the question of how they were to know when the porridge was
   ready. This difficulty was overcome by the offer of one of the company to jump in, and it was agreed that if he found
   it ready for use, he should signify the same to his companions. The man jumped in, and found the water deeper than he
   expected. Thrice he rose to the surface, but said nothing. The others, impatient at his remaining so long silent, and
   seeing him smack his lips, took this for an avowal that the porridge was good, and so they all jumped in after him
   and were drowned.</p>
 
   <p align="left">Another traditional Gothamite story is related of a villager coming home at a late hour and, seeing
   the reflection of the moon in a horse-pond, believed it to be a green cheese, and roused all his neighbours to help
   him to draw it out. They raked and raked away until a passing cloud sank the cheese, when they returned to their
   homes grievously disappointed.[1]--This is also related of the</p>
 
   <p align="left"><font color="#008000">[1] There is an analogous Indian story of a youth who went to a tank to drink,
   and observing the reflection of a golden-crested bird that was sitting on a tree, he thought it was gold in the
   water, and entered the tank to take it up, but he could not lay hold of it as it appeared and disappeared in the
   water. But as often as he ascended the bank he again saw it in the water,</font></p>

   <p align="left">villagers near the Marlborough Downs, in Wiltshire, and the <i>sobriquet</i> of
   "moon-rakers," applied to Wiltshire folk in general, is said to have had its origin in the incident; but
   they assert that it was a keg of smuggled brandy, which had been sunk in a pond, that the villagers were attempting
   to fish up, when the exciseman coming suddenly upon the scene, they made him believe they were raking the reflection
   of the moon, thinking it a green cheese, an explanation which is on</p>
 
   <p align="left"><font color="#008000">and again he entered the tank to lay hold
   of it, and still he got nothing. At length his father saw and questioned him, then drove away the bird, and
   explaining the matter to him, took the foolish fellow home.</font></p>
 
   <p align="left"><font color="#008000">We have already seen that the men of Abdera (p. 5) flogged an ass before its
   fellows for upsetting a jar of olive oil, but what is that compared with the story of the ass that drank up the moon?
   According to Ludovicus Vives, a learned Spanish writer, certain townspeople imprisoned an ass for drinking up the
   moon, whose reflection, appearing in the water, was covered with a cloud while the ass was drinking. Next day the
   poor beast was brought to the bar to be sentenced according to his deserts. After the grave burghers had discussed
   the affair for some time, one at length rose up and declared that it was not fit the town should lose its moon, but
   rather that the ass should be cut open and the moon he had swallowed taken out of him, which, being cordially
   approved by the others, was done accordingly.</font></p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.46"><font color="#0000ff">p.46</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">a par with the apocryphal tale of the Gothamites and the messengers of King John.</p>
 
   <p align="left">The absurd notion of the moon being a tine cheese is of very respectable antiquity, and occurs in the
   noodle-stories of many countries. It is referred to by Rabelais, and was doubtless the subject of a popular French
   tale in his time. In the twenty-second story of the <i>Disciplines Clericalis</i> of Peter Alfonsus, a Spanish Jew,
   who was baptised in 1106, a fox leaves a wolf in a well, looking after a supposed cheese, made by the image of the
   moon in the water; and the same fable had been told by the Talmudists in the fifth century.[1] The well-known
   "Joe Miller" of the party of Irishmen who endeavoured to reach a "green cheese" in the river by
   hanging one by another's legs finds its parallel in a Mecklenburg story, in which some men by the same
   contrivance tried to get a stone from the bottom of a well, and the incident is thus related in the old English
   jest-book entitled <i>The Sacke Full of Newes:</i></p>
 
   <p align="left">There were three young men going to Lambeth along by the waterside, and one played with the other,
   and they cast each other's caps into the water in such sort as they could not get their caps again. But over the
   place</p>
 
   <p align="left"><font color="#008000">[1] This is also one of the Fables of Marie de France (thirteenth
   century).</font></p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.47"><font color="#0000ff">p.47</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">where their caps were did grow a great old tree, the which did cover a great deal of the water. One
   of them said to the rest, "Sirs, I have found a notable way to come by them. First I will make myself fast by
   the middle with one of your girdles unto the tree, and he that is with you shall hang fast upon my girdle, and he
   that is last shall take hold on him that holds fast on my girdle, and so with one of his hands he may take up all our
   caps, and cast them on the sand." And so they did; but when they thought that they had been most secure and
   fast, he that was above felt his girdle slack, and said, "Soft, sirs! My girdle slacketh." "Make it
   fast quickly," said they. But as he was untying it to make it faster they fell all three into the water, and
   were well washed for their pains.</p>
 
   <p align="left">Closely allied to these tales is the Russian story of the old man who planted a cabbage-head in the
   cellar, under the floor of his cottage, and, strange to say, it grew right up to the sky. He climbs up the
   cabbage-stalk till he reaches the sky. There he sees a mill, which gives a turn, and out come a pie and a cake, with
   a pot of stewed grain on the top. The old man eats his fill and drinks his fill; then he lies down to sleep.
   By-and-bye he awakes, and slides down to earth again.</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.48"><font color="#0000ff">p.48</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">He tells his wife of the good things up in the sky, and she induces him to take her with him. She
   slips into a sack, and the old man takes it in his teeth and begins to climb up. The old woman, becoming tired, asked
   him if it was much farther, and just as he was about to say, "Not much farther," the sack slipped from
   between his teeth, and the old woman fell to the ground and was smashed to pieces.</p>
 
   <p align="left">There are many variants of this last story (which is found in Mr. Ralston's most valuable and
   entertaining collection of Russian folk-tales), but observe the very close resemblance which it bears to the
   following Indian tale of the fools and the bull of Siva, from the <i>Kathá Sarit Ságara</i> (Ocean of the Streams of
   Story), the grand collection, composed in Sanskrit verse by Somadeva in the eleventh century, from a similar work
   entitled <i>Vrihat Kathá</i> (Great Story), written in Sanskrit prose by Gunadhya, in the sixth century:[1]</p>
 
   <p align="left">In a certain convent, which was full of fools, there was a man who was the greatest</p>
 
   <p align="left"><font color="#008000">[1] A complete translation of the <i>Kathá Sarit Ságara,</i> by Professor C. H.
   Tawney, with notes of variants, which exhibit his wide acquaintance with the popular fictions of all lands, has been
   recently published at Calcutta (London agents, Messrs. Trübner and Co.), a work which must prove invaluable to every
   English student of comparative folk-lore.</font></p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.49"><font color="#0000ff">p.49</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">fool of the lot. He once heard in a treatise on law, which was being read aloud, that a man who has a
   tank made gains a great reward in the next world. Then, as he had a large fortune, he had made a large tank full of
   water, at no great distance from his own convent. One day this prince of fools went to take a look at that tank of
   his, and, perceived that the sand had been scratched up by some creature. The next day too he came, and saw that the
   bank had been torn up in another part of the tank, and being quite astonished, he said to himself, "I will watch
   here to-morrow the whole day, beginning in the early morning, and I will find out what creature it is that does
   this." After he had formed this resolution, he came there early next morning, and watched, until at last he saw
   a bull descend from heaven and plough up the bank with its horns, He thought, "This is a heavenly bull, so why
   should I not go to heaven with it?" And he went up to the bull, and with both his hands laid hold of the tail
   behind. Then the holy bull lifted up, with the utmost force, the foolish man who was clinging to its tail, and
   carried him in a moment to its home in Kailasa.[1] There</p>
 
   <p align="left"><font color="#008000">[1] Siva's paradise, according to Hindú mythology, is on Mount Kailása, in
   the Himályas, north of Mánasa.</font></p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.50"><font color="#0000ff">p.50</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">the foolish man lived for some time in great comfort, feasting on heavenly dainties, sweetmeats, and
   other things which he obtained. And seeing that the bull kept going and returning, that king of fools, bewildered by
   destiny, thought, "I will go down clinging to the tail of the bull and see my friends, and after I have told
   them this wonderful tale, I will return in the same way." Having formed this resolution, the fool went and clung
   to the tail of the bull one day when it was setting out, and so returned to the surface of the earth. When he entered
   the convent, the other blockheads who were there embraced him, and asked him where he had been, and he told them.
   Then all these foolish men, having heard the tale of his adventures, made this petition to him: "Be kind, and
   take us also there; enable us also to feast on sweetmeats." He consented, and told them his plan for doing it,
   and next day led them to the border of the tank, and the bull came there. And the principal fool seized the tail of
   the bull with his two hands, and another took hold of his feet, and a third in turn took hold of his. So, when they
   had formed a chain by hanging on to one another's feet, the bull flew rapidly up into the air. And while the bull
   was going along, with all the fools clinging to its tail, it happened that one</p>
 
   <p align="left"><a name="p.51"><font color="#0000ff">p.51</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">of the fools said to the principal fool, "Tell us now, to satisfy our curiosity, how large were
   the sweetmeats which you ate, of which a never-failing supply can be obtained in heaven?" Then the leader had
   his attention diverted from the business in hand, and quickly joined his hands together like the cup of a lotus, and
   exclaimed in answer, "So big." But in so doing he let go the tail of the bull, and accordingly he and all
   those others fell from heaven, and were killed; and the bull returned to Kailása; but the people who saw it were much
   amused.[1]</p>
 
   <p align="left">"Thus," remarks the story-teller, "fools do themselves injury by asking questions and
   giving answers without reflection"; he then proceeds to relate a story in illustration of the apothegm that
   "association with fools brings prosperity to no man":</p>
 
   <p align="left">A certain fool, while going to another village, forgot the way. And when he asked the way, the people
   said to him, "Take the path that goes up by the tree on the bank of the river." Then the fool went and got
   on the trunk of that tree, and said to himself, "The men told me that my way lay up the trunk of this
   tree." And as he went on climbing up it, the bough at the end bent</p>

   <p align="left"><a name="p.52"><font color="#0000ff">p.52</font></a></p>
 
   <p align="left">with his weight, and it was all he could do to avoid falling by clinging to it. While he was clinging
   to it, there came that way an elephant that had been drinking water, with his driver on his back. And the fool called
   to him, saying, "Great sir, take me down." The elephant-driver laid hold of him by the feet with both his
   hands, to take him down from the tree. Meanwhile the elephant went on, and the driver found himself clinging to the
   feet of the fool, who was clinging to the end of the tree. Then said the fool to the driver, "Sing something, in
   order that the people may hear, and come at once and take us down." So the elephant-driver, thus appealed to,
   began to sing, and he sang so sweetly that the fool was much pleased; and in, his desire to applaud him, he forgot
   what he was about, let go his hold of the tree, and prepared to clap him with both his hands; and immediately he and

   <p align="left">The germ of all stories of this class is perhaps found in the <i>Játakas,</i> or Buddhist Birth
   Stories: A pair of geese resolve to migrate to another country, and agree to carry with them a tortoise, their
   intimate friend, taking the ends of a stick between their bills, and the tortoise grasping it by the middle with his
   mouth. As they are flying over</p>

   <p align="left">Bánáres, the people exclaim in wonder to one another at such a strange sight, and the tortoise,
   unable to maintain silence, opens his mouth to rebuke them, and by so doing falls to the ground, and is dashed into
   pieces, This fable is also found in Babrius. (115); in the <i>Kathá Sarit Ságara;</i> in the several versions of the
   Fables of Bidpaï; and in the <i>Avadánas,</i> translated into French from the Chinese by Stanislas Julien.</p>

   <p>To return to Gothamite stories. According to one of those which are current orally, the men of Gotham had but one
   knife among them, which was stuck in a tree in the middle of the village for their common use, and many amusing
   incidents, says Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps, arose out of their disputes for the use of this knife. The
   "carles" of Austwick, in Yorkshire, are said also to have had but one knife, or "whittle," which
   was deposited under a tree, and if it was not found there when wanted, the "carle" requiring it called out,
   "Whittle to the tree!" This plan did very well for some years, until it was taken one day by a party of
   labourers to a neighbouring moor, to be used for cutting their bread and cheese. When the day's labour was done,
   they resolved to leave the knife at the place,</p>
 
   <p><a name="p.54"><font color="#0000ff">p.54</font></a></p>
 
   <p>to save themselves the trouble of carrying it back, as they should want it again next day; so they looked about
   for some object to mark the spot, and stuck it into the ground under a black cloud that happened to be the most
   remarkable object in sight. But next day, when they returned to the place, the cloud was gone, and the
   "whittle" was never seen again.</p>
 
   <p>When an Austwick "carle" comes into any of the larger towns of Yorkshire, it is said he is greeted with
   the question, "Who tried to lift the bull over the gate?" in allusion to the following story: An Austwick
   farmer, wishing to get a bull out of a field-- how the animal got into it, the story does not inform us--procured the
   assistance of nine of his neighbours to lift the animal over the gate. After trying in vain for some hours, they sent
   one of their number to the village for more help. In going out he opened the gate, and after he had gone away, it
   occurred to one of those who remained that the bull might be allowed to go out in the same manner.</p>
 
   <p>Another Austwick farmer had to take a wheelbarrow to a certain town, and, to save a hundred yards by going the
   ordinary road, he went through the fields, and had to lift the barrow over twenty-two stiles.</p>
 
   <p>It was a Wiltshire man, however (if all tales be true), who determined to cure the</p>
 
   <p><a name="p.55"><font color="#0000ff">p.55</font></a></p>
 
   <p>filthy habits of his hogs by making them roost upon the branches of a tree, like birds. Night after night the pigs
   were hoisted up to their perch, and every morning one of them was found with its neck broken, until at last there
   were none left.--And quite as witless, surely, was the device of the men of Belmont, who once desired to move their
   church three yards farther westward, so they carefully marked the exact distance by leaving their coats on the
   ground. Then they set to work to push with all their might against the eastern wall. In the meantime a thief had gone
   round to the west side and stolen their coats. "Diable!" exclaimed they on finding that their coats were
   gone, "we have pushed too far!"</p>
