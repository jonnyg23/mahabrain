 <p>For many years the copy now in the John Rylands Library was considered to be unique. Until 1807 it lay buried and unnoticed in the heart of a volume of manuscripts, with which it had evidently been bound up by mistake. Since then, another copy has been discovered in the library at Holkam Hall, the seat of the Earl of Leicester.</p>  
 <p><a name="page__006"></a></p><hr>  
 <p>2. A BOOKE IN ENGLYSH METRE, of the Great Marchaunt man called "Dives Pragmaticus"  1563.... With an introduction by Percy E. Newbery; and remarks on the vocabulary and dialect with a glossary by Henry C. Wyld. 1910. 4to, pp. xxxviii, 16, 5s. <i>net</i>.</p>

 <p>There is no indication in any edition of the place of printing, date or name of printer, but they are all printed in one of the five types employed by William de Machlinia, who printed first in partnership with John Lettou and afterwards alone in the City of London, at the time when William Caxton was at the most active period of his career at Westminster.</p>  
 <p>WOODCUTS OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY IN THE JOHN RYLANDS LIBRARY. Reproduced in facsimile. With an introduction and descriptive notes by Campbell Dodgson M.A. Folio. Ten plates, of which two are in colour, and 16 pp. of text, in a portfolio. 7s. 6d. <i>net</i>.</p>  
 <p><a name="img_3star"></a>
 <img src="img/3star.jpg"> Two of these woodcuts are of exceptional interest and importance, and have been known and celebrated for a century and a half, but have not hitherto been reproduced in a satisfactory manner by any of the modern photo-mechanical processes. The two woodcuts referred to represent "St. Christopher" and "The Annunciation," the former of which has acquired a great celebrity by reason of the date (1423) which it bears, and which, until recently, gave to it the unchallenged position of the first dated woodcut.</p>
