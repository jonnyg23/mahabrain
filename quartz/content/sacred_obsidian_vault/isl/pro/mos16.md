 When the folks reached the lands of Sinai peninsula, the sun there was
 extremely hot and there were no homes that they can live in and no trees
 to be under their shadows, so they complained to Moses about the harshness
 they are facing so he prayed to his Lord who brought then a cloud to that
 place to make the shade for them and protect them against the sun, and
 because their supplies was to be over and they missed the meats with their
 fear of being kept in hunger God then sent to them the winds carrying the
 manna and the quails, and when they passed from the eastern coast and they
 had no water then for their drink and for their cattles, they complained
 to Moses and asked for water, so God then commanded him to strike the rock
 with his staff and when he did so, twelve springs then gushed out, and
 after all of that they were not satisfied what God revealed for them and
 what favours He made special for them, so they asked their prophet Moses
 (PUH) to have a fine living conditions and asked for what they used to
 eat of vegetables and herbs and the various kinds of cucumbers and garlic
 and grains for bread and other cookings and lentils and onions and so on,
 as if they were cattles just want to eat and to work, and they do not look
 back at what they were in of humiliation and slavery for the pharaoh and
 his people and how their women were treated like slaves and they were attacked
 in their honor and been humilaited more than the folks of Saba' (Sheba),
 and their children were used to be killed in front of them with no mercy
 for them, and thier men were kept for the hard work and to remove the dirt
 and every humiliating job, as tyrants usually do with the slaves, and with
 the prophet of God they turned to be free and own themselves and work in
 complete freedom and dignity and worship the truthful God, the Lord of
 all, without someone to wrong them, under the mercy of the One of Mercy
 who saved them from humiliation and turned them to dignity and eternal
 happiness, but this did not awaken their determination that was turned
 down by the pharaoh and the household of the pharaoh and the adversities
 that came over them for long times which made humiliation is a second nature
 for them planted in their hearts and their sights and their hearing and
 the instinct that has the total control of their feelings, and so on.
 <br>The clues for all of this are all provided by the holy quran, so God
 said in the chapter of Al-Baqarah: And when ye said: O Moses! We are weary
 of one kind of food; so call upon thy Lord for us that He bring forth for
 us of that which the earth groweth - of its herbs and its cucumbers and
 its corn and its lentils and its onions. He said: Would ye exchange that
 which is higher for that which is lower? Go down to settled country, thus
 ye shall get that which ye demand(Al-Baqarah:61), and in the chapter of
 Al-A`râf: And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and
 they came unto a people who were given up to idols which they had. They
 said: O Moses! Make for us a god even as they have gods. He said: Lo! ye
 are a folk who know not. Lo! as for these, their way will be destroyed
 and all that they are doing is in vain. He said: Shall I seek for you a
 god other than Allah when He hath favoured you above (all) creatures?(Al-A`râf:138-140),
 And of Moses' folk there is a community who lead with truth and establish
 justice therewith. We divided them into twelve tribes, nations; and We
 inspired Moses, when his people asked him for water, saying: Smite with
 thy staff the rock! And there gushed forth therefrom twelve springs, so
 that each tribe knew their drinking-place. And we caused the white cloud
 to overshadow them and sent down for them the manna and the quails (saying):
 Eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you. They wronged Us
 not, but they were wont to wrong themselves (Al-A`râf:159-160), and
 in the chapter of TaHa: O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your
 enemy, and we made a covenant with you on the holy mountain's side, and
 sent down on you the manna and the quails, Saying): Eat of the good things
 wherewith We have provided you, and transgress not in respect thereof lest
 My wrath come upon you: and he on whom My wrath cometh, he is lost indeed.
 And lo! verily I am Forgiving toward him who repenteth and believeth and
 doeth good, and afterward walketh aright(TaHa:80-82), and so on of many
 clues.
