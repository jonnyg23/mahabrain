 <center><font size="+3">Moses Entering Egypt After Sending Him With His Brother
 Aaron</font></center>
 They mention that after Moses had spoke with God in the holy valley and
 after His commandment in His saying: Go thou unto Pharaoh! Lo! he hath
 transgressed (the bounds)(TaHa:24), he went along with his family and his
 cattles to Egypt and he got into it at night time and had a residence in
 the house of his mother and brother and the rest of his family, and seems
 that his father was dead at that time, and we've mentioned before that
 his brother Aaron went to him for reception on the bank of the Nile by
 an inspiration from God to Aaron, and then he took residence in the house
 of his family and he had the great happiness for meeting them after such
 a long period of time, especially towards his purified mother, and he told
 them about his matter and whatever he faced of troubles until he reached
 Midian and about his residence with Jethro and so on, and he told his brother
 Aaron that he is his partner in the message and he is a prophet and appointed
 to tell the message and take on its adversities and take the leadership
 by a commandment of God, so Aaron had nothing but to accept it and obey
 God's commandment, then they went to tell the message and go to the pharaoh,
 and they had nothing in their thoughts but to do what God commanded with.
 It is said that they got into the court of the pharaoh just by requesting
 that. In a speech attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH) that he said: when
 God sent Moses as a prophet to the pharaoh, he came to his door and asked
 to meet him but he did not give a permission, so he (Moses) stroke the
 door with his stick and all open doors were closed and then he got into
 the court of the pharaoh and told him that he is a prophet from God and
 asked him to send with him the Israelites, so then the pharaoh said to
 him: Did we not rear thee among us as a child? And thou didst dwell many
 years of thy life among us, And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst,
 and thou wast one of the ingrates(Al-Shu`arâ':18-19), meaning that
 you killed a man from us so you were ingrateful to my care for you, and
 then Moses said:  Even though I show thee something plain?(Al-Shu`arâ':30),
 then the pharaoh said: Produce it then, if thou art of the truthful!(Al-Shu`arâ':31),
 Then he flung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest(Al-Shu`arâ':32),
 and so then everyone escaped and fled away and terror got into the pharaoh
 and he could not hold hisself and then said: O Moses, by God I ask you
 to keep it away from me, and so he did, and then he got his hands out and
 it was so white, and it is said that when Moses took his stick away from
 the pharaoh, he was about to believe in Moses but Haman said to him: you
 were a god and worshipped and now you are a servant for a servant, stop
 him and do not allow him to do his deeds, so then the tyrants of the pharaoh's
 followers said: he is only a magician with a great knowledge and want to
 banish you away from your lands so what are you going to do? They said
 then: Put him off (a while) - him and his brother - and send into the cities
 summoners, To bring each knowing wizard unto thee(Al-A`râf:111-112).
 <br>They said that the pharaoh and Haman were the best wizards, and they
 conquered people by the magic, and the pharaoh claimed hisself as a god
 by magic, and as for Haman he was a slave for the pharaoh, as it is mentioned
 in Safeenat Al-Bihâr for Al-Muhaddiþ Al-Qummi, but because
 of his loyality to the pharaoh and because he did not believe in a thing
 except in life and to make people as slaves, he was then transformed from
 being just an advisor to someone that shares everything in his matters,
 and what we understand about this man, Haman, that he was an intelligent
 man and a devil by himself and also a hypocrite and has no religion and
 does not worship anything, and when the pharaoh was about to believe in
 Moses, Haman started to keep him away from this, thus the pharaoh was closer
 to the faith rather than Haman was and for this when he was about to sink
 he said: I believed in what the Israelites believed in, but that was of
 no benefit to him, so Haman is the one that used to manage the matters
 of the pharaoh, and he built for him the tower when he (the pharaoh) ordered
 him to do so: and set up for me a lofty tower in order that I may survey
 the god of Moses(Al-Qasas:38), and they say that when Moses told the pharaoh
 what he was sent for and to send with him the Israelites, he (the pharaoh)
 made this as a favour for him to the Israelites and Moses, and the speech
 of Moses to the pharaoh was a speech of passion and easiness with patience
 applying God's commandment to him and his brother in God's saying: And
 speak unto him a gentle word, that peradventure he may heed or fear(TaHa:44),
 and also God said in the chapter of Al-A`râf: Moses said: O Pharaoh!
 Lo! I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds, Approved upon condition
 that I speak concerning Allah nothing but the truth. I come unto you (lords
 of Egypt) with a clear proof from your Lord. So let the Children of Israel
 go with me(Al-A`râf:104-105), and in the chapter of Al-Shu`arâ'
 the same meaning is mentioned.
 <br>Some people claimed that such speech is in fact as to mock at the pharaoh
 by Moses as for Moses he was powerful by God and by whatever God gave him
 of miracles, and his power is not humiliated by the claims of the pharaoh
 or his numerous solders or even his luxurious marches, but this is just
 an imagination of the one claimed such thing, and it is a gentle word for
 the benefit of the others and it is for what God wanted in God's saying:
 And speak unto him a gentle word, that peradventure he may heed or fear(TaHa:44),
 and this commandment to make his heart incline toward releasing the Israelites,
 because he had enslaved them and treated them worse than anyone else, thus
 as if Moses was sent for them only and to release them and stop humiliating
 them and let them work with the religion of their fathers Abraham and Ishmael
 and Isaac and Jacob (PUT), as it is understood from the results of their
 story after passing through the sea and the death of the pharaoh at the
 end.
 <br>It is said that the pharaoh was a cow-worshipper and he ordered the
 people to worship it and the narrator of such tidings takes the clue from
 the deed of As-Samiri (The Samarian) who made the calf for the Israelites
 for they were used to it, thus it is said that for the hardness and harshness
 of the pharaoh and his tyranny, he is not faced with mocking as some said,
 but he was faced with the gentle words for God's saying: And speak unto
 him a gentle word, that peradventure he may heed or fear(TaHa:44), or else
 he might be faced with destruction.
 <br>Then the pharaoh, after the message of Moses and the seducation of
 Haman, started to gather the wizards to stand against Moses, and gathered
 them from all the cities and they were one thousand wizards, and he chose
 the best eighty of them and they said to the pharaoh: you knew that no
 one is more skillful than us in magic, so if we defeated Moses what is
 our reward? He said to them: you will share the kingdom with me, they then
 said to him: and if Moses defeated us and broke our magic then we would
 know that what he showed was not magic but it is a miracle from God to
 prove his claims and so we must believe in him. Then said the pharaoh:
 if Moses defeated you, I shall believe in him as well.
 <br>As attrbiuted to Ibn-`Abbâs he said: when the pharaoh said the
 power of God in the stick and the hand (of Moses) he said: we will not
 defeat Moses unless by facing him with someone like him, so he took some
 children from the Israelites and sent them to a village called Al-`Armâ'
 where magic is taught for children and they learned lot of magic and the
 pharaoh had an appointed with Moses in a certain day, and he called the
 wizards so they came with their teachers, and then the pharaoh said to
 them: how did you do? They said: we taught them magic that no one on earth
 could bear unless if it was a commandment from heaven then they cannot
 bear it, so then the pharaoh gathered all the wizards and they were seventy
 two men, and Ka`b Al-Ahbâr said they were twelve thousand, and some
 said they were around thirty thousand, and `Ikrimah said seventy thousand,
 and some said eighty thousand and he (the pharaoh) chose seventy thousand
 of them and then from those seventy thousand he picked seven hundred, and
 they say that chiefs of the wizards were brothers from the town of Al-Sofr
 (and it is an area at the far end of Egypt and only God knows) and when
 the messanger of the pharaoh came they said to their father: the king called
 for us because two men arrived in his court without men or weapons but
 have the power and the king is annoyed because of them, and they had a
 stick that when thrown nothing would stand in its face and swallows the
 iron and the woods and the stones, so their father answered: look to them
 when they sleep, and if you can, steal it from them, because the magic
 of a wizard would not work while he's sleeping, and if you could not do
 it while they are sleeping then this is something of God's commandment
 and you have no power for this nor anyone else would, and so they did and
 tried to steal it while they were sleeping but when it felt them, it chased
 them and they fled away scared, and they had an appointment with him at
 the day of the feast [Arabic: day of the feast = Yawm Al-Zeenah] and it
 was a day for the market for them (the Egyptians).
 <br>It is mentioned from Ibn-`Abbâs that it was at the day of `Âshurâ'
 [the tenth day of Muharram, the first month in lunar calendar, and the
 same day for the massacre of the grandson of the prophet, Al-Husain], and
 it was on Saturday and also it was at the day of Nayruz [Nayruz: ancient
 persian festival announcing the beginning of spring, Iranian people still
 celebrate it every year], and so all the people from all around the world
 gathered together and it was in Alexandria, so when everyone gathered together,
 Moses came to them while he was standing with the help of his stick and
 Aaron with him, so Moses then said to the wizards: Woe unto you! Invent
 not a lie against Allah, lest He extirpate you by some punishment. He who
 lieth faileth miserably(TaHa:61), so each one of them said to the other:
 this is not a saying of a wizard, then they said to him: we shall show
 you today a magic that you never saw before, and they brought the sticks
 and ropes carried by sixty camels. Then Moses said to them: Throw what
 ye are going to throw! So they did and threw their sticks and ropes and
 it went like if they were snakes and like mountains that filled the valley
 riding each other, so he (Moses) got scared in himself, [a line comes here
 I could not understand!], then God inspired to him: Fear not! Lo! thou
 art the higher, Throw that which is in thy right hand! It will eat up that
 which they have made. Lo! that which they have made is but a wizard's artifice,
 and a wizard shall not be successful to whatever point (of skill) he may
 attain(TaHa:68-69), so he threw his stick and turned to be a large black
 serpent with four short but thick legs and had a tail that it used to stand
 upon and could reach higher than the city walls with its head, and anything
 it would strike with its tail would be broken, and its legs could break
 the rocks and fill the walls of the houses with fire and his nose smoked
 poisons, so then it viewed what the wizards did throw and it were like
 snakes in the eyes of the pharaoh and the others, so it swallowed them
 one by one and nothing left in the valley, so the people got defeated and
 fell upon each other so that twenty five thousand persons died that day
 because of that and the pharaoh got defeated with fear..etc - and it is
 a long tale - until the narrator said: when the wizards saw what happened
 they said: if it was magic it would not be hid from us, and if it was magic
 then where are our sticks and ropes? Then they fell prostrating and said:
 We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, The Lord of Moses and Aaron(Al-A`râf:121-122),
 and there were four elders among them: Sabur, `Ârur, Hat-hat, Masfâ,
 so when the wizards believed (in Moses) the pharaoh said with stubborness:
 Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he doubtless is your
 chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know. Verily I
 will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify
 you every one(Al-Shu`arâ':49), then they said: We choose thee not
 above the clear proofs that have come unto us, and above Him Who created
 us. So decree what thou wilt decree. Thou wilt end for us only this life
 of the world(TaHa:72), so he cut off their hands and legs and crucified
 them and he was the first to do that, so they were disbelievers in the
 morning and faithful martyrs in the evening, and the pharaoh was defeated
 and denied but to remain being stubborn, so Moses got back and the stick
 following him protecting him like an honest dog would do to his master
 and the people were looking at it until Moses went into the camp of the
 Israelites and he took its head and it got back again to a stick.
 <br>They say that the meeting of the wizards with Moses and his brother
 at that appointed day and it was a day of festival for them, so when it
 was midday all people gathered, and the pharaoh had that day a dome that
 was seventy cubits in height and it was covered with steel and when the
 sun rays strike it no one would be able to look at it because of the glancing,
 and when they faced each other, the wizards said to the pharaoh: we see
 a man that looks into heaven and our magic did not reach the heaven, then
 they said to Moses: O Moses! Either throw (first) or let us be the first
 throwers? So Moses said to them: Throw what ye are going to throw! Then
 they threw down their cords and their staves and said: By Pharaoh's might,
 lo! we verily are the winners. Then they (cords and staves) started to
 shake and ride on each other so everyone that might looked at them would
 think that they are indeed snakes and all people got scared, and Moses
 kept his fear inside himself and then he was called: Fear not! Lo! thou
 art the higher. Throw that which is in thy right hand! It will eat up that
 which they have made. Lo! that which they have made is but a wizard's artifice,
 and a wizard shall not be successful to whatever point (of skill) he may
 attain, so Moses then threw his staff and it melted like lead on the floor
 then its head appeared and opened its mouth and put its upper jaw on the
 dome of the pharaoh and then went around like a millstone and ate the cords
 and staves of the wizards as if they were nothing, and people got horrified
 because of this and could not hold themselves and started to run and squashed
 each other so that ten thousand men and women and children were killed
 because of this, then it went around the dome of the pharaoh and he (the
 pharaoh) got frustrated and also Haman and so scared so that polluted their
 clothes and their head went white, while Moses went with the people running
 so then God called him saying: Grasp it and fear not. We shall return it
 to its former state, so then Moses went back and covered his hand with
 his clothes and put his hand into its mouth and it turned back into a staff
 as it was, so then the wizards fell prostrating and said: We believe in
 the Lord of Aaron and Moses, but the pharaoh got angry for what they did
 and said to them: Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo!
 he doubtless is your chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come
 to know. Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and
 verily I will crucify you every one, and they said to him: Lo! we ardently
 hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are the first of
 the believers..etc, and we've mentioned the story before but it is here
 again for some variations in narrations, but the truth in all variations
 is one as it is obvious.
