 <center><font size="+3">David (PUH)</font></center>
 When David killed Goliath, the armies got separated and got back from their
 coming destination and God made him victorious and he became closer for
 Saul and he (Saul) made him marry his daughter Michal and he also made
 him a leader fos his armies and the Israelites considered him a great man
 and the friendship grew tight between David and the son of Saul Yonaþân
 (Jonathan) and the relations between David and Saul were good for some
 time, and then when the conditions of David grew higher and he became famous
 among the people and the Israelites became under his commands, Saul envied
 him for this and feared him and feared that he would try to take from him
 the kingdom, so he desired to kill him and assasinate him, but his son
 Jonathan used to defend him (David) and praise him and show his father
 that he is loyal to him and worked on enhancing the position of David in
 the eyes of his father. When Saul wanted to destroy David, his wife Michal,
 the daughter of Saul, warned him and he ran away, and she told her father
 that he (David) is on his bed so send someone to kill him and when they
 wanted to they only found some clothes been covered. This is what was told
 by some historians and seems that they copied this from Torah apparently.
 Then David gathered his close relatives and his brothers in belief and
 whoever was escaping Saul of the Israelites and lot of others joined him
 and so he became stronger and he raised up to face Saul, and then many
 chasings and wars started between them and at the end David won and killed
 him (Saul).
 <br>They say then after that David went to the city of Hebron and then
 the men of Judah came to him and they were far from him before, and they
 gave him the kingdom and made him a king over the house of Judah as he
 is a king over others, and so his kingdom grew wider even, and there were
 a group of people of them (the house of Judah) and others among the Israelites
 that did not go along with him and went under the command of the son of
 Saul, and also the men of his father and the leaders of the armies, and
 wars again started between them until the son of Saul died after two years
 of wars beginning between him and David, and when he died, David had all
 the kingdom and all the Israelites came under his command and he lived
 in the city of Jirun (Hebron) [seems there is a printing mistake in this
 point], and it is the city of Al-Khaleel now [Al-Khaleel, the Arabic name
 of Hebron], and he lived there for seven years and then he moved to Sahyun
 (Zion) and it is a fort that was called later on by the city of Dâwud
 (David), and there lived beside him lot of enemies but at the end all of
 them came under his command and all of their lands became under the rule
 of the Israelites, and there were lot of wars during the days of rule of
 David and he went out of them victorious, and his kingdom grew wider until
 he reached the bay of Aqabah and the Euphrates in Iraq, so all of these
 lands went under his command after many wars that he won all, and so he
 conquered the lands of Palestine and took Damascus the capital of the Arameans
 after fierce wars, and he fought against the tribes and clans on the Euphrates
 and won against them all, and he ruled Jordan after wars with Ammonites.
 That was in brief what was mentioned in Torah and the real thing is known
 only by God.
 <br>It is attributed to Al-Bâqir (PUH) that he said: God did not
 send prophets as kings after Noah except of four: Ðul-Qarnain and his
 name was `Ayyâsh, and David and Solomon and Joseph (PUT), and as
 for `Ayyâsh he ruled what was between the east and west, and as for
 David
 he ruled the lands of Canaan upto the lands of Issachar, and so it was
 the same for Solomon, and as for Joseph he ruled Egypt and its lands and
 did not come over behind this. As for Solomon, maybe that was the beginning
 of his rule because what is well-known about him that he ruled what was
 between the east and west as Ðul-Qarnain without a difference, although
 there is a difference in the mentioned narration and only God knows. As
 reported by Sâhib Al-Kâmil [either a book's or a person's name]
 that David ben Jesse was from the house of Judah and when Saul was killed
 all of the Israelites came to him and gave him the keys of treasures of
 Saul and they made him a king over them and when he became a king God made
 him a prophet and revealed upon him the Zabur (Psalms) and He ordered the
 mountains and the birds to sanctify God with him when he does, and God
 did not give anyone a voice like his voice and whenever he used to read
 the psalms the beasts would come to him even if he wanted to take hold
 of their necks, and he used to worship at night and fast the daytime and
 used to eat from his own work and trade.
 <br>They say that at the time of David, the plague spread among the people
 and so he went out with them to the location of the Temple and he used
 to see before that time the angels going to heavens from that location
 and that is why he went to that location to pray to God in it, so when
 he stood in the location of the Rock and prayed to God to raise the plague
 from among them, God answered him then and they all knew that this spot
 is a sacred one and he made a mosque in it, and they started to build it
 for eleven years from the time of his rule but he died before it is done
 and he advised his son Solomon to complete its building. They say when
 the end of David drew near, he had a maid that used to lock all the doors
 and bring the keys to him, and then he prays to his Lord, and one night
 she locked all the doors as usual and then she came back and she saw a
 man so she said to him: who let you into the room? He said to her: I am
 the one who goes into the courts of kings without their permission, and
 David heard this so he asked: are you the angel of death? He said: yes,
 and David then said to him: shouldn't you send messangers to me to get
 prepared? Then the angel of death said: I sent to you many times before,
 and then David asked: who was your messanger? He said: where is your father
 and your brother and your neighbour, and he mentioned some names, so David
 answered: they all died, so he said: they are my messangers to you and
 you shall die as they died before, and so he took his soul. When he died,
 Solomon inherited his kingdom, and he had nineteen sons but only Solomon
 inherited him, and his age at the time of his death was one hundred years,
 and his rule was for forty years (out of the one hundred years), and some
 others say that he lived for one hundred and forty years.
 <br>Al-Mas`udi mentioned that God made the iron flexible for David and
 so he made out of it the shields and He made the mountains and the birds
 sanctify with him, and then he said: and God revealed upon him the psalms
 in Hebrew and made of one hundred and fifty chapters and divided it into
 three thirds, and the last third of them is made of sermons and attractions
 and warnings, and it has no commands and no laws, and David built a house
 for worshipping in Jerusalem and it is the Sacred House (the Temple) and
 it is the one the remained until this very day and it is called the chancel
 of David [Arabic: Mihrâb Dâwud], and from the top of it one
 can see the dead sea and the river Jordan, and God gave many favours for
 David and gave him lot of properities that would not pass over the mind
 of anyone and He praised him aind thanked for him the beautiful stands
 he did take.
 <br>God did test him and showed his faith and he was one of the best that
 God did choose for His religion and for His inspirations, of those who
 guide with His own commands and turn angry for His case with a plain clue
 that is not corrupted with doubt, for they are infallible and faithful
 and wise with passion.
