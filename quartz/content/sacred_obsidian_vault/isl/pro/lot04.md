 <div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><big><a name="015_071">The
 Wife of Lot (PUH)</a></big></big></big><br>
 <div style="text-align: left;"><a name="015_071">The wife of Lot (PUH)
 was from village and she followed the religion of her own people and
 did not believe in Lot or his religion and never followed him by any
 way, but she followed her people and their religion and she liked their
 deeds and she was an enemy to Lot and to everything connected to him
 and to anyone who loves him, so she was a disbeliever and used to guide
 the people for his guests, and they said: she assigned a sign between
 her and her people to tell them about his guests, and that is whenever
 guests would come to him at night she would work some fire on the roof
 of the house, and at daytime she would make a smoke instead, and in
 some speeches it is mentioned that after leaving Abraham, the angels
 went to Lot and found him watering his plants, so Lot said to them: who
 are you? They answered: we are travellers, make us your guests tonight.
 Then he said: O people, the people of this village are people of evil
 and God damned them, they commit sodomy with men and take their money,
 so they said: we've been late, make us your guests. Then he went to his
 wife and said: we have some guests tonight so keep it a secret and I
 shall forgive you for all your deeds until this very day, so she said:
 I will, and when Gabriel and the angels entered to his home, his wife
 made a fire on the roof and so the people of the village knew about it
 and came to him from every direction and when they reached the door
 they said to Lot: </a><a name="015_070">Have we not forbidden you from
 entertaining anyone? He answered: </a><a name="011_078">Here are my
 daughters! They are purer for you, and he meant by that their wives
 because the prophet is considered to be like the father of his nation
 so he called them back to what is allowed, so he said: your wives are
 purer for you. They said: </a><a name="011_079">Well thou knowest that
 we have no right to thy daughters, and well thou knowest what we want,
 then Lot said when he was despaired: </a><a name="011_080">Would that
 I had strength to resist you or had some strong support.<br>
 In speeches: no prophet was sent after Lot unless he was of a high
 place among his people, and maybe the saying of Lot "</a><a name="011_080">Would that I had strength" was dedicated to the angels
 and the purpose of it is to mean if only he have strength to protect
 them, and Lot did not know they were angels at that time, then the
 angels told him about their real identity and for the purpose for their
 arrival, but the apparent thing in the holy phrases is that the speech
 was dedicated to his people and not to the angels, because when they
 (his people) came running towards him, it is more accurate to be with
 them at that moment, and only God knows.When the people tried to take
 the guests of Lot out of his home by force and attacked his house, God
 made them unable to see any place to get into the house, and so they
 did not see the way nor the door and did not know where are they, and
 the earth shaken under their feet and their heads flipped upside down
 and their eyes and their hearts been blind.<br>
 Then angels took out Lot and his daughters and his wife from the
 village and ordered them that no one should look back and they should
 go to wherever they are ordered, so they obeyed the commandments except
 his wife and she looked back to the village to see what happened to it
 and her heart was there more than it is with Lot, and so she had the
 punishment that was revealed on them, and she was a disbeliever, so God
 rained with baked clay, and flipped their lands and made the highest of
 it to the lowest, and God said in the chapter of Al-Tahreem: </a><a name="066_010">Allah citeth an example for those who disbelieve: the
 wife of Noah and the wife of Lot, who were under two of Our righteous
 slaves yet betrayed them so that they (the husbands) availed them
 naught against Allah and it was said (unto them): Enter the Fire along
 with those who enter(Al-Tahreem:10). It is said that in Torah mentioned
 the story in the same way that quran did but it did not mention
 anything about offering his daughters, and it mentioned that while the
 wife of Lot was walking away from the village she looked back at her
 people and then she was turned to a pillar of salt, and Lot with his
 daughters then took refuge in a village called Zoar which was kept in
 safe.<br>
