 of Easiness For The Household of Jacob (PUH)</font></font></center>
 <font face="Times New Roman,Times">As attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH)
 that he said: a nomad came to Joseph to buy some food and he sold some
 to him, and when he finished Joseph said to him: where is your home? He
 answered: in (some) location, so then he said to him: if you passed by
 a valley called (so and so) stand by and call "O Jacob, O Jacob" and then
 an old man with nice face will come out to you, then say to him that you
 met a man in Egypt and he says peace for you and says that your savings
 in that hands of God will never astray, and so when the nomad reached that
 location he called: O Jacob, O Jacob, so then an old and tall blind man
 got out for him keeping his track by his hand on the walls, and so then
 he told him what Joseph told him to say, and when he heard it he fell down
 in a coma, then he woke up and said to the nomad: O nomad, need anything
 from God? He said: yes, I am a man with lot of money and I have a cousin
 that I did not have any children from and I would like you to ask God for
 me to have children, and so he did, and the nomad's wife got pregnant for
 four times and in each time she gave birth for a twin. Jacob knew that
 Joseph was alive and did not die and God will show him after his absence,
 and used to say to his children: I know from God that which ye know not.</font>
 <br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They say that Jacob went to some
 one for some purpose, and the man said to him: why you are so old as I
 see you now? He answered: sadness and troubled, and then when he reached
 the door God inspired to him: O Jacob, you've complained about me to some
 of my servants, so he fell down prostrating at the door step and he was
 saying: I will not do it again, then God inspired to him: I forgive you
 for this, but do not do it again, and then he did not complain about any
 of life's troubles to any one, but one day he said: I expose my distress
 and anguish only unto Allah, and I know from Allah that which ye know not(Yousof:86).</font>
 <br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We've mentioned before how sad Jacob
 was for Joseph in the tale attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH) when he said:
 like the sadness of seventy mothers that lost their children. It is attributed
 to Ibn-`Abbâs that he said: when the household of Jacob suffered
 as all other people suffered of famine, he (Jacob) gathered his children
 and said to them: O children I've heard that in Egypt they sell there some
 nice food and it's owned by a faithful man, so go to him and buy some food
 from him, so then they went to Egypt and they went to Joseph and he knew
 them but they knew him not, so he asked them about their lands and their
 tribes and where are they from, so they said: we are the children of Jacob
 ben Isaac ben Abraham, the friend of God, so he said to them: then, you
 have three prophets but I do not see any respect in you, and you might
 be spies from other lands, so they said to him: O king, we are not spies
 nor seeking a war, and if you know our father you would greet us with hospitality
 for he is one of God's prophets and a son of prophets and he is sad, so
 then Joseph said to them: and why he is sad and he is a prophet of God
 and also son of prophets and paradise must be his place and he have you
 for his strength, maybe he is sad for your silliness, then they said: O
 king we are not silly and he is not sad because of us, but once he had
 a son that was the youngest of us and he was called Joseph and then he
 went us for hunting but the wolf devoured him and so he is still sad for
 him, so then said Joseph: all of you from one father and one mother? They
 said: our father is one but our mothers are different, then he said to
 them: what made your father release you all without keeping one to be with
 him for his aid? They said: he did indeed and he got the youngest of us,
 he said to them: and why did he choose him? They said: for he is the most
 beloved child for him after Joseph, then Joseph said to them: I will keep
 one of them with me here, and you get back to your father and say peace
 from me to him and tell him to send me his son that you claimed that he
 is keeping with him to tell me what made him (Jacob) sad, and what made
 him become so old that fast and what made him blind after crying, and when
 he said that and they knew that there is no escape from this, they made
 a ballotting and so Sham`un (Simeon) was chosen for this and so he (Joseph)
 ordered for him to be imprisoned, and when they said the farewell to Simeon
 he said to them: O brothers, see what trouble I am in and say peace to
 my father from me, so they said the farewell and went to the lands of Shem
 and got to Jacob (PUH) and they said the peace for him so then he said
 to them: O children, why I do not hear the voice of Simeon? They said:
 O father we came from a king that people saw no one like him in wisdom
 and riches, and if you have someone similar to you then he is the one but
 we are a household that was made for troubles, and the king charged us
 and did not believe us unless you send Benjamin with us with a message
 from you telling him about your sadness and about the reason for becoming
 so old so fast and about your crying and blindness, so then Jacob thought
 that this is a plot that they made so he said to them: woe to you O my
 children for your habit, everytime you go out for a purpose one of you
 is missed, I will not send him with you.When they opened their when they
 opened their belongings they discovered that their merchandise had been
 returned to them. They said: O our father! What (more) can we ask? Here
 is our merchandise returned to us, then Jacob said: you knew that Benjamin
 is beloved to me after your brother Joseph and with him is my joy, so I
 will not send him with you till ye give me an undertaking in the name of
 Allah that ye will bring him back to me, unless ye are surrounded, then
 Judah assured him for this and they went out until they reached Egypt and
 went to Joseph and said to him: did you tell my message? They said: yes,
 and this kid have your answers so ask him about what you want, so Joseph
 said to him: what did your father send you to me for? He said: he sent
 me to you to say peace for you and he says that you sent messengers asking
 about my sadness and why I got older so fast and about my crying and blindness,
 for the saddest of people are those who remember the after-life, and been
 older so fast for I do remember the doomsday always, my crying and blindness
 all are for my beloved Joseph, and I've been told that you are sad for
 my sadness and you cared about my story and may God rewards you with the
 best, and the best you can do to me is that you send me back my son Benjamin
 for he is my beloved son after Joseph, and hurry up with what I can help
 by my children. When he said all of that, Joseph could not hold hisself
 and went inside crying for one hour and then he went out and ordered for
 some food for them and said to them: every group of one mother let them
 sit together on one table, so they sat but Benjamin kept on standing, so
 then he said to him: why don't you take a seat? He said: none of them is
 my brother from the same mother, then Joseph said: yes there is one, but
 they claimed that the wolf devoured him, then said: how sad are you for
 him? He (Benjamin) said: I had twelve children and everyone of them have
 a name that is derived from his name (Joseph's name), then said Joseph:
 seems you ran after women and children after him, so then said Benjamin:
 I have a faithful father and he said to me once: get married maybe God
 will give you children that fill the lands with their hyming to God, so
 then Joseph said to him: come and sit with me on my own table, then his
 brothers said: God preferred Joseph and his brother even the king made
 him sit with him, and then Joseph ordered for the cup of the king to be
 in the saddlebag of Benjamin.</font>
