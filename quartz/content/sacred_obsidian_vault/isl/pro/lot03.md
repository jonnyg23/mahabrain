 <div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><big><a name="003_182">Presenting
 His Daughters to The People of His Village and His Wife Conditions<br>
 </a></big></big></big>
 <div style="text-align: left;">What is apparent in quran that Lot was
 giving his daughters to his people whenever they want to harm his
 guests and some holy phrases say: <a name="015_071">Here are my
 daughters, if ye must be doing (so)(Al-Hijr:70). This is something that
 faithful souls deny and no man with a bit of jealousy accept such a
 thing even if it was for something important like protecting his guests
 against the disbelievers and tyrants, so just doing this by giving up
 his daughters for the wrong-doing is something denied by the mind and
 can not be done by a faithful man of jealousy. So, how come it is done
 by a prophet, that is an example of dignity and honour and he is the
 guidance of God to the people, and it is attributed to the prophet
 (PUH) and his Household (PUT) what includes the meaning of: whoever
 started a good habit, then he has its reward and the rewards of people
 who do it after him until the doomsday, and whoever started an evil
 habit then he has its punishment and the punishments of people who do
 it after him until the doomsday. Some people interpreted that just from
 its apparent meaning, and still it has the same result of meaning, so
 how about if we were talking about a prophet of God for the people that
 by him laws and regulations of the religion would be taken and taught
 and within his hands the right to ban the evil-doings and allow the
 good-deeds, so just doing such a thing is greatly denied for it is
 something denied by the mind and also banned by the laws of religion in
 all religions and it is never found to be allowed since the beginning
 of creation until this very day, but for protection against such a
 thing blood had been shed and it is the law that must be kept, and if
 it was not so then every son of a female even if he has no religion he
 won't be traced back to an honourable root.<br>
 The deeds of the religious authority are subject to be followed and it
 is taken by people either they believed in such authority or not to
 take such deeds as clues and people keep telling the stories about such
 an authority and the tidings would keep up by time, and if it was such
 deed is bad, then people would mock at religions and take it as
 something ridiculous and such a thing is against the purpose that for
 which God sent His prophet, and such deeds would not be issued by a
 wiseman, and impossible to be issued by a wiseman.<br>
 The talk of Lot that was told in quran in the chapter of Hud: </a><a name="011_078">O my people! Here are my daughters! They are purer
 for you. Beware of Allah, and degrade me not in (the person of) my
 guests. Is there not among you any upright man ?(Hud:78), and in the
 chapter of Al-Hijr: </a><a name="015_070">They said; Have we not
 forbidden you from (entertaining) anyone ?</a><a name="015_071">
 He said: Here are my daughters, if ye must be doing
 (so)(Al_hijr:70-71), such talk is not interpreted on its apparent basis
 but it is interpreted on the basis of a righteous judgement of
 religion, and only God knows its exact interpretations and them who are
 in deep wisdom of this, and they are the ones that quran was revelaed
 in their homes and that is the prophet (PUH) and his viceroys that are
 his Household (PUT). It is said about this matter, that what is meant
 by his daughters is their wives, because people are connected to the
 prophet sent to them by father, so Lot did not offer his own daughter,
 but he offered the daughters of the village and they are their own
 wives as to prevent them from doing the bad deed (sodomy), and some
 said that what is meant by this is that he offered them for marriage
 and not adultery which is something allowed, and it is far away from
 what is apparent, and also it is said that he offered them but not
 seriously for that they might get back and stop harming him for they
 know that they would not do such a deed but it was just an exaggeration
 from him (Lot) to show his unsatisfaction for harming his guests and to
 show his denial for such bad-doings, and it is like a way to stop the
 fight between two persons, like coming to one of them and saying "hit
 me but not him" and if he knew that this person will hit him indeed he
 wouldn't come to do it, and this last interpretation might be the most
 probable, but anyway we know that what is meant by the holy phrase is
 not what is apparent, be aware, and only God knows.<br>
