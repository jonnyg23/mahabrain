 <center><font size="+3">Other Tales About Gog and Magog and What Ðul-Qarnain
 Faced</font></center>
 It is attributed to the prophet (PUH) as mentioned in Al-Majma` [book's
 name] that he was asked about Gog and Magog and he said: Gog is a nation,
 and Magog is another nation, and each one of them has four hundred nations,
 and no man of them die unless he has one thousand descendants that are
 able to carry weapons, they said: O prophet of God describe them for us,
 he said then: they are of three types, one type of them is like the cedar
 tree, they said: O prophet of God what is the cedar? He said: the tall
 tree of Shem lands [you can see this tree on the flag of Lebanon], and
 there is another type of them that their length is the same as their width
 and no iron nor mountain can resist them (maybe this is an expression to
 show their strength), and another type that lies on one ear and cover hisself
 with the other, and they do not face an elephant or beast or camel or pig
 unless they eat it and whoever dies of them they eat him as well, their
 front would be in the lands of Shem and their end would be in Khurâsân,
 they drink the rivers of the east and the lake of Tabariyah. In another
 version it is added: they will go out for the people and drink the waters
 and the people will be fortified in their forts against them and then they
 (Gog and Magog) will throw their arrows into the sky and they will get
 it back and as if there were blood on them and they (Gog and Magog) would
 say: we've conquered the people on lands and we've come higher than heavens'
 creatures, then God will send over them bugs on their backs and will get
 into their ears and they shall die by them.
 <br>God said in the chapter of Al-Kahf: They will ask thee of Dhu'l-Qarneyn.
 Say: I shall recite unto you a remembrance of him, Lo! We made him strong
 in the land and gave him unto every thing a road(Al-Kahf:83-84), and it
 is attributed to `Ali (ben Abi-Tâlib)(PUH) about the interpretation
 of God's saying "Lo! We made him strong in the land" it means that God
 gave him the clouds to carry him and gave him many roads and gave him the
 light so there was no difference for day and night for him..etc, and it
 is mentioned that Ðul-Qarnain once passed over an old man while he
 was praying and he did not get scared or afraid of his armies, so Ðul-Qarnain
 asked him about this, and he (the old man) said to him: i was praying to
 the One that is more powerful and has more armies and more kingdoms than
 you do, and if I turned my face to you I would not get my request answered
 by Him. They say also that he passed over another old man that was flipping
 between his hands some skulls, so Ðul-Qarnain said to him: O old man
 why are you flipping these skulls? He answered: to know the noble from
 the poor but I couldn't know and I'm flipping these for twenty years, so
 Ðul-Qarnain then moved on, and knew that this situation was a lesson
 for him.
 <br>While he was wandering he met the Wise Nation that are part of Moses'
 nation (PUH), that they guide to the truth and justice, and he found them
 as a nation that are so simple and just and divide everything to equal
 parts among them and judge with justice, and they console each other and
 have passion for each other, so their situation is always one and their
 word is always one and their way is straight, and the graves of their dead
 is inside their house and in front of their rooms' doors, while their houses
 have no doors and they have no rulers. They say that Ðul-Qarnain was
 hit by his people on his right horn [horn here is an expression to mean
 "side of the head"] and God made him die for five hundred years and resurrected
 him again, and then God sent him again to his people and they hit him on
 his left horn and God made him die for five hundred years again, and then
 God sent him again and made him rule the easts and wests and built the
 barrier, and when Ðul-Qarnain used to pass over some villages he would
 roar like an angry lion so then darkness starts to get over the village
 with storms and lightnings that destroys everyone that opposes him, and
 when he reached the setting-place of the sun, all of the people from east
 to west, and this is mentioned in some interpretations about God's saying
 "Lo! We made him strong in the land."
 <br>They say that Ðul-Qarnain had been told about a spring that is
 called the spring of life, and anything that has a life would live up to
 the doomsday time if they drink of it, so then Ðul-Qarnain called Al-Khidhr
 (PUH) [Al-Khidhr, not a prophet but a faithful man. his story is well known
 with Moses in Quran although Quran did not mention his name apparently.
 Please refer to the chapter of Al-Kahf in Quran to read the story of Moses
 and his servant (his servant supposed to be Joshua). In the Kuwaiti island
 of Failaka they say there were footprints for Al-Khidhr and it was a subject
 for visits and pilgrimage but they say the authorities removed the trace],
 and he was one of his best companions, and also called for three hundred
 and sixty men, and gave each one of them a fish and then he said to them:
 go to that specific location for there are three hundred and sixty springs,
 so let every one of you cleans his fish over one spring that is not similar
 to the others' springs, so they went and found the springs and every one
 of them started to clean his fish and Al-Khidhr sat down to clean his fish,
 then the fish slipped for his hand and went into the spring and swam and
 God made it alive, but Al-Khidhr stayed amazed for what he saw and then
 he said to himself: what shall I say to Ðul-Qarnain? Then he took off
 his clothes and swam after the fish but couldn't catch it, and then all
 the men went back to Ðul-Qarnain and he commanded to get all the fishes
 from the men, and when they came to Al-Khidhr he had nothing in his hands,
 so Ðul-Qarnain called him and said to him: how is your fish? So he
 told him about what happened, and he asked: what did you do then? He answered:
 I swam after it in the water and tried to find it but did not, so then
 he said to him: did you drink of that water? He answered: yes I did, then
 Ðul-Qarnain went to trace back the spring but couldn't find it, so
 then he said to Al-Khidhr: you were the chosen one.
 <br>It is mentioned also that Ðul-Qarnain reached a great island and
 he saw there some people that wear leaves of the trees and live in the
 caves, and he asked them about detailed matters in wisdom and religion
 and they answered him the best, then he said to them: ask your needs, they
 said to him: we ask for eternity in life, he said: I can't do that, then
 they said to him: we ask for health in our bodies, he answered then: I
 can't, they said to him then: we want to know how long are our ages, he
 said then: I don't know this for myself so how shall I know yours? They
 said then: then let us ask all of that from the One who is able to do this
 and even greater, and the people started to look at his numerous armies,
 and among them there were an old man that did not lift his head up, so
 Ðul-Qarnain said to him: why don't you look to whatever the people
 are looking at? So the old man said: I wonder about the king that came
 before you, so Ðul-Qarnain said: why so? Then the old man said: we
 had a king and a poor man and they died in one day, and then I left them
 for a while and came back later on and I tried to identify who is the king
 and who is the poor man but I couldn't, and then Ðul-Qarnain left them
 and went on.
 <br>Some say that Ðul-Qarnain did a pilgrimage with six hundred thousand
 knights and he met with Abraham (PUH) and Abraham said to him: how did
 you pass you life? He said: by eleven words (phrases), glorified is He
 who remains with no doom, glorified is He who knows and never forget, glorified
 is He who keeps and never miss, glorified is He who sees with no doubt,
 glorified is He who is eternal and never sleeps, glorified is He the King
 that never gets defeated, glorified is He the Exalted that never gets wronged,
 glorified is He who is hidden and cannot be seen, glorified is He who is
 wide with no show off, glorified is He who is active with no play, glorified
 is He who is Living with no miss. In Majma` Al-Bahrain for Al-Torayhi [notice:
 the same name appeared in the last chapter but the author name was mentioned
 as Al-Tariji, and this difference because of some printing mistakes in
 the book itself] it is mentioned: Ðul-Qarnain is a name for Eskandar
 (Alexander) the Roman [seems the author of that book means the Greek but
 he did not distinguish properly] and he was at the time after Jesus the
 son of Mary (PUH) and so how come he met with Abraham (PUH) and Abraham
 appeared before that time by more than two thousand years, or they might
 met each other by a dream which is something not so propable, and in the
 same time existed Nebuchadnezzar and ignorance (disbelieving) all over,
 but the time of Ðul-Qarnain was a time when he ruled over the east
 and west and justice spread all over the land and the word of God was the
 highest, so how come to gather both times together and the holy quran emphasized
 on the fact that he was victorious without a doubt, and maybe everything
 is possible and the truth is known by God only, and at the time of Abraham
 there was Nimrod and the people of Lot and the pharaohs filled the land,
 and where was Alexandria at that time?
 <br>We do not doubt a lot about what was mentioned about Ðul-Qarnain,
 and maybe this name was given to two, or maybe Eskandar (Alexander) is
 different than Ðul-Qarnain, and so Alexander was in a time period and
 Ðul-Qarnain was at the time of Abraham (PUH), and only God knows.
 <br>There was much debate about his true identity, they said: he was a
 servant that was given wisdom and kingdom by God, and some said: he was
 a prophet that God opened the lands by him. As attributed to `Ali (ben
 Abi-Tâlib) (PUH) when he was asked about wether he (Ðul-Qarnain)
 was a prophet or a king, he (PUH) said: a faithful servant that loved God
 and God loved him, and gave adivces for the sake of God and God adviced
 him. We've mentioned before that the world was owned by two faithful men
 and two disbelievers, and the faithful were: Solomon ben David and Ðul-Qarnain,
 and the two disbelievers were: Nimrod and Nebuchadnezzar. About calling
 him Ðul-Qarnain, more than what we've mentioned before, some said that
 he was called like that because he had two braids, and some said because
 he reached the two extreme points of earth, and some said because his father
 and mother were nobles, and some said because two main tribes of people
 were extinct at his time, and some said because he got into the light and
 darkness, and some said because he was given the knowledge of the apparent
 the hidden things.
