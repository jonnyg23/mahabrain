 <center><font size="+3">The Wife of The Pharaoh, Âsiyyah bent Muzâhim</font></center>
 She was one of the Israelites and was a faithful woman, and she was keeping
 her faith a secret to avoid the pharaoh, and when Moses defeated the wizards
 and they all believed in Moses and his Lord and lot of the Israelites showed
 their faith in Moses as well, she then showed his faith and her love to
 God and her tongue mentioned the sanctification for Him, so when the pharaoh
 knew about that, he got extremely angry and forbade her but she did not
 stop, so then he started to torture her, and as attributed to Ibn-`Abbâs
 that he said: the pharaoh took his wife Âsiyyah and when he knew
 that she was a believer and tortured her in several ways to let her stop
 believing, so then Moses passed by while she was being tortured so she
 complained to him by moving her finger so he prayed to God to have some
 relief towards her and so God did and she did not feel the pains of torture
 and she did not die because of the torture and she said while being tortured:
 My Lord! Build for me a home with thee in the Garden, and deliver me from
 Pharaoh and his work, and deliver me from evil-doing folk(Al-Tahreem:11),
 so God inspired to her to lift her head up and so she did and she saw her
 home in paradise and it was built with pearls so she laughed, and the pharaoh
 then said: look how crazy she is, she laughs while being tortured. Some
 say that she was tortured under the sun and when everyone is gone away
 from her the angels came down to her and showed her her house in paradise.
 <br>As it is attributed to the prophet (PUH) he said: the best women of
 paradise are four, Khadijah bent Khuwaylid [The prophet's wife] and Fâtimah
 bent Muhammad [the prophet's daughter], and Mary the daughter of Amram
 [Mary the mother of Jesus], and Âsiyyah bent Muzâhim, the pharaoh's
 wife. In a long narration that he (PUH) considered Ezekiel and his job
 and his wife and children, and his wife was the brusher for the pharaoh's
 daughters and she was a believer and once the brush fell off her hand and
 she said: by name of God! Then the daughter of the pharaoh said: he is
 my father, but the brusher the wife of Ezekiel said: no but He is my Lord
 and your Lord and your father's Lord, so the daughter told her father the
 pharaoh and so he called her with her children and said to her: who is
 your lord? She said: my and your lord is God, so then he ordered for an
 oven made of copper and it was boiled and then called her with her children
 and warned her but she did not get back to his religion and so when he
 wanted to throw her with her children into the oven she said: I request
 from you to gather my bones with my children's bones and bury them, he
 said then: your request will be fulfilled for the rights you have unto
 us, so then he ordered their children to be thrown into the oven one by
 another while she was looking at them and the last of them was an infant
 which said to his mother: be patient mother you are on the truthful way,
 and then she was thrown into the oven with her infant, until he (PUH) said
 at the end: and the wife of the pharaoh was one of the Israelites and she
 was a faithful woman and she used to worship God in secret until the pharaoh
 killed the wife of Ezekiel then she saw the angels flying with her soul
 and she was sure of that by many signs and so her faith increased and while
 she was like that the pharaoh went to her and told her what did he do,
 so then she said: woe to you O pharaoh! how dare you against God the Exalted,
 so he said to her: maybe you've been crazy like your mate before, so she
 said to him then: not been crazy but I believed in God, my Lord and your
 Lord and the Lord of the worlds, until he (PUH) said: then the pharaoh
 swore that she will taste the death or disbelieve in the God of Moses,
 and then he (PUH) said: then her mother met her and asked her to be with
 the pharaoh but she denied to be so and said: to disbelieve in God then
 this is something I will not do, so then the pharaoh ordered to bring her
 and she was stended by four wedges in her hands and legs and kept on torturing
 her until she died. So may peace be upon her with her mate.
