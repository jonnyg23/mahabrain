 <div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><big><span style="font-family: times new roman;">Isaac ben Abraham (PUT)<br>
 </span></big></big></big><br>
 <div style="text-align: left;">&lt;&gt;<big><small><span style="font-family: times new roman;">His mother is Sarah the daughter
 of Bethuel ben Nahor which is by turn the brother of Terah and the
 uncle of Abraham (PUH), so she is the daughter of the cousin of Abraham
 and also his maternal cousin, as it was mentioned before, and Isaac was
 born after his brother Ishmael by five years, and this is the most
 famous for us, and in Torah it is mentioned that he was born and
 Ishmael was fourteen years old, and as Al-Mas`udi mentioned, that
 Ishmael was born and Abraham was eighty six years old or eighty seven
 and Isaac was born while he was one hundred and twenty years old, and
 the angels brought the happy tidings to Abraham about his son Isaac,
 and Sarah heard the tidings and laughed for it was weird for her to
 have children from an old man and an old barren woman, so the angels
 said to her: Do you wonder from the commandments of God? In other
 phrases God said: </span></small></big><a name="037_112"><span style="font-family: times new roman;">And we gave him tidings of the
 birth of Isaac, a prophet of the righteous(Al-Sâffât:112).
 Also God said: </span></a><a style="font-family: times new roman;" name="037_113">And We blessed him and Isaac. And of their seed are
 some who do good, and some who plainly wrong
 themselves(Al-Sâffât:113), and: </a><a style="font-family: times new roman;" name="019_049">We gave him Isaac
 and Jacob. Each of them We made a prophet. </a><a name="019_050">And
 we gave them of Our mercy, and assigned to them a high and true renown</a><a style="font-family: times new roman;" name="019_049">(Maryam:49-50).
 God also said: </a><a name="051_028">and gave him tidings of (the
 birth of) a wise son.</a><a name="051_029"> Then his wife came forward,
 making moan, and smote her face, and cried: A barren old
 woman!(Al-Ðariyat:28-29).</a>&gt;<br>
 &lt;&gt;<a name="051_029">Apparently, in quran there was nothing about Isaac
 much more than tidigins brought about him, and about him being a
 prophet. Yes, and we've mentioned befoer that in Torah and the Bible,
 the one that was to be slained was Isaac and not Ishmael, and we've
 mentioned a lot of details about this in the previous section when we
 talked about the conditions of Abraham (PUH) and explained what is true
 and explained that the one that was to be slained was Ishmael and not
 Isaac. It is mentioned that Isaac (PUH) lived for one hundred and
 eighty years and was buried in Jirun (Hebron), and it is the city of
 Al-Khaleel, in the cave of Al-Makfeelah (Machpelah). Isaac got married
 after his father as in some tales by a woman called Youmhâ' the
 daughter of Bethuel, and she born him Al-`Ays (Esau) and Jacob as
 twins, but Esau came first then followed by Jacob, and when they were
 born Isaac was sixty years old and went blind, this is what was
 mentioned. He prayed for his son Jacob to have the leadership of his
 people and the prophecy in his descendants, and prayed for his son Esau
 to get the kingdom and power and in his descendants as well. He was one
 hundred and righty five years old when he died and was buried with his
 father and the places for their toms is famous and they are placed
 almost like eighteen miles away from Jerusalem in a mosque there called
 the mosque of Abraham [Arabic: Masjid Ibrâhim], and this is all
 mentioned in Muruj Al-Ðahab for Al-Mas`udi.</a>&gt;<br>
 &lt;&gt;<a name="051_029"></a>&gt;<br>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: left;">&lt;&gt;<a name="051_029">What is mentioned in
 Torah about his marriage, in summary, is that when Abraham became old
 and were not able to work anymore, he commanded his servant, Elazar,
 and told him to work on the marriage of his son Isaac and pick for him
 a wife from his own tribe and lands in Iraq, and told him to be aware
 from letting him get married to a daughter of the Canaanites that were
 in Palestine, and told him to never let Isaac get back again to the
 land that went out from which is Iraq, and never let him go back there
 even if his wife denied coming with him to his lands in Palestine. Then
 Elazar got ready for the travel and took with him everything applicable
 for the wife and her family, and went to Iraq, to the lands of the
 family. When he reached that land he stopped his camels before the town
 which is Padan-Aram and it is the town in which Abraham used to live,
 and his father there was a carpenter, as it is mentioned in the book of
 Barnaba, and it is the town in which his tribe lives with his relatives
 and there lives the desired man which is Nahor ben Terah, the brother
 of Abraham, but he was dead at that time, and none are left there
 except his children and their leader was Bethuel ben Nahor, and when
 Elazar stopped his camels before the city and wanted to get in, he saw
 a beautiful girl getting out of the city and carrying a jar, so Elazar
 said to her: get me some water, and so she did and welcomed him, then
 he asked about her family and he knew she is the daughter of Bethuel
 ben Nahor, so then when he knew her and her family he became so happy
 about it and asked about her father and wether he has a place for
 hospitality, and she said yes, then he presented himself as the servant
 of Abraham and he wants to take a wife for Isaac, and she is the one
 desired for this and no one else, then he made her wore some jewels and
 golden bracelets and she walked in front of him telling her family
 about the happy tidings and the dear guest from her uncle Abraham, and
 the girl's name was Refqah (Rebekah). When the girl told her family
 about the messenger from Abraham their uncle and about his living
 place, immediately Lâbân ben Bethuel (Laban) went to his
 place and welcomed him and came with him to his own place and they were
 all happy for the visit of the messenger of Abraham, their uncle. Then
 after he stayed for a while with them he told them why he is here and
 he wants Rebekah for the son of his master and so they answered him
 with what he desires, then Elazar, Abraham's messenger, gave her
 vessels made of gold and silver with some clothes and ornaments, and
 also gave to her brother Laban ben Bethuel and to her mother and
 destributed the rest over her family, and after the rest he asked them
 to get her prepared, so they answered his request and made her prepared
 for such an occasion, and Rebekah then agreed for his request to leave
 in a hurry, and so he picked her to the lands of his master, and when
 they arrived and Isaac looked at her, he got so happy for her and she
 had been a joy for him after the death of his mother Sarah.<br>
 Then Rebekah gave birth to a twin, and they are `Eesu (Esau) and
 Ya`qoob (Jacob), and she born first Esau then Jacob. We say, we can
 agree on both stories, this and the one before, as one story. The
 difference are in the names of `Eesu and Al-`Ays and that might be
 because of expressing in Arabic and Hebrew, and also in wether the
 marriage was during the life of Abraham or after his death, and in the
 different names of the wife of Isaac, Youmhâ' [could not trace
 this name back to any source] and Rebekah, and might be that one is a
 name and the other is a title, but the story in Torah is more
 believable for what it contains and it is more closer to reality, and
 only God knows.<br>
 As attributed to Al-Râawandi in his tales, there is one tale that
 has a connection somehow with out subject, and that is there was at the
 time of Abraham (PUH) a man called Mâriyyah ben Aws, and he was
 six hundred and sixty years old and he used to live in a place like a
 peninsula surrounded by waters and swamps, and he used to go out for
 people once every three years and live in the desert, and he had a
 mosque and he used to pray to God there and guide people to the
 religion of God and teach them the goodness, so one day he went out to
 the desert as he used to do and he saw a cattle and as if they had fat
 upon them, and he was amazed for that, and saw a young man with it and
 his face was like the face of the moon, so he asked him about the
 cattle and about their owner, so he answered: they are for Abraham,
 then he asked him about himself and he answered: I am his son Isaac.
 Then Mâriyyah said for himself: O Lord let me see your friend
 Abraham before I die. Isaac then told his father Abraham about what
 happened between him and Mâriyyah ben Aws and about his
 conditions, then after three years he went out as he used to be and
 found a man in that place that he never saw before and the man asked
 him about his conditions and his place, so Mâriyyah ben Aws
 answered him and described his place for him, then the man showed the
 passion for staying with Mâriyyah to look at his way of living
 and Mâriyyah answered him that he can't pass over to his place,
 so then the man asked: why? have you not a bridge? He said: No, but I
 walk over water, so the main said: maybe the One that exploited water
 for you will exploit the water for me as well, so then they walked
 together until they reached the water, then Mâriyyah said: By the
 name of God, and he passed over the water surface, then the man said:
 By the name of God, and passed over the water surface, then
 Mâriyyah looked at him while walking and he was amazed, then they
 reached the residence of Mâriyyah and the man stayed with him for
 three days, and Mâriyyah used to live on fruit and dries out some
 of them for winter season. So when the man wanted to leave him he
 (Mâriyyah) asked him about his name, so the man said: I am
 Abraham, the friend of God, and Mâriyyah before that used to pray
 to God to see His friend, so when he heard his name and knew who he is,
 he went to him and hugged him adn thanked God for answering his prays,
 and there are other long matters that no need to mention here and what
 we've mentioned is enough for now and God knows His servants and
 creations, and He knows everything.<br>
