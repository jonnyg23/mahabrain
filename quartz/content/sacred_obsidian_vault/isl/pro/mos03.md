 <center><font size="+3">Moses Going Out From Egypt to Midian With Fear</font></center>
 Moses went out in a hurry from Egypt and he did not get ready for travelling
 but only depending on God to guide him to the right way, and he was with
 no companions or with a caravan in that long and hard travel, because he
 was one that seeking safety for himself by himself and afraid of an enemy
 that wants to kill him and has no other target except to have his blood
 and he is the tyrant of this earth and he made all of the people as soldiers
 for himself and as slaves, and so he (Moses) can not prepare for travelling
 and he had no one to ally with him and no one to take his advice. As attributed
 to Al-Tabari that he said that Moses had nothing to eat except of the leaves
 of the trees and he went out of Egypt with barefoot, and when he reached
 Midian his bottom feet skin fell down because the long walk affected his
 feet bitterly.
 <br>As mentioned by Ibn-`Abbâs: he (Moses) reached the waters of
 Midian, and the green color of the vegetables would appear obviously from
 behind his abdomen for his thin-looking body, and when he reached the water
 of Midian he saw groups of people seeking water for their cattles and saw
 two women keeping their sheeps away from the water waiting the powerful
 shepherds to finish watering their sheeps and when they finish they then
 come to seek the water that is left for they had no man or the power to
 compete with others, and they were weak so they have to be late until no
 one is there, and the people that got the power would seek first the waters
 of the wells because it is cleaner and purer, and the water that lasts
 at the end would be mixed with mud from the bottom of the well, as one
 poet said:
 <center><b>We drink in our attendance clean water</b>
 <br><b>And other than us would drink sadness with mud</b></center>
 Some historians said: Moses (PUH) was a serious man and a truthful one
 too, and when he saw such a thing he did not like to see women staying
 at the end until men finish, so he asked the two women about their need
 and why they keep their sheeps away, so they said to him: we do not approach
 water until all of these men leave, for if we tried to reach water and
 compete with them they would keep us away by their power and we have no
 one to protect us, and we wait here because our father is an old man and
 can not take care of everything. So then Moses protected them and banished
 all of the shepherds and reached the well and watered their sheeps and
 no one could keep him away because they respected the powerful always and
 they saw his strength and dealt with him in respect in return.
 <br>And some interpreters said: Moses found a large rock and water cannot
 be reached except by removing it by many powerful people, so he took it
 off from the well and watered for the two women, but the holy phrases in
 quran say it apprently that there were lot of people over the well so there
 were no need to remove the cover of the well if it had any, for the presence
 of the people already watering their sheeps is not done unless the well
 was already uncovered. Then the daughters of Jethro went back to their
 father with their sheeps and when he saw them he was amazed for their early
 coming, but when he knew their story with Moses he accepted that and sent
 one of them to call Moses, and she went to him in a place near by the well
 and said to him with embarrassment: my father is calling for you to reward
 you for your deed with us, and then, because Moses was so tired and hungry
 which made him so weak, said: My Lord! I am needy of whatever good Thou
 sendest down for me.
 <br>It is mentioned that he did not ask for anything more than bread to
 eat it with the vegetables of the ground. He saw that the relief is close
 and God answered his prays and the relief is coming from the side of that
 woman and her father. Some interpreters like Ibn-`Abbâs and others
 said that he requested food, and some said that he made one of the two
 women hear him saying: My Lord! I am needy of whatever good Thou sendest
 down for me, as to show them that he needs some help for he had no money
 nor something to eat, so his pray was like a pray that was answered immediately,
 or it might be just that the beautiful deed bears the fruit so fast and
 God increases the rewards for His faithful worshippers. Just by calling
 him to her father he went with her in a hurry and saying to her: be behind
 me, for I am someone from a family that did not use to look at the backs
 of woman, so guide me while I am behind you.
 <br>Some interpreters said: he said that to her and made her behind him
 because in the first time he walked behind her and the wind then stroke
 her dress and showed some of her skin and so he asked her to be behind
 him and asked her for guidance while he is in the front, and othes said:
 Moses was a man that lived in luxury in the house of the pharaoh, and then
 he had troubles which made him so hungry that he would accept any wage
 for deeds of bravery, and hunger can make lions accept the dead corpses,
 and then he said: I think if he was in a luxury, he would not accept to
 take wages for his deeds, then he went to that old man and he welcomed
 him with hospitality and signs of happiness, then he asked him about what
 happened to him and what is his story after banishing hunger away from
 him and calming him down, and then Moses told him his story and told him
 everything about himself and about the deeds of the pharaoh with the Israelites
 as for killing the children and captivating the women and making the Israelites
 as slaves, and he told him how he escaped from them in amazement and by
 the hardest ways, and he told him also about all the hard times that his
 mother faced to give birth to him up to his story with the coptic man that
 he killed without meaning so, and how then they asked for him to take revenge
 and then he escaped from them to the waters of Midian, all of these were
 stories in a sequence and destined in the knowledgement of He who knows
 the destiny for a purpose He knows the better, so when he (Jethro) heard
 all of that he calmed him down and said: Fear not! Thou hast escaped from
 the wrongdoing folk, and so God said in the chapter of Al-Qasas: And when
 he turned his face toward Midian, he said: Peradventure my Lord will guide
 me in the right road. And when he came unto the water of Midian he found
 there a whole tribe of men, watering. And he found apart from them two
 women keeping back (their flocks). He said: What aileth you? The two said:
 We cannot give (our flocks) to drink till the shepherds return from the
 water; and our father is a very old man. So he watered (their flock) for
 them. Then he turned aside into the shade, and said: My Lord! I am needy
 of whatever good Thou sendest down for me. Then there came unto him one
 of the two women, walking shyly. She said: Lo! my father biddeth thee,
 that he may reward thee with a payment for that thou didst water (the flock)
 for us. Then, when he came unto him and told him the (whole) story, he
 said: Fear not! Thou hast escaped from the wrongdoing folk(Al-Qasas:22-25).
 <br>They say that he passed over that distance from Egypt to Midian in
 three days and when he reached Midian he saw a well that used to water
 the sheeps, so he sat down on the side and he did not eat anything for
 three days, so then he looked at two maids keeping away with their sheeps
 so he said to them: why don't you water your sheeps? They answered: we
 wait for others to finish and our father is an old man, so mercy took over
 Moses and got closer to the well and said to the one over the well: give
 me one bucket of water and then one for you as well, and one bucket was
 carried only by ten people at least, so he had one bucket only by himself
 for the daughters of Jethro and watered their sheeps, and then went to
 the shade and said: My Lord! I am needy of whatever good Thou sendest down
 for me.
 <br>It is mentioned that the Imam (`Ali ben Abi-Tâlib PUH) swore
 by God that he (Moses) did not ask for anything more than a bread to eat
 with the vegetables and they saw the green color of the vegetables inside
 his abdomen because of his thin-looking body. Some said that the distance
 that he passed over took him eight nights and he had nothing for food but
 only the leaves of the trees, as mentioned before. When the daughters of
 Jethro came back he said to them: you are early this time! Then they told
 him the story of Moses and they did not know him yet, so then Jethro said
 to one of them: go to him and call him to pay him for what he did for us,
 and then she went to him approaching shyly and said to him then: my father
 is calling for you to pay you what you did for us, so he went with her
 and then the wind stroke her dress and some of her skin appeared, so then
 Moses said to her: be behind me and guide me to the path for I am from
 a family that did not use to look at the backs of women, so when he went
 to Jethro he told him his story and Jethro said to him then: Fear not!
 Thou hast escaped from the wrongdoing folk..etc, it is mentioned that when
 the daughter of Jethro came to Moses and said to him: my father calls for
 you to pay for you what you did for us, Moses then hated to follow her,
 but he did not find any other way around for he was in a land that he does
 not know, and when he got into the house of Jethro he found the dinner
 was ready, so then Jethro said: sit O young man and have dinner, so then
 Moses said: God forbid! Jethro said then: and why is that, aren't you hungry?
 He said: yes, but I am afraid that this is as for the service I did to
 you and I am from a household that do not sell the reward of the after-life
 with all the gold on earth, then Jethro said: no and I swear by God, but
 it is my habit and my fathers' as well to do hospitality for the guests
 and every passer by.
