 Into The Farm</font></center>
 In the chapter of Al-Anbiyâ': And David and Solomon, when they gave
 judgment concerning the field, when people's sheep had strayed and browsed
 therein by night; and We were witnesses to their judgment. And We made
 Solomon to understand (the case); and unto each of them We gave judgment
 and knowledge(Al-Anbiyâ':78-79) and in the chapter of Sâd:
 And hath the story of the litigants come unto thee? How they climbed the
 wall into the royal chamber; How they burst in upon David, and he was afraid
 of them. They said: Be not afraid! (We are) two litigants, one of whom
 hath wronged the other, therefor judge aright between us; be not unjust;
 and show us the fair way. Lo! this my brother hath ninety and nine ewes
 while I had one ewe; and he said: Entrust it to me, and he conquered me
 in speech(Sâd:21-23).
 <br>Here we have to cases: the straying of the sheeps into the field and
 the climbing into the royal champer. The first is shared by David and his
 son Solomon (PUT) and the second is special for David, and about the case
 of the straying of sheeps it is as attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH) about
 this holy phrase is that the rules of prophets before David upto his time
 was that the sheeps and other domestic animals like camels and cows, if
 they grazed upon some plants then the owner of these plants or agriculture
 will be the owner of them and the straying is only done at night for the
 owner of the farm must guard his farm at daytime and the owner of the sheep
 must guard his sheeps at night time, so David judged with what the prophets
 had judged with before him, so then God inspired to Solomon and he was
 eleven years old at that time, as it was mentioned: any sheep that graze
 in other's farm, then the owner of the farm has only the right to get what
 is formed in their bodies, and this is how it went (for judges) after Solomon,
 so Solomon ordered to get the sheeps back for the owner of the farm and
 get benefit of their milk and their offsprings and their wools, and the
 farm shall be in the hands of the sheeps owners to fix it and get it back
 as it was before it was grazed upon, and then after that everything gets
 back to how it was and the sheeps get back to their owners and the farm
 to its owner and this is the judgement of Solomon that God made him understand,
 so everyone of them, David and Solomon, judged with the commands of God
 and they did not disobey the commandments of God, and it is by God's saying:
 and unto each of them We gave judgment and knowledge(Al-Anbiyâ':79).
 <br>In another narration it is mentioned that God inspired to David to
 make a successor for himself from his family because I knew in My ancient
 knowledge that I do not send a prophet except with a successor from his
 own family, and David had many children that time and the one that was
 assigned to be by God was Solomon, and then directly two men came to David
 to judge for their farm and sheeps and then God inspired to David to gather
 all his sons and whoever judges with a rightful judgement in this case
 then he is your successor, so then David gathered all his sons and when
 the two men told their stories Solomon said to the farmer: O farmer, when
 did this man's sheeps go into your farm? He answered: they went into it
 by night, then he said: I judge you O owner of the sheeps to give the offsprings
 of your sheeps and their milk and their wools for the owner of the farm
 in this year, and then David said to him: how come you did not judge with
 giving the sheeps and the scholars of the Israelites did assure that before
 and the price of the eaten plants is the price of the sheeps? Then said
 Solomon: the plants were not taken out from the roots but the sheeps did
 eat its top and this would return back in the future, and then God inspired
 to David that the judgement in this case is what Solomon did judge with.
 There are other narrations of the Household (PUT) with the same meaning
 and some of them include the addition of the two judgements together where
 the sheeps did eat the root and the branch then the farm owner would have
 the sheep, or otherwise it is as Solomon did judge with. Solomon also judged
 to keep the sheeps by their owners at night and to keep the farm by its
 owners at daytime, as it was mentioned before. Meditate!
 <br>As for the case of the climbing into the royal champer they said: David
 divided his time and made one day for worshipping and a day for advising
 and sermons and a day to judge for the people and a day for his ownself,
 and he put some guards on his door so that no one could go inside without
 his permission and no one would dare to go inside except by his agreement.
 In the day of his worshipping while he stayed away from the people and
 praying in his champer, then two men climbed the wall and got inside while
 he thought he is in safe from anyone that desires to go inside because
 there were guards, so they went down to him from the roof or the ceiling
 and he got afraid and they said to him then: do be afraid we are two men
 in fight that one had wronged the other so judge between us with just and
 do not wrong, meaning do not wrong us with your judgement, and guide is
 to the righteous path of just, this is my brother he has ninety nine ewes
 and I have only one ewe, and it is the female of the sheep, and he said
 to me: entrust it to me, meaning to be of my own, so that I would have
 a complete one hundred ewes, and he conquered me in the speech, so that
 he won against me and defeated me and I couldn't do anything, and then
 David said to the owner of one ewe: he wronged you by asking you for your
 only ewe, and David denied the greed of the owner of many ewes and he described
 him as a wrong-doer and made it as a great awful thing is to attack the
 owner of the one ewe and he said: many partners oppress one another, save
 such as believe and do good works, and they are few(Sâd:24), and
 then David looked back to the two of them and found them as angels and
 not human beings and that God sent them to him to warn him for something
 he had done.
 <br>God had tested him with their imaginary fight and in fact there were
 no fight and they had nothing but to warn him for what he had done: And
 David guessed that We had tried him(Sâd:24), meaning We tested him
 by that case and he was aware, and he sought forgiveness of his Lord, and
 he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and repented(Sâd:24), meaning
 he prostrated to his Lord with humiliation and he felt that he judged so
 fast for the owner of the one ewe and called the owner of many ewes as
 a wrong-doer and did not ask the man under the charge and did not ask for
 clues from the claiming man, and he felt that he did something wrong against
 the regulations and what the sacred law did regulate. For this he did prostrate
 with regret and humiliation for his Lord and asking for forigveness. This
 what happened with him and from him since the time of angels revelation
 while he was in his champer. They said about the reason for revealing these
 holy phrases is that David was inclined to marry a woman that her husband
 died and she completed her mourning period. The situation is that he is
 in no need to marry her because he already had many wives, and for the
 Israelites that was prohibited before the time of David but God made it
 legal for him. What happened with him is that he married the wife of Uriah
 after his death and after she completed the time of mourning , and Uriah
 was a faithful man and the neighbour of David and he was killed in the
 camp of David, so David married his wife after she had completed the time
 of her mourning but the Israelites denied doing this as we mentioned before.
 <br>It is mentioned by Al-Ridhâ (PUH) in a speech for him about the
 infallibility of prophets and he mentioned David and made him infallible
 and away from any wrong doing and mentioned him with great deeds and then
 the Imâm (PUH) asked someone that was attending and he (PUH) knows
 better what he is asking about but that was only to make a way for the
 speech to come and to obtain the things. So he (PUH) said: what do people
 say about the case of David and his mistake? They said: they say that David
 was praying in his champer when Iblis (Satan) had the shape of a bird that
 no other bird had its beauty, so David then cut off praying and went to
 the bird trying to catch him, but the bird went out into the house and
 he kept on behind it, but the bird flew to the roof and he went up there
 trying to catch him and the bird down to the house of Uriah (ben Hayyân)
 and David looked at him there and he found the wife of Uriah washing herself
 and she was naked and when he looked at her he loved her and desired her,
 and at the time he (David) sent Uriah for some invasions, so he sent to
 his friend and the high commander of the army to make Uriah at the front
 of the ark, and so he did and he defeated the enemies and that was hard
 for David, so he sent again and commanded to make Uriah at the front again,
 and so he did and he was killed then and David married his wife. The narrator
 then said: then the Imâm struck his holy forehead with his hand and
 said: Innâ Lillâh Wa'Innâ Ilayhi Raji`un (we are for
 God and to God we will return) [a phrase said when something horrible happens]
 you claimed that a prophet of God took his praying with easiness for a
 bird and then he commited adultery and then killed someone. Then they said:
 O son of the prophet what was his mistake then? Then he (PUH) said: woe
 to you! David only thought that God did not create someone wiser than him
 so God sent down for him the two angels and they climbed the wall of the
 champer and said to him: two men fought against each other...etc, and David
 then made a fast decision against the charged man and said to him (the
 man claiming): he had wronged you for asking you for your only ewe, and
 he did not ask the claiming man for clues and did not ask the charged man
 for explanations, and that was the mistake of David and not what others
 do say, didn't you hear God's saying: O David! Lo! We have set thee as
 a viceroy in the earth; therefor judge aright between mankind..etc(Sâd:26).
 Then they asked the Imâm (PUH): O son of prophet of God then what
 is the story of David with Uriah, so Al-Ridhâ (PUH) then said: the
 woman at the time of David was never to be married after the death of her
 husband, and the first man that God allowed him to marry a woman that her
 husband was killed was David, so he married the wife of Uriah when he was
 killed and her mourning was over, and for this was hard for the people.
 For this it is mentioned by Al-Sâdiq (PUH): the satisfaction of people
 is not to be owned and their tongues are not to be fixed, did not they
 claim that David followed the bird until he looked at the wife of Uriah
 and loved her and he made her husband at the front of the ark until her
 husband got killed and he married her then after? They mentioned that the
 prince of believers (PUH) said: who talked about the narration of David
 as the narrators say it shall be whipped one hundred and sixty times for
 claiming killing with attacking the high place of prophecy. It was one
 punishment with emphasis on attacking the prophet's name with lies.
 <br>It is narrated that David (PUH) climbed up a mountain and there was
 a prophet called Ezekiel on it and he used to worship God there, so David
 took a permission from Ezekiel and God inspired him (Ezekiel) to go and
 meet him so he went down to him and took him from his hand and climbed
 with him up, and then David said: O Ezekiel, ever thought of doing a sin?
 He answered: no, then he (David) said: are you wondering about your own
 worshipping for God? He answered: no, then he (David) said: ever thought
 of life and desired some of its ornaments? He answered: yes, maybe that
 was in my heart, then said he (David): and what do you do then? He answered:
 I go into that room and think about what is inside, so then David went
 into the room and found a bed made of iron with an old skull on it and
 old bones and there were a plate of iron with a scripture: I am Uri ben
 Sâlim, ruled for one thousand years and built one thousand cities
 and deflowered one thousand maidens, and my end was that my bed was to
 the dust and the stones were my pillow and snakes with worms were my neighbours,
 and whoever sees me let him never be tricked by this life.
 <br>It is mentioned before that David married the woman of Uriah after
 her husband's death and ending her mourning, and she gave birth to Solomon
 for him, and that was mentioned for sure. In God's speech: So We forgave
 him that; and lo! he had access to Our presence and a happy journey's end(Sâd:25),
 as it is mentioned by Al-Tabarsi: they differed in what was the purpose
 of this forigveness, and for why David did ask for forgiveness, so it was
 said that he got that by isolation to God and humiliation to Him by worshipping
 as it did happen with Abraham as God did tell it: And Who, I ardently hope,
 will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment(Al-Shu`arâ':82), and
 this is the most probable for the high level of infalliblity of prophet
 in all conditions and against all sins as it was proved before, while some
 said: it is allowed to say that they (prophets) do the little sins as it
 is apparent from God's saying: and he sought forgiveness of his Lord, and
 he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and repented(Sâd:24), and
 then from God's acceptance for his forgiveness' seeking: So We forgave
 him that(Sâd:25), and according to this they differed also in the
 case of David, some said: it is that Uriah asked for proposal to a woman
 and her family accepted that marriage but David then went and ased for
 proposal to her after him (Uriah) and because of his holiness they made
 him marry the woman instead of Uriah, and that was a sin and he was blamed
 for it, another saying is that David sent Uriah to some place and he was
 killed but he didn't turn sad for him because he was inclined to marry
 his wife, and that was a sin so he was blamed by sending down on him the
 two angels. A third saying is that when a man was to be dead and leave
 a woman then his masters are the ones to take care of her, and thus when
 Uriah died, David married his wife and her family did not forbid him from
 doing so because of his high place, and that was a sin and so he was to
 be blamed, and a fourth saying is that he was blamed for his fast decisions
 in judging people when the two men came to him and this is what was explained
 afore, and there are other sayings that are needless to say and what we
 had mentioned has enough for you, and God is the Bringer of sucesss.
