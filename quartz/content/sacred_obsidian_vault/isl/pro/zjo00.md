 <center><font size="+3">Zacharias and John (PUT)</font></center>
 Zacharias was mentioned many times in holy Quran in many chapters like:
 Âl-`Imrân, Al-An`âm, Mariam, and Al-Anbiyâ'. He
 was married to Ishâ` (Elisabeth) the daughter of `Imrân (Amram)
 ben Mâþân, the sister of Mary the mother of Jesus (PUH)
 as it was mentioned. He asked God to give him a good son and that was when
 he saw the virtues of Mary the daughter of Amram and how God did take care
 of her, and he used to take care of her and guarded her among all of the
 Israelites, because it was vowed that she would be a servant for the holy
 House or Temple as her story was told by holy Quran by saying: (Remember)
 when the wife of 'Imran said: My Lord! I have vowed unto Thee that which
 is in my belly as a consecrated (offering). Accept it from me. Lo! Thou,
 only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower!(Âl-`Imrân:35), and the
 details will come in their place by God's will.
 <br>It might be that the name of Amram's wife was Hannah and she gave birth
 for Elisabeth, the wife of Zacharias and the mother of John and then to
 Mary the mother of Jesus (PUT), and Zacharias had no children and he got
 so old and his wife was barren, and she was the sister of Mary the daughter
 of Amram as we mentioned before. Amram had a brother that was called Jacob
 ben Mâþân, and the children of Mâþân
 at that time were the leaders of the Israelites and they were the children
 of the kings and descendants of Solomon ben David (PUH), and Zacharias
 was the archpriest and he took care of gifts and vows that were made for
 the Temple and received them, and they argued with him about Mary and whether
 he is the one that should take care of her and he was the one to take care
 of her because he was appointed to take the vows made for the Temple and
 she was vowed with for the Temple and because he is the husband of her
 sister Elisabeth the daughter of Amram, but they didn't accept that and
 decided to make a lot, and God said: Thou wast not present with them when
 they threw their pens (to know) which of them should be the guardian of
 Mary, nor wast thou present with them when they quarrelled (thereupon)(Âl-`Imrân:44).
 <br>It is mentioned that Hannah the wife of Amram when she gave birth to
 Mary, she covered with vlothes and carried her to the Temple and she gave
 her to the rabbis and said: take the one that was vowed to be for the Temple,
 and when they looked at her and they knew that she is the daughter of their
 master, they struggled and competed for which one of them shall take care
 of her, and we've pointed out that the children of Mâþân
 were the leaders of the Israelites and their kings, and then Zacharias
 said: I am the one to take care of her, and we've mentioned before the
 reasons for his right, but they denied to do so except by a lot, and they
 were twenty seven rabbis, and they walked to the nearest river they had
 and that was the Jordan river, and they threw their pens, but all pens
 were drowned except that one of Zacharias and so Zacharias took care of
 her, and he made a house for her and appointed a maid to serve her, and
 he checked her from time to time until she grew up and she stopped using
 the maid to help her and took care of herself alone, and every time he
 was to get into her champer of praying, he would find a gift with her,
 so he asked: from where you got this? and so she answered: this is from
 God, He gives whoever He wants without an account for it.
 <br>it is narrated that when she grew up and used to pray in her praying
 champer, the champer would be enlightened by her halo, and when Zacharias
 visited her he did find the fruit of winter with her in summer time, and
 the fruit of the summer during winter, so he asked her: from where you
 got this? and she answered: it is from God, and then he prayed to God saying:
 My Lord! Bestow upon me of Thy bounty goodly offspring, meaning a good
 blessed son as You gave Hannah and her husband Amram Mary, and then the
 angels called him while he was standing for praying in his champer: Allah
 giveth thee glad tidings of (a son whose name is) John, (who cometh) to
 confirm a word from Allah lordly, chaste, a prophet of the righteous..etc(Âl-`Imrân:39),
 and lordly meaning that he will overcome his people and be their master,
 and without a doubt he was the lord of his people in every good thing and
 never did a sin, and he was the leader of all of those who obey God, and
 chaste because he kept his much so far away from entertainements and lusts.
 <br>It is narrated that once he passed by some kids when he was a kid and
 they were playing and so they invited him to play with them and he answered
 them: not created for playing, and he never came to women, and God mentioned
 the will of his father Zacharias by: Oh, give me from Thy presence a successor
 Who shall inherit of me and inherit (also) of the house of Jacob. And make
 him, my Lord, acceptable (unto Thee)(Mariam:5-6), and the answer of God
 was: O Zachariah! Lo! We bring thee tidings of a son whose name is John;
 we have given the same name to none before (him)(Mariam:7). Before this
 holy phrase he asked God for a son and he used to hide his request and
 ask God and show sorrow for the turning of his hair into white and that
 his bones were weak and he is depaired, but God is able for everything
 and he had the hope in Him and if God willed He would do it with no obstacles,
 and he explained the reason for his request that he was afraid of the kinsfolks
 after his death that they would not be good successors and that they would
 change the faith and work with their opinions, and the answer from God
 was the good tidings about John (PUH).
 <br>It is narrated and it is a famous thing that the pregnancy period for
 John was six months only and it was in the same time that Mary was pregnant
 with Jesus (PUT), and they mentioned that John (PUH) was a brilliant in
 the laws of Moses and he was a well-known resource for everyone asking
 about the conditions and regulations of such laws, and he was complete
 with all characteristics of faith and goodness, and he was giving away
 the life since he was a kid and hanged on to worshipping, so God said about
 him: And we gave him wisdom when a child(Mariam:12).
 <br>It is apparent from the holy phrase that he was given the prophecy
 and he was a prophet since he was a kid and he used to call for God and
 call the people to ask God for forgiveness for their sins, and it is mentioned
 that he ordered them to wash themselves in the river Jordan for forgiveness
 against their sins, and God said: O John! Hold fast the Scripture. And
 we gave him wisdom when a child, And compassion from Our presence, and
 purity; and he was devout, And dutiful toward his parents. And he was not
 arrogant, rebellious. Peace on him the day he was born, and the day he
 dieth and the day he shall be raised alive!..etc(Mariam:12-15). As attributed
 to Al-Ridhâ (PUH) that he said: the most awful moments for this creation
 lie in three positions: the day he is out of his mother's womb and see
 life, and the day when he dies and see the after-life, and the day when
 he is resurrected and see laws that he didn't see in his life, and God
 greeted John in these positions and made him safe against their terror,
 so He said: Peace on him the day he was born, and the day he dieth and
 the day he shall be raised alive!(Mariam:15), and Jesus also greeted himself
 in these three positions and God mentioned what he said: Peace on me the
 day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!(Mariam:33).
 As attributed to Abi-Hamzah Al-Þumâli from Al-Bâqir (PUH)
 that he said: I asked him (PUH) what is the meaning of "And compassion
 from Our presence, and purity?" he (PUH) said: it is meant here how compassionate
 God was with him so that whenever John says: O Lord, God would answer:
 command O John.
 <br>As attributed to the prophet (PUH) that he said: John ben Zacharias
 was so faithful that he went one day to the Temple and he saw the priests
 and rabbis with shileds made of hair and woolen hooded cloaks and they
 holed on the side of their collar-bone and chained it to the fences of
 the Temple, so when he saw that he went to his mother and said: O mother,
 weave for me a shield of hair and a hooded cloak of wool to go to the Temple
 and worship God there with the priests and rabbis, then his mother said:
 I shall do it when the prophet of God (Zacharias) allows me to, and his
 father then heard his speech and said to him: O son, what made you to think
 about it and you are still a young kid, so he answered: O father, didn't
 you see someone younger than me dying and feeling how bitter it was? He
 answered: yes I did, and then he ordered his mother to weave for him a
 shield of hair and a hooded cloak of wool, and so she did and he wore them
 and went to the Temple and worshipped with priests and rabbis until the
 shield started to take off some of his body and one day he looked into
 what was taken away from his body and he cried, and then God inspired to
 him: O John, do you cry for what was taken away froim your body, by My
 Glory if you saw the hell for just a glance you might even wear a shield
 of iron instead of this one made of hair, and then he cried until the tears
 dug off his cheeks and his teeth turned apparent for the people, and his
 mother knew that so she went to him and then came Zacharias and the priests
 with the rabbis to him and his father said to him: O son, what made you
 do this to yourself, I prayed to God to give you to me for my happiness,
 so he said to him: you ordered me with that O father, he wondered and said:
 and when was that O son? He answered: didn't you say that there is an obstacle
 between paradise and hell that is not to be passed except by those who
 cry for their fear of God? He answered: yes, work as hard as you can and
 you are on your own. Then John stood up and cleaned his shield and his
 mother took him and said to him: O son, do you permit me to make for you
 two pieces of felt to cover your teeth and dry out your tears, he said
 to her then: up to you, and so she made for him two pieces of felt to cover
 his teeth and dry out his tears..etc, and the narration is long with details
 about his strange situations and amazing conditions that has nothing like
 them in the field of serving God, the Exalted.
