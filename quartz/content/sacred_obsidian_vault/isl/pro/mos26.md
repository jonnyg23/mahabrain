 <center><font size="+3">Moses' Soliloquy With His Lord</font></center>
 I will not be able as long as I live to mention how much did Moses commune
 with his Lord but the purpose here is to show some of that light, so if
 you understood some of these sermons and measured them with the scale of
 the mind with what our prophet (PUH) came with, with his lightful Quran,
 and with what Islam had provided you with what the caller for his religion
 after him (the prophet) and in special the master of viceroys (`Ali ben
 Abi Tâlib), you shall found them both as twins or two roads for one
 destination or like a soul in two bodies, and you shall know that all the
 prophets and messangers and their viceroys do all agree on calling to the
 true path. As attributed to Ibn `Abbâs he said: said the prophet
 of God (PUH): God communed with Moses ben Amram with one hundred and twenty
 four thousand words in three days and nights and Moses did not eat or drink,
 and when he went out to the Israelites and he heard the speech of the human
 beings he hated them for the sweetness he heard in the words of God.
 <br>As attributed to the prince of believers (PUH) that he said: God said
 to Moses: My advice to you comes in four things, first of them is as long
 you do not see your sins forgiven then do not work the sins of others,
 and the second of them is as long you do not see My treasures been finished
 then do not be sad for what fortune you had, and the third of them is as
 long you do not see My kingdom vanish then do not seek someone else, and
 the fourth of them is as long you do not see the devil dead then do not
 be in safe towards his tricks. As attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH): some
 of what God did say to Moses is that: O son of Amram, lied he who claimed
 to love Me and when night comes he slept away from Me, does not every lover
 likes to be alone with his love? Here I Am O son of Amram watching for
 My lovers when night comes I flip their sights from their hearts toward
 Me and showed them My punishment between their eyes and they talk to Me
 about what they see and their presence, O son of Amram give Me from your
 heart the solemnity and from your body the submission and from your eyes
 the tears at the darkness of the nights then you shall find Me nearby answering
 you.
 <br>As attributed to Al-Hâdi (PUH): when God talked to Moses, Moses
 asked: O my Lord, what is the reward of who believed that I am Your prophet
 and You spoke to me? He answered: O Moses, My angels shall come to him
 and bring him the tidings of paradise, then Moses asked: O my Lord, what
 is the reward of he who stands between Your hands praying, He said: O Moses
 I make pride of him among My angels while he is bowing down and prostrating,
 while he is standing or sitting and whoever I show pride of shall never
 be punished by Me, then Moses asked: O my Lord, what is the reward of he
 who feeds a poor for Your sake, He said: O Moses, I shall command one to
 call at the doomsday over all the creations that this man is avoided from
 being in hell, Moses then asked: O my Lord, what is the reward of he who
 did not forget his relations? He said: O Moses, I shall span his life more
 and make the death moment easy passing for him and the guards of paradise
 shall call him and say to him come and enter from any gate you like, Moses
 then asked: O my Lord, what is the reward of he who avoids hurting people
 and doing his best for them? He answered: O Moses, the hell shall call
 him at the doomsday and say to him "I have no power against you", then
 Moses asked: O my Lord, what is the reward of he who mentions You by his
 tongue and his heart? He answered: O Moses, I shall make shade for him
 by My Throne and make him under My protection, he then asked: what is the
 reward of he who tells Your sermons in secret and in public? God answered
 then: O Moses he shall pass over the path just as lightning, then Moses
 asked: O my Lord, what is the reward of he who had patience toward the
 people's wrong and cursed them by You? He answered: I shall help him to
 come over the adversities of the doomsday, he then asked: O my Lord, what
 is the reward of he who cried because of solemnity towards You? He answered:
 O Moses, I shall protect his face from the heat of hell and I shall make
 him safe at the day of the great fear (doomsday), then Moses asked: O my
 Lord, what is the reward of he who avoided betrayal for shyness of You?
 He answered: O Moses, he shall be in safe at doomsday, Moses then asked:
 O my Lord, what is the reward of he who loved Your faithful servants? He
 answered: O Moses, I shall forbid My hell for him, Moses then asked: O
 my Lord, what is the reward of he who kills a believer and he means it?
 He answered: I shall not look at him and never help him, Moses then asked:
 O my Lord, what is the reward of he who calls a disbeliever to be a believer?
 He answered: O Moses, I shall give him the permission to permit anyone
 he likes into forgiveness, Moses said: O my Lord, what is the reward of
 he who prayed a praying at its time? He answered: I shall give him what
 he asks for and My paradise is for him, Moses then asked: O my Lord, what
 is the reward of he who completed his washing (for praying) for his submission
 for You? He answered: I shall resurrect him at doomsday with a light between
 his eyes that glances, Moses then asked: O my Lord, what is the reward
 of he who fasted during Ramadhan for You? He answered: O Moses, I shall
 put him in a place at doomsday that he shall not fear in it, Moses then
 asked: O my Lord, what is the reward of he who fasted Ramadhan for the
 people? He answered: O Moses, his reward is as the reward of he who did
 not fast..etc, this is as copied from Al-Sayid Ni`matullah Al-Jazâ'iri,
 may mercy of God fall upon him.
