 <center><font size="+3">And Some Historians Said</font></center>
 It is famous from the speeches of those who deal with the story of A'ad
 that they are destroyed after the existance of Abraham (PUH) and the building
 of the Holy House in Holy Mecca, and said: it is poissble the A'ad were
 the longest living people on earth and also the greatest in bodies. And
 who said that A'ad is the son of `Ewas ben Iram then he got so far with
 that, because in such a short time it is not possible for Iram to generate
 such a huge tribe that works on earth and be proud of its strength as A'ad
 used to be, for they were people of agriculture and enslaved people as
 it is mentioned by Hud (PUH) in his saying to them as been told by the
 Holy Book: Do ye build a landmark on every high place to amuse yourselves?
 And do ye get for yourselves fine buildings in the hope of living therein
 (forever)? And when ye exert your strong hand, do ye do it like men of
 absolute power? Now fear Allah, and obey me. Yea, fear Him Who has bestowed
 on you freely all that ye know. Freely has He bestowed on you cattle and
 sons, And Gardens and Springs. (Al-Sho'arâ':128-134).
 <br>They also mentioned that the headquarter of A'ad and their homes were
 in the land of Ahqâf and it is located in the north of Hadramawt,
 and their place now is just a sandy location with no one living thing after
 that great construction, and Al-Ahqâf means the place of lot of sands
 as in the language. And as mentioned before they used to worship the idols
 instead of God, the Exalted, as the people of Noah (PUH) used to do. It
 is reported from Ibn Abbâs that they had an idol called "Samud" and
 another one called "Al-Hattâr", so then God sent to them Hud (PUH)
 and he was from a tribe called "Al-Khalood", and he was one of nobles with
 a nice-looking face, with a shape and body like them, white with a long
 beard, so he called them to worship God and believe in the One and stop
 worshipping the idols and doing wrong to people, but they refused to do
 so and called him a liar and said: Who's stronger than us? And Hud used
 to warn them and give examples for them with the first people of A'ad and
 people of Noah (PUH) before them and remind them of the gifts of God and
 explained to them that he has no greed for their money and fortunes but
 he is only commanded by God to guide them and God only rewards him.
 <br>As there were people of might and ego among the people the of Hud,
 there were also people of faith and mind and believed in him and followed
 him, but the people of wrong were much more in number so they refused Hud
 and ignored all the clues that he brought for the truth until God destroyed
 them and their body turned to be like empty palms' trunks. It is apparent
 that the people of Hud were the second A'ad and not the first as some believed
 that the second A'ad after the people of Hud are the people of Sâleh
 (PUH) and they are Thamud that lived in Yemen from Qahtân and Saba'
 (Sheba), and their conditions will come later on, and only God knows. Some
 said, and as reported by the people of Hadramut, that Hud (PUH) lived in
 Hadramut after the destruction of A'ad until he died there and buried on
 the eastern parts of it not far away from the town of Tareem near the valley
 of Berhut. So we say, and this is the right, that Hud (PUH) was buried
 in the valley of Salâm (valley of peace) near the shrine of the prince
 of believers Ali ben Abi-Tâlib (PUH), and near the graves of Adam
 and Noah (PUH), and beside him Sâleh (PUH) with a high dome above
 them and their shrines underneath it, and they have their own servants
 and people visit them in that wide part of Iraq.
 <br>You should know that Quran mentioned the story of A'ad with Hud (PUH)
 in ten Suras (chapters): Al-A`râf, Hud, Al-Mu'minun, Al-Sho`arâ',
 Fussilat, Al-Ahqâf, Al-Ðâriyât, Al-Qamar, Al-Hâqqah,
 Al-Fajr. And the mentioning of Hud (PUH) was included for seven times in
 them, and might be the mentioning of A'ad is for the first A'ad like in
 the chapter of Al-Fajr, because it is also mentioned with it the city if
 Iram, the many-columned. Because both of A'ad of Hud and the one before
 it were tyrants, but both of them are different as mentioned before, and
 for this purpose He said: Lo! A'ad disbelieved in their Lord. A far removal
 for A'ad, the folk of Hud!(Hud:60). This speech is from Him, the Exalted,
 is call for their destruction and in it you will find the reasons for their
 destruction and the repetition of their story is to show how awful is their
 matter, and also for meditating and take the wisdom from their story and
 avoid their deeds, and He said "folks of Hud" to make a destinction betweem
 them and between the owner of Iram, the many columned. In the Hadith: people
 must be filtered and be tested so their good be known among their bad ones.
 Look by the eye of your heart to the story of Hud (PUH) with his people
 you will see a respected man with wisdom and high manners with great feelings,
 worshipper and ascetic, and also with pride and dignity with a hard faith
 and believe in God, the Exalted, for the disbelievers he was the torture
 and for the believers he was a passionate father, this is Hud (PUH), and
 look to the great evil that was represented in A'ad and their saying to
 him: Who is mightier than us in power? Hard in their refusing and in their
 sayings, rude and proud, with no manners and filthy tongue, disbelieving
 in paradising, but Hud (PUH) never reacted for this evil with evil, but
 in the contrary, passion and kindness and sincerity never leave him in
 his callings for his people. Look to their saying to him: Lo! we surely
 see thee in foolishness, and lo! we deem thee of the liars(Al-A`râf:66),
 and look to his answer to them: He said: O my people! There is no foolishness
 in me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds. I convey unto
 you the messages of my Lord and am for you a true adviser(Al-A`râf:67-68).
 Meditate in this sincerity from a righteous prophet, mighty in the cause
 of God with dignity and pity for his people against the torment of the
 Almighty and His destruction, and he is scared for them against His anger
 for whoever rebel against His will and did not have mercy for himself by
 obeying his Lord, so he speaks to them with the language of passion and
 kindness and high manners, and they face him with that savagery, and he
 reminds them of the gifts of God for them like the fortunes, the sons,
 the gardens and watersprings, and reminds them that they are ignorant to
 His gifts to them, and He made them special by giving them the huge bodies
 and the might with dignity of the tribe and made them viceroys on earth
 after the people of Noah, and reminds them that believing in God will bring
 to them even more fortunes and happiness in this life and in after-life,
 and their answer to him was that to humilate him and being surprised and
 wondering about his message and calls where he called for them to worship
 one God alone away from their gods and whatever their fathers used to worship
 before them, and even called him a crazy and claimed that some of their
 gods revealed mental illness on him as a punishment for his arguments about
 their rights and for trying to stop worshipping them, look to this lying
 about his honorable place, and they claimed that some of their gods and
 not all of them caused him to be with mental illness, but his answer to
 them was: I call Allah to witness, and do ye (too) bear witness, that I
 am innocent of (all) that ye ascribe as partners (to Allah), Beside Him.
 So (try to) circumvent me, all of you, give me no respite, Lo! I have put
 my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Not an animal but He doth grasp
 it by the forelock! Lo! my Lord is on a straight path(Hud:54-56).
 <br>And let it be known that whatever Hud (PUH) did is a matter that is
 should done by everyone that assigned to the mission of ordering by goodness
 and prohibiting the bad deeds and guiding people and teaching them the
 laws and regulations of the religion and it is matter for every religious
 scholar, and we've mentioned before that mentioning such matters is for
 guiding and to take the wisdom out of them, and everyone is a slave for
 God and His own creation and let the guiders and wisemen take Hud (PUH)
 as an example, for he said to his people: And if ye turn away, still I
 have conveyed unto you that wherewith I was sent unto you, and my Lord
 will set in place of you a folk other than you. Ye cannot injure Him at
 all. Lo! my Lord is Guardian over all things(Hud:57).
 <br>And thanks to God the Lord of all and prayers be upon His prophet the
 chosen, and his descendants the purified and upon the rest of prophets
 and messengers until the time of the doomsday.
