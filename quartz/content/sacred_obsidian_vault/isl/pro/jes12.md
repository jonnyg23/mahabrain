 <center><font size="+3">Bukht Nassar (Nebuchadnezzar)</font></center>
 As it is apparent, the situation with Nebuchadnezzar was like that of Nimrod
 at the time of Abraham (PUH), and he was a tyrant man and his capital and
 the center of his kingdom was in Babel (Babylon) in the lands of Iraq near
 by Al-Hillah, and he was a magus and a bastard (natural son) and had no
 father, all of that was mentioned. Then he invaded the holy lands and conquered
 Jerusalem and destroyed it and burned the Torah and threw the dead bodies
 in the Temple and he killed for the blood of John ben Zacharias (PUH) seventy
 thousand and he captivated the others and took their fortunes and brought
 them to Babylon and they remained in Babylon for one hundred years as slaves
 for the magii. Then God had mercy upon them and so a king of the kings
 of Persia who knew God ordered to get them back to their lands, and they
 remained for one hundred years doing the goodness and remained on the straight
 path, but then they got back to the ill manners and the sins, so then a
 king (caesar) of the romans that was called Antiâkhius [probably
 Titus] so he destroyed Jerusalem again and captivated the people and they
 have a long story that shouldn't be mentioned here because the speech is
 about Nebuchadnezzar. They say he was called like that because he was found
 laying down at an idol called Bukht that belonged to a king called Nassar
 (Nezzar), and that was when he was born and no father nor a mother for
 him were known, and some say that he was called by this name because he
 was breastfeeeded from a she-dog that was called Bukht and it belonged
 to a man called Nassar, and he wasn't circumcised and he invaded Jerusalem
 with six hundred thousand legions.
 <br>It is testifed about this matter by God's saying: And We decreed for
 the Children of Israel in the Scripture: Ye verily will work corruption
 in the earth twice, and ye will become great tyrants. So when the time
 for the first of the two came, We roused against you slaves of Ours of
 great might who ravaged (your) country, and it was a threat performed.
 Then we gave you once again your turn against them, and We aided you with
 wealth and children and made you more in soldiery. (Saying): If ye do good,
 ye do good for your own souls, and if ye do evil, it is for them (in like
 manner). So, when the time for the second (of the judgments) came (We roused
 against you others of Our slaves) to ravage you, and to enter the Temple
 even as they entered it the first time, and to lay waste all that they
 conquered with an utter wasting(Al-Isrâ':4-7), and the meaning of
 that and only God knows, that We inspired (mentioned) for the Israelites
 in Torah and told them about what shall they do of sins and tyranny and
 they will commit many crimes that they should be punished in this life
 before the after-life and most important of what they shall commit are
 two things: the first is to do against what is mentioned in Torah of laws
 and regulations and to rebel against God, and then kill Isaiah and Jeremiah
 with no right but because they are prophets calling back to worship God
 and order with the goodness and prohibit the ill-manners, and the second
 one is that they shall kill Zacharias and John and the desire to kill Jesus
 the son of Mary (PUT). About God's saying "So when the time for the first
 of the two came, We roused against you slaves of Ours of great might who
 ravaged (your) country, and it was a threat performed" meaning the promise
 of punishment in this life before the after-life, at that time We shall
 send over you servants for us, meaning Nebuchadnezzar and his soldiers,
 that shall come and ask for you and look for you and look for your shameful
 history and your crimes and punish you severely, because the wrong disbeliever
 is God's sword that God uses to revenge and to punish the rebellious, and
 then God shall take revenge of him in the after-life. So he shall be sent
 over you to kill you and to captivate you and take all of your fortunes.
 Then God shall have mercy upon you and let you back to your lands and homes
 and you shall be in safety for some time as long you are on the straight
 path, and when your souls turn ill as before and rebelled, God shall send
 to you the sword of revenge of what He prepared for such purpose as He
 took revenge of you in the first time, and then by a mercy from Him he
 got you back home again.
 <br>For God's saying "So, when the time for the second (of the judgments)
 came (We roused against you others of Our slaves) to ravage you," it means
 that We sent them to let your faces shown up because the traces of the
 revenge and the sins are obvious in them, and to lay waste all what they
 conquered by their force and their invasion for you and so they shall be
 controlling you again, and for this came the invasion of the king (caesar)
 of the romans or the king of Persia, both are mentioned. So God humiliated
 them by scattering them around and killing them and by destruction and
 they entered the Temple as they did in the first time and they killed their
 children and humiliated their nobles and their elders and took their fortunes.
 It is narrated by the prophet (PUH) that Nebuchadnezzar ruled for one hundred
 and eighty seven years, and killed seventy thousand warriors of jews for
 the blood of John ben Zacharias and destroyed the Temple and the jews were
 scattered all over the lands. As attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH) that
 he said: the earth was ruled by four, two believers and two disbelievers,
 as for the believers they were Solomon ben David (PUH) and Ðul-Qarnain,
 and as for the two disbelievers, they were Nimrod and Nebuchadnezzar.
