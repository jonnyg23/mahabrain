 <center><font size="+3">The Death Zacharias and John</font></center>
 They say that when Mary the daughter of Amram got pregnant with Jesus (PUT)
 and her pregnancy showed up, they accused Zacharias and the Satan made
 them imagine and induced them to believe so and made them think truely
 that the one who made her pregnant was Zacharias because no one can enter
 her place except of him because he is her guardian. This matter was carried
 in their hearts and they never saw a woman that gets pregnant without a
 man, so the silly folks of the jews chased him until he left Jerusalem.
 When he went out, the evil got even greater and the charge got bigger in
 the hearts of the bad people and they talked about the sin of Zacharias,
 so their silly folks chased him, and he went to a valley and they followed
 him, and when he was in the middle of it he saw a tree so he went to it
 and it opened up for him and he went inside it and then it closed upon
 him, and then the Satan came chasing him with the others until he reached
 the tree and he said to them: he is inside it here, and he put his hand
 on the position of his (Zacharias's) heart, so he ordered them to saw it
 and so they did and he was sawn with the tree from the middle, and then
 they left him apart. Then God sent the angels to wash him up and pray upon
 him for three days before being buried, and then the good people of the
 Israelites took him and buried him, and the details about that shall come
 later by God's will. Then it became so great in the heart of John for losing
 his father by their deeds and for the charge that he was innocent of and
 such a charge was something so far away from him, and his death was one
 of the greatest test from God to John. Then he took care of the matters
 after his father and started to speech among the Israelites and he told
 them that the troubles of the good people founded because of the sins of
 the Israelites and he promised them with the relief by the coming of the
 Messiah (PUH) after some twenty years after his speech with them.
 <br>It is narrated that at the time of John ben Zacharias, there was a
 tyrant immoral king, and there was a woman of wisdom but immoral as well
 that used to come to him a lot until she got older and then she prepared
 her daughter for the king and she said to her: I want to give you to the
 king, and when he gets what he wants of you and then asks you about your
 needs, tell him that my need is to kill John ben Zacharias, and so she
 did and told him to kill John ben Zacharias, and so he sent messengers
 to John (PUH) and they brought him and then he ordered to bring a tub made
 of gold and he slained him in it, and it got full with blood and then they
 poured it on the ground and it started to boil, and the people came and
 buried it with sands but it gets even higher than the sand and so on until
 all the sand turned into a great hill, and a hundred years passed and it
 kept boiling over the sand, and when it was the time of Nebuchadnezzar
 and he saw the blood, he wondered and asked about it but no one answered
 him until an old man came and he asked him about it and the man answered:
 my father told me by the way of my grandfather that this is the blood of
 John ben Zacharias and his story with the king was so and so..etc, and
 then Nebuchadnezzar said: no crime then, I shall kill upon it until it
 calms down, and he killed for it seventy thousand, until the blood calmed
 down. As attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH): if God wanted to make a victory
 for His viceroys and faithful people, He shall do it by the most devilish
 people of His creatures, and if He wanted to make a victory for Himself,
 He shall do it by using His viceroys, and He made a victory for John ben
 Zacharias by Nebuchadnezzar, and the victory made for Himself is like His
 victory by Solomon ben David (PUH) and by Ðul-Qarnain (PUH) and by
 the prince of believers (PUH) with the prophet (PUH) and after him (the
 prophet), and like His victory that shall be made by the awaited Al-Mahdi
 ben Al-Hasan (PUH) may our souls be a ransom for him, and may peace be
 upon him and upon his fathers the purified (PUT).
 <br>It is narrated by the way of Al-Bâqir (PUH): the killer of the
 she-camel of Sâleh was a blue man and a son of adultery, and the
 killer of John ben Zacharias was a son of adultery, and the killer of the
 prince of believers, `Ali (PUH) was a son of adultery, and the tribe of
 Murâd [the tribe that the killer of the prince of believers came
 from] said that they knew no father for him, and the killer of Al-Husain
 ben `Ali (PUH) was a son of adultery, and the prophets and the son of the
 prophets were always killed by the sons of adultery..etc. They said about
 the reasons of killing John ben Zacharias many tales but the most probable
 is what we've mentioned before for this is what we found in our resources,
 and about giving his head to a prostitute of the Israelites as it was mentioned
 in the narrations told by the Household (PUT) does not oppose what we've
 mentioned before about the core of the matter and the details are only
 known by God and from Him comes the guidance. As narrated also by Al-Bâqir
 (PUH) about God's saying "we have given the same name to none before (him)"
 he (PUH) said: he is John ben Zacharias (PUH) and no one before him had
 the same name, and Al-Husain also no one before him had the same name,
 and he (PUH) said: and the sky cried for them for forty mornings and so
 did the sun and its cry was to rise in red and set in red, and they say
 about the crying of the sky it is in fact the cry of the angels, and the
 tidings about the cry of heavens and earth and the sun and moon are many
 and this is not the place to mention them.
 <br>It is mentioned by `Ali ben Al--Husain (Al-Sajjâd) (PUH) that
 he said: we went out with my father Al-Husain ben `Ali (PUH) and whenever
 he settled down or moved he mentioned John ben Zacharias (PUH), and one
 day he said: it is for the easiness of life for God that the head of John
 was given to a prostitute of the Israelites. And it is copied from the
 awaited viceroy, Al-Mahdi (PUH) may our souls be a ransom for him, when
 he was asked about the interpretation of: Kaf Ha Ya A'in Sad(Mariam:1),
 he answered: these letters are of the knowledgement of the unknown that
 God showed to his slave Zacharias and then He told them to His beloved
 Muhammad (PUH), and it was that when Zacharias mentioned Muhammad, `Ali,
 Fâtimah and Al-Hasan (PUT), his troubles would seem to fade away,
 and whenever he mentioned Al-Husain (PUH) he would desire to cry and his
 chest seems to get narrower and his heart is shrinked, and one day he said:
 O Lord, what is happening to me whenever I mention four names of them I
 get enjoyment and whenever I mention Al-Husain (PUH) my eyes would be filled
 with tears? So God then told him the story and said: Kaf Ha Ya A'in Sad,
 so Kaf is Karbala, Ha is Halâk [Arabic: Halâk=Death] of the
 Household, Ya is Yazeed the one who wronged Al-Husain (PUH), and A`in is
 his (Al-Husain) thirst [Arabic: `Atash=Thirst], and Sad is his patience
 [Arabic: Sabr=Patience], and when Zacharias heard that he remained in his
 temple for three days and didn't allow anyone to get inside and started
 to mourn and cry, and he lamented for Al-Husain by saying: O Lord, do You
 make the best of the creation suffer the loss of his son? O Lord shall
 You make `Ali and Fâtimah suffer with such an adversity? Then he
 said: God give me a son as a gift for me and make me love him so much when
 I become so old and then make me suffer his loss like You would make your
 beloved Muhammad suffer the loss of his son, so then God gave to him John
 and made him suffer his loss, and the pregnancy time for John was six months,
 and so it was for Al-Husain (PUH), and this is something about their conditions
 (PUT) and the situation doesn't help to give more than that, and my success
 is all by God and upon Him I shall depend.
