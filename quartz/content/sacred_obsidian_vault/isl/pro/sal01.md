 <center><font size="+3">Properities of The She-Camel</font></center>
 This she-camel has special properities which make her destinctive from
 other she-camels, such as the large size of her body and its attractive
 color that is mainly brown with yellow and her dense hair, and her ability
 to drink the water of all the people so that nothing of it is left at the
 day of her drink, and also giving milk so much that it was enough for the
 people at that day, the youngs and adults, to drink, and also whatever
 was on earth of plants was a pasture for her and no one has the right to
 prohibit her from that, and she didn't use to hurt or do damage towards
 anyone either in self or his plants or his trees, and she did not need
 a guard, and the rest of the animals used to get afraid of her and get
 off her way.
 <br>What is understood from the Holy Phrases about the she-camel is that
 no one of Þamud should do harm to her or to her food or her drink
 that was appointed for her at her appointed day, and she also don't approach
 the water at the day of their drinking, so her meanings and her characterestics
 are not obvious except for the One who created her. For this they were
 warned and the threat was directed to them whenever they wanted to harm
 her, and the punishment will befall on them for the slightest harm they
 might do or for killing her, and Sâlih (PUH) did his best with his
 people to advice them for he had the pity on them with sincerity, and carried
 so much of their cause and had patient with them to the fullest, and he
 was lonely with sorrow for them for they were his people and his tribe
 and his beloved if only they obeyed God, but what a sorrow (You would be
 heard if you were calling a living, but there is no such life when the
 one you're calling).
 <br>He used to remind them of the gifts of God to them and try to prohibit
 them to do mischiefs on earth and worship other gods instead of the true
 God, and also prohibited them to be tyrants on earth with pride, and for
 the main heads and tyrants in his people had the pride upon him and they
 didn't accept to be governed by the commandments and prohibitions of Sâlih
 like the other people and become under his rule after their pride and their
 rule, and for them such matter is something not to be discussed and not
 to be taken as it is for their pride keeps them from being under the rule
 of a man that had no money nor power, and they never look at what they
 were worshipping of idols that have no benefits nor harm, no feelings and
 don't talk to them or guide them, and they would know that the Creator
 is some One else only if they did meditate and understand.
 <br>Sâlih (PUH) is His messenger to them and his prophecy was proved
 by the miracles that none of the creatures would make, and the mischiefers
 that had the rule among the people of Sâlih went to the believers
 that followed him and asked them as if they were mocking: do you know that
 Sâlih was sent from his God? And their answer to them was: we are
 believers in whatever he was sent for. Then the tyrants said: we disbelieve
 in what you've believed in. We've pointed out before that the destruction
 of the people of Sâlih ,for their killing of the she-camel and refusing
 the commandments of God and His prophet, was done by the Cry as was mentioned
 in the Holy Quran in God's saying: And the (awful) Cry overtook those who
 did wrong, so that morning found them prostrate in their dwellings(Hud:67).
 Yes, and Quran also mentioned several ways of punishing them with the quake,
 the thunders, tyranny..etc as in the chapters of Al-A`râf, Al-Ðâriyât,
 Al-Hâqqah and Al-Sho`arâ' , and no doubt that all of the other
 ways of punishing were revealed all together, because the Cry which is
 the great noise, is done by the thunder and mostly accompanied with the
 quake and we shall believe that the conditions for the Cry are all satisfied
 in the Holy Phrases, and also the tyranny which is the expansion of the
 circle of destruction that was revealed upon them and upon what they used
 to worship and upon where they used to live, so tyranny overcame them and
 their homes as mentioned in His saying: Then see the nature of the consequence
 of their plotting, for lo! We destroyed them and their people, every one,
 See, yonder are their dwellings empty and in ruins because they did wrong.
 Lo! herein is indeed a portent for a people who have knowledge(Al-Naml:51-52).
 <br>With no doubt it is apparent that the people of Sâlih were in
 doubt about his prophecy and his message and his truthfulness about everything
 he claimed about the prophecy and the message of God to them before the
 foundation of the she-camel and her weanling, especially the main tyrants
 of them, and it is probable that some of them believed just by calling
 them back to God with showing them the clues for that as it is with the
 rest of the messengers and prophets for such people had wisdom and kind
 hearts and the good-will, and mostly they are the weak people on earth,
 and they said to the tyrants of the people of Sâlih: Lo! In that
 wherewith he hath been sent we are believers(Al-A`râf:75). Yes, and
 when he got with the great miracle of his which was the she-camel out of
 the rock as they requested, those who were on faith been even more faithful,
 and it is probable that all of them believed in him at that time if it
 wasn't for the devil's seducation and the soul that runs after mischiefs
 and the stubborness of the harsh disbelievers that grabbed with them those
 of weak faith and those who have no working mind or wisdom. And in a famous
 speech (Hadith) [this line probably taken from a famous Hadith for the
 prophet Muhammad PUH]: People are following their kings religions for their
 greedness for this life's wreckage and their fear of power. So from here
 and there, those of stubborness got back from being faithful without a
 clue or a prove, and been doubting and disbelieving, and said to him: Let
 whatever you were promising come over us if you were saying the truth.
 And as a witness for this we have God's saying: And as for Thamud, We gave
 them guidance, but they preferred blindness to the guidance(Fossilat:17).
 So, the she-camel is the miracle to prove the truthfulness of Sâlih
 and his message from God to them, and it is a test for them, for God did
 say: Lo! We are sending the she-camel as a test for them; so watch them
 and have patience(Al-Qamar:27), so by her, the prove was done and the forbidden
 happened along with the torture, and all is said and done, and God did
 say about this: We never punish until we have sent a messenger(Al-Isrâ':15).
