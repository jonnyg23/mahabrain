 <center><font size="+3">Mutation of Israelites</font></center>
 God did say: And ye know of those of you who broke the Sabbath, how We
 said unto them: Be ye apes, despised and hated! And We made it an example
 to their own and to succeeding generations, and an admonition to the Allah-fearing
 (Al-Baqarah:65-66), and also: Ask them (O Muhammad) of the township that
 was by the sea...etc(Al-A`râf: 163). In one narration they were three
 groups: one did the forbidden deeds, and one denied this, and one that
 did not deny and did not do the forbidden, so God saved those who denied
 this attitude, and made those who did not deny it as a dust, and mutated
 the group that used to do the foribdden deeds and made them as apes. The
 narrator of this narration, and he is `Ali ben Tâwoos: the mutation
 of the group that did not deny into dust or grains might be because that
 they made the greatness of God so small and made it such an easy thing
 to come over God's laws, so God made them small and turned them into grains.
 <br>As attributed to `Ali ben Al-Husain (PUH) about God's saying: And ye
 know of those of you who broke the Sabbath...etc, that they were living
 by the sea and God with the prophets forbade them to hunt fishes in Sabbath
 so they made a tricky way to allow what had been illegal for them, so they
 made ditches and made a way leading to a basin that whales can enter but
 cannot leave it, so the whales came on the Sabbath and feeling safe and
 then fell into the basin, and when it was night time and desired to leave
 they couldn't and remained there, so they can pick them from there without
 hunting and easily on the next day and so they say "we did not hunt on
 Sabbath" and they did so until their fortunes increased.
 <br>In brief, what they did and what they ended up with as been told in
 the narration of Al-Sajjâd (`Ali ben Al-Husain) (PUH) is that they
 were in a town of a population of nearly eighty thousand, and those who
 did the forbidden deeds counted as much as seventy thousand, and the rest
 are those who denied such deeds, and those who denied such deeds did leave
 the rest to another village, and God then mutated those who did the wrong
 deeds into apes, and after mutation the others did visit them to check
 their conditions after such rebel and bad deeds and they found them turned
 into apes, and the comers used to identify each ape of them and say for
 any of them: your are so and so, and the ape would shake his head for agreement
 with a tear in his eyes for his sorrow and regret for what he did and for
 what happened to him, and they remained like this for three days, and God
 then sent down on them the rains and storms that swept them to the sea
 and whoever remained was mutated again as well, this is as it is mentioned
 in the Tales of Prophets for Al-Jazâ'iri. Then said Al-Sajjâd
 (PUH): and those you see now with the same shape are similar creatures
 but they are not the same as those before and they are not from their descendants,
 and then he (PUH) said: God mutated those for hunting fishes in ways God
 did not allow so how is it then with those who killed the children of the
 prophet of God and broke their veils? even though God did not mutate them
 in this life but He prepared for them what is counted as multiplies of
 the torture of mutation, and then he (PUH) said: those who broke the Sabbath
 if only they asked God by the rights of Muhammad and his Household (PUT)
 to prevent them from doing such bad deeds, He would answer them, but God
 did not inspire them to do so for their rebellious nature and so He did
 not guide them to the way of their happiness.
 <br>In a narration told about the interpretation of God's saying: Those
 of the Children of Israel who went astray were cursed by the tongue of
 David, and of Jesus, son of Mary..etc(Al-Mâ'idah:78), and the most
 famous thing is that apes are mentioned by the tongue of David and the
 pigs by the tongue of Jesus, and Al-Baydhâwi [seems a scholar name]
 said: it is mentioned that when the people of Obbalah - and it is a village
 - when they broke the Sabbath, God damned them by the tongue of David and
 were mutated to apes and pigs, and the people of the table when they disbelieved
 in Jesus he prayed against them and damned them and they were mutated into
 pigs and they were counted as much as five thousand men. Al-Sayid Al-Jazâ'iri
 said: Obbalah is a location near by Basra, and in God's saying: Ask them
 (O Muhammad) of the township that was by the sea(Al-A`râf:163), and
 as mentioned in the interpretation of `Ali ben Ibrâhim: it was a
 township that belonged to the Israelites and was by the sea, and in low
 and high tides the sea used to go into their rivers and farms and the fishes
 used to out of the sea and reach the end of their farms, and God prohibited
 them to hunt on Sabbath so they get to prepare the nets on the night before
 Sabbath and hunt on sunday while the fishes used to go out on Sabbath and
 sunday, so their scholars prohibited them to do so but they didn't stop
 so they were mutated into apes and pigs, and the reason for prohibitition
 of hunting on Sabbath was that that all believers and faithful ones and
 others had their holiday on friday but the jews denied that and made it
 on Sabbath (saturday) and said: our holiday is on Sabbath so God prohibited
 hunting for them on Sabbath, and we've pointed out that they were divided
 into three main groups, one group was advising against the wrong doing,
 and another group did not advise nor do the bad deeds and they said to
 the ones advising: Why preach ye to a folk whom Allah is about to destroy
 or punish with an awful doom(Al-A`râf:164) and the answer was: In
 order to be free from guilt before your Lord, and that haply they may ward
 off (evil)(Al-A`râf:164), and then the first group said: by God we
 shall not sit with you and do not live with you in this town that you made
 sins in starting from this night for we fear that adversities would be
 revealed upon you and us, so it is mentioned that they left the town and
 settled down near by and slept under the sky, and when it was the morning
 time they went to check the sinners so they reached the gate of the town
 and it was closed, and they knocked on it but none did answer and they
 did not hear any sounds or movements, but they heard sounds like moaning
 that doesn't sound like human voices, so then they put a ladder on the
 town's wall and made a man to climb over, so when he went on top and looked
 on it he found out that most of the people turned into apes, so they broke
 the door and got inside and they said to them: hadn't we forbid you!. Whoever
 wants to check the story can check the long stories mentioned about them
 in this matter, and God is the Bringer of success.
