 <center><font size="+3">Alexander and Al-Khidhr Were Born in The Same Day</font></center>
 They say that his father was the greatest astrologist on earth and none
 saw the stars as much as he did and God gave him a long age, so one night
 he said to his wife: I've been killed by staying awake so let me sleep
 for some time and you look into the sky and if you saw that a star rising
 for that place, and he pointed his finger to that place, so awake me then
 to have love with you and bear a child that will live until the end of
 time, and her sister was listening at the same time as well to his talk,
 and then the father of Alexander slept and his wife's sister started to
 watch the sky waiting for the star and when the star showed up she told
 her husband the story and he made love with her and she bore Al-Khidhr,
 the maternal cousin Alexander, and when the father of Alexander woke up
 and saw that the star was in a constellation that is different from the
 one he was watching he said to his wife: why didn't you awake me? She answered:
 by God, I was shy, then he said to her: didn't you know that I am watching
 this for forty years, you've made me miss my life for nothing, but there
 will be a star rising after him in a while so when I make love to you,
 you will bear a child that will own the horns of the sun, and after a while
 the star showed up and he made love to her and she bore Alexander, so Alexander
 and his maternal cousin Al-Khidhr were born in one night.
 <br>We say: it is mentioned before that the reason for Al-Khidhr to be
 staying alive until the end of time is for his drinking from the spring
 of life, and Al-Khidhr was at the time of Moses (PUH) with no doubt for
 the interpretations of the holy phrases suggest so, and Al-Khidhr was at
 the front of the army of Alexander, so the claims about Alexander being
 in the time after Jesus the son of Mary (PUH) give a contradiction and
 so we reject the idea that he appeared after the time of Jesus, and so
 Alexander is Ðul-Qarnain and he existed before Moses and at the time
 of Moses, and so we don't reject the idea that he and Al-Khidhr were born
 in one night and they both are cousins, but we shall say: making love to
 one's wife when a star shows up is not a reason for the pregnancy to take
 a place or the child would be a male, and all of this case is believed
 to be possible only by God's will and by His inspiration to some prophet
 or messanger and the coincedence is not impossible anyway, and this case
 is left up covered to the people that care about it the most like many
 of the others, and only God knows.
 <br>It is mentioned that God did not send prophets as kings except for
 four after Noah (PUH) and the first of them was Ðul-Qarnain and his
 name was `Ayyâsh, with David, Solomon and Joseph, and for `Ayyâsh,
 he ruled between the east and west, and for David, he ruled the lands of
 Shem to the lands of Istakhr (Issachar) (meaning Isfahan or Khurâsân)
 and so was the kingdom of Solomon (PUH), and for Joseph, he ruled Egypt
 and its deserts and did not expand, and in some tales they say that God
 raised Ðul-Qarnain up to the sky of earth and made him see all of the
 earth and its mountains, plains and valleys and so he saw whatever there
 was from east to west, and God provided him with reasons so he knew right
 from wrong and provided him with pieces of the sky over his horns (sides
 of the head) that had lightning and darkness and then got him down to earth
 and sent him from east to west, then God said to him: I've made the lands
 ruled by you and made the creations humiliated before you, so go on for
 what I commanded you, and then he went along to the west and whenever he
 passes over a village he would roar in it like an angry lion and send from
 his horns darkness with lightning and storms that destroys everyone that
 opposes him, and when he reached the setting-place of the sun he ruled
 all over the east and west..etc and it is mentioned before and it is repeated
 for some additions.
 <br>The benefit that is to be taken from this tale and the one before is
 that he was a prophet and a messanger and for this everything mentioned
 before must be interpreted differently for there are lot of tales that
 gives the opposite meaning, and another benefit is taken from the tales
 which is that Ðul-Qarnain was before the time of Abraham and after
 Noah, and this explanation calms the heart for many reasons, one of which
 is his meeting with Abraham at the time of pilgrimage as mentioned before,
 and there were a big gap between the time of Noah and Abraham, and the
 history after the time of Abraham is almost checked to the time of Jesus,
 and since then it was checked until our time, and if he was after the time
 of Abraham then who wouldn't be so mysterious like that, and about being
 born after the time of Jesus is something that cannot be believed in, so
 it must be interpreted accordingly if that was possible or leaving this
 matter alone or to the people that care about it the most, and the probability
 of expanding his kingdom or his resurrection or staying alive before the
 time of Abraham until the time after Jesus is something that opposes the
 idea of ruling the world with its faithful men and disbelievers for the
 kingdom of those took place before the time of Jesus and after Noah, and
 so the kingdom of Ðul-Qarnain took place after Noah until the time
 of Abraham, and about him being Alexander and he is the founder of Alexandria,
 this is something possible but in the time appointed before, and only God
 knows.
 <br>They mentioned lot of things more than what was mentioned before about
 the conditions of Ðul-Qarnain but there is no much benefits to be taken
 from them, but we point some of them, that when Ðul-Qarnain wandered
 in the darkness, Al-Khidhr was in front of his (Al-Khidhr's) army that
 counted as two thousand men, and Ðul-Qarnain had four thousand, and
 the total is six thousand of those who walked with him through the darkness,
 and the rest of his armies camped at the edge of the darkness waiting for
 him to get back after accomplishing what he wants, and when Al-Khidhr wanders
 with his army, Ðul-Qarnain would camp and vice versa, and while Al-Khidhr
 was wandering he fell in a valley and kept on marching through, and in
 his marching he found the spring of life and drank from it, with some details
 they mentioned, but Ðul-Qarnain did not find it, and Ðul-Qarnain
 gave him (Al-Khidhr) a red bead that lights up at night like a torch, so
 whenever is lost of those who were with him he would throw it on the ground
 and it screams so that the lost man would be able to get back to the group,
 and then they passed through the darkness in forty days, then they reached
 the light that was not like the light of the sun nor the moon, and then
 Ðul-Qarnain kept on marching through the light to the end until he
 reached a land with red sand and pearls as stones with a great palace that
 has a length of a league almost, and along its length there was a robe
 of iron with a bird hanging from it like a swallow, so then that black
 swallow talked and asked Ðul-Qarnain about a type of life's ornaments
 and Ðul-Qarnain answered with yes, so then the bird got larger and
 covered one third of the robe, and then it asked him about another type
 of the life's ornaments and he answered with yes, and the bird got larger
 to two thirds, and then he asked him for the third time, and so the bird
 got larger and filled the gap between the walls of the palace, and his
 questions were about building with gypsum and bricks, and about the abundance
 of entertainments, and about the false testimony, and in every time Ðul-Qarnain
 answered and the bird gets larger, Ðul-Qarnain gets so scared, and
 then he asked him about another three matters, and everytime Ðul-Qarnain
 answers, the bird gets smaller by one third until he got back to his original
 shape, and he had asked him: did people forget about saying "No other god
 save but God (Allah)"? Did people leave praying? Did people forget about
 the wash after pollution (semen), and in everytime the answer was "no"
 and for every answer the bird got smaller and smaller, and during all of
 that Ðul-Qarnain was so scared but he had patience and waited to see
 the result at the end, then the bird ordered him to climb the stairs to
 the roof and so he did with fear and then he reached a roof the expands
 with the eye sight and found a young man with a white face and wearing
 white clothes while he was looking to the sky and like waiting for a command
 and putting his finger on his mouth, so when he felt the arrival of Ðul-Qarnain
 and saw him he said to him: who is this? He answered: I am Ðul-Qarnain,
 then he said: the world before you was not enough to make you come to me
 here? Then he contunued: I am the owner of the trumpet and waiting for
 the commandment of my Lord, then he threw a stone to him and said: take
 this and get back, if it was hungry you shall be hungry too, and if it
 got satisfied you will be satisfied too, then Ðul-Qarnain got back
 to his men and marched back through the darkness and got back in safe with
 Al-Khidhr, then he told them about the palace and the bird and the man
 over the roof and the stone and what the man on the roof said to him and
 Ðul-Qarnain did not think about he meaning of what that man said, but
 Al-Khidhr (PUH) knew the purpose of all of that and told him (Ðul-Qarnain)
 about it, and the truth was what Al-Khidhr knew, and he took the stone
 and balanced it with another one, but the stone was heavier, and they added
 more stones against it until they reached one thousand stones against that
 one only, but the stone was always heavier and they did not know any reason
 for this and why the stone was given to him (Ðul-Qarnain), but Al-Khidhr
 knew the reason and so he balanced the stone against another one like it
 with some grains of sand, and the balance became equal and he knew the
 wisdom of this and the secret, and the interpretation of Al-Khidhr (PUH)
 for this stone is something so great, which made tears of Ðul-Qarnain
 fall down and made him see the kingdom and life so cheap.
 <br>In brief about its meaning, that the child of Adam is ambitious that
 never satisfied with anything he can reach except for the sand, meaning
 the grave, or either God guides him, and the best that one can do is to
 lose faith in life and advance towards the after-life with meditation,
 and for this when they were in their way back through the darkness they
 heard some noise under the hooves of their horses and they told him (Ðul-Qarnain)
 about that so he said: take some of it, the one who will take will regret
 and the one who will not take will regret as well, and so some took of
 what was there and some did not, and when they went out of the darkness
 they found that it was green emerald, and so the ones who took and did
 not take both did regret (?), and it is attributed to the prophet (PUH)
 that he said: God have mercy upon my brother Ðul-Qarnain, if he did
 find emerald in his way he would extract it and never leave it for his
 desire for life, but when he got back he left it all for he saw life so
 cheap.
 <br>They say also that once he saw an old faithful man so he invited him
 to be with him and said to him: come with me to console myself with you
 and get help from you for some of my matters, so he answered: yes I would
 if you guaranteed for me four things: riches never end, a health with no
 sickness, and a youth without oldness, and a life with no death, so then
 Ðul-Qarnain said: what creature is able to do all of that? The old
 man said then: then I am with the One who can do all of that and owns them
 as well as He owns you. Then he passed over a scholar that said to him:
 tell me about two things that since God created them still exist, and about
 two running things, and about two different things, and about two things
 that hate each other, so Ðul-Qarnain said to him: the two existing
 things are heaven and earth, and the two running things are the sun and
 moon, and the two different things are day and night, and the two things
 that hate each other are life and death, so then the scholar said: you
 are a scholar now, so go on. Then he passed over an old man that flips
 the skulls between his hands and said to Ðul-Qarnain: I want to distinguish
 between the rich and the poor but I couldn't, then said Ðul-Qarnain:
 you meant me by this and no one else. While he was wandering again he met
 the Wise Nation of Moses' people that order with justice, and when he saw
 them he said to them: O folks, tell me about your tidings for I wandered
 all over the earth and knew the peoples from east to west and knew its
 lands and seas but I did not find someone like you, so why do you keep
 the graves of your dead people in front of the doors of your houses? They
 answered: to remember the death and never let it out of our hearts, he
 said: why your houses have no doors? They answered: we have no thieves,
 no one of doubts and no one is to be charged (accused) and we have only
 the faithful, he said then: why you have no rulers? They answered: we don't
 wrong each other, he said then: why you don't have judges? They answered:
 we never fight with each other, he said then: why you have no kings? They
 answered: we don't reproduce, he said then: why don't you show pride? They
 answered: for we have passion for each other, he said then: why don't you
 fight with each other? They answered: for our hearts are tied together.
 <br>You've passed over before about the matter of the origin and ancestry
 of Ðul-Qarnain and we explained it at the beginning, and there is one
 more thing, that they said he is Eskandar ben Faylaqus (Alexander the son
 of Philip, or Failakus) the greek, and they take a clue for this from quran
 which mentioned that the man named Ðul-Qarnain owned the east and west,
 and it is mentioned, with fame, in history books that the one who owned
 that much is no one but Alexander, and when his father died he raised upon
 the throne and defeated the Roman kings [maybe the author means here the
 Greek kings as well] and he gathered them after being several tribes, and
 then he defeated the kings of the west until he reached the green sea,
 then he got back to Egypt and built Alexandria after his name, then he
 went to the lands of Shem and defeated the children of Israel and kept
 going on to Iraq and defeated the people there, and then went to Dârâ
 ben Dârâ the persian king [I think Dârâ is meant
 to be the name of Darius] and defeated him many times [this describtion
 coincide with Darius III] until he killed him and got his throne and persian
 were all under his command, and then he went along to India and China and
 invaded the far nations and then he got back to Khurâsân and
 built many cities there, and went after that to Iraq. Since quran mentioned
 that Ðul-Qarnain owned the earth, and since in history it is proved
 that the one that could do all of that is only Alexander the son of Philip
 (Alexander the Great) the greek (Macedonian), then both things coincide
 and match and the time period does not change the reality, and no one could
 have such describtions except of Solomon ben David (PUT) and this is mentioned
 before.
 <br>They mentioned also other tales that have no use to mention here and
 waste the precious time with them, and yes, it is attributed from the prophet
 (PUH) and his Household (PUT) that they said that he was a faithful man
 that God made him rule the earth and gave him the wisdom and made people
 be afraid of him, so we shall believe in him and mention his name with
 every good thing although we do not know who he is and it is enough for
 us the quran mentioned him, and God takes care of His faithful servants,
 and may prays be upon Muhammad and his purified Household, and thanks be
 for God.
