 <center><font size="+3">Ishmael, Other Than The Son of Abraham (PUT)</font></center>
 It is mentioned that he is other than the son of Abraham, the friend of
 God (PUH) but it is possibly the son of Ezekiel the prophet was mentioned
 before, the one who resurrected the dead people by the permission of God
 and the owner of the bright miracles and the one whose prays are answered
 and hard working for God, and as attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH) that
 he said: Ishmael that God said about him in His holy book: And make mention
 in the Scripture of Ishmael. Lo! he was a keeper of his promise, and he
 was a messenger (of Allah), a prophet(Mariam:54), he was not Ishmael the
 son of Abraham but he was a prophet that God sent to his people and they
 took him and skinned his head and his face, so then an angel came to him
 and said: God the Almighty sent me to you so order me with whatever you
 want, so then he answered: this is to be done to me like it will be done
 with Al-Husain ben `Ali (PUT), and in other narrations he said "like it
 will be done to the prophets." As reported by Al-Kâfi from Al-Sâdiq
 (PUH) he said: he was called "keeper of his promise" because he promised
 a man in a place so he waited for him there for one year, and so God called
 him "keeper of his promise" and then the man came to him after that and
 Ishmael said to him: I am still waiting for you.
 <br>As attributed to Al-Ridhâ (PUH) he said what has the meaning
 in general: he had promised someone with a certain promise and waited for
 him for one year and he is Ishmael ben Ezekiel, and God praised him again
 by saying: He enjoined upon his people worship and almsgiving, and was
 acceptable in the sight of his Lord(Mariam:55). In a narration attributed
 to Zayd Al-`Ajli from Al-Sâdiq (PUH) and it is a long one about someone
 that asked him (PUH) about Ishmael the keeper of his promise, he answered:
 he is Ishmael ben Ezekiel the prophet, the one that was sent to his people
 but they disbelieved in him and killed him and skinned his face, so then
 God had the wrath upon them and He sent down Satâtâ'eel, the
 angel of torture, and he said to him (Ishmael): O Ishmael, I am the angel
 of torture and directed by the Lord of Exaltness to you to torture your
 folks as you like, and then Ishmael said: no need for that O Satâtâ'eel,
 then God inspired to him: what do you need O Ishmael? Then Ishmael said:
 O Lord, You had the covenant for Yourself for being a God, and for Muhammad
 to be a prophet, and for his viceroys to be leaders and You told Your creatures
 about what will happen to Al-Husain ben `Ali after the prophet, and You
 promised Al-Husain that he will be back into life again to take revenge
 for what had been done to him, so my need to You O Lord is to let me back
 into life again to take revenge from those who did that to me as You would
 turn Al-Husain back into life again, and God then promised Ishmael ben
 Ezekiel to do that, and he will be back with Al-Husain ben `Ali (PUT).
