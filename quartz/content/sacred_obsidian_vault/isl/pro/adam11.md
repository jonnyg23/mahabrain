 (Having a tent for them in the place of the Holy House)</p>
 <font face="Times New Roman"><p>From Abi Jafar Al-Bâqir (PUH) from his fathers (PUT)</p></font>: God sent to Gabriel (PUH) that I had mercy upon Adam and Eve so get them a tent from the tents of paradise and make it stand in the place of the House and its base that was lifted before by the Angels, and so did Gabriel, and made a stand for it in the p<font face="Times New Roman">lace of the House then he got them down from Al-Safâ and Al-Marwah and gathered them together in the tent. The pillar of the tent was made of ruby and its light enlightened the mounts of Mecca, and the light reached the borders of Al-Haram, and it is the </font>p<font face="Times New Roman">osition of Al-Haram nowadays [meaning borders of Mecca maybe?], and so God made it sacred for the tent and the pillar that are from paradise. Then the tent was stretched and the end of the tent's ropes were the mosque and it is Al-Masjid Al-Harâm (the Hol</font>y "Sacred" Mosque). Then God revelaed seventy thousands angels to guard the tent against demons and cheer Adam and Eve, and so they were going around the tent and guard it. <br>
 It is probable that God after that sent to Gabriel (PUH) to get down to Adam and Eve and make them depart the place of the House and build it with stones and raise up its basis and complete it for the rest of the Angels and the creation of Adam's descendants. So he got down to them and made them out of the tent and moved them away from t<font face="Times New Roman">he House and the tent as well. Then Gabriel raised the basis of the House by a stone from Al-Safâ, and a stone from Al-Marwah, and a stone from the mount of Sinai, and a stone from the mount of Al-Salâm [Al-Salâm means The Peace] and it is at the hind of </font>the House at the back of Kaba, and made these stones the corners of the Holy House, and so he completed it by stones from the mount of Abi-Qubays as he was commanded by God, and made for it two doors, to the east and to the west. When he was done with its b<font face="Times New Roman">uilding, Angels started to go around it and when Adam and Eve saw that, they also started going around it seven by seven and it is the law that went on in his (Adam) descendants until the doomsday. <br>
 And in Ilal Al-Sharâye' (Reasons of Laws) from Bakeer be</font>n<font face="Times New Roman"> A'yon he said: Abu 'Abdullah Al-Sâdiq (PUH) said to me: do you know what it was the black stone in the Holy corner of Kaba? then he said: I said no, he said (PUH) then: it was one of the greatest Angels that God, the Exalted, did Have and when God took t</font>he covenant from the Angels, he was the first to admit it and so God made him the guardian for all of His creation and Gave him the covenant to keep and Decided to Make all the creations to renew their covenants with him each year, then God made him in company with Adam in paradise to remind him of the covenant and renew it each year, so when Adam did the sin and got out of paradise, God made him forget the covenant that He took over him and his descendants, for Muhammad and his viceroy and his descendants the protected against wrong doings, and Made him buffled and lost, but when He relented toward Adam He made this Angel in the picture of a white pearl and Sent it down from paradise to Adam when he was in the lands of India. When Adam saw this, he got pleased though he didn't know what it was except it is some treasure, then God made him speak and said: O Adam, did you know me? then Adam said: no! then he answered: O yes, the demon overcame you and made you forget to praise your Lord, then he changed to his true shape as it was in paradise with Adam (PUH) and said to Adam: where is the covenant? And when Adam remembered that jumped to him and cried and kissed him and renewed his covenant, then God changed him to a clear white pearl and Adam (PUH) carried him over his shoulders for his honour, and when he gets tired, Gabriel (PUH) would take it over, until they got to Mecca. It was there in Mecca that Adam kept it and renew his covenant every day and night and when God wanted to build the Kaba and sent Gabriel for this purpose and started in building, made this stone and it is the white pearl in the corner that it is in nowadays, and he (Gabriel) sactified God and praised Him, and that's why the law goes for praising and sanctifying everytime being in front of the corner that carries the Holy stone, and so it is until this very day. One of the religious duties to do when visiting the Holy House is to come to the Black Stone and kiss it if it was possible, or raise up the hand towards it and say: O Lord my fidelity I've done, and my covenant I've made to Testify me with the deed. [this is a line from a prayer said on pilgrimage time] This is the way of Muslims and all who came before them from the various religions and laws that admit the honour of the Holy House and the honoured Stone, and it is widely believed by these of the right wisdom and knowledge that an angel can be shaped in any shape even a stone, so it not a weird thing that it is indeed an angel in the shape of a stone [meaning the Black Stone], then how you Muslim raise your hand towards it, and though you speak to your Lord, but you are pointing toward the Holy stone, and it is not like any stone that appear to the public. <br>
 Some unbelievers make it as a fictitious tale to mock at it and mock at what the Muslims do and the people of the past time religions did, so we take refuse to God the Almighty from these who mock at what God had ordered to be honoured by His prophets and Ordered His creations to glorify and honour it."He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no guide"(Al-Ra'd: 33)
