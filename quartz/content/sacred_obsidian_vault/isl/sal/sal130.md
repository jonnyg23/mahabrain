 <p>His supplication for the sixth of the month</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O God! Praise be to You in a manner that might bring me closer to Your</p>  
 <p>pleasure and enable me to offer thanks to You thereby making myself</p>  
 <p>more deserving of Your bounties. Praise be to You for You grant mercy</p>  
 <p>despite having knowledge of our sins and praise be to You for Your</p>  
 <p>pardon despite having power to punish. O Allah! Praise be to You as</p>  
 <p>You have bestowed on us Your bounties after bounties. Praise be to</p>  
 <p>You for selecting Islam as religion for us and praise be to You for</p>

 <p>and offspring as well as granting us pardon. Praise be to You in times of</p>  
 <p>hardship and those of comfort, during affluence as well stringency and</p>  
 <p>under all conditions. O Allah! Praise be to You as You deserve; in the</p>  
 <p>manner that is befitting Your glorious Countenance. O my Lord! Praise</p>  
 <p>be to You as numerous as are the numbers of hair, of leaves and trees,</p>  
 <p>of pebbles and bricks, of the particles of the desert sand, of the days of</p>  
 <p>this world, of Hereafter and the stars of the Heaven. O my Allah! We</p>

 <p>needs. Praise be to Allah Who shows absolute mercy towards me as if I</p>
