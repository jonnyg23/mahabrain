 <p>which I and the other believers fear, whose troubles I am afraid of. Make</p>  
 <p>it easy for me. And save me from the calamities which may destroy me.</p>  
 <p>O most merciful of all the mercifuls. O the owner of greatness and glory.</p>  
 <p>There is no god but You, Glory be to You, verily I am of the unjust ones.</p>  
 <p>And peace be upon Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny (a.s.) the</p>  
 <p>pure and chaste.</p>
