 <p>His supplication for the twenty-sixth of the</p>  
 <p>month</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! Bless Muhammad and the Progeny of Muhammad. I beseech</p>  
 <p>You, O the Lord of the seven Heavens, seven Earths, the things in them</p>  
 <p>and in between them, the Lord of all seven quatrains (Surah-e-Hamd)</p>  
 <p>and the great Quran, the Lord of Jibraeel, Mikaeel, Israfil, Lord of all the</p>  
 <p>Angels, Lord of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) the last of the Prophets and the</p>  
 <p>Messengers and the Lord of the whole creation. O Allah! I beseech You</p>  
 <p>with Your name with which the Heavens remain well set in their places</p>  
 <p>and so do the Earth, with the blessing of that name, and through that</p>  
 <p>name You have kept in Your knowledge the measurement of the</p>  
 <p>oceans, and the weight of the mountains, and with it You cause death to</p>  
 <p>the living, and give life to the dead, and with that name You create the</p>  
 <p>clouds, and through it You send forth the wind, and through it provide</p>  
 <p>the bondsmen with sustenance, and reckoned through it the particles of</p>  
 <p>sand, and do what You wish and whereby You say to a thing "Be" and it</p>  
 <p>comes into existence, so remove my poverty with Your Needlessness,</p>  
 <p>and accept my invocation, and bestow on me my wants, and fulfill my</p>  
 <p>hopes, and favour me with happiness as a blessing for me out of Your</p>  
 <p>Mercy, and grant me peace in place of fears, and keep me alive with</p>  
 <p>perfect bounties, comfort, the best of sustenance, affluence and a happy</p>  
 <p>life. And enable me to offer thanks to You for what You have bestowed</p>  
 <p>upon me, and continue this without any break throughout my life till You</p>  
 <p>change it with the bounties of the Hereafter. O Allah! Lies within Your</p>  
 <p>control the destiny of the World, Hereafter, the day and night, the life</p>  
 <p>and death and so also the success, failure, virtue and vice are controlled</p>  
 <p>by You. O Allah! Bless me in Faith on which depends my affair and</p>  
 <p>bless me in this world the source of my livelihood, and bless me in my</p>  
 <p>Hereafter to which is my return and bless me in all my affairs. O Allah!</p>  
 <p>You are Allah, There is no god save You. Your promise is true and so is</p>  
 <p>our presence before You. I seek refuge with You from the evils of life</p>  
 <p>and death. I seek refuge with You from the abhorrent affairs of the world</p>  
 <p>and those of the Hereafter. And I seek refuge with You from the evils of</p>  
 <p>Dajjal. And I seek refuge with You against skepticism, vices, slackness</p>  
 <p>and defeat. And I seek refuge with You from miserliness and prodigality.</p>  
 <p>O Allah! It has passed what was to happen as a sequel to my past</p>  
 <p>deeds performed against my own self. O my Lord! You are my Lord, You</p>  
 <p>have control over me and I do not have. O my Lord! You created me</p>  
 <p>helpless and I am nothing but due to You. There is no goodness except</p>  
 <p>from You and I could never avert any evil save that which You dispelled.</p>  
 <p>To dispel the evil was neither within my power nor could I think of doing</p>  
 <p>so. O my Lord! You took me where I could not hope to reach and</p>  
 <p>bestowed upon me O' my Lord! that for which I had lost all hopes Praise</p>  
 <p>be therefore to You. O the Forgiver of sins! Forgive me and cast into my</p>  
 <p>heart Your pleasure so as to render easy for me the most difficult</p>  
 <p>situations in the world O my Lord! Bestow upon me all the means of</p>  
 <p>happiness, comfort and goodness. O Allah! Grant me such means and</p>  
 <p>guide me towards it and show me the way to get out of the difficulties. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! From those of Your bondsmen to whom You delegated power to</p>  
 <p>exercise on me and authority to settle my affair, You take that control</p>  
 <p>from them within Your possession from their hearts, tongues, ears eyes,</p>  
 <p>from their front, from behind them, from above them, from underneath</p>  
 <p>their feet, from their right, from their left, and from where You wish, and</p>  
 <p>in the manner You desire till none can reach me with evil intention. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! Keep me under Your protection and near You for Your nearness</p>  
 <p>is honoured, Your praise is great. There is no god save You. You are all</p>  
 <p>peace and peace emanates from You. O the Glorious and Gracious! I</p>  
 <p>beseech You to save me from the Hell-fire and accommodate me in the</p>  
 <p>abode of peace. O Allah! I request You to grant me all the good of this</p>  
 <p>world and of the Hereafter, and I seek refuge with You against all the</p>  
 <p>evils of this world and that of the Hereafter known to me or not. And I</p>  
 <p>ask You all the good requested for and all the good not requested for.</p>  
 <p>And I seek Your protection against all evils I fear or I have not feared</p>  
 <p>thereof. And grant me sustenance from sources I can think of and from</p>  
 <p>sources I cannot think of. O Allah! I am Your bondsman the son of Your</p>  
 <p>bondsman and the son of Your maid. Within Your control is my destiny.</p>  
 <p>Your decisions are just. I beseech You with every name of Yours</p>  
 <p>whereby You have named Yourself, or which You have sent down in</p>  
 <p>any of Your revealed Books, or taught anyone of Your Creation, or</p>  
 <p>Preserved it in the Knowledge of the Unseen with You. Bless</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.), Your Ummi Prophet, bondsman, Messenger and</p>  
 <p>the chosen one from Your Creation, and his pure and virtuous Progeny,</p>  
 <p>and have mercy on Muhammad and his Progeny and have mercy on</p>  
 <p>them in the manner You blessed, favoured and showed mercy to Ibrahim</p>  
 <p>and his Progeny, verily You are Praiseworthy and Glorious. And make</p>  
 <p>the Quran the light for my heart soul, and through it make easy for me</p>  
 <p>my affairs, and expand my chest through it, and make it a delight of my</p>  
 <p>heart, consolation of my grief, and through it dispel my sadness and</p>  
 <p>worries, and make pleasant by its blessing my eating and drinking, and</p>  
 <p>guide me through it in my hearing and seeing, and make it a light for my</p>  
 <p>mind, bones, nerves hairs, nails, and skin, in front of me, above me,</p>  
 <p>below me, on my right and on my left. And let it act as light at my death,</p>  
 <p>and a light in my grave, and a light at the time of reckoning, and a light in</p>  
 <p>everything till You convey me to Paradise, O the Illuminator of the</p>  
 <p>Heavens and the Earth. You are as You have praised Yourself in Your</p>  
 <p>Book. Allah is the Illuminator of the Heavens and the Earth; the</p>  
 <p>similitude of His Light is as a niche in which is a lamp. The lamp is in a</p>  
 <p>glass; the glass is as it were a star shinning bright, lit from blessed olive</p>  
 <p>tree, neither eastern nor western, the oil whereof almost glows forth of</p>  
 <p>itself, and even though fire touches it not. Light upon Light Allah guides</p>  
 <p>to His Light whomsoever He wills. Allah sets parables for people and</p>  
 <p>Allah is All-Aware of all things. O Allah! Guide me through Your Light</p>  
 <p>and appoint on the day of resurrection a light in front of me, behind me,</p>  
 <p>on my right side, and on my left side, to guide me to the abode of peace,</p>  
 <p>O the Glorious and the Gracious! O Allah! I seek forgiveness and</p>  
 <p>comfort for me for my people, for my children, and protection for my</p>  
 <p>wealth in this world and in the Hereafter. O Allah! Bless Muhammad</p>  
 <p>(s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and protect me from the front, from the back,</p>  
 <p>from the right side, from the left side, from above, and from below. I seek</p>  
 <p>refuge with You. O Allah! Master of the realm! You give the realm to</p>  
 <p>whomsoever You like, and take away the realm from whomsoever You</p>  
 <p>like, in Your hands lies all the good; verily! You are over all things</p>  
 <p>Mighty. You cause the night to pass into the day and You cause the day</p>  
 <p>to pass into the night. You bring forth the living out of the dead and You</p>  
 <p>bring forth the dead out of the living, and You give sustenance to</p>  
 <p>whomsoever You like without measure. O the beneficent and the</p>  
 <p>Merciful in this world and the Hereafter! You bestow Your beneficence</p>  
 <p>and Mercy on whomsoever You like withhold the same for whomsoever</p>  
 <p>You like. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and have mercy</p>  
 <p>on me, repay my loan, forgive my sins and fulfill my needs, verily! You</p>  
 <p>are Powerful over all things. O Allah! I beseech You for You are the</p>  
 <p>Master of everything and what You wish does happen. O Allah I seek</p>  
 <p>from You true belief strong conviction without any skepticism, humility</p>  
 <p>with no element of pride in it, mercy which should lead me to the honour</p>  
 <p>of Your grace in this world and in the Hereafter. Verily You are Powerful</p>  
 <p>over all things. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure and purified</p>  
 <p>Progeny with Your mercy, O the most Merciful!</p>
