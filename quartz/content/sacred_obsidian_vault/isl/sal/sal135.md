 <p>(134)</p>  
 <p>His supplication for the eleventh of the</p>  
 <p>month</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>Glory be to Him Who carried His servant by night from the sacred</p>  
 <p>mosque of Kaaba to the farthest Mosque the surroundings of which He</p>  
 <p>has blessed in order to show him some of His signs. Verily He is</p>  
 <p>All-hearing, the All-seeing. Glory be to Him and Exalted is He far above</p>  
 <p>from what they say. Celebrate His glory, the seven Heavens and the</p>  
 <p>Earth and all those in them and there is not anything but it glorifies Him</p>  
 <p>but you understand not their glorification. Verily He is the Forbearing,</p>  
 <p>the Oft-forgiving. Glory be to Him, when a matter is decreed He only</p>  
 <p>says unto it "Be" and it is. So be you patient with what they say and</p>  
 <p>glorify your Lord by praising Him ere the rising of the sun and ere the</p>  
 <p>setting of it. And in some hours of the night do glorify Him and during</p>  
 <p>parts of the day that you may achieve pleasure of your Lord. Hallowed is</p>  
 <p>your Lord, the Lord and Majesty far above from that which they ascribe</p>  
 <p>unto Him. Peace be on the messengers of Allah. All praise be to Allah,</p>  
 <p>the Lord of the Worlds. Glory be to Allah, the Lord of the great Arsh.</p>  
 <p>Glory be to You. Verily I was of the unjust one. Hallowed is Allah and</p>  
 <p>Exalted High is He far above what they join with Him. Glory be to Him.</p>  
 <p>He is Allah the only One, the All-dominant. Glory be to Him in Whose</p>  
 <p>hand is the basis of everything and to Him is the return of everything.</p>  
 <p>Glory be to Him the Lord of the seven skies and the Lord of the great</p>  
 <p>Arsh. Celebrates the praise of Allah, whatever is in the Heavens and the</p>  
 <p>Earth; He causes life and causes death; and He has power over</p>  
 <p>everything. He is the First and the Last and the Manifest and the</p>  
 <p>Hidden, and is the Knower of all things. He it is Who created the</p>  
 <p>Heavens and the Earth in six days and then firmly established Himself</p>  
 <p>over the Arsh; knows whatever enters the earth and whatever descends</p>  
 <p>from the heavens and whatever goes up into it. And He is with you</p>  
 <p>wherever you be and Allah is the seer of whatever you do. His is the</p>  
 <p>realm of Heavens and Earth and to Allah is the return of all affairs. He</p>  
 <p>causes the night to enter in upon the day and causes He the day to</p>  
 <p>enter in upon the night. He alone is Knower of the secrets of the heart.</p>  
 <p>Whatever is in the Heavens and whatever is in the Earth praise the</p>  
 <p>Glory of Allah. He is Ever prevalent, the All wise. He is Allah the Creator,</p>  
 <p>the Maker and the Fashioner. His are all the Excellent names;</p>  
 <p>whatsoever is in the Heavens and in the Earth hallows Him. He is the</p>  
 <p>Ever prevalent and the All wise. Hallows the Glory of Allah whatsoever is</p>  
 <p>in the Heavens and whatsoever is in the Earth. His exclusively is the</p>  
 <p>Realm and unto Him only is due all praise and He alone over all things is</p>  
 <p>All-powerful. And during a part of the night prostrate in obeisance to Him</p>  
 <p>and celebrate His praise all night long. Celebrate then the praise of your</p>  
 <p>Lord and seek His protection. Verily He is Oft-turning Merciful. Glory be</p>  
 <p>to You. People glorify You morning and evening. Men whom neither</p>  
 <p>transactions nor trade diverts from the remembrance of Allah and</p>  
 <p>constancy in prayer and paying the Zakat. They fear the day when the</p>  
 <p>hearts and eyes shall writhe of anguish. Glory be to Him, the Heavens</p>  
 <p>glorify Him. Everything glorifies His praise with all humility. Dignified is</p>  
 <p>He Who is unique in His Glory, Who is known for His unity, well</p>  
 <p>acquainted to all for His kindness and is Mighty and Omnipotent as the</p>  
 <p>Lord of the Worlds. All glamour, light and beauty are eternally for Him. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! All praise is for You. I ask You all the good for me in my religion,</p>  
 <p>world and in my Hereafter. And I seek refuge with You from all evils.</p>  
 <p>Verily You do what You wish and decree as You desire. Bless</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Holy, virtuous and chosen Progeny and</p>  
 <p>greet them with a worthy greeting.</p>
