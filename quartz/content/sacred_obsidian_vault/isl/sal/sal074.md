 <p>His supplication in the Battlefield of Siffin</p>  
 <p>before lifting the Holy Quran on spears and</p>  
 <p>when the people did not pay any heed Ali</p>  
 <p>(a.s.) recited thus:</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! I seek forgiveness from the difficulties of examination and from</p>  
 <p>the evil designs of the enemy. O Allah! Forgive my sins make my actions</p>  
 <p>pure, ward away my sins because in front of those whom You have</p>  
 <p>bestowed power, I am totally helpless, grant me such a tolerance that</p>  
 <p>the doors of ignorance are closed, bestow on me that knowledge by</p>  
 <p>which ignorance goes away. Give me that certainty by which the doubts</p>  
 <p>are dispelled. Grant me that understanding which brings me out from the</p>  
 <p>corruptions. Bestow on me that light by which I can bring understanding</p>  
 <p>in people and can seek guidance from darkness. O Allah! Reform my</p>  
 <p>ears, eyes, intellect, heart, such reforms which remain; and which also</p>  
 <p>reforms the other parts of the body. I ask You for ease at the time of</p>  
 <p>death and forgiveness at the time of accounting. O Allah! I love all those</p>  
 <p>actions which are dear to You and accepted by You, always involve me</p>  
 <p>in such deeds and honour me by those deeds which are close to You,</p>  
 <p>and grant me sincerity and steadiness in those deeds, after which I</p>  
 <p>continue doing those deeds throughout my life and whatever You have</p>  
 <p>bestowed upon Your pious creatures make it as a support for me, make</p>  
 <p>it in such a way that I never sell it at any cost throughout my life, neither I</p>  
 <p>exchange it for something, in ease or difficulties, either forgetfully or</p>  
 <p>intentionally so much so that I die in this state. Grant me a great</p>  
 <p>martyrdom in Your way; in helping You and Your Prophet. I can buy the</p>  
 <p>life of the hereafter with the life of the world and gain Your Pleasure. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! I ask from You such a heart which is tranquil and steadfast, safe</p>  
 <p>and praying, which can understand recognition and adhere to it, does</p>  
 <p>not love evil and be away from it, neither it is a transgressor, nor</p>  
 <p>wretched nor uncertain. O the one to spread mercy. O the one Whose</p>  
 <p>mercy precedes His Wrath. I request You to let my life proceed towards</p>  
 <p>goodness and let death be a means of clearing all the defects. Complete</p>  
 <p>my deeds on martyrdom. O my supporter in difficulties, O my Lord at</p>  
 <p>times of need and O the Lord of my bounties. Make me thankful on the</p>  
 <p>bounties, patience on calamities, agreeable on destiny, trust on the</p>  
 <p>covenants, grace for protecting the laws of Islam, piety, reliance on</p>  
 <p>Yourself, relation with You, attachment with Your book, insight of Your</p>  
 <p>right, strength for Your worship, delight in Your remembrance, must be</p>  
 <p>destined for me till the time You keep me on Your earth and when death</p>  
 <p>comes make my death as being killed in Your way, and that too by the</p>  
 <p>worst of Your creatures, and my past life like those who while living</p>  
 <p>received sustenance from Your kingdom. O Allah! Bestow light in my</p>  
 <p>eyes, certainty in my heart, and fear in my soul and Your remembrance</p>  
 <p>on my tongue. O Allah! Grant me that pleasure which Your beloved ones</p>  
 <p>had when they were seeking from You and I fear Your wrath as Your</p>  
 <p>beloved ones used to fear You. O Allah! Bestow on me Your Happiness</p>  
 <p>and obedience, to such an extent that except You, I don't fear any of</p>  
 <p>Your creature and leave Your obedience. O Allah! When You grant me</p>  
 <p>bounties also bestow on me the power to thank You by which I</p>  
 <p>remember You and those bounties which are away from me. You find</p>  
 <p>me needing it. Grant me reward and patience on it. O Allah! Dispel</p>  
 <p>poverty from me in the world and let me not be unmindful of Your</p>  
 <p>worship, don't let me be away from Your remembrance, and do not divert</p>  
 <p>my attention from the rewards which are with You. O Allah! I seek refuge</p>  
 <p>from the sorrow, helplessness, laziness, cowardice, miserliness, and</p>  
 <p>bad behaviour, excess of debts, overpowering and enmity of the people,</p>  
 <p>trouble of days, evil deeds of the inhabitants of the earth, and the</p>  
 <p>intolerable things. And I seek Your safety from all those things which</p>  
 <p>become a barrier between You and me or which makes me away from</p>  
 <p>You or divert my attention from You. Or minimize my share from You and</p>  
 <p>I seek Your Protection from my sins, my oppression upon myself,</p>  
 <p>following my soul may prevent Your Mercy and Promises from me. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! I seek refuge from an evil companion whose heart even is inclined</p>  
 <p>to me, and eyes set on me, his ears are hearing me, but when he sees</p>  
 <p>goodness he conceals it from me and if he sees evil he reveals it to me,</p>  
 <p>and I seek refuge from this greed which brings us closer to another</p>  
 <p>greed. I seek refuge from the deviation, which destroys me and that</p>  
 <p>corruption which ruins me, and from that sin after which there is no</p>  
 <p>repentance and from the destruction of progeny and wealth, which is</p>  
 <p>visible at the time of death, and I seek Your protection from Polytheism,</p>  
 <p>disobedience, prejudice and anger. And I seek refuge from those things</p>  
 <p>that makes me rebellious and from the poverty which destroys me and</p>  
 <p>from the desires which annihilate me and those deeds which debase</p>  
 <p>me, and from friend who deviate me. O Allah! I seek Your protection</p>  
 <p>from the day whose beginning is fear and end is restlessness in which</p>  
 <p>faces turn black and heart becomes dry and of those sins that seize the</p>  
 <p>good deeds which is not forgiven by You and of the sins which prevents</p>  
 <p>good deeds and with the hope which refuses good deeds, and from that</p>  
 <p>life which refrains from good death, I seek refuge from ignorance and</p>  
 <p>from vain talks, foul language and evil deeds, from that diseases which</p>  
 <p>keeps me busy, from that health which makes me forget You, I seek</p>  
 <p>refuge from fatigue and tiredness, from sorrow and hardships, from</p>  
 <p>deviation and cheating, from disgrace, poverty and ego, from doing</p>  
 <p>actions for showing off, from shame and sorrow, from revolt and</p>  
 <p>mischief, from all calamities and evil, from the calamities of this world</p>  
 <p>and the hereafter. With Your help I wish to be saved from all absurdities,</p>  
 <p>from the whispering of the hearts and from all those words and actions</p>  
 <p>which You do not approve of and by Your help I wish to be saved from</p>  
 <p>the Jinns, people, cheating, calamities of the day and night, from the evil</p>  
 <p>of Jinns and the evil eyes of the people. O Allah! I seek protection from</p>  
 <p>You, save me from the evil of the heart, evil of the tongue, evil of the</p>  
 <p>ears, and mischief of the eyes. I supplicate to You, save me from the</p>  
 <p>stomach which never fills, and from the heart which is not afraid of You</p>  
 <p>and from the supplication which is not worth hearing and from the prayer</p>  
 <p>which is rejected. O Allah! Do not put me in the smallest chastisement</p>  
 <p>and do not let me stray into misguidance. O Allah! Save me from Your</p>  
 <p>severest control, High power, Honour and Kingdom and from all the</p>  
 <p>harms of Your entire creation.</p>
