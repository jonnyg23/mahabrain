 <p>(13)</p>  
 <p>His supplication, invoking peace on Prophet</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! O the one to move the moving things, and the one to hold the</p>  
 <p>things without any support (viz. skies), O the one to shape the hearts to</p>  
 <p>their inner instinct which has the power of goodness and evil. Send Your</p>  
 <p>abundant blessings on Your special and selected servant Muhammad</p>  
 <p>(s.a.w.a.) and his progeny who will make the preceeding religion reach</p>  
 <p>its climax, and will reveal the concealed things, will proclaim the truth by</p>  
 <p>truth, who will eradicate evil, break the power of deviation which was</p>  
 <p>entrusted to him. He fulfilled his covenant in a right way, was firm on</p>  
 <p>Your commands, was always desiring Your wish, neither he retreated</p>  
 <p>nor was there any laxity in his intentions. He was attentively hearing</p>  
 <p>Your revelations, was a protector of Your covenant, the one to</p>  
 <p>prosecute Your commands so much that for the seekers of light, it</p>  
 <p>illuminated, was a way for the deviated ones, the heart after being</p>  
 <p>involved in corruption and ignorance, found guidance. With the help of</p>  
 <p>Your signs, and clear laws he has illuminated everything. Now He is</p>  
 <p>Your protected one and the trustee of Your Guarded Knowledge, Your</p>  
 <p>witnesses on the day of reward and Your appointed one with truth is</p>  
 <p>Your Prophet towards the creatures. O Allah grant him a high place in</p>  
 <p>Your mercy, by Your grace grant him the greatest reward. Raise him in</p>  
 <p>the highest ranks as compared to all of those whom You will raise. Make</p>  
 <p>his status more holy, complete the light (of Your Wilayat) for him. In lieu</p>  
 <p>of appointing him as a Prophet, make his witness accepted, and his</p>  
 <p>speech a delight. Make his speech decisive, gather us together in the</p>  
 <p>lifes pleasantness, at the stage of bounties, at the desire of the wishes,</p>  
 <p>the facilities of the abodes of satisfaction of the desires, heights of</p>  
 <p>contentment and with the gifts of Miracles.</p>
