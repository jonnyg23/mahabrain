 <p>(137)</p>  
 <p>His supplication for the fourteenth of the</p>  
 <p>month</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O my Lord! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.), the Ummi Prophet and his</p>  
 <p>Progeny in the manner You blessed Ibrahim (a.s.) and his offspring.</p>  
 <p>Surely You are Praiseworthy and Glorified. O Allah! After praising You</p>  
 <p>and seeking Your Blessing for Your Prophet, I beseech You forgive all</p>  
 <p>my sins, past and present, manifest and hidden, known to me or</p>  
 <p>unknown and those You have reckoned which I have personally</p>  
 <p>forgotten. O Allah! O Allah! O Allah! O the Beneficent! O the Beneficent!</p>  
 <p>O the Beneficent! O the Merciful! O the Merciful! O the Merciful! There</p>  
 <p>is no god save You, the voice of the people are choked before You.</p>  
 <p>Their mind is confused and the eyes are dazzled before You and we are</p>  
 <p>present in Your Court with our hearts. There is no god except You. All</p>  
 <p>things are humble before You and are incapable of reaching You. All</p>  
 <p>things are submissive to Your honour. There is no god beside You. All</p>  
 <p>creatures are within Your powerful control and so are their forelocks</p>  
 <p>within Your grip. Who attributes partner to You is also Your creature.</p>  
 <p>You are the Lord with no peer and immortal with no destruction,</p>  
 <p>Self-subsistent without any decline. Absolute Sovereign with no</p>  
 <p>associate, Ever-living Who enlivens the dead and watchful seeing the</p>  
 <p>deeds of everyone. There is no god beside You! You are the One</p>  
 <p>existing before Your Creation and would survive even after the death</p>  
 <p>and destruction of all things. To them You are Manifest and for them</p>  
 <p>You are Master support at the back, Nearer to them, their Ruler and</p>  
 <p>Creator, You take the possession of their souls. You are their sustainer,</p>  
 <p>their Ultimate Hope, their Guardian, Centre of their complaints, remover</p>  
 <p>of their troubles and their Forgiver. There is none above You to</p>  
 <p>intervene between You and Your creatures. In Your control is their stay</p>  
 <p>and departure from this worlds. We recline to You with hope and seek</p>  
 <p>Your kindness. There is no power and Might but through You. There is</p>  
 <p>no god but You. You are the source of strength for every weak,</p>  
 <p>Redresser of every complaint, Assurer of the frightened, Hearer of every</p>  
 <p>plaint and Dispeller of every trouble. There is no god save You. You are</p>  
 <p>the Fortress for everyone who seeks refuge, the Honour of every</p>  
 <p>degraded and the Redeemer of everyone who is oppressed. O You the</p>  
 <p>Powerful and Almighty! There is no power and strength without You.</p>  
 <p>There is no god except You. You are owner of every bounty, Dispeller of</p>  
 <p>every evil, ultimate Hope for fulfillment of every desire, and Fulfiller of</p>  
 <p>every need. There is no power and might without You. There is no god</p>  
 <p>beside You. You are kind to Your creatures and to Your bondsmen</p>  
 <p>although You are independent of them and they are completely</p>  
 <p>dependent on You. There is no god save You. You are aware of</p>  
 <p>everything hidden and witness every secret of the heart, You bless</p>  
 <p>whom You wish and do what You please, O the Ever-living! There is no</p>  
 <p>god except You. There is no might or power without You, O! Allah! You</p>  
 <p>are the Knower of the hidden and the manifest, the Beneficent; the</p>  
 <p>Merciful, Originator of the Heavens and the earth, Glorious and</p>  
 <p>Gracious. You are Forgiver of sins, Acceptor of penitence, Severe in</p>  
 <p>chastisement and Bountiful in giving. There is no god except You and to</p>  
 <p>You is the return. O Allah! I ask You in the name of "there is no god but</p>  
 <p>You" to bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and fulfill my</p>  
 <p>desires, my hopes and my aims as it is easy for You because You are</p>  
 <p>Powerful over all things. In fact You are so powerful that to whatever</p>  
 <p>thing You say "Be", it comes into being at once. O Allah! Send Your</p>  
 <p>Blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny. Ameen.</p>
