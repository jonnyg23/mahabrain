 <p>Dua of Imam (a.s.) in Praise of Allah, the</p>  
 <p>Most High and Glorified</p>  
 <p>Famous as ''Dua-e-Yastasheer''</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>All praise is due to Allah except Whom there is no god and He is the Living, the</p>  
 <p>Self-existing, the everlasting, the King, the Manifest Truth. He is the</p>  
 <p>Administrator without any minister. And He does not consult any of His slaves</p>  
 <p>from His creations. He is the First, Who cannot be described. He is Eternal</p>  
 <p>and will live forever, (even) after the annihilation of all creatures. He is the</p>  
 <p>greatest Lord, the Light of the earths and heavens. And their Originator and</p>  
 <p>Creator without visible supports. He created both of them and separated them a</p>  
 <p>proper separation. The heavens became stable in obedience to His command</p>  
 <p>and the lands became fixed on the surface of the water with their pegs. Then</p>  
 <p>our Lord the All-Merciful subdued the high heavens and ruled from the Throne.</p>  
 <p>Everything that is in heavens and in the earth and in between them and what is</p>  
 <p>below the earth belongs to Him. So, I bear witness that verily You are Allah.</p>  
 <p>There is none to elevate what You have lowered and no one to exalt him whom</p>  
 <p>You leave in disgrace and no one to bring into disgrace whom You exalt and no</p>  
 <p>one to prevent from one whom You bestow Your favour and no one to bestow</p>  
 <p>anything, which You have withheld. And You are Allah; there is no god but</p>  
 <p>You. Who existed when there was neither the stable sky nor the broad earth</p>  
 <p>nor the brilliant sun nor the dark night, nor the bright day, nor the vast and</p>  
 <p>stormy sea, nor any stable mountain, nor any revolving planet, nor the luminous</p>  
 <p>moon, nor any blowing wind, nor any raining cloud, nor flashing lightning, nor</p>  
 <p>any praising thunder, nor any breathing soul, nor any flying bird, nor any</p>  
 <p>blazing fire, nor any flowing water. You existed before the existence of</p>  
 <p>everything. You enriched some and reduced others to poverty, caused some to</p>  
 <p>die and brought others to life, and made some people glad and others weep.</p>  
 <p>Verily You rule from the Throne. You are of vast blessing, O Allah You are</p>  
 <p>Great and Supreme. You are Allah and there is no god other than You. You</p>  
 <p>are the all-Knowing Creator. Your Decree is overpowering and Your</p>  
 <p>Knowledge is operative. Your strategy is wonderful; Your promise is true; Your</p>  
 <p>word is right; Your command is just; Your utterance is right guidance; Your</p>  
 <p>Revelation is light; Your mercy is vast; Your forgiveness is great; Your grace is</p>  
 <p>excessive; Your gift is most respectable; Your cord is strong; Your might is</p>  
 <p>ever ready; Your protégé is powerful; Your wrath is severe; and Your</p>  
 <p>stratagem is entrapping. O Lord! With You are lodged all complaints. You are</p>  
 <p>present in all gatherings, and are the witness of all secrets, and the ultimate</p>  
 <p>goal of all supplications, the expeller of all sorrows, the affluence of every</p>  
 <p>needy person, the stronghold for every refugee, security for everyone who is</p>  
 <p>terror-stricken, a shield for the weak, a treasure for the indigent, the destroyer</p>  
 <p>of sorrows, the helper of the virtuous. Such is Allah, Lord of the worlds. Our</p>  
 <p>Lord, there is no god but He. And You suffice Your servants and are helper of</p>  
 <p>those who rely on You. You are the helper of one who is firmly attached to You</p>  
 <p>and humiliates oneself before You, a shield for one who seeks refuge with You,</p>  
 <p>the help of one who looks up to You for help, the forgiver of sins for one who</p>  
 <p>begs Your pardon, the Powerful over the powerful ones, the most grand of the</p>  
 <p>grand, the most great of the great, the master of masters, the Lord of lords, the</p>  
 <p>Succour of the grieved, the Helper of those crying for help, the Responder to</p>  
 <p>the call of the distressed, the best of all listeners, the best of all observers, the</p>  
 <p>best of all judges, the quickest of all reckoners, the most merciful of all the</p>  
 <p>merciful, the best of all forgivers, the satisfier of the needs of the faithful, and</p>  
 <p>the hearer of the appeals of the virtuous. You are Allah; there is no god but</p>  
 <p>You. You are the Lord of all the worlds. You are the Creator and I am a</p>  
 <p>creature. You are the Ruler and I am the subject, You are the Lord and I am a</p>  
 <p>slave. You are the Provider while I am provided with sustenance, You are the</p>  
 <p>Giver while I am a beggar, You are the Generous while I am a miser. You are</p>  
 <p>the Mighty while I am weak; You are the Noble while I am humble. You are the</p>  
 <p>independent while I am needy. You are the Master while I am the slave. You</p>  
 <p>are the Forgiver of sins while I am sinful. You are the Omniscient while I am</p>  
 <p>ignorant. You are the forbearing while I am hasty. You are the All Merciful and</p>  
 <p>I have been treated with mercy. You are the Provider of safety but I am</p>  
 <p>involved in suffering. You are the Responder and I am the distressed. And I</p>  
 <p>bear witness that verily You are Allah, there is no god but You. You bestow</p>  
 <p>favours upon Your slaves even without their asking. And I bear witness that</p>  
 <p>verily You are Allah, the One, the Peerless, the Unique, the independent, the</p>  
 <p>Single, and verily to You we must return. May the blessings of Allah be upon</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his family the holy and pure. O Lord, forgive my sins</p>  
 <p>and keep my faults concealed and extend to me Your special mercy and</p>  
 <p>bounteous sustenance. O the All merciful! All praise is due to Allah the Lord of</p>  
 <p>all the worlds. And for us Allah is the Sufficient and the excellent Protector.</p>  
 <p>There is neither might nor power but with Allah the Great, the Exalted.</p>
