 <p>An elegy (Munajat)</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O the possessor of munificence You give</p>  
 <p>whatever You wish and hold back whatever You</p>  
 <p>wish</p>  
 <p>My Lord! My Creator! My Refuge in difficulties</p>  
 <p>or ease. I seek only from You.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! If my sins are great and numerous,</p>  
 <p>You are Greater and Your forgiveness is more</p>  
 <p>great and familiar.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! Even if You fulfill the desires of my</p>  
 <p>heart I would still be shameful in the garden of</p>  
 <p>desires.</p>  
 <p>My Lord You are witnessing my indigence and</p>  
 <p>poverty and You are listening to my whispering</p>  
 <p>elegy.</p>  
 <p>My Lord do not decline my hopes and do not</p>  
 <p>render my heart useless because Your</p>  
 <p>generosity is my only hope.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! If I am unsuccessful or driven out, then</p>  
 <p>from whom can I hope and to whom can I plead?</p>  
 <p>My Lord! Save me from Your wrath, as I am</p>  
 <p>prisoner (of my sins). Helpless, fearful and I</p>  
 <p>have bowed down before You.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! Show Your proofs and sympathise</p>  
 <p>with me, in my grave when I am in a terrible</p>  
 <p>state.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! Even if You punish me for a thousand</p>  
 <p>years my hopes from You would remain intact.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! Bestow on me the taste of forgiveness</p>  
 <p>on that day, when neither children nor wealth</p>  
 <p>will be beneficial.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! If You desert me I will be rendered</p>  
 <p>useless and if You considered me then I will not</p>  
 <p>lose anything.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! You don't oblige anyone except with</p>  
 <p>goodness. Then who will be the hope of those</p>  
 <p>wretched people who live on this hope?</p>  
 <p>My Lord! If I have been careless in acquiring</p>  
 <p>piety</p>  
 <p>I am still in pursuit of seeking forgiveness and</p>  
 <p>repentance.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! If I have sinned and that was</p>  
 <p>ignorance, I have still pinned so many hopes on</p>  
 <p>You that people have concluded that I do not</p>  
 <p>fear You.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! My sins are like mountains, hard and</p>  
 <p>great, but Your forgiveness is greater.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! Remembrance of Your favours</p>  
 <p>extinguishes the fi re of my hear t, and</p>  
 <p>remembrance of my sins make me cry.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! Forgive my laziness and erase my sins</p>  
 <p>because I confess, I fear and I express my</p>  
 <p>inability.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! Grant me peace and tranquility, as</p>  
 <p>except for Your favours I have not knocked</p>  
 <p>anybody's door.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! If You disgrace me who will be my</p>  
 <p>hope and what shall I do?</p>  
 <p>My Lord! The love-stricken are awake at night,</p>  
 <p>they whisper and supplicate whereas the</p>  
 <p>negligent are asleep.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! From the inhabitants of this world</p>  
 <p>some are asleep, some are awake and complain</p>  
 <p>and all are seeking Your favours, expecting</p>  
 <p>Your great mercy and desiring Your Heaven.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! My hopes are making me hopeless.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! If You forgive me then Your</p>  
 <p>forgiveness will take me to salvation, as I have</p>  
 <p>already committed sins which can destroy me.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! For the sake of Muhammad the</p>  
 <p>Hashimite (peace be upon him and his progeny)</p>  
 <p>and by the names of the doers of good who</p>  
 <p>plead in Your presence.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! For the sake of Mustafa (s.a.w.a.) and</p>  
 <p>the son of his uncle and by their pure progeny,</p>  
 <p>who has lowered his neck in Your presence.</p>  
 <p>My Lord! Make me die on Your religion; I am a</p>  
 <p>suppliant, fearful, worshipper and an obedient</p>  
 <p>one in Your court.</p>  
 <p>My Lord and my Master! Do not make me</p>  
 <p>unsuccessful from the great intercession of</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) because he will be the</p>  
 <p>only intercessor who can intercede till the time a</p>  
 <p>caller calls You. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
 <p>and his progeny till the time the worshipper</p>  
 <p>supplicates in Your presence.</p>
