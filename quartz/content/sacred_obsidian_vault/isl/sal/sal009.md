 <p>His Supplication mentioning Isme Azam</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah I beseech You by that name which is preserved in the hidden</p>  
 <p>treasurers, which is the greatest and the most important, Proof, Truth,</p>  
 <p>Protector, Pure, which is light and is from light. It's light is with the light,</p>  
 <p>and that light is above all lights, light filled with lights, brightness in</p>  
 <p>brightness. That light by which all the darkness was illuminated, which</p>  
 <p>destroyed all the compellers which could not be controlled by the</p>  
 <p>Heavens or the Earth. O He through Whom the fear of a fearful can be</p>  
 <p>averted, the magic of the magician be cast away, the conspiracy of</p>  
 <p>conspirer can be void, the jealousy of every jealous be finished, the</p>  
 <p>rebellion of every rebel is stopped, in Presence of His Greatness the</p>  
 <p>mountain, the earth, the seas split open and if spoken then the Angels</p>  
 <p>protect and by it on a ship, the stormy waves cannot reach it, with it</p>  
 <p>every transgressor and enemy and disobedient devil is controlled and it</p>  
 <p>is Your Majestic and Greatest name which You have used for Yourself,</p>  
 <p>by which You are on the Holy Throne and on Your Exalted chair. O Allah</p>  
 <p>Who is Greater and the Greatest, O Allah the honoured light,</p>  
 <p>unparalleled Creator of the Heavens and the Earth. O Lord of Majesty</p>  
 <p>and Generosity I beseech You by Your Honour and Your Majesty and</p>  
 <p>Your Power and Your Abundance and by the Position of Muhammad</p>  
 <p>(s.a.w.a.) and his pure progeny (a.s.). I supplicate to You by You and by</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny that bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
 <p>and his progeny and free me, my parents and the believing men and</p>  
 <p>women from the fire of Hell and bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his</p>  
 <p>progeny. Surely You are the Praised, the Glorious.</p>
