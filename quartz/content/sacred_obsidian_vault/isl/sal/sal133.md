 <p>(132)</p>  
 <p>His supplication for the ninth of the month</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! All praise be to You for every good that You have bestowed on</p>  
 <p>us and for every evil that You have warded off from us. Praise be to You</p>  
 <p>for everything that You have created, originated, made and evolved. All</p>  
 <p>praise be to You for taking our test, for every poverty, for every wealth,</p>  
 <p>and for everything given to or taken back from us, for causing death and</p>  
 <p>giving life, authority of all these therefore rests with You. Hallowed are</p>  
 <p>You and most High, Who so takes You as his master is not disgraced</p>  
 <p>and he whom You hate cannot be respected. You are the Origin and to</p>  
 <p>You is the return. Decisions are Yours, there is none above You to</p>  
 <p>decide. You are self-sufficient and the people are dependent on You. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! Here am I ready to worship You. Praise be to You equal to the</p>  
 <p>amount of praise You own and equal to the amount of praise You made</p>  
 <p>others to own. You are the owner of the earth and the things that are</p>  
 <p>thereon. To You is the return of all. Those eulogising You fall short of</p>  
 <p>praising You in the manner You have praised Yourself. O Allah! Praise</p>  
 <p>be to You for You are the Master of praise, You are the end of praise</p>  
 <p>and You really deserve the praise. Praise be to You such that is befitting</p>  
 <p>none except You. Praise be to You in the night when the darkness</p>  
 <p>spreads and praise be to You during the day when it becomes bright,</p>  
 <p>praise be to You in this world and in the Hereafter. Praise be to You in</p>  
 <p>the high heaven and in the earth below; all things are perishable but</p>  
 <p>Your countenance. O Allah! Praise be to You in weal and woe. Praise</p>  
 <p>be to You in ease and in difficulty. Praise be to You at times of</p>  
 <p>calamities and during happiness. Praise be to You in the hours of</p>  
 <p>hardships and on receiving Your favours. O Allah! Praise be to You in</p>  
 <p>the manner You have praised Yourself in Surah-e-Fateha, in the Torah,</p>  
 <p>in the Evangel and in the Holy Quran. Praise be to You such that its</p>  
 <p>beginning, its end and its objective be limitless. O Allah! Praise be to</p>  
 <p>You for favouring us with Islam. Praise be to You for bestowing the Holy</p>  
 <p>Quran. Praise be to You on wealth and children and praise be to You in</p>  
 <p>enabling me to offer thanks to You for Your favours and bounties. Praise</p>  
 <p>be to You for praise began with You and it will end at You. You have no</p>  
 <p>associate. O Allah! Praise be to You for You overlook the sins despite</p>  
 <p>having knowledge and forgive despite having power to punish. Praise</p>  
 <p>be to You on bounties and favours on us. Praise be for You on Your</p>  
 <p>Benevolence shown to us. Praise be to You for Your bounties which</p>  
 <p>none can count except You and for Your bounties which are open and</p>  
 <p>cannot be concealed. Praise be to You as often as there are Your</p>  
 <p>countless favours. Praise be to You equal to the number of things the</p>  
 <p>account of which You know, the number of things that Your knowledge</p>  
 <p>embrace, the things that have imbued with light and things that You</p>  
 <p>have confined in the Book. O Allah! Praise be to You as You are worthy</p>  
 <p>of it. There is no god except You. Neither the darkness of the light, nor</p>  
 <p>the Zodiac sky, nor the earth with its undulations nor the seas with</p>  
 <p>waves, nor the high peaked mountains, nor the layers under layers of</p>  
 <p>darkness can conceal You. Praise be to You for I am that humble</p>  
 <p>servant whom You have reared. Praise be to You for I am that beggar</p>  
 <p>whom You have elevated. Praise be to You for I am that valueless whom</p>  
 <p>You have honoured. Praise be to You for I am that mean whom You</p>  
 <p>have dignified. Praise be to You for I am the seeker whom You have</p>  
 <p>bestowed. Praise be to You for I am Your devotee whom You have</p>  
 <p>pleased. Praise be to You for I am the poverty-stricken whom You have</p>  
 <p>enriched. Praise be to You for I am that misled whom You have guided</p>  
 <p>and praise be to You for I am that ignorant whom You have taught.</p>  
 <p>Praise be to You for I am obscure and You granted me reputation.</p>  
 <p>Praise be to You for I am that wrongdoer whom You have pardoned.</p>  
 <p>Praise be to You for I am that sinner whom You have shown mercy.</p>  
 <p>Praise be to You for I am that lonely traveller to whom You gave</p>  
 <p>company. Praise be to You for I am that who was far away and</p>  
 <p>conveyed me to my destination. Praise be to You for I am that whom</p>  
 <p>You protected. Praise be to You for I am that sick whom You cured.</p>  
 <p>Praise be to You for I am that diseased whom You made healthy. Praise</p>  
 <p>be to You for I am that hungry whom You fed, that unclothed whom You</p>  
 <p>covered, that driven out whom You sheltered, that lonely whom You</p>  
 <p>assisted, that forsaken whom You helped, that aggrieved whom You</p>  
 <p>relieved and that sorrow stricken whom You consoled. O my Allah!</p>  
 <p>Praise be to You is plenty in the manner of Your numerous bounties. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! These are the bounties which You particularised for me amongst</p>  
 <p>all mankind. You have made the universe subservient to human beings,</p>  
 <p>removed their difficulties and bestowed Your bounties. Praise be to You</p>  
 <p>the Lord of the Worlds. O Allah! All that You have bestowed on me was</p>  
 <p>not in return for any of my good deed nor because I was entitled to them.</p>  
 <p>You did not remove the worldly sorrows, sorrows and pains and spared</p>  
 <p>me from various calamities and disasters because I deserved it, but You</p>  
 <p>did so that Your kindness and Your proof should be established on me.</p>  
 <p>O the Most merciful! Praise be to You that You have bestowed</p>  
 <p>countless bounties and have warded off immeasurable calamities.</p>
