 <p>(61)</p>  
 <p>His supplication, which he recited every</p>  
 <p>morning and evening</p>  
 <p>He (a.s.) had recited this Dua on the bed of the</p>  
 <p>Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) on the Night of Hijrat.</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! I am saved in the morning and evening by the promise of Your</p>  
 <p>safety. That covenant with which no intention can be compared and no</p>  
 <p>one can achieve greatness over it. Send blessing on the progeny of</p>  
 <p>Your Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and the shield of love and with the</p>  
 <p>tight armour, save me from everyone who overpowers and who attacks</p>  
 <p>suddenly and from the fearful place of Your creatures and from the fear</p>  
 <p>of silent things grant me sanctity. By the right of those who accept</p>  
 <p>sincerely, save me as a fort from all those people who wish to harm me.</p>  
 <p>And due to the ties that they believe is their right. I am with them and</p>  
 <p>between them and because of them. I love them who love them and I am</p>  
 <p>away from them who are away from them. So bless Muhammad</p>  
 <p>(s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and You grant me protection. For their sake</p>  
 <p>save me from everything which I fear.</p>  
 <p>O the great one I have warded of all my enemies by taking the name of</p>  
 <p>the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and We have made before</p>  
 <p>them a barrier and a barrier behind them, then We have covered them</p>  
 <p>over so that they do not see.</p>
