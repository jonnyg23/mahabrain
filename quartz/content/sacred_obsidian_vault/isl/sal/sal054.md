 <p>(53)</p>  
 <p>His supplication in asking for needs and</p>  
 <p>attaining Proximity to Allah</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>I am linked with such a bond with Allah, there is no god but Him. He is</p>  
 <p>the one to give life to the dead and is their inheritor. I hold the robe of</p>  
 <p>such a Majestic Allah Who neither begets, Who looks after creatures</p>  
 <p>and is their custodian. I seek proximity to Allah Who does not have a</p>  
 <p>partner and he told the earth and the skies to be prepared for His</p>  
 <p>commands either willingly or unwillingly; both replied we are ready</p>  
 <p>willingly. I seek protection from Allah Who does not have a partner Who</p>  
 <p>is neither lazy nor sleeps. I seek nearness to Allah Who does not have a</p>  
 <p>partner. He is Beneficent Who rules in the skies Who is aware of the</p>  
 <p>action of the eyes and the secrets of the hearts. I seek refuge in Allah</p>  
 <p>Who does not have a partner and is aware of things in the Heavens and</p>  
 <p>the Earth and the things in between them and also that which is below</p>  
 <p>the crust of the earth. I seek protection from Allah Who does not have a</p>  
 <p>partner Who sees everyone but is not seen by anyone although He is at</p>  
 <p>a place of manifestation from the beginning to the end. I seek nearness</p>  
 <p>from Allah Who does not have a partner and in front of Whose Majesty</p>  
 <p>everything bow their head. I seek proximity to Allah Who does not have</p>  
 <p>a partner Who in spite of being near is on the great heights and</p>  
 <p>although being on great heights is near and is Powerful. I seek nearness</p>  
 <p>to Allah Who does not have a partner Whose power cannot be</p>  
 <p>described by tongues. I seek refuge in Allah Who does not have a</p>  
 <p>partner Who is living and eternal Who neither doses nor sleeps. I seek</p>  
 <p>nearness to Allah Who does not have a partner. He is extremely</p>  
 <p>beneficent and an obliger beyond measure; possessor of Grandeur and</p>  
 <p>Majesty. I seek proximity to Allah Who does not have a partner and is</p>  
 <p>self-sufficient that neither begets nor is begotten and there is no one like</p>  
 <p>Him. I seek refuge in Allah Who does not have a partner; all the</p>  
 <p>goodness is in His control and He has power over all things. I seek</p>  
 <p>closeness to Allah Who does not have a partner. Everything in the</p>  
 <p>Heavens and Earth glorify Him and everything is obedient to Him. I seek</p>  
 <p>proximity to Allah Who has no partner. He is Living and Wise, the</p>  
 <p>Hearing, the Knowing, the Beneficent, the Merciful. I seek closeness to</p>  
 <p>Allah Who does not have a partner. I rely on Him Who is the possessor</p>  
 <p>of the heavens. I begin in the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.</p>  
 <p>O Allah I ask from You, although You are well aware of my desires, I</p>  
 <p>seek from You whereas You know my wants. I have turned to You and</p>  
 <p>You are aware of my defects. O the one Who raises the skies, O the</p>  
 <p>averter of troubles, O the refuge of needy, O the one to fulfill the</p>  
 <p>desires. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.), the seal of the Prophets, and his</p>  
 <p>pure progeny. O Allah forgive my sins and all those things which You</p>  
 <p>are aware of more than me. O Allah forgive those sins which I have</p>  
 <p>committed knowingly or in ignorance, in happiness or in sorrow,</p>  
 <p>purposely or unintentionally. O Allah! Forgive my sins which I have</p>  
 <p>committed or which I will commit in future in private or in public. Forgive</p>  
 <p>them as You are the first and the last and You have power over all</p>  
 <p>things. O Allah, if You pardon me, pardon me completely because who is</p>  
 <p>that creature who has never committed a sin?</p>
