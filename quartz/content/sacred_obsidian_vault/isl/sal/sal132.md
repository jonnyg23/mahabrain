 <p>O God! Praise be to You equal to the number of trees and leaves,</p>

 <p>created. Praise be to You equal to the population of Your Arsh. Praise</p>

 <p>Your control. Praise be to You for the things included in Your Book.</p>  
 <p>Praise be to You, persistent, everlasting and endless. Praise so much</p>  
 <p>so, that Your creatures cannot assess it. O Allah! Praise be to You</p>  
 <p>equal to the number of times one might have invoked You and the</p>

 <p>entire realm belongs to You. Within Your control is all good. To You is</p>  
 <p>the return of everything hidden or manifest. Praise be to You on Your</p>  
 <p>trials, on Your favours, whether present or past; particularly those</p>  
 <p>shown towards me by gifting existence and guiding me to the right path</p>  
 <p>for You have created a good creation and gave me the best guidance</p>  
 <p>and You taught and taught me the best. O Allah! Praise be to You for</p>  
 <p>Your testing me by gracious trial and for Your favours shown to me.</p>  
 <p>Many a hardship You have dispelled from me, many a grief You have</p>  
 <p>warded off and many a difficulty You have solved and granted me ease.</p>  
 <p>Praise be to You for Your bounties, some of them I have forgotten, for</p>  
 <p>some I have offered my thanks to You others not even acknowledged by</p>  
 <p>me, some of them have already passed and some still remain. O Allah!</p>  
 <p>Praise be to You equal to the number of times You have granted</p>  
 <p>pardons and salvation and praise be to You the number of times You</p>  
 <p>have given cover to my lapses. Praise be to You as numerous as the</p>  
 <p>number of Your blessings and favours. Praise be to You for setting my</p>  
 <p>affairs in order and for testing us in a gracious manner. O Allah! Praise</p>  
 <p>be to You for You really deserve to be praised and worshipped and</p>  
 <p>thanked, O the best of all those that are Praiseworthy! O the most</p>  
 <p>Merciful!</p>
