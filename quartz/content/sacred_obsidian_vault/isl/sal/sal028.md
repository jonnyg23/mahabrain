 <p>His supplication for the honoured month of</p>  
 <p>Shaban</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny, heed my call</p>  
 <p>whenever I beseech You and be attentive whenever I eulogize You as I</p>  
 <p>have rushed towards You and have presented myself in Your Presence.</p>  
 <p>I am helpless in front of You; I am a complainant in Your court. Present</p>  
 <p>me the rewards, which You have reserved for me and You are well</p>  
 <p>aware of my inner thoughts. You are aware of my needs. You know</p>  
 <p>about the affairs of my heart and nothing is hidden from You, and</p>  
 <p>whatever I wish to say and the thing which I intend to speak (You are</p>  
 <p>fully aware of) You have decreed my destiny. O my Master, You are</p>  
 <p>aware of all the actions, which I will be performing till my last day. Either</p>  
 <p>openly or secretly, no one has any power of it except You. Either it is in</p>  
 <p>excess or in less measure, either in profit or in loss. My Lord if You deny</p>  
 <p>me who is there to sustain me, and if You make me unsuccessful then</p>  
 <p>who is there to support me? My Lord I seek refuge from You in the</p>  
 <p>descent of Your wrath and chastisement. O Allah! Although I am not</p>  
 <p>eligible for Your Mercy You can still shower Your grace on me. O Allah!</p>  
 <p>Wholeheartedly I have presented myself in Your presence which is</p>  
 <p>under the shade of Your forgiveness. O Allah! If You pardon me is there</p>  
 <p>anyone preferable to you? Even if my death has approached, and my</p>  
 <p>deeds have not made me reach Your Presence, thus I have made my</p>  
 <p>acceptance of sins a means of intercession. My Lord! While taking care</p>  
 <p>of my soul I have done injustice on it, and if You do not forgive it would</p>  
 <p>be destroyed. O Allah! Your obligation on me was for the whole life, do</p>  
 <p>not discontinue it after death. Why should I lose hope of it when during</p>  
 <p>my lifetime You have done nothing but goodness with me? My Lord! Be</p>  
 <p>compassionate in my transactions and oblige this sinner who is covered</p>  
 <p>by his ignorance. My Lord You have covered my sins in this world and I</p>  
 <p>require this covering in the hereafter. O Allah You have obliged me by</p>  
 <p>covering my sins from Your pious people and so do not degrade me on</p>  
 <p>the Day of Judgment in front of Your creation. O Allah Your grace has</p>  
 <p>expanded my hopes and Your forgiveness is greater than my deeds. O</p>  
 <p>Allah the day on which You take account of the creatures, put me among</p>  
 <p>good people by Your grace. My Lord! My excuse is like the excuse of a</p>  
 <p>person who does not have any hope of his excuse being accepted. O</p>  
 <p>the Generous of all the generous to Whom all go taking excuses. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! Do not turn down my requests, do not overlook my desires and do</p>  
 <p>not cut down my hopes. O Allah! If You had been unaware of my desires</p>  
 <p>You would have never guided me and if You had decided to degrade</p>  
 <p>me, You would have never saved me. My Lord! I don't feel that You will</p>  
 <p>not accept this supplication for which I have ended up my life. O Allah!</p>  
 <p>Praise is for You always and forever which ever increases and never</p>  
 <p>lessens in the manner You approve of it. O Allah! If You have decided to</p>  
 <p>punish me for my crimes I will not leave You for Your forgiveness and if</p>  
 <p>You have apprehended me for my sins I will not leave You for Your</p>  
 <p>Mercy and if You send me to Hell I will inform the inhabitants of Hell that</p>  
 <p>I loved You. If due to my worship my deeds are low, yet my hopes are</p>  
 <p>high due to hopefulness in You. O my Lord! How can I go hopeless and</p>  
 <p>dejected from Your presence when I was hopeful of Your Generosity</p>  
 <p>that I would return pardoned. O Allah I spent the whole life and my youth</p>  
 <p>forgetting Your presence and being away from You. O Allah! I was</p>  
 <p>arrogant for Your forgiveness and not being aware of treading the path</p>  
 <p>of Your wrath. My Lord! I am Your slave and son of Your slave, present</p>  
 <p>before You and have made Your grace an intercessor before You. My</p>  
 <p>Lord! I am Your slave who has repented for all the sins which he has</p>  
 <p>committed in Your presence after being careless of Your warnings. And I</p>  
 <p>seek forgiveness from You because forgiveness is one of Your</p>  
 <p>characteristics. My Lord! I lack the strength that I follow the same way</p>  
 <p>and save myself from Your wrath, but this happened when Your love</p>  
 <p>made me aware and so I have become as You wished me to be. Now I</p>  
 <p>thank You for entering the door of Your grace and my heart has become</p>  
 <p>pure from the stains of carelessness about You. My Lord, look at me as</p>  
 <p>You look up at those who call upon You, and he whom You have</p>  
 <p>ordered a thing and he has obeyed. O One Who is never away from His</p>  
 <p>servants and O the generous one Who is never miserly in rewarding the</p>  
 <p>good doers. O Allah grant me a heart that brings me nearer to You and a</p>  
 <p>tongue whose truthfulness raises my head in Your presence, and eyes</p>  
 <p>whose sight makes me nearer to You. My Creator! He is not a stranger</p>  
 <p>who has got fame due to You. And who is under Your shelter is never</p>  
 <p>abandoned as upon whom You have put Your generous look he is</p>  
 <p>nobody's slave. O Allah one who is nearer to You is alive at heart and</p>  
 <p>one who is attached to You finds refuge and I have also asked for</p>  
 <p>protection in Your presence. O Allah, my Lord and Master! Do not</p>  
 <p>disappoint the one who has hopes in You and don't drive him away from</p>  
 <p>Your favours. O Allah! Accord me a status which You bestowed upon</p>  
 <p>Your beloved servants. O Allah! Inculcate in me Your love after every</p>  
 <p>remembrance. By Your name, forgive me and make me near the purified</p>  
 <p>ones. My Lord by Your grace it is Your might that You made me reach to</p>  
 <p>the position of Your obedient and pleasing servants, because I don't</p>  
 <p>have the power to uplift my soul. O Lord I am a dependant slave in Your</p>  
 <p>kingdom. I am a repentant and seeking forgiveness. Do not include me</p>  
 <p>among those groups from whom You have turned away and their</p>  
 <p>carelessness has stopped Your forgiveness. O Allah grant me the grace</p>  
 <p>to cut off relations with this world and make me Yours. Grant my heart</p>  
 <p>the light which inclines towards You so much that it reaches to</p>  
 <p>understand Your greatness, and our soul is directed towards You. My</p>  
 <p>Lord put me among those people who have accepted Your message.</p>  
 <p>You have seen them and seeing Your Honour they have lost control of</p>  
 <p>their selves. You have whispered to them and they have performed</p>  
 <p>difficult deeds for You. O Allah! Do not prevail helplessness on my good</p>  
 <p>hopes, and do not cut off my hopes by Your mercy. My Lord if my errors</p>  
 <p>have put me down in Your presence, You overlook it, as I have great</p>  
 <p>trust in You. Although my sins have not made me capable of Your</p>  
 <p>excellent grace, but Your attention has made me bow down. My Lord! If</p>  
 <p>my carelessness has made me negligent of Your meeting then</p>  
 <p>recognizing Your bounties has made me alert. O Allah if Your great</p>  
 <p>chastisement calls me towards Hell Your great rewards invite me</p>  
 <p>towards Paradise. O Allah I ask from You have and hope from You. I</p>  
 <p>have a request, bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny, and</p>  
 <p>include me among those who remember You. Who are never unmindful</p>  
 <p>of thanking You, who never take Your commands for granted. O Allah</p>  
 <p>grant me such a light by which I can gain Your recognition and obey</p>  
 <p>You, be afraid of You, think only of You, O the possessor of Honour and</p>  
 <p>Might! O Allah! Send blessings on Your Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
 <p>and his progeny and grant them abundant peace.</p>
