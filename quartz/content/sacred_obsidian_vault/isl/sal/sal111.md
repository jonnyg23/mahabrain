 <p>His supplication on the eve of Saturday</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O the one Who when forgives, never revenges, have mercy on Your</p>  
 <p>creatures. O Allah! O my beloved have mercy on me. O Lord! Your</p>  
 <p>servant is in Your presence, O Lord! O Lord! For the sake of Your</p>  
 <p>creatures O my hope and wishes O the listener of complaints O the</p>  
 <p>extreme pleasure. O the one to make the blood flow in my veins Your</p>  
 <p>creature and only Your creature is present before You. O My Lord! O</p>  
 <p>the master of the creatures Your servant is present in Your Domain. O</p>  
 <p>the center of hopes! O Master! O He! O He! O He! O Lord! O Lord! I am</p>  
 <p>Your servant there is no one useful for this careless soul, neither gain</p>  
 <p>nor loss is in his control and nor is there anyone who can do goodness</p>  
 <p>to him, I have exhausted all my weapons of cheating, and all the evil has</p>  
 <p>been exposed, now the world has left me isolated for You and so I am</p>  
 <p>standing. O my God You are aware of everything, then how will You</p>  
 <p>treat me. O that I knew! Although I do not know Your reply after listening</p>  
 <p>to my supplication. Will You say 'yes' or 'no' and if You say 'no' then</p>  
 <p>alas! Alas! Alas! I complain, I complain, I complain, oh my misfortune!</p>  
 <p>Unlucky! Wretchedness! Oh Shame! Oh Shame! Oh Shame! Now</p>  
 <p>where shall I go? Why and what for? Or with whom shall I seek refuge</p>  
 <p>and from whom shall I have hopes. Is there anyone who shall have</p>  
 <p>grace upon me by his mercy, when it is You who have left me? O the</p>  
 <p>excessive forgiver. And if You say 'Yes your supplication is accepted'</p>  
 <p>like I believe it, then I am indeed lucky and worth compliments. I</p>  
 <p>congratulate that I deserve mercy O the one Who does mercy O the</p>  
 <p>generous! O the one Who is Attentive! O the Master! O the Powerful! O</p>  
 <p>the one Who overpowers! I don't have a deed which can be a cause for</p>  
 <p>the acceptance of my prayers. I beseech You for the sake of Your</p>  
 <p>names which You have created from everything and is concealed by</p>  
 <p>Your covering and this concealed name is known only to You, I seek of</p>  
 <p>that name of Yours which has never been utilised and will never be</p>  
 <p>utilized. I ask You by Your name and by Yourself, as I don't possess</p>  
 <p>anything other than these. Neither I meet anyone who could get me</p>  
 <p>some benefit from You. O the great and Ancient, O the Honourable! O</p>  
 <p>He Who has made me recognize my own soul. O He Who has granted</p>  
 <p>me, my desires, O the one Who is called! O the one Who is questioned!</p>  
 <p>O the one from whom one seeks the desires. O Allah I have left those</p>  
 <p>commands which You had reminded me, and I did not obey You, and if I</p>  
 <p>had obeyed You then before me being present here You would have</p>  
 <p>appreciated my work. And I in spite of my sins, have hope from You so</p>  
 <p>don't let anything come between You and my hopes and return my</p>  
 <p>hands full of Your grace, safety and goodness. By the sake of Your</p>  
 <p>rights (ask for Your needs) O My store at the times of hardships. O my</p>  
 <p>hope at the time of trials, O my guardian at the time of bounties, O my</p>  
 <p>fulfiller of needs at the time of desires, O my refuge at the time of</p>  
 <p>destruction, O my saver at the time of annihilation, O my companion in</p>  
 <p>solitude, bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and forgive my</p>  
 <p>sins. Ease for me my transactions, bestow on me my spread to unity,</p>  
 <p>success in my aims, reformation of my self, and answer for my</p>  
 <p>supplications, success and solution in all my affairs. Don't take away</p>  
 <p>safety from me when You give me life and when You give me death. O</p>  
 <p>Most Merciful of all the mercifuls.</p>
