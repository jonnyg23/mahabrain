 <p>His supplication for warding off calamities</p>  
 <p>and seeking protection</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! By the means of Your light I wish to hide from my enemies. By</p>  
 <p>Your majesty and grandeur I wish to be hidden from the plans of my foes</p>  
 <p>and by Your Supreme Power I seek refuge from every strength and from</p>  
 <p>every evil power and satans. And O my Lord I seek Your bounties and</p>  
 <p>high rewards, why should I be scared of anyone when my hope is on</p>  
 <p>Allah and why should anyone trouble me when my complete reliance is</p>  
 <p>on You. I have entrusted my life and all my transactions to You. I have</p>  
 <p>relied on You at all times. O Allah bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his</p>  
 <p>pure progeny. And cure me of my troubles and grant me protection and</p>  
 <p>those things, which want to overpower me, make me overpower them, O</p>  
 <p>the One Who is never subdued. Chain the enemy who stares at me,</p>  
 <p>every oppressor who oppresses, every jealous one and every enemy. In</p>  
 <p>the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. Say He is Allah the one;</p>  
 <p>Allah is He on Whom all depend. He begets not, nor is He begotten. And</p>  
 <p>none is like Him. As Allah is our Lord. Allah is sufficient for us and an</p>  
 <p>excellent guardian and a strong protector.</p>
