 <p>His supplication for Friday</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>Praise is for Allah Who is not created by anything nor took any help in</p>  
 <p>creating the creatures; creation of new things is a proof of His eternity.</p>  
 <p>And the way He has pointed out the helplessness among His creatures,</p>  
 <p>points out towards His power and the world is in need of Him proves His</p>  
 <p>eternity. No place is without His presence and the word 'Where' cannot</p>  
 <p>be addressed to Him. Neither He has a replica, nor a similarity to by</p>  
 <p>which He can be praised, neither He is heedless of anything, so that</p>  
 <p>one could comprehend the position of the Creator, different from His</p>  
 <p>attributes and far away from comprehension, by the intellect, as those</p>  
 <p>are imaginable things. He is away from all the misfortunes by His</p>  
 <p>Magnanimity and Greatness. It is prohibited for the intellect to restrict a</p>  
 <p>limit for Allah, and the depth; mentions His conditions. And it is</p>  
 <p>prohibited for the small eyes of nature to imagine about Him. Neither</p>  
 <p>space encloses Him due to His greatness, nor can a quantity be</p>  
 <p>ascertained due to His Magnanimity, nor can imagination comprehend</p>  
 <p>Him. It is prohibited to imagine a portrait of Him by imagination or</p>  
 <p>intellect. The intellects faster than perfection are also helpless in limiting</p>  
 <p>Him. And the oceans of knowledge have dried up in the quest of</p>  
 <p>understanding Him, the debate lovers whose argumentation reaches the</p>  
 <p>zenith, their evidences fall short and returns, and that once is not</p>  
 <p>sufficient, it is always but not restricted to time. It is forever but not</p>  
 <p>without help. Neither He is like man, that can be compared with man, nor</p>  
 <p>He has a face that it can resemble any face. Neither He is a thing which</p>  
 <p>has part. The intellect is lost in the stormy ocean of recognition and the</p>  
 <p>human strength is perplexed at ascertaining the beginning of His</p>  
 <p>Creation, the intelligent man is helpless in understanding the limit of His</p>  
 <p>power and the minds are drowned in the heavenly gust of blast in His</p>  
 <p>territory. He is having power on the bounties due to His Magnificence,</p>  
 <p>He is saved from the force of possibilities, having possession over all</p>  
 <p>the things. Rather time created Him not and no attribute can restrict Him,</p>  
 <p>the agitated necks are low because it is the height of their helplessness</p>  
 <p>and in front of the greatness of His Power, the proofs of cause and</p>  
 <p>effect lie low on this eternity and a proof of Allah due to helplessness</p>  
 <p>and due to His being created a proof that Allah is foremost and due to</p>  
 <p>our annihilation a proof of His Eternity. These facts and the Creation has</p>  
 <p>no respite from His Hold, nor an excuse to escape from the Domain, nor</p>  
 <p>anything hidden due to His knowledge, nor anything to stop from His</p>  
 <p>Greatness, the stability of the creation is a complete proof, the habits of</p>  
 <p>the creatures are the best evidence and the creation of the inherent</p>  
 <p>qualities of ancientness, and its strength is a great lesson about Allah.</p>  
 <p>Now no complete praise can be attributed to Him, nor can be explained</p>  
 <p>with examples. He is far above to be categorised by His signs.</p>  
 <p>Glorification is for Allah Who created the earth for destruction and</p>  
 <p>annihilation and the hereafter for perpetuity and eternity. Pure is Allah</p>  
 <p>for Whom His Bestowals does not straiten Him but becomes a cause for</p>  
 <p>His Majestic, however great, and out of proportions and higher than</p>  
 <p>expectations the bestowals are. Whatever You decide cannot be</p>  
 <p>rejected and Your commands cannot be refused, whatever He bestows,</p>  
 <p>cannot be stopped, neither He chastises immediately, nor He forgets,</p>  
 <p>nor He hastens but gives chance, He forgives, pardons, has mercy and</p>  
 <p>is patient. He will not be questioned for His actions but the creatures will</p>  
 <p>be questioned. There is no Lord except Allah Who cares for His</p>  
 <p>creatures, granting a respite to the polytheists, nearer to the one who</p>  
 <p>invokes but is far away. He is kind and merciful for the one who seeks</p>  
 <p>asylum and refuge. There is no god other than Allah Who responds to</p>  
 <p>the one who invokes Him in solitude and secretly. He listens to the one</p>  
 <p>who discloses His secrets. He is kind to the one who has hopes of</p>  
 <p>averting their sorrows. He comes nearer to those who pray for warding</p>  
 <p>off their sorrow and pain. There is no god except Allah Who is tolerant</p>  
 <p>with the one who does alteration and polytheism with His signs, and</p>  
 <p>turns away from clear proofs and are ready to rebel under all</p>  
 <p>circumstances. Allah is too High, overpowering the opponents,</p>  
 <p>affectionate to the adversaries, and Unique in obliging and bestowing</p>  
 <p>favours on entire mankind, and Allah is Great, who is covered due to His</p>  
 <p>creation and Honour, is incomparable in Majesty and Power and is</p>  
 <p>veiled in greatness and grandeur. And Allah is too Great and High; Who</p>  
 <p>is Pure due to His everlasting Honour, and is overpowering due to His</p>  
 <p>Proofs and Arguments. Whose will always persist. O Allah! Send Your</p>  
 <p>blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny as he is Your slave</p>  
 <p>and Your Messenger, bestow on him a best support, a honourable</p>  
 <p>bestowal, a great reward, a very near place, an auspicious limit and</p>  
 <p>coolness of eyes and satisfaction in abundance. O Allah! Bestow</p>  
 <p>blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny, grant him support</p>  
 <p>and greatness, increase his status, a position which is envied, greatest</p>  
 <p>honour, complete praise, the last limit and the right of achieving</p>  
 <p>nearness to You, so that he is satisfied and then increase this</p>  
 <p>satisfaction manifolds. O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his</p>  
 <p>progeny as You have ordered complete obedience to him, have</p>  
 <p>cleansed him from all impurities and have bestowed purity on them in</p>  
 <p>true sense. O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny on</p>  
 <p>whom You have revealed Your knowledge and have Your book</p>  
 <p>protected through him, and have entrusted the custody of Your</p>  
 <p>creatures to him. O my Lord! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) Your slave</p>  
 <p>and Your messenger and the progeny of Muhammad, who are Your</p>  
 <p>special creatures, and Your beloved and the chief of the first and the</p>  
 <p>last of the Prophet and all the creatures. And send Your blessings on his</p>  
 <p>infallible progeny, whose complete obedience and love You have made</p>  
 <p>obligatory on us. O Allah! Due to Your fear I invoke on You like a fearful</p>  
 <p>person who is afraid of Your wrath, he has taken asylum in You due to</p>  
 <p>Your fear. There is none who can fulfill his needs and grant him asylum</p>  
 <p>nor can provide him a place, obligations and satisfaction other than You.</p>  
 <p>O my master and my chief! Excessive disobedience has diverted my</p>  
 <p>attention to You, although my sins have become a curtain between us</p>  
 <p>(still I present myself) because You are a support for those who rely on</p>  
 <p>You, a hope for those who await You, Your bestowals do not harm You.</p>  
 <p>The invocation of the people does not dry up Your kindness. The great</p>  
 <p>obligations and the great bounties are not insufficient. O the One Whose</p>  
 <p>treasures does not deplete and Whose kingdom will not perish, and</p>  
 <p>vision cannot perceive You, no movement or stagnancy is concealed</p>  
 <p>from You, from its inception till its conclusion, whether its in the depth of</p>  
 <p>earth or height of the skies, or the far off limits cannot be an impediment</p>  
 <p>for You. O the Sustainer! You have taken the responsibility of</p>  
 <p>distributing sustenance. You are pure so as to attribute qualities to You.</p>  
 <p>You are too High that tongues can limit or set a boundary to You.</p>  
 <p>Neither You are an invented thing so that Your development stages can</p>  
 <p>be witnessed. O the subduer from the beginning till the end. O the</p>  
 <p>Bestower of bounties in abundance. O the giver of complete bounties</p>  
 <p>and O the one to pardon the lapse of the tongue and forgive the action</p>  
 <p>of unjust. You possess the Power to forgive the people abundantly. O</p>  
 <p>my God! Your creature is praising You, and relies on You in trials. He</p>  
 <p>reserves all the admiration, and greatness is exclusively for You</p>  
 <p>because You are a permanent and perpetual Lord. You have made it</p>  
 <p>firm by the invention of times the second time or Yourself accept such a</p>  
 <p>state that the rules of praise may be applied there or that Your being</p>  
 <p>should accept such a state that Your deniers may Praise You due to the</p>  
 <p>change of state. Or some increase or decrease so that it can be</p>  
 <p>discussed, or the thoughts of the people gather at a place to define You</p>  
 <p>or nature comes as an example in their intellect by which their power of</p>  
 <p>understanding and insight is deviated. O my Lord! The whole creation is</p>  
 <p>obedient to You after accepting Your Lordship, heads are in prostration.</p>  
 <p>You are pure, how high is Your fame and how dignified is Your status,</p>  
 <p>how true are Your arguments and Your command prevails. Your limits</p>  
 <p>are beautiful. When You raised the sky it became a shade and when</p>  
 <p>You laid the earth it became a carpet, then You grew beneficial herbs</p>  
 <p>and vegetables from it, the vegetables also glorify You, and the water</p>  
 <p>flows at Your command; both the orders are as per Your commands. O</p>  
 <p>One Who is Powerful since the existence of creatures and is</p>  
 <p>overpowering upon their morality save my honour, as this is the best</p>  
 <p>way to ward off the sorrow. O He Who is a ray of hope in all the</p>  
 <p>troubles, and in all easiness the place of desire. Today I have brought</p>  
 <p>my wishes to You and I supplicate to You humbly, thus don't make me</p>  
 <p>unsuccessful in whatever I have asked from You, and don't turn down</p>  
 <p>my prayers, as You have opened the door and I have asked You from it.</p>  
 <p>Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and His progeny turn my fear into valour,</p>  
 <p>conceal my defects, grant me abundance sustenance by Your vast</p>  
 <p>grace and a complete safety and protection. O Allah! Let the best of my</p>  
 <p>day be the one when I meet You, forgive my sins as You have made me</p>  
 <p>fearful. You overlook my sins, else I will be destroyed as You are the</p>  
 <p>one Who hears, one Who accepts, one Who protects, one Who is near,</p>  
 <p>one possessing power, forgiver of sins, the domineering, the Merciful,</p>  
 <p>the self-existing, and it is easy for You to accept the supplications, You</p>  
 <p>are the best of the creators. O Allah! You have made rights of my</p>  
 <p>parents incumbent on me, have bestowed them honour, and You are the</p>  
 <p>one Who brings down the burden in the best way and make it light, and</p>  
 <p>pay of the rights of Your debased creatures, and whatever rights of my</p>  
 <p>parents is incumbent on me that You fulfill it, forgive both of them, in</p>  
 <p>such a way as one desires, and with them forgive every believing man</p>  
 <p>and woman and count us among the people of goodness, place us and</p>  
 <p>them with pious people in heaven, because surely You accept the</p>  
 <p>supplication excessively, are near and accept the prayer of whom You</p>  
 <p>desire, O Allah! Bless our chief Muhammad Mustafa (s.a.w.a.) and his</p>  
 <p>progeny bestow Your Mercy on them and protect them with a great</p>  
 <p>protection.</p>
