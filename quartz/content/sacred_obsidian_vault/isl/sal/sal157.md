 <p>His supplication for Sunday</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>Praise is for Allah for His tolerance and His giving respite and Praise is</p>  
 <p>for Allah and I am certain that my sins are great but in front of Your</p>  
 <p>forgiveness, it is insignificant. And Glorification is for Him Who has</p>  
 <p>erected the skies without any pillars and created Heavens without any</p>  
 <p>passage of time and created the creatures from the rear and without any</p>  
 <p>support. And there is no Lord except Allah Who frightens those who</p>  
 <p>disobey and exceed the limits and scares those who are firm on</p>  
 <p>disobedience and arrogant on worship and as He is aware of the evil</p>  
 <p>consequence He has deputed His Proof. Thus He accepts the excuses</p>  
 <p>of those who are strayed in their ignorance and deviation. And Allah is</p>  
 <p>Great, He is Generous and Merciful. Whose unlimited favours and</p>  
 <p>excessive Mercy has no limits which He has bestowed on His Creatures</p>  
 <p>nor is there any boundary for the power which He has on the Creatures.</p>  
 <p>O Allah bestow such blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his</p>  
 <p>progeny as You had bestowed on Ibrahim and the progeny of Ibrahim.</p>  
 <p>Indeed You deserve the praise and magnanimity. O Allah I call upon You</p>  
 <p>like a sinner whose sins have destroyed him by narrowing his path and</p>  
 <p>there is no hope and respite except You, nor anyone more merciful than</p>  
 <p>You to listen to his complaints, nor a support better than You. You send</p>  
 <p>the bounties even before the commencement of merit, and have</p>  
 <p>bestowed favours on those who were not entitled for it. Neither</p>  
 <p>miserliness makes You rich or strong nor the question of those who</p>  
 <p>beseech You decreases Your Munificence. You have taken the</p>  
 <p>responsibility of sustaining the creatures so that You can bestow Your</p>  
 <p>Grace and Mercy upon them. O Allah! Prayers fall short in praising You</p>  
 <p>and tongues become dumb while enumerating Your favours. O Lord! I</p>  
 <p>have come in Your presence with a firm determination, although my sins</p>  
 <p>has engulfed me but You are the most Benevolent the most Honoured,</p>  
 <p>the most Generous among all, the best sustainer, the greatest Creator,</p>  
 <p>the First, the Last, the Apparent, the Concealed, the Most Honourable,</p>  
 <p>the most Kind. You are too great to refuse those whose hopes are</p>  
 <p>pinned on You, O the One Who deserves the praise, all the praise is for</p>  
 <p>You, O my Lord, if I have been negligent in being attentive to my soul</p>  
 <p>and have spent the days of my life in disobedience, still You are the</p>  
 <p>Lord of Bestowals, Possessor of Majesty, and Grandeur. Still Your</p>  
 <p>attention remains on this soul. Now make this soul successful in Your</p>  
 <p>Presence because You are the only Bestower, the Benefactor,</p>  
 <p>Possessor of Generosity, O the One to illuminate the dawn, Grant the</p>  
 <p>favours of this heart although it does not deserve. O the excessive</p>  
 <p>forgiver, O Allah I beseech You by those names which moulds the</p>  
 <p>destiny, by Your Honour which complete the actions, bless Muhammad</p>  
 <p>(s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and grant me pure and vast sustenance. O</p>  
 <p>the Beneficent and Merciful don't let any barrier come between You and</p>  
 <p>me. Grant me the position of those whom You have elevated their status</p>  
 <p>and have made Your approval forgiveness very common. O my Lord!</p>  
 <p>You have blessed Your representative with Your signs (miracles) and</p>  
 <p>have made Your protection necessary for them, and in order to save</p>  
 <p>them from destruction You have put them under Your care. I am also</p>  
 <p>Your insignificant creature, grant me salvation and protection and make</p>  
 <p>me attentive towards Your obedience. And Your Grace to make me</p>  
 <p>curtail disobedience because tongue speaks in various language,</p>  
 <p>tongues speak out and are fulfilling their desire, I have put my hopes to</p>  
 <p>ask for my needs and have hopes of erasing my defects because You</p>  
 <p>are fully aware of concealed things.</p>
