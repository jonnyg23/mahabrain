 <h1 align="CENTER">2. al-Baqarah: The Cow</h1>
 <a name="an_002_001">1</a> Alif. Lam. Mim. 
 <a name="an_002_002">2</a> This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt, a guidance unto those who  ward off (evil). 
 <a name="an_002_003">3</a> Who believe in the Unseen, and establish worship, and spend of that We  have bestowed upon them; 
 <a name="an_002_004">4</a> And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) and that  which was revealed before thee, and are certain of the Hereafter. 
 <a name="an_002_005">5</a> These depend on guidance from their Lord. These are the successful. 
 <a name="an_002_006">6</a> As for the Disbelievers, Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is  all one for them; they believe not. 
 <a name="an_002_007">7</a> Allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts, and on their eyes there is a  covering. Theirs will be an awful doom. 
 <a name="an_002_008">8</a> And of mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day,  when they believe not. 
 <a name="an_002_009">9</a> They think to beguile Allah and those who believe, and they beguile none  save themselves; but they perceive not. 
 <a name="an_002_010">10</a> In their hearts is a disease, and Allah increaseth their disease. A painful  doom is theirs because they lie. 
 <a name="an_002_011">11</a> And when it is said unto them: Make not mischief in the earth, they say: We  are peacemakers only. 
 <a name="an_002_012">12</a> Are not they indeed the mischief-makers ? But they perceive not. 
 <a name="an_002_013">13</a> And when it is said unto them: believe as the people believe, they say: shall  we believe as the foolish believe ? are not they indeed the foolish ? But they know  not. 
 <a name="an_002_014">14</a> And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe; but  when they go apart to their devils they declare: Lo! we are with you; verily we did but  mock. 
 <a name="an_002_015">15</a> Allah (Himself) doth mock them, leaving them to wander blindly on in their  contumacy. 
 <a name="an_002_016">16</a> These are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, so their  commerce doth not prosper, neither are they guided. 
 <a name="an_002_017">17</a> Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire, and when it  sheddeth its light around him Allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in  darkness, where they cannot see, 
 <a name="an_002_018">18</a> Deaf, dumb and blind; and they return not. 
 <a name="an_002_019">19</a> Or like a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder and the flash  of lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears by reason of the thunder-claps, for  fear of death, Allah encompasseth the disbelievers (in His guidance, His omniscience  and His omnipotence). 
 <a name="an_002_020">20</a> The lightning almost snatcheth away their sight from them. As often as it  flasheth forth for them they walk therein, and when it darkeneth against them they  stand still. If Allah willed, He could destroy their hearing and their sight. Lo! Allah is  able to do all things. 
 <a name="an_002_021">21</a> O mankind! worship your Lord, Who hath created you and those before you,  so that ye may ward off (evil). 
 <a name="an_002_022">22</a> Who hath appointed the earth a resting-place for you, and the sky a canopy;  and causeth water to pour down from the sky, thereby producing fruits as food for  you. And do not set up rivals to Allah when ye know (better). 
 <a name="an_002_023">23</a> And if ye are in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto Our slave  (Muhammad), then produce a surah of the like thereof, and call your witness beside  Allah if ye are truthful. 
 <a name="an_002_024">24</a> And if ye do it not - and ye can never do it - then guard yourselves against  the Fire prepared for disbelievers, whose fuel is of men and stones. 
 <a name="an_002_025">25</a> And give glad tidings (O Muhammad) unto those who believe and do good  works; that theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow; as often as they are  regaled with food of the fruit thereof, they say: this is what was given us aforetime;  and it is given to them in resemblance. There for them are pure companions; there for  ever  they abide. 
 <a name="an_002_026">26</a> Lo! Allah disdaineth not to coin the similitude even of a gnat. Those who  believe know that it is the truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve say: What  doth Allah wish (to teach) by such a similitude ? He misleadeth many thereby, and He  guideth many thereby; and He misleadeth thereby only miscreants; 
 <a name="an_002_027">27</a> Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever that  which Allah ordered to be joined, and (who) make mischief in the earth: Those are  they who are the losers. 
 <a name="an_002_028">28</a> How disbelieve ye in Allah when ye were dead and He gave life to you!  Then He will give you death, then life again, and then unto Him ye will return. 
 <a name="an_002_029">29</a> He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth. Then turned He to the  heaven, and fashioned it as seven heavens. And He is knower of all things. 
 <a name="an_002_030">30</a> And when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am about to place a viceroy in  the earth, they said: Wilt thou place therein one who will do harm therein and will  shed blood, while we, we hymn Thy praise and sanctify Thee ? He said: Surely I  know that which ye know not. 
 <a name="an_002_031">31</a> And He taught Adam all the names, then showed them to the angels, saying:  Inform Me of the names of these, if ye are truthful. 
 <a name="an_002_032">32</a> They said: Be glorified! We have no knowledge saving that which Thou hast  taught us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower, the Wise. 
 <a name="an_002_033">33</a> He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names, and when he had informed  them of their names, He said: Did I not tell you that I know the secret of the heavens  and the earth ? And I know that which ye disclose and which ye hide. 
 <a name="an_002_034">34</a> And when We said unto the angels: Prostrate yourselves before Adam, they  fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He demurred through pride, and so became a disbeliever. 
 <a name="an_002_035">35</a> And We said: O Adam! Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat ye  freely (of the fruits) thereof where ye will; but come not nigh this tree lest ye become  wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_002_036">36</a> But Satan caused them to deflect therefrom and expelled them from the  (happy) state in which they were; and We said: Fall down, one of you a foe unto the  other! There shall be for you on earth a habitation and provision for a time. 
 <a name="an_002_037">37</a> Then Adam received from his Lord words (of revelation), and He relented  toward him. Lo! He is the relenting, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_002_038">38</a> We said: Go down, all of you, from hence; but verily there cometh unto you  from Me a guidance; and whoso followeth My guidance, there shall no fear come  upon them neither shall they grieve. 
 <a name="an_002_039">39</a> But they who disbelieve, and deny Our revelations, such are rightful Peoples  of the Fire. They will abide therein. 
 <a name="an_002_040">40</a> O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you, and  fulfil your (part of the) covenant, I shall fulfil My (part of the) covenant, and fear Me. 
 <a name="an_002_041">41</a> And believe in that which I reveal, confirming that which ye possess already  (of the Scripture), and be not first to disbelieve therein, and part not with My  revelations for a trifling price, and keep your duty unto Me. 
 <a name="an_002_042">42</a> Confound not truth with falsehood, nor knowingly conceal the truth. 
 <a name="an_002_043">43</a> Establish worship, pay the poor-due, and bow your heads with those who  bow (in worship). 
 <a name="an_002_044">44</a> Enjoin ye righteousness upon mankind while ye yourselves forget (to  practise it) ? And ye are readers of the Scripture! Have ye then no sense ? 
 <a name="an_002_045">45</a> Seek help in patience and prayer; and truly it is hard save for the humble- minded, 
 <a name="an_002_046">46</a> Who know that they will have to meet their Lord, and that unto Him they are  returning. 
 <a name="an_002_047">47</a> O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and  how I preferred you to (all) creatures. 
 <a name="an_002_048">48</a> And guard yourselves against a day when no soul will in aught avail another,  nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be received from it,  nor will they be helped. 
 <a name="an_002_049">49</a> And (remember) when We did deliver you from Pharaoh's folk, who were  afflicting you with dreadful torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women: that  was a tremendous trial from your Lord. 
 <a name="an_002_050">50</a> And when We brought you through the sea and rescued you, and drowned  the folk of Pharaoh in your sight. 
 <a name="an_002_051">51</a> And when We did appoint for Moses forty nights (of solitude), and then ye  chose the calf, when he had gone from you, and were wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_002_052">52</a> Then, even after that, We pardoned you in order that ye might give thanks. 
 <a name="an_002_053">53</a> And when We gave unto Moses the Scripture and the criterion (of right and  wrong), that ye might be led aright. 
 <a name="an_002_054">54</a> And when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Ye have wronged  yourselves by your choosing of the calf (for worship) so turn in penitence to your  Creator, and kill (the guilty) yourselves. That will be best for you with your Creator  and He will relent toward you. Lo! He is the Relenting, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_002_055">55</a> And when ye said: O Moses! We will not believe in thee till we see Allah  plainly; and even while ye gazed the lightning seized you. 
 <a name="an_002_056">56</a> Then We revived you after your extinction, that ye might give thanks. 
 <a name="an_002_057">57</a> And We caused the white cloud to overshadow you and sent down on you  the manna and the quails, (saying): Eat of the good things wherewith We have  provided you - they wronged Us not, but they did wrong themselves. 
 <a name="an_002_058">58</a> And when We said: Go into this township and eat freely of that which is  therein, and enter the gate prostrate, and say: "Repentance." We will forgive you your  sins and will increase (reward) for the right-doers. 
 <a name="an_002_059">59</a> But those who did wrong changed the word which had been told them for  another saying, and We sent down upon the evil-doers wrath from heaven for their  evil-doing. 
 <a name="an_002_060">60</a> And when Moses asked for water for his people, We said: Smite with thy  staff the rock. And there gushed out therefrom twelve springs (so that) each tribe  knew their drinking-place. Eat and drink of that which Allah hath provided, and do  not act corruptly, making mischief in the earth. 
 <a name="an_002_061">61</a> And when ye said: O Moses! We are weary of one kind of food; so call upon  thy Lord for us that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth - of its herbs  and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its onions. He said: Would ye  exchange that which is higher for that which is lower ? Go down to settled country,  thus ye shall get that which ye demand. And humiliation and wretchedness were  stamped upon them and they were visited with wrath from Allah. That was because  they disbelieved in Allah's revelations and slew the prophets wrongfully. That was for  their disobedience and transgression. 
 <a name="an_002_062">62</a> Lo! Those who believe (in that which is revealed unto thee, Muhammad),  and those who are Jews, and Christians, and Sabaeans - whoever believeth in Allah  and the Last Day and doeth right - surely their reward is with their Lord, and there  shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. 
 <a name="an_002_063">63</a> And (remember, O Children of Israel) when We made a covenant with you  and caused the mount to tower above you, (saying): Hold fast that which We have  given you, and remember that which is therein, that ye may ward off (evil). 
 <a name="an_002_064">64</a> Then, even after that, ye turned away, and if it had not been for the grace of  Allah and His mercy ye had been among the losers. 
 <a name="an_002_065">65</a> And ye know of those of you who broke the Sabbath, how We said unto  them: Be ye apes, despised and hated! 
 <a name="an_002_066">66</a> And We made it an example to their own and to succeeding generations, and  an admonition to the God-fearing. 
 <a name="an_002_067">67</a> And when Moses said unto his people: Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye  sacrifice a cow, they said: Dost thou make game of us ? He answered: Allah forbid  that I should be among the foolish! 
 <a name="an_002_068">68</a> They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what (cow) she  is. (Moses) answered: Lo! He saith, Verily she is a cow neither with calf nor  immature; (she is) between the two conditions; so do that which ye are commanded. 
 <a name="an_002_069">69</a> They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us of what colour  she is. (Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a yellow cow. Bright is her  colour, gladdening beholders. 
 <a name="an_002_070">70</a> They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what (cow) she  is. Lo! cows are much alike to us; and Lo! if Allah wills, we may be led aright. 
 <a name="an_002_071">71</a> (Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a cow unyoked; she plougheth  not the soil nor watereth the tilth; whole and without mark. They said: Now thou  bringest the truth. So they sacrificed her, though almost they did not. 
 <a name="an_002_072">72</a> And (remember) when ye slew a man and disagreed concerning it and Allah  brought forth that which ye were hiding. 
 <a name="an_002_073">73</a> And We said: Smite him with some of it. Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life  and showeth you His portents so that ye may understand. 
 <a name="an_002_074">74</a> Then, even after that, your hearts were hardened and became as rocks, or  worse than rocks, for hardness. For indeed there are rocks from out which rivers gush,  and indeed there are rocks which split asunder so that water floweth from them. And  indeed there are rocks which fall down for the fear of Allah. Allah is not unaware of  what ye do. 
 <a name="an_002_075">75</a> Have ye any hope that they will be true to you when a party of them used to  listen to the word of Allah, then used to change it, after they had understood it,  knowingly ? 
 <a name="an_002_076">76</a> And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe. But  when they go apart one with another they say: Prate ye to them of that which Allah  hath disclosed to you that they may contend with you before your Lord concerning it  ? Have ye then no sense ? 
 <a name="an_002_077">77</a> Are they then unaware that Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and  that which they proclaim ? 
 <a name="an_002_078">78</a> Among them are unlettered folk who know the Scripture not except from  hearsay. They but guess. 
 <a name="an_002_079">79</a> Therefore woe be unto those who write the Scripture with their hands and  then say, "This is from Allah," that they may purchase a small gain therewith. Woe  unto them for that their hands have written, and woe unto them for that they earn  thereby. 
 <a name="an_002_080">80</a> And they say: The Fire  (of punishment) will not touch us save for a certain  number of days. Say: Have ye received a covenant from Allah - truly Allah will not  break His covenant - or tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not ? 
 <a name="an_002_081">81</a> Nay, but whosoever hath done evil and his sin surroundeth him; such are  rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein. 
 <a name="an_002_082">82</a> And those who believe and do good works: such are rightful owners of the  Garden. They will abide therein. 
 <a name="an_002_083">83</a> And (remember) when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel,  (saying): Worship none save Allah (only), and be good to parents and to kindred and  to orphans and the needy, and speak kindly to mankind; and establish worship and  pay the poor-due. Then, after that, ye slid back, save a few of you, being averse. 
 <a name="an_002_084">84</a> And when We made with you a covenant (saying): Shed not the blood of  your people nor turn (a party of) your people out of your dwellings. Then ye ratified  (Our covenant) and ye were witnesses (thereto). 
 <a name="an_002_085">85</a> Yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out a party of your people from  their homes, supporting one another against them by sin and transgression ? - and if  they came to you as captives ye would ransom them, whereas their expulsion was  itself unlawful for you - Believe ye in part of the Scripture and disbelieve ye in part  thereof ? And what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the  world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous  doom. For Allah is not unaware of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_002_086">86</a> Such are those who buy the life of the world at the price of the Hereafter.  Their punishment will not be lightened, neither will they have support. 
 <a name="an_002_087">87</a> And verily We gave unto Moses the Scripture and We caused a train of  messengers to follow after him, and We gave unto Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs (of  Allah's sovereignty), and We supported him with the Holy spirit. Is it ever so, that,  when there cometh unto you a messenger (from Allah) with that which ye yourselves  desire not, ye grow arrogant, and some ye disbelieve and some ye slay ? 
 <a name="an_002_088">88</a> And they say: Our hearts are hardened. Nay, but Allah hath cursed them for  their unbelief. Little is that which they believe. 
 <a name="an_002_089">89</a> And when there cometh unto them a scripture from Allah, confirming that in  their possession - though before that they were asking for a signal triumph over those  who disbelieved - and when there cometh unto them that which they know (to be the  truth) they disbelieve therein. The curse of Allah is on disbelievers. 
 <a name="an_002_090">90</a> Evil is that for which they sell their souls: that they should disbelieve in that  which Allah hath revealed, grudging that Allah should reveal of His bounty unto  whom He will of His slaves.  They have incurred anger upon anger.  For disbelievers  is a shameful doom. 
 <a name="an_002_091">91</a> And when it is said unto them: Believe in that which Allah hath revealed,  they say: We believe in that which was revealed unto us. And they disbelieve in that  which cometh after it, though it is the truth confirming that which they possess. Say  (unto them, O Muhammad): Why then slew ye the prophets of Allah aforetime, if ye  are (indeed) believers ? 
 <a name="an_002_092">92</a> And Moses came unto you with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty), yet,  while he was away, ye chose the calf (for worship) and ye were wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_002_093">93</a> And when We made with you a covenant and caused the Mount to tower  above you, (saying): Hold fast by that which We have given you, and hear (Our  Word), they said: We hear and we rebel. And (worship of) the calf was made to sink  into their hearts because of their rejection (of the covenant). Say (unto them): Evil is  that which your belief enjoineth on you, if ye are believers. 
 <a name="an_002_094">94</a> Say (unto them): If the abode of the Hereafter in the providence of Allah is  indeed for you alone and not for others of mankind (as ye pretend), then long for  death (for ye must long for death) if ye are truthful. 
 <a name="an_002_095">95</a> But they will never long for it, because of that which their own hands have  sent before them. Allah is aware of evil-doers. 
 <a name="an_002_096">96</a> And thou wilt find them greediest of mankind for life and (greedier) than the  idolaters. (Each) one of them would like to be allowed to live a thousand years. And  to live (a thousand years) would be no means remove him from the doom. Allah is  Seer of what they do. 
 <a name="an_002_097">97</a> Say (O Muhammad, to mankind): Who is an enemy to Gabriel! For he it is  who hath revealed (this Scripture) to thy heart by Allah's leave, confirming that which  was (revealed) before it, and a guidance and glad tidings to believers; 
 <a name="an_002_098">98</a> Who is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and His messengers, and Gabriel  and Michael! Then, lo! Allah (Himself) is an enemy to the disbelievers. 
 <a name="an_002_099">99</a> Verily We have revealed unto thee clear tokens, and only miscreants will  disbelieve in them. 
 <a name="an_002_100">100</a> Is it ever so that when they make a covenant a party of them set it aside ?  The truth is, most of them believe not. 
 <a name="an_002_101">101</a> And when there cometh unto them a messenger from Allah, confirming that  which they possess, a party of those who have received the Scripture fling the  Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they knew not, 
 <a name="an_002_102">102</a> And follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of  Solomon. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved, teaching mankind  magic and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Harut and Marut. Nor  did they (the two angels) teach it to anyone till they had said: We are only a  temptation, therefore disbelieve not (in the guidance of Allah). And from these two  (angles) people learn that by which they cause division between man and wife; but  they injure thereby no-one save by Allah's leave. And they learn that which harmeth  them and profiteth them not. And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein  will have no (happy) portion in the Hereafter; and surely evil is the price for which  they sell their souls, if they but knew. 
 <a name="an_002_103">103</a> And if they had believed and kept from evil, a recompense from Allah would  be better, if they only knew. 
 <a name="an_002_104">104</a> O ye who believe, say not (unto the Prophet): "Listen to us" but say "Look  upon us," and be ye listeners. For disbelievers is a painful doom. 
 <a name="an_002_105">105</a> Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture nor the  idolaters love that there should be sent down unto you any good thing from your  Lord. But Allah chooseth for His mercy whom He will, and Allah is of Infinite  Bounty. 
 <a name="an_002_106">106</a> Nothing of our revelation (even a single verse) do we abrogate or cause be  forgotten, but we bring (in place) one better or the like thereof. Knowest thou not that  Allah is Able to do all things ? 
 <a name="an_002_107">107</a> Knowest thou not that it is Allah unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of  the heavens and the earth; and ye have not, beside Allah, any guardian or helper ? 
 <a name="an_002_108">108</a> Or would ye question your messenger as Moses was questioned aforetime ?  He who chooseth disbelief instead of faith, verily he hath gone astray from a plain  road. 
 <a name="an_002_109">109</a> Many of the people of the Scripture long to make you disbelievers after your  belief, through envy on their own account, after the truth hath become manifest unto  them. Forgive and be indulgent (toward them) until Allah give command. Lo! Allah is  Able to do all things. 
 <a name="an_002_110">110</a> Establish worship, and pay the poor-due; and whatever of good ye send  before (you) for your souls, ye will find it with Allah. Lo! Allah is Seer of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_002_111">111</a> And they say: None entereth paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.  These are their own desires. Say: Bring your proof (of what ye state) if ye are truthful. 
 <a name="an_002_112">112</a> Nay, but whosoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good, his  reward is with his Lord; and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they  grieve. 
 <a name="an_002_113">113</a> And the Jews say the Christians follow nothing (true), and the Christians say  the Jews follow nothing (true); yet both are readers of the Scripture. Even thus speak  those who know not. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection  concerning that wherein they differ. 
 <a name="an_002_114">114</a> And who doth greater wrong than he who forbiddeth the approach to the  sanctuaries of Allah lest His name should be mentioned therein, and striveth for their  ruin. As for such, it was never meant that they should enter them except in fear.  Theirs in the world is ignominy and theirs in the Hereafter is an awful doom. 
 <a name="an_002_115">115</a> Unto Allah belong the East and the West, and whithersoever ye turn, there is  Allah's Countenance. Lo! Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. 
 <a name="an_002_116">116</a> And they say: Allah hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He glorified! Nay, but  whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth is His. All are subservient unto Him. 
 <a name="an_002_117">117</a> The Originator of the heavens and the earth! When He decreeth a thing, He  saith unto it only: Be! and it is. 
 <a name="an_002_118">118</a> And those who have no knowledge say: Why doth not Allah speak unto us,  or some sign come unto us ? Even thus, as they now speak, spake those (who were)  before them. Their hearts are all alike. We have made clear the revelations for people  who are sure. 
 <a name="an_002_119">119</a> Lo! We have sent thee (O Muhammad) with the truth, a bringer of glad  tidings and a warner. And thou wilt not be asked about the owners of hell-fire. 
 <a name="an_002_120">120</a> And the Jews will not be pleased with thee, nor will the Christians, till thou  follow their creed. Say: Lo! the guidance of Allah (Himself) is Guidance. And if thou  shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, then  wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting guardian nor helper. 
 <a name="an_002_121">121</a> Those unto whom We have given the Scripture, who read it with the right  reading, those believe in it. And whoso disbelieveth in it, those are they who are the  losers. 
 <a name="an_002_122">122</a> O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and  how I preferred you to (all) creatures. 
 <a name="an_002_123">123</a> And guard (yourselves) against a day when no soul will in aught avail  another, nor will compensation be accepted from it, nor will intercession be of use to  it; nor will they be helped. 
 <a name="an_002_124">124</a> And (remember) when his Lord tried Abraham with (His) commands, and he  fulfilled them, He said: Lo! I have appointed thee a leader for mankind. (Abraham)  said: And of my offspring (will there be leaders) ? He said: My covenant includeth  not wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_002_125">125</a> And when We made the House (at Makka) a resort for mankind and  sanctuary, (saying): Take as your place of worship the place where Abraham stood (to  pray). And We imposed a duty upon Abraham and Ishmael, (saying): Purify My  house for those who go around and those who meditate therein and those who bow  down and prostrate themselves (in worship). 
 <a name="an_002_126">126</a> And when Abraham prayed: My Lord! Make this a region of security and  bestow upon its people fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day, He  answered: As for him who disbelieveth, I shall leave him in contentment for a while,  then I shall compel him to the doom of Fire - a hapless journey's end! 
 <a name="an_002_127">127</a> And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House,  (Abraham prayed): Our Lord! Accept from us (this duty). Lo! Thou, only Thou, art  the Hearer, the Knower. 
 <a name="an_002_128">128</a> Our Lord! And make us submissive unto Thee and of our seed a nation  submissive unto Thee, and show us our ways of worship, and relent toward us. Lo!  Thou, only Thou, art the Relenting, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_002_129">129</a> Our Lord! And raise up in their midst a messenger from among them who  shall recite unto them Thy revelations, and shall instruct them in the Scripture and in  wisdom and shall make them grow. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, Wise. 
 <a name="an_002_130">130</a> And who forsaketh the religion of Abraham save him who befooleth himself  ? Verily We chose him in the world, and lo! in the Hereafter he is among the  righteous. 
 <a name="an_002_131">131</a> When his Lord said unto him: Surrender! he said: I have surrendered to the  Lord of the Worlds. 
 <a name="an_002_132">132</a> The same did Abraham enjoin upon his sons, and also Jacob, (saying): O my  sons! Lo! Allah hath chosen for you the (true) religion; therefore die not save as men  who have surrendered (unto Him). 
 <a name="an_002_133">133</a> Or were ye present when death came to Jacob, when he said unto his sons:  What will ye worship after me ? They said: We shall worship thy God, the God of thy  fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, One God, and unto Him we have  surrendered. 
 <a name="an_002_134">134</a> Those are a people who have passed away. Theirs is that which they earned,  and yours is that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what they used to do. 
 <a name="an_002_135">135</a> And they say: Be Jews or Christians, then ye will be rightly guided. Say  (unto them, O Muhammad): Nay, but (we follow) the religion of Abraham, the  upright, and he was not of the idolaters. 
 <a name="an_002_136">136</a> Say (O Muslims): We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and  that which was revealed unto Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the  tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and that which the prophets received  from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have  surrendered. 
 <a name="an_002_137">137</a> And if they believe in the like of that which ye believe, then are they rightly  guided. But if they turn away, then are they in schism, and Allah will suffice thee (for  defence) against them. He is the Hearer, the Knower. 
 <a name="an_002_138">138</a> (We take our) colour from Allah, and who is better than Allah at colouring.  We are His worshippers. 
 <a name="an_002_139">139</a> Say (unto the People of the Scripture): Dispute ye with us concerning Allah  when He is our Lord and your Lord ? Ours are our works and yours your works. We  look to Him alone. 
 <a name="an_002_140">140</a> Or say ye that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes  were Jews or Christians ? Say: Do ye know best, or doth Allah ? And who is more  unjust than he who hideth a testimony which he hath received from Allah ? Allah is  not unaware of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_002_141">141</a> Those are a people who have passed away; theirs is that which they earned  and yours that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what they used to do. 
 <a name="an_002_142">142</a> The foolish of the people will say: What hath turned them from the qiblah  which they formerly observed ? Say: Unto Allah belong the East and the West. He  guideth whom He will unto a straight path. 
 <a name="an_002_143">143</a> Thus We have appointed you a middle nation, that ye may be witnesses  against mankind, and that the messenger may be a witness against you. And We  appointed the qiblah which ye formerly observed only that We might know him who  followeth the messenger, from him who turneth on his heels. In truth it was a hard  (test) save for those whom Allah guided. But it was not Allah's purpose that your faith  should be in vain, for Allah is Full of Pity, Merciful toward mankind. 
 <a name="an_002_144">144</a> We have seen the turning of thy face to heaven (for guidance, O  Muhammad). And now verily We shall make thee turn (in prayer) toward a qiblah  which is dear to thee. So turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye  (O Muslims), wheresoever ye may be, turn your faces (when ye pray) toward it. Lo!  Those who have received the Scripture know that (this revelation) is the Truth from  their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do. 
 <a name="an_002_145">145</a> And even if thou broughtest unto those who have received the Scripture all  kinds of portents, they would not follow thy qiblah, nor canst thou be a follower of  their qiblah; nor are some of them followers of the qiblah of others. And if thou  shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, then  surely wert thou of the evil-doers. 
 <a name="an_002_146">146</a> Those unto whom We gave the Scripture recognise (this revelation) as they  recognise their sons. But lo! a party of them knowingly conceal the truth. 
 <a name="an_002_147">147</a> It is the Truth from thy Lord (O Muhammad), so be not thou of those who  waver. 
 <a name="an_002_148">148</a> And each one hath a goal toward which he turneth; so vie with one another in  good works. Wheresoever ye may be, Allah will bring you all together. Lo! Allah is  Able to do all things. 
 <a name="an_002_149">149</a> And whencesoever thou comest forth (for prayer, O Muhammad) turn thy  face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship. Lo! it is the Truth from thy Lord. Allah  is not unaware of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_002_150">150</a> Whencesoever thou comest forth turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of  Worship; and wheresoever ye may be (O Muslims) turn your faces toward it (when ye  pray) so that men may have no argument against you, save such of them as do  injustice - Fear them not, but fear Me! - and so that I may complete My grace upon  you, and that ye may be guided. 
 <a name="an_002_151">151</a> Even as We have sent unto you a messenger from among you, who reciteth  unto you Our revelations and causeth you to grow, and teacheth you the Scripture and  wisdom, and teacheth you that which ye knew not. 
 <a name="an_002_152">152</a> Therefore remember Me, I will remember you. Give thanks to Me, and reject  not Me. 
 <a name="an_002_153">153</a> O ye who believe! Seek help in steadfastness and prayer. Lo! Allah is with  the steadfast. 
 <a name="an_002_154">154</a> And call not those who are slain in the way of Allah "dead." Nay, they are  living, only ye perceive not. 
 <a name="an_002_155">155</a> And surely We shall try you with something of fear and hunger, and loss of  wealth and lives and crops; but give glad tidings to the steadfast, 
 <a name="an_002_156">156</a> Who say, when a misfortune striketh them: Lo! we are Allah's and lo! unto  Him we are returning. 
 <a name="an_002_157">157</a> Such are they on whom are blessings from their Lord, and mercy. Such are  the rightly guided. 
 <a name="an_002_158">158</a> Lo! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwah are among the indications of  Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who is on pilgrimage to the House (of God) or  visiteth it, to go around them (as the pagan custom is). And he who doeth good of his  own accord, (for him) lo! Allah is Responsive, Aware. 
 <a name="an_002_159">159</a> Lo! Those who hide the proofs and the guidance which We revealed, after  We had made it clear to mankind in the Scripture: such are accursed of Allah and  accursed of those who have the power to curse. 
 <a name="an_002_160">160</a> Except those who repent and amend and make manifest (the truth). These it  is toward whom I relent. I am the Relenting, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_002_161">161</a> Lo! Those who disbelieve, and die while they are disbelievers; on them is the  curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined. 
 <a name="an_002_162">162</a> They ever dwell therein. The doom will not be lightened for them, neither  will they be reprieved. 
 <a name="an_002_163">163</a> Your God is One God; there is no God save Him, the Beneficent, the  Merciful. 
 <a name="an_002_164">164</a> Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of night  and day, and the ships which run upon the sea with that which is of use to men, and  the water which Allah sendeth down from the sky, thereby reviving the earth after its  death, and dispersing all kinds of beasts therein, and (in) the ordinance of the winds,  and the clouds obedient between heaven and earth: are signs (of Allah's Sovereignty)  for people who have sense. 
 <a name="an_002_165">165</a> Yet of mankind are some who take unto themselves (objects of worship  which they set as) rivals to Allah, loving them with a love like (that which is the due)  of Allah (only) - those who believe are stauncher in their love for Allah - Oh, that  those who do evil had but known, (on the day) when they behold the doom, that  power belongeth wholly to Allah, and that Allah is severe in punishment! 
 <a name="an_002_166">166</a> (On the day) when those who were followed disown those who followed  (them), and they behold the doom, and all their aims collapse with them. 
 <a name="an_002_167">167</a> And those who were but followers will say: If a return were possible for us,  we would disown them even as they have disowned us. Thus will Allah show them  their own deeds as anguish for them, and they will not emerge from the Fire. 
 <a name="an_002_168">168</a> O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and wholesome in the earth, and  follow not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! he is an open enemy for you. 
 <a name="an_002_169">169</a> He enjoineth upon you only the evil and the foul, and that ye should tell  concerning Allah that which ye know not. 
 <a name="an_002_170">170</a> And when it is said unto them: Follow that which Allah hath revealed, they  say: We follow that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even though their fathers  were wholly unintelligent  and had no guidance ? 
 <a name="an_002_171">171</a> The likeness of those who disbelieve (in relation to the messenger) is as the  likeness of one who calleth unto that which heareth naught except a shout and cry.  Deaf, dumb, blind, therefore they have no sense. 
 <a name="an_002_172">172</a> O ye who believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you,  and render thanks to Allah if it is (indeed) He Whom ye worship. 
 <a name="an_002_173">173</a> He hath forbidden you only carrion, and blood, and swineflesh, and that  which hath been immolated to (the name of) any other than Allah. But he who is  driven by necessity, neither craving nor transgressing, it is no sin for him. Lo! Allah  is Forgiving, Merciful. 
 <a name="an_002_174">174</a> Lo! those who hide aught of the Scripture which Allah hath revealed  and  purchase a small gain therewith, they eat into their bellies nothing else than fire. Allah  will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow.  Theirs will be a painful doom. 
 <a name="an_002_175">175</a> Those are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, and torment at  the price of pardon. How constant are they in their strife to reach the Fire! 
 <a name="an_002_176">176</a> That is because Allah hath revealed the Scripture with the truth. Lo! those  who find (a cause of) disagreement in the Scripture are in open schism. 
 <a name="an_002_177">177</a> It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces to the East and the West; but  righteous is he who believeth in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the  Scripture and the prophets; and giveth wealth, for love of Him, to kinsfolk and to  orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and to those who ask, and to set slaves free;  and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor-due. And those who keep their  treaty when they make one, and the patient in tribulation and adversity and time of  stress. Such are they who are sincere. Such are the God-fearing. 
 <a name="an_002_178">178</a> O ye who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the  murdered; the freeman for the freeman, and the slave for the slave, and the female for  the female. And for him who is forgiven somewhat by his (injured) brother,  prosecution according to usage and payment unto him in kindness. This is an  alleviation and a mercy from your Lord. He who transgresseth after this will have a  painful doom. 
 <a name="an_002_179">179</a> And there is life for you in retaliation, O men of understanding, that ye may  ward off (evil). 
 <a name="an_002_180">180</a> It is prescribed for you, when death approacheth one of you, if he leave  wealth, that he bequeath unto parents and near relatives in kindness. (This is) a duty  for all those who ward off (evil). 
 <a name="an_002_181">181</a> And whoso changeth (the will) after he hath heard it - the sin thereof is only  upon those who change it. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
 <a name="an_002_182">182</a> But he who feareth from a testator some unjust or sinful clause, and maketh  peace between the parties, (it shall be) no sin for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving,  Merciful. 
 <a name="an_002_183">183</a> O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you, even as it was prescribed for  those before you, that ye may ward off (evil); 
 <a name="an_002_184">184</a> (Fast) a certain number of days; and (for) him who is sick among you, or on  a journey, (the same) number of other days; and for those who can afford it there is a  ransom: the feeding of a man in need - but whoso doeth good of his own accord, it is  better for him: and that ye fast is better for you if ye did but know - 
 <a name="an_002_185">185</a> The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for  mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance, and the Criterion (of right and wrong).  And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month, and whosoever of you is  sick or on a journey, (let him fast the same) number of other days. Allah desireth for  you ease; He desireth not hardship for you; and (He desireth) that ye should complete  the period, and that ye should magnify Allah for having guided you, and that  peradventure ye may be thankful. 
 <a name="an_002_186">186</a> And when My servants question thee concerning Me, then surely I am nigh. I  answer the prayer of the suppliant when he crieth unto Me. So let them hear My call  and let them trust in Me, in order that they may be led aright. 
 <a name="an_002_187">187</a> It is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of the fast.  They are raiment for you and ye are raiment for them. Allah is Aware that ye were  deceiving yourselves in this respect and He hath turned in mercy toward you and  relieved you. So hold intercourse with them and seek that which Allah hath ordained  for you, and eat and drink until the white thread becometh distinct to you from the  black thread of the dawn. Then strictly observe the fast till nightfall and touch them  not, but be at your devotions in the mosques. These are the limits imposed by Allah,  so approach them not. Thus Allah expoundeth His revelation to mankind that they  may ward off (evil). 
 <a name="an_002_188">188</a> And eat not up your property among yourselves in vanity, nor seek by it to  gain the hearing of the judges that ye may knowingly devour a portion of the property  of others wrongfully. 
 <a name="an_002_189">189</a> They ask thee, (O Muhammad), of new moons, say: They are fixed seasons  for mankind and for the pilgrimage. It is not righteousness that ye go to houses by the  backs thereof (as do the idolaters at certain seasons), but the righteous man is he who  wardeth off (evil). So go to houses by the gates thereof, and observe your duty to  Allah, that ye may be successful. 
 <a name="an_002_190">190</a> Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but begin not  hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors. 
 <a name="an_002_191">191</a> And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places  whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. And fight not  with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first attack you there, but if  they attack you (there) then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers. 
 <a name="an_002_192">192</a> But if they desist, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
 <a name="an_002_193">193</a> And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah. But if  they desist, then let there be no hostility except against wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_002_194">194</a> The forbidden month for the forbidden month, and forbidden things in  retaliation. And one who attacketh you, attack him in like manner as he attacked you.  Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is with those who ward off (evil). 
 <a name="an_002_195">195</a> Spend your wealth for the cause of Allah, and be not cast by your own hands  to ruin; and do good. Lo! Allah loveth the beneficent. 
 <a name="an_002_196">196</a> Perform the pilgrimage and the visit (to Makka) for Allah. And if ye are  prevented, then send such gifts as can be obtained with ease, and shave not your  heads until the gifts have reached their destination. And whoever among you is sick  or hath an ailment of the head must pay a ransom of fasting or almsgiving or offering.  And if ye are in safety, then whosoever contenteth himself with the visit for the  pilgrimage (shall give) such gifts as can be had with ease. And whosoever cannot find  (such gifts), then a fast of three days while on the pilgrimage, and of seven when ye  have returned; that is, ten in all. That is for him whoso folk are not present at the  Inviolable Place of Worship. Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is  severe in punishment. 
 <a name="an_002_197">197</a> The pilgrimage is (in) the well-known months, and whoever is minded to  perform the pilgrimage therein (let him remember that) there is (to be) no lewdness  nor abuse nor angry conversation on the pilgrimage. And whatsoever good ye do  Allah knoweth it. So  make provision for yourselves (Hereafter); for the best  provision is to ward off evil. Therefore keep your duty unto Me, O men of  understanding. 
 <a name="an_002_198">198</a> It is no sin for you that ye seek the bounty of your Lord (by trading). But,  when ye press on in the multitude from 'Arafat, remember Allah by the sacred  monument. Remember Him as He hath guided you, although before ye were of those  astray. 
 <a name="an_002_199">199</a> Then hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hasteneth onward,  and ask forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
 <a name="an_002_200">200</a> And when ye have completed your devotions, then remember Allah as ye  remember your fathers or with a more lively remembrance. But of mankind is he who  saith: "Our Lord! Give unto us in the world," and he hath no portion in the Hereafter. 
 <a name="an_002_201">201</a> And of them (also) is he who saith: "Our Lord! Give unto us in the world that  which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and guard us from the doom of  Fire." 
 <a name="an_002_202">202</a> For them there is in store a goodly portion out of that which they have  earned. Allah is swift at reckoning. 
 <a name="an_002_203">203</a> Remember Allah through the appointed days. Then whoso hasteneth (his  departure) by two days, it is no sin for him, and whoso delayeth, it is no sin for him;  that is for him who wardeth off (evil). Be careful of your duty to Allah, and know that  unto Him ye will be gathered. 
 <a name="an_002_204">204</a> And of mankind there is he whoso conversation on the life of this world  pleaseth thee (Muhammad), and he calleth Allah to witness as to that which is in his  heart; yet he is the most rigid of opponents. 
 <a name="an_002_205">205</a> And when he turneth away (from thee) his effort in the land is to make  mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle; and Allah loveth not mischief. 
 <a name="an_002_206">206</a> And when it is said unto him: Be careful of thy duty to Allah, pride taketh  him to sin. Hell will settle his account, an evil resting-place. 
 <a name="an_002_207">207</a> And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah;  and Allah hath compassion on (His) bondmen. 
 <a name="an_002_208">208</a> O ye who believe! Come, all of you, into submission (unto Him); and follow  not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! he is an open enemy for you. 
 <a name="an_002_209">209</a> And if ye slide back after the clear proofs have come unto you, then know  that Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
 <a name="an_002_210">210</a> Wait they for naught else than that Allah should come unto them in the  shadows of the clouds with the angels ? Then the case would be already judged. All  cases go back to Allah (for judgment). 
 <a name="an_002_211">211</a> Ask of the Children of Israel how many a clear revelation We gave them! He  who altereth the grace of Allah after it hath come unto him (for him), lo! Allah is  severe in punishment. 
 <a name="an_002_212">212</a> Beautified is the life of the world for those who disbelieve; they make a jest  of the believers. But those who keep their duty to Allah will be above them on the  Day of Resurrection. Allah giveth without stint to whom He will. 
 <a name="an_002_213">213</a> Mankind were one community, and Allah sent (unto them) prophets as  bearers of good tidings and as warners, and revealed therewith the Scripture with the  truth that it might judge between mankind concerning that wherein they differed. And  only those unto whom (the Scripture) was given differed concerning it, after clear  proofs had come unto them, through hatred one of another. And Allah by His Will  guided those who believe unto the truth of that concerning which they differed. Allah  guideth whom He will unto a straight path. 
 <a name="an_002_214">214</a> Or think ye that ye will enter paradise while yet there hath not come unto you  the like of (that which came to) those who passed away before you ? Affliction and  adversity befell them, they were shaken as with earthquake, till the messenger (of  Allah) and those who believed along with him said: When cometh Allah's help ? Now  surely Allah's help is nigh. 
 <a name="an_002_215">215</a> They ask thee, (O Muhammad), what they shall spend. Say: that which ye  spend for good (must go) to parents and near kindred and orphans and the needy and  the wayfarer. And whatsoever good ye do, lo! Allah is Aware of it. 
 <a name="an_002_216">216</a> Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you; but it may happen  that ye hate a thing which is good for you, and it may happen that ye love a thing  which is bad for you. Allah knoweth, ye know not. 
 <a name="an_002_217">217</a> They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred  month. Say: Warfare therein is a great (transgression), but to turn (men) from the way  of Allah, and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship, and to  expel His people thence, is a greater with Allah; for persecution is worse than killing.  And they will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades  from your religion, if they can. And whoso becometh a renegade and dieth in his  disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen both in the world and the Hereafter.  Such are rightful owners of the Fire: they will abide therein. 
 <a name="an_002_218">218</a> Lo! those who believe, and those who emigrate (to escape the persecution)  and strive in the way of Allah, these have hope of Allah's mercy. Allah is Forgiving,  Merciful. 
 <a name="an_002_219">219</a> They question thee about strong drink and games of chance. Say: In both is  great sin, and (some) utility for men; but the sin of them is greater than their  usefulness. And they ask thee what they ought to spend. Say: that which is  superfluous. Thus Allah maketh plain to you (His) revelations, that haply ye may  reflect. 
 <a name="an_002_220">220</a> Upon the world and the Hereafter. And they question thee concerning  orphans. Say: To improve their lot is best. And if ye mingle your affairs with theirs,  then (they are) your brothers. Allah knoweth him who spoileth from him who  improveth. Had Allah willed He could have overburdened you. Allah is Mighty,  Wise. 
 <a name="an_002_221">221</a> Wed not idolatresses till they believe; for lo! a believing bondwoman is  better than an idolatress though she please you; and give not your daughters in  marriage to idolaters till they believe, for lo! a believing slave is better than an  idolater though he please you. These invite unto the Fire, and Allah inviteth unto the  Garden, and unto forgiveness by His grace, and expoundeth His revelations to  mankind that haply they may remember. 
 <a name="an_002_222">222</a> They question thee (O Muhammad) concerning menstruation. Say: It is an  illness, so let women alone at such times and go not in unto them till they are  cleansed. And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah  hath enjoined upon you. Truly Allah loveth those who turn unto Him, and loveth  those who have a care for cleanness. 
 <a name="an_002_223">223</a> Your women are a tilth for you (to cultivate) so go to your tilth as ye will,  and send (good deeds) before you for your souls, and fear Allah, and know that ye  will (one day) meet Him. Give glad tidings to believers, (O Muhammad). 
 <a name="an_002_224">224</a> And make not Allah, by your oaths, a hindrance to your being righteous and  observing your duty unto Him and making peace among mankind. Allah is Hearer,  Knower. 
 <a name="an_002_225">225</a> Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional  in your oaths.  But He will take you to task for that which your hearts have garnered. Allah is  Forgiving, Clement. 
 <a name="an_002_226">226</a> Those who forswear their wives must wait four months; then, if they change  their mind, lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
 <a name="an_002_227">227</a> And if they decide upon divorce (let them remember that) Allah is Hearer,  Knower. 
 <a name="an_002_228">228</a> Women who are divorced shall wait, keeping themselves apart, three  (monthly) courses. And it is not lawful for them that they should conceal that which  Allah hath created in their wombs if they are believers in Allah and the Last Day. And  their husbands would do better to take them back in that case if they desire a  reconciliation. And they (women) have rights similar to those (of men) over them in  kindness, and men are a degree above them. Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
 <a name="an_002_229">229</a> Divorce must be pronounced twice and then (a woman) must be retained in  honour or released in kindness. And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women  aught of that which ye have given them; except (in the case) when both fear that they  may not be able to keep within the limits (imposed by) Allah. And if ye fear that they  may not be able to keep the limits of Allah, in that case it is no sin for either of them  if the woman ransom herself. These are the limits (imposed by) Allah. Transgress  them not. For whoso transgresseth Allah's limits: such are wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_002_230">230</a> And if he hath divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him  thereafter until she hath wedded another husband. Then if he (the other husband)  divorce her it is no sin for both of them that they come together again if they consider  that they are able to observe the limits of Allah. These are the limits of Allah. He  manifesteth them for people who have knowledge. 
 <a name="an_002_231">231</a> When ye have divorced women, and they have reached their term, then retain  them in kindness or release them in kindness. Retain them not to their hurt so that ye  transgress (the limits). He who doeth that hath wronged his soul. Make not the  revelations of Allah a laughing-stock (by your behaviour), but remember Allah's  grace upon you and that which He hath revealed unto you of the Scripture and of  wisdom, whereby He doth exhort you. Observe your duty to Allah and know that  Allah is Aware of all things. 
 <a name="an_002_232">232</a> And when ye have divorced women and they reach their term, place not  difficulties in the way of their marrying their husbands if it is agreed between them in  kindness. This is an admonition for him among you who believeth in Allah and the  Last Day. That is more virtuous for you, and cleaner. Allah knoweth; ye know not. 
 <a name="an_002_233">233</a> Mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years; (that is) for those  who wish to complete the suckling. The duty of feeding and clothing nursing mothers  in a seemly manner is upon the father of the child. No-one should be charged beyond  his capacity. A mother should not be made to suffer because of her child, nor should  he to whom the child is born (be made to suffer) because of his child. And on the  (father's) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father). If  they desire to wean the child by mutual consent and (after) consultation, it is no sin  for them; and if ye wish to give your children out to nurse, it is no sin for you, provide  that ye pay what is due from you in kindness. Observe your duty to Allah, and know  that Allah is Seer of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_002_234">234</a> Such of you as die and leave behind them wives, they (the wives) shall wait,  keeping themselves apart, four months and ten days. And when they reach the term  (prescribed for them) then there is no sin for you in aught that they may do with  themselves in decency. Allah is informed of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_002_235">235</a> There is no sin for you in that which ye proclaim or hide in your minds  concerning your troth with women. Allah knoweth that ye will remember them. But  plight not your troth with women except by uttering a recognised form of words. And  do not consummate the marriage until (the term) prescribed is run. Know that Allah  knoweth what is in your minds, so beware of Him; and know that Allah is Forgiving,  Clement. 
 <a name="an_002_236">236</a> It is no sin for you if ye divorce women while yet ye have not touched them,  nor appointed unto them a portion. Provide for them, the rich according to his means,  and the straitened according to his means, a fair provision. (This is) a bounden duty  for those who do good. 
 <a name="an_002_237">237</a> If ye divorce them before ye have touched them and ye have appointed unto  them a portion, then (pay the) half of that which ye appointed, unless they (the  women) agree to forgo it, or he agreeth to forgo it in whose hand is the marriage tie.  To forgo is nearer to piety. And forget not kindness among yourselves. Allah is Seer  of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_002_238">238</a> Be guardians of your prayers, and of the midmost prayer, and stand up with  devotion to Allah. 
 <a name="an_002_239">239</a> And if ye go in fear, then (pray) standing or on horseback. And when ye are  again in safety, remember Allah, as He hath taught you that which (heretofore) ye  knew not. 
 <a name="an_002_240">240</a> (In the case of) those of you who are about to die and leave behind them  wives, they should bequeath unto their wives a provision for the year without turning  them out, but if they go out (of their own accord) there is no sin for you in that which  they do of themselves within their rights. Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
 <a name="an_002_241">241</a> For divorced women a provision in kindness: a duty for those who ward off  (evil). 
 <a name="an_002_242">242</a> Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations so that ye may understand. 
 <a name="an_002_243">243</a> Bethink thee (O Muhammad) of those of old, who went forth from their  habitations in their thousands, fearing death, and Allah said unto them: Die; and then  He brought them back to life. Lo! Allah is a Lord of Kindness to mankind, but most  of mankind give not thanks. 
 <a name="an_002_244">244</a> Fight in the way of Allah, and know that Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
 <a name="an_002_245">245</a> Who is it that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan, so that He may give it  increase manifold ? Allah straiteneth and enlargeth. Unto Him ye will return. 
 <a name="an_002_246">246</a> Bethink thee of the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses, how they  said unto a prophet whom they had: Set up for us a king and we will fight in Allah's  way. He said: Would ye then refrain from fighting if fighting were prescribed for you  ? They said: Why should we not fight in Allah's way when we have been driven from  our dwellings with our children ? Yet, when fighting was prescribed for them, they  turned away, all save a few of them. Allah is aware of evil-doers. 
 <a name="an_002_247">247</a> Their Prophet said unto them: Lo! Allah hath raised up Saul to be a king for  you. They said: How can he have kingdom over us when we are more deserving of  the kingdom than he is, since he hath not been given wealth enough ? He said: Lo!  Allah hath chosen him above you, and hath increased him abundantly in wisdom and  stature. Allah bestoweth His Sovereignty on whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing,  All-Knowing. 
 <a name="an_002_248">248</a> And their Prophet said unto them: Lo! the token of his kingdom is that there  shall come unto you the ark wherein is peace of reassurance from your Lord, and a  remnant of that which the house of Moses and the house of Aaron left behind, the  angels bearing it. Lo! herein shall be a token for you if (in truth) ye are believers. 
 <a name="an_002_249">249</a> And when Saul set out with the army, he said: Lo! Allah will try you by (the  ordeal of) a river. Whosoever therefore drinketh thereof he is not of me, and  whosoever tasteth it not he is of me, save him who taketh (thereof) in the hollow of  his hand. But they drank thereof, all save a few of them. And after he had crossed (the  river), he and those who believed with him, they said: We have no power this day  against Goliath and his hosts. But those who knew that they would meet Allah  exclaimed: How many a little company hath overcome a mighty host by Allah's  leave! Allah is with the steadfast. 
 <a name="an_002_250">250</a> And when they went into the field against Goliath and his hosts they said:  Our Lord! Bestow on us endurance, make our foothold sure, and give us help against  the disbelieving folk. 
 <a name="an_002_251">251</a> So they routed them by Allah's leave and David slew Goliath; and Allah gave  him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him of that which He willeth. And if Allah  had not repelled some men by others the earth would have been corrupted. But Allah  is a Lord of Kindness to (His) creatures. 
 <a name="an_002_252">252</a> These are the portents of Allah which We recite unto thee (Muhammad) with  truth, and lo! thou art of the number of (Our) messengers; 
 <a name="an_002_253">253</a> Of those messengers, some of whom We have caused to excel others, and of  whom there are some unto whom Allah spake, while some of them He exalted (above  others) in degree; and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs (of Allah's  Sovereignty) and We supported him with the holy Spirit. And if Allah had so wiled it,  those who followed after them would not have fought one with another after the clear  proofs had come unto them. But they differed, some of them believing and some  disbelieving. And if Allah had so willed it, they would not have fought one with  another; but Allah doeth what He will. 
 <a name="an_002_254">254</a> O ye who believe! spend of that wherewith We have provided you ere a day  come when there will be no trafficking, nor friendship, nor intercession. The  disbelievers, they are the wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_002_255">255</a> Allah! There is no God save Him, the Alive, the Eternal. Neither slumber nor  sleep overtaketh Him. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and  whatsoever is in the earth. Who is he that intercedeth with Him save by His leave ?  He knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them, while they  encompass nothing of His knowledge save what He will. His throne includeth the  heavens and the earth, and He is never weary of preserving them. He is the Sublime,  the Tremendous. 
 <a name="an_002_256">256</a> There is no compulsion in religion. The right direction is henceforth distinct  from error. And he who rejecteth false deities and believeth in Allah hath grasped a  firm handhold which will never break. Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
 <a name="an_002_257">257</a> Allah is the Protecting Guardian of those who believe. He bringeth them out  of darkness into light. As for those who disbelieve, their patrons are false deities.  They bring them out of light into darkness. Such are rightful owners of the Fire. They  will abide therein. 
 <a name="an_002_258">258</a> Bethink thee of him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord,  because Allah had given him the kingdom; how, when Abraham said: My Lord is He  Who giveth life and causeth death, he answered: I give life and cause death. Abraham  said: Lo! Allah causeth the sun to rise in the East, so do thou cause it to come up from  the West. Thus was the disbeliever abashed. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. 
 <a name="an_002_259">259</a> Or (bethink thee of) the like of him who, passing by a township which had  fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this township life after its  death ? And Allah made him die a hundred years, then brought him back to life. He  said: How long hast thou tarried ? (The man) said: I have tarried a day or part of a  day. (He) said: Nay, but thou hast tarried for a hundred years. Just look at thy food  and drink which have not rotted! Look at thine ass! And, that We may make thee a  token unto mankind, look at the bones, how We adjust them and then cover them with  flesh! And when (the matter) became clear unto him, he said: I know now that Allah  is Able to do all things. 
 <a name="an_002_260">260</a> And when Abraham said (unto his Lord): My Lord! Show me how Thou  givest life to the dead, He said: Dost thou not believe ? Abraham said: Yea, but (I ask)  in order that my heart may be at ease. (His Lord) said: Take four of the birds and  cause them to incline unto thee, then place a part of them on each hill, then call them,  they will come to thee in haste, and know that Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
 <a name="an_002_261">261</a> The likeness of those who spend their wealth in Allah's way is as the likeness  of a grain which groweth seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains. Allah giveth  increase manifold to whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. 
 <a name="an_002_262">262</a> Those who spend their wealth for the cause of Allah and afterward make not  reproach and injury to follow that which they have spent; their reward is with their  Lord, and there shall no fear come upon them, neither shall they grieve. 
 <a name="an_002_263">263</a> A kind word with forgiveness is better than almsgiving followed by injury.  Allah is Absolute, Clement. 
 <a name="an_002_264">264</a> O ye who believe! Render not vain your almsgiving by reproach and injury,  like him who spendeth his wealth only to be seen of men and believeth not in Allah  and the Last Day. His likeness is as the likeness of a rock whereon is dust of earth; a  rainstorm smiteth it, leaving it smooth and bare. They have no control of aught of that  which they have gained. Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk. 
 <a name="an_002_265">265</a> And the likeness of those who spend their wealth in search of Allah's  pleasure, and for the strengthening of their souls, is as the likeness of a garden on a  height. The rainstorm smiteth it and it bringeth forth its fruit twofold. And if the  rainstorm smite it not, then the shower. Allah is Seer of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_002_266">266</a> Would any of you like to have a garden of palm-trees and vines, with rivers  flowing underneath it, with all kinds of fruit for him therein; and old age hath stricken  him and he hath feeble offspring; and a fiery whirlwind striketh it and it is (all)  consumed by fire. Thus Allah maketh plain His revelations unto you, in order that ye  may give thought. 
 <a name="an_002_267">267</a> O ye who believe! Spend of the good things which ye have earned, and of  that which We bring forth from the earth for you, and seek not the bad (with intent) to  spend thereof (in charity) when ye would not take it for yourselves save with disdain;  and know that Allah is Absolute, Owner of Praise. 
 <a name="an_002_268">268</a> The devil promiseth you destitution and enjoineth on you lewdness. But  Allah promiseth you forgiveness from Himself with bounty. Allah is All-Embracing,  All-knowing. 
 <a name="an_002_269">269</a> He giveth wisdom unto whom He will, and he unto whom wisdom is given,  he truly hath received abundant good. But none remember except men of  understanding. 
 <a name="an_002_270">270</a> Whatever alms ye spend or vow ye vow, lo! Allah knoweth it. Wrong-doers  have no helpers. 
 <a name="an_002_271">271</a> If ye publish your almsgiving, it is well, but if ye hide it and give it to the  poor, it will be better for you, and will atone for some of your ill-deeds. Allah is  Informed of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_002_272">272</a> The guiding of them is not thy duty (O Muhammad), but Allah guideth  whom He will. And whatsoever good thing ye spend, it is for yourselves, when ye  spend not save in search of Allah's Countenance; and whatsoever good thing ye  spend, it will be repaid to you in full, and ye will not be wronged. 
 <a name="an_002_273">273</a> (Alms are) for the poor who are straitened for the cause of Allah, who cannot  travel in the land (for trade). The unthinking man accounteth them wealthy because of  their restraint. Thou shalt know them by their mark: They do not beg of men with  importunity. And whatsoever good thing ye spend, lo! Allah knoweth it. 
 <a name="an_002_274">274</a> Those who spend their wealth by night and day, by stealth and openly, verily  their reward is with their Lord, and their shall no fear come upon them neither shall  they grieve. 
 <a name="an_002_275">275</a> Those who swallow usury cannot rise up save as he ariseth whom the devil  hath prostrated by (his) touch. That is because they say: Trade is just like usury;  whereas Allah permitteth trading and forbiddeth usury. He unto whom an admonition  from his Lord cometh, and (he) refraineth (in obedience thereto), he shall keep (the  profits of) that which is past, and his affair (henceforth) is with Allah. As for him who  returneth (to usury) - Such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide therein. 
 <a name="an_002_276">276</a> Allah hath blighted usury and made almsgiving fruitful. Allah loveth not the  impious and guilty. 
 <a name="an_002_277">277</a> Lo! those who believe and do good works and establish worship and pay the  poor-due, their reward is with their Lord and there shall no fear come upon them  neither shall they grieve. 
 <a name="an_002_278">278</a> O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah, and give up what remaineth  (due to you) from usury, if ye are (in truth) believers. 
 <a name="an_002_279">279</a> And if ye do not, then be warned of war (against you) from Allah and His  messenger. And if ye repent, then ye have your principal (without interest). Wrong  not, and ye shall not be wronged. 
 <a name="an_002_280">280</a> And if the debtor is in straitened circumstances, then (let there be)  postponement to (the time of) ease; and that ye remit the debt as almsgiving would be  better for you if ye did but know. 
 <a name="an_002_281">281</a> And guard yourselves against a day in which ye will be brought back to  Allah. Then every soul will be paid in full that which it hath earned, and they will not  be wronged. 
 <a name="an_002_282">282</a> O ye who believe! When ye contract a debt for a fixed term, record it in writing. Let a scribe record it in writing between you in (terms of) equity. No scribe should refuse to write as Allah hath taught him, so let him write, and let him who incurreth the debt dictate, and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord, and diminish naught thereof. But if he who oweth the debt is of low understanding, or weak, or unable himself to dictate, then let the guardian of his interests dictate in (terms of) equity. And call to witness, from among your men, two witnesses. And if two men be not (at hand) then a man and two women, of such as ye approve as witnesses, so that if the one erreth (through forgetfulness) the other will remember. And the witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. Be not averse to writing down (the contract) whether it be small or great, with (record of) the term thereof. That is more equitable in the sight of Allah and more sure for testimony, and the best way of avoiding doubt b tween you; save only in the case when it is actual merchandise which ye transfer among yourselves from hand to hand. In that case it is no sin for you if ye write it not. And have witnesses when ye sell one to another, and let no harm be done to scribe or witness. If ye do (harm to them) lo! it is a sin in you. Observe your duty to Allah. Allah is teaching you. And Allah is knower of all things. 
 <a name="an_002_283">283</a> If ye be on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a pledge in hand (shall  suffice). And if one of you entrusteth to another let him who is trusted deliver up that  which is entrusted to him (according to the pact between them) and let him observe  his duty to Allah his Lord. Hide not testimony. He who hideth it, verily his heart is  sinful. Allah is Aware of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_002_284">284</a> Unto Allah (belongeth) whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the  earth; and whether ye make known what is in your minds or hide it, Allah will bring  you to account for it. He will forgive whom He will and He will punish whom He  will. Allah is Able to do all things. 
 <a name="an_002_285">285</a> The messenger believeth in that which hath been revealed unto him from his  Lord and (so do) believers. Each one believeth in Allah and His angels and His  scriptures and His messengers - We make no distinction between any of His  messengers - and they say: We hear, and we obey. (Grant us) Thy forgiveness, our  Lord. Unto Thee is the journeying. 
 <a name="an_002_286">286</a> Allah tasketh not a soul beyond its scope. For it (is only) that which it hath  earned, and against it (only) that which it hath deserved. Our Lord! Condemn us not if  we forget, or miss the mark! Our Lord! Lay not on us such a burden as thou didst lay  on those before us! Our Lord! Impose not on us that which we have not the strength  to bear! Pardon us, absolve us and have mercy on us, Thou, our Protector, and give us  victory over the disbelieving folk.
