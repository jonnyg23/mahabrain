 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:319</h3><p><i>Narrated Zainab bint Abi Salama:</i></p>
 Um-Salama said, "I got my menses while I was lying with the Prophet 
 under a woolen sheet. So I slipped away, took the clothes for menses 
 and put them on. Allah's Apostle said, 'Have you got your menses?' I 
 replied, 'Yes.' Then he called me and took me with him under the 
 woolen sheet." Um Salama further said, "The Prophet used to kiss me 
 while he was fasting. The Prophet and I used to take the bath of 
 Janaba from a single pot."
