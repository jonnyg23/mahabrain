 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:161</h3><p><i>Narrated Humran:</i></p>
 (the slave of 'Uthman) I saw 'Uthman bin 'Affan asking for a tumbler 
 of water (and when it was brought) he poured water over his hands and 
 washed them thrice and then put his right hand in the water container 
 and rinsed his mouth, washed his nose by putting water in it and then 
 blowing it out. then he washed his face and forearrlns up to the 
 elbows thrice, passed his wet hands over his head and washed his feet 
 up to the ankles thrice. Then he said, "Allah's Apostle said 'If 
 anyone Performs ablution like that of mine and offers a two-rak'at 
 prayer during which he does not think of anything else (not related to
 the present prayer) then his past sins will be forgiven.' " After 
 performing the ablution 'Uthman said, "I am going to tell you a Hadith
 which I would not have told you, had I not been compelled by a certain
 Holy Verse (the sub narrator 'Urwa said: This verse is: "Verily, those
 who conceal the clear signs and the guidance which we have sent 
 down...)" (2:159). I heard the Prophet saying, 'If a man performs 
 ablution perfectly and then offers the compulsory congregational 
 prayer, Allah will forgive his sins committed between that (prayer) 
 and the (next) prayer till he offers it.
