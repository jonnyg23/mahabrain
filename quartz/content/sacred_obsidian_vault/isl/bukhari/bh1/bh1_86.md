 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:87</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Jamra:</i></p>
 I was an interpreter between the people and Ibn 'Abbas. Once Ibn 
 'Abbas said that a delegation of the tribe of'Abdul Qais came to the 
 Prophet who asked them, "Who are the people (i.e. you)? (Or) who are 
 the delegates?" They replied, "We are from the tribe of Rabi'a." Then 
 the Prophet said to them, "Welcome, O people (or said, "O delegation 
 (of 'Abdul Qais).") Neither will you have disgrace nor will you 
 regret." They said, "We have come to you from a distant place and 
 there is the tribe of the infidels of Mudar intervening between you 
 and us and we cannot come to you except in the sacred month. So please
 order us to do something good (religious deeds) and that we may also 
 inform our people whom we have left behind (at home) and that we may 
 enter Paradise (by acting on them.)" The Prophet ordered them to do 
 four things, and forbade them from four things. He ordered them to 
 believe in Allah Alone, the Honorable the Majestic and said to them, 
 "Do you know what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?" They replied,
 "Allah and His Apostle know better." Thereupon the Prophet said, 
 "(That means to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but 
 Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle, to offer prayers perfectly, to
 pay Zakat, to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan, (and) to pay 
 Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Allah's cause)." Then
 he forbade them four things, namely Ad-Dubba.' Hantam, Muzaffat (and) 
 An-Naqir or Muqaiyar(These were the names  of pots in which alcoholic 
 drinks used to be prepared). The Prophet further said, "Memorize them 
 (these instructions) and tell them to the people whom you have left 
 behind."
