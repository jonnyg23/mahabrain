 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:698</h3><p><i>Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle made a small room in the month of Ramadan (Sa'id said,
 "I think that Zaid bin Thabit said that it was made of a mat") and he 
 prayed there for a few nights, and so some of his companions prayed 
 behind him. When he came to know about it, he kept on sitting. In the 
 morning, he went out to them and said, "I have seen and understood 
 what you did. You should pray in your houses, for the best prayer of a
 person is that which he prays in his house except the compulsory 
 prayers."
