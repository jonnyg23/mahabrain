 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:197</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 When the ailment of the Prophet became aggravated and his disease 
 became severe, he asked his wives to permit him to be nursed (treated)
 in my house. So they gave him the permission. Then the Prophet came 
 (to my house) with the support of two men, and his legs were dragging 
 on the ground, between 'Abbas, and another man." 'Ubaid-Ullah (the sub
 narrator) said, "I informed 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas of what'Aisha said. 
 Ibn 'Abbas said: 'Do you know who was the other man?' I replied in the
 negative. Ibn 'Abbas said, 'He was 'Ali (bin Abi Talib)." 'Aisha 
 further said, "When the Prophet came to my house and his sickness 
 became aggravated he ordered us to pour seven skins full of water on 
 him, so that he might give some advice to the people. So he was seated
 in a Mikhdab (brass tub) belonging to Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet. 
 Then, all of us started pouring water on him from the water skins till
 he beckoned to us to stop and that we have done (what he wanted us to 
 do). After that he went out to the people."
