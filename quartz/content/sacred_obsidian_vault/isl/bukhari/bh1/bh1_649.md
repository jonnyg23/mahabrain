 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:647</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 the mother of the believers: Allah's Apostle in his illness said, 
 "Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer." I said to him, "If Abu 
 Bakr stands in your place, the people would not hear him owing to his 
 (excessive) weeping. So please order 'Umar to lead the prayer." 'Aisha
 added I said to Hafsa, "Say to him: If Abu Bakr should lead the people
 in the prayer in your place, the people would not be able to hear him 
 owing to his weeping; so please, order 'Umar to lead the prayer." 
 Hafsa did so but Allah's Apostle said, "Keep quiet! You are verily the
 Companions of Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer. 
 " Hafsa said to 'Aisha, "I never got anything good from you."
