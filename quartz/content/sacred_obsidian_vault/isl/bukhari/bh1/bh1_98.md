 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:98</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 I said: "O Allah's Apostle! Who will be the luckiest person, who will 
 gain your intercession on the Day of Resurrection?" Allah's Apostle 
 said: O Abu Huraira! "I have thought that none will ask me about it 
 before you as I know your longing for the (learning of) Hadiths. The 
 luckiest person who will have my intercession on the Day of 
 Resurrection will be the one who said sincerely from the bottom of his
 heart "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah."
 <p>
 And 'Umar bin 'Abdul 'Aziz wrote to Abu Bakr bin Hazm, "Look for the 
 knowledge of Hadith and get it written, as I am afraid that religious 
 knowledge will vanish and the religious learned men will pass away 
 (die). Do not accept anything save the Hadiths of the Prophet. 
 Circulate knowledge and teach the ignorant, for knowledge does not 
 vanish except when it is kept secretly (to oneself)."
