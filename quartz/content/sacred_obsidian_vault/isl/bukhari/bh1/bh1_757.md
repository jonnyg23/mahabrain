 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:755</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Ikrima:</i></p>
 I prayed behind a Sheikh at Mecca and he said twenty two Takbirs 
 (during the prayer). I told Ibn 'Abbas that he (i.e. that Sheikh) was 
 foolish. Ibn 'Abbas admonished me and said, "This is the tradition of 
 Abu-l-Qasim." And narrated Abu Huraira: Whenever Allah's Apostle stood
 for the prayer, he said Takbir on starting the prayer and then on 
 bowing. On rising from bowing he said, "Sami' a-l-lahu liman hamida," 
 and then while standing straight he used to say, "Rabbana laka-l hamd"
 (Al-Laith said, "(The Prophet said), 'Walaka-l-hamd'." He used to say 
 Takbir on prostrating and on raising his head from prostration; again 
 he would Say Takbir on prostrating and raising his head. He would then
 do the same in the whole of the prayer till it was completed. On 
 rising from the second Rak'a (after sitting for At-Tahiyyat), he used 
 to say Takbir.
