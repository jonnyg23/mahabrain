 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:313</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 In the last Hajj of Allah's Apostle I assume the Ihram for Hajj along 
 with Allah Apostle. I was one of those who intended Tamattu' (to 
 perform Hajj an 'Umra) and did not take the Hadi (animal for 
 sacrifice) with me. I got my menses and was not clean till the night 
 of 'Arafa I said, "O Allah's Apostle! It is the night of the day of 
 'Arafat and I intended to perform the Hajj Tamattu' with 'Umra Allah's
 Apostle told me to undo my hair and comb it and to postpone the 'Umra.
 I did the same and completed the Hajj. On the night of Al-Hasba (i.e. 
 place outside Mecca where the pilgrims go after finishing all the 
 ceremonies Hajj at Mina) he (the Prophet ordered 'Abdur Rahman 
 ('Aisha's brother) to take me to At-Tan'im to assume the lhram 
 for'Umra in lieu of that of Hajj-atTamattu' which I had intended to 
 perform.
