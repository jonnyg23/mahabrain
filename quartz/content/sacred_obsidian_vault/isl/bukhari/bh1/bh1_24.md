 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:25</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle was asked, "What is the best deed?" He replied, "To 
 believe in Allah and His Apostle (Muhammad). The questioner then 
 asked, "What is the next (in goodness)? He replied, "To participate in
 Jihad (religious fighting) in Allah's Cause." The questioner again 
 asked, "What is the next (in goodness)?" He replied, "To perform Hajj 
 (Pilgrim age to Mecca) 'Mubrur, (which is accepted by Allah and is 
 performed with the intention of seeking Allah's pleasure only and not 
 to show off and without committing a sin and in accordance with the 
 traditions of the Prophet)."
