 Ibn 'Umar said, "Allah's Apostle said, 'If the supper is served for 
 anyone of you and the Iqama is pronounced, start with the supper and 
 don't be in haste (and carry on eating) till you finish it." If food 
 was served for Ibn 'Umar and Iqama was pronounced, he never came to 
 the prayer till he finished it (i.e. food) in spite of the fact that 
 he heard the recitation (of the Qur'an) by the Imam (in the prayer). 
 meals, he should not hurry up till he is; satisfied even if the prayer
 has been started."
