 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:503</h3><p><i>Narrated Shaqiq:</i></p>
 that he had heard Hudhaifa saying, "Once I was sitting with 'Umar and 
 he said, 'Who amongst you remembers the statement of Allah's Apostle 
 about the afflictions?' I said, 'I know it as the Prophet had said 
 it.' 'Umar said, 'No doubt you are bold.' I said, 'The afflictions 
 caused for a man by his wife, money, children and neighbor are 
 expiated by his prayers, fasting, charity and by enjoining (what is 
 good) and forbidding (what is evil).' 'Umar said, 'I did not mean that
 but I asked about that affliction which will spread like the waves of 
 the sea.' I (Hudhaifa) said, 'O leader of the faithful believers! You 
 need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and 
 it.' 'Umar asked, Will the door be broken or opened?' I replied, 'It 
 will be broken.' 'Umar said, 'Then it will never be closed again.' I 
 was asked whether 'Umar knew that door. I replied that he knew it as 
 one knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I 
 narrated a Hadith that was free from any mis-statement" The 
 subnarrator added that they deputed Masruq to ask Hudhaifa (about the 
 door). Hudhaifa said, "The door was 'Umar himself."
