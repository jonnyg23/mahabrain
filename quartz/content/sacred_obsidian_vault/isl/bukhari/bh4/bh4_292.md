 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:289</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 'Umar saw a silken cloak being sold in the market and he brought it to
 Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Buy this cloak and adorn
 yourself with it on the 'Id festivals and on meeting the delegations."
 Allah's Apostle replied, "This is the dress for the one who will have 
 no share in the Hereafter (or, this is worn by one who will have no 
 share in the Hereafter)." After sometime had passed, Allah's Apostle 
 sent a silken cloak to 'Umar. 'Umar took it and brought it to Allah's 
 Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! You have said that this is the 
 dress of that who will have no share in the Hereafter (or, this is 
 worn by one who will have no share in the Hereafter), yet you have 
 sent me this!" The Prophet said," I have sent it) so that you may sell
 it or fulfill with it some of your needs."
