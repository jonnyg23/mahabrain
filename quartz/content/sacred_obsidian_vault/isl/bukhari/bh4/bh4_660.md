 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:657</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, surely 
 (Jesus,) the son of Mary will soon descend amongst you and will judge 
 mankind justly (as a Just Ruler); he will break the Cross and kill the
 pigs and there will be no Jizya (i.e. taxation taken from non 
 Muslims). Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it, 
 and a single prostration to Allah (in prayer) will be better than the 
 whole world and whatever is in it." Abu Huraira added "If you wish, 
 you can recite (this verse of the Holy Book): -- 'And there is none Of
 the people of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians) But must believe in
 him (i.e Jesus as an Apostle of Allah and a human being) Before his 
 death. And on the Day of Judgment He will be a witness Against them." 
 (4.159) (See Fateh Al Bari, Page 302 Vol 7)
