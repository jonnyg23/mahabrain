 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:325</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 (mother of the believers) After the death of Allah 's Apostle Fatima  
 the daughter of Allah's Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, 
 her share of inheritance from what Allah's Apostle had left of the Fai
 (i.e. booty gained without fighting) which Allah had given him. Abu 
 Bakr said to her, "Allah's Apostle said, 'Our property will not be 
 inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to be used for
 charity)." Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle got angry and 
 stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude 
 till she died. Fatima remained alive for six months after the death of
 Allah's Apostle.
 <p>
 She used to ask Abu Bakr for her share from the property of Allah's 
 Apostle which he left at Khaibar, and Fadak, and his property at 
 Medina (devoted for charity). Abu Bakr refused to give her that 
 property and said, "I will not leave anything Allah's Apostle  used to
 do, because I am afraid that if I left something from the Prophet's 
 tradition, then I would go astray." (Later on) Umar gave the Prophet's
 property (of Sadaqa) at Medina to 'Ali and 'Abbas, but he withheld the
 properties of Khaibar and Fadak in his custody and said, "These two 
 properties are the Sadaqa which Allah's Apostle used to use for his 
 expenditures and urgent needs. Now their management is to be entrusted
 to the ruler." (Az-Zuhrl said, "They have been managed in this way 
 till today.")
