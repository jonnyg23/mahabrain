 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:33</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 When 'Umar got a piece of land in Khaibar, he came to the Prophet 
 saying, "I have got a piece of land, better than which I have never 
 got. So what do you advise me regarding it?" The Prophet said, "If you
 wish you can keep it as an endowment to be used for charitable 
 purposes." So, 'Umar gave the land in charity (i.e. as an endowments 
 on the condition that the land would neither be sold nor given as a 
 present, nor bequeathed, (and its yield) would be used for the poor, 
 the kinsmen, the emancipation of slaves, Jihad, and for guests and 
 travelers; and its administrator could eat in a reasonable just 
 manner, and he also could feed his friends without intending to be 
 wealthy by its means."
