 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:283</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Juhaifa:</i></p>
 I asked Ali, "Do you have the knowledge of any Divine Inspiration 
 besides what is in Allah's Book?" 'Ali replied, "No, by Him Who splits
 the grain of corn and creates the soul. I don't think we have such 
 knowledge, but we have the ability of understanding which Allah may 
 endow a person with, so that he may understand the Qur'an, and we have
 what is written in this paper as well." I asked, "What is written in 
 this paper?" He replied, "(The regulations of) blood-money, the 
 freeing of captives, and the judgment that no Muslim should be killed 
 for killing an infidel."
