 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:454</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 That she asked the Prophet , 'Have you encountered a day harder than 
 the day of the battle) of Uhud?" The Prophet replied, "Your tribes 
 have troubled me a lot, and the worse trouble was the trouble on the 
 day of 'Aqaba when I presented myself to Ibn 'Abd-Yalail bin 
 'Abd-Kulal and he did not respond to my demand. So I departed, 
 overwhelmed with excessive sorrow, and proceeded on, and could not 
 relax till I found myself at Qarnath-Tha-alib where I lifted my head 
 towards the sky to see a cloud shading me unexpectedly. I looked up 
 and saw Gabriel in it. He called me saying, 'Allah has heard your 
 people's saying to you, and what they have replied back to you, Allah 
 has sent the Angel of the Mountains to you so that you may order him 
 to do whatever you wish to these people.' The Angel of the Mountains 
 called and greeted me, and then said, "O Muhammad! Order what you 
 wish. If you like, I will let Al-Akh-Shabain (i.e. two mountains) fall
 on them." The Prophet said, "No but I hope that Allah will let them 
 beget children who will worship Allah Alone, and will worship None 
 besides Him."
