 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:231</h3><p><i>Narrated Nafi from 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle came to Mecca through its higher region on the day of 
 the Conquest (of Mecca) riding his she-camel on which Usama was riding
 behind him. Bilal and 'Uthman bin Talha, one of the servants of the 
 Ka'ba, were also accompanying him till he made his camel kneel in the 
 mosque and ordered the latter to bring the key of the Ka'ba. He opened
 the door of the Ka'ba and Allah's Apostle entered in the company of 
 Usama, Bilal and 'Uthman, and stayed in it for a long period. When he 
 came out, the people rushed to it, and 'Abdullah bin 'Umar was the 
 first to enter it and found Bilal standing behind the door. He asked 
 Bilal, "Where did the Prophet offer his prayer?" He pointed to the 
 place where he had offered his prayer. 'Abdullah said, "I forgot to 
 ask him how many Rakat he had performed."
