 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:314</h3><p><i>Narrated Sad bin 'Ubaida:</i></p>
 Abu Abdur-Rahman who was one of the supporters of Uthman said to Abu 
 Talha who was one of the supporters of Ali, "I perfectly know what 
 encouraged your leader (i.e. 'Ali) to shed blood. I heard him saying: 
 Once the Prophet sent me and Az-Zubair saying, 'Proceed to 
 such-and-such Ar-Roudah (place) where you will find a lady whom Hatib 
 has given a letter. So when we arrived at Ar-Roudah, we requested the 
 lady to hand over the letter to us. She said, 'Hatib has not given me 
 any letter.' We said to her. 'Take out the letter or else we will 
 strip off your clothes.' So she took it out of her braid. So the 
 Prophet sent for Hatib, (who came) and said, 'Don't hurry in judging 
 me, for, by Allah, I have not become a disbeliever, and my love to 
 Islam is increasing. (The reason for writing this letter was) that 
 there is none of your companions but has relatives in Mecca who look 
 after their families and property, while I have nobody there, so I 
 wanted to do them some favor (so that they might look after my family 
 and property).' The Prophet believed him. 'Umar said, 'Allow me to 
 chop off his (i.e. Hatib's) neck as he has done hypocrisy.' The 
 Prophet said, (to 'Umar), 'Who knows, perhaps Allah has looked at the 
 warriors of Badr and said (to them), 'Do whatever you like, for I have
 forgiven you.' " 'Abdur-Rahman added, "So this is what encouraged him 
 (i.e. Ali)."
