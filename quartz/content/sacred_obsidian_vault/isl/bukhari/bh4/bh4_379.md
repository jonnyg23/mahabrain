 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:375</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 When Allah favored His Apostle with the properties of Hawazin tribe as
 Fai (booty), he started giving to some Quarries men even up to 
 one-hundred camels each, whereupon some Ansari men said about Allah's 
 Apostle, "May Allah forgive His Apostle! He is giving to (men of) 
 Quraish and leaves us, in spite of the fact that our swords are still 
 dropping blood (of the infidels)" When Allah's Apostle was informed of
 what they had said, he called the Ansar and gathered them in a leather
 tent and did not call anybody else along, with them. When they 
 gathered, Allah's Apostle came to them and said, "What is the 
 statement which, I have been informed, and that which you have said?" 
 The learned ones among them replied," O Allah's Apostle! The wise ones
 amongst us did not say anything, but the youngsters amongst us said, 
 'May Allah forgive His Apostle; he gives the Quarish and leaves the 
 Ansar, in spite of the fact that our swords are still dribbling (wet) 
 with the blood of the infidels.' " Allah's Apostle replied, I give to 
 such people as are still close to the period of Infidelity (i.e. they 
 have recently embraced Islam and Faith is still weak in their hearts).
 Won't you be pleased to see people go with fortune, while you return 
 with Allah's Apostle to your houses? By Allah, what you will return 
 with, is better than what they are returning with." The Ansar replied,
 "Yes, O Allah's Apostle, we are satisfied' Then the Prophet said to 
 them." You will find after me, others being preferred to you. Then be 
 patient till you meet Allah and meet His Apostle at Al-Kauthar (i.e. a
 fount in Paradise)." (Anas added:) But we did not remain patient.
