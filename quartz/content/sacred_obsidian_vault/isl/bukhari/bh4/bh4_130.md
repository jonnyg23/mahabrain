 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:129</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle went to the daughter of Milhan and reclined there (and
 slept) and then (woke up) smiling. She asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What
 makes you smile?" He replied, (I dreamt that) some people amongst my 
 followers were sailing on the green sea in Allah's Cause, resembling 
 kings on thrones." She said, "O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to make 
 me one of them." He said, "O Allah! Let her be one of them." Then he 
 (slept again and woke up and) smiled. She asked him the same question 
 and he gave the same reply. She said, "Invoke Allah to make me one of 
 them." He replied, ''You will be amongst the first group of them; you 
 will not be amongst the last." Later on she married 'Ubada bin 
 As-Samit and then she sailed on the sea with bint Qaraza, Mu'awiya's 
 wife (for Jihad). On her return, she mounted her riding animal, which 
 threw her down breaking her neck, and she died on falling down.
