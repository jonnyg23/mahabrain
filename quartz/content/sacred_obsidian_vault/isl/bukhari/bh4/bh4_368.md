 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:364</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Musa:</i></p>
 We got the news of the migration of the Prophet while we were in 
 Yemen, so we set out migrating to him. We were, I and my two brothers,
 I being the youngest, and one of my brothers was Abu Burda and the 
 other was Abu Ruhm. We were over fifty (or fifty-three or fifty two) 
 men from our people. We got on board a ship which took us to 
 An-Najashi in Ethiopia, and there we found Ja'far bin Abu Talib and 
 his companions with An-Najaishi. Ja'far said (to us), "Allah's Apostle
 has sent us here and ordered us to stay here, so you too, stay with 
 us." We stayed with him till we all left (Ethiopia) and met the 
 Prophet at the time when he had conquered Khaibar. He gave us a share 
 from its booty (or gave us from its booty). He gave only to those who 
 had taken part in the Ghazwa with him. but he did not give any share 
 to any person who had not participated in Khaibar's conquest except 
 the people of our ship, besides Ja'far and his companions, whom he 
 gave a share as he did them (i.e. the people of the ship).
