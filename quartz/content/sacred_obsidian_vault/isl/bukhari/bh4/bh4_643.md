 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:640</h3><p><i>Narrated Malik bin Sasaa:</i></p>
 That the Prophet talked to them about the night of his Ascension to 
 the Heavens. He said, "(Then Gabriel took me) and ascended up till he 
 reached the second heaven where he asked for the gate to be opened, 
 but it was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'I am Gabriel.' It was
 asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' He replied, 'Muhammad.' It was 
 asked, 'Has he been called?' He said, 'Yes.' When we reached over the 
 second heaven, I saw Yahya (i.e. John) and Jesus who were cousins. 
 Gabriel said, 'These are John (Yahya) and Jesus, so greet them.' I 
 greeted them and they returned the greeting saying, 'Welcome, O Pious 
 Brother and Pious Prophet!;' "
