 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:489</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Wail:</i></p>
 Somebody said to Usama, "Will you go to so-and-so (i.e. 'Uthman) and 
 talk to him (i.e. advise him regarding ruling the country)?" He said, 
 "You see that I don't talk to him. Really I talk to (advise) him 
 secretly without opening a gate (of affliction), for neither do I want
 to be the first to open it (i.e. rebellion), nor will I say to a man 
 who is my ruler that he is the best of all the people after I have 
 heard something from Allah s Apostle ." They said, What have you heard
 him saying? He said, "I have heard him saying, "A man will be brought 
 on the Day of Resurrection and thrown in the (Hell) Fire, so that his 
 intestines will come out, and he will go around like a donkey goes 
 around a millstone. The people of (Hell) Fire will gather around him 
 and say: O so-and-so! What is wrong with you? Didn't you use to order 
 us to do good deeds and forbid us to do bad deeds? He will reply: Yes,
 I used to order you to do good deeds, but I did not do them myself, 
 and I used to forbid you to do bad deeds, yet I used to do them 
 myself."
