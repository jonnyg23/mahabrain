 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:885</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:</i></p>
 A bedouin came to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's apostle! I ask 
 you by Allah to judge My case according to Allah's Laws." His 
 opponent, who was more learned than he, said, "Yes, judge between us 
 according to Allah's Laws, and allow me to speak." Allah's Apostle 
 said, "Speak." He (i .e. the bedouin or the other man) said, "My son 
 was working as a laborer for this (man) and he committed illegal 
 sexual intercourse with his wife. The people told me that it was 
 obligatory that my son should be stoned to death, so in lieu of that I
 ransomed my son by paying one hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I 
 asked the religious scholars about it, and they informed me that my 
 son must be lashed one hundred lashes, and be exiled for one year, and
 the wife of this (man) must be stoned to death." Allah's Apostle said,
 "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according 
 to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to be returned to 
 you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled for one 
 year. You, Unais, go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses 
 her guilt, stone her to death." Unais went to that woman next morning 
 and she confessed. Allah's Apostle ordered that she be stoned to 
 death.
