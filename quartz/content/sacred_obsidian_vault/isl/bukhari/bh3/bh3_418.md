 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:421</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 Sad bin Abi Waqqas and 'Abu bin Zam'a quarreled over a boy. Sad said, 
 "O Allah's Apostle! This boy is the son of my brother ('Utba bin Abi 
 Waqqas) who took a promise from me that I would take him as he was his
 (illegal) son. Look at him and see whom he resembles." 'Abu bin Zam'a 
 said, "O Allah's Apostle! This is my brother and was born on my 
 father's bed from his slave-girl." Allah's Apostle cast a look at the 
 boy and found definite resemblance to 'Utba and then said, "The boy is
 for you, O 'Abu bin Zam'a. The child goes to the owner of the bed and 
 the adulterer gets nothing but the stones (despair, i.e. to be stoned 
 to death). Then the Prophet said, "O Sauda bint Zama! Screen yourself 
 from this boy." So, Sauda never saw him again.
