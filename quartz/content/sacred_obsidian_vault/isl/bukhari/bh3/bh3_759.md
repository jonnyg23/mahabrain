 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:760</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Amir:</i></p>
 I heard An-Nu'man bin Bashir on the pulpit saying, "My father gave me 
 a gift but 'Amra bint Rawaha (my mother) said that she would not agree
 to it unless he made Allah's Apostle as a witness to it. So, my father
 went to Allah's Apostle and said, 'I have given a gift to my son from 
 'Amra bint Rawaha, but she ordered me to make you as a witness to it, 
 O Allah's Apostle!' Allah's Apostle asked, 'Have you given (the like 
 of it) to everyone of your sons?' He replied in the negative. Allah's 
 Apostle said, 'Be afraid of Allah, and be just to your children.' My 
 father then returned and took back his gift."
