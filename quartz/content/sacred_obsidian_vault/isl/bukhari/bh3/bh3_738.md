 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:739</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdul Wahid bin Aiman:</i></p>
 I went to 'Aisha and said, "I was the slave of Utba bin Abu Lahab. 
 "Utba died and his sons became my masters who sold me to Ibn Abu Amr 
 who manumitted me. The sons of 'Utba stipulated that my Wala' should 
 be for them." 'Aisha said, "Buraira came to me and she was given the 
 writing of emancipation by her masters and she asked me to buy and 
 manumit her. I agreed to it, but Buraira told me that her masters 
 would not sell her unless her Wala' was for them." 'Aisha said, "I am 
 not in need of that." When the Prophet heard that, or he was told 
 about it, he asked 'Aisha about it. 'Aisha mentioned what Buraira had 
 told her. The Prophet said, "Buy and manumit her and let them 
 stipulate whatever they like." So, 'Aisha bought and manumitted her 
 and her masters stipulated that her Wala' should be for them." The 
 Prophet;, said, "The Wala' will be for the liberator even if they 
 stipulated a hundred conditions."
