 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:674</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair:</i></p>
 That he had asked 'Aisha about the meaning of the Statement of Allah: 
 "If you fear that you shall not Be able to deal justly With the orphan
 girls, then Marry (Other) women of your choice Two or three or four." 
 (4.3)
 <p>
 She said, "O my nephew! This is about the orphan girl who lives with 
 her guardian and shares his property. Her wealth and beauty may tempt 
 him to marry her without giving her an adequate Mahr (bridal-money) 
 which might have been given by another suitor. So, such guardians were
 forbidden to marry such orphan girls unless they treated them justly 
 and gave them the most suitable Mahr; otherwise they were ordered to 
 marry any other woman." 'Aisha further said, "After that verse the 
 people again asked the Prophet (about the marriage with orphan 
 'girls), so Allah revealed the following verses:-- 'They ask your 
 instruction Concerning the women. Say: Allah Instructs you about them 
 And about what is Recited unto you In the Book, concerning The orphan 
 girls to whom You give not the prescribed portions and yet whom you 
 Desire to marry..."  (4.127)
 </p><p>
 What is meant by Allah's Saying:-- 'And about what is Recited unto you
 is the former verse which goes:-- 'If you fear that you shall not Be 
 able to deal justly With the orphan girls, then Marry (other) women of
 your choice.' (4.3) 'Aisha said, "Allah's saying in the other 
 verse:--'Yet whom you desire to marry' (4.127) means the desire of the
 guardian to marry an orphan girl under his supervision when she has 
 not much property or beauty (in which case he should treat her 
 justly). The guardians were forbidden to marry their orphan girls 
 possessing property and beauty without being just to them, as they 
 generally refrain from marrying them (when they are neither beautiful 
 nor wealthy)."
