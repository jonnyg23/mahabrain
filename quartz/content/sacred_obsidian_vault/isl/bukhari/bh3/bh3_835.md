 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:836</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Wail:</i></p>
 Abdullah (bin Mas'ud) said, "Whoever takes a (false) oath in order to 
 grab some property (unjustly), Allah will be angry with him when he 
 will meet Him. Allah confirmed that through His Divine Revelation: 
 "Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's 
 covenant and their oaths . . . they will have a painful punishment."  
 (3.77)
 <p>
 Al-Ash'ath bin Qais came to us and asked, 'What is Abu Abdur-Rahman 
 (i.e. 'Abdullah) telling you? 'We told him what he was narrating to 
 us. He said, 'He was telling the truth; this Divine Verse was revealed
 in connection with me. There was a dispute between me and another man 
 about something and the case was filed before Allah's Apostle who 
 said, 'Produce your two witnesses or else the defendant is to take an 
 oath.' I said, The defendant will surely take a (false) oath caring 
 for nothing.' The Prophet said, 'Whoever takes a false oath in order 
 to grab (other's) property, then Allah will be angry with him when he 
 will meet Him.' Then Allah revealed its confirmation. Al-Ashath then 
 recited the above Divine Verse."   (3.77)
