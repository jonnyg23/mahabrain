 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:306</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Hazim:</i></p>
 I heard Sahl bin Sad saying, "A woman brought a Burda (i.e. a square 
 piece of cloth having edging). I asked, 'Do you know what a Burda is?'
 They replied in the affirmative and said, "It is a cloth sheet with 
 woven margins." Sahl went on, "She addressed the Prophet and said, 'I 
 have woven it with my hands for you to wear.' The Prophet took it as 
 he was in need of it, and came to us wearing it as a waist sheet. One 
 of us said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Give it to me to wear.' The Prophet 
 agreed to give it to him. The Prophet sat with the people for a while 
 and then returned (home), wrapped that waist sheet and sent it to him.
 The people said to that man, 'You haven't done well by asking him for 
 it when you know that he never turns down anybody's request.' The man 
 replied, 'By Allah, I have not asked him for it except to use it as my
 shroud when I die." Sahl added; "Later it (i.e. that sheet) was his 
 shroud."
