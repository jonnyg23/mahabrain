 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:244</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle used to practice Itikaf in the middle ten days of 
 Ramadan and once he stayed in Itikaf till the night of the 
 twenty-first and it was the night in the morning of which he used to 
 come out of his Itikaf. The Prophet said, "Whoever was in Itikaf with 
 me should stay in Itikaf for the last ten days, for I was informed (of
 the date) of the Night (of Qadr) but I have been caused to forget it. 
 (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water in the 
 morning of that night. So, look for it in the last ten nights and in 
 the odd ones of them." It rained that night and the roof of the mosque
 dribbled as it was made of leaf stalks of date-palms. I saw with my 
 own eyes the mark of mud and water on the forehead of the Prophet 
 (i.e. in the morning of the twenty-first).
