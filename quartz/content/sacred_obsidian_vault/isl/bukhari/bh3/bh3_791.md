 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:792</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:</i></p>
 I gave a horse in Allah's Cause. The person to whom it was given, did 
 not look after it. I intended to buy it from him, thinking that he 
 would sell it cheap. When I asked the Prophet he said, "Don't buy it, 
 even if he gives it to you for one Dirham, as the person who takes 
 back what he has given in charity, is like a dog that swallows back 
 its vomit."
