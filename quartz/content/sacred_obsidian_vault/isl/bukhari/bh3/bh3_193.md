 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:196</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'As:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said to me, "O 'Abdullah! Have I not been informed 
 that you fast during the day and offer prayers all the night." 
 'Abdullah replied, "Yes, O Allah's Apostle!" The Prophet said, "Don't 
 do that; fast for few days and then give it up for few days, offer 
 prayers and also sleep at night, as your body has a right on you, and 
 your wife has a right on you, and your guest has a right on you. And 
 it is sufficient for you to fast three days in a month, as the reward 
 of a good deed is multiplied ten times, so it will be like fasting 
 throughout the year." I insisted (on fasting) and so I was given a 
 hard instruction. I said, "O Allah's Apostle! I have power." The 
 Prophet said, "Fast like the fasting of the Prophet David and do not 
 fast more than that." I said, "How was the fasting of the Prophet of 
 Allah, David?" He said, "Half of the year," (i.e. he used to fast on 
 every alternate day).
 <p>
 Afterwards when 'Abdullah became old, he used to say, "It would have 
 been better for me if I had accepted the permission of the Prophet 
 (which he gave me i.e. to fast only three days a month)."
