 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:842</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Wail from Abdullah:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Whoever takes a false oath in order to grab another
 man's (or his brother's) property, then Allah will be angry with him 
 when he will meet him." Then Allah confirmed this by revealing the 
 Divine Verse: "Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of
 Allah's Covenant and their oaths . . . Will get painful punishment." 
 (3.77) Al-Ash'ath met me and asked, "What did 'Abdullah tell you 
 today?" I said, "So and so." He said, "The Verse was revealed 
 regarding my case."
