 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:716</h3><p><i>Narrated Marwan and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:</i></p>
 When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the Prophet and 
 they requested him to return their properties and captives. The 
 Prophet stood up and said to them, "I have other people with me in 
 this matter (as you see) and the most beloved statement to me is the 
 true one; you may choose either the properties or the prisoners as I 
 have delayed their distribution." The Prophet had waited for them for 
 more than ten days since his arrival from Ta'if. So, when it became 
 evident to them that the Prophet was not going to return them except 
 one of the two, they said, "We choose our prisoners." The Prophet got 
 up amongst the people and glorified and praised Allah as He deserved 
 and said, "Then after, these brethren of yours have come to us with 
 repentance, and I see it logical to return them the captives. So, 
 whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, 
 and whoever of you likes to stick to his share till we recompense him 
 from the very first war booty which Allah will give us, then he can do
 so (i.e. give up the present captives)." The people unanimously said, 
 "We do that (return the captives) willingly." The Prophet said, "We do
 not know which of you has agreed to it and which have not, so go back 
 and let your leaders forward us your decision." So, all the people 
 then went back and discussed the matter with their leaders who 
 returned and informed the Prophet that all the people had willingly 
 given their consent to return the captives. This is what has reached 
 the Prophet, "I paid for my ransom and Aqil's ransom."
