 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:581</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 When my father died he owed a Jew thirty Awsuq (of dates). I requested
 him to give me respite for repaying but he refused. I requested 
 Allah's Apostle to intercede with the Jew. Allah's Apostle went to the
 Jew and asked him to accept the fruits of my trees in place of the 
 debt but the Jew refused. Allah's Apostle entered the garden of the 
 date-palms, wandering among the trees and ordered me (saying), "Pluck 
 (the fruits) and give him his due." So, I plucked the fruits for him 
 after the departure of Allah's Apostle and gave his thirty Awsuq, and 
 still had seventeen Awsuq extra for myself. Jabir said: I went to 
 Allah's Apostle to inform of what had happened, but found him praying 
 the 'Asr prayer. After the prayer I told him about the extra fruits 
 which remained. Allah's Apostle told me to inform (Umar) Ibn Al-Khatab
 about it. When I went to 'Umar and told him about it, 'Umar said, 
 "When Allah's Apostle walked in your garden, I was sure that Allah 
 would definitely bless it."
