 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:11</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</i></p>
 Umar bin Al-Khattab saw a silken cloak (being sold) at the gate of the
 Mosque and said to Allah's Apostle, "I wish you would buy this to wear
 on Fridays and also on occasions of the arrivals of the delegations." 
 Allah's Apostle replied, "This will be worn by a person who will have 
 no share (reward) in the Hereafter." Later on similar cloaks were 
 given to Allah's Apostle and he gave one of them to 'Umar bin 
 Al-Khattab. On that 'Umar said, "O Allah's Apostle! You have given me 
 this cloak although on the cloak of Atarid (a cloak merchant who was 
 selling that silken cloak at the gate of the mosque) you passed such 
 and such a remark." Allah's Apostle replied, "I have not given you 
 this to wear". And so 'Umar bin Al-Khattab gave it to his pagan 
 brother in Mecca to wear.
