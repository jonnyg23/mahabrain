 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:133</h3><p><i>Narrated Masruq:</i></p>
 One day I went to Ibn Masud  who said, "When Quraish delayed in 
 embracing Islam, the Prophet I invoked Allah to curse them, so they 
 were afflicted with a (famine) year because of which many of them died
 and they ate the carcasses and Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and 
 said, 'O Muhammad! You came to order people to keep good relation with
 kith and kin and your nation is being destroyed, so invoke Allah I ? 
 So the Prophet I recited the Holy verses of Sirat-Ad-Dukhan: 'Then 
 watch you For the day that The sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke 
 Plainly visible.' (44.10) When the famine was taken off, the people 
 renegade once again as nonbelievers. The statement of Allah, (in Sura 
 "Ad-Dukhan"-44) refers to that: 'On the day when We shall seize You 
 with a mighty grasp.' (44.16) And that was what happened on the day of
 the battle of Badr." Asbath added on the authority of Mansur, "Allah's
 Apostle prayed for them and it rained heavily for seven days. So the 
 people complained of the excessive rain. The Prophet said, 'O Allah! 
 (Let it rain) around us and not on us.' So the clouds dispersed over 
 his head and it rained over the surroundings."
