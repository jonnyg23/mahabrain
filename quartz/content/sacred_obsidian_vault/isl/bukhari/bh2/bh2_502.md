 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:501</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 Some of the wives of the Prophet asked him, "Who amongst us will be 
 the first to follow you (i.e. die after you)?" He said, "Whoever has 
 the longest hand." So they started measuring their hands with a stick 
 and Sauda's hand turned out to be the longest. (When Zainab bint Jahsh
 died first of all in the caliphate of 'Umar), we came to know that the
 long hand was a symbol of practicing charity, so she was the first to 
 follow the Prophet and she used to love to practice charity. (Sauda 
 died later in the caliphate of Muawiya).
