 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:78</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Juraij:</i></p>
 'Ata' said, "Jabir bin 'Abdullah said, 'The Prophet went out on the 
 Day of 'Id-ul-Fitr and offered the prayer before delivering the 
 Khutba, Ata told me that during the early days of IbnAz-Zubair, Ibn  
 Abbas had sent a message to him telling him that the Adhan for the 'Id
 Prayer was never pronounced (in the life time of Allah's Apostle) and 
 the Khutba used to be delivered after the prayer. Ata told me that Ibn
 Abbas and Jabir bin 'Abdullah, had said,  - where was no Adhan for 
 the prayer of '7d-ul-Fitr and 'Id-ul-Aqha." 'At a' said, "I heard 
 Jabir bin 'Abdullah saying, 'The Prophet stood up and started with the
 prayer, and after it he delivered the Khutba. When the Prophet of 
 Allah (p.b.u.h) finished (the Khutba), he went to the women and 
 preached to them, while he was leaning on Bilal's hand. Bilal was 
 spreading his garment and the ladies were putting alms in it.' " I 
 said to Ata, "Do you think it incumbent upon an Imam to go to the 
 women and preach to them after finishing the prayer and Khutba?" 'Ata'
 said, "No doubt it is incumbent on Imams to do so, and why should they
 not do so?"
