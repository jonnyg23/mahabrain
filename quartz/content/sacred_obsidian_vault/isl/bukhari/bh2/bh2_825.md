 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:823</h3><p><i>Narrated ' Aisha:</i></p>
 Safiya got her menses on the night of Nafr (departure from Hajj), and 
 she said, "I see that I will detain you." The Prophet said, "Aqra 
 Halqa! Did she perform the Tawaf on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?" 
 Somebody replied in the affirmative. He said, "Then depart." 
 (Different narrators mentioned that) 'Aisha said, "We set out with 
 Allah's Apostle (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj 
 only. When we reached Mecca, he ordered us to finish the Ihram. When 
 it was the night of Nafr (departure), Safiya bint Huyay got her 
 menses. The Prophet said, "Halqa Aqra! I think that she will detain 
 you," and added, "Did you perform the Tawaf (Al-Ifada) on the Day of 
 Nahr (slaughtering)?" She replied, "Yes." He said, "Then depart." I 
 said, "O Allah's Apostle! I have not (done the Umra)." He replied, 
 "Perform 'Umra from Tan'im." My brother went with me and we came 
 across the Prophet in the last part of the night. He said, "Wait at 
 such and such a place."
