 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:25</h3><p><i>Narrated  Aisha:</i></p>
 (the wife of the Prophet) The people used to come from their abodes 
 and from Al-'Awali (i.e. outskirts of Medina up to a distance of four 
 miles or more from Medina). They used to pass through dust and used to
 be drenched with sweat and covered with dust; so sweat used to trickle
 from them. One of them came to Allah's Apostle who was in my house. 
 The Prophet said to him, "I wish that you keep yourself clean on this 
 day of yours (i.e. take a bath)."
