 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:359</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</i></p>
 When 'Abdullah bin Ubai (the chief of hypocrites) died, his son came 
 to the Prophet and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Please give me your shirt
 to shroud him in it, offer his funeral prayer and ask for Allah's 
 forgiveness for him." So Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) gave his shirt to 
 him and said, "Inform me (When the funeral is ready) so that I may 
 offer the funeral prayer." So, he informed him and when the Prophet 
 intended to offer the funeral prayer, 'Umar took hold of his hand and 
 said, "Has Allah not forbidden you to offer the funeral prayer for the
 hypocrites? The Prophet said, "I have been given the choice for Allah 
 says: '(It does not avail) Whether you (O Muhammad) ask forgiveness 
 for them (hypocrites), or do not ask for forgiveness for them. Even 
 though you ask for their forgiveness seventy times, Allah will not 
 forgive them. (9.80)" So the Prophet offered the funeral prayer and on
 that the revelation came: "And never (O Muhammad) pray (funeral 
 prayer) for any of them (i.e. hypocrites) that dies." (9. 84)
