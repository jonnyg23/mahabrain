 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:444</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Ali:</i></p>
 " We were accompanying a funeral procession in Baqi-I-Gharqad. The 
 Prophet came to us and sat and we sat around him. He had a small stick
 in his hand then he bent his head and started scraping the ground with
 it. He then said, "There is none among you, and not a created soul, 
 but has place either in Paradise or in Hell assigned for him and it is
 also determined for him whether he will be among the blessed or 
 wretched." A man said, "O Allah's Apostle! Should we not depend on 
 what has been written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us
 is blessed will do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst 
 us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?" The 
 Prophet said, "The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad 
 deeds are made easy for the wretched." Then he recited the Verses:-- 
 "As for him who gives (in charity) and is Allah-fearing And believes 
 in the Best reward from Allah. " (92.5-6)
