 <p>For this therefore place no reliance upon fortune,<br> For it will suddenly deprive thy soul of life.<br> Put no reliance upon a numberless army,<br> For it may be that thou wilt not be aided by victory.<br> Put no reliance upon kingdom, position, and rank, <a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></a><br> For they existed before thee, and will remain after thee.<br> Do not wrong because thou seest wrong on the part of a true friend;<br> Good fruit doth not grow from bad seed.<br> Put no reliance on majesty and power,<br> For suddenly will arrive the command to give up thy soul.<br> Many are the monarchs of exalted rank;<br> Many are the warriors who overrun kingdoms;<br> Many are the fierce warriors who scatter armies;<br> Many are the lion-like men who smite with the sword;<br> Many are the moon-faced beauties of graceful figure;<br> Many are the lovely ones with stature like the sun;<br> Many are the newly arisen with lovely cheeks; <a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="green">p. 62</font></a><br> Many are the freshly decked brides;<br> Many are the famous, and many are the fortunate;<br> Many are they like the cypress in stature, and many are the rosy-cheeked beauties<br> Who have rent the garment of life,<br> Who have drawn the head within the wall of the grave.<br> With such the harvest of their life hath been scattered to the winds,<br> So that never hath any one a trace of them.<br> Link not thy soul with this earth and its vain delights,<br> For misfortune may rain upon it from Heaven.<br> Set not thine heart upon this material abode,<br> For thou wilt not find therein delight for thy soul.<br> Place not thine affections upon this ancient and ruined dwelling<br> For it will not be void of grief and pain. <a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></a><br> The world hath no permanence, O my son!<br> Pass not thy life therein in negligence.<br> Fix not thy heart upon this perishable abode.<br> From Sadi receive this one piece of advice.</p>
