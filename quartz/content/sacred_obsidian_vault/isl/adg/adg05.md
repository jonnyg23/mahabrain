 <p>The prince of believers (puh) said:</p>  
 <p>1. The most devilish of brothers for whom  formality must be set.<br> 2. If a believer respected his brother (in a formal way) then he is separated  from him.<br> 3. Every new comer has a dilemma, thus make it easy for him with speech.<br> 4. Every person entering (a new place) is surprised, thus start with saying  peace (greeting).<br> 5. Do not be hard on your brother for a doubt, and do not leave him after a  blame.<br> 6. The envy of the friend is a result of the sick affection.<br> 7. Blame your brother by doing him good, and return his evil by doing favours  for him.<br> 8. No goodness exists in someone who leaves his brother for no crime.<br> 9. No good is there in a miser friend.<br> 10. No friendship for a friend would last with betrayal.<br> 11. He would not be happy who makes troubles for his brothers.<br> 12. Betrayal and brotherhood do not come together.<br> 13. No friendship exists for one who gets bored easily.<br> 14. The friendship of the well-mannered is the sweetest of all.<br> 15. With justice, the brotherhood lasts.<br> 16. The friendship is not clear unless with a well-mannered one.<br> 17. Brotherhood is kept with giving condolences.<br> 18. One of the greatest stupidities is to be a friend for the ill-mannered  people.<br> 19. The truthful friend is a gift.<br> 20. He who has little determination, shall envy the friend for the favour.<br> 21. He who has a low determination, do not be his companion.<br> 22. He who cannot bear the mistakes of a friend, shall die lonely.<br> 23. He who debates with his brothers shall have less friends.<br> 24. He who has ill manners shall be left by his freinds.<br> 25. He who digs a pit for his brother, Allah shall make him fall in it.<br> 26. He who has no friends, has no supply.<br> 27. He who has no brothers, has no family.<br> 29. He who does not bear brotherhood, has no good in himself. [Wrong numbering  in the book itself, ignore it].<br> 30. If the friendship goes a long way, that is a sign of the good affection.<br> 31. He who does not care about you, he is your enemy.<br> 32. He who cares about you, he is your friend.<br> 33. Friendship is enough as a test.<br> 35. The good friendship is the goal of friends. [Wrong numbering in the book  itself, ignore it].<br> 34. The friend of the ignorant person is troubled and tired. [Wrong numbering in  the book itself, ignore it].<br> 36. The friend of the stupid is in tiresome time.<br> 37. The friend of the stupid is exposed to damage.<br> 38. Your friend is he who prohibits you, and your enemy is he who seduces you.<br> 39. The condition for the friendship, is to have less objections.<br> 40. May there be a brother for you that was not born by your mother.<br> 41. The most devilish of your brothers is he who makes you satisfied by doing  the ill deeds.<br> 42. The good company makes love lasts.<br> 43. The most devilish person you might company is the ignorant.<br> 44. The good friendship increases the love in the hearts.<br> 45. The most devilish of your brothers is he for whom you take formalities.<br> 46. Ask about the companion before the road.<br> 47. The most devilish of friends is he who flips back at you rapidly.<br> 48. Forget about the bad things in the brothers and you shall make their  affection last.<br> 49. The most devilish of the friends is he who doubts a lot.<br> 50. Ask about the neighbour before the house.<br> 51. Damned is the bad neighbour.<br> 52. By agreeing in good manners, the company shall last.<br> 53. By living together in goodness, the affection shall last.<br> 54. By being brothers unto (for the sake of) Allah, the brotherhood shall bear  the fruit.<br> 55. By living together in goodness, the companions shall be feeling good.<br> 56. By being a good friend, the friends will be abundant.<br> 57. By passion the friendship will last.<br> 58. If the betrayal of the friend shows up, it would be easy to desert him.<br> 59.
