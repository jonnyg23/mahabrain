 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
 <p>Praise belongs to God, the originator of the heavens and the earth; who makes the angels His messengers, endued with wings in pairs, or threes or fours; He adds to creation what He pleases; verily, God is mighty over all!</p>  
 <p>What God opens to men of His mercy there is none to withhold; and what He withholds, there is none can send it forth after Him; for He is the mighty, the wise.</p>  
 <p>O ye folk! remember the favours of God towards you; is there a creator beside God, who provides you from the heavens and from the earth? There is no god but He; how then can ye lie?</p>  
 <p>And if they call thee liar, apostles were called liars before thee, and unto God affairs return.</p>  
 <p>[5] O ye folk! verily, God's promise is true; then let not the life of this world beguile you, and let not the beguiler beguile you concerning God. Verily, the devil is to you a foe, so take him as a foe; he only calls his crew to be the fellows of the blaze.</p>  
 <p>Those who misbelieve, for them is keen torment. But those who believe and do right, for them is forgiveness and a great hire.</p>  
 <p>What! is he whose evil act is made seemly for him, so that he looks upon it as good,------?</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="green">p. 158</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Verily, God leads astray whom He pleases and guides whom He pleases; let not thy soul then be wasted in sighing for them; verily, God knows what they do!</p>  
 <p>[10] It is God who sends the winds, and they stir up a cloud, and we irrigate therewith a dead country, and we quicken therewith the earth after its death; so shall the resurrection be!</p>  
 <p>Whosoever desires honour--honour belongs wholely to God; to Him good words ascend, and a righteous deed He takes up; and those who plot evil deeds, for them is keen torment, and their plotting is in vain.</p>  
 <p>God created you from earth, then from a clot; then He made you pairs; and no female bears or is delivered, except by His knowledge; nor does he who is aged reach old age, or is aught diminished from his life, without it is in the Book; verily, that is easy unto God.</p>  
 <p>The two seas are not equal: one is sweet and fresh and pleasant to drink, and the other is salt and pungent; but from each do ye eat fresh flesh, and bring forth ornaments which ye wear; and thou mayest see the ships cleave through it, that ye may search after His grace, and haply ye may give thanks.</p>  
 <p>He turns the night into day, and He turns the day into night; and He subjects the sun and the moon, each of them runs on to an appointed goal; that is God, your Lord! His is the kingdom; but those ye call on beside Him possess not a straw <a name="fr_209"></a><a href="#fn_209"><font size="1">1</font></a>. [15] If you call upon them they cannot hear your</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="green">p. 159</font></a></p>  
 <p>call, and if they hear they cannot answer you; and on the resurrection day they will deny your associating them with God; but none can inform thee like the One who is aware.</p>  
 <p>O ye folk! ye are in need of God but God, He is independent, praiseworthy.</p>  
 <p>If He please He will take you off, and will bring a fresh creation; for that is no hard matter unto God.</p>  
 <p>And no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another; and if a heavily laden one shall call for its load (to be carried) it shall not be carried for it at all, even though it be a kinsman!--thou canst only warn those who fear their Lord in the unseen and who are steadfast in prayer; and he who is pure is only pure for himself; and unto God the journey is.</p>  
 <p>[20] The blind is not equal with him who sees, nor the darkness with the night, nor the shade with the hot blast; nor are the living equal with the dead; verily, God causes whom He pleases to hear, and thou canst not make those who are in their graves hear; thou art but a warner!</p>  
 <p>Verily, we have sent thee in truth a herald of glad tidings and a warner; and there is no nation but its warner has passed away with it.</p>  
 <p>And if they called thee liar, those before thee called their apostles liars too, who came to them with manifest signs, and the Scriptures, and the illuminating Book.</p>  
 <p>Then I seized those who misbelieved, and what a change it was!</p>  
 <p>[25] Dost thou not see that God has sent down from the heaven water, and has brought forth therewith fruits varied in hue, and on the mountains</p>  
 <p><a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="green">p. 160</font></a></p>  
 <p>dykes <a name="fr_210"></a><a href="#fn_210"><font size="1">1</font></a>, white and red, various in hue, and some intensely black, and men and beasts and cattle, various in hue? thus! none fear God but the wise among His servants; but, verily, God is mighty, forgiving.</p>  
 <p>Verily, those who recite the Book of God, and are steadfast in prayer, and give alms of what we have bestowed in secret and in public, hope for the merchandise that shall not come to naught; that He may pay them their hire, and give them increase of His grace; verily, He is forgiving, grateful.</p>  
 <p>What we have inspired thee with of the Book is true, verifying what was before it; verily, God of His servants is well aware and sees.</p>  
 <p>Then we gave the Book for an inheritance to those whom we chose of our servants, and of them are some who wrong themselves, and of them are some who take a middle course, and of them are some who vie in good works by the permission of their Lord; that is great grace.</p>  
 <p>[30] Gardens of Eden shall they enter, adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls; and their garments therein shall be silk; and they shall say, 'Praise belongs to God, who has removed from us our grief; verily, our Lord is forgiving, grateful! who has made us alight in an enduring abode of His grace, wherein no toil shall touch us, and there shall touch us no fatigue.'</p>  
 <p>But those who misbelieve, for them is the fire of</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="green">p. 161</font></a></p>  
 <p>hell; it shall not be decreed for them to die, nor shall aught of the torment be lightened from them; thus do we reward every misbeliever; and they shall shriek therein, 'O our Lord! bring us forth, and we will do right, not what we used to do!'--'Did we not let you grow old enough for every one who would be mindful to be mindful? and there came to you a warner!--[35] So taste it, for the unjust shall have none to help!' verily, God knows the unseen things of the heavens and of the earth; verily, He knows the nature of men's breasts, He it is who made you vicegerents in the earth, and he who misbelieves, his misbelief is against himself; but their misbelief shall only increase the misbelievers in hatred with their Lord; and their misbelief shall only increase the misbelievers in loss.</p>  
 <p>Say, 'Have ye considered your associates whom ye call on beside God?' show me what they created of the earth; have they a share in the heavens, or have we given them a book that they rest on a manifest sign? nay, the unjust promise each other naught but guile.</p>  
 <p>Verily, God holds back the heavens and the earth lest they should decline; and if they should decline there is none to hold them back after Him; verily, He is clement, forgiving.</p>  
 <p>[40] They swore by God with their most strenuous oath, verily, if there come to them a warner they would be more guided than any one of the nations; but when a warner comes to them, it only increases them in aversion, and in being big with pride in the earth, and in plotting evil; but the plotting of evil only entangles those who practise it; can they then expect aught but the course of those of yore? but</p>  
 <p><a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="green">p. 162</font></a></p>  
 <p>thou shalt not find any alteration in the course of God; and they shall not find any change in the course of God.</p>  
 <p>Have they not journeyed on in the land and seen what was the end of those before them who were stronger than they? but God, nothing can ever make Him helpless in the heavens or in the earth; verily, He is knowing, powerful.</p>  
 <p>Were God to catch men up for what they earn, He would not leave upon the back of it <a name="fr_211"></a><a href="#fn_211"><font size="1">1</font></a> a beast; but He respites them until an appointed time. [45] When their appointed time comes, verily, God looks upon His servants.</p>
