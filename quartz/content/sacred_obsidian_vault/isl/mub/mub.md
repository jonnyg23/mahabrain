 <p><i><u><font size="+2">Translator's Word:</font></u></i>
 </p><p><font size="+1">This is a humble translation for the famous story of "Mu'tamar
 `Ulamá' Baghdád" which occurred at the time of the Seljuk
 king Malikshah I (Maliksháh Seljuqi), the son of the Seljuk king
 Alp Arsalan. Along in this story, the minister or Vizier as was he called,
 Nizam Al-Mulk, was the minister of Malikshah I and helped him to organize
 this event. Both of them, the king and the minister were assassinated in
 the same year of 1092 AD (around 485 AH in Islamic calendar). For more
 information about the Vizier and the king and also this story, you can
 refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam_al_Mulk">wikipedia</a>.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">It is interesting to see that the entry in wikipedia
 contains 3 versions for the story of the assassination of the vizier and
 the king, and the last version is linked to this story which you are about
 to see its translation.</font>
 </p><p><font size="+1">Before proceeding in reading, it is better to see some
 terms:</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Ulema: it is used to denote religious scholars who gained
 a deep insight into religion and its teachings and laws. In modern language
 Ulema can have the same concept of "Scientists." For this reason I will
 use the word "Ulema" to denote religious scholars and nothing else.</font>
 </p><p><font size="+1">Ben: A term means "the son of." It was mainly used in
 old names and still used in some countries to tell the full name of someone.</font>

 <font size="+1">We've found this precious book written in the library of
 Rájá Mahmood Ábád written by the author's own
 hand, and we got this precious pearl in the year of 1300 after the immigration
 of the prophet may peace be upon him [meaning 1300 AH].</font>
 <br>
 <hr width="100%">
 <center><font size="+2">In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</font></center>
 <font size="+1">Thanks be to God alone and peace be upon him he who was sent
 as a mercy for the worlds, Mohammed the arabic prophet and upon his Household,
 the purified and upon his true followers.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">And after that: This is the book of (The conference of
 the Ulema of Baghdad) that was held between the Sunnis and Shiites that
 were gathered by the great king (Maliksháh Seljuqi) under the supervision
 of the great scholar and vizier (Nizam Al-Mulk), and the story was like
 this:</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king was not an extremist and a blind man, who follow
 the ancestors with blindness and racism, but he was a young man with an
 open mind who loves wisdom and Ulema and in the same time he used to like
 entertainment and hunting.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">His Minister (Vizier) was a virtuous wise man who did
 not indulge in life, with a strong will and liked the goodness and its
 people,</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">always investigates after the truth, and liked the Household
 of the prophet so much, and he established the Nizamiyyah school -in Baghdad-
 and he made for the people of science (wisdom) monthly salaries, and used
 to be kind over the poor and the needy.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Once upon a time, a great scholar named (Al-Husayn ben
 Ali Al-`Alawi) entered before the Malikshah and he was one of the greatest
 Shiites Ulema. When the scholar got out from the court of the king some
 of the attendance mocked at him, so the king said: why did you mock at
 him? The man said: Don't you know O king that he is one of the disbelievers
 that God spread his wrath and damnation over them? The king said -surprised-:
 and why is that? isn't he a muslim? The man said: no, he is a shiite! The
 king said then: and what is the meaning of Shiite? aren't shiites one part
 of muslims' creeds? The man said: no, they don't recognize Abu-Bakr and
 `Umar and `Uthmán as caliphs, the king then said: and is there a
 muslim that do not recognize those three as caliphs? The man said: yes,
 these are the shiites, the king then said: if they don't recognize those
 three companions of the prophet as caliphs then why do people call them
 muslims? The man said: that's why I said they are disbelievers.... The
 king then thought about it for a moment and then said: we should call the
 vizier Nizam Al-Mulk to see the situation.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king called Nizam Al-Mulk and asked him about the
 shiites: are they muslims? Nizam Al-Mulk said: Sunnis differed in that,
 some of them said that they are muslims because they -the shiites- testify:
 there is no other god save but Allah, and Mohammed is the prophet of Allah
 and they pray and fast (in Ramadan), and some of them say that they are
 disbelievers.
 <hr width="100%"> The king said: and how many are they? Nizam Al-Mulk
 said: I can't count them precisely but they make up almost half of the
 muslims. The king said: is half of the muslims are all disbelievers? The
 vizier said: some scholars claim that they are disbelievers but I don't.
 The king said: then can you O vizier call the scholars of shiites and sunnis
 to elaborate this matter? The vizier said: this is a difficult task and
 I'm afraid over the king and the kingdom! The king said: why? The vizier
 said: because the case of shiites and sunnis  is not a simple case,
 but it is a case of truth and falsehood and many bloodshed ran for this
 matter and libraries were burnt and women were taken captives and there
 were many books that were made and wars were started for this matter!!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The young king was surprised for this weird case, then
 he thought for a moment and said: O vizier, you know that God gave us the
 wide kingdom and the mighty army so we must thank God for this gift and
 our thank should be in the form of investigating about the truth and guide
 the astraying person to the rightful path, and one of these two creeds
 must be rightful and the other must be wrong, so we must know the truth
 and follow it and know the wrong path and leave it, so if you - O vizier
 - prepared such a conference with the attendance of the shiites and sunnis
 ulema along with the generals and the writers and the rest of the heads
 of the state, so if we found out that the truth is with sunnis we should
 then force the shiites to get into that creed by force.</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">The vizier said: and if the shiites refused to get into
 the creed of sunnis then what shall you do? The young king said: we kill
 them! The vizier said: is it possible to kill half of the muslims? The
 king said: then what is the cure and the solution for this? The vizier
 said: it is to leave this matter.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The conversation finished between the king and his wise
 minister, but he remained that night with a busy mind and worried and didn't
 sleep until next morning, for how come he can't find a solution for this
 problem. And in the early morning he called Nizam Al-Mulk and said to him:
 we shall call upon the ulema of the both creeds and we shall see from the
 arguments and conversations which one is true, and if the truth was with
 the sunnis then we shall invite the shiites by the wisdom and the good
 advice and attracted them with money and fortune like how the prophet (PUH)
 used to do with non Muslims, and in that way we shall be able to serve
 Islam and muslims. Then said the vizier: your opinion is good, but I'm
 afraid of this conference! The king said: why the fear? The vizier said:
 because I'm afraid the shiites will win over the sunnis and their clues
 will rule over us and people will fall in doubt! The king said: is that
 possible? The vizier said: yes, because shiites obvious clues from Quran
 and the Sunna [Sunna means the acts of the prophet that were reported by
 his companions and followers] that their creed is correct and true! But
 the king was not convinced by such an answer from his minister (Nizam Al-Mulk)
 and said to him:</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">It is a must to bring the ulema from both creeds to discover
 the truth and make it distinct from falsehood. Then the vizier asked for
 a time limit of month to prepare the matter, but the young king refused
 that... and finally it was decided that the time limit should be of fifteen
 days.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">In these days, the vizier (Nizam Al-Mulk) gathered ten
 men from the greatest sunni ulema that are dependable for history and laws
 and hadith [hadith: reported speech of the prophet] and the basics and
 arguing, and brought as well ten of the greatest shiites ulema, and that
 was in the month of Sha`bán [Sha`bán: 8th month of islamic
 calendar] in the Nizamiyyah school in Baghdad, and the conference was held
 upon these conditions:</font>
 <br><font size="+1">First: The research should go on from morning until evening
 with exception to the time of prayers, food and break.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Second: The arguments should depend on assured resources
 and dependable books and not on what is heard and rumors.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Third: The arguments that go on in this conference shall
 be recorded.</font>
 <p><font size="+1">And on the assigned day, the king sat down and his vizier
 and his generals and the sunni ulema sat on his right and the shiites ulema
 sat on his left, and the vizier made the opening for the conference (by
 saying): In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful and peace be
 upon Mohammed and his Household and his companions, then he said: the argument
 should be just and asking for the truth</font>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">should be the goal of everyone and none of the companions
 of the prophet (PUH) should be insulted.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Said the great scholar of the sunnis (and his title was
 Al-`Abbási): I can't argue with a creed that make all the companions
 as disbelievers.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Said the great scholar of the shiites (and his title
 was Al-`Alawi and his name was Al-Husayn ben Ali): and who are they who
 make the companions as disbelievers?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: you shiites make all the companions as
 disbelievers.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: this talk of you is against the reality. Is not
 Ali ben Abi Tálib (PUH) and Al-`Abbás and Salmán and
 Ibn `Abbás and Al-Maqdád and Abu-Ðar and others are all
 of the companions, so do we shiites make those companions as disbelievers?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: I meant by all companions Abu-Bakr and
 `Umar and `Uthmán and their followers.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: you rescinded yourself by yourself, did not the
 people of logic say that (the partial positive is against the total negative),
 so you once say that shiites consider all companions disbelievers and once
 you say that shiites consider some companions disbelievers.</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">And here the vizier wanted to talk but the shiite scholar
 didn't give him the chance to do so and said: O great vizier, no one has
 the right to talk unless we are unable to answer, otherwise it would be
 a mix up in the research and astraying the argument from its path without
 any results.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Then the shiite scholar said: I make it clear to you
 O `Abbási that your claim that shiites consider all the companions
 disbelievers is an apparent lie.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási couldn't answer and his face turned red
 and then he said: leave that and tell me, do you shiites insult Abu-Bakr
 and `Umar and `Uthmán?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: some shiites insult them and some others do not.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: and you, `Alawi, in which side are you?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: I don't insult, but my opinion that those who
 insult have their point, and their insults to these three is not a crime
 and not a disbelief or a heresy and it is not one of the small sins.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: did you hear O king what this mean is
 saying?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: O `Abbási, directing the speech to the
 king is astraying, and the king brought us here to talk about the clues
 and proves</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">and not to judge by the force and the weapon.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: it is true what `Alawi is saying, what is your
 answer O `Abbási?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: it is obvious that he who curses the
 companions is a disbeliever.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: it is obvious for you and not me. What is the
 clue that everyone who curses the companions after investigating and knowing
 the truth is a disbeliever? Don't you agree that he who is cursed by the
 prophet deserves to be cursed?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: I do.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: then the prophet cursed Abu-Bakr and `Umar.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: when did he do that? this is an apparent
 lie against the prophet.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: historians of sunnis mentioned that the prophet
 prepared an army under the command of Usámah and he made in the
 army Abu-Bakr and `Umar, and he said: God damns he who lags back from the
 army of Usámah, and then Abu-Bakr and `Uthmán lagged from
 the army of Usámah, so they were included in the damnation of the
 prophet, and he who is damned by the prophet can be damned by any muslim.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Then `Abbási looked down and did not say a word.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Then the king said (to his vizier): is it true what `Alawi
 said?</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: historians did mention that.</font><sup><font size="-2">(1)</font></sup>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: And if insulting the companions was a taboo and
 a disbelief, then why don't you say that Mu`áwiyah ben Abi Sufyán
 [Muawiyah I, the first ruler of the Umayyad dynasty] that he is a disbeliever
 and you don't consider him a heretic for cursing imam Ali ben Abi Tálib
 (PUH) for 40 years and that extended even further to 70 years!?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: cut that discussion and talk about another
 subject.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: one of you innovations you shiites that
 you don't believe in Quran!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: it is but one of your own innovation you sunnis,
 and the clue is that you say that Quran was gathered by `Uthmán,
 so was the prophet unwise to do what `Uthmán did, so that he didn't
 gather the Quran until `Uthmán comes and gather it? Then, how come
 the Quran was not gathered at the time of the prophet and the prophet used
 to order his followers and companions to</font>

 Part 2, page41 and in Táreekh Ibn `Asákir Part 2, page. 391

 Al-Atheer Part 2, page 129.</font>
 <br>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">read all the Quran and he said: he who reads all of the
 Quran gets this and that of such rewards, so is it possible that he orders
 to read all of the Quran if it was not already gathered, and were muslims
 all astraying until `Uthman came and saved them? </font><sup><font size="-2">(1)</font></sup>
 <br><sup><font size="+1">The king (to the vizier): is `Alawi true about what
 sunnis said about `Uthmán gathering Quran?</font></sup>
 <br><sup><font size="+1">Vizier: that's what the interpreters and the historians
 said.</font></sup>
 <br><sup><font size="+1">`Alawi: you should know O king that shiites say
 that the Quran was gathered at the time of the prophet as you see it now,
 and no single letter was missed nor added to it, but sunnis say that Quran
 was added to and some of it was dropped and the prophet didn't gather it
 but it was gathered by `Uthmán when he became a ruler.</font></sup>
 <p><sup><font size="-2">(1): historians mention that `Uthmán gathered
 the holy books and then burnt it - to mock at it - and so did Al-Bukhári
 mention in his book in the section of virtues of Quran, and Al-Bayhaqi
 in his book [Al-Sunan] part 2, page 41, and Kanz Al-`Ummál part
 1, page 281, and Al-Taháwi in Mashkal Al-Áthár part
 3, page 4. And Oh my God, is the burner of the Quran deserves to be a ruler?
 What crime can be more awful than this? (the publisher)</font></sup>
 <br>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási (and he wanted to take the opportunity):
 did you hear O king? This man doesn't call `Uthmán a caliph, but
 he calls him a ruler [meaning a ruler like any ruler and not a legal caliph
 assigned by muslims].</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: yes, `Uthmán was not a caliph.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: why?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: because shiites believe that the rule of Abu-Bakr
 and `Umar and `Uthmán is illegal!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king (surprised): why?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: because `Uthmán became a ruler by the
 votes of six men designated by `Umar and all of them didn't vote for `Uthmán
 except of two or three of them, so the legitimacy of `Uthmán depends
 on `Umar, and `Umar became a ruler by the will of Abu-Bakr, so the legitimacy
 of `Umar depends on Abu-Bakr, and Abu-Bakr became a ruler depending on
 the votes a small group by threatening and force, so the legitimacy of
 Abu-Bakr depends on force and for this `Umar said about him: the agreement
 of people for Abu-Bakr to be a ruler was something of the age of ignorance
 [meaning something barbarous from the era before Islam], may God protect
 muslims against it and if someone did it again then kill him</font><sup><font size="-2">(1)
 </font></sup><font size="+1">and
 Abu-Bakr himself used to say:</font>

 <br><font size="+1">spare me for I'm not the best of you and Ali is the best
 within you</font><sup><font size="-2">(1)</font></sup><font size="+1"> and
 for this reason shiites believe that the rule of these is illegal in origin.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king (to the vizier): is it true what `Alawi is saying
 about the talk of Abu-Bakr and `Uthmán?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: yes, this is what the historians mentioned!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: then why do we respect these three?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: following the steps of the good ancestors!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi (to the king): O king, say to the vizier: is truth
 worthy to be followed or the ancestors? Is not following the ancestors
 is against the truth as it is included in God's saying (Nay, for they say
 only: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion, and we are guided
 by their footprints, 43:22)!?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king (to `Alawi): if these three are not the successors
 of the prophet of God then who is the (rightful) successor?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: the successor of the prophet is imam Ali ben
 Abi Tálib.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: and why he is a caliph?</font>
 <p><font size="-2">(1): this speech was mentioned by Al-Qawshaji, the sunni
 scholar in his book "Sharh Al-Tajreed."</font>
 <br>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: because the prophet assigned him to be a caliph
 after him</font><sup><font size="-2">(1)</font></sup><font size="+1"> where
 he (the prophet PUH) pointed out that he (imam Ali) shall be the caliph
 many times, and one of these times is when he (PUH) gathered people in
 a place between Mecca and Medina called "Ghadeer Khum" and then he raised
 the hand of Ali and said to muslims: he whoever I'm his ruler, then this
 is Ali his ruler, O God be on the side of he who is on his side and be
 an enemy to him who becomes his enemy and be helps who helps him and let
 down who lets him down, and the he (the prophet) got down from the pulpit
 and said to muslims -who counted as much as 120,000 persons- : greet Ali
 by the name of the caliph of believers, so muslims came one by one and
 they said to Ali: peace upon you O prince of believers, and then came Abu-Bakr
 and `Umar and greeted Ali (PUH) by the name of the prince of believers
 and `Umar said: peace upon you O prince of believers, Bakhin Bakhin [bakhin
 bakhin is an expression of congratulating in Arabic] for you O son of Abu
 Tálib, you became my prince and the prince of every believing man
 and woman</font><sup><font size="-2">(2)</font></sup><font size="+1">. Then:

 say that the Quran was edited.</font>

 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: didn't you say in your own books that some phrases
 about the idols were revealed upon the prophet and then these phrases were
 erased and canceled out of Quran?</font>

 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: yes, that is what was mentioned by historians.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: then how come we depend on a Quran that was
 changed?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: you should know O king that we don't say such
 a thing, but this is the claim of sunnis, and thus Quran for us is dependable
 but
 <hr width="100%"> for sunnis it is undependable.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: some reported speeches (from the prophet)
 were mentioned by your own ulema and in your books.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: first of all these speeches are few, secondly:
 they are fake and were made up by the enemies of shiites to lower down
 the reputation of shiites, and thirdly: the reporters of such speeches
 and their chains are incorrect, and what is mentioned by some ulema is
 undependable, but our great ulema that we depend on do not say such a thing
 and never mention that God praised the idols and said (and forbid that
 He might say such a thing): these are the great idols, from which forgiveness
 is asked.</font>

 for him.</font>

 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: like they say: God is a body, and He, like the
 human being, laughs and cries and He has a hand and a leg and an eye and
 a private part and will get His leg into the hell in judgment's day, and
 He will come down from heaven to the earth on a donkey!</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: and what's wrong with that, and Quran
 says (And thy Lord shall come, 89:22) and also says (On the day when it
 He uncovers a leg, 68:42) [the English translation of Quran does not mention
 the word "leg" but original Quran says the word "leg"] and also (The Hand
 of Allah is above their hands 48:10), and the Sunna mentioned that God
 will put His leg into hell!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: what was mentioned in Sunna and Hadith is false
 for us and bunch of lies, because Abu-Hurayrah and his likes lied about
 the prophet (PUH) and even `Umar banned Abu-Hurayrah from reporting Hadith

 of Abu-Hurayrah.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: because the ulema depended on his reported speeches.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: then, ulema must know better than `Umar because
 `Umar banned Abu-Hurayrah from reporting Hadith because he told the lies
 about the prophet but the ulema take his fabricated hadith?!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: suppose - O `Alawi - that the speeches
 about God are not true, but what do you do with the quranic phrases?</font>

 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: Quran contains complete phrases and others that
 are similar and it has the apparent and the hidden, so the apparent complete
 is worked with, but the similar should be interpreted according to the
 basics of the language and the figurative speech and antonomasia, otherwise
 the meaning will not be acceptable by the mind and the law, so for example:
 if you considered the phrase (And thy Lord shall come, 89:22) by its apparent
 meaning then you came against the mind and the law, because mind and law
 say that God is everywhere and there is no place that is without God, and
 the apparent meaning of the phrase tells that God is a body, and the body
 occupies a space and a place, and that means if God is in heavens then
 He is not on earth and if He is on earth, then heavens shall be out of
 Him, and this is not true neither by mind nor the law.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási got confused by this rightful logic and
 was puzzled to answer and then he said: I don't accept this talk, we should
 take the apparent meaning of the phrases of Quran.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: then what do you do with the similar phrases??
 Then, you can't take the apparent meaning of the whole Quran, otherwise
 your friend sheikh Ahmad `Uthmán  (and he was one of the sunni
 ulema and he was blind) who is sitting beside you should be in hell?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: why?</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: because God says (Whoso is blind here will be
 blind in the Hereafter, and yet further from the road, 17:72), and since
 sheikh Ahmad is blind now in this life then he shall blind in the Hereafter
 and yet further from the road, so do you accept that sheikh Ahmad?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Sheikh Ahmad: no, no, what is meant by "blind" in this
 phrase is the one who is astraying away from the path of truth.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: then, it is proved that one cannot work with
 the apparent meaning of the whole Quran.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Here, the debate was fierce about the apparent meanings
 of the Quran, and `Alawi gave many clues to `Abbási that made him
 speechless, until the king said: leave this topic and move to another.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: and one of your innovations -you sunnis- about
 God that you say that God forces the slaves (humans) to make the sins and
 the taboo and then judge them for it?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: that is true, because God say (He whom
 Allah sendeth astray, 4:88 and others) and also (Allah hath sealed their
 hearts, 9:93).</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: about what you said that is it in Quran, the
 answer to that is: Quran has many figurative language usages that must
 be explained,
 <hr width="100%"> so the meaning of "astraying" is that God leaves
 the wicked person and does not care about him until he goes astraying,
 and this is like when we say (the government spoiled the people), and that
 means that the government left the people and did not take care of them
 , this is first. Secondly, didn't you hear God's saying (Allah, verily,
 enjoineth not lewdness, 7:28) and also (Lo! We have shown him the way,
 whether he be grateful or disbelieving, 76:3) also (And guide him to the
 parting of the mountain ways, 90:10). Thirdly, it is not acceptable logically
 that God orders people to do the sin and then punish for it, because this
 is even far away from the habit of the normal people then how come it is
 something for God the Exalted and the Just, Exalted He is and Sanctified
 from what the disbelievers and the unjust say and High Exalted above what
 they say.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: no, no, is it impossible that God forces the
 human to do the sin and then punish him, this is exactly the wrong, and
 God is Exalted from being unjust and corrupt (Allah is no oppressor of
 (His) bondmen), but I don't think that sunnis follow the argument of `Abbási?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Then he asked the vizier and said: do sunnis follow that?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: yes, this is what is known among the sunnis!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: how come they say what is against the logic?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: they have interpretations and clues.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: whatever interpretation and clue is that it
 is impossible</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">for me to see and accept except of what `Alawi said about
 that God never forces anyone to do the sin and then punishes for it!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: then, sunnis also say that the prophet (PUH)
 was doubtful about his prophecy.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: this is an apparent lie.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: don't you say in your own books that the prophet
 of God said "every time that Gabriel does not come down for me, I think
 that he got down on Ibn Al-Khattáb [meaning `Umar]," and you should
 know that there are many holy phrases that points out that God made a covenant
 with the prophet Mohammed (PUH) for his prophecy?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king (to the vizier): is it true what `Alawi is saying
 about this hadith being in the books of sunnis?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: yes, it is in some books</font><sup><font size="-2">(1)</font></sup><font size="+1">.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: this is truly a disbelief.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: and sunnis also say in their books that the prophet
 (PUH) used to carry `Á'ishah [one of the prophet's wives] on his
 shoulders to watch the flute players and drum players, so is that suitable
 for the situations and the level of the prophet of God?</font>
 <p><font size="-2">(1): mentioned by Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed Al-Mu`tazali in Sharh
 Al-Manhaj, and others</font>
 <br>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: this is not harmful.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: do you do that and you are a normal person, do
 you carry your wife upon your shoulders to watch the players?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: he who was the least shyness and jealousy won't
 allow such a thing, then how is it with the prophet with all his faith.
 Is it true that such a thing is there in the books of sunnis?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: yes, it is in some books!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: how come we believe in a prophet that doubts
 about his prophecy?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: this hadith should be interpreted?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: does this hadith require an interpretation? Do
 you know now O king that sunnis believe in such innovations and lies?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: what lies do you mean?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: I've explained to you now that you say:</font>
 <br><font size="+1">1. God is like human who has a hand and a leg and moves
 and settles down.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">2. Quran had been edited.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">3. The prophet does what even normal people never do
 like carrying `Á'ishah on his shoulders.</font>
 <br>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">4. The prophet was doubtful about his prophecy.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">5. Who came to the throne before Ali ben Abi Tálib,
 used force and the sword to prove themselves and they are not legitimate
 (to be rulers).</font>
 <br><font size="+1">6. Your books tell hadith from Abu-Hurayrah and his likes
 of liars and such lies.</font>
 <p><font size="+1">The king: leave this topic and move to another.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: and then, sunnis claim about the prophet (PUH)
 what is not appropriate even for the normal man!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: like what?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: like claiming that the phrase (He frowned and
 turned away, 80:1) [the holy phrases continue and talk about a blind man]
 was revealed about the prophet!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: and what is wrong with that?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: it is wrong because God said (And lo! thou art
 of a tremendous nature, 68:4) [and in my own translation the phrase would
 be more like: thou art of great manners] and also (We sent thee not save
 as a mercy for the peoples, 21:107). Is it reasonable that the prophet
 who is described by God to be of a tremendous nature (manners) and also
 a mercy for the peoples, is it reasonable that he does such a inhumane
 thing with the faithful blind man??</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: it is impossible that such a thing could be
 done by the messenger of humanity
 <hr width="100%">and the prophet of mercy, then `Alawi about whom these
 phrases were revealed?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: the correct hadiths that we have and are reported
 by the way of the Household of the prophet, them who Quran was revealed
 in their houses, all these hadiths say that it was revealed about `Uthmán
 ben `Affán [the third caliph], and that was when Ibn Um Maktoom
 [who was a blind man] met `Uthmán and `Uthmán turned back
 at him.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Here, Sayed Jamál Al-Deen (and he is one of the
 shiite ulema and was in the court) said: an incident happened with me about
 this phrase and that was when a christian scholar said to me: our prophet
 Jesus is better than your prophet Mohammed, so I said: why? He said: because
 your prophet was ill mannered and frowned for the blind men and turns back
 at them, while Jesus was good mannered and healed the blind and the leper.
 I said: O christian, you should know that we shiites say this phrase was
 revealed about `Uthmán ben `Affán and not about the prophet
 (PUH) and our prophet was good mannered with beautiful manners, and God
 said about him (And lo! thou art of a tremendous nature, 68:4) and also
 (We sent thee not save as a mercy for the peoples, 21:107). The christian
 said: I heard this talk I said to you from a preacher in a mosque in Baghdad!</font>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: what is known among us is that some of the ill
 narrators and those who have no conscious claimed that this story happened
 with the prophet to clean the record of `Uthmán ben `Affán
 , so they lied about the prophet just to make their caliphs and rulers
 like innocents!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: leave this topic and talk about another.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: shiites deny that the three caliphs were
 believers, and this is not true, because if they were not then why did
 the prophet allow them to marry his daughters?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: shiites believe that these -three- were not believers
 in heart and they got into Islam just by the tongue, and the great prophet
 (PUH) used to accept the Islam of anyone who testifies the two [meaning:
 testify that God is one and Mohammed is a prophet] even if he was a hypocrite
 and he used to treat all like muslims, so the relation between them and
 the prophet was in the way of this logic!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: what is your clue that Abu-Bakr was not
 a faithful?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: the apparent clues are a lot, and one of them
 is: he betrayed the prophet many times like when he disobeyed the prophet
 and didn't join the army of Usámah, and Quran foretold that he who
 disobeys the prophet is not a believer, God says (But nay, by thy Lord,
 they will not believe (in truth) until they make thee judge of what is
 in dispute between them and find within themselves no dislike of that which
 thou decidest, and submit with full submission, 4:65). So, Abu-Bakr disobeyed
 the command of the prophet and went against it so he is included in this
 holy phrase. Add to that, the prophet (PUH) damned him who lags behind
 from the army of Usámah and we mentioned before that Abu-Bakr lagged
 behind from the army of Usámah, so does the prophet damn a believer?
 Of course: no.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: so the argument of `Alawi about him [Abu-Bakr]
 that he was not a believer!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: sunnis got interpretations about his lagging.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: does interpretation push away what is prohibited?
 If we opened this door then every criminal shall have the excuse for his
 crime. So the thief shall say: I've stolen because I'm poor, and the drunk
 shall say: I've drunk because I have so much troubles, and the adulterer
 say this and that, and so the whole system will be shaken up and the people
 will dare more to disobey, no... no... interpretations are not useful for
 us.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The face of `Abbási turned red and was puzzled,
 what shall he say, and finally he said hardly: and what is the clue that
 `Umar was not a believer?</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: there are many clues, one of them is that he
 himself declared that he is not faithful!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: when?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: when he said (I was not doubtful about the prophecy
 of Mohammed like I was at the day of Hudaybiyyah) [Hudaybiyyah, a place
 in Saudi Arabia at which the prophet made a truce with the idolaters of
 Mecca] and his talk denotes that he was always doubtful about the prophecy
 of our prophet, and his doubt at the day of Hudaybiyyah was even deeper,
 so tell me -O `Abbási- by God, he who is doubtful about the prophecy
 of Mohammed (PUH) is considered a believer?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási went silent and looked down.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king (to the vizier): is `Alawi right about what
 `Umar said?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: this is what was said by the narrators!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: amazing... so amazing... I used to consider
 `Umar one of first muslims, and used to consider his faith to be a unique
 one and now I see that his faith was mixed with doubt!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: hold on O king and stay on your creed,
 and don't be tricked by this lying `Alawi.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king turned his face away from `Abbási and
 said with anger: the vizier</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">Nizam Al-Mulk say that `Alawi is true about his argument,
 and the talk of `Umar is mentioned in the books and this idiot -`Abbási-
 say that he is a liar, isn't that exactly what is meant by stubbornness?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The court went under a deep silence, because the king
 was greatly annoyed by what `Abbási said... and `Abbási looked
 down with the rest of the sunni ulema... and the vizier went silent...
 and `Alawi remained looking up at the face of the king to see the result.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">They were hard moments for `Abbási, and he wished
 that earth would split and swallow him down, or the angel of death would
 come down and take his soul out for the embarrassment and the critical
 situation, for the falsehood of his creed showed up in front of the king
 and the vizier and the rest of ulema and generals... but what shall he
 do? The king brought him here to ask and answer and to know truth from
 the falsehood, and for this, he gathered his power and looked up and said:
 and how do you say O `Alawi that `Uthmán was not a believer at heart
 while the prophet made him marry both his daughters Ruqayyah and Um-Kalthoom?
 [notice that recent studies point out that probably the prophet never hard
 these daughters but they are merely made up names].</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: the clues about his ill faith and it is enough
 to say that muslims -including the companions- gathered and killed him,
 and you say</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">that the prophet said: my nation never gathers upon a
 wrong matter, so do muslims -including the companions- gather to kill a
 believer? And `Á'ishah used to compare him with jews and ordered
 to kill him and said: kill Na`thal -a name of a jew man- because he is
 a disbeliever, kill Na`thal may God kill him</font><sup><font size="-2">(1)</font></sup><font size="+1">,
 damned he may be. Also, `Uthmán beat `Abdullah ben Mas`ood the great
 companion until he got hernia and made him remain in bed until he died.
 Also, he deported Abu-Ðar Al-Ghifári, that great companion that
 the prophet said about him (no green cover made a shade for nor the desert
 carried someone that has a truthful tongue more than Abu-Ðar), and
 he deported him away from Medina to Shám [Shám: lands of
 Syria and the surroundings] for once or twice and then to Al-Rabaðah,
 and it is a dry land between Mecca and Medina - until Abu-Ðar died
 out of hunger and thirst - at the time that `Uthmán was spreading
 the treasury of muslims over his relatives of umayyads and marwanids!</font>
 <p><font size="-2">(1): Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed Al-Mu`tazali said in Sharh Nahj
 Al-Balaghah part 2, page77: everyone who wrote history and made classifications
 about it mentioned that `Á'ishah was one of the fiercest people
 over `Uthmán  and she got one of the prophet's shirts and made
 a stand for it in her house and used to say to whoever comes in: this is
 the shirt of the prophet did not decay and `Uthmán made his own
 clothes decay.</font>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">The king (to the vizier): is `Alawi true about what he
 said?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: historians mentioned that!</font><sup><font size="-2">(1)</font></sup>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: how come then muslims claimed him a caliph?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: by voting.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: wait O vizier, don't say what is untrue!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: what are you saying O `Alawi?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: the vizier made a mistake in his talk, because
 `Uthmán came to the throne by the will of `Umar and the votes of
 three hypocrites and they are: Talhah, and Sa`ad ben Abi Waqás and
 `Abdul-Rahmán ben `Awf, so do these three resemble all muslims?
 And then, historians mention that these who voted, changed their minds
 about `Uthmán</font>
 <p><font size="-2">(1): Historians mentioned that `Uthmán gave `Abdullah
 ben Khálid ben Usayd 400,000 dirham, and Al-Hakam ben Al-`Ás
 -who was deported by the prophet- 100,000 dirham, and gave the land of
 Fadak to Marwán ben Al-Hakam, and the land of Fadak was for Fatima
 [the daughter of the prophet] but it was taken by force by Abu-Bakr and
 `Umar, and then it was given by `Uthmán to Marwán - and also
 gave `Abdullah ben Ubay the fifth of Africa in the same day that he gave
 Marwán 100,000 dirham, and all of that was out of the treasury of
 muslims. Get back to the details in Sharh Nahj Al-Balaghah for Ibn Abi

 to stir up people to kill `Uthmán!</font>

 in paradise for someone who hurt him and that is Talhah? Some historians
 and interpreters mentioned that Talhah said: if Mohammed died we shall
 marry his wives after him -or- I shall marry `Á'ishah, so the prophet
 was hurt a lot by the talk of Talhah and God revealed the phrase (And it
 is not for you to cause annoyance to the messenger of Allah, nor that ye
 should ever marry his wives after him. Lo! that in Allah's sight would
 be an enormity, 33:53).</font>

 in paradise? Is the fighter against the truth and Quran is considered a

 so is it possible that `Uthmán and Talhah and Zubayr are all in

 and `Abbási went silent and didn't say a thing. What shall they

 in my speech and talk and how true is my argument, and if they denied this,
 then in Baghdad there are ulema that testify for my argument to be true,
 and in the stores of this school there are books that testify that my argument

 companions of the prophet (PUH)!</font>

 sunnis did so. Second, those who believed in their ruling are divided into
 two: an ignorant and a stubborn, as for the ignorant one he does not know

 as for the stubborn one, clues and proves are not useful with him as long

 from God the Exalted, and that is Ali ben Abi Tálib, and they (shiites)
 left others.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: but Ali ben Abi Tálib was not
 appropriate to be a caliph, because he was young while Abu-Bakr was older,
 and Ali ben Abi Tálib killed the bravest arabs, so arabs wouldn't
 accept him, while Abu-Bakr was not like that!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: did you hear O king? `Abbási is saying
 that people know more than God and His prophet in appointing the best,
 because he doesn't follow what was appointed by God and His prophet (PUH)
 about Ali ben Abi Tálib, but follows what some people say about
 Abu-Bakr. Like if God does not know what is best, until some ignorant people
 come and choose the best? Did not God say (And it becometh not a believing
 man or a believing woman, when Allah and His messenger have decided an
 affair (for them), that they should (after that) claim any say in their
 affair; and whoso is rebellious to Allah and His messenger, he verily goeth

 the prophet appointed one person for the caliphate and to be an imam, so
 you should follow it, either you are satisfied with it or not!</font>

 Tálib were few.</font>

 did not know who is Ali ben Abi Tálib exactly, so he didn't know
 that his qualifications were few and for this He appointed him as a caliph

 to be a caliph and an imam were abundant in Ali ben Abi Tálib, while
 others did not have such qualifications!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: and what are these qualifications -for
 example-?</font>

 all is that he was appointed by God and His prophet (PUH). Secondly, he

 idols and God said (My covenant includeth not wrong-doers, 2:124), and

 to take the covenant of God, that is, the prophecy or being caliph. Fifthly:
 Ali ben Abi Tálib was one of right mind and an open mind and a right
 opinion that originated from Islam, while others had opinions originating
 from Satan, and so Abu-Bakr said (I have a satan that wears me) and `Umar

 `Umar disobeyed the prophet in many occasions, like:</font>
 <br><font size="+1">1. when the prophet wanted to pray upon `Abdullah ben
 Ubay, when `Umar replied back the prophet with a harsh answer and the prophet
 was hurt from that and God says (Those who vex the messenger of Allah,

 <br><font size="+1">2. when the prophet (PUH) ordered to separate `Umrat
 Al-Tamattu` and Hajj Al-Tamattu` [two duties of pilgrimage] and he (PUH)
 allowed that a man can reach his wife between the both duties, then `Umar
 refused that and said this hideous sentence (shall we prepare for pilgrimage
 and our organs are still dropping the semen?) and the prophet answered
 him: you never believed in it, and by that sentence the prophet (PUH) made
 him know himself that he is one of those who believe in some and neglect
 some.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">3. about the Mut`ah marriage [Mut`ah marriage is a type
 of temporal marriage] when he did not believe in it, and when he came to
 the throne by force he said (2 Mut`as that were at the time of the prophet
 and now I ban them and punish for them) while God says (And those of whom
 ye seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions as a
 duty, 4:24) [the English translation doesn't bring the real meaning as
 in the original Arabic text where the action of Mut`ah is obvious], and
 interpreters said that it was revealed about allowing Mut`ah marriage,
 and muslims used to do that until the days of `Umar, and when `Umar banned
 it, adultery increased among muslims</font><sup><font size="-2">(1)</font></sup><font size="+1">,
 and by doing this `Umar stopped working with one law of God and His prophet
 (PUH) and made the way open for adultery! and got himself included in the
 phrases (Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed: such are
 disbelievers...wrong-doers...evil-livers, 5:44,45,47).</font>
 <p><font size="-2">(1): as reported from imam Ali ben Abi Tálib (PUH)
 that he said: if it was not for `Umar banning Mut`ah, then no one would
 commit adultery except of the unblest.</font>

 <br><font size="+1">4. in the occasion of Hudaybiyyah as mentioned before.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">and in some other occasions where `Umar used to refuse

 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: do you admit that it is an islamic law or not?</font>

 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: then what's the meaning of the phrase (And those
 of whom ye seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions
 as a duty, 4:24)? and what is the meaning of `Umar's saying (2 Mut`as..etc)?
 Does not the saying of `Umar point out that the marriage of Mut`ah was
 allowed during the time of the prophet, and even at the days of Abu-Bakr,
 and part of the time of `Umar and then he banned it? Adding to that other
 clues and they are a lot, O king, `Umar himself used to marriage in Mut`ah
 and `Abdullah ben Al-Zubayr was born from Mut`ah!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: what do you say O vizier?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: the clue of `Alawi is correct, but since `Umar
 banned it, we should follow him.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: is God and the prophet are better to be followed
 or `Umar? Hadn't you read, O vizier, God's saying (And whatsoever the messenger
 giveth you, take it 59:7) and (and obey the messenger, 5:92, and many others),
 and also (Verily in the messenger of Allah ye have a good example, 33:21)
 and also the famous hadith (the allowed thing of Mohammed is allowed until
 the judgment day and the taboo of Mohammed is taboo until the judgment
 day)?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: I believe in all of the laws of Islam, but
 I don't understand why Mut`ah is allowed, for does any of you desires to
 give his daughter or his sister to a man, to enjoy with her for one hour,
 isn't that hideous?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: and what do you say about that O king: does someone
 want to give his daughter or his sister for normal marriage for a man,
 while he knows that she will be divorced after one hour?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: I don't want that.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: although sunnis believe that such normal marriage
 is correct, and the divorce in that case is correct too, and the difference
 between Mut`ah and normal marriage is that Mut`ah is over when its assigned
 time is up and the normal marriage is over by divorce, and in other words:
 Mut`ah marriage is like a contract of renting, and normal marriage is like
 a contract of ownership, when renting is over by the end of the assigned
 time and the ownership could be over by selling -for example-! Then, allowing
 Mut`ah is correct because it is for satisfying one of the needs of the
 body.</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">Like how the normal marriage which ends by divorce is
 correct because it is a way to satisfy one of the needs of the body. Then
 I shall ask you O king, what do you say about those widows who lost their
 husbands and none came to marry them, isn't Mut`ah is the only solution
 for them to protect them from adultery and mischief? Isn't it by Mut`ah
 that they can get some money for themselves and to take care of their orphans?
 And what do you say about the young people and the men that their circumstances
 doesn't allow them to get married, isn't Mut`ah is the only solution for
 them to get rid of the tremendous sexual force?! And to protect them against
 mischief? Isn't Mut`ah better than adultery, and sodomy and the secret
 habit [masturbation]? I think - O king - that every crime of adultery or
 sodomy or a masturbation that happens between people is because of `Umar,
 and he shares its badness, because he is the one who banned it! And there
 are many news that tells how adultery increased among people since `Umar
 banned Mut`ah!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">and your saying - O king - that you don't want to ...etc,
 well, Islam did not force anyone to do so, and did not force you to let
 your daughter get married for someone that you know he will divorce her
 after one hour of marriage, beside that, your desire and the desire of
 people of not wanting this, that is not a base for making something a taboo,
 because the law of God is fixed and does not change by opinions and desires!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king (to the vizier): the clue of `Alawi about Mut`ah
 is strong!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: but the ulema followed `Umar.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: first, the ulema who followed `Umar are the sunni
 ones only and not all of them, second, the law of God and His prophet is
 the one to follow or `Umar's? Third, your ulema went against the law of
 `Umar by themselves.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: how?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: because `Umar said (2 Mut`as that were at the
 time of the prophet and I ban them: Hajj Al-Tamattu` and Mut`ah marriage),
 so if the argument of `Umar was right then why didn't your ulema follow
 his argument in Hajj Al-Tamattu`? While your ulema went against `Umar and
 said that Hajj Al-Tamattu` is correct, although `Umar banned it! And if
 the argument of `Umar is false then why did your ulema follow his argument
 about Mut`ah marriage?</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">The vizier went silent.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king (to the attendance): why don't you answer `Alawi?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Then said one of the shiites ulema and his name was sheikh
 Hasan Qásimi: the problem of `Umar and them who followed him is
 obvious, thus, these people - O king - have no answer for `Alawi, may God
 save him.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: then leave this topic and talk about something
 else.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: these shiites claim that `Umar has no
 virtue, and it is enough for him that he made all of these invasions for
 the islamic state.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: we have answers for that:</font>
 <br><font size="+1">first: rulers and kings invade the land to expand their
 territories, so is this a virtue?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">second: if we believed that his invasions were a virtue,
 but do these invasions excuse him for taking the caliphate by force? And
 the situation is that the prophet (PUH) did not assign him to be a caliph
 but gave that position to Ali ben Abi Tálib (PUH)... for if you
 - O king - assigned a successor for yourself, and then someone came and
 took that place instead of your assigned successor, and then he
 <hr width="100%">made the invasions and did the good deeds, would be satisfied
 with his invasions or shall you be angry at him, because he took the place
 of your own successor and isolated your successor without your permission?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: I shall be angry at him and his invasions do
 not wash his crime!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: and so did `Umar, he took the place of the caliphate
 and sat in the place of the prophet without the prophet's permission!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">third: the invasions of `Umar were wrong and it had a
 negative effect, because the prophet (PUH) never attacked anyone, but his
 wars were for defence only, and that's why people liked Islam and got into
 the religion of God in large numbers because they knew that Islam is a
 religion of peace, but as for `Umar he attacked the lands and got them
 into Islam by force and the sword, and for this people hated Islam and
 claimed that it is the religion of the sword and the force, and not the
 religion of logic and easiness and that was the cause for the many enemies
 of Islam, so: the invasions of `Umar corrupted the reputation of Islam
 and gave a negative reversed effect. And if Abu-Bakr and `Umar and `Uthmán
 did not take the caliphate for themselves from the true imam, imam Ali
 (PUH), and if the imam was
 <hr width="100%">taking care of the caliphate directly after the prophet,
 then he would be walking on the steps of the prophet and apply his right
 methods, and that would be a source for getting more people into Islam,
 and the expansion of Islam would reach the whole earth! But, there is no
 might save but by Allah.</font>
 <br><font size="+1">Here, `Alawi took a deep breath and moaned from the depth
 of his heart and hit one hand over the other for his sorrow about Islam
 and what happened to it after the death of the prophet (PUH) because of
 taking the caliphate from its rightful owner: imam Ali (PUH).</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king (to `Abbási): what is your answer to
 `Alawi's talk?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: I've never heard such a thing before!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: now since you've heard it and knew the truth,
 leave your caliphs and follow the rightful caliph for the prophet (PUH)
 Ali ben Abi Tálib (PUH). Then he continued: amazing is your logic
 O sunnis, you forget the origin and take the branch.</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: how is that?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: because you mention the invasions of `Umar and
 forget the invasions of Ali (PUH)!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: and what are the invasions of Ali ben
 Abi Tálib?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: most of the invasions of the prophet were done
 by the hand of Ali ben Abi Tálib like Badr and Khaybar and Hunayn
 and Uhud and Al-Khandaq and others... and if it was not for these invasions
 (battles) that formed the base for Islam, there wouldn't be `Umar, nor
 Islam nor a faith, and the clue to that is when the prophet (PUH) said
 -when Ali went to fight `Amr ben `Abd-Wid at the battle of Khandaq- (all
 the faith went to all of the disbelief, my Lord, if You want not to be
 worshipped then it shall be), meaning that if Ali was killed then the disbelievers
 shall dare to kill me and kill all the muslims, and thus there shall be
 no faith and no Islam. Also he (PUH) said (the strike of Ali at the day
 of Khandaq is better than the worshipping of the two created [meaning human,
 and djinn])</font><sup><font size="-2">(1)</font></sup><font size="+1">, so

 do you hate Abu-Bakr?</font>

 <br><font size="+1">The king: and what is his crime?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: his crime is: Abu-Bakr sent him to the great
 companion Málik ben Nuwayrah -the one who the prophet (PUH) told
 him that he shall be in paradise- and he (Abu-Bakr) ordered hi (Khalid)
 to kill Málik and his people, and Málik was out of Medina,
 so when he saw Khalid coming to him with a small army, Málik commanded
 his people to carry the weapons,</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">and so they did, and when Khalid reached them he tricked
 them and lied and swore to them by God that he is not going to harm them,
 and said to them: we are not here to fight you but we are guests for tonight,
 and so Málik got relaxed -because Khalid swore- and he put down
 the weapons with his people, and when it was the time to pray and Málik
 with his people stood up to pray they were attacked by Khalid and his army
 and got them tied and then killed them all, and then Khalid got greedy
 for the wife of Málik (when he saw that she's beautiful) and he
 raped her in the same night in which he killed her husband, and he made
 the head of her husband and his people as stones for the kettle to cook
 the food of his crime and ate with his army! and when Khalid got back to
 Medina, `Umar wanted to apply the law against him for killing muslims and
 for raping the wife of Málik, but Abu-Bakr (the believer!) denied
 that extremely, and by his deed he let go of the blood of the muslims and
 stopped a law of God!</font>

 Fatima and Ali (PUT) and `Umar gathered the wood on the door of Fatima
 (that door that many times the prophet stood in front of it and said: Peace
 upon you O Household of prophecy, and didn't get inside unless he asked
 for permission) and he burnt the door with fire, and when Fatima came behind
 the door to stop `Umar from doing this with his followers, he squeezed
 her between the wall and the door so hard that she had abortion and a nail
 from the door planted in her chest and Fatima screamed: O father, O messenger
 of God, look what happened to us after you from Ibn Al-Khattáb [meaning
 `Umar] and Ibn Abi-Quháfah [meaning Abu-Bakr]! `Umar then looked
 around him and said: beat Fatima, so the lashes came down on the beloved
 of the prophet (PUH) until the blood gushed out from her body! And the
 effects of this squeeze and this shock remained drilling in the body of
 Fatima, and she became sick and sad until she left this life after her
 father within some days - thus, Fatima is the martyr of the Household of
 the prophecy, and Fatima was killed...</font>
 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">because of `Umar ben Al-Khattáb!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king (to the vizier): is what `Alawi saying true?</font>

 is talking about!</font><sup><font size="-2">(1)</font></sup>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: and that's why shiites hate Abu-Bakr and `Umar!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi added: and the clue that this crime did happen
 by the hands of Abu-Bakr and `Umar, is that historians mentioned that Fatima
 died and she was angry at Abu-Bakr and `Umar and the prophet (PUH) mentioned
 in many occasions the hadith (God is satisfied for the satisfaction of
 Fatima and angry for her anger) and you O king know exactly what happens
 to someone that gets the wrath of God!?</font>

 it true that Fatima died and she was angry at Abu-Bakr and `Umar?</font>

 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: yes, that was mentioned by scholars of Hadith

 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: and the clue for my argument: is that Fatima
 told Ali ben Abi Tálib (PUH) to not let Abu-Bakr and `Umar and the
 rest of those who wronged her attend her funeral, so they don't pray upon
 her, and never attend her burial, and to hide her tomb so that they don't
 attend to her grave, and imam Ali (PUH) did exactly what she asked for!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: this is weird, was such a thing done by Ali
 and Fatima?</font>

 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: the books of history mentioned that the prophet
 of God (PUH) gave Fadak to Fatima</font><font size="-2">(1)</font><font size="+1">
 so Fadak was in her hand -at the days of the prophet- and when the prophet
 died, Abu-Bakr and `Umar sent people to deport the workers of Fatima from
 Fadak by the sword and the force, and Fatima protested against Abu-Bakr
 and `Umar but they didn't listen to her, and even restrained her, and for
 this she never talked to them until she died with anger on them!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: but `Umar ben `Abdul `Aziz [an umayyad
 ruler, almost ruled from 717AD-720AD] turned Fadak back to the children
 of Fatima -during his reign-?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: and what is the use of that? If someone took
 your home by force and made you astray and then another man came after
 you die and gave back the home to your children, does that clear out the
 sin of the first aggressor?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: it is apparent from your speech you two - `Abbási
 and `Alawi - that you agree that Abu-Bakr and `Umar took by force the land
 of Fadak?</font>
 <p><font size="-2">(1): Fadak is a name for a land between Medina and Khaybar
 and it was owned by the prophet and he gave it to his daughter Fatima (PUH).</font>

 <br><font size="+1">The king: and why did they do so?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: because they wanted to take the caliphate by
 force, and they knew that Fadak if it was to remain in the hands of Fatima
 then its production will be distributed (120,000 golden dinars as mentioned
 by some historians) among the people, and in that way people will gather
 around Ali (PUH), and this is what Abu-Bakr and `Umar hate!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: if these sayings are true then how strange
 is the situation of those! And if the leadership of these three was false,
 then who is the successor of the prophet (PUH)?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: the prophet himself -and by a command from God-
 assigned the successors after him, in the hadith that is mentioned in the
 books of hadith when he said (my successors after me are twelve, as much
 as the tribes of the Israelites and all of them from Quraysh) [Quraysh:

 after it had been full of unjust.</font>

 the age of Al-Mahdi [of course according to that time], and God says in
 Quran about the prophet Noah (and he continued with them for a thousand

 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: I save the creed of the public so that
 they don't incline toward the shiites because shiites are people of innovation!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: the respected books tell us that your imam (`Umar)
 was the first one to make an innovation in Islam and he declared that himself
 when he said (what a good innovation is this) and that was in the story
 of the prayer of Taráweeh [Taráweeh: a long prayer done during
 Ramadan by sunnis in groups after the last prayer at night] when he ordered
 people to pray the Nafilah [Nafilah: a type of prayer in Islam that is
 not part of the five daily prayers but prayed as a donation] in groups,
 while God and the prophet prohibited praying a Nafilah in groups, so the
 innovation of `Umar was an obvious disobedience for God and the prophet!</font><sup><font size="-2">(1)
 </font></sup><font size="+1">Then,
 did not `Umar make an innovation in the Aðán [Aðán:
 the call to pray] when he dropped (Come to the best of works)</font>

 prayer, Al-Sawá`iq, and Al-Qastaláni said in the book of
 Irshád Al-Sári fi Sharh Saheeh Al-Bukhári part 5,
 page4, when he reached `Umar saying (what a good innovation is this): he
 called it an innovation because the prophet of God did not assign it and
 it was not there at the time of Abu-Bakr and it was not at the beginning
 of the night and not in that much [meaning not that much rak`as, or the
 number of bows done by the prayer while he prays]. I say: yes, the caliph
 of muslims (!) innovate in religion - congratulations -.</font>

 <br><font size="+1">did not he innovate in not applying the law over the
 criminal and adulterer: Khalid ben Al-Waleed, in opposition to the command
 of God and His prophet about applying the law against the adulterer and
 the murderer?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">and so on with your innovations sunnis who follow `Umar.
 So, are you the people of innovation or is it us shiites?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king (to the vizier): is it true what `Alawi mentioned
 about the innovations of `Umar in religion?</font>
 <p><font size="-2">(1) Al-Qawshaji mentioned and he is one of the greatest
 sunni ulema that `Umar said: three were at the time of the prophet and
 I ban them and punish for them: Mut`ah marriage, and Hajj Al-Tamattu` and
 (come to the best of works), and imam Málik [a sunni scholar who
 established a sub-school] said in Al-Mawte' that he got tidings saying
 that the caller for the pray came to `Umar ben Al-Khattáb to tell
 him that morning prayer is up and he found him asleep, so he said to him:
 praying is better than sleeping, so `Umar ordered him to make it part of
 the call to the morning prayer! I say: oh my God, is `Umar allowed to add
 and drop from the call to the prayer -which is a part of the religion-
 by his own desires and thought? (the publisher)</font>
 <br>
 </p><hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">Vizier: yes, some ulema mentioned that in their books!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: then how do we follow someone that innovated
 in religion?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: for this reason, following a person like that
 is a taboo, because the prophet (PUH) said (every innovation is a misguide,
 and every misguide is in hell), so the people who follow `Umar in his innovations
 - and they know about it - they are - surely - people of hell!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: but the imams of the (islamic) schools
 (creeds) admitted the deed of `Umar?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: this is another innovation O king!</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: and how is that?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: because those who established these schools and
 they are: Abu Haneefah, Málik ben Anas, Al-Sháfi`i, and Ahmad
 ben Hanbal were not at the time of the prophet (PUH), but they came after
 him by almost 200 years, so were the muslims in that time between the prophet
 and those people all misguided? and what is the necessity of gathering
 all the creeds and ways in these four only and neglecting others? did the
 prophet advise so?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">The king: what do you say `Abbási?</font>

 <hr width="100%">
 <br><font size="+1">The king: were there no wise man except of those?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Abbási: but shiites also follow the creed of
 Ja`far Al-Sádiq [Jafar Al-Sádiq: the 6th imam for twelve
 shiites]?</font>
 <br><font size="+1">`Alawi: we follow the school of Jafar because his way
 is the way of the prophet of God, because he is one of the Household whom
 God said about them (Allah's wish is but to remove uncleanness far from
 you, O Folk of the Household, and cleanse you with a thorough cleansing,
 33:33), otherwise we follow all the twelve imams but since imam Jafar Al-Sádiq
 (PUH) was able to spread the knowledge and the interpretations and the
 holy hadiths more than other imams (because of some of the freedom at his
 time), and even 4000 pupils used to attend his school</font><sup><font size="-2">(1)</font></sup><font size="+1">,
 and even he was able to renew the structure of Islam after the trials of
 umayyads and abbasids to erase it, thus for this shiites were called "jafarites"
 [or Ja`fari] according to the one who restored the structure of the creed
 and that is imam Jafar Al-Sádiq (PUH).</font>

 that I cannot be the imam of time for the people, because I don't know
 anything, and I spend most of my time in hunting and in managing affairs!</font>

 who didn't know him died as an ignorant and he shall be in hell with the
 people of ignorance!</font>

 <br><font size="+1">you should know O people, that I'm satisfied with this
 debate (which lasted for three days) and I am sure now that the truth is
 with shiites in everything they say and believe in, and the sunnis are
 people of a false creed and an astraying belief, and I am one man that
 when recognizes the truth, shall obey it and admit it, and I shall not
 be a man of falsehood in this life and a man of hell in the Hereafter.
 For this, I announce in front of you that I've become a shiite, and who
 loves to be with me let him follow me and be a shiite, by the blessings
 of God and His mercy, and let himself be out from the darkness of the falsehood
 to the light of the truth!</font>

 the right school is the shiites' only. I knew that since I was a pupil,
 and for this I announce that I am too a shiite.</font>
 <p><font size="+1">Thus, most of the ulema and the ministers and the generals
 who attended in the court (and they counted almost as 70) got into the
 creed of shiites.</font>

 Nizam Al-Mulk and the ministers and the generals and the writers into shiites,
 reached all the lands, and many people got into the creed of shiites, and
 Nizam Al-Mulk ordered - and he is the father of my wife - that teachers
 should teach the creed of shiites in Nizamiyyah schools in Baghdad!</font>

 <br><font size="+1">But some sunni ulema that insisted on the falsehood remained
 on their creed like God said (became as rocks, or worse than rocks, for
 hardness, 2:74).</font>

 and blamed him for that because he was the planning mind for the land,
