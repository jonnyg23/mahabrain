 <p><a name="page_1262"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1262</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">Sūra XL.</h3>  <h3 align="center"><i>Mū-min,</i> or The Believer.</h3>  
 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
 <p>1. <i>Hā-Mīm</i>.</p>  
 <p>2. The revelation<br> Of this Book<br> Is from God,<br> Exalted in Power,<br> Full of Knowledge,—</p>  
 <p>3. Who forgiveth Sin,<br> Accepteth Repentance,<br> Is Strict in Punishment,<br> And hath a Long Reach<br> (In all things).<br> There is no god<br> But He: to Him<br> Is the Final Goal.</p>  
 <p>4. None can dispute<br> About the Signs of God<br> But the Unbelievers.<br> Let not, then,<br> Their strutting about<br> Through the land<br> Deceive thee!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1263"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1263</font></a></p>  
 <p>5. But (there were people) before them,<br> Who denied (the Signs),—<br> The People of Noah,<br> And the Confederates<br> (Of Evil) after them;<br> And every People plotted<br> Against their prophet,<br> To seize him, and disputed<br> By means of vanities,<br> Therewith to condemn<br> The Truth: but it was I<br> That seized them!<br> And how (terrible)<br> Was My Requital!</p>  
 <p>6. Thus was the Decree<br> Of thy Lord proved true<br> Against the Unbelievers<br> That truly they are<br> Companions of the Fire!</p>  
 <p>7. Those who sustain<br> The Throne (of God)<br> And those around it<br> Sing Glory and Praise<br> To their Lord; believe<br> In Him; and implore Forgiveness<br> For those who believe:<br> "Our Lord! Thy Reach</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1264"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1264</font></a></p>  
 <p>Is over all things,<br> In Mercy and Knowledge.<br> Forgive, then, those who<br> Turn in Repentance, and follow<br> Thy Path; and preserve them<br> From the Penalty<br> Of the Blazing Fire!</p>  
 <p>8. "And grant, our Lord!<br> That they enter<br> The Gardens of Eternity,<br> Which Thou hast promised<br> To them, and to the righteous<br> Among their fathers,<br> Their wives, and their posterity!<br> For Thou art (He),<br> The Exalted in Might,<br> Full of Wisdom.</p>  
 <p>9. "And preserve them<br> From (all) ills;<br> And any whom Thou<br> Dost preserve from ills<br> That Day,—on them<br> Wilt Thou have bestowed<br> Mercy indeed: and that<br> Will be truly (for them)<br> The highest Achievement".</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>10. The Unbelievers will be<br> Addressed: "Greater was<br> The aversion of God to you<br> Than (is), your aversion</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1265"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1265</font></a></p>  
 <p>To yourselves, seeing that ye<br> Were called to the Faith<br> And ye used to refuse."</p>  
 <p>11. They will say: "Our Lord!<br> Twice hast Thou made us<br> Without life, and twice<br> Hast Thou given us Life!<br> Now have we recognised<br> Our sins: is there<br> Any way out (of this)?"</p>  
 <p>12. (The answer will be:)<br> "This is because, when<br> God was invoked as<br> The Only (object of worship),<br> Ye did reject Faith,<br> But when partners were<br> Joined to Him, ye believed!<br> The Command is with God,<br> Most High, Most Great!"</p>  
 <p>13. He it is Who showeth<br> You His Signs, and sendeth<br> Down Sustenance for you<br> From the sky: but only<br> Those receive admonition<br> Who turn (to God).</p>  
 <p>14. Call ye, then, upon God<br> With sincere devotion to Him,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1266"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1266</font></a></p>  
 <p>Even though the Unbelievers<br> May detest it.</p>  
 <p>15. Raised high above ranks<br> (Or degrees),<br> (He is) the Lord<br> Of the Throne (of authority):<br> By His Command doth He<br> Send the spirit (of inspiration)<br> To any of His servants<br> He pleases, that it may<br> Warn (men) of the Day<br> Of Mutual Meeting,—</p>  
 <p>16. The Day whereon<br> They will (all) come forth:<br> Not a single thing<br> Concerning them is hidden<br> From God. Whose will be<br> The Dominion that Day?<br> That of God, the One,<br> The Irresistible!</p>  
 <p>17. That Day will every soul<br> Be requited for what<br> It earned; no injustice<br> Will there be that Day,<br> For God is Swift<br> In taking account.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1267"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1267</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. Warn them of the Day<br> That is (ever) drawing near,<br> When the Hearts will<br> (Come) right up to the Throats<br> To choke (them);<br> No intimate friend<br> Nor intercessor will the<br> wrong-doers<br> Have, who could be<br> Listened to.</p>  
 <p>19. (God) knows of (the tricks)<br> That deceive with the eyes,<br> And all that the hearts<br> (Of men) conceal.</p>  
 <p>20. And God will judge<br> With (Justice and) Truth:<br> But those whom (men)<br> Invoke besides Him, will<br> Not (be in a position)<br> To judge at all.<br> Verily it is God (alone)<br> Who hears and sees<br> (All things).</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1268"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1268</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
 <p>21. Do they not travel<br> Through the earth and see<br> What was the End<br> Of those before them<br> They were even superior<br> To them in strength,<br> And in the traces (they<br> Have left) in the land:<br> But God did call them<br> To account for their sins,<br> And none had they<br> To defend them against God.</p>  
 <p>22. That was because there came<br> To them their apostles<br> With Clear (Signs),<br> But they rejected them:<br> So God called them<br> To account: for He is<br> Full of Strength,<br> Strict in Punishment.</p>  
 <p>23. Of old We sent Moses,<br> With Our Signs<br> And an Authority manifest,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1269"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1269</font></a></p>  
 <p>24. To Pharaoh, Hāmān,<br> And Qārūn; but they<br> Called (him) "a sorcerer<br> Telling lies!"…</p>  
 <p>25. Now, when he came to them<br> In Truth, from Us,<br> They said, "Slay the sons<br> Of those who believe a<br> With him, and keep alive<br> Their females," but the plots<br> Of Unbelievers (end) in nothing<br> But errors (and delusions)!…</p>  
 <p>26. Said Pharaoh: "Leave me<br> To slay Moses; and let him<br> Call on his Lord!<br> What I fear is lest<br> He should change your religion,<br> Or lest he should cause<br> Mischief to appear<br> In the land!"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1270"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1270</font></a></p>  
 <p>27. Moses said: "I have indeed<br> Called upon my Lord<br> And your Lord<br> (For protection) from every<br> Arrogant one who believes not<br> In the Day of Account!"</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
 <p>28. A Believer, a man<br> From among the people<br> Of Pharaoh, who had concealed<br> His faith, said: "Will ye<br> Slay a man because he<br> Says, "My Lord is God"?—<br> When he has indeed come<br> To you with Clear (Signs)<br> From your Lord? And if<br> He be a liar, on him<br> Is (the sin of) his lie;<br> But, if he is telling<br> The Truth, then will<br> Fall on you something<br> Of the (calamity) of which<br> He warns you: truly<br> God guides not one<br> Who transgresses and lies!</p>  
 <p>29. "O my People! yours<br> Is the dominion this day:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1271"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1271</font></a></p>  
 <p>Ye have the upper hand<br> In the land: but who<br> Will help us from<br> The Punishment of God,<br> Should it befall us?"<br> Pharaoh said: "I but<br> Point out to you that<br> Which I see (myself);<br> Nor do I guide you<br> But to the Path of Right!"</p>  
 <p>30. Then said the man<br> Who believed: "O my People!<br> Truly I do fear <br> For you something like<br> The Day (of disaster)<br> Of the Confederates (in sin)!—</p>  
 <p>31. "Something like the fate<br> Of the People of Noah,<br> The ‘Ād, and the <u>Th</u>amūd,<br> And those who came<br> After them: but God<br> Never wishes injustice<br> To His Servants.</p>  
 <p>32. "And O my People!<br> I fear for you a Day<br> When there will be<br> Mutual calling (and wailing),—</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1272"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1272</font></a></p>  
 <p>33. "A Day when ye<br> Shall turn your backs<br> And flee: no defender<br> Shall ye have from God:<br> Any whom God leaves<br> To stray, there is none<br> To guide…</p>  
 <p>34. "And to you there came<br> Joseph in times gone by,<br> With Clear Signs, but<br> Ye ceased not to doubt<br> Of the (mission) for which<br> He had come: at length,<br> When he died, ye said:<br> "No apostle will God send<br> After him." Thus doth God<br> Leave to stray such as<br> Transgress and live in doubt,—</p>  
 <p>35. "(Such) as dispute about<br> The Signs of God,<br> Without any authority<br> That hath reached them.<br> Grievous and odious<br> (Is such conduct)<br> In the sight of God<br> And of the Believers.<br> Thus doth God seal up<br> Every heart—of arrogant<br> And obstinate transgressors."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1273"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1273</font></a></p>  
 <p>36. Pharaoh said: "O Hāmān!<br> Build me a lofty palace,<br> That I may attain<br> The ways and means—</p>  
 <p>37. "The ways and means<br> Of (reaching) the heavens,<br> And that I may mount up<br> To the God of Moses:<br> But as far as I am concerned,<br> I think (Moses) is a liar!"<br> Thus was made alluring,<br> In Pharaoh's eyes,<br> The evil of his deeds,<br> And he was hindered<br> From the Path; and the plot<br> Of Pharaoh led to nothing<br> But perdition (for him).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
 <p>38. The man who believed said<br> Further: "O my People!<br> Follow me: I will lead<br> You to the Path of Right.</p>  
 <p>39. "O my People! This life<br> Of the present is nothing<br> But (temporary) convenience:<br> It is the Hereafter</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1274"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1274</font></a></p>  
 <p>That is the Home<br> That will last.</p>  
 <p>40. "He that works evil<br> Will not be requited<br> But by the like thereof:<br> And he that works<br> A righteous deed—whether<br> Man or woman—and is<br> A Believer—such will enter<br> The Garden (of Bliss): therein<br> Will they have abundance<br> Without measure.</p>  
 <p>41. "And O my People!<br> How (strange) it is<br> For me to call you<br> To Salvation while ye<br> Call me to the Fire!</p>  
 <p>42. "Ye do call upon me<br> To blaspheme against God,<br> And to join with Him<br> Partners of whom I have<br> No knowledge; and I<br> Call you to the Exalted<br> In Power, Who forgives<br> Again and again!"</p>  
 <p>43. "Without doubt ye do call<br> Me to one who is not<br> Fit to be called to,<br> Whether in this world,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1275"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1275</font></a></p>  
 <p>Or in the Hereafter;<br> Our Return will be<br> To God; and the Transgressors<br> Will be Companions<br> Of the Fire!</p>  
 <p>44. "Soon will ye remember<br> What I say to you (now).<br> My (own) affair I commit<br> To God: for God (ever)<br> Watches over His Servants."</p>  
 <p>45. Then God saved him<br> From (every) ill that they<br> Plotted (against him),<br> But the brunt of the Penalty<br> Encompassed on all sides<br> The People of Pharaoh.</p>  
 <p>46. In front of the Fire<br> Will they be brought,<br> Morning and evening:<br> And (the Sentence will be)<br> On the Day that<br> Judgment will be established:<br> "Cast ye the People<br> Of Pharaoh into<br> The severest Penalty!"</p>  
 <p>47. Behold, they will dispute<br> With each other in the Fire!<br> The weak ones (who followed)<br> Will say to those who<br> Had been arrogant, "We but<br> Followed you: can ye then</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1276"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1276</font></a></p>  
 <p>Take (on yourselves) from us<br> Some share of the Fire?"</p>  
 <p>48. Those who had been arrogant<br> Will say: "We are all<br> In this (Fire)! Truly,<br> God has judged<br> Between (His) Servants!"</p>  
 <p>49. Those in the Fire will say<br> To the Keepers of Hell:<br> "Pray to your Lord<br> To lighten us the Penalty<br> For a Day (at least)!"</p>  
 <p>50. They will say: "Did there<br> Not come to you<br> Your apostles with Clear Signs?"<br> They will say, "Yes".<br> They will reply, "Then<br> Pray (as ye like)! But<br> The Prayer of those<br> Without Faith is nothing<br> But (futile wandering)<br> In (mazes of) error!"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1277"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1277</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
 <p>51. We will, without doubt,<br> Help Our apostles and those<br> Who believe, (both)<br> In this world's life<br> And on the Day<br> When the Witnesses<br> Will stand forth,—</p>  
 <p>52. The Day when no profit<br> Will it be to Wrong-doers<br> To present their excuses,<br> But they will (only) have<br> The Curse and the Home<br> Of Misery.</p>  
 <p>53. We did aforetime give Moses<br> The (Book of) Guidance,<br> And We gave the Book<br> In inheritance to the Children<br> Of Israel,—</p>  
 <p>54. A Guide and a Message<br> To men of understanding.</p>  
 <p>55. Patiently, then, persevere:<br> For the Promise of God<br> Is true: and ask forgiveness<br> For thy fault, and celebrate</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1278"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1278</font></a></p>  
 <p>The Praises of thy Lord<br> In the evening<br> And in the morning.</p>  
 <p>56. Those who dispute<br> About the Signs of God<br> Without any authority<br> Bestowed on them,—there is<br> Nothing in their breasts<br> But (the quest of) greatness,<br> Which they shall never<br> Attain to: seek refuge,<br> Then, in God: it is He<br> Who hears and sees (all things).</p>  
 <p>57. Assuredly the creation<br> Of the heavens<br> And the earth<br> Is a greater (matter)<br> Than the creation of men:<br> Yet most men understand not.</p>  
 <p>58. Not equal are the blind<br> And those who (clearly) see:<br> Nor are (equal) those<br> Who believe and work<br> Deeds of righteousness, and<br> Those who do evil.<br> Little do ye learn<br> By admonition!</p>  
 <p>59. The Hour will certainly come:<br> Therein is no doubt:<br> Yet most men believe not.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1279"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1279</font></a></p>  
 <p>60. And your Lord says:<br> "Call on Me; I<br> Will answer your (Prayer):<br> But those who are<br> Too arrogant to serve Me<br> Will surely find themselves<br> In Hell—in humiliation!"</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 7.</h5>  
 <p>61. It is God Who has<br> Made the Night for you,<br> That ye may rest therein,<br> And the Day, as that<br> Which helps (you) to see.<br> Verily God is Full of<br> Grace and Bounty to men:<br> Yet most men give<br> No thanks.</p>  
 <p>62. Such is God, your Lord,<br> The Creator of all things.<br> There is no god but He:<br> Then how ye are delude<br> Away from the Truth!</p>  
 <p>63. Thus are deluded those<br> Who are wont to reject<br> The Signs of God.</p>  
 <p>64. It is God Who has<br> Made for you the earth</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1280"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1280</font></a></p>  
 <p>As a resting place,<br> And the sky as a canopy,<br> And has given you shape—<br> And made your shapes<br> Beautiful,—and has provided<br> For you Sustenance,<br> Of things pure and good;—<br> Such is God your Lord.<br> So Glory to God,<br> The Lord of the Worlds!</p>  
 <p>65. He is the Living (One):<br> There is no god but He:<br> Call upon Him, giving Him<br> Sincere devotion. Praise he<br> To God, Lord of the Worlds!</p>  
 <p>66. Say: "I have been forbidden<br> To invoke those whom ye<br> Invoke besides God,—seeing that<br> The Clear Signs have come<br> To me from my Lord;<br> And I have been commanded<br> To bow (in Islām)<br> To the Lord of the Worlds."</p>  
 <p>67. It is He Who has<br> Created you from dust,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1281"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1281</font></a></p>  
 <p>Then from a sperm-drop,<br> Then from a leech-like clot;<br> Then does He get you<br> Out (into the light)<br> As a child: then lets you<br> (Grow and) reach your age<br> Of full strength; then<br> Lets you become old,—<br> Though of you there are<br> Some who die before;—<br> And lets you reach<br> A Term appointed;<br> In order that ye<br> May learn wisdom.</p>  
 <p>68. It is He Who gives Life<br> And Death; and when He<br> Decides upon an affair,<br> He says to it, "Be",<br> And it is.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 8.</h5>  
 <p>69. Seest thou not those<br> That dispute concerning<br> The Signs of God?<br> How are they turned away<br> (From Reality)?—</p>  
 <p>70. Those who reject the Book<br> And the (revelations) with which<br> We sent Our apostles:<br> But soon shall they know,—</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1282"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1282</font></a></p>  
 <p>71. When the yokes (shall be)<br> Round their necks,<br> And the chains;<br> They shall be dragged along—</p>  
 <p>72. In the boiling fetid fluid<br> Then in the Fire<br> Shall they be burned;</p>  
 <p>73. Then shall it be said<br> To them: "Where are<br> The (deities) to which<br> Ye gave part-worship—</p>  
 <p>74. "In derogation of God?"<br> They will reply: "They have<br> Left us in the lurch:<br> Nay, we invoked not,<br> Of old, anything (that had<br> Real existence)." Thus<br> Does God leave<br> The Unbelievers to stray.</p>  
 <p>75. "That was because<br> Ye were wont to rejoice<br> On the earth in things<br> Other than the Truth,<br> And that ye were wont<br> To be insolent.</p>  
 <p>76. "Enter ye the gates<br> Of Hell, to dwell therein:<br> And evil is (this) abode<br> Of the arrogant!"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1283"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1283</font></a></p>  
 <p>77. So persevere in patience;<br> For the Promise of God<br> Is true: and whether<br> We show thee (in this life)<br> Some part of what We<br> Promise them,—or We<br> Take thy soul (to Our Mercy)<br> (Before that),—(in any case)<br> It is to Us that<br> They shall (all) return.</p>  
 <p>78. We did aforetime send<br> Apostles before thee: of them<br> There are some whose story<br> We have related to thee,<br> And some whose story<br> We have not related<br> To thee. It was not<br> (Possible) for any apostle<br> To bring a Sign except<br> By the leave of God:<br> But when the Command<br> Of God issued,<br> The matter was decided<br> In truth and justice,<br> And there perished,<br> There and then, those<br> Who stood on Falsehoods.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 9.</h5>  
 <p>79. It is God who made<br> Cattle for you, that ye</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1284"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1284</font></a></p>  
 <p>May use some for riding<br> And some for food;</p>  
 <p>80. And there are (other) advantages<br> In them for you (besides);<br> That ye may through them<br> Attain to any need<br> (There may be) in your hearts;<br> And on them and on ships<br> Ye are carried.</p>  
 <p>81. And He shows you (always)<br> His Signs: then which<br> Of the Signs of God<br> Will ye deny?</p>  
 <p>82. Do they not travel through<br> The earth and see what<br> Was the End of those<br> Before them? They were<br> More numerous than these<br> And superior in strength<br> And in the traces<br> (They have left) in the land:<br> Yet all that they accomplished<br> Was of no profit to them.</p>  
 <p>83. For when their apostles<br> Came to them<br> With Clear Signs, they exulted<br> In such knowledge (and skill)</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1285"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1285</font></a></p>  
 <p>As they had; but<br> That very (Wrath) at which<br> They were wont to scoff<br> Hemmed them in.</p>  
 <p>84. But when they saw<br> Our Punishment, they said:<br> "We believe in God,—<br> The One God—and we<br> Reject the partners we used<br> To join with Him."</p>  
 <p>85. But their professing the Faith<br> When they (actually) saw<br> Our Punishment was not going<br> To profit them.<br> (Such has been) God's way<br> Of dealing with His servants<br> (From the most ancient times).<br> And even thus did<br> The rejecters of God<br> Perish (utterly)!</p>
