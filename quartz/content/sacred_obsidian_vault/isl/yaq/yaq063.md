 <p><a name="page_1550"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1550</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">Sūra LXIII.</h3>  <h3 align="center"><i>Munāfiqūn</i>, or the Hypocrites.</h3>  
 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>1. When the Hypocrites<br> Come to thee, they say,<br> "We bear witness that thou<br> Art indeed the Apostle<br> Of God." Yea, God<br> Knoweth that thou art<br> Indeed His Apostle,<br> And God beareth witness<br> That the Hypocrites are<br> Indeed liars.</p>  
 <p>2. They have made their oaths<br> A screen (for their misdeeds):<br> Thus they obstruct (men)<br> From the Path of God:<br> Truly evil are their deeds.</p>  
 <p>3. That is because they believed,<br> Then they rejected Faith:<br> So a seal was set<br> On their hearts: therefore<br> They understand not.</p>  
 <p>4. When thou lookest<br> At them, their exteriors</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1551"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1551</font></a></p>  
 <p>Please thee; and when<br> They speak, thou listenest<br> To their words. They are<br> As (worthless as hollow)<br> Pieces of timber propped up,<br> (Unable to stand on their own).<br> They think that every<br> Cry is against them.<br> They are the enemies;<br> So beware of them.<br> The curse of God be<br> On them! How are they<br> Deluded (away from the Truth)!</p>  
 <p>5. And when it is said<br> To them, "Come, the Apostle<br> Of God will pray for your<br> Forgiveness" they turn aside<br> Their heads, and thou wouldst<br> See them turning away<br> Their faces in arrogance.</p>  
 <p>6. It is equal to them<br> Whether thou pray for<br> Their forgiveness or not.<br> God will not forgive them.<br> Truly God guides not<br> Rebellious transgressors.</p>  
 <p>7. They are the ones who say,<br> "Spend nothing on those<br> Who are with God's Apostle,<br> To the end that they</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1552"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1552</font></a></p>  
 <p>May disperse (and quit Medina)."<br> But to God belong<br> The treasures of the heavens<br> And the earth; but<br> The Hypocrites understand not.</p>  
 <p>8. They say, "If we<br> Return to Medina, surely<br> The more honourable (element)<br> Will expel therefrom the meaner".<br> But honour belongs to God<br> And His Apostle, and<br> To the Believers; but<br> The Hypocrites know not.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>9. O ye who believe!<br> Let not your riches<br> Or your children divert you<br> From the remembrance of God.<br> If any act thus,<br> The loss is their own.</p>  
 <p>10. And spend something (in charity)<br> Out of the substance<br> Which We have bestowed<br> On you, before Death<br> Should come to any of you<br> And he should say,<br> "O my Lord! Why didst<br> Thou not give me<br> Respite for a little while?<br> I should then have given</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1553"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1553</font></a></p>  
 <p>(Largely) in charity, and I<br> Should have been one<br> Of the doers of good".</p>  
 <p>11. But to no soul<br> Will God grant respite<br> When the time appointed<br> (For it) has come; and God<br> Is well acquainted<br> With (all) that ye do.</p>
