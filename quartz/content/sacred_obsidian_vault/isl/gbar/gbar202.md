 <h3>202.</h3>
 
 <p>'Tell me, by whom is the physician more loved: by them that have never had any sickness, or by them whom the physician hath healed of grievous sickness?'</p>
 
 <p>Said the Pharisees to him: 'And how shall he that is whole love the physician? assuredly he will love him only for that he is not sick; and not having knowledge of sickness he will love the physician but little.'</p>
 
 <p>Then with vehemence of spirit Jesus spake, saying: 'As God liveth, your own tongues condemn your pride, inasmuch as our God is loved more by the sinner that repenteth, knowing the great mercy of God upon him, than by the righteous. For the righteous hath not knowledge of the mercy of God.

The citizens had gathered together the sick unto the house of Simon and prayed Jesus for the healing of the sick.</p>
 
 <p>Then Jesus, knowing that his hour was near, said: 'Call the sick, as many as there be, because God is mighty and merciful to heal them.'</p>
 
 <p>They answered: 'We know not that there be any other sick folk here in Jerusalem.'</p>
 
 <p>Jesus weeping answered: 'O Jerusalem, O Israel, I weep over thee, for thou knowest not thy visitation; because I would fain have gathered thee to the love of God thy creator, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and thou wouldst not.' Wherefore God saith thus unto thee—</p>
