 <h3>67.</h3>
 
 <p>'For ye say unto them: "Bring of your sheep and bulls and lambs to the temple of your God, and eat not all, but give a share to your God of that which he hath given you"; and ye do not tell them of the origin of sacrifice, that it is for a witness of the life granted to the son of our father Abraham, so that the faith and obedience of our father Abraham, with the promises made to him by God and the blessing given to him, should never be forgotten. But by Ezekiel the prophet saith God: "Remove from me these your sacrifices, your victims are abominable to me." For the time draweth near when that shall be done of which our God spake by Hosea the prophet, saying: "I will call chosen the people not chosen." And as he saith in Ezekiel the prophet: "God shall make a new covenant with his people, not according to the covenant which he gave to your fathers, which they observed not and he shall take from them a heart of stone, and give them a new heart": and all this shall be because ye walk not now in his law. And ye have the key and open not: rather do ye block the road for those who would walk in it.'</p>
