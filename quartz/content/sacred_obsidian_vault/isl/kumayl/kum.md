 <p>This is what is called the "Call of Kumayl." The word "Call" needs a
 little explanation here. In fact the form of this text is the same as a
 prayer, but since the verb "to pray" has different aspects in different
 cultures I decided here to use the verb "to call" for this piece. While
 in christian literature the verb "to pray" means mainly asking for help
 from God, the very same verb has another meaning in islamic literature.
 The verb "to pray" in Islam has the meaning of doing the worshipping which
 is done by any muslim everyday, or mainly the 5 main prayers of the day,
 but to ask God for help or a text that is meant to be in a form of a soliloquy
 between oneself and God, is much closer to the word "Call" because such
 text is called in Arabic "Do`â'" which stems from the verb "to call" in
 Arabic.
 <br>The Call you are going to pass by next is a familiar text for (almost)
 any shiite muslim who keeps up with his religious duties. The main body
 of the call is between the asterisks.
 <br>This is a rough translation with as simple as possible English. Such
 texts would be better to be translated in a form of literature English,
 but the idea here is to pass some cultural exchange to the other side of
 the world. The beauty of such text would be better exmained by people who
 can read Arabic, since it rhymes more and the wide range of words used
 in Arabic add up more to the sense of faith inside the reader, if he/she
 knows what is read.

 <br>The call (or pray) of Kumayl is in fact the call of Al-Khidhr (PUH),
 but it
 <br>was called like that because the prince of the believers (PUH) taught
 this
 <br>call to Kumayl bin Ziyâd Al-Nakh`ee and for this it was named after
 him.
 <br>This call is considered one of the most famous calls and considered
 one of
 <br>the best, and it is preferred to read this call in the night of the
 middle of
 <br>the month of Sha`bân [8th month] and in every Friday's night [That
 is Thursday night in
 <br>the solar calendars because in lunar calendars the day begins first
 by
 <br>night]. Al-Sayid bin Tâwoos told in the book of "Al-Iqabâl" within
 a long
 <br>speech [as reported from the prince of believers (PUH)]: if you memorized
 this call then read it every Friday's night, or
 <br>once a month, or once a year, or once in a life time, thus you shall
 be
 <br>protected and victorious and mercy shall be always there for you, O
 Kumayl I
 <br>guarantee for you as long you are with us (The Household of Mohammed)
 so we
 <br>shall answer your desires generously. Then he said: write (O Kumayl)
 -then
 <br>this he wrote- :
 <p>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
 <br>*
 <br>O Lord I ask You by Your mercy that befell on everything
 <br>and by Your power by which You mastered everything
 <br>and everything became under it
 <br>and everything became enslaved to it
 <br>and by Your might by which You defeated everything
 <br>and by Your glory that nothing stands before it
 <br>and by Your greatness that filled everything
 <br>and by Your majesty that came over everything
 <br>and by Your face that will remain after the vanishing of everything
 <br>and by Your Names that filled the corners of everything
 <br>and by Your knowledge that surrounded everything
 <br>and by the light of Your face that enlighted everything
 <br>Yâ Noor (O Light) Yâ Quddoos (O Most Holy) O The First of all and
 The Last
 <br>of all
 <br>O Lord forgive me the sins that break up the safety
 <br>O Lord forgive me the sins that reveal the resentments
 <br>O Lord forgive me the sins that change the gifts (of You)
 <br>O Lord forgive me the sins that imprison the call
 <br>O Lord forgive me the sins that reveal the adversities
 <br>O Lord forgive me every sin I sinned, and every mistake I have mistaken
 <br>O Lord I approach You by mentioning Your Name and get closer to You
 by You
 <br>and I shall ask You to get me closer to You and to spread Your thanks
 over
 <br>me and inspire me to mention Your Name
 <br>O Lord I ask You as an obeying, enslaved and humble man, to forgive
 me and
 <br>have mercy upon me and make me satisfied with Your division (destiny)
 and in
 <br>all situations to be humble
 <br>O Lord I ask You as he whom adversities befell on him severely, and
 at
 <br>troubles revealed his needs by Your doors, and as he who his desires
 were
 <br>before You
 <br>O Lord great is Your majesty
 <br>and high is Your place
 <br>and hidden is Your cunning
 <br>and obvious is Your reality
 <br>and victorious is Your might
 <br>and went on Your ability
 <br>and there is no escape from Your own government
 <br>O Lord I do not find for my sins a forgiver
 <br>and no one for my ugliness to be covering
 <br>and nothing of my bad deeds to be exchanged with good except of You
 <br>no other God but You, Be glorified and thanked. I wronged myself and
 I dared
 <br>by my ingnorance and took refuge by Your old mention of me and Your
 grace
 <br>over me
 <br>O Lord how many ugly things You have hidden
 <br>and how many a great adversity You have relieved
 <br>and how many a misstep You have prevented
 <br>and how many a mishap You have pushed away
 <br>and how many a praise of me that I'm not worthy for You have spreaded
 <br>O Lord great is my adversity
 <br>and gratified is my bad situation
 <br>and my (good) deeds have been shortened
 <br>and my chains brought me down
 <br>and my far hopes kept me away from my own benefit
 <br>and life tricked me by its arrogance
 <br>and my soul by its crime and my procrastination
 <br>O my Lord then shall I ask You by Your majesty that my call shall not
 be blocked by my
 <br>bad deeds
 <br>and do not dishonor me with what You have known about my secrets
 <br>and do not hurry Your punishment for me for what I did in my privacy
 of the
 <br>bad deeds, and my missing and my ignorance, and my abundant lust and
 <br>incaution
 <br>O Lord and be for me by Your majesty in all situations a merciful
 <br>and for me in all the matters a passionate
 <br>O Lord and my God whoever I have to ask to relieve my adversity and
 to look
 <br>at my matter except of You?
 <br>O Lord and my Master, You have judged me for following the lust of
 my soul
 <br>and was not careful how my enemy (devil) ornamented (things for me),
 and he tricked me with
 <br>what I have lust for and with what makes him happy for this judgement.
 Thus
 <br>I passed over some of Your limitations and I went against some of Your
 <br>commandments, and Your grace for all of that is over me and I have
 no excuse
 <br>before Your judgement and what befell me of Your commands and adversities
 <br>and here I come O my Lord after my negligence and my extravagance for
 <br>myself, apologizing, regretting, broken, lonely, asking for mercy,
 <br>repenting, recognizing, obeying, admitting, can't find any escape of
 what I
 <br>did and no refuge to take for my matters except of You accepting my
 apology,
 <br>and getting me into Your wide mercy
 <br>O Lord accept my apology and have mercy upon my severe adversity and
 release
 <br>me from my tight lashing
 <br>O Lord have mercy upon the weakness of my body and the softness of
 my skin
 <br>and the brittleness of my bones
 <br>O You who started my creation and my mention and my education and took
 care
 <br>of me and feeded me, make me for the beginning of Your generosity and
 the
 <br>previous of Your care towards me
 <br>O my Lord and my Master and My God, shall You torture me with Your
 hell
 <br>after unifying You? and after my heart having the knowledge about You
 and my
 <br>tongue mentioned Your Name and after what my conscience believed about
 Your
 <br>love, and after the truthful confession from me for Your deity?
 <br>How impossible! You are more generous than making who You have grown
 up go
 <br>astray
 <br>or send him far he who You have made close
 <br>or stray who You have nestled
 <br>or give him to the adversities he who You have protected and had mercy
 upon
 <br>and I wish my poem [expression of wishing in Arabic] O my Lord and
 my God
 <br>and my Master
 <br>shall You order the fire to be on faces that fell down for Your greatness
 <br>prostrating?
 <br>and on tongues that mentioned Your unity truthfully?
 <br>and praising You with thanks
 <br>and on hearts admitted Your deity faithfully
 <br>and on consciences gained the knowledge until they became humble before
 You
 <br>and on feelings that went on the lands to worship You obeying (You)
 and
 <br>started to repent before You
 <br>This is not the thought about You and not what we were told about Your
 <br>generosity O Generous One, O Lord
 <br>and You know my weakness before few of the adversities in this life
 and its
 <br>punishments and what happens of troubles to those living in it, but
 that is
 <br>an adversity that will not last long and easy to handle with a short
 period
 <br>of time, then how shall I bear the adversities of the afterlife and
 its
 <br>great mishaps, and it is an adversity that will last long and placed
 for
 <br>eternity and it is never lowered down for those in it because it does
 not
 <br>become unless for Your anger and Your revenge, and this is something
 that
 <br>heavens and earth cannot bear
 <br>O my Lord then how I shall be and I am Your weak slave, the humble,
 the
 <br>poor, the miserable
 <br>O my Lord and my God and my Master, what to You shall I complain about,
 and
 <br>what to You shall I cry out loud about?
 <br>for the painful torture and its hardness?
 <br>or for the long lasting of adversity and its longevity?
 <br>and if You made me for the punishments with Your enemies and gathered
 me
 <br>with the people of Your adversities and separated me from Your beloved
 and
 <br>viceroys, then suppose my Master and my Lord and my God I had patient
 with
 <br>Your torture then how shall I be patient for being away from You?
 <br>and suppose I stood the heat of Your hell, then how shall I be patient
 for
 <br>not looking at Your generosity?
 <br>or how shall I be in hell and I have hope in Your forgiveness?
 <br>then by Your own majesty O my Master and my Lord, I swear truthfully
 that if
 <br>You left me speaking then I shall scream to You among its people (hell)
 the
 <br>scream of those with hopes, and I shall shout as those shouting for
 help,
 <br>and I shall cry for You as the cry of those who lost dear ones, and
 I shall
 <br>call You and say where have You been O patron of believers?
 <br>O goal of the hopes of the wisemen
 <br>O Helper of those asking for help
 <br>O who is beloved to the hearts of the believers
 <br>O God of the worlds
 <br>shall You, be glorified Your Name, O my God and by Your grace, hear
 the
 <br>sound of a muslim slave that was imprisoned in it for going against
 You? and
 <br>tasted its torture by his sins? and was kept between its jaws for his
 crime
 <br>and mistake? and he is shouting to You as one with hope for Your mercy,
 and
 <br>call You with the tongue of the people who unified You, and beg You
 by Your
 <br>own deity
 <br>O my Lord then how shall he remain in the torture and he is wishing
 for the
 <br>past of Your mercy?
 <br>or how shall the hell hurt him and he hopes for Your generosity to
 release
 <br>him from it?
 <br>or how shall he would be burned by its fires and You hear him and see
 his
 <br>place?
 <br>or how shall he be incuded in its exhalations and You know how weak
 he is?
 <br>or how shall he be kept among its claws and You know how truthful he
 is?
 <br>or how shall he be rebuked by its keepers (angels of punishment) and
 he is
 <br>calling You "O my Lord!" ?
 <br>or how shall he be willing for Your generosity and You leave him in
 it?
 <br>How impossible! This is not the thought about You, and that is not
 what is
 <br>known of Your generosity, and it is not like how You treat the unifiers
 by
 <br>Your generosity and help
 <br>and certainly I am sure if it is not for what You promised of torture
 for
 <br>those who disbelieve in You, and Your judgement for those who go against
 You
 <br>to be eternal (in it), then surely You would make it be coolness and
 peace
 <br>and no one shall be living or dwelling there
 <br>but You, glorified Your Names, swore that You will fill it with
 <br>disbelievers, from the djinn and the human as well, and to make eternal
 in
 <br>it those who go against You
 <br>and You, gratified be Your praising, said in the beginning, and gave
 much of
 <br>Your favors by Your generosity
 <br>Is he who is a believer like unto him who is an evil-liver? They are
 not
 <br>alike
 <br>O my God and my Lord, then I shall ask You by the might that You have
 fixed,
 <br>and by the matter that You have destined and ruled, and defeated by
 it
 <br>whoever You have made it for, to forgive me in this night and this
 hour
 <br>every crime I have commited and every sin I have sinnned and every
 ugliness
 <br>I have made in secret, and every ignorance I have commited either announced
 <br>or been a secret, made it hidden or made it apparent, and every sin
 that You
 <br>have ordered the dignified writers (writing angels recording the deeds
 of a
 <br>man) to note down, those who You have made to save everything I do
 and made
 <br>them witnesses with my organs
 <br>and You have been the Watcher over me from their behind, and the Witness
 for
 <br>whatever was hidden from them and by Your mercy You have made it hidden
 <br>and (shall I ask) to make my luck abundant in every good You have revealed,
 <br>or a favor You have given, or a virtue that You have spreaded, or an
 income
 <br>that You have made easy, or a mistake that You have covered
 <br>O God, O God, O God, O my God and my Master and my Lord and the Owner
 of my
 <br>slavery, O You who has my matter in His hands, O You who know my adversity
 <br>and my humbleness, O You who best knows my poverty and my need
 <br>O God, O God, O God, I ask You by Your right and by Your glory, and
 by the
 <br>greatest of Your characters and Names, to make my times of the night
 and da
 <br>full of Your mention, and contiunous under Your service, and my deeds
 are
 <br>accepted by You, so that all my deeds and works be in one path, and
 my
 <br>situation in serving You would be eternal
 <br>O my Lord who helps me, O You who I complained to about my matters
 <br>O God, O God, O God, make my body strong enough to serve You
 <br>and tighten my soul on the strength, and give me the seriousness to
 fear
 <br>You, and the eternity to be under Your service, so that I shall be
 running
 <br>to You in the fields of the competents and hurry to You among those
 in the
 <br>beginning
 <br>and long for Your closeness among those craving (to You), and be close
 to
 <br>You like those faithful to You, and be afraid of You like those who
 know You
 <br>the best, and be gathered in Your closeness with the believers
 <br>O Lord and those whoever wanted to hurt me then hurt them, and whoever
 <br>wanted to trick me then trick them, and make me one of those of the
 best
 <br>favors from You, and the closest in place to You, and the most special
 in
 <br>proximity to You, because this is not to be begotten unless by Your
 favor,
 <br>and have grace on me by Your generosity, and have passion on me by
 Your own
 <br>glory and save me by Your own mercy
 <br>and make my tongue busy with Your mention
 <br>and my heart with Your love tightened
 <br>and have grace on me by the goodness of Your answer and relieve me
 from my
 <br>own missteps and forgive my mistake
 <br>and if You assigned to Your slaves to worship You and ordered them
 to call
 <br>for You and You have guaranteed the answer for them, so to You O God
 I turn
 <br>my face, and to You O God I expanded my hand
 <br>so by Your own might answer my call, and make me reach my own goal
 and do
 <br>not stop my hopes in Your own grace
 <br>and avoid me the evils of the djinn and the people from my enemies
 <br>O You who has satisfaction rapidly, forgive for he who has nothing
 but to
 <br>call You, because You are willing to do anything You want
 <br>O You who His Name is a cure, and His mention is a remedy, and obeying
 Him
 <br>is wealth
 <br>have mercy upon he who has nothing but hope, and his weapon is to cry
 <br>O You who has many favors
 <br>O You who pushes away the evils
 <br>O You who is the light of the lonely in the darkness
 <br>O You who knows best and never taught
 <br>have peace upon Mohammed and the Household of Mohammed
 <br>and do to me what is best by You
 </p><p>and may Allah have peace upon His prophet and the faithful viceroys
 of his
 <br>descendants, and may (He) greets them greatly.
