 <p><a name="img_06700"></a>
 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/06700.jpg" alt="H"></td></tr></table>HOLLA!—Awake, sweet damsel, and bring our morning draught in thy capacious goblet; nor suffer the rich wines of Enderein to be longer hoarded:  
 <p>2. Bring the well-tempered wine, that seems to be tinctured with saffron, and, when it is diluted with water, overflows the cup.</p>  
 <p>3. This is the liquor which diverts the anxious lover from his passion; and, as soon as he tastes it, he is perfectly composed:</p>  
 <p>4. Hence thou seest the penurious churl, when the circling bowl passes him, grow regardless of his pelf:</p>  
 <p>5.* When its potent flames have seized the discreetest of our youths, thou wouldst imagine him to be in a frenzy.</p>  
 <p>6. Thou turnest the goblet from us, O mother of Amru; for the true course of the goblet is to the right hand:</p>  
 <p>7. He is not the least amiable of thy three companions, O mother of Amru, to whom thou hast not presented the morning bowl.</p>  
 <p>8.* How many a cup have I purchased in Balbec! how many more in Damascus and Kasirein!</p>  
 <p>9. Surely our allotted hour of fate will overtake us; since we are destined to death, and death to us.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. O stay a while, before we separate, thou lovely rider on camels, that we may relate to thee our sorrows, and thou to us thy delights!</p>  
 <p>11. O stay!—that we may inquire whether thou hast altered thy purpose of departing hastily, or whether thou hast wholly deceived thy too confident lover:</p>  
 <p>12. In the hateful day of battle, whilst he struggles amid wounds and blows, may the Ruler of the world refresh thy sight with coolness, and gratify it with every desired object!</p>  
 <p>13. O Amru, when thou visitest thy fair one in secret, and when the eyes of lurking enemies are closed in rest,</p>  
 <p>14. She displays two lovely arms, fair and full as the limbs of a long-necked snow-white young camel, that frisks in the vernal season over the sand-banks and green hillocks;</p>  
 <p>15. And two sweet breasts, smooth and white as vessels of ivory, modestly defended from the hand of those who presume to touch them:</p>  
 <p>16. She discovers her slender shape, tall and well proportioned, and her sides gracefully rising with all their attendant charms;</p>  
 <p>17.* Her hips elegantly swelling, which the entrance of the tent is scarce large enough to admit, and her waist, the beauty of which drives me to madness;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="green">p. 69</font></a></p>  
 <p>18.* With two charming columns of jasper or polished marble, on which hang rings and trinkets making a stridulous sound.</p>  
 <p>19. My youthful passion is rekindled, and my ardent desire revives, when I see the travelling camels of my fair one driven along in the evening;</p>  
 <p>20. When the towns of Yemama appear in sight, exalted above the plains, and shining like bright sabres in the hands of those who have unsheathed them.</p>  
 <p>21. <i>When she departs</i>, the grief of a she-camel who seeks her lost foal, and returns despairing with piercing cries, equals not my anguish;</p>  
 <p>22. Nor that of a widow, with snowy locks, whose mourning never ceases for her nine children, of whom nothing remains, but what the tomb has concealed.</p>  
 <p>23. <i>Such is our fate!</i> This day and the morrow, and the morning after them, are pledges in the hand of destiny for events of which we have no knowledge.</p>  
 <p>24. O son of Hinda, be not precipitate in giving judgment against us: hear us with patience, and we will give thee certain information;—</p>  
 <p>25. That we lead our standards to battle, <i>like camels to the pool</i>, of a white hue, and bring them back stained with blood, in which they have quenched their thirst;</p>  
 <p>26. That our days of prosperity, in which we have refused to obey the commands of kings, have been long and brilliant.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="green">p. 70</font></a></p>  
 <p>27. Many a chief of his nation, on whom the regal diadem has been placed, the refuge of those who implored his protection,</p>  
 <p>28. Have we left prostrate on the field, while his horses waited by his side, with one of their hoofs bent, and with bridles richly adorned.</p>  
 <p>29.* Often have we fixed our mansions in Dhu Thaluh, towards the districts of Syria, and have kept at a distance those who menaced us.</p>  
 <p>30. <i>We were so disguised in our armour, that</i> the dogs of the tribe snarled at us; yet we stripped the branches from every thorny tree (<i>every armed warrior</i>) that opposed us.</p>  
 <p>31. When we roll the millstone of war over a little clan, they are ground to flour in the first battle;</p>  
 <p>32. From the eastern side of Najd the cloth of the mill is spread, and whatever we cast into it soon becomes impalpable powder.</p>  
 <p>33. You alight on our hills as guests are received in their station, and we hasten to give you a warm reception, lest you should complain of our backwardness:</p>  
 <p>34. We invite you to our board, and speedily prepare for your entertainment a solid rock, which, before daybreak, shall reduce you to dust.</p>  
 <p>35. Surely hatred after hatred is manifested by thee, <i>O hostile chief!</i> and thy secret rancour has been revealed:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></a></p>  
 <p>36. But we have inherited glory, as the race of Maad well knows; we have fought with valour till our fame has been illustrious.</p>  
 <p>37. When the falling pillars of our tents quiver over our furniture, we defend our neighbours from the impending min.</p>  
 <p>38. We disperse our gifts to our countrymen, but disdain to share their spoils; and the burdens which we bear we support for their advantage.</p>  
 <p>39• When the troops of the foe are at a distance from us, we dart our javelins; and when we close in the combat, we strike with sharp sabres;—</p>  
 <p>40. Our dark javelins, exquisitely wrought of Khathaian reeds, slender and delicate; our sabres, bright and piercing:</p>  
 <p>41. With these we cleave in pieces the heads of our enemies; we mow—we cut down their necks as with sickles:</p>  
 <p>42. Then might you imagine the skulls of heroes on the plain to be the bales of a camel thrown on rocky ground.</p>  
 <p>43. Instead of submitting to them, we crush their heads; and their terror is such, that they know not on which side the danger is to be feared.</p>  
 <p>44. Our scimitars, whose strokes are furiously interchanged, are as little regarded by us as twisted sashes in the hands of playful children.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="green">p. 72</font></a></p>  
 <p>45. Their armour and ours, stained reciprocally with our blood, seems to be dyed or painted with the juice of the crimson syringa-flower.</p>  
 <p>46. At a time when the tribe is reluctant to charge the foe, apprehensive of some probable disaster,</p>  
 <p>47. Then we lead on our troop, like a mountain with a pointed summit; we preserve our reputation, and advance in the foremost ranks,</p>  
 <p>48. With youths, who consider death as the completion of glory, and with aged heroes experienced in war:</p>  
 <p>49. We challenge all the clans together to contend with us, and we boldly preclude their sons from approaching the mansion of our children.</p>  
 <p>50. On the day when we are anxious to protect our families, we keep vigilant guard, clad in complete steel;</p>  
 <p>51. But on the day when we have no such anxiety for them, our legions assemble in frill council.</p>  
 <p>52. Led by a chief among the descendants of Josham the son of Becr, we bruise our adversaries, both the weak and the strong.</p>  
 <p>53.* Oh, the nations remember not the time when we bowed the neck, or ever flagged in the conflict!</p>  
 <p>54. Oh, let no people be infatuated and violent against us; for we will requite their infatuation, which surpasses the folly of the most foolish!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="green">p. 73</font></a></p>  
 <p>55. On what pretence, O Amru, son of Hinda, should we be subject to the sovereign whom thou wouldst place over us?</p>  
 <p>56. By what pretence, O Amru, son of Hinda, dost thou yield to our calumniators, and treat us with indignity?</p>  
 <p>57. Thou hast menaced us: thou hast thought to intimidate us; but, gently, O King!—say, when were we ever the vassals of thy mother?</p>  
 <p>58. Our javelins, O Amru, disdain to relax their vehemence before thee in assailing our foes:</p>  
 <p>59. Whenever a man uses force to bend them, they start back, and become inflexibly rigid,-</p>  
 <p>60. So rigid, that when they return to their former state, they ring with a shrill noise, piercing the neck and forehead of him who touches them.</p>  
 <p>61. Hast thou ever been informed that Josham the son of Becr, in battles anciently fought, was at any time remiss?</p>  
 <p>62. We have inherited the renown of Alkama the son of Saif, who by dint of valour obtained admission for us into the castles of glory.</p>  
 <p>63. We are heirs to Mohalhil, and to Zoheir, the flower of his tribe: O of how noble a treasure were they the preservers!</p>  
 <p>64. From Attab also and from Celthum we have received the inheritance transmitted from their progenitors.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></a></p>  
 <p>65. By Dhu’lborra, of whose fame thou hast heard the report, have we been protected; and through him we protect those who seek our aid.</p>  
 <p>66. Before him the adventurous Coleib sprung from us: and what species of glory is there which we have not attained?</p>  
 <p>67. When our antagonists twist against us the cords <i>of battle</i>, either we burst the knot or rend the necks of our opponents.</p>  
 <p>68. We shall be found the firmest of tribes in keeping our defensive alliance, and the most faithful in observing the bond of our treaties.</p>  
 <p>69. When the flames were kindled in the mountain, on the morning of an excursion, we gave succour more important than the aid of other allies.</p>  
 <p>70. To give immediate relief, we kept all our herds confined in Dhu Orathei, until our mulch-camels of a noble breed were forced to graze on withered herbs.</p>  
 <p>71. We protect with generosity the man who submits to us; but chastise with firmness him by whom we are insulted.</p>  
 <p>72. We reject the offers of those who have displeased us; but accept the presents of those with whom we are satisfied.</p>  
 <p>73. We succoured the right wing, when our troops engaged in combat, and our valiant brothers gave support to the left.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></a></p>  
 <p>74. They made a fierce attack against the legions which opposed them, and we not less fiercely assailed the squadrons by which we were opposed.</p>  
 <p>75. They returned with booty and with rich spoils, and the sons of kings were among our captives.</p>  
 <p>76. To you, O descendants of Becr, to you we address ourselves;—have you not yet learned the truth concerning us?</p>  
 <p>77. Have you not experienced with what impetuosity our troops have attacked your troops, and with what force they have darted their javelins?</p>  
 <p>78. We are armed with bright sabres, and clad in habergeons made in Yemen; our scimitars are part straight, part bent.</p>  
 <p>79. We have coats of mail that glitter like lightning; the plaits of which are seen in wrinkles above our belts:</p>  
 <p>80. When at any time our heroes put them off, you may see their skin blackened with the pressure of the steel.</p>  
 <p>81. The plaits of our hauberks resemble the surface of a pool which the winds have ruffled in their course.</p>  
 <p>82. On the morning of attack, we are borne into the field on short-haired steeds, which have been known to us from the time when we weaned them, and which we rescued from our foes after they had been taken.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="green">p. 76</font></a></p>  
 <p>83.* They rush to the fight, armed with breastplates of steel; they leave it with their manes dishevelled and dusty, and the reins, tied in knots, lie on their necks.</p>  
 <p>84. We inherited this excellent breed from our virtuous ancestors; and on our death they will be inherited by our sons.</p>  
 <p>85. All the tribes of Maad perfectly know, when their tents are pitched in the well-watered valleys,</p>  
 <p>86. That we support the distressed in every barren year, and are bountiful to such as solicit our bounty;</p>  
 <p>87.* That we defend the oppressed, when we think it just; and fix our abode in Arabia, where we find it convenient;</p>  
 <p>88. That we give succour to those that are near us, when the bright scimitars make the eyes of our heroes wink.</p>  
 <p>89. We entertain strangers at our board whenever we are able; but we hurl destruction on those who approach us hostilely.</p>  
 <p>90. We are the tribe who drink water from the clearest brooks; whilst other clans are forced to drink it foul and muddy.</p>  
 <p>91. Go, ask the sons of Tamah and of Domia, how they have found us in the conflict!</p>  
 <p>92. Behind us come our lovely, our charming damsels, whom we guard so vigilantly that they cannot be made captive, or even treated with disrespect:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="green">p. 77</font></a></p>  
 <p>93. Fair maidens, descended from Josham the son of Becr, who comprise every species of beauty, both in the opinion of men and in truth.</p>  
 <p>94. They have exacted a promise from their husbands, that, when they engaged with the hostile legions, distinguished by marks of valour,</p>  
 <p>95. They would bring back, as spoils, coats of mail and scimitars, and captives led chained in pairs.</p>  
 <p>96.* Thou mayst behold us sallying forth into the open plain, whilst every other tribe seeks auxiliaries through fear of our prowess.</p>  
 <p>97. When our damsels are on foot, they walk with graceful motions, and wave their bodies like those of libertines heated with wine.</p>  
 <p>98. They feed with their fair hands our coursers of noble birth, and say to us: "You are no husbands of ours, unless you protect us from the foe."</p>  
 <p>99. Yes, if we defend not them, we retain no possessions of value after their loss, nor do we think even life desirable:</p>  
 <p>100. But nothing can afford our sweet maids so sure a protection as the strokes of our sabres, which make men's arms fly off like the clashing wands of playful boys.</p>  
 <p>101.* We seem, when our drawn scimitars are displayed, to protect mankind, as fathers protect their children.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></a></p>  
 <p>102.* Our heroes roll the heads of their enemies, as the strong well-made youths roll their balls in the smooth vale.</p>  
 <p>103. This world is ours, and all that appears on the face of it; and when we do attack, we attack with irresistible force.</p>  
 <p>104. When a tyrant oppresses and insults a nation, we disdain to degrade ourselves by submitting to his will.</p>  
 <p>105. We have been called injurious, although we have injured no man; but if they persist in calumniating us, we will show the vehemence of our anger.</p>  
 <p>106. As soon as a child of our tribe is weaned from his mother, the loftiest chiefs of other clans bend the knee and pay him homage.</p>  
 <p>107.* We force our enemies to taste the unmixed draught of death; and heavy is the overthrow of our adversaries in battle.</p>  
 <p>108. We fill the earth with our tents, until it becomes too narrow to contain them; and cover the surface of the ocean with our ships.</p>
