 <p>[Having reviewed the long line of Himyarite princes, who were, each in his day, "possessed of power for evil or for good," the Poet thus moralises in conclusion.]</p>  <h3 align="center">CLOSING VERSES.</h3>  
 <p>129. The chiefs of Himyar, and their kings, are buried in the dust, to rest in graves beneath slabs of stones.</p>  
 <p>130. They have become dust, they are trodden on like as Death treads upon the mounds of earth and the pebbles of the watercourse.</p>  
 <p>131. The world they lived in submitted to them, then turned away and smote them with its kicking hoof.</p>  
 <p>132. There rained upon them, after the clouds of their prosperity, the clouds of misfortune in heavy-pouring showers.</p>  
 <p>133. The accidents of Time had no regard for them, nor could they defend themselves from them with swords or lances;</p>  
 <p>134. No, not with troops and with palaces; nor with armies, and fortresses, and weapons.</p>  
 <p>135. They have their dwelling in the earth, after <i>living in</i> castles, and delighting themselves with eating and drinking, and the pleasures of wedlock.</p>  
 <p>136. Their castles, which were built on supports of wide-spreading stone, have become as smouldering wood.</p>  
 <p>137. Time mingles its misfortunes with its favours, and affects its children with misery in <i>the midst</i> of joy.</p>

 <p>138. Praise be to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">God</span>, whose beneficence is to be hoped for! may He remain an object of praise in the morning and the evening!</p>  
 <p>139. And may blessings he upon the Prophet and his followers, as long as the winged pigeon may coo!</p>
