 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/00600.jpg" alt="S"></td></tr></table>STAY!—Let us weep at the remembrance of our beloved, <i>at the sight of</i> the station <i>where her tent was raised</i>, by the edge of yon bending sands between Dahul and Haumel,  
 <p>2. "Tudam and Mikra; <i>a station</i>, the marks of which are not wholly effaced, though the south wind and the north have woven the twisted sand."</p>  
 <p>3. <i>Thus I spoke, when</i> my companions stopped their coursers by my side, and said: "Perish not through despair: only be patient."</p>  
 <p>4. "A profusion of tears," <i>answered I</i>, "is my sole relief; but what avails it to shed them over the remains of a deserted mansion?"</p>  
 <p>5. "Thy condition," <i>they replied</i>, "is not more painful than when thou leftest Howaira, before thy present passion, and her neighbour Rebaba, <i>on the hills of</i> Masel."</p>  
 <p>6. <i>"Yes," I rejoined</i>, "when those two damsels departed, musk was diffused from their robes, as the eastern gale sheds the scent of clove-gillyflowers:</p>  
 <p>7. "Then gushed the tears from my eyes, through excess of regret, and flowed down my neck, till my sword-belt was drenched in the stream."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. "Yet hast thou passed many days in sweet converse with the fair: but none so sweet as the day which thou spentest by <i>the pool of</i> Daratjuljul."</p>  
 <p>9. On that day I killed my camel, to give the virgins a feast; and, oh! how strange was it that they should carry his trappings and furniture!</p>  
 <p>10. The damsels continued till evening helping one another to the roasted flesh, and to the delicate fat, like the fringe of white silk finely woven.</p>  
 <p>11. On that happy day I entered the carriage, the carriage of Onaiza, who said: "Wo to thee! thou wilt compel me to travel on foot."</p>  
 <p>12. She added (while the vehicle was bent aside with our weight), "O Amriolkais, descend, or my beast also will be killed!"</p>  
 <p>13. I answered: "Proceed, and loosen his rein; nor withhold from me the fruits of thy love, which again and again may be tasted with rapture.</p>  
 <p>14. "Many a fair one like thee—though not, <i>like thee</i>, a virgin—have I visited by night; and many a lovely mother have I diverted from the care of her yearling infant, adorned with amulets:</p>  
 <p>15. "When the suckling behind her cried, she turned round to him with half her body; but half of it, pressed beneath my embrace, was not turned from me."</p>  
 <p>16. Delightful, too, was the day when Fatima first rejected me on the summit of yon sand-hill, and took an oath, which she declared inviolable.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. "O Fatima!" said I, "away with so much coyness; and if thou hadst resolved to abandon me, yet at last relent!</p>  
 <p>18. "If indeed my disposition and manners are unpleasing to thee, rend at once the mantle of my heart, that it may be detached from thy love.</p>  
 <p>19. "Art thou so haughty, because my passion for thee destroys me; and because whatever thou commandest my heart performs?</p>  
 <p>20. "<i>Thou weepest;</i> yet thy tears flow merely to wound my heart with the shafts of thine eyes—my heart, already broken to pieces and agonizing."</p>  
 <p>21. <i>Besides these</i>, with many a spotless virgin, whose tent had not yet been frequented, have I held soft dalliance at perfect leisure.</p>  
 <p>22. <i>To visit one of them</i>, I passed the guards of her bower, and a hostile tribe, who would have been eager to proclaim my death.</p>  
 <p>23. It was the hour when the Pleiads appeared in the firmament, like the folds of a silken sash variously decked with gems.</p>  
 <p>24. I approached: she stood <i>expecting me</i> by the curtain; and, <i>as if she was preparing</i> for sleep, had put off all her vesture but her night-dress.</p>  
 <p>25. She said: "By Him who created me," and gave me her lovely hand, "I am unable to refuse thee; for I perceive that the blindness of thy passion is not to be removed."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></a></p>  
 <p>26. Then I rose with her; and as we walked she drew over our footsteps the train of her pictured robe.</p>  
 <p>27. Soon as we had passed the habitations of her tribe, and come to the bosom of a vale, surrounded with hillocks of spiry sand,</p>  
 <p>28. I gently drew her towards me by her curled locks, and she softly inclined to my embrace;—her waist was gracefully slender, but sweetly swelled the part encircled with ornaments of gold.</p>  
 <p>29. Delicate was her shape; fair her skin; and her body well proportioned: her bosom was as smooth as a mirror,</p>  
 <p>30. Or, like the pure egg of an ostrich, of a yellowish tint blended with white, and nourished by a stream of wholesome water not yet disturbed.</p>  
 <p>31. She turned aside, and displayed her soft cheek: she gave a timid glance with languishing eyes, like those of a roe in <i>the groves of</i> Wegera looking tenderly at her young.</p>  
 <p>32. Her neck was like that of a milk-white hind, but, when she raised it, exceeded not the justest symmetry; nor was the neck of my beloved so unadorned.</p>  
 <p>33. Her long coal-black hair decorated her back, thick and diffused, like bunches of dates clustering on the palm-tree.</p>  
 <p>34. Her locks were elegantly turned above her head; and the riband which bound them was lost in her tresses, part braided, part dishevelled.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></a></p>  
 <p>35. She discovered a waist taper as a well-twisted cord; and a leg both as white and as smooth as the stem of a young palm, or a fresh reed, bending over the rivulet.</p>  
 <p>36. When she sleeps at noon, her bed is besprinkled with musk: she puts on her robe of undress, but leaves the apron <i>to her handmaids</i>.</p>  
 <p>37. She dispenses gifts with small, delicate fingers, sweetly glowing at their tips, like the white and crimson worm of Dabia, or dentrifices made of esel-wood.</p>  
 <p>38. The brightness of her face illumines the veil of night, like the evening taper of a recluse hermit.</p>  
 <p>39. On a girl like her, a girl of a moderate height, between those who wear a frock and those who wear a gown, the most bashful man must look with an enamoured eye.</p>  
 <p>40. The blind passions of men for common objects of affection are soon dispersed; but from the love of thee my heart cannot be released.</p>  
 <p>41. O how oft have I rejected the admonitions of a morose adviser, vehement in censuring my passion for thee; nor have I been moved by his reproaches!</p>  
 <p>42. Often has the night drawn her skirts around me, like the billows of the ocean, to make trial of my fortitude in a variety of cares;</p>  
 <p>43. And I said to her, when she seemed to extend her sides, to drag on her unwieldy length, and to advance slowly with her breast:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></a></p>  
 <p>44. "Dispel thy gloom, O tedious night! that the morn may rise; although my sorrows are such, that the morning-light will not give more comfort than thy shades.</p>  
 <p>45. "O hideous night!—a night in which the stars are prevented from rising, as if they were bound to a solid cliff with strong cables!"</p>  
 <p>46. Often, too, have I risen at early dawn, while the birds were yet in their nests, and mounted a hunter with smooth short hair, of a full height, and so fleet as to make captive the beasts of the forest;</p>  
 <p>47. Ready in turning, quick in pursuing, bold in advancing, firm in backing; and performing the whole with the strength and swiftness of a vast rock which a torrent has pushed from its lofty base;</p>  
 <p>48. A bright bay steed, from whose polished back the trappings slide, as drops of rain glide hastily down the slippery marble.</p>  
 <p>49. Even in his weakest state he seems to boil while he runs; and the sound which he makes in his rage is like that of a bubbling cauldron.</p>  
 <p>50. When other horses that swim through the air are languid and kick the dust, he rushes on like a flood, and strikes the hard earth with a firm hoof.</p>  
 <p>51. He makes the light youth slide from his seat, and violently shakes the skirts of a heavier and more stubborn rider;</p>  
 <p>52. Rapid as the pierced wood in the hands of a playful child, which he whirls quickly round with a well-fastened cord.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></a></p>  
 <p>53. He has the loins of an antelope, and the thighs of an ostrich; he trots like a wolf, and gallops like a young fox.</p>  
 <p>54. Firm are his haunches; and when his hinder parts are turned towards you, he fills the space between his legs with a long thick tail, which touches not the ground, and inclines not to either side.</p>  
 <p>55. His back, when he stands in his stall, resembles the smooth stone on which perfumes are mixed for a bride, or the seeds of coloquinteda are bruised.</p>  
 <p>56. The blood of the swift game, which remains on his neck, is like the crimson juice of hinna on gray flowing locks.</p>  
 <p>57. He bears us speedily to a herd of wild cattle, in which the heifers are fair as the virgins in black trailing robes, who dance round <i>the idol</i> Dewaar:</p>  
 <p>58. They turn their backs, and appear like the variegated shells of Yemen on the neck of a youth distinguished in his tribe for a multitude of noble kinsmen.</p>  
 <p>59. He soon brings us up to the foremost of the beasts, and leaves the rest far behind; nor has the herd time to disperse itself.</p>  
 <p>60. He runs from wild bulls to wild heifers, and overpowers them in a single heat, without being bathed, or even moistened, with sweat.</p>  
 <p>61. Then the busy cook dresses the game, roasting part, baking part on hot stones, and quickly boiling the rest in a vessel of iron.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></a></p>  
 <p>62. In the evening we depart; and when the beholder's eye ascends to the head of my hunter, and then descends to his feet, it is unable at once to take in all his beauties.</p>  
 <p>63. His trappings and girths are still upon him: he stands erect before me, not yet loosed for pasture.</p>  
 <p>64. O friend, seest thou the lightning, whose flashes resemble the quick glance of two hands, amid clouds. raised above clouds?</p>  
 <p>65. The fire of it gleams like the lamps of a hermit, when the oil poured on them shakes the cord by which they are suspended.</p>  
 <p>66. I sit gazing at it, while my companions stand between Daaridge and Odhaib; but far distant is the cloud on which my eyes are fixed.</p>  
 <p>67. Its right side seems to pour its rain on <i>the hills of</i> Katan, and its left on <i>the mountains of</i> Sitaar and Yadbul.</p>  
 <p>68. It continues to discharge its waters over Cotaifa till the rushing torrent lays prostrate the groves of canahbel-trees.</p>  
 <p>69. It passes over <i>mount</i> Kenaan, which it deluges in its course, and forces the wild goats to descend from every cliff.</p>  
 <p>70. On <i>mount</i> Taima it leaves not one trunk of a palm tree, nor a single edifice, which is not built with well-cemented stone.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></a></p>  
 <p>71. Mount Tebeir stands in the heights of the flood, like a venerable chief wrapped in a striped mantle.</p>  
 <p>72. The summit of Mogaimir, covered with the rubbish which the torrent has rolled down, looks in the morning like the top of a spindle encircled with wool.</p>  
 <p>73. The cloud unloads its freight on the desert of Ghabeit, like a merchant of Yemen alighting with his bales of rich apparel.</p>  
 <p>74. The small birds of the valley warble at daybreak, as if they had taken their early draught of generous wine mixed with spice.</p>  
 <p>75. The beasts of the wood, drowned in the floods of night, float, like the roots of wild onions, at the distant edge of the lake.</p>
