 <h4><strong>T</strong>HE <strong>S</strong>EVEN <strong>S</strong>OULS
 OF THE <strong>E</strong>GYPTOLOGISTS. </h4>
 
 <p>
 If one turns to those wells of information, "<em>The Natural
 Genesis</em>" and the<em> Lectures </em>of Mr. Gerald Massey,
 the proofs of the antiquity of the doctrine under analysis become
 positively overwhelming. That the belief of the author differs
 from ours can hardly invalidate the facts. He views the symbol
 from a purely natural standpoint, one perhaps a trifle too materialistic,
 because too much that of an ardent Evolutionist and follower of
 the modern Darwinian dogmas. Thus he shows that "the student
 of Bohme's books finds much in them concerning these Seven Fountain
 Spirits and primary powers, treated as seven properties of nature
 in the alchemistic and astrological phase of the mediaeval mysteries;"*
 and adds --
 </p><blockquote>
 "The followers of Bohme look on such matter as divine revelation
 of his inspired Seership. They know nothing of the natural genesis,
 the history and persistence of the Wisdom** of the past (or of
 the broken links), and are unable to recognise the physical features
 of the ancient Seven Spirits beneath their modern metaphysical
 or alchemist mask. A second connecting link between the Theosophy
 of Bohme and the physical origins of Egyptian thought, is extant
 in the fragments of <em>Hermes Trismegistus.*** </em>No matter
 whether these teachings are called Illuminatist, Buddhist, Kabalist,
 Gnostic, Masonic, or Christian, the elemental types can only be
 truly known in their beginnings.**** When the prophets or visionary
 showmen of cloudland come to us claiming original inspiration,
 and utter something new, we judge of its value by what it is in
 itself. But if we find they bring us the ancient matter which
 they cannot account for, and we can, it is natural that we should
 judge it by the primary significations rather than the latest
 pretensions.***** It is useless for us to read our

 ** Yet there are some, who may know something of these, even outside
 the author's lines, wide as they undeniably are.

 *** This connecting link, like others, was pointed out by the
 present writer nine years before the appearance of the work from
 which the above is quoted, namely in <em>Isis</em> <em>Unveiled,
 </em>a work full of such guiding links between ancient, mediaeval,
 and modern thought, but, unfortunately, too loosely edited.
 </p><p>
 **** Ay; but how can the learned writer prove that these "beginnings"
 were precisely in Egypt, and nowhere else; and only 50,000 years
 ago?
 </p><p>
 ***** Precisely: and this is just what the Theosophists do. They
 have never claimed," (original inspiration," not even
 as mediums, but have always pointed, and do now point to the "primary
 signification" of the symbols, which they trace to other

 later thought into the earliest types of expression, and then
 say the ancients meant that.* Subtilized interpretations which
 have become doctrines and dogmas in theosophy have now to be tested
 by their genesis in physical phenomena, in order that we may explode
 their false pretensions to supernatural origin or supernatural
 knowledge.*
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 But the able author of the "Book of the Beginnings"
 and of "<em>The</em> <em>Natural Genesis</em>"<em> </em>does
 -- very fortunately, for us -- quite the reverse. He demonstrates
 most triumphantly our Esoteric (Buddhist) teachings, by showing
 them identical with those of Egypt. Let the reader judge from
 his learned lecture on "The Seven Souls of Man."** Says
 the author: --
 </p><p>
 "The first form of the mystical <strong>S</strong>EVEN was
 seen to be figured in heaven by the Seven large stars of the <em>great
 Bear, </em>the constellation assigned by the Egyptians to the
 Mother of Time, and of the Seven Elemental Powers."
 </p><p>
 Just so, for the Hindus place in the <em>great Bear </em>their
 seven primitive Rishis and call this constellation the abode of
 the <em>Saptarishi, Riksha</em> and <em>Chitra-Sikhandinas. </em>But
 whether it is only an astronomical myth or a primordial mystery,
 having a deeper meaning than it bears on its surface, is what
 their adepts claim to know. We are also told that "the Egyptians
 divided the face of the sky by night into seven parts. The primary
 Heaven was seven-fold." So it was with the Aryans. One has
 but read the Puranas about the beginnings of Brahma, and his "Egg"
 to see it. Have the Aryans taken the idea from the Egyptians?
 -- "The earliest forces," proceeds the lecturer, "recognized
 in nature were reckoned as seven in number. These became seven
 elementals, devils (?) or later, divinities. Seven properties
 were assigned to nature, as
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 [[Continued from previous page]] countries, older even than Egypt;
 <em>significations, </em>moreover, which emanate from a hierarchy
 (or hierarchies, if preferred) of <em>living wise men</em>, mortals,
 notwithstanding that Wisdom, who reject every approach to <em>supernaturalism.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 * But where is the proof that the ancients did not mean precisely
 that which the theosophists claim? Records exist for what they
 say, just as other records exist for what Mr. G. Massey says.
 His interpretations are very correct, but equally one-sided. Surely
 nature has more than one <em>physical aspect; </em>for astronomy,
 astrology, and so on, are all on the physical, not the spiritual
 plane.
 </p><p>
 ** It is to be feared that Mr. Massey has not succeeded. We have
 our followers as he has his followers, and materialistic Science
 steps in and takes little account of both his and our speculations!
 </p><p>
 The fact that this learned Egyptologist does not recognise in
 the doctrine of the "Seven Souls," as he terms our <em>principles,
 </em>or "metaphysical concepts," but "the primitive
 biology or physiology of the Soul," does not invalidate our
 argument. The lecturer touches on only two keys, those that unlock
 the astronomical and the physiological mysteries of esotericism,
 and leaves out the other five. Otherwise he would have promptly
 understood that what he calls the <em>physiological </em>divisions
 of the living Soul of man, are regarded by theosophists as also
 psychological and spiritual.</p><hr>
 
 <p>
 [[Vol. 2, Page]] 632 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.
 </p><p>
 matter, cohesion, fluxion, coagulation, accumulation, station,
 and division and <em>seven elements or souls to man.</em>"<i>
 </i>
 </p><p>
 All this was taught in the esoteric doctrine, but it was interpreted
 and its mysteries unlocked, as already stated, with <em>seven,
 </em>not two, or at the utmost, three keys; hence the causes and
 their effects worked in invisible or mystic as well as psychic
 nature, and were made referable to metaphysics and psychology
 as much as to physiology. "The principle of <em>sevening</em>"<em>
 -- </em>as the author says -- "was introduced, and the number
 seven supplied a sacred type <em>that could be used for manifold
 purposes</em>"<em>; </em>and it was so used. For "the
 seven Souls of the Pharaoh are often mentioned in the Egyptian
 texts. . . . <em>Seven Souls or principles in man were</em> <em>identified
 by our British Druids</em>. . . . . The Rabbins also ran the number
 of souls up to seven; so, likewise, do the Karens of India. .
 . ."
 </p><p>
 And then, the author tabulates the two teachings -- the Esoteric
 and the Egyptian, -- and shows that the latter had the same series
 and in the same order.
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd2-632.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><p>
 Further on, the lecturer formulates these seven (Egyptian) souls,
 as (1) The Soul of Blood -- the<em> formative</em>; (2)<em> </em>The
 Soul of Breath -- "that <em>breathes</em>";<em> </em>(3)<em>
 </em>The Shade or Covering Soul -- "that <em>envelopes</em>";<em>
 </em>(4) The Soul of Perception -- "that <em>perceives</em>;"<em>
 </em>(5)<em> </em>The Soul of Pubescence "that <em>procreates</em>";<em>
 </em>(6) The Intellectual Soul -- "that<em> reproduces intellectually</em>";<em>
 </em>and (7) The Spiritual Soul -- "that is <em>perpetuated
 permanently.</em>"
 </p><p>
 From the exoteric and physiological standpoint this may be very
 correct; it becomes less so from the esoteric point of view. To
 maintain this, does not at all mean that the "Esoteric Buddhists"
 <em>resolve men into</em> <em>a number of elementary Spirits,
 </em>as Mr. G. Massey, in the same lecture, accuses them of maintaining.
 No "Esoteric Buddhist" has ever been guilty of any such
 absurdity. Nor has it been ever imagined that these shadows "become
 spiritual beings in another world," or "seven potential
 spirits or elementaries of another life." What is maintained
 is simply that every time the immortal <em>Ego</em> incarnates
 it becomes, as a total, a com-
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------

 <p>
 * This is a great mistake made in the Esoteric enumeration. Manas
 is the fifth, not the fourth; and <em>Manas </em>corresponds precisely
 with <em>Seb, </em>the Egyptian fifth principle, for that portion
 of Manas, which follows the two higher principles, is the ancestral
 soul, indeed, the bright, immortal thread of the higher Ego, to
 which clings the Spiritual aroma of all the lives or births.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 633 THE "PRINCIPLES" IN THE EGYPTIAN
 METAPHYSICS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 pound unit of Matter and Spirit, which together act on seven different
 planes of being and consciousness. Elsewhere, Mr. G. Massey adds:
 -- "The seven souls (our "Principles") are often
 mentioned in the Egyptian texts. The moon god, Taht-Esmun, or
 the later sun god, expressed the seven nature-powers that were
 prior to himself, and were summed up in him as his seven souls
 (we say "principles") . . . . The seven stars in the
 hand of Christ in the Revelation, have the same significance,"
 etc.
 </p><p>
 And a still greater one, as these stars represent also the <em>seven
 keys </em>of the Seven Churches or the <strong>S</strong>ODALIAN
 <strong>M</strong>YSTERIES, cabalistically. However, we will not
 stop to discuss, but add that other Egyptologists have also found
 out that the septenary constitution of man was a cardinal doctrine
 with the old Egyptians. In a series of remarkable articles in
 the "Sphinx" (Munich) Herr Franz Lambert gives incontrovertible
 proof of his conclusions from the "Book of the Dead"
 and other Egyptian records. For details the reader must be referred
 to the articles themselves, but the following diagram, summing
 up the author's conclusions, is demonstrative evidence of the
 identity of Egyptian psychology with the septenary division in
 "Esoteric Buddhism."
 </p><p>
 On the left hand side the Kabalistic names of the corresponding
 human principles are placed, and on the right the hieroglyphic
 names with their renderings as in the diagram of F. Lambert.
 </p><p>
 <img src="sd2-633.gif" align="BOTTOM"> 
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * There seems a confusion -- lasting for many centuries -- in
 the minds of Western Kabalists. They call <em>Ruach </em>(Spirit)
 what we call <em>Kama</em>-rupa; whereas, with us Ruach would
 be the "Spiritual Soul" <em>Buddhi,</em> and<em> Nephesh
 </em>the 4th principle, the Vital, Animal Soul. Eliphas Levi falls
 into the same error.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 634 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 This is a very fair representation of the number of the "principles"
 of Occultism, but much confused; and this is what we call the
 7 principles in man, and what Mr. Massey calls "Souls,"
 giving the same name to the Ego or the <em>Monad </em>which reincarnates
 and <em>resurrects, </em>so to speak, at each rebirth, as the
 Egyptians did, namely -- "the Renewed." But how can
 Ruach (Spirit) be lodged in Kama-rupa? What does Bohme, the Prince
 of all the mediaeval Seers, say?
 </p><p>
 "We find Seven especial properties in nature whereby this
 only Mother works all things" (which he calls -- fire, light,
 sound (the upper three) and <em>desire, bitterness, anguish, </em>and<em>
 substantiality, </em>thus analysing the lower in his own mystic
 way) . . . "whatever the six forms are spiritually, that
 the seventh, the body (or substantiality), is essentially."
 These are the seven forms of the Mother of all Beings from whence
 all that is in this world is generated,* and again in <em>Aurora
 xxiv. p. </em>27 (quoted in <em>Natural Genesis</em>)<em> -- </em>"The
 Creator hath in the body of this world generated himself as it
 were <em>creaturely </em>in his qualifying Fountain Spirits, and
 all the stars are . . . God's powers, and the whole body of the
 world consisteth in the seven qualifying or Fountain Spirits."
 </p><p>
 This is rendering in mystical language our theosophical doctrine.
 . . But how can we agree with Mr. G. Massey when he states that
 --
 </p><p>
 "The Seven <em>Races </em>of men that have been sublimated
 and made Planetary (?) by Esoteric Buddhism,** may be met with
 in the Bundahish as (1) the earth-men; (2) water-men; (3) breast-eared
 men; (4) breast-eyed men; (5) one-legged men; (6) bat-winged men;
 (7) men with tails." . . . Each of these descriptions, allegorical
 and even perverted in their later form -- is, nevertheless, an
 echo of the Secret Doctrine teaching. They all refer to the pre-Human
 evolution of the water-men "terrible and bad" by <em>unaided
 </em>Nature through millions of years, as previously described.
 But we deny point blank the assertion made that "these were
 never real races," and point to the Archaic Stanzas for our
 answer. It is easy to infer and to say that our "instructors
 have mistaken these shadows of the Past, for things human and
 spiritual"; but that "they are neither, and never were
 either," it is less easy to prove. The assertion must ever
 remain on a par with the Darwinian claim that man and the ape
 had a common pithecoid ancestor. What the Lecturer takes for a
 "mode of expression" and nothing more, in the Egyptian
 Ritual, we take as having quite another and an important meaning.
 Here is one instance. Says the Ritual, the "Book of the Dead"
 --

 ** This is indeed news! It makes us fear that the Lecturer had
 never read "Esoteric Buddhism" before criticising it,
 as there are too many such misconceptions in his notices of it.
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 635 MAN, THE PARENT OF ALL THE MAMMALS.

 <p>
 "I am the mouse." "I am the hawk." "I
 am the ape." . . . "<em>I am the crocodile whose Soul
 Comes </em>FROM MEN." "<em>I am the Soul of the Gods.</em>"<em>
 </em>Of these last two sentences, one: "whose soul comes
 from men" -- is explained by the Lecturer, who says parenthetically,
 "<em>that is, as a type</em> <em>of intelligence,</em>"<em>
 </em>and the other: "<em>I am the Soul of the Gods,</em>"<em>
 </em>as meaning, "the Horus, or Christ, as the outcome of
 all."
 </p><p>
 The occult teaching answers: "It means far more." .
 . .
 </p><p>
 It gives first of all a corroboration of the teaching that, while
 the human monad has passed on globe <em>A</em> and others, in
 the First Round, through all the three kingdoms -- the mineral,
 the vegetable, and the animal -- in this our Fourth Round, every
 mammal has sprung from Man if the semi-ethereal, many-shaped creature
 with the <em>human </em>Monad in it, of the first two races, can
 be regarded as Man. But it must be so called; for, in the esoteric
 language, it is not the form of flesh, blood, and bones, now referred
 to as Man, which is in any way the <strong>M</strong>AN, but the
 inner divine <strong>M</strong>ONAD with its manifold principles
 or aspects.
 </p><p>
 The lecture referred to, however, much as it opposes "Esoteric
 Buddhism" and its teachings, is an eloquent answer to those
 who have tried to represent the whole as a newfangled doctrine.
 And there are many such, in Europe, America, and even India. Yet,
 between the esotericism of the old Arhats, and that which has
 now survived in India among the few Brahmins who have seriously
 studied their Secret Philosophy, the difference does not appear
 so very great. It seems centred in, and limited to, the question
 of the order of the evolution of cosmic and other principles,
 more than anything else. At all events it is no greater divergence
 than the everlasting question of the <em>filioque </em>dogma,
 which since the <strong>XII</strong>th. century has separated
 the Roman Catholic from the older Greek Eastern Church. Yet, whatever
 the differences in the forms in which the septenary dogma is presented,
 the substance is there, and its presence and importance in the
 Brahminical system may be judged by what one of India's learned
 metaphysicians and Vedantic scholars says of it: --
 </p><p>
 "The real esoteric seven-fold classification is one of the
 most important, if not the most important classification, which
 has received its arrangement from the mysterious constitution
 of this eternal type. I may also mention in this connection that
 the four-fold classification claims the same origin. The light
 of life, as it were, seems to be refracted by the treble-faced
 prism of Prakriti, having the three Gunams for its three faces,
 and divided into seven rays, which develop in course of time the
 seven principles of this classification. The progress of development
 presents some points of similarity to the gradual development
 of the rays of the spectrum. While the four-fold classification
 is amply</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 636 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 sufficient for all practical purposes, this real seven-fold classification
 is of great theoretical and scientific importance. It will be
 necessary to adopt it to explain certain classes of phenomena
 noticed by occultists; and it is perhaps better fitted to be the
 basis of a perfect system of psychology. It is not the peculiar
 property of 'the trans-Himalayan esoteric doctrine.' In fact,
 it has a closer connection with the Brahminical Logos than with
 the Buddhist Logos. In order to make my meaning clear I may point
 out here that the Logos has seven forms. In other words, there
 are seven kinds of Logoi in the Cosmos. Each of these has become
 the central figure of one of the seven main branches of the ancient
 Wisdom-religion. This classification is not the seven-fold classification
 we have adopted. I make this assertion without the slightest fear
 of contradiction. The real classification has all the requisites
 of a scientific classification. It has seven distinct principles,
 which correspond with seven distinct states of Pragna or consciousness.
 It bridges the gulf between the objective and subjective, and
 indicates the mysterious circuit through which ideation passes.
 The seven principles are allied to seven states of matter, and
 to seven forms of force. These principles are harmoniously arranged
 between two poles, which define the limits of <em>human</em> consciousness."*
 </p><p>
 The above is perfectly correct, save, perhaps, one point. The
 "sevenfold classification" in the esoteric system has
 never been claimed (to the writer's knowledge) by any one belonging
 to it, as "the peculiar property of the Trans-Himalayan esoteric
 doctrine"; but only as having survived in that old school
 alone. It is no more the property of the<em> trans, </em>than
 it is of the <em>cis</em>-Himalayan esoteric doctrine, but is
 simply the common inheritance of all such schools, left to the
 sages of the Fifth Root Race by the great Siddhas** of the Fourth.
 Let us remember that the Atlanteans became the terrible sorcerers,
 now celebrated in so many of the oldest <strong>MSS</strong>.
 of India, only toward their fall, the submersion of their continent
 having been brought on by it. What is claimed is simply the fact
 that the wisdom imparted by the "Divine Ones" -- born
 through the <em>Kriyasakti powers </em>of the Third Race before
 its Fall and Separation into sexes -- to the adepts of the early
 Fourth Race, has remained in all its pristine purity in a certain
 Brotherhood. The said

 ** According to <em>Svetasvatara-Upanishad </em>(357) the Siddhas
 are those who are possessed from birth of <em>superhuman </em>powers,
 as also of "knowledge and indifference to the world."
 According to the Occult teachings, however, Siddhas are the <em>Nirmanakayas</em>
 or the "spirits" (in the sense of an individual, or
 <em>conscious </em>spirit) of great sages from spheres on a higher
 plane than our own, who voluntarily incarnate in mortal bodies
 in order to help the human race in its upward progress. Hence

 School or Fraternity being closely connected with a certain island
 of an inland sea, believed in by both Hindus and Buddhists, but
 called "mythical" by geographers and Orientalists, the
 less one talks of it, the wiser he will be. Nor can one accept
 the said "sevenfold classification" as having "a
 closer connection with the Brahminical Logos than with the Buddhist
 Logos," since both are identical, whether the one "Logos"
 is called <em>Eswara </em>or<em> Avalokiteswara, </em>Brahma or
 Padmapani. These are, however, very small differences, more fanciful
 than real, in fact. Brahmanism and Buddhism, both viewed from
 their orthodox aspects, are as inimical and as irreconcilable
 as water and oil. Each of these great bodies, however, has a vulnerable
 place in its constitution. While even in their esoteric interpretation
 both can agree but to disagree, once that their respective vulnerable
 points are confronted, every disagreement must fall, for the two
 will find themselves on common ground. The "heel of Achilles"
 of orthodox Brahmanism is the Adwaita philosophy, whose followers
 are called by the pious "Buddhists in disguise"; as
 that of orthodox Buddhism is Northern mysticism, as represented
 by the disciples of the philosophies of Aryasanga (the Yogacharya
 School) and Mahayana, who are twitted in their turn by their correligionists
 as "Vedantins in disguise." The esoteric philosophy
 of both these can be but one if carefully analysed and compared,
 as Gautama Buddha and Sankaracharya are most closely connected,
 if one believes tradition and certain esoteric teachings. Thus
 every difference between the two will be found one of form rather
 than of substance.
 </p><p>
 A most mystic discourse, full of septenary symbology, may be found
 in the <em>Anugita.* </em>There the Brahmana narrates the bliss
 of having crossed beyond the regions of illusion, "in which
 fancies are the gadflies and mosquitoes, in which grief and joy
 are cold and heat, in which delusion is the blinding darkness,
 avarice, the beasts of prey and reptiles, and desire and anger
 are the obstructors." . . . . The sage describes the entrance
 into and exit from the forest (a symbol for man's life-time) and
 also that forest itself:**
 </p><p>
 "In that forest are seven large trees (the Senses, Mind and
 Understanding, or Manas and Buddhi included), seven fruits and
 seven guests; seven hermitages, seven (forms of) concentration,
 and seven (forms of) initiation. This is the description of the
 forest. That forest is filled with trees producing splendid flowers
 and fruits of five colours."

 </p><p>
 ** I propose to follow here the text and the editor's commentaries,
 who accepts Arjuna Misra and Nilakantha's <em>dead-letter explanations.
 </em>Our Orientalists never trouble to think that if a native
 commentator is a non-initiate, he could not explain correctly,
 and if an <em>Initiate, </em>would not.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 638 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 "The senses," says the commentator, "are called
 trees, as being producers of the fruits . . . . pleasures and
 pains; the <em>guests </em>are the powers of each sense personified
 -- they receive the fruits above described; the hermitages are
 the trees, in which the guests take shelter. The seven forms of
 concentration are the exclusion from the self of the seven functions
 of the seven senses, etc., already referred to; the seven forms
 of initiation refer to the initiation into the higher life . .
 . by repudiating as not one's own the actions of each member out
 of the group of seven." (See Khandagya, p. 219, and Com.)
 </p><p>
 The explanation is harmless, if unsatisfactory.
 </p><p>
 Says the Brahmana continuing his description: --
 </p><p>
 "That forest is filled with trees producing flowers and fruits
 of four colours. That forest is filled with trees producing flowers
 and fruits of three colours, and mixed. That forest is filled
 with trees producing flowers and fruits of two colours, and of
 beautiful colours. That forest is filled with trees producing
 flowers and fruits of one colour and fragrant. That forest is
 filled (instead of seven) with two large trees producing numerous
 flowers and fruits of undistinguished colours (<em>mind and understanding
 -- the two higher senses, </em>or theosophically, 'Manas-Buddhi').
 Here is one Fire (Self) here connected with the Brahman* and having
 a good mind (or <em>true knowledge, </em>according to Arjuna Misra).
 And there is fuel here, namely, the five senses (or human passions).
 The Seven (<em>forms of</em>)<em> </em>emancipation from them
 are the Seven (<em>forms of</em>)<em> </em>initiation. The qualities
 are the fruits. . . . There, the great Sages receive hospitality.
 And when they have been worshipped and have disappeared, another
 forest shines forth, in which <em>intelligence is the tree, </em>and
 emancipation the fruit, and which possesses shade (<em>in the
 form of</em>)<em> </em>tranquillity, which depends on Knowledge,
 which has contentment for its water, and the <strong>K</strong>SHETRAGNA
 (the "<em>Supreme </em><strong>S</strong>ELF," says
 Krishna, in the Bhagavad Gita, p. 102<em> et seq.</em>) within
 for the Sun."
 </p><p>
 Now, all the above is very plain, and no theosophist, even among
 the least learned, could fail to understand the allegory. And
 yet, we see great Orientalists making a perfect mess of it in
 their explanations. The "great sages" who "receive
 hospitality" are explained as meaning <em>the senses, </em>"which,
 having worked <em>as unconnected with the self </em>are finally
 absorbed into it." But one fails to understand, if the senses
 are "unconnected" with the "Higher Self,"
 in what manner can they be
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The English editor explains here, saying, "I presume devoted
 to the Brahman." This would be a very poor devotion, indeed,
 in the accomplishment of the gradually emancipating process of
 Yoga. We venture to say that the "Fire" or Self is the
 higher real <strong>S</strong>ELF "connected with,"
 that is to say <em>one with Brahma, </em>the One Deity. The "Self"
 separates itself no longer from the universal Spirit.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 639 THE ALLEGORY EXPLAINED. </h6>
 
 <p>
 "absorbed into it." One would think, on the contrary,
 that just because the personal senses gravitate and strive to
 be connected with the <em>impersonal </em>Self, that the latter,
 which is <strong>F</strong>IRE, burns the lower five and purifies
 thereby the higher two, "mind and understanding" or
 the higher aspects of <em>Manas* </em>and<em> Buddhi. </em>This<em>
 </em>is quite apparent from the text. The "great sages"
 <em>disappear </em>after having "been worshipped." Worshipped
 by whom if they (the presumed senses) are "unconnected with
 the self"? By<strong> M</strong>IND, of course; by Manas
 (in this case merged in the <em>sixth sense</em>)<em> </em>which
 is not, and cannot be, the Brahman, the <strong>S</strong>ELF,
 or Kshetragna -- the soul's spiritual sun. Into the latter, in
 time, Manas itself must be absorbed. It has worshipped "great
 sages" and given hospitality to <em>terrestrial </em>wisdom:
 but once that "another forest shone forth" upon it,
 it is Intelligence (Buddhi, the 7th sense, but 6th principle)
 which is transformed into <em>the</em> tree -- that tree whose
 fruit is emancipation -- which finally destroys the very roots
 of the Aswattha tree, the symbol of <em>life </em>and of its illusive
 joys and pleasures. And therefore, those who attain to that state
 of emancipation have, in the words of the above-cited sage, "no
 fear afterwards." In this state "the end cannot be perceived
 because it extends on all sides."
 </p><p>
 "There always dwell seven females there," he goes on
 to say, carrying out the imagery. These females, who, according
 to Arjuna Misra, are the Mahat, Ahamkara and five Tanmatras, have
 always their faces turned downwards, as they are obstacles in
 the way of spiritual ascension.
 </p><p>
 "<em> </em>. . . . In that same (Brahman, the 'Self') the
 Seven perfect Sages, together with their chiefs, abide and again
 emerge from the same. Glory, brilliance and greatness, enlightenment,
 victory, perfection and power -- these seven rays follow after
 this same Sun (Kshetragna, the Higher Self). . . . Those whose
 wishes are reduced (unselfish). . . . whose sins (passions) are
 burnt up by restraint, merging the Self in the Self,t**devote
 themselves to Brahman. Those people who understand the forest
 of Knowledge (Brahman, or <strong>S</strong>ELF) praise tranquillity.
 And aspiring to that forest, they are (re-) born so as not to
 lose courage.

 * As Mahat (universal intelligence) is first born, or manifests,
 as Vishnu, and then, when it falls into matter and develops self-consciousness,
 it becomes Egoism, Selfishness, so <em>Manas </em>is of a dual
 nature. It is respectively under the sun and moon, for as Sankaracharya
 says "The moon is the mind, and the sun the understanding."
 The sun and moon are the deities of our planetary Macrocosmos,
 and therefore Sankara adds that "the mind and the understanding
 are the respective deities of the (human) organs" (<em>vide</em>
 Brihadaranyaka, pp. 521,<em> et seq</em>.) This is perhaps why
 Arjuna Misra says that the moon and the <em>Fire </em>(the self,
 the sun) constitute the universe.
 </p><p>
 ** "The body in the Soul," as Arjuna Misra is credited
 with saying, or rather the "Soul in the Spirit," and
 on a still higher plane of development: "the <strong>S</strong>ELF
 or Atman in the Universal Self."</p><hr>

 Such indeed, is this holy forest . . . . and understanding it,
 they (the Sages) act accordingly, being directed by the <strong>K</strong>SHETRAGNA.

 No translator among the Western Orientalists has yet perceived
 in the foregoing allegory anything higher than mysteries connected
 with sacrificial ritualism, penance, or ascetic ceremonies, and
 <em>Hatha Yoga. </em>But he who understands symbolical imagery,
 and hears the voice of <strong>S</strong>ELF WITHIN <strong>S</strong>ELF,
 will see in this something far higher than mere ritualism, however
 often he may err in minor details of the philosophy.
 </p><p>
 And here, we must be allowed a last remark. No true theosophist,
 from the most ignorant up to the most learned, ought to claim
 infallibility for anything he may say or write upon occult matters.
 The chief point is to admit that, in many a way, in the classification
 of either cosmic or human principles, in addition to mistakes
 in the order of evolution, and especially on metaphysical questions,
 those of us who pretend to teach others more ignorant than ourselves
 -- are all liable to err. Thus mistakes have been made in "Isis
 Unveiled," in "Esoteric Buddhism," in "Man,"
 in "Magic: White and Black," etc., etc.; and more than
 one mistake is likely to be found in the present work. This cannot
 be helped. For a large or even a small work on such abstruse subjects
 to be entirely exempt from error and blunder, it would have to
 be written from its first to its last page by a great adept, if
 not by an Avatar. Then only should we say, "This is verily
 a work without sin or blemish in it!" But, so long as the
 artist is imperfect, how can his work be perfect? "Endless
 is the search for truth!" Let us love it and aspire to it
 for its own sake, and not for the glory or benefit a minute portion
 of its revelation may confer on us. For who of us can presume
 to have the <em>whole </em>truth at his fingers' ends, even upon
 one minor teaching of Occultism?
 </p><p>
 Our chief point in the present subject, however, was to show that
 the Septenary doctrine, or division of the constitution of man,
 was a very ancient one, and was not invented by us. This has been
 successfully done, for we are supported in this, consciously and
 unconsciously, by a number of ancient, mediaeval, and modern writers.
 What the former said, was well said; what the latter repeated,
 was generally distorted. An instance: Read the "Pythagorean
 Fragments," and compare the Septenary man as given by the
 Rev. G. Oliver, the learned mason, in his "Pythagorean Triangle"
 (ch. on "<em>Science of Numbers,</em>"<em> </em>p. 179).
 </p><p>
 He speaks as follows: --
 </p><p>
 "The Theosophic Philosophy counted SEVEN <em>properties </em>(or
 principles), in Man, viz.: --
 </p><p>
 (1.) The divine golden Man;
 </p><p>
 (2.) The inward holy body from fire and light, like pure silver;
 </p><hr>
 
 <p>
 [[Vol. 2, Page]] 641 HYPNOTISM IS -- SATANISM.
 </p><p>
 (3.) The elemental man;
 </p><p>
 (4.) The mercurial paradisiacal man;
 </p><p>
 (5.) The martial Soul-like man;
 </p><p>
 (6.) The passionate man of desires;
 </p><p>
 (7.) The Solar man; a witness to and inspector of the wonders
 of the Universe. They had also <em>seven fountain </em>Spirits,
 or Powers of Nature."
 </p><p>
 Compare this jumbled account and distribution of Western theosophic
 philosophy with the latest theosophic explanations by the Eastern
 School of Theosophy, and then decide which is the more correct.
 Verily: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "Wisdom hath builded her house,<br>
 She hath hewn out her <em>seven pillars.</em>"<em> -- </em>(<em>Prov.
 ix, </em>1<em>.</em>)
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 As to the charge that our School has not adopted the Seven-fold
 classification of the Brahmins, but has confused it, it is quite
 unjust. To begin with, the "School" is one thing, its
 exponents (<em>to Europeans</em>) quite another. The latter have
 first to learn the A B C of practical Eastern Occultism, before
 they can be made to understand correctly the tremendously abstruse
 classification based on the seven distinct states of<em> Pragna
 </em>(consciousness); and, above all, to realize thoroughly <em>what
 Pragna is, </em>in the Eastern metaphysics. To give a Western
 student that classification is to try to make him suppose that
 he can account for the origin of consciousness, by accounting
 for the process by which a certain knowledge, through <em>only
 one of the states </em>of that consciousness, came to him; in
 other words, it is to make him account for something he knows
 on <em>this </em>plane, by something he knows nothing about on
 the other planes; <em>i.e.</em>, to lead him from the spiritual
 and the psychological, direct to the ontological. This is why
 the primary, old, classification was adopted by the Theosophists,
 of which classifications there are many.
 </p><p>
 To busy oneself, after such a tremendous number of independent
 witnesses and proofs have been brought before the public, with
 an additional enumeration from theological sources, would be quite
 useless. The seven capital sins and seven virtues of the Christian
 scheme are far less philosophical than even the Seven Liberal
 and the Seven Accursed Sciences -- or the Seven Arts of enchantment
 of the Gnostics. For one of the latter is now before the public,
 pregnant with danger in the present as for the future. The modern
 name for it is <strong>H</strong>YPNOTISM. In the ignorance of
 the seven principles, and used by scientific and ignorant materialists,
 it will soon become <strong>S</strong>ATANISM in the full acceptation
 of the term.
