 </p><p>
 <b>T</b>HE data derived from scientific research as to "primeval
 man" and the ape lend no countenance to theories deriving
 the former from the latter. "Where, then, must we look for
 primeval man?" still queries Mr. Huxley, after having vainly
 searched for him in the very depths of the quaternary strata.
 "Was the oldest <i>Homo sapiens </i>Pliocene or Miocene,
 or yet more ancient? In still older strata do the fossilized bones
 of <i>an ape more anthropoid,</i> or<i> a man more pithecoid </i>than
 any yet known, await the researches of some unborn palaeontologist?
 Time will show . . . ." ("Man's Place in Nature,"
 p. 159).
 </p><p>
 It will -- undeniably -- and thus vindicate the anthropology of
 the Occultists. Meanwhile, in his eagerness to vindicate Mr. Darwin's
 <i>Descent of Man, </i>Mr. Boyd Dawkins believes he has all but
 found the "missing link" -- in theory. It was due to
 theologians more than to geologists that, till nearly 1860, man
 had been considered a relic no older than the Adamic orthodox
 6,000 years. As Karma would have it though, it was left to a French
 Abbe -- l'abbe Bourgeois -- to give this easy-going theory even
 a worse blow than had been given to it by the discoveries of Boucher
 de Perthes. Everyone knows that the Abbe discovered and brought
 to light good evidence that man already existed during the Miocene
 period; for flints of undeniably human making were excavated from
 Miocene strata. In the words of the author of "Modern Science
 and Modern Thought": --
 </p><blockquote>
 "They must either have been chipped by man, or, as Mr. Boyd
 Dawkins supposes, by the Dryopithecus or some other anthropoid
 ape which had a dose of intelligence so much superior to the gorilla,
 or chimpanzee, as to be able to fabricate tools. But in this case
 the problem would be solved and the missing link discovered, for
 such an ape might well have been the <i>ancestor </i>of Palaeolithic
 man."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Or -- <i>the descendant of Eocene Man, </i>which is a variant
 offered to the theory. Meanwhile, the Dryopithecus with such fine
 mental endowments is yet to be discovered. On the other hand,
 Neolithic and even Palaeolithic man having become an absolute
 certainty, -- and, as the same author justly observes: "If
 100,000,000 years have elapsed since</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 676 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 the earth became sufficiently solidified to support vegetable
 and animal life, the Tertiary period may have lasted for 5,000,000;
 or for 10,000,000 years, if the life-sustaining order of things
 has lasted, as Lyell supposes, for at least 200,000,000 years"
 -- why should not another theory be tried? Let us carry man, as
 an hypothesis, to the close of Mesozoic times -- admitting <i>argumenti
 causa </i>that the (much more recent) higher apes then existed!
 This would allow ample time to man and the modern apes to have
 diverged from the mythical "<i>ape more anthropoid,</i>"<i>
 </i>and even for the latter to have degenerated into those that
 are found <i>mimicking </i>man in using "branches of trees
 as clubs, and cracking cocoa-nuts with hammer and stones."*
 Some savage tribes of hillmen in India build their abodes on trees,
 just as the gorillas build their dens. The question, which of
 the two, the beast or the man, has become the imitator of the
 other, is scarcely an open one, even granting Mr. Boyd Dawkins'
 theory. The fanciful character of his hypothesis, is, however,
 generally admitted. It is argued that while in the Pliocene and
 Miocene periods there were true apes and baboons, and man was
 undeniably contemporaneous with the former of those times -- though
 as we see orthodox anthropology still hesitates in the teeth of
 facts to place him in the era of the Dryopithecus, which latter
 "has been considered by some anatomists as in some respects
 superior to the chimpanzee or the gorilla" -- yet, in the
 Eocene there have been no other fossil <i>primates </i>unearthed
 and no pithecoid stocks found save a few extinct lemurian forms.
 And we find it also <i>hinted </i>that the Dryopithecus <i>may
 have been </i>the "missing link," though the brain of
 the creature no more warrants the theory than does the brain of
 the modern gorilla. (<i>Vide </i>also Gaudry's speculations.)
 </p><p>
 Now we would ask who among the Scientists is ready to prove that
 <i>there was no man </i>in existence in the early Tertiary period?
 What is it that prevented his presence? Hardly thirty years ago
 his existence any farther back than 6, or 7,000 years was indignantly
 denied. Now he is refused admission into the Eocene age. Next
 century it may become a question whether man was not contemporary
 with the "flying Dragons;" the pterodactyl, the plesiosaurus
 and iguanodon, etc., etc. Let us listen, however, to the echo
 of Science.

 * This the way <i>primitive man </i>must have acted? We do not
 know of men, not even of savages, in our age, who are known to
 have imitated the apes who live side by side with them in the
 forests of America and the islands. We do know of large apes who,
 tamed and living in houses, will mimic men to the length of donning
 hats and coats. The writer had personally a chimpanzee who, without
 being taught, opened a newspaper and pretended to read in it.
 It is the descending generations, the children, who mimic their
 parents -- not the reverse.</p><hr>

 <blockquote>
 "Now wherever anthropoid apes lived, it is clear that, whether
 as a question of anatomical structure, or of climate and surroundings,
 man, or <i>some creature which was the ancestor of man, </i>might
 have lived also. Anatomically speaking, apes and monkeys are as
 much special variations of the mammalian type as man, whom they
 resemble, bone for bone, and muscle for muscle, and the physical
 animal man is simply an instance of the quadrumanous type specialised
 for erect posture and a larger brain* . . . . If he could survive,
 as we know he did, the adverse conditions and extreme vicissitudes
 of the Glacial period, there is no reason why he might not have
 lived in the semi-tropical climate of the Miocene period, when
 a genial climate extended even to Greenland and Spitzbergen .
 . . "<i> </i>("<i>Modern Science and Modern Thought,</i>"<i>
 p. </i>152.)
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 While most of the men of Science, who are uncompromising in their
 belief in the descent of man from an "extinct anthropoid
 mammal," will not accept even the bare tenability of any
 other theory than an ancestor common to man and the Dryopithecus,
 it is refreshing to find in a work of real scientific value such
 a margin for compromise. Indeed, it is as wide as it can be made
 under the circumstances, <i>i.e.</i>, without immediate danger
 of getting knocked off one's feet by the tidal wave of "science-adulation."
 Believing that the difficulty of accounting "for the development
 of <i>intellect </i>and<i> morality </i>by evolution is <i>not
 so great as that presented by the difference as to physical structure**
 </i>between man and the highest animal," the same author
 says: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "But it is not so easy to see how this difference of physical
 structure arose, and how a being came into existence which had
 such a brain and hand, and such undeveloped capabilities for an
 almost unlimited progress. The difficulty is this: the difference
 in structure between the lowest existing race of man and the highest
 existing ape is too great to admit of the possibility of one being
 the direct descendant of the other. The negro in some respects
 makes a slight approximation towards the Simian type. His skull
 is narrower, his brain less capacious, his muzzle more projecting,
 his arm longer than those of the

 * It is asked, whether it would change one iota of the scientific
 truth and fact contained in the above sentence if it were to read:
 "the ape is simply an instance of the biped type specialized
 for going on all fours, generally, and a smaller brain."
 <i>Esoterically </i>speaking, this is the real truth, and not
 the reverse.
 </p><p>
 ** We cannot follow Mr. Laing here. When avowed Darwinists like
 Huxley point to "the <i>great gulf </i>which intervenes between
 the lowest ape and the highest man in <i>intellectual </i>power,"
 the "<i>enormous gulf </i>. . . between them," the "<i>immeasurable
 and practically infinite </i>divergence of the Human from the
 Simian stirps" (<i>Man</i>'<i>s Place in Nature, </i>pp.
 102-3); when even the physical basis of mind -- the brain -- so<i>
 vastly </i>exceeds in size that of the highest existing apes;
 when men like Wallace are forced to invoke the agency of extra-terrestrial
 intelligences in order to explain the rise of such a creature
 as the Pithecanthropus alalus, or speechless savage of Haeckel,
 to the level of the large-brained and <i>moral</i> man of to-day
 -- it is idle to dismiss Evolutionist puzzles so lightly. If the
 <i>structural </i>evidence is so unconvincing and, taken as a
 whole, so hostile to Darwinism, the difficulties as to the "how"
 of the Evolution of the human <i>mind </i>by natural selection
 are tenfold greater.</p><hr>

 average European man. Still he is essentially a man, and separated
 by a wide gulf from the chimpanzee or the gorilla. <i>Even the
 idiot or cretin, </i>whose brain is no larger and intelligence
 no greater than that of the chimpanzee, is <i>an arrested man,
 not an ape.</i>"
 </blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>
 "If, therefore, the Darwinian theory holds good in the case
 of man and ape, we must go back to some common ancestor from whom
 both may have originated . . . . But to establish this as a <i>fact
 </i>and not a <i>theory </i>we require to find that ancestral
 form, or, at any rate, some intermediate forms tending towards
 it . . . . in other words . . . . the missing link! Now it must
 be admitted that, hitherto, not only have no such missing links
 been discovered, but the oldest known human sculls and skeletons
 which date from the Glacial period, and are probably at least
 100,000 years old, show no very decided approximation towards
 any such pre-human type. On the contrary, <i>one of the oldest
 types, </i>that of the men of the sepulchral cave of Cro-Magnon,*
 <i>is that of a fine race, tall in stature, large in brain, and</i>
 <i>on the whole superior to many of the existing races of mankind.
 </i>The reply of course is that the time is insufficient, <i>and
 if man and the ape had a common ancestor, </i>that as a highly
 developed anthropoid ape, certainly, and man, probably, already
 existed in the Miocene period, such ancestor must be sought still
 further back at a distance compared with which the whole Quaternary
 period sinks into insignificance . . . . It may well make us hesitate
 before we admit that man . . . is alone an exception. . . . This
 is more difficult to believe, as the ape family which man (?)
 so closely resembles . . . . contains numerous branches which
 graduate into one another, but the extremes of which differ more
 widely than man does from the highest of the ape series. If a
 special creation is required for man, <i>must there not have been
 special creations for the chimpanzee, the gorilla, the orang,
 </i>and for at least 100 different species of ape and monkeys
 which are all built on the same lines?" (p. 182, "Modern
 Science, etc.")
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 There <i>was </i>a "special creation" for man, and a
 "special creation" for the ape,<i> his </i>progeny;
 only on other lines than ever bargained for by Science. Albert
 Gaudry and others give some weighty reasons why man cannot be
 regarded as the crown of an ape-stock. When one finds that not
 only was the "primeval savage" (?) a reality in the
 Miocene times, but that, as de Mortillet shows, the flint relics
 he has left behind him were splintered <i>by</i> <i>fire </i>in
 that remote epoch; when we learn that the Dryopithecus, <i>alone
 of the anthropoids, </i>appears in those strata, what is the natural
 inference? That the Darwinians are in a quandary. The very manlike
 Gibbon is <i>still in the same low grade of development, as it
 was when it co-existed with Man at the close of the Glacial Period.
 </i>It has not appreciably altered since the Pliocene times. Now
 there is little to choose between the Dryopithecus and the existing
 anthropoids -- gibbon, gorilla, etc. If, then, the Darwinian theory
 is all-sufficient, how are we to "explain" the evolution
 of this

 <p>
 ape into Man during the first half of the Miocene? The time is
 far too short for such a theoretical transformation. The extreme
 slowness with which variation in species supervenes renders the
 thing inconceivable -- more especially on the Natural Selection
 hypothesis. The enormous mental and structural gulf between a
 savage acquainted with fire and the mode of kindling it, and a
 brutal anthropoid, is too much to bridge even in idea, during
 so contracted a period. Let the Evolutionists push back the process
 into the preceding <i>Eocene, </i>if they prefer to do so; let
 them even trace both Man and Dryopithecus to a common ancestor;
 the unpleasant consideration has, nevertheless, to be faced that
 in Eocene strata the anthropoid fossils are as conspicuous by
 their absence, as is the fabulous <i>pithecanthropus </i>of Haeckel.
 Is an exit out of this <i>cul de sac </i>to be found by an appeal
 to the "unknown," and a reference with Darwin to the
 "imperfection of the geological record"? So be it; but
 the same right of appeal must be accorded equally to the Occultists,
 instead of remaining the monopoly of puzzled materialism. Physical
 man, we say, existed before the first bed of the Cretaceous rocks
 was deposited. In the early part of the Tertiary Age, the most
 brilliant civilization the world has ever known flourished at
 a period when the Haeckelian <i>man-ape</i> is conceived to have
 roamed through the primeval forests, and Mr. Grant Allen's putative
 ancestor to have swung himself from bough to bough with his hairy
 mates, the degenerated Liliths of the Third Race Adam. Yet there
 were no anthropoid apes in the brighter days of the civilization
 of the Fourth Race; but Karma is a mysterious law, and no respecter
 of persons. The monsters bred in sin and shame by the Atlantean
 giants, "<i>blurred copies</i>"<i> </i>of their bestial
 sires, and hence of modern man (Huxley), now mislead and overwhelm
 with error the speculative Anthropologist of European Science.
 </p><p>
 Where did the first men live? Some Darwinists say in Western Africa,
 some in Southern Asia, others, again, believe in an independent
 origin of human stocks in Asia and America from a Simian ancestry
 (Vogt). Haeckel, however, advances gaily to the charge. Starting
 from his "prosimiae" . . . "the ancestor common
 to all other catarrhini, including man" -- a "link"
 now, however, disposed of for good by recent anatomical discoveries!
 -- he endeavours to find a habitat for the primeval Pithecanthropus
 alalus. "In all probability it (the transformation of animal
 into man) occurred in Southern Asia, in which region many evidences
 are forthcoming that here was the original home of the different
 species of men. Probably Southern Asia itself was not the earliest
 cradle of the human race, but <strong>L</strong>EMURIA, <i>a continent
 that lay to the south of Asia, and sank later on beneath the surface
 of the Indian Ocean. </i>(<i>Vide infra, </i>"Scientific
 and geological proofs of the former existence of several</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 680 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 submerged continents.") "The period during which the
 evolution of the anthropoid apes into apelike men took place was
 probably the last part of the tertiary period, the Pliocene Age,
 and perhaps the Miocene, its forerunner." (Pedigree of Man,
 p. 73.)
 </p><p>
 Of the above speculations, the only one of any worth is that referring
 to Lemuria, which <i>was </i>the cradle of mankind -- of the physical
 sexual creature who materialized through long aeons out of the
 ethereal hermaphrodites. Only, if it is proved that <i>Easter
 Island </i>is an actual relic of Lemuria, we must believe that
 according to Haeckel the "<i>dumb ape-men</i>," just
 removed from a brutal mammalian monster, built the gigantic portrait-statues,
 some of which are now in the British Museum. Critics are mistaken
 in terming Haeckelian doctrines "abominable, revolutionary,
 immoral" -- though materialism is the legitimate outcome
 of the ape-ancestor myth -- they are simply too absurd to demand
 disproof.

 </p><p>
 We are told that while every other heresy against modern science
 may be disregarded, this, our denial of the Darwinian theory as
 applied to Man, will be the one "unpardonable" sin.
 The Evolutionists stand firm as rock on the evidence of similarity
 of structure between the ape and the man. The anatomical evidence,
 it is urged, is quite overpowering in this case; it is <i>bone
 for bone,</i> and<i> muscle for muscle, </i>even the brain conformation
 being very much the same.
 </p><p>
 Well, what of that? All this was known before King Herod; and
 the writers of the <i>Ramayana, </i>the poets who sang the prowess
 and valour of Hanuman, the monkey-God, "whose feats were
 great and Wisdom never rivalled," must have known as much
 about his anatomy and brain as does any Haeckel or Huxley in our
 modern day. Volumes upon volumes were written upon this similarity,
 in antiquity as in more modern times. Therefore, there is nothing
 new whatever given to the world or to philosophy, in such volumes
 as Mivart's "Man and Apes," or Messrs. Fiske and Huxley's
 defence of Darwinism. But what are those <i>crucial </i>proofs
 of man's descent from a pithecoid ancestor? If the Darwinian theory
 <i>is not the true one -- </i>we are told -- if man and ape do
 not descend from a common ancestor, then we are called upon to
 explain the reason of: --
 </p><p>
 (I.) The similarity of structure between the two; the fact that
 the</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page 681]] HUXLEY CALLS THE DARWINISTS TO ORDER.
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 higher animal world -- man and beast -- is physically of one type
 or pattern.
 </p><p>
 (II.) The presence of <i>rudimentary organs </i>in man, <i>i.e.</i>,
 traces of former organs now atrophied by disuse. Some of these
 organs, it is asserted, could not have had any scope for employment,
 except for a semi-animal, semi-arboreal monster. Why, again, do
 we find in Man those "rudimentary" organs (as useless
 as its rudimentary wing is to the<i> Apteryx </i>of Australia),
 the vermiform appendix of the <i>coecum, </i>the ear muscles,*
 the "rudimentary tail" (with which children are still
 sometimes born), etc., etc.?
 </p><p>
 Such is the war cry; and the cackle of the smaller fry among the
 Darwinians is louder, if possible, than even that of the scientific
 Evolutionists themselves!
 </p><p>
 Furthermore, the latter themselves -- with their great leader
 Mr. Huxley, and such eminent zoologists as Mr. Romanes and others
 -- while defending the Darwinian theory, are the first to confess
 the almost insuperable difficulties in the way of its final demonstration.
 And there are as great men of science as the above-named, who
 deny, most emphatically, the uncalled-for assumption, and loudly
 denounce the unwarrantable exaggerations on the question of this
 supposed similarity. It is sufficient to glance at the works of
 Broca, Gratiolet, of Owen, Pruner-Bey, and finally, at the last
 great work of de Quatrefages, "<i>Introduction a l</i>'<i>Etude
 des Races humaines, Questions generales,</i>" to<i> </i>discover
 the fallacy of the Evolutionists. We may say more: the exaggerations
 concerning such similarity of structure between man and the anthropomorphous
 ape have become so glaring and absurd of late, that even Mr. Huxley
 found himself forced to protest against the too sanguine expectations.
 It was that great anatomist personally who called the "smaller
 fry" to order, by declaring in one of his articles that the
 differences in the structure of the human body and that of the
 highest anthropomorphous pithecoid, were not only <i>far from
 being trifling and unimportant, </i>but were, on the contrary,
 very great and suggestive: "each of the bones of the gorilla
 has its own specific impress on it that distinguishes it from
 a similar human bone." Among the existing creatures there
 is not one single intermediate form that could fill the gap between
 man and the ape. To ignore that gap, he added, "was <i>as
 uncalled-for as it was absurd.</i>"<i>**</i> 
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Professor Owen believes that these muscles -- the attollens,
 retrahens, and attrahens aurem -- were actively functioning in
 men of the Stone Age. This may or may not be the case. The question
 falls under the ordinary "occult" explanation, and involves
 no postulate of an "animal progenitor" to solve it.
 </p><p>
 ** Quoted in the Review of the "<i>Introduction a l</i>'<i>Etude
 des Races Humaines,</i>"<i> by de Quatrefages. </i>We have
 not Mr. Huxley's work at hand to quote from. Or to cite another
 good authority: -- "We find one of the most man-like apes
 (gibbon), in the [[Footnote continued on next page]]</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 682 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Finally, the absurdity of such an <i>unnatural </i>descent of
 man is so palpable in the face of all the proofs and evidence
 of the skull of the pithecoid as compared to that of man, that
 even de Quatrefages resorted unconsciously to our esoteric theory
 by saying <i>that it is rather the apes that can claim descent
 from man </i>than <i>vice versa. </i>As proven by Gratiolet, with
 regard to the cavities of the brain of the anthropoids, in which
 species that organ develops in an inverse ratio to what would
 be the case were the corresponding organs in man really the product
 of the development of the said organs in the apes -- the size
 of the human skull and its brain, as well as the cavities, increase
 with the individual development of man. His intellect develops
 and increases with age, while his facial bones and jaws diminish
 and straighten, thus being more and more spiritualized: whereas
 with the ape it is the reverse. In its youth the anthropoid is
 far more intelligent and good-natured, while with age it becomes
 duller; and, as its skull recedes and seems to diminish as it
 grows, its facial bones and jaws develop, the brain being finally
 crushed, and thrown entirely back, to make with every day more
 room for the animal type. The organ of thought -- the brain --
 recedes and diminishes, entirely conquered and replaced by that
 of the wild beast -- the jaw apparatus.
 </p><p>
 Thus, as wittily remarked in the French work, a gorilla would
 have a perfect right to address an Evolutionist, claiming its
 right of descent from himself. It would say to him, "We,
 anthropoid apes, form a retrogressive departure from the human
 type, and therefore our development and evolution are expressed
 by a transition from a human-like to an animal-like structure
 of organism; but in what way could <i>you, </i>men, descend from
 us -- how can you form a continuation of our genus? For, to make
 this possible, your organization would have to differ still more
 than ours does from the human structure, it would have to approach
 still closer to that of the beast than ours does; and in such
 a case justice demands that you should give up to us your place
 in nature. You are lower than we are, once that you insist on
 tracing your genealogy from our kind; for the structure of our
 organization and its development are such that we are unable to
 generate forms of a higher organization than our own."
 </p><p>
 This is where the Occult Sciences agree entirely with de Quatre-

 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] <i>tertiary period,
 </i>and this species is <i>still in the same low grade,</i> and<i>
 side by side </i>with it at the end of the Ice-period, man is
 found in the same high grade as to-day, the ape not having approximated
 more nearly to the man, and modern man not having become further
 removed from the ape than the first (fossil) man . . . these facts
 contradict a theory of constant progressive development."
 (Pfaff.) When, according to Vogt, the the average Australian brain
 = 99.35 cub. inches; that of the gorilla 30.51 cub. in., and that
 of the chimpanzee only 25.45, the <i>giant gap </i>to be bridged
 by the advocate of "Natural" Selection becomes apparent.

 <p>
 fages. Owing to the very type of his development man <i>cannot
 descend </i>from either an ape or an ancestor common to both,
 but shows his origin from a type far superior to himself. And
 this type is the "Heavenly man" -- the Dhyan Chohans,
 or the <i>Pitris </i>so-called, as shown in the first Part of
 this volume. On the other hand, the pithecoids, the orang-outang,
 the gorilla, and the chimpanzee <i>can</i>, and, as the Occult
 Sciences teach, <i>do, </i>descend from the animalized Fourth
 human Root-Race, being the product of man and an extinct species
 of mammal -- whose <i>remote </i>ancestors were themselves the
 product of Lemurian bestiality -- which lived in the Miocene age.
 The ancestry of this semi-human monster is explained in the Stanzas
 as originating in the sin of the "Mind-less" races of
 the middle Third Race period.
 </p><p>
 When it is borne in mind that all forms which now people the earth,
 are so many variations on <i>basic types </i>originally thrown
 off by the <b>M</b>AN of the Third and Fourth Round, such an evolutionist
 argument as that insisting on the "unity of structural plan"
 characterising all vertebrates, loses its edge. The basic types
 referred to were very few in number in comparison with the multitude
 of organisms to which they ultimately gave rise; but a general
 unity of type has, nevertheless, been preserved throughout the
 ages. The economy of Nature does not sanction the co-existence
 of several utterly opposed "ground plans" of organic
 evolution on one planet. Once, however, that the general drift
 of the occult explanation is formulated, inference as to detail
 may well be left to the intuitive reader.
 </p><p>
 Similarly with the important question of the "rudimentary"
 organs discovered by anatomists in the human organism. Doubtless
 this line of argument, when wielded by Darwin and Haeckel against
 their European adversaries, proved of great weight. Anthropologists,
 who ventured to dispute the derivation of man from an animal ancestry,
 were sorely puzzled how to deal with the presence of gill-clefts,
 with the "tail" problem, and so on. Here again Occultism
 comes to our assistance with the necessary data.
 </p><p>
 The fact is that, as previously stated, the human type is the
 repertory of all potential organic forms, and the central point
 from which these latter radiate. In this postulate we find a true
 "<i>Evolution</i>"<i> </i>or<i> </i>"<i>Unfolding</i>"<i>
 -- </i>a sense which cannot be said to belong to the mechanical
 theory of natural selection. Criticising Darwin's inference from
 "rudiments," an able writer remarks: "Why is it
 not just as probably a true hypothesis to suppose that Man was
 <i>created with the rudimentary sketches in his organization,
 and that they became useful appendages in the lower animals into
 which man degenerated, </i>as to suppose that these parts existed
 in full development in the lower animals out of which man was
 generated?" ("Creation or Evolution?" Geo. T. Curtis,
 p. 76.)</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 684 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Read for "into which Man degenerated," "the prototypes
 which man <i>shed </i>in the course of his astral developments,"
 and an aspect of the true esoteric solution is before us. But
 a wider generalization is now to be formulated.
 </p><p>
 So far as our present <i>Fourth Round </i>terrestrial period is
 concerned, the mammalian fauna are alone to be regarded as traceable
 to prototypes shed by Man. The amphibia, birds, reptiles, fishes,
 etc., are the resultants of the Third Round, astral fossil forms
 stored up in the auric envelope of the Earth and projected into
 physical objectivity subsequent to the deposition of the first
 Laurentian rocks. "Evolution" has to deal with the progressive
 modifications, which palaeontology shows to have affected the
 lower animal and vegetable kingdoms in the course of geological
 time. It does not, and from the nature of things cannot, touch
 on the subject of the pre-physical types which served as the basis
 for future differentiation. Tabulate the general laws controlling
 the development of physical organisms it certainly may, and to
 a certain extent it has acquitted itself ably of the task.
 </p><p>
 To return to the immediate subject of discussion. The mammalia,
 whose first traces are discovered in the marsupials of the Triassic
 rocks of the Secondary Period, were evolved from <i>purely</i>
 astral progenitors contemporary with the Second Race. They are
 thus <i>post-Human, </i>and, consequently, it is easy to account
 for the general resemblance between their embryonic stages and
 those of Man, who necessarily embraces in himself and epitomizes
 in his development the features of the group he originated. This
 explanation disposes of a portion of the Darwinist brief. "But
 how to account for the presence of the gill-clefts in the human
 foetus, which represent the stage through which the branchiae
 of the fish are developed;* for the pulsating vessel corresponding
 to the heart of the lower fishes, which constitutes the foetal
 heart; for the entire analogy presented by the segmentation of
 the human ovum, the formation of the blastoderm, and the appearance
 of the 'gastrula' stage, with corresponding stages in lower vertebrate
 life and even among the sponges; for the various types of lower
 animal life which the form of the future child shadows forth in
 the cycle of its growth?" "How comes it to pass that
 stages in the life of fishes, whose ancestors swam" -- aeons
 before the epoch of the First Root-Race,

 <p>
 * "At this period," writes Darwin, "the arteries
 run in arch-like branches, as if to carry the blood to branchiae
 which are not present in the higher vertebrata, though the slits
 on the side of the neck still remain, marking their former (?)
 position."
 </p><p>
 It is noteworthy that, though gill-clefts are absolutely useless
 to all but amphibia and fishes, etc., their appearance is regularly
 noted in the foetal development of vertebrates. Even children
 are occasionally born with an opening in the neck corresponding
 to one of the clefts.</p><hr>

 -- "in the seas of the Silurian period, as well as stages
 in that of the later amphibian, reptilian fauna, are mirrored
 in the 'epitomized history' of human foetal development?"
 </p><p>
 This plausible objection is met by the reply that the <i>Third
 Round </i>terrestrial animal forms were just as much referable
 to types thrown off by Third Round man, as that new importation
 into our planet's area -- the mammalian stock -- is to the Fourth
 Round Humanity of the Second Root-race. The process of human foetal
 growth epitomizes not only the general characteristics of the
 Fourth, but of the Third Round terrestrial life. The diapason
 of type is run through in brief. Occultists are thus at no loss
 to "account for" the birth of children with an actual
 caudal appendage, or for the fact that the tail in the human foetus
 is, at one period, double the length of the nascent legs. The
 potentiality of every organ useful to animal life is locked up
 in Man -- the microcosm of the Macrocosm -- and abnormal conditions
 may not unfrequently result in the strange phenomena which Darwinists
 regard as "reversion to ancestral features."* Reversion,
 indeed, but scarcely in the sense contemplated by our present-day
 empiricists!

 The public has been notified by more than one eminent modern geologist
 and man of science, that "all estimate of geological duration
 is not merely <i>impossible, </i>but necessarily imperfect; for
 we are ignorant of the causes, though they must have existed,
 which quickened or retarded the progress of the sedimentary deposits."**
 And now another man of Science, as well known (Croll), calculating
 that the tertiary age began either 15 or 2 1/2 million of years
 ago -- the former being a more correct calculation, according
 to Esoteric doctrine, than the latter there -- seems in this case,
 at least, no very great disagreement. Exact Science, refusing
 to see in man "a special creation" (to a certain degree
 the Secret Sciences do the same), is at liberty to ignore the
 first three, or rather two-and-a-half Races -- <i>the Spiritual,
 the semi-astral, and the</i>

 </i>(Lefevre) represented in foetal growth, does not appear in
 his 22 stages through which the monera have passed in their ascent
 to Man. Haeckel does <i>not</i> postulate a <i>vegetable </i>ancestor.

 <i>semi-human -</i>- of our teachings. But it can hardly do the
 same in the case of the Third at its closing period, the Fourth,
 and the Fifth Races, since it already divides mankind into Palaeolithic
 and Neolithic man.* The geologists of France place man in the
 mid-miocene age (Gabriel de Mortillet), and some even in the <i>Secondary
 </i>period, as de Quatrefages suggests; while the English <i>savants
 </i>do not generally accept such antiquity for their species.
 But they may know better some day. For "If we consider,"
 says Sir Charles Lyell in "Antiquity of Man," p. 246
 --
 </p><blockquote>
 "the absence or extreme scarcity of human bones and works
 of art in all strata, whether marine or fresh water, even in those
 formed in the immediate proximity of land inhabited by millions
 of human beings, we shall be prepared for the general dearth of
 human memorials in glacial formations, whether recent, Pleistocene,
 or of more ancient date. If there were a few wanderers over lands
 covered with glaciers, or over seas infested with icebergs, and
 if a few of them left their bones or weapons in moraines or in
 marine drifts, the chances, after the lapse of thousands of years,
 of a geologist meeting with one of them must be infinitesimally
 small."
 </blockquote>

 The men of Science avoid pinning themselves down to any definite
 statement concerning the age of man, as indeed they hardly could,
 and thus leave enormous latitude to bolder speculations. Nevertheless,
 while the majority of the Anthropologists carry back the existence
 of man <i>only </i>into the period of the <i>post</i>-glacial
 drift, or what is called the Quaternary period, those of them
 who, as <i>Evolutionists, trace man to a common origin with that
 of the monkey, </i>do not show great consistency in their speculations.
 The Darwinian hypothesis demands, in reality, a far greater antiquity
 for man, than is even dimly suspected by superficial thinkers.
 This is proven by the greatest authorities on the question --
 Mr. Huxley, for instance. Those, therefore, who accept the Darwinian
 evolution, <i>ipso facto </i>hold very tenaciously to an antiquity
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * We confess to not being able to see any good reasons for Mr.
 E. Clodd's certain statement in <i>Knowledge. </i>Speaking of
 the men of Neolithic times, "concerning whom Mr. Grant Allen
 has given . . . a vivid and accurate sketch," and who are
 "the direct ancestors of peoples of whom remnants yet lurk
 in out-of-the-way corners of Europe, where they have been squeezed
 or stranded," he adds to this: "but the men of Palaeolithic
 times can be identified with no existing races; they were savages
 of a more degraded type than any extant; tall, yet barely erect,
 with short legs and twisted knees, with prognathous, that is,
 projecting ape-like jaws, and small brains. Whence they come we
 cannot tell, and their 'grave knoweth no man to this day.' "
 </p><p>
 Besides the possibility that there may be men who <i>know</i>
 whence they came and how they perished -- it is not true to say
 that the Palaeolithic men, or their fossils, are all found with
 "small brains." The oldest skull of all those hitherto
 found, the "Neanderthal skull," is of average capacity,
 and Mr. Huxley was compelled to confess that it was no real approximation
 whatever to that of the "missing link." There are aboriginal
 tribes in India whose brains are far smaller and nearer to that
 of the ape than any hitherto found among the skulls of Palaeolithic
 man.</p><hr>

 <p>
 of man so very great, indeed, that it falls not so far short of
 the Occultist's estimate.* The modest thousands of years of the
 <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica </i>and the 100,000 years, to which
 Anthropology in general limits the age of Humanity, seem quite
 microscopical when compared with the figures implied in Mr. Huxley's
 bold speculations. The former, indeed, makes of the original race
 of men ape-like cave-dwellers. The great English biologist, in
 his desire to prove man's pithecoid origin, insists that the transformation
 of the primordial ape into a human being must have occurred <i>millions
 of years back. </i>For in criticising the excellent average cranial
 capacity of the Neanderthal skull, notwithstanding his assertion
 that it is overlaid with "pithecoid bony walls," coupled
 with Mr. Grant Allen's assurances that this skull "possesses
 large bosses on the forehead, strikingly (?) suggestive of those
 which give the gorilla its peculiarly fierce appearance,"**
 (<i>Fortnightly Review, </i>1882,) still Mr. Huxley is forced
 to admit that, in the said skull, his theory is once more defeated
 by the "completely human proportions of the accompanying
 limb-bones, together with the fair development of the Engis skull."
 In consequence of all this we are notified that those skulls,
 "clearly indicate that the first traces of the primordial
 stock whence man has proceeded, need no longer be sought by those
 who entertain any form of the doctrine of progressive development
 in the newest Tertiaries; but that they <i>may be looked for in
 an epoch more distant from the age of the </i>ELEPHAS PRIMIGENIUS
 <i>than that is from us</i>"<i>*** </i>(Huxley).
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * The <i>actual</i> time required for such a theoretical transformation
 is necessarily enormous. "If," says Professor Pfaff,
 "in the hundreds of thousands of years which you (the Evolutionists)
 accept between the rise of palaeolithic man and our own day, a
 greater distance of man from the brute is not demonstrable, (<i>the
 most ancient man was just as far removed from the brute as the
 now living man</i>), what reasonable ground can be advanced for
 believing that man has been developed from the brute, and has
 receded further from it by infinitely small gradations."
 . . . . "<i>The longer the interval of time placed between
 our times and the so-called palaeolithic men, the more ominous
 and destructive for the theory of the gradual development of man
 from the animal kingdom is the result stated.</i>"<i> </i>Huxley
 states ("Man's Place in Nature," p. 159) that the <i>most
 liberal</i> estimates for the antiquity of Man <i>must be still
 further </i>extended.
 </p><p>
 ** The baselessness of this assertion, as well as that of many
 other exaggerations of the imaginative Mr. Grant Allen, was ably
 exposed by the eminent anatomist, Professor R. Owen, in "Longman's
 Magazine," No. 1. Must it be repeated, moreover, that the
 Cro-Magnon Palaeolithic type is superior to a very large number
 of existing races?
 </p><p>
 *** It thus stands to reason that science would never dream of
 a <i>pre</i>-tertiary man, and that de Quatrefages' <i>secondary</i>
 man makes every Academician and "<strong>F.R.S</strong>."
 faint with horror because, TO PRESERVE THE APE-THEORY, SCIENCE
 MUST MAKE MAN POST-SECONDARY. This is just what de Quatrefages
 has twitted the Darwinists with, adding, that on the whole there
 were more scientific reasons to trace the ape from man than man
 from the anthropoid. With this exception science has not one single
 valid argu- [[Footnote continued on next page]]</p><hr>

 <p>
 An <i>untold </i>antiquity for man is thus, then, the scientific
 <i>sine qua non </i>in the question of Darwinian Evolution, since
 the oldest Palaeolithic man shows as yet no appreciable differentiation
 from his modern descendant. It is only of late that modern Science
 began to widen with every year the abyss that now separates her
 from old Science, that of the Plinies and Hippocrateses, none
 of whom would have derided the archaic teachings with respect
 to the evolution of the human races and animal species, as the
 present day Scientist -- geologist or anthropologist -- is sure
 to do.

 Round product, the following diagram -- as the writer understands
 the teaching -- may make the process clear: --

 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] ment to offer against
 the antiquity of man. But in this case modern Evolution demands
 far more than the fifteen million years of Croll for the Tertiary
 period, for two very simple but good reasons: (<i>a</i>) No anthropoid
 ape has been found before the Miocene period: (<i>b</i>) man's
 flint relics have been traced to the Pliocene and their presence
 <i>suspected, </i>if not accepted by all, in the Miocene strata.
 Again, where is the "missing link" in such case? And
 how could even a Palaeolithic Savage, a "Man of Canstadt,"
 evolve into <i>thinking</i> men from the brute Dryopithecus of
 the Miocene <i>in</i> <i>so short a time. </i>One sees now the
 reason why Darwin rejected the theory that only 60,000,000 years
 had elapsed since the Cambrian period. "He judges from the
 small amount of organic changes since the glacial epoch, and adds
 that the previous 140 million years can hardly be considered as
 sufficient for the development of the varied forms of life which
 certainly existed toward the close of the Cambrian period."
 (Ch. Gould.)

 * Let us remember in this connection the esoteric teaching which
 tells us of Man having had in the Third Round a GIGANTIC APE-LIKE
 FORM on the astral plane. And similarly at the close of the Third
 Race in this Round. Thus it accounts for the <i>human</i> features
 of the apes, especially of the later anthropoids -- apart from
 the fact that these latter preserve by <i>Heredity </i>a resemblance
 to their Atlanto-Lemurian sires.</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 689 THE INCUBUS OF ETHNOLOGY.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Man -- to develop the necessary barrier. Medical science records
 such cases of monsters, bred from human and animal parents, even
 in our own day. The possibility is, therefore, only one of <i>degree,
 </i>not of fact. Thus it is that Occultism solves one of the strangest
 problems presented to the consideration of the anthropologist.
 </p><p>
 The pendulum of thought oscillates between extremes. Having now
 finally emancipated herself from the shackles of theology, Science
 has embraced the opposite fallacy; and in the attempt to interpret
 Nature on purely materialistic lines, she has built up that most
 extravagant theory of the ages -- the derivation of man from a
 ferocious and brutal ape. So rooted has this doctrine, in one
 form or another, now become, that the most Herculean efforts will
 be needed to bring about its final rejection. The Darwinian anthropology
 is the incubus of the ethnologist, a sturdy child of modem Materialism,
 which has grown up and acquired increasing vigour, as the ineptitude
 of the theological legend of Man's "creation" became
 more and more apparent. It has thriven on account of the strange
 delusion that -- as a scientist of repute puts it -- "All
 hypotheses and theories with respect to the rise of man can be
 reduced to <i>two </i>(the Evolutionist and the Biblical exoteric
 account) . . . There is no other hypothesis conceivable . . .
 " !! The anthropology of the secret volumes is, however,
 the best possible answer to such a worthless contention.
 </p><p>
 The anatomical resemblance between Man and the higher Ape, so
 frequently cited by Darwinists as pointing to some former ancestor
 common to both, presents an interesting problem, the proper solution
 of which is to be sought for in the esoteric explanation of the
 genesis of the pithecoid stocks. We have given it as far as was
 useful, by stating that the bestiality of the primeval mindless
 races resulted in the production of huge man-like monsters --
 the offspring of human and animal parents. As time rolled on,
 and the still semi-astral forms consolidated into the physical,
 the descendants of these creatures were modified by external conditions,
 until the breed, dwindling in size, culminated in the lower apes
 of the Miocene period. With these the later Atlanteans renewed
 the sin of the "Mindless" -- this time with full responsibility.
 The resultants of their crime were the species of apes now known
 as Anthropoid.
 </p><p>
 It may be useful to compare this very simple theory -- and we
 are willing to offer it even as a hypothesis to the unbelievers
 -- with the Darwinian scheme, so full of insurmountable obstacles,
 that no sooner is one of these overcome by a more or less ingenious
 hypothesis, than ten worse difficulties are forthwith discovered
 behind the one disposed of.
