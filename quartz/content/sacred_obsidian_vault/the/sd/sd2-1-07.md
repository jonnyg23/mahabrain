 (<em>a</em>) The text of the Stanza clearly implies that the human
 embryo was nourished <em>ab extra </em>by Cosmic forces, and that
 the "Father-Mother" furnished apparently the germ that
 ripened: in all probability a "sweat-born egg," to be
 hatched out, in some mysterious way, disconnected from the "double"
 parent. It is comparatively easy to conceive of an oviparous humanity,
 since even now man is, in one sense, "egg-born." Magendie,
 moreover, in his <em>Precis Elementaire de Physiologie, </em>citing<em>
 </em>"a case where the umbilical cord was ruptured and perfectly
 cicatrized," yet the infant was born alive, pertinently asks,
 "How was the circulation carried on in this organ?"
 On the next page he says: "Nothing is at present known respecting
 the use of digestion in the foetus;" and respecting its nutrition,
 propounds this query: "What, then, can we say of the nutrition
 of the foetus? Physiological works contain only <em>vague conjectures
 </em>on this point." "Ah, but," the sceptic may
 urge, "Magendie's book belongs to the last generation, and
 Science has since made such strides that his stigma of ignorance
 can no longer be fixed upon the profession." Indeed; then
 let us turn to a very great authority upon Physiology, viz., Sir
 M. Foster (<em>Text-Book of Physiology, </em>third edition, 1879,
 p. 623); and to the disadvantage of modern Science we shall find
 him saying, "Concerning the rise and development of the functional
 activities of the embryo, our knowledge is almost a blank. We
 know scarcely anything about the various steps by which the primary
 fundamental qualities of the protoplasm of the ovum are differentiated
 into the complex phenomena which we have attempted in</p><hr>

 <p>
 this book to explain." The students of Trin. Coll. Cantab.
 will now kindly draw a veil before the statue of Hygeia and bandage
 the eyes of the busts of Galen and Hippocrates, lest they look
 reproachfully at their degenerate descendants. One further fact
 we must note. Sir M. Foster is discreetly silent about the case
 of the ruptured umbilical cord cited by his great French <em>confrere.</em>
 
 </p><p>
 This is a very curious statement as explained in the Commentaries.
 To make it clear: The First Race having created the Second by
 "budding," as just explained, the Second Race gives
 birth to the Third -- which itself is separated into three distinct
 divisions, consisting of men differently procreated. The first
 two of these are produced by an oviparous method, presumably unknown
 to modern Natural History. While the early sub-races of the Third
 Humanity procreated their species by a kind of exudation of moisture
 or vital fluid, the drops of which coalescing formed an oviform
 ball -- or shall we say egg? -- which served as an extraneous
 vehicle for the generation therein of a <em>foetus </em>and child,
 the mode of procreation by the later races changed, in its results
 at all events. The little ones of the earlier races were entirely
 sexless -- shapeless even for all one knows*; but those of the
 later races were born androgynous. It is in the Third Race that
 the separation of sexes occurred. From being previously a-sexual,
 Humanity became distinctly hermaphrodite or bi-sexual; and finally
 the man-bearing eggs began to give birth, gradually and almost
 imperceptibly in their evolutionary development, first, to Beings
 in which one sex predominated over the other, and, finally, to
 distinct men and women. And now let us search for corroboration
 of these statements in the religious legends of East and West.
 Let us take the "Egg-born Race" first. Think of Kasyapa,
 the Vedic sage, and the most prolific of creators. He was the
 son of Marichi, Brahma's mind-born son; and he is made to become
 the father of the <em>Nagas, </em>or Serpents, among other beings.
 Exoterically, the <em>Nagas </em>are semi-divine beings which
 have a human face and the tail of a serpent. Yet there was a race
 of <em>Nagas, </em>said to be a thousand in number only, born
 or rather sprung from Kadra, Kasyapa's wife, for <em>the purpose
 of peopling Patala, </em>which is undeniably America, as will
 be shown; and there was a NAGA-Dwipa, one of the seven divisions
 of Bharata-Varsha, India, inhabited by a people bearing the same
 name, who are allowed, even by some Orientalists, to be <em>historical,
 </em>and to have left many a trace behind them to this day.
 </p><p>
 Now the point most insisted upon at present is that, whatever
 origin be claimed for man, his evolution took place in this order:
 (1) Sexless, as all the earlier forms are; (2) then, by a natural
 transition, he became,
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * See the "Timaeus."</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 133 BI-SEXUAL REPRODUCTION.</h6>
 
 <p>
 "a solitary hermaphrodite," a bi-sexual being; and (3)
 finally separated and became what he is now. Science teaches us
 that all the primitive forms, though sexless, "still retained
 the power of undergoing the processes of A-Sexual multiplication;"
 why, then, should man be excluded from that law of Nature? Bi-sexual
 reproduction is an evolution, a specialized and perfected form
 on the scale of matter of the fissiparous act of reproduction.
 Occult teachings are pre-eminently panspermic, and the early history
 of humanity is hidden only "from ordinary mortals;"
 nor is the history of the primitive Races buried from the Initiates
 in the tomb of time, as it is for profane science. Therefore,
 supported on the one hand by that science which shows to us progressive
 development and an internal cause for every external modification,
 as a law in Nature; and, on the other hand, by an implicit faith
 in the wisdom -- we may say pansophia even -- of the universal
 traditions gathered and preserved by the Initiates, who have perfected
 them into an almost faultless system -- thus supported, we venture
 to state the doctrine clearly.
 </p><p>
 In an able article, written some fifteen years ago, our learned
 and respected friend Prof. Alex. Wilder, of New York, shows the
 absolute logic and necessity of believing "The Primeval Race
 Double-Sexed," and gives a number of scientific reasons for
 it.* He argues firstly, "that a large part of the vegetable
 creation exhibits the phenomenon of bisexuality . . . the Linnaean
 classification enumerating thus almost all plants. This is the
 case in the superior families of the vegetable kingdoms as much
 as in the lower forms, from the Hemp to the Lombardy Poplar and
 Ailanthus. In the animal kingdom, in insect life, the moth generates
 a worm, as in the <em>Mysteries </em>the great secret was expressed:
 "<em>Taurus Draconem genuit, et Taurum Draco.</em>"<em>
 </em>The<em> </em>coral-producing family, which, according to
 Agassiz, 'has spent many hundreds of thousands of years, during
 the present geological period, in building out the peninsula of
 Florida . . . . produce their offspring from themselves like the
 buds and ramifications in a tree.' Bees are somewhat in the same
 line . . . . The Aphides or plant lice keep house like Amazons,
 and <em>virgin parents </em>perpetuate the Race for ten successive
 generations."
 </p><p>
 What say the old sages, the philosopher-teachers of antiquity.
 Aristophanes speaks thus on the subject in Plato's "<em>Banquet</em>":<em>
 </em>"Our<em> </em>nature of old was not the same as it is
 now. It was <em>androgynous, </em>the<em> </em>form and name partaking
 of, and being common to both the male and female. . . . Their
 bodies were round, and the manner of their running

 <p>
 circular.* They were terrible in force and strength and had prodigious
 ambition. Hence Zeus <em>divided each of them into two, </em>making
 them weaker; Apollo, under his direction, closed up the skin."
 </p><p>
 Meshia and Meshiane were but a single individual with the old
 Persians. "They also taught that man was the product of the
 tree of life, growing in androgynous pairs, till they were separated
 at a subsequent modification of the human form.**"
 </p><p>
 In the <em>Toleduth </em>(generation) of Adam, the verse "God
 created (<em>bara, </em>brought forth) man in his image, in the
 image of God created he him, male and female created he them,"
 if read esoterically will yield the true sense, viz.: "The
 <em>Elohim </em>(Gods) brought forth from themselves (by modification)
 man in their image . . . . created they <em>him </em>(collective
 humanity, or <em>Adam</em>),<em> </em>male and female created
 <em>he</em> (collective deity) them."*** This will show the
 esoteric point. The <em>sexless </em>Race was their first production,
 a modification <em>of </em>and<em> from </em>themselves, the pure
 spiritual existences; and this was Adam <em>solus. </em>Thence
 came the <em>second </em>Race: Adam-Eve or <em>Jod-Heva, </em>inactive
 androgynes; and finally the <em>Third, </em>or the "<em>Separating
 </em>Hermaphrodite," Cain and Abel, who produce the Fourth,
 Seth-Enos, etc. It is that Third, the last semi-spiritual <em>race</em>,
 which was also the last vehicle of the divine and innate Wisdom,
 ingenerate in the Enochs, the Seers of that Mankind. The <em>Fourth,
 </em>which had tasted from the fruit of the Tree of Good and Evil
 -- Wisdom united already to earthy, and therefore <em>impure,
 </em>intelligence **** had consequently to acquire that Wisdom
 by initiation and great struggle. And the union of Wisdom and
 Intelligence, the former <em>ruling </em>the latter, is called
 in the Hermetic books "the God possessing the double fecundity
 of the two sexes." Mystically Jesus was held to be man-woman.

 * Compare Ezekiel's vision (chap. i) of the four divine beings
 who "had the likeness of a man" and yet had the appearance

 </p><p>
 ** See Prof. Wilder's Essay "<em>The Primeval Race Double-Sexed.</em>"
 </p><p>
 *** Eugibinus, a Christian, and the Rabbis Samuel, Manasseh ben
 Israel, and Maimonides taught that "Adam had <em>two</em>
 faces and <em>one</em> person, and from the beginning he was both
 male and female -- male on one side and female on the other (like
 Manu's Brahma), but afterwards the parts were separated."
 The one hundred and thirty-ninth Psalm of David recited by Rabbi
 Jeremiah ben Eliazar is evidence of this. "Thou hast <em>fashioned
 </em>me behind and before," not <em>beset </em>as in the
 Bible, which is absurd and meaningless, and this shows, as Prof.
 Wilder thinks, "that the primeval form of mankind was androgynous."

 Wisdom; and ye <em>fools, be of an understanding heart.</em>"<em>
 </em>It is <em>spirit </em>and <em>matter</em>, the<em> nous </em>and
 the <em>psyche; </em>of the latter of which St. James says that
 it is "earthly, sensual, and devilish."</p><hr>

 "Zeus is a male, Zeus is an immortal maid." The Egyptian
 Ammon was the goddess Neith, in his other half. Jupiter has female
 breasts, Venus is bearded in some of her statues, and Ila, the
 goddess, is also Su-Dyumna, the god, as Vaivasvata's progeny.
 </p><p>
 "The name <em>Adam,</em>" says Professor A. Wilder,
 "or man, itself implies this double form of existence. It
 is identical with <em>Athamas, </em>or<em> Thomas </em>(Tamil
 <em>Tam</em>), which is rendered by the Greek <em>Didumos, </em>a
 twin; if, therefore, the first woman was formed subsequently to
 the first man, she must, as a logical necessity, be 'taken out
 of man' . . . and the <em>side </em>which the <em>Elohim </em>had
 taken from man, 'made he a woman' (<em>Gen. ii.</em>).<em> </em>The
 Hebrew word here used is <em>Tzala, </em>which bears the translation
 we have given. It is easy to trace the legend in Berosus, who
 says that <em>Thalatth </em>(the<em> Omoroca, </em>or Lady of
 Urka) was the beginning of creation. She was also Melita, the
 queen of the Moon. . . . The two twin births of<em> Genesis, </em>that
 of Cain and Abel, and of Esau and Jacob, shadow the same idea.
 <em>The name 'Hebel' is the same as Eve, </em>and its characteristic
 seems to be feminine," continues the author. "Unto thee
 shall be his desire," said the Lord God to Cain, "and
 thou shalt rule over him." The same language had been uttered
 to Eve: "Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall
 rule over thee." . . .
 </p><p>
 Thus the pristine bi-sexual unity of the human <em>Third </em>Root-Race
 is an axiom in the Secret Doctrine. Its virgin individuals were
 raised to "Gods," because that Race represented their
 "divine Dynasty." The moderns are satisfied with worshipping
 the male heroes of the Fourth Race, who created gods after their
 own sexual image, whereas the gods of primeval mankind were "male
 and female."
 </p><p>
 As stated in Book I, the humanities developed coordinately, and
 on parallel lines with the four Elements, every new Race being
 physiologically adapted to meet the additional element. Our Fifth
 Race is rapidly approaching the Fifth Element -- call it interstellar
 ether, if you will -- which has more to do, however, with psychology
 than with physics. We men have learned to live in every climate,
 whether frigid or tropical, but the first two Races had nought
 to do with climate, nor were they subservient to any temperature
 or change therein. And thus, we are taught, men lived down to
 the close of the Third Root-Race, when eternal spring reigned
 over the whole globe, such as is now enjoyed by the inhabitants
 of Jupiter; a "world," says M. Flammarion, "which
 is not subject like our own to the vicissitudes of seasons nor
 to abrupt alternations of temperature, but which is enriched with
 all the treasures of eternal spring." (<em>"Pluralite
 des Mondes,</em>"<em> </em>p. 69.) Those astronomers who
 maintain that Jupiter is in a molten condition, in our sense of
 the term, are invited to settle their dispute with this learned

 Astronomer.* It must, however, be always borne in mind that the
 "eternal spring" referred to is only a condition <em>cognised
 as such by the Jovians. </em>It is not "spring" <em>as
 we know it. </em>In this reservation is to be found the reconciliation
 between the two theories here cited. Both embrace <em>partial</em>
 truths.
 </p><p>
 It is thus a universal tradition that mankind has evolved gradually
 into its present shape from an almost transparent condition of
 texture, and neither by miracle nor by sexual intercourse. Moreover,
 this is in full accord with the ancient philosophies; from those
 of Egypt and India with their Divine Dynasties down to that of
 Plato. And all these universal beliefs must be classed with the
 "presentiments" and "obstinate conceptions,"
 some of them ineradicable, in popular faiths. Such beliefs, as
 remarked by Louis Figuier, are "frequently the outcome of
 the wisdom and observation of an infinite number of generations
 of men." For, "<em>a tradition which has an uniform
 and universal existence,</em> 
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * An hypothesis evolved in 1881 by Mr. Mattieu Williams seems
 to have impressed Astronomers but little. Says the author of "<em>The
 Fuel of the Sun</em>," in <em>Knowledge, </em>Dec. 23, 1881:
 "Applying now the researches of Dr. Andrews to the conditions
 of Solar existence . . . I conclude that the Sun has <em>no nucleus,
 </em>either solid, liquid, or gaseous, but is composed of dissociated
 matter in the critical state, surrounded, first, by a flaming
 envelope, due to the recombination of the dissociated matter,
 and outside of this, by another envelope of vapours due to this
 combination."
 </p><p>
 This is a novel theory to be added to other hypotheses, <em>all
 scientific and orthodox. </em>The meaning of the "<em>critical
 </em>state" is explained by Mr. M. Williams in the same journal
 (Dec. 9, 1881), in an article on "Solids, Liquids, and Gases."
 Speaking of an experiment by Dr. Andrews on carbonic acid, the
 scientist says that "when 88 [[degrees]] is reached, the
 boundary between liquid and gas vanished; <em>liquid and gas have
 blended into one mysterious intermediate fluid; an indefinite
 fluctuating something is there filling the whole of the tube --
 an etherealised liquid or a visible gas. </em>Hold a red-hot poker
 between your eye and the light; you will see an upflowing wave
 of movement of what appears like liquid air. The appearance of
 the <em>hybrid</em> fluid in the tube resembles this, but is sensibly
 denser, and evidently stands between the liquid and gaseous states
 of matter, as pitch or treacle stands between solid and liquid."
 </p><p>
 The<em> temperature at which this occurs has been named by Dr.
 Andrews the </em>"<em>critical temperature</em>"; here
 the gaseous and the liquid states are "<em>continuous,</em>"
 and it is probable that <em>all other substances capable of existing
 </em>in both states have their own particular critical temperatures.
 </p><p>
 Speculating further upon this "critical" state, Mr.
 Mattieu Williams emits some quite <em>occult</em> theories about
 Jupiter and other planets. He says: "<em>Our</em> <em>notions
 of solids, liquids, and gases are derived from our experiences
 of the state of matter here upon this Earth. Could we be removed
 to another planet, they would be curiously changed. </em>On Mercury
 water would rank as one of the condensible gases; on Mars, as
 a fusible solid; but what on Jupiter?"
 </p><p>
 "Recent observations justify us in regarding this as a miniature
 sun, with an external envelope of cloudy matter, apparently of
 partially-condensed water, but red-hot, or probably still hotter
 within. His vaporous atmosphere is evidently of enormous depth,
 and the force of gravitation being on his visible outer surface
 two-and-a-half [[Footnote continued on next page]] </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 137 EGYPTIAN BELIEF.</h6>
 
 <p>
 <em>has all the weight of scientific testimony.</em>"<em>*
 </em>And there is more than one such tradition in the Puranic
 allegories, as has been shown. Moreover, the doctrine that the
 first Race of mankind was formed out of the <em>chhayas </em>(astral
 images) of the Pitris, is fully corroborated in the <em>Zohar.
 </em>"In the <em>Tzalam </em>(shadow image) of Elohim (the
 Pitris), was made Adam (man). (Cremona, Ed. iii., 76<em>a</em>;
 Brody, Ed. iii., 159<em>a</em>; "Qabbalah," Isaac Myer,
 p. 420.)
 </p><p>
 It has been repeatedly urged as an objection that, however high
 the degree of metaphysical thought in ancient India, yet the old
 Egyptians had nothing but crass idolatry and zoolatry to boast
 of; Hermes, as alleged, being the work of mystic Greeks who lived
 in Egypt. To this, one answer can be given -- a direct proof that
 the Egyptians believed in the Secret Doctrine is, that it was
 taught to them at Initiation. Let the objectors open the "<em>Eclogae
 Physicae et Ethicae</em>" of <em>Stobaeus, </em>the<em> </em>Greek
 compiler of ancient fragments, who lived in the fifth century,
 <b>A.D</b>. The following is a transcription by him of an old
 Hermetic fragment, showing the Egyptian theory of the Soul. Translated
 word for word, it says: --
 </p><p>
 "From one Soul, that of ALL<strong>, </strong>spring all
 the Souls, which spread themselves as if purposely distributed
 through the world. These souls undergo many transformations; those
 which are already creeping creatures turn into aquatic animals;
 from these aquatic animals are derived land animals; and from
 the latter the birds. From the beings who live aloft in the air
 (heaven) men are born. On reaching that
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 [[Footnote continued from previous page]] times greater than that
 on our Earth's surface, the atmospheric pressure, in descending
 below this visible surface, must soon reach that at which the
 vapour of water would be brought to its critical condition. Therefore
 we may infer that <em>the oceans of Jupiter are neither of frozen,
 liquid, nor gaseous water, but are oceans or atmospheres of critical
 water. If any fish or birds swim or fly therein, they must be
 very critically organized.</em>"
 </p><p>
 As the whole mass of Jupiter is 300 times greater than that of
 the Earth, and its compressing energy towards the centre proportional
 to this, its materials, if similar to those of the Earth, and
 no hotter, would be considerably more dense, and the whole planet
 would have a higher specific gravity; but we know by the movement
 of its satellites that, instead of this, its specific gravity
 is less than a fourth of that of the Earth. This justifies the
 conclusion that it is intensely hot; for even hydrogen, if cold,
 would become denser than Jupiter under such pressure.
 </p><p>
 "As all elementary substances may exist as solids, liquids,
 or gases, or, critically, according to the conditions of temperature
 and pressure, I am justified in hypothetically concluding that
 <em>Jupiter is neither a solid, a liquid, nor a gaseous planet,
 but a critical planet, or an orb composed internally of associated
 elements in the critical state, and surrounded by a dense atmosphere
 of their vapours </em>and those of some of their compounds such
 as water. The same reasoning applies to Saturn and other large
 and rarified planets."
 </p><p>
 It is gratifying to see how <em>scientific imagination </em>approaches
 every year more closely to the borderland of our occult teachings.

 </p><p>
 (<em>a</em>) This verse cannot be understood without the help
 of the Commentaries. It means that the First Root-Race, the "Shadows"
 of the Progenitors, could not be injured, or destroyed by death.
 Being so ethereal and so little human in constitution, they could
 not be affected by any element -- flood or fire. But their "Sons,"
 the Second Root-Race, could be and were so destroyed. As the "progenitors"
 merged wholly in their own astral bodies, which were their progeny;
 so that progeny was absorbed in its descendants, the "Sweat-born."
 These were the second Humanity -- composed of the most heterogeneous
 gigantic semi-human monsters -- the first attempts of material
 nature at building human bodies. The ever-blooming lands of the
 Second Continent (Greenland, among others) were transformed, in
 order, from Edens with their eternal spring, into hyperborean
 Hades. This transformation was due to the displacement of the
 great waters of the globe, to oceans changing their beds; and
 the bulk of the Second Race perished in this first great throe
 of the evolution and consolidation of the globe during the human
 period. Of such great cataclysms there have already been four.*
 And we may expect a fifth for ourselves in due course of time.

 <strong>A</strong> <strong>F</strong>EW <strong>W</strong>ORDS
 ABOUT "<strong>D</strong>ELUGES" AND "<strong>N</strong>OAHS."
 </p><p>
 The accounts in the various Puranas about our Progenitors are
 as contradictory <em>in their details </em>as everything else.
 Thus while, <em>in the Rig Veda, </em>Ida (or Ila) is called the
 Instructress of Vaivasvata Manu, Sayana makes of her a goddess
 presiding over the Earth, and the Sathapatha Brahmana shows her
 to be the Manu's daughter, an <em>offering of his sacrifice, </em>and,
 later on, his (Vaivasvata's) <em>wife, by whom he begat the race
 of Manus. </em>In the Puranas, again, she is Vaivasvata's daughter,
 yet the wife of Budha (Wisdom), the illegitimate son of the Moon
 (Soma) and the planet Jupiter's (<em>Brihhaspati's</em>) wife,
 Tara. All this, which seems a jumble to the profane, is full of
 philosophical meaning to the Occultist. On the very face of the
 narrative a secret and sacred meaning is per-

 <p>
 ceivable, all the details, however, being so purposely mixed up
 that the experienced eye of an Initiate alone can follow them
 and place the events in their proper order.
 </p><p>
 The story as told in the "Mahabharata" strikes the key-note,
 and yet it needs to be explained by the secret sense contained
 in the Bhagavad Gita. It is the <em>prologue to the drama </em>of
 our (Fifth) Humanity. While Vaivasvata was engaged in devotion
 on the river bank, a fish craves his protection from a bigger
 fish. He saves and places it in a jar, where, growing larger and
 larger, it communicates to him the news of the forthcoming deluge.
 It is the well-known "Matsya Avatar," the first Avatar
 of Vishnu, the <em>Dagon* </em>of the Chaldean Xisuthrus, and
 many other things besides. The story is too well known to need
 repetition. Vishnu orders a ship to be built, in which Manu is
 said to be saved along with the seven Rishis, the latter, however,
 being absent from other texts. Here the seven Rishis stand for
 the <em>seven Races, </em>the seven principles, and various other
 things; for there is again a double mystery involved in this manifold
 allegory.
 </p><p>
 We have said elsewhere that the great Flood had several meanings,
 and that it referred, as also does the FALL, to both spiritual
 and physical, cosmic and terrestrial, events: as above, so it
 is below. The ship or ark -- <em>navis </em>-- in short, being
 the symbol of the female generative principle, is typified in
 the heavens by the Moon, and on Earth by the Womb: both being
 the vessels and bearers of the seeds of life and being, which
 the sun, or Vishnu, the male principle, vivifies and fructifies.**
 The First Cosmic Flood refers to primordial creation, or the formation
 of Heaven and the Earths; in which case Chaos and the great Deep
 stand for the "Flood," and the Moon for the "Mother,"
 from whom proceed all the life-germs.*** But the terrestrial Deluge

 * We must remember that at the head of all the Babylonian gods
 were <em>Ea,</em> Anu, and the primeval Bel; and that <em>Ea,</em>
 the first, was the God of Wisdom, the great "God of Light"
 and of the DEEP, and that he was identified with Oannes, or the
 Biblical Dagon -- the man-fish who rose out of the Persian Gulf.

 ** See Part. II. § "<em>The Holy of Holies</em>."

 *** It is far later on that the Moon became a male god; with the
 Hindus it was Soma, with the Chaldeans Nannak or Nannar, and Sin,
 the son of Mulil, the older Bel. The "Akkadians" called
 him the "Lord of Ghosts"; and he was the god of Nipoor
 (Niffer) in northern Babylonia. It is Mulil who caused the waters
 of the Flood to fall from heaven on Earth, for which Xisuthrus
 would not allow him to approach his altar. As the modern Assyriologists
 have now ascertained, it is the northern Nipoor which is the centre
 whence Chaldean (black) magic spread; and Eridu (the Southern)
 which was the primitive seat of the worship of the culture god,
 the god of divine wisdom -- the Sun-God being the supreme deity
 everywhere. With the Jews, the Moon is connected with Israel's
 Jehovah and his seed, because Ur was the chief seat of the worship
 of the Moon-god, and because Abraham is said to have come from
 Ur, when from A-bra(h)m, he becomes Abraham.</p><hr>

 its story has also its dual application. In one case it has reference
 to that mystery when mankind was saved from utter destruction,
 by the mortal woman being made the receptacle of the human seed
 at the end of the Third Race,* and in the other to the real and
 historical Atlantean submersion. In both cases the "Host"
 -- or the Manu which saved the <em>seed -- </em>is called Vaivasvata
 Manu. Hence the diversity between the Puranic and other versions;
 while in the Sathapatha Brahmana, Vaivasvata produces a daughter
 and begets from her the race of Manu; which is a reference to
 the first human <em>Manushyas, </em>who<em> </em>had to create
 women by will (<em>Kriyasakti</em>),<em> </em>before they were
 naturally born from the hermaphrodites as an independent sex,
 and who were, therefore, regarded as their creator's <em>daughters.
 </em>The Puranic accounts make of her (<em>Ida </em>or<em> Ila</em>)
 the wife of Budha (Wisdom), the latter version referring to the
 events of the Atlantean flood, when Vaivasvata, the great Sage
 on Earth, saved the Fifth Root-race from being destroyed along
 with the remnants of the Fourth.
 </p><p>
 This is shown very clearly in the <em>Bhagavad Gita, </em>where
 Krishna is made to say: --
 </p><p>
 "The Seven great Rishis, the <em>four preceding Manus, </em>partaking
 of my essence, were born from my mind: from them sprung (were
 born) the human races and the world." (<em>Chapter X., verse</em>
 6).
 </p><p>
 Here the four preceding "Manus," out of the seven, are
 the four Races** which have already lived, since Krishna belongs
 to the Fifth Race, his death having inaugurated the Kali Yuga.

 <p>
 * When Narada, the virgin-ascetic, threatened to put an end to
 the human race by preventing Daksha's sons from procreating it.
 </p><p>
 ** This is corroborated by a learned Brahmin. In his most excellent
 lectures on the Bhagavad Gita (<em>see "Theosophist,"
 April, </em>1887,<em> p.</em> 444) the lecturer says: "There
 is a peculiarity to which I must call your attention. He (Krishna)
 speaks here of four Manus. Why does he speak of four? We are now
 in the seventh Manvantara, that of Vaivasvata. If he is speaking
 of the past Manus, he ought to speak of six, but he only mentions
 four. In some commentaries an attempt has been made to interpret
 this in a peculiar manner. The word 'Chatvaraha' is separated
 from the word 'Manavaha,' and is made to refer to Sanaka, Sanandana,
 Sanatkumara, and Sanatsujata, who are also included among the
 mind-born sons of Prajapati. But this interpretation will lead
 to a most absurd conclusion, and make the sentence contradict
 itself. The persons alluded to in the text have a qualifying clause
 in the sentence. It is well known that Sanaka and the other three
 refused to create, though the other sons had consented to do so;
 therefore, in speaking of those persons from whom humanity has
 sprung into existence, it would be absurd to include those four
 also in the list. The passage must be interpreted without splitting
 the compound into two nouns. The number of Manus will then be
 four, and the statement would then contradict the Puranic account,
 though it would be in harmony with the occult theory. You will
 recollect that it is stated (in Occultism) that we are now in
 the Fifth Root-Race. Each Root-Race is considered as the <em>Santhathi
 </em>of a particular Manu. Now, the Fourth Race has passed, or,
 in other words, there have been four past Manus. . . . . "
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 141 VARIOUS DELUGES.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Manu, the son of Surya (the Sun), and the saviour of our Race,
 is connected with the <em>Seed of Life, </em>both physically and
 spiritually. But, at present, while speaking of all, we have to
 concern ourselves only with the first two.
 </p><p>
 The "Deluge" is undeniably an <em>universal tradition.
 </em>"Glacial periods" were numerous, and so were the
 "Deluges," for various reasons. Stockwell and Croll
 enumerate some half dozen Glacial Periods and subsequent Deluges
 -- the earliest of all being dated by them 850,000, and the last
 about 100,000, years ago.* But which was <em>our </em>Deluge?
 Assuredly the former, the one which to this date remains recorded
 in the traditions of all the peoples, from the remotest antiquity;
 the one that finally swept away the last peninsulas of Atlantis,
 beginning with Ruta and Daitya and ending with the (comparatively)
 small island mentioned by Plato. This is shown by the agreement
 of certain details in all the legends. It was the last of its
 gigantic character. The little deluge, the traces of which Baron
 Bunsen found in Central Asia, and which he places at about 10,000
 years <strong>B.C.</strong>, had nothing to do with either the
 semi-universal Deluge, or Noah's flood -- the latter being a purely
 mythical rendering of old traditions -- nor even with the submersion
 of the last Atlantean island; at least, only a moral connection.
 </p><p>
 Our Fifth Race (the non-initiated portions), hearing of many deluges,
 confused them, and now know of but one. This one altered the whole
 aspect of the globe in its interchange and shifting of land and
 sea.
 </p><p>
 We may compare the traditions of the Peruvians: -- "The Incas,
 <em>seven </em>in number, have repeopled the Earth after the deluge,"
 they say<em> (Coste </em>I,<em> IV., p. </em>19); Humboldt mentions
 the Mexican version of the same legend, but confuses somewhat
 the details of the still-preserved legend concerning the American
 Noah. Nevertheless, the eminent Naturalist mentions <em>twice
 seven </em>companions and the <em>divine bird </em>which preceded
 the boat of the Aztecs, and thus makes fifteen elect instead of
 the seven and the fourteen. This was written probably under some
 involuntary reminiscence of Moses, who is said to have mentioned
 fifteen grandsons of Noah, who escaped with their grandsire. Then
 again Xisuthrus, the Chaldean Noah, is saved and translated <em>alive
 </em>to heaven -- like Enoch -- with the seven gods, the <em>Kabirim,
 </em>or the seven divine Titans; again the Chinese <em>Yao </em>has<em>
 seven </em>figures which sail with him and which he will <em>animate
 </em>when he lands, and use for "human seed." Osiris,
 when he enters the ark, or solar boat, takes <em>seven </em>Rays
 with him, etc., etc.

 with Agruerus, the great Phoenician god (whom Faber sought to
 identify with Noah*); further, it is suspected that the name of
 "Titan" is derived from <em>Tit-Ain</em> -- "the
 fountains of the chaotic abyss"** (Tit-Theus, or Tityus is
 "the <em>divine deluge</em>");<em> </em>and thus the
 Titans, who are <em>seven, </em>are shown to be connected with
 the Flood and the seven Rishis saved by Vaivasvata Manu.***
 </p><p>
 They are the sons of Kronos (Time) and Rhea (the Earth); and as
 Agruerus, Saturn and Sydyk are one and the same personage, and
 as the seven Kabiri are said to be the sons of Sydyk or Kronos-Saturn,
 the Kabiri and Titans are identical. For once the pious Faber
 was right in his conclusions when he wrote: "I have no doubt
 of the seven Titans and Kabiri being the same as the seven Rishis
 of the Hindu <em>mythology </em>(?)<em>, </em>who are said to
 have escaped in a boat along with Manu, the head (?) of the family."
 </p><p>
 But he is less fortunate in his speculations when he adds "The
 Hindoos, in their <em>wild </em>legends have <em>variously perverted
 the history of the Noachidae </em>(? !), yet it is remarkable
 that they seem to have religiously adhered to the number seven."****
 Hence Captain (Col.) Wilford very judiciously observes: that "Perhaps
 the seven Manus, the seven Brahmadicas and the seven Rishis are
 the same, and make only seven individual persons.***** The seven
 Brahmadicas were Prajapatis, or lords 'of the prajas or creatures.'
 From them mankind was born, and they are probably the same with
 the seven Manus. . . . These seven grand ancestors of the human
 race were created for the purpose of replenishing the Earth with
 inhabitants." (<em>Asiatic Researches, Vol. V. p. </em>246);
 and Faber adds that: "the mutual resemblance of the Kabirs,
 the Titans, the Rishis, and the Noetic family, is too striking
 to be the effect of mere accident."******
 </p><p>
 Faber was led into this mistake, and subsequently built his entire
 theory concerning the Kabiri, on the fact that the name of the
 scriptural
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * Agruerus is <em>Kronos, </em>or Saturn, and the prototype of
 the Israelitish Jehovah. As connected with <em>Argha, </em>the
 Moon or Ark of salvation, Noah is mythologically one with Saturn.
 But then this cannot relate to the terrestrial flood. (<em>But
 see Faber's "Kabiri," Vol. I, pp. </em>35, 43, <em>and
 </em>45.)
 </p><p>
 ** See <em>ibid., </em>Vol. II., p. 240.
 </p><p>
 *** Sanchoniathon says that the Titans were the sons of Kronos,
 and seven in number; and he calls them fire-worshippers, Aletae
 (sons of Agni?), and diluvians. Al-ait is the god of fire.
 </p><p>
 **** Of which <em>seven,</em> let us remark, the Aryans, and not
 the Semites, were the originators, while the Jews got that number
 from the Chaldeans.
 </p><p>
 ***** Seven individual sons of God, or Pitars and Pitris; also
 in this case the sons of Kronos or Saturn (<em>Kala</em> "time")
 and <em>Arkites, </em>like the Kabiri and Titans, as their name
 <em>-- </em>"<em>lunar </em>ancestors" -- shows, the
 Moon being the Ark, or <em>Argha, </em>on the watery abyss of
 space.
 </p><p>
 ****** <em>See </em>"<em>Kabiri,</em>" Vol. I., p. 131.
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 143 THE ARKITE SYMBOLS.</h6>
 
 <p>
 Japhet is on the list of the Titans contained in a verse of the
 Orphic hymns. According to Orpheus the names of the seven "Arkite"
 Titans (whom Faber refuses to identify with the <em>impious </em>Titans,
 their descendants) were Koeus, Kroeus, Phorcys, Kronos, Oceanus,
 Hyperion, and <em>Iapetus:</em> --
 </p><blockquote>
 [[<i>Koion te, Kroion te melan, Phorkun te krataion, <br>
 Kai Kronon, Okeanon d, 'Huperioa te Iapeponet.</i>]]<br>
 <i>--</i> (<i>Orph. apud Proclum. In Tim. lib. v. p. </i>295.
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 But why could not the Babylonian Ezra have adopted the name of
 <em>Iapetos </em>for one of Noah's sons? The Kabiri, who are the
 Titans, are also called Manes and their mother Mania, according
 to Arnobius. (<em>Adversum Gentes, lib. III., p. </em>124.) The
 Hindus can therefore claim with far more reason that the Manes
 mean their Manus, and that Mania is the <em>female </em>Manu.
 (See <em>Ramayana</em>.) Mania is Ila or Ida, the wife and daughter
 of Vaivasvata Manu, from whom "he begat the race of Manus."
 Like <em>Rhea, </em>the mother of the Titans, she is the Earth
 (Sayana making her the goddess of the Earth), and she is but the
 second edition and repetition of Vach. Both <em>Ida</em> and<em>
 Vach </em>are turned into males and females; Ida becoming Sudyumna,
 and Vach, "the female Viraj," turning into a woman in
 order to punish the Gandharvas; one version referring to cosmic
 and divine theogony, the other to the later period. The<em> Manes
 </em>and Mania of Arnobius are names of Indian origin, appropriated
 by the Greeks and Latins and disfigured by them.
 </p><p>
 Thus it is no accident, but the result of one archaic doctrine
 common to all, of which the Israelites, through Ezra, the author
 of the modernised Mosaic books, were the latest adapters. So unceremonious
 were they with other people's property, that Berosus (<em>Antiquitates
 Libyae,</em> I, <em>fol. </em>8), shows that <em>Titea -- </em>of
 whom Diodorus makes the mother of the Titans or <em>Diluvians
 </em>(<em>See Bibl. lib. III. p. </em>170) -- was the <em>wife
 of Noah. </em>For this Faber calls him the "<em>pseudo-Berosus,</em>"<em>
 </em>yet accepts the information in order to register one proof
 more that the pagans have borrowed all their gods from the Jews,
 by transforming patriarchal material. According to our humble
 opinion, this is one of the best proofs possible of exactly the
 reverse. It shows as clearly as facts can show, that it is the
 Biblical <em>pseudo</em>-personages which are all borrowed from
 pagan myths, if myths they must be. It shows, at any rate, that
 Berosus was well aware of the source of <em>Genesis, </em>and
 that it bore the same cosmic astronomical character as the allegories
 of Isis-Osiris, and the Ark, and other older "Arkite"
 symbols. For, Berosus says that "Titea magna" was afterwards
 called <em>Aretia,* </em>and worshipped with the Earth; and this

 identifies "Titea," Noah's consort, with <em>Rhea, </em>the
 mother of the Titans, and with <em>Ida -</em>- both being goddesses
 who preside over the Earth, and the mothers of the Manus and Manes
 (or Tit-an-Kabiri). And "Titea-Aretia" was worshipped
 as <em>Horchia, </em>says the same Berosus, and this is a title
 of Vesta, goddess of the Earth. "<em>Sicanus deificavit Aretiam,
 et nominavit eam lingua Janigena Horchiam.</em>"<em> </em>(<em>Ibid.
 lib. V. fol. </em>64.)
 </p><p>
 Scarce an ancient poet of historic or prehistoric days who failed
 to mention the sinking of the two continents -- often called isles
 -- in one form or another. Hence the destruction, besides Atlantis,
 of the Phlegyae. (See Pausanias and Nonus, who both tell how:
 </p><blockquote>
 "From its deep-rooted base the Phlegyan isle<br>
 Stern Neptune shook, and plunged beneath the waves<br>
 Its impious inhabitants. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."<br>
 <i>-- Dionysius lib xviii. p. </i>319).
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 Faber felt convinced that the "insulae Phlegyae" were
 Atlantis. But all such allegories are more or less distorted echoes
 of the Hindu tradition about that great Cataclysm, which befell
 the Fourth, really human, though gigantic, Race, the one which
 preceded the Aryan. Yet, as just said, like all other legends,
 that of "the Deluge has more than one meaning. It refers
 in Theogony, to <em>pre-cosmic transformations,</em> to <em>spiritual
 correlations -- </em>however<em> </em>absurd the term may sound
 to a scientific ear -- and also to subsequent Cosmogony; to the
 great FLOOD of WATERS (matter) in CHAOS, awakened and fructified
 by those Spirit-Rays which were swamped by, and <em>perished </em>in,
 the mysterious differentiation -- a pre-cosmic mystery, the Prologue
 to the drama of Being. Anu, Bel, and Noah preceded Adam Kadmon,
 Adam the Red, and Noah; just as Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva preceded
 Vaivasvata and the rest." (See "<em>Isis Unveiled.,</em>"<em>
 </em>Vol<em>. </em>II., pp. 420 <em>et seq., </em>where one or
 two of the seven meanings are hinted at.)
 </p><p>
 All this goes to show that the <em>semi</em>-universal deluge
 known to geology (first glacial period) must have occurred just
 at the time allotted to it by the Secret Doctrine: namely, 200,000
 years (in round numbers) after the commencement of our FIFTH RACE,
 or about the time assigned by Messrs. Croll and Stockwell for
 the first glacial period: <em>i.e.</em>, about 850,000 years ago.
 Thus, as the latter disturbance is attributed by geologists and
 astronomers to "an extreme eccentricity of the Earth's

 orbit," and as the Secret Doctrine attributes it to the same
 source, but with the addition of another factor, the shifting
 of the Earth's axis -- a proof of which may be found in the <em>Book
 of Enoch,* </em>if the veiled language of the Puranas is not understood
 -- all this should tend to show that the ancients knew something
 of the "modern discoveries" of Science. Enoch, when
 speaking of "the great inclination of the Earth," which
 "is in travail," is quite significant and clear.
 </p><p>
 Is not this evident? Nuah is Noah, <em>floating </em>on the waters
 in his ark; the latter being the emblem of the Argha, or Moon,
 the feminine principle; Noah is the "spirit" falling
 into matter. We find him, as soon as he descends upon the Earth,
 planting a vineyard, drinking of the wine, and getting drunk on
 it, <em>i.e., </em>the pure spirit becomes intoxicated as soon
 as it is finally imprisoned in matter. The seventh chapter of
 <em>Genesis </em>is only another version of the First. Thus, while
 the latter reads: "and darkness was upon the face of the
 deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,"
 in ch. 7 it is said " . . . and the waters prevailed . .
 . and the ark went (with Noah, the spirit) upon the face of the
 waters." Thus Noah, if identical with the Chaldean Nuah,
 is the spirit vivifying <em>matter, </em>which latter is Chaos,
 represented by the <strong>D</strong>EEP, or the Waters of the
 Flood. In the Babylonian legend (the pre-cosmical blended with
 the terrestrial event) it is Ishtar (Astaroth or Venus, the lunar
 goddess) who is shut up in the ark and sends out "a <em>dove
 </em>in search of dry land." ("<em>Isis Unveiled</em>"<em>
 Vol. </em>II, <em>pp.</em> 423<em> and</em> 424)<em>.</em> 
 </p><p>
 George Smith notes in the "<em>Tablets</em>,"<em> </em>first
 the creation of the moon, and then that of the sun: "Its
 beauty and perfection are extolled, and the regularity of its
 orbit, which led to its being considered the type of a judge and
 the regulator of the world." If this story related simply
 to a cosmogonical cataclysm -- even were this latter universal
 -- why should the goddess Ishtar or Astoreth, the Moon, speak
 of the <em>creation of the sun </em>after the deluge? The waters
 might have reached as high as the mountain of <em>Nizir </em>(Chaldean
 version), or Jebel Djudi (the deluge mountains of the Arabian
 legend), or yet Ararat (of the Biblical narrative), and even the
 Himalaya (of the Hindu tradition), and yet not reach the sun:
 the Bible itself stopped short of such a miracle! It is evident
 that the deluge of the people who first recorded it had another
 meaning, less problematical and far more philosophical than that
 of an <em>universal </em>deluge, of which there are no geological
 traces whatever.
 </p><p>
 As all such Cataclysms are periodical and cyclical, and as Manu
 Vaivasvata figures as a <em>generic </em>character, under various
 circumstances and events (<em>vide infra: "The Seven Manus
 of Humanity</em>"),<em> </em>there seems to be no

 serious objection to the supposition that the first "great
 flood" had an allegorical, as well as a cosmic meaning, and
 that it happened at the end of the Satya Yuga, the "age of
 Truth," when the <em>Second </em>Root Race, "The Manu
 with bones," made its primeval appearance as "the Sweat-Born."*
 </p><p>
 The Second Flood -- the so-called "universal" -- which
 affected the Fourth Root Race (now conveniently regarded by theology
 as "the accursed race of giants," the <strong>C</strong>AINITES,
 and "the sons of Ham") is that flood which was first
 perceived by geology. If one carefully compares the accounts in
 the various legends of the Chaldees and other exoteric works of
 the nations, it will be found that all of them agree with the
 orthodox narratives given in the Brahmanical books. And it may
 be perceived that while, in the first account, "there is
 no God or mortal yet on Earth," when Manu Vaivasvata lands
 on the Himavan; in the second, the Seven Rishis are allowed to
 keep him company: thus showing that whereas some accounts refer
 to the sidereal and cosmic <strong>F</strong>LOOD before the so-called
 creation, the others treat, one of the Great Flood of Matter on
 Earth, and the other of a real watery deluge. In the <em>Satapatha
 Brahmana, </em>Manu finds that "the Flood had swept away
 all living creatures, and he alone was left" -- <em>i.e.,
 the seed of life </em>alone remained from the previous dissolution
 of the <em>Universe, </em>or <em>Mahapralaya, </em>after<em> </em>a
 "Day of Brahma"; and the <em>Mahabharata </em>refers
 simply to the geological cataclysm which swept away nearly all
 the Fourth Race to make room for the Fifth. Therefore is Vaivasvata
 Manu shown under three distinct attributes in our esoteric Cosmogony:**
 (<em>a</em>) as the "Root-Manu"
 </p><h6>[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------
 </h6>
 
 <p>
 * All such expressions are explained in the "<em>Anthropogenesis</em>"<em>
 </em>of this Book, and elsewhere.
 </p><p>
 ** One has to remember that, in the Hindu philosophy, every differentiated
 unit is such only through the cycles of Maya, being one in its
 essence with the Supreme or One Spirit. Hence arises the seeming
 confusion and contradiction in the various Puranas, and at times
 in the same Purana, about the same individual. Vishnu -- as the
 many-formed Brahma, and as Brahma (neuter) -- is one, and yet
 he is said to be all the 28 Vyasas (<em>Vishnu Purana</em>)<em>.
 </em>"In every Dvapara (third) age, <em>Vishnu, in the person
 of Vyasa, </em>divides the Veda, which is one, into four and many
 portions. Twenty-eight times have the Vedas been arranged by the
 great Rishis in the Vaivasvata Manvantara, in the Dvapara Yuga
 . . . and, consequently, twenty-eight Vyasas have passed away
 . . . they who were all <em>in the form of Veda-Vyasas, </em>who
 were the Vyasas of their respective eras. . . . " (<em>Book
 III., Ch</em>. III.) "This world is Brahma in Brahma, from
 Brahma . . . nothing further to be known." Then, again .
 . . "There were in the First Manvantara seven celebrated
 sons of Vasishta, who in the <em>Third</em> Manvantara, were sons
 of Brahma (<em>i.e</em>., Rishis), the illustrious progeny of
 Urja." This is plain: the Humanity of the First Manvantara
 is that of the seventh and of all the intermediate ones. The mankind
 of the First Root-Race is the mankind of the <em>second, third,
 fourth, fifth</em>, etc. To the last it forms a cyclic and constant
 reincarnation of the Monads belonging to the Dhyan Chohans of
 our Planetary chain. </p><hr>

 <p>
 on Globe A in the First Round; (<em>b</em>) as the "<em>seed
 </em>of life" on Globe D in the Fourth Round; and (<em>c</em>)
 as the "Seed of Man" at the beginning of every Root-Race
 -- in our Fifth Race especially. The very commencement of the
 latter witnesses, during the Dvapara Yuga,* the destruction of
 the accursed sorcerers; "of that island (Plato speaking only
 of its last island) beyond the Pillars of Hercules, in the Atlantic
 Ocean, from which there was an easy transition to other islands
 in the neighbourhood of another <em>large Continent</em>"
 (America). It is this "Atlantic" land which was connected
 with the "<em>White Island,</em>"<em> </em>and this
 White Island was Ruta; but it was not the Atala and the<em> "White
 Devil</em>"<em> </em>of Colonel Wilford (<em>see "Asiatic
 Researches," Vol. VIII., p. </em>280), as already shown.
 It may well be remarked here that the Dvapara Yuga lasts 864,000
 years, according to the Sanskrit texts; and that, if the <em>Kali
 Yuga </em>began only about 5,000 years ago, that it is just 869,000
 since that destruction took place. Again, these figures are not
 very widely different from those given by the geologists, who
 place their "glacial period" 850,000 years ago.
 </p><p>
 Then "a woman was produced who came to Manu and declared
 <em>herself his daughter, with whom he lived and begat the offspring
 of Manu</em>."<em> </em>This refers to the physiological
 transformation of sexes during the Third Root-Race. And the allegory
 is too transparently clear to need much explanation. Of course,
 as already remarked, in the separation of sexes an androgyne being
 was supposed to divide his body into two halves (as in the case
 of Brahma and Vach, and even of Adam and Eve), and thus the female
 is, in a certain sense, his daughter, just as he will be her son,
 "the flesh of his (and her) flesh and the bone of his (and
 her) bone." Let it be also well remembered that not one of
 our Orientalists have yet learned to discern in those "contradictions
 and amazing nonsense," as some call the Puranas, that a reference
 to a Yuga may mean a Round, a Root-Race, and often a <em>Sub-Race,
 </em>as well as form a page torn out of pre-cosmic theogony. This
 double and triple meaning is proved by various references to one
 and the same individual apparently, under an identical name, while
 it refers, in fact, to events divided by entire Kalpas. A good
 instance is that of Ila. She is first represented as one thing
 and then as another. In the exoteric legends it is said that Manu
 Vaivasvata, desiring to create sons, instituted a sacrifice to
 Mitra and Varuna; but, through a mistake of the officiating

 * The Dvapara Yuga differs for each Race. All races have their
 own cycles, which fact causes a great difference. For instance,
 the Fourth Sub-Race of the Atlanteans was in its Kali-Yug, when
 destroyed, whereas the Fifth was in its Satya or <em>Krita </em>Yuga.
 The Aryan Race is now in its Kali Yuga, and will continue to be
 in it for 427,000 years longer, while various "family Races,"
 called the Semitic, Hamitic, etc., are in their own special cycles.
 The forthcoming 6th Sub Race -- which may begin very soon -- will
 be in its Satya (golden) age while we reap the fruit of our iniquity
 in our Kali Yuga.</p><hr>

 Brahman, a daughter only was obtained -- Ila. Then, "through
 the favour of the gods," her <em>sex is changed </em>and
 she becomes a man, <em>Su-dyumna. </em>Then she is again turned
 into a woman, and so on; the fable adding that Siva and his consort
 were pleased that "she would be male one month and female
 another." This has a direct reference to the Third Root-Race,
 whose men were androgynes. But some very learned Orientalists
 think (<em>see </em>"<em>Hindu Classical Dictionary</em>")<em>
 </em>and have declared that "Ila was primarily food, nourishment,
 or a libation of milk; thence a stream of praise, personified
 as the goddess of speech." The "profane" are not
 told, however, the reason why "a libation of milk,"
 or "a stream of praise," should be <em>male </em>and<em>
 female </em>by turn: unless, indeed there is some "internal
 evidence" which the occultists fail to perceive.
 </p><p>
 In their most mystical meanings, the union of Swayambhuva Manu
 with Vach-Sata-Rupa, his own daughter (this being the first "euhemerization"
 of the dual principle of which Vaivasvata Manu and Ila are a secondary
 and a third form), stands in Cosmic symbolism as the Root-life,
 the germ from which spring all the Solar Systems, the worlds,
 angels and the gods. For, as says Vishnu: --
 </p><blockquote>
 "From Manu all creation, gods, Asuras, man must be produced,
 <br>
 By him the world must be created, that which moves and moveth
 not. . . . ."
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
 But we may find worse opponents than even the Western Scientists
 and Orientalists. If, on the question of figures, Brahmins may
 agree with our teaching, we are not so sure that some of them,
 orthodox conservatives, may not raise objections to the modes
 of procreation attributed to their <em>Pitar Devatas. </em>We
 shall be called upon to produce the works from which we quote,
 while they will be invited by us to read their own Puranas a little
 more carefully and with an eye to the esoteric meaning. And then,
 we repeat again, they will find, under the veil of more or less
 transparent allegories, every statement made herein corroborated
 by their own works. One or two instances have already been given
 as regards the appearance of the Second Race, which is called
 the "Sweat-Born." This allegory is regarded as a fairy-tale,
 and yet it conceals a psycho-physiological phenomenon, and one
 of the greatest mysteries of Nature.
 </p><p>
 But in view of the chronological statements made herein, it is
 natural to ask: --
 </p><h4><strong>C</strong>OULD <strong>M</strong>EN <strong>E</strong>XIST
 18,000,000<strong> Y</strong>EARS <strong>A</strong>GO?</h4>
 
 <p>
 To this Occultism answers in the affirmative, notwithstanding
 all scientific objectors. Moreover, this duration covers only
 the Vaivasvata-Manu <em>Man, i.e., </em>the male and female entity
 already separated into</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 149 HOW OLD IS HUMANITY?</h6>
 
 <p>
 distinct sexes. The two and a half Races that preceded that event
 may have lived 300,000,000 years ago for all that science can
 tell. For the geological and physical difficulties in the way
 of the theory could not exist for the <em>primeval, ethereal </em>man
 of the Occult teachings. <em>The whole issue of the quarrel between
 the profane and the esoteric sciences depends upon the belief
 in, and demonstration of, the existence of an astral body within
 the physical, </em>the former independent of the latter. Paul
 d'Assier, the Positivist, seems to have proven the fact pretty
 plainly,* not to speak of the accumulated testimony of the ages,
 and that of the modern spiritualists and mystics. It will be found
 difficult to reject this fact in our age of proofs, tests, and
 ocular demonstrations.
 </p><p>
 The Secret Doctrine maintains that, notwithstanding the general
 cataclysms and disturbances of our globe, which -- owing to its
 being the period of its greatest physical development, for the
 Fourth Round is the middle-point of the life allotted to it --
 were far more terrible and intense than during any of the three
 preceding Rounds (the cycles of its earlier psychic and spiritual
 life and of its semi-ethereal conditions) physical Humanity has
 existed upon it for the last 18,000,000 years.** This period was
 preceded by 300,000,000 years of the mineral and vegetable development.
 To this, all those who refuse to accept the theory of a "boneless,"
 purely ethereal, man, will object. Science, which knows only of
 <em>physical</em> organisms, will feel indignant; and materialistic
 theology still more so. The first will object on logical and reasonable
 grounds, based on the preconception that all animate organisms
 have always existed on the same plane of materiality in all the
 ages; the last on a tissue of most absurd fictions. The ridiculous
 claim usually brought forward by theologians, is based on the
 virtual assumption that mankind (read Christians) on this planet
 have the honour of being the only human beings in the whole Kosmos,
 who dwell on a globe, and that they are consequently, the best
 of their kind.***

 <p>
 The Occultists, who believe firmly in the teachings of the mother-philosophy,
 repel the objections of both theologians and scientists. They
 maintain, on their side, that, during those periods when there
 must have been insufferable heat, even at the two poles, successive
 floods, upheaval of the valleys and constant shifting of the great
 waters and seas, none of these circumstances could form an impediment
 to human life and organization, such <em>as is assigned by them
 to the early mankind. </em>Neither the heterogeneity of ambient
 regions, full of deleterious gases, nor the perils of a crust
 hardly consolidated, could prevent the First and Second Races
 from making their appearance even during the Carboniferous, or
 the Silurian age itself.
 </p><p>
 Thus the <em>Monads </em>destined to animate future Races were
 ready for the new transformation. They had passed their phases
 of immetalization, of plant and animal life, from the lowest to
 the highest, and were waiting for their human, more intelligent
 form. Yet, what could the plastic modellers do but follow the
 laws of evolutionary Nature? Could they, as claimed by the Biblical
 dead-letter, form "Lord-God"-like, or as Pygmalion in
 the Greek allegory, Adam-Galatea out of volcanic dust, and breathe
 a <em>living soul </em>into Man? No: because the soul was already
 there, latent in its <em>Monad, </em>and needed but a <em>coating.
 </em>Pygmalion, who fails to <em>animate his statue, </em>and
 Bahak-Zivo of the Nazarean Gnostics, who fails to construct "a
 human soul in the creature," are, as conceptions, far more
 philosophical and scientific than Adam, taken in the dead-letter
 sense, or the Biblical Elohim-Creators. Esoteric philosophy, which
 teaches spontaneous generation -- after the Sishta and Prajapati
 have thrown the seed of life on the Earth -- shows the lower angels
 able to <em>construct physical </em>man only, even with the help
 of Nature, after having evolved the ethereal form out of themselves,
 and leaving the physical form to evolve gradually from its ethereal,
 or what would now be called, <em>protoplasmic</em> model.
 </p><p>
 This will again be objected to: "Spontaneous Generation"
 is an exploded theory, we shall be told. Pasteur's experiments
 disposed of it twenty years ago, and Professor Tyndall is against
 it. Well, suppose he is? He ought to know that, should spontaneous

 and dwelling of intelligent creatures endowed with will, subject
 to law and capable of free-will; then, it would become extravagant
 to think that our world should have been the subject of God's
 favours and His special interference, of His communications and
 His <em>personal visit</em>. . . . . . . Can the Earth presume
 to be considered the centre of the moral and religious Universe,
 he asks, if it has not the slightest distinction to rely upon
 in the physical Universe? Is it not as absurd to uphold such an
 assertion (of the plurality of inhabited worlds), as it would
 be to-day to uphold the old hypothesis of Ptolemy, who placed
 Earth in the centre of our system? . . . The above is quoted from

 be indeed proven impossible in our present world-period and actual
 conditions -- which the Occultists deny -- still it would be no
 demonstration that it could not have taken place under different
 cosmic conditions, not only in the seas of the Laurentian period,
 but even on the then convulsed Earth. It would be interesting
 to know how Science could ever account for the appearance of species
 and life on Earth, especially of <em>Man, </em>once that she rejects
 both the Biblical teachings and spontaneous generation. Pasteur's
 observations, however, are far from being perfect or proven. Blanchard
 and Dr. Lutaud reject their importance and show that they have
 none. The question is so far left <em>sub judice, </em>as well
 as that other one "when, at what period, life appeared on
 the Earth?" As to the idea that Haeckel's Moneron -- a pinch
 of salt! -- has solved the problem of the origin of life, it is
 simply absurd. Those materialists, who feel inclined to pooh-pooh
 the theory of the "Self-existent," the "Self-born
 heavenly man," represented as an ethereal, astral man, must
 excuse even a tyro in Occultism laughing, in his turn, at some
 speculations of modern thought. After proving most learnedly that
 the primitive speck of <em>protoplasm </em>(moneron) is neither
 animal nor plant, but both, and that it <em>has no ancestors </em>among
 either of these, since it is that moneron which serves as a point
 of departure for all organized existence, we are finally told
 that <em>the Monera are their own ancestors. </em>This may be
 very scientific, but it is very metaphysical also; too much so,
 even for the Occultist.
 </p><p>
 If spontaneous generation has changed its methods now, owing perhaps
 to accumulated material on hand, so as to almost escape detection,
 it was in full swing in the genesis of terrestrial life. Even
 the simple physical form and the evolution of species show how
 Nature proceeds. The scale-bound, gigantic sauria, the winged
 pterodactyl, the Megalosaurus, and the hundred-feet long Iguanodon
 of the later period, are the transformations of the earliest representatives
 of the animal kingdom found in the sediments of the primary epoch.
 There was a time when all those above enumerated "antediluvian"
 monsters appeared as filamentoid infusoria without shell or crust,
 with neither nerves, muscles, organs nor sex, and reproduced their
 kind by gemmation: as do microscopical animals also, the architects
 and builders of our mountain ranges, agreeably to the teachings
 of science. Why not man in this case? Why should he not have followed
 the same law in his growth, <em>i.e.</em>, gradual condensation?
 Every unprejudiced person would prefer to believe that primeval
 humanity had at first an ethereal -- or, if so preferred, a huge
 filamentoid, jelly-like form, evolved by gods or natural "forces,"
 which grew, condensed throughout millions of ages, and became
 gigantic in its physical impulse and tendency, until it settled
 into the huge, physical form of the Fourth Race Man, -- rather
 </p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 152 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.</h6>
 
 <p>
 than believe him created of the dust of the Earth (<em>literally</em>),<em>
 </em>or from some unknown anthropoid ancestor.
 </p><p>
 Nor does our esoteric theory clash with scientific data, except
 on first appearance, as Dr. A. Wilson, <b>F.R.S</b>., says, in
 a letter to "<em>Knowledge,</em>"<em> </em>(<em>Dec.
 </em>23<em>, </em>1881). "Evolution -- rather Nature, in
 the light of evolution -- has only been studied for some <em>twenty-five
 years or so. </em>That is, of course, a mere fractional space
 in the history of human thought." And just because of that
 we do not lose all hope that materialistic science will amend
 its ways, and will gradually accept the esoteric teachings --
 if even at first divorced from their (to science) too metaphysical
 elements.
 </p><p>
 Has the last word on the subject of human evolution yet been said?
 "Each . . . . answer to the great Question (Man's Real Place
 in Nature), invariably asserted by the followers of its propounder,
 if not by himself, to be <em>complete and final, </em>remains
 in high authority and esteem, <em>it may</em> <em>be</em> <em>for
 one century, </em>it may be for twenty," writes Prof. Huxley;
 "but, as invariably, time proves each reply to have been
 a <em>mere approximation</em> <em>to the truth -- tolerable chiefly
 on account of the ignorance of those by</em> <em>whom it was accepted,
 and wholly intolerable when tested by the larger knowledge of
 their successors</em>"! !<em> </em>Will this eminent Darwinian
 admit the possibility of his <em>pithecoid ancestry </em>being
 assignable to the list of "wholly intolerable beliefs,"
 in the "larger knowledge" of Occultists? <em>But whence
 the savage? </em>Mere "rising to the civilized state"
 does not account for the evolution of form.
 </p><p>
 In the same letter, "The Evolution of Man," Dr. Wilson
 makes other strange confessions. Thus, he observes, in answer
 to the queries put to "<em>Knowledge</em>"<em> </em>by
 "G. M.": --
 </p><p>
 " 'Has evolution effected any change in man? If so, what
 change? If not, why not?' . . . If we refuse to admit (as science
 does) that man was created a perfect being, and then became degraded,
 there exists only another supposition -- that of evolution. If
 man has arisen from a savage to a civilized state, that surely
 is evolution. <em>We do not yet know, because such knowledge is
 difficult to acquire, if the human frame is subject to the same
 influences as those of lower animals. </em>But there is little
 doubt that elevation from savagery to civilized life means and
 implies 'evolution,' and that of considerable extent. Mentally,
 man's evolution cannot be doubted; the ever-widening sphere of
 thought has sprung from small and rude beginnings, like language
 itself. But man's ways of life, his power of adaptation to his
 surroundings, and countless other circumstances, have made the
 facts and course of his 'evolution' very difficult to trace."
 </p><p>
 This very difficulty ought to make the Evolutionists more cautious
 in their affirmations. But why is evolution <em>impossible, </em>if
 "man was created a perfect being, and then became degraded?"
 At best it can only apply</p><hr>
 
 <h6>[[Vol. 2, Page]] 153 ARISTOTLE DENIED HELIOCENTRICISM.</h6>
 
 <p>
 to the <em>outward, physical man. </em>As remarked in "<em>Isis
 Unveiled,</em>" Darwin's evolution begins at the middle point,
 instead of commencing for man, as for everything else, from the
 universals. The Aristotle-Baconian method may have its advantages,
 but it has undeniably already demonstrated its defects. Pythagoras
 and Plato, who proceeded from the Universals downwards, are now
 shown more learned, in the light of modern science, than was Aristotle.
 For he opposed and denounced the idea of the revolution of the
 earth and even of its rotundity. "Almost all those,"
 he wrote, "who affirm that they have studied heaven in its
 uniformity, claim that the earth is in the centre, but the philosophers
 of the Italian School, otherwise called the Pythagoreans, teach
 entirely the contrary. . . ." Because (<em>a</em>) the Pythagoreans
 were Initiates, and (<em>b</em>) they followed the deductive method.
 Whereas, Aristotle, the father of the inductive system, complained
 of those who taught that "the centre of our system was occupied
 by the Sun, and the earth was only a star, which by a rotatory
 motion around the same centre, produces night and day" (<em>Vide
 De Caelo, </em>Book II., c. 13.) The same with regard to man.
 The theory taught in the Secret Doctrine, and now expounded, is
 the only one, which can -- without falling into the absurdity
 of a "miraculous" man created out of the dust of the
 Earth, or the still greater fallacy of man evolving from a pinch
 of lime-salt, (the ex-protoplasmic moneron) -- account for his
 appearance on Earth.
 </p><p>
 <em>Analogy </em>is the guiding law in Nature, the only true Ariadne's
 thread that can lead us, through the inextricable paths of her
 domain, toward her primal and final mysteries. Nature, as a creative
 potency, is infinite, and no generation of physical scientists
 can ever boast of having exhausted the list of her ways and methods,
 however uniform the laws upon which she proceeds. If we can conceive
 of a ball of Fire-mist becoming gradually -- as it rolls through
 aeons of time in the interstellar spaces -- a planet, a self-luminous
 globe, to settle into a <em>man-bearing </em>world or Earth, thus
 having passed from a soft plastic body into a rock-bound globe;
 and if we see on it everything evolving from the non-nucleated
 jelly-speck that becomes the sarcode* of the <em>moneron, </em>then
 passes from its <em>protistic </em>state** into the form of an
 animal, to grow into a gigantic reptilian monster of the Mesozoic
 times; then dwindles again into the (comparatively) dwarfish crocodile,
 now confined solely to tropical

 ** The Monera are indeed <em>Protista. </em>They are neither animals
 "nor plants," writes Haeckel; " . . . the whole
 body of the Moneron represents nothing more than a single thoroughly
 homogeneous particle of albumen in a firmly adhesive condition."

 </em>1869, <em>p</em>. 28.)</p><hr>

 regions, and the universally common lizard* -- how can man alone
 escape the general law? "There were giants on earth in those
 days," says <em>Genesis, </em>repeating the statement of
 all the other Eastern Scriptures; and the <em>Titans </em>are
 founded on anthropological and physiological fact.
 </p><p>
 And, as the hard-shelled crustacean was once upon a time a jelly-speck,
 "a thoroughly homogeneous particle of albumen in a firmly
 adhesive condition," so was the outward covering of primitive
 man, his early "coat of skin," <em>plus </em>an immortal
 spiritual monad, and a psychic temporary form and body within
 that shell. The modern, hard, muscular man almost impervious to
 any climate, was, perhaps, some 25,000,000 years ago, just what
 the Haeckelian Moneron is, strictly "an organism without
 organs," an entirely homogeneous substance with a structureless
 albumen body within, and a human form only outwardly.
 </p><p>
 No man of science has the right, in this century, to find the
 figures of the Brahmins preposterous in the question of Chronology;
 for their own calculations often exceed by far the claims made
 by esoteric science. This may easily be shown.
 </p><p>
 Helmholtz calculated that the cooling of our Earth from a temperature
 of 2,000 [[degrees]] to 200' Cent. must have occupied a period
 of no less than 350,000,000 years. Western science (including
 geology) seems generally to allow our globe an age of about 500,000,000
 years altogether. Sir W. Thomson, however, limits the appearance
 of the earliest vegetable life to 100,000,000 years ago -- a statement
 respectfully contradicted by the archaic records. Speculations,
 furthermore, vary daily in the domains of science. Meanwhile,
 some geologists are very much opposed to such limitation. "Volger
 . . . . calculates, that the time requisite for the deposit of
 the strata known to us must at least have amounted to 648 millions
 of years . . . . " Both time and space are infinite and eternal.
 "The Earth, as a material existence, is indeed infinite;
 the changes only which it has undergone can be determined by finite
 periods of time" (<em>Burmeister</em>)<em>. </em>"We
 must therefore assume that the starry heaven is not merely in
 space, what no astronomer doubts, but also in time, without beginning
 or end; that it never was created, and is imperishable."
 (See <em>Czolbe</em>)<em>.**</em> 
 </p><p>
 Czolbe repeats exactly what the Occultists say. But the Aryan
 Occultists, we may be told, knew nothing of these later speculations.
 "They were even ignorant of the globular form of our earth."

 Bible, may some day be shown to be founded on fact. In nature,
 the logic of analogy alone ought to make us accept these <em>traditions
 </em>as scientific verities.

 (Coleman.) To this the Vishnu Purana contains a reply, which has
 forced certain Orientalists to open their eyes very widely.
 </p><p>
 . . . "The Sun is stationed, for all time, in the middle
 of the day, and over against midnight, in all the <em>Dwipas </em>(continents),
 Maitreya! But the rising and the setting of the <em>Sun </em>being
 perpetually <em>opposite to each other -- </em>and<em> </em>in
 the same way, all the cardinal points, and so the cross-points,
 Maitreya; people speak of the rising of the Sun where they see
 it; and where the Sun disappears, there, to them, is his setting.
 Of the Sun, which is always in <em>one and the same place, </em>there
 is neither setting nor rising, for what is called rising and <em>setting
 </em>are only the seeing and the <em>not </em>seeing the Sun."
 (<em>Vishnu Purana, Book IL, ch. viii.</em>)
 </p><p>
 To this Fitzedward Hall remarks, "The Heliocentricism taught
 in this passage is remarkable. It is contradicted, however, a
 little further on." Contradicted <em>purposely, </em>because
 it was a secret temple-teaching. Martin Haug remarked the same
 teaching in another passage. It is useless to calumniate the Aryans
 any longer.
 </p><p>
 To return to the Chronology of the geologists and anthropologists.
 We are afraid Science has no reasonable grounds on which she could
 oppose the views of the Occultists in this direction. Except that
 "of man, the highest organic being of creation, not a trace
 was found in the primary strata; only in the uppermost, the so-called
 alluvial layer," is all that can be urged, so far. That man
 was <em>not the last member in the mammalian family, </em>but
 the first in <em>this Round, </em>is something that science will
 be forced to acknowledge one day. A similar view also has already
 been mooted in France on very high authority.
 </p><p>
 That man can be shown to have lived in the mid-Tertiary period,
 and in a geological age <em>when there did not yet exist one single
 specimen of the now known species of mammals, </em>is a statement
 that science <em>cannot </em>deny and which has now been proven
 by de Quatrefages.* But even supposing his existence in the Eocene
 period is not yet demonstrated, what period of time has elapsed
 since the Cretaceous period? We are aware of the fact that only
 the boldest geologists dare to place man further back than the
 Miocene age. But how long, we ask, is the duration of those ages
 and periods since the Mesozoic time? On this, after a good deal
 of speculation and wrangling, science is silent, the greatest
 authorities upon the subject being compelled to answer to the
 question: "We do not know." This ought to show that
 the men of science are no greater authorities in this matter than
 are the profane. If, according to Prof. Huxley, "the time
 represented by the coal formation would be six millions of years,**
 how many more millions would be required to cover

 the time from the Jurassic period, or the middle of the so-called

 The writer is well aware that those specialists, whose computations
 of the ages of the globe and man are the most liberal, always
 had the shyer majority against them. But this proves very little,
 since the majority rarely, if ever, turns out to be right in the
 long run. Harvey stood alone for many years. The advocates for
 crossing the Atlantic with steamers were in danger of ending their
 days in a lunatic asylum. Mesmer is classed to this day (in the
 Encyclopaedias) along with Cagliostro, and St. Germain, as a charlatan
 and impostor. And now that Messrs. Charcot and Richet have vindicated
 Mesmer's claims, and that "Mesmerism" under its new
 name of Hypnotism -- a false nose on a very old face -- is accepted
 by science, it does not strengthen one's respect for that majority,
 when one sees the ease and unconcern with which its members treat
 of "Hypnotism," "Telepathic Impacts," and
 its other phenomena. They speak of it, in short, as if they had
 believed in it since the days of Solomon, and had never called
 its votaries, only a few years ago, "lunatics and impostors!"**
 </p><p>
 The same revulsion of thought is in store for the long period
 of years, claimed by esoteric philosophy as the age of sexual
 and physiological mankind. Therefore even the Stanza which says:
 --
 </p><p>
 "The mind-born, the boneless, gave being to the will-born
 with bones"; adding that this took place in the middle of
 the <em>Third </em>Race 18,000,000 years ago -- has yet a chance
 of being accepted by future scientists.

 As far as <b>XIX</b>th century thought is concerned, we shall
 be told, even by some personal friends who are imbued with an
 abnormal respect for the shifting conclusions of science, that
 such a statement is absurd. How much more improbable will appear
 our further assertion, to the effect that the antiquity of the

 Races with <em>certainty </em>to either the early Secondary, or
 the Primary ages of geology, one thing is clear: that the figures
 18,000,000 of years, which embrace the duration of <em>sexual,
 physical, </em>man, have to be enormously increased if the whole
 process of spiritual, astral and physical development is taken
 into account. Many geologists, indeed, consider that the duration
 of the Quaternary and Tertiary Ages demands the concession of
 such an estimate; and it is quite certain that no terrestrial
 conditions whatever negative the hypothesis of an Eocene Man,
 if evidence for his reality is forthcoming. Occultists, who maintain
 that the above date carries us far back into the secondary or
 "Reptilian" age, may refer to M. de Quatrefages in support
 of the possible existence of man in that remote antiquity. But
 with regard to the earliest Root-Races the case is very different.
 If the thick agglomeration of vapours, charged with carbonic acid,
 that escaped from the soil or was held in suspension in the atmosphere
 since the commencement of sedimentation, offered a fatal obstacle
 to the life of human organisms as now known, how, it will be asked,
 could the primeval men have existed? This consideration is, in
 reality, out of court. Such terrestrial conditions as were then
 operative had no touch with the plane on which the evolution of
 the <em>ethereal astral </em>races proceeded. Only in relatively
 recent geological periods, has the spiral course of cyclic law
 swept mankind into the lowest grade of physical evolution -- the
 plane of gross material causation. In those early ages, <em>astral
 </em>evolution was alone in progress, and the two planes, the
 astral and the physical,* though developing on parallel lines,
 had no direct point of contact with one another. It is obvious
 that a shadow-like <em>ethereal </em>man is related by virtue
 of his organization -- if such it can be called -- only to that
 plane from which the substance of his <em>Upadhi </em>is derived.

 There are things, perhaps, that may have escaped the <em>far-seeing
 -- </em>but not <em>all-seeing -- </em>eyes of our modern naturalists;
 yet it is Nature herself who undertakes to furnish the missing
 links. Agnostic speculative thinkers have to choose between the
 version given by the Secret Doctrine of the East, and the hopelessly
 materialistic Darwinian and Biblical accounts of the origin of
 man; between no soul and no spiritual evolution, and the Occult
 doctrine which repudiates "Special creation" and the
 "Evolutionist" Anthropogenesis equally.
 </p><p>
 Again, to take up the question of "Spontaneous generation";
 life -- as science shows -- has not always reigned on this terrestrial
 plane.

 * It must be noted that, though the astral and physical planes
 of matter ran parallel with one another even in the earliest geological
 ages, yet they were not in the same phases of manifestation in
 which they are <em>now.</em> The Earth did not reach its present
 <em>grade of density </em>till 18,000,000 years ago. Since then
 <em>both</em> the physical and astral planes have become grosser.

 There was a time when even the Haeckelian Moneron -- that simple
 globule of Protoplasm -- had not yet appeared at the bottom of
 the seas. Whence came the <em>Impulse </em>which caused the molecules
 of Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, etc., to group themselves into the
 <em>Urschleim </em>of Oken, that organic "slime," now
 christened protoplasm. What were the prototypes of the Monera?
 They, at least, could not have fallen in meteorites from other
 globes already formed, Sir W. Thomson's wild theory to this effect,
 notwithstanding. And if <em>they have </em>so fallen; if our Earth
 got its supply of life-germs from other planets; who, or <em>what,
 </em>had carried them into those planets? Here, again, unless
 the Occult teaching is accepted, we are compelled once more to
 face a <em>miracle; </em>to accept the theory of a <em>personal,
 anthropomorphic Creator, </em>the attributes and definitions of
 whom, as formulated by the Monotheists, clash as much with philosophy
 and logic, as they degrade the ideal of an infinite Universal
 deity, before whose incomprehensible awful grandeur the highest
 human intellect feels dwarfed. Let not the modern philosopher,
 while arbitrarily placing himself on the highest pinnacle of human
 intellectuality hitherto evolved, show himself spiritually and
 intuitionally so far below the conceptions of even the ancient
 Greeks, themselves on a far lower level, in these respects, than
 the philosophers of Eastern Aryan antiquity. Hylozoism, when philosophically
 understood, is the highest aspect of Pantheism. It is the only
 possible escape from idiotic atheism based on lethal materiality,
 and the still more idiotic anthropomorphic conceptions of the
 monotheists; between which two it stands on its own entirely neutral
 ground. Hylozoism <em>demands </em>absolute Divine Thought, which
 would <em>pervade </em>the numberless active, creating Forces,
 or "Creators"; which <em>entities </em>are moved by,
 and have their being in, from, and through that Divine Thought;
 the latter, nevertheless, having no more personal concern in them
 or <em>their </em>creations, than the Sun has in the sun-flower
 and its seeds, or in vegetation in general. Such active "Creators"
 are known to exist and are believed in, because perceived and
 sensed by the <em>inner </em>man in the Occultist. Thus the latter
 says that an ABSOLUTE Deity, having to be unconditioned and unrelated,
 cannot be thought of at the same time as an active, creating,
 one living god, without immediate degradation of the ideal.* A
 Deity that manifests in <em>Space </em>and <em>Time -</em>- these
 two being simply the forms of THAT which is the Absolute ALL --
 can be but a fractional part of the

 * The conception and definition of the <em>Absolute </em>by Cardinal
 Cusa may satisfy only the Western mind, prisoned, so unconsciously
 to itself, and entirely degenerated by long centuries of scholastic
 and theological sophistry. But this "Recent philosophy of
 the Absolute," traced by Sir W. Hamilton to Cusa, would never
 satisfy the more acutely metaphysical mind of the Hindu Vedantin.

 <p>
 whole. And since that "all" cannot be divided in its
 absoluteness, therefore that <em>sensed </em>creator (we say <em>Creators</em>)<em>
 </em>can be at best but the mere <em>aspect </em>thereof. To use
 the same metaphor -- inadequate to express the full idea, yet
 well adapted to the case in hand -- these creators are like the
 numerous rays of the solar orb, which remains unconscious of,
 and unconcerned in, the work; while its mediating agents, the
 rays, become the instrumental media every spring -- the Manvantaric
 dawn of the Earth -- in fructifying and awakening the dormant
 vitality inherent in Nature and its differentiated matter. This
 was so well understood in antiquity, that even the moderately
 religious Aristotle remarked that such work of direct creation
 would be quite <em>unbecoming </em>to God -- [[<em>aprepes toi
 theo</em>]]. Plato and other philosophers taught the same: deity
 cannot set its own hand to creation, -- [[<em>autournein hapanta</em>]].
 This Cudworth calls "Hylozoism." As old Zeno is credited
 by Laertius with having said, "Nature is a habit moved from
 itself, according to seminal principles; perfecting and containing
 those several things which in determinate times are produced from
 it, and acting agreeably to that from which it was secreted."*

 Let us return to our subject, pausing to think over it. Indeed,
 if there was vegetable life during those periods that could feed
 on the then deleterious elements; and if there was even animal
 life whose aquatic organization could be developed, notwithstanding
 the supposed scarcity of Oxygen, why could there not be human
 life also, in its incipient physical form,<em> i.e</em>., in a
 race of beings adapted for that geological period and its surroundings?
 Besides, science confesses that it knows nothing of the real length
 of "geological periods."
 </p><p>
 But the chief question before us is, whether it is quite certain
 that, from the time of that which is called the "Azoic"
 age, there ever was such an atmosphere as that hypothesised by
 the Naturalists. Not all the physicists agree with this idea.
 Were the writer anxious to corroborate the teachings of the Secret
 Doctrine by exact science, it would be easy to show, on the admission
 of more than one physicist, that the atmosphere has changed little,
 if at all, since the first condensation of the oceans -- <em>i.e.,
 </em>since the Laurentian period, the <em>Pyrolithic </em>age.
 Such, at any rate, is the opinion of Blanchard, S. Meunier, and
 even of Bischof -- as the experiments of the latter scientist
 with basalts have shown. For were we to take the word of the majority
 of scientists as to the quantity of deadly gases, and of elements
 entirely saturated with carbon and nitrogen, in which the vegetable
 and animal kingdoms are shown to have lived, thriven, and developed,
 then one would have to come to the curious conclusion that there
 were, in those days, oceans

 of<em> liquid carbonic acid, </em>instead of water. With such
 an element, it becomes doubtful whether the Ganoids, or even the
 Primitive Trilobites themselves could live in the oceans of the
 primary age -- let alone in those of the Silurian, as shown by
 Blanchard.

 The conditions that were necessary for the earliest race of mankind,
 however, require no elements, whether simple or compound. That
 which was stated at the beginning is maintained. The spiritual
 ethereal Entity which lived in Spaces unknown to Earth, before
 the first sidereal "jelly-speck" evolved in the ocean
 of crude Cosmic Matter, -- billions and trillions of years before
 our globular speck in infinity, called Earth, came into being
 and generated the <em>Moneron </em>in its drops, called Oceans
 -- needed no "elements." The "Manu with soft bones"
 could well dispense with calcic phosphate, as he had no bones,
 save in a figurative sense. And while even the Monera, however
 homogeneous their organism, still required physical conditions
 of life that would help them toward further evolution, the being
 which became primitive Man and the "Father of man,"
 after evolving on planes of existence undreamt of by science,
 could well remain impervious to any state of atmospheric conditions
 around him. The primitive ancestor, in Brasseur de Bourbourg's
 "<em>Popul-Vuh,</em>"<em> </em>who -- in the Mexican
 legends -- could act and live with equal ease under ground and
 water as upon the Earth, answers only to the Second and early
 Third Races in our texts. And if the three kingdoms of Nature
 were so different in <em>pre</em>-diluvian ages, why should not
 man have been composed of materials and combinations of atoms
 now entirely unknown to physical science? The plants and animals
 now known, in almost numberless varieties and species, have all
 developed, according to scientific hypotheses, from primitive
 and far fewer organic forms. Why should not the same have occurred
 in the case of man, the elements, and the rest? "Universal
 Genesis starts from the one, breaks into three, then five, and
 finally culminates into seven, to return into four, three, and
 one." (Commentary.)
