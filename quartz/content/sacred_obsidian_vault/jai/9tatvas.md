                     Nine Tattvas (Principles)
                     ==========================

      The nine tattvas, or principles, are the single most important
      subject of Jain philosophy.  It deals with the karma theory of
      Jainism, which provides the basis for the path of liberation.
      Without the proper knowledge of this subject, a person can not
      progress spiritually.  The true faith and understanding of this
      subject brings about right faith (samyak-darshana), right
      knowledge (samyak-jnana), and right conduct in an individual.


      Nine Tattvas (Principles):
      --------------------------
            1. Jiva    - soul or living being (Consciousness)
            2. Ajiva   - non-living substances
            3. Asrava  - cause of the influx of karma
            4. Bandh   - bondage of karma
            5.*Punya   - virtue
            6.*Papa    - sin
            7. Samvara - arrest of the influx of karma
            8. Nirjara - exhaustion of the accumulated karma
            9. Moksha  - total liberation from karma

      * Punya and Papa are the diverse results of Asrava and Bandh.  Some
        exponents of Jains do not treat them as separate tattvas.
        According to them, there are only seven principles instead of
        nine.

      1.  Jiva (soul) Substance:
      --------------------------
        Explained in The Six Universal Substances chapter.

      2.  Ajiva (Non-living) Substances:
      ----------------------------------
        Explained in The Six Universal Substances chapter.


      3.  Asrava (Cause of the influx of karma) -
      -----------------------------------------
         Asrava is the cause which leads to the influx of good and evil
         karma which lead to the bondage of the soul.

         Asrava may be described as attraction in the soul toward sense
         objects.

         The following are causes of influx of good and evil karma:

            Mithyatva - ignorance
            Avirati   - lack of self restraint
            Kasaya    - passions like anger, conceit, deceit, and lust
            Pramada   - unawareness or unmindfulness
            Yoga      - activities of mind, speech, and body

         In addition to the above causes, the five great sins; violence,
         untruth, stealing, sensual indulgence, and attachment to worldly
         objects are also the cause of the influx of karmas.


      4.  Bandha (Bondage of karma)-
      -----------------------------
      Bandha is the attachment of karmic matter (karma pudgala) to the
      soul.  The soul has had this karmic matter bondage from eternity.
      This karmic body is known as the karmana body or causal body.

      Karmic matter is a particular type of matter which is attracted to
      the soul because of its ignorance, lack of self restraint,
      passions, unmindfulness, activities of body, mind, and speech.

      The soul, which is covered by karmic matter, continues acquiring
      new karma from the universe and exhausting old karma into the
      universe through the above mentioned actions at every moment.

      Because of this continual process of acquiring and exhausting karma
      particles, the soul has to pass through the cycles of births and
      deaths, and experiencing pleasure and pain.  So under normal
      circumstances the soul can not attain freedom from karma, and hence
      liberation.

      Karmic matter attaching to the soul assumes four forms:

              Prakriti  bandha - Type of karma
              Sthiti    bandha - Duration of karma
              Anubhava  bandha - Intensity of attachment of karma
              Pradesa   bandha - Quantity of karma


      Prakriti Bandha:
      ----------------
      When karmic matter attaches to the soul, karma will obscure its
      essential nature of:
            perfect knowledge, vision, bliss, power, eternal existence,
            non-corporeal, and equanimity.

      Prakriti bandha is classified into eight categories, according to
      the particular attribute of the soul that it obscures.

         Jnana-varaniya
            It covers the soul's power of perfect knowledge.

         Darasna-varaniya
            It covers the soul's power of perfect visions.

         Vedniya
            It obscures the blissful nature of the soul, and thereby
            produces pleasure and pain.

         Mohniya
            It generates delusion in the soul in regard to its own true
            nature, and makes it identify itself with other substances.

         Ayu
            It determines the span of life in one birth, thus obscuring
            its nature of eternal existence.

         Nama
            It obscures the non-corporeal existence of the soul, and
            produces the body with its limitations, qualities, faculties,
            etc.

         Gotra
            It obscures the souls characteristics of equanimity, and
            determines the caste, family, social standing, etc.

         Antaraya
            It obstructs the natural energy of the soul and prevents it
            from attaining liberation.  It also prevents a living being
            from doing something good and enjoyable.


         Ghati and Aghati karmas:
         ------------------------
            The above eight karmas are also categorized into two groups,
            known as ghati and aghati karmas.


         Ghati Karmas
            Jnana-varaniya, Darasna-varaniya, Mohaniya, and Antaraya
            karmas are called Ghati karmas (dangerous karmas) because
            they obscure the true nature of the soul.

         Aghati Karmas
            Ayu, Nama, Gotra, and Vedniya karmas are called Aghati
            karmas.  They do not obscure the original nature of
            the soul.  However, they associate with the body of the
            soul. Hence they can not destroyed by the soul so long as
            it possesses a body.

         When a person destroys all of his ghati karmas, at that time he
         attains keval-jnana.  However, he continues to live as a human
         being because none of his aghati karmas are destroyed.  He can
         only attain liberation after all of his aghati karmas are
         destroyed.  Hence he attains liberation after his death.

         When a person attains keval-jnana, he is known as an Arihant.
         If an  Arihant establishes the four fold order of Monks, Nuns,
         Sravaka, (male layperson), and Sravika (female layperson) then
         the Arihant is called a Tirthankara.  Other Arihantas are known
         as ordinary Kevali.  After Nirvana (death) both Tirthankaras and
         ordinary Kevalis are called Siddhas.

         All Siddhas are unique individuals, but they all possess perfect
         knowledge, vision, power, and bliss.  Hence from the qualities
         and attributes point of view all Siddhas are same.


         Sthiti Bandha
         --------------
         When karmic matter attaches to the soul the duration of the
         attachment is determined at that time according to the intensity
         or dullness of the soul's passions.


         Anubhava Bandha or Rasa Bandha
         ------------------------------
         What fruits the karmic matter will produce is determined at the
         time of attachment by varying degrees of passions.


         Pradesa Bandha
         --------------
         The quantum of karmic matter that is drawn towards the soul for
         attachment is determined by the intensity or dullness of the
         soul's action.


      5.  Punya (Virtue)
      ------------------
         The influx of karmic matter due to good activities of the mind,
         body, and speech with the potential of producing pleasant
         sensations is called punya or virtue.

         Activities such as offering food, drink, shelter, purifying
         thought, physical and mental happiness, etc.  result in
         producing punya karmic matter.



      6.  PAPA (Sin)
      --------------
         The influx of karmic matter due to evil activities of the mind,
         body, and speech with the potential of producing unpleasant
         sensations is called papa or sin.

         Activities such as violence, untruth, theft, unchastity,
         attachment to objects, anger, conceit, deceit, lust, etc.
         result in producing papa karmic matter.



      7.  Samvara (Arrest of Karma)
      -----------------------------
         The method which arrests fresh karma from coming into the soul
         is samvara. This process is a reverse of asrava.

            It can be accomplished by constant practice of:
              - restraint of mind, body, and speech
              - religious meditation
              - conquest of desire
              - forgiveness, tenderness, purity, truth, austerity,
                renunciation, unattachment, and chastity


      8.  Nirjara -
      -------------
         Nirjara is the exhaustion of karmic matter already acquired.

         - The karmas exhaust themselves by producing their results when
           it is time for them to do so.

         - Unless they are exhausted before they are mature and
           start producing results, it becomes difficult to be free.
           By that time, new karmic matter begins to pour in.

         - Therefore, it becomes necessary for one who desires final
           liberation to exhaust all karmas before maturity.  This is
           called nirjara.

         Nirjara is to be done by rigorous austerities.

         External Nirjara:
         -----------------
           Anasan       - complete abstinence of eating and drinking

           Alpahara     - reduction in the quantity of food one
                          normally eats

           Ichhanirodha - control of desire for food and material things

           Rasatyaga    - complete abstinence of eating or drinking juicy
                          and tasty foods such as honey, alcohol,
                          butter, milk, tea, sweets, juice etc.
                          (no attachments to the taste of the foods)

           Kayaklesa    - control of passions by discipline

           Samlinata    - sitting in a lonely place in due posture
                          with senses withdrawn

         Internal Nirjara:
         -----------------
           Prayaschita - repentance for the breach of vows

           Vinaya      - appropriate behavior towards a teacher

           Vaiyavrata  - selfless service to the suffering and
                         deserving

           Svadhyaya   - studying/listening of religious scriptures

           Bhutsarga   - non-attachment to the body

           Subha-dhyana - religious meditation


      9.  Moksha -
      -----------
         Moksha is the liberation of the living being (soul) after
         complete exhaustion or elimination of all karmas.

         A liberated soul regains totally its original attributes of
         perfect knowledge, vision, power, and bliss.  It climbs to the
         top of Lokakas and remains there forever in its blissful and
         unconditional existence.

         It never returns again into the cycles of birth, life, and death.

         This state of the soul is the liberated or perfect state, and
         this is called "Nirvana."
