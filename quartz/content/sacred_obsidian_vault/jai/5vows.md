                     Five Great Vows (Maha-vratas)
                     -----------------------------
      Right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct are the three
      most essentials for attaining liberation.

      In order to acquire these, one must observe the five great vows:

            1. Non-violence                      -  Ahimsa
            2. Truth                             -  Satya
            3. Non-stealing                      -  Achaurya or Asteya
            4. Celibacy/Chastity                 -  Brahmacharya
            5. Non-attachment/Non-possession     -  Aparigraha


      Non-violence (Ahimsa):
      ---------------------
      Among these five vows, non-violence (Ahimsa) is the cardinal
      principle of Jainism and hence it is called the highest religious
      principle, or the cornerstone of Jainism.

         Non-violence is the supreme religion (Ahimsa parmo dharma)

      It is repeatedly said by all Tirthankaras in Jain literature,

         "Do not injure, abuse, oppress, enslave, insult, torment,
          torture, or kill any creature or living being."

      According to Jainism all living beings, irrespective of their
      size, shape, or different spiritual developments are equal.  No
      living being has a right to harm, injure, or kill any other living
      being, including animals, insects, and plants.  Every living being has
      a right to exist and it is necessary to live with every other living
      being in perfect harmony and peace.

      Nonviolence is based on love and kindness for all living beings.
      Nonviolence in Jainism is not a negative virtue.  It is based upon
      the positive quality of universal love and compassion.  One who is
      actuated by this ideal cannot be indifferent to the suffering of
      others.

      Violence of every type should be completely forbidden.  Mental
      tortures by way of harsh words, actions, and any type of bodily
      injuries should also be avoided.  Even thinking evil of some one is
      considered violence in Jainism.

      Practically, it is impossible to survive without killing or injuring
      some of the smallest living beings.  Some lives are killed even
      when we breathe, drink water, or eat food.  Therefore, Jainism
      says that minimum killing of the lowest form of life should be our
      ideal for survival.

      In the universe, there are different forms of life, such as,
      human beings, animals, insects, plants, bacteria, and
      even smaller lives which cannot be seen even through the most
      powerful microscopes.  Jainism has classified all the living
      beings according to their senses as follows:

          five senses  - human, animals, birds, heavenly, hellish beings
          four senses  - flies, bees, etc.
          three senses - ants, lice, etc.
          two senses   - worms, leaches, etc.
          one sense    - vegetables, water, air, earth, fire etc.

      The five sense are, touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing.

      It is more painful if a life of the higher forms (more than one sense)
      are killed.  All non-vegetarian food is made by killing a living
      being with two or more senses.  Therefore, Jainism preaches strict
      vegetarianism, and prohibits non-vegetarian foods.

      Jainism explains that violence is not defined by actual harm, for
      this may be unintentional.  It is the intention to harm, the
      absence of compassion, and the ignorance that makes an action
      violent.  Without violent thought there can be no violent actions.

      Non-violence is to be observed in action, speech, and thought.
      One should not be violent, ask others to do so, or approve of such
      an activity.


      Truth (Satya):
      ---------------
      Anger, greed, fear, jokes, etc.  are the breeding grounds of
      untruth.  To speak the truth requires moral courage.  Only those
      who have conquered greed, fear, anger, jealousy, ego, frivolity,
      etc., can speak the truth.  Jainism insists that one should not
      only refrain from falsehood, but should always speak the truth
      which should be wholesome and pleasant.

      One should remain silent if the truth causes pain, hurt, anger, or
      death of any living being.

      Truth is to be observed in speech, mind, and deed.  One should not
      utter an untruth, ask others to do so, or approve of such
      activities.


      Non-stealing (Achaurya or Asteya):
      ----------------------------------
      Stealing consists of taking another's property without his consent,
      or by unjust or immoral methods.  Further, one should not take
      anything which does not belong to him.  It does not entitle one to
      take away a thing which may be lying unattended or unclaimed.  One
      should observe this vow very strictly, and should not touch even a
      worthless thing which does not belong to him.

      When accepting alms, help, or aid one should not take more then
      what is minimum needed.  To take more than one's need is also
      considered theft in Jainism.

      The vow of non-stealing insists that one should be totally honest
      in action, thought, and speech.  One should not steal, ask others
      to do so, or approve of such activities.


      Celibacy / Chastity (Brahmacharya):
      -----------------------------------
      Total abstinence from sensual pleasure is called celibacy.  Sensual
      pleasure is an infatuating force which sets aside all virtues and
      reason at the time of indulgence.  This vow of controlling sensuality
      is very difficult to observe in its subtle form.  One may refrain
      from physical indulgence but may still think of the pleasures of
      sensualism, which is prohibited in Jainism.

      Monks are required to observe this vow strictly and completely.
      They should not enjoy sensual pleasures, ask others to do the
      same, nor approve of it.  There are several rules laid down for
      observing this vow for householders.


      Non-attachment / Non-possession (Aparigraha):
      ---------------------------------------------
      Jainism believes that the more worldly wealth a person possesses,
      the more he is likely to commit sin to acquire the possession, and
      in a long run he may be more unhappy.  The worldly wealth creates
      attachments which will continuously result in greed, jealousy,
      selfishness, ego, hatred, violence, etc.  Lord Mahavir has said
      that wants and desires have no end, and only the sky is the limit
      for them.

      Attachments to worldly objects results in the bondage to the
      cycle of birth and death.  Therefore, one who desires of spiritual
      liberation should withdraw from all attachments to pleasing
      objects of all the five senses.

      Monks observe this vow by giving up attachments to all things such
      as:

         Material things:
           Wealth, property, grains, house, books, clothes, etc.

         Relationships:
           Father, mother, spouse, sons, daughters, friends, enemies,
           other monks, disciples, etc.

         Feelings:
            Pleasure and painful feelings towards touch, taste, smell,
            sight, and hearing objects.  They have the equanimity towards
            music and noise, good and bad smells, soft and hard objects
            for touch, beautiful and dirty sights, etc.

            They do not eat food for taste but for survival with the
            intention to destroy his karma with the help of this body.

      Non-possession and non-attachment are to be observed in speech,
      mind, and deed.  One should not possess, ask others to do so, or
      approve of such activities.

      Jainism has laid down and described in much detail these five
      great vows for the path of liberation.  These are to be observed
      strictly and entirely by the monks and nuns.  Partial observance
      is laid down for the householders with an additional seven vows.
