                          Twelve Vows Of Layperson
                          -------------------------
      The five great vows (Maha-vratas) can be adopted by monks who are
      very keen about the uplift of their souls and ready to sacrifice
      all worldly enjoyments and family ties.

      For those who want to remain in family life and for whom complete
      avoidance of five principle sins are difficult, Jain ethics
      specifies the following twelve vows to be carried out by the
      householder.

      Of this twelve vows, the first five are main vows of limited nature
      (Anuvratas).  They are somewhat easier in comparison with great vows
      (Maha-vratas).  The great vows are  for the monks.

      The next three vows are known as merit vows (Guna-vratas), so called
      because they enhance and purify the effect of the five main vows
      and raise their value manifold.  It also governs the external
      conduct of an individual.

      The last four are called disciplinary vows (Shikhsa-vratas).  They
      are intended to encourage the person in the performance of their
      religious duties.  They reflect the purity of one's heart.  They
      govern one's internal life and are expressed in a life that is
      marked by charity.  They are preparatory to the discipline of an
      ascetic's life.

      Three merit vows (Gunavrats) and four disciplinary vows
      (Shikhsa-vratas) together are known as Seven vows of virtuous conduct
      (Shilas).

      A person may adopt these vows, according to his individual capacity
      and circumstances with the intent to adopt ultimately as a great vows.

      The layperson should be very careful while observing and following
      these limited vows.  These vows being limited or restricted vows
      may still leave great scope for the commitment of sins and
      possession of property.


      The twelve vows are described as follows:

      Five Main Vows of Limited Nature (Anuvratas):
      -----------------------------------------------
             1. Non-violence Anuvrat  - Ahimsa Anuvrat
                                        (Sthula Pranatipat Viraman)
             2. Truthfulness Anuvrat  - Satya Anuvrat
                                        (Sthula Mrisavada Viraman)
             3. Non-stealing Anuvrat  - Achaurya Anuvrat
                                        (Sthula Adattadana Viraman)
             4. Chastity  Anuvrat     - Bhramacharya Anuvrat
                                        (Sthula Maithuna Viraman)
             5. Non-attachment Anuvrat- Aparigraha Anuvrat
                                        (Sthula Parigraha Viraman)

      Three Merit Vows (Guna-vrats):
      ------------------------------
             6. Dik Vrata            - Limited area of activity vow
             7. Bhoga-Upbhoga Vrata  - Limited use of consumable and
                                       non-consumable items vow
             8. Anartha-danda Vrata  - Avoidance of purposeless sins vow


      Four Disciplinary Vows (Siksha-vratas):
      ---------------------------------------
             9. Samayik Vrata          - Meditation vow of limited
                                          duration
            10. Desavakasika Vrata      - Activity vow of limiting space
            11. Pausadha Vrata          - Ascetic's life Vow of limited
                                          duration
            12. Atithi Samvibhaga Vrata - Limited charity vow


      1. Non-violence Anuvrat (Ahimsa Anuvrat):
      -----------------------------------------
      In this vow, a person must not intentionally hurt any living being
      (plants,animals,humans etc.)  or their feeling either by thought,
      word or deed, himself, or through others, or by approving such an
      act committed by somebody else.

      Intention in this case applies selfish motive, sheer pleasure and
      even avoidable negligence.

      He may use force, if necessary, in the defense of his country,
      society, family, life, property, religious institute.

      His agricultural, industrial, occupational living activities do
      also involve injury to life, but it should be as minimum as
      possible, through carefulness and due precaution.

      Four stages of violence are described:

        Premeditated Violence
             to attack someone knowingly
        Defensive Violence
             to commit intentional violence in defense of one's own life
        Vocational Violence
             to incur violence in the execution of one's means of
             livelihood
        Common Violence
             to commit violence in the performance of daily activities

      Premeditated violence is prohibited for all.  A householder is
      permitted to incur violence defensively and vocationally provided
      he maintains complete detachment.  Common violence is accepted for
      survival, but even here, one should be careful in preparing food,
      cleaning house, etc.  This explains the Jain's practices of
      filtering drinking water, vegetarianism, not eating meals at night,
      and abstinence from alcohol.

      Nonviolence is the foundation of Jain ethics.  Lord Mahavir says:
      `one should not injure, subjugate, enslave, torture or kill any
      living being including animals, insects, plants, and vegetables.'
      This is the essence of religion.  It embraces the welfare of all
      animals.  It is the basis of all stages of knowledge and the source
      of all rules of conduct.  The scriptures analyze the spiritual and
      practical aspects of nonviolence and discuss the subject negatively
      and positively.


      2. Truthfulness Anuvrat (Satya Anuvrat):
      ----------------------------------------

      The second of the five limited vows is Truth.  It is more than
      abstaining from falsehood. It is seeing the world in its real
      form and adapting to that reality.  The vow of truth puts a
      person in touch with his inner strength and inner capacities.

      In this vow, a person avoids lies, such as giving false evidence,
      denying the property of others entrusted to him, avoid cheating
      others etc.  The vow is to be followed in thought, action, and
      speech, and by doing it himself or by getting it done through
      others.

      He should not speak the truth, if it harms others or hurts their
      feelings.  He should, under these circumstances, keep silence.


      3. Non-stealing (Achaurya / Asteya) Anuvrat:
      --------------------------------------------
      In this vow, a person must not steal, rob, or misappropriate others
      goods and property.  He also must not cheat and use illegal means
      in acquiring worldly things, nor through others or by approving
      such an act committed by others.


      4. Chastity (Bhramacharya) Anuvrat:
      ------------------------------------
      The basic intent of this vow is to conquer passion and to prevent
      the waste of energy.  Positively stated, the vow is meant to impart
      the sense of serenity to the soul.

      In this vow, the house holder must not have a sensual relationship
      with anybody but one's own lawfully wedded spouse.  Even with one's
      own spouse, excessive indulgence of all kinds of sensual pleasure
      need be avoided.


      5. Non-possession / Non-attachment (Aparigraha) Anuvrat:
      ---------------------------------------------------------
      Non-possession is the fifth limited vow.  As long as a person does
      not know the richness of joy and peace that comes from within, he
      tries to fill his empty and insecure existence with the clutter of
      material acquisitions.

      Lord Mahavir said, security born of material things is a delusion.
      To remove this delusion, one takes the vow of non-possession and
      realizes the perfection of the soul.

      One must impose a limit on one's needs, acquisitions, and
      possessions such as land, real estate, goods, other valuables,
      animals, money, etc.  The surplus should be used for the
      common good.  One must also limit the every day usage of number of
      food items, or articles and their quantity.

      This Jain principle of limited possession for householders helps in
      equitable distribution of wealth, comforts, etc., in the society.
      Thus Jainism helps in establishing socialism, economic stability, and
      welfare in the world.

      Non-possession, like non-violence, affirms the oneness of all life
      and is beneficial to an individual in his spiritual growth and to
      the society for the redistribution of wealth.


      6. Dik Vrata  - Limited Area of Activity Vow
      ---------------------------------------------
      This vow limits one's worldly activities to certain area in all the
      ten directions; north, south, east, west, north-east, north-west,
      south-east, south-west, above and below.  He gives up committing
      sins in any place outside the limited areas.  This vow provides a
      space limit to the commitments of sins not restricted by the
      limited vows of non-violence.  Thus outside the limited area, the
      limited vows assumes the status of full vow (Maha-vratas).


      7. Bhoga-Upbhoga Vrata  - Limited use of Consumable/
                                Non-consumable items vow
      ------------------------------------------------------
      Generally one commits the sin by one's use or enjoyment of
      consumable (Bhoga) and non-consumable (Upbhoga) things.

      Consumable (Bhoga) means enjoyment of an object which can only be
      used once, such as food, drink, fruits and flowers.

      Non-consumable (Upabhoga) means enjoyment of an object which can be
      used several times, such as furniture, cloths, ornaments,
      buildings etc.

      One should, therefore, limit the use of these two items in
      accordance with his own need and capacity by taking this vows.

      This vow provides the time limit to the commitments of sins not
      restricted by Aparigraha Anuvrata.


      8. Anartha-danda Vrata  - Avoidance of Purposeless Sins Vow
      -----------------------------------------------------------
      One must not commit unnecessary or purposeless sin or moral
      offense as defined below.

         Thinking, talking, or preaching evil or ill of others.

         Doing inconsiderate or useless acts such as walking on the grass
         unnecessarily.

         Manufacturing or supplying arms for attack.

         Reading or listening, improper literature, or carelessness in
         ordinary behavior.

      Thus this vow is of great practical importance.  It makes life more
      vigilant and sin-proof.


      9. Samayik Vrata - Limited Meditation Vow
      -------------------------------------------
      Meditation of the soul and its relationship with nature is known as
      Samayik.

      By giving up affection and aversion (Rag and Dvesha), observing
      equanimity in all objects, thinking evil of no one, and being at
      peace with the world, one should practice this vow of meditation
      (Samayik).

      This vow consists in sitting down at one place for at least 48
      minutes concentrating one's mind on religious activities like
      reading religious books, praying, or meditating.  This vow may be
      repeated many times in a day.  It is to be observed by mind, body,
      and speech.

      The meditation of 48 minutes makes a person realize the importance
      of a life long vow to avoid all sinful activities and is a stepping
      stone to a life of full renunciation.


      10. Desavakasika Vrata - Limited Duration of Activity Vow
      ---------------------------------------------------------
      This vow sets the new limit within the limitations already set by
      Dik Vrata and Bhoga-Upbhoga Vrata.  The general life long
      limitation of doing business in certain areas and the use of
      articles are further restricted for a particular days time of the
      week.

      This means that one shall not, during a certain period of time, do
      any activity, business, or travel beyond a certain city, street,
      house or have anything to do with the enjoyment of objects beyond
      that limit.


      11. Pausadha Vrata - Limited Ascetic's Life Vow
      ------------------------------------------------
      This vow requires to live the life of a monk for a day.  During
      this time one should retire to a secluded place, renounce all
      sinful activities, abstain in seeking pleasure from all objects of
      the senses, observe due restraint of body, speech and mind.  A
      person follows five great vows (Maha-vratas) completely during this
      time.  He passes his time in spiritual contemplation, perform
      meditation (Samayik), engage in self study, and worship Gods
      (Arihants and Siddhas).

      This vow promotes and nourishes one's religious life and provides
      training for ascetic life.


      12. Atithi Samvibhaga Vrata - Limited Charity Vow
      --------------------------------------------------
      One should give food, clothes, medicine, and other articles of its
      own possession to monks, nuns, and a pious person.  The food
      offered should be pure and with reverence.

      One should not prepare any foods specially for monks because monks
      are not allowed to have such foods.  Donating of one's own food and
      articles to monks and others, provides an inner satisfaction and
      raises one's consciousness to higher level. It also saves him from
      acquiring of more sins if he would have used the same for his
      nourishment, comfort and pleasure.


      Peaceful Death:
      ---------------
      In the final days of life, a householder observes peaceful death.

      The house-holder can attain a peaceful death (Sallekhana) if he
      truly follows the above twelve vows.  The peaceful death is
      characterized by non-attachment to the worldly objects and by a
      suppression of the passions at the time of death.  The last thought
      should be of a calm renunciation of the body, and this thought
      should ever be present long before death supervenes.



      Conclusion:
      ----------
      By performing these twelve vows, a lay follower may live a
      righteous life and advance towards a fuller and more perfect life,
      and conquer desire.

      While earning wealth, supporting family, and taking up arms to
      protect himself, his family, his country, etc.  against intruder,
      he is taught self restraint, love and enmity.

      On one hand, he is debarred from doing any harm to himself, to his
      family, to his country, or to humanity by his reckless conduct.  On
      the other hand, by giving up attachments he gradually prepares
      himself for the life of ascetics.

      If one goes deeper into the rules laid down, he will find that
      practice of limiting the number of things to be kept or enjoyed by
      himself eliminates the danger of concentration of wealth at one
      point, which will help to minimize poverty and crime in the
      society.  Thus limiting the desires of individuals, results in a
      ideal society.
