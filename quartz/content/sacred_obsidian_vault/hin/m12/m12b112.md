Let them (peacefully) enjoy those offerings made with Swaha and Swadha, and let them derive pleasure from those presents. I bow to them. <a name="fr_937"></a><a href="#fn_937"><font size="1">1</font></a> Let those Beings that are of the stature of the thumb and that dwell in all bodies, always protect and gratify me. <a name="fr_938"></a><a href="#fn_938"><font size="1">2</font></a> I always bow to those Beings who dwelling within embodied creatures make the latter cry in grief without themselves crying in grief, and who gladden them without themselves being glad. I always bow to those Rudras who dwell in rivers, in oceans, in hills and mountains, in mountain-caves, in the roots of trees, in cow-pens, in inaccessible forests, in the intersections of roads, in roads, in open squares, in banks (of rivers and lakes and oceans), in elephant-sheds, in stables, in car-sheds, in deserted gardens and houses, in the five primal elements, and in the cardinal and subsidiary directions. I bow repeatedly unto them that dwell in the space amidst the Sun and the Moon, as also in rays of the Sun and the Moon, and them that dwell in the nether regions, and them that have betaken themselves to Renunciation and other superior practices for the sake of the Supreme. <a name="fr_939"></a><a href="#fn_939"><font size="1">3</font></a> I bow always unto them that are unnumbered, that are unmeasured, and that have no form, unto those Rudras, that is, that are endued with infinite attributes. Since thou, O Rudra, art the Creator of all creatures, since, O Hara, thou art the Master of all creatures, and since thou art the indwelling Soul of all creatures, therefore wert thou not invited by me (to my Sacrifices). Since thou art He who is adored in all sacrifices with plentiful gifts, and since it is Thou that art the Creator of all things, therefore I did not invite thee. Or, perhaps, O god, stupefied by thy subtile illusion I failed to invite thee. Be gratified with me, blessed by thyself, O Bhava, with me possessed by the quality of Rajas. My Mind, my Understanding, and my Chitta all dwell in thee, O god!</p>  
 <p>"Hearing these adorations, that Lord of all creatures, <i>viz</i>., Mahadeva, ceased (to think of inflicting further injuries on Daksha). Indeed, highly gratified, the illustrious deity addressed Daksha, saying, 'O Daksha of excellent vows, pleased have I been with these adorations of thine. Thou needst not praise me more. Thou shalt attain to my companionship. Through my grace, O progenitor of creatures, thou shalt earn the fruit of a thousand horse-sacrifices, and a hundred Vajapeyas (in consequence of this one incomplete sacrifice of thine).</p>  
 <p>"Once more, Mahadeva, that thorough master of words, addressed Daksha and said unto him these words fraught with high consolation, 'Be thou the foremost of all creatures in the world. Thou shouldst not, O Daksha, entertain any feelings of grief for these injuries inflicted on thy Sacrifice. It has been</p>

 <p>seen that in former <i>Kalpas</i> too I had to destroy thy Sacrifice. <a name="fr_940"></a><a href="#fn_940"><font size="1">1</font></a> O thou of excellent vows, I shall grant thee again some more boons. Take them from me. Dispelling this cheerlessness that overspreads thy face, listen to me with undivided attention. With the aid of arguments addressed to reason the deities and the Danavas have extracted from the Vedas consisting of six branches and from the system of Sankhya and Yoga a creed in consequence of which they have practised the austerest penances for many long years. The religion, however, which I have extracted, is unparalleled, and productive of benefits on every side. It is open to men in all modes of life to practise it. It leads to Emancipation. It may be acquired in many years or through merit by persons who have restrained their senses. It is shrouded in mystery. They that are divested of wisdom regard it as censurable. It is opposed to the duties laid down in respect of the four orders of men and the four modes of life, and agrees with those duties in only a few particulars. They that are well-skilled in the science of (drawing) conclusions (from premises) can understand its propriety: and they who have transcended all the modes of life are worthy of adopting it. In days of yore, O Daksha, this auspicious religion called Pasupata had been extracted by me. The proper observance of that religion produces immense benefits. Let those benefits be thine, O highly blessed one! Cast off this fever of thy heart.' Having said these words, Mahadeva, with his spouse (Uma) and with all his attendants disappeared from the view of Daksha of immeasurable prowess. He who would recite this hymn that was first uttered by Daksha or who would listen to it when recited by another, would never meet with the smallest evil and would attain to a long life. Indeed, as Siva is the foremost of all the deities, even so is this hymn, agreeable with the <i>Srutis</i>, is the foremost of all hymns. Persons desirous of fame, kingdom, happiness, pleasure, profit, and wealth, as also those desirous of learning, should listen with feelings of devotion to the recital of this hymn. One suffering from disease, one distressed by pain, one plunged into melancholy, one afflicted by thieves or by fear, one under the displeasure of the king in respect of his charge, becomes freed from fear (by listening or reciting this hymn). By listening to or reciting this hymn, one, in even this earthly body of his, attains to equality with the spirits forming the attendants of Mahadeva. One becomes endued with energy and fame, and cleansed of all sin (through the virtue of this hymn). Neither Rakshasas, nor Pisachas, nor ghosts, nor Vinayakas, create disturbances in his house where this hymn is recited. That woman, again, who listens to this hymn with pious faith, observing the while the practices of Brahmacharya, wins worship as a goddess in the family of her sire and that of her husband. <a name="fr_941"></a><a href="#fn_941"><font size="1">2</font></a> All the acts of that person become always crowned with success who listens or recites with rapt attention to the whole of this hymn. In consequence of the recitation of this hymn all the wishes one forms in one's mind and all the wishes one clothes in words become crowned</p>

 <p>with fruition. That man obtains all objects of enjoyment and pleasure and all things that are wished for by him, who, practising self-restraint, makes according to due rites offerings unto Mahadeva, Guha, Uma, and Nandi, and after that utters their names without delay, in proper order and with devotion. Such a man, departing from this life, ascends to heaven, and has never to take birth among the intermediate animals or birds. This was said even by the puissant Vyasa, the son of Parasara.'"</p>

 <p><a name="fn_922"></a><a href="m12b112.htm#fr_922">323:3</a> <i>Chalachalah</i> is explained as exceedingly <i>chalah</i> or swift. <i>Achalah</i> is <i>nasti chalo yasmat</i>; hence <i>chaleshu</i> (<i>api</i>) <i>achalah</i> is swift amongst the swift, or swifter than the swiftest.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_925"></a><a href="m12b112.htm#fr_925">324:3</a> <i>Mili-Mili</i> is explained by the commentator differently. According to him, one connected with all things as cause is <i>Mili</i>. It is duplicated to show that Siva is always so. I prefer taking the word as meaning 'cause of causes.' 'The bearer of Danda, with, again, a bald head' is a <i>Paramahansa</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, one who has renounced the world and its ways.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_929"></a><a href="m12b112.htm#fr_929">325:1</a> The identity of Maheswara with Narayana or Krishna is here preached. In his incarnation of Krishna, Vishnu sported with the children of the cowherds of Vrinda and sportively lowed as a cow.

 <p><a name="fn_934"></a><a href="m12b112.htm#fr_934">326:2</a> The commentator explains that what is meant by Mahadeva's staying 'alone' is that he is the knower, the known, and knowledge. 'On the other side of the ocean' means 'on the other side of desire and attachment, etc.' 'Overwhelming many thousands of persons' means overwhelming all creatures,' <i>i.e.</i>, transcending them by his energy and knowledge.</p>
