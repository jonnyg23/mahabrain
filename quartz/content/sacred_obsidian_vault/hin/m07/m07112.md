 <p>"Sanjaya said, 'Shooting clouds of arrows, all those warriors, accomplished in smiting, carefully, O monarch, encountered Yuyudhana. Drona struck him with seven and seventy shafts of great keenness. And Durmarshana struck him with a dozen, Duhsasana, struck him with ten shafts. And Vikarna also pierced him on the left side as also on the centre of the chest with thirty keen shafts equipped with <i>Kanka</i> feathers. And Durmukha struck him with ten shafts, and Duhsasana with eight, Chitrasena, O sire, pierced him with a couple of shafts. And Duryodhana, O king, and many other heroes, afflicted that mighty car-warrior with dense showers of shafts in that battle. Though checked on all sides by those mighty car-warriors, <i>viz</i>., thy sons, Yuyudhana of Vrishni's race pierced each of them separately with his straight shafts. Indeed, he pierced the son of Bharadwaja with three shafts, and Duhsasana with nine, and Vikarna with five and twenty, and Chitrasena with seven, and Durmarshana with a dozen, and Vivinsati with eight, and Satyavrata with nine, and Vijaya with ten shafts. And having pierced Rukmangada also that mighty car-warrior, <i>viz</i>., Satyaki, shaking his bow, speedily proceeded against thy son (Duryodhana). And Yuyudhana, in the sight of all men, deeply pierced with his arrows the king, that greatest of car-warriors in the whole world. Then commenced a battle between those two. Both shooting keen arrows and both aiming countless shafts, each of those mighty car-warriors made the other invisible in that battle. And Satyaki, pierced by the Kuru king, looked exceedingly</p>

 <p>resplendent as blood copiously ran adown his body, like a sandal tree shedding its juicy secretions. Thy son also pierced by Satwata with clouds of shafts, looked beautiful like a stake set up (at a sacrifice) decked all over with gold. Then Madhava, O king, in that battle, cut off with razor-faced arrow, smiling the while, the bow of the Kuru king. And then he pierced the bowless king with countless arrows. Pierced with arrows by that foe of great activity, the king could not brook this indication of the enemy's success. Duryodhana then, taking up another formidable bow, the back of whose staff was decked with gold, speedily pierced Satyaki with a hundred arrows. Deeply pierced by thy mighty son armed with the bow, Yuyudhana became inflamed with wrath and began to afflict thy son. Beholding the king thus afflicted, thy sons, those mighty car-warriors, shrouded Satyaki with dense showers of arrows, shot with great force. Whilst being thus shrouded by those mighty car-warriors, <i>viz</i>., thy multitude of sons, Yuyudhana pierced each of them with five arrows, and once more with seven. And soon he pierced Duryodhana with eight swift arrows and, smiling the while, cut off the latter's bow that frightened all foes. And with a few arrows he also felled the king's standard adorned with a jewelled elephant. And slaying then the four steeds of Duryodhana with four arrows, the illustrious Satyaki felled the king's charioteer with a razor-faced shaft. Meanwhile, Yuyudhana, filled with joy, pierced the mighty car-warrior, <i>viz</i>., the Kuru king, with many arrows capable of penetrating into the very vitals. Then, O king, thy son Duryodhana, while being thus struck in that battle with those excellent arrows of Sini's grandson, suddenly fled away. And the king, quickly mounted the car of Chitrasena, armed with the bow. Beholding the king thus attacked by Satyaki in battle, and reduced to the position of Soma in the firmament while seized by <i>Rahu</i>, cries of woe arose from every section of the Kuru host. Hearing that uproar, the mighty car-warrior Kritavarman quickly proceeded to that spot where the puissant Madhava. was battling. And Kritavarman proceeded, shaking his bow, and urging his steeds, and urging his charioteer with the words, '<i>Go with speed, Go with speed</i>!' Beholding Kritavarman rushing towards him like the Destroyer himself with wide-open mouth, Yuyudhana, O king, addressed his driver, saying, 'That Kritavarman, armed with arrows, is rushing in his car towards me with speed. Then, with his steeds urged to their greatest speed, and on his car duly equipped, Satyaki came upon the ruler of the Bhojas, the foremost of all bowmen. Then those two tigers among men, both inflamed with rage, and both resembling fire encountered each other like two tigers endued with great activity. Kritavarman pierced Sini's grandson with six and twenty whetted arrows of keen points, and the latter's driver with five arrows. And skilled in battle, the son of Hridika pierced, with four mighty shafts, the four excellent and well-broken steeds of Satyaki that were of the Sindhu breed. Owning a standard decked with gold, and adorned with golden mail, Kritavarman, shaking his formidable bow, whose staff was decked with gold, thus checked, Yuyudhana with shafts equipped with golden wings. Then the grandson of Sini, desirous of seeing</p>

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Dhananjaya, sped with great activity eight arrows at Kritavarman. That scorcher of foes, then, deeply pierced by that mighty foe,--that invincible warrior,--began to tremble like a hill during an earthquake. After this, Satyaki, of prowess incapable of being baffled, speedily pierced Kritavarman's four steeds with three and sixty keen arrows, and his driver also with seven. Indeed, Satyaki, then aiming another arrow of golden wings, that emitted blazing flames and resembled an angry snake, or the rod of the Destroyer himself, pierced Kritavarman. That terrible arrow, penetrating through his antagonist's effulgent armour decked with gold, entered the earth, dyed with blood. Afflicted with the shafts of Satwata, and bathed in blood in that battle, Kritavarman throwing aside his bow with arrow, fell upon his car. That lion-toothed hero of immeasurable prowess, that bull among men, afflicted by Satyaki with his arrows, fell on his knees upon the terrace of his car. Having thus resisted Kritavarman who resembled the thousand-armed Arjuna of old, or Ocean himself of immeasurable might, Satyaki proceeded onwards. Passing through Kritavarman's division bristling with swords and darts and bows, and abounding in elephants and steeds and cars, and <a href="errata.htm#73">out of</a> the ground rendered awful in consequence of the blood shed by foremost Kshatriyas numbering by hundreds, that bull among the Sinis proceeded onwards in the very sight of all the troops, like the slayer of Vritra through the <i>Asura</i> array. Meanwhile, the mighty son of Hridika, taking up another huge bow, stayed where he was, resisting Pandavas in battle.'"</p>
