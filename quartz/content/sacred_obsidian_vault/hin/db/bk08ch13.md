Next to it is the Krau<u>n</u>cha Dvîpa. It is twice as large as Kusa. The K<u>s</u>îra Sâgara (the ocean of milk) is surrounding this Dvîpa. The Krau<u>n</u>cha mountain is standing here. The name of this Dvîpa is derived from this mountain. In days gone by, the highly intelligent Kârtikeya burst this mountain by his own prowess. This Dvîpa is washed by the K<u>s</u>îra Sâgara; and Varu<u>n</u>a is its Regent. The son of Priyavrata, Ghritapri<u>st</u>ha, respected by all and whose prosperity knows no end, is the Lord of this Dvîpa. He divided this Dvîpa into the seven parts and distributed them to his sons and named the Var<u>s</u>as after the names of his sons. He made his sons the rulers of those places and he himself took the refuge of the Bhagavân Nârâya<u>n</u>a The names of the seven Var<u>s</u>as are respectively :-- Âma, Madhuruha, Meghapri<u>st</u>ha, Sudhâmaka, Bhrâji<u>st</u>ha, Lohitâr<u>n</u>a, and Vanaspati. O Nârada! The seven mountains and the rivers there are very celebrated throughout the worlds. The names of the mountains are :-- Sûkla, Vardhamâna, Bhojana, Upavarha<u>n</u>a, Nanda, Nandana, and Sarvatobhadra. The names of the rivers are :-- Abhayâ, Amritaughâ, Âryakâ, Tîrthavatî, Vrittirûpavatî, Suklâ, and Pavitravatikâ. The inhabitants there drink</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">the highly pure water of these rivers. The people there are divided into four colours Puru<u>s</u>a, Ri<u>s</u>abha, Dravi<u>n</u>a, and Vedaka and they worship the Bhagavân Varu<u>n</u>a, of the form of water. Then they become very discriminative, and, with great devotion, and holding full within their folded palms the water, repeat the following mantra :-- O Water! Thou art the essence Vîrya of the Person Bhagavâna and Thou sanctifiest the Bhûrloka, Bhuvarloka, and Svarloka. Thou destroyest the sins of all. We all are touching it; purify our bodies. After finishing their mantrams, they sing various hymns to Varu<u>n</u>a. Next to the K<u>s</u>iroda Sâgara, is the Saka Dvîpa, thirty two lakh yoyanas wide, surrounded by the Dadhi Sâgara (the ocean of curds), of similar dimensions. Here the most excellent tree named the Saka tree exists. O Nârada! The Dvîpa is named so after the tree. Medhâtithi, the son of Priyavrata is the Lord of this Dvîpa. He divided this land into the seven Var<u>s</u>as and distributed each to his seven sons respectively; and ultimately he took refuge to the path of Yoga. The names of the seven Var<u>s</u>as are Purojava, Manojava, Pavamânaka, Dhûmrânîka, Chitrarepha, Bahurûpa, and Visvadhrik. In these Var<u>s</u>as there are seven mountains, one in each Var<u>s</u>a, as forming their boundaries; and there are seven rivers also. The names of the mountains are :-- Îsana, Ûrusri<u>n</u>ga, Valabhadra, Sata Kesara, Sahasra-srotaka, Devapâla, and Mahâsana; the names of the rivers are :-- Anaghâ, Âyurdâ, Ubhayaspri<u>st</u>i, Aparâjitâ, Pañchapadî, and Sahasrasruti and Nijadhriti. These seven rivers are all very big and resplendent with lustre. The people are divided into four classes :-- Var<u>s</u>as, Satyavrata, Kratuvrata, Dânavrata, and A<u>n</u>uvrata. They all take the Prâ<u>n</u>ayâma exercise and thereby bring the Râjas, and Tamo Gu<u>n</u>a under their subjection and they worship Hari, of the nature of Prâ<u>n</u>a Vayu, Higher than the Highest. Their mantra is this :-- He has entered into all the living beings and nourishes them by the Prâ<u>n</u>a and other faculties; He is the Internal Ruler of all and the Supreme Controller; this Universe is under His control; let Him protect and nourish us. O Nârada! Next to this Dadhi Sâgara is Pu<u>s</u>kara Dvîpa; it is twice as large as Sâka Dvîpa. It is surrounded by the Dudha Sâgar (the ocean of milk) all twice as large. The leaves of Pu<u>s</u>kara tree that shines in the Pu<u>s</u>kara Dvîpa, are fiery like golden flames; they are as clean and pure. Crores and crores of leaves, golden in colour ornament this Tree. Vâsudeva, the Guru of all the Lokas, has created this Pu<u>s</u>kara Dvîpa as the seat of Parame<u>st</u>hî Brahmâ, possessed of six extraordinary powers, for the purpose of creation. There is one mountain in this Dvîpa; it is divided into two parts, named Arvâchîna and Parâchîna. These form the boundaries of the two Var<u>s</u>as. The</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">mountain is one Ayuta Yoyana high and one Ayuta Yoyana wide. There are four cities on the four sides. Indra and the three other Lokapâlas are the lords of these cities. The Sun God comes out from their top and circumambulating Meru, goes there again. The whole year is his Chakram, circle of circuit; His path is Uttrâya<u>n</u>am and Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>âya<u>n</u>am. Vîtihotra, the son of Priyavrata is the lord of this island. He distributed the two Var<u>s</u>as amongst his two sons, Rama<u>n</u>a and Dhâtakî. They rule over the two Var<u>s</u>as named also after them. Like the inhabitants of the above Var<u>s</u>as, the people also get powers of themselves and worship devotedly the God seated on the lotus and follow such path of the Yoga as leads them to the Brahmâ Sâlokyâ, etc. The mantra runs thus :-- We bow down to that One God, without a Second, of the nature of Peace, Who is the Fruit of all the Karmas, Who is the seat of illumination of Brahmâ, Who is established in Unity, and Who is worshipped by all the Lokas.</p>
