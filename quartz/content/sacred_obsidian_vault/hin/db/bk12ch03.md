Thou art the Lord of this world; Thou canst shew favour and disfavour both; Thou art specially versed in the sixty-four Kalâs (arts of learning); Thou art the chief of the Yogis. I therefore ask Thee to solve a doubt of mine. By what Pu<u>n</u>yam a man can become free from all his sins and limitations and he can realise and become of the nature of Brahmâ. O Lord! And what are duly the Ri<u>s</u>is, Chha<u>n</u>das, Devatâs, Dhyân, and Nyâsa, etc., of this meritorious act? I want to hear.</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">4-25. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Nârada! There is but one and the only one way to this and though that is very secret, I will disclose that to you. It is the Gâyatrî-Kavacha. It can destroy all sins. Therefore to recite or to hold it on one's body enables the man to become free from all his sins and to get all his desires fulfilled and he gets the Sâyuya Mukti with the Devî (be merged in the Devî-Body). Now hear the Ri<u>s</u>is, Chha<u>n</u>das, etc., of this Kavacha :-- Brahmâ, Vi<u>sn</u>u and Mahes'vara are the Ri<u>s</u>is; the Rik, Yajus, Sâma and Atharva Vedas are the Chha<u>n</u>das; the Paramâ Kalâ Gâyatrî of the nature of Brahmâ is the Devatâ; Tat in Gâyatrî is the Vîja; Bharga is the Sakti; and Dhîyah is the Kîlaka; and its viniyoga (application) is in getting the Mok<u>s</u>a (liberation.). With the first four syllables touch the heart; with</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">the next three letters touch the head; with the next four letters touch the tuft on the crown of the head; with the next three letters on the Kavacha; with the next four letters on the eyes and with the last four letters make the Nyâsa, all over the body repeating Astrâya Pha<u>t</u>, O Nârada! Hear now the Dhyânam of Gâyatrî, that grants all desires. The Gâyatrî Devî has five faces; one of which is of white colour; and the other four is of pearl, Vidruma, golden, and Nîlakântama<u>n</u>i colour respectively. Each face has got three eyes; on the head there is a crown of jewels and the digit of the Moon is shining there. Her body is composed of the twenty-four tattvas. She has ten hands :-- On the top right and left hands there are two lotuses; lower down, there are disc and conch shell; lower down, there are rope and skull; lower down, there are noose and goad; and on the bottom hands right and left she is making signs of No fear and ready to grant boons. Thus meditating on Srî Gâyatrî, one is to recite the Kavacha thus :-- Let the Gâyatrî Devî protect my front; Sâvitrî Devî protect my right; the Sandhyâ Devî, my back and the Devî Sarasvatî, my left. Let my Mother Pârvatî Devî protect my quarters. Let Jalas'âyinî protect the southeast; Yâtudhâna Bhayankarî protect my South-west; Pavamânavilâsinî my north-west; Rudrarûpi<u>n</u>î Rudrâ<u>n</u>î protect my north-east. Let Brahmâ<u>n</u>î protect my top and Vai<u>sn</u>avî protect my nether regions. Let the word Tat in the Gâyatrî protect my legs; Savitu<u>h</u> protect my Knees; Vare<u>n</u>yam, protect my loins; Bhargah, my navel. Let Devasya protect my heart; Dhîmahî protect my neck; Dhîyah, protect my eyes; Yah, protect my forehead; Na<u>h</u> protect my head; and Prachodayât protect the tuft on the crown of my head.</p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'"> </p>   
 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">Again let the Tat of the twenty-four syllabled Gâyatrî protect my head; Sa, protect my forehead; Vi protect my eyes; Tu my cheeks; Va, protect my nostrils; Re, my mouth; <u>n</u>i protect my upper lip; Ya<u>h</u> protect my lower lip; Bha within my face; rgo, protect my cheeks; De, my throat; Va my shoulders; Sya my right hand; Dhi my navel; ma, my heart, Hi, my belly; Dhî, my navel; Yo my loins; Yo, my anus; na<u>h</u>, my thighs, Pra, my Knees; Cho my shanks Da my heels; Yâ my legs; and let at protect all my sides. O Nârada! This divine Kavacha of the Devî Gâyatrî can baffle hundreds and thousands of obstructions and evils; can grant sixty-four Kalâs and liberation. By the glory of this Kavacha, man can become free from all evils and can attain the state of Brahmâ. Moreover whoever reads or hears this acquires the fruits of making a gift of a thousand cows.</p>
