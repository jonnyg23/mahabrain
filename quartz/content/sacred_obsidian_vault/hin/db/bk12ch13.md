He who hears this greatly wonderful Purâ<u>n</u>am Srî Devî Bhâgavatam certainly becomes dear to the Devî and all his actions become fructified with success. Now as regards your mental distress, how you prevent any evil falling to your late father in his future life, I advise you to do the Yajñâ in the name of Bhagavatî; and certainly your father will be saved. And you also better take the Most Excellent Mantra of the Mahâ Devî duly, according to rules; and your human life will then be crowned with success; (your life will be saved; thus you as well as your father will be saved).</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">5-12. Sûta said :-- O Ri<u>s</u>is! Hearing thus, the King asked Vyâsa Deva to initiate in the Great Devî Mantra and thus to become his Guru. He was then initiated duly according to rules with the Great Mantra of Bhagavatî united with Pra<u>n</u>ava. When the Navarâtra period arrived, he called Dhaumya and other Brâhma<u>n</u>as and performed the Navarâtra Vrata so very dear to the Devî, according to his state. At this time for the satisfaction of the Devî, he caused this Devî Bhâgavata Purâ<u>n</u>a to be read by the Brâhma<u>n</u>as and fed innumerable Brâhma<u>n</u>as and Kumârîs (virgins) and gave in charity lots of things to the poor, orphans, and the Brâhmi<u>n</u> boys and thus finished the Vrata. O Ri<u>s</u>is! Thus completing the Devîyajñâ, while the King was sitting on his seat, the fiery Devar<u>s</u>i Nârada came there from above playing with his lute. Seeing him there, all on a sudden, the King got up, and paid due respects to him by asking him to take his seat, with other necessary things. When the Devar<u>s</u>i became relieved of his labour of journey, the King asked him about his welfare and then enquired into the cause of his coming there.</p>

By your arrival here I am become blessed and feel that my Lord has come to me; now what can I serve to you; kindly command and oblige. Hearing this, the Devar<u>s</u>i Nârada said :-- O King! Today I saw in the Devaloka a very wonderful event. I wanted eagerly to inform that to you. Hence I have come here. Your father met with a bad turn of fate for his bad action. I saw today he assumed a divine form and he was going on a chariot. The Devas were praising him and the Apsarâs were encircling him. It seemed he</p>

You performed the Navarâtra Vrata and read the Devî Bhâgavata; it seems, as a result of that, your father has now been rewarded with such a noble and good turn of fate. Now you have become blessed and your actions have borne fruits. You have delivered your father from the hell and so you have become an ornament in your family. Today your name and fame have extended to the Devaloka.</p>

 <p align="none;text-autospace:none'">20-30. Sûta said :-- O Ri<u>s</u>is! Hearing these words from the mouth of Nârada, the King Janamejaya became very much happy and delighted and fell prostrate at the feet of Vyâsa Deva of glorious deeds and said :-- O Best of Munis! By Thy Grace, today I have become blessed. Now what return can I pay to Thee save bowing down to Thee. I pray that Thou dost shew such favours to me ever and again. O Ri<u>s</u>is! Hearing these words of the King Janamejaya, Vâdarâya<u>n</u>a Veda Vyâsa blessed him and spoke to him in sweet words :-- O King! Now leave all other actions. Read always the Devî Bhâgavata and worship the Lotus Feet of Srî Devî. Leave off all laziness and now perform the Devî Yajñâ with great eclât. And you will surely be able to cross this bondage of the world. True there are various Purâ<u>n</u>as, the Vi<u>sn</u>u Purâ<u>n</u>a, the Siva Purâ<u>n</u>a, but those cannot compare with one sixteenth of this Devî Bhâgavatam. In fact, this Purâ<u>n</u>a is the Essence of all the Purâ<u>n</u>as. How can the other Purâ<u>n</u>as be compared with this, wherein is established the Devî Mûla Prakriti? Reading this Purâ<u>n</u>a from the beginning to the end yields the result of reading the Vedas. So the wise persons should try their best to study it always. Thus saying to Janamejaya, Veda Vyâsa departed. Then the pure minded Dhaumya and the other Brâhma<u>n</u>as highly praised the Devî Bhâgavatam and went to their desired places. And the King Janamejaya, on the other hand, began to read and hear always the Devî Bhâgavatam and spent his days happily in governing his kingdom.</p>

 <p>Here end the Thirteenth Chapter of the Twelfth Book on the description of Janamejayas Devî Yajñâ in the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am Srî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.</p>
