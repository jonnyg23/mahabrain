Of these, the Vah<u>n</u>iku<u>nd</u>a has the fire lit at its bottom, by the help of various kinds of stones. This Ku<u>nd</u>a will not be destroyed till Mahâpralaya comes. Here the sinners are tormented severely. It looks like a blazing coke. The flames are rising from it one hundred hands high. In circumference those flames are two miles. This is named Vah<u>n</u>iku<u>nd</u>a. It is full of sinners crying loudly. It is constantly watched by My messengers who are chastising and punishing the sinners. Next comes the Tapta Ku<u>nd</u>a. It is filled with hot water and full of rapacious animals. The sinners there are severely beaten by My messengers and they are always crying out very loudly, which is being echoed and re-echoed all around terribly. It extends for one mile. This Ku<u>nd</u>a is filled with hot salt water and the abode of many crows. Then there is the Bhayânaka Ku<u>nd</u>a. It extends for two miles and it is filled with sinners.

It is filled with faeces and excrements where the sinners are moving without any food and with their palate and throats dry. Its size is two miles and it is very bad and ugly with foetid and nasty smell. It is always filled with sinners, who are being chastised by My Dûtas (messengers) and eat those faeces and excrements.

Then come in succession the four Ku<u>nd</u>as Nakha, Loma and others. They also measure each one-fourth that of a Vâpî. The sinners dwell there, always chastised by My messengers. Next comes the very hot Tâmra Ku<u>nd</u>a. Burning cokes exist on the top of very hot coppers. There are lakhs and lakhs of very hot copper figures in that Ku<u>nd</u>a.

Millions and millions of great sinners are made by My men to fall from the tops of those trees down below where their bodies get pierced by very sharp thorns, six feet long; and thus they dwell there, beaten by My men. Out of thirst, their palates get dried up; and they cry out repeatedly, Water, water. Out of fear, they get very anxious and then their heads get broken by the clubs brought down on them by My men. So they move there like the beings burnt in very hot oil. Then comes the Vi<u>s</u>oda Ku<u>nd</u>a.

These are filled with gad-flies, mosquitoes, and poison respectively. Each of them measures one mile. The sinners hands and feet are tied up. So when the gad-flies and mosquitoes fiercely sting them, and My men violently beat them simultaneously, they raise a loud uproar and are made to move on, in their tied states by My persons. Their bodies get thoroughly reddened and covered with blood by the stinging of the flies, etc. Then come the Vajra Ku<u>nd</u>a and the Vrischika Ku<u>nd</u>a filled respectively with Vajra insects and the scorpions.
