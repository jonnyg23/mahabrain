 <p align="center">(Verses 379--438)</p>  
 <p>CEASING to feed the imagination on things not Self full of darkness, causing sorrow, bend the imagination on the Self, whose form is bliss, the cause of freedom.</p>  
 <p>This is the self luminous, witness of all, ever shining through the veil of the soul; making the one aim this Self, that is the contrary of all things unreal, realize it by identification with its partless nature.</p>  
 <p>Naming this from its undivided being, its freedom from all other tendency, let him know it clearly from being of the own nature of Self.</p>  
 <p>Firmly realizing self-hood in that, abandoning selfhood in the selfish personality, stand towards it as a disinterested onlooker stands towards the fragments of a broken vase.</p>  
 <p>Entering the purified inner organ into the witness whose nature is the Self, who is pure awakening, leading upward step by step to unmoving firmness, let him then gain vision of perfection.</p>  
 <p>Let him gain vision of the Self, freed from all disguises built up by ignorance of the Self--body, senses, vitality, emotion, personality--the Self whose nature is partless and perfect like universal ether.</p>  
 <p>The ether, freed from its hundred disguises--water-pots, jars, corn-measures and the like--is one and not divided, thus also, the pure supreme, freed from personality, is one.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 63</font></a></p>  
 <p>All disguises beginning with the Evolver and ending with a log are mirage only; therefore let him behold his own perfect Self, standing in the Self's oneness.</p>  
 <p>Whatever by error is built up as different from that, is in reality that only, not different from that. When the error is destroyed, the reality of the snake that was seen shines forth as the rope; thus the own-nature of all is the Self.</p>  
 <p>The Evolver is the Self, the Pervader is the Self, the Sky-lord is the Self, the Destroyer is the Self; all this universe is the Self; there is nothing but the Self.</p>  
 <p>Inward is the Self, outward also is the Self; the Self is to the east, the Self is also to the west. The Self is to the south, the Self is also to the north. The Self is above, the Self is beneath.</p>  
 <p>Just as wave and foam, eddy and bubble are in their own nature water; so, from the body to the personality, all is consciousness, the pure essence of consciousness. [390]</p>  
 <p>Being verily is all this world, that is known of voice and mind, there is nothing else than Being, standing on nature's other shore. Are cup and water-pot and jar anything but earth? He who is deluded by the wine of glamor speaks of "thou" and "I."</p>  
 <p>"When by repeated effort naught remains but this," the scripture says, declaring absence of duality, to put an end to false transference of reality.</p>  
 <p>Like the ether, free from darkness, free from wavering, free from limits, free from motion, free from change; having neither a within nor a without, having no other</p>  
 <p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 64</font></a></p>  
 <p>than it, having no second, is the Self, the supreme Eternal; what else is there to be known?</p>  
 <p>What more is there to be said? The Eternal, the Life, the Self is seen here under many forms; all in this world is the Eternal, the secondless Eternal; the scripture says "I am the Eternal"; knowing this clearly, those whose minds are awakened, who have abandoned the outward, becoming the Eternal, dwell in the Self, which is extending consciousness and bliss. This, verily, is sure.</p>  
 <p>Kill out desire that springs up through thought of self in the body formed of darkness, then violent passion in the formal body woven of the breath. Knowing the Self whose fame is sung in the hymns, who is eternal and formed of bliss, stand in the being of the Eternal.</p>  
 <p>As long as the son of man enjoys this body of death, he is impure; from the enemies arises the weariness that dwells in birth and death and sickness. When he knows the pure Self of benign form, immovable, then he is free from these;--thus says the scripture too.</p>  
 <p>When all delusive qualities attributed to the Self are put away, the Self is the supreme eternal, perfect, secondless, changeless.</p>  
 <p>When the activity of the imagination comes to rest in the higher Self, the Eternal that wavers not, then no more wavering is seen, and vain words only remain.</p>  
 <p>The belief in this world is, built up of unreality. In the one substance, changeless, formless, undifferentiated, what separateness can exist?</p>  
 <p>In the one substance, in which no difference of seer, seeing, seen, exists, which is changeless, formless, undifferentiated,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 65</font></a></p>  
 <p>what separateness can exist? [400]</p>  
 <p>In the one substance, like the world-ocean full to overflowing, changeless, formless, undifferentiated, whence can separateness come?</p>  
 <p>Where the cause of delusion melts away, like darkness in light, in the secondless, supreme reality, undifferentiated, what separateness can there be?</p>  
 <p>In the supreme reality, the very Self of oneness, how could any word of difference dwell? By whom is difference perceived in purely blissful dreamlessness?</p>  
 <p>For this world no longer is, whether past, present, or to come, after awakening to the supreme reality, in the real Self, the Eternal, from all wavering free. The snake seen in the rope exists not, nor even a drop of water in the desert mirage, where the deer thirsts.</p>  
 <p>This duality is mere glamor, for the supreme reality is not twofold; thus the scripture says, and it is directly experienced in dreamlessness.</p>  
 <p>By the learned it has been perceived that the thing attributed has no existence apart from the substance, as in the case of the serpent and the rope. The distinction comes to life through delusion.</p>  
 <p>This distinction has its root in imagining; when imagining ceases it is no more. Therefore bring imagining to rest in the higher Self whose form is concealed.</p>  
 <p>In soul-vision the wise man perceives in his heart a certain wide-extending awakening, whose form is pure bliss, incomparable, the other shore, for ever free, where is no desire, limitless as the ether, partless, from wavering free, the perfect Eternal. t</p>  
 <p>In soul-vision the wise man perceives in his heart</p>  
 <p><a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 66</font></a></p>  
 <p>the reality free from growth and change, whose being is beyond perception, the essence of equalness, unequalled, immeasurable, perfectly taught by the words of inspiration, eternal, praised by us.</p>  
 <p>In soul-vision the wise man perceives in his heart the unfading, undying reality, which by its own being can know no setting, like the shimmering water of the ocean, bearing no name, where quality and change have sunk to rest, eternal, peaceful, one. [410]</p>  
 <p>Through intending the inner mind to it, gain vision of the Self, in its own form, the partless sovereignty. Sever thy bonds that are stained with the stain of life, and effortfully make thy manhood fruitful.</p>  
 <p>Standing in the Self, realize the Self in being, the Self from every disguise set free, Being, Consciousness, Bliss, the secondless; thus shalt thou build no more for going forth.</p>  
 <p>The mighty soul no more regards this body, cast aside like a corpse, seen to be but the shadow of the man, come into being as his reflection, through his entering into the result of his works.</p>  
 <p>Drawing near to the eternal, stainless awakening, whose nature is bliss, put very far away this disguise whose nature is inert and foul; nor let it be remembered again at all, for the remembrance of what has been cast forth builds for disdain.</p>  
 <p>Burning this up with its root in the flame of the real Self, the unwavering Eternal, the wise man stands excellent as the Self, through the Self which is eternal, pure, awakening bliss.</p>  
 <p>The body is strung on the thread of works already</p>  
 <p><a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 67</font></a></p>  
 <p>done, and is impure as the blood of slaughtered kine; whether it goes forward or stands, the knower of reality regards it not again, for his life is dissolved in the Eternal, the Self of bliss.</p>  
 <p>Knowing the partless bliss, the Self as his own self, with what desire or from what cause could the knower of reality cherish the body?</p>  
 <p>Of the perfect adept this is the fruit, of the seeker for union, free even in life--to taste without and within the essence of being and bliss in the Self.</p>  
 <p>The fruit of cleanness is awakening, the fruit of awakening is quiescence; from realizing the bliss of the Self comes peace, this fruit, verily, quiescence bears.</p>  
 <p>When the latter of these is absent, the former is fruitless. The supreme end is the incomparable enjoyment of the Self's bliss. [420]</p>  
 <p>The famed fruit of wisdom is not to tremble before manifest misfortune. The various works that were done in the season of delusion, worthy of all blame -how could a man deign to do them after discernment has been gained?</p>  
 <p>Let the fruit of wisdom be cessation from unreality, a continuation therein is the fruit of unwisdom;--this is clearly seen. If there be not this difference between him who knows and him who knows not, as in the presence of the mirage to the thirsty deer, where is the manifest fruit of wisdom?</p>  
 <p>If the heart's knot of unwisdom be destroyed without remainder, how could sensual things cause continuance in unreality, in him who has no desire?</p>  
 <p>When mind-images arise not in the presence of sensual</p>  
 <p><a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 68</font></a></p>  
 <p>things, this is the limit of purity; when the personal idea does not arise, this is the limit of illumination. When life-activity that has been dissolved does not arise again, this is the limit of quiescence.</p>  
 <p>He whose thought is free from outward objects, through standing ever in the nature of the Eternal, who is as lightly concerned with the enjoyment of sensual things followed by others as a sleeping child, looking on this world as a land beheld in dream, when consciousness comes back, enjoying the fruit of endless holy deeds, he is rich and worthy of honor in the world.</p>  
 <p>This sage, standing firm in wisdom, reaches Being and Bliss, he is changeless, free from all acts, for his Self is dissolved in the Eternal.</p>  
 <p>Being that is plunged in the oneness of the Eternal and the Self made pure, that wavers not and is pure consciousness alone, is called wisdom.</p>  
 <p>They say he stands firm in wisdom, in whom this wisdom steadfastly dwells. He in whom wisdom is firmly established, who enjoys unbroken bliss, by whom the manifested world is almost unheeded, is called free even in life.</p>  
 <p>He who with thought dissolved is yet awake, though free from the bondage of waking life, whose illumination is free from impure mind-images, he, verily, is called free even in life.</p>  
 <p>He who perceives that his soul's pilgrimage is ended, who is free from disunion even while possessing division, whose imagination is free from imaginings, he, verily, is called free even in life.</p>  
 <p>He who even while this body exists, regards it as a</p>  
 <p><a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 69</font></a></p>  
 <p>shadow, who has no sense of personality or possessions--these are the marks of him who is free in life. [430]</p>  
 <p>Whose mind lingers not over the past, nor goes out after the future, when perfect equanimity is gained, this is the mark of him who is free even in life.</p>  
 <p>In this world, whose very nature is full of differences, where quality and defect are distinguished, to regard all things everywhere as the same, this is the mark of him who is free even in life.</p>  
 <p>Accepting wished and unwished objects with equanimity in the Self, and changing not in either event, is the mark of him who is free even in life.</p>  
 <p>When the sage's imagination is fixed on tasting the essence of the bliss of the Eternal, so that he distinguishes not between what is within and without, this is the mark of him who is free even in life.</p>  
 <p>Who is free from thought of "I" and "my," in body and senses and their works, who stands in equanimity, bears the mark of one who is free even in life.</p>  
 <p>He who has discerned the Eternal in the Self, through the power of sacred books, who is free from the bondage of the world, bears the mark of one who is free even in life.</p>  
 <p>He who never identifies himself with the body and senses, nor separates himself in thought from what is other than these, bears the mark of one who is free even in life. [438]</p>
