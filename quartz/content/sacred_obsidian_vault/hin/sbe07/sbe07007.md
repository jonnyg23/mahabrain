 <font size="2"><p>[1. The crimes by the commission of which a man becomes a Mahâpatakin, 'mortal sinner,' will be enumerated below, XXXV.</p>
 <p>2. The use of the particle <i>k</i>a implies, according, to Nand. and a passage of Yama quoted by him, that, besides brawling him, the criminal should be shorn, his deed publicly proclaimed, and himself mounted upon an ass and led about the town.]</p>

 <p>14. Such also as aspire to sovereignty, though being of low birth;</p>
 <p>15. Breakers of dikes;</p>

A Kumbha is a measure of grain equal to twenty Dro<i>n</i>as, or a little more than three bushels and three gallons. Nand. mentions, as the opinion of some, that 1 Kumbha = 2 Dro<i>n</i>as.

 <p>13. Regarding the value of a Mâsha, see IV, 7, I 1.</p>
 <p>15. Nand. infers from the use of the particle <i>k</i>a and from a {footnote p. 27} passage of Manu (IX, 280), that robbers who forcibly enter the kings treasury, or the arsenal, or a temple, are likewise intended here.]</p>

 <p>20. If he places himself on the same seat with his superior, he shall be banished with a mark on his buttocks. he shall lose both lips;</p>
 <p>21. If he spits on him,</p>
 <p>22. If he breaks wind against him, his hindparts;</p>
 <p>23. If he uses abusive language, his tongue.</p>
 <p>24. If a (low-born) man through pride give instruction (to a member of the highest caste) concerning his duty, let the king order hot oil to be dropped into his mouth.</p>

 <p>20. The particle <i>k</i>a, indicates here that if he urinates against a superior his organ shall be cut off. (Nand.) See M. VIII, 282.</p>
 <p>26. This Sûtra has been rendered in accordance with Kullûkâ's gloss on M. VIII, 273, Nand.'s interpretation of it being palpably wrong.]</p>

 <p>29. He shall pay the highest amercement for imputing to another (a great crime) entailing loss of caste;</p>
 <p>30. The second amercement for (imputing to another) a minor offence (such as the slaughter of a cow);</p>
