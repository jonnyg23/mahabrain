 <p>31. Nand. infers from another Sm<i>ri</i>ti passage that <i>k</i>a here refers to a crow and to a <i>S</i>ûdra or workman with his tools.</p>
 <p>32. Nand. here refers <i>k</i>a to shells and other objects mentioned in a Sm<i>ri</i>ti.</p>

 <p>36. Or (if he has seen) one wearing a dress (of a reddish-yellow colour) dyed with Kashâya<sup>[1]</sup>, or an ascetic, or one smeared<sup>[2]</sup> (with ashes)<sup>[3]</sup>;</p>

 <p>38. Or (if he has seen) salt, or a eunuch, or (the spirituous liquor called) Âsava, or an impotent man, or cotton cloth, or a rope, or an iron chain for the feet, or a person with dishevelled hair.</p>
 <p>39. (If he sees), while about to begin a journey, a lute, or sandal-wood, or fresh pot-herbs, or a turban, or an Ornament, or an unmarried damsel, he must praise them.</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[36. <sup>1</sup> Nand. refers kâshâyin, 'wearing a dress dyed with Kashâya,' to 'persons who wear the marks of an order to which they do not belong.' But this interpretation is evidently wrong. Among the sects that wear a dress dyed with Kashâya, Buddhists are the most prominent, but it must not be overlooked that there are other important sects also, as e. g. the Svâminârâya<i>n</i>îs of the present day, who wear such dresses.--<sup>2</sup> The term malina, 'smeared,' no doubt refers to a <i>S</i>aiva sect. Nand. interprets it by 'Kâpâlikas and the like;' but more probably the Pâ<i>s</i>upatas are meant.--<sup>3</sup> The particle <i>k</i>a further refers to the humpbacked, deaf, and blind, to barren women, and to naked and hungry persons, as stated in a Sm<i>ri</i>ti. (Nand,)</p>
 <p>37. <sup>1</sup> Nand. refers the particle <i>k</i>a in this Sûtra to hares, naked mendicants, snakes, iguanas, lizards, skins, and other inauspicious objects and persons enumerated in a Sm<i>ri</i>ti.</p>
 <p>38. Nand. argues from a passage of Nârada (not found in his Institutes), that the particle <i>k</i>a here refers to persons mounted upon an ass, camel, or buffalo, and others.</p>
 <p>39. <sup>1</sup> Nand. mentions two explanations of this Sûtra: 1. he must eulogise the above objects or persons if he sees them; 2. he must gladden persons, who have those objects or persons with them, with presents and the like.]</p>

 <p>40. He must not (knowingly) step on (or step over, or stand on) the shade of the image of a deity, of a (learned) Brâhma<i>n</i>a, of a spiritual teacher, of a brown (bull or other animal), or of one by whom the initiatory ceremony at a Soma-sacrifice has been performed.</p>
 <p>41. Nor (must he step) on anything spat out or vomited, nor on blood, nor on fæces or urine, nor on water used for ablutions.</p>
 <p>42. He must not step over a rope to which a calf (or a cow) is tied.</p>
 <p>43. He must not walk quickly in the rain.</p>
 <p>44. He must not cross a river without need;</p>
 <p>45. Nor without having previously offered an oblation of water to the gods and to the manes;</p>
 <p>46. Nor (swimming) with his arms;</p>

 <p>48. He must not stand on the bank (of a river).</p>

 <p>50. He must not cross it (by swimming through it, or in any other way).</p>
 <p>51. Way must be made for an aged man, for one carrying a burden, for a king, for a Snâtaka (of any of the three kinds<sup>[1]</sup>), for a woman, for a sick person, for a bridegroom, and for one riding in a carriage. Among those, should they all meet, a king must be</p>
 <font size="2"><p>[41. According to Nand., the particle vâ, 'or,' is added at the end of this Sûtra, in order to include an officiating priest and others mentioned by Yâ<i>g</i>ñavalkya I, 152.</p>
 <p>51. <sup>1</sup> The Snâtaka (see XXV III, 42, note) is of three kinds: 1. the Vidyâsnâtaka, who has studied the Vedas; 2. the Vratasnâtaka, who has performed the Vratas or vowed observances of a student; 3. the Ubhayasnâtaka, who has completed both the Vedas and the Vratas. (Nand.) See the G<i>ri</i>hya-sûtras.]</p>

 <p>honoured by the rest (excepting the Snâtaka); but the king himself must show honour to a Snâtaka.</p>
