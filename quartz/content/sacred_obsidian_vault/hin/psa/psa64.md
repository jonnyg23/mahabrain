 <p>SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,--O great king! if I could obtain the power of the lord of Dwarka, I would relate the whole history of the taking away of Ookha; listen with attention, and I will explain, how she saw Unroodrù in a dream at night, and lost her strength through sorrow; and how Chitrekha brought about a meeting between Unroodrù, and Ookha. In the generation of Bruhmù was first Kusyp, whose son Hirunkusyp was very mighty and renowned; and became immortal. His son Hurijun, a worshipper of Krishnù, was named Purladh, whose son was Raja Biroochun, and Biroochun's son the Raja Bul, whose fame and excellence are still spread abroad on the earth. When Krishnù descended upon the earth in the form of a dwarf, he having practised a stratagem sent Raja Bul to the infernal regions. The eldest Sal of that Bul was Banasoor; a very potent and splendid monarch, he dwelt in Shronitpore, and went constantly to the mountain Kuelas to perform adoration to Shivù; he cherished the profession of brahmins, spoke the truth, and lived with his passions in complete subjection.</p>  
 <p>O great king! Banasoor having gone to the hill Kuelas, and performed adoration to Huri; and being absorbed in an intense feeling of affection, began in a state of ecstacy to play upon the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_295"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 295</font></a></p>  
 <p>hand-drum and dance and sing. Hearing him sing and play, Shree Muhadeo Bholanath was delighted, and began to dance with Parbutee, and play upon a hand-drum. After dancing for some time, Muhadeo was highly pleased; and having called Banasoor to him said, "Son! I have been highly gratified with your singing and dancing, ask a boon from me, and I will grant whatever you ask; you have played most agreeably, and my mind has been rejoiced at hearing you."</p>  
 <p>On hearing these words, O great king! Banasoor, joining his hands and bending his head, said, with the greatest humility, "O lord of compassion! you have shown me great favour in promising me a boon, I solicit that you will first make me immortal, and confer on me the sovereignty of the whole world, and afterwards make me so powerful that no one will obtain a victory over me." Muhadeo Jee replied, "I grant you this boon, and release you from all fear; in the three worlds no one shall have power equal to yours; and, even Bruhmù shall have no authority over you: you have played excellent music, and afforded me extreme gratification, being greatly rejoiced in mind, I have bestowed upon you a thousand arms, go home now, and, free from all anxiety, exercise a sovereignty, which cannot be shaken."</p>  
 <p>Banasoor, O great king ! having heard this speech of Bholanath, and, having received a thousand arms, was highly delighted; and, going to the right, by way of adoration, and bowing his head, took leave, and dwelt by permission at Shronitpore, afterwards having conquered the three worlds, and having brought all the gods under subjection, he dug a broad deep ditch with water, springing at the bottom, and built castles of fire and air; being free from all dread or fear of any one, he began to carry on his government happily; after the lapse of some time his arms, in consequence of his not fighting, became very strong: he rubbed them and shook them about. Banasoor said to himself, "With whom shall I fight, on whom shall I make an attack? I have become infected with itch in</p>  
 <p><a name="page_296"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 296</font></a></p>  
 <p>consequence of not fighting, who will fulfil the desires of my mind?"</p>  
 <p>Having thus spoken, Banasoor went outside his house, and began to root up hills, and dash them to pieces, and wander about different countries. When he had destroyed all the hills, and the irritation and itching of his hands had not left him, Banasoor said, "With whom shall I now fight, and what shall I do with so many arms? How shall I support the huge weight of my own strength, I will go again to Muhadeo, and speak to him on the subject."</p>  
 <p>O great king! Banasoor, having thus reflected, went into the presence of Muhadeo Jee, and, joining his hands and bowing his head said, "O lord of the three worlds! in whose hand is the trident, you did me the kindness to bestow upon me a thousand arms, which I find too heavy for my body, I cannot support the weight of them, be pleased to remedy this, and point out some one possessed of great strength with whom I may fight, I cannot find any one in the three worlds so powerful as to face me in an encounter; as you have, through compassion, bestowed on me great strength, do me the kindness now to fight with me and satisfy the yearnings of my mind, or else point out some other very strong being with whom I may contend, and dissipate the troubles of my mind."</p>  
 <p>Having narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! Muhadeo Jee was angry at hearing Banasoor, thus address him, and began to say himself, "I granted him a boon, thinking him a holy man, and now he is ready to fight with me; this fool has become proud of his strength and shall not escape with life; he who indulges in pride never lives long." Muhadeo having these thoughts in his mind, said, "Banasoor! do not distress yourself, in a short time a fit antagonist for you, Shree Krishnù, will descend upon the earth in the family of Judoo, with exception of him there is no one in the three worlds who can contend</p>  
 <p><a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 297</font></a></p>  
 <p>with you." Banasoor was very much pleased when he heard this, and said, "Lord! when will that man descend upon the earth, and how shall I know that he has been born?" Raja Shivù presenting Banasoor with a banner, said to him, "Take this flag and place it on the top of your house, and when this flag shall fall of itself and be broken to pieces, then know that your enemy is born."</p>  
 <p>When Muhadeo, O great king! had thus explained to him, Banasoor took the flag and returned home. On arriving there, he fixed the flag upon his house, and daily offered up prayers that the man might appear, with whom he could fight. When some time had elapsed, his chief queen, named Banawutee, became pregnant, and when her time was completed, brought forth a girl; on that occasion Banasoor having sent for astrologers, and given them seats, said, "Fix upon the name, and point out the mental qualities of this girl." When he had thus spoken, the astrologers determined quickly upon the year, month, half month, lunar day, day of the week, hour, division of time equal to forty-eight minutes and the twenty-seventh division of the zodiack; and, having considered the proper moment, named the girl "Ookha," and said, "O great king! this girl will be a mine of beauty, and good qualities of mind and disposition; and will be very intelligent; we can discover this from her planet and other signs."</p>  
 <p>Banasoor was highly gratified at hearing this; and, having bestowed many gifts upon the astrologers, allowed them to take leave; and afterwards, having sent for singers and dancers and musicians, gave a festive entertainment. As the girl grew up, Banasoor treated her with the greatest affection. When Ookha was seven years of age, her father, Banasoor, sent her to the mountain Kuelas, which is near Shronitpore, with many attendants and companions to Shivù and Parbutee, for the purpose of learning to read. Ookha, having propitiated Guneshù and Suroswutee, went into the presence of Shivù and Parbutee; and, having joined her hands and bending her head,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 298</font></a></p>  
 <p>thus submissively spoke: "O seas of compassion! Shivù and Devee, grant me, your servant, the gift of knowledge, and acquire for yourselves renown in the world by so doing." O great king! Shivù and Parbutee, being pleased with the humility of Ookha's speech, began to impart knowledge to her; she went constantly to them for the purpose of reading; and after some time had been thus spent, she read all the Shastrùs; and became very proficient in knowledge, and played upon all kinds of musical instruments. One day Ookha played a duet with Parbutee on the lute, and sang scientifically, when Shivù Jee came and said to Parbutee, "Beloved! Shree Krishnù Chund has restored to life Kamdeo, whom I burnt to death." Having thus spoken, Shree Muhadeo went to the banks of the Ganges with Parbutee, and bathing both himself and her, became very amorous, and began to assist Parbutee in dressing with great affection of manner, and to make love to her. At length, in the ecstasy of his passion, he began to play upon a hand-drum, and dance frantically with violent gesticulation, singing according to the science of music, explained in the Shastrùs, and fondly embracing his wife. Ookha, beholding the mutual joy and fondness of Shivù and Parbutee, and feeling a desire to have a husband, began to say to herself, "If I had a husband, I would enjoy amorous diversion with him, in the manner of Shivù and Parbutee. A woman without a husband is as defective in beauty as night without the moon."</p>  
 <p>When, O great king! Ookha had thus expressed her thoughts to herself, Shree Parbutee, acquainted with the secrets of the heart, knowing her thoughts, invited her with the greatest affection to come near, and thus with the most tender regard addressed her, "Daughter! suffer not any anxiety of mine, thou shalt obtain a husband in a dream; search for him and enjoy amorous pleasure with him." Having thus given her a bridegroom, the wife of Shivù allowed Ookha to take leave. Having attained a great proficiency in knowledge, and received a promise of a husband, she made a salutation, and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 299</font></a></p>  
 <p>went to her father; who gave her a very beautiful house, apart from all others, to live in. And she, taking with her several of her friends and companions, lived there, and increased in stature daily.</p>  
 <p>O great king! when the young maiden had reached the age of twelve years, the full moon hid its diminished rays on beholding the lustre of her moon-like countenance; compared with the blackness of her hair, the darkness of the night at the change of the moon seemed trifling. On seeing her taper locks, snakes cast their skins and fled away; the bow began to palpitate, on beholding the arch of her eye-brows; deer, fishes and wagtails were abashed at the sight of her large and rolling eyes; the sesamum withered on gazing at the elegance of her nose; the fruit of the binba tree was restless at the redness of her lips; the breast of the pomegranate was lacerated, on viewing the regularity of her teeth; the rose ceased to blow when she saw the softness of her cheeks; pigeons were fidgetty at the roundness of her neck; on taking a side view of her breasts, the buds of the lotus fell into the tank; the lioness retired into the forest when she saw her slim waist; the plantain ate camphor on beholding the smoothness of her thighs; gold was abashed at the fairness of her body, and the chumpa hid itself; the lotus lost all its estimation in comparison with her hands and feet. 'Such was she, with the gait of an elephant, the voice of a kokila, and in the very flower of youth and beauty, and by the splendour of her charms eclipsed all the abovementioned.</p>  
 <p>On a subsequent day, the maiden, having applied perfumes and paste, and bathed and rubbed herself in pure water, combed her hair, and divided it, and fastening pearls where the hair is divided, made use of antimony and tooth-powder, and stained herself with "<i>mehadu</i>" and "<i>lac</i>;" and, having eaten pawn and decked herself out in all kinds of jewels and ornaments' wearing an elegant, brilliant petticoat, with a border of large pearls, and a cloth round her body with a hem of great splendour,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_300"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 300</font></a></p>  
 <p>a shining boddice, and a sparkling and perfumed veil, came forth thus adorned and smiling with her female companions and attendants like Luchmee, and saluted her parents. When Ookha stood before them after having made a salutation, Banasoor, on beholding the splendour of her beauty, allowed her to take leave, with this thought in his mind, "That she was now of a fit age to be married;" and he afterwards sent many male demons to guard her house, and many females for the protection of her person; the male demons exercised the greatest vigilance night and day, and the females were in constant attendance upon her.</p>  
 <p>O great king! the royal .maiden constantly performed penance, bestowed gifts, fasted and offered adoration to Shree Parbutee Jee for a husband; saying, "When will my father celebrate my marriage, and how shall I obtain a husband?" Having thus said, she went to sleep, thinking of a husband, and beheld in a dream a being of a childish appearance, black colour, a moon-like countenance, lotus eyes, very beautiful and Cupid-like, with an enchanting face, dressed in yellow silk, wearing a peacock crown on his head, standing awry, decked out with ornaments and jewels, wearing ear-rings in the shape of an alligator, a garland reaching to his feet, and also one of the "<i>goonja</i>" seed, and very wanton looking and playful. On seeing him, she blushed and held down her head. He then addressed her in the language of love, and approached her in an affectionate manner, and laying hold of her hand and embracing her, made her forget all her anxious and perplexing thoughts. Having both got rid of this reserve and hesitation, they sat upon the bed, and engaging in amorous dalliance and glances,  and kissing and embracing each other, they reciprocated pleasure, and in a delighted excitement of mind, addressed each other in the accents of love. After some time, when Ookha, in the midst of her affection, desired to embrace her husband in her arms, she awoke from sleep, and disappointed and sad, remained fixed in the position she had assumed with her arms</p>  
 <p><a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 301</font></a></p>  
 <p>extended for the embrace. She was very sorrowful on waking and greatly grieved; "Where has he gone, the lord of my soul?" She continued to search for him in every direction. She thought to herself, "How shall I meet him again, and how shall I see him? If I had continued sleeping, my beloved would. never have gone away? Why should I have been on the point of embracing him, when my sleep was disturbed, when I awoke, the night seemed very tedious, why did he inflict misery on me by departing? Without my beloved my soul is very wretched, whilst not beholding him, my eyes long for his presence. My ears desire anxiously to hear him speak. Where has my beloved gone, the bestower of pleasure? If I again behold my darling in a dream, I will resign my life to him."</p>  
 <p>O great king! having thus spoken, Ookha was very sad, and thinking upon her husband, sat down upon her bed with her face buried in her hands; when night was succeeded by morning, and about four hours and a half of the day had passed, her female friends and attendants began to say to each other, What has happened to Ookha, that she has not yet risen from sleep, although the day is so far advanced?" Having heard this remark, Chitrekha, the daughter of Banasoor's minister, Rookbhano, went to the picture gallery, and beheld Ookha, lying dejected and motionless on her curtained bed, shedding tears and heaving long drawn sighs. On seeing her in this state, Chitrekha said to her with great emotion, "Explain, my dear, to me, why you are so sad to-day, and have fallen into such a sea of affliction? You are weeping and sighing; why is your mind so disturbed? I will drive away all your griefs, and will do for you whatever you wish. You have no friend so attached as me, nor one who has a greater affection for you. I will wander over all the three worlds to accomplish what you desire. Bruhmù has granted me a boon, and subjected all to my authority. Devee will assist me; and, by means of her power I will do whatever you may tell me. Look upon me as possessed of</p>  
 <p><a name="page_302"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 302</font></a></p>  
 <p>such power of enchantment, as to be able to deceive and bring here Bruhmù, Roodrù and Indrù. No one knows the secrets of my nature, I therefore, myself explain my own attributes. No one, whosoever he be, whether good or bad, can speak with the same knowledge of them as I can; mention all your distresses to me; what has happened during the night? Do not deceive me, O beloved! and I will bring about all you hope for."</p>  
 <p>On hearing these words, O great king! Ookha was very much ashamed, and with her head drooping, approached Chitrekha, and said to her, in a sweet tone of voice, "O beloved! knowing you to be my friend, I will mention all that occurred during the night, keep the affair a secret; and if you can apply a remedy, do so. During the night, in a dream, a being of the colour of the clouds, a figure brilliant as the moon, with lotus-like eyes, dressed in yellow silk, and with a scarf of the same colour, came and sat near me, and displaying great affection for me, captivated my mind; so that I lost all reserve and bashfulness, and conversed with him; at length when the conversation had continued for some time, and in the eagerness of passion, I extended my arms to lay hold of him, I was awakened from sleep, and his fascinating form remained imprinted on my mind; I have never heard of nor seen any one like him. How shall I attempt to give you a description, his beauty exceeds the power of language. He has stolen away my affections. When I used to go to the mountain Kuelas to acquire knowledge, under the tuition of Shree Muhadeo Jee, Shree Parbutee told me, that I should see my husband in a dream, and that I ought to cause search to be made for him. I saw that bridegroom last night in a dream; where shall I find him again, and to whom shall I reveal the pangs of separation I endure? Whither shall I go, how shall I search for him, not knowing either his name or place of abode?"</p>  
 <p>O great king! when Ookha having thus spoken, and heaved long drawn sighs, drooped and pined in thought, Chitrekha said</p>  
 <p><a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 303</font></a></p>  
 <p>to her, "Be not at all anxious, my dear; I will search out your husband wherever he may be, and bring him to you. I have access to the three worlds; wherever he may be I will try and find him out for you. Tell me his name, and allow me permission to start." Ookha replied, "Friend! there is a proverb, he is dead, because he cannot breathe. If I knew his name and residence why should I be sad; could I not apply some remedy to my distress?" Chitrekha replied, "Never mind, dear, about not knowing his name and residence, I will write down and point out to you all the male inhabitants of the three worlds; amongst whom, show me him, who has stolen your heart, and it will be my business to bring him to you." Ookha laughed and assented.</p>  
 <p>O great king! when Chitrekha had obtained Ookha's consent, she sent for writing materials, and sat down upon the ground; and, having propitiated Guneshù and Devee, and meditated upon her spiritual preceptor, began to write. She first wrote and showed her a description of the three worlds with their eight divisions, and fourteen sub-divisions, the seven islands, the nine divisions of the earth, the sky, the seven seas, and Vishnù's celestial paradise. Afterwards Chitrekha showed her a description of the gods, demons, celestial musicians, choristers, demi-gods, saints, sages, the supporters of the world, the supporters of the ten quarters and the Rajas of all countries. But Ookha did not find her beloved amongst them. After this, Chitrekha drew separate likenesses of the descendants of Judoo; and when she showed them to Ookha, Ookha said on beholding Unroodrù's picture, "I have found him, who stole my heart, this is he, who came to me in the night. Arrange some plan now, friend, and search him out, and bring him here." On hearing this, Chitrekha replied, "How shall he escape me?" <a href="errata.htm#16">Chitrekha</a> proceeded to say, "O friend! you do not know him, but I can tell you who he is, he is of the family of Judoo, and a grandson of Shree Krishnù Chund, and the son of Purdiyomun; his name is Unroodrù. He lives at</p>  
 <p><a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 304</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Dwarka, a city built in the sea near the shore. By order of Huri, the quoit, Soodursun, keeps constant watch over that city in order that no devil, demon nor wicked person may annoy the descendants of Judoo, and if any such come to the city, he cannot obtain entrance without the permission of Rajas Oogursen and Soorsen."</p>  
 <p>O great king! Ookha was very sad at these words, and said, "O friend! if it be a place so difficult of access, how will you go there and bring my husband thence?" Chitrekha replied, "My dear! set your mind at rest on that point; by the glorious grace of Huri, I will bring your soul's lord to you." Having thus spoken, Chitrekha put on garments, imprinted all over with the name of Ramù, and made marks and perpendicular lines on her forehead with sandal wood, such as cowherdesses wear, and stamped impressions of different kinds on her breasts, the upper part of her arms and throat, and wearing a large garland of toolsee on her neck, and carrying rosaries of the large diamonds of the toolsee in her hand, throwing over herself a chequered blanket, she folded under her arm a cloth to sit upon and assuming the appearance of a chief worshipper of Vishnù, she made an obeisance and started for Dwarka, taking leave of Ookha, and saying to her, "I will proceed through the air, and pursue my journey in the sky, I will bring thy husband, otherwise my name is not Chitrekha."</p>  
 <p>Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, O great king! Chitrekha, having brought into play her delusive power, and mounting on a horse of air, started on a dark night in company with a black cloud; and having arrived almost instantaneously at the city of Dwarka, shone forth like lightning and entered the dwelling of Shree Krishnù Chund, in such a manner that no one knew of her coming. Prosecuting her search, she came to where Unroodrù sleeping alone on a bed, was diverting himself in a dream with Ookha. On beholding this, she quickly took up the sleeper's bed, and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 305</font></a></p>  
 <p>went off with it. She carried off the sleeper and his bed on Ookha's account, and brought Unroodrù to the place, where Ookha was sitting thoughtful.</p>  
 <p>O great king! on seeing Unroodrù and his bed, Ookha was  at first in a great flutter, and went and fell at the feet of Chitrekha, she afterwards began to speak in terms of the highest praise of her courage and prowess, for having gone to a place of such difficult access, and having brought him away, bed and all; and thereby having done what she agreed to do, "For my sake thou hast undergone all this trouble; I am not able to make a fitting return, but must remain a debtor to your goodness." Chitrekha replied, "In the world it is a very pleasant thing to contribute to the happiness of others; and it is a good act to assist them; this body is of no use with reference to our own selfish advantages, but it is very useful, if it can be made to promote the benefit of others. By such conduct our own objects and the objects of others are accomplished."</p>  
 <p>O great king! having thus spoken, Chitrekha took leave, and went home, saying, "Friend! by the glorious favour of Bhugwan I have brought thy husband to thee, awake him now and satisfy thy desires." On the departure of Chitrekha the delighted Ookha was ashamed and afraid of the first interview, and began to say to herself, "What shall I say to awaken my husband, and how shalt I embrace him in my arms?" At length she began to play sweet notes on her lute, on hearing the sound of which Unroodrù awoke; and, looking round on all sides, began to say to himself, "What place is this and whose house; how did I come here, and who has brought me here with my bed, while asleep?"</p>  
 <p>O great king! Unroodrù was in a state of great astonishment, uttering many expressions of surprise; whilst Ookha, thoughtful and abashed, fearful of the first interview, standing in a corner, and gazing on the countenance of her beloved, feasted her partridge-like eyes. In the mean while, Unroodrù, on seeing her,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 306</font></a></p>  
 <p>was confused, and said, "Tell me, fair one, thy history, who art thou, whence hast thou come to me; or hast thou brought me here thyself? Look not upon truth and falsehood as the same; at present I see every thing as in a dream."</p>  
 <p>O great king! Ookha made no reply to this speech, but became more ashamed, and crept into the corner; upon this he immediately laid hold of her by the hand, and seated her upon his bed; and, addressing her in the language of affection, dispelled all her anxiety and shame, and alarm; they sat together on the bed and began to exchange amorous glances, and engage in loving dalliance, and relate the history of their love. In the course of conversation Unroodrù Jee enquired from Ookha, "How didst thou, O beautiful creature! first see me, and afterwards have me brought here? Explain the circumstances fully to me, that my doubts may be all removed?" On hearing this Ookha, gazing with delight on the face of her husband, said, "You came to me in a dream, and stole away my affections; on awaking my mind was greatly troubled, and I mentioned the subject to Chitrekha, who, O lord! has brought you here, and whose proceedings I do not know." Afterwards Ookha said, "O great king! I have mentioned how I first saw, and have since found, you; be pleased now, O lord of the Judoos! to explain how you first saw me." Unroodrù was highly delighted at this request, and replied, smiling, "O beauteous fair! I also saw thee in a dream last night, and some one took me up in my sleep and brought me here. I have not yet discovered who it was, and, on awaking, I beheld thee."</p>  
 <p>Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! the two lovers conversed thus with each other; and in the fervour of their affection, indulged in all kinds of voluptuous pleasure and dalliance, and vanished all recollection of the pangs of separation they had endured; subsequently when Ookha found the taste of pawn insipid, the pearl necklace cold to the touch, and the light of the lamp dim, and went</p>  
 <p><a name="page_307"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 307</font></a></p>  
 <p>outside, she perceived that it was morning. The light of the moon was diminished, the splendour of the stars dimmed, and there was a dark, red colour in the sky. The birds were chirping on all sides, the white esculent lotus was withered, and the other lotus blooming, the red goose and its mate were together.</p>  
 <p>O great king! observing this state of things, Ookha immediately shut all the doors, and came in great fright into the house, and, putting her arms most affectionately round her husband's neck, laid down upon the bed; then having concealed him, and hid him from the sight of her female friends and companions, she began to attend upon him in secret; after some time her friends and companions found out that Unroodrù had come there, and that she passed the day and night in amorous enjoyment with her lord. One day Ookha's mother came to look after her daughter; and without being observed saw her seated very happily, and playing at <i>choupur</i> in a house with a very handsome young man. On perceiving this, she returned home, without saying a word, on tiptoe, and in profound silence; highly delighted and uttering benedictions. Some days afterwards Ookha seeing her husband asleep, came forth blushing from the house, and thinking to herself, "I hope that no one from not seeing me will imagine, that I remain in the hose for my husband's sake."</p>  
 <p>O great king! Ookha cleaving her husband alone, went off; but could not stay away from him, she returned again to the house, and shutting the doors, engaged in amorous diversion. On observing this act, the door-keepers said to each other, "Brother! what is the reason of the Raja's daughter having to-day come out of the house after remaining there so long, and returning again immediately?" One of them remarked, "Brother! for some days past I have observed the doors of Ookha's house shut day and night, and there is some man inside, who sometimes laughs and talks with her, and sometimes plays at choupur." Another said, "If this be true, let us go and mention the matter to Banasoor; why</p>  
 <p><a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 308</font></a></p>  
 <p>should we, knowing these circumstances, remain sitting quietly here?" One of them said, "Let us not mention the matter, remain all of you at some distance from the house, let what will happen; no one can control the future, speak not a word about what the young lady may do, but remain silent spectators of all that happens."</p>  
 <p>O great king! whilst the door-keepers were thus conversing with each other, Banasoor came wandering about there, accompanied by several strong, powerful men; and as he looked up at the top of the house, not perceiving the flag, which Shivù Jee had given, said, "What has happened to remove the flag hence?" The door-keepers replied, "O great king! it is now many days since the flag fell, and was broken to pieces." On hearing this, and calling to mind what Shivù Jee had said, Banasoor became thoughtful, and exclaimed, "When did the flag fall, some enemy has come, and carried it off." When Banasoor had thus spoken, a door-keeper came into his presence: and joining his hands, and bending his head, said, "I have an important matter to communicate, which I cannot mention unless I obtain your permission to do so." Banasoor granting permission, told him to communicate what he had to say. The door-keeper then said, "O great king! excuse my fault, we have observed for some days past, that a man has come into your daughter's house; day and night he converses with her, we have not discovered what man he is, and whence he has come, and what he does."</p>  
 <p>On hearing this authentic statement, Banasoor was exceedingly angry, and seizing his arms, went silently and alone to Ookha's house; concealing himself, he saw on his arrival a man of a black colour, very handsome and dressed in yellow, lying fast asleep with Ookha. Banasoor thought to himself, "It would be a sin to kill a sleeping man."</p>  
 <p>O great king! with these thoughts in his mind, Banasoor stationed several guards there, and having told them to inform</p>  
 <p><a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 309</font></a></p>  
 <p>him when the man awoke; came home, and holding a court, and having summoned all his demons, began to say, "My enemy has arrived, take the whole of your army and go and surround Ookha's house, I will come also by and bye."</p>  
 <p>On receiving Banasoor's order, the demons all came and surrounded Ookha's house; whilst in the mean while, Unroodrù and the Raja's daughter having awoke, began to play again at choupur. Whilst they were engaged at the game, Ookha saw thundering clouds collected from all quarters, lightning began to flash, frogs, peacocks and sparrow hawks began to utter cries.</p>  
 <p>O great king! on hearing the sparrow hawk's cry, the Raja's daughter said, leaning on the neck of her beloved, "O sparrow hawk! do not call out thus, leave off this language of separation." In the mean while, some one came and said to Banasoor, "O great king! thy enemy has awoke." On hearing mention made of his enemy, Banasoor rose in great wrath; and taking arms with him, went and stood at Ookha's door, and began to peep inside. After looking some time, Banasoor called out loudly, "Ho! who are you inside the house, rich in appearance, fascinating as Cupid, with lotus-like eyes, and dressed in yellow? What thief will come forth? How will he possibly escape from me?"</p>  
 <p>O great king! when Banasoor had thus bawled out, Ookha and Unroodrù, on seeing and hearing him were greatly disquieted. The Raja's daughter being perplexed and terrified, heaving deep sighs, said to her husband, "O great king! my father has come to attack us with an army of demons, how will you escape from his hands?" Then Unroodrù was angry, and said, "Wife! be not at all alarmed, I will destroy the whole crowd of evil spirits and demons in a second."</p>  
 <p>Having thus spoken, Unroodrù Jee read incantations from the Vedas, and sent for a stone a hundred and eight hands long, and taking it in his hand, coming forth and joining the army, challenged Banasoor. On his coming out to give the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 310</font></a></p>  
 <p>challenge, Banasoor bent his bow and rushed upon Unroodrù Jee with his whole forces, just as a swarm of honey bees would rush upon any one. When the demons began to discharge all sorts of weapons, Unroodrù Jee was enraged, and began to deal about several such forcible blows with the stone, that the whole army of demons became broken and dispersed like the scum upon stagnant pools: some were killed, others wounded, and all who escaped whole, fled from the field. Banasoor afterwards rallied them, and renewed the fight.</p>  
 <p>O great king! all the weapons the demons discharged, fell in every direction, but not one touched Unroodrù; the weapons, which would have fallen upon Unroodrù, the edge of the stone cut them off half way. The strokes of the stone could not be endured, inflicting wounds like those inflicted by Indrù, the lord of the gods, with a thunderbolt; heads were split in two by a blow of it, thighs were broken and arms and bodies cut through. When the battle had lasted some time, and Banasoor was left alone, the rest of the army having been cut in pieces, he was astonished, and laid hold of and fastened Unroodrù with a running noose, saying to himself, "Now shall I conquer this invincible man?"</p>  
 <p>Having proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja Pureechit,--O great king! when Banasoor fastened Unroodrù in a running noose, and took him to his court, Unroodrù thought to himself, "Whatever troubles may befal me, it is not right to falsify what Bruhmù has said; for if I were to escape by force from the running noose, he would be dishonoured; I ought, therefore, to remain bound." And Banasoor kept constantly saying, "Youth! I will put thee to death presently; if thou hast any one to assist thee, send for him." Mean while, Ookha having heard of her husband's condition, said to Chitrekha, "Friend! a curse will fall upon me, if I eat, drink and sleep at my ease, whilst my husband remains in affliction." Chitrekha replied, "Friend! be not at all anxious, no one will be able to do any harm to your</p>  
 <p><a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 311</font></a></p>  
 <p>husband; banish all care, for Shree Krishnù Chund and Bulram Jee will soon come to the attack, accompanied by all the descendants of Judoo; and, having exterminated the army of demons, will release and take away with them you and Unroodrù; it is their custom to carry off by force and stratagem, in any way they can, all the pretty daughters of Rajas they hear of; this is the grandson of him, who carried off Rookmunee, the daughter of Raja Bheekmuk, after having fought with the very powerful and renowned Rajas Sissoopal and Joorasindhoo, in like manner, they will take you off also; be not, therefore, at all apprehensive." Ookha said, "I cannot endure this affliction. They have bound my husband in a running noose and carried him off; a poisonous flame, in consequence thereof, burns up my body. How shall I be able to enjoy peaceful repose, and how can my eyes behold the grief of my beloved? Why should I live, since he, who is dearest to me, has been plunged in calamity. I will neither eat nor drink--now Banasoor destroy my husband! O grant me, Banasoor, an asylum for my husband; (that is, spare his life,) whatever is to be, will happen, what can any one say to prevent it? I will not respect the world nor the Vedas, but will consider my husband's grief and happiness as my own."</p>  
 <p>O great king! when Ookha had thus spoken to Chitrekha, she went to her husband, and sat down near him, without fear or alarm. Some one then went and said to Banasoor, "O great king! your daughter has left the house, and gone to that man." When Banasoor heard this, he sent for his son, Uskundh, saying to him, "Son! bring away your sister from the court, and take her into the house, and confine her there, and do not allow her to go out." On receiving his father's order, Uskundh went to his sister, and spoke very angrily to her, "What is this you have done, you wicked creature, throwing aside all respect for the world, and consideration for your own modesty, you low thing? Why should I</p>  
 <p><a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 312</font></a></p>  
 <p>kill you (or what death shall I make you die?) It will be a crime, and I fear for my own disgrace." Ookha replied, "Brother! say and do what you please, I have obtained the husband whom Parbutee Jee gave me, whom else shall I run after, leaving him, and thereby bring disgraceful abuse upon myself? Women of low degree abandon their husbands: this is the common custom of the world, and always has been so. If a woman is disgraced by living with him to whom the deity has united her, she must submit."</p>  
 <p>O great king! on hearing these words, Uskundh was enraged, and seizing her by the hand, carried off Ookha thence to the house, and did not allow her to leave it; he afterwards took Unroodrù Jee also thence to some other place and confined him. At that time Unroodrù was in great affliction at being separated from his wife, and the Raja's daughter denied herself all food and drink in the absence of her husband, and began to perform a very severe penance. Some days after this, one day Narud Jee, the sage, went first to Unroodrù and explained to him "Not to be at all anxious, as Shree Krishnù Chund, the root of joy, and Bulram, the abode of happiness, would soon release and take him away thence, after having fought with the evil spirits." He afterwards went to Banasoor and said, "Raja! he, whom you have fastened in the running noose, is the grandson of Shree Krishnù, and the son of Purdiyomun, and his name is Unroodrù. You know the descendants of Judoo well, act according to this knowledge, I have come to put you upon your guard in this matter and have done so." On hearing this, Banasoor allowed Narud Jee to take leave, saying to him, "Narud Jee! I know all about it."</p>
