 <p>1. JOY, Mightiest Indra, known and marked, sprung most from Soma-draughts, wherewith<br> Thou smitest down the greedy fiend, for that we long.<br> 2 Wherewith thou bolpest Adhrigu, the great Daśagva, and the God<br> Who stirs the sunlight, and the sea, for that we long.<br> 3 Wherewith thou dravest forth like cars Sindhu and all the mighty floods<br> To go the way ordained by Law, for that we long.<br> 4 Accept this laud for aid, made pure like oil, thou Caster of the Stone,<br> Whereby even in a moment thou hast waxen great.<br> 5 Be pleased, Song-lover, with this song it flows abundant like the sea.<br> Indra, with all thy succours thou hast waxen great.<br> 6 The God who from afar hath sent gifts to maintain our friendship's bond,<br> Thou. spreading them like rain from heaven, hast waxen great.<br> 7 The beams that mark him have grown strong, the thunder rests between his arms,<br> When, like the Sun, he hath increased both Heaven and Earth.<br> 8 When, Mighty Lord of Heroes, thou didst cat a thousand buffaloes,<br> Then grew and waxed exceeding great thine Indra-power.<br> 9 Indra consumeth with the rays of Sūrya the malicious man:<br> Like Agni conquering the woods, he hath grown strong.<br> 10 This newest thought of ours that suits the time approaches unto thee:<br> Serving, beloved in many a place it metes and marks.<br> 11 The pious germ of sacrifice directly purifies the soul.<br> By Indra's lauds it waxes great, it metes and marks.<br> 12 Indra who wins the friend hath spread himself to drink the Soma-draught:<br> Like worshipper's dilating praise; it metes and marks.<br> 13 He whom the sages, living men, have gladdened, offering up their hymns,<br> Hath swelled like oil of sacrifice in Agni's mouth.<br> 14 Aditi also hath brought forth a hymn for Indra, Sovran Lord:<br> The work of sacrifice for help is glorified.<br> 15 The ministering priests have sung their songs for aid and eulogy:<br> God, thy Bays turn not from the rite which Law ordains.<br> 16 If, Indra, thou drink Soma by Viṣṇu's or Tṛta Āptya's side,<br> Or with the Maruts take delight in flowing drops;<br> 17 Or, Śakra, if thou gladden thee afar or in the sea of air,<br> Rejoice thee in this juice of ours, in flowing drops.<br> 18 Or, Lord of Heroes if thou aid the worshipper who shed; the, juice,<br> Or him whose laud delights thee, and his flowing drops.<br> 19 To magnify the God, the God, Indra, yea, Indra for your help,<br> And promptly end the sacrifice-this have they gained.<br> 20 With worship, him whom men adore, with Soma, him who drinks it most,<br> Indra with lauds have they increasedthis have they gained.<br> 21 His leadings are with power and might and his instructions manifold:<br> He gives the worshipper all wealth: this have they gained.<br> 22 For slaying Vṛtra have the Gods set Indra in the foremost place.<br> Indra the choral bands have sung, for vigorous strength.<br> 23 We to the Mighty with our might, with lauds to him who hears our call,<br> With holy hymns have sung aloud, for vigorous strength.<br> 24 Not earth, nor heaven, nor firmaments contain the Thunder-wielding God:<br> They shake before his violent rush and vigorous strength.<br> 25 What time the Gods, O Indra, get thee foremost in the furious fight,<br> Then thy two beautiful Bay Steeds carried thee on.<br> 26 When Vṛtra, stayer of the floods, thou si"est, Thundeicr with might,<br> Then thy two beautiful Bay Steeds carried thee on.<br> 27 When Viṣṇu, through thine energy, strode wide those three great steps of his,<br> Then thy two beautiful Bay Steeds carried thee on.<br> 28 When thy two beautiful Bay Steeds grew great and greater day by day,<br> Even then all creatures that had life bowed down to thee.<br> 29 When, Indra, all the Marut folk humbly submitted them to thee,<br> Even then all creatures that had life bowed down to thee.<br> 30 When yonder Sun, that brilliant light, thou settest in the heaven above,<br> Even then all creatures that had life bowed down to thee.<br> 31 To thee, O Indra, with this thought the sage lifts up this eulogy,<br> Akin and leading as on foot to sacrifice.<br> 32 When in thine own dear dwelling all gathered have lifted up the voice<br> Milk-streams at worship's central spot, for sacrifice,<br> 33 As Priest, O Indra, give us wealth in brave men and good steeds ana kine<br> That we may first remember thee for sacrifice.</p>
