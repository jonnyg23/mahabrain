who Is most prompt with sacred gifts,<br> Set thou beneath the Gods, Vasu, above mankind, the speech of the intelligent.<br> 13 He who with sacrificial gifts or homage bringeth very skilful Agni nigh,<br> Or him who flashes fast with song,<br> 14 The mortal who with blazing fuel, as his laws command, adores the Perfect God,<br> Blest with his thoughts in splendour shall exceed all men, as though he overpassed the floods.<br> 15 Give us the splendour, Agni, which may overcome each greedy fiend in our abode,<br> The wrath of evil-hearted folk.<br> 16 That, wherewith Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman, the Aśvins, Bhaga give us light,<br> That may we, by thy power finding best furtherance, worship, O Indra, helped by thee.<br> 17 O Agni, most devout are they, the sages who have set thee Sage exceeding wise,<br> O God, for men to look upon:<br> 18 Who have arranged thine altar Blessed God, at morn brought thine oblation, pressed the juice.<br> They by their deeds of strength have won diem, mighty wealth, who have set all their hope in thee.<br> 19 -May Agni worshipped bring us bliss, may the gift, Blessed One, and sacrifice bring bliss;<br> Yea, may our praises bring us bliss.<br> 20 Show forth the mind that brings success in war with fiends, wherewith thou conquerest in fight.<br> Bring down the many firm hopes of our enemies, and let us vanquish with thine aid.<br> 21 I praise with song the Friend of man, whom Gods sent down to be herald and messenger,<br> Best worshipper, bearer of our gifts.<br> 22 Thou unto sharp-toothed Agni, Young and Radiant God, proclaimest with thy song the feast-<br> Agni, who for our sweet strains moulds heroic strength when sacred oil is offered him,<br> 23 While, served with sacrificial oil, now upward and now downward Agni moves his sword,<br> As doth the Asura his robe.<br> 24 The God, the Friend of man, who bears our gifts to heaven, the God with his sweet-smelling mouth,<br> Distributes, skilled in sacrifice, his precious things, Invoking Priest, Immortal God.<br> 25 Son of Strength, Agni, if thou wert the mortal, bright as Mitra, I worshipped with our gifts!<br> And I were the Immortal God<br> 26 I would not give thee up, Vasu, to calumny, or misery, O Bounteous One.<br> My worshipper should feel no hunger or distress, nor, Agni, should he live in sin.<br> 27 Like a son cherished in his father's houi§e, let our oblation rise unto the Gods.<br> 28 With thine immediate aid may I, excellent Agni, ever gain my wish<br> A mortal with a God to help.<br> 29 O Agni, by thy wisdom, by thy bounties, by thy leading may I gather wealth.<br> Excellent Agni, thou art called my Providence: delight thou to be liberal.<br> 30 Agni, he conquers by thine aid that brings him store of noble heroes and great strength,<br> Whose bond of friendship is thy choice.<br> 31 Thy spark is black and crackling, kindled in due time, O Bounteous, it is taken up.<br> Thou art the dear Friend of the mighty Mornings: thou shinest in glimmerings of the night.<br> 32 We Sobharis have come to him, for succour, who is good to help with thousand powers,<br> The Sovran, Trasadasyu's Friend.<br> 33 O Agni, thou on whom all other fires depend, as branches on the parent stem,<br> I make the treasures of the folk, like songs, mine own, while I exalt thy sovran might.<br> 34 The mortal whom, Ādityas, ye, Guilelew, lead to the farther bank<br> Of all the princes, Bounteous Ones<br> 35 Whoeer he be, Man-ruling Kings! the Regent of the race of men-<br> May we, O Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman, like him be furtherers of your law.<br> 36 A gift of fifty female slaves hath Trasadasyu given me, Purukutsa's son,<br> Most liberal, kind, lord of the brave.<br> 37 And Śyāva too for me led forth a strong steed at Suvastu's ford:<br> A herd of three times seventy kine, good lord of gifts, he gave to me.</p>
