 <p>1. DRINK Soma, Lord of Bays, and let it cheer thee: Indra, the stone, like a well guided courser,<br> Directed by the presser's arms hath pressed it.<br> 2 So let the draught of joy, thy dear companion, by which, O Lord of Bays, thou slayest foemen,<br> Delight thee, Indra, Lord of princely treasures.<br> 3 Mark closely, Maghavan, the words I utter, this eulogy recited by Vasiṣṭha:<br> Accept the prayers I offer at thy banquet.<br> 4 Hear thou the call of the juice-drinking press-stone: hear thou the Brahman's hymn who sings and lauds thee.<br> Take to thine inmost self these adorations.<br> 5 I know and neer forget the hymns and praises of thee, the Conqueror, and thy strength immortal.<br> Thy name I ever utter. Self-Refulgent<br> 6 Among mankind many are thy libations, and many a time the pious sageinvokes thee.<br> O Maghavan, be not long distant from us.<br> 7 All these libations are for thee, O Hero: to thee I offer these my prayers. that strengthen.<br> Ever, in every place, must men invoke thee.<br> 8 Never do men attain, O Wonder-Worker, thy greatness, Mighty One, who must be lauded,<br> Nor, Indra, thine heroic power and bounty.<br> 9 Among all Ṛṣis, Indra, old and recent, who have engendered hymns as sacred singers,<br> Even with us be thine auspicious friendships. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
