 <p>1. GREAT art thou, Indra; yea, the earth, with gladness, and heaven confess to thee thine high dominion.<br> Thou in thy vigour having slaughtered Vṛtra didst free the floods arrested by the Dragon.<br> 2 Heaven trembled at the birth of thine effulgence; Earth trembled at the fear of thy displeasure.<br> The stedfast mountains shook in agitation . the waters flowed, and desert spots were flooded.<br> 3 Hurling his bolt with might he cleft the mountain, while, putting forth his strength, he showed his vigour.<br> He slaughtered Vṛtra with his bolt, exulting, and, their lord slain, forth flowed the waters swiftly.<br> 4 Thy Father Dyaus esteemed himself a hero: most noble was the work of Indra's Maker,<br> His who begat the strong bolt's Lord who roareth, immovable like earth from her foundation.<br> 5 He who alone oerthrows the world of creatures, Indra the peoples' King, invoked of many-<br> Verily all rejoice in him, extolling the boons which Maghavan the God hath sent them.<br> 6 All Soma juices are his own for ever, most gladdening draughts are ever his, the Mighty,<br> Thou ever wast the Treasure-Lord of treasures: Indra, thou lettest all folk share thy bounty.<br> 7 Moreover, when thou first wast born, O Indra, thou struckest terror into all the people.<br> Thou, Maghavan, rentest with thy bolt the Dragon who lay against the waterfloods of heaven.<br> 8 The ever-slaying, bold and furious Indra, the bright bolt's Lord, infinite, strong and mighty,<br> Who slayeth Vṛtra and acquireth booty, giver of blessings, Maghavan the bounteous:<br> 9 Alone renowned as Maghavan in battles, he frighteneth away assembled armies.<br> He bringeth us the booty that he winneth may we, well-loved, continue in his friendship.<br> 10 Renowned is he when conquering and when slaying: 'fis he who winneth cattle in the combat.<br> When Indra hardeneth his indignation all that is fixed and all that moveth fear him.<br> 11 Indra hath won all kine, all gold, all horses,Maghavan, he who breaketh forts in pieces;<br> Most manly with these men of his who help him, dealing out wealth and gathering the treasure.<br> 12 What is the care of Indra for his Mother, what cares he for the Father who begat him?<br> His care is that which speeds his might in conflicts, like wind borne onward by the clouds that thunder.<br> 13 Maghavan makes the settled man unsettled: he scatters dust that he hath swept together,<br> Breaking in pieces like Heaven armed with lightning: Maghavan shall enrich the man who lauds h;m.<br> 14 He urged the chariot-wheel of Sūrya forward: Etaśa, speeding on his way, he rested.<br> Him the black undulating cloud bedeweth, in this mid-air's depth, at the base of darkness,<br> 15 As in the night the sacrificing priest.<br> 16 Eager for booty, craving strength and horses, we-singers stir Indra, the strong, for friendship,<br> Who gives the wives we seek, whose succour fails not, to hasten, like a pitcher to the fountain.<br> 17 Be thou our guardian, show thyself our kinsman, watching and blessing those who pour the Soma;<br> As Friend, as Sire, most fatherly of fathers giving the suppliant vital strength and freedom.<br> 18 Be helping Friend of those who seek thy friendship . give life, when lauded, Indra, to the singer.<br> For, Indra, we the priests have paid thee worship, exalting thee with these our sacrifices.<br> 19 Alone, when Indra Maghavan is lauded, he slayeth many neer-resisted Vṛtras.<br> Him in whose keeping is the well-loved singer never do Gods or mortals stay or hinder.<br> 20 Een so let Maghavan, the loud-voiced Indra, give us true blessings, foeless, men's upholder.<br> King of all creatures, give us glory amply, exalted glory due to him who lauds thee.<br> 21 Now, Indra! lauded, glorified with praises, let power swell high like rivers for the singer.<br> For thee a new hymn, Lord of Bays! is fashioned. May we, car-borne, through song be victors ever.</p>
