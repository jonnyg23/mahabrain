 <p>1. AGNI, come hither with thy fires; we choose thee as Invoking Priest.<br> Let the extended ladle full of oil balm thee, best Priest, to sit on sacred grass.<br> 2 For unto thee, O Aṅgiras, O Son of Strength, move ladles in the sacrifice.<br> To Agni, Child of Force, whose locks drop oil, we seek, foremost in sacrificial rites.<br> 3 Agni, thou art Disposer, Sage, Herald, bright God! and worshipful,<br> Best offerer, cheerful, to be praised in holy rites, pure Lord! by singers with their hymns.<br> 4 Most Youthful and Eternal, bring the longing Gods to me, the guileless, for the feast.<br> Come, Vasu, to the banquet that is well-prepared: rejoice thee, gracious, with our songs.<br> 5 Famed art thou, Agni, far and wide, Preserver, righteous, and a Sage.<br> The holy singers, O refulgent kindled God! arrangers, call on thee to come.<br> 6 Shine, Most Resplendent! blaze, send bliss unto the folk, and to thy worshipper<br> Great art thou.<br> So may my princes, with good fires, subduing foes, rest in the keeping of the Gods.<br> 7 O Agni, as thou burnest down to earth even high-grown underwood,<br> So, bright as Mitra is, burn him who injures us, him who plots ill against thy friend.<br> 8 Give us not as a prey to mortal enemy, nor to the wicked friend of fiends.<br> With conquering guards, auspicious, unassailable, protect us, O Most Youthful God.<br> 9 Protect us, Agni, through the first, protect us through the second hymn,<br> Protect us through three hymns, O Lord of Power and Might, through four hymns, Vasu, guard thou us.<br> 10 Preserve us from each fiend who brings the Gods no gift, preserve thou us in deeds of strength:<br> For we possess in thee the nearest Friend of all, for service of the Gods and weal.<br> 11 O Holy Agni, give us wealth renowned with men and strengthening life.<br> Bestow on us, O Helper, that which many crave, more glorious still by righteousness;<br> 12 Wherewith we may oercome our rivals in the war, oerpowering the foe's designs.<br> So wax thou by our food, O Excellent in strength. Quicken our thoughts that find out wealth.<br> 13 Agni is even as a bull who whets and brandishes his horns.<br> Well-sharpened are his jaws which may not be withstood: the Child of Strength hath powerful teeth.<br> 14 Not to be stayed, O Bull, O Agni, are thy teeth when thou art spreading far and wide.<br> Make our oblations duly offered up, O Priest, and give us store of precious things.<br> 15 Thou liest in the wood: from both thy Mothers mortals kindle thee.<br> Unweariedly thou bearest up the offerer's gifts, then shinest bright among the Gods.<br> 16 And so the seven priests, O Agni, worship thee, Free-giver, Everlasting One.<br> Thou cleavest through the rock with heat and fervent glow. Agni, rise up above the men.<br> 17 For you let us whose grass is trimmed call Agni, Agni, restless God.<br> Let us whose food is offered call to all the tribes Agni the Invoking Priest of men.<br> 18 Agni, with noble psalm that tells his wish he dwells, thinking on thee who guardest him.<br> Speedily bring us strength of many varied sorts to be most near to succour us.<br> 19 Agni, Praise-singer! Lord of men, God burner-up of Rākṣasas,<br> Mighty art thou, the ever-present Household-Lord, Home-friend and Guardian from the sky.<br> 20 Let no fiend come among us, O thou rich in light, no spell of those who deal in spells.<br> To distant pastures drive faint hunger: far away, O Agni, chase the demons friends.</p>
