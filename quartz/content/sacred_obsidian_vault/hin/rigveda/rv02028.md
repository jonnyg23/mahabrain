 <p>1. THIS laud of the self-radiant wise Āditya shall be supreme oer all that is in greatness.<br> 1 beg renown of Varuṇa the Mighty, the God exceeding kind to him who worships.<br> 2 Having extolled thee. Varuṇa, with thoughtful care may we have high fortune in thy service,<br> Singing thy praises like the fires at coming, day after day, of mornings rich in cattle.<br> 3 May we be in thy keeping, O thou Leader wide-ruling Varuṇa, Lord of many heroes.<br> O sons of Aditi, for ever faithful, pardon us, Gods, admit us to your friendship.<br> 4 He made them flow, the Āditya, the Sustainer: the rivers run by Varuṇa's commandment.<br> These feel no weariness, nor cease from flowing: swift have they flown like birds in air around us.<br> 5 Loose me from sin as from a bond that binds me: may we swell, Varuṇa, thy spring of Order.<br> Let not my thread, while I weave song, be severed, nor my work's sum, before the time, be shattered.<br> 6 Far from me, Varuṇa, remove all danger accept me graciously, thou Holy Sovran.<br> Cast off, like cords that hold a calf, my troubles: I am not even mine eyelid's lord without thee.<br> 7 Strike us not, Varuṇa, with those dread weapons which, Asura, at thy bidding wound the sinner.<br> Let us not pass away from light to exile. Scatter, that we may live, the men who hate us<br> 8 O mighty Varuṇa, now and hereafter, even as of old, will we speak forth our worship.<br> For in thyself, invincible God, thy statutes neer to be moved are fixed as on a mountain.<br> 9 Move far from me what sins I have committed: let me not suffer, King, for guilt of others.<br> Full many a morn remains to dawn upon us: in these, O Varuṇa, while we live direct us.<br> 10 O King, whoever, be he friend or kinsman, hath threatened me affrighted in my slumber-<br> If any wolf or robber fain would harm us, therefrom, O Varuṇa, give thou us protection.<br> 11 May I not live O Varuṇa, to witness my wealthy, liberal dear friend's destitution.<br> King, may I never lack well-ordered riches. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
