 <p>1. HE who, just born, chief God of lofty spirit by power and might became the Gods protector,<br> Before whose breath through greatness of his valour the two worlds trembled, He, O men, is Indra.<br> 2 He who fixed fast and firm the earth that staggered, and set at rest the agitated mountains,<br> Who measured out the air's wide middle region and gave the heaven support, He, men, is Indra.<br> 3 Who slew the Dragon, freed the Seven Rivers, and drove the kine forth from the cave of Vala,<br> Begat the fire between two stones, the spoiler in warriors battle, He, O men, is Indra.<br> 4 By whom this universe was made to tremble, who chased away the humbled brood of demons,<br> Who, like a gambler gathering his winnings seized the foe's riches, He, O men, is Indra.<br> 5 Of whom, the Terrible, they ask, Where is He? or verily they say of him, He is not.<br> He sweeps away, like birds, the foe's possessions. Have faith in him, for He, O men, is Indra.<br> 6 Stirrer to action of the poor and lowly, of priest, of suppliant who sings his praises;<br> Who, fair-faced, favours him who presses Soma with stones made ready, He, O men, is Indra.<br> 7 He under whose supreme control are horses, all chariots, and the villages, and cattle;<br> He who gave being to the Sun and Morning, who leads the waters, He, O men, is Indra.<br> 8 To whom two armies cry in close encounter, both enemies, the stronger and the weaker;<br> Whom two invoke upon one chariot mounted, each for himself, He, O ye men, is Indra.<br> 9 Without whose help our people never conquer; whom, battling, they invoke to give them succour;<br> He of whom all this world is but the copy, who shakes things moveless, He, O men, is Indra.<br> 10 He who hath smitten, ere they knew their danger, with his hurled weapon many grievous sinners;<br> Who pardons not his boldness who provokes him, who slays the Dasyu, He, O men, is Indra.<br> 11 He who discovered in the fortieth autumn Śambara as he dwelt among the mountains;<br> Who slew the Dragon putting forth his vigour, the demon lying there, He, men, is Indra.<br> 12 Who with seven guiding reins, the Bull, the Mighty, set free the Seven great Floods to flow at pleasure;<br> Who, thunder-armed, rent Rauhiṇa in pieces when scaling heaven, He, O ye men, is Indra.<br> 13 Even the Heaven and Earth bow down before him, before his very breath the mountains tremble.<br> Known as the Soma-drinker, armed with thunder, who wields the bolt, He, O ye men, is Indra.<br> 14 Who aids with favour him who pours the Soma and him who brews it, sacrificer, singer.<br> Whom prayer exalts, and pouring forth of Soma, and this our gift, He, O ye men, Is Indra.<br> 15 Thou verily art fierce and true who sendest strength to the man who brews and pours libation.<br> So may we evermore, thy friends, O Indra, speak loudly to the synod with our heroes.</p>
