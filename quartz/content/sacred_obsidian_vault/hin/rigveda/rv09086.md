THY gladdening draughts, O Pavamana, urged by song flow swiftly of themselves like sons of fleet-foot mares.<br> The drops of Soma juice, those eagles of the heavens, most cheering, rich in meath, rest in the reservoir.<br> 2 As rapid chariot-steeds, so turned in several ways have thine exhilarating juices darted forth,<br> Soma-drops rich in meath, waves, to the Thunder-armed, to Indra, like milch-kine who seek their calf with milk.<br> 3 Like a steed urged to battle, finder of the light; speed onward to the cloud-born reservoir of heaven,<br> A Steer that oer the woolly surface seeks the sieve, Soma while purified for Indra's nourishment.<br> 4 Fleet as swift steeds, thy drops, divine, thought-swift, have been, O Pavamana, poured with milk into the vat.<br> The Ṛṣis have poured in continuous Soma drops, ordainers who adorn thee, Friend whom Ṛṣis love.<br> 5 O thou who seest all things, Sovran as thou art and passing strong, thy rays encompass all abodes.<br> Pervading with thy natural powers thou flowest on, and as the whole world's Lord, O Soma, thou art King.<br> 6 The beams of Pavamana, sent from earth and heaven, his ensigns who is ever steadfast, travel round.<br> When

Gods.<br> He speeds with thousand currents to the reservoir, and passes through the filter bellowing as a bull.<br> 8 The Sovran dips him in the seain and the streams, and set in rivers with the waters' wave moves on.<br> High heaven's Sustainer at the central point of earth, raised on the fleecy surface Pavamana stands.<br> 9 He on whose high decree the heavens and earth depend nath roared and thundered like the summit of the sky.<br> Soma flows on obtaining Indra's friendly love, and, as they purify him, settles in the jars.<br> 10 He, light of sacrifice distils delicious meath, most wealthy, Father and begetter of the Gods.<br> He, gladdening, best of Cheerers, juice!hat Indra loves, enriches with mysterious treasure earth and heaven.<br> 11 The vigorous and far-seeing one, the Lord of heaven, flows, shouting to the beaker, with his thousand streams.<br> Coloured like gold he rests in seats where Mitra dwells, the Steer made beautiful by rivers and by sheep.<br> 12 In forefront of the rivers Pavamana speeds, in forefront of the hymn, foremost among the kine.<br> He shares the mighty booty in the van of war: the well-armed Steer is purified by worshippers.<br> 13

earth and heaven.<br> 14 He, clad in mail that reaches heaven, the Holy One, filling the firmament stationed amid the worlds,<br> Knowing. the realm of light, hath come to us in rain: he summons to

maids, and gains the beaker by a course of bundred paths.<br> 17 Your songs, exhilarating, tuneful, uttering praise, are come into the placns where the people meet.<br> Worshippers have exalted Soma with their hymns, and milch kine have come near to meet him with their milk.<br> 18 O Soma, Indu, while they cleanse thee, pour on us accumulateds Plentiful, nutritious food,<br> Which, ceaseless, thrice a day shall yield us hero power enriched with store of nourishment, and strength, and Meath.<br> 19 Far-seeing Soma flows, the Steer, the Lord of hymns, the Furtherer of day, of morning, and of heaven.<br> Mixt with the streams he caused the beakers to resound, and with the singers' aid they entered Indra's heart.<br> 20 On, with the prudent singers, flows the ancient Sage and guided by the men hath roared about the vats.<br> Producing Trita's name, may he pour forth the meath, that Vāyu and that Indra may become his Friends.<br> 21 He, being purified, hath made the Mornings shine: this,

through the fleece.<br> 27 The ceaseless watery fountains with their hundred streams sing, as they hasten near, to him the Golden-hued<br> Him, clad in robes of milk, swift fingers beautify on the third height and in the luminous realm of heaven.<br> 28 These are thy generations of celestial seed thou art the Sovran Lord of all the world of life.<br> This universe, O Pavamana, owns thy sway;

meath.<br> They seize the flying Steer at the stream's breathing-place: cleansing with gold they grasp the Animal herein.<br> 44 Sing forth to Pavamana skilled in holy song: the juice is flowing

song.<br> 47 Thy strearns that flow forth rapidly collected run over the fine fleece of the sheep as thou art cleansed.<br> When, Indu, thou art. balmed with milk within the bowl, thou sinkest in the jars, O Soma, when expressed.<br> 48 Winner of power, flow, Soma, worthy of our laud: run onward to the fleece as well-beloved meath.<br> Destroy, O Indu, all voracious Rākṣasas.
