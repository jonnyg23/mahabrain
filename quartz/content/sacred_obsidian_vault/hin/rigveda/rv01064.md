 <p>1. BRING for the manly host, wise and majestical, O Nodhas, for the Maruts bring thou a pure gift.<br> I deck my songs as one deft-handed, wise in mind prepares the water that hath power in solemn rites.<br> 2 They spring to birth, the lofty Ones, the Bulls of Heaven, divine, the youths of Rudra, free from spot and stain;<br> The purifiers, shining brightly even as suns, awful of form like giants, scattering rain-drops down.<br> 3 Young Rudras, demon-slayers, never growing old, they have waxed, even as mountains, irresistible.<br> They make all beings tremble with their mighty strength, even the very strongest, both of earth and heaven.<br> 4 With glittering ornaments they deck them forth for show; for beauty on their breasts they bind their chains of gold.<br> The lances on their shoulders pound to pieces; they were born together, of themselves, the Men of Heaven.<br> 5 Loud roarers, giving strength, devourers of the foe, they make the winds, they make the lightnings with their powers.<br> The restless shakers drain the udders of the sky, and ever wandering round fill the earth full with milk.<br> 6 The bounteous Maruts with the fatness dropping milk fill full the waters which avail in solemn rites.<br> They lead, as twere, the Strong Horse forth, that it may rain: they milk the thundering, the never-failing spring.<br> 7 Mighty, with wondrous power and marvellously bright, selfstrong like mountains, ye glide swiftly on your way.<br> Like the wild elephants ye eat the forests up when ye assume your strength among the bright red flames.<br> 8 Exceeding wise they roar like lions mightily, they, all-possessing, are beauteous as antelopes;<br> Stirring the darkness with lances and spotted deer, combined as priests, with serpents' fury through their might.<br> 9 Heroes who march in companies, befriending man, with serpents' ire through strength, ye greet the earth and heaven.<br> Upon the seats, O Maruts, of your chariots, upon the cars stands lightning visible as light.<br> 10 Lords of all riches, dwelling in the home of wealth, endowed with mighty vigour, singers loud of voice,<br> Heroes, of powers infinite, armed with strong men's rings, the archers, they have laid the arrow on their arms.<br> 11 They who with golden fellies make the rain increase drive forward the big clouds like wanderers on the way.<br> Self-moving, brisk, unwearied, they oerthrow the firm; the Maruts with bright lances make all things to reel.<br> 12 The progeny of Rudra we invoke with prayer, the brisk, the bright, the worshipful, the active Ones<br> To the strong band of Maruts cleave for happiness, the chasers of the sky, impetuous, vigorous.<br> 13 Maruts, the man whom ye have guarded with your help, he verily in strength surpasseth all mankind.<br> Spoil with his steeds he gaineth, treasure with his men; he winneth honourable strength and prospereth.<br> 14 O Maruts, to the worshippers give glorious strength invincible in battle, brilliant, bringing wealth,<br> Praiseworthy, known to all men. May we foster well, during a hundred winters, son and progeny.<br> 15 Will ye then, O ye Maruts, grant us riches, durable, rich in men, defying onslaught.<br> A hundred, thousandfold, ever increasing? May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.</p>
