 <p>1. Now all my other friends are here assembled: my Sire-in-law alone hath not come hither.<br> So might he eat the grain and drink the Soma, and, satisfied, return unto; his dwelling.<br> 2 Loud belloweth the Bull whose horns are sharpened: upon the height above earth's breadth he standeth.<br> That man I guard and save in all his troubles who fills my flanks when he hath shed the Soma.<br> 3 Men with the stone press out for thee, O Indra, strong, gladdening Soma, and thereof thou drinkest.<br> Bulls they dress for thee, and of these thou eatest when, Maghavan, with food thou art invited.<br> 4 Resolve for me, O singer, this my riddle: The rivers send their swelling water backward:<br> The fox steals up to the approaching lion: the jackal drives the wild-boar from the brushwood.<br> 5 How shall I solve this riddle, I, the simple, declare the thought of thee the Wise and Mighty?<br> Tell us, well knowing, as befits the season: Whitherward is thy prosperous car advancing?<br> 6 Thus do they magnify me, me the mighty higher than even high heaven is my car-pole.<br> I all at once demolish many thousands: my Sire begot me with no foe to match me.<br> 7 Yea, and the Gods have known me also, Indra, as mighty, fierce and strong in every exploit.<br> Exulting with the bolt I slaughtered Vṛtra, and for the offerer oped with might the cow-stall.<br> 8 The Deities approached, they carried axes; splitting the wood they came with their attendants.<br> They laid good timber in the fire-receivers, and burnt the grass up where they found it growing.<br> 9 The hare hath swallowed up the opposing razor: I sundered with a clod the distant mountain.<br> The great will I make subject to the little: the calf shall wax in strength and cat the bullock.<br> 10 There hath the strong-winged eagle left his talon, as a snared lion leaves the trap that caught him.<br> Even the wild steer in his thirst is captured: the leather strap still holds his foot entangled.<br> 11 So may the leather strap their foot entangle who fatten on the viands of the Brahman.<br> They all devour the bulls set free to wander, while they themselves destroy their bodies' vigour.<br> 12 They were well occupied with holy duties who sped in person with their lauds to Soma.<br> Speaking like man, mete to us wealth and booty: in heaven thou hast the name and fame of Hero.</p>
