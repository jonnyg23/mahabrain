 <p>49 With what devotion, winning light, the Rishis came, kindling<br> Agni, to the Holy session,<br> Even with that in heaven I stablish Agni whom men call<br> him whose sacred grass is scattered.<br> 50 Gods, let us follow him with wives beside us, with sons, with<br> brothers, with our gold adornments,<br> Grasping the sky up in the world of virtue, on the third<br> height, the luminous realm of heaven.<br> 51 This Agni mounted up to Speech's Centre, Lord of the<br> Brave, observant, ever-active.<br> Laid on the back of Earth, may he, resplendent, cast under<br> foot those who would fight against us.<br> 52 May this most manly Agni, strength-bestower, giver of thousands,<br> shine with care that fails not.<br> Resplendent in the middle of the water, make thine approach<br> to the celestial mansions.<br> 53 Make him go forth from all sides: meet, Approach ye. O<br> Agni, make the paths for Godward travel.<br> Making the Parents young with life's renewal, the out spun<br> thread in thee have they extended.<br> 54 Wake up, O Agni, thou, and keep him watchful.

 <p>Whereby thou, Agni, bearest wealth in thousands and all<br> precious things.<br> 6 56 This is thine ordered place of birth whence sprung to life<br> thou shonest forth.<br> Knowing this, Agni, rise thou up and cause our riches to<br> increase.<br> 57 Tapa, Tapasya, pair of Dewy Seasons: thou art, etc. (as<br> in XIII. 25).<br> 58 On the sky's back may Parameshthin lay thee, etc. (as in<br> XIV. 14).<br> Thy Lord is Sûrya, etc. (as in XIV. 14).<br> 59 Repeated from XII. 54.<br> 60 Repeated from XII. 55.<br> 61 Repeated from XII. 56.<br> 62 Like a horse neighing, eager for the pasture, when he hath<br> stepped forth from the great enclosure:<br> Then the wind following blows upon his splendour, and,<br> straight, the path is black which thou hast travelled.<br> 63 In Âyu's seat I set thee, in the shadow of the protector in<br> the heart of Ocean,<br> Thee luminous, bright with eyes, thee who illumest the sky,<br> the earth, and air's broad realm between them.<br> 64 On the sky's back may Parameshthin set thee, etc. (as in<br> XIV. 12, substituting sky for air and Sûrya for Vâyu).<br> 65 Thou art the measure of a thousand. Thou art the representative<br> of a thousand. Thou art the equivalent of a thousand. Thou art<br> worth a thousand. Thee for a thousand.</p>
