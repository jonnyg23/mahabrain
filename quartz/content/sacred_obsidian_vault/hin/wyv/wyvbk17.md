 <p>THE food and strength contained in stone and mountain,<br> drink gathered from the plants and trees and waters,<br> That food and strength, Maruts! free-givers, grant us.<br> In the stone is thy hunger. In me is thy food. Let thy<br> pain reach the man we hate.<br> 2 O Agni, may these bricks be mine own milch kine: one, and<br> ten, and ten tens, a hundred, and ten hundreds, a thousand,<br> and ten thousand a myriad, and a hundred thousand,<br> and a million, and a hundred millions, and an ocean middle<br> and end, and a hundred thousand millions, and a billion.<br> May these bricks be mine own milch-kine in yonder world<br> and in this world.<br> 3 Ye are the Seasons, strengthening Law, fixed in due season,<br> strengthening Law,<br> Called Splendid, dropping butter down and honey, yielders<br> of every wish, imperishable.<br> 4 With the lake's mantling need we robe thee, Agni: to us<br> he purifying and auspicious.<br> 5 With cold's investing garb we gird thee, Agni: to us be purifying<br> and auspicious.</p>

Obeisance to thy fiery<br> flame!<br> Let thy shot missiles burn others than us: be thou cleanser,<br> propitious unto us.<br> 12 To him who dwells in man, Hail! To him who dwells in<br> waters, Hail!<br> To him who dwells in sacred grass, Hail! To him who dwells<br> in the wood, Hail! To him who finds the light, Hail!</p>

 <p>13 Worshipful Gods of Gods who merit worship, those who sit<br> down beside their yearly portion,<br> Let them who eat not sacrificial presents drink in this rite<br> of honey and of butter.<br> 14 Those Gods who have attained to Godhead over Gods, they<br> who have led the way in this our holy work,<br> Without whose aid no body whatsoever moves, not on heaven's<br> heights are they, nor on the face of earth.<br> 15 Giver of breath, of out-breath, breath diffusive, giver of<br> lustre, giving room and freedom,<br> Let thy shot missiles burn others than us: be thou cleanser,<br> propitious unto us.<br> 16 May Agni with his sharpened blaze cast down each fierce<br> devouring fiend.<br> May Agni win us wealth by war.<br> 17 He who sate down as Hotar priest, the Rishi, our Father<br> offering, up all things existent<br> He, seeking with his wish a great possession, came among<br> men on earth as archetypal.<br> 18 What was the place whereon he took his station? What was<br> it that upheld him? What the manner,<br> Whence Visvakarman, seeing all, producing the earth, with<br> mighty power disclosed the heavens?</p>

 <p>19 He who hath eyes on all sides round about him, a mouth on<br> all sides, arms and feet on all sides,<br> He the sole God, producing earth and heaven, weldeth them<br> with his arms as wings together.<br> 20 What was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from<br> which they fashioned out the earth and heaven?<br> Ye thoughtful men, inquire within your spirit whereon he<br> stood when he established all things.<br> 21 Thine highest, lowest sacrificial natures, and these thy<br> midmost here, O Visvakarman,<br> Teach thou thy friends at sacrifice, O Blessèd, and come thy-<br> self, exalted, to our worship.<br> 22 Bring those, thyself exalted with oblation, O Visvakarman,<br> Earth and Heaven to worship.<br> Let enemies around us live in folly: here let us have a rich<br> and liberal patron.<br> 23, 24. = VIII. 45, 46.<br> 25 The Father of the eye, the Wise in spirit, created both these<br> worlds submerged in fatness.<br> Then when the eastern ends were firmly fastened, the heavens<br> and the earth were far extended.<br> 26 Mighty in mind and power is Visvakarman, Maker, Disposer,<br> and most lofty Presence.</p>

Victorious,<br> Assailant, and Dispeller, All-Hail!<br> 86 The Maruts, clans divine, became the followers of Indra; as<br> The Maruts, clans divine, became the followers of Indra, so<br> May clans divine and human he the Sacrificer's followers.<br> 87 Drink in the middle of the flood, O Agni, this breast stored<br> full of sap, teeming with water.<br> Welcome this fountain redolent of sweetness. O Courser,<br> enter those thy watery dwelling.<br> 88 Oil hath been mixed: oil is his habitation. In oil he rests:<br> oil is his proper province.<br> Come as thy wont is. O thou Steer, rejoice thee. Bear off<br> the oblation duly consecrated.<br> 89 Forth from the ocean sprang the wave of sweetness: together<br> with the stalk it turned to Amrit,<br> That which is holy oil's mysterious title: but the Gods<br> tongue is truly Amities centre.<br> 90 Let us Declare aloud the name of Ghrita, and at this sacrifice<br> held it up with homage.<br> So let the Brahman hear the praise we utter. This hath the<br> four-horned Buffalo emitted.</p>
