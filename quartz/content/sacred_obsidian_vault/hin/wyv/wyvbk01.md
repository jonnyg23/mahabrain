 <p>2 Strainer of Vasu art thou. Thou art heaven. Earth art<br> thou. Thou art Mâtarisvan's caldron.<br> Thou art the All-container. Stand thou firmly, secure by<br> Law Supreme, and do not totter. Nor be thy Lord of<br> Sacrifice unsteady.<br> 3 Thou art the strainer, hundred-streamed, of Vasu. Thou<br> art the strainer, thousand-streamed, of Vasu.<br> May Savitar the God with Vasu's strainer, thousand-streamed,<br> rightly cleansing, purify thee.<br> 4 Which didst thou milk? This is the cow Visvâyu. This<br> Visvakarman. This is Visvadhâyas.<br> Thee, Indra's share, with Soma do I curdle. Be thou protector<br> of the oblation, Vishnu.<br> 5 I will observe the vow, Lord of Vows, Agni! May I have<br> strength therefor. Success attend me.<br> Now into truth from untruth do I enter.<br> 6 Who is it that unites thee? He unites thee. For what<br> doth he yoke thee? For that he yokes thee.<br> You two for work, you two for its completion.</p>

 <p>7 Scorched are the fiends, scorched the malignant beings.<br> Burnt out are fiends, burnt out malignant beings.<br> Throughout the spacious middle air I travel.<br> 8 Thou art the yoke. Injure thou him who injures. Harm<br> him who harm us. Harm the man we injure.<br> Thou art the Gods best carrier, bound most firmly, filled<br> fullest, welcomest, Gods best invoker.<br> 9 Thou art unbent, receiver of oblations. Stand firmly in thy<br> place and do not totter.<br> Nor be thy Lord of sacrifice unsteady.<br> Let Vishnu mount thee. To the wind lie open. The demons<br> are expelled. Let the five grasp it.<br> 10 By impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,<br> with the hands of Pûshan,<br> Thee dear to Agni, dear to Agni-Soma.<br> 11 Thee for abundance, not for evil spirit. May mine eye look<br> upon the light of heaven.</p>

 <p>May those with doors stand on the earth securely. Throughout<br> the spacious middle air I travel.<br> Upon the navel of the earth I place thee, on Aditi's lap.<br> Protect the oblation, Agni!<br> 12 Ye two are strainers that belong to Vishnu. By Savitar's<br> impulse, with this flawless strainer I purify you with the<br> rays of Sûrya.<br> Bright Waters, flowing forward, foremost drinkers, lead forward<br> now this sacrifice, lead forward the Sacrifice's Lord,<br> the God-devoted Lord of the Sacrifice, the liberal giver.<br> 13 Indra elected you in fight with Vritra: in fight with Vritra<br> you elected Indra.<br> By over-sprinkling are ye consecrated. I sprinkle thee<br> agreeable to Agni. I sprinkle thee welcome to Agni-Soma.<br> Pure for the work divine be ye, and holy, pure for the sacrifice<br> to Gods. Whatever of yours the impure have by their<br> touch polluted, hereby I cleanse for you from all defilement.<br> 14 Giver art thou of happiness. Rejected are fiends, rejected<br> are malignant beings.<br> Aditi's akin art thou. May Aditi receive thee. A wooden<br> stone art thou. Thou art a broad-based stone. May the<br> skin of Aditi receive thee.<br> 15 Body of Agni art thou, the releaser of speech. I seize thee<br> for the Gods enjoyment.<br> A mighty stone art thou, formed out of timber.</p>

 <p>Make ready for the Deities this oblation: with careful preparation<br> make it ready.<br> Havishkrit, come! Havishkrit, come! Havishkrit, come!<br> 16 Thou art a cock whose tongue is sweet with honey. Call to<br> us hither sap and manly vigour.<br> May we with thee in every fight be victors. Rain-grown art<br> thou. May the rain-grown receive thee.<br> Cleared off are fiends, cleared off are evil beings. Expelled<br> are fiends. May Vâyu separate you. May Savitar the<br> God, the golden-handed, with flawless hand unto himself<br> receive you.<br> 17 Bold art thou. Cast away the Corpse-consumer. Drive off<br> the fire that eats raw flesh, O Agni.<br> That which makes offerings to the Gods bring hither.<br> Firm art thou. Make earth firm. For the foe's slaughter I<br> set thee on, devoted to the priesthood, devoted to the<br> nobles and the kinsmen.<br> 18 Agni, do thou accept our holy service.<br> Keeper art thou: make firm the Air's mid-region. For the<br> foe's death I set thee on, devoted to priesthood and nobility<br> and kinsmen.<br> Thou art a stay: uphold the sky securely. For the foe's<br> death, etc.<br> I set thee on for sake of all the regions. Formers of layers<br> are ye, and heap-formers, With Bhrigus and Angirases<br> heat be heated.</p>
