 <p>FAR hath he shone abroad like gold to look on, beaming<br> imperishable life for glory.<br> Agni by vital powers became immortal when his prolific<br> Father Dyaus begat him.<br> 2 Night and Dawn, different in hue, accordant, meeting<br> together, suckle one same infant.<br> Golden between the heaven and earth he shineth. The<br> wealth-possessing Gods supported Agni.<br> 3 The Sapient One arrays himself in every form: for quadruped<br> and biped he hath brought forth good.<br> Excellent Savitar hath looked on heaven's high vault: he<br> shineth after the outgoings of the Dawn.<br> 4 Thou art the goodly-pinioned Bird: thou hast the Trivrit for<br> thy head.<br> Gâyatra is thine eye, thy wings are Brihat and Rathantara.<br> The hymn is self, the metres are his limbs, the formulas his<br> name.<br> The Vâmadevya Sâman is thy form, the Yajñâyajñiya thy<br> tail, the fire-hearths are thy hooves.<br> Thou art the goodly-pinioned Bird: go skyward, soar to<br> heavenly light.</p>

 <p>5 Thou art the riyal-slaying stride of Vishnu. Mount the<br> Gâyatra metre: stride along the earth.<br> Thou art the foe-destroying stride of Vishnu. Mount the<br> Trishtup metre: stride along mid-air.<br> Thou art the traitor-slaying stride of Vishnu. Mount the<br> Jagatî metre: stride along the sky.<br> Thou art the foeman-slaying stride of Vishnu. Mount<br> Anushtup metre: stride along the Quarters.<br> 6 Agni roared out like Dyaus what time he thunders: licking<br> full oft the earth round plants he flickered.<br> At once, when born, he looked about, enkindled: he shineth<br> forth between the earth and heaven.<br> 7 Return to me, thou still-returning Agni, with life, with<br> lustre, progeny, and treasure,<br> With profit, wisdom, riches, and abundance.<br> 8 A hundred, Agni Angiras! be thy ways, a thousand thy<br> returns.<br> With increment of increase bring thou back to us what we<br> have lost. Again bring hitherward our wealth.<br> 9 Return again with nourishment; Agni, again with food and<br> life. Again preserve us from distress.<br> 10 Agni, return with store of wealth. Swell with thine overflowing<br> stream that feedeth all on every side.<br> 11 I brought thee: thou hast entered in. Stand stedfast and<br> immovable.<br> Lot all the people long for thee. Let not thy kingship fall<br> away.<br> 12 Varuna, from the upmost bond release us, let down the<br> lowest and remove the midmost.<br> So in thy holy law may we made sinless belong to Aditi, O<br> thou Âditya.</p>

The Great.<br> 15 Knowing all holy ordinances, Agni, be seated in the lap of<br> this thy mother.<br> Do not with heat or glowing flame consume her: shine thou<br> within her with refulgent lustre.<br> 16 Within this Fire-pan with thy light, O Agni, in thy proper seat,<br> Glowing with warmth, be gracious thou, O Jâtavedas, unto her.<br> 17 Being propitious unto me, O Agni, sit propitiously.<br> Having made all the regions blest, in thine own dwelling<br> seat thyself.<br> 18 First Agni sprang to life from out of heaven, the second<br> time from us came Jâtavedas.<br> Thirdly the Manly-souled was in the waters. The pious<br> lauds and kindles him Eternal.<br> 19 Agni, we know thy three powers in three stations, we know<br> thy forms in many a place divided.<br> We know what name supreme thou hast in secret: we know<br> the source from which thou hast proceeded.<br> 20 The Manly-souled lit thee in sea and waters, Man's Viewer<br> lit thee in the breast of heaven.<br> There as thou stoodest in the third high region the Bulls<br> increased thee in the waters bosom.</p>

This place<br> for him the Fathers have provided.<br> 46 Knowledge art thou: accomplishment of wishes. In me be<br> the fulfilment of thy wishes.<br> Thou art the ashes, thou the mould of Agni.

 <p>47 This is that Agni where the longing Indra took the pressed<br> Soma deep within his body.<br> Winner of spoils in thousands like a courser, with prayer art<br> thou exalted, Jâtavedas.<br> 48 The splendour which is thine in heaven, O Agni, in earth, O<br> Holy One, in plants, in waters,<br> Wherewith thou hast oerspread mid-air's broad region, that<br> light is brilliant, billowy, man-surveying.<br> 49 O Agni, to the flood of heaven thou mountest, thou tallest<br> hither Gods, the thought-inspirers.<br> The waters, those beyond the light of Sûrya, and those<br> that are beneath it here, approach thee.<br> 50 May the Purîshya Agnis in accord with those that spring<br> from floods,<br> May they, benevolent, accept the sacrifice, full, wholesome<br> draughts.<br> 51 As holy food, Agni, to thine invoker give wealth in cattle,<br> lasting, rich in marvels.<br> To us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this<br> thy gracious will to us-ward.<br> 52 This is thine ordered place of birth whence, sprung to life,<br> thou shonest forth.<br> Knowing this, Agni, mount on high and cause our riches to<br> increase.<br> 53 Ranker art thou: Angiras-like sit steady with that Deity.<br> Ranker-round art thou: Angiras-like sit steady with that<br> Deity.</p>
