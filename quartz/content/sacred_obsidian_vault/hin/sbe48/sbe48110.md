 <p>11. And on account of the exclusion of (what is of) another nature (than Brahman).</p>
 <p>Another nature, i. e. the nature of the Pradhâna, and so on. A supplementary passage excludes difference on the part of the Imperishable from the supreme Person. 'That Imperishable, O Gârgî, is unseen but seeing; unheard but hearing; unthought but thinking; unknown but knowing. There is nothing that sees but it, nothing that hears but it, nothing that thinks but it, nothing that knows but it. In that Imperishable, O Gârgî, the ether is woven, warp and woof.' Here the declaration as to the Imperishable being what sees, hears, &amp;c. excludes the non-intelligent Pradhâna; and the declaration as to its being all-seeing, &amp;c. while not</p>

 <p>seen by any one excludes the individual soul. This exclusion of what has a nature other than that of the highest Self thus confirms the view of that Self being meant.--Or else the Sûtra may be explained in a different way, viz. 'On account of the exclusion of the existence of another.' On this alternative the text 'There is nothing that sees but it,' &amp;c., is to be understood as follows: 'while this Imperishable, not seen by others but seeing all others, forms the basis of all things different from itself; there is no other principle which, unseen by the Imperishable but seeing it, could form <i>its</i> basis,' i.e. the text would exclude the existence of any other thing but the Imperishable, and thus implicitly deny that the Imperishable is either the Pradhâna or the individual Self.--Moreover the text 'By the command of that Imperishable men praise those who give, the gods follow the Sacrficer, the fathers the Darvî-offering,' declares the Imperishable to be that on the command of which there proceed all works enjoined by Scripture and Sm<i>ri</i>ti. such as sacrificing, giving, &amp;c., and this again shows that the Imperishable must be Brahman, the supreme Person. Again, the subsequent <i>passus</i>, 'Whosoever without knowing that Imperishable,' &amp;c., declares that ignorance of the Imperishable leads to the Sa<i>m</i>sâra, while knowledge of it helps to reach Immortality: this also proves that the Imperishable is the highest Brahman.--Here terminates the adhikara<i>n</i>a of 'the Imperishable.'</p>
