   <h1 align="center">CHAPTER VI<br> Of Religion of Self-Restraint</h1>  
 <p><i>Krishna.</i> Therefore, who doeth work rightful to do,<br> Not seeking gain from work, that man, O Prince!<br> Is Sanyasi and Yogi- both in one<br> And he is neither who lights not the flame<br> Of sacrifice, nor setteth hand to task.</p>  
 <p>Regard as true Renouncer him that makes<br> Worship by work, for who renounceth not<br> Works not as Yogin. So is that well said:<br> "By works the votary doth rise to faith,<br> And saintship is the ceasing from all works;<br> Because the perfect Yogin acts- but acts<br> Unmoved by passions and unbound by deeds,<br> Setting result aside.<br> Let each man raise<br> The Self by Soul, not trample down his Self,<br> Since Soul that is Self's friend may grow Self's foe.<br> Soul is Self's friend when Self doth rule o'er Self,<br> But Self turns enemy if Soul's own self<br> Hates Self as not itself.<br> The sovereign soul<br> Of him who lives self-governed and at peace<br> Is centred in itself, taking alike<br> Pleasure and pain; heat, cold; glory and shame.<br> He is the Yogi, he is Yukta, glad<br> With joy of light and truth; dwelling apart<br> Upon a peak, with senses subjugate<br> Whereto the clod, the rock, the glistering gold<br> Show all as one. By this sign is he known<br> Being of equal grace to comrades, friends,<br> Chance-comers, strangers, lovers, enemies,<br> Aliens and kinsmen; loving all alike,<br> Evil or good.</p>  
 <p>Sequestered should he sit,<br> Steadfastly meditating, solitary,<br> His thoughts controlled, his passions laid away,<br> Quit of belongings. In a fair, still spot<br> Having his fixed abode,- not too much raised,<br> Nor yet too low,- let him abide, his goods<br> A cloth, a deerskin, and the Kusa-grass.<br> There, setting hard his mind upon The One,<br> Restraining heart and senses, silent, calm,<br> Let him accomplish Yoga, and achieve<br> Pureness of soul, holding immovable<br> Body and neck and head, his gaze absorbed<br> Upon his nose-end, rapt from all around,<br> Tranquil in spirit, free of fear, intent<br> Upon his Brahmacharya vow, devout,<br> Musing on Me, lost in the thought of Me.<br> That Yogin, so devoted, so controlled,<br> Comes to the peace beyond,- My peace, the peace<br> Of high Nirvana!</p>  
 <p>But for earthly needs<br> Religion is not his who too much fasts<br> Or too much feasts, nor his who sleeps away<br> An idle mind; nor his who wears to waste<br> His strength in vigils. Nay, Arjuna! I call<br> That the true piety which most removes<br> Earth-aches and ills, where one is moderate<br> In eating and in resting, and in sport;<br> Measured in wish and act; sleeping betimes,<br> Waking betimes for duty.</p>  
 <p>When the man,<br> So living, centres on his soul the thought<br> Straitly restrained- untouched internally<br> By stress of sense- then is he Yukta. See!<br> Steadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind;<br> Such is the likeness of the Yogi's mind<br> Shut from sense-storms and burning bright to Heaven.<br> When mind broods placid, soothed with holy wont;<br> When Self contemplates self, and in itself<br> Hath comfort; when it knows the nameless joy<br> Beyond all scope of sense, revealed to soul-<br> Only to soul! and, knowing, wavers not,<br> True to the farther Truth; when, holding this,<br> It deems no other treasure comparable,<br> But, harboured there, cannot be stirred or shook<br> By any gravest grief, call that state "peace,"<br> That happy severance Yoga; call that man<br> The perfect Yogin!</p>  
 <p>Steadfastly the will<br> Must toil thereto, till efforts end in ease,<br> And thought has passed from thinking. Shaking off<br> All longings bred by dreams of fame and gain,<br> Shutting the doorways of the senses close<br> With watchful ward; so, step by step, it comes<br> To gift of peace assured and heart assuaged,<br> When the mind dwells self-wrapped, and the soul broods<br> Cumberless. But, as often as the heart<br> Breaks- wild and wavering- from control, so oft<br> Let him re-curb it, let him rein it back<br> To the soul's governance; for perfect bliss<br> Grows only in the bosom tranquillised,<br> The spirit passionless, purged from offence,<br> Vowed to the Infinite. He who thus vows<br> His soul to the Supreme Soul, quitting sin,<br> Passes unhindered to the endless bliss<br> Of unity with Brahma. He so vowed,<br> So blended, sees the Life-Soul resident<br> In all things living, and all living things<br> In that Life-Soul contained. And whoso thus<br> Discerneth Me in all, and all in Me,<br> I never let him go; nor looseneth he<br> Hold upon Me; but, dwell he where he may,<br> Whate'er his life, in Me he dwells and lives,<br> Because he knows and worships Me, Who dwell<br> In all which lives, and cleaves to Me in all.<br> Arjuna! if a man sees everywhere-<br> Taught by his own similitude- one Life,<br> One Essence in the Evil and the Good,<br> Hold him a Yogi, yea! well perfected!<br> Arjuna. Slayer of Madhu! yet again, this Yog,<br> This Peace, derived from equanimity,<br> Made known by thee- I see no fixity<br> Therein, no rest, because the heart of men<br> Is unfixed, Krishna! rash, tumultuous,<br> Wilful and strong. It were all one, I think,<br> To hold the wayward wind, as tame man's heart.<br> Krishna. Hero long-armed! beyond denial, hard<br> Man's heart is to restrain, and wavering;<br> Yet may it grow restrained by habit, Prince!<br> By wont of self-command. This Yog, I say,<br> Cometh not lightly to th' ungoverned ones;<br> But he who will be master of himself<br> Shall win it, if he stoutly strive thereto.<br> Arjuna. And what road goeth he who, having faith,<br> Fails, Krishna! in the striving; falling back<br> From holiness, missing the perfect rule?<br> Is he not lost, straying from Brahma's light,<br> Like the vain cloud, which floats 'twixt earth and heaven<br> When lightning splits it, and it vanisheth?<br> Fain would I hear thee answer me herein,<br> Since, Krishna! none save thou can clear the doubt.<br> Krishna. He is not lost, thou Son of Pritha! No!<br> Nor earth, nor heaven is forfeit, even for him,<br> Because no heart that holds one right desire<br> Treadeth the road of loss! He who should fail,<br> Desiring righteousness, cometh at death<br> Unto the Region of the Just; dwells there<br> Measureless years, and being born anew,<br> Beginneth life again in some fair home<br> Amid the mild and happy. It may chance<br> He doth descend into a Yogin house<br> On Virtue's breast; but that is rare! Such birth<br> Is hard to be obtained on this earth, Chief!<br> So hath he back again what heights of heart<br> He did achieve, and so he strives anew<br> To perfectness, with better hope, dear Prince!<br> For by the old desire he is drawn on<br> Unwittingly; and only to desire<br> The purity of Yog is to pass<br> Beyond the Sabdabrahm, the spoken Ved.<br> But, being Yogi, striving strong and long,<br> Purged from transgressions, perfected by births<br> Following on births, he plants his feet at last<br> Upon the farther path. Such as one ranks<br> Above ascetics, higher than the wise,<br> Beyond achievers of vast deeds! Be thou<br> Yogi Arjuna! And of such believe,<br> Truest and best is he who worships Me<br> With inmost soul, stayed on My Mystery!</p>  
 <p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER VI OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Atmasanyamayog,"<br> Or "The Book of Religion of Self-Restraint." </p>
