 <p align="CENTER"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
 <p>	The Gita is a doctrine of universal truth. Its message is universal, sublime, 
   and non-sectarian although it is a part of the scriptural trinity of Sanaatana 
   Dharma, commonly known as Hinduism. The Gita is very easy to understand in any 
   language for a mature mind. A repeated reading with faith will reveal all the 
   sublime ideas contained in it. A few abstruse statements are interspersed here 
   and there but they have no direct bearing on practical issues or the central 
   theme of Gita. The Gita deals with the most sacred metaphysical science. It 
   imparts the knowledge of the Self and answers two universal questions: Who am 
   I, and how can I lead a happy and peaceful life in this world of dualities. 
   It is a book of yoga, the moral and spiritual growth, for mankind based on the 
   cardinal principles of Hindu religion.</p>
 <p>	The message of Gita came to humanity because of Arjunaâ€™s unwillingness 
   to do his duty as a warrior, because fighting involved destruction and killing. 
   Nonviolence or Ahimsa is one of the most fundamental tenets of Hinduism. All 
   lives, human or non-human, are sacred. This immortal discourse between the Supreme 
   Lord, Krishna, and His devotee-friend, Arjuna, occurs not in a temple, a secluded 
   forest, or on a mountain top but on a battlefield on the eve of a war and is 
   recorded in the great epic, Mahaabhaarata. In Gita Lord Krishna advises Arjuna 
   to get up and fight. This may create a misunderstanding of the principles of 
   Ahimsa if the background of the war of Mahaabhaarata is not kept in mind. Therefore, 
   a brief historical description is in order.</p>
 <p>	In ancient times there was a king who had two sons, Dhritaraashtra and 
   Paandu. The former was born blind, therefore, Paandu inherited the kingdom. 
   Paandu had five sons. They were called the Paandavs. Dhritaraashtra had one 
   hundred sons. They were called the Kauravs. Duryodhana was the eldest of the 
   Kauravs. </p>
 <p>	After the death of king Paandu the Paandavs became the lawful king. Duryodhana 
   was a very jealous person. He also wanted the kingdom. The kingdom was divided 
   into two halves between the Paandavs and the Kauravs . Duryodhana was not satisfied 
   with his share of the kingdom. He wanted the entire kingdom for himself. He 
   unsuccessfully planned several foul plays to kill the Paandavs and take away 
   their kingdom. He unlawfully took possession of the entire kingdom of the Paandavs 
   and refused to give back even an acre of land without a war. All mediation by 
   Lord Krishna and others failed. The big war of Mahaabhaarata was thus inevitable. 
   The Paandavs were unwilling participants. They had only two choices: Fight for 
   their right as a matter of duty or run away from war and accept defeat in the 
   name of peace and nonviolence. Arjuna, one of the five Paandava brothers, faced 
   the dilemma in the battlefield whether to fight or run away from war for the 
   sake of peace. </p>
 <p>	Arjunaâ€™s dilemma is, in reality, the universal dilemma. Every human being 
   faces dilemmas, big and small, in their everyday life when performing their 
   duties. Arjunaâ€™s dilemma was the biggest of all. He had to make a choice between 
   fighting the war and killing his most revered guru, very dear friends, close 
   relatives, and many innocent warriors or running away from the battlefield for 
   the sake of preserving the peace and nonviolence. The entire seven hundred verses 
   of the Gita is a discourse between Lord Krishna and the confused Arjuna on the 
   battlefield of Kurukshetra near New Delhi, India, in about 3,100 years BCE. 
   This discourse was narrated to the blind king, Dhritaraashtr, by his charioteer, 
   Sanjaya, as an eyewitness war report.</p>
 <p>	The main objective of the Gita is to help people <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> 
   struggling in the darkness of ignorance <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> cross the 
   ocean of transmigration and reach the spiritual shore of liberation while living 
   and working in the society. The central teaching of the Gita is the attainment 
   of freedom or happiness from the bondage of life by doing oneâ€™s duty. Always 
   remember the glory and greatness of the creator and do your duty efficiently 
   without being attached to or affected by the results even if that duty may at 
   times demand unavoidable violence. Some people neglect or give up their duty 
   in life for the sake of a spiritual life while others excuse themselves from 
   spiritual practices because they believe that they have no time. The Lordâ€™s 
   message is to sanctify the entire living process itself. Whatever a person does 
   or thinks ought to be done for the glory and satisfaction of the Maker. No effort 
   or cost is necessary for this process. Do your duty as a service to the Lord 
   and humanity and see God alone in everything in a spiritual frame of mind. In 
   order to gain such a spiritual frame of mind, personal discipline, austerity, 
   penance, good conduct, selfless service, yogic practices, meditation, worship, 
   prayer, rituals, and study of scriptures, as well as the company of holy persons, 
   pilgrimage, chanting of the holy names of God, and Self-inquiry are needed to 
   purify the body, mind, and intellect. One must learn to give up lust, anger, 
   greed, and establish mastery over the six senses (hearing, touch, sight, taste, 
   smell, and mind) by the purified intellect. One should always remember that 
   all works are done by the energy of nature and that he or she is not the doer 
   but only an instrument. One must strive for excellence in all undertakings but 
   maintain equanimity in success and failure, gain and loss, and pain and pleasure. 
 </p>
 <p>	The ignorance of metaphysical knowledge is humanityâ€™s greatest predicament. 
   A scripture, being the voice of transcendence, cannot be translated. Language 
   is incapable and translations are defective to clearly impart the knowledge 
   of the Absolute. In this rendering, an attempt has been made to keep the style 
   as close as possible to the original Sanskrit poetry and yet make it easy to 
   read and understand. An attempt has been made to improve the clarity by adding 
   words or phrases, within parenthesis, in the English translation of the verses. 
   A glossary and index have been included. One hundred and thirty-three (133) 
   key verses are printed in <b><font color="#ff0000">red</font></b> for the convenience 
   of beginners. We suggest all our readers to ponder, contemplate, and act upon 
   these <b><font color="#ff0000">red</font></b> key verses. The beginners and 
   the busy executives should first read and understand the meaning of these key 
   verses before delving deep into the bottomless ocean of transcendental knowledge 
   of the Gita.</p>
 <p>	According to the scriptures no sin, however heinous, can affect the one 
   who reads, ponders, and practices the teachings of Gita any more than water 
   affects the lotus leaf. The Lord Himself resides where Gita is kept, read, chanted, 
   or taught. The Gita is the knowledge Supreme and the sound embodiment of the 
   Absolute and the Eternal. The one who reads, ponders, and practices the teachings 
   of Gita with faith and devotion will attain Moksha (or Nirvana) by the grace 
   of God.</p>
 <p>	This book is dedicated to my Sadguru, His Holiness Swami Chidanandji (Muniji) 
   Maharaj and all other gurus whose blessings, grace, and teachings have been 
   invaluable. It is offered to the greatest guru, Lord Krishna, with love and 
   devotion. May the Lord accept it, and bless those who repeatedly read this with 
   peace, happiness, and the true knowledge of the Self.</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b>ARJUNAâ€™S DILEMMA</b></p>
 <p><i>	The war of Mahabharata has begun after all negotiations by Lord Krishna 
   and others to avoid it failed. The blind King (Dhritarashtra) was never very 
   sure about the victory of his sons (Kauravas) in spite of their superior army. 
   Sage Vyasa, the author of Mahabharata, wanted to give the blind king the boon 
   of eyesight so that the king could see the horrors of the war for which he was 
   primarily responsible. But the king refused the offer. He did not want to see 
   the horrors of the war; but preferred to get the war report through his charioteer, 
   Sanjaya. Sage Vyasa granted the power of clairvoyance to Sanjaya. With this 
   power Sanjaya could see, hear, and recall the events of the past, present, and 
   the future. He was able to give an instant replay of the eye witness war report 
   to the blind King sitting in the palace. </i></p>
 <p><i>	Bhishma, the mightiest man and the commander-in-chief of the Kauravaâ€™s 
   army, is disabled by Arjuna and is lying on deathbed in the battleground on 
   the tenth day of the eighteen day war. Upon hearing this bad news from Sanjaya, 
   the blind King looses all hopes for victory of his sons. Now the King wants 
   to know the details of the war from the beginning, including how the mightiest 
   man, and the commander-in-chief of his superior army <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> 
   who had a boon of dying at his own will <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> was defeated 
   in the battlefield. The teaching of the Gita begins with the inquiry of the 
   blind King, after Sanjaya described how Bhishma was defeated, as follows:</i></p>
 <p>The King inquired: Sanjaya, please now tell me, in details, what did my people 
   (the Kauravas) and the Pandavas do in the battlefield before the war started? 
   (1.01)</p>
 <p>Sanjaya said: O King, After seeing the battle formation of the Pandavaâ€™s army, 
   your son approached his guru and spoke these words: (1.02)</p>
 <p>O Master, behold this mighty army of the Pandavas, arranged in battle formation 
   by your other talented disciple! There are many great warriors, valiant men, 
   heroes, and mighty archers. (1.03-06)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">Introduction Of The Army Commanders</font></i></b></p>
 <p>Also there are many heroes on my side who have risked their lives for me. I 
   shall name few distinguished commanders of my army for your information. He 
   named all the officers of his army, and said: They are armed with various weapons, 
   and are skilled in warfare. (1.07-09)</p>
 <p>Our army is invincible, while their army is easy to conquer. Therefore all 
   of you, occupying your respective positions, protect our commander-in-chief. 
   (1.10-11)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">War Starts With The Blowing Of Conch 
   Shells </font></i></b></p>
 <p>The mighty commander-in-chief and the eldest man of the dynasty, roared as 
   a lion and blew his conch loudly, bringing joy to your son. (1.12)</p>
 <p>Soon after that; conches, kettledrums, cymbals, drums, and trumpets were sounded 
   together. The commotion was tremendous. (1.13)</p>
 <p>After that, Lord Krishna and Arjuna, seated in a grand chariot yoked with white 
   horses, blew their celestial conches. (1.14)</p>
 <p>Krishna blew His conch first, and then Arjuna and all other commanders of various 
   divisions of the army of Pandavas blew their respective conches. The tumultuous 
   uproar, resounding through the earth and sky, tore the hearts of your sons. 
   (1.15-19)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">Arjuna Wants To Inspect The Army 
   Against Whom He Is About To Fight</font></i></b></p>
 <p>Seeing your sons standing, and the war about to begin with the hurling of weapons; 
   Arjuna, whose banner bore the emblem of Lord Hanumana, took up his bow and spoke 
   these words to Lord Krishna: O Lord, please stop my chariot between the two 
   armies until I behold those who stand here eager for the battle and with whom 
   I must engage in this act of war. (1.20-22)</p>
 <p>I wish to see those who are willing to serve and appease the evil-minded Kauravas 
   by assembling here to fight the battle. (1.23)</p>
 <p>Sanjaya said: O King; Lord Krishna, as requested by Arjuna, placed the best 
   of all the chariots in the midst of the two armies facing Arjuna's grandfather, 
   his guru and all other Kings; and said to Arjuna: Behold these assembled soldiers! 
   (1.24-25)</p>
 <p>Arjuna saw his uncles, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, 
   grandsons, and other comrades in the army. (1.26)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">ARJUNA'S DILEMMA </font></i></b></p>
 <p>After seeing fathers-in-law, companions, and all his kinsmen standing in the 
   ranks of the two armies, Arjuna was overcome with great compassion and sorrowfully 
   spoke these words: O Krishna, seeing my kinsmen standing with a desire to fight, 
   my limbs fail and my mouth becomes dry. My body quivers and my hairs stand on 
   end. (1.27-29)</p>
 <p>The bow slips from my hand, and my skin intensely burns. My head turns, I am 
   unable to stand steady, and O Krishna, I see bad omens. I see no use of killing 
   my kinsmen in battle. (1.30-31)</p>
 <p>I desire neither victory, nor pleasure nor kingdom, O Krishna. What is the 
   use of the kingdom, or enjoyment, or even life, O Krishna? Because all those 
   <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> for whom we desire kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures 
   <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> are standing here for the battle, giving up their 
   lives. (1.32-33)</p>
 <p>I do not wish to kill my teachers, uncles, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, 
   fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives who are about 
   to kill us, even for the sovereignty of the three worlds, let alone for this 
   earthly kingdom, O Krishna. (1.34-35)</p>
 <p>O Lord Krishna, what pleasure shall we find in killing our cousin brothers? 
   Upon killing these felons we shall incur sin only. (1.36)</p>
 <p>Therefore, we should not kill our cousin brothers. How can we be happy after 
   killing our relatives, O Krishna? (1.37)</p>
 <p>Though they are blinded by greed, and do not see evil in the destruction of 
   the family, or sin in being treacherous to friends. Why should not we, who clearly 
   see evil in the destruction of the family, think about turning away from this 
   sin, O Krishna? (1.38-39)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">ARJUNA DESCRIBES THE EVILS OF WAR</font></i></b></p>
 <p>Eternal family traditions and codes of moral conduct are destroyed with the 
   destruction of the family. And immorality prevails in the family due to the 
   destruction of family traditions. (1.40)</p>
 <p>And when immorality prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupted; 
   when women are corrupted, unwanted progeny is born. (1.41)</p>
 <p>This brings the family and the slayers of the family to hell, because the spirits 
   of their ancestors are degraded when deprived of ceremonial offerings of love 
   and respect by the unwanted progeny. (1.42)</p>
 <p>The everlasting qualities of social order and family traditions of those who 
   destroy their family are ruined by the sinful act of illegitimacy. (1.43)</p>
 <p>We have been told, O Krishna, that people whose family traditions are destroyed 
   necessarily dwell in hell for a long time. (1.44)</p>
 <p>Alas! We are ready to commit a great sin by striving to slay our relatives 
   because of greed for the pleasures of the kingdom. (1.45)</p>
 <p>It would be far better for me if my cousin brothers kill me with their weapons 
   in battle while I am unarmed and unresisting. (1.46)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">WHEN GOING GETS TOUGH, EVEN TOUGH 
   ONES CAN GET DELUDED</font></i></b></p>
 <p>Sanjaya said: Having said this in the battlefield and casting aside his bow 
   and arrow, Arjuna sat down on the seat of the chariot with his mind overwhelmed 
   with sorrow. (1.47)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b>CHAPTER 2</b></p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b>TRANSCENDENTAL KNOWLEDGE</b></p>
 <p>Sanjaya said: Lord Krishna spoke these words to Arjuna whose eyes were tearful 
   and downcast, and who was overwhelmed with compassion and despair. (2.01)</p>
 <p>Lord Krishna said: How has the dejection come to you at this juncture? This 
   is not fit for a person of noble mind and deeds. It is disgraceful, and it does 
   not lead one to heaven, O Arjuna. (2.02)</p>
 <p>Do not become a coward, O Arjuna, because it does not befit you. Shake off 
   this trivial weakness of your heart and get up for the battle, O Arjuna. (2.03)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">ARJUNA CONTINUES HIS REASONING </font></i></b></p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">AGAINST THE WAR </font></i></b></p>
 <p>Arjuna said: How shall I strike my grandfather, my guru, and all other relatives, 
   who are worthy of my respect, with arrows in battle, O Krishna? (2.04)</p>
 <p>It would be better, indeed, to live on alms in this world than to slay these 
   noble personalities, because by killing them I would enjoy wealth and pleasures 
   stained with their blood. (2.05)</p>
 <p>We do not know which alternative <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> to fight or to 
   quit <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> is better for us. Further, we do not know 
   whether we shall conquer them or they will conquer us. We should not even wish 
   to live after killing our cousin brothers, who are standing in front of us. 
   (2.06)</p>
 <p>My senses are overcome by the weakness of pity, and my mind is confused about 
   duty (Dharma). Please tell me what is better for me. I am Your disciple, and 
   I take refuge in You. (2.07)</p>
 <p>I do not perceive that gaining an unrivaled and prosperous kingdom on this 
   earth, or even lordship over all the celestial controllers will remove the sorrow 
   that is drying up my senses. (2.08)</p>
 <p>Sanjaya said: O King, after speaking like this to Lord Krishna, the mighty 
   Arjuna said to Krishna: I shall not fight, and became silent. (2.09)</p>
 <p>O King, Lord Krishna, as if smiling, spoke these words to the distressed Arjuna 
   in the midst of the two armies. (2.10)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">THE TEACHINGS OF THE GITA BEGIN 
   WITH THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF SPIRIT</font></i></b></p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">AND THE PHYSICAL BODY </font></i></b></p>
 <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Lord Krishna said: You grieve for those who are not 
   worthy of grief, and yet speak words of wisdom. The wise grieves neither for 
   the living nor for the dead. (2.11)</font></b></p>
 <p>There was never a time when these monarchs, you, or I did not exist; nor shall 
   we ever cease to exist in the future. (2.12)</p>
 <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Just as the soul acquires a childhood body, a youth 
   body, and an old age body during this life; similarly, the soul acquires another 
   body after death. This should not delude the wise. (See also 15.08) (2.13)</font></b></p>
 <p>The contacts of the senses with the sense objects give rise to the feelings 
   of heat and cold, and pain and pleasure. They are transitory and impermanent. 
   Therefore, one should learn to endure them. (2.14)</p>
 <p>Because a calm person <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> who is not afflicted by 
   these sense objects, and is steady in pain and pleasure <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> 
   becomes fit for salvation. (2.15)	</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">THE SPIRIT IS ETERNAL, BODY IS TRANSITORY 
   </font></i></b></p>
 <p>The invisible Spirit (Atma, Atman) is eternal, and the visible physical body, 
   is transitory. The reality of these two is indeed certainly seen by the seers 
   of truth. (2.16)</p>
 <p>The Spirit by whom this entire universe is pervaded is indestructible. No one 
   can destroy the imperishable Spirit. (2.17)</p>
 <p>The physical bodies of the eternal, immutable, and incomprehensible Spirit 
   are perishable. Therefore fight, O Arjuna. (2.18)</p>
 <p><b><font color="#ff0000">The one who thinks that the Spirit is a slayer, and 
   the one who thinks the Spirit is slain, both are ignorant. Because the Spirit 
   neither slays nor is slain. (2.19)</font></b></p>
 <p>The Spirit is neither born nor does it die at any time. It does not come into 
   being, or cease to exist. It is unborn, eternal, permanent, and primeval. The 
   Spirit is not destroyed when the body is destroyed. (2.20)</p>
 <p>O Arjuna, how can a person who knows that the Spirit is indestructible, eternal, 
   unborn, and immutable, kill anyone or causes anyone to be killed? (2.21)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">DEATH AND TRANSMIGRATION OF SOUL</font></i></b></p>

   bodies after casting away the old bodies. (2.22)</font></b></p>
 <p>Weapons do not cut this Spirit, fire does not burn it, water does not make 
   it wet, and the wind does not make it dry. The Spirit cannot be cut, burned, 
   wetted, or dried. It is eternal, all pervading, unchanging, immovable, and primeval. 
   (2.23-24)</p>
 <p>The Spirit is said to be unexplainable, incomprehensible, and unchanging. Knowing 
   the Spirit as such you should not grieve. (2.25)</p>
 <p>Even if you think that the physical body takes birth and dies perpetually, 
   even then, O Arjuna, you should not grieve like this. Because death is certain 
   for the one who is born, and birth is certain for the one who dies. Therefore, 
   you should not lament over the inevitable. (2.26-27)</p>
 <p><b><font color="#ff0000">All beings are unmanifest, or invisible to our physical

   know what the Spirit is. (See also KaU 2.07) (2.29)</p>

 <p>You will go to heaven if killed on the line of duty, or you will enjoy the

   will free yourself from all Karmic bondage, or sin. (2.39)</p>
 <p>No effort is ever lost in selfless service, and there is no adverse effect. 
   Even a little practice of the discipline of selfless service protects one from 
   the great fear of repeated birth and death. (2.40)</p>

   think, O Arjuna, as if there is nothing else in the Vedas except the rituals 
   for the sole purpose of obtaining heavenly enjoyment. (2.42)</p>
 <p>They are dominated by material desires, and consider the attainment of heaven 
   as the highest goal of life. They engage in specific rites for the sake of prosperity 
   and enjoyment. Rebirth is the result of their action. (2.43)</p>
 <p>The resolute determination of Self-realization is not formed in the minds of 
   those who are attached to pleasure and power, and whose judgment is obscured 
   by ritualistic activities. (2.44)</p>
 <p>A portion of the Vedas deals with three modes â€” goodness, passion, and ignorance 
   â€” of material Nature. Become free from pairs of opposites, be ever balanced 
   and unconcerned with the thoughts of acquisition and preservation. Rise above 
   these three modes, and be Self-conscious, O Arjuna. (2.45)</p>

   become a renunciant merely by not lighting the fire, and one does not become 
   a yogi merely by abstaining from work. (6.01)</p>

 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">MIND IS THE BEST FRIEND AS WELL

   and senses <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure 
   and pain, and in honor and dishonor, and remains ever steadfast with the supreme 
   Self. (6.07)</p>
 <p>A person is called yogi who has both Self-knowledge and Self-realization, who 
   is equanimous, who has control over the mind and senses, and to whom a clod, 
   a stone, and gold are the same. (6.08)</p>
 <p><b><font color="#ff0000">A person is considered superior who is impartial towards 
   companions, friends, enemies, neutrals, arbiters, haters, relatives, saints, 
   and sinners. (6.09)</font></b></p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">TECHNIQUES OF MEDITATION </font></i></b></p>
 <p>A yogi, seated in solitude and alone, should constantly try to contemplate 
   on a mental picture or just the majesty of the Supreme Being after bringing 
   the mind and senses under control, and becoming free from desires and proprietorship. 
   (6.10)</p>
 <p>One should sit on his or her own firm seat that is neither too high nor too 
   low, covered with grass, a deerskin, and a cloth, one over the other, in a clean 
   spot. Sitting there in a comfortable position and concentrating the mind on 
   God, controlling the thoughts and the activities of the senses, one should practice 
   meditation for self-purification. (6.11-12)</p>
 <p>One should sit by holding the waist, spine, chest, neck, and head erect, motionless 
   and steady; fix the eyes and the mind steadily on the front of the nose, without 
   looking around; make your mind serene and fearless, practice celibacy; have 
   the mind under control, think of Me, and have Me as the supreme goal. (See also 
   4.29, 5.27, 8.10, and 8.12) (6.13-14)</p>
 <p>Thus, by always practicing to keep the mind fixed on Me, the yogi whose mind 
   is subdued attains peace of Nirvana and comes to Me. (6.15)</p>
 <p>This yoga is not possible, O Arjuna, for the one who eats too much, or who 
   does not eat at all; who sleeps too much or too little. (6.16)</p>
 <p>The yoga of meditation destroys all sorrow for the one who is moderate in eating, 
   recreation, working, sleeping, and waking. (6.17)</p>
 <p>A person is said to have achieved yoga, the union with the Spirit, when the 
   perfectly disciplined mind becomes free from all desires, and gets completely 
   united with the Spirit in trance. (6.18)</p>
 <p>A lamp in a spot sheltered by the Spirit from the wind of desires does not 
   flicker. This simile is used for the subdued mind of a yogi practicing meditation 
   on the Spirit. (6.19)</p>
 <p>When the mind disciplined by the practice of meditation becomes steady, one 
   becomes content with the Spirit by beholding the Spirit of God with purified 
   intellect. (6.20)</p>
 <p>One feels infinite bliss that is perceivable only through the intellect, and 
   is beyond the reach of the senses. After realizing the Absolute Reality, one 
   is never separated from it. (6.21)</p>
 <p>After Self-realization (SR), one does not regard any other gain superior to 
   SR. Established in SR, one is not moved even by the greatest calamity. (6.22)</p>
 <p>The state of severance of union with sorrow is called yoga. This yoga should 
   be practiced with firm determination, and without any mental reservation. (6.23)</p>
 <p>One gradually attains tranquillity of mind by totally abandoning all selfish 
   desires, completely restraining the senses from the sense objects by the intellect, 
   and keeping the mind fully absorbed in the Spirit by means of a well-trained 
   and purified intellect and thinking of nothing else. (6.24-25)</p>
 <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Wheresoever this restless and unsteady mind wanders 
   away, one should gently bring it back to the reflection of God. (6.26)</font></b></p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">WHO IS A YOGI </font></i></b></p>
 <p>Supreme bliss comes to a Self-realized yogi whose mind is tranquil, whose desires 
   are under control, and who is free from faults. (6.27)</p>
 <p>Such a sinless yogi, who constantly engages his or her mind and intellect with 
   the Spirit, easily enjoys the infinite bliss of contact with The Spirit. (6.28)</p>
 <p><b><font color="#ff0000">A yogi, who is in union with the Supreme Being, sees

 <p>Acts of service, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned, but should 
   be performed, because service, charity, and austerity are the purifiers of the

 <p>Obligatory work performed as duty, renouncing selfish attachment to the fruit, 
   is alone regarded to be sacrifice in the mode of goodness, O Arjuna. (18.09)</p>

   of Karma; the modes of material Nature, the doer; the eleven organs of perception 
   and action, the instruments; various bioimpulses; and the fifth is the presiding 
   deities of the eleven organs. (18.13-14)</p>
 <p>Whatever action, whether right or wrong, one performs by thought, word, and 
   deed; these are its five causes. (18.15)</p>
 <p>Therefore, the ignorant one who considers oneâ€™s body or the soul as the sole 
   agent due to imperfect knowledge does not understand. (18.16)</p>
 <p>The one who is free from the notion of doership, and whose intellect is not 
   polluted by the desire to reap the fruit; even after slaying these people, he 
   or she neither slays nor is bound by the act of killing. (18.17)</p>
 <p>The subject, the object, and the knowledge of the object are the threefold 
   driving force to an action. The eleven organs; the act, and the agent or the 
   modes of material Nature are the three components of action. (18.18)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">THREE TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE </font></i></b></p>
 <p>Self-knowledge, action), and agent are said to be of three types according 
   to Sankhya doctrine. Hear duly about these also. (18.19)</p>
 <p>The knowledge by which one sees a single immutable Reality in all beings as 
   undivided in the divided; such knowledge is in the mode of goodness. (See also 
   11.13, and 13.16) (18.20)</p>
 <p>The knowledge by which one sees different realities of various types among 
   all beings as separate from one another; consider that knowledge to be in the 
   mode of passion. (18.21)</p>
 <p>The irrational, baseless, and worthless knowledge by which one clings to one 
   single effect (such as the body) as if it is everything; such knowledge is declared 
   to be in the mode of darkness of ignorance (18.22)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">THREE TYPES OF ACTION </font></i></b></p>
 <p>The obligatory duty performed without likes and dislikes, and without selfish 
   motives and attachment to enjoy the fruit, is said to be in the mode of goodness. 
   (18.23)</p>
 <p>Action performed with ego, with selfish motives, and with too much effort; 
   is declared to be in the mode of passion. (18.24)</p>
 <p>Action that is undertaken because of delusion; disregarding consequences, loss, 
   injury to others, as well as oneâ€™s own ability is said to be in the mode of 
   ignorance. (18.25)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">THREE TYPES OF AGENT </font></i></b></p>
 <p>The agent who is free from attachment, is non-egotistic, endowed with resolve 
   and enthusiasm, and unperturbed in success or failure is called good. (18.26)</p>
 <p>The agent who is impassioned, attached to the fruits of their work, greedy, 
   violent, impure, and is affected by joy and sorrow is called passionate. (18.27)</p>
 <p>The undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, wicked, malicious, lazy, depressed, and 
   procrastinating agent is called ignorant. (18.28)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">THREE TYPES OF INTELLECT </font></i></b></p>
 <p>Now hear the threefold division of intellect and resolve, based on modes of 
   material Nature, as explained by Me fully and separately, O Arjuna. (18.29)</p>
 <p>O Arjuna, the intellect by which one understands the path of work and the path 
   of renunciation, right and wrong action, fear and fearlessness, bondage and 
   liberation, that intellect is in the mode of goodness. (18.30)</p>
 <p>The intellect by which one cannot distinguish between righteousness (Dharma) 
   and unrighteousness (Adharma), and right and wrong action; that intellect is 
   in the mode of passion, O Arjuna. (18.31)</p>
 <p>The intellect <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> when covered by ignorance <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> 
   accepts unrighteousness (Adharma) as righteousness (Dharma), and thinks everything 
   to be that which it is not, is in the mode of ignorance, O Arjuna. (18.32)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">THREE TYPES OF RESOLVE, AND THE 
   FOUR GOALS OF HUMAN LIFE</font></i></b></p>
 <p>The resolve by which one manipulates the functions of the mind, Prana (bioimpulses), 
   and senses for God-realization only; that resolve is in the mode of goodness, 
   O Arjuna. (18.33)</p>
 <p>The resolve by which a person, craving for the fruits of work, clings to duty, 
   accumulating wealth, and enjoyment with great attachment; that resolve, O Arjuna, 
   is in the mode of passion. (18.34)</p>
 <p>The resolve by which a dull person does not give up sleep, fear, grief, despair, 
   and carelessness; that resolve is in the mode of ignorance, O Arjuna. (18.35)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">THREE TYPES OF PLEASURE </font></i></b></p>
 <p>And now hear from Me, O Arjuna, about the threefold pleasure. The pleasure 
   one enjoys from spiritual practice results in cessation of all sorrows. (18.36)</p>
 <p>The pleasure that appears as poison in the beginning, but is like nectar in 
   the end, comes by the grace of Self-knowledge, and is in the mode of goodness. 
   (18.37)</p>
 <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Sensual pleasures appear as nectar in the beginning, 
   but become poison in the end; such pleasures are in the mode of passion. (See 
   also 5.22) (18.38)</font></b></p>
 <p>Pleasure that confuses a person in the beginning and in the end; which comes 
   from sleep, laziness, and carelessness; such pleasure is said to be in the mode 
   of ignorance. (18.39)</p>
 <p>There is no being, either on the earth or among the celestial controllers in 
   the heaven, who can remain free from these three modes of material Nature. (18.40)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">DIVISION OF LABOR IS BASED </font></i></b></p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">ON ONEâ€™S ABILITY</font></i></b></p>
 <p>The division of human labor is also based on the qualities inherent in peoplesâ€™ 
   nature or their make up. (See also 4.13) (18.41)</p>
 <p>Those who have serenity, self control, austerity, purity, patience, honesty, 
   transcendental knowledge, transcendental experience, and belief in God are labeled 
   as intellectuals (Braahmans). (18.42)</p>
 <p>Those having the qualities of heroism, vigor, firmness, dexterity, not fleeing 
   from battle, charity, and administrative skills are called leaders or protectors 
   (Kshatriyas). (18.43)</p>
 <p>Those who are good in cultivation, cattle rearing, business, trade, finance, 
   and industry are known as business men (Vaishyas). Those who are very good in 
   service and labor type work only are classed as workers (Shudras). (18.44)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">ATTAINMENT OF SALVATION THROUGH 
   DUTY, DISCIPLINE, AND DEVOTION </font></i></b></p>
 <p>One can attain the highest perfection by devotion to oneâ€™s natural work. Listen 
   to Me how one attains perfection while engaged in oneâ€™s natural work. (18.45)</p>
 <p><b><font color="#ff0000">One attains perfection by worshipping the Supreme 
   Being </font><font face="Symbol" color="#ff0000">Â¾</font><font color="#ff0000"> 
   from whom all beings originate, and by whom all this universe is pervaded </font><font face="Symbol" color="#ff0000">Â¾</font><font color="#ff0000"> 
   through performance of oneâ€™s natural duty for Him. (See also 9.27, 12.10) (18.46)</font></b></p>
 <p>Oneâ€™s inferior natural work is better than superior unnatural work even though 
   well performed. One who does the work ordained by oneâ€™s inherent nature, without 
   any selfish motive, incurs no sin (or Karmic reaction). (See also 3.35) (18.47)</p>
 <p>Oneâ€™s natural work, even though defective, should not be abandoned; because 
   all undertakings are enveloped by defects as fire is covered by smoke, O Arjuna. 
   (18.48)</p>
 <p>The person whose mind is always free from selfish attachment, who has subdued 
   the mind and senses, and who is free from desires attains the supreme perfection 
   of freedom from the bondage of Karma by renouncing selfish attachment to the 
   fruits of work. (18.49)</p>
 <p>Learn from Me briefly, O Arjuna, how one who has attained such perfection, 
   or the freedom from the bondage of Karma, attains Supreme Being, the goal of 
   transcendental knowledge. (18.50)</p>
 <p>Endowed with purified intellect, subduing the mind with firm resolve, turning 
   away from sound and other objects of the senses, giving up likes and dislikes; 
   living in solitude, eating lightly, controlling the mind, speech, and organs 
   of action, ever absorbed in yoga of meditation, taking refuge in detachment; 
   and after relinquishing egotism, violence, pride, lust, anger, and proprietorship; 
   one becomes peaceful, free from the notion of "I, me, and my", and fit for attaining 
   oneness with the Supreme Being. (18.51-53)</p>
 <p>Absorbed in the Supreme Being, the serene one neither grieves nor desires; 
   becoming impartial to all beings, one obtains the highest devotional love for 
   God. (18.54)</p>
 <p><b><font color="#ff0000">By devotion one truly understands what and who I am 
   in essence. Having known Me in essence, one immediately merges with Me. (See 
   also 5.19) (18.55)</font></b></p>
 <p>A Karma-yogi devotee attains the eternal immutable abode by My grace <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> 
   even while doing all duties <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> just by taking refuge 
   in Me (by surrendering all action to Me with loving devotion). (18.56)</p>
 <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Sincerely offer all actions to Me, set Me as your 
   supreme goal, and completely depend on Me. Always fix your mind on Me, and resort 
   to Karma-yoga. (18.57)</font></b></p>
 <p>You shall overcome all difficulties by My grace when your mind becomes fixed 
   on Me. But, if you do not listen to Me due to ego, you shall perish. (18.58)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">THE KARMIC BONDAGE </font></i></b></p>
 <p>If due to ego you think: I shall not fight; this resolve of yours is vain. 
   Because your own nature will compel you to fight. (18.59)</p>
 <p>O Arjuna, you are controlled by your own nature-born Karmic impressions. Therefore, 
   you shall do <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> even against your will <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> 
   what you do not wish to do out of delusion. (18.60)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">WE BECOME THE PUPPETS OF </font></i></b></p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">OUR OWN FREEWILL </font></i></b></p>
 <p><b><font color="#ff0000">The Supreme Lord â€” as the controller abiding in the 
   inner psyche of all beings â€” causes them to work out their Karma like a puppet 
   (of Karma created by the free will) mounted on a machine. (18.61)</font></b></p>
 <p>Seek refuge in the Supreme Lord alone with loving devotion, O Arjuna. By His 
   grace you shall attain supreme peace and the Eternal Abode. (18.62)</p>
 <p>Thus the knowledge that is more secret than the secret has been explained to 
   you by Me. After fully reflecting on this, do as you wish. (18.63)</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">PATH OF SURRENDER IS THE </font></i></b></p>
 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">ULTIMATE PATH TO GOD </font></i></b></p>
 <p>Hear once again My most secret, supreme word. You are very dear to Me, therefore, 
   I shall tell this for your benefit. (18.64)</p>
 <p>Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, offer service to Me, bow down to Me, 
   and you shall certainly reach Me. I promise you because you are My very dear 
   friend. (18.65)</p>
 <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Set aside all meritorious deeds and religious rituals, 
   and just surrender completely to My will with firm faith and loving devotion. 
   I shall liberate you from all sins, the bonds of Karma. Do not grieve. (18.66)</font></b></p>
 <p>This knowledge should never be spoken by you to one who is devoid of austerity, 
   who is without devotion, who does not desire to listen, or who speaks ill of 
   Me. (18.67)</p>

 <p align="CENTER"><b><i><font color="#ff00ff">GRACE OF THE GITA </font></i></b></p>
 <p>I promise the study of this sacred dialogue of ours will be equivalent to worshipping 
   Me with knowledge-sacrifice. (18.70)</p>
 <p>Whoever hears this sacred dialogue with faith and without cavil becomes free 
   from sin, and attains heaven <font face="Symbol">Â¾</font> the higher worlds 
   of those whose actions are pure and virtuous. (18.71)</p>
 <p>O Arjuna, did you listen to this with single-minded attention? Has your delusion 
   born of ignorance been completely destroyed? (18.72)</p>
 <p>Arjuna said: By Your grace my delusion is destroyed, I have gained Self-knowledge, 
   my confusion with regard to body and Spirit is dispelled and I shall obey Your 
   command. (18.73)</p>
 <p>Sanjaya said: Thus I heard this wonderful dialogue between Lord Krishna and 
   Arjuna, causing my hair to stand on end. (18.74)</p>
 <p>By the grace of sage Vyasa, I heard this most secret and supreme yoga directly 
   from Krishna, the Lord of yoga, Himself speaking to Arjuna before my very eyes 
   of clairvoyance granted by sage Vyasa. (18.75)</p>
 <p>O King, by repeated remembrance of this marvelous and sacred dialogue between 
   Lord Krishna and Arjuna, I am thrilled at every moment; and (18.76)</p>
 <p>Recollecting again and again, O King, that marvelous form of Krishna I am greatly 
   amazed and I rejoice over and over again. (18.77)</p>
