 <p>'Sanjaya said, 'Having listened to Uluka's words, Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, moved his army headed by Dhrishtadyumna and others. And that vast army commanded by Dhrishtadyumna, consisting of four kinds of forces, <i>viz</i>., foot-soldiers and elephants and cars and cavalry, terrible, and immovable like the earth herself, and guarded by mighty car-warriors led by Bhimasena and Arjuna, could be compared to the vast ocean lying in stillness. And at the head of that vast force was that mighty bowman, the prince of Panchalas, invincible in battle, <i>viz</i>., Dhrishtadyumna, desirous of obtaining Drona for his antagonist. And Dhrishtadyumna began to select combatants (from his own army) for pitting them against particular warriors of the hostile force.

 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Arjuna against the <i>Suta's</i> son (Karna), Bhima against Duryodhana, Dhrishtaketu against Salya, Uttamaujas against Gautama's son (Kripa), Nakula against Kritavarman, Yuyudhana against the ruler of the Sindhus (Jayadratha). And he placed Sikhandin in the van, pitting him against Bhishma. And he urged Sahadeva against Sakuni, and Chekitana against Sala, and the five sons of Draupadi against the Trigartas. And he urged Subhadra's son (Abhimanyu) against Vrishasena (the son of Karna), and also against all the rest of the kings, for he regarded Abhimanyu as superior to Arjuna himself in battle. And distributing his warriors thus, individually and collectively, that mighty bowman, of the hue of blazing fire, kept Drona for his own share. And that leader of leaders of troops, the mighty and intelligent bowman Dhrishtadyumna, having arrayed his troops duly, waited for battle with a firm heart. And having arrayed the combatants, as indicated above, of the Pandavas, he waited, with collected mind, on the field for securing victory to the sons of Pandu.'"</p>
