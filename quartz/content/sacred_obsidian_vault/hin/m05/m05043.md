 <p>"Dhritarashtra said, 'What is the object of asceticism (<i>mauna</i>)? Of the two kinds of <i>mauna</i> (<i>viz</i>., the restraining of speech and meditation), which is approved by thee? O learned one, tell me the true aspect of <i>mauna</i>. Can a person of learning attain to a state of quietude and emancipation (<i>moksha</i>) by that <i>mauna</i>? O Muni, how also is asceticism (<i>mauna</i>) to be practised here?'</p>  
 <p>"Sanat-sujata said, 'Since the Supreme Soul cannot be penetrated by both the Vedas and the mind, it is for this that Soul itself is called <i>mauna</i>. That from which both the <i>Vedic</i> syllable <i>Om</i> and this one (ordinary sounds) have arisen, <i>that</i> One, O king, is displayed as the Word.'</p>  
 <p>"Dhritarashtra said, 'Is he that knoweth both the <i>Rig</i> and the <i>Yajus Vedas</i>, is he that knoweth the <i>Sama Veda</i>, sullied by sins or not when he commiteth sins?'</p>  
 <p>"Sanat-sujata said, 'I tell thee truly that the man that hath not restrained his senses is not rescued from his sinful acts by either the <i>Sama</i> or the <i>Rig</i>, or the <i>Yajus Veda</i>. The Vedas never rescue from sin the deceitful person living by deceit. On the other hand, like newfledged birds forsaking their nest, the Vedas forsake such a person at the end.'</p>  
 <p>"Dhritarashtra said, 'O thou that hast restrained thy senses, if, indeed, the Vedas are not competent to rescue a person without the aid of virtue, whence then is this delusion of the Brahmanas that the Vedas are always destructive of sins?'</p>  
 <p>"Sanat-sujata said, 'O magnanimous one, this universe hath sprung from that Supreme Soul by the union of Conditions respecting name, form, and other attributes. The Vedas also, pointing it out duly, declare the same, and inculcate that the Supreme Soul and the universe are different and not identical. It is for attaining to that Supreme Soul that asceticism and sacrifices are ordained, and it is by these two that the man of learning earneth virtue. Destroying sin by virtue, his soul is enlightened by knowledge. The man of knowledge, by the aid of knowledge, attaineth to the Supreme Soul. Otherwise, he that coveteth the four objects of human pursuit, taking with him all that he doth here, enjoyeth their fruits hereafter, and (as those fruits) are not everlasting cometh back to the region of action (when the enjoyment is over). Indeed, the fruits of ascetic austerities performed in this world have to be</p>  
 <p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 98</font></a></p>  
 <p>enjoyed in the other world (as regards those persons who have not obtained the mastery of their souls). As regards those Brahmanas employed in ascetic practices (who have the mastery of their souls), even these regions are capable of yielding fruits.'</p>  
 <p>"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Sanat-sujata, how can ascetic austerities which are all of the same kind, be sometimes successful and sometimes unsuccessful? Tell us this in order that we may know it!'</p>  
 <p>"Sanat-sujata said, 'That asceticism which is not stained by (desire and other) faults is said to be capable of procuring emancipation, and is, therefore, successful, while the asceticism that is stained by vanity and want of true devotion is regarded unsuccessful. All thy enquiries, O Kshatriya, touch the very root of asceticism. It is by asceticism that they that are learned, know <i>Brahman</i> and win immortality!'</p>  
 <p>"Dhritarashtra said, 'I have listened to what thou hast said about asceticism unstained by faults, and by which I have succeeded in knowing an eternal mystery. Tell me now, O Sanat-sujata, about asceticism that is stained by faults!'</p>  
 <p>"Sanat-sujata said, 'O king, the twelve, including anger, as also the thirteen kinds of wickedness, are the faults of asceticism that is stained. Anger, lust, avarice, ignorance of right and wrong, discontent, cruelty, malice, vanity, grief, love of pleasure, envy, and speaking ill of others, are generally the faults of human beings. These twelve should always be avoided by men. Any one amongst these can singly effect the destruction of men, O bull among men. Indeed, every one of these wait for opportunity in respect of men, like a hunter expectant of opportunities in respect of deer. Assertion of one's own superiority, desire of enjoying others' wives, humiliating others from excess of pride, wrathfulness, fickleness, and refusing to maintain those worthy of being maintained, these six acts of wickedness are always practised by sinful men defying all dangers here and hereafter. He that regards the gratification of lust to be one of life's aims, he that is exceedingly proud, he that <a href="errata.htm#20">grieves</a> having given away, he that never spends money, he that persecutes his subjects by exacting hateful taxes, he that delights in the humiliation of others, and he that hates his own wives,--these seven are others that are also called wicked. Righteousness, truth (abstention from injury and truthfulness of speech), self-restraint, asceticism, delight in the happiness of others, modesty, forbearance, love of others, sacrifices, gifts, perseverance, knowledge of the scriptures,--these twelve constitute the practices of Brahmanas. He that succeeds in acquiring these twelve, becomes competent to sway the entire earth. He that is endued with three, two, or even one, of these, should be regarded of heavenly prosperity. Self-restraint, <a href="errata.htm#21">renunciation</a>, and knowledge of Self,--in these are emancipation. Those Brahmanas that are endued with wisdom, say, that these are attributes in which truth predominates. Self-restraint is constituted by eighteen virtues. Breaches and non-observance of ordained acts and omissions, falsehood, malice, lust, wealth, love of (sensual) pleasure,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 99</font></a></p>  
 <p>anger, grief, thirst, avarice, deceit, joy in the misery of others, envy, injuring others, regret, aversion from pious acts, forgetfulness of duty, calumniating others, and vanity-he that is freed from these (eighteen) vices; is said by the righteous to be <i>self-restrained</i>. The eighteen faults (that have been enumerated) constitute what is called <i>mada</i> or pride. Renunciation is of six kinds. The reverse of those six again are faults called mada. (The faults, therefore, that go by the name of <i>mada</i> are eighteen and six). The six kinds of renunciation are all commendable. The third only is difficult of practice, but by that all sorrow is overcome. Indeed, if that kind of renunciation be accomplished in practice, he that accomplishes it overcomes all the pairs of contraries in the world.</p>  
 <p>'The six kinds of renunciation are all commendable. They are these: The first is never experiencing joy on occasions of prosperity. The second is the abandonment of sacrifices, prayers, and pious acts. That which is called the third, O king, is the abandonment of desire or withdrawing from the world. Indeed, it is in consequence of this third kind of renunciation of desire, which is evidenced by the abandonment of all objects of enjoyment (without enjoying them) and not their abandonment after having enjoyed them to the fill, nor by abandonment after acquisition, nor by abandonment only after one has become incompetent to enjoy from loss of appetite. The fourth kind of renunciation consists in this: One should not grieve nor suffer his self to be afflicted by grief when one's actions fail, notwithstanding one's possession of all the virtues and all kinds of wealth. Or, when anything disagreeable happens, one feeleth no pain. The fifth kind of renunciation consists in not soliciting even one's sons, wives, and others that may all be very dear. The sixth kind consists in giving away to a deserving person who solicits, which act of gifts is always productive of merit. By these again, one acquires the knowledge of Self. As regards this last attribute, it involves eight qualities. These are truth, meditation, distinction of subject and object, capacity for drawing inferences, withdrawal from the world, never taking what belongeth to others, the practices of <i>Brahmacharya</i> vows (abstinence), and non-acceptance (of gifts).</p>  
 <p>'So also the attribute of <i>mada</i> (the opposite of <i>dama</i> or self-restraint) hath faults which have all been indicated (in the scriptures). These faults should be avoided. I have spoken (to thee) of renunciation and self-knowledge. And as, self-Knowledge hath eight virtues, so the want of it hath eight faults. Those faults should be avoided. O Bharata, he that is liberated from this five senses, mind, the past and the future, becomes happy. O king, let thy soul be devoted to truth; all the worlds are established on truth; indeed, self-control, renunciation, and self-knowledge are said to have truth for their foremost attribute. Avoiding (these) faults, one should practise asceticism here. The Ordainer hath ordained that truth alone should be the vow of the righteous. Asceticism, that is dissociated from these faults and endued with these virtues, becomes the source of great prosperity, I have now briefly told these about that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 100</font></a></p>  
 <p>sin-destroying and sacred subject which thou hadst asked me and which is capable of liberating a person from birth, death, and decrepitude.'</p>  
 <p>"Dhritarashtra said, 'With <i>Akhyana</i> (<i>Puranas</i>) as their fifth, the <i>Vedas</i> declare the Supreme Soul to be this universe consisting of mobile and immobile things. Others regard four God-heads; and others three; others again regard two; and others only one; and others regard <i>Brahman</i> alone as the sole existent object (there being nothing else possessing a separate existence). Amongst these, which should I know to be really possessed of the knowledge of Brahman.'</p>  
 <p>"Sanat-sujata, 'There is but one <i>Brahman</i> which is Truth's self. It is from ignorance of that One, that god-heads have been conceived to be diverse. But who is there, O king, that hath attained to Truth's self or Brahman? Man regardeth himself wise without knowing that One Object of knowledge, and from desire of happiness is engaged in study and the practices of charity and sacrifices. They have deviated from Truth (Brahman) and entertain purposes corresponding (with their state) and hence relying on the truth of Vedic texts thereof perform sacrifices. Some perform (or <a href="errata.htm#22">attain</a> the object of) <a href="errata.htm#23">sacrifices</a> by the mind (meditation), some by words (recitation of particular prayers, or <i>Yapa</i>); and some by acts (actual consummation of the <i>Yatishtoma</i> and other costly rites). The person, however, who seeketh Brahman through Truth, obtaineth his desired objects at home. When however, one's purposes become abortive (through absence of knowledge of Self), one should adopt vows of silence and such like, called <i>Dikshavrata</i>. Indeed, <i>Diksha</i> cometh from the root <i>Diksha</i>, meaning the observance of vows. As regards those that have knowledge of Self, with them Truth is the highest object of pursuit.'</p>  
 <p>'The fruits of knowledge are visible; asceticism yieldeth fruits hereafter. A Brahmana who (without knowledge and asceticism) hath only read much should only be known as a great reader. Therefore, O Kshatriya, never think that one can be a <i>Brahman</i> (<i>Brahman</i>-knowing) by only reading the scriptures. He, on the other hand, should be known by thee to be possessed of the knowledge of the Brahman who doth not deviate from Truth. O Kshatriya, the verses that were recited by Atharvan to a conclave of great sages, in days of old, are known by the name of <i>Chhandas</i>. They are not be regarded as acquainted with the <i>Chhandas</i> who have only read through the <i>Vedas</i>, without having attained to the knowledge of Him who is<a href="errata.htm#24"> </a>known through the <i>Vedas</i>. The <i>Chhandas</i>, O best of men, become the means of obtaining <i>Brahman</i> independently and without the necessity of anything foreign. They cannot be regarded as acquainted with the <i>Chhandas</i> who are acquainted only with the modes of sacrifice enjoined in the <i>Vedas</i>. On the other hand, having waited upon those that are acquainted with the <i>Vedas</i>, have not the righteous attained to the Object that is knowable by the <i>Vedas</i>? There is none who hath truly caught the sense of the <i>Vedas</i> or there may be some who have, O king, caught the sense. He that hath only read the <i>Vedas</i>, doth not know the Object knowable by them. He, however, that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 101</font></a></p>  
 <p>is established in Truth, know the Object knowable by the <i>Vedas</i>. Amongst those faculties which lead to perception of the body as the acting agent, there is none by which true knowledge may be acquired. By the mind alone one cannot acquire the knowledge of Self and Not-Self. Indeed, he that knoweth Self also knoweth what is Not-self. He, on the other hand, that knoweth only what is Not-self, doth not know Truth. He, again, that knoweth the proofs, knoweth also that which is sought to be proved. But what that Object in its nature is (which is sought to be proved) is not known to either the <i>Vedas</i> or those that are acquainted with the <i>Vedas</i>. For all that, however, those Brahmanas that are (truly) acquainted with the <i>Vedas</i> succeed in obtaining a knowledge of the Object knowable (by the <i>Vedas</i>) through the <i>Vedas</i>. As the branch of a particular tree is sometimes resorted to for pointing out the lunar digit of the first day of the lighted fortnight so the <i>Vedas</i> are used for <a href="errata.htm#25">indicating</a> the <a href="errata.htm#26">highest</a> attributes of the Supreme Soul. I know him to be a <i>Brahmana</i> (possessing a knowledge of <i>Brahman</i>) who expoundeth the doubts of others, having himself mastered all his own doubts, and who is <a href="errata.htm#27">possessed</a> of the knowledge of Self. One cannot find what the Soul is by seeking in the East, the South, the West, the North, or in the subsidiary directions or horizontally. Very rarely can it be found in him who regardeth this body be to Self. Beyond the conception of even the <i>Vedas</i>, the man of Yoga-meditation only can behold the Supreme. Completely restraining all thy senses and thy mind also seek thou that <i>Brahman</i> which is known to reside in thy own Soul. He is not a <i>Muni</i> who practiseth only <i>Yoga</i>-meditation; nor he who liveth only in the woods (having retired from the world). He, however, is a <i>Muni</i> and is superior to all who knoweth his own nature. In consequence of one's being able to <a href="errata.htm#28">expound</a> every object (<i>Vyakarana</i>), one is said to be endued with universal knowledge (<i>Vaiyakarana</i>); and, indeed, the science itself is called <i>Vyakarana</i> owing to its being able to expound every object to its very root (which is <i>Brahman</i>). The man who beholdeth all the regions as present before his eyes, is said to be possessed of universal knowledge. He that stayeth in Truth and knoweth <i>Brahman</i> is said to be a <i>Brahmana</i>, and a <i>Brahmana</i>, possesseth universal knowledge. A <i>Kshatriya</i> also, that practises such virtues, may behold <i>Brahman</i>. He may also attain to that high state by ascending step by step, according to what is indicated in the <i>Vedas</i>. Knowing it for certain, I tell thee this.'"</p>
