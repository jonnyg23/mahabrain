For Pra<i>g</i>âpati, having freed himself from evil, death, asked for food; hence, to this day, a sick man, when he gets better, asks for food; and people have hope for him, thinking, 'He asks for food, he will live.' The gods gave him that food, these (bricks) relating to the metres; for the metres are cattle, and cattle are food. They (the metres) pleased him, and inasmuch as they pleased (<i>kh</i>and) him they are (called) metres (<i>kh</i>andas).</p>

Now of those which he lays down in front, the first is the out (and in)-breathing, the second the through-breathing, the third the up-breathing, the fourth the up-breathing, the fifth the through-breathing, the sixth the out-breathing, the seventh the out-breathing, the eighth the through-breathing, the ninth the up-breathing, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself: this same Sacrificer, being raised and firmly established on this Virâ<i>g</i> (brick), made up of breath, lays down (bricks) extending both backward and forward, for the breathings move both backward and forward.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:5:2:8">8:5:2:8</a></font></span>8. And of those on the right (south) side, the first is Agni (fire), the second Vâyu (the wind), the third Âditya (the sun), the fourth Âditya, the fifth Vâyu, the sixth Agni, the seventh Agni, the eighth Vâyu, the ninth Âditya, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself: this same Sacrificer, being raised and firmly established on this Virâ<i>g</i>, made up of deities, puts on (bricks) extending both hitherwards and thitherwards, for those gods move both hitherwards and thitherwards.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:5:2:9">8:5:2:9</a></font></span>9. And of those behind, the first is this (terrestrial) world, the second the air, the third the sky, the fourth the sky, the fifth the air, the sixth this world, the seventh this world, the eighth the air, the ninth the sky, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself: this same Sacrificer, being raised and firmly established on that Virâ<i>g</i> made up of the worlds, lays down (bricks) extending both hitherwards and thitherwards;--whence these worlds extend both hitherwards and thitherwards.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:5:2:10">8:5:2:10</a></font></span>10. And of those on the left (north) side, the first is the summer, the second the rainy season, the</p>

 <p>third the winter, the fourth the winter, the fifth the rainy season, the sixth the summer, the seventh the summer, the eighth the rainy season, the ninth the winter, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself: this same Sacrificer, being raised and firmly established on that Virâ<i>g</i>, made up of the seasons, lays down (bricks) extending both hitherwards and thitherwards;--whence those seasons move both hitherwards and thitherwards <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">1</font></a>.</p>

There are ten of them, for there are ten vital airs. He places them in the front part, for these vital airs are in the front part.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:5:2:12">8:5:2:12</a></font></span>12. And those on the right (south) side are the deities,--Agni, the Earth, Vâyu, the Air, Âditya, the Sky, <i>K</i>andra (the moon), the Stars, Food, and Water.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:5:2:13">8:5:2:13</a></font></span>13. And those behind are the regions (quarters),--four regions, four intermediate regions, the upper region, and this (earth).</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:5:2:14">8:5:2:14</a></font></span>14. And those on the left (north) side are the months,--two spring-months, two summer-months, two months of the rainy season, two autumn-months, and two winter-months.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:5:2:15">8:5:2:15</a></font></span>15. And, again, the first ten are this (terrestrial) world, the second the air, the third the sky. By the first set of ten they (the gods) ascended this (earth), by the second the air, by the third the sky; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, by the first set of ten, ascend this (earth), by the second the air, and by the third the sky.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8:5:2:16">8:5:2:16</a></font></span>16. This, then, is, as it were, an ascent away from</p>

 <p><a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 92</font></a></p>  
 <p>here; but this (earth) is the foundation: the gods came back to this (earth), the foundation; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now come back to this (earth), the foundation. And that last set of ten is this world: hence, even as (takes place) that start from the first set of ten, so from the last; for this is the same,--those two sets of ten (the first and last) are this (terrestrial) world.</p>

Now these are forty bricks and forty formulas,--that makes eighty, and eighty (a<i>s</i>îti) means food <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">1</font></a>: thus whatever he now says that he makes to be food, a<i>s</i>îti, and gives it him, and thereby gratifies him (Agni).</p>
