 <p>"Janamejaya said, 'Having heard these words, O regenerate one, that were spoken by the high-souled Vyasa in respect of the horse-sacrifice, what steps were taken by Yudhishthira? Do thou tell me, O foremost of regenerate ones, how the king succeeded in obtaining the wealth which Marutta had buried in the Earth.'</p>  
 <p>"Vaisampayana said, 'Having heard the words of the Island-born ascetic, king Yudhishthira the just, summoned all his brothers, <i>viz.</i>, Arjuna and Bhimasena and the twin sons of Madri, in proper time and then said unto them (the following words),--'Ye heroes, you have heard the words which the</p>

 <p>highly intelligent and high-souled Krishna has said from his friendship for and the desire of doing good to the Kurus! <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">1</font></a> Verily, you have heard those words that have been uttered by that ascetic of abundant penances, that great sage desirous of bestowing prosperity on his friends, that preceptor of righteous behaviour, <i>viz.</i>, Vyasa of wonderful feats. You have heard what Bhishma also said, and what Govinda too of great intelligence has uttered. Remembering those words, ye gong of Pandu, I desire to obey them duly. By obeying those words of theirs great blessedness will attach to all of you. Those words spoken by those utterers of Brahma are certain (if obeyed) to bring in their train considerable benefit. Ye perpetuators of Kuru's race, the Earth has become divested of her wealth. Ye kings, Vyasa, therefore, informed us of the wealth (that lies buried in the Earth) of Marutta. If you think that wealth abundant or sufficient, how shall we bring it (to our capital)? What, O Bhima, dost thou think as regards this? When the king, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, said these words, Bhimasena, joining his hands, said these words in reply,--'The words thou hast said, O thou of mighty-arms, on the subject of bringing the wealth indicated by Vyasa, are approved by me. If, O puissant one, we succeed in getting the wealth kept there by the son of Avikshita, then this sacrifice, O king, purposed by us will be easily accomplished. Even this is what I think. We shall, therefore, bowing our heads unto the high-souled Girisa, and offering due worship unto that deity, bring that wealth. Blessed be thou. Gratifying that god of gods, as also his companions and followers, in words, thought, and deed, we shall, without doubt, obtain that wealth. Those Kinnaras of fierce mien who are protecting that treasure will certainly yield to us if the great deity having the bull for his sign become gratified with us!'--Hearing these words uttered by Bhima, O Bharata, king Yudhishthira the son of Dharma became highly pleased. The others, headed by Arjuna, at the same time, said, 'So be it.' The Pandavas then, having resolved to bring that wealth, ordered their forces to march under the constellation Dhruba and on the day called by the same name. <a name="fr_178"></a><a href="#fn_178"><font size="1">2</font></a> Causing the Brahmanas to utter benedictions on them, and having duly worshipped the great god Maheswara, the sons of Pandu get out (on their enterprise). Gratifying that high-souled deity with Modakas and frumenty and with cakes made of meat, the sons of Pandu set out with cheerful hearts. While they thus set out, the citizen, and many foremost of Brahmanas, with cheerful hearts, uttered auspicious blessings (on their heads). The Pandavas, circumambulating many Brahmanas that daily worshipped their fires, and bending their heads unto them, proceeded on their journey. Taking the permission of king Dhritarashtra who was afflicted with grief on account of the death of his sons, his queen (Gandhari), and Pritha also of large eyes, and keeping the Kaurava prince Yuyutsu, the</p>

 <p>son of Dhritarashtra, in the capital, they set out, worshipped by the citizens and by many Brahmanas possessed of great wisdom.'"</p>
