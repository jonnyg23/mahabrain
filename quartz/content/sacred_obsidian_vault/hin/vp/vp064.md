 <p><font size="-1">Of the different hells or divisions of Naraka, below Pátála: the crimes punished in them respectively: efficacy of expiation: meditation on Vishńu the most effective expiation.</font></p>  
 <p>PARÁŚARA.--I will now, great Muni, give you an account of the hells which are situated beneath the earth and beneath the waters <a name="fr_655"></a><a href="#fn_655"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and into which sinners are finally sent.</p>  
 <p>The names of the different Narakas are as follows: Raurava, Śúkara, Rodha, Tála, Viśasana, Mahájwála, Taptakumbha, Lavańa, Vimohana, Rudhirándha, Vaitaraní, Krimíśa, Krimibhojana, Asipatravana, Krishńa, Lálábhaksha, Dáruńa, Púyaváha, Pápa, Vahnijwála, Adhośiras, Sandansa, Kálasútra, Tamas, Avíchi, Śwabhojana, Apratisht́ha, and another Avíchi <a name="fr_656"></a><a href="#fn_656"><font size="1">2</font></a>. These and many other fearful hells are the awful provinces of the kingdom of Yama, terrible with instruments of torture and with fire; into which are hurled all those who are addicted when alive to sinful practices <a name="fr_657"></a><a href="#fn_657"><font size="1">3</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>The man who bears false witness through partiality, or who utters any falsehood, is condemned to the Raurava (dreadful) hell. He who causes abortion, plunders a town, kills a cow, or strangles a man, goes to the</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Rodha hell (or that of obstruction). The murderer of a Brahman, stealer of gold, or drinker of wine, goes to the Súkara (swine) hell; as does any one who associates with them. The murderer of a man of the second or third castes, and one who is guilty of adultery with the wife of his spiritual teacher, is sentenced to the Tála (padlock) hell: and one who holds incestuous intercourse with a sister, or murders an ambassador, to Taptakumbha (or the hell of heated caldrons). The seller of his wife, a gaoler, a horsedealer, and one who deserts his adherents, falls into the Taptaloha (red-hot iron) hell. He who commits incest with a daughter-in-law or a daughter is cast into the Mahájwála hell (or that of great flame): and he who is disrespectful to his spiritual guide, who is abusive to his betters, who reviles the Vedas, or who sells them <a name="fr_658"></a><a href="#fn_658"><font size="1">4</font></a>, who associates with women in a prohibited degree, into the Lavańa (salt) hell. A thief and a contemner of prescribed observances falls into Vimohana (the place of bewildering). He who hates his father, the Brahmans, and the gods, or who spoils precious gems, is punished in the Krimibhaksha hell (where worms are his food): and he who practises magic rites for the harm of others, in the hell called Krimíśa (that of insects). The vile wretch who eats his meal before offering food to the gods, to the manes, or to guests, falls into the hell called Lálábhaksha (where saliva is given for food). The maker of arrows is sentenced to the Vedhaka (piercing) hell: and the maker of lances, swords, and other weapons, to the dreadful hell called Viśasana (murderous). He who takes unlawful gifts goes to the Adhomukha (or head-inverted) hell; as does one who offers sacrifices to improper objects, and an observer of the stars (for the prediction of events). He who eats by himself sweetmeats mixed with his rice <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_659"><font size="1">5</font></a>, and a Brahman who vends Lac, flesh, liquors, sesamum, or salt, or one who commits violence, fall into the hell (where matter flows, or) Púyaváha; as do they who rear cats, cocks, goats, dogs, hogs, or birds. Public performers <a name="fr_660"></a><a href="#fn_660"><font size="1">6</font></a>, fishermen, the follower of one born in adultery, a poisoner,</p>

 <p>an informer, one who lives by his wife's prostitution <a name="fr_661"></a><a href="#fn_661"><font size="1">7</font></a>, one who attends to secular affairs on the days of the Parvas (or full and new moon, &amp;c.) <a name="fr_662"></a><a href="#fn_662"><font size="1">8</font></a>, an incendiary, a treacherous friend, a soothsayer, one who performs religious ceremonies for rustics, and those who sell the acid Asclepias, used in sacrifices, go to the Rudhirándha hell (whose wells are of blood). He who destroys a bee-hive, or pillages a hamlet, is condemned to the Vaitarańí hell. He who causes impotence, trespasses on others' lands, is impure, or who lives by fraud, is punished in the hell called (black, or) Krishńa. He who wantonly cuts down trees goes to the Asipatravana hell (the leaves of whose trees are swords): and a tender on sheep, and hunter of deer, to the hell termed Vahnijwála (or fiery flame); as do those who apply fire to unbaked vessels (potters). The violator of a vow, and one who breaks the rules of his order, falls into the Sandansa (or hell of pincers): and the religious student who sleeps in the day, and is, though unconsciously, defiled; and they who, though mature, are instructed in sacred literature by their children, receive punishment in the hell called Śwabhojana (where they feed upon dogs). These hells, and hundreds and thousands of others, are the places in which sinners pay the penalty of their crimes. As numerous as are the offences that men commit, so many are the hells in which they are punished: and all who deviate from the duties imposed upon them by their caste and condition, whether in thought, word, or deed, are sentenced to punishment in the regions of the damned <a name="fr_663"></a><a href="#fn_663"><font size="1">9</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>The gods in heaven are beheld by the inhabitants of hell, as they move with their heads inverted; whilst the god, as they cast their eyes</p>

 <p>downwards, behold the sufferings of those in hell <a name="fr_664"></a><a href="#fn_664"><font size="1">10</font></a>. The various stages of existence, Maitreya, are inanimate things, fish, birds, animals, men, holy men, gods, and liberated spirits; each in succession a thousand degrees superior to that which precedes it: and through these stages the beings that are either in heaven or in hell are destined to proceed, until final emancipation be obtained <a name="fr_665"></a><a href="#fn_665"><font size="1">11</font></a>. That sinner goes to Naraka who neglects the due expiation of his guilt.</p>  
 <p>For, Maitreya, suitable acts of expiation have been enjoined by the great sages for every kind of crime <a name="fr_666"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">12</font></a>. Arduous penances for great sins, trifling ones for minor offences, have been propounded by Swáyambhuva and others: but reliance upon Krishńa is far better than any such expiatory acts, as religious austerity, or the like. Let any one who repents of the sin of which he may have been culpable have recourse to this best of all expiations, remembrance of Hari <a name="fr_667"></a><a href="#fn_667"><font size="1">13</font></a>: by addressing his thoughts to Náráyańa at dawn, at night, at sunset, and midday, a man shall be quickly cleansed from all guilt: the whole heap of worldly sorrows is dispersed by meditating on Hari; and his worshipper, looking upon heavenly fruition as an impediment to felicity, obtains final emancipation. He</p>

 <p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="green">p. 211</font></a></p>  
 <p>whose mind is devoted to Hari in silent prayer, burnt-offering, or adoration, is impatient even of the glory of the king of the gods. Of what avail is ascent to the summit of heaven, if it is necessary to return from thence to earth. How different is the meditation on Vásudeva, which is the seed of eternal freedom. Hence, Muni, the man who thinks of Vishńu, day and night, goes not to Naraka after death, for all his sins are atoned for.</p>  
 <p>Heaven (or Swarga) is that which delights the mind; hell (or Naraka) is that which gives it pain: hence vice is called hell; virtue is called heaven <a name="fr_668"></a><a href="#fn_668"><font size="1">14</font></a>. The selfsame thing is applicable to the production of pleasure or pain, of malice or of anger. Whence then can it be considered as essentially the same with either? That which at one time is a source of enjoyment, becomes at another the cause of suffering; and the same thing may at different seasons excite wrath, or conciliate favour. It follows, then, that nothing is in itself either pleasurable or painful; and pleasure and pain, and the like, are merely definitions of various states of mind. That which alone is truth is wisdom; but wisdom may be the cause of confinement to existence; for all this universe is wisdom, there is nothing different from it; and consequently, Maitreya, you are to conclude that both knowledge and ignorance are comprised in wisdom <a name="fr_669"></a><a href="#fn_669"><font size="1">15</font></a>.</p>  
 <p>I have thus described to you the orb of the earth; the regions below its surface, or Pátálas; and the Narakas, or hells; and have briefly enumerated its oceans, mountains, continents, regions, and rivers: what else do you wish to hear?</p>

 <h3 align="CENTER">Footnotes</h3>
 <p><a name="fn_655"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_655">207:1</a> The Bhágavata places the Narakas above the waters. The commentator on our text endeavours to reconcile the difference, by explaining the text to imply a dark cavity in which the waters are received, not the original abysses where they were collected at first, and above which Tartarus lies.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_656"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_656">207:2</a> Some of these names are the same that are given by Manu, b. IV. v. 88-90. Kullúka Bhat́t́a refers to the Márkańd́eya P. for a description of the twenty-one divisions of hell; but the account there given is not more ample than that of our text. The Bhágavata enumerates twenty-eight, but many of the names differ from the above. In the last instance the term Avíchi is either inaccurately repeated, or the adjective Apara is intended to distinguish it from the previous Avíchi. In Manu, Mahávíchi occurs.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_657"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_657">207:3</a> The Padma P. (Kriya Yoga Sára) and the Śiva Dharma, which appears to be a section of the Skánda P., contain a number of interesting circumstances previous to the infliction of punishment. It appears also from them that Yama fulfils the office of judge of the dead, as well as sovereign of the damned; all that die appearing before him, and being confronted with Chitragupta, the recorder, by whom their actions have been registered. The virtuous are thence conveyed to Swarga, or Elysium, whilst the wicked are driven to the different regions of Naraka, or Tartarus.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_658"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_658">208:4</a> 'Who teaches the Vedas for hire.' This notion still prevails, and renders the few Pandits who are acquainted with the Vedas very unwilling to teach them for a gratuity.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_659"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_659">208:5</a> 'Thereby,' observes the commentator, 'defrauding or disappointing children.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_660"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_660">208:6</a> Rangopajivina: the commentator explains it wrestlers and boxers, but Ranga applies to any stage or arena.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_661"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_661">209:7</a> The term in the text is Máhishika, which might mean a feeder of buffaloes; but the commentator quotes a text from the Smriti, authorizing the sense above followed.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_662"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_662">209:8</a> This is the interpretation of Parvakárí; it is also read Parvagámí, he who cohabits with his wife on prohibited days.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_663"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_663">209:9</a> An account of Naraka is found in only a few of the Puráńas, and in less detail than in the text. The Bhágavata and Váyu have similar descriptions of them. The Márkańd́eya enters into detail in some of the instances only. A short account is found in the Śiva, Garura, and Brahma Vaivartta P. and in the Káśí Khańd́a of the Skánda P. The fullest descriptions, however, are those mentioned in a previous note as being in the Śiva Dharma of the Skánda, and Kriya Yoga Sára of the Padma; works of a somewhat equivocal character, and belonging rather to Tántra than Pauráńik literature.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_664"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_664">210:10</a> The commentator observes that the sight of heavenly bliss is given to the damned in order to exacerbate their torments; whilst the inflictions of hell are exhibited to the gods to teach them disregard of even heavenly enjoyments, as they are but of temporary duration.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_665"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_665">210:11</a> That is, when punishment or reward in hell or heaven, proportioned to the sin or virtue of the individual, has been received, he must be born again as a stone or plant, and gradually migrate through the several inferior conditions, until he is once more born a man; his future state is then in his own power.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_666"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_666">210:12</a> Manu is here especially intended, as the commentator observes.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_667"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_667">210:13</a> This remembrance of Vishńu is the frequent reiteration of any or all of his names: hence the lower orders of Hindus procure a starling or parrot, that, in the act of teaching it to cry Ráma or Krishńa or Rádhá, they may themselves repeat these appellations; the simple recitation of which, even if accidentally, irreverently, or reluctantly performed, is meritorious. Thus according to the Vishńu Disarms Tantra: 'Let a man ever and every where repeat the names of the discus-armed (Vishńu); for its repetition, even by one who is impure, is a means of purification. Hari removes all sins, even when invoked by evil-minded persons, as fire burns one by whom it is unwillingly approached.'</p>
 <p><a name="fn_668"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_668">211:14</a> The object of the text, according to the commentator, is to shew that the common notions of heaven and hell are erroneous; that they are only temporal pleasure and temporal pain; and virtue and vice, being the origin of transient, and therefore unreal effects, are themselves unrealities: there is nothing real but faith in Vishńu.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_669"></a><a href="vp064.htm#fr_669">211:15</a> Text and comment are here somewhat obscure; but the purport of the former seems to be the explanation of the existence of Jnyán wisdom, both as a genus and a species: in the former case it is all that is; and in the latter, it may be either true or false wisdom: the latter being influenced by notions of self or individuality, and therefore the cause of confinement to existence; the former dissipating the belief of self, and being therefore the cause of liberation from bodily being.</p>
