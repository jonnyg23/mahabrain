Pompey,  who had taken possession of Further Spain, while Caesar was detained in  Italy in exhibiting games. Pompey began to throw himself on the protection  of every state, in order the more readily to establish the means of defense  against him. Accordingly, with a considerable force which had been  collected, partly by entreaty, partly by force, he began to lay waste the  province. Under these circumstances some states voluntarily sent him  supplies, others shut the gates of their towns against him. If any of these  chanced to fall into his hands by assault, although some citizen in it had  deserved well of Cn. Pompey (his father), yet some cause was alleged  against him on account of the greatness of his wealth, so that, he being  dispatched, his fortune might become the reward of the soldiers. Thus the  enemy, being encouraged by a few advantages, their forces increased much,  wherefore those states which were opposed to Pompey, by continual  messages dispatched to Italy, sought protection for themselves.

Pompey; these  informed him that it would be an easy matter to make himself master of the  town by night, because the enemy as yet knew nothing of his arrival in the  province, as the scouts sent out by Cn. Pompey to inform him of Caesar's  approach had been all made prisoners. They alleged besides many other very  plausible reasons. He, therefore, immediately sent intelligence of his arrival  to Q. Pedius, and Q. Fabius Maximus his lieutenants, to whom he had left  the command of the troops in the province, ordering them to send him all  the cavalry they had been able to raise. He came up with them much sooner  than they expected, and had not the protection of the cavalry, according to  his desire.

Young Cneius Pompey himself was employed in the siege of Ulia,  which had now lasted some months. Notice of Caesar's arrival having been  received, messengers having passed Pompey's guards came to him from that  town and besought him to send them relief as soon as possible. Caesar,  knowing that this people had deserved very well of the Romans, detached,  about nine o'clock, at night eleven cohorts, with a like number of horse,  under the command of L. Julius Paciecus, a man known in that province,  and also well acquainted with it. When he arrived at Pompey's quarter, a  dreadful tempest arising, attended with a violent wind, so great a darkness  ensued that you could scarcely have distinguished even the person next you.  This accident proved of great advantage to Paciecus: for being arrived at  Pompey's camp, he ordered the cavalry to advance two by two, and march  directly through the enemy's quarters to the town; one of their guards calling  to know who passed, one of our troopers bade him be silent, for they were  just then endeavoring by stealth to approach the wall, in order to get  possession of the town; and partly by this answer, partly by favor of the  tempest, the sentinels were prevented from examining things diligently.  When they reached the gates, upon a signal being given, they were admitted;  and both horse and foot raising a loud shout, after leaving some troops to  guard the town, sallied in a body upon the enemy's camp. This came upon  them so unexpectedly that the greater number of the men in the camps  thought that they were captured.

Pompei Caesarem cum adissent, petere coeperunt uti sibi primo quoque tempore subsidium mitteret. Caesar -- eam civitatem omni tempore optime de populo Romano meritam esse -- celeriter sex cohortis secunda vigilia iubet proficisci, pari equites numero. Quibus praefecit hominem eius provinciae notum et non parum scientem, L. Vibiurn Paciaecum. Qui cum ad Cn.

By this stratagem they could not  possibly be perceived by those of Corduba. Upon their approach to the  walls, the enemy sallied in great numbers to attack our cavalry; when the  infantry, whom we have mentioned above, leaping down, fell upon them  with such fury that out of an almost infinite multitude of men, very few  returned to the town. This so alarmed Sextus Pompey that he immediately  sent letters to his brother, requesting him to come speedily to his relief, lest  Caesar should make himself master of Corduba before his arrival. Thus Cn.  Pompey, moved by his brother's letters, quitted the siege of Ulia, which was  upon the point of surrendering, and set out toward Corduba.

Thus  having formed a bridge, he transported his troops in three bodies to the  camps. As I have just mentioned, the beams of the bridge stretched over  against the tower in two rows. Pompey, arriving soon after with his troops,  encamped directly over against him. Caesar, to cut off his provisions and  communication with the town, ran a line from his camp to the bridge.  Pompey did the same; so that a struggle arose between the two generals,  which should first get possession of the bridge; and this daily brought on  skirmishes, in which sometimes the one, sometimes the other party had the  better. When these merged into a serious engagement, both sides fought  hand to hand; in the heat of the struggle for this position, owing to the  narrowness of the bridge, they were pressed together, and in their efforts to  extend themselves toward the river-side, many fell headlong. Thus the loss  was pretty equal; for on either side lay heaps of slain, and Caesar for many  days used all possible endeavors to bring the enemy to an engagement on  equal terms, that he might bring the war to a conclusion as soon as possible.

Caesar, ut eum ab oppido comineatuque excluderet, bracchium ad pontem ducere coepit: pari idem condicione Pompeius facit. Hic inter duces duos fit contentio uter prius pontem occuparet; ex qua contentione cotidiana minuta proelia fiebant, ut modo hi, non numquam illi superiores discederent. Quae res cum ad maiorem contentionem venisset, ab utrisque comminus pugna inita, dum cupidius locum student tenere, propter pontem coagulabantur, fluminis ripas appropinquantes coangustati praecipitabantur. Hic alternis non solum morti mortem exaggerabant, sed tumulos tumulis exaequabant. Ita diebus compluribus [consumptis] cupiebat Caesar, si qua condicione posset, adversarios in aequum locum deducere et primo quoque tempore de bello decernere.

Pompey, being  informed of this by the deserters, on the same day brought back many  carriages and machines by narrow paths, and betook himself to Corduba.  Caesar began his attack upon Ategua, and carried lines quite round the  town. Pompey, having intelligence of this, set out upon his march the same  day. In order to guard against his arrival, Caesar possessed himself of many  forts; partly to shelter his cavalry, partly to post guards of infantry for the  defense of his camp. Pompey's arrival happened at a time when the mist was  very thick, so that he found means, with some cohorts and troops of cavalry,  to hem in a party of Caesar's horse, and fell upon them in such manner that  very few escaped slaughter.

Caesar  cast up a mound and brought forward his machines, with other preparations  which were necessary for storming the town. The country all around is  mountainous, and seems formed for war, being separated from the plain by  the river Rio Salado, ascending on the side toward Ategua, about two miles  from the river. Pompey's camp was upon these mountains, within view of  both towns; he could, however, send no relief to his friends. He had the  emblems and standards of thirteen legions, but of those on whom he trusted  for support two were natives which had deserted from Trebonius; one was  formed out of the Roman colonies in those parts; and a fourth, belonging to  Afranius, he had brought with him from Africa; the rest were for the most  part made up of fugitives and deserters; in light-armed foot and cavalry we  far exceeded him in both courage and numbers.

Haec loca sunt montuosa et natura impedita ad rem militarem; quae planitie dividuntur, Salso flumine, proxime tamen Ateguam ut flumen sit circiter passus duo milia. Ex ea regione oppidi in montibus castra habuit posita Pompeius in conspectu utrorumque oppidorum, neque suis ausus est subsidio venire. Aquilas et signa habuit XIII legionum; sed ex quibus aliquid firmamenti se existimabat habere duae fuerunt vernaculae, quae a Trebonio transfugerant; una facta ex coloniis quae fuerunt in his regionibus; quarta fuit Afraniana ex Africa quam secum adduxerat; +reliquae ex fugitivis auxiliares consistebant+: nam de levi armatura et equitatu longe et virtute et numero nostri erant superiores.

 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="spa_8">8</a></font></span>Another reason why Pompey was enabled to  protract the war was that the country was full of mountains and extremely  well adapted to encampments. For almost the whole province of Further  Spain, though of an extremely fertile soil, and abounding in springs, is  nevertheless very difficult of access. Here too, on account of the frequent  incursions of the natives, all the places remote from great towns, are  fortified with towers and castles, covered as in Africa, not with tiles but  with earth, on these they place sentinels, and their high situation commands  an extensive view of the country on all sides. Nay, the greatest part of the  towns of this province are built on mountains, and places exceedingly strong  by nature, the approaches to which are extremely difficult. Thus sieges are  rare and hazardous in Spain, since it is not easy to reduce their towns by  force; as happened in the present war. For Pompey having established his  camp between Ategua and Ucubis, as related above, and within view of both  towns, Caesar possessed himself of an eminence very conveniently situated,  and only about four miles from his own camp, on which he built a fortress.

 Accedebat hoc ut longius duceret bellum Pompeius, quod loca sunt edita et ad castrorum munitiones non parum idonea. nam fere totius ulterioris Hispaniae regio propter terrae fecundidatem inopem difficilemque habet oppugnationem et non nimis copiosam aquationem. Hic etiam propter barbarorum crebras excursiones omnia loca quae sunt ab oppidis remota, turribus et munitionibus retinentur, sicut in Africa; rudere, non tegulis teguntur. simulque in his habent speculas et propter altitudinem late longeque prospiciunt. Item oppidorum magna pars eius provinciae montibus fere munita et natura excellentibus locis est constituta, ut simul aditus ascensusque habeat difficiles. Ita ab oppugnationibus natura loci distinentur ut civitates Hispaniae non facile ab hoste capiantur. Id quod in hoc contigit bello. Nam cum inter Ateguam et Ucubim, quae oppida supra sunt scripta, Pompeius ut habuit castra constituta in conspectu duorum oppidorum, ab suis castris circiter milia passuum IIII grumus est excellens natura qui appellatur Castra Postumiana.

Influenced by this belief, he set out about midnight  and attacked the fort, that he might bring assistance to the besieged. Our  troops, upon their approach, setting up a shout, discharged their javelins in  great numbers, and wounded multitudes of men. After this, when those in  the camp began to resist, and when tidings of it was conveyed to the great  camps to Caesar, he set out with three legions, and when he approached  them, many were killed, owing to their trepidation and flight, and a great  number made prisoners. Among these two * * *; and many others, having  thrown down their arms escaped, so that fourscore shields were found.

A spy, belonging to  Pompey's second legion, was taken and slain. At the same time, a bullet was  shot into the town, with this inscription: "That he should set up a shield on  whatever day they advanced to storm the town." This encouraging some to  hope that they might scale the walls, and possess themselves of the town  without danger, they fell the next day to sapping them, and threw down a  considerable part of the outward wall. * * In this action, being captured and  protected by the townsmen, as if they had been of their own party, they  requested Caesar to dismiss in armor even those who were appointed over  the city by Pompey to guard it. To this Caesar answered, "That it was his  custom to give, not accept of conditions:" which being reported to the  garrison, they set up a shout, and began to pour their darts upon our men  from the whole circuit of the wall; which gave reason to believe that the  garrison intended that day to make a vigorous sally. Wherefore, surrounding  the town with our troops, the conflict was for some time maintained with  great violence, and one of our engines threw down a tower belonging to the  enemy, in which were five of their men, and a boy, whose office it was to  observe the engine.

 Eius praeteriti temporis Pompeius trans flumen Salsum castellum constituit neque a nostris prohibitus falsaque illa opinione gloriatus est quod prope in nostris partibus locum tenuisset.

For a select body of the  enemy's light-armed foot, coming unexpectedly upon our horse, they  alighted to sustain the charge. Thus in a very little time, from a cavalry it  became an infantry engagement, and again from an infantry changed to a  cavalry engagement, in which our men were driven back to their very lines;  but being there reinforced, about a hundred and twenty-three of the enemy  were slain, several forced to throw down their arms, many wounded, and the  rest pursued quite to their camp. On our side, three were slain, besides  twelve foot-soldiers and five troopers wounded. Toward the evening of the  same day, the fight, as usual, was renewed before the walls: and the enemy  having thrown many darts, and a great quantity of fire from the battlements,  proceeded afterward to an action of unexampled cruelty and barbarity: for in  the very sight of our troops they fell to murdering the citizens, and tumbling  them headlong from the walls, as is usual among barbarians: no parallel to  this is to be found in the memory of man.

 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="spa_16">16</a></font></span>When night came on, Pompey sent a messenger  unknown to us, to exhort the garrison to set fire to our towers and mound,  and make a sally at midnight. Accordingly, having poured upon us a great  quantity of darts and fire, and destroyed a considerable part of the rampart,  they opened the gate which lay over against and within view of Pompey's  camp, and sallied out with all their forces, carrying with them fascines to fill  up the ditch; hooks and fire to destroy and reduce to ashes the barracks,  which the soldiers had built mostly of reeds to defend them from the winter;  and some silver and rich apparel to scatter among the tents, that while our  men should be employed in securing the plunder, they might fight their way  through and escape to Pompey; who, in expectation that they would be able  to effect their design, had crossed the Rio Salado with his army, where he  continued all night in order of battle, to favor their retreat. But though our  men had no apprehension of this design, their valor enabled them to  frustrate the attempt, and repulse the enemy with many wounds. They even  made themselves masters of the spoil, their arms, and some prisoners, who  were put to death next day. At the same time, a deserter from the town  informed us that Junius, who was employed in the mine when the citizens  were massacred, exclaimed that it was a cruel and barbarous action-"that  they had never deserved such treatment at their hands-for that they had  received them in their temples and their homes-that it was in violation of  all hospitality." He added many things besides, which made such an  impression upon the garrison that they desisted from the massacre.

Antonius of Lusitania, came to Caesar, and addressed  him to this effect: "Would to Heaven I had been one of your soldiers rather  than a follower of C. Pompey, and given those proofs of valor and  constancy in obtaining victories for you, rather than in suffering for him.  The only advantage we reap from following his banners are wretched  applauses; being reduced to the condition of indigent citizens, and by the  melancholy fate of our country ranked among its enemies; we, who having  never shared with Pompey his good fortune, yet find ourselves involved in  his disgrace; and after sustaining the attack of so many armed legions,  employing ourselves day and night in the works of defense, exposed to the  darts and swords of our fellow-citizens; vanquished, deserted by Pompey,  and compelled to give way to the superior valor of your troops, find  ourselves at last obliged to have recourse to your clemency, and implore that  you will not show yourselves less placable to fellow-citizens, than you have  so often been to foreign nations." "I shall," said Caesar, "prove myself the  same to fellow-citizens, as I have been to conquered nations."

Antony did not  follow him, he returned to the gate and laid hold of him, upon which  drawing a poniard from his breast, he wounded him in the hand, and in this  condition they both fled to Caesar. At the same time the standard-bearer of  the first legion came over to our camp, and reported that the day when the  skirmish happened between the horse, no less than thirty-five of his  company fell; but it was not allowed to mention it in Pompey's camp, or so  much as own the loss of one man. A slave, whose master was in Caesar's  camp, and who had left his wife and son in the city, cut his master's throat,  and deceiving the guards, escaped privately to Pompey's camp; whence by  means of a bullet, on which he inscribed his intelligence, Caesar was  informed of the preparations made for the defense of the place. When we  had read the inscription, those who were employed to throw the bullet  returning to the city, two Lusitanian brothers deserted, and informed us that  Pompey in a speech made to his soldiers, had said: "That as he found it  impossible to relieve the town, he was resolved to withdraw in the night  from the sight of the enemy, and retire toward the sea;" to which one  answered "that it was better to hazard a battle than take refuge in flight," but  he who said so was instantly put to death. At the same time some of his  couriers were intercepted, who were endeavoring to get into the town.  Caesar sent the letters to the inhabitants, and ordered one of the messengers  begging his life, to set fire to the townsmen's wooden turret, promising that  if he did this he would grant him all. The enterprise was not without  difficulty: he undertook it, however, but was slain in the attempt. The same  night a deserter informed us that Pompey and Labienus were greatly  offended at the massacre of the citizens.

A sharp encounter ensued under the walls, and the besieged,  assisted by a favorable wind, burned the remaining part of that tower and  another. Next morning a matron threw herself from the wall, and came over  to the camp, reporting, "that the rest of her family had intended the same,  but were apprehended and put to death;" likewise, a letter was thrown over,  in which was written" L. Minatius to Caesar; Pompey has abandoned me; if  you will grant me my life, I promise to serve you with the same fidelity and  attachment I have hitherto manifested toward him." At the same time  deputies who had been sent before to Caesar by the garrison, now waited on  him a second time, offering to deliver up the town next day, upon a bare  grant of their lives: to which he replied, "That he was Caesar, and would  perform his word."

But after many messages backward and forward, when the  deputies were upon their return, the garrison pursued and put them all to the  sword, except two who escaped to Caesar, and informed him of what had  happened. Some time after, the inhabitants of Bursavola, sending spies to  Ategua to know the truth of what had happened, and finding the report of  our deputies confirmed, were for stoning to death him who had been the  cause of the murder of the deputies, and were with difficulty restrained from  laying violent hands upon him, which in the end proved the occasion of  their own destruction. For having obtained leave of the inhabitants to go in  person to Caesar and justify himself, he privately drew together some  troops, and when he thought himself strong enough, returned in the night,  and was treacherously admitted into the town, where he made a dreadful  massacre of the inhabitants, slew all the leaders of the opposite party, and  reduced the place to subjection. Soon after, some slaves who had deserted  informed us that he had sold all the goods of the citizens, and that Pompey  suffered none of his soldiers to quit the camp but unarmed, because, since  the taking of Ategua, many despairing of success fled into Baeturia, having  given over all expectation of victory; and that if any deserted from our  camp, they were put among the light-armed infantry, whose pay was only  sixteen asses a day.

While our  men were employed in the work, some of the enemy fell upon us from the  higher ground, and as we were in no condition to make resistance, wounded  great numbers. Here, as Ennius says, "our men retreated a little." This  occurrence, so contrary to our usual custom, being perceived, two  centurions of the fifth legion passed the river, and restored the battle; when,  pressing upon the enemy with astonishing bravery, one of them fell  overwhelmed by the multitude of darts discharged from above. The other  continued the combat for some time, but seeing himself in danger of being  surrounded, endeavored to make good his retreat, but stumbled and fell. His  death being known, the enemy crowded together in still greater numbers,  upon which our cavalry passed the river, and drove them back to their  intrenchments; so that, while they too eagerly desired to slay them within  their lines, they were surrounded by the cavalry and light-armed troops.  Many of these would have been captured alive, had not their valor been  pre-eminent, for they were so confined by the space included in the fortress,  that the cavalry could not well defend itself. Many of our men were  wounded in these two encounters, and among the rest Clodius Aquitius, but  as the fight was carried on mostly from a distance, none of our men fell,  except the two centurions who sacrificed themselves in the cause of glory.

But Pompey, observing that our fort had  cut off his communication with Aspavia, which is about five miles distant  from Ucubis, judged it necessary to come to a battle. Yet he did not offer it  upon equal terms, but chose to draw up his men upon a hill, that he might  have the advantage of the higher ground. In this respect, when both parties  were seeking the superior position, our men anticipating them, drove them  into the plain, which gave us the advantage. The enemy yielded on all  hands, and we made immense havoc among them. The mountain and not  their valor protected them; of which advantage, and of all relief, our men,  though few in number, would have deprived them had not night intervened.  Three hundred and twenty-four light-armed foot, and about a hundred and  thirty-eight legionary soldiers of their number fell, besides those whose  armor and spoils we carried off.

They therefore began to skirmish with our men  who were at work, the legionaries calling out to us at the same time to  choose our field of battle, with a view to make us believe that they desired  nothing so much as to come to blows; upon this our men quitted the  eminence where they were encamped, and advanced a great way into the  plain. But none of the enemy had the boldness to present themselves,  excepting Antistius Turpio; who, presuming on his strength, and fancying  no one on our side a match for him, offered us defiance. Upon this, as is  recorded of Memnon and Achilles, Q. Pompeius Niger, a Roman knight,  born in Italy, advanced from our ranks to the encounter. The fierce air of  Antistius having engaged the attention of all, the two armies drew up to be  spectators of the issue of this challenge, and expressed as much impatience  as if the whole fortune of the war had depended upon it. The wishes on both  sides for success were equal to the anxiety and concern each felt for his own  combatant. They advanced into the plain with great courage, having each a  resplendent buckler of curious workmanship. And doubtless the combat  would have been soon decided, had not some light-armed foot drawn up  near the lines, to serve as a guard to the camp because of the approach of the  enemy's horse, which we have before alluded to. * * * Our horse, in  retreating to their camp, being warmly pursued by the enemy, suddenly  faced about with great cries; which so terrified the Pompeians, that they  immediately betook themselves to flight, and retreated to their camp with  the loss of many of their men.

The same day, A. Bebius, C. Flavius, and A.  Trebellius, Roman knights of Asta, with their horses richly caparisoned and  adorned with silver, came over to Caesar, and informed him, that all the rest  of the Roman knights in Pompey's camp, had like them conspired to come  and join him, that, on the information of a slave they had all been seized and  cast into custody; that out of this number they only had escaped. The same  day letters were intercepted, sent by Pompey to Ursao, with the usual  greeting, and stating, "That hitherto he had all the success against the enemy  he could desire, and would have ended the war much sooner than was  expected, could he have brought them to engage him upon equal terms; that  he did not think it advisable to venture new-levied troops on a plain; that the  enemy, depending on our supplies, as yet protract the war for they storm city  after city, thence supplying themselves with provisions: that he would  therefore endeavor to protect the towns of his party, and bring the war to as  speedy an issue as possible: that he would send them a reinforcement of  some cohorts, and that having deprived them of provisions he would  necessitate the enemy to come to an engagement.

Several slave deserted at this time, and informed us  that ever since the action at Soritia on the 7th of March, the enemy had been  under continual alarms, and appointed Attius Varus to guard the lines. The  same day Pompey decamped, and posted himself in an olive-wood over  against Hispalis. Caesar, before he removed, waited till midnight, when the  moon began to appear. At his departure he ordered them to set fire to the  fort of Ucubis, which Pompey had abandoned, and to assemble in the  greater camp. He afterward laid siege to Ventisponte, which surrendered;  and marching thence to Carruca, encamped over against Pompey, who had  burned the city, because the garrison refused to open the gates to him. A  soldier who had murdered his brother in the camp, being intercepted by our  men, was scourged to death. Caesar, still pursuing his march, arrived in the  plains of Munda, and pitched his camp opposite to that of Pompey.

Upon this intelligence he ordered the  standard to be raised. Pompey had taken this resolution in consequence of  his letter to the inhabitants of Ursao, who were his firm adherents, in which  he told them that Caesar refused to come down into the plain, because his  army consisted mostly of new-levied troops. This had greatly confirmed the  city in its allegiance. Thus relying on this opinion, he thought that he could  effect the whole, for he was defended by the nature of his situation, and by  the position for defense of the town, where he had his camp: for, as we  observed before, this country is full of hills which run in a continued chain,  without any plains intervening.

The two camps were divided from  one another by a plain about five miles in extent, so that Pompey, in  consequence of the town's elevated position, and the nature of the country,  enjoyed a double defense. Across this valley ran a rivulet, which rendered  the approach to the mountain extremely difficult, because it formed a deep  morass on the right. Caesar had no doubt that the enemy would descend into  the plain and come to a battle, when he saw them in array. This appeared  evident to all; the rather because the plain would give their cavalry full room  to act, and the day was so serene and clear that the gods seemed to have sent  it on purpose to favor the engagement. Our men rejoiced at the favorable  opportunity: some however were not altogether exempt from fear when they  considered that their all was at stake, with the uncertainty of what might be  their fate an hour after. He advanced however to the field of battle, fully  persuaded that the enemy would do the same; but they durst not venture  above a mile from the town, being determined to shelter themselves under  its walls. Our men still continued before them in order of battle; but  although the equality of the ground sometimes tempted them to come and  dispute the victory, they nevertheless still kept their post on the mountain, in  the neighborhood of the town. We doubled our speed to reach the rivulet,  without their stirring from the place where they stood.

We had only eighty  heavy-armed cohorts, and eight thousand horse. When we reached the  extremity of the plain, the real seat of disadvantage, the enemy were  awaiting us above, so that it would have been exceedingly dangerous to  proceed. When Caesar perceived this, he pointed out the locality, lest any  disagreeable occurrence should result from the temerity of his troops. The  army murmured greatly, as if they had been kept back from a certain victory,  when this was told them. The delay, however, served to enliven the enemy,  thinking that Caesar's troops shrank from an encounter through fear: they  therefore had the boldness to advance a little way, yet without quitting the  advantage of their post, the approach to which was extremely dangerous.  The tenth legion, as usual, was on the right, the third and fifth on the left,  with the auxiliary troops and cavalry. The battle began with a shout.

 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="spa_31">31</a></font></span>But though our men were superior to the  enemy in courage, the latter nevertheless defended themselves so well by  the advantage of the higher ground, and the shouts were so loud, and the  discharge of darts on both sides so great, that we almost began to despair of  victory. For the first onset and shout, by which an enemy is most apt to be  dismayed, were pretty equal in the present encounter. All fought with equal  valor; the place was covered with arrows and darts, and great numbers of  the enemy fell. We have already observed that the tenth legion was on the  right, which, though not considerable for the number of men, was  nevertheless formidable for its courage; and so pressed the enemy on that  side that they were obliged to draw a legion from the right wing to reinforce  the left, lest we should come upon their flank; but they fought so bravely  that the reinforcement could not find an opportunity of entering the ranks.  Upon this motion, our cavalry on the left fell upon Pompey's right wing.  Meanwhile the clashing of armor mingled with the shouts of combatants,  and the groans of the dying and the wounded, terrified the new-raised  soldiers. On this occasion, as Ennius says, "they fought hand to hand, foot to  foot, and shield to shield;" but though the enemy fought with the utmost  vigor, they were obliged to give ground, and retire toward the town. The  battle was fought on the feast of Bacchus, and the Pompeians were entirely  routed and put to flight; insomuch that not a man could have escaped, had  they not sheltered themselves in the place whence they advanced to the  charge. The enemy lost on this occasion upward of thirty thousand men, and  among the rest Labienus and Attius Varus, whose funeral obsequies were  performed upon the field of battle. They had likewise three thousand Roman  knights killed, partly Italian, partly provincial. About a thousand were slain  on our side, partly foot, partly horse; and five hundred wounded. We gained  thirteen eagles, and several standards, and emblems of authority, and made  seventeen officers prisoners. Such was the issue of this action.

The dead bodies of the enemy, heaped together,  served as a rampart, and their javelins and darts were fixed up by way of  palisades. Upon these we hung their bucklers to supply the place of a  breastwork, and fixing the heads of the deceased upon swords and lances,  planted them all around the works, to strike the greater terror into the  besieged, and keep awake in them a sense of our prowess. Amid these  mournful objects did they find themselves shut in, when our men began the  attack, which was conducted chiefly by the Gauls. Young Valerius, who had  escaped to Corduba with some horse, informed Sextus Pompey of what had  happened; who, upon receipt of the mournful news, distributing what money  he had about him to the troopers, left the town about nine at night, under  pretense of going to find out Caesar, to treat of an accommodation. On the  other side, Cn. Pompey, attended by a few horse and foot, took the road to  Carteia, where his fleet lay, and which was about a hundred and seventy  miles distant from Corduba. When he was arrived within eight miles of the  place, he sent P. Calvitius his camp-marshal before, to procure a litter to  carry him to the town, as he found himself unwell. The litter came, and  when he entered the town, those of his party waited on him privately, to  receive his orders about the management of the war. As they assembled  round the place in great crowds, Pompey quitting his litter put himself under  their protection.

They immediately prepared to  defend the bridge. Caesar passed the river and encamped. Scapula, who had  stirred up the freedmen to a revolt, escaping after the battle to Corduba,  when he found himself besieged, assembled all his followers, ordered a  funeral pile to be erected and a magnificent supper served up; when, putting  on his richest dress, he distributed his plate and money among his  domestics, supped cheerfully, anointed himself several times, and, last of  all, ordered one of his freedmen to dispatch him, and another to set fire to  the pile.

But the  thirteenth legion prepared to defend the town, and with that view possessed  themselves of the walls and some towers, in spite of all opposition, which  obliged the other party to send deputies to Caesar for aid. Upon this those  who had escaped out of the battle set fire to the place, and our men entering  at the same time, slew about twenty-two thousand of them, besides those  who were slain without the walls; thus Caesar obtained the town. While he  was employed in this siege, those who, as we have said, were blockaded at  Munda made a sally, but were driven back into the town with considerable  loss.

Meantime, the Lusitanians in Hispalis plundered the town, which, though  known to Caesar, did not yet determine him to press it too hard, lest they  should in despair set fire to it, and destroy the walls. It was resolved in  council to suffer the Lusitanians to escape in the night by a sally, yet so that  the thing might not appear designed. In this sally, they set fire to the ships  that were in the river Guadalquivir, and while our men were employed in  extinguishing the flames, endeavored to get off; but being overtaken by the  cavalry, were mostly cut to pieces. Thence Caesar marched to Asta, which  submitted. Munda having been now a long while besieged, many of those  who had escaped out of the battle, despairing of safety, surrendered to us;  and being formed into a legion, conspired among themselves, that upon a  signal being given, the garrison should sally out in the night, while they at  the same time should begin a massacre in the camp.

Pompey himself was wounded in the  fray, but escaping to his ships, fled with about twenty galleys. Didius, who  was at Gades with Caesar's fleet, hearing of what had happened,  immediately sailed in pursuit of them; stationing at the same time some  cavalry and infantry along the coast, to prevent his escaping by land.

Slaughter was dealt on all hands by our troops, his fortress having been  stormed, and his resources cut off. In this extremity he fled to a cave, where  he could not easily be discovered, unless by the information of the captives.  Here he was slain, his head was brought to Hispalis on the day before the  ides of April, and exhibited before the people when Caesar was at Gades.

 Pompeius, ut supra demonstravimus, saucius et intorto talo idcirco tardabatur ad fugiendum, itemque propter loci difficultatem neque equo neque vehiculo saluti suae praesidium parare poterat. Caedes a nostris undique administrabatur. Exclusus a munitione amissisque auxiliis ad convallem exesumque locum in speluncam Pompeius se occultare coepit, ut a nostris non facile inveniretur nisi captivorum indicio. Ita ibi interficitur. Cum Caesar Gadibus fuisset, Hispalim pridie Idus Apriles caput adlatum et populo datum est in conspectum.

The Lusitanians, who had escaped from the  battle, rallying in great bodies, advanced to Didius. Though the preservation  of the fleet principally engaged his attention, he was obliged to leave his fort  in order to restrain the frequent sallies of the enemy. These daily skirmishes  gave them an opportunity of projecting an ambuscade; for which purpose  they divided their troops into three bodies. Some were prepared to set fire to  the fleet, and in the mean time others were to come to their relief. These  were so arranged that they could advance to the battle without any one  seeing them. Didius sallied out according to custom; when upon a signal  being given, one of the parties advanced to set fire to the fleet; and another,  counterfeiting a retreat, drew him insensibly into the ambuscade, where he  was surrounded and slain with most of his followers, fighting valiantly.  Some escaped in boats which they found upon the coast; others endeavored  to reach the galleys by swimming; and, weighing anchor, stood out to sea. A  great many saved themselves in this manner, but the Lusitanians got all the  baggage. Caesar meanwhile returned from Gades to Hispalis.

Erant parati qui naves incenderent, incensisque qui subsidium repellerent; hi sic dispositi erant ut a nullo [conspici possent. reliqui in] conspectu omnium ad pugnam contendunt. Ita cum ex castello Didius ad propellendum processisset cum copiis, signum a Lusitanis tollitur, naves incenduntur, simulque qui in castello ad pugnam processerant, eodem signo fugientes latrones dum persequuntur, a tergo insidiae clamore sublato circumveniunt. Didius magna cum virtute cum compluribus interficitur. Nonnullique ea pugna scaphas quae ad litus fuerant occupant, item complures nando ad naves quae in salo fuerunt, se recipiunt, ancoris sublatis pelagus remis petere coeperunt.

Our men seized this opportunity to get possession of the town, and  took the rest prisoners, in number about fourteen thousand. Thence they  retreated toward Ursao, a town exceedingly strong both by nature and art,  and capable of resisting an enemy. Besides, there is not, within eight miles  of the place any spring but that which supplies the town, which was a  decided advantage to the besieged. In addition to all this, the wood  necessary for building towers and other machines had to be fetched from a  distance of six miles. And Pompey, to render the siege more difficult, had  cut down all the timber round the place, and collected it within the walls,  which obliged our men to bring all the materials for carrying on the siege  from Munda, the nearest town which they had subdued.

In fine, that when he was consul, he had, though absent, rendered the  province all the services in his power; that instead of making a suitable  return for so many favors, they had always discovered the utmost ingratitude  both toward him and the people of Rome; as well in this last war as the  preceding. "You," says he, "though no strangers to the law of nations and  the rights of Roman citizens, have yet like barbarians often violated the  sacred persons of Roman magistrates. You attempted in open day, in the  public square, to assassinate Cassius. You have been always such enemies  to peace that the senate could never suffer the province to be without  legions. You take favors for offenses, and insults for benefits, are insolent  and restless in peace, and cowardly and effeminate in war. Young Pompey,  though only a private citizen, nay a fugitive, was yet received among you,  and suffered to assume the ensigns of magistracy. After putting many  citizens to death, you still furnished him with forces, and even urged him to  lay waste the country and province. Against whom do you hope to be  victorious? Can you be ignorant that even if I should be destroyed, the  people of Rome have still ten legions, capable not only of opposing you, but  even of pulling down heaven? With whose praises and virtues ... (NOTE: The end of the book is lost.)

 Dum haec ad Mundam geruntur et Ursaonem, Caesar ad Hispalim cum Gadibus se recepisset, insequenti die contione advocata: Initio quaesturae suae eam provinciam ex omnibus provinciis peculiarem sibi constituisse et quae potuisset eo tempore beneficia largitum esse. Insequente praetura ampliato honore vectigalia quae Metellus inposuisset, a senatu petisse et eius pecuniae provinciam liberasse simulque patrocinio suscepto multis legationibus ab se in senatum inductis simul publicis privatisque causis multorum inimicitiis susceptis defendisse. Suo item consulatu absentem quae potuisset commoda provinciae tribuisse. Eorum omnium commodorum et immemores et ingratos in se et in populum Romanum hoc bello et praeterito tempore cognosse. 'Vos iure gentium et civiumque Romanorum institutis cognitis more barbarorum populi Romani magistratibus sacrosanctis manus [semel] et saepius attulistis et luce clara Cassium in medio foro nefarie interficere voluistis. Vos ita pacem semper odistis ut nullo tempore legiones desitae populi Romani in hac provincia haberi. Apud vos beneficia pro maleficiis et maleficia pro beneficiis habentur. Ita neque in otio concordiam neque in bello virtutem ullo tempore retinere potuistis. Privatus ex fuga Cn. Pompeius adulescens a vobis receptus fasces imperium[que] sibi arripuit, multis interfectis civibus auxilia contra populum Romanum conparavit, agros provinciamque vestro impulsu depopulavit. In quo vos victores extabatis? An me deleto non animum advertebatis decem habere legiones populum Romanum quae non solum vobis obsistere, sed etiam caelum diruere possent?
