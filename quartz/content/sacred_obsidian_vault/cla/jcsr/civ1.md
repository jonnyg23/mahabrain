 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="civ_1_0">1:0</a></font></span>Vossius's supplement to the first book: I will  now say nothing concerning the absurd opinion of those who assert that the  following Commentaries on the Civil War were not written by Caesar  himself. Even without the authority of Suetonius, the diction itself would be  sufficient to convince the most skeptical that Caesar and no other was the  author. I am of the opinion of those who think that the beginning of these  Commentaries is lost. For I can not be convinced that Caesar commenced so  abruptly; and History itself gives sufficient evidence that many  circumstances require to be previously stated. For which reason we thought  that it would be well worth our attention to compile from Plutarch, Appian,  and Dion, a narrative of such facts as seemed necessary to fill up the chasm;  these facts are as follows: "When Caesar, after reducing all Transalpine  Gaul, had passed into Cisalpine Gaul, he determined for many reasons to  send embassadors to Rome to request for him the consulate, and a  prolongation of the command of his province. Pompey, who was estranged  from Caesar, although he was not as yet at open enmity with him,  determined neither to aid him by his influence nor openly oppose him on  this occasion. But the consuls Lentulus and Marcellus, who had previously  been on unfriendly terms with Caesar, resolved to use all means in their  power to prevent him from gaining his object. Marcellus in particular did  not hesitate to offer Caesar other insults. Caesar had lately planned the  colony of Novumcomum in Gaul: Marcellus, not content with taking from it  the right of citizenship, ordered the principal man of the colony to be  arrested and scourged at Rome, and sent him to make his complaints to  Caesar: an insult of this description had never before been offered to a  Roman citizen. While these transactions are taking place, Caius Curio,  tribune of the commons, comes to Caesar in his province. Curio had made  many and energetic struggles, in behalf of the republic and Caesar's cause:  at length when he perceived that all his efforts were vain, he fled through  fear of his adversaries, and informed Caesar of all the transactions that had  taken place, and of the efforts made by his enemies to crush him. Caesar  received Curio with great kindness, as he was a man of the highest rank, and  had great claims on himself and the republic, and thanked him warmly for  his numerous personal favors. But Curio, as war was being openly prepared  against Caesar, advised him to concentrate his troops, and rescue the  republic now oppressed by a few daring men. Caesar, although he was not  ignorant of the real state of affairs, was however of opinion that particular  regard should be paid to the tranquillity of the republic, lest any one should  suppose that he was the originator of the war. Therefore, through his  friends, he made this one request, that two legions, and the province of  Cisalpine Gaul, and Illyricum, should be left him. All these acts were  performed by Caesar, with the hope that his enemies might be induced by  the justice of his demands, to preserve the peace of the republic. Even  Pompey himself did not dare to oppose them. But when Caesar could not  obtain his request from the consuls, he wrote to the senate a letter, in which  he briefly stated his exploits and public services, and entreated that he  should not be deprived of the favor of the people, who had ordered, that he,  although absent, should be considered a candidate at the next elections; and  he stated also that he would disband his army, if the senate and people of  Rome would pass a resolution to that effect, provided that Pompey would  do the same. That, as long as the latter should retain the command of his  army, no just reason could exist that he [Caesar] should disband his troops  and expose himself to the insults of his enemies. He intrusts this letter to  Curio to bear to its destination; the latter traveled one hundred and sixty  miles with incredible dispatch, and reached the city in three days' time,  before the beginning of January, and before the consuls could pass any  decree concerning Caesar's command. Curio, after accomplishing his  journey, kept the letter, and did not give it up, until there was a crowded  meeting of the senate, and the tribunes of the commons were present; for he  was afraid, lest, if he gave it up previously, the consuls should suppress it.

 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="civ_1_1">1:1</a></font></span>When Caesar's letter was delivered to the  consuls, they were with great difficulty, and a hard struggle of the tribunes,  prevailed on to suffer it to be read in the senate; but the tribunes could not  prevail, that any question should be put to the senate on the subject of the  letter. The consuls put the question on the regulation of the state. Lucius  Lentulus the consul promises that he will not fail the senate and republic, "if  they declared their sentiments boldly and resolutely, but if they turned their  regard to Caesar, and courted his favor, as they did on former occasions, he  would adopt a plan for himself, and not submit to the authority of the  senate: that he too had a means of regaining Caesar's favor and friendship."  Scipio spoke to the same purport, "that it was Pompey's intention not to  abandon the republic, if the senate would support him; but if they should  hesitate and act without energy, they would in vain implore his aid, if they  should require it hereafter."

 Litteris C. Caesaris consulibus redditis aegre ab his impetratum est summa tribunorum plebis contentione, ut in senatu recitarentur; ut vero ex litteris ad senatum referretur, impetrari non potuit. Referunt consules de re publica [in civitate]. [Incitat] L. Lentulus consul senatu rei publicae se non defuturum pollicetur, si audacter ac fortiter sententias dicere velint; sin Caesarem respiciant atque eius gratiam sequantur, ut superioribus fecerint temporibus, se sibi consilium capturum neque senatus auctoritati obtemperaturum: habere se quoque ad Caesaris gratiam atque amicitiam receptum. In eandem sententiam loquitur Scipio: Pompeio esse in animo rei publicae non deesse, si senatus sequatur; si cunctetur atque agat lenius, nequiquam eius auxilium, si postea velit, senatum imploraturum.

 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="civ_1_2">1:2</a></font></span>This speech of Scipio's, as the senate was  convened in the city, and Pompey was near at hand, seemed to have fallen  from the lips of Pompey himself. Some delivered their sentiments with  more moderation, as Marcellus first, who in the beginning of his speech,  said, "that the question ought not to be put to the senate on this matter, till  levies were made throughout all Italy, and armies raised under whose  protection the senate might freely and safely pass such resolutions as they  thought proper;" as Marcus Calidius afterward, who was of opinion, "that  Pompey should set out for his province, that there might be no cause for  arms; that Caesar was naturally apprehensive as two legions were forced  from him, that Pompey was retaining those troops, and keeping them near  the city to do him injury:" as Marcus Rufus, who followed Calidius almost  word for word. They were all harshly rebuked by Lentulus, who  peremptorily refused to propose Calidius's motion. Marcellus, overawed by  his reproofs, retracted his opinion. Thus most of the senate, intimidated by  the expressions of the consul, by the fears of a present army, and the threats  of Pompey's friends, unwillingly and reluctantly adopted Scipio's opinion,  that Caesar should disband his army by a certain day, and should he not do  so, he should he considered as acting against the state. Marcus Antonius,  and Quintus Cassius, tribunes of the people, interposed. The question was  immediately put on their interposition. Violent opinions were expressed;  whoever spoke with the greatest acrimony and cruelty was most highly  commended by Caesar's enemies.

 Haec Scipionis oratio, quod senatus in urbe habebatur Pompeiusque aberat, ex ipsius ore Pompei mitti videbatur. Dixerat aliquis leniorem sententiam, ut primo M. Marcellus, ingressus in eam orationem, non oportere ante de ea re ad senatum referri, quam dilectus tota Italia habiti et exercitus conscripti essent, quo praesidio tuto et libere senatus, quae vellet, decernere auderet; ut M. Calidius, qui censebat, ut Pompeius in suas provincias proficieceretur, ne qua esset armorum causa: timere Caesarem ereptis ab eo duabus legionibus, ne ad eius periculum reservare et retinere eas ad urbem Pompeius videretur; ut M. Rufus, qui sententiam Calidii paucis fere mutatis rebus sequebatur. Hi omnes convicio L. Lentuli consulis correpti exagitabantur. Lentulus sententiam Calidii pronuntiaturum se omnina negavit. Marcellus perterritus conviciis a sua sententia discessit. Sic vocibus consulis, terrore praesentis exercitus, minis amicorum Pompei plerique compulsi inviti et coacti Scipionis sententiam sequuntur: uti ante certam diem Caesar exercitum dimittat; si non faciat, eum adversus rem publicam facturum videri. Intercedit M. Antonius, Q. Cassius, tribuni plebis. Refertur confestim de intersessione tribunorum.

He applauded the  forward, and secured their votes for the next day; the more moderate he  reproved and excited against Caesar. Many veterans, from all parts, who had  served in Pompey's armies, were invited to his standard by the hopes of  rewards and promotions. Several officers belonging to the two legions,  which had been delivered up by Caesar, were sent for. The city and the  comitium were crowded with tribunes, centurions, and veterans. All the  consul's friends, all Pompey's connections, all those who bore any ancient  enmity to Caesar, were forced into the senate house. By their concourse and  declarations the timid were awed, the irresolute confirmed, and the greater  part deprived of the power of speaking their sentiments with freedom.  Lucius Piso, the censor, offered to go to Caesar: as did likewise Lucius  Roscius, the praetor, to inform him of these affairs, and require only six  days' time to finish the business. Opinions were expressed by some to the  effect that commissioners should be sent to Caesar to acquaint him with the  senate's pleasure.

 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="civ_1_4">1:4</a></font></span>All these proposals were rejected, and  opposition made to them all, in the speeches of the consul, Scipio, and Cato.  An old grudge against Caesar and chagrin at a defeat actuated Cato.  Lentulus was wrought upon by the magnitude of his debts, and the hopes of  having the government of an army and provinces, and by the presents which  he expected from such princes as should receive the title of friends of the  Roman people, and boasted among his friends, that he would be a second  Sylla, to whom the supreme authority should return. Similar hopes of a  province and armies, which he expected to share with Pompey on account  of his connection with him, urged on Scipio; and moreover [he was  influenced by] the fear of being called to trial, and the adulation and an  ostentatious display of himself and his friends in power, who at that time  had great influence in the republic, and courts of judicature. Pompey  himself, incited by Caesar's enemies, because he was unwilling that any  person should bear an equal degree of dignity, had wholly alienated himself  from Caesar's friendship, and procured a reconciliation with their common  enemies; the greatest part of whom he had himself brought upon Caesar  during his affinity with him. At the same time, chagrined at the disgrace  which he had incurred by converting the two legions from their expedition  through Asia and Syria, to [augment] his own power and authority, he was  anxious to bring matters to a war.

 Omnibus his resistitur, omnibusque oratio consulis, Scipionis, Catonis opponitur. Catonem veteres inimicitiae Caesaris incitant et dolor repulsae. Lentulus aeris alieni magnitudine et spe exercitus ac provinciarum et regum appellandorum largitionibus movetur, seque alterum fore Sullam inter suos gloriatur, ad quem summa imperii redeat. Scipionem eadem spes provinciae atque exercituum impellit, quos se pro necessitudine partiturum cum Pompeio arbitratur, simul iudiciorum metus, adulatio atque ostentatia sui et potentium, qui in re publica iudiciisque tum plurimum pollebant. Ipse Pompeius, ab inimicis Caesaris incitatus, et quod neminem dignitate secum exaequari volebat, totum se ab eius amicitia averterat et cum communibus inimicis in gratiam redierat, quorum ipse maximam partem illo affinitatis tempore iniunxerat Caesari; simul infamia duarum legionum permotus, quas ab itinere Asiae Syriaeque ad suam potentiam dominatumque converterat, rem ad arma deduci studebat.

 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="civ_1_5">1:5</a></font></span>For these reasons every thing was done in a  hasty and disorderly manner, and neither was time given to Caesar's  relations to inform him [of the state of affairs] nor liberty to the tribunes of  the people to deprecate their own danger, nor even to retain the last  privilege, which Sylla had left them, the interposing their authority; but on  the seventh day they were obliged to think of their own safety, which the  most turbulent tribunes of the people were not accustomed to attend to, nor  to fear being called to an account for their actions, till the eighth month.  Recourse is had to that extreme and final decree of the senate (which was  never resorted to even by daring proposers except when the city was in  danger of being set on fire, or when the public safety was despaired of).  "That the consuls, praetors, tribunes of the people, and proconsuls in the  city, should take care that the state received no injury." These decrees are  dated the eighth day before the ides of January; therefore, in the first five  days, on which the senate could meet, from the day on which Lentulus  entered into his consulate, the two days of election excepted, the severest  and most virulent decrees were passed against Caesar's government, and  against those most illustrious characters, the tribunes of the people. The  latter immediately made their escape from the city, and withdrew to Caesar,  who was then at Ravenna, awaiting an answer to his moderate demands; [to  see] if matters could be brought to a peaceful termination by any equitable  act on the part of his enemies.

Pompey repeated the same things which he had  declared through Scipio. He applauded the courage and firmness of the  senate, acquainted them with his force, and told them that he had ten legions  ready; that he was moreover informed and assured that Caesar's soldiers  were disaffected, and that he could not persuade them to defend or even  follow him. Motions were made in the senate concerning other matters; that  levies should be made through all Italy; that Faustus Sylla should be sent as  propraetor into Mauritania; that money should be granted to Pompey from  the public treasury. It was also put to the vote that king Juba should be  [honored with the title of] friend and ally. But Marcellus said that he would  not allow this motion for the present. Philip, one of the tribunes, stopped  [the appointment of] Sylla; the resolutions respecting the other matters  passed. The provinces, two of which were consular, the remainder  praetorian, were decreed to private persons; Scipio got Syria, Lucius  Domitius Gaul: Philip and Marcellus were omitted, from a private motive,  and their lots were not even admitted. To the other provinces praetors were  sent, nor was time granted as in former years, to refer to the people on their  appointment, nor to make them take the usual oath, and march out of the  city in a public manner, robed in the military habit, after offering their vows:  a circumstance which had never before happened. Both the consuls leave  the city, and private men had lictors in the city and capital, contrary to all  precedents of former times. Levies were made throughout Italy, arms  demanded, and money exacted from the municipal towns, and violently  taken from the temples. All distinctions between things human and divine,  are confounded.

He complained that an innovation had been introduced into the  republic, that the intercession of the tribunes, which had been restored a few  years before by Sylla, was branded as a crime, and suppressed by force of  arms; that Sylla, who had stripped the tribunes of every other power, had,  nevertheless, left the privilege of intercession unrestrained; that Pompey,  who pretended to restore what they had lost, had taken away the privileges  which they formerly had; that whenever the senate decreed, 'that the  magistrates should take care that the republic sustained no injury' (by which  words and decree the Roman people were obliged to repair to arms), it was  only when pernicious laws were proposed; when the tribunes attempted  violent measures; when the people seceded, and possessed themselves of the  temples and eminences of the city; (and these instances of former times, he  showed them were expiated by the fate of Saturninus and the Gracchi): that  nothing of this kind was attempted now, nor even thought of: that no law  was promulgated, no intrigue with the people going forward, no secession  made; he exhorted them to defend from the malice of his enemies the  reputation and honor of that general under whose command they had for  nine years most successfully supported the state; fought many successful  battles, and subdued all Gaul and Germany." The soldiers of the thirteenth  legion, which was present (for in the beginning of the disturbances he had  called it out, his other legions not having yet arrived), all cry out that they  are ready to defend their general, and the tribunes of the commons, from all  injuries.

Thither  came Lucius Caesar, a young man, whose father was a lieutenant-general  under Caesar. He, after concluding the rest of his speech, and stating for  what purpose he had come, told Caesar that he had commands of a private  nature for him from Pompey; that Pompey wished to clear himself to  Caesar, lest he should impute those actions which he did for the republic, to  a design of affronting him; that he had ever preferred the interest of the state  to his own private connections; that Caesar, too, for his own honor, ought to  sacrifice his desires and resentment to the public good, and not vent his  anger so violently against his enemies, lest in his hopes of injuring them, he  should injure the republic. He spoke a few words to the same purport from  himself, in addition to Pompey's apology. Roscius, the praetor, conferred  with Caesar almost in the same words, and on the same subject, and  declared that Pompey had empowered him to do so.

"That the  honor of the republic had ever been his first object, and dearer to him than  life; that he was chagrined, that the favor of the Roman people was wrested  from him by the injurious reports of his enemies; that he was deprived of a  half-year's command, and dragged back to the city, though the people had  ordered that regard should be paid to his suit for the consulate at the next  election, though he was not present; that, however, he had patiently  submitted to this loss of honor, for the sake of the republic; that when he  wrote letters to the senate, requiring that all persons should resign the  command of their armies, he did not obtain even that request; that levies  were made throughout Italy; that the two legions which had been taken from  him, under the pretense of the Parthian war, were kept at home, and that the  state was in arms. To what did all these things tend, unless to his ruin? But,  nevertheless, he was ready to condescend to any terms, and to endure every  thing for the sake of the republic. Let Pompey go to his own province; let  them both disband their armies; let all persons in Italy lay down their arms;  let all fears be removed from the city; let free elections, and the whole  republic be resigned to the direction of the senate and Roman people. That  these things might be the more easily performed, and conditions secured and  confirmed by oath, either let Pompey come to Caesar, or allow Caesar to go  to him; it might be that all their disputes would be settled by an interview."

Having deliberated on the matter, they  replied, and sent written proposals to him by the same persons, the purport  of which was, that Caesar should return into Gaul, leave Ariminum, and  disband his army: if he complied with this, that Pompey would go to Spain.  In the mean time, until security was given that Caesar would perform his  promises, that the consuls and Pompey would not give over their levies.

But his  not granting time for a conference, nor promising to set out to meet him,  made the expectation of peace appear very hopeless. Caesar, therefore, sent  Marcus Antonius, with five cohorts from Ariminum to Arretium; he himself  staid at Ariminum with two legions, with the intention of raising levies  there. He secured Pisaurus, Fanum, and Ancona, with a cohort each.

Upon notice of his approach,  Thermus, distrusting the affections of the townsmen, drew his cohorts out of  it and made his escape; his soldiers deserted him on the road, and returned  home. Curio recovered Iguvium, with the cheerful concurrence of all the  inhabitants. Caesar, having received an account of this, and relying on the  affections of the municipal towns, drafted all the cohorts of the thirteenth  legion from the garrison, and set out for Auximum, a town into which  Attius had brought his cohorts, and of which he had taken possession, and  from which he had sent senators round about the country of Picenum, to  raise new levies.

Alarmed at this declaration, Attius Varus  drew out of the town the garrison which he had introduced, and fled. A fear  of Caesar's front rank having pursued him, obliged him to halt, and when  the battle began, Varus is deserted by his troops: some of them disperse to  their homes, the rest come over to Caesar; and along with them, Lucius  Pupius, the chief centurion, is taken prisoner and brought to Caesar. He had  held the same rank before in Cneius Pompey's army.

For it was  falsely rumored that Caesar was approaching, and that his cavalry were  already at the gates. Marcellus, his colleague, followed him, and so did most  of the magistrates. Cneius Pompey had left the city the day before, and was  on his march to those legions which he had received from Caesar, and had  disposed in winter quarters in Apulia. The levies were stopped within the  city. No place on this side of Capua was thought secure. At Capua they first  began to take courage and to rally, and determined to raise levies in the  colonies, which had been sent thither by the Julian law: and Lentulus  brought into the public market place the gladiators which Caesar maintained  there for the entertainment of the people, and confirmed them in their  liberty, and gave them horses and ordered them to attend him; but afterward,  being warned by his friends that this action was censured by the judgment of  all, he distributed them among the slaves of the district of Campania, to  keep guard there.

All the governors in  these countries most cheerfully received him, and aided his army with every  necessary. Embassadors came to him even from Cingulum, a town which  Labienus had laid out and built at his own expense, and offered most  earnestly to comply with his orders. He demanded soldiers: they sent them.  In the mean time, the twelfth legion came to join Caesar; with these two he  marched to Asculum, the chief town of Picenum. Lentulus Spinther  occupied that town with ten cohorts; but, on being informed of Caesar's  approach, he fled from the town, and, in attempting to bring off his cohorts  with him, was deserted by a great part of his men. Being left on the road  with a small number, he fell in with Vibullius Rufus, who was sent by  Pompey into Picenum to confirm the people [in their allegiance]. Vibullius,  being informed by him of the transactions in Picenum, takes his soldiers  from him and dismisses him. He collects, likewise, from the neighboring  countries, as many cohorts as he can from Pompey's new levies. Among  them he meets with Ulcilles Hirrus fleeing from Camerinum, with six  cohorts, which he had in the garrison there; by a junction with which he  made up thirteen cohorts. With them he marched by hasty journeys to  Corfinium, to Domitius Aenobarbus, and informed him that Caesar was  advancing with two legions. Domitius had collected about twenty cohorts  from Alba, and the Marsians, Pelignians, and neighboring states.

He sent Marcus Antonius thither, with five  cohorts of the eighth legion. The inhabitants, as soon as they saw our  standards, threw open their gates, and all the people, both citizens and  soldiers, went out to meet and welcome Antonius. Lucretius and Attius  leaped off the walls. Attius, being brought before Antonius, begged that he  might be sent to Caesar. Antonius returned the same day on which he had  set out with the cohorts and Attius. Caesar added these cohorts to his own  army, and sent Attius away in safety. The three first days Caesar employed  in fortifying his camp with strong works, in bringing in corn from the  neighboring free towns, and waiting for the rest of his forces. Within the  three days the eighth legion came to him, and twenty-two cohorts of the new  levies in Gaul, and about three hundred horse from the king of Noricum. On  their arrival he made a second camp on another part of the town, and gave  the command of it to Curio. He determined to surround the town with a  rampart and turrets during the remainder of the time. Nearly at the time  when the greatest part of the work was completed, all the messengers sent to  Pompey returned.

He held private  conferences with a few of his most intimate friends, and determined on the  design of fleeing. As Domitius's countenance did not agree with his words,  and he did every thing with more confusion and fear than he had shown on  the preceding days, and as he had several private meetings with his friends,  contrary to his usual practice, in order to take their advice, and as he  avoided all public councils and assemblies of the people, the truth could be  no longer hid nor dissembled; for Pompey had written back in answer, "That  he would not put matters to the last hazard; that Domitius had retreated into  the town of Corfinium without either his advice or consent. Therefore, if  any opportunity should offer, he [Domitius] should come to him with the  whole force." But the blockade and works round the town prevented his  escape.

He orders all the forces raised every where by the new levies  to repair to him. He gives arms to the slaves that attended the flocks, and  appoints horses for them. Of these he made up about three hundred horse.  Lucius, the praetor, fled from Alba, with six cohorts: Rutilus, Lupus, the  praetor, from Tarracina, with three. These having descried Caesar's cavalry  at a distance, which were commanded by Bivius Curius, and having  deserted the praetor, carried their colors to Curius and went over to him. In  like manner, during the rest of his march, several cohorts fell in with the  main body of Caesar's army, others with his horse. Cneius Magius, from  Cremona, engineer-general to Pompey, was taken prisoner on the road and  brought to Caesar, but sent back by him to Pompey with this message: "As  hitherto he had not been allowed an interview, and was now on his march to  him at Brundusium, that it deeply concerned the commonwealth and general  safety that he should have an interview with Pompey; and that the same  advantage could not be gained at a great distance when the proposals were  conveyed to them by others, as if terms were argued by them both in  person."

He discovered  that the consuls were gone to Dyrrachium with a considerable part of the  army, and that Pompey remained at Brundusium with twenty cohorts; but  could not find out, for a certainty, whether Pompey staid behind to keep  possession of Brundusium, that he might the more easily command the  whole Adriatic sea, with the extremities of Italy and the coast of Greece, and  be able to conduct the war on either side of it, or whether he remained there  for want of shipping; and, being afraid that Pompey would come to the  conclusion that he ought not to relinquish Italy, he determined to deprive  him of the means of communication afforded by the harbor of Brundusium.  The plan of his work was as follows: Where the mouth of the port was  narrowest he threw up a mole of earth on either side, because in these places  the sea was shallow. Having gone out so far that the mole could not be  continued in the deep water, he fixed double floats, thirty feet on either side,  before the mole. These he fastened with four anchors at the four corners,  that they might not be carried away by the waves. Having completed and  secured them, he then joined to them other floats of equal size. These he  covered over with earth and mold, that he might not be prevented from  access to them to defend them, and in the front and on both sides he  protected them with a parapet of wicker work; and on every fourth one  raised a turret, two stories high, to secure them the better from being  attacked by the shipping and set on fire.

 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="civ_1_26">1:26</a></font></span>To counteract this, Pompey fitted out large  merchant ships, which he found in the harbor of Brundusium: on them he  erected turrets three stories high, and, having furnished them with several  engines and all sorts of weapons, drove them among Caesar's works, to  break through the floats and interrupt the works; thus there happened  skirmishes every day at a distance with slings, arrows, and other weapons.  Caesar conducted matters as if he thought that the hopes of peace were not  yet to be given up. And though he was very much surprised that Magius,  whom he had sent to Pompey with a message, was not sent back to him; and  though his attempting a reconciliation often retarded the vigorous  prosecution of his plans, yet he thought that he ought by all means to  persevere in the same line of conduct. He therefore sent Caninius Rebilus to  have an interview with Scribonius Libo, his intimate friend and relation. He  charges him to exhort Libo to effect a peace, but, above all things, requires  that he should be admitted to an interview with Pompey. He declared that he  had great hopes, if that were allowed him, that the consequence would be  that both parties would lay down their arms on equal terms; that a great  share of the glory and reputation of that event would redound to Libo, if,  through his advice and agency, hostilities should be ended. Libo, having  parted from the conference with Caninius, went to Pompey, and, shortly  after, returns with answer that, as the consuls were absent, no treaty of  composition could be engaged in without them. Caesar therefore thought it  time at length to give over the attempt which he had often made in vain, and  act with energy in the war.

Pompey, either frightened at Caesar's  works or determined from the beginning to quit Italy, began to prepare for  his departure on the arrival of the ships; and the more effectually to retard  Caesar's attack, lest his soldiers should force their way into the town at the  moment of his departure, he stopped up the gates, built walls across the  streets and avenues, sunk trenches across the ways, and in them fixed  palisadoes and sharp stakes, which he made level with the ground by means  of hurdles and clay. But he barricaded with large beams fastened in the  ground and sharpened at the ends two passages and roads without the walls,  which led to the port. After making these arrangements, he ordered his  soldiers to go on board without noise, and disposed here and there, on the  wall and turrets, some light-armed veterans, archers and slingers. These he  designed to call off by a certain signal, when all the soldiers were embarked,  and left row-galleys for them in a secure place.

Therefore, as soon as they were  aware of Pompey's departure, while his men were running up and down, and  busied about their voyage, they made signs from the tops of the houses:  Caesar, being apprised of the design by them, ordered scaling-ladders to be  got ready, and his men to take arms, that he might not lose any opportunity  of coming to an action. Pompey weighed anchor at nightfall. The soldiers  who had been posted on the wall to guard it, were called off by the signal  which had been agreed on, and knowing the roads, ran down to the ships.  Caesar's soldiers fixed their ladders and scaled the walls: but being  cautioned by the people to beware of the hidden stakes and covered  trenches, they halted, and being conducted by the inhabitants by a long  circuit, they reached the port, and captured with their long boats and small  craft two of Pompey's ships, full of soldiers, which had struck against  Caesar's moles.

The only resource  left to Caesar, was to wait for a fleet from the distant regions of Gaul,  Picenum, and the straits of Gibraltar. But this, on account of the season of  the year, appeared tedious and troublesome. He was unwilling that, in the  mean time, the veteran army, and the two Spains, one of which was bound  to Pompey by the strongest obligations, should be confirmed in his interest;  that auxiliaries and cavalry should be provided, and Gaul and Italy reduced  in his absence.

He detached Valerius, his lieutenant,  with one legion to Sardinia; Curio, the propraetor, to Sicily with three  legions; and ordered him, when he had recovered Sicily, to immediately  transport his army to Africa. Marcus Cotta was at this time governor of  Sardinia: Marcus Cato, of Sicily: and Tubero, by the lots, should have had  the government of Africa. The Caralitani, as soon as they heard that  Valerius was sent against them, even before he left Italy, of their own  accord drove Cotta out of the town; who, terrified because he understood  that the whole province was combined [against him], fled from Sardinia to  Africa. Cato was in Sicily, repairing the old ships of war, and demanding  new ones from the states, and these things he performed with great zeal. He  was raising levies of Roman citizens, among the Lucani and Brutii, by his  lieutenants, and exacting a certain quota of horse and foot from the states of  Sicily. When these things were nearly completed, being informed of Curio's  approach, he made a complaint that he was abandoned and betrayed by  Pompey, who had undertaken an unnecessary war, without making any  preparation, and when questioned by him and other members in the senate,  had assured them that every thing was ready and provided for the war. After  having made these complaints in a public assembly, he fled from his  province.

That a  bill had been carried by the ten tribunes of the people (notwithstanding the  resistance of his enemies, and a very violent opposition from Cato, who in  his usual manner, consumed the day by a tedious harangue) that he should  be allowed to stand candidate, though absent, even in the consulship of  Pompey; and if the latter disapproved of the bill, why did he allow it to  pass? if he approved of it, why should he debar him [Caesar] from the  people's favor? He made mention of his own patience, in that he had freely  proposed that all armies should be disbanded, by which he himself would  suffer the loss both of dignity and honor. He urged the virulence of his  enemies, who refused to comply with what they required from others, and  had rather that all things should be thrown into confusion, than that they  should lose their power and their armies. He expatiated on their injustice, in  taking away his legions: their cruelty and insolence in abridging the  privileges of the tribunes; the proposals he had made, and his entreaties of  an interview which had been refused him. For which reasons, he begged and  desired that they would undertake the management of the republic, and unite  with him in the administration of it. But if through fear they declined it, he  would not be a burden to them, but take the management of it on himself.  That deputies ought to be sent to Pompey, to propose a reconciliation; as he  did not regard what Pompey had lately asserted in the senate, that authority  was acknowledged to be vested in those persons to whom embassadors were  sent, and fear implied in those that sent them. That these were the  sentiments of low, weak minds: that for his part, as he had made it his study  to surpass others in glory, so he was desirous of excelling them in justice  and equity."

The chief management of the war was intrusted to  him. At his command they send the fleet to all parts; they seize all the  merchantmen they could meet with, and carry them into the harbor; they  apply the nails, timber, and rigging, with which they were furnished to rig  and refit their other vessels. They lay up in the public stores, all the corn that  was found in the ships, and reserve the rest of their lading and convoy for  the siege of the town, should such an event take place. Provoked at such ill  treatment, Caesar led three legions against Massilia, and resolved to provide  turrets, and vineae to assault the town, and to build twelve ships at Arelas,  which being completed and rigged in thirty days (from the time the timber  was cut down), and being brought to Massilia, he put under the command of  Decimus Brutus; and left Caius Trebonius his lieutenant, to invest the city.

He desired the other legions, which  were passing the winter at a great distance, to follow close after him.

Petreius was to  march from Lusitania through the Vettones, and join Afranius with all his  forces; Varro was to guard all Further Spain with what legions he had.  These matters being settled, reinforcements of horse and foot were  demanded from Lusitania, by Petreius; from the Celtiberi, Cantabri, and all  the barbarous nations which border on the ocean, by Afranius. When they  were raised, Petreius immediately marched through the Vettones to  Afranius. They resolved by joint consent to carry on the war in the vicinity  of Herba, on account of the advantages of its situation.

There were besides about eighty cohorts raised in  Hither and Further Spain (of which, the troops belonging to the former  province had shields, those of the latter targets), and about five thousand  horse raised in both provinces. Caesar had sent his legions into Spain, with  about six thousand auxiliary foot, and three thousand horse, which had  served under him in all his former wars, and the same number from Gaul,  which he himself had provided, having expressly called out all the most  noble and valiant men of each state. The bravest of these were from the  Aquitani and the mountaineers, who border on the Province in Gaul. He had  been informed that Pompey was marching through Mauritania with his  legions to Spain, and would shortly arrive. He at the same time borrowed  money from the tribunes and centurions, which he distributed among his  soldiers. By this proceeding he gained two points; he secured the interest of  the centurions by this pledge in his hands, and by his liberality he purchased  the affections of his army.

He had made two bridges over  the river Segre, at the distance of four miles from each other. He sent  foraging parties over these bridges, because he had already consumed all the  forage that was on his side of the river. The generals of Pompey's army did  almost the same thing, and for the same reason: and the horse had frequent  skirmishes with each other. When two of Fabius's legions had, as was their  constant practice, gone forth as the usual protection to the foragers, and had  crossed the river, and the baggage, and all the horse were following them,  on a sudden, from the weight of the cattle, and the mass of water, the bridge  fell, and all the horse were cut off from the main army, which being known  to Petreius and Afranius, from the timber and hurdles that were carried  down the river, Afranius immediately crossed his own bridge, which  communicated between his camp and the town, with four legions and all the  cavalry, and marched against Fabius's two legions. When his approach was  announced, Lucius Plancus, who had the command of those legions,  compelled by the emergency, took post on a rising ground; and drew up his  army with two fronts, that it might not be surrounded by the cavalry. Thus,  though engaged with superior numbers, he sustained the furious charge of  the legions and the horse. When the battle was begun by the horse, there  were observed at a distance by both sides the colors of two legions, which  Caius Fabius had sent round by the further bridge to reinforce our men,  suspecting, as the event verified, that the enemy's generals would take  advantage of the opportunity which fortune had put in their way, to attack  our men. Their approach put an end to the battle, and each general led back  his legions to their respective camps.

Being acquainted with the nature of  the country, he left behind him six cohorts to guard the bridge, the camp,  and all his baggage, and the next day set off in person for Ilerda, with all his  forces drawn up in three lines, and halted just before the camp of Afranius,  and having remained there a short time under arms, he offered him battle on  equal terms. When this affair was made, Afranius drew out his forces, and  posted them on the middle of a hill, near his camp. When Caesar perceived  that Afranius declined coming to an engagement, he resolved to encamp at  somewhat less than half a mile's distance from the very foot of the  mountain; and that his soldiers while engaged in their works, might not be  terrified by any sudden attack of the enemy, or disturbed in their work, he  ordered them not to fortify it with a wall, which must rise high, and be seen  at a distance, but draw, on the front opposite the enemy, a trench fifteen feet  broad. The first and second lines confined under arms, as was from the first  appointed. Behind them the third line was carrying on the work without  being seen; so that the whole was completed before Afranius discovered  that the camp was being fortified.

Afranius and Petreius, to frighten us and obstruct the work, drew out  their forces at the very foot of the mountain, and challenged us to battle.  Caesar, however, did not interrupt his work, relying on the protection of the  three legions, and the strength of the fosse.

In expectation  of this he led three legions out of the camp, and, drawing up his army in an  advantageous position, he ordered the advanced men of one legion to hasten  forward and seize the eminence.

This  method, however, alarmed our men, who were not used to such a  description of warfare. For they imagined that they were about to be  surrounded on their exposed flank by the single men who ran forward from  their ranks; and they thought it their duty to keep their ranks, and not to quit  their colors, nor, without good reason to give up the post which they had  taken.

But the  soldiers of the ninth legion, being over zealous to repair the dishonor which  had been sustained, having rashly pursued the fleeing enemy, advanced into  disadvantageous ground and went up to the foot of the mountain on which  the town Ilerda was built. And when they wished to retire they were again  attacked by the enemy from the rising ground. The place was craggy in the  front and steep on either side, and was so narrow that even three cohorts,  drawn up in order of battle, would fill it; but no relief could be sent on the  flanks, and the horse could be of no service to them when hard pressed.  From the town, indeed, the precipice inclined with a gentle slope for near  four hundred paces. Our men had to retreat this way, as they had, through  their eagerness, advanced too inconsiderately. The greatest contest was in  this place, which was much to the disadvantage of our troops, both on  account of its narrowness, and because they were posted at the foot of the  mountain, so that no weapon was thrown at them without effect; yet they  exerted their valor and patience, and bore every wound. The enemy's forces  were increasing, and cohorts were frequently sent to their aid from the camp  through the town, that fresh men might relieve the weary. Caesar was  obliged to do the same, and relieve the fatigued by sending cohorts to that  post.

For so great a storm arose, that it was  agreed that there were never seen higher floods in those countries; it swept  down the snow from all the mountains, and broke over the banks of the  river, and in one day carried away both the bridges which Fabius had built- a circumstance which caused great difficulties to Caesar's army. For as our  camp, as already mentioned, was pitched between two rivers, the Segre and  Cinca, and as neither of these could be forded for the space of thirty miles,  they were all of necessity confined within these narrow limits. Neither could  the states, which had espoused Caesar's cause, furnish him with corn, nor  the troops, which had gone far to forage, return, as they were stopped by the  waters: nor could the convoys, coming from Italy and Gaul, make their way  to the camp. Besides, it was the most distressing season of the year, when  there was no corn in the blade, and it was nearly ripe: and the states were  exhausted, because Afranius had conveyed almost all the corn, before  Caesar's arrival, into Ilerda, and whatever he had left, had been already  consumed by Caesar. The cattle, which might have served as a secondary  resource against want, had been removed by the states to a great distance on  account of the war. They who had gone out to get forage or corn, were  chased by the light troops of the Lusitanians, and the targeteers of Hither  Spain, who were well acquainted with the country, and could readily swim  across the river, because it is the custom of all those people not to join their  armies without bladders.

Archers from the Rutheni, and horse from the Gauls, with a long train of  baggage, according to the Gallic custom of traveling, had arrived there;  there were besides about six thousand people of all descriptions, with slaves  and freed men. But there was no order, or regular discipline, as every one  followed his own humor, and all traveled without apprehension, taking the  same liberty as on former marches. There were several young noblemen,  sons of senators, and of equestrian rank; there were embassadors from  several states; there were lieutenants of Caesar's. The river stopped them all.  To attack them by surprise, Afranius set out in the beginning of the night,  with all his cavalry and three legions, and sent the horse on before, to fall on  them unawares; but the Gallic horse soon got themselves in readiness, and  attacked them. Though but few, they withstood the vast number of the  enemy, as long as they fought on equal terms; but when the legions began to  approach, having lost a few men, they retreated to the next mountains. The  delay occasioned by this battle was of great importance to the security of our  men; for having gained time, they retired to the higher grounds. There were  missing that day about two hundred bow-men, a few horse, and an  inconsiderable number of servants and baggage.

Thus  prepared, and being apprised of the enemy's approach, they put out from the  harbor, and engaged the Massilians.

But our men, not having such expert seamen, or skillful  pilots, for they had been hastily drafted from the merchant ships, and were  not yet acquainted even with the names of the rigging, were moreover  impeded by the heaviness and slowness of our vessels, which having been  built in a hurry and of green timber, were not so easily maneuvered.  Therefore, when Caesar's men had an opportunity of a close engagement,  they cheerfully opposed two of the enemy's ships with one of theirs. And  throwing in the grappling-irons, and holding both ships fast, they fought on  both sides of the deck, and boarded the enemy's; and having killed numbers  of the Albici and shepherds, they sank some of their ships, took others with  the men on board, and drove the rest into the harbor.

When these were almost finished,  Afranius and Petreius began to be greatly alarmed, lest they should be  altogether cut off from corn and forage, because Caesar was very strong in  cavalry. They therefore resolved to quit their posts, and to transfer the war  to Celtiberia. There was, moreover, a circumstance that confirmed them in  this resolution: for of the two adverse parties, that, which had stood by  Sertorius in the late war, being conquered by Pompey, still trembled at his  name and sway, though absent: the other which had remained firm in  Pompey's interest, loved him for the favors which they had received: but  Caesar's name was not known to the barbarians. From these they expected  considerable aid, both of horse and foot, and hoped to protract the war till  winter, in a friendly country. Having come to this resolution, they gave  orders to collect all the ships in the river Ebro, and to bring them to  Octogesa, a town situated on the river Ebro, about twenty miles distant from  their camp. At this part of the river, they ordered a bridge to be made of  boats fastened together, and transported two legions over the river Segre,  and fortified their camp with a rampart, twelve feet high.

They applied  to their tribunes and centurions, and entreated them to inform Caesar that he  need not spare their labor or consider their danger; that they were ready and  able, and would venture to ford the river where the horse had crossed.  Caesar, encouraged by their zeal and importunity, though he felt reluctant to  expose his army to a river so exceedingly large, yet judged it prudent to  attempt it and make a trial. Accordingly, he ordered all the weaker soldiers,  whose spirit or strength seemed unequal to the fatigue, to be selected from  each century, and left them, with one legion besides, to guard the camp: the  rest of the legions he drew out without any baggage, and, having disposed a  great number of horses in the river, above and below the ford, he led his  army over. A few of his soldiers being carried away by the force of the  current, were stopped by the horse and taken up, and not a man perished.  His army being safe on the opposite bank, he drew out his forces and  resolved to lead them forward in three battalions: and so great was the ardor  of the soldiers that, notwithstanding the addition of a circuit of six miles and  a considerable delay in fording the river, before the ninth hour of the day  they came up with those who had set out at the third watch.

They retired behind these  mountains that they might avoid Caesar's cavalry, and, placing parties in the  narrow roads, stop the progress of his army and lead their own forces across  the Ebro without danger or apprehension. This it was their interest to  attempt and to effect by any means possible; but, fatigued by the skirmishes  all day, and by the labor of their march, they deferred it till the following  day; Caesar likewise encamped on the next hill.

Caesar in campis exercitum reficit, ne defessum proelio obiciat; rursus conantes progredi insequitur et moratur. Illi necessario maturius, quam constituerant, castra ponunt. Suberant enim montes, atque a milibus passuum V itinera difficilia atque angusta excipiebant. Hos montes intrasse cupiebant, ut equitatum effugerent Caesaris praesidiisque in angustiis collocatis exercitum itinere prohiberent, ipsi sine periculo ac timore Hiberum copias traducerent. Quod fuit illis conandum atque omni ratione efficiendum; sed totius diei pugna atque itineris labore defessi rem in posterum diem distulerunt. Caesar quoque in proximo colle castra ponit.

Upon this information Caesar  ordered the signal to be given and the military shout to be raised for packing  up the baggage. When they heard the shout, being afraid lest they should be  stopped in the night and obliged to engage under their baggage, or lest they  should be confined in the narrow roads by Caesar's horse, they put a stop to  their march and kept their forces in their camp. The next day Petreius went  out privately with a few horse to reconnoitre the country. A similar  movement was made from Caesar's camp. Lucius Decidius Saxa, was  detached with a small party to explore the nature of the country. Each  returned with the same account to his camp, that there was a level road for  the next five miles, that there then succeeded a rough and mountainous  country. Whichever should first obtain possession of the defiles would have  no trouble in preventing the other's progress.

The  majority were of opinion that they should begin their march at night, "for  they might reach the defiles before they should be discovered." Others,  because a shout had been raised the night before in Caesar's camp, used this  as an argument that they could not leave the camp unnoticed: "that Caesar's  cavalry were patrolling the whole night, and that all the ways and roads  were beset; that battles at night ought to be avoided, because, in civil  dissension, a soldier once daunted is more apt to consult his fears than his  oath; that the daylight raised a strong sense of shame in the eyes of all, and  that the presence of the tribunes and centurions had the same effect: by these  things the soldiers would be restrained and awed to their duty. Wherefore  they should, by all means, attempt to force their way by day; for, though a  trifling loss might be sustained, yet the post which they desired might be  secured with safety to the main body of the army." This opinion prevailed in  the council, and the next day, at the dawn, they resolved to set forward.

His soldiers were obliged to cross  extensive and difficult valleys. Craggy cliffs, in several places, interrupted  their march, insomuch that their arms had to be handed to one another, and  the soldiers were forced to perform a great part of their march unarmed, and  were lifted up the rocks by each other.

For our route was different from what we proposed, and  we appeared to be going a contrary way. But their generals applauded their  own prudence in keeping within their camp, and it was a strong  confirmation of their opinion, that they saw we marched without wagons or  baggage, which made them confident that we could not long endure want.  But when they saw our army gradually wheel to the right, and observed our  van was already passing the line of their camp, there was nobody so stupid,  or averse to fatigue, as not to think it necessary to march from the camp  immediately, and oppose us.

The  difficulty of the roads delayed Caesar's army, but his cavalry pursuing  Afranius's forces, retarded their march. However, the affair was necessarily  reduced to this point, with respect to Afranius's men, that if they first gained  the mountains, which they desired, they would themselves avoid all danger,  but could not save the baggage of their whole army, nor the cohorts which  they had left behind in the camps, to which, being intercepted by Caesar's  army, by no means could assistance be given. Caesar first accomplished the  march, and having found a plain behind large rocks, drew up his army there  in order of battle and facing the enemy. Afranius, perceiving that his rear  was galled by our cavalry, and seeing the enemy before him, having come to  a hill, made a halt on it. Thence he detached four cohorts of Spanish light  infantry to the highest mountain which was in view: to this he ordered them  to hasten with all expedition, and to take possession of it, with the intention  of going to the same place with all his forces, then altering his route, and  crossing the hills to Octogesa. As the Spaniards were making toward it in an  oblique direction, Caesar's horse espied them and attacked them, nor were  they able to withstand the charge of the cavalry even for a moment, but were  all surrounded and cut to pieces in the sight of the two armies.

The  lieutenants, centurions, and tribunes, gathered round him, and begged "that  he would not hesitate to begin the battle: that the hearts of all the soldiers  were very anxious for it: that Afranius's men had by several circumstances  betrayed signs of fear; in that they had not assisted their party; in that they  had not quitted the hill; in that they did not sustain the charge of our cavalry,  but crowding their standards into one place, did not observe either rank or  order.

Why should he hazard the loss of any of his men,  even in a successful battle? Why should he expose soldiers to be wounded,  who had deserved so well of him? Why, in short, should he tempt fortune?  especially when it was as much a general's duty to conquer by tactics as by  the sword. Besides, he was moved with compassion for those citizens, who,  he foresaw, must fall: and he had rather gain his object without any loss or  injury to them. This resolution of Caesar was not generally approved of; but  the soldiers openly declared to each other that since such an opportunity of  victory was let pass, they would not come to an engagement, even when  Caesar should wish it. He persevered however in his resolution, and retired  a little from that place to abate the enemy's fears. Petreius and Afranius,  having got this opportunity, retired to their camp. Caesar, having disposed  parties on the mountains, and cut off all access to the Ebro, fortified his  camp as close to the enemy as he could.

The tribunes and  centurions followed their example; the soldiers were brought out by  centuries, and took the same oath.

Si mons erat ascendendus, facile ipsa loci natura periculum repellebat, quod ex locis superioribus, qui antecesserant, suos ascendentes protegebant; cum vallis aut locus declivis suberat, neque ei, qui antecesserant, morantibus opem ferre poterant, equites vero ex loco superiore in aversos tela coniciebant, tum magno erat in periculo res. Relinquebatur, ut, cum eiusmodi locis esset appropinquatum, legionum signa consistere iuberent magnoque impetu equitatum repellerent, eo submoto repente incitati cursu sese in valles universi demitterent atque ita transgressi rursus in locis superioribus consisterent. Nam tantum ab equitum suorum auxiliis aberant, quorum numerum habebant magnum, ut eos superioribus perterritos proeliis in medium reciperent agmen ultroque eos tuerentur; quorum nulli ex itinere excedere licebat, quin ab equitatu Caesaris exciperetur.

For having advanced four miles, and being very  much harassed by our horse, they took post on a high mountain, and there in  trenched themselves on the front only, facing the enemy; and did not take  their baggage off their cattle. When they perceived that Caesar's camp was  pitched, and the tents fixed up, and his horse sent out to forage, they  suddenly rushed out about twelve o'clock the same day, and, having hopes  that we should be delayed by the absence of our horse, they began to march,  which Caesar perceiving, followed them with the legions that remained. He  left a few cohorts to guard his baggage, and ordered the foragers to be called  home at the tenth hour, and the horse to follow him. The horse shortly  returned to their daily duty on march, and charged the rear so vigorously,  that they almost forced them to fly; and several privates and some  centurions were killed. The main body of Caesar's army was at hand, and  universal ruin threatened them.

 Tali dum pugnatur modo, lente atque paulatim proceditur, crebroque, ut sint auxilio suis, subsistunt; ut tum accidit. Milia enim progressi IIII vehementiusque peragitati ab equitatu montem excelsum capiunt ibique una fronte contra hostem castra muniunt neque iumentis onera deponunt. Ubi Caesaris castra posita tabernaculaque constituta et dimissos equites pabulandi causa animum adverterunt, sese subito proripiunt hora circiter sexta eiusdem diei et spem nacti morae discessu nostrorum equitum iter facere incipiunt. Qua re animum adversa Caesar refectis legionibus subsequitur, praesidio impedimentis paucas cohortes relinquit; hora x subsequi pabulatores equitesque revocari iubet. Celeriter equitatus ad cotidianum itineris officium revertitur. Pugnatur acriter ad novissimum agmen, adeo ut paene terga convertant, compluresque milites, etiam nonnulli centuriones, interficiuntur. Instabat agmen Caesaris atque universum imminebat.

But for the reasons already given, Caesar did not  attack them, nor suffer a tent to be pitched that day, that his men might be  the readier to pursue them whether they attempted to run off by night or by  day. Observing the defect in their position, they spent the whole night in  extending their work, and turning their camp to ours. The next day, at dawn,  they do the same, and spend the whole day in that manner, but in proportion  as they advanced their works, and extended their camp, they were further  distant from the water; and one evil was remedied by another. The first  night, no one went out for water. The next day, they left a guard in the  camp, and led out all their forces to water: but not a person was sent to look  for forage. Caesar was more desirous that they should be humbled by these  means, and forced to come to terms, than decide the contest by battle. Yet  he endeavored to surround them with a wall and trench, that he might be  able to check their most sudden sally, to which he imagined that they must  have recourse. Hereupon, urged by want of fodder, that they might be the  readier for a march, they killed all their baggage cattle.

By the third day a considerable part of Caesar's work was  finished. To interrupt his progress, they drew out their legions about the  eighth hour, by a certain signal, and placed them in order of battle before  their camp. Caesar calling his legions off from their work, and ordering the  horse to hold themselves in readiness, marshaled his army: for to appear to  decline an engagement contrary to the opinion of the soldiers and the  general voice, would have been attended with great disadvantage. But for  the reasons already known, he was dissuaded from wishing to engage, and  the more especially, because the short space between the camps, even if the  enemy were put to flight, would not contribute much to a decisive victory;  for the two camps were not distant from each other above two thousand feet.  Two parts of this were occupied by the armies, and one third left for the  soldiers to charge and make their attack. If a battle should be begun, the  nearness of the camps would afford a ready retreat to the conquered party in  the flight. For this reason Caesar had resolved to make resistance if they  attacked him, but not to be the first to provoke the battle.

Caesar had three lines, four cohorts out of each of the five legions formed  the first line. Three more from each legion followed them, as reserves: and  three others were behind these. The slingers and archers were stationed in  the center of the line; the cavalry closed the flanks. The hostile armies being  arranged in this manner, each seemed determined to adhere to his first  intention: Caesar not to hazard a battle, unless forced to it; Afranius to  interrupt Caesar's works. However, the matter was deferred, and both armies  kept under arms till sunset; when they both returned to their camp. The next  day Caesar prepared to finish the works which he had begun. The enemy  attempted to pass the river Segre by a ford. Caesar, having perceived this,  sent some light armed Germans and a party of horse across the river, and  disposed several parties along the banks to guard them.

When this was refused by Caesar, but a public interview offered if  they chose it, Afranius's son was given as a hostage to Caesar. They met in  the place appointed by Caesar. In the hearing of both armies Afranius spoke  thus: "That Caesar ought not to be displeased either with him or his soldiers,  for wishing to preserve their attachment to their general, Cneius Pompey.  That they had now sufficiently discharged their duty to him, and had  suffered punishment enough, in having endured the want of every necessary:  but now, pent up almost like wild beasts, they were prevented from  procuring water, and prevented from walking abroad; and were not able to  bear the bodily pain or the mental disgrace: but confessed themselves  vanquished: and begged and entreated, if there was any room left for mercy,  that they should not be necessitated to suffer the most severe penalties."  These sentiments were delivered in the most submissive and humble  language.

Thus, that the parties on both  sides inclined to mercy: that the generals only were averse to peace: that  they paid no regard to the laws either of conference or truce; and had most  inhumanly put to death ignorant persons, who were deceived by a  conference: that therefore, they had met that fate which usually befalls men  from excessive obstinacy and arrogance; and were obliged to have recourse,  and most earnestly desire that which they had shortly before disdained. That  for his part, he would not avail himself of their present humiliation, or his  present advantage, to require terms by which his power might be increased,  but only that those armies, which they had maintained for so many years to  oppose him, should be disbanded: for six legions had been sent into Spain,  and a seventh raised there, and many and powerful fleets provided, and  generals of great military experience sent to command them, for no other  purpose than to oppose him: that none of these measures were adopted to  keep the Spains in peace, or for the use of the province, which, from the  length of the peace, stood in need of no such aid; that all these things were  long since designed against him; that against him a new sort of government  was established, that the same person should be at the gates of Rome, to  direct the affairs of the city; and though absent, have the government of two  most warlike provinces for so many years: that against him the laws of the  magistrates had been altered; that the late praetors and consuls should not be  sent to govern the provinces as had been the constant custom, but persons  approved of and chosen by a faction. That against him the excuse of age was  not admitted; but persons of tried experience in former wars were called up  to take the command of the armies: that with respect to him only, the routine  was not observed which had been allowed to all generals, that, after a  successful war, they should return home and disband their armies, if not  with some mark of honor, at least without disgrace; that he had submitted to  all these things patiently, and would still submit to them; nor did he now  desire to take their army from them and keep it to himself (which, however,  would not be a difficult matter), but only that they should not have it to  employ against him: and therefore, as he said before, let them quit the  provinces, and disband their army. If this was complied with, he would  injure no person; that these were the last and only conditions of peace."

 Ad ea Caesar respondit: nulli omnium has partes vel querimoniae vel miserationis minus convenisse. Reliquos enim omnes officium suum praestitisse: se, qui etiam bona condicione, et loco et tempore aequo, confligere noluerit, ut quam integerrima essent ad pacem omnia; exercitum suum, qui iniuria etiam accepta suisque interfectis, quos in sua potestate habuerit, conservarit et texerit; illius denique exercitus milites, qui per se de concilianda pace egerint; qua in re omnium suorum vitae consulendum putarint. Sic omnium ordinum partes in misericordia constitisse: ipsos duces a pace abhorruisse; eos neque colloquii neque indutiarum iura servasse et homines imperitos et per colloquium deceptos crudelissime interfecisse. Accidisse igitur his, quod plerumque hominum nimia pertinacia atque arrogantia accidere soleat, uti eo recurrant et id cupidissime petant, quod paulo ante contempserint. Neque nunc se illorum humilitate neque aliqua temporis opportunitate postulare, quibus rebus opes augeantur suae; sed eos exercitus, quos contra se multos iam annos aluerint, velle dimitti. Neque enim sex legiones alia de causa missas in Hispaniam septimamque ibi conscriptam neque tot tantasque classes paratas neque submissos duces rei militaris peritos. Nihil horum ad pacandas Hispanias, nihil ad usum provinciae provisum, quae propter diuturnitatem pacis nullum auxilium desiderarit. Omnia haec iam pridem contra se parari; in se novi generis imperia constitui, ut idem ad portas urbanis praesideat rebus et duas bellicosissimas provincias absens tot annis obtineat; in se iura magistratuum commutari, ne ex praetura et consulatu, ut semper, sed per paucos probati et electi in provincias mittantur; in se etiam aetatis excusationem nihil valere, cum superioribus bellis probati ad obtinendos exercitus evocentur; in se uno non servari, quod sit omnibus datum semper imperatoribus, ut rebus feliciter gestis aut cum honore aliquo aut certe sine ignominia domum revertantur exercitumque dimittant. Quae tamen omnia et se tulisse patienter et esse laturum; neque nunc id agere, ut ab illis abductum exercitum teneat ipse, quod tamen sibi difficile non sit, sed ne illi habeant, quo contra se uti possint. Proinde, ut esset dictum, provinciis excederent exercitumque dimitterent; si id sit factum, se nociturum nemini. Hanc unam atque extremam esse pacis condicionem.

For when a debate was introduced  about the place and time of their dismissal, they all began to express, both  by words and signs, from the rampart where they stood, that they should be  discharged immediately; for although every security might be given, that  they would be disbanded, still the matter would be uncertain, if it was  deferred to a future day. After a short debate on either side, it was brought to  this issue: that those who had any settlement or possession in Spain, should  be immediately discharged: the rest at the river Var. Caesar gave security  that they should receive no damage, and that no person should be obliged  against his inclination to take the military oath under him.

He further adds, that  whatever any of them lost in the war, which was in the possession of his  soldiers, should be restored to those that lost them. To his soldiers he made  a recompense in money for those things, a just valuation being made.  Whatever disputes Afranius's soldiers had afterward among themselves,  they voluntarily submitted to Caesar's decision. Afranius and Petreius, when  pay was demanded by the legions, a sedition almost breaking out, asserted  that the time had not yet come, and required that Caesar should take  cognizance of it; and both parties were content with his decision. About a  third part of their army being dismissed in two days, Caesar ordered two of  his legions, to go before, the rest to follow the vanquished enemy; that they  should encamp at a small distance from each other. The execution of this  business he gave in charge to Quintus Fufius Kalenus, one of his  lieutenants. According to his directions, they marched from Spain to the  river Var, and there the rest of the army was disbanded.
