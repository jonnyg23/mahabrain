For Massilia is washed almost on  three sides by the sea, the remaining fourth part is the only side which has  access by land. A part even of this space, which reaches to the fortress,  being fortified by the nature of the country, and a very deep valley, required  a long and difficult siege. To accomplish these works, Caius Trebonius  sends for a great quantity of carriages and men from the whole Province,  and orders hurdles and materials to be furnished. These things being  provided, he raised a mound eighty feet in height.

 Dum haec in Hispania geruntur, C. Trebonius legatus, qui ad oppugnationem Massiliae relictus erat, duabus ex partibus aggerrem, vineas turresque ad oppidum agere instituit.  Una erat proxima portui navalibusque, altera ad portam, qua est aditus ex Gallia atque Hispania, ad id mare, quod adiacet ad ostium Rhodani.  Massilia enim fere tribus ex oppidi partibus mari alluitur; reliqua quarta est, quae aditum habeat ab terra.  Huius quoque spatii pars ea, quae ad arcem pertinet, loci natura et valle altissima munita longam et difficilem habet oppugnationem.  Ad ea perficienda opera C. Trebonius magnam iumentorum atque hominum multitudinem ex omni provincia vocat; vimina materiamque comportari iubet.  Quibus comparatis rebus aggerem in altitudinem pedum LXXX exstruit.

For  poles twelve feet in length, pointed with iron, and these too shot from very  large engines, sank into the ground through four rows of hurdles. Therefore  the arches of the vineae were covered over with beams a foot thick, fastened  together, and under this the materials of the agger were handed from one to  another. Before this was carried a testudo sixty feet long, for leveling the  ground, made also of very strong timber, and covered over with every thing  that was capable of protecting it against the fire and stones thrown by the  enemy. But the greatness of the works, the height of the wall and towers,  and the multitude of engines retarded the progress of our works. Besides,  frequent sallies were made from the town by the Albici, and fire was thrown  on our mound and turrets. These our men easily repulsed, and, doing  considerable damage to those who sallied, beat them back into the town.

 Sed tanti erant antiquitus in oppido omnium rerum ad bellum apparatus tantaque multitudo tormentorum, ut eorum vim nullae contextae viminibus vineae sustinere possent.   Asseres enim pedum XII cuspidibus praefixi atque hi maximis bllistis missi per IIII ordines cratium in terra defigebantur.  Itaque pedalibus lignis coniunctis inter se porticus integebantur, atque hac agger inter manus proferebatur. Antecedebat testudo pedum LX aequandi loci causa facta item ex fortissimis lignis, convoluta omnibus rebus, quibus ignis iactus et lapides defendi possent. Sed magnitudo operum, altitudo muri atque turrium, multitudo tormentorum omnem administrationem tardabat. Crebrae etiam per Albicos eruptiones fiebant ex oppido ignesque aggeri et turribus inferebantur; quae facile nostri milites repellebant magnisque ultro illatis detrimentis eos, qui eruptionem fecerant, in oppidum reiciebant.

Having  joined this to his other ships, he made good his voyage to Massilia, and  having sent in a galley privately, acquaints Domitius and the Massilians of  his arrival, and earnestly encourages them to hazard another battle with  Brutus's fleet with the addition of his aid.

They had got several fishing-smacks, and covered them over, that the  seamen might be secure against darts: these they filled with archers and  engines. With a fleet thus appointed, encouraged by the entreaties and tears  of all the old men, matrons, and virgins to succor the state in this hour of  distress, they went on board with no less spirit and confidence than they had  fought before. For it happens, from a common infirmity of human nature,  that we are more flushed with confidence, or more vehemently alarmed at  things unseen, concealed, and unknown, as was the case then. For the arrival  of Lucius Nasidius had filled the state with the most sanguine hopes and  wishes. Having got a fair wind, they sailed out of port and went to Nasidius  to Taurois, which is a fort belonging to the Massilians, and there ranged  their fleet and again encouraged each other to engage and communicated  their plan of operation. The command of the right division was given to the  Massilians, that of the left to Nasidius.

Tali modo instructa classe omnium seniorum, matrum familiae, virginum precibus et fletu excitati, extremo tempore civitati subvenirent, non minore animo ac fiducia, quam ante dimicaverant, naves conscendunt.

Dextra pars attribuitur Massiliensibus, sinistra Nasidio.

Accordingly, having encouraged his men to  despise a vanquished people whom they had conquered when yet unbroken,  he advanced against them full of confidence and spirit. From Trebonius's  camp and all the higher grounds it was easy to see into the town-how all  the youth which remained in it, and all persons of more advanced years,  with their wives and children, and the public guards, were either extending  their hands from the wall to the heavens, or were repairing to the temples of  the immortal gods, and prostrating themselves before their images, were  entreating them to grant them victory. Nor was there a single person who  did not imagine that his future fortune depended on the issue of that day; for  the choice of their youth and the most respectable of every age, being  expressly invited and solicited, had gone on board the fleet, that if any  adverse fate should befall them they might see that nothing was left for them  to attempt, and, if they proved victorious, they might have hopes of  preserving the city, either by their internal resources or by foreign  assistance.

Neque erat quisquam omnium, quin in eius diei casu suarum omnium fortunarum eventum consistere existimaret. Nam et honesti ex iuventute et cuiusque aetatis amplissimi nominatim evocati atque obsecrati naves conscenderant ut, si quid adversi accidisset, ne ad conandum quidem sibi quicquam reliqui fore viderent; si superavissent, vel domesticis opibus vel externis auxiliis de salute urbis confiderent.

Our ships being at some distance from each other, room was allowed both  for the skill of their pilots and the maueuvering of their ships; and if at any  time ours, gaining an advantage by casting the iron hooks on board their  ships, grappled with them, from all parts they assisted those who were  distressed. Nor, after being joined by the Albici, did they decline coming to  close engagement, nor were they much inferior to our men in valor. At the  same time, showers of darts, thrown from a distance from the lesser ships,  suddenly inflicted several wounds on our men when off their guard and  otherwise engaged; and two of their three-decked galleys; having descried  the ship of Decimus Brutus, which could be easily distinguished by its flag,  rowed up against him with great violence from opposite sides: but Brutus,  seeing into their designs, by the swiftness of his ship extricated himself with  such address as to get clear, though only by a moment. From the velocity of  their motion they struck against each other with such violence that they were  both excessively injured by the shock; the beak, indeed, of one of them  being broken off, the whole ship was ready to founder, which circumstance  being observed, the ships of Brutus's fleet, which were nearest that station,  attack them when in this disorder and sink them both.

Therefore,  of the number of the ships not one was lost: of the fleet of the Massilians  five were sunk, four taken, and one ran off with Nasidius: all that escaped  made the best of their way to Hither Spain, but one of the rest was sent  forward to Massilia for the purpose of bearing this intelligence, and when it  came near the city, the whole people crowded out to hear the tidings, and,  on being informed of the event, were so oppressed with grief, that one  would have imagined that the city had been taken by an enemy at the same  moment. The Massilians, however, began to make the necessary  preparations for the defense of their city with unwearied energy.

To it they retreated,  and from it they made defense if any superior force attacked them; and from  it they sallied out either to repel or pursue the enemy. It extended thirty feet  on every side, and the thickness of the walls was five feet. But afterward, as  experience is the best master in every thing on which the wit of man is  employed, it was found that it might be of considerable service if it was  raised to the usual height of turrets, which was effected in the following  manner.

They, moreover, built over the joists  with small bricks as high as the protection of the plutei and vineae permitted  them; and on that place they laid two beams across, angle-ways, at a small  distance from the outer walls, to support the rafters which were to cover the  turret, and on the beams they laid joists across in a direct line, and on these  they fastened down planks. These joists they made somewhat longer, to  project beyond the outside of the wall, that they might serve to hang a  curtain on them to defend and repel all blows while they were building the  walls between that and the next floor, and the floor of this story they faced  with bricks and mortar, that the enemy's fire might do them no damage; and  on this they spread mattresses, lest the weapons thrown from engines should  break through the flooring, or stones from catapults should batter the brick  work. They, moreover, made three mats of cable ropes, each of them the  length of the turret walls, and four feet broad, and, hanging them round the  turret on the three sides which faced the enemy, fastened them to the  projecting joists. For this was the only sort of defense which, they had  learned by experience in other places, could not be pierced by darts or  engines. But when that part of the turret which was completed was protected  and secured against every attempt of the enemy, they removed the plutei to  other works. They began to suspend gradually, and raise by screws from the  first-floor, the entire roof of the turret, and then they elevated it as high as  the length of the mats allowed. Hid and secured within these coverings, they  built up the walls with bricks, and again, by another turn of the screw,  cleared a place for themselves to proceed with the building; and, when they  thought it time to lay another floor, they laid the ends of the beams, covered  in by the outer bricks in like manner as in the first story, and from that story  they again raised the uppermost floor and the mat-work. In this manner,  securely and without a blow or danger, they raised it six stories high, and in  laying the materials left loop-holes in such places as they thought proper for  working their engines.

This was the form of it: first,  two beams of equal length were laid on the ground, at the distance of four  feet from each other; and in them were fastened small pillars, five feet high,  which were joined together by braces, with a gentle slope, on which the  timber which they must place to support the roof of the musculus should be  laid: upon this were laid beams, two feet square, bound with iron plates and  nails. To the upper covering of the musculus and the upper beams, they  fastened laths, four fingers square, to support the tiles which were to cover  the musculus. The roof being thus sloped and laid over in rows in the same  manner as the joists were laid on the braces, the musculus was covered with  tiles and mortar, to secure it against fire, which might be thrown from the  wall. Over the tiles hides are spread, to prevent the water let in on them by  spouts from dissolving the cement of the bricks. Again, the hides were  covered over with mattresses, that they might not be destroyed by fire or  stones. The soldiers under the protection of the vineae, finish this whole  work to the very tower; and suddenly, before the enemy were aware of it,  moved it forward by naval machinery, by putting rollers under it, close up to  the enemy's turret, so that it even touched the building.

When they perceived this, they altered their  plan, and set fire to barrels, filled with resin and tar, and rolled them down  from the wall on the musculus. As soon as they fell on it, they slid off again,  and were removed from its side by long poles and forks. In the mean time,  the soldiers, under cover of the musculus, were rooting out with crow-bars  the lowest stones of the enemy's turret, with which the foundation was laid.  The musculus was defended by darts, thrown from engines by our men from  the brick tower, and the enemy were beaten off from the wall and turrets;  nor was a fair opportunity of defending the walls given them. At length  several stones being picked away from the foundation of that turret next the  musculus, part of it fell down suddenly, and the rest, as if following it,  leaned forward.

At this uncommon occurrence,  the whole progress of the war was stopped, and the soldiers, turning away  from the battle, ran eagerly to hear and listen to them. When the enemy  came up to the commanders and the army, they all fell down at their feet,  and besought them "to wait till Caesar's arrival; they saw that their city was  taken, our works completed, and their tower undermined, therefore they  desisted from a defense; that no obstacle could arise, to prevent their being  instantly plundered at a beck, as soon as he arrived, if they refused to submit  to his orders." They inform them that, "if the turret had entirely fallen down,  the soldiers could not be withheld from forcing into the town and sacking it,  in hopes of getting spoil." These and several other arguments to the same  effect were delivered, as they were a people of great learning, with great  pathos and lamentations.

A sort of truce having been made through  compassion for the besieged, the arrival of Caesar is anxiously awaited; not  a dart was thrown from the walls or by our men, but all remit their care and  diligence, as if the business was at an end. For Caesar had given Trebonius  strict charge not to suffer the town to be taken by storm, lest the soldiers,  too much irritated both by abhorrence of their revolt, by the contempt shown  to them, and by their long labor, should put to the sword all the grown up  inhabitants, as they threatened to do. And it was with difficulty that they  were then restrained from breaking into the town, and they were much  displeased, because they imagined that they were prevented by Trebonius  from taking possession of it.

And after an interval  of some days, when our men were careless and negligent, on a sudden, at  noon, when some were dispersed, and others indulging themselves in rest on  the very works, after the fatigue of the day, and their arms were all laid by  and covered up, they sallied out from the gates, and, the wind being high  and favorable to them, they set fire to our works; and the wind spread it in  such a manner that, in the same instant, the agger, plutei, testudo, tower, and  engines all caught the flames and were consumed before we could conceive  how it had occurred. Our men, alarmed at such an unexpected turn of  fortune, lay hold on such arms as they could find. Some rush from the camp;  an attack is made on the enemy: but they were prevented, by arrows and  engines from the walls; from pursuing them when they fled. They retired to  their walls, and there, without fear, set the musculus and brick tower on fire.  Thus, by the perfidy of the enemy and the violence of the storm, the labor of  many months was destroyed in a moment. The Massilians made the same  attempt the next day, having got such another storm. They sallied out  against the other tower and agger, and fought with more confidence. But as  our men had on the former occasion given up all thoughts of a contest, so,  warned by the event of the preceding day, they had made every preparation  for a defense. Accordingly, they slew several, and forced the rest to retreat  into the town without effecting their design.

There was no place left them from which the materials for their mound  could be fetched, in consequence of all the timber, far and wide, in the  territories of the Massilians, having been cut down and carried away; they  began therefore to make an agger of a new construction, never heard of  before, of two walls of brick, each six feet thick, and to lay floors over them  of almost the same breadth with the agger, made of timber. But wherever  the space between the walls, or the weakness of the timber, seemed to  require it, pillars were placed underneath and traversed beams laid on to  strengthen the work, and the space which was floored was covered over  with hurdles, and the hurdles plastered over with mortar. The soldiers,  covered over head by the floor, on the right and left by the wall, and in the  front by the mantlets, carried whatever materials were necessary for the  building without danger: the business was soon finished-the loss of their  laborious work was soon repaired by the dexterity and fortitude of the  soldiers. Gates for making sallies were left in the wall in such places as they  thought proper.

That though, being pre-engaged to Cneius  Pompey in quality of lieutenant, he was bound in honor to him, that,  nevertheless, there existed a very intimate tie between him and Caesar; that  he was not ignorant of what was the duty of a lieutenant, who bore an office  of trust; nor of his own strength, nor of the disposition of the whole  province to Caesar. These sentiments he constantly expressed in his  ordinary conversation, and did not attach himself to either party. But  afterward, when he found that Caesar was detained before Massilia, that the  forces of Petreius had effected a junction with the army of Afranius, that  considerable reinforcements had come to their assistance, that there were  great hopes and expectations, and heard that the whole Hither province had  entered into a confederacy, and of the difficulties to which Caesar was  reduced afterward at Ilerda for want of provisions, and Afranius wrote to  him a fuller and more exaggerated account of these matters, he began to  regulate his movements by those of fortune.

He commanded the inhabitants of Gades to  build ten ships of war; besides, he took care that several others should be  built in Spain. He removed all the money and ornaments from the temple of  Hercules to the town of Gades, and sent six cohorts thither from the  province to guard them, and gave the command of the town of Gades to  Caius Gallonius, a Roman knight, and friend of Domitius, who had come  thither sent by Domitius to recover an estate for him; and he deposited all  the arms, both public and private, in Gallonius's house. He himself [Varro]  made severe harangues against Caesar. He often pronounced from his  tribunal that Caesar had fought several unsuccessful battles, and that a great  number of his men had deserted to Afranius. That he had these accounts  from undoubted messengers, and authority on which he could rely. By these  means he terrified the Roman citizens of that province, and obliged them to  promise him for the service of the state one hundred and ninety thousand  sesterces, twenty thousand pounds weight of silver, and a hundred and  twenty thousand bushels of wheat. He laid heavier burdens on those states  which he thought were friendly disposed to Caesar, and billeted troops on  them; he passed judgment against some private persons, and condemned to  confiscation the properties of those who had spoken or made orations  against the republic, and forced the whole province to take an oath of  allegiance to him and Pompey. Being informed of all that happened in  Hither Spain, he prepared for war. This was his plan of operations. He was  to retire with his two legions to Gades, and to lay up all the shipping and  provisions there. For he had been informed that the whole province was  inclined to favor Caesar's party. He thought that the war might be easily  protracted in an island, if he was provided with corn and shipping. Caesar,  although called back to Italy by many and important matters, yet had  determined to leave no dregs of war behind him in Spain, because he knew  that Pompey had many dependents and clients in the hither province.

The affection of the  province to Caesar proved so great and so favorable, that he received a letter  from Gades, before he was far advanced on his march: that as soon as the  nobility of Gades heard of Caesar's proclamation, they had combined with  the tribune of the cohorts, which were in garrison there, to drive Gallonius  out of the town, and to secure the city and island for Caesar. That having  agreed on the design they had sent notice to Gallonius, to quit Gades of his  own accord while he could do it with safety; if he did not, they would take  measures for themselves; that for fear of this Gallonius had been induced to  quit the town. When this was known, one of Varro's two legions, which was  called Vernacula, carried off the colors from Varro's camp, he himself  standing by and looking on, and retired to Hispalis, and took post in the  market and public places without doing any injury, and the Roman citizens  residing there approved so highly of this act, that every one most earnestly  offered to entertain them in their houses. When Varro, terrified at these  things, having altered his route, proposed going to Italica, he was informed  by his friends that the gates were shut against him. Then indeed, when  intercepted from every road, he sends word to Caesar, that he was ready to  deliver up the legion which he commanded. He sends to him Sextus Caesar,  and orders him to deliver it up to him. Varro, having delivered up the  legion, went to Caesar to Corduba, and having laid before him the public  accounts, handed over to him most faithfully whatever money he had, and  told him what quantity of corn and shipping he had, and where.

Having advanced two days, he  came to the river Bagrada, and there left Caius Caninius Rebilus, the  lieutenant, with the legions; and went forward himself with the horse to  view the Cornelian camp, because that was reckoned a very eligible position  for encamping. It is a straight ridge, projecting into the sea, steep and rough  on both sides, but the ascent is more gentle on that part which lies opposite  Utica. It is not more than a mile distant from Utica in a direct line. But on  this road there is a spring, to which the sea comes up, and overflows; an  extensive morass is thereby formed; and if a person would avoid it, he must  make a circuit of six miles to reach the town.

At the same time he observed the roads very full of carriages and  cattle, which they were conveying from the country into the town on the  sudden alarm. He sent his cavalry after them to plunder them and get the  spoil. And at the same time Varus had detached as a guard for them six  hundred Numidian horse, and four hundred foot, which king Juba had sent  to Utica as auxiliaries a few days before. There was a friendship subsisting  between his [Juba's] father and Pompey, and a feud between him and Curio,  because he, when a tribune of the people, had proposed a law, in which he  endeavored to make public property of the kingdom of Juba. The horse  engaged; but the Numidians were not able to stand our first charge; but a  hundred and twenty being killed, the rest retreated into their camp near the  town. In the mean time, on the arrival of his men of war, Curio ordered  proclamation to be made to the merchant ships, which lay at anchor before  Utica, in number about two hundred, that he would treat as enemies all that  did not set sail immediately for the Cornelian camp. As soon as the  proclamation was made, in an instant they all weighed anchor and left Utica,  and repaired to the place commanded them. This circumstance furnished the  army with plenty of every thing.

The next day he led his army to Utica, and encamped near the  town. Before the works of the camp were finished, the horse upon guard  brought him word that a large supply of horse and foot sent by king Juba  were on their march to Utica, and at the same time a cloud of dust was  observed, and in a moment the front of the line was in sight. Curio,  surprised at the suddenness of the affair, sent on the horse to receive their  first charge, and detain them. He immediately called off his legions from the  work, and put them in battle array. The horse began the battle: and before  the legions could be completely marshaled and take their ground, the king's  entire forces being thrown into disorder and confusion, because they had  marched without any order, and were under no apprehensions, betake  themselves to flight: almost all the enemy's horse being safe, because they  made a speedy retreat into the town along the shore, Caesar's soldiers slay a  great number of their infantry.

They, whether they uttered the sentiments which they really  entertained, or wished to gratify Varus (for what we wish we readily give  credit to, and what we think ourselves, we hope is the opinion of other  men), assured him, that the minds of the whole army were disaffected to  Curio, that it was very expedient that the armies should be brought in view  of each other, and an opportunity of a conference be given. Induced by their  opinion, Varus the next day led his troops out of the camp: Curio did so in  like manner, and with only one small valley between them, each drew up his  forces.

When Caesar gave him his liberty, he went over to Africa; now, Curio had  transported to Africa those legions which Caesar had received under his  command a short time before at Corfinium; so that the officers and  companies were still the same, excepting the change of a few centurions.  Quintilius, making this a pretext for addressing them, began to go round  Curio's lines, and to entreat the soldiers "not to lose all recollection of the  oath which they took first to Domitius and to him their quaestor, nor bear  arms against those who had shared the same fortune, and endured the same  hardships in a siege, nor fight for those by whom they had been  opprobriously called deserters." To this he added a few words by way of  encouragement, what they might expect from his own liberality, if they  should follow him and Attius. On the delivery of this speech, no intimation  of their future conduct is given by Curio's army, and thus both generals led  back their troops to their camp.

For every one formed an opinion of his own; and to what he had heard  from others, added his own apprehensions. When this had spread from a  single author to several persons, and was handed from one another, there  appeared to be many authors for such sentiments as these: "That it was a  civil war; that they were men; and therefore that it was lawful for them to  act freely, and follow which party they pleased." These were the legions  which a short time before had belonged to the enemy; for the custom of  offering free towns to those who joined the opposite party had changed  Caesar's kindness. For the harshest expressions of the soldiers in general did  not proceed from the Marsi and Peligni, as those which passed in the tents  the night before; and some of their fellow soldiers heard them with  displeasure. Some additions were also made to them by those who wished to  be thought more zealous in their duty.

There were some opinions,  which advised by all means an attempt to be made, and an attack on Varus's  camp; for when such sentiments prevailed among the soldiers, they thought  idleness was improper. In short, they said "that it was better bravely to try  the hazard of war in a battle, than to be deserted and surrounded by their  own troops, and forced to submit to the greatest cruelties." There were some  who gave their opinion, that they ought to withdraw at the third watch to the  Cornelian camp; that by a longer interval of time the soldiers might be  brought to a proper way of thinking; and also, that if any misfortune should  befall them, they might have a safer and readier retreat to Sicily, from the  great number of their ships.

For on what, says he, can we rely that we can storm a  camp, fortified both by nature and art? Or, indeed, what advantage do we  gain if we give over the assault, after having suffered considerable loss; as if  success did not acquire for a general the affection of his army, and  misfortune their hatred? But what does a change of camp imply but a  shameful flight and universal despair, and the alienation of the army? For  neither ought the obedient to suspect that they are distrusted, nor the  insolent to know that we fear them; because our fears augment the  licentiousness of the latter, and diminish the zeal of the former. But if, says  he, we were convinced of the truth of the reports of the disaffection of the  army (which I indeed am confident are either altogether groundless, or at  least less than they are supposed to be), how much better to conceal and  hide our suspicions of it, than by our conduct confirm it? Ought not the  defects of an army to be as carefully concealed as the wounds in our bodies,  lest we should increase the enemy's hopes? but they moreover advise us to  set out at midnight, in order, I suppose, that those who attempt to do wrong  may have a fairer opportunity; for conduct of this kind is restrained either by  shame or fear, to the display of which the night is most averse. Wherefore, I  am neither so rash as to give my opinion that we ought to attack their camp  without hopes of succeeding; nor so influenced by fear as to despond: and I  imagine that every expedient ought first to be tried; and I am in a great  degree confident that I shall form the same opinions as yourselves on this  matter."

Quasi non et felicitas rerum gestarum exercitus benevolentiam imperatoribus et res adversae odia colligant! Castrorum autem mutatio quid habet nisi turpem fugam et desperationem omnium et alienationem exercitus? Nam neque pudentes suspicari oportet sibi parum credi, neque improbos scire sese timeri, quod his licentiam timor augeat noster, illis studia deminuat." "Quod si iam," inquit, "haec explorata habeamus, quae de exercitus alienatione dicuntur, quae quidem ego aut omnino falsa aut certe minora opinione esse confido, quanto haec dissimulari et occultari, quam per nos confirmari praestet? An non, uti corporis vulnera, ita exercitus incommoda sunt tegenda, ne spem adversariis augeamus?

For, says he, all the  municipal towns afterward imitated you and your conduct; nor was it  without reason that Caesar judged so favorably, and the enemy so harshly of  you. For Pompey, though beaten in no engagement, yet was obliged to shift  his ground, and leave Italy, from the precedent established by your conduct.  Caesar commited me, whom he considered his dearest friend, and the  provinces of Sicily and Africa, without which he was not able to protect  Rome or Italy, to your protection. There are some here present who  encourage you to revolt from us; for what can they wish for more, than at  once to ruin us, and to involve you in a heinous crime? or what baser  opinions could they in their resentment entertain of you, than that you would  betray those who acknowledged themselves indebted to you for every thing,  and put yourselves in the power of those who think they have been ruined  by you? Have you not heard of Caesar's exploits in Spain? that he routed  two armies, conquered two generals, recovered two provinces, and effected  all this within forty days after he came in sight of the enemy? Can those  who were not able to stand against him while they were uninjured, resist  him when they are ruined? Will you, who took part with Caesar while  victory was uncertain, take part with the conquered enemy when the fortune  of the war is decided, and when you ought to reap the reward of your  services? For they say that they have been deserted and betrayed by you, and  remind you of a former oath. But did you desert Lucius Domitius, or did  Lucius Domitius desert you? Did he not, when you were ready to submit to  the greatest difficulties, cast you off? Did he not, without your privacy,  endeavor to effect his own escape? When you were betrayed by him, were  you not preserved by Caesar's generosity? And how could he think you  bound by your oath to him, when, after having thrown up the ensigns of  power, and abdicated his government, he became a private person, and a  captive in another's power? A new obligation is left upon you, that you  should disregard the oath, by which you are at present bound; and have  respect only to that which was invalidated by the surrender of your general,  and his diminution of rank. But I suppose, although you are pleased with  Caesar, you are offended with me; however, I shall not boast of my services  to you, which still are inferior to my own wishes or your expectations. But,  however, soldiers have ever looked for the rewards of labor at the  conclusion of a war; and what the issue of it is likely to be, not even you can  doubt. But why should I omit to mention my own diligence and good  fortune, and to what a happy crisis affairs are now arrived? Are you sorry  that I transported the army safe and entire, without the loss of a single ship?  That on my arrival, in the very first attack, I routed the enemy's fleet? That  twice in two days I defeated the enemy's horse? That I carried out of the  very harbor and bay two hundred of the enemy's victualers, and reduced  them to that situation that they can receive no supplies either by land or sea?  Will you divorce yourselves from this fortune and these generals; and prefer  the disgrace of Corfinium, the defeat of Italy, the surrender of both Spains,  and the prestige of the African war? I, for my part, wished to be called a  soldier of Caesar's; you honored me with the title of Imperator. If you repent  your bounty, I give it back to you; restore to me my former name that you  may not appear to have conferred the honor on me as a reproach."

Each  was waiting till the enemy's forces should attempt to pass it, that they might  engage with the advantage of the ground. At the same time on the left wing,  the entire cavalry of Publius Attius, and several light-armed infantry  intermixed with them, were perceived descending into the valley. Against  them Curio detached his cavalry and two cohorts of the Marrucini, whose  first charge the enemy's horse were unable to stand, but, setting spurs to  their horses, fled back to their friends: the light-infantry being deserted by  those who had come out along with them, were surrounded and cut to pieces  by our men. Varus's whole army, facing that way, saw their men flee and cut  down. Upon which Rebilus, one of Caesar's lieutenants, whom Curio had  brought with him from Sicily knowing that he had great experience in  military matters, cried out, "You see the enemy are daunted, Curio! why do  you hesitate to take advantage of the opportunity?" Curio, having merely  "expressed this, that the soldiers should keep in mind the professions which  they had made to him the day before," then ordered them to follow him, and  ran far before them all. The valley was so difficult of assent that the  foremost men could not struggle up it unless assisted by those behind. But  the minds of Attius's soldiers being prepossessed with fear and the flight  and slaughter of their men, never thought of opposing us; and they all  imagined that they were already surrounded by our horse, and, therefore,  before a dart could be thrown, or our men come near them, Varus's whole  army turned their backs and retreated to their camp.

When Varus,  after been repeatedly called, stopped and looked at him, and inquired who  he was and what he wanted, he made a blow with his sword at his naked  shoulder and was very near killing Varus, but he escaped the danger by  raising his shield to ward off the blow. Fabius was surrounded by the  soldiers near him and cut to pieces; and by the multitude and crowds of  those that fled, the gates of the camps were thronged and the passage  stopped, and a greater number perished in that place without a stroke than in  the battle and flight. Nor were we far from driving them from this camp;  and some of them ran straightway to the town without halting. But both the  nature of the ground and the strength of the fortifications prevented our  access to the camp; for Curio's soldiers, marching out to battle, were  without those things which were requisite for storming a camp. Curio,  therefore, led his army back to the camp, with all his troops safe except  Fabius. Of the enemy about six hundred were killed and a thousand  wounded, all of whom, after Curio's return, and several more, under pretext  of their wounds, but in fact through fear, withdrew from the camp into the  town, which Varus perceiving and knowing the terror of his army, leaving a  trumpeter in his camp and a few tents for show, at the third watch led back  his army quietly into the town.

 Qua in fuga Fabius Pelignus quidam ex infimis ordinibus de exercitu Curionis primus agmen fugientium consecutus magna voce Varum nomine appellans requirebat, uti unus esse ex eius militibus et monere aliquid velle ac dicere videretur.  Ubi ille saepius appellatus aspexit ac restitit et, quis esset aut quid vellet, quaesivit, umerum apertum gladio appetit paulumque afuit, quin Varum interficeret; quod ille periculum sublato ad eius conatum scuto vitavit. Fabius a proximis militibus circumventus interficitur.  Hac fugientium multitudine ac turba portae castrorum occupantur atque iter impeditur, pluresque in eo loco sine vulnere quam in proelio aut fuga intereunt, neque multum afuit, quin etiam castris expellerentur, ac nonnulli protinus eodem cursu in oppidum contenderunt.  Sed cum loci natura et munitio castrorum aditum prohibebant, tum quod ad proelium egressi Curionis milites eis rebus indigebant, quae ad oppugnationem castrorum erant usui.  Itaque Curio exercitum in castra reducit suis omnibus praeter Fabium incolumibus, ex numero adversariorum circiter DC interfectis ac mille vulneratis; qui omnes discessu Curionis multique praeterea per simulationem vulnerum ex castris in oppidum propter timorem sese recipiunt.  Qua re animadversa Varus et terrore exercitus cognito bucinatore in castris et paucis ad speciem tabernaculis relictis de tertia vigilia silentio exercitum in oppidum reducit.

 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="civ_2_36">2:36</a></font></span>The next day Curio resolved to besiege Utica,  and to draw lines about it. In the town there was a multitude of people,  ignorant of war, owing to the length of the peace; some of them Uticans,  very well inclined to Caesar, for his favors to them; the Roman population  was composed of persons differing widely in their sentiments. The terror  occasioned by former battles was very great; and therefore, they openly  talked of surrendering, and argued with Attius that he should not suffer the  fortune of them all to be ruined by his obstinacy. While these things were in  agitation, couriers, who had been sent forward, arrived from king Juba, with  the intelligence that he was on his march, with considerable forces, and  encouraged them to protect and defend their city, a circumstance which  greatly comforted their desponding hearts.

Itaque de deditione omnes palam loquebantur et cum P. Attio agebant, ne sua pertinacia omnium fortunas perturbari vellet.

And at this time Caesar's success in  Spain was announced in Africa by messages and letters. Being elated by all  these things, he imagined that the king would not dare to attempt any thing  against him. But when he found out, from undoubted authority, that his  forces were less than twenty miles distant from Utica, abandoning his  works, he retired to the Cornelian camp. Here he began to lay in corn and  wood, and to fortify his camp, and immediately dispatched orders to Sicily,  that his two legions and the remainder of his cavalry should be sent to him.  His camp was well adapted for protracting a war, from the nature and  strength of the situation, from its proximity to the sea, and the abundance of  water and salt, of which a great quantity had been stored up from the  neighboring salt-pits. Timber could not fail him from the number of trees,  nor corn, with which the lands abounded. Wherefore, with the general  consent, Curio determined to wait for the rest of his forces, and protract the  war.

 Nuntiabantur haec eadem Curioni, sed aliquamdiu fides fieri non poterat: tantam habebat suarum rerum fiduciam. Iamque Caesaris in Hispania res secundae in Africam nuntiis ac litteris perferebantur. Quibus omnibus rebus sublatus nihil contra se regem nisurum existimabat. Sed ubi certis auctoribus comperit minus V et XX milibus longe ab Utica eius copias abesse, relictis munitionibus sese in castra Cornelia recepit. Huc frumentum comportare, castra munire, materiam conferre coepit statimque in Siciliam misit, uti duae legiones reliquusque equitatus ad se mitteretur.  Castra erant ad bellum ducendum aptissima natura loci et munitione et maris propinquitate et aquae et salis copia, cuius magna vis iam ex proximis erat salinis eo congesta. Non materia multitudine arborum, non frumentum, euius erant plenissimi agri, deficere poterat. Itaque omnium suorum consensu Curio reliquas copias exspectare et bellum ducere parabat.

Curio rashly believing this information, altered his design,  and resolved to hazard a battle. His youth, his spirits, his former good  fortune and confidence of success, contributed much to confirm this  resolution. Induced by these motives, early in the night he sent all his  cavalry to the enemy's camp near the river Bagrada, of which Sabura, of  whom we have already spoken, was the commander. But the king was  coming after them with all his forces, and was posted at a distance of six  miles behind Sabura. The horse that were sent perform their march that  night, and attack the enemy unawares and unexpectedly; for the Numidians,  after the usual barbarous custom, encamped here and there without any  regularity. The cavalry having attacked them, when sunk in sleep and  dispersed, killed a great number of them; many were frightened and ran  away. After which the horse returned to Curio, and brought some, prisoners  with them.

Having  advanced six miles, he met the horse, heard what had happened and  inquired from the captives who commanded the camp at Bagrada. They  replied Sabura. Through eagerness to perform his journey, he neglected to  make further inquiries, but looking back to the company next him, "Don't  you see, soldiers," says he, "that the answer of the prisoners corresponds  with the account of the deserters, that the king is not with him, and that he  sent only a small force which was not able to withstand a few horse? Hasten  then to spoil, to glory; that we may now begin to think of rewarding you,  and returning you thanks." The achievements of the horse were great in  themselves, especially if their small number be compared with the vast host  of Numidians. However, the account was enlarged by themselves, as men  are naturally inclined to boast of their own merit. Besides, many spoils were  produced; the men and horses that were taken were brought into their sight,  that they might imagine that every moment of time which intervened was a  delay to their conquest. By this means the hope of Curio were seconded by  the ardor of the soldiers. He ordered the horse to follow him, and hastened  his march, that he might attack them as soon as possible, while in  consternation after their flight. But the horse, fatigued by the expedition of  the preceding night, were not able to keep up with him, but fell behind in  different places. Even this did not abate Curio's hopes.

Reliqua studio itineris conficiendi quaerere praetermittit proximaque respiciens signa, "videtisne," inquit, "milites, captivorum orationem cum perfugis convenire? abesse regem, exiguas esse copias missas, quae paucis equitibus pares esse non potuerint? Proinde ad praedam, ad gloriam properate, ut iam de praemiis vestris et de referenda gratia cogitare incipiamus."

Haec tamen ab ipsis inflatius commemorabantur, ut de suis homines laudibus libenter praedicant. Multa praeterea spolia praeferebantur, capti homines equique producebantur, ut, quicquid intercederet temporis, hoc omne victoriam morari videretur. Ita spei Curionis militum studia non deerant.  Equites sequi iubet sese iterque accelerat, ut quam maxime ex fuga perterritos adoriri posset. At illi itinere totius noctis confecti subsequi non poterant, atque alii alio loco resistebant.

Sabura drew  up his army, both horse and foot, and commanded them to give way  gradually and retreat through the pretense of fear; that when it was  necessary he would give them the signal for battle, and such orders as he  found circumstances required. Curio, as his idea of their present behavior  was calculated to confirm his former hopes, imagined that the enemy were  running away, and led his army from the rising grounds down to the plain.

Sabura gave his men the signal, marshaled his army, and began to go around  his ranks and encourage them. But he made use of the foot only for show;  and sent the horse to the charge: Curio was not deficient in skill, and  encouraged his men to rest all their hopes in their valor. Neither were the  soldiers, though wearied, nor the horse, though few and exhausted with  fatigue, deficient in ardor to engage, and courage: but the latter were in  number but two hundred: the rest had dropped behind on the march.  Wherever they charged they forced the enemy to give ground, but they were  not able to pursue them far when they fled, or to press their horses too  severely. Besides, the enemy's cavalry began to surround us on both wings  and to trample down our rear. When any cohorts ran forward out of the line,  the Numidians, being fresh, by their speed avoided our charge, and  surrounded ours when they attempted to return to their post, and cut them  off from the main body. So that it did not appear safe either to keep their  ground and maintain their ranks, or to issue from the line, and run the risk.  The enemy's troops were frequently reinforced by assistance sent from Juba;  strength began to fail our men through fatigue; and those who had been  wounded could neither quit the field nor retire to a place of safety, because  the whole field was surrounded by the enemy's cavalry. Therefore,  despairing of their own safety, as men usually do in the last moment of their  lives, they either lamented their unhappy deaths, or recommended their  parents to the survivors, if fortune should save any from the impending  danger. All were full of fear and grief.

But a party  of horse, that had been sent by Sabura, had already got possession of them.  Now indeed our men were reduced to extreme despair: and some of them  were killed by the cavalry in attempting to escape: some fell to the ground  unhurt. Cneius Domitius, commander of the cavalry, standing round Curio  with a small party of horse, urged Curio to endeavor to escape by flight, and  to hasten to his camp; and assured him that he would not forsake him. But  Curio declared that he would never more appear in Caesar's sight, after  losing the army which had been committed by Caesar, to his charge, and  accordingly fought till he was killed. Very few of the horse escaped from  that battle, but those who had staid behind to refresh their horses having  perceived at a distance the defeat of the whole army, retired in safety to their  camp.

They beg and entreat to be transported to Sicily. He consented, and ordered  the masters of the ships to have all the boats brought close to the shore early  in the evening. But so great was the terror in general, that some said that  Juba's forces were marching up, others that Varus was hastening with his  legions, and that they already saw the dust raised by their coming; of which  not one circumstance had happened: others suspected that the enemy's fleet  would immediately be upon them. Therefore in the general consternation,  every man consulted his own safety. Those who were on board of the fleet,  were in a hurry to set sail, and their flight hastened the masters of the ships  of burden. A few small fishing boats attended their duty and his orders.
