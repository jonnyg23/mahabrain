 <p>SING, and sing again Io Pæan! The quarry that I was hot upon hath   fallen into my toils. Let the joyous lover set the laurel crown upon my brow   and raise me to a loftier pinnacle than Hesiod of Ascra or the blind old bard   of Mæonia. Thus did Priam's son, crowding on all sail in his flight   from warlike Amyclæ, bear with him his ravished bride; and thus, too,   Hippodamia, did Pelops, in his victorious chariot, carry thee far from thy   native land.</p>   
 <p>Young man, why wilt thou haste so fast? Thy vessel sails the open sea, and   the harbour to which I am steering thee is still far off. It sufficieth not   that my verses have brought thy mistress to thine arms; my art hath taught   thee how to win her; it must also teach thee how to keep her. Though it be   glorious to make. conquests, it is still more glorious to retain them. The   former is sometimes the work of chance, the latter is always the work of   skill.</p>   
 <p>Queen of Cythera, and thou her son, if ever ye looked with kindly eye upon   me, ’tis, above all, to-day that of your succour I have need. And thee   too, Erato, I invoke, for ’tis, from love thou dost derive thy name.   Great is the enterprise I have in mind. I am going to tell how Love, that   fickle child, may captured be; Love that is wandering up and down in this   wide world of ours. Airy is he, possessed of wings to fly withal. How shall   we stay his flight?</p>   
 <p>Minos had left no stone unturned to prevent the escape of his   stranger-guest. Yet he dared, with wings, to cleave himself a way. When   Dædalus had imprisoned</p>   
 <p><a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 126</font></a></p>   
 <p>the monster half-man, half-bull, that his erring mother had conceived, he   spoke to Minos saying, "O thou who art so just, set a term to my exile;   let my native land receive my ashes. If the Fates forbid that I should live   in my own country, grant at least that I may die there. Grant that my son may   return to his home, even if his father beseeches thee in vain. Or if thou   hast no pity for the child, let thy compassion light upon the father."   Thus spake Dædalus; but in vain he tried with these and many other   words like these, to touch the heart of Minos; inexorable, he was deaf to all   his prayers. Seeing his supplications were of no avail, he said to himself,   "Behold, here is indeed a chance for thee to prove thy ingenuity. Minos   rules the land, and rules the waves; ’tis useless then on sea or land   to seek escape. There remains the air; and through the air I'll cleave me a   way. Great Jove, pardon the rashness of my under taking. ’Tis not my   aim to raise myself to the skyish dwellings of the gods; but there is for me   one means, and one alone, whereby I may escape the tyrant. If there were a   way across the Styx, the Stygian waters I would not fear to cross. Grant me   then to change the laws that rule my nature."</p>   
 <p>Misfortune ofttimes stimulates invention. Who would ever have thought a   man could voyage through the air! Nevertheless, ’tis true that   Dædalus wrought himself wings with feathers cunningly disposed like   oars, and with thread did fix his flimsy work together. The lower part he bound   with wax melted by the fire. And now behold the strange and wondrous work is   finished! The boy, with a joyous smile, handles the feathers and the wax,   witting not that the wings are destined for his own shoulders.   "Behold," cried his father, "the craft that shall bear us to   our native land; by its means we shall escape from Minos. Though Minos may   have closed all roads to us, he cannot close the highways of the air. Cleave   then the air, while still thou mayest,</p>   
 <p><a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 127</font></a></p>   
 <p>with this my handiwork. But take heed thou draw not too nigh the Virgin of   Tegea, or to Orion, who, girt with his sword, doth bear Boötes company.   Shape thy course on mine. I will lead the way; be content to follow me; with   me to guide thee, thou wilt have nought to fear. For, if in our airy flight we   soared too near the sun, the wax of our wings would never bear the heat, and   if we flew too low, the moisture of the sea would weight our wings and make   them over-heavy for us to move. Fly then midway between; and O, my son,   beware the winds. Whithersoever they may blow, thither let them waft   thee." Thus he spake, and fitted the wings upon his son's young   shoulders and showed him how to move them, even as the mother bird teaches   her feeble fledglings how to fly. That done, he fixes wings on to his own shoulders   and, half eager, half timid, launches himself on the unfamiliar track. Ere he   begins his flight, he kisses his son, and down the old man's cheeks the tears   unbidden flow.</p>   
 <p>Not far from there, stands a hill, which, though less lofty than a   mountain, doth yet command the plain. It was from there that they launched   themselves on their perilous flight. Dædalus, as he moves his own   wings, gazes back at his son's, yet nevertheless keeps steadily on his airy   course. At first the novelty of their flight enchants them; and ere long,   casting all fear aside, Icarus grows more daring and essays a bolder sweet. A   fisherman, about to land a fish with his slender rod, perceives them, and   straightway lets it fall. Already they have left Samos behind on the left,   and Naxos, and Paros, and Delos dear to Apollo. On their right they have   Lebinthos, Calymna shaded with woods, and Astypalæa girdled with pools   where fish abound; when lo, young Icarus, growing rash with boyish daring,   steers a loftier course and leaves his father. The bonds of his wings relax,   the wax melts as the sun grows near, and vainly he waves his arms,</p>   
 <p><a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 128</font></a></p>   
 <p>they cannot catch the delicate air. Stricken with terror, he looks down   from the lofty heavens upon the sea beneath. A darkness born of panic overspreads   his eyes. And now the wax has melted, he tosses his naked arms and quakes   with fear, for nought is there to upstay him. Down and down he falls, and in   his falling cries, "Father, O Father, all is over with me!" And the   green waters sealed his mouth for ever. But the unhappy father--a father now   no longer--cried, "Icarus, where art thou? Beneath what regions of the   sky steerest thou thy flight? Icarus, Icarus," he cried and cried again,   when lo, on the waste of waters he descried his wings. The land received the   bones of Icarus; the sea retains his name.</p>   
 <p>Minos was powerless to stay a mortal's flight. I am essaying to hold a   winged god. If anyone deems there is any virtue in magic or in potions, he   sadly errs. Neither the herbs of Medea nor the incantations of the Marsi will   make love endure. If there were any potency in magic, Medea would have held   the son of Æson, Circe would have held Ulysses. Philtres, too, that   make the face grow pale, are useless when administered to women. They harm   the brain and bring on madness. Away with such criminal devices! If you'd be   loved, be worthy to be loved. Good looks and a good figure are not enough for   that. Though you were Nireus, praised long ago by Homer; ay, were you young   Hylas, snatched away by the guilty Naiads, if you would hold your mistress   and not one day to be taken aback and find she's left you, add   accomplishments of the mind to advantages of the person. Beauty is a fleeting   boon; it fades with the passing years, and the longer it lives, the more   surely it dies. The violets and wide-cupped lilies bloom not for ever, and,   once the rose has blown, its naked stem shows only thorns. Thus, my fair   youth, thy hair will soon grow white, and wrinkles soon will line thy face   with furrows; so set thy beauty off with</p>   
 <p><a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 129</font></a></p>   
 <p>talents that shall mock at time; ’tis they alone will last unto the   grave. Study the refinements of life, and enrich yourself with the treasures   of the Greek and Latin tongues. Ulysses was not handsome, but he was   eloquent, and two goddesses were tortured with love for him. How often   Calypso groaned when she beheld him preparing to depart, and how she kept   telling him that the waves would not suffer him to set sail. Times without   number she asked him to tell her o’er again the story of the fall of   Troy, times without number he would retell it in a new form. One day they   were standing on the seashore: the fair nymph was begging him to tell her how   the king of Thrace met his cruel death. Ulysses, with a twig which he chanced   to have in his hand, drew her a plan upon the sand. "See, here is   Troy," he said, tracing the line of the ramparts. "Here runs the   Simois. Say this is my camp, farther along is the plain" (and he drew   it) "which we stained with the blood of Dolon who tried to steal the   horses of Achilles by night. There stood the tents of Rhesus, king of Thrace,   and it was along there that I rode back with the horses that had been stolen   from him." And so he was going on with his narrative, when suddenly a   wave came and washed away Troy and Rhesus, together with his camp. Then said   the goddess, "Seest thou what famous names these waves have swept away,   and dost thou hope they will be kind to thee when thou settest sail?"</p>   
 <p>Well then, whoever you may be, put not too great a trust in the deceptive   charm of beauty. Take care to possess something more than mere physical   comeliness. What works wonders with the women is an ingratiating manner.   Brusqueness and harsh words only promote dislike. We hate the hawk because it   spends its life in fighting; and we hate the wolf that falls upon the timid   flocks. But man snares not the swallow because it is gentle, and he suffers   the dove to make its home in</p>   
 <p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130</font></a></p>   
 <p>towers that he has built. Away with all strife and bitterness of speech.   Pleasant words are the food of love. It is by quarrels that a woman estranges   her husband, and a husband his wife. They imagine that in acting so they are   paying each other out in their own coin. Leave them to it. Quarrels are the   dowry which married folk bring one another. But a mistress should only hear   agreeable things. It is not the law that has landed you in bed together. <i>Your</i>   law, the law for you and her, is Love. Never approach her but with soft   caresses and words that soothe her ear, so that she may always rejoice at   your coming.</p>   
 <p>’Tis is not to the rich that I would teach the art of Love. A man   who can give presents has no need of any lessons I can teach him. He has wit   enough, and to spare, if he can say when he pleases, "Accept this   gift." I give him best. His means are mightier than mine. I am the poor   man's poet; because I am poor myself and I have known what it is to be in   love. Not being able to pay them in presents, I pay my mistresses in poetry.   The poor man must be circumspect in his love-affairs; he mustn't permit   himself to use strong language; he must put up with many things that a rich   lover would never endure. Once I remember in a fit of ill-temper I ruffled my   mistress's hair. It was a fit that robbed me of many and many a happy day. I   did not notice that I had torn her dress, and I do not believe I had; but she   said I had, and I was obliged to buy her another one. Good friends, be wiser   than your master; don't do as he does, or, if you do, look out for squalls.   Make war on the Parthians to your heart's content, but live at peace with   your mistress; have recourse to playfulness and to whatever may excite love.</p>   
 <p>If your mistress is ungracious and off-hand in her manner towards you,   bear it with patience; she'll soon come round. If you bend a branch carefully   and gently, it won't break. If you tug at it suddenly with all your</p>   
 <p><a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 131</font></a></p>   
 <p>might, you'll snap it off. If you let yourself go with the stream, you'll   get across the river in time, but if you try to swim against the tide, you'll   never do it. Patience will soften tigers and Numidian lions; and slowly and   surely you may accustom the bull to the rustic plough. What woman was ever   more tameless than Atalanta of Nonacris; yet, for all her arrogance, she   yielded at length to a lover's tender assiduities. They say that many a time,   beneath the trees, Milanion wept at his mishaps and at his mistress's   unkindness. Often upon his neck he bore, as he was bid, the treacherous   toils; and often with his spear he pierced the savage boars. He was even   struck by the arrows of Hylæus, but other darts, which were, alas, but   too well known to him, had dealt him sorer wounds than that.</p>   
 <p>I do not bid thee climb, armed with thy bow, the woody heights of   Mænalus, or carry heavy nets upon thy back. I do not bid thee bare thy   breast to a foeman's arrows. If only thou art prudent, thou wilt find my   precepts are not over-hard to carry out. If she's obstinate, let her have her   way, and you'll get the better of her in the end. Only whatever she tells you   to do, be sure you do it. Blame what she blames; like what she likes; say   what she says; deny what she denies. If she smiles, smile too; if she sheds   tears, shed them too. In a word, model your mood on hers. If she wants to   play draughts, play badly on purpose and let her win the game. If you're   playing dice, don't let her be piqued at losing, but make it look as though   your luck was always out. If your battle-field's the chessboard, see to it   that your men of glass are mown down by the foe.</p>   
 <p>Be sure and hold her parasol over her; and clear a way for her if she's   hemmed in by the crowd; fetch a stool to help her on to the couch; and unlace   or lace up the sandals on her dainty feet. And then, though you perish with   cold yourself, you will often have to</p>   
 <p><a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 132</font></a></p>   
 <p>warm your mistress's icy hands in your bosom. And you mustn't mind,   although it does seem a little undignified, holding up her mirror, like any   slave, for her to look in. Why Hercules himself, who performed such mighty   feats of bravery and strength, who won a seat in the Olympian realms he had   carried on his shoulders, is said to have dwelt among the Ionian maids as one   of them, to have held the work-basket and have spun coarse wool. The   Tirynthian hero obeyed his mistress's commands; and will you hesitate to   endure what he endured?</p>   
 <p>If your lady-love arranges to meet you in the Forum, be there well before   the appointed time, and wait and wait till the very last minute. If she asks   you to meet her somewhere else, leave everything and hurry off; don't let the   crowd hinder you. If, at night, after she's been dining out, she calls a   slave to see her home, be quick, offer your services. If you are in the   country, and she writes saying, " Come at once," go to her, for   Love brooks no delay. If you can't get a conveyance, then you must foot it.   Nothing should stop you: thunder, heat, snow, nothing!</p>   
 <p>Love is like warfare. "Faint heart never won fair lady";   poltroons are useless in Love's service. The night, winter, long marches,   cruel suffering, painful toil, all these things have to be borne by those who   fight in Love's campaigns. Apollo, when he tended the herds of Admetus,   dwelt, so ’tis said, in a humble cottage. Who would blush to do as   Apollo did? If you would love long and well, you must put away pride. If the   ordinary, safe route to your mistress is denied you, if her door is shut   against you, climb up on to the roof and let yourself down by the chimney, or   the skylight. How it will please her to know the risks you've run for her   sake! 'Twill be an earnest of your love. Leander could often have done   without his mistress, but he swam the strait to prove his courage.</p>   
 <p><a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 133</font></a></p>   
 <p>Nor must you think it beneath your dignity to ingratiate yourself with her   servants, even the humblest of them; greet each of them by name, and take   their servile hands in yours. Give them (it will not cost you much) such   presents as you can afford; and when the festival of Juno Caprotina comes   round, make a handsome present to the lady's-maid. Get on good terms with the   occupants of the servants' hall, and don't forget the porter or the slave   that sleeps beside your lady's door.</p>   
 <p>I don't advise you to make costly presents to your mistress; offer her a   few trifles, but let them be well chosen and appropriate to the occasion.   When the country is displaying all its lavish riches, and the branches of the   trees are bending beneath their load, set some young slave to leave a basket   of fruit at her door. You can say they come from your place in the country,   though in reality you purchased them in Rome. Send her grapes or chestnuts   beloved of Amaryllis; though the modern Amaryllis is no longer satisfied with   chestnuts. Or, again, a present of thrushes or pigeons will prove that you   have her still in mind. I know, of course, that this same policy is followed   by the expectant legatees of some rich and childless dame. Out on such mean   and calculating generosity, say I! Shall I also advise you to send poetry as   well? Alas, verses don't count for much. Verses come in for praise; but they   really like gifts that are more substantial than that. Even a barbarian, if   only he is rich, is sure to find favour. This is the golden age in very   truth. Gold will buy the highest honours; and gold will purchase love. Homer   himself, even if he came attended by the nine Muses, would promptly be shown   the door if he brought no money to recommend him. Nevertheless, there are   some cultured women, but they are rare. There are others who are not cultured   but who wish to appear so. You must praise them both in your poetry. Whatever</p>   
 <p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 134</font></a></p>   
 <p>the quality of your lines, you may make them sound well if you know how to   read them with effect. Indeed, if the lines be well composed and well   delivered, the ladies will perhaps deign to regard them as a trifling, a very   trifling, present.</p>   
 <p>Now, when you have determined to do something that you think will be of   service, persuade your mistress to ask you to do it. If you have made up your   mind to free one of your slaves, see that he addresses his petition to her;   if you've resolved not to punish another slave for some neglect of duty, see   that it is she who gets the credit for this act of clemency. You'll get the   benefit, she'll get the glory. You'll lose nothing, and she'll think she can   twist you round her little finger.</p>   
 <p>If you want to keep your mistress's love, you must make her think you're   dazzled with her charms. If she wears a dress of Tyrian purple, tell her   there's nothing like Tyrian purple. If she's wearing a gown of Coan stuff,   tell her that there's nothing becomes her so enchantingly. If she's ablaze   with gold, tell her that you think gold's less brilliant than her charms. If   she's clad in winter furs, tell her they're lovely; if she appears in a   flimsy tunic, tell her she sets you on fire, and say you hope she won't catch   cold. If she wears her hair parted on her forehead, say you like that style.   If she has it frizzed and fuzzy, say, "How I love it frizzed!"   Praise her arms when she dances, her voice when she sings, and when she   ceases, say how sorry you are it came to an end so soon. If she admits you to   her bed, adore the seat of all your bliss, and in tones trembling with   delight tell her what a heaven she makes for you. Why, even if she were   grimmer than the terrible Medusa, she would grow soft and docile for her   love. Be a good dissembler and never let your face belie your words. Artifice   is a fine thing when it's not perceived; once it's discovered, discomfiture   follows. Confidence is gone for ever.</p>

 <p>Often when the autumn is at hand, when the earth is adorned with all its   charms, when the ruddy grape swells with its purple juice, when we feel   alternately a nipping cold or an oppressive heat, this variation of   temperature throws us into a state of languor. May your mistress then retain   her health. But if some indisposition should compel her to keep her bed, if   she falls a victim to the evil effects of the season, then is the time for   you to show her how attentive and loving you can be; then is the time to sow   the seeds of the harvest you may gather later on. Be not deterred by the   attentions her malady demands. Render her whatever services she will deign to   accept; let her behold you shedding tears of compassion; never let her see   you do not want to kiss her, and let her parched lips be moistened with your   tears; say how you hope she'll soon be well again, and be sure to let her   hear you saying it, and always be prepared to tell her you have had a dream   of happy augury. Let some old grandam, with trembling hands, come and sweeten   her bed and purify her room with sulphur and the expiatory eggs. She will   store up the memory of these kindnesses in her heart. Many a time have people   had legacies bequeathed them for such trifling things as that. But be careful   not to display too much anxiety. Do not be over-busy. Your affection and   solicitude should have their limits. Don't make it your business to restrict   her diet, or tell her she mustn't eat this or that. Don't bring her nasty   medicine to drink; leave all that to your rival.</p>   
 <p>But the wind to which you spread your sails when leaving port is not the   wind you need when you are sailing the open sea. Love is delicate at birth;   it becomes stronger with use. Feed it with the proper food, and it will grow   sturdy in time. The bull that frightens you to-day, you used to stroke when it   was young. The tree that shelters you beneath its shade was once but a frail   sapling. A slender rivulet at its</p>   
 <p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a></p>   
 <p>source, the river gathers size little by little, and, as it flows, is swollen   with innumerable tributaries. See to it that thy mistress grows accustomed to   thee: nothing is so potent as habit. To win her heart, let no trouble be too   great. Let her see you continually; let her hear none but you. Day and night   be present to her sight. But when you are sure that she will long for you,   then leave her alone, so that your absence may give her some anxiety. Let her   repose awhile: the soil that is given a rest renders with usury the seed   that's planted in it, and the ground that is parched greedily soaks in the   water from the skies. As long as Phyllis had Demophoön at her side, her   love for him was lukewarm. No sooner had he set sail, than she was consumed   with passion for him. Ulysses, shrewd man, tortured Penelope by his absence,   and with thy tears, Laodamia, didst thou yearn for the return of Protesilaus.</p>   
 <p>But be on the safe side; don't stay away too long; time softens the pangs   of longing. Out of sight, out of mind. The absent lover is soon forgotten,   and another takes his place. When Menelaus had departed, Helen grew weary of   her lonely couch and sought warmth and consolation in the arms of her guest.   Ah! Menelaus, what a fool wast thou! Alone didst thou depart, leaving thy   wife beneath the same roof with a stranger. Fool, ’twas like delivering   up the timid dove to the devouring kite, or surrendering the lamb to the   hungry wolf. No, Helen was not to blame; her lover was not guilty; she was   afraid to lie alone. Let Menelaus think what he will; Helen, in my view, was   not to blame; all she did was to profit by her most accommodating husband.</p>   
 <p>But the fierce boar, in its wildest rage, when, making his last stand, he   rolls the fleet hounds over and over; the lioness, when she offers her dugs   to the cubs that she is suckling; the viper that the wayfarer has trodden   upon with careless foot--all are less redoubtable than</p>   
 <p><a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a></p>   
 <p>the woman who has caught another woman in her husband's bed. Her face is   distorted with fury. The sword, the firebrand, anything that comes to her   hand, she will seize. Casting all restraint aside, she will rush at her foe   like a Mænad driven mad by the Aonian god. The barbarous Medea took   vengeance on her own children for Jason's misdeeds and for his violation of   the nuptial bond; that swallow that you see yonder was also an unnatural   mother. See, her breast still bears the stain of blood. Thus do the happiest,   the most firmly welded, unions fail. A cautious lover should beware of   exciting these jealous furies.</p>   
 <p>Do not imagine that I am going to act the rigid moralist and condemn you   to love but one mistress. The gods forbid. Even a married woman finds it   difficult to keep such a vow as that. Take your fill of amusement, but cast   the veil of modesty over your peccadilloes. Never make a parade of your good   fortune, and never give a woman a present that another woman will recognise.   Vary the time and place of your assignations, lest one of them catch you in   some familiar place of rendezvous. When you write, be sure and read over what   you have written; many women read into a letter much more than it is intended   to convey.</p>   
 <p>Venus, when she is wounded, justly retaliates, gives the aggressor blow   for blow and makes him feel, in his turn, the pain that he has caused. So   long as Atrides was satisfied with his wife, she was faithful to him; her   husband's infidelity drove her from the narrow path. She learned that   Chryses, staff in hand and wearing the sacred fillet on his brows, had begged   that his daughter should be restored to him, and begged in vain. She learned,   O Briseis, of the abduction that pierced your heart with grief, and for what   shameful reasons the war was dragging on. Still all this was only hearsay.   But with her own eyes she had seen the daughter of Priam, she had, O sight of   shame, seen the victor become the</p>

 <p>slave of his captive. From that day forth, the daughter of Tyndarus made   Ægisthus free of her heart and bed, and took guilty vengeance for her   husband's crime. Yet if, how well soever you may hide them, your secret   amours come to light, never hesitate to deny your guilt. Be neither sheepish   nor gushing, for these are sure signs of a guilty conscience. But spare no   effort and employ all your vigour in the battle of love. It's the only way to   win peace; the only way to convince her of the unreality of her suspicions.   Some people would advise you to stimulate your powers with noxious herbs,   such as savory, pepper mixed with thistle-seed or yellow fever-few steeped in   old wine. In my view these are nothing more nor less than poisons. The   goddess, who dwells on the shady slopes of Mount Eryx, approves not such   strained and violent means to the enjoyment of her pleasures. Nevertheless,   you may take the white onion that comes from Megara and the stimulating plant   that grows in our gardens, together with eggs, honey from Hymettus, and the   apples of the lofty pine.</p>   
 <p>But wherefore, divine Erato, do we wander into these details of the   Æsculapian art? Let my chariot return to its own particular track.   Awhile ago I was counselling you to hide your infidelities: well, turn about,   blazon abroad the conquests you have made. The curved ship is not always   obedient to the same wind; she fleets o’er the waves, driven now by the   North wind, now by the East. Turn by turn, the West wind and the South will   fill her sails. Look at that driver on his chariot there. Sometimes he lets   his reins hang loose, sometimes, with skilful hand, he restrains the ardour   of his fiery steeds. There are lovers whom a hesitant indulgence   ill-befriends. Their mistresses begin to languish if the apprehension of a   rival comes not to stimulate their affections. Happiness will sometimes make   us drunk and render difficult the way of constancy. A little fire will   languish if it be not fed, and disappear</p>

 <p>beneath the grey ashes that accumulate upon it. But add a little sulphur,   and lo, fresh flames will leap and sparkle with new splendour! Thus when the   heart grows dull and torpid, apply, if you would wake it into life, the spur   of jealousy. Give your mistress something to torment her, and bring new heat   into her chilly heart. Let her grow pale at the evidence of your inconstancy.   What happiness, what untold happiness is his, whose mistress's heart is wrung   at the thought of her lover's infidelity. Soon she hears the tidings of his   fault; while yet she is fain to hold the news untrue, she swoons and, hapless   one, her cheeks grow pale as death, her lips refuse to speak. Oh, would I   were that lover! I, whose hair she tears in her wild frenzy, whose face she   fiercely scratches with her nails, at whose sight she bursts into floods of   tears, but whom she will not, cannot live without! How long, you say, ought   one to leave her in despair? Well, hasten to comfort her lest her wrath in   the end should harden into bitterness. Hasten to fling thine arms about her   snowy neck, and press her tear-stained cheek against thy breast. Kiss away   her tears, and with her tears mingle the sweet delights of love. Soon she'll   grow calm; that is the only way to soothe her wrath. When her rage is at its   height, when it is open war between you, then beg her to ratify a peace upon   her bed; she'll soon make friends. ’Tis there that, all unarmed, sweet   concord dwells; ’tis there, the cradle of forgiveness. The doves that   late were fighting, more tenderly will bill and coo; their murmurs seem to   tell how true and tender is their love.</p>   
 <p>Nature, at first, was but a weltering chaos of sky and land and sea. But   soon the heavens rose up above the earth, the sea encircled it with a liquid   girdle; and from formless chaos issued forth the divers elements. The woods   were peopled with wild things, the air with light-wingèd birds; and   the fishes hid themselves beneath the deep waters. In those times men   wandered lonely over</p>   
 <p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a></p>   
 <p>the face of the earth, and brute strength was their sole resource. The   forest was their dwelling-place, the grass their food, dry leaves their bed,   and for a long time each man dwelt in ignorance of his fellows. Then came the   sweet delights of love, and softened, so they say, these rugged hearts,   bringing together man and woman on a single couch. No tutor did they need to   tell them what to do; Venus, without recourse to any art, fulfilled her   gentle office. The bird has his beloved mate; the fish beneath the waters   finds another fish to share his pleasures; the hind follows the stag; the   snake mates with the snake; the dog with the bitch; the ewe and the heifer   yield themselves with delight to the caresses of the ram and the bull; the   goat, noisome though he be, repels not the caresses of his lascivious fellow;   the mare, burning with the frenzy of desire, will speed o’er hill and   dale, and even through rivers, to join her stallion. Be of good cheer then   and employ this potent remedy to calm the anger of thy mistress; ’tis   the only sovran cure for her aching sorrow; ’tis a balm sweeter than   the juices of Machaon, and if you happen to have erred a little, it will   surely bring you pardon.</p>   
 <p>Such was the burden of my song, when on a sudden Apollo appeared to me and   touched with his fingers the chords of a golden lyre; in his hand he bore a branch   of laurel; a laurel wreath encircled his brow. Prophetic was his mien and   prophetic the voice with which he bade me lead my disciples into his temple.   "There," said he," you will find this inscription famous   throughout the whole world, 'Man, know thyself.' The man who knows himself   follows ever in his love-affairs the precepts of wisdom. He alone hath wit to   adapt his enterprises to his powers. If he is endowed with comely looks, if   he has a beautiful skin, let him lie, when he is in bed, with his shoulders   uncovered; if he is an attractive talker, let him not maintain a glum   silence. If he can sing, let him sing; if the wine makes him merry, let him</p>   
 <p><a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 141</font></a></p>   
 <p>drink. But whatever he is, orator, babbler, or fine frenzied poet, don't   let him interrupt the conversation in order to declaim his prose or his   verse." Thus spake Phœbus, and, lovers, you will do well to obey   him; nought but the truth ever issued from his god-like lips.</p>   
 <p>But, to my subject. Whosoever loves wisely and follows the precepts of my   art is sure to conquer and to attain the object of his heart's desire. The   furrows do not always repay with interest the seed that has been sown   therein; the winds do not always waft the bark - on its uncertain course. Few   pleasures, many pains--such is the lot of lovers. Harsh are the trials which   they must expect to face. As numerous as the hares on Athos, as the bees on   Hybla, as the olives on the tree of Pallas, as the shells upon the seashore,   are the sorrows that Love engenders. The arrows he aims at us are steeped in   gall. Perhaps they will tell you that your mistress is out, when you know   very well she's in, because you've seen her. Never mind, make believe she is   out and that your eyes have deceived you. She has promised to let you in at   night, and you find her door shut; be patient and lie down on the cold damp   ground. Peradventure, some lying servant will come, .and looking at you with   an insolent stare, say, "What does this fellow want, always besieging   our door like this? " Then you must turn the other cheek to this grim   seneschal and speak him fair, and not him only, but the door as well, and on   the threshold lay the roses that adorned your brow. If your mistress gives   you, leave, haste to her side; if she will none of you, withdraw. A well-bred   man ought never to make himself a burden. Would you compel her to exclaim,   "Is there no way of getting rid of this pestilent fellow?" Women   often take unreasonable whims into their head. Never mind; put up with all   her insults; never mind if she kicks you even; kiss her dainty feet.</p>   
 <p><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 142</font></a></p>   
 <p>But why linger over such minor details? Let us turn to more important   themes. I am going to sing of lofty things. Ye lovers all, lend me yours   ears. My enterprise is fraught with danger; but without danger, where would   courage be? The object I aim at is not easy of attainment. If you have a   rival, put up with him without a murmur, and your triumph is assured. You   will mount, a conqueror, to Jove's high temple. Believe me, these are not the   words of a mere mortal. They are oracles as sure as any that Dodona ever   gave. This is the very climax of the art that I impart. if your mistress   exchanges meaning glances with your rival--nods and becks and wreathèd   smiles--put up with it. If she writes him letters, never scrutinise her tablets;   let her come and go as she pleases. Hosts of husbands show this indulgence to   their lawful wives, especially when thou, soft slumber, aidest in the deceit.   Nevertheless, I confess that, in my own case, I cannot attain this degree of   perfection. What am I to do? I cannot rise to the height of my own precepts.   If I saw a rival making signs to my mistress before my very eyes, do you   think I should put up with it, and not give free rein to my wrath? I remember   one day her husband kissed her. How I raved and swore about it! Love is made   up of these unreasonable demands. This shortcoming has often been my undoing   where women are concerned. It is much cleverer of a man to let others have   the entree to his mistress. The really proper course is not to know anything   about it. Suffer her to hide her infidelities, lest forcing her to confess   them should teach her to control her blushes. Ye youthful lovers, then, take   heed not to catch your mistresses in the act, lest, while deceiving you they   should imagine you were taken in by,: their fine speeches. Two lovers, who   have been found. out, do but love each other the more ardently. When, they   share a common lot, they both persist in the conduct that brought about their   undoing.</p>   
 <p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a></p>   
 <p>There is a story well known throughout Olympus: ’tis the story of   Mars and Venus caught in the act by Vulcan's cunning ruses. Mars, having   fallen madly in love with Venus, changed from the grim warrior to the   submissive lover. Venus (and never was there a goddess with a heart more tender),   Venus showed herself neither awkward nor unfeeling. How many and many a time,   they say, the wanton woman laughed at her husband's shambling gait, and at   his hands made horny by the heat of the forge and by hard toil. How charming   Mars thought her when she imitated the old blacksmith, and how her graceful   motions set off her loveliness. To begin with they took the utmost care to   conceal their intrigue, and their guilty passion was full of modesty and   reserve. But the Sun (nothing ever eludes his glance), the Sun revealed to   Vulcan the conduct of his spouse. Ah, Old Sol, what a bad example you set!   Demand the favours of the goddess; make her acquiescence the price of your   silence; she has the wherewithal to pay you. All around and about his bed   Vulcan cunningly stretches a network invisible to every eye. Then he pretends   to set out for Lemnos. The two lovers hie them to the familiar spot, and both   of them, naked as Cupid himself, are enveloped in the traitorous toils. Then   Vulcan calls on the gods to gather round and bids them gaze upon the   imprisoned lovers. Venus, so ’tis said, could scarce keep from.   weeping. They could not hide their faces in their hands, nor cover their   nakedness. One of the onlookers thus spoke jeeringly to Mars: "Valiant   Mars," quoth he, if thy chains are too heavy for thee, hand them on to   me." At length, yielding to the prayers of Neptune, Vulcan set the two   captives free. Mars withdrew to Thrace; Venus to Paphos. Say now, Vulcan,   what didst thou gain thereby? Erstwhile they hid their loves; now they freely   and openly indulge their passion; they have banished all shame. You'll soon   be sorry that you were such a</p>   
 <p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 144</font></a></p>   
 <p>prying fool! Indeed they say that even now you regret that you ever gave   way to your anger.</p>   
 <p>No traps! I forbid you to use them; and Venus herself, who was caught by   her spouse, forbids you to make use of tricks, whereof she was the victim.   Don't go laying snares for your rival. Don't try and intercept love-letters.   Leave such devices, if they think it well to employ them, to lawful husbands   whose rights are hallowed by sacred fire and water. As for me, I proclaim it   yet again, I only sing of pleasures which the law permits.</p>   
 <p>Who would dare divulge to the profane the mysteries of Ceres and the pious   rites instituted in Samothrace? It redounds but little to our credit to keep   silence when we are commanded so to do; but to blurt out things we ought to   know should be kept secret is a most grievous thing. Rightly was Tantalus   punished for his indiscretion, rightly was he debarred from reaching the   fruits that hung above his head; it served him right that he should parch   with thirst with water all around him. Cytherea, especially, forbids that her   mysteries should be revealed. I give thee warning, no babbling knaves should   ever draw near her altars. If the sacred emblems of her worship are not   concealed in mystic baskets; if no brazen cymbals are beaten at her   festivals; if she opens the doors of her temple to all, it is on condition   that none shall divulge her mysteries. Venus herself never putteth off her   veil, but with modest hand she covereth her charms. The beasts of the field   abandon themselves, in any place and in the sight of all, to the delights of   love, and often at the spectacle a young girl will turn away her head; but   for our loves we must have a secret bower, closed doors, and we must needs   cover with vesture the secret places of our body. Even if we seek not for   darkness, we like a certain dimness, at all events something a little less   than broad. daylight. Thus when men and women still went unprotected</p>

 <p>against the sun and the rain, when the oak provided them with food and   shelter, ’twas not in the open, but in caves and woods, that they   enjoyed the sweet pleasures of love, so great was the respect which mankind,   though still uncouth, entertained for the laws of modesty. Now we make a   parade of our nocturnal exploits, and people it seems, would pay a high price   for the pleasure of divulging them. Nay, isn't it the fashion nowadays to   stop and talk to a girl everywhere one goes, so as to be able to say,   "You saw that girl, she's another one I've had!" It's all because   they want to have someone to point at; so that every woman who is the object   of these attentions becomes the talk of the town. But there's nothing really   in it. There are men who invent stories which, if they were true, they would   repudiate. To hear them talk, you would think that no woman ever resisted   them. If they can't touch their person, they at least attack their good name,   and though their body be chaste, their reputation is tarnished. Go, thou   hateful warder, and shut the doors upon thy mistress; bolt her in with a hundred   bolts. What avail such precautions against the slanderer who brags with lying   tongue of the favours he has failed to obtain? Let us, on the other hand,   speak sparingly of our real amours, and hide our secret pleasures beneath an   impenetrable veil.</p>   
 <p>Never speak to a woman about her defects; many a lover has had occasion to   congratulate himself on having observed this very profitable reticence. The   wingèd-footed hero, Perseus, never found fault with Andromeda for her   swarthy skin. Andromache was, in everyone's opinion, far too tall; Hector was   the only one who considered her of the average height. Accustom yourself to   the things you don't like; you'll learn to put up with them; habit makes a   lot of things acceptable. At first, Love will be put off by the merest   trifle. A freshly-grafted branch that is just beginning to draw the sap</p>   
 <p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 146</font></a></p>   
 <p>from the green bark will fall off if the slightest breath of wind disturbs   it; but if you give it time to grow strong, it will soon resist the winds   and, developing into a sturdy branch, enrich the tree that bears it with its   alien fruit. Time effaces everything, even bodily defects, and what we once   looked upon as blemishes will one day cease to seem so. At first, our   nostrils cannot bear the smell of the hides of bulls; they grow used to it in   time and bear it without distress.</p>   
 <p>Moreover, there are words you can employ to palliate defects. If a woman's   skin is blacker than Illyrian pitch, tell her she's a brunette. If she   squints a little, tell her she's like Venus. If she's carroty, tell her she's   like Minerva. If she's so skinny you would think she was at death's door,   tell her she has a graceful figure. If she's short, so much the better, she's   all the lighter. If she's thick-waisted, why she's just agreeably plump. Similarly,   you must disguise every defect under the name of its nearest quality. Never   ask her how old she is, or who was consul when she was born. Leave it to the   Censor to perform that uncomfortable duty, especially if she has passed the   flower of her youth, if the summer of her days is over, and if she is already   compelled to pull out her grey hairs. My young friends, that age, and even an   older one than that, is not without its pleasures. It is a field that you   should sow and one day You will reap your harvest. Labour while your strength   and your youth allow. All too soon tottering eld, with noiseless tread, will   be upon you. Cleave the waters of the ocean with your oar, or the glebe with   your slough; wield with warlike arm the deadly sword, or devote to women your   vigour and your care. ’Tis but another kind of military service, and in   it, too, rich trophies may be won.</p>   
 <p>Nor should it be forgotten that women, who are getting on in years, have   experience, and it is only experience that sets the seal of perfection on our   natural</p>   
 <p><a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 147</font></a></p>   
 <p>gifts. They repair by their toilet the ravages of time, and by the care   they take of themselves manage to conceal their age. They know all the   different attitudes of Love and will assume them at your pleasure. No   pictured representation can rival them in voluptuousness. With them pleasure   comes naturally, without provocation, the pleasure which is sweeter than all,   the pleasure which is shared equally by the man and the woman. I hate those   embraces in which both do not consummate; that is why boys please me but   little. I hate a woman who offers herself because she ought to do so, and,   cold and dry, thinks of her sewing when she's making love. The pleasure that   is granted to me from a sense of duty ceases to be a pleasure at all. I won't   have any woman doing her duty towards me. How sweet it is to hear her voice   quaver as she tells me the joy she feels, and to hear her imploring me to   slacken my speed so as to prolong her bliss. How I love to see her, drunk   with delight, gazing with swooning eyes upon me, or, languishing with love,   keeping me a long while at arms' length.</p>   
 <p>But these accomplishments are not vouchsafed by nature to young girls.   They are reserved for women who have passed the age of thirty-five. Let who   will hasten to drink new and immature wine. Let me have a rich mellow vintage   dating back to one of our elder consuls. It is only after many years that the   plane tree affords a shelter from the scorching sun, and fields but newly   reaped hurt the naked foot. What! do you mean to tell me you would put   Hermione before Helen? And would Althaea's daughter outrival her mother? If   you would enjoy the fruits of love in their maturity, you will obtain, if   only you persevere, a reward worthy of your desires.</p>   
 <p>But already the bed, the minister of their pleasures, has received our two   lovers. Stay thy steps, my Muse, at the closed door. They will know well   enough, without</p>   
 <p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 148</font></a></p>   
 <p>thy aid, what words to say to one another, and their hands within the bed   will not be idle. Their fingers will find the way to those secret places in   which Love is wont to proclaim his presence. ’Twas even thus that the   valiant Hector, whose skill was not confined to battle, bore himself with   Andromache. Thus too the great Achilles fondled his fair captive when, weary   of fighting, he lay beside her on the downy couch. Thou didst not fear,   Briseis, to yield thyself to the caresses of those hands that bore upon them   still the stains of Trojan blood. Was there aught to compare, voluptuous   girl, with the pleasure of feeling the pressure of those victorious hands?</p>   
 <p>If you listen to my advice, you will not be in too great a hurry to attain   the limits of your pleasure. Learn, by skilful dallying, to reach the goal by   gentle, pleasant stages. When you have found the sanctuary of bliss, let no   foolish modesty arrest your hand. Then will you see the love-light trembling   in her eyes, even as the rays of the sun sparkle on the dancing waves. Then   will follow gentle moanings mingled with murmurings of love, soft groans and   sighs and whispered words that sting and lash desire. But now beware! Take   heed lest, cramming on too much sail, you speed too swiftly for your   mistress. Nor should you suffer her to outstrip you. Speed on together   towards the promised haven. The height of bliss is reached when, unable any   longer to withstand the wave of pleasure, lover and mistress at one and the   same moment are overcome. Such should be thy rule when time is yours and fear   does not compel you to hasten your stolen pleasures. Nevertheless, if there   be danger in delay, lean well forward, and drive your spur deep into your   courser's side.</p>   
 <p>My task draws toward its end. Young lovers, show your gratitude. Give me   the palm and wreathe my brow with the fragrant myrtle. As Podalirius was   famous among the Greeks for his skill in curing disease,</p>   
 <p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a></p>

Lovers, laud   your Poet, sing my praises, so that my name may resound throughout the world.   I have given you arms. Vulcan gave arms to Achilles. With them he was   victorious. Learn ye too to conquer with mine. And let every lover, who shall   have triumphed over a doughty Amazon with the sword I gave him, inscribe on   his trophies, "Ovid was my Master."</p>

cum quo sua gaudia iungat, <br>       inuenit in media femina piscis aqua; <br>   cerua parem sequitur, serpens serpente tenetur;<br>       haeret adulterio cum cane nexa canis; <br>   laeta salitur ouis: tauro quoque laeta iuuenca est;<br>       sustinet inmundum sima capella marem.<br>   in furias agitantur equae, spatioque remota <br>       per loca diuiduos amne sequuntur equos. <br>   ergo age et iratae medicamina fortia praebe;<br>       illa feri requiem sola doloris habent,<br>   illa Machaonios superant medicamina sucos;<br>       his, ubi peccaris, restituendus eris. <br>   haec ego cum canerem, subito manifestus Apollo <br>       mouit inauratae pollice fila lyrae.<br>   in manibus laurus, sacris inducta capillis <br>       laurus erat; uates ille uidendus adit. <br>   is mihi 'lasciui' dixit 'praeceptor Amoris, <br>       duc, age, discipulos ad mea templa tuos, <br>   est ubi diuersum fama celebrata per orbem <br>       littera, cognosci quae sibi quemque iubet.<br>   qui sibi notus erit, solus sapienter amabit, <br>       atque opus ad uires exiget omne suas. <br>   cui faciem natura dedit, spectetur ab illa;<br>       cui color est, umero saepe patente cubet;<br>   qui sermone placet, taciturna silentia uitet;<br>       qui canit arte, canat; qui bibit arte, bibat. <br>   sed neque declament medio sermone diserti, <br>       nec sua non sanus scripta poeta legat!' <br>   sic monuit Phoebus: Phoebo parete monenti; <br>       certa dei sacro est huius in ore fides.<br>   ad propiora uocor. quisquis sapienter amabit,<br>       uincet et e nostra, quod petet, arte feret. <br>   credita non semper sulci cum fenere reddunt, <br>       nec semper dubias adiuuat aura rates; <br>   quod iuuat, exiguum, plus est, quod laedat amantes:<br>       proponant animo multa ferenda suo. <br>   quot lepores in Atho, quot apes pascuntur in Hybla, <br>       caerula quot bacas Palladis arbor habet, <br>   litore quot conchae, tot sunt in amore dolores; <br>       quae patimur, multo spicula felle madent.<br>   dicta erit isse foras: intus fortasse uidebis: <br>       isse foras, et te falsa uidere puta. <br>   clausa tibi fuerit promissa ianua nocte: <br>       perfer et inmunda ponere corpus humo.<br>   forsitan et uultu mendax ancilla superbo <br>       dicet 'quid nostras obsidet iste fores?' <br>   postibus et durae supplex blandire puellae<br>       et capiti demptas in fore pone rosas. <br>   cum uolet, accedes: cum te uitabit, abibis; <br>       dedecet ingenuos taedia ferre sui.<br>   'effugere hunc non est' quare tibi possit amica <br>       dicere? non omni tempore sensus obest. <br>   nec maledicta puta, nec uerbera ferre puellae <br>       turpe nec ad teneros oscula ferre pedes. <br>   quid moror in paruis? animus maioribus instat; <br>       magna canam: toto pectore, uulgus, ades. <br>   ardua molimur, sed nulla, nisi ardua, uirtus: <br>       difficilis nostra poscitur arte labor. <br>   riualem patienter habe: uictoria tecum <br>       stabit: eris magni uictor in arce Iouis.<br>   haec tibi non hominem, sed quercus crede Pelasgas <br>       dicere: nil istis ars mea maius habet. <br>   innuet illa: feras; scribet: ne tange tabellas;<br>       unde uolet, ueniat; quoque libebit, eat. <br>   hoc in legitima praestant uxore mariti, <br>       cum, tener, ad partes tu quoque, Somne, uenis. <br>   hac ego, confiteor, non sum perfectus in arte; <br>       quid faciam? monitis sum minor ipse meis. <br>   mene palam nostrae det quisquam signa puellae<br>       et patiar nec me quo libet ira ferat?<br>   oscula uir dederat, memini, suus; oscula questus <br>       sum data; barbaria noster abundat amor.<br>   non semel hoc uitium nocuit mihi; doctior ille, <br>       quo ueniunt alii conciliante uiri. <br>   sed melius nescisse fuit: sine furta tegantur, <br>       ne fugiat ficto fassus ab ore pudor. <br>   quo magis, o iuuenes, deprendere parcite uestras;<br>       peccent, peccantes uerba dedisse putent. <br>   crescit amor prensis: ubi par fortuna duorum est, <br>       in causa damni perstat uterque sui.<br>   fabula narratur toto notissima caelo, <br>       Mulciberis capti Marsque Venusque dolis. <br>   Mars pater, insano Veneris turbatus amore<br>       de duce terribili factus amator erat. <br>   nec Venus oranti (neque enim dea mollior ulla est) <br>       rustica Gradiuo difficilisque fuit. <br>   a, quotiens lasciua pedes risisse mariti <br>       dicitur, et duras igne uel arte manus!<br>   Marte palam simul est Vulcanum imitata, decebat, <br>       multaque cum forma gratia mixta fuit.<br>   sed bene concubitus primos celare solebant. <br>       plena uerecundi culpa pudoris erat. <br>   indicio Solis (quis Solem fallere possit?) <br>       cognita Vulcano coniugis acta suae. <br>   (quam mala, Sol, exempla moues! pete munus ab ipsa <br>       et tibi, si taceas, quod dare possit, habet.) <br>   Mulciber obscuros lectum circaque superque <br>       disponit laqueos: lumina fallit opus. <br>   fingit iter Lemnon; ueniunt ad foedus amantes;<br>       impliciti laqueis nudus uterque iacent.<br>   conuocat ille deos; praebent spectacula capti;<br>       uix lacrimas Venerem continuisse putant. <br>   non uultus texisse suos, non denique possunt <br>       partibus obscenis opposuisse manus.<br>   hic aliquis ridens 'in me, fortissime Mauors, <br>       si tibi sunt oneri, uincula transfer!' ait. <br>   uix precibus, Neptune, tuis captiua resoluit <br>       corpora; Mars Thracen occupat, illa Paphon. <br>   hoc tibi pro facto, Vulcane, quod ante tegebant, <br>       liberius faciunt, ut pudor omnis abest.<br>   saepe tamen demens stulte fecisse fateris, <br>       teque ferunt artis paenituisse tuae. <br>   hoc uetiti uos este;

si raua, 'Mineruae';<br>       sit 'gracilis', macie quae male uiua sua est;<br>   dic 'habilem', quaecumque breuis, quae turgida, 'plenam';<br>       et lateat uitium proximitate boni. <br>   nec quotus annus eat, nec quo sit nata require<br>       consule, quae rigidus munera censor habet,<br>   praecipue si flore caret, meliusque peractum <br>       Tempus, et albentes iam legit illa comas. <br>   utilis, o iuuenes, aut haec, aut serior aetas: <br>       iste feret segetes, iste serendus ager. <br>   [dum uires annique sinunt, tolerate labores: <br>       iam ueniet tacito curua senecta pede.<br>   aut mare remigiis, aut uomere findite terras<br>       aut fera belligeras addite in arma manus, <br>   aut latus et uires operamque adferte puellis: <br>       hoc quoque militia est, hoc quoque quaerit opes.]<br>   adde, quod est illis operum prudentia maior, <br>       solus et, artifices qui facit, usus adest.<br>   illae munditiis annorum damna rependunt<br>       et faciunt cura, ne uideantur anus;<br>   utque uelis, Venerem iungunt per mille figuras: <br>       inuenit plures nulla tabella modos. <br>   illis sentitur non inritata uoluptas: <br>       quod iuuet, ex aequo femina uirque ferant. <br>   odi concubitus, qui non utrumque resoluunt; <br>       hoc est, cur pueri tangar amore minus. <br>   odi quae praebet, quia sit praebere necesse, <br>       siccaque de lana cogitat ipsa sua. <br>   quae datur officio, non est mihi grata uoluptas: <br>       officium faciat nulla puella mihi. <br>   me uoces audire iuuat sua gaudia fassas, <br>       quaeque morer meme sustineamque, roget.<br>   aspiciam dominae uictos amentis ocellos;<br>       langueat et tangi se uetet illa diu. <br>   haec bona non primae tribuit natura iuuentae, <br>       quae cito post septem lustra uenire solent. <br>   qui properant, noua musta bibant; mihi fundat auitum <br>       consulibus priscis condita testa merum. <br>   nec platanus, nisi sera, potest obsistere Phoebo, <br>       et laedunt nudos prata nouella pedes. <br>   scilicet Hermionen Helenae praeponere posses, <br>       et melior Gorge quam sua mater erat!<br>   at Venerem quicumque uoles adtingere seram, <br>       si modo duraris, praemia digna feres.<br>   conscius, ecce, duos accepit lectus amantes: <br>       ad thalami clausas, Musa, resiste fores. <br>   sponte sua sine te celeberrima uerba loquentur, <br>       nec manus in lecto laeua iacebit iners. <br>   inuenient digiti, quod agant in partibus illis, <br>       in quibus occulte spicula tingit Amor. <br>   fecit in Andromache prius hoc fortissimus Hector<br>       nec solum bellis utilis ille fuit.<br>   fecit et in capta Lyrneside magnus Achilles, <br>       cum premeret mollem lassus ab hoste torum. <br>   illis te manibus tangi, Brisei, sinebas, <br>       imbutae Phrygia quae nece semper erant. <br>   an fuit hoc ipsum, quod te, lasciua, iuuaret, <br>       ad tua uictrices membra uenire manus? <br>   crede mihi, non est Veneris properanda uoluptas, <br>       sed sensim tarda prolicienda mora. <br>   cum loca reppereris, quae tangi femina gaudet, <br>       non obstet, tangas quo minus illa, pudor.<br>   aspicies oculos tremulo fulgore micantes, <br>       ut sol a liquida saepe refulget aqua. <br>   accedent questus, accedet amabile murmur, <br>       et dulces gemitus aptaque uerba ioco. <br>   sed neque tu dominam uelis maioribus usus <br>       desere, nec cursus anteat illa tuos; <br>   ad metam properate simul: tum plena uoluptas, <br>       cum pariter uicti femina uirque iacent. <br>   hic tibi uersandus tenor est, cum libera dantur <br>       otia, furtiuum nec timor urget opus.<br>   cum mora non tuta est, totis incumbere remis <br>       utile et admisso subdere calcar equo. <br>   Finis adest operi: palmam date, grata iuuentus, <br>       sertaque odoratae myrtea ferte comae. <br>   quantus apud Danaos Podalirius arte medendi, <br>       Aeacides dextra, pectore Nestor erat,<br>   quantus erat Calchas extis, Telamonius armis, <br>       Automedon curru, tantus amator ego. <br>   me uatem celebrate, uiri, mihi dicite laudes;<br>       cantetur toto nomen in orbe meum.<br>   arma dedi uobis: dederat Vulcanus Achilli; <br>       uincite muneribus, uicit ut ille, datis. <br>   sed quicumque meo superarit Amazona ferro, <br>       inscribat spoliis 'Naso magister erat'. <br>   ecce, rogant tenerae, sibi dem praecepta, puellae: <br>       uos eritis chartae proxima cura meae!</p>   </td>  </tr> </table>
