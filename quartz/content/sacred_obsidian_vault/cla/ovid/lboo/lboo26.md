 <p></p>  <h2 align="center">ELEGY IV:</h2>  <h3 align="center">HE CONFESSES HIS INCLINATION FOR LOVE AND HIS ADMIRATION FOR ALL MANNER OF WOMEN.</h3>  <table border="0" width="100%">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="44%">   
 <p>I MAKE no pretence of justifying the laxity of my morals; I never resort   to untruthful pretexts to excuse my wanderings from the path of virtue. I   freely confess my faults, if such avowals can serve any useful purpose. Now I   have acknowledged my guilt in general terms, I mean to make a clean breast of   all my follies. I curse my failings, yet I cannot help finding</p>   
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>   
 <p>pleasure in the very faults that I deplore. How burdensome is the yoke   that one would fain cast off. I have not the strength nor the will-power to   govern my passions; they bear me along with them, even as the swift tide   hurries away the slender bark.</p>   
 <p>It is not any particular type of beauty that sets my heart on fire. A   hundred motives compel me to be always in love. Here is a girl that drops her   gaze demurely. That is enough, my heart catches fire and her modesty is the   lure that ensnares me. And here is one that is out for booty. To her I fall a   willing victim because she is no novice and because she bids fair to be keen   and enterprising on a downy couch. And then, if I see one with an expression   that recalls to me the Sabine dames, I forthwith tell myself that she has   longings but knows how to conceal them. Are you a learned lady? I fall in   love with your rare accomplishments. Unlearned? Your <i>naïveté</i>   enthralls me. This one finds Callimachus a sorry poet compared with me. I   please her, and lo, straightway she pleases me. This one finds fault with my   verses and tells me I am no poet. Despite her strictures I fain would have   her in my arms. This one walks languorously. Her gait enchants me. This one   is prim. Peradventure, if she had a lover 'twould soften her. This one sings   delightfully, and breathes from her soft throat the most melodious strains. I   long to steal a kiss from her parted lips. Another lightly fingers the   trembling chords of her lyre; where is he who could help adoring such skilful   fingers? Here is one that wins me with her dancing. I feast my eyes on her   seductive poses, on the rhythmic movements of her arms, on the swaying of her   whole body as she moves in time to the music. But never mind me, whom anyone   can set on fire. Let Hippolytus see her; even he would become a Priapus. You,   my tall beauty, recall the heroines of olden days and the bed is not a whit   too long for you. And you, my dainty little treasure; I love you, too, just   as much.</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Both are enchanting. Tall and short, I love them both. Here is one   that wears no finery; I muse how jewels would enhance her beauty. Here is one   tricked out with gems; how dazzling are her charms. Of fair and dark I am   alike the slave; white-skinned or sunburnt, I adore them all. Black tresses   flutter on a snowy neck? Leda's loveliness lay in her raven hair. Is she   fair, the girl I see yonder? Why, ’twas to her golden hair Aurora owed   her beauty. Everywhere history helps me to justify my love. A young woman   delights me, an older one enthralls me. The one has the beauty of her body,   the other experience and richness of mind, to recommend her. In a word, of   all the beauties they rave about in Rome, there's none whose lover I am not   fain to be.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
