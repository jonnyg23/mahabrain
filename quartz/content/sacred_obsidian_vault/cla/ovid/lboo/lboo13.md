 <p>LOAD my guilty hands with fetters, if thou be my friend, now that my anger   has departed. Rage it was, look you, that made me raise my hand against my   mistress. O madman that I was I To think it was my hand that made her weep!   At that moment I would have struck my father and mother; nay, I would have   rained blows upon the gods themselves.</p>   
 <p>But say. Did not Ajax, armed with his sevenfold shield, slaughter the   flocks that he seized in the broad meads? And the ill-fated Orestes who, in   his mother, wrought vengeance on his father, did he not take arms against the   Dark Sisters? And could I, I of all men, dishevel her rangéd tresses?   And did this mar my mistress's beauty? Not so, she only looked the lovelier.   In such guise they say the daughter of Schœneus, armed with her bow,   pursued the beasts on Mænalus. In such a plight did Ariadne mourn, when   she beheld the swift south winds bearing away both the sails and the promises   of her perjured Theseus. Thus too, O chaste Minerva, but for the sacred   fillets that bound her head, Cassandra had lain upon thy temple's floor.</p>   
 <p>Who would not have called me a madman? Who would not have called me a   barbarian? But never a word said she. Her tongue was paralysed with fear.   Howbeit I read the mute reproach upon her face, and, though she spake not,   her tears were my accusers. Oh, why did not my arms fall from my shoulders?   It had been better had I lost a limb. ’Tis against myself that my   violence hath turned, and my vigour hath been the instrument of my own   torture. Wherefore do I need you more, ye ministers of crime and slaughter?   Avaunt, ye sacrilegious hands, and with the fetters ye deserve, be laden.   Why, had I struck the humblest Roman, I should have had</p>   
 <p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 14</font></a></p>   
 <p>to answer for it. Have I then more right to strike my mistress? The son of   Tydeus left a hideous memorial of his wickedness. He was the first to raise   his hand against a goddess. I am the second. And withal, his sin was not so   black as mine. I struck the woman whom I said I loved; he did but wreak his   fury on a foe.</p>   
 <p>Now, mighty conqueror, go and prepare thy triumph. Set the victor's laurel   crown about thy brows and on thy knees give thanks to Jove, and let the vast   throng that grace thy chariot shout aloud, "Io triumphe!" And let   thy poor victim fare sadly before thee, her hair unbraided, pale from head to   foot but for the bruises on her cheeks.</p>   
 <p>Better it had been to have left upon her lips the imprint of my own,   better that her neck should bear the traces of my loving teeth. Then, even   though I was as violent as a mountain torrent, even if I was beneath the sway   of blind rage, was it not enough to shout at the poor girl, without roaring   out a torrent of horrible threats and tearing her dress from neck to girdle?   ’Twas there my violence stopped? Nay, so hardened was my heart, that I   dragged her along by the hair and in my barbarous rage I left the mark of my   nails upon her dainty cheek. There she stood distraught, her face as white as   Parian marble. I beheld her deathlike look, and her limbs trembling like the   poplar leaf stirred by the sighing wind, like the slender reed which bends   beneath the zephyr's breath, like the wave whose surface is ruffled by the   warm south wind. Her tears, long restrained, coursed down her face as the   water floweth from the melting snows. ’Twas then I 'gan to feel the   blackness of my guilt. Those tears of hers, what were they but my blood?   Thrice I essayed to fling myself, a suppliant, at her knees. Thrice she thrust   away my dreaded hands. "Lay on," I cried, "and spare not.   Vengeance win alleviate thy pain. Tear my face with thy nails, spare not mine   eyes, no, nor my hair. Let rage lend</p>

 <p>strength to thy hands, weak though they be; or at least, to obliterate the   sad traces of my crime, braid once more the tresses that my hand so cruelly   dishevelled."</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
