 <p></p>  <h2 align="center">ELEGY II:</h2>  <h3 align="center">TO THE EUNUCH BAGOAS, BEGGING HIM TO GIVE HIM ACCESS TO THE FAIR ONE COMMITTED TO HIS CHARGE.</h3>  <table border="0" width="100%">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="44%">   
 <p>THOU, Bagoas, who art entrusted with the task of guarding thy mistress,   lend me thine ear. I have but a couple of words to say to you, but they are   weighty ones. Yesterday I saw a lady walking in the portico beneath the   temple of Apollo. At once I fell in love with her and importuned her in   writing. In answer, with a trembling hand, she wrote: "Impossible."   And why is it impossible? I asked. And she replied that you keep too strict a   watch on her.</p>

 <p>Now listen to me, my over-watchful friend; if you are wise you will give   up getting yourself hated. If people fear you, they will long for you to die.   Her husband, too, is a fool, for why be at such pains to guard a thing   whereof, even if you watch it not, no part is lost? Still, if he is madman   enough, let him indulge his passion to the full, and believe her chaste who   gives her charms to all. But for thee, vouchsafe her, in secret, a modicum of   freedom. What you give her in that direction she will repay. Just let her   take you into her confidence a little, and the mistress will do what the   slave shall bid. Afraid of conniving a little? Why, you've only got to shut   your eyes. Is she reading a letter in secret? Well, take it that it's from   her mother. A stranger comes to call? Take him for some old acquaintance. She   goes to see a sick friend who isn't sick at all? Why, pretend she <i>is</i>   sick. Is she a long time coming? Let your head droop on your breast, and snore   away to your heart's content. Don't go worrying your head about what they're   doing in the temple of Isis, or what's going on in the theatres.</p>   
 <p>A discreet accomplice wins a deal of glory, and after all, what is simpler   than to hold your tongue? Such a man is liked, he rules the household and   never gets a beating. He is a man of power; the others, scurvy fellows,   merely slaves. In order to keep the husband sweet, he stuffs him with fairy   tales and, masters both, they both approve of what delights the woman. A   husband may frown and furrow his brow with wrinkles, a wheedling woman always   gets her way. Still, every now and then she must seem to have a grudge   against you, pretend to cry and say you are a brute. Your cue is then to   accuse her of some fault that she can readily disprove. In taxing her with   what is false, you blind her husband to the real truth. This if you do,   honours and money will be showered upon you. Act as I bid you, and you'll   soon be a slave no more.</p>   
 <p>You see informers laden with heavy chains, you see</p>

 <p>false-hearted knaves shut up in gloomy dungeons. Tantalus is thirsty, with   water all about him; surrounded by fruit, of fruit he cannot taste. That's   all because he was a blabber. Because he gave too strict effect to Juno's   bidding, Io's guard died ere his prime, and Io is a goddess.</p>   
 <p>I have seen a fellow loaded with chains that were making his legs black   and blue, because he had insisted on telling a husband of his wife's amours.   He merited a weightier doom; his prating tongue had killed the happiness of   two. He filled the husband's heart with grief and slew his wife's good rime.</p>   
 <p>Mark what I say; there never was a husband yet that liked such charges   brought against his spouse. Hear them he may, but he'll never hear them with   pleasure. If he be indifferent, all your precious tale is wasted; if he love   her, then ’tis you who kill his peace of mind. Nay, howsoever clear a   woman's fault may be, it takes a deal of proving. The judge's sympathies are   all for her. Even if he had seen the whole thing with his own eyes, he would   still believe her, if she denied it. He would say his eyes deceived him; that   he himself had been at fault. Let her but fall a-weeping, he'll mingle his   tears with hers and say, "This babbling ass shall get it hot for this."   You see, the odds are nearly all against you, and if you lose, you get a   thrashing, while she's being dandled on the judge's knee.</p>   
 <p>It is no crime we meditate. It is not to mix a poisoned draught that we   desire to meet. No naked dagger flashes in our hand. All we ask is that, by   your good offices, we may love in safety; and what request could be more   innocent than that?</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
