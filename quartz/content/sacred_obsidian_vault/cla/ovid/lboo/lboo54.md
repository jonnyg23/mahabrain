 <p></p>  <h2 align="center">ELEGY XII</h2>  <h3 align="center">HE LAMENTS THAT HIS POEMS HAVE MADE HIS MISTRESS TOO WELL KNOWN.</h3>  <table border="0" width="100%">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="44%">   
 <p>WHAT day was that, ye birds of mournful plumage, when ye sang things of   evil. presage to my love-affairs? What star shall I suspect is moving counter   to my fate, what gods shall I complain are making war against me? The woman   who but now confessed herself my own, of whom I was the first the only lover,   to-day I fear I share with many rivals.</p>   
 <p>Am I at fault, or is it my verses that have made her the talk? ’Tis   even so. My genius hath made of her a wanton. And I deserve it. For why did I   vaunt her beauty? If she sells herself to-day, mine is the fault. I am the   power that hath made her please; ’tis I who have brought her lovers;   these hands have opened the door to them.</p>   
 <p>Whether verses are good for aught, I much misdoubt me; they have always   wrought me ill. ’Twas they excited envy of my treasure.</p>   
 <p>Though of Thebes I might sing, and Troy and Cæsar's mighty deeds,   Corinna alone could fire my genius. Would to heaven that the Muses had been   unfavourable to my songs and that Phœbus had deserted me when my task   was but begun. Yet since it is the custom to give ear to what the poets say,   I should not have wished my verses to have had no weight.</p>   
 <p>’Tis we who sang of Scylla stealing from her father's</p>

 <p>head his treasured locks and hiding in her womb the raging dogs.   ’Tis we who have given wings to the feet and serpents to the hair, our   song gave victory to Abos' child and the wingèd horse. ’Tis we   gave Tityos his mighty stature, and to Cerberus gave his triple mouths and his   serpent-crownèd head. Enceladus we made hurling the spear with a   thousand arms, and through us a youthful sorceress overcame heroes by her   magic spells. We imprisoned the winds of Æolus in the wine-skins of the   Ithacan king; we made the prying Tantalus go mad with thirst, with water all   around him; Niobe we changed into a rock, and a young maiden into a bear.   ’Tis thanks to us that the bird of Cecrops sings Odrysian Itys; that   Jove transforms himself into a bird, or into gold, or, taking on the   semblance of a bull, cleaves the waters with a maiden on his back. Why tell   of Proteus and those dragon's teeth whence sprang the Thebans? Shall I tell   of the bulls that spewed forth flames, and of the tears of amber that flowed,   Orega, from thy sister's cheeks; of ships changed into sea goddesses; of the   sun shrinking in horror from the sight of Atreus' dreadful feast and of the   rocks that followed the music of the lyre?</p>   
 <p>Unceasing the genius of the poets pours forth, and recks not of the   trammels of historic truth. Thus the praises of my mistress should have been   looked upon as false. I have been undone by your credulity.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
