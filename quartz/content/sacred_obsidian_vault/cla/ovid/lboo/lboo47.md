 <p>TWAS night, and sleep had weighed down my weary eyelids, when this vision   came to terrify my soul.</p>   
 <p>On the side of a hill looking towards the south was a grove thickly   planted with oaks, and multitudes of birds found shelter amid their branches.   Beneath was a wide expanse clad in freshest green, watered by a stream which   flowed on with a sweet murmur.</p>   
 <p>Beneath the shade of a leafy oak I was endeavouring to avoid the heat, but   it was hot even in the tree's shade. And lo, grazing on the jewelled meadow,   a white heifer came in sight, a heifer whiter than fresh-fallen snow ere it   has melted into clear water; whiter than the foam on the milk of the ewe that   has just been milked.</p>   
 <p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74</font></a></p>   
 <p>Near her was a bull, her happy mate. He lay down beside her on the thick   green carpet; and as he lay thus at his ease, he slowly chewed the cud of   tender grass. Soon, sleep robbing him of his strength, methought he lay his   hornèd head upon the ground for very weariness.</p>   
 <p>Hither came a crow swiftly cleaving the air and, croaking hoarsely,   lighted upon the green sward. Thrice did she plunge her ravening beak into   the breast of the snow-white heifer, and then at length she flew away. But a   black stain was on the breast of the heifer. And when she saw afar off bulls   browsing on the pastures (for afar off other bulls were browsing on the   pastures) she rushed away and mingled with them and sought out a spot where   the soil was more fertile.</p>   
 <p>"Come," I cried, "come, interpreter of dreams, and tell me   what, if indeed it hath a meaning, this dream of mine betokens." Then   did the interpreter of the dreams of night ponder upon my dream, and thus at   length he made reply. "The heat which thou wast fain to escape in the   leafy shade, and which thou couldst not avoid, was the heat of love. The   heifer is thy mistress, for of such whiteness is she. Thou thyself art the   bull which was following his mate. The crow whose sharp beak tore at the   heifer's breast was that old procuress who will corrupt thy loved one. The   long hesitation of the heifer and her final abandonment of the bull means   that thou wilt be left cold on thy solitary couch. The wound and the dark   stains beneath her breast show that she is not free from the soilure of   adultery."</p>   
 <p>Thus spake the reader of dreams; my cheeks were white and cold and the   drear night spread out before mine eyes.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
