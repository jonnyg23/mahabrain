 <p>The Elevation And Tyranny Of Maximin. - Rebellion In Africa And Italy, Under The Authority Of The Senate. - Civil Wars And Seditions. - Violent Deaths Of Maximin And His Son, Of Maximus And Balbinus, And Of The Three Gordians. - Usurpation And Secular Games Of Philip. </p> 
 <p>     Of the various forms of government which have prevailed in the world, an hereditary monarchy seems to present the fairest scope for ridicule.  Is it possible to relate without an indignant smile, that, on the father's decease, the property of a nation, like that of a drove of oxen, descends to his infant son, as yet unknown to mankind and to himself; and that the bravest warriors and the wisest statesmen, relinquishing their natural right to empire, approach the royal cradle with bended knees and protestations of inviolable fidelity?  Satire and declamation may paint these obvious topics in the most dazzling colors, but our more serious thoughts will respect a useful prejudice, that establishes a rule of succession, independent of the passions of mankind; and we shall cheerfully acquiesce in any expedient which deprives the multitude of the dangerous, and indeed the ideal, power of giving themselves a master. </p> 
 <p>     In the cool shade of retirement, we may easily devise imaginary forms of government, in which the sceptre shall be constantly bestowed on the most worthy, by the free and incorrupt suffrage of the whole community. Experience overturns these airy fabrics, and teaches us, that in a large society, the election of a monarch can never devolve to the wisest, or to the most numerous part of the people.  The army is the only order of men sufficiently united to concur in the same sentiments, and powerful enough to impose them on the rest of their fellow-citizens; but the temper of soldiers, habituated at once to violence and to slavery, renders them very unfit guardians of a legal, or even a civil constitution.  Justice, humanity, or political wisdom, are qualities they are too little acquainted with in themselves, to appreciate them in others.  Valor will acquire their esteem, and liberality will purchase their suffrage; but the first of these merits is often lodged in the most savage breasts; the latter can only exert itself at the expense of the public; and both may be turned against the possessor of the throne, by the ambition of a daring rival. </p> 
 <p>     The superior prerogative of birth, when it has obtained the sanction of time and popular opinion, is the plainest and least invidious of all distinctions among mankind.  The acknowledged right extinguishes the hopes of faction, and the conscious security disarms the cruelty of the monarch.  To the firm establishment of this idea we owe the peaceful succession and mild administration of European monarchies.  To the defect of it we must attribute the frequent civil wars, through which an Asiatic despot is obliged to cut his way to the throne of his fathers.  Yet, even in the East, the sphere of contention is usually limited to the princes of the reigning house, and as soon as the more fortunate competitor has removed his brethren by the sword and the bowstring, he no longer entertains any jealousy of his meaner subjects.  But the Roman empire, after the authority of the senate had sunk into contempt, was a vast scene of confusion.  The royal, and even noble, families of the provinces had long since been led in triumph before the car of the haughty republicans.  The ancient families of Rome had successively fallen beneath the tyranny of the Caesars; and whilst those princes were shackled by the forms of a commonwealth, and disappointed by the repeated failure of their posterity,  <a name="fr_579"></a><a href="#fn_579"><font size="1">1</font></a> it was impossible that any idea of hereditary succession should have taken root in the minds of their subjects.  The right to the throne, which none could claim from birth, every one assumed from merit.  The daring hopes of ambition were set loose from the salutary restraints of law and prejudice; and the meanest of mankind might, without folly, entertain a hope of being raised by valor and fortune to a rank in the army, in which a single crime would enable him to wrest the sceptre of the world from his feeble and unpopular master.  After the murder of Alexander Severus, and the elevation of Maximin, no emperor could think himself safe upon the throne, and every barbarian peasant of the frontier might aspire to that august, but dangerous station. </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>     About thirty-two years before that event, the emperor Severus, returning from an eastern expedition, halted in Thrace, to celebrate, with military games, the birthday of his younger son, Geta.  The country flocked in crowds to behold their sovereign, and a young barbarian of gigantic stature earnestly solicited, in his rude dialect, that he might be allowed to contend for the prize of wrestling.  As the pride of discipline would have been disgraced in the overthrow of a Roman soldier by a Thracian peasant, he was matched with the stoutest followers of the camp, sixteen of whom he successively laid on the ground.  His victory was rewarded by some trifling gifts, and a permission to enlist in the troops.  The next day, the happy barbarian was distinguished above a crowd of recruits, dancing and exulting after the fashion of his country.  As soon as he perceived that he had attracted the emperor's notice, he instantly ran up to his horse, and followed him on foot, without the least appearance of fatigue, in a long and rapid career.  "Thracian," said Severus with astonishment, "art thou disposed to wrestle after thy race?" "Most willingly, sir," replied the unwearied youth; and, almost in a breath, overthrew seven of the strongest soldiers in the army.  A gold collar was the prize of his matchless vigor and activity, and he was immediately appointed to serve in the horseguards who always attended on the person of the sovereign.  <a name="fr_580"></a><a href="#fn_580"><font size="1">2</font></a> </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>     Maximin, for that was his name, though born on the territories of the empire, descended from a mixed race of barbarians.  His father was a Goth, and his mother of the nation of the Alani.  He displayed on every occasion a valor equal to his strength; and his native fierceness was soon tempered or disguised by the knowledge of the world.  Under the reign of Severus and his son, he obtained the rank of centurion, with the favor and esteem of both those princes, the former of whom was an excellent judge of merit.  Gratitude forbade Maximin to serve under the assassin of Caracalla.  Honor taught him to decline the effeminate insults of Elagabalus.  On the accession of Alexander he returned to court, and was placed by that prince in a station useful to the service, and honorable to himself.  The fourth legion, to which he was appointed tribune, soon became, under his care, the best disciplined of the whole army.  With the general applause of the soldiers, who bestowed on their favorite hero the names of Ajax and Hercules, he was successively promoted to the first military command;  <a name="fr_581"></a><a href="#fn_581"><font size="1">3</font></a> and had not he still retained too much of his savage origin, the emperor might perhaps have given his own sister in marriage to the son of Maximin.  <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">4</font></a> </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>     Instead of securing his fidelity, these favors served only to inflame the ambition of the Thracian peasant, who deemed his fortune inadequate to his merit, as long as he was constrained to acknowledge a superior.  Though a stranger to rea wisdom, he was not devoid of a selfish cunning, which showed him that the emperor had lost the affection of the army, and taught him to improve their discontent to his own advantage.  It is easy for faction and calumny to shed their poison on the administration of the best of princes, and to accuse even their virtues by artfully confounding them with those vices to which they bear the nearest affinity.  The troops listened with pleasure to the emissaries of Maximin.  They blushed at their own ignominious patience, which, during thirteen years, had supported the vexatious discipline imposed by an effeminate Syrian, the timid slave of his mother and of the senate.  It was time, they cried, to cast away that useless phantom of the civil power, and to elect for their prince and general a real soldier, educated in camps, exercised in war, who would assert the glory, and distribute among his companions the treasures, of the empire.  A great army was at that time assembled on the banks of the Rhine, under the command of the emperor himself, who, almost immediately after his return from the Persian war, had been obliged to march against the barbarians of Germany. The important care of training and reviewing the new levies was intrusted to Maximin.  One day, as he entered the field of exercise, the troops either from a sudden impulse, or a formed conspiracy, saluted him emperor, silenced by their loud acclamations his obstinate refusal, and hastened to consummate their rebellion by the murder of Alexander Severus. </p> 
 <p>     The circumstances of his death are variously related.  The writers, who suppose that he died in ignorance of the ingratitude and ambition of Maximin, affirm, that, after taking a frugal repast in the sight of the army, he retired to sleep, and that, about the seventh hour of the day, a part of his own guards broke into the imperial tent, and, with many wounds, assassinated their virtuous and unsuspecting prince.  <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">5</font></a> If we credit another, and indeed a more probable account, Maximin was invested with the purple by a numerous detachment, at the distance of several miles from the head-quarters; and he trusted for success rather to the secret wishes than to the public declarations of the great army.  Alexander had sufficient time to awaken a faint sense of loyalty among the troops; but their reluctant professions of fidelity quickly vanished on the appearance of Maximin, who declared himself the friend and advocate of the military order, and was unanimously acknowledged emperor of the Romans by the applauding legions.  The son of Mamaea, betrayed and deserted, withdrew into his tent, desirous at least to conceal his approaching fate from the insults of the multitude.  He was soon followed by a tribune and some centurions, the ministers of death; but instead of receiving with manly resolution the inevitable stroke, his unavailing cries and entreaties disgraced the last moments of his life, and converted into contempt some portion of the just pity which his innocence and misfortunes must inspire.  His mother, Mamaea, whose pride and avarice he loudly accused as the cause of his ruin, perished with her son.  The most faithful of his friends were sacrificed to the first fury of the soldiers. Others were reserved for the more deliberate cruelty of the usurper; and those who experienced the mildest treatment, were stripped of their employments, and ignominiously driven from the court and army.  <a name="fr_584"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">6</font></a>  
   
  </p> 
 <p>     The former tyrants, Caligula and Nero, Commodus, and Caracalla, were all dissolute and unexperienced youths,  <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">7</font></a> educated in the purple, and corrupted by the pride of empire, the luxury of Rome, and the perfidious voice of flattery.  The cruelty of Maximin was derived from a different source, the fear of contempt.  Though he depended on the attachment of the soldiers, who loved him for virtues like their own, he was conscious that his mean and barbarian origin, his savage appearance, and his total ignorance of the arts and institutions of civil life,  <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">8</font></a> formed a very unfavorable contrast with the amiable manners of the unhappy Alexander.  He remembered, that, in his humbler fortune, he had often waited before the door of the haughty nobles of Rome, and had been denied admittance by the insolence of their slaves.  He recollected too the friendship of a few who had relieved his poverty, and assisted his rising hopes.  But those who had spurned, and those who had protected, the Thracian, were guilty of the same crime, the knowledge of his original obscurity.  For this crime many were put to death; and by the execution of several of his benefactors, Maximin published, in characters of blood, the indelible history of his baseness and ingratitude.  <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_587"><font size="1">9</font></a>  
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>     The dark and sanguinary soul of the tyrant was open to every suspicion against those among his subjects who were the most distinguished by their birth or merit.  Whenever he was alarmed with the sound of treason, his cruelty was unbounded and unrelenting.  A conspiracy against his life was either discovered or imagined, and Magnus, a consular senator, was named as the principal author of it.  Without a witness, without a trial, and without an opportunity of defence, Magnus, with four thousand of his supposed accomplices, was put to death.  Italy and the whole empire were infested with innumerable spies and informers.  On the slightest accusation, the first of the Roman nobles, who had governed provinces, commanded armies, and been adorned with the consular and triumphal ornaments, were chained on the public carriages, and hurried away to the emperor's presence.  Confiscation, exile, or simple death, were esteemed uncommon instances of his lenity.  Some of the unfortunate sufferers he ordered to be sewed up in the hides of slaughtered animals, others to be exposed to wild beasts, others again to be beaten to death with clubs.  During the three years of his reign, he disdained to visit either Rome or Italy.  His camp, occasionally removed from the banks of the Rhine to those of the Danube, was the seat of his stern despotism, which trampled on every principle of law and justice, and was supported by the avowed power of the sword.  <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_588"><font size="1">10</font></a> No man of noble birth, elegant accomplishments, or knowledge of civil business, was suffered near his person; and the court of a Roman emperor revived the idea of those ancient chiefs of slaves and gladiators, whose savage power had left a deep impression of terror and detestation.  <a name="fr_589"></a><a href="#fn_589"><font size="1">11</font></a> </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>     As long as the cruelty of Maximin was confined to the illustrious senators, or even to the bold adventurers, who in the court or army expose themselves to the caprice of fortune, the body of the people viewed their sufferings with indifference, or perhaps with pleasure.  But the tyrant's avarice, stimulated by the insatiate desires of the soldiers, at length attacked the public property.  Every city of the empire was possessed of an independent revenue, destined to purchase corn for the multitude, and to supply the expenses of the games and entertainments.  By a single act of authority, the whole mass of wealth was at once confiscated for the use of the Imperial treasury.  The temples were stripped of their most valuable offerings of gold and silver, and the statues of gods, heroes, and emperors, were melted down and coined into money.  These impious orders could not be executed without tumults and massacres, as in many places the people chose rather to die in the defence of their altars, than to behold in the midst of peace their cities exposed to the rapine and cruelty of war.  The soldiers themselves, among whom this sacrilegious plunder was distributed, received it with a blush; and hardened as they were in acts of violence, they dreaded the just reproaches of their friends and relations.  Throughout the Roman world a general cry of indignation was heard, imploring vengeance on the common enemy of human kind; and at length, by an act of private oppression, a peaceful and unarmed province was driven into rebellion against him.  <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_590"><font size="1">12</font></a>  
        The procurator of Africa was a servant worthy of such a master, who considered the fines and confiscations of the rich as one of the most fruitful branches of the Imperial revenue.  An iniquitous sentence had been pronounced against some opulent youths of that country, the execution of which would have stripped them of far the greater part of their patrimony. In this extremity, a resolution that must either complete or prevent their ruin, was dictated by despair.  A respite of three days, obtained with difficulty from the rapacious treasurer, was employed in collecting from their estates a great number of slaves and peasants blindly devoted to the commands of their lords, and armed with the rustic weapons of clubs and axes. The leaders of the conspiracy, as they were admitted to the audience of the procurator, stabbed him with the daggers concealed under their garments, and, by the assistance of their tumultuary train, seized on the little town of Thysdrus,  <a name="fr_591"></a><a href="#fn_591"><font size="1">13</font></a> and erected the standard of rebellion against the sovereign of the Roman empire.  They rested their hopes on the hatred of mankind against Maximin, and they judiciously resolved to oppose to that detested tyrant an emperor whose mild virtues had already acquired the love and esteem of the Romans, and whose authority over the province would give weight and stability to the enterprise.  Gordianus, their proconsul, and the object of their choice, refused, with unfeigned reluctance, the dangerous honor, and begged with tears, that they would suffer him to terminate in peace a long and innocent life, without staining his feeble age with civil blood.  Their menaces compelled him to accept the Imperial purple, his only refuge, indeed, against the jealous cruelty of Maximin; since, according to the reasoning of tyrants, those who have been esteemed worthy of the throne deserve death, and those who deliberate have already rebelled.  <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_592"><font size="1">14</font></a> </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
        The family of Gordianus was one of the most illustrious of the Roman senate.  On the father's side he was descended from the Gracchi; on his mother's, from the emperor Trajan.  A great estate enabled him to support the dignity of his birth, and in the enjoyment of it, he displayed an elegant taste and beneficent disposition.  The palace in Rome, formerly inhabited by the great Pompey, had been, during several generations, in the possession of Gordian's family.  <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_593"><font size="1">15</font></a> It was distinguished by ancient trophies of naval victories, and decorated with the works of modern painting.  His villa on the road to Praeneste was celebrated for baths of singular beauty and extent, for three stately rooms of a hundred feet in length, and for a magnificent portico, supported by two hundred columns of the four most curious and costly sorts of marble.  <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_594"><font size="1">16</font></a> The public shows exhibited at his expense, and in which the people were entertained with many hundreds of wild beasts and gladiators,  <a name="fr_595"></a><a href="#fn_595"><font size="1">17</font></a> seem to surpass the fortune of a subject; and whilst the liberality of other magistrates was confined to a few solemn festivals at Rome, the magnificence of Gordian was repeated, when he was aedile, every month in the year, and extended, during his consulship, to the principal cities of Italy. He was twice elevated to the last-mentioned dignity, by Caracalla and by Alexander; for he possessed the uncommon talent of acquiring the esteem of virtuous princes, without alarming the jealousy of tyrants.  His long life was innocently spent in the study of letters and the peaceful honors of Rome; and, till he was named proconsul of Africa by the voice of the senate and the approbation of Alexander,  <a name="fr_596"></a><a href="#fn_596"><font size="1">18</font></a> he appears prudently to have declined the command of armies and the government of provinces.  <a name="fr_597"></a><a href="#fn_597"><font size="1">*_0056</font></a> As long as that emperor lived, Africa was happy under the administration of his worthy representative: after the barbarous Maximin had usurped the throne, Gordianus alleviated the miseries which he was unable to prevent.  When he reluctantly accepted the purple, he was above fourscore years old; a last and valuable remains of the happy age of the Antonines, whose virtues he revived in his own conduct, and celebrated in an elegant poem of thirty books.  With the venerable proconsul, his son, who had accompanied him into Africa as his lieutenant, was likewise declared emperor.  His manners were less pure, but his character was equally amiable with that of his father.  Twenty-two acknowledged concubines, and a library of sixty-two thousand volumes, attested the variety of his inclinations; and from the productions which he left behind him, it appears that the former as well as the latter were designed for use rather than for ostentation.  <a name="fr_598"></a><a href="#fn_598"><font size="1">19</font></a> The Roman people acknowledged in the features of the younger Gordian the resemblance of Scipio Africanus,  <a name="fr_599"></a><a href="#fn_599"><font size="1">!_0056</font></a> recollected with pleasure that his mother was the granddaughter of Antoninus Pius, and rested the public hope on those latent virtues which had hitherto, as they fondly imagined, lain concealed in the luxurious indolence of private life. </p>

 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>     As soon as the Gordians had appeased the first tumult of a popular election, they removed their court to Carthage.  They were received with the acclamations of the Africans, who honored their virtues, and who, since the visit of Hadrian, had never beheld the majesty of a Roman emperor.  But these vain acclamations neither strengthened nor confirmed the title of the Gordians.  They were induced by principle, as well as interest, to solicit the approbation of the senate; and a deputation of the noblest provincials was sent, without delay, to Rome, to relate and justify the conduct of their countrymen, who, having long suffered with patience, were at length resolved to act with vigor.  The letters of the new princes were modest and respectful, excusing the necessity which had obliged them to accept the Imperial title; but submitting their election and their fate to the supreme judgment of the senate.  <a name="fr_600"></a><a href="#fn_600"><font size="1">20</font></a> </p> 
 <p>
        The inclinations of the senate were neither doubtful nor divided.  The birth and noble alliances of the Gordians had intimately connected them with the most illustrious houses of Rome.  Their fortune had created many dependants in that assembly, their merit had acquired many friends.  Their mild administration opened the flattering prospect of the restoration, not only of the civil but even of the republican government.  The terror of military violence, which had first obliged the senate to forget the murder of Alexander, and to ratify the election of a barbarian peasant,  <a name="fr_601"></a><a href="#fn_601"><font size="1">21</font></a> now produced a contrary effect, and provoked them to assert the injured rights of freedom and humanity.  The hatred of Maximin towards the senate was declared and implacable; the tamest submission had not appeased his fury, the most cautious innocence would not remove his suspicions; and even the care of their own safety urged them to share the fortune of an enterprise, of which (if unsuccessful) they were sure to be the first victims.  These considerations, and perhaps others of a more private nature, were debated in a previous conference of the consuls and the magistrates.  As soon as their resolution was decided, they convoked in the temple of Castor the whole body of the senate, according to an ancient form of secrecy,  <a name="fr_602"></a><a href="#fn_602"><font size="1">22</font></a> calculated to awaken their attention, and to conceal their decrees.  "Conscript fathers," said the consul Syllanus, "the two Gordians, both of consular dignity, the one your proconsul, the other your lieutenant, have been declared emperors by the general consent of Africa.  Let us return thanks," he boldly continued, "to the youth of Thysdrus; let us return thanks to the faithful people of Carthage, our generous deliverers from a horrid monster - Why do you hear me thus coolly, thus timidly?  Why do you cast those anxious looks on each other?  Why hesitate?  Maximin is a public enemy! may his enmity soon expire with him, and may we long enjoy the prudence and felicity of Gordian the father, the valor and constancy of Gordian the son!"  <a name="fr_603"></a><a href="#fn_603"><font size="1">23</font></a> The noble ardor of the consul revived the languid spirit of the senate.  By a unanimous decree, the election of the Gordians was ratified, Maximin, his son, and his adherents, were pronounced enemies of their country, and liberal rewards were offered to whomsoever had the courage and good fortune to destroy them.  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
        During the emperor's absence, a detachment of the Praetorian guards remained at Rome, to protect, or rather to command, the capital.  The praefect Vitalianus had signalized his fidelity to Maximin, by the alacrity with which he had obeyed, and even prevented the cruel mandates of the tyrant.  His death alone could rescue the authority of the senate, and the lives of the senators from a state of danger and suspense.  Before their resolves had transpired, a quaestor and some tribunes were commissioned to take his devoted life.  They executed the order with equal boldness and success; and, with their bloody daggers in their hands, ran through the streets, proclaiming to the people and the soldiers the news of the happy revolution.  The enthusiasm of liberty was seconded by the promise of a large donative, in lands and money; the statues of Maximin were thrown down; the capital of the empire acknowledged, with transport, the authority of the two Gordians and the senate;  <a name="fr_604"></a><a href="#fn_604"><font size="1">24</font></a> and the example of Rome was followed by the rest of Italy. </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>     A new spirit had arisen in that assembly, whose long patience had been insulted by wanton despotism and military license.  The senate assumed the reins of government, and, with a calm intrepidity, prepared to vindicate by arms the cause of freedom.  Among the consular senators recommended by their merit and services to the favor of the emperor Alexander, it was easy to select twenty, not unequal to the command of an army, and the conduct of a war.  To these was the defence of Italy intrusted.  Each was appointed to act in his respective department, authorized to enroll and discipline the Italian youth; and instructed to fortify the ports and highways, against the impending invasion of Maximin.  A number of deputies, chosen from the most illustrious of the senatorian and equestrian orders, were despatched at the same time to the governors of the several provinces, earnestly conjuring them to fly to the assistance of their country, and to remind the nations of their ancient ties of friendship with the Roman senate and people.  The general respect with which these deputies were received, and the zeal of Italy and the provinces in favor of the senate, sufficiently prove that the subjects of Maximin were reduced to that uncommon distress, in which the body of the people has more to fear from oppression than from resistance.  The consciousness of that melancholy truth, inspires a degree of persevering fury, seldom to be found in those civil wars which are artificially supported for the benefit of a few factious and designing leaders.  <a name="fr_605"></a><a href="#fn_605"><font size="1">25</font></a> 
  </p> 
 <p>     For while the cause of the Gordians was embraced with such diffusive ardor, the Gordians themselves were no more.  The feeble court of Carthage was alarmed by the rapid approach of Capelianus, governor of Mauritania, who, with a small band of veterans, and a fierce host of barbarians, attacked a faithful, but unwarlike province.  The younger Gordian sallied out to meet the enemy at the head of a few guards, and a numerous undisciplined multitude, educated in the peaceful luxury of Carthage.  His useless valor served only to procure him an honorable death on the field of battle.  His aged father, whose reign had not exceeded thirty-six days, put an end to his life on the first news of the defeat.  Carthage, destitute of defence, opened her gates to the conqueror, and Africa was exposed to the rapacious cruelty of a slave, obliged to satisfy his unrelenting master with a large account of blood and treasure.  <a name="fr_606"></a><a href="#fn_606"><font size="1">26</font></a> </p> 
 <p>
        The fate of the Gordians filled Rome with just but unexpected terror. The senate, convoked in the temple of Concord, affected to transact the common business of the day; and seemed to decline, with trembling anxiety, the consideration of their own and the public danger.  A silent consternation prevailed in the assembly, till a senator, of the name and family of Trajan, awakened his brethren from their fatal lethargy.  He represented to them that the choice of cautious, dilatory measures had been long since out of their power; that Maximin, implacable by nature, and exasperated by injuries, was advancing towards Italy, at the head of the military force of the empire; and that their only remaining alternative was either to meet him bravely in the field, or tamely to expect the tortures and ignominious death reserved for unsuccessful rebellion.  "We have lost," continued he, "two excellent princes; but unless we desert ourselves, the hopes of the republic have not perished with the Gordians.  Many are the senators whose virtues have deserved, and whose abilities would sustain, the Imperial dignity.  Let us elect two emperors, one of whom may conduct the war against the public enemy, whilst his colleague remains at Rome to direct the civil administration.  I cheerfully expose myself to the danger and envy of the nomination, and give my vote in favor of Maximus and Balbinus.  Ratify my choice, conscript fathers, or appoint in their place, others more worthy of the empire." The general apprehension silenced the whispers of jealousy; the merit of the candidates was universally acknowledged; and the house resounded with the sincere acclamations of "Long life and victory to the emperors Maximus and Balbinus.  You are happy in the judgment of the senate; may the republic be happy under your administration!"  <a name="fr_607"></a><a href="#fn_607"><font size="1">27</font></a> </p>

His biographer ought to have marked, with more care, his exploits, and the successive steps of his military promotions.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_583"></a><a href="daf01021.htm#fr_583">5</a> Hist. August. p. 135.  I have softened some of the most improbable circumstances of this wretched biographer.  From his ill-worded narration, it should seem that the prince's buffoon having accidentally entered the tent, and awakened the slumbering monarch, the fear of punishment urged him to persuade the disaffected soldiers to commit the murder.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_584"></a><a href="daf01021.htm#fr_584">6</a> Herodian, l. vi. 223-227.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_585"></a><a href="daf01021.htm#fr_585">7</a> Caligula, the eldest of the four, was only twenty-five years of age when he ascended the throne; Caracalla was twenty-three, Commodus nineteen, and Nero no more than seventeen.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_586"></a><a href="daf01021.htm#fr_586">8</a> It appears that he was totally ignorant of the Greek language; which, from its universal use in conversation and letters, was an essential part of every liberal education.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_588"></a><a href="daf01021.htm#fr_588">10</a> The wife of Maximin, by insinuating wise counsels with female gentleness, sometimes brought back the tyrant to the way of truth and humanity.  See Ammianus Marcellinus, l. xiv. c. l, where he alludes to the fact which he had more fully related under the reign of the Gordians.  We may collect from the medals, that Paullina was the name of this benevolent empress; and from the title of Diva, that she died before Maximin.  (Valesius ad loc. cit. Ammian.) Spanheim de U. et P. N. tom. ii. p. 300.       Note: If we may believe Syrcellus and Zonaras, in was Maximin himself who ordered her death - G</p>

This city was decorated, probably by the Gordians, with the title of colony, and with a fine amphitheatre, which is still in a very perfect state.  See Intinerar. Wesseling, p. 59; and Shaw's Travels, p. 117.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_593"></a><a href="daf01021.htm#fr_593">15</a> Hist. Aug. p. 152.  The celebrated house of Pompey in carinis was usurped by Marc Antony, and consequently became, after the Triumvir's death, a part of the Imperial domain.  The emperor Trajan allowed, and even encouraged, the rich senators to purchase those magnificent and useless places, (Plin. Panegyric. c. 50;) and it may seem probable, that, on this occasion, Pompey's house came into the possession of Gordian's great- grandfather.</p>

The colors of Roman marbles have been faintly described and imperfectly distinguished.  It appears, however, that the Carystian was a sea-green, and that the marble of Synnada was white mixed with oval spots of purple.  See Salmasius ad Hist. August. p. 164.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_595"></a><a href="daf01021.htm#fr_595">17</a> Hist. August. p. 151, 152.  He sometimes gave five hundred pair of gladiators, never less than one hundred and fifty.  He once gave for the use of the circus one hundred Sicilian, and as many Cappaecian Cappadecian horses.  The animals designed for hunting were chiefly bears, boars, bulls, stags, elks, wild asses, &amp;c.  Elephants and lions seem to have been appropriated to Imperial magnificence.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_596"></a><a href="daf01021.htm#fr_596">18</a> See the original letter, in the Augustan History, p. 152, which at once shows Alexander's respect for the authority of the senate, and his esteem for the proconsul appointed by that assembly.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_602"></a><a href="daf01021.htm#fr_602">22</a> Even the servants of the house, the scribes, &amp;c., were excluded, and their office was filled by the senators themselves.  We are obliged to the Augustan History. p. 159, for preserving this curious example of the old discipline of the commonwealth.</p>

We may observe, that one month and six days, for the reign of Gordian, is a just correction of Casaubon and Panvinius, instead of the absurd reading of one year and six months.  See Commentar. p. 193.  Zosimus relates, l. i. p. 17, that the two Gordians perished by a tempest in the midst of their navigation. A strange ignorance of history, or a strange abuse of metaphors!</p>
 <p><a name="fn_607"></a><a href="daf01021.htm#fr_607">27</a> See the Augustan History, p. 166, from the registers of the senate; the date is confessedly faulty but the coincidence of the Apollinatian games enables us to correct it.</p>
