 <p>     The Huns, who under the reign of Valens threatened the empire of Rome, had been formidable, in a much earlier period, to the empire of China.  <a name="fr_1534"></a><a href="#fn_1533"><font size="1">27</font></a> Their ancient, perhaps their original, seat was an extensive, though dry and barren, tract of country, immediately on the north side of the great wall. Their place is at present occupied by the forty-nine Hords or Banners of the Mongous, a pastoral nation, which consists of about two hundred thousand families.  <a name="fr_1535"></a><a href="#fn_1534"><font size="1">28</font></a> But the valor of the Huns had extended the narrow limits of their dominions; and their rustic chiefs, who assumed the appellation of Tanjou, gradually became the conquerors, and the sovereigns of a formidable empire.  Towards the East, their victorious arms were stopped only by the ocean; and the tribes, which are thinly scattered between the Amoor and the extreme peninsula of Corea, adhered, with reluctance, to the standard of the Huns.  On the West, near the head of the Irtish, in the valleys of Imaus, they found a more ample space, and more numerous enemies.  One of the lieutenants of the Tanjou subdued, in a single expedition, twenty-six nations; the Igours,  <a name="fr_1536"></a><a href="#fn_1535"><font size="1">29</font></a> distinguished above the Tartar race by the use of letters, were in the number of his vassals; and, by the strange connection of human events, the flight of one of those vagrant tribes recalled the victorious Parthians from the invasion of Syria.  <a name="fr_1537"></a><a href="#fn_1536"><font size="1">30</font></a> On the side of the North, the ocean was assigned as the limit of the power of the Huns.  Without enemies to resist their progress, or witnesses to contradict their vanity, they might securely achieve a real, or imaginary, conquest of the frozen regions of Siberia.  The Northren Sea was fixed as the remote boundary of their empire.  But the name of that sea, on whose shores the patriot Sovou embraced the life of a shepherd and an exile,  <a name="fr_1538"></a><a href="#fn_1537"><font size="1">31</font></a> may be transferred, with much more probability, to the Baikal, a capacious basin, above three hundred miles in length, which disdains the modest appellation of a lake  <a name="fr_1539"></a><a href="#fn_1538"><font size="1">32</font></a> and which actually communicates with the seas of the North, by the long course of the Angara, the Tongusha, and the Jenissea.  The submission of so many distant nations might flatter the pride of the Tanjou; but the valor of the Huns could be rewarded only by the enjoyment of the wealth and luxury of the empire of the South.  In the third century  <a name="fr_1540"></a><a href="#fn_1539"><font size="1">!_0085</font></a> before the Christian aera, a wall of fifteen hundred miles in length was constructed, to defend the frontiers of China against the inroads of the Huns;  <a name="fr_1541"></a><a href="#fn_1540"><font size="1">33</font></a> but this stupendous work, which holds a conspicuous place in the map of the world, has never contributed to the safety of an unwarlike people.  The cavalry of the Tanjou frequently consisted of two or three hundred thousand men, formidable by the matchless dexterity with which they managed their bows and their horses: by their hardy patience in supporting the inclemency of the weather; and by the incredible speed of their march, which was seldom checked by torrents, or precipices, by the deepest rivers, or by the most lofty mountains.  They spread themselves at once over the face of the country; and their rapid impetuosity surprised, astonished, and disconcerted the grave and elaborate tactics of a Chinese army.  The emperor Kaoti,  <a name="fr_1542"></a><a href="#fn_1541"><font size="1">34</font></a> a soldier of fortune, whose personal merit had raised him to the throne, marched against the Huns with those veteran troops which had been trained in the civil wars of China.  But he was soon surrounded by the Barbarians; and, after a siege of seven days, the monarch, hopeless of relief, was reduced to purchase his deliverance by an ignominious capitulation.  The successors of Kaoti, whose lives were dedicated to the arts of peace, or the luxury of the palace, submitted to a more permanent disgrace.  They too hastily confessed the insufficiency of arms and fortifications.  They were too easily convinced, that while the blazing signals announced on every side the approach of the Huns, the Chinese troops, who slept with the helmet on their head, and the cuirass on their back, were destroyed by the incessant labor of ineffectual marches.  <a name="fr_1543"></a><a href="#fn_1542"><font size="1">35</font></a> A regular payment of money, and silk, was stipulated as the condition of a temporary and precarious peace; and the wretched expedient of disguising a real tribute, under the names of a gift or subsidy, was practised by the emperors of China as well as by those of Rome.  But there still remained a more disgraceful article of tribute, which violated the sacred feelings of humanity and nature.  The hardships of the savage life, which destroy in their infancy the children who are born with a less healthy and robust constitution, introduced a remarkable disproportion between the numbers of the two sexes.  The Tartars are an ugly and even deformed race; and while they consider their own women as the instruments of domestic labor, their desires, or rather their appetites, are directed to the enjoyment of more elegant beauty.  A select band of the fairest maidens of China was annually devoted to the rude embraces of the Huns;  <a name="fr_1544"></a><a href="#fn_1543"><font size="1">36</font></a> and the alliance of the haughty Tanjous was secured by their marriage with the genuine, or adopted, daughters of the Imperial family, which vainly attempted to escape the sacrilegious pollution.  The situation of these unhappy victims is described in the verses of a Chinese princess, who laments that she had been condemned by her parents to a distant exile, under a Barbarian husband; who complains that sour milk was her only drink, raw flesh her only food, a tent her only palace; and who expresses, in a strain of pathetic simplicity, the natural wish, that she were transformed into a bird, to fly back to her dear country; the object of her tender and perpetual regret.  <a name="fr_1545"></a><a href="#fn_1544"><font size="1">37</font></a> </p>

        The conquest of China has been twice achieved by the pastoral tribes of the North: the forces of the Huns were not inferior to those of the Moguls, or of the Mantcheoux; and their ambition might entertain the most sanguine hopes of success.  But their pride was humbled, and their progress was checked, by the arms and policy of Vouti,  <a name="fr_1546"></a><a href="#fn_1545"><font size="1">38</font></a> the fifth emperor of the powerful dynasty of the Han.  In his long reign of fifty-four years, the Barbarians of the southern provinces submitted to the laws and manners of China; and the ancient limits of the monarchy were enlarged, from the great river of Kiang, to the port of Canton.  Instead of confining himself to the timid operations of a defensive war, his lieutenants penetrated many hundred miles into the country of the Huns.  In those boundless deserts, where it is impossible to form magazines, and difficult to transport a sufficient supply of provisions, the armies of Vouti were repeatedly exposed to intolerable hardships: and, of one hundred and forty thousand soldiers, who marched against the Barbarians, thirty thousand only returned in safety to the feet of their master.  These losses, however, were compensated by splendid and decisive success.  The Chinese generals improved the superiority which they derived from the temper of their arms, their chariots of war, and the service of their Tartar auxiliaries.  The camp of the Tanjou was surprised in the midst of sleep and intemperance; and, though the monarch of the Huns bravely cut his way through the ranks of the enemy, he left above fifteen thousand of his subjects on the field of battle.  Yet this signal victory, which was preceded and followed by many bloody engagements, contributed much less to the destruction of the power of the Huns than the effectual policy which was employed to detach the tributary nations from their obedience.  Intimidated by the arms, or allured by the promises, of Vouti and his successors, the most considerable tribes, both of the East and of the West, disclaimed the authority of the Tanjou.  While some acknowledged themselves the allies or vassals of the empire, they all became the implacable enemies of the Huns; and the numbers of that haughty people, as soon as they were reduced to their native strength, might, perhaps, have been contained within the walls of one of the great and populous cities of China.  <a name="fr_1547"></a><a href="#fn_1546"><font size="1">39</font></a> The desertion of his subjects, and the perplexity of a civil war, at length compelled the Tanjou himself to renounce the dignity of an independent sovereign, and the freedom of a warlike and high-spirited nation.  He was received at Sigan, the capital of the monarchy, by the troops, the mandarins, and the emperor himself, with all the honors that could adorn and disguise the triumph of Chinese vanity.  <a name="fr_1548"></a><a href="#fn_1547"><font size="1">40</font></a> A magnificent palace was prepared for his reception; his place was assigned above all the princes of the royal family; and the patience of the Barbarian king was exhausted by the ceremonies of a banquet, which consisted of eight courses of meat, and of nine solemn pieces of music. But he performed, on his knees, the duty of a respectful homage to the emperor of China; pronounced, in his own name, and in the name of his successors, a perpetual oath of fidelity; and gratefully accepted a seal, which was bestowed as the emblem of his regal dependence.  After this humiliating submission, the Tanjous sometimes departed from their allegiance and seized the favorable moments of war and rapine; but the monarchy of the Huns gradually declined, till it was broken, by civil dissension, into two hostile and separate kingdoms.  One of the princes of the nation was urged, by fear and ambition, to retire towards the South with eight hords, which composed between forty and fifty thousand families. He obtained, with the title of Tanjou, a convenient territory on the verge of the Chinese provinces; and his constant attachment to the service of the empire was secured by weakness, and the desire of revenge.  From the time of this fatal schism, the Huns of the North continued to languish about fifty years; till they were oppressed on every side by their foreign and domestic enemies.  The proud inscription  <a name="fr_1549"></a><a href="#fn_1548"><font size="1">41</font></a> of a column, erected on a lofty mountain, announced to posterity, that a Chinese army had marched seven hundred miles into the heart of their country.  The Sienpi,  <a name="fr_1550"></a><a href="#fn_1549"><font size="1">42</font></a> a tribe of Oriental Tartars, retaliated the injuries which they had formerly sustained; and the power of the Tanjous, after a reign of thirteen hundred years, was utterly destroyed before the end of the first century of the Christian aera.  <a name="fr_1551"></a><a href="#fn_1550"><font size="1">43</font></a> </p>

 <p>     The fate of the vanquished Huns was diversified by the various influence of character and situation.  <a name="fr_1552"></a><a href="#fn_1551"><font size="1">44</font></a> Above one hundred thousand persons, the poorest, indeed, and the most pusillanimous of the people, were contented to remain in their native country, to renounce their peculiar name and origin, and to mingle with the victorious nation of the Sienpi.  Fifty-eight hords, about two hundred thousand men, ambitious of a more honorable servitude, retired towards the South; implored the protection of the emperors of China; and were permitted to inhabit, and to guard, the extreme frontiers of the province of Chansi and the territory of Ortous.  But the most warlike and powerful tribes of the Huns maintained, in their adverse fortune, the undaunted spirit of their ancestors.  The Western world was open to their valor; and they resolved, under the conduct of their hereditary chieftains, to conquer and subdue some remote country, which was still inaccessible to the arms of the Sienpi, and to the laws of China.  <a name="fr_1553"></a><a href="#fn_1552"><font size="1">45</font></a> The course of their emigration soon carried them beyond the mountains of Imaus, and the limits of the Chinese geography; but we are able to distinguish the two great divisions of these formidable exiles, which directed their march towards the Oxus, and towards the Volga.  The first of these colonies established their dominion in the fruitful and extensive plains of Sogdiana, on the eastern side of the Caspian; where they preserved the name of Huns, with the epithet of Euthalites, or Nepthalites.  <a name="fr_1554"></a><a href="#fn_1553"><font size="1">*_0086</font></a> Their manners were softened, and even their features were insensibly improved, by the mildness of the climate, and their long residence in a flourishing province,  <a name="fr_1555"></a><a href="#fn_1554"><font size="1">46</font></a> which might still retain a faint impression of the arts of Greece.  <a name="fr_1556"></a><a href="#fn_1555"><font size="1">47</font></a> The white Huns, a name which they derived from the change of their complexions, soon abandoned the pastoral life of Scythia.  Gorgo, which, under the appellation of Carizme, has since enjoyed a temporary splendor, was the residence of the king, who exercised a legal authority over an obedient people.  Their luxury was maintained by the labor of the Sogdians; and the only vestige of their ancient barbarism, was the custom which obliged all the companions, perhaps to the number of twenty, who had shared the liberality of a wealthy lord, to be buried alive in the same grave.  <a name="fr_1557"></a><a href="#fn_1556"><font size="1">48</font></a> The vicinity of the Huns to the provinces of Persia, involved them in frequent and bloody contests with the power of that monarchy.  But they respected, in peace, the faith of treaties; in war, she dictates of humanity; and their memorable victory over Peroses, or Firuz, displayed the moderation, as well as the valor, of the Barbarians.  The second division of their countrymen, the Huns, who gradually advanced towards the North-west, were exercised by the hardships of a colder climate, and a more laborious march.  Necessity compelled them to exchange the silks of China for the furs of Siberia; the imperfect rudiments of civilized life were obliterated; and the native fierceness of the Huns was exasperated by their intercourse with the savage tribes, who were compared, with some propriety, to the wild beasts of the desert.  Their independent spirit soon rejected the hereditary succession of the Tanjous; and while each horde was governed by its peculiar mursa, their tumultuary council directed the public measures of the whole nation.  As late as the thirteenth century, their transient residence on the eastern banks of the Volga was attested by the name of Great Hungary.  <a name="fr_1558"></a><a href="#fn_1557"><font size="1">49</font></a> In the winter, they descended with their flocks and herds towards the mouth of that mighty river; and their summer excursions reached as high as the latitude of Saratoff, or perhaps the conflux of the Kama.  Such at least were the recent limits of the black Calmucks,  <a name="fr_1559"></a><a href="#fn_1558"><font size="1">50</font></a> who remained about a century under the protection of Russia; and who have since returned to their native seats on the frontiers of the Chinese empire.  The march, and the return, of those wandering Tartars, whose united camp consists of fifty thousand tents or families, illustrate the distant emigrations of the ancient Huns.  <a name="fr_1560"></a><a href="#fn_1559"><font size="1">51</font></a>

        It is impossible to fill the dark interval of time, which elapsed, after the Huns of the Volga were lost in the eyes of the Chinese, and before they showed themselves to those of the Romans.  There is some reason, however, to apprehend, that the same force which had driven them from their native seats, still continued to impel their march towards the frontiers of Europe.  The power of the Sienpi, their implacable enemies, which extended above three thousand miles from East to West,  <a name="fr_1561"></a><a href="#fn_1560"><font size="1">52</font></a> must have gradually oppressed them by the weight and terror of a formidable neighborhood; and the flight of the tribes of Scythia would inevitably tend to increase the strength or to contract the territories, of the Huns.  The harsh and obscure appellations of those tribes would offend the ear, without informing the understanding, of the reader; but I cannot suppress the very natural suspicion, that the Huns of the North derived a considerable reenforcement from the ruin of the dynasty of the South, which, in the course of the third century, submitted to the dominion of China; that the bravest warriors marched away in search of their free and adventurous countrymen; and that, as they had been divided by prosperity, they were easily reunited by the common hardships of their adverse fortune.  <a name="fr_1562"></a><a href="#fn_1561"><font size="1">53</font></a> The Huns, with their flocks and herds, their wives and children, their dependents and allies, were transported to the west of the Volga, and they boldly advanced to invade the country of the Alani, a pastoral people, who occupied, or wasted, an extensive tract of the deserts of Scythia.  The plains between the Volga and the Tanais were covered with the tents of the Alani, but their name and manners were diffused over the wide extent of their conquests; and the painted tribes of the Agathyrsi and Geloni were confounded among their vassals.  Towards the North, they penetrated into the frozen regions of Siberia, among the savages who were accustomed, in their rage or hunger, to the taste of human flesh; and their Southern inroads were pushed as far as the confines of Persia and India.  The mixture of Samartic and German blood had contributed to improve the features of the Alani,  <a name="fr_1563"></a><a href="#fn_1562"><font size="1">*_0087</font></a> to whiten their swarthy complexions, and to tinge their hair with a yellowish cast, which is seldom found in the Tartar race. They were less deformed in their persons, less brutish in their manners, than the Huns; but they did not yield to those formidable Barbarians in their martial and independent spirit; in the love of freedom, which rejected even the use of domestic slaves; and in the love of arms, which considered war and rapine as the pleasure and the glory of mankind.  A naked cimeter, fixed in the ground, was the only object of their religious worship; the scalps of their enemies formed the costly trappings of their horses; and they viewed, with pity and contempt, the pusillanimous warriors, who patiently expected the infirmities of age, and the tortures of lingering disease.  <a name="fr_1564"></a><a href="#fn_1563"><font size="1">54</font></a> On the banks of the Tanais, the military power of the Huns and the Alani encountered each other with equal valor, but with unequal success.  The Huns prevailed in the bloody contest; the king of the Alani was slain; and the remains of the vanquished nation were dispersed by the ordinary alternative of flight or submission.  <a name="fr_1565"></a><a href="#fn_1564"><font size="1">55</font></a> A colony of exiles found a secure refuge in the mountains of Caucasus, between the Euxine and the Caspian, where they still preserve their name and their independence. Another colony advanced, with more intrepid courage, towards the shores of the Baltic; associated themselves with the Northern tribes of Germany; and shared the spoil of the Roman provinces of Gaul and Spain.  But the greatest part of the nation of the Alani embraced the offers of an honorable and advantageous union; and the Huns, who esteemed the valor of their less fortunate enemies, proceeded, with an increase of numbers and confidence, to invade the limits of the Gothic empire. </p>

 <p>     The great Hermanric, whose dominions extended from the Baltic to the Euxine, enjoyed, in the full maturity of age and reputation, the fruit of his victories, when he was alarmed by the formidable approach of a host of unknown enemies,  <a name="fr_1566"></a><a href="#fn_1565"><font size="1">56</font></a> on whom his barbarous subjects might, without injustice, bestow the epithet of Barbarians.  The numbers, the strength, the rapid motions, and the implacable cruelty of the Huns, were felt, and dreaded, and magnified, by the astonished Goths; who beheld their fields and villages consumed with flames, and deluged with indiscriminate slaughter.  To these real terrors they added the surprise and abhorrence which were excited by the shrill voice, the uncouth gestures, and the strange deformity of the Huns.  <a name="fr_1567"></a><a href="#fn_1566"><font size="1">*_0088</font></a> These savages of Scythia were compared (and the picture had some resemblance) to the animals who walk very awkwardly on two legs and to the misshapen figures, the Termini, which were often placed on the bridges of antiquity.  They were distinguished from the rest of the human species by their broad shoulders, flat noses, and small black eyes, deeply buried in the head; and as they were almost destitute of beards, they never enjoyed either the manly grace of youth, or the venerable aspect of age.  <a name="fr_1568"></a><a href="#fn_1567"><font size="1">57</font></a> A fabulous origin was assigned, worthy of their form and manners; that the witches of Scythia, who, for their foul and deadly practices, had been driven from society, had copulated in the desert with infernal spirits; and that the Huns were the offspring of this execrable conjunction.  <a name="fr_1569"></a><a href="#fn_1568"><font size="1">58</font></a> The tale, so full of horror and absurdity, was greedily embraced by the credulous hatred of the Goths; but, while it gratified their hatred, it increased their fear, since the posterity of daemons and witches might be supposed to inherit some share of the praeternatural powers, as well as of the malignant temper, of their parents.  Against these enemies, Hermanric prepared to exert the united forces of the Gothic state; but he soon discovered that his vassal tribes, provoked by oppression, were much more inclined to second, than to repel, the invasion of the Huns.  One of the chiefs of the Roxolani  <a name="fr_1570"></a><a href="#fn_1569"><font size="1">59</font></a> had formerly deserted the standard of Hermanric, and the cruel tyrant had condemned the innocent wife of the traitor to be torn asunder by wild horses.  The brothers of that unfortunate woman seized the favorable moment of revenge.  The aged king of the Goths languished some time after the dangerous wound which he received from their daggers; but the conduct of the war was retarded by his infirmities; and the public councils of the nation were distracted by a spirit of jealousy and discord.  His death, which has been imputed to his own despair, left the reins of government in the hands of Withimer, who, with the doubtful aid of some Scythian mercenaries, maintained the unequal contest against the arms of the Huns and the Alani, till he was defeated and slain in a decisive battle.  The Ostrogoths submitted to their fate; and the royal race of the Amali will hereafter be found among the subjects of the haughty Attila.  But the person of Witheric, the infant king, was saved by the diligence of Alatheus and Saphrax; two warriors of approved valor and fiedlity, who, by cautious marches, conducted the independent remains of the nation of the Ostrogoths towards the Danastus, or Niester; a considerable river, which now separates the Turkish dominions from the empire of Russia.  On the banks of the Niester, the prudent Athanaric, more attentive to his own than to the general safety, had fixed the camp of the Visigoths; with the firm resolution of opposing the victorious Barbarians, whom he thought it less advisable to provoke.  The ordinary speed of the Huns was checked by the weight of baggage, and the encumbrance of captives; but their military skill deceived, and almost destroyed, the army of Athanaric.  While the Judge of the Visigoths defended the banks of the Niester, he was encompassed and attacked by a numerous detachment of cavalry, who, by the light of the moon, had passed the river in a fordable place; and it was not without the utmost efforts of courage and conduct, that he was able to effect his retreat towards the hilly country.  The undaunted general had already formed a new and judicious plan of defensive war; and the strong lines, which he was preparing to construct between the mountains, the Pruth, and the Danube, would have secured the extensive and fertile territory that bears the modern name of Walachia, from the destructive inroads of the Huns.  <a name="fr_1571"></a><a href="#fn_1570"><font size="1">60</font></a> But the hopes and measures of the Judge of the Visigoths was soon disappointed, by the trembling impatience of his dismayed countrymen; who were persuaded by their fears, that the interposition of the Danube was the only barrier that could save them from the rapid pursuit, and invincible valor, of the Barbarians of Scythia. Under the command of Fritigern and Alavivus,  <a name="fr_1572"></a><a href="#fn_1571"><font size="1">61</font></a> the body of the nation hastily advanced to the banks of the great river, and implored the protection of the Roman emperor of the East.  Athanaric himself, still anxious to avoid the guilt of perjury, retired, with a band of faithful followers, into the mountainous country of Caucaland; which appears to have been guarded, and almost concealed, by the impenetrable forests of Transylvania.  <a name="fr_1573"></a><a href="#fn_1572"><font size="1">62</font></a>  <a name="fr_1574"></a><a href="#fn_1573"><font size="1">**_0088</font></a> </p>

 <p><a name="fn_1533"></a><a href="daf02056.htm#fr_1534">27</a> M. de Guignes (tom. ii. p. 1 - 124) has given the original history of the ancient Hiong-nou, or Huns.  The Chinese geography of their country (tom. i. part. p. lv. - lxiii.) seems to comprise a part of their conquests. </p> 
 <p>     Note: The theory of De Guignes on the early history of the Huns is, in general, rejected by modern writers.  De Guignes advanced no valid proof of the identity of the Hioung-nou of the Chinese writers with the Huns, except the similarity of name. </p> 
 <p>     Schlozer, (Allgemeine Nordische Geschichte, p. 252,) Klaproth, (Tableaux Historiques de l'Asie, p. 246,) St. Martin, iv. 61, and A. Remusat, (Recherches sur les Langues Tartares, D. P. xlvi, and p. 328; though in the latter passage he considers the theory of De Guignes not absolutely disproved,) concur in considering the Huns as belonging to the Finnish stock, distinct from the Moguls the Mandscheus, and the Turks.  The Hiong-nou, according to Klaproth, were Turks.  The names of the Hunnish chiefs could not be pronounced by a Turk; and, according to the same author, the Hioung-nou, which is explained in Chinese as detestable slaves, as early as the year 91 J. C., were dispersed by the Chinese, and assumed the name of Yue-po or Yue-pan. M. St. Martin does not consider it impossible that the appellation of Hioung-nou may have belonged to the Huns.  But all agree in considering the Madjar or Magyar of modern Hungary the descendants of the Huns.  Their language (compare Gibbon, c. lv. n. 22) is nearly related to the Lapponian and Vogoul.  The noble forms of the modern Hungarians, so strongly contrasted with the hideous pictures which the fears and the hatred of the Romans give of the Huns, M. Klaproth accounts for by the intermingling with other races, Turkish and Slavonian. The present state of the question is thus stated in the last edition of Malte Brun, and a new and ingenious hypothesis suggested to resolve all the difficulties of the question. </p> 
 <p>     Were the Huns Finns?  This obscure question has not been debated till very recently, and is yet very far from being decided.  We are of opinion that it will be so hereafter in the same manner as that with regard to the Scythians.  We shall trace in the portrait of Attila a dominant tribe or Mongols, or Kalmucks, with all the hereditary ugliness of that race; but in the mass of the Hunnish army and nation will be recognized the Chuni and the Ounni of the Greek Geography.  the Kuns of the Hungarians, the European Huns, and a race in close relationship with the Flemish stock.  Malte Brun, vi. p. 94.  This theory is more fully and ably developed, p. 743.  Whoever has seen the emperor of Austria's Hungarian guard, will not readily admit their descent from the Huns described by Sidonius Appolinaris. - M</p>

In the next century, the same provinces of Chorasmia and Nawaralnahr were described by Abulfeda, (Hudson, Geograph. Minor. tom. iii.)

To their industry I should ascribe the new and extraordinary trade, which transported the merchandises of India into Europe, by the Oxus, the Caspian, the Cyrus, the Phasis, and the Euxine. The other ways, both of the land and sea, were possessed by the Seleucides and the Ptolemies.  (See l'Esprit des Loix, l. xxi.)</p>

The original narrative of Kien-long, the reigning emperor of China, which was intended for the inscription of a column, has been translated by the missionaries of Pekin, (Memoires sur la Chine, tom. i. p. 401 - 418.) The emperor affects the smooth and specious language of the Son of Heaven, and the Father of his People.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1560"></a><a href="daf02056.htm#fr_1561">52</a> The Khan-Mou (tom. iii. p. 447) ascribes to their conquests a space of 14,000 lis.  According to the present standard, 200 lis (or more accurately 193) are equal to one degree of latitude; and one English mile consequently exceeds three miles of China.  But there are strong reasons to believe that the ancient li scarcely equalled one half of the modern.  See the elaborate researches of M. D'Anville, a geographer who is not a stranger in any age or climate of the globe.  (Memoires de l'Acad. tom. ii. p. 125-502.  Itineraires, p. 154-167.</p>

He supposes them to have been the people, known by the Chinese, at the time of their first expeditions to the West, under the name of Yath-sai or A-lanna, the Alanan of Persian tradition, as preserved in Ferdusi; the same, according to Ammianus, with the Massagetae, and with the Albani.  The remains of the nation still exist in the Ossetae of Mount Caucasus. Klaproth, Tableaux Historiques de l'Asie, p. 174. - M.  Compare Shafarik Slawische alterthumer, i. p. 350. - M. 1845.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_1564"></a><a href="daf02056.htm#fr_1565">55</a> On the subject of the Alani, see Ammianus, (xxxi. 2,) Jornandes, (de Rebus Geticis, c. 24,) M. de Guignes, (Hist. des Huns, tom. ii. p. 279,) and the Genealogical History of the Tartars, (tom. ii. p. 617.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1565"></a><a href="daf02056.htm#fr_1566">56</a> As we are possessed of the authentic history of the Huns, it would be impertinent to repeat, or to refute, the fables which misrepresent their origin and progress, their passage of the mud or water of the Maeotis, in pursuit of an ox or stag, les Indes qu'ils avoient decouvertes, &amp;c., (Zosimus, l. iv. p. 224.  Sozomen, l. vi. c. 37.  Procopius, Hist. Miscell. c. 5. Jornandes, c. 24.  Grandeur et Decadence, &amp;c., des Romains, c. 17.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1566"></a><a href="daf02056.htm#fr_1567">*_0088</a> Art added to their native ugliness; in fact, it is difficult to ascribe the proper share in the features of this hideous picture to nature, to the barbarous skill with which they were self-disfigured, or to the terror and hatred of the Romans.  Their noses were flattened by their nurses, their cheeks were gashed by an iron instrument, that the scars might look more fearful, and prevent the growth of the beard.  Jornandes and Sidonius Apollinaris: - </p> 
 <p>     Obtundit teneras circumdata fascia nares,      Ut galeis cedant. </p> 
 <p>Yet he adds that their forms were robust and manly, their height of a middle size, but, from the habit of riding, disproportioned.       Stant pectora vasta,      Insignes humer, succincta sub ilibus alvus.      Forma quidem pediti media est, procera sed extat      Si cernas equites, sic longi saepe putantur      Si sedeant.</p>

Hist. Naturelle, tom. iii. 380.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1568"></a><a href="daf02056.htm#fr_1569">58</a> This execrable origin, which Jornandes (c. 24) describes with the rancor of a Goth, might be originally derived from a more pleasing fable of the Greeks.  (Herodot. l. iv. c. 9, &amp;c.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1569"></a><a href="daf02056.htm#fr_1570">59</a> The Roxolani may be the fathers of the the Russians, (D'Anville, Empire de Russie, p. 1 - 10,) whose residence (A.D. 862) about Novogrod Veliki cannot be very remote from that which the Geographer of Ravenna (i. 12, iv. 4, 46, v. 28, 30) assigns to the Roxolani, (A.D. 886.) </p>

 <p><a name="fn_1570"></a><a href="daf02056.htm#fr_1571">60</a> The text of Ammianus seems to be imperfect or corrupt; but the nature of the ground explains, and almost defines, the Gothic rampart. Memoires de l'Academie, &amp;c., tom. xxviii. p. 444 - 462.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1571"></a><a href="daf02056.htm#fr_1572">61</a> M. de Buat (Hist. des Peuples de l'Europe, tom. vi. p. 407) has conceived a strange idea, that Alavivus was the same person as Ulphilas, the Gothic bishop; and that Ulphilas, the grandson of a Cappadocian captive, became a temporal prince of the Goths.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1572"></a><a href="daf02056.htm#fr_1573">62</a> Ammianus (xxxi. 3) and Jornandes (de Rebus Geticis, c. 24) describe the subversion of the Gothic empire by the Huns.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1573"></a><a href="daf02056.htm#fr_1574">**_0088</a> The most probable opinion as to the position of this land is that of M. Malte-Brun.  He thinks that Caucaland is the territory of the Cacoenses, placed by Ptolemy (l. iii. c. 8) towards the Carpathian Mountains, on the side of the present Transylvania, and therefore the canton of Cacava, to the south of Hermanstadt, the capital of the principality.  Caucaland it is evident, is the Gothic form of these different names.  St. Martin, iv 103. - M.</p>
