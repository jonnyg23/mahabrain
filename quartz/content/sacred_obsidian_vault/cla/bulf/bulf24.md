 <h2 align="CENTER">ARION- IBYCUS- SIMONIDES- SAPPHO.</h2>
 
 <p>THE poets whose adventures compose this chapter were real persons
 some of whose works yet remain, and their influence on poets who
 succeeded them is yet more important than their poetical remains.
 The adventures recorded of them in the following stories rest on the
 same authority as other narratives of the "Age of Fable," that is,
 of the poets who have told them. In their present form, the first
 two are translated from the German, Arion from Schlegel, and Ibycus
 from Schiller.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ARION.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Arion was a famous musician, and dwelt at the court of Periander,
 king of Corinth, with whom he was a great favourite. There was to be a
 musical contest in Sicily, and Arion longed to compete for the
 prize, He told his wish to Periander, who besought him like a
 brother to give up the thought. "Pray stay with me," he said, "and
 be contented. He who strives to win may lose." Arion answered, "A
 wandering life best suits the free heart of a poet. The talent which a
 god bestowed on me, I would fain make a source of pleasure to
 others. And if I win the prize, how will the enjoyment of it be
 increased by the consciousness of my widespread fame!" He went, won
 the prize, and embarked with his wealth in a Corinthian ship for home.
 On the second morning after setting sail, the wind breathed mild and
 fair. "O Periander," he exclaimed, "dismiss your fears! Soon shall you
 forget them in my embrace. With what lavish offerings will we
 display our gratitude to the gods, and how merry will we be at the
 festal board!" The wind and sea continued propitious. Not a cloud
 dimmed the firmament. He had not trusted too much to the ocean- but he
 had to man. He overheard the seamen exchanging hints with one another,
 and found they were plotting to possess themselves of his treasure.
 Presently they surrounded him loud and mutinous, and said, "Arion, you
 must die! If you would have a grave on shore, yield yourself to die on
 this spot; but if otherwise, cast yourself into the sea." "Will
 nothing satisfy you but my life?" said he. "Take my gold, and welcome,
 I willingly buy my life at that price." "No, no; we cannot spare
 you. Your life would be too dangerous to us. Where could we go to
 escape from Periander, if he should know that you had been robbed by
 us? Your gold would be of little use to us, if, on returning home,
 we could never more be free from fear." "Grant me, then," said he,
 "a last request, since nought will avail to save my life, that I may
 die, as I have lived, as becomes a bard. When I shall have sung my
 death song, and my harp-strings shall have ceased to vibrate, then I
 will bid farewell to life, and yield uncomplaining to my fate." This
 prayer, like the others, would have been unheeded,- they thought
 only of their booty,- but to hear so famous a musician, that moved
 their rude hearts. "Suffer me," he added, "to arrange my dress. Apollo
 will not favour me unless I be clad in my minstrel garb."
 </p>
 <p>He clothed his well-proportioned limbs in gold and purple fair to
 see, his tunic fell around him in graceful folds, jewels adorned his
 arms, his brow was crowned with a golden wreath, and over his neck and
 shoulders flowed his hair perfumed with odours. His left hand held the
 lyre, his right the ivory wand with which he struck its chords. Like
 one inspired, he seemed to drink the morning air and glitter in the
 morning ray. The seamen gazed with admiration. He strode forward to
 the vessel's side and looked down into the deep blue sea. Addressing
 his lyre, he sang, "Companion of my voice, come with me to the realm
 of shades. Though Cerberus may growl, we know the power of song can
 tame his rage. Ye heroes of Elysium, who have passed the darkling
 flood,- ye happy souls, soon shall I join your band. Yet can ye
 relieve my grief? Alas, I leave my friend behind me. Thou, who didst
 find thy Eurydice, and lose her again as soon as found; when she had
 vanished like a dream, how didst thou hate the cheerful light! I
 must away, but I will not fear. The gods look down upon us. Ye who
 slay me unoffending, when I am no more, your time of trembling shall
 come. Ye Nereids, receive your guest, who throws himself upon your
 mercy!" So saying, he sprang into the deep sea. The waves covered him,
 and the seamen held on their way, fancying themselves safe from all
 danger of detection.
 </p>
 <p>But the strains of his music had drawn round him the inhabitants
 of the deep to listen, and Dolphins followed the ship as if chained by
 a spell. While he struggled in the waves, a Dolphin offered him his
 back, and carried him mounted thereon safe to shore. At the spot where
 he landed, a monument of brass was afterwards erected upon the rocky
 shore, to preserve the memory of the event.
 </p>
 <p>When Arion and the dolphin parted, each to his own element, Arion
 thus poured forth his thanks: "Farewell, thou faithful, friendly fish!
 Would that I could reward thee; but thou canst not wend with me, nor I
 with thee. Companionship we may not have. May Galatea, queen of the
 deep, accord thee her favour, and thou, proud of the burden, draw
 her chariot over the smooth mirror of the deep."
 </p>
 <p>Arion hastened from the shore, and soon saw before him the towers of
 Corinth. He journeyed on, harp in hand, singing as he went, full of
 love and happiness, forgetting his losses, and mindful only of what
 remained, his friend and his lyre. He entered the hospitable halls,
 and was soon clasped in the embrace of Periander. "I come back to
 thee, my friend," he said. "The talent which a god bestowed has been
 the delight of thousands, but false knaves have stripped me of my
 well-earned treasure; yet I retain the consciousness of widespread
 fame." Then he told Periander all the wonderful events that had
 befallen him, who heard him with amazement. "Shall such wickedness
 triumph?" said he. "Then in vain is power lodged in my hands. That
 we may discover the criminals, you must remain here in concealment,
 and so they will approach without suspicion." When the ship. arrived
 in the harbour, he summoned the mariners before him. "Have you heard
 anything of Arion?" he inquired. "I anxiously look for his return."
 They replied, "We left him well and prosperous in Tarentum." As they
 said these words, Arion stepped forth and faced them. His
 well-proportioned limbs were arrayed in gold and purple fair to see,
 his tunic fell around him in graceful folds, jewels adorned his
 arms, his brow was crowned with a golden wreath, and over his neck and
 shoulders flowed his hair perfumed with odours; his left hand held the
 lyre, his right the ivory wand with which he struck its chords. They
 fell prostrate at his feet, as if a lightning bolt had struck them.
 "We meant to murder him, and he has become a god. O Earth, open and
 receive us!" Then Periander spoke. "He lives, the master of the lay!
 Kind Heaven protects the poet's life. As for you, I invoke not the
 spirit of vengeance; Arion wishes not your blood. Ye slaves of
 avarice, begone! Seek some barbarous land, and never may aught
 beautiful delight your souls!"
 
 </p>
 <p>Spenser represents Arion, mounted on his dolphin, accompanying the
 train of Neptune and Amphitrite:
 
 </p>
         "Then was there heard a most celestial sound<br>
          Of dainty music which did next ensue,<br>
          And, on the floating waters as enthroned,<br>
          Arion with his harp unto him drew<br>
          The ears and hearts of all that goodly crew;<br>
          Even when as yet the dolphin which him bore<br>
          Through the AEgean Seas from pirates' view,<br>
          Stood still, by him astonished at his lore,<br>
          And all the raging seas for joy forgot to roar."<br>
 
 <p>Byron, in his "Childe Harold," Canto II., alludes to the story of
 Arion, when, describing his voyage, he represents one of the seamen
 making music to entertain the rest:
 
 </p>
         "The moon is up; by Heaven a lovely eve!<br>
          Long streams of light o'er dancing waves expand;<br>
          Now lads on shore may sigh and maids believe;<br>
          Such be our fate when we return to land!<br>
          Meantime some rude Arion's restless hand<br>
          Wakes the brisk harmony that sailors love;<br>
          A circle there of merry listeners stand,<br>
          Or to some well-known measure featly move<br>
          Thoughtless as if on shore they still were free to rove."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">IBYCUS.</h3>
 
 <p>In order to understand the story of Ibycus which follows it is
 necessary to remember, first, that the theatres of the ancients were
 immense fabrics capable of containing from ten to thirty thousand
 spectators, and as they were used only on festal occasions, and
 admission was free to all, they were usually filled. They were without
 roofs and open to the sky, and the performances were in the daytime.
 Secondly, the appalling representation of the Furies is not
 exaggerated in the story. It is recorded that AEschylus, the tragic
 poet, having on one occasion represented the Furies in a chorus of
 fifty performers, the terror of the spectators was such that many
 fainted and were thrown into convulsions, and the magistrates
 forbade a like representation for the future.
 </p>
 <p>Ibycus, the pious poet, was on his way to the chariot races and
 musical competitions held at the Isthmus of Corinth, which attracted
 all of Grecian lineage. Apollo had bestowed on him the gift of song,
 the honeyed lips of the poet, and he pursued his way with lightsome
 step, full of the god. Already the towers of Corinth crowning the
 height appeared in view, and he had entered with pious awe the
 sacred grove of Neptune. No living object was in sight, only a flock
 of cranes flew overhead taking the same course as himself in their
 migration to a southern clime. "Good luck to you, ye friendly
 squadrons," he exclaimed, "my companions from across the sea. I take
 your company for a good omen. We come from far and fly in search of
 hospitality. May both of us meet that kind reception which shields the
 stranger guest from harm!"
 </p>
 <p>He paced briskly on, and soon was in the middle of the wood. There
 suddenly, at a narrow pass, two robbers stepped forth and barred his
 way. He must yield or fight. But his hand, accustomed to the lyre, and
 not to the strife of arms, sank powerless. He called for help on men
 and gods, but his cry reached no defender's ear. "Then here must I
 die," said he, "in a strange land, unlamented, cut off by the hand
 of outlaws, and see none to avenge my, cause." Sore wounded, he sank
 to the earth, when hoarse screamed the cranes overhead. "Take up my
 cause, ye cranes," he said, "since no voice but yours answers to my
 cry." So saying he closed his eyes in death.
 </p>
 <p>The body, despoiled and mangled, was found, and though disfigured
 with wounds, was recognized by the friend in Corinth who had
 expected him as a guest. "Is it thus I find you restored to me?" he
 exclaimed. "I who hoped to entwine your temples with the wreath of
 triumph in the strife of song!"
 </p>
 <p>The guests assembled at the festival heard the tidings with
 dismay. All Greece felt the wound, every heart owned its loss. They
 crowded round the tribunal of the magistrates, and demanded
 vengeance on the murderers and expiation with their blood.
 </p>
 <p>But what trace or mark shall point out the perpetrator from amidst
 the vast multitude attracted by the splendour of the feast? Did he
 fall by the hands of robbers or did some private enemy slay him? The
 all-discerning sun alone can tell, for no other eye beheld it. Yet not
 improbably the murderer even now walks in the midst of the throng, and
 enjoys the fruits of his crime, while vengeance seeks for him in vain.
 Perhaps in their own temple's enclosure he defies the gods, mingling
 freely in this throng of men that now presses into the amphitheatre.
 </p>
 <p>For now crowded together, row on row, the multitude fills the
 seats till it seems as if the very fabric would give way. The murmur
 of voices sounds like the roar of the sea, while the circles
 widening in their ascent rise tier on tier, as if they would reach the
 sky.
 </p>
 <p>And now the vast assemblage listens to the awful voice of the chorus
 personating the Furies, which in solemn guise advances with measured
 step, and moves around the circuit of the theatre. Can they be
 mortal women who compose that awful group, and can that vast concourse
 of silent forms be living beings?
 </p>
 <p>The choristers, clad in black, bore in their fleshless hands torches
 blazing with a pitchy flame. Their cheeks were bloodless, and in place
 of hair writhing and swelling serpents curled around their brows.
 Forming a circle, these awful beings sang their hymns, rending the
 hearts of the guilty, and enchaining all their faculties. It rose
 and swelled, overpowering the sound of the instruments, stealing the
 judgment, palsying the heart, curdling the blood.
 </p>
 <p>"Happy the man who keeps his heart pure from guilt and crime! Him we
 avengers touch not; he treads the path of life secure from us. But
 woe! woe! to him who has done the deed of secret murder. We, the
 fearful family of Night, fasten ourselves upon his whole being. Thinks
 he by flight to escape us? We fly still faster in pursuit, twine our
 snakes around his feet, and bring him to the ground. Unwearied we
 pursue; no pity checks our course; still on and on, to the end of
 life, we give him no peace nor rest." Thus the Eumenides sang, and
 moved in solemn cadence, while stillness like the stillness of death
 sat over the whole assembly as if in the presence of superhuman
 beings; and then in solemn march completing the circuit of the
 theatre, they passed out at the back of the stage.
 </p>
 <p>Every heart fluttered between illusion and reality, and every breast
 panted with undefined terror, quailing before the awful power that
 watches secret crimes and winds unseen the skein of destiny. At that
 moment a cry burst forth from one of the uppermost benches- "Look!
 look! comrade, yonder are the cranes of Ibycus!" And suddenly there
 appeared sailing across the sky a dark object which a moment's
 inspection showed to be a flock of cranes flying directly over the
 theatre. "Of Ibycus! did he say?" The beloved name revived the
 sorrow in every breast. As wave follows wave over the face of the sea,
 so ran from mouth to mouth the words, "Of Ibycus! him whom we all
 lament, whom some murderer's hand laid low! What have the cranes to do
 with him?" And louder grew the swell of voices, while like a
 lightning's flash the thought sped through every heart, "Observe the
 power of the Eumenides! The pious poet shall be avenged! the
 murderer has informed against himself. Seize the man who uttered
 that cry and the other to whom he spoke!"
 </p>
 <p>The culprit would gladly have recalled his words, but it was too
 late. The faces of the murderers, pale with terror, betrayed their
 guilt. The people took them before the judge, they confessed their
 crime, and suffered the punishment they deserved.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">SIMONIDES.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Simonides was one of the most prolific of the early poets of Greece,
 but only a few fragments of his compositions have descended to us.
 He wrote hymns, triumphal odes, and elegies. In the last species of
 composition he particularly excelled. His genius was inclined to the
 pathetic, and none could touch with truer effect the chords of human
 sympathy. The "Lamentation of Danae," the most important of the
 fragments which remain of his poetry, is based upon the tradition that
 Danae and her infant son were confined by order of her father,
 Acrisius, in a chest and set adrift on the sea. The chest floated
 towards the island of Seriphus, where both were rescued by Dictys, a
 fisherman, and carried to Polydectes, king of the country, who
 received and protected them. The child, Perseus, when grown up
 became a famous hero, whose adventures have been recorded in a
 previous chapter.
 </p>
 <p>Simonides passed much of his life at the courts of princes, and
 often employed his talents in panegyric and festal odes, receiving his
 reward from the munificence of those whose exploits he celebrated.
 This employment was not derogatory, but closely resembles that of
 the earliest bards, such as Demodocus, described by Homer, or of Homer
 himself, as recorded by tradition.
 </p>
 <p>On one occasion, when residing at the court of Scopas, king of
 Thessaly, the prince desired him to prepare a poem in celebration of
 his exploits, to be recited at a banquet. In order to diversify his
 theme, Simonides, who was celebrated for his piety, introduced into
 his poem the exploits of Castor and Pollux. Such digressions were
 not unusual with the poets on similar occasions, and one might suppose
 an ordinary mortal might have been content to share the praises of the
 sons of Leda. But vanity is exacting; and as Scopas sat at his
 festal board among his courtiers and sycophants, he grudged every
 verse that did not rehearse his own praises. When Simonides approached
 to receive the promised reward Scopas bestowed but half the expected
 sum, saying, "Here is payment for my portion of thy performance;
 Castor and Pollux will doubtless compensate thee for so much as
 relates to them." The disconcerted poet returned to his seat amidst
 the laughter which followed the great man's jest. In a little time
 he received a message that two young men on horseback were waiting
 without and anxious to see him. Simonides hastened to the door, but
 looked in vain for the visitors. Scarcely, however, had he left the
 banqueting hall when the roof fell in with a loud crash, burying
 Scopas and all his guests beneath the ruins. On inquiring as to the
 appearance of the young men who had sent for him, Simonides was
 satisfied that they were no other than Castor and Pollux themselves.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">SAPPHO.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Sappho was a poetess who flourished in a very early age of Greek
 literature. Of her works few fragments remain, but they are enough
 to establish her claim to eminent poetical genius. The story of Sappho
 commonly alluded to is that she was passionately in love with a
 beautiful youth named Phaon, and failing to obtain a return of
 affection she threw herself from the promontory of Leucadia into the
 sea, under a superstition that those who should take that
 "Lover's-leap" would, if not destroyed, be cured of their love.
 
 </p>
 <p>Byron alludes to the story of Sappho in "Childe Harold," Canto II.:
 
 </p>
           "Childe Harold sailed and passed the barren spot<br>
            Where sad Penelope o'erlooked the wave,<br>
            And onward viewed the mount, not yet forgot,<br>
            The lover's refuge and the Lesbian's grave.<br>
            Dark Sappho! could not verse immortal save<br>
            That breast imbued with such immortal fire?<br>
 
           "'Twas on a Grecian autumn's gentle eve<br>
            Childe Harold hailed Leucadia's cape afar; etc.<br>
 
 <p>Those who wish to know more of Sappho and her "leap" are referred to
 the "Spectator," Nos. 223 and 229. See also Moore's "Evenings in
 Greece."
