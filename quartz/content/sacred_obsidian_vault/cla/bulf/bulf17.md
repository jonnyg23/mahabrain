 <h2 align="CENTER">MELEAGER AND ATALANTA.</h2>
 
 <p>ONE of the heroes of the Argonautic expedition was Meleager, son
 of OEneus and Althea, king and queen of Calydon. Althea, when her
 son was born, beheld the three destinies, who as they spun their fatal
 thread, foretold that the life of the child should last no longer than
 a brand then burning upon the hearth. Althea seized and quenched the
 brand, and carefully preserved it for years, while Meleager grew to
 boyhood, youth and manhood. It chanced, then, that OEneus, as he
 offered sacrifices to the gods, omitted to pay due honours to Diana;
 and she, indignant at the neglect, sent a wild boar of enormous size
 to lay waste the fields of Calydon. Its eyes shone with blood and
 fire, its bristles stood like threatening spears, its tusks were
 like those of Indian elephants. The growing corn was trampled, the
 vines and olive trees laid waste, the flocks and herds were driven
 in wild confusion by the slaughtering foe. All common aid seemed vain;
 but Meleager called on the heroes of Greece to join in a bold hunt for
 the ravenous monster. Theseus and his friend Pirithous, Jason, Peleus,
 afterwards the father of Achilles, Telamon the father of Ajax, Nestor,
 then a youth, but who in his age bore arms with Achilles and Ajax in
 the Trojan war- these and many more joined in the enterprise. With
 them came Atalanta, the daughter of Iasius, king of Arcadia. A
 buckle of polished gold confined her vest, an ivory quiver hung on her
 left shoulder, and her left hand bore the bow. Her face blent feminine
 beauty with the best graces of martial youth. Meleager saw and loved.
 </p>
 <p>But now already they were near the monster's lair. They stretched
 strong nets from tree to tree; they uncoupled their dogs, they tried
 to find the footprints of their quarry in the grass. From the wood was
 a descent to marshy grounds. Here the boar, as he lay among the reeds,
 heard the shouts of his pursuers, and rushed forth against them. One
 and another is thrown down and slain. Jason throws his spear, with a
 prayer to Diana for success; and the favouring goddess allows the
 weapon to touch, but not to wound, removing the steel point of the
 spear in its flight. Nestor, assailed, seeks and finds safety in the
 branches of a tree. Telamon rushes on, but stumbling at a projecting
 root, falls prone. But an arrow from Atalanta at length for the
 first time tastes the monster's blood. It is a slight wound, but
 Meleager sees and joyfully proclaims it. Anceus, excited to envy by
 the praise given to a female, loudly Proclaims his own valour, and
 defies alike the boar and the goddess who had sent it; but as he
 rushes on, the infuriated beast lays him low with a mortal wound.
 Theseus throws his lance, but it is turned aside by a projecting
 bough. The dart of Jason misses its object, and kills instead one of
 their own dogs. But Meleager, after one unsuccessful stroke, drives
 his spear into the monster's side, then rushes on and despatches him
 with repeated blows.
 </p>
 <p>Then rose a shout from those around; they congratulated the
 conqueror, crowding to touch his hand. He, placing his foot upon the
 head of the slain boar, turned to Atalanta and bestowed on her the
 head and the rough hide which were the trophies of his success. But at
 this, envy excited the rest to strife. Plexippus and Toxeus, the
 brothers of Meleager's mother, beyond the rest opposed the gift, and
 snatched from the maiden the trophy she had received. Meleager,
 kindling with rage at the wrong done to himself, and still more at the
 insult offered to her whom he loved, forgot the claims of kindred, and
 plunged his sword into the offenders' hearts.
 </p>
 <p>As Althea bore gifts of thankfulness to the temples for the
 victory of her son, the bodies of her murdered brothers met her sight.
 She shrieks, and beats her breast, and hastens to change the
 garments of rejoicing for those of mourning. But when the author of
 the deed is known, grief gives way to the stern desire of vengeance on
 her son. The fatal brand, which once she rescued from the flames,
 the brand which the destinies had linked with Meleager's life, she
 brings forth, and commands a fire to be prepared. Then four times
 she essays to place the brand upon the pile; four times draws back,
 shuddering at the thought of bringing destruction on her son. The
 feelings of the mother and the sister contend within her. Now she is
 pale at the thought of the proposed deed, now flushed again with anger
 at the act of her son. As a vessel, driven in one direction by the
 wind, and in the opposite by the tide, the mind of Althea hangs
 suspended in uncertainty. But now the sister prevails above the
 mother, and she begins as she holds the fatal wood: "Turn, ye
 Furies, goddesses of punishment! turn to behold the sacrifice I bring!
 Crime must atone for crime. Shall OEneus rejoice in his victor son,
 while the house of Thestius is desolate? But, alas! to what deed am
 I borne along? Brothers, forgive a mother's weakness! my hand fails
 me. He deserves death, but not that I should destroy him. But shall he
 then live, and triumph, and reign over Calydon, while you, my
 brothers, wander unavenged among the shades? No! thou hast lived by my
 gift; die, now, for thine own crime. Return the life which twice I
 gave thee, first at thy birth, again when I snatched this brand from
 the flames. O that thou hadst then died! Alas! evil is the conquest;
 but, brothers, ye have conquered." And, turning away her face, she
 threw the fatal wood upon the burning pile.
 </p>
 <p>It gave, or seemed to give, a deadly groan. Meleager, absent and
 unknowing of the cause, felt a sudden pang. He burns, and only by
 courageous pride conquers the pain which destroys him. He mourns
 only that he perishes by a bloodless and unhonoured death. With his
 last breath he calls upon his aged father, his brother, and his fond
 sisters, upon his beloved Atalanta, and upon his mother, the unknown
 cause of his fate. The flames increase, and with them the pain of
 the hero. Now both subside; now both are quenched. The brand is ashes,
 and the life of Meleager is breathed forth to the wandering winds.
 </p>
 <p>Althea, when the deed was done, laid violent hands upon herself. The
 sisters of Meleager mourned their brother with uncontrollable grief;
 till Diana, pitying the sorrows of the house that once had aroused her
 anger, turned them into birds.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ATALANTA.</h3>
 
 
 <p>The innocent cause of so much sorrow was a maiden whose face you
 might truly say was boyish for a girl, yet too girlish for a boy.
 Her fortune had been told, and it was to this effect: "Atalanta, do
 not marry; marriage will be your ruin." Terrified by this oracle,
 she fled the society of men, and devoted herself to the sports of
 the chase. To all suitors (for she had many) she imposed a condition
 which was generally effectual in relieving her of their
 persecutions- "I will be the prize of him who shall conquer me in
 the race; but death must be the penalty of all who try and fail." In
 spite of this hard condition some would try. Hippomenes was to be
 judge of the race. "Can it be possible that any will be so rash as
 to risk so much for a wife?" said he. But when he saw her lay aside
 her robe for the race, he changed his mind, and said, "Pardon me,
 youths, I knew not the prize you were competing for." As he surveyed
 them he wished them all to be beaten, and swelled with envy of any one
 that seemed at all likely to win. While such were his thoughts, the
 virgin darted forward. As she ran she looked more beautiful than ever.
 The breezes seemed to give wings to her feet; her hair flew over her
 shoulders, and the gay fringe of her garment fluttered behind her. A
 ruddy hue tinged the whiteness of her skin, such as a crimson
 curtain casts on a marble wall. All her competitors were distanced,
 and were put to death without mercy. Hippomenes, not daunted by this
 result, fixing his eyes on the virgin, said, "Why boast of beating
 those laggards? I offer myself for the contest." Atalanta looked at
 him with a pitying countenance, and hardly knew whether she would
 rather conquer him or not. "What god can tempt one so young and
 handsome to throw himself away? I pity him, not for his beauty (yet he
 is beautiful), but for his youth. I wish he would give up the race, or
 if he will be so mad, I hope he may outrun me." While she hesitates,
 revolving these thoughts, the spectators grow impatient for the
 race, and her father prompts her to prepare. Then Hippomenes addressed
 a prayer to Venus: "Help me, Venus, for you have led me on." Venus
 heard and was propitious.
 </p>
 <p>In the garden of her temple, in her own island of Cyprus, is a
 tree with yellow leaves and yellow branches and golden fruit. Hence
 she gathered three golden apples, and unseen by any one else, gave
 them to Hippomenes, and told him how to use them. The signal is given;
 each starts from the goal and skims over the sand. So light their
 tread, you would almost have thought they might run over the river
 surface or over the waving grain without sinking. The cries of the
 spectators cheered Hippomenes,- "Now, now, do your best! haste, haste!
 you gain on her! relax not! one more effort!" It was doubtful
 whether the youth or the maiden heard these cries with the greater
 pleasure. But his breath began to fail him, his throat was dry, the
 goal yet far off. At that moment be threw down one of the golden
 apples. The virgin was all amazement. She stopped to pick it up.
 Hippomenes shot ahead. Shouts burst forth from all sides. She
 redoubled her efforts, and soon overtook him. Again he threw an apple.
 She stopped again, but again came up with him. The goal was near;
 one chance only remained. "Now, goddess," said he, "prosper your
 gift!" and threw the last apple off at one side. She looked at it, and
 hesitated; Venus impelled her to turn aside for it. She did so, and
 was vanquished. The youth carried off his prize.
 </p>
 <p>But the lovers were so full of their own happiness that they
 forgot to pay due honour to Venus; and the goddess was provoked at
 their ingratitude. She caused them to give offence to Cybele. That
 powerful goddess was not to be insulted with impunity. She took from
 them their human form and turned them into animals of characters
 resembling their own: of the huntress-heroine, triumphing in the blood
 of her lovers, she made a lioness, and of her lord and master a
 lion, and yoked them to her car, where they are still to be seen in
 all representations, in statuary or painting, of the goddess Cybele.
 
 </p>
 <p>Cybele is the Latin name of the goddess called by the Greeks Rhea
 and Ops. She was the wife of Cronos and mother of Zeus. In works of
 art she exhibits the matronly air which distinguishes Juno and
 Ceres. Sometimes she is veiled, and seated on a throne with lions at
 her side, at other times riding in a chariot drawn by lions. She wears
 a mural crown, that is, a crown whose rim is carved in the form of
 towers and battlements. Her priests were called Corybantes.
 
 </p>
 <p>Byron, in describing the city of Venice, which is built on a low
 island in the Adriatic Sea, borrows an illustration from Cybele:
 
 </p>
             "She looks a sea-Cybele fresh from ocean,<br>
              Rising with her tiara of proud towers<br>
              At airy distance, with majestic motion,<br>
              A ruler of the waters and their powers."<br>
                                             Childe Harold, IV.<br>
 
 <p>In Moore's "Rhymes on the Road," the poet, speaking of Alpine
 scenery, alludes to the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes thus:
 
 </p>
           "Even here, in this region of wonders, I find<br>
            That light-footed Fancy leaves Truth far behind,<br>
            Or at least, like Hippomenes, turns her astray<br>
            By the golden illusions he flings in her way."<br>
