 <h2 align="CENTER">THE GOLDEN FLEECE- MEDEA</h2>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE GOLDEN FLEECE</h3>
 
 <p>IN very ancient times there lived in Thessaly a king and queen
 name Athamas and Nephele. They had two children, a boy and a girl.
 After a time Athamas grew indifferent to his wife, put her away, and
 took another. Nephele suspected danger to her children from the
 influence of the step-mother, and took measures to send them out of
 her reach. Mercury assisted her, and gave her a ram with a golden
 fleece, on which she set the two children, trusting that the ram would
 convey them to a place of safety. The ram vaulted into the air with
 the children on his back, taking his course to the East, till when
 crossing the strait that divides Europe and Asia, the girl, whose name
 was Helle, fell from his back into the sea, which from her was
 called the Hellespont,- now the Dardanelles. The ram continued his
 career till he reached the kingdom of Colchis, on the eastern shore of
 the Black Sea, where he safely landed the boy Phryxus, who was
 hospitably received by AEetes, king of the country. Phryxus sacrificed
 the ram to Jupiter, and gave the Golden Fleece to AEetes, who placed
 it in a consecrated rove, under the care of a sleepless dragon.
 </p>
 <p>There was another kingdom in Thessaly near to that of Athamas, and
 ruled over by a relative of his. The king AEson, being tired of the
 cares of government, surrendered his crown to his brother Pelias on
 condition that he should hold it only during the minority of Jason,
 the son of AEson. When Jason was grown up and came to demand the crown
 from his uncle, Pelias pretended to be willing to yield it, but at the
 same time suggested to the young man the glorious adventure of going
 in quest of the Golden Fleece, which it was well known was in the
 kingdom of Colchis, and was, as Pelias pretended, the rightful
 property of their family. Jason was pleased, with the thought and
 forthwith made preparations for the expedition. At that time the
 only species of navigation known to the Greeks consisted of small
 boats or canoes hollowed out from trunks of trees, so that when
 Jason employed Argus to build him a vessel capable of containing fifty
 men, it was considered a gigantic undertaking. It was accomplished,
 however, and the vessel named "Argo," from the name of the builder.
 Jason sent his invitation to all the adventurous young men of
 Greece, and soon found himself at the head of a band of bold youths,
 many of whom afterwards were renowned among the heroes and demigods of
 Greece. Hercules, Theseus, Orpheus, and Nestor were among them. They
 are called the Argonauts, from the name of their vessel.
 </p>
 <p>The "Argo" with her crew of heroes of Thessaly and having touched at
 the Island of Lemnos, thence crossed to Mysia and thence to Thrace.
 Here they found the sage Phineus, and from him received instruction as
 to their future course. It seems the entrance of the Euxine Sea was
 impeded by two small rocky islands, which floated on the surface,
 and in their tossings and heavings occasionally came together,
 crushing and grinding to atoms any object that might be caught between
 them. They were called the Symplegades, or Clashing Islands. Phineus
 instructed the Argonauts how to pass this dangerous strait. When
 they reached the islands they let go a dove, which took her way
 between the rocks, and passed in safety, only losing some feathers
 of her tail. Jason and his men seized the favourable moment of the
 rebound, plied their oars with vigour, and passed safe through, though
 the islands closed behind them, and actually grazed their stern.
 They now rowed along the shore till they arrived at the eastern end of
 the sea, and landed at the kingdom of Colchis.
 </p>
 <p>Jason made known his message to the Colchian king, AEetes, who
 consented to give tip the golden fleece if Jason would yoke to the
 plough two fire-breathing bulls with brazen feet, and sow the teeth of
 the dragon which Cadmus had slain, and from which it was well known
 that a crop of armed men would spring up, who would turn their weapons
 against their producer. Jason accepted the conditions, and a time
 was set for making the experiment. Previously, however, he found means
 to plead his cause to Medea, daughter of the king. He promised her
 marriage, and as they stood before the altar of Hecate, called the
 goddess to witness his oath. Medea yielded, and by her aid, for she
 was a potent sorceress, he was furnished with a charm, by which he
 could encounter safely the breath of the fire-breathing bulls and
 the weapons of the armed men.
 </p>
 <p>At the time appointed, the people assembled at the grove of Mars,
 and the king assumed his royal seat, while the multitude covered the
 hill-sides. The brazen-footed bulls rushed in, breathing fire from
 their nostrils that burned up the herbage as they passed. The sound
 was like the roar of a furnace, and the smoke like that of water
 upon quick-lime. Jason advanced boldly to meet them. His friends,
 the chosen heroes of Greece, trembled to behold him. Regardless of the
 burning breath, he soothed their rage with his voice, patted their
 necks with fearless hand, and adroitly slipped over them the yoke, and
 compelled them to drag the plough. The Colchians were amazed; the
 Greeks shouted for joy. Jason next proceeded to sow the dragon's teeth
 and plough them in. And soon the crop of armed men sprang up, and,
 wonderful to relate! no sooner had they reached the surface than
 they began to brandish their weapons and rush upon Jason. The Greeks
 trembled for their hero, and even she who had provided him a way of
 safety and taught him how to use it, Medea herself, grew pale with
 fear. Jason for a time kept his assailants at bay with his sword and
 shield, till, finding their numbers overwhelming, he resorted to the
 charm which Medea had taught him, seized a stone and threw it in the
 midst of his foes. They immediately turned their arms against one
 another, and soon there was not one of the dragon's brood left
 alive. The Greeks embraced their hero, and Medea, if she dared,
 would have embraced him too.
 </p>
 <p>It remained to lull to sleep the dragon that guarded the fleece, and
 this was done by scattering over him a few drops of a preparation
 which Medea had supplied. At the smell he relaxed his rage, stood
 for a moment motionless, then shut those great round eyes, that had
 never been known to shut before, and turned over on his side, fast
 asleep. Jason seized the fleece and with his friends and Medea
 accompanying, hastened to their vessel before AEetes the king could
 arrest their departure, and made the best of their way back to
 Thessaly, where they arrived safe, and Jason delivered the fleece to
 Pelias, and dedicated the "Argo" to Neptune. What became of the fleece
 afterwards we do not know, but perhaps it was found after all, like
 many other golden prizes, not worth the trouble it had cost to procure
 it.
 
 </p>
 <p>This is one of those mythological tales, says a late writer, in
 which there is reason to believe that a substratum of truth exists,
 though overlaid by a mass of fiction. It probably was the first
 important maritime expedition, and like the first attempts of the kind
 of all nations, as we know from history, was probably of a
 half-piratical character. If rich spoils were the result it was enough
 to give rise to the idea of the golden fleece.
 </p>
 <p>Another suggestion of a learned mythologist, Bryant, is that it is a
 corrupt tradition of the story of Noah and the ark. The name "Argo"
 seems to countenance this, and the incident of the dove is another
 confirmation.
 
 </p>
 <p>Pope, in his "Ode on St. Cecilia's Day," thus celebrates the
 launching of the ship "Argo," and the power of the music of Orpheus,
 whom he calls the Thracian:
 
 </p>
           "So when the first bold vessel dared the seas,<br>
              High on the stern the Thracian raised his strain,<br>
            While Argo saw her kindred trees<br>
              Descend from Pelion to the main.<br>
            Transported demigods stood round,<br>
            And men grew heroes at the sound."<br>
 
 <p>In Dyer's poem of "The Fleece" there is an account of the ship
 "Argo" and her crew, which gives a good picture of this primitive
 maritime adventure:
 
 </p>
           "From every region of AEgea's shore<br>
            The brave assembled; those illustrious twins<br>
            Castor and Pollux; Orpheus, tuneful bard;<br>
            Zetes and Calais, as the wind in speed;<br>
            Strong Hercules and many a chief renowned.<br>
            On deep Ioclos' sandy shore they thronged,<br>
            Gleaming in armour, ardent of exploits;<br>
            And soon, the laurel cord and the huge stone<br>
            Uplifting to the deck, unmoored the bark;<br>
            Whose keel of wondrous length the skilful hand<br>
            Of Argus fashioned for the proud attempt;<br>
            And in the extended keel a lofty mast<br>
            Upraised, and sails full swelling; to the chiefs<br>
            Unwonted objects. Now first, now they learned<br>
            Their bolder steerage over ocean wave,<br>
            Led by the golden stars, as Chiron's art<br>
            Had marked the sphere celestial," etc.<br>
 
 <p>Hercules left the expedition at Mysia, for Hylas, a youth beloved by
 him, having gone for water, was laid hold of and kept by the nymphs of
 the spring, who were fascinated by his beauty. Hercules went in
 quest of the lad, and while he was absent the "Argo" put to sea and
 left him. Moore, in one of his songs, makes a beautiful allusion to
 this incident:
 
 </p>
         "When Hylas was sent with his urn to the fount,<br>
            Through fields of light and with heart full of play,<br>
          Light rambled the boy over meadow and mount,<br>
            And neglected his task for the flowers in the way.<br>
 
         "Thus many like me, who in youth should have tasted<br>
            The fountain that runs by Philosophy's shrine,<br>
          Their time with the flowers on the margin have wasted,<br>
            And left their light urns all as empty as mine."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">MEDEA AND AESON</h3>
 
 <p>Amid the rejoicings for the recovery of the Golden Fleece, Jason
 felt that one thing was wanting, the presence of AEson, his father,
 who was prevented by his age and infirmities from taking part in them.
 Jason said to Medea, "My spouse, would that your arts, whose power I
 have seen so mighty for my aid, could do me one further service,
 take some years from my life and add them to my father's." Medea
 replied, "Not at such a cost shall it be done, but if my art avails
 me, his life shall be lengthened without abridging yours." The next
 full moon she issued forth alone, while all creatures slept; not a
 breath stirred the foliage, and all was still, To the stars she
 addressed her incantations, and to the moon; to Hecate,* the goddess
 of the under-world, and to Tellus the goddess of the earth, by whose
 power plants potent for enchantment are produced. She invoked the gods
 of the woods and caverns, of mountains and valleys, of lakes and
 rivers, of winds and vapours. While she spoke the stars shone
 brighter, and presently a chariot descended through the air, drawn
 by flying serpents. She ascended it, and borne aloft made her way to
 distant regions, where potent plants grew which she knew how to select
 for her purpose. Nine nights she employed in her search, and during
 that time came not within the doors of her palace nor under any
 roof, and shunned all intercourse with mortals.
 
 </p>
 <p>* Hecate was a mysterious divinity sometimes identified with Diana
 and sometimes with Proserpine. As Diana represents the moonlight
 splendour of night, so Hecate represents its darkness and terrors. She
 was the goddess of sorcery and witchcraft, and was believed to
 wander by night along the earth, seen only by the dogs, whose
 barking told her approach.
 
 </p>
 <p>She next erected two altars, the one to Hecate, the other to Hebe,
 the goddess of youth, and sacrificed a black sheep, pouring
 libations of milk and wine. She implored Pluto and his stolen bride
 that they would not hasten to take the old man's life. Then she
 directed that AEson should be led forth, and having thrown him into
 a deep sleep by a charm, had him laid on a bed of herbs, like one
 dead. Jason and all others were kept away from the place, that no
 profane eyes might look upon her mysteries. Then, with streaming hair,
 she thrice moved round the altars, dipped flaming twigs in the
 blood, and laid them thereon to burn. Meanwhile the cauldron with
 its contents was got ready. In it she put magic herbs, with seeds
 and flowers of acrid juice, stones from the distant east, and sand
 from the shore of all-surrounding ocean; hoar frost, gathered by
 moonlight, a screech owl's head and wings, and the entrails of a wolf.
 She added fragments of the shells of tortoises, and the liver of
 stags- animals tenacious of life- and the head and beak of a crow,
 that outlives nine generations of men. These with many other things
 "without a name" she boiled together for her purposed work, stirring
 them up with a dry olive branch; and behold! the branch when taken out
 instantly became green, and before long was covered with leaves and
 a plentiful growth of young olives; and as the liquor boiled and
 bubbled, and sometimes ran over, the grass wherever the sprinklings
 fell shot forth with a verdure like that of spring.
 </p>
 <p>Seeing that all was ready, Medea cut the throat of the old man and
 let out all his blood, and poured into his mouth and into his wound
 the juices of her cauldron. As soon as he had completely imbibed them,
 his hair and beard laid by their whiteness and assumed the blackness
 of youth; his paleness and emaciation were gone; his veins were full
 of blood, his limbs of vigour and robustness. AEson is amazed at
 himself, and remembers that such as he now is, he was in his
 youthful days, forty years before.
 </p>
 <p>Medea used her arts here for a good purpose, but not so in another
 instance, where she made them the instruments of revenge. Pelias,
 our readers will recollect, was the usurping uncle of Jason, and had
 kept him out of his kingdom. Yet he must have had some good qualities,
 for his daughters loved him, and when they saw what Medea had done for
 AEson, they wished her to do the same for their father. Medea
 pretended to consent, and prepared her cauldron as before. At her
 request an old sheep was brought and plunged into the cauldron. Very
 soon a bleating was heard in the kettle, and when the cover was
 removed, a lamb jumped forth and ran frisking away into the meadow.
 The daughters of Pelias saw the experiment with delight, and appointed
 a time for their father to undergo the same operation. But Medea
 prepared her cauldron for him in a very different way. She put in only
 water and a few simple herbs. In the night she with the sisters
 entered the bed chamber of the old king, while he and his guards slept
 soundly under the influence of a spell cast upon them by Medea. The
 daughters stood by the bedside with their weapons drawn, but hesitated
 to strike, till Medea chid their irresolution. Then turning away their
 faces, and giving random blows they smote him with their weapons.
 He, starting from his sleep, cried out, "My daughters, what are you
 doing? Will you kill your father?" Their hearts failed them and
 their weapons fell from their hands, but Medea struck him a fatal
 blow, and prevented his saying more.
 </p>
 <p>Then they placed him in the cauldron, and Medea hastened to depart
 in her serpent-drawn chariot before they discovered her treachery or
 their vengeance would have been terrible. She escaped, however, but
 had little enjoyment of the fruits of her crime. Jason, for whom she
 had done so much, wishing to marry Creusa, princess of Corinth, put
 away Medea. She, enraged at his ingratitude, called on the gods for
 vengeance, sent a poisoned robe as a gift to the bride, and then
 killing her own children, and setting fire to the palace, mounted
 her serpent-drawn chariot and fled to Athens, where she married King
 AEgeus, the father of Theseus, and we shall meet her again when we
 come to the adventures of that hero.
 
 </p>
 <p>The incantations of Medea will remind the reader of those of the
 witches in "Macbeth." The following lines are those which seem most
 strikingly to recall the ancient model:
 
 </p>
             "Round about the cauldron go;<br>
              In the poisoned entrails throw.<br>
 
              Fillet of a fenny snake<br>
              In the cauldron boil and bake;<br>
              Eye of newt and toe of frog,<br>
              Wool of bat and tongue of dog,<br>
              Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,<br>
              Lizard's leg and howlet's wing;<br>
 
              Maw of ravening salt-sea shark,<br>
              Root of hemlock digged in the dark," etc.<br>
                                       Macbeth, Act IV. Scene I.<br>
 
 <p>And again:
 
 </p>
                Macbeth.- What is't you do?<br>
                Witches.- A deed without a name.<br>
 
 <p>There is another story of Medea almost too revolting for record even
 of a sorceress, a class of persons to whom both ancient and modern
 poets have been accustomed to attribute every degree of atrocity. In
 her flight from Colchis she had taken her young brother Absyrtus
 with her. Finding the pursuing vessels of AEetes gaining upon the
 Argonauts, she caused the lad to be killed and his limbs to be
 strewn over the sea. AEetes on reaching the place found these
 sorrowful traces of his murdered son; but while he tarried to
 collect the scattered fragments and bestow upon them an honourable
 interment, the Argonauts escaped.
 </p>
 <p>In the poems of Campbell will be found a translation of one of the
 choruses of the tragedy of "Medea," where the poet Euripides has taken
 advantage of the occasion to pay a glowing tribute to Athens, his
 native city. It begins thus:
 
 </p>
           "O haggard queen! to Athens dost thou guide<br>
              Thy glowing chariot, steeped in kindred gore;<br>
            Or seek to hide thy damned parricide<br>
              Where peace and justice dwell for evermore?"<br>
