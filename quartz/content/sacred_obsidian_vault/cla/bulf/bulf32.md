 <h2 align="CENTER">AENEAS IN ITALY.</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">CAMILLA- EVANDER- NISUS AND EURYALUS-</h3>
 <h4 align="CENTER">MEZENTIUS- TURNUS.</h4>
 
 <p>AENEAS, having parted from the Sibyl and rejoined his fleet, coasted
 along the shores of Italy and cast anchor in the mouth of the Tiber.
 The poet, having brought his hero to this spot, the destined
 termination of his wanderings, invokes his Muse to tell him the
 situation of things at that eventful moment. Latinus, third in descent
 from Saturn, ruled the country. He was now old and had no male
 descendant, but had one charming daughter, Lavinia, who was sought
 in marriage by many neighbouring chiefs, one of whom, Turnus, king
 of the Rutulians, was favoured by the wishes of her parents. But
 Latinus had been warned in a dream by his father Faunus, that the
 destined husband of Lavinia should come from a foreign land. From that
 union should spring a race destined to subdue the world.
 </p>
 <p>Our readers will remember that in the conflict with the Harpies
 one of those half-human birds had threatened the Trojans with dire
 sufferings. In particular she predicted that before their wanderings
 ceased they should be pressed by hunger to devour their tables. This
 portent now came true; for as they took their scanty meal, seated on
 the grass, the men placed their hard biscuit on their laps, and put
 thereon whatever their gleanings in the woods supplied. Having
 despatched the latter they finished by eating the crusts. Seeing
 which, the boy Iulus said playfully, "See, we are eating our
 tables." AEneas caught the words and accepted the omen. "All hail,
 promised land!" he exclaimed, "this is our home, this our country." He
 then took measures to find out who were the present inhabitants of the
 land, and who their rulers. A hundred chosen men were sent to the
 village of Latinus, bearing presents and a request for friendship
 and alliance. They went and were favourably received. Latinus
 immediately concluded that the Trojan hero was no other than the
 promised son-in-law announced by the oracle. He cheerfully granted his
 alliance and sent back the messengers mounted on steeds from his
 stables, and loaded with gifts and friendly messages.
 </p>
 <p>Juno, seeing things go thus prosperously for the Trojans, felt her
 old animosity revive, summoned Alecto from Erebus, and sent her to
 stir up discord. The Fury first took possession of the queen, Amata,
 and roused her to oppose in every way the new alliance. Alecto then
 speeded to the city of Turnus, and assuming the form of an old
 priestess, informed him of the arrival of the foreigners and of the
 attempts of their prince to rob him of his bride. Next she turned
 her attention to the camp of the Trojans. There she saw the boy
 Iulus and his companions amusing themselves with hunting. She
 sharpened the scent of the dogs, and led them to rouse up from the
 thicket a tame stag, the favourite of Silvia, the daughter of
 Tyrrheus, the king's herdsman. A javelin from the hand of Iulus
 wounded the animal, and he had only strength left to run homewards,
 and died at his mistress's feet. Her cries and tears roused her
 brothers and the herdsmen, and they, seizing whatever weapons came
 to hand, furiously assaulted the hunting party. These were protected
 by their friends, and the herdsmen were finally driven back with the
 loss of two of their number.
 </p>
 <p>These things were enough to rouse the storm of war, and the queen,
 Turnus, and the peasants all urged the old king to drive the strangers
 from the country. He resisted as long as he could, but, finding his
 opposition unavailing, finally gave way and retreated to his
 retirement.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OPENING THE GATES OF JANUS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>It was the custom of the country, when war was to be undertaken, for
 the chief magistrate, clad in his robes of office, with solemn pomp to
 open the gates of the temple of Janus, which were kept shut as long as
 peace endured. His people now urged the old king to perform that
 solemn office, but he refused to do so. While they contested, Juno
 herself, descending from the skies, smote the doors with
 irresistible force, and burst them open. Immediately the whole country
 was in a flame. The people rushed from every side breathing nothing
 but war.
 </p>
 <p>Turnus was recognized by all as leader; others joined as allies,
 chief of whom was Mezentius, a brave and able soldier, but of
 detestable cruelty. He had been the chief of one of the neighbouring
 cities, but his people drove him out. With him was joined his son
 Lausus, a generous youth, worthy of a better sire.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">CAMILLA.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Camilla, the favourite of Diana, a huntress and warrior, after the
 fashion of the Amazons, came with her band of mounted followers,
 including a select number of her own sex, and ranged herself on the
 side of Turnus. This maiden had never accustomed her fingers to the
 distaff or the loom, but had learned to endure the toils of war, and
 in speed to outstrip the wind. It seemed as if she might run over
 the standing corn without crushing it, or over the surface of the
 water without dipping her feet. Camilla's history had been singular
 from the beginning. Her father, Metabus, driven from his city by civil
 discord, carried with him in his flight his infant daughter. As he
 fled through the woods, his enemies in hot pursuit, he reached the
 bank of the river Amazenus, which, swelled by rain, seemed to debar
 a passage. He paused for a moment, then decided what to do. He tied
 the infant to his lance with wrappers of bark, and poising the
 weapon in his upraised hand, thus addressed Diana: "Goddess of the
 woods! I consecrate this maid to you"; then hurled the weapon with its
 burden to the opposite bank. The spear flew across the roaring
 water. His pursuers were already upon him, but he plunged into the
 river and swam across, and found the spear, with the infant safe on
 the other side. Thenceforth he lived among the shepherds, and
 brought up his daughter in woodland arts. While a child she was taught
 to use the bow and throw the javelin. With her sling she could bring
 down the crane or the wild swan. Her dress was a tiger's skin. Many
 mothers sought her for a daughter-in-law, but she continued faithful
 to Diana and repelled the thought of marriage.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">EVANDER.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Such were the formidable allies that ranged themselves against
 AEneas. It was night and he lay stretched in sleep on the bank of
 the river under the open heavens. The god of the stream, Father Tiber.
 seemed to raise his head above the willows and to say, "O
 goddess-born, destined possessor of the Latin realms, this is the
 promised land, here is to be your home, here shall terminate the
 hostility of the heavenly powers, if only you faithfully persevere.
 There are friends not far distant. Prepare your boats and row up my
 stream; I will lead you to Evander, the Arcadian chief. He has long
 been at strife with Turnus and the Rutulians, and is prepared to
 become an ally of yours. Rise! offer your vows to Juno, and
 deprecate her anger. When you have achieved your victory then think of
 me." AEneas woke and paid immediate obedience to the friendly
 vision. He sacrificed to Juno, and invoked the god of the river and
 all his tributary fountains to lend their aid. Then for the first time
 a vessel filled with armed warriors floated on the stream of the
 Tiber. The river smoothed its waves, and bade its current flow gently,
 while, impelled by the vigorous strokes of the rowers, the vessels
 shot rapidly up the stream.
 </p>
 <p>About the middle of the day they came in sight of the scattered
 buildings of the infant town, where in after times the proud city of
 Rome grew, whose glory reached the skies. By chance the old king,
 Evander, was that day celebrating annual solemnities in honour of
 Hercules and all the gods. Pallas, his son, and all the chiefs of
 the little commonwealth stood by. When they saw the tall ship
 gliding onward near the wood, they were alarmed at the sight, and rose
 from the tables. But Pallas forbade the solemnities to be interrupted,
 and seizing a weapon, stepped forward to the river's bank. He called
 aloud, demanding who they were, and what their object. AEneas, holding
 forth an olive-branch, replied, "We are Trojans, friends to you, and
 enemies to the Rutulians. We seek Evander, and offer to join our
 arms with yours." Pallas, in amaze at the sound of so great a name,
 invited them to land, and when AEneas touched the shore he seized
 his hand, and held it long in friendly grasp. Proceeding through the
 wood, they joined the king and his party and were most favourably
 received. Seats were provided for them at the tables, and the repast
 proceeded.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">INFANT ROME.</h3>
 
 
 <p>When the solemnities were ended all moved towards the city. The
 king, bending with age, walked between his son and AEneas, taking
 the arm of one or the other of them, and with much variety of pleasing
 talk shortening the way. AEneas with delight looked and listened,
 observing all the beauties of the scene, and learning much of heroes
 renowned in ancient times. Evander said, "These extensive groves
 were once inhabited by fauns and nymphs, and a rude race of men who
 sprang from the trees themselves, and had neither laws not social
 culture. They knew not how to yoke the cattle nor raise a harvest, nor
 provide from present abundance for future want; but browsed like
 beasts upon the leafy boughs, or fed voraciously or their hunted prey.
 Such were they when Saturn, expelled from Olympus by his sons, came
 among them and drew together the fierce savages, formed them into
 society and gave them laws. Such peace and plenty ensued that men ever
 since have called his reign the golden age; but by degrees far other
 times succeeded, and the thirst of gold and the thirst of blood
 prevailed. The land was a prey to successive tyrants, till fortune and
 resistless destiny brought me hither, an exile from my native land,
 Arcadia."
 </p>
 <p>Having thus said, he showed him the Tarpeian rock, and the rude spot
 then overgrown with bushes where in after times the Capitol rose in
 all its magnificence. He next pointed to some dismantled walls, and
 said, "Here stood Janiculum, built by Janus, and there Saturnia, the
 town of Saturn." Such discourse brought them to the cottage of poor
 Evander, whence they saw the lowing herds roaming over the plain where
 now the proud and stately Forum stands. They entered, and a couch
 was spread for AEneas, well stuffed with leaves, and covered with
 the skin of a Libyan bear.
 </p>
 <p>Next morning, awakened by the dawn and the shrill song of birds
 beneath the eaves of his low mansion, old Evander rose. Clad in a
 tunic, and a panther's skin thrown over his shoulders, with sandals on
 his feet and his good sword girded to his side, he went forth to
 seek his guest. Two mastiffs followed him, his whole retinue and
 body guard. He found the hero attended by his faithful Achates, and,
 Pallas, soon joining them, the old king spoke thus:
 </p>
 <p>"Illustrious Trojan, it is but little we can do in so great a cause.
 Our state is feeble, hemmed in on one side by the river, on the
 other by the Rutulians. But I propose to ally you with a people
 numerous and rich, to whom fate has brought you at the propitious
 moment. The Etruscans hold the country beyond the river. Mezentius was
 their king, a monster of cruelty, who invented unheard-of torments
 to gratify his vengeance. He would fasten the dead to the living, hand
 to hand and face to face, and leave the wretched victims to die in
 that dreadful embrace. At length the people cast him out, him and
 his house. They burned his palace and slew his friends. He escaped and
 took refuge with Turnus, who protects him with arms. The Etruscans
 demand that he shall be given up to deserved punishment, and would ere
 now have attempted to enforce their demand; but the priests restrain
 them, telling them that it is the will of heaven that no native of the
 land shall guide them to victory, and that their destined leader
 must come from across the sea. They have offered the crown to me,
 but I am too old to undertake such great affairs, and my son is
 native-born, which precludes him from the choice. You, equally by
 birth and time of life, and fame in arms, pointed out by the gods,
 have but to appear to be hailed at once as their leader. With you I
 will join Pallas, my son, my only hope and comfort. Under you he shall
 learn the art of war, and strive to emulate your great exploits."
 </p>
 <p>Then the king ordered horses to be furnished for the Trojan
 chiefs, and AEneas, with a chosen band of followers and Pallas
 accompanying, mounted and took the way to the Etruscan city,* having
 sent back the rest of his party in the ships. AEneas and his band
 safely arrived at the Etruscan camp and were received with open arms
 by Tarchon and his countrymen.
 
 </p>
 <p>* The poet here inserts a famous line which is thought to imitate in
 its sound the galloping of horses. It may be thus translated: "Then
 struck the hoofs of the steeds on the ground with a four-footed
 trampling."- See Proverbial Expressions, no. 17.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">NISUS AND EURYALUS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>In the meanwhile Turnus had collected his bands and made all
 necessary preparations for the war. Juno sent Iris to him with a
 message inciting him to take advantage of the absence of AEneas and
 surprise the Trojan camp. Accordingly the attempt was made, but the
 Trojans were found on their guard, and having received strict orders
 from AEneas not to fight in his absence, they lay still in their
 intrenchments, and resisted all the efforts of the Rutulians to draw
 them into the field. Night coming on, the army of Turnus, in high
 spirits at their fancied superiority, feasted and enjoyed
 themselves, and finally stretched themselves on the field and slept
 secure.
 </p>
 <p>In the camp of the Trojans things were far otherwise. There all
 was watchfulness and anxiety and impatience for AEneas's return. Nisus
 stood guard at the entrance of the camp, and Euryalus, a youth
 distinguished above all in the army for graces of person and fine
 qualities, was with him. These two were friends and brothers in
 arms. Nisus said to his friend, "Do you perceive what confidence and
 carelessness the enemy display? Their lights are few and dim, and
 the men seem all oppressed with wine or sleep. You know how
 anxiously our chiefs wish to send to AEneas, and to get intelligence
 from him. Now, I am strongly moved to make my way through the
 enemy's camp and to go in search of our chief. If I succeed, the glory
 of the deed will be reward enough for me, and if they judge the
 service deserves anything more, let them pay it to you."
 </p>
 <p>Euryalus, all on fire with the love of adventure, replied, "Would
 you, then, Nisus, refuse to share your enterprise with me? And shall I
 let you go into such danger alone? Not so my brave father brought me
 up, nor so have I planned for myself when I joined the standard of
 AEneas, and resolved to hold my life cheap in comparison with honour."
 Nisus replied, "I doubt it not, my friend; but you know the
 uncertain event of such an undertaking, and whatever may happen to me,
 I wish you to be safe. You are younger than I and have more of life in
 prospect. Nor can I be the cause of such grief to your mother, who has
 chosen to be here in the camp with you rather than stay and live in
 peace with the other matrons in Acestes' city." Euryalus replied, "Say
 no more. In vain you seek arguments to dissuade me. I am fixed in
 the resolution to go with you. Let us lose no time." They called the
 guard, and committing the watch to them, sought the general's tent.
 They found the chief officers in consultation, deliberating how they
 should send notice to AEneas of their situation. The offer of the
 two friends was gladly accepted, themselves loaded with praises and
 promised the most liberal rewards in case of success. Iulus especially
 addressed Euryalus, assuring him of his lasting friendship. Euryalus
 replied, "I have but one boon to ask. My aged mother is with me in the
 camp. For me she left the Trojan soil, and would not stay behind
 with the other matrons at the city of Acestes. I go now without taking
 leave of her. I could not bear her tears nor set at nought her
 entreaties. But do thou, I beseech you, comfort her in her distress.
 Promise me that and I shall go more boldly into whatever dangers may
 present themselves." Iulus and the other chiefs were moved to tears,
 and promised to do all his request. "Your mother shall be mine,"
 said Iulus, "and all that I have promised to you shall be made good to
 her, if you do not return to receive it."
 </p>
 <p>The two friends left the camp and plunged at once into the midst
 of the enemy. They found no watch, no sentinels posted, but, all
 about, the sleeping soldiers strewn on the grass and among the wagons.
 The laws of war at that early day did not forbid a brave man to slay a
 sleeping foe, and the two Trojans slew, as they passed, such of the
 enemy as they could without exciting alarm. In one tent Euryalus
 made prize of a helmet brilliant with gold and plumes. They had passed
 through the enemy's ranks without being discovered, but now suddenly
 appeared a troop directly in front of them, which, under Volscens,
 their leader, were approaching the camp. The glittering helmet of
 Euryalus caught their attention, and Volscens hailed the two, and
 demanded who and whence they were. They made no answer, but plunged
 into the wood. The horsemen scattered in all directions to intercept
 their flight. Nisus had eluded pursuit and was out of danger, but
 Euryalus being missing he turned back to seek him. He again entered
 the wood and soon came within sound of voices. Looking through the
 thicket he saw the whole band surrounding Euryalus with noisy
 questions. What should he do? how extricate the youth, or would it
 be better to die with him?
 </p>
 <p>Raising his eyes to the moon, which now shone clear, he said,
 "Goddess! favour my effort!" and aiming his javelin at one of the
 leaders of the troop, struck him in the back and stretched him on
 the plain with a death-blow. In the midst of their amazement another
 weapon flew and another of the party fell dead. Volscens, the
 leader, ignorant whence the darts came, rushed sword in hand upon
 Euryalus. "You shall pay the penalty of both," he said, and would have
 plunged the sword into his bosom, when Nisus, who from his concealment
 saw the peril of his friend, rushed forward exclaiming, "'Twas I,
 'twas I; turn your swords against me, Rutulians, I did it; he only
 followed me as a friend." While he spoke the sword fell, and pierced
 the comely bosom of Euryalus. His head fell on his shoulder, like a
 flower cut down by the plough. Nisus rushed upon Volscens and
 plunged his sword into his body, and was himself slain on the
 instant by numberless blows.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">MEZENTIUS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>AEneas, with his Etrurian allies, arrived on the scene of action
 in time to rescue his beleaguered camp; and now the two armies being
 nearly equal in strength, the war began in good earnest. We cannot
 find space for all the details, but must simply record the fate of the
 principal characters whom we have introduced to our readers. The
 tyrant Mezentius, finding himself engaged against his revolting
 subjects, raged like a wild beast. He slew all who dared to
 withstand him, and put the multitude to flight wherever he appeared.
 At last he encountered AEneas, and the armies stood still to see the
 issue. Mezentius threw his spear, which striking AEneas's shield
 glanced off and hit Anthor. He was a Grecian by birth, who had left
 Argos, his native city, and followed Evander into Italy. The poet says
 of him with simple pathos which has made the words proverbial, "He
 fell, unhappy, by a wound intended for another, looked up to the
 skies, and dying remembered sweet Argos."* AEneas now in turn hurled
 his lance. It pierced the shield of Mezentius, and wounded him in
 the thigh. Lausus, his son, could not bear the sight, but rushed
 forward and interposed himself, while the followers pressed round
 Mezentius and bore him away. AEneas held his sword suspended over
 Lausus and delayed to strike, but the furious youth pressed on and
 he was compelled to deal the fatal blow. Lausus fell, and AEneas
 bent over him in pity. "Hapless youth," he said, "what can I do for
 you worthy of your praise? Keep those arms in which you glory, and
 fear not but that your body shall be restored to your friends, and
 have due funeral honours." So saying, he called the timid followers
 and delivered the body into their hands.
 
 </p>
 <p>* See Proverbial Expressions, no. 18.
 
 </p>
 <p>Mezentius meanwhile had been borne to the river-side, and washed his
 wound. Soon the news reached him of Lausus's death, and rage and
 despair supplied the place of strength. He mounted his horse and
 dashed into the place of the fight, seeking AEneas. Having found
 him, he rode round him in a circle, throwing one javelin after
 another, while AEneas stood fenced with his shield, turning every
 way to meet them. At last, after Mezentius had three times made the
 circuit, AEneas threw his lance directly at the horse's head. It
 pierced his temples and he fell, while a shout from both armies rent
 the skies. Mezentius asked no mercy, but only that his body might be
 spared the insults of his revolted subjects, and be buried in the same
 grave with his son. He received the fatal stroke not unprepared, and
 poured out his life and his blood together.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">PALLAS, CAMILLA, TURNUS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>While these things were doing in one part of the field, in another
 Turnus encountered the youthful Pallas. The contest between
 champions so unequally matched could not be doubtful. Pallas bore
 himself bravely, but fell by the lance of Turnus. The victor almost
 relented when he saw the brave youth lying dead at his feet, and
 spared to use the privilege of a Conqueror in despoiling him of his
 arms. The belt only, adorned with studs and carvings of gold, he
 took and clasped round his own body. The rest he remitted to the
 friends of the slain.
 </p>
 <p>After the battle there was a cessation of arms for some days to
 allow both armies to bury their dead. In this interval AEneas
 challenged Turnus to decide the contest by single combat, but Turnus
 evaded the challenge. Another battle ensued, in which Camilla, the
 virgin warrior, was chiefly conspicuous. Her deeds of valor
 surpassed those of the bravest warriors, and many Trojans and
 Etruscans fell pierced with her darts or struck down by her
 battle-axe. At last an Etruscan named Aruns, who had watched her long,
 seeking for some advantage, observed her pursuing a flying enemy whose
 splendid armour offered a tempting prize. Intent on the chase she
 observed not her danger, and the javelin of Aruns struck her and
 inflicted a fatal wound. She fell and breathed her last in the arms of
 her attendant maidens. But Diana, who beheld her fate, suffered not
 her slaughter to be unavenged. Aruns, as he stole away, glad but
 frightened, was struck by a secret arrow, launched by one of the
 nymphs of Diana's train, and died ignobly and unknown.
 </p>
 <p>At length the final conflict took place between AEneas and Turnus.
 Turnus had avoided the contest as long as he could, but at last,
 impelled by the ill success of his arms and by the murmurs of his
 followers, he braced himself to the conflict. It could not be
 doubtful. On the side of AEneas were the expressed decree of
 destiny, the aid of his goddess-mother at every emergency, and
 impenetrable armour fabricated by Vulcan, at her request, for her son.
 Turnus, on the other hand, was deserted by his celestial allies,
 Juno having been expressly forbidden by Jupiter to assist him any
 longer. Turnus threw his lance, but it recoiled harmless from the
 shield of AEneas. The Trojan hero then threw his, which penetrated the
 shield of Turnus, and pierced his thigh. Then Turnus's fortitude
 forsook him and he begged for mercy; and AEneas would have given him
 life, but at the instant his eye fell on the belt of Pallas, which
 Turnus had taken from the slaughtered youth. Instantly his rage
 revived, and exclaiming, "Pallas immolates thee with this blow," he
 thrust him through with his sword.
 </p>
 <p>Here the poem of the "AEneid" closes, and we are left to infer
 that AEneas, having triumphed over his foes, obtained Lavinia for
 his bride. Tradition adds that he founded his city, and called it
 after her name, Lavinium. His son Iulus founded Alba Longa, which
 was the birthplace of Romulus and Remus and the cradle of Rome itself.
 
 </p>
 <p>There is an allusion to Camilla in those well-known lines of Pope,
 in which, illustrating the rule that "the sound should be an echo to
 the sense," he says:
 
 </p>
       "When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,<br>
        The line too labours and the words move slow.<br>
        Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain,<br>
        Flies o'er the unbending corn or skims along the main."<br>
