 <h2 align="CENTER">THE INFERNAL REGIONS- THE SIBYL.</h2>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE INFERNAL REGIONS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>AS at the commencement of our series we have given the pagan account
 of the creation of the world, so as we approach its conclusion we
 present a view of the regions of the dead, depicted by one of their
 most enlightened poets, who drew his doctrines from their most
 esteemed philosophers. The region where Virgil locates the entrance to
 this abode is perhaps the most strikingly adapted to excite ideas of
 the terrific and preternatural of any on the face of the earth. It
 is the volcanic region near Vesuvius, where the whole country is cleft
 with chasms, from which sulphurous flames arise, while the ground is
 shaken with pent-up vapours, and mysterious sounds issue from the
 bowels of the earth. The lake Avernus is supposed to fill the crater
 of an extinct volcano. It is circular, half a mile wide, and very
 deep, surrounded by high banks, which in Virgil's time were covered
 with a gloomy forest. Mephitic vapours rise from its waters, so that
 no life is found on its banks: and no birds fly over it. Here,
 according to the poet, was the cave which afforded access to the
 infernal regions, and here AEneas offered sacrifices to the infernal
 deities, Proserpine, Hecate, and the Furies. Then a roaring was
 heard in the earth, the woods on the hill-tops were shaken, and the
 howling of dogs announced the approach of the deities. "Now," said the
 Sibyl, "summon up your courage, for you will need it." She descended
 into the cave, and AEneas followed. Before the threshold of hell
 they passed through a group of beings who are enumerated as Griefs and
 avenging Cares, pale Diseases and melancholy Age, Fear and Hunger that
 tempt to crime, Toil, Poverty, and Death,- forms horrible to view. The
 Furies spread the couches there, and Discord, whose hair was of vipers
 tied up with a bloody fillet. Here also were the monsters, Briareus,
 with his hundred arms, Hydras hissing, and Chimaeras breathing fire.
 AEneas shuddered at the sight, drew his sword and would have struck,
 but the Sibyl restrained him. They then came to the black river
 Cocytus, where they found the ferryman, Charon, old and squalid, but
 strong and vigorous, who was receiving passengers of all kinds into
 his boat, magnanimous heroes, boys and unmarried girls, as numerous as
 the leaves that fall at autumn, or the flocks that fly southward at
 the approach of winter. They stood pressing for a passage and
 longing to touch the opposite shore, But the stern ferryman took in
 only such as he chose, driving the rest back. AEneas, wondering at the
 sight, asked the Sibyl, "Why this discrimination?" She answered,
 "Those who are taken on board the bark are the souls of those who have
 received due burial rites; the host of others who have remained
 unburied are not permitted to pass the flood but wander a hundred
 years, and flit to and fro about the shore, till at last they are
 taken over." AEneas grieved at recollecting some of his own companions
 who had perished in the storm. At that moment he beheld Palinurus, his
 pilot, who fell overboard and was drowned. He addressed him and
 asked him the cause of his misfortune. Palinurus replied that the
 rudder was carried away, and he, clinging to it, was swept away with
 it. He besought AEneas most urgently to extend to him his hand and
 take him in company to the opposite shore. But the Sibyl rebuked him
 for the wish thus to transgress the laws of Pluto; but consoled him by
 informing him that the people of the shore where his body had been
 wafted by the waves should be stirred up by prodigies to give it due
 burial, and that the promontory should bear the name of Cape
 Palinurus, which it does to this day. Leaving Palinurus consoled by
 these words, they approached the boat. Charon, fixing his eyes sternly
 upon the advancing warrior, demanded by what right he, living and
 armed, approached that shore. To which the Sibyl replied that they
 would commit no violence, that AEneas's only object was to see his
 father, and finally exhibited the golden branch, at sight of which
 Charon's wrath relaxed, and he made haste to turn his bark to the
 shore, and receive them on board. The boat, adapted only to the
 light freight of bodiless spirits, groaned under the weight of the
 hero. They were soon conveyed to the opposite shore. There they were
 encountered by the three-headed dog, Cerberus, with his necks
 bristling with snakes. He barked with all his three throats till the
 Sibyl threw him a medicated cake which he eagerly devoured, and then
 stretched himself out in his den and fell asleep. AEneas and the Sibyl
 sprang to land. The first sound that struck their ears was the wailing
 of young children, who had died on the threshold of life, and near
 to these were they who had perished under false charges, Minos
 presides over them as judge, and examines the deeds of each. The
 next class was of those who had died by their own hand, hating life
 and seeking refuge in death. O how willingly would they now endure
 poverty, labour, and any other infliction, if they might but return to
 life! Next were situated the regions of sadness, divided off into
 retired paths, leading through groves of myrtle. Here roamed those who
 had fallen victims to unrequited love, not freed from pain even by
 death itself. Among these, AEneas thought he descried the form of
 Dido, with a wound still recent. In the dim light he was for a
 moment uncertain, but approaching, perceived it was indeed herself.
 Tears fell from his eyes, and he addressed her in the accents of love.
 "Unhappy Dido! was then the rumour true that you had perished? and was
 I, alas! the cause? I call the gods to witness that my departure
 from you was reluctant, and in obedience to the commands of Jove;
 nor could I believe that my absence would cost you so dear. Stop, I
 beseech you, and refuse me not a last farewell." She stood for a
 moment with averted countenance, and eyes fixed on the ground, and
 then silently passed on, as insensible to his pleadings as a rock.
 AEneas followed for some distance; then, with a heavy heart,
 rejoined his companion and resumed his route.
 </p>
 <p>They next entered the fields where roam the heroes who have fallen
 in battle. Here they saw many shades of Grecian and Trojan warriors.
 The Trojans thronged around him, and could not be satisfied with the
 sight. They asked the cause of his coming, and plied him with
 innumerable questions. But the Greeks, at the sight of his armour
 glittering through the murky atmosphere, recognized the hero, and
 filled with terror turned their backs and fled, as they used to do
 on the plains of Troy.
 </p>
 <p>AEneas would have lingered long with his Trojan friends, but the
 Sibyl hurried him away. They next came to a place where the road
 divided, the one leading to Elysium, the other to the regions of the
 condemned. AEneas beheld on one side the walls of a mighty city,
 around which Phlegethon rolled its fiery waters, Before him was the
 gate of adamant that neither gods nor men can break through. An iron
 tower stood by the gate, on which Tisiphone, the avenging Fury, kept
 guard. From the city were heard groans, and the sound of the
 scourge, the creaking of iron, and the clanking of chains. AEneas,
 horror-struck, inquired of his guide what crimes were those whose
 punishments produced the sounds he heard? The Sibyl answered, "Here is
 the judgment hall of Rhadamanthus, who brings to light crimes done
 in life, which the perpetrator vainly thought impenetrably hid.
 Tisiphone applies her whip of scorpions, and delivers the offender
 over to her sister Furies." At this moment with horrid clang the
 brazen gates unfolded, and AEneas saw within a Hydra with fifty
 heads guarding the entrance. The Sibyl told him that the gulf of
 Tartarus descended deep, so that its recesses were as far beneath
 their feet as heaven was high above their heads. In the bottom of this
 pit, the Titan race, who warred against the gods, lie prostrate;
 Salmoneus, also, who presumed to vie with Jupiter, and built a
 bridge of brass over which he drove his chariot that the sound might
 resemble thunder, launching flaming brands at his people in
 imitation of lightning, till Jupiter struck him with a real
 thunderbolt, and taught him the difference between mortal weapons
 and divine. Here, also, is Tityus, the giant, whose form is so immense
 that as he lies he stretches over nine acres, while a vulture preys
 upon his liver, which as fast as it is devoured grows again, so that
 his punishment will have no end.
 </p>
 <p>AEneas saw groups seated at tables loaded with dainties, while
 near by stood a Fury who snatched away the viands from their lips as
 fast as they prepared to taste them. Others beheld suspended over
 their heads huge rocks, threatening to fall, keeping them in a state
 of constant alarm. These were they who had hated their brothers, or
 struck their parents, or defrauded the friends who trusted them, or
 who, having grown rich, kept their money to themselves, and gave no
 share to others; the last being the most numerous class. Here also
 were those who had violated the marriage vow, or fought in a bad
 cause, or failed in fidelity to their employers. Here was one who
 had sold his country for gold, another who perverted the laws,
 making them say one thing to-day and another to-morrow.
 </p>
 <p>Ixion was there, fastened to the circumference of a wheel
 ceaselessly revolving; and Sisyphus, whose task was to roll a huge
 stone up to a hill-top, but when the steep was well-nigh gained, the
 rock, repulsed by some sudden force, rushed again-headlong down to the
 plain. Again he toiled at it, while the sweat bathed all his weary
 limbs, but all to no effect. There was Tantalus, who stood in a
 pool, his chin level with the water, yet he was parched with thirst,
 and found nothing to assuage it; for when he bowed his hoary head,
 eager to quaff, the water fled away, leaving the ground at his feet
 all dry. Tall trees laden with fruit stooped their heads to him,
 pears, pomegranates, apples, and luscious figs; but when with a sudden
 grasp he tried to seize them winds whirled them high above his reach.
 </p>
 <p>The Sibyl now warned AEneas it was time to turn from these
 melancholy regions and seek the city of the blessed. They passed
 through a middle tract of darkness, and came upon the Elysian
 fields, the groves where the happy reside. They breathed a freer
 air, and saw all objects clothed in a purple light. The region has a
 sun and stars of its own. The inhabitants were enjoying themselves
 in various ways, some in sports on the grassy turf, in games of
 strength or skill, others dancing or singing. Orpheus struck the
 chords of his lyre, and called forth ravishing sounds. Here AEneas saw
 the founders of the Trojan state, magnanimous heroes who lived in
 happier times. He gazed with admiration on the war chariots and
 glittering arms now reposing in disuse. Spears stood fixed in the
 ground, and the horses, unharnessed, roamed over the plain. The same
 pride in splendid armour and generous steeds which the old heroes felt
 in life, accompanied them here. He saw another group feasting and
 listening to the strains of music. They were in a laurel grove, whence
 the great river Po has its origin, and flows out among men. Here dwelt
 those who fell by wounds received in their country's cause, holy
 priests also, and poets who have uttered thoughts worthy of Apollo,
 and others who have contributed to cheer and adorn life by their
 discoveries in the useful arts, and have made their memory blessed
 by rendering service to mankind. They wore snow-white fillets about
 their brows. The Sibyl addressed a group of these, and inquired
 where Anchises was to be found. They were directed where to seek
 him, and soon found him in a verdant valley, where he was
 contemplating the ranks of his posterity, their destinies and worthy
 deeds to be achieved in coming times. When he recognized AEneas
 approaching, he stretched out both hands to him, while tears flowed
 freely. "Have you come at last," said he, "long expected, and do I
 behold you after such perils past? O my son, how have I trembled for
 you as I have watched your career!" To which AEneas replied, "O
 father! your image was always before me to guide and guard me." Then
 he endeavoured to enfold his father in his embrace, but his arms
 enclosed only an unsubstantial image.
 </p>
 <p>AEneas perceived before him a spacious valley, with trees gently
 waving to the wind, a tranquil landscape, through which the river
 Lethe flowed. Along the banks of the stream wandered a countless
 multitude, numerous as insects in the summer air. AEneas, with
 surprise, inquired who were these. Anchises answered, "They are
 souls to which bodies are to be given in due time. Meanwhile they
 dwell on Lethe's bank, and drink oblivion of their former lives." "O
 father!" said AEneas, "is it possible that any can be so in love
 with life as to wish to leave these tranquil seats for the upper
 world?" Anchises replied by explaining the plan of creation. The
 Creator, he told him, originally made the material of which souls
 are composed of the four elements, fire, air, earth, and water, all
 which when united took the form of the most excellent part, fire,
 and became flame. This material was scattered like seed among the
 heavenly bodies, the sun, moon, and stars. Of this seed the inferior
 gods created man and all other animals, mingling it with various
 proportions of earth, by which its purity was alloyed and reduced.
 Thus, the more earth predominates in the composition the less pure
 is the individual; and we see men and women with their full-grown
 bodies have not the purity of childhood. So in proportion to the
 time which the union of body and soul has lasted is the impurity
 contracted by the spiritual part. This impurity must be purged away
 after death, which is done by ventilating the souls in the current
 of winds, or merging them in water, or burning out their impurities by
 fire. Some few, of whom Anchises intimates that he is one, are
 admitted at once to Elysium, there to remain. But the rest, after
 the impurities of earth are purged away, are sent back to life endowed
 with new bodies, having had the remembrance of their former lives
 effectually washed away by the waters of Lethe. Some, however, there
 still are, so thoroughly corrupted, that they are not fit to be
 intrusted with human bodies, and these are made into brute animals,
 lions, tigers, cats, dogs, monkeys, etc. This is what the ancients
 called Metempsychosis, or the transmigration of souls; a doctrine
 which is still held by the natives of India, who scruple to destroy
 the life even of the most insignificant animal, not knowing but it may
 be one of their relations in an altered form.
 </p>
 <p>Anchises, having explained so much, proceeded to point out to AEneas
 individuals of his race, who were hereafter to be born, and to
 relate to him the exploits they should perform in the world. After
 this he reverted to the present, and told his son of the events that
 remained to him to be accomplished before the complete establishment
 of himself and his followers in Italy. Wars were to be waged,
 battles fought, a bride to be won, and in the result a Trojan state
 founded, from which should arise the Roman power, to be in time the
 sovereign of the world.
 </p>
 <p>AEneas and the Sibyl then took leave of Anchises, and returned by
 some short cut, which the poet does not explain, to the upper world.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ELYSIUM.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Virgil, we have seen, places his Elysium under the earth, and
 assigns it for a residence to the spirits of the blessed. But in Homer
 Elysium forms no part of the realms of the dead. He places it on the
 west of the earth, near Ocean, and describes it as a happy land, where
 there is neither snow, nor cold, nor rain, and always fanned by the
 delightful breezes of Zephyrus. Hither favoured heroes pass without
 dying and live happy under the rule of Rhadamanthus. The Elysium of
 Hesiod and Pindar is in the Isles of the Blessed, or Fortunate
 Islands, in the Western Ocean. From these sprang the legend of the
 happy island Atlantis. This blissful region may have been wholly
 imaginary, but possibly may have sprung from the reports of some
 storm-driven mariners who had caught a glimpse of the coast of
 America.
 
 </p>
 <p>J. R. Lowell, in one of his shorter poems, claims for the present
 age some of the privileges of that happy realm. Addressing the Past,
 he says:
 
 </p>
         "Whatever of true life there was in thee,<br>
          Leaps in our age's veins.<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .</h3>
 
          Here, 'mid the bleak waves of our strife and care,<br>
            Float the green 'Fortunate Isles,'<br>
          Where all thy hero-spirits dwell and share<br>
            Our martyrdoms and toils.<br>
              The present moves attended<br>
          With all of brave and excellent and fair<br>
              That made the old time splendid."<br>
 
 <p>Milton also alludes to the same fable in "Paradise Lost," Book
 III. 1. 568:
 
 </p>
         "Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old,<br>
          Fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales,<br>
          Thrice happy isles."<br>
 
 <p>And in Book II. he characterizes the rivers of Erebus according to
 the meaning of their names in the Greek language:
 
 </p>
         "Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate,<br>
          Sad Acheron of sorrow black and deep;<br>
          Cocytus named of lamentation loud<br>
          Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegethon<br>
          Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.<br>
          Far off from these a slow and silent stream,<br>
          Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls<br>
          Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks<br>
          Forthwith his former state and being forgets,<br>
          Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE SIBYL.</h3>
 
 <p>As AEneas and the Sibyl pursued their way back to earth, he said
 to her, "Whether thou be a goddess or a mortal beloved of the gods, by
 me thou shalt always be held in reverence. When I reach the upper
 air I will cause a temple to be built to thy honour, and will myself
 bring offerings." "I am no goddess," said the Sibyl; "I have no
 claim to sacrifice or offering. I am mortal; yet if I could have
 accepted the love of Apollo I might have been immortal. He promised me
 the fulfilment of my wish, if I would consent to be his. I took a
 handful of sand, and holding it forth, said, 'Grant me to see as
 many birthdays as there are sand grains in my hand.' Unluckily I
 forgot to ask for enduring youth. This also he would have granted,
 could I have accepted his love, but offended at my refusal, he allowed
 me to grow old. My youth and youthful strength fled long ago. I have
 lived seven hundred years, and to equal the number of the
 sand-grains I have still to see three hundred springs and three
 hundred harvests. My body shrinks up as years increase, and in time, I
 shall be lost to sight, but my voice will remain, and future ages will
 respect my sayings."
 </p>
 <p>These concluding words of the Sibyl alluded to her prophetic
 power. In her cave she was accustomed to inscribe on leaves gathered
 from the trees the names and fates of individuals. The leaves thus
 inscribed were arranged in order within the cave, and might be
 consulted by her votaries. But if perchance at the opening of the door
 the wind rushed in and dispersed the leaves the Sibyl gave no aid in
 restoring them again, and the oracle was irreparably lost.
 </p>
 <p>The following legend of the Sibyl is fixed at a later date. In the
 reign of one of the Tarquins there appeared before the king a woman
 who offered him nine books for sale, The king refused to purchase
 them, whereupon the woman went away and burned three of the books, and
 returning offered the remaining books for the same price she had asked
 for the nine. The king again rejected them; but when the woman,
 after burning three books more, returned and asked for the three
 remaining the same price which she had before asked for the nine,
 his curiosity was excited, and he purchased the books. They were found
 to contain the destinies of the Roman state. They were kept in the
 temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, preserved in a stone chest, and allowed
 to be inspected only by special officers appointed for that duty, who,
 on great occasions, consulted them and interpreted their oracles to
 the people.
 </p>
 <p>There were various Sibyls; but the Cumaean Sibyl, of whom Ovid and
 Virgil write, is the most celebrated of them. Ovid's story of her life
 protracted to one thousand years may be intended to represent the
 various Sibyls as being only reappearances of one and the same
 individual.
 
 </p>
 <p>Young, in the "Night Thoughts," alludes to the Sibyl. Speaking of
 Worldly Wisdom, he says:
 
 </p>
           "If future fate she plans 'tis all in leaves,<br>
            Like Sibyl, unsubstantial, fleeting bliss;<br>
            At the first blast it vanishes in air.<br>
            As worldly schemes resemble Sibyl's leaves,<br>
            The good man's days to Sibyl's books compare,<br>
            The price still rising as in number less."<br>
