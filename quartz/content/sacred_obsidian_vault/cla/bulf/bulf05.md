 <h2 align="CENTER">MIDAS- BAUCIS AND PHILEMON.</h2>
 
 <p>BACCHUS, on a certain occasion, found his old schoolmaster and
 foster-father, Silenus, missing. The old man had been drinking, and in
 that state wandered away, and was found by some peasants, who
 carried him to their king, Midas. Midas recognized him, and treated
 him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with an
 unceasing round of jollity. On the eleventh day he brought Silenus
 back, and restored him in safety to his pupil. Whereupon Bacchus
 offered Midas his choice of a reward, whatever he might wish. He asked
 that whatever he might touch should be changed into gold. Bacchus
 consented, though sorry that he had not made a better choice. Midas
 went his way, rejoicing in his new-acquired power, which he hastened
 to put to the test. He could scarce believe his eyes when he found a
 twig of an oak, which he plucked from the branch, become gold in his
 hand. He took up a stone; it changed to gold. He touched a sod; it did
 the same. He took up an apple from the tree; you would have thought he
 had robbed the garden of the Hesperides. His joy knew no bounds, and
 as soon as he got home, he ordered the servants to set a splendid
 repast on the table. Then he found to his dismay that whether he
 touched bread, it hardened in his hand; or put a morsel to his lip, it
 defied his teeth. He took a glass of wine, but it flowed down his
 throat like melted gold.
 </p>
 <p>In consternation at the unprecedented affliction, he strove to
 divest himself of his power; he hated the gift he had lately
 coveted. But all in vain; starvation seemed to await him. He raised
 his arms, all shining with gold, in prayer to Bacchus, begging to be
 delivered from his glittering destruction. Bacchus, merciful deity,
 herd and consented. "Go," said he, "to River Pactolus, trace its
 fountain-head, there plunge yourself and body in, and wash away your
 fault and its punishment." He did so, and scarce had he touched the
 waters before the gold-creating power passed into them, and the
 river sands became changed into gold, as they remain to this day.
 </p>
 <p>Thenceforth Midas, hating wealth and splendour, dwelt in the
 country, and became a worshipper of Pan, the god of the fields. On a
 certain occasion Pan had the temerity to compare his music with that
 of Apollo, and to challenge the god of the lyre to a trial of skill.
 The challenge was accepted, and Tmolus, the mountain god, was chosen
 umpire. The senior took his seat, and cleared away the trees from
 his ears to listen. At a given signal Pan blew on his pipes, and
 with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his
 faithful follower Midas, who happened to be present. Then Tmolus
 turned his head toward the Sun-god, and all his trees turned with him.
 Apollo rose, his brow wreathed with Parnassian laurel, while his
 robe of Tyrian purple swept the ground. In his left hand he held the
 lyre, and with his right hand struck the strings. Ravished with the
 harmony, Tmolus at once awarded the victory to the god of the lyre,
 and all but Midas acquiesced in the judgment. He dissented, and
 questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a
 depraved pair of ears any longer to wear the human form, but caused
 them to increase in length, grow hairy, within and without, and
 movable on their roots; in short, to be on the perfect pattern of
 those of an ass.
 </p>
 <p>Mortified enough was King Midas at this mishap: but he consoled
 himself with the thought that it was possible to hide his
 misfortune, which he attempted to do by means of an ample turban or
 head-dress. But his hair-dresser of course knew the secret. He was
 charged not to mention it, and threatened with dire punishment if he
 presumed to disobey. But he found it too much for his discretion to
 keep such a secret; so he went out into the meadow, dug a hole in
 the ground, and stooping down, whispered the story, and covered it up.
 Before long a thick bed of reeds sprang up in the meadow, and as
 soon as it had gained its growth, began whispering the story, and
 has continued to do so, from that day to this, every time a breeze
 passes over the place.
 
 </p>
 <p>The story of King Midas has been told by others with some
 variations. Dryden, in the "Wife of Bath's Tale," makes Midas's
 queen the betrayer of the secret:
 
 </p>
             "This Midas knew, and durst communicate<br>
              To none but to his wife his ears of state."<br>
 
 <p>Midas was king of Phrygia. He was the son of Gordius, a poor
 countryman, who was taken by the people and made king, in obedience to
 the command of the oracle, which had said that their future king
 should come in a wagon. While the people were deliberating, Gordius
 with his wife and son came driving his wagon into the public square.
 </p>
 <p>Gordius, being made king, dedicated his wagon to the deity of the
 oracle, and tied it up in its place with a fast knot. This was the
 celebrated Gordian knot, which, in after times it was said, whoever
 should untie should become lord of all Asia. Many tried to untie it,
 but none succeeded, till Alexander the Great, in his career of
 conquest, came to Phrygia. He tried his skill with as ill success as
 others, till growing impatient he drew his sword and cut the knot.
 When he afterwards succeeded in subjecting all Asia to his sway,
 people began to think that he had complied with the terms of the
 oracle according to its true meaning.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">BAUCIS AND PHILEMON.</h3>
 
 
 <p>On a certain hill in Phrygia stands a linden tree and an oak,
 enclosed by a low wall. Not far from the spot is a marsh, formerly
 good habitable land, but now indented with pools, the resort of
 fen-birds and cormorants. Once on a time Jupiter, in human shape,
 visited this country, and with him his son Mercury (he of the
 caduceus), without his wings. They presented themselves, as weary
 travellers, at many a door, seeking rest and shelter, but found all
 closed, for it was late, and the inhospitable inhabitants would not
 rouse themselves to open for their reception. At last a humble mansion
 received them, a small thatched cottage, where Baucis, a pious old
 dame, and her husband Philemon, united when young, had grown old
 together. Not ashamed of their poverty, they made it endurable by
 moderate desires and kind dispositions. One need not look there for
 master or for servant; they two were the whole household, master and
 servant alike. When the two heavenly guests crossed the humble
 threshold, and bowed their heads to pass under the low door, the old
 man placed a seat, on which Baucis, bustling and attentive, spread a
 cloth, and begged them to sit down. Then she raked out the coals
 from the ashes, and kindled up a fire, fed it with leaves and dry
 bark, and with her scanty breath blew it into a flame. She brought out
 of a corner split sticks and dry branches, broke them up, and placed
 them under the small kettle. Her husband collected some pot-herbs in
 the garden, and she shred them from the stalks, and prepared them
 for the pot. He reached down with a forked stick a flitch of bacon
 hanging in the chimney, cut a small piece, and put it in the pot to
 boil with the herbs, setting away the rest for another time. A beechen
 bowl was filled with warm water, that their guests might wash. While
 all was doing, they beguiled the time with conversation.
 </p>
 <p>On the bench designed for the guests was laid a cushion stuffed with
 sea-weed; and a cloth, only produced on great occasions, but ancient
 and coarse enough, was spread over that. The old lady, with her
 apron on, with trembling hand set the table. One leg was shorter
 than the rest, but a piece of slate put under restored the level. When
 fixed, she rubbed the table down with some sweet-smelling herbs.
 Upon it she set some of chaste Minerva's olives, some cornel berries
 preserved in vinegar, and added radishes and cheese, with eggs lightly
 cooked in the ashes. All were served in earthen dishes, and an
 earthenware pitcher, with wooden cups, stood beside them. When all was
 ready, the stew, smoking hot, was set on the table. Some wine, not
 of the oldest, was added; and for dessert, apples and wild honey;
 and over and above all, friendly faces, and simple but hearty welcome.
 </p>
 <p>Now while the repast proceeded, the old folks were astonished to see
 that the wine, as fast as it was poured out, renewed itself in the
 pitcher, of its own accord. Struck with terror, Baucis and Philemon
 recognized their heavenly guests, fell on their knees, and with
 clasped hands implored forgiveness for their poor entertainment. There
 was an old goose, which they kept as the guardian of their humble
 cottage; and they bethought them to make this a sacrifice in honour of
 their guests. But the goose, too nimble, with the aid of feet and
 wings, for the old folks, eluded their pursuit, and at last took
 shelter between the gods themselves. They forbade it to be slain;
 and spoke in these words: "We are gods. This inhospitable village
 shall pay the penalty of its impiety; you alone shall go free from the
 chastisement. Quit your house, and come with us to the top of yonder
 hill." They hastened to obey, and, staff in hand, laboured up the
 steep ascent. They had reached to within an arrow's flight of the top,
 when, turning their eyes below, they beheld all the country sunk in
 a lake, only their own house left standing. While they gazed with
 wonder at the sight, and lamented the fate of their neighbours, that
 old house of theirs was changed into a temple. Columns took the
 place of the corner posts, the thatch grew yellow and appeared a
 gilded roof, the floors became marble, the doors were enriched with
 carving and ornaments of old. Then spoke Jupiter in benignant accents:
 "Excellent old man, and woman worthy of such a husband, speak, tell us
 your wishes; what favour have you to ask of us?" Philemon took counsel
 with Baucis a few moments; then declared to the gods their united
 wish, "We ask to be priests and guardians of this your temple; and
 since here we have passed our lives in love and concord, we wish
 that one and the same hour may take us both from life, that I may
 not live to see her grave, nor be laid in my own by her." Their prayer
 was granted. They were the keepers of the temple as long as they
 lived. When grown very old, as they stood one day before the steps
 of the sacred edifice, and were telling the story of the place, Baucis
 saw Philemon begin to put forth leaves, and old Philemon saw Baucis
 changing in like manner. And now a leafy crown had grown over their
 heads, while exchanging parting words, as long as they could speak.
 "Farewell, dear spouse," they said, together, and at the same moment
 the bark closed over their mouths. The Tyanean shepherd still shows
 the two trees, standing side by side, made out of the two good old
 people.
 
 </p>
 <p>The story of Baucis and Philemon has been imitated by Swift, in a
 burlesque style, the actors in the change being two wandering
 saints, and the house being changed into a church, of which Philemon
 is made the parson. The following may serve as a specimen:
 
 </p>
             "They scarce had spoke, when, fair and soft,<br>
              The root began to mount aloft;<br>
              Aloft rose every beam and rafter;<br>
              The heavy wall climbed slowly after.<br>
              The chimney widened and grew higher,<br>
              Became a steeple with a spire.<br>
              The kettle to the top was hoist,<br>
              And there stood fastened to a joist,<br>
              But with the upside down, to show,<br>
              Its inclination for below;<br>
              In vain, for a superior force,<br>
              Applied at bottom, stops its course;<br>
              Doomed ever in suspense to dwell,<br>
              'Tis now no kettle, but a bell.<br>
              A wooden jack, which had almost<br>
              Lost by disuse the art to roast,<br>
              A sudden alteration feels.<br>
              Increased by new intestine wheels;<br>
              And, what exalts the wonder more,<br>
              The number made the motion slower;<br>
              The flier, though 't had leaden feet,<br>
              Turned round so quick you scarce could see 't;<br>
              But slackened by some secret power,<br>
              Now hardly moves an inch an hour.<br>
              The jack and chimney, near allied,<br>
              Had never left each other's side:<br>
              The chimney to a steeple grown,<br>
              The jack would not be left alone;<br>
              But up against the steeple reared,<br>
              Became a clock, and still adhered;<br>
              And still its love to household cares<br>
              By a shrill voice at noon declares,<br>
              Warning the cook-maid not to burn<br>
              That roast meat which it cannot turn.<br>
              The groaning chair began to crawl,<br>
              Like a huge snail, along the wall;<br>
              There stuck aloft in public view,<br>
              And with small change, a pulpit grew.<br>
              A bedstead of the antique mode,<br>
              Compact of timber many a load,<br>
              Such as our ancestors did use,<br>
              Was metamorphosed into pews,<br>
              Which still their ancient nature keep<br>
              By lodging folks disposed to sleep."<br>
