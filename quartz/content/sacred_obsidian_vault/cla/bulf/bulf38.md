 <h2 align="CENTER">THOR'S VISIT TO JOTUNHEIM.</h2>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THOR'S VISIT TO JOTUNHEIM, THE GIANT'S COUNTRY.</h3>
 
 
 <p>ONE day the god Thor, with his servant Thialfi, and accompanied by
 Loki, set out on a journey to the giant's country. Thialfi was of
 all men the swiftest of foot. He bore Thor's wallet, containing
 their provisions. When night came on they found themselves in an
 immense forest, and searched on all sides for a place where they might
 pass the night, and at last came to a very large hall, with an
 entrance that took the whole breadth of one end of the building.
 Here they lay down to sleep, but towards midnight were alarmed by an
 earthquake which shook the whole edifice. Thor, rising up, called on
 his companions to seek with him a place of safety. On the right they
 found an adjoining chamber, into which the others entered, but Thor
 remained at the doorway with his mallet in his hand, prepared to
 defend himself, whatever might happen. A terrible groaning was heard
 during the night, and at dawn of day Thor went out and found lying
 near him a huge giant, who slept and snored in the way that had
 alarmed them so. It is said that for once Thor was afraid to use his
 mallet, and as the giant soon waked up, Thor contented himself with
 simply asking his name.
 </p>
 <p>"My name is Skrymir," said the giant, "but I need not ask thy
 name, for I know that thou art the god Thor. But what has become of my
 glove?" Thor then perceived that what they had taken overnight for a
 hall was the giant's glove, and the chamber where his two companions
 had sought refuge was the thumb. Skrymir then proposed that they
 should travel in company, and Thor consenting, they sat down to eat
 their breakfast, and when they had done, Skrymir packed all the
 provisions into one wallet, threw it over his shoulder, and strode
 on before them, taking such tremendous strides that they were hard put
 to it to keep up with him. So they travelled the whole day, and at
 dusk Skrymir chose a place for them to pass the night in under a large
 oak tree. Skrymir then told them he would lie down to sleep. "But take
 ye the wallet," he added, "and prepare your supper."
 </p>
 <p>Skrymir soon fell asleep and began to snore strongly; but when
 Thor tried to open the wallet, he found the giant had tied it up so
 tight he could not untie a single knot. At last Thor became wroth, and
 grasping his mallet with both hands he struck a furious blow on the
 giant's head. Skrymir, awakening, merely asked whether a leaf had
 not fallen on his head, and whether they had supped and were ready
 to go to sleep. Thor answered that they were just going to sleep,
 and so saying went and laid himself down under another tree. But sleep
 came not that night to Thor, and when Skrymir snored again so loud
 that the forest re-echoed with the noise, he arose, and grasping his
 mallet launched it with such force at the giant's skull that it made a
 deep dint in it. Skrymir, awakening, cried out, "What's the matter?
 Are there any birds perched on this tree? I felt some moss from the
 branches fall on my head. How fares it with thee, Thor?" But Thor went
 away hastily, saying that he had just then awoke, and that as it was
 only midnight, there was still time for sleep. He, however, resolved
 that if he had an opportunity of striking a third blow, it should
 settle all matters between them. A little before daybreak he perceived
 that Skrymir was again fast asleep, and again grasping his mallet,
 he dashed it with such violence that it forced its way into the
 giant's skull up to the handle. But Skrymir sat up, and stroking his
 cheek said, "An acorn fell on my head. What! Art thou awake, Thor?
 Methinks it is time for us to get up and dress ourselves; but you have
 not now a long way before you to the city called Utgard. I have
 heard you whispering to one another that I am not a man of small
 dimensions; but if you come to Utgard you will see there many men much
 taller than I. Wherefore I advise you, when you come there, not to
 make too much of yourselves, for the followers of Utgard-Loki will not
 brook the boasting of such little fellows as you are. You must take
 the road that leads eastward, mine lies northward, so we must part
 here."
 </p>
 <p>Hereupon he threw his wallet over his shoulders and turned away from
 them into the forest, and Thor had no wish to stop him or to ask for
 any more of his company.
 </p>
 <p>Thor and his companions proceeded on their way, and towards noon
 descried a city standing in the middle of a plain. It was so lofty
 that they were obliged to bend their necks quite back on their
 shoulders in order to see to the top of it. On arriving they entered
 the city, and seeing a large palace before them with the door wide
 open, they went in, and found a number of men of prodigious stature,
 sitting on benches in the hall. Going further, they came before the
 king, Utgard-Loki, whom they saluted with great respect. The king,
 regarding them with a scornful smile, said, "If I do not mistake me,
 that stripling yonder must be the god Thor." Then addressing himself
 to Thor, he said, "Perhaps thou mayst be more than thou appearest to
 be. What are the feats that thou and thy fellows deem yourselves
 skilled in, for no one is permitted to remain here who does not, in
 some feat or other, excel all other men?"
 </p>
 <p>"The feat that I know," said Loki, "is to eat quicker than any one
 else, and in this I am ready to give a proof against any one here
 who may choose to compete with me."
 </p>
 <p>"That will indeed be a feat," said Utgard-Loki, "if thou
 performest what thou promisest, and it shall be tried forthwith."
 </p>
 <p>He then ordered one of his men who was sitting at the farther end of
 the bench, and whose name was Logi, to come forward and try his
 skill with Loki. A trough filled with meat having been set on the hall
 floor, Loki placed himself at one end, and Logi at the other, and each
 of them began to eat as fast as he could, until they met in the middle
 of the trough. But it was found that Loki had only eaten the flesh,
 while his adversary had devoured both flesh and bone, and the trough
 to boot. All the company therefore adjudged that Loki was vanquished.
 </p>
 <p>Utgard-Loki then asked what feat the young man who accompanied
 Thor could perform. Thialfi answered that he would run a race with any
 one who might be matched against him. The king observed that skill
 in running was something to boast of, but if the youth would win the
 match he must display great agility. He then arose and went with all
 who were present to a plain where there was good ground for running
 on, and calling a young man named Hugi, bade him run a match with
 Thialfi. In the first course Hugi so much outstripped his competitor
 that he turned back and met him not far from the starting place.
 Then they ran a second and a third time, but Thialfi met with no
 better success.
 </p>
 <p>Utgard-Loki then asked Thor in what feats he would choose to give
 proofs of that prowess for which he was so famous. Thor answered
 that he would try a drinking match with any one. Utgard-Loki bade
 his cupbearer bring the large horn which his followers were obliged to
 empty when they had trespassed in any way against the law of the
 feast. The cupbearer having presented it to Thor, Utgard-Loki said,
 "Whoever is a good drinker will empty that horn at a single draught,
 though most men make two of it, but the most puny drinker can do it in
 three."
 </p>
 <p>Thor looked at the horn, which seemed of no extraordinary size
 though somewhat long; however, as he was very thirsty, he set it to
 his lips, and without drawing breath, pulled as long and as deeply
 as he could, that he might not be obliged to make a second draught
 of it; but when he set the horn down and looked in, he could
 scarcely perceive that the liquor was diminished.
 </p>
 <p>After taking breath, Thor went to it again with all his might, but
 when he took the horn from his mouth, it seemed to him that he had
 drunk rather less than before, although the horn could now be
 carried without spilling.
 </p>
 <p>"How now, Thor?" said Utgard-Loki; "thou must not spare thyself;
 if thou meanest to drain the horn at the third draught thou must
 pull deeply; and I must needs say that thou wilt not be called so
 mighty a man here as thou art at home if thou showest no greater
 prowess in other feats than methinks will be shown in this."
 </p>
 <p>Thor, full of wrath, again set the horn to his lips, and did his
 best to empty it; but on looking in found the liquor was only a little
 lower, so he resolved to make no further attempt, but gave back the
 horn to the cupbearer.
 </p>
 <p>"I now see plainly," said Utgard-Loki, "that thou art not quite so
 stout as we thought thee: but wilt thou try any other feat, though
 methinks thou art not likely to bear any prize away with thee hence."
 </p>
 <p>"What new trial hast thou to propose?" said Thor.
 </p>
 <p>"We have a very trifling game here," answered Utgard-Loki, "in which
 we exercise none but children. It consists in merely lifting my cat
 from the ground; nor should I have dared to mention such a feat to the
 great Thor if I had not already observed that thou art by no means
 what we took thee for."
 </p>
 <p>As he finished speaking, a large grey cat sprang on the hall
 floor. Thor put his hand under the cat's belly and did his utmost to
 raise him from the floor, but the cat, bending his back, had,
 notwithstanding all Thor's efforts, only one of his feet lifted up,
 seeing which Thor made no further attempt.
 </p>
 <p>"This trial has turned out," said Utgard-Loki, "just as I imagined
 it would. The cat is large, but Thor is little in comparison to our
 men."
 </p>
 <p>"Little as ye call me," answered Thor, "let me see who among you
 will come hither now I am in wrath and wrestle with me."
 </p>
 <p>"I see no one here," said Utgard-Loki, looking at the men sitting on
 the benches, "who would not think it beneath him to wrestle with thee;
 let somebody, however, call hither that old crone, my nurse Elli,
 and let Thor wrestle with her if he will. She has thrown to the ground
 many a man not less strong than this Thor is."
 </p>
 <p>A toothless old woman then entered the hall, and was told by
 Utgard-Loki to take hold of Thor. The tale is shortly told. The more
 Thor tightened his hold on the crone the firmer she stood. At length
 after a very violent struggle Thor began to lose his footing, and
 was finally brought down upon one knee. Utgard-Loki then told them
 to desist, adding that Thor had now no occasion to ask any one else in
 the hall to wrestle with him, and it was also getting late; so he
 showed Thor and his companions to their seats, and they passed the
 night there in good cheer.
 </p>
 <p>The next morning, at break of day, Thor and his companions dressed
 themselves and prepared for their departure. Utgard-Loki ordered a
 table to be set for them, on which there was no lack of victuals or
 drink. After the repast Utgard-Loki led them to the gate of the
 city, and on parting asked Thor how he thought his journey had
 turned out, and whether he had met with any men stronger than himself.
 Thor told him that he could not deny but that he had brought great
 shame on himself. "And what grieves me most," he added, "is that ye
 will call me a person of little worth."
 </p>
 <p>"Nay," said Utgard-Loki, "it behooves me to tell thee the truth, now
 thou art out of the city, which so long as I live and have my way thou
 shalt never enter again. And, by my troth, had I known beforehand that
 thou hadst so much strength in thee, and wouldst have brought me so
 near to a great mishap, I would not have suffered thee to enter this
 time. Know then that I have all along deceived thee by my illusions;
 first in the forest, where I tied up the wallet with iron wire so that
 thou couldst not untie it. After this thou gavest me three blows
 with thy mallet; the first, though the least, would have ended my days
 had it fallen on me, but I slipped aside and thy blows fell on the
 mountain, where thou wilt find three glens, one of them remarkably
 deep. These are the dints made by thy mallet. I have made use of
 similar illusions in the contests you have had with my followers. In
 the first, Loki, like hunger itself, devoured all that was set
 before him, but Logi was in reality nothing else than Fire, and
 therefore consumed not only the meat, but the trough which held it.
 Hugi, with whom Thialfi contended in running, was Thought, and it
 was impossible for Thialfi to keep pace with that. When thou in thy
 turn didst attempt to empty the horn, thou didst perform, by my troth,
 a deed so marvellous that had I not seen it myself I should never have
 believed it. For one end of that horn reached the sea, which thou wast
 not aware of, but when thou comest to the shore thou wilt perceive how
 much the sea has sunk by thy draughts. Thou didst perform a feat no
 less wonderful by lifting up the cat, and to tell thee the truth, when
 we saw that one of his paws was off the floor, we were all of us
 terror-stricken, for what thou tookest for a cat was in reality the
 Midgard serpent that encompasseth the earth, and he was so stretched
 by thee that he was barely long enough to enclose it between his
 head and tail. Thy wrestling with Elli was also a most astonishing
 feat, for there was never yet a man, nor ever will be, whom Old Age,
 for such in fact was Elli, will not sooner or later lay low. But
 now, as we are going to part, let me tell thee that it will be
 better for both of us if thou never come near me again, for shouldst
 thou do so, I shall again defend myself by other illusions, so that
 thou wilt only lose thy labour and get no fame from the contest with
 me."
 </p>
 <p>On hearing these words Thor in a rage laid hold of his mallet and
 would have launched it at him, but Utgard-Loki had disappeared, and
 when Thor would have returned to the city to destroy it, he found
 nothing around him but a verdant plain.
