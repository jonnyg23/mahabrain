 <h2 align="CENTER">THE DEATH OF BALDUR- THE ELVES- RUNIC LETTERS-</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">SKALDS- ICELAND.</h3>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE DEATH OF BALDUR.</h3>
 
 
 <p>BALDUR the Good, having been tormented with terrible dreams
 indicating that his life was in peril, told them to the assembled
 gods, who resolved to conjure all things to avert from him the
 threatened danger. Then Frigga, the wife of Odin, exacted an oath from
 fire and water, from iron and all other metals, from stones, trees,
 diseases, beasts, birds, poisons, and creeping things, that none of
 them would do any harm to Baldur. Odin, not satisfied with all this,
 and feeling alarmed for the fate of his son, determined to consult the
 prophetess Angerbode, a giantess, mother of Fenris, Hela, and the
 Midgard serpent. She was dead, and Odin was forced to seek her in
 Hela's dominions. This Descent of Odin forms the subject of Gray's
 fine ode beginning:
 
 </p>
           "Uprose the king of men with speed<br>
            And saddled straight his coal-black steed."<br>
 
 <p>But the other gods, feeling that what Frigga had done was quite
 sufficient, amused themselves with using Baldur as a mark, some
 hurling darts at him, some stones, while others hewed at him with
 their swords and battle-axes; for do what they would, none of them
 could harm him. And this became a favourite pastime with them and
 was regarded as an honour shown to Baldur. But when Loki beheld the
 scene he was sorely vexed that Baldur was not hurt. Assuming,
 therefore, the shape of a woman, he went to Fensalir, the mansion of
 Frigga. That goddess, when she saw the pretended woman, inquired of
 her if she knew what the gods were doing at their meetings. She
 replied that they were throwing darts and stones at Baldur, without
 being able to hurt him. "Ay," said Frigga, "neither stones, nor
 sticks, nor anything else can hurt Baldur, for I have exacted an
 oath from all of them." "What," exclaimed the woman, "have all
 things sworn to spare Baldur?" "All things," replied Frigga, "except
 one little shrub that grows on the eastern side of Valhalla, and is
 called Mistletoe, and which I thought too young and feeble to crave an
 oath from."
 </p>
 <p>As soon as Loki heard this he went away, and resuming his natural
 shape, cut off the mistletoe, and repaired to the place where the gods
 were assembled. There he found Hodur standing apart, without partaking
 of the sports, on account of his blindness, and going up to him, said,
 "Why dost thou not also throw something at Baldur?"
 </p>
 <p>"Because I am blind," answered Hodur, "and see not where Baldur
 is, and have, moreover, nothing to throw."
 </p>
 <p>"Come, then," said Loki, "do like the rest, and show honour to
 Baldur by throwing this twig at him, and I will direct thy arm towards
 the place where he stands."
 </p>
 <p>Hodur then took the mistletoe, and under the guidance of Loki,
 darted it at Baldur, who, pierced through and through, fell down
 lifeless. Surely never was there witnessed, either among gods or
 men, a more atrocious deed than this. When Baldur fell, the gods
 were struck speechless with horror, and then they looked at each other
 and all were of one mind to lay hands on him who had done the deed,
 but they were obliged to delay their vengeance out of respect for
 the sacred place where they were assembled. They gave vent to their
 grief by loud lamentations. When the gods came to themselves, Frigga
 asked who among them wished to gain all her love and good will. "For
 this," said she, "shall he have who will ride to Hel and offer Hela
 a ransom if she will let Baldur return to Asgard." Whereupon Hermod,
 surnamed the Nimble, the son of Odin, offered to undertake the
 journey. Odin's horse, Sleipnir, which has eight legs and can outrun
 the wind, was then led forth, on which Hermod mounted and galloped
 away on his mission. For the space of nine days and as many nights
 he rode through deep glens so dark that he could not discern anything,
 until he arrived at the river Gyoll, which he passed over on a
 bridge covered with glittering gold. The maiden who kept the bridge
 asked him his name and lineage, telling him that the day before five
 bands of dead persons had ridden over the bridge, and did not shake it
 as much as he alone. "But," she added, "thou hast not death's hue on
 thee; why then ridest thou here on the way to Hel?"
 </p>
 <p>"I ride to Hel," answered Hermod, "to seek Baldur. Hast thou
 perchance seen him pass this way?"
 </p>
 <p>She replied, "Baldur hath ridden over Gyoll's bridge, and yonder
 lieth the way he took to the abodes of death."
 </p>
 <p>Hermod pursued his journey until he came to the barred gates of Hel.
 Here he alighted, girthed his saddle tighter, and remounting clapped
 both spurs to his horse, who cleared the gate by a tremendous leap
 without touching it. Hermod then rode on to the palace, where he found
 his brother Baldur occupying the most distinguished seat in the
 hall, and passed the night in his company. The next morning he
 besought Hela to let Baldur ride home with him, assuring her that
 nothing but lamentations were to be heard among the gods. Hela
 answered that it should now be tried whether Baldur was so beloved
 as he was said to be. "If, therefore," she added, "all things in the
 world, both living and lifeless, weep for him, then shall he return to
 life; but if any one thing speak against him or refuse to weep, he
 shall be kept in Hel."
 </p>
 <p>Hermod then rode back to Asgard and gave an account of all he had
 heard and witnessed.
 </p>
 <p>The gods upon this despatched messengers throughout the world to beg
 everything to weep in order that Baldur might be delivered from Hel.
 All things very willingly complied with this request, both men and
 every other living being, as well as earths, and stones, and trees,
 and metals, just as we have all seen these things weep when they are
 brought from a cold place into a hot one. As the messengers were
 returning, they found an old hag named Thaukt sitting in a cavern, and
 begged her to weep Baldur out of Hel. But she answered:
 
 </p>
                 "Thaukt will wail<br>
                  With dry tears<br>
                  Baldur's bale-fire.<br>
                  Let Hela keep her own."<br>
 
 <p>It was strongly suspected that this hag was no other than Loki
 himself, who never ceased to work evil among gods and men. So Baldur
 was prevented from coming back to Asgard.*
 
 </p>
 <p>* In Longfellow's Poems will be found a poem entitled "Tegner's
 Drapa," upon the subject of Baldur's death.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE FUNERAL OF BALDUR.</h3>
 
 
 <p>The gods took up the dead body and bore it to the seashore where
 stood Baldur's ship "Hringham," which passed for the largest in the
 world. Baldur's dead body was put on the funeral pile, on board the
 ship, and his wife Nanna was so struck with grief at the sight that
 she broke her heart, and her body was burned on the same pile with her
 husband's. There was a vast concourse of various kinds of people at
 Baldur's obsequies. First came Odin accompanied by Frigga, the
 Valkyrior, and his ravens; then Frey in his car drawn by Gullinbursti,
 the boar; Heimdall rode his horse Gulltopp, and Freya drove in her
 chariot drawn by cats. There were also a great many Frost giants and
 giants of the mountain present. Baldur's horse was led to the pile
 fully caparisoned and consumed in the same flames with his master.
 </p>
 <p>But Loki did not escape his deserved punishment. When he saw how
 angry the gods were, he fled to the mountain, and there built
 himself a hut with four doors, so that he could see every
 approaching danger. He invented a net to catch the fishes, such as
 fishermen have used since his time. But Odin found out his
 hiding-place and the gods assembled to take him. He, seeing this,
 changed himself into a salmon, and lay hid among the stones of the
 brook. But the gods took his net and dragged the brook, and Loki,
 finding he must be caught, tried to leap over the net; but Thor caught
 him by the tail and compressed it, so that salmons ever since have had
 that part remarkably fine and thin. They bound him with chains and
 suspended a serpent over his head, whose venom falls upon his face
 drop by drop. His wife Siguna sits by his side and catches the drops
 as they fall, in a cup; but when she carries it away to empty it,
 the venom falls upon Loki, which makes him howl with horror, and twist
 his body about so violently that the whole earth shakes, and this
 produces what men call earthquakes.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE ELVES.</h3>
 
 
 <p>The Edda mentions another class of beings, inferior to the gods, but
 still possessed of great power; these were called Elves. The white
 spirits, or Elves of Light, were exceedingly fair, more brilliant than
 the sun, and clad in garments of a delicate and transparent texture.
 They loved the light, were kindly disposed to mankind, and generally
 appeared as fair and lovely children. Their country was called
 Alfheim, and was the domain of Freyr, the god of the sun, in whose
 light they were always sporting.
 </p>
 <p>The black or Night Elves were a different kind of creatures. Ugly,
 long-nosed dwarfs, of a dirty brown colour, they appeared only at
 night, for they avoided the sun as their most deadly enemy, because
 whenever his beams fell upon any of them they changed them immediately
 into stones. Their language was the echo of solitudes, and their
 dwelling-places subterranean caves and clefts. They were supposed to
 have come into existence as maggots produced by the decaying flesh
 of Ymir's body, and were afterwards endowed by the gods with a human
 form and great understanding. They were particularly distinguished for
 a knowledge of the mysterious powers of nature, and for the runes
 which they carved and explained. They were the most skilful artificers
 of all created beings, and worked in metals and in wood. Among their
 most noted works were Thor's hammer, and the ship "Skidbladnir," which
 they gave to Freyr, and which was so large that it could contain all
 the deities with their war and household implements, but so
 skilfully was it wrought that when folded together it could be put
 into a side pocket.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">RAGNAROK, THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>It was a firm belief of the northern nations that a time would
 come when all the visible creation, the gods of Valhalla and
 Niffleheim, the inhabitants of Jotunheim, Alfheim, and Midgard,
 together with their habitations, would be destroyed. The fearful day
 of destruction will not, however, be without its forerunners. First
 will come a triple winter, during which snow will fall from the four
 corners of the heavens, the frost be very severe, the wind piercing,
 the weather tempestuous, and the sun impart no gladness. Three such
 winters will pass away without being tempered by a single summer.
 Three other similar winters will then follow, during which war and
 discord will spread over the universe. The earth itself will be
 frightened and begin to tremble, the sea leave its basin, the
 heavens tear asunder, and men perish in great numbers, and the
 eagles of the air feast upon their still quivering bodies. The wolf
 Fenris will now break his bands, the Midgard serpent rise out of her
 bed in the sea, and Loki, released from his bonds, will join the
 enemies of the gods. Amidst the general devastation the sons of
 Muspelheim will rush forth under their leader Surtur, before and
 behind whom are flames and burning fire. Onward they ride over
 Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, which breaks under the horses' hoofs. But
 they, disregarding its fall, direct their course to the battlefield
 called Vigrid. Thither also repair the wolf Fenris, the Midgard
 serpent, Loki with all the followers of Hela, and the Frost giants.
 </p>
 <p>Heimdall now stands up and sounds the Giallar horn to assemble the
 gods and heroes for the contest. The gods advance, led on by Odin, who
 engages the wolf Fenris, but falls a victim to the monster, who is,
 however, slain by Vidar, Odin's son. Thor gains great renown by
 killing the Midgard serpent, but recoils and falls dead, suffocated
 with the venom which the dying monster vomits over him. Loki and
 Heimdall meet and fight till they are both slain. The gods and their
 enemies having fallen in battle, Surtur, who has killed Freyr, darts
 fire and flames over the world, and the whole universe is burned up.
 The sun becomes dim, the earth sinks into the ocean, the stars fall
 from heaven, and time is no more.
 </p>
 <p>After this Alfadur (the Almighty) will cause a new heaven and a
 new earth to arise out of the sea. The new earth filled with
 abundant supplies will spontaneously produce its fruits without labour
 or care. Wickedness and misery will no more be known, but the gods and
 men will live happily together.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">RUNIC LETTERS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>One cannot travel far in Denmark, Norway, or Sweden without
 meeting with great stones of different forms, engraven with characters
 called Runic, which appear at first sight very different from all we
 know. The letters consist almost invariably of straight lines, in
 the shape of little sticks either singly or put together. Such
 sticks were in early times used by the northern nations for the
 purpose of ascertaining future events. The sticks were shaken up,
 and from the figures that they formed a kind of divination was
 derived.
 </p>
 <p>The Runic characters were of various kinds. They were chiefly used
 for magical purposes. The noxious, or, as they called them, the bitter
 runes, were employed to bring various evils on their enemies; the
 favourable averted misfortune. Some were medicinal, others employed to
 win love, etc. In later times they were frequently used for
 inscriptions, of which more than a thousand have been found. The
 language is a dialect of the Gothic, called Norse, still in use in
 Iceland. The inscriptions may therefore be read with certainty, but
 hitherto very few have been found which throw the least light on
 history. They are mostly epitaphs on tombstones.
 </p>
 <p>Gray's ode on the "Descent of Odin" contains an allusion to the
 use of Runic letters for incantation:
 
 </p>
           "Facing to the northern clime,<br>
            Thrice he traced the Runic rhyme;<br>
            Thrice pronounced, in accents dread<br>
            The thrilling verse that wakes the dead,<br>
            Till from out the hollow ground<br>
            Slowly breathed a sullen sound."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE SKALDS.</h3>
 
 <p>The Skalds were the bards and poets of the nation, a very
 important class of men in all communities in an early stage of
 civilization. They are the depositaries of whatever historic lore
 there is, and it is their office to mingle something of intellectual
 gratification with the rude feasts of the warriors, by rehearsing,
 with such accomplishments of poetry and music as their skill can
 afford, the exploits of their heroes, living or dead. The compositions
 of the Skalds were called Sagas, many of which have come down to us,
 and contain valuable materials of history, and a faithful picture of
 the state of society at the time to which they relate.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ICELAND.</h3>
 
 
 <p>The Eddas and Sagas have come to us from Iceland. The following
 extract from Carlyle's lectures on "Heroes and Hero Worship" gives
 an animated account of the region where the strange stories we have
 been reading had their origin. Let the reader contrast it for a moment
 with Greece, the parent of classical mythology:
 </p>
 <p>"In that strange island, Iceland,- burst up, the geologists say,
 by fire from the bottom of the sea, a wild land of barrenness and
 lava, swallowed many months of every year in black tempests, yet
 with a wild, gleaming beauty in summer time, towering up there stern
 and grim in the North Ocean, with its snow yokuls [mountains], roaring
 geysers [boiling springs], sulphur pools, and horrid volcanic
 chasms, like the waste, chaotic battlefield of Frost and Fire,- where,
 of all places, we least looked for literature or written memorials,-
 the record of these things was written down. On the seaboard of this
 wild land is a rim of grassy country, where cattle can subsist, and
 men by means of them and of what the sea yields; and it seems they
 were poetic men these, men who had deep thoughts in them and uttered
 musically their thoughts. Much would be lost had Iceland not been
 burst up from the sea, not been discovered by the Northmen!"
