 <h2 align="CENTER">VERTUMNUS AND POMONA.</h2>
 
 <p>THE Hamadryads were Wood-nymphs. Pomona was of this class. and no
 one excelled her in love of the garden and the culture of fruit. She
 cared not for forests and rivers, but loved the cultivated country,
 and trees that bear delicious apples. Her right hand bore for its
 weapon not a javelin, but a pruning-knife. Armed with this, she busied
 herself at one time to repress the too luxuriant growths: and
 curtail the branches that straggled out of place; at another, to split
 the twig and insert therein a graft, making the branch adopt a
 nursling not its own. She took care, too, that her favourites should
 not suffer from drought, and led streams of water by them, that the
 thirsty roots might drink. This occupation was her pursuit, her
 passion; and she was free from that which Venus inspires. She was
 not without fear of the country people, and kept her orchard locked,
 and allowed not men to enter. The Fauns and Satyrs would have given
 all they possessed to win her, and so would old Sylvanus, who looks
 young for his years, and Pan, who wears a garland of pine leaves
 around his head. But Vertumnus loved her best of all; yet he sped no
 better than the rest. O how often, in the disguise of a reaper, did he
 bring her corn in a basket, and looked the very image of a reaper!
 With a hay band tied round him, one would think he had just come
 from turning over the grass. Sometimes he would have an ox-goad in his
 hand, and you would have said he had just unyoked his weary oxen.
 Now he bore a pruning-hook, and personated a vine-dresser; and
 again, with a ladder on his shoulder, he seemed as if he was going
 to gather apples. Sometimes he trudged along as a discharged
 soldier, and again he bore a fishing-rod, as if going to fish. In this
 way he gained admission to her again and again, and fed his passion
 with the sight of her.
 </p>
 <p>One day he came in the guise of an old woman, her grey hair
 surmounted with a cap, and a staff in her hand. She entered the garden
 and admired the fruit. "It does you credit, my dear," she said, and
 kissed her not exactly with an old woman's kiss. She sat down on a
 bank, and looked up at the branches laden with fruit which hung over
 her. Opposite was an elm entwined with a vine loaded with swelling
 grapes. She praised the tree and its associated vine, equally.
 "But," said she, "if the tree stood alone, and had no vine clinging to
 it, it would have nothing to attract or offer us but its useless
 leaves. And equally the vine, if it were not twined round the elm,
 would lie prostrate on the ground. Why will you not take a lesson from
 the tree and the vine, and consent to unite yourself with some one?
 I wish you would. Helen herself had not more numerous suitors, nor
 Penelope, the wife of shrewd Ulysses. Even while you spurn them,
 they court you,- rural deities and others of every kind that
 frequent these mountains. But if you are prudent and want to make a
 good alliance, and will let an old woman advise you,- who loves you
 better than you have any idea of,- dismiss all the rest and accept
 Vertumnus, on my recommendation. I know him as well as he knows
 himself. He is not a wandering deity, but belongs to these
 mountains. Nor is he like too many of the lovers nowadays, who love
 any one they happen to see; he loves you, and you only. Add to this,
 he is young and handsome, and has the art of assuming any shape he
 pleases, and can make himself just what you command him. Moreover,
 he loves the same things that you do, delights in gardening, and
 handles your apples with admiration. But now he cares nothing for
 fruits nor flowers, nor anything else, but only yourself. Take pity on
 him, and fancy him speaking now with my mouth. Remember that the
 gods punish cruelty, and that Venus hates a hard heart, and will visit
 such offences sooner or later. To prove this, let me tell you a story,
 which is well known in Cyprus to be a fact; and I hope it will have
 the effect to make you more merciful.
 </p>
 <p>"Iphis was a young man of humble parentage, who saw and loved
 Anaxarete, a noble lady of the ancient family of Teucer. He
 struggled long with his passion, but when he found he could not subdue
 it, he came a suppliant to her mansion. First he told his passion to
 her nurse, and begged her as she loved her foster-child to favour
 his suit. And then he tried to win her domestics to his side.
 Sometimes he committed his vows to written tablets, and often hung
 at her door garlands which he had moistened with his tears. He
 stretched himself on her threshold, and uttered his complaints to
 the cruel bolts and bars. She was deafer than the surges which rise in
 the November gale; harder than steel from the German forges, or a rock
 that still clings to its native cliff. She mocked and laughed at
 him, adding cruel words to her ungentle treatment, and gave not the
 slightest gleam of hope.
 </p>
 <p>"Iphis could not any longer endure the torments of hopeless love,
 and, standing before her doors, he spake these last words: 'Anaxarete,
 you have conquered, and shall no longer have to bear my importunities.
 Enjoy your triumph! Sing songs of joy, and bind your forehead with
 laurel,- you have conquered! I die; stony heart, rejoice! This at
 least I can do to gratify you, and force you to praise me; and thus
 shall I prove that the love of you left me but with life. Nor will I
 leave it to rumour to tell you of my death. I will come myself, and
 you shall see me die, and feast your eyes on the spectacle. Yet, O
 ye Gods, who look down on mortal woes, observe my fate! I ask but
 this: let me be remembered in coming ages, and add those years to my
 fame which you have reft from my life.' Thus he said, and, turning his
 pale face and weeping eyes towards her mansion, he fastened a rope
 to the gate-post, on which he had often hung garlands, and putting his
 head into the noose, he murmured, 'This garland at least will please
 you, cruel girl!' and falling hung suspended with his neck broken.
 As he fell he struck against the gate, and the sound was as the
 sound of a groan. The servants opened the door and found him dead, and
 with exclamations of pity raised him and carried him home to his
 mother, for his father was not living. She received the dead body of
 her son, and folded the cold form to her bosom, while she poured forth
 the sad words which bereaved mothers utter. The mournful funeral
 passed through the town, and the pale corpse was borne on a bier to
 the place of the funeral pile. By chance the home of Anaxarete was
 on the street where the procession passed, and the lamentations of the
 mourners met the ears of her whom the avenging deity had already
 marked for punishment.
 </p>
 <p>"'Let us see this sad procession,' said she, and mounted to a
 turret, whence through an open window she looked upon the funeral.
 Scarce had her eyes rested upon the form of Iphis stretched on the
 bier, when they began to stiffen, and the warm blood in her body to
 become cold. Endeavouring to step back, she found she could not move
 her feet; trying to turn away her face, she tried in vain; and by
 degrees all her limbs became stony like her heart. That you may not
 doubt the fact, the statue still remains, and stands in the temple
 of Venus at Salamis, in the exact form of the lady. Now think of these
 things, my dear, and lay aside your scorn and your delays, and
 accept a lover. So may neither the vernal frosts blight your young
 fruits, nor furious winds scatter your blossoms!"
 </p>
 <p>When Vertumnus had spoken thus, be dropped the disguise of an old
 woman, and stood before her in his proper person, as a comely youth.
 It appeared to her like the sun bursting through a cloud. He would
 have renewed his entreaties, but there was no need; his arguments
 and the sight of his true form prevailed, and the Nymph no longer
 resisted, but owned a mutual flame.
 
 </p>
 <p>Pomona was the especial patroness of the Apple-orchard, and as
 such she was invoked by Phillips, the author of a poem on Cider, in
 blank verse. Thomson in the "Seasons" alludes to him:
 
 </p>
           "Phillips, Pomona's bard, the second thou<br>
            Who nobly durst, in rhyme-unfettered verse,<br>
            With British freedom, sing the British song."<br>
 
 <p>But Pomona was also regarded as presiding over other fruits, and
 as such is invoked by Thomson:
 
 </p>
           "Bear me, Pomona, to thy citron groves,<br>
            To where the lemon and the piercing lime,<br>
            With the deep orange, glowing through the green,<br>
            Their lighter glories blend. Lay me reclined<br>
            Beneath the spreading tamarind, that shakes,<br>
            Fanned by the breeze, its fever-cooling fruit."<br>
