 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XII.</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">CADMUS- THE MYRMIDONS.</h2>
 
 <p>JUPITER, under the disguise of a bull, had carried away Europa,
 the daughter of Agenor, king of Phoenicia. Agenor commanded his son
 Cadmus to go in search of his sister, and not to return without her.
 Cadmus went and sought long and far for his sister, but could not find
 her, and not daring to return unsuccessful, consulted the oracle of
 Apollo to know what country he should settle in. The oracle informed
 him that he should find a cow in the field, and should follow her
 wherever she might wander, and where she stopped, should build a
 city and call it Thebes. Cadmus had hardly left the Castalian cave,
 from which the oracle was delivered, when he saw a young cow slowly
 walking before him. He followed her close, offering at the same time
 his prayers to Phoebus. The cow went on till she passed the shallow
 channel of Cephisus and came out into the plain of Panope. There she
 stood still, raising her broad forehead to the sky filled the air with
 her lowings. Cadmus gave thanks, and stooping down kissed the
 foreign soil, then lifting his eyes, greeted the surrounding
 mountains. Wishing to offer a sacrifice to Jupiter, he sent his
 servants to seek pure water for a libation. Near by there stood an
 ancient grove which had never been profaned by the axe, in the midst
 of which there was a cave, thick covered with the growth of bushes,
 its roof forming a low arch, from beneath which burst forth a fountain
 of purest water. In the cave lurked a horrid serpent with a crested
 head and scales glittering like gold. His eyes shone like fire, his
 body was swollen with venom, he vibrated a triple tongue, and showed a
 triple row of teeth. No sooner had the Tyrians dipped their pitchers
 in the fountain, and the in-gushing waters made a sound, than the
 glittering serpent raised his head out of the cave and uttered a
 fearful hiss. The vessels fell from their hands, the blood left
 their cheeks, they trembled in every limb. The serpent, twisting his
 scaly body in a huge coil, raised his head so as to overtop the
 tallest trees, and while the Tyrians from terror could neither fight
 nor fly, slew some with his fangs, others in his folds, and others
 with his poisonous breath.
 </p>
 <p>Cadmus, having waited for the return of his men till midday, went in
 search of them. His covering was a lion's hide, and besides his
 Javelin he carried in his hand a lance, and in his breast a bold
 heart, a surer reliance than either. When he entered the wood and
 saw the lifeless bodies of his men, and the monster with his bloody
 jaws, he exclaimed, "O faithful friends, I will avenge you, or share
 your death." So saying he lifted a huge stone and threw it with all
 his force at the serpent. Such a block would have shaken the wall of a
 fortress, but it made no impression on the monster. Cadmus next
 threw his javelin, which met with better success, for it penetrated
 the serpent's scales, and pierced through to his entrails. Fierce with
 pain, the monster turned back his head to view the wound, and
 attempted to draw out the weapon with his mouth, but broke it off,
 leaving the iron point rankling in his flesh. His neck swelled with
 rage, bloody foam covered his jaws, and the breath of his nostrils
 poisoned the air around. Now he twisted himself into a circle, then
 stretched himself out on the ground like the trunk of a fallen tree.
 As he moved onward, Cadmus retreated before him, holding his spear
 opposite to the monster's opened jaws. The serpent snapped at the
 weapon and attempted to bite its iron point. At last Cadmus,
 watching his chance, thrust the spear at a moment when the animal's
 head thrown back came against the trunk of a tree, and so succeeded in
 pinning him to its side. His weight bent the tree as he struggled in
 the agonies of death.
 </p>
 <p>While Cadmus stood over his conquered foe, contemplating its vast
 size, a voice was heard (from whence he knew not, but he heard it
 distinctly) commanding him to take the dragon's teeth and sow them
 in the earth. He obeyed. He made a furrow in the ground, and planted
 the teeth, destined to produce a crop of men. Scarce had he done so
 when the clods began to move, and the points of spears to appear above
 the surface. Next helmets with their nodding plumes came up, and
 next the shoulders and breasts and limbs of men with weapons, and in
 time a harvest of armed warriors. Cadmus, alarmed, prepared to
 encounter a new enemy, but one of them said to him, "Meddle not with
 our civil war." With that he who had spoken smote one of his
 earth-born brothers with a sword, and he himself fell pierced with
 an arrow from another. The latter fell victim to a fourth, and in like
 manner the whole crowd dealt with each other till all fell, slain with
 mutual wounds, except five survivors. One of these cast away his
 weapons and said, "Brothers, let us live in peace!" These five
 joined with Cadmus in building his city, to which they gave the name
 of Thebes.
 </p>
 <p>Cadmus obtained in marriage Harmonia, the daughter of Venus. The
 gods left Olympus to honour the occasion with their presence, and
 Vulcan presented the bride with a necklace of surpassing brilliancy,
 his own workmanship. But a fatality hung over the family of Cadmus
 in consequence of his killing the serpent sacred to Mars. Semele and
 Ino, his daughters, and Actaeon and Pentheus, his grandchildren, all
 perished unhappily, and Cadmus and Harmonia quitted Thebes, now
 grown odious to them, and emigrated to the country of the
 Enchelians, who received them with honour and made Cadmus their
 king. But the misfortunes of their children still weighed upon their
 minds; and one day Cadmus exclaimed, "If a serpent's life is so dear
 to the gods, I would I were myself a serpent." No sooner had he
 uttered the words than he began to change his form. Harmonia beheld it
 and prayed to the gods to let her share his fate. Both became
 serpents. They live in the woods, but mindful of their origin, they
 neither avoid the presence of man nor do they ever injure any one.
 
 </p>
 <p>There is a tradition that Cadmus introduced into Greece the
 letters of the alphabet which were invented by the Phoenicians. This
 is alluded to by Byron, where, addressing the modern Greeks, he says:
 
 </p>
           "You have the letters Cadmus gave,<br>
            Think you he meant them for a slave?"<br>
 
 <p>Milton, describing the serpent which tempted Eve, is reminded of the
 serpents of the classical stories and says:
 
 </p>
           ..."-pleasing was his shape,<br>
           And lovely: never since the serpent kind<br>
           Lovelier; not those that in Illyria changed<br>
           Hermione and Cadmus, nor the god<br>
           In Epidaurus."<br>
 
 <p>For an explanation of the last allusion, see EPIDAURUS.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE MYRMIDONS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>The Myrmidons were the solders of Achilles, in the Trojan war.
 From them all zealous and unscrupulous followers of a political
 chief are called by that name, down to this day. But the origin of the
 Myrmidons would not give one the idea of a fierce and bloody race, but
 rather of a laborious and peaceful one.
 </p>
 <p>Cephalus, king of Athens, arrived in the island of AEgina to seek
 assistance of his old friend and ally AEacus, the king, in his war
 with Minos, king of Crete. Cephalus was most kindly received, and
 the desired assistance readily promised. "I have people enough,"
 said AEacus, "to protect myself and spare you such a force as you
 need." "I rejoice to see it," replied Cephalus, "and my wonder has
 been raised, I confess, to find such a host of youths as I see
 around me, all apparently of about the same age. Yet there are many
 individuals whom I previously knew, that I look for now in vain.
 What has become of them?" AEacus groaned, and replied with a voice
 of sadness, "I have been intending to tell you, and will now do so,
 without more delay, that you may see how from the saddest beginning
 a happy result sometimes flows. Those whom you formerly knew are now
 dust and ashes! A plague sent by angry Juno devastated the land. She
 hated it because it bore the name of one of her husband's female
 favourites. While the disease appeared to spring from natural causes
 we resisted it as we best might, by natural remedies; but it soon
 appeared that the pestilence was too powerful for our efforts, and
 we yielded. At the beginning the sky seemed to settle down upon the
 earth, and thick clouds shut in the heated air. For four months
 together a deadly south wind prevailed. The disorder affected the
 wells and springs; thousands of snakes crept over the land and shed
 their poison in the fountains. The force of the disease was first
 spent on the lower animals- dogs, cattle, sheep, and birds. The
 luckless ploughman wondered to see his oxen fall in the midst of their
 work, and lie helpless in the unfinished furrow. The wool fell from
 the bleating sheep, and their bodies pined away. The horse, once
 foremost in the race, contested the palm no more, but groaned at his
 stall and died an inglorious death. The wild boar forgot his rage, the
 stag his swiftness, the bears no longer attacked the herds. Everything
 languished; dead bodies lay in the roads, the fields, and the woods;
 the air was poisoned by them. I tell you what is hardly credible,
 but neither dogs nor birds would touch them, nor starving wolves.
 Their decay spread the infection. Next the disease attacked the
 country people, and then the dwellers in the city. At first the
 cheek was flushed, and the breath drawn with difficulty. The tongue
 grew rough and swelled, and the dry mouth stood open with its veins
 enlarged and gasped for the air. Men could not bear the heat of
 their clothes or their beds, but preferred to lie on the bare
 ground; and the ground did not cool them, but, on the contrary, they
 heated the spot where they lay. Nor could the physicians help, for the
 disease attacked them also, and the contact of the sick gave them
 infection, so that the most faithful were the first victims. At last
 all hope of relief vanished, and men learned to look upon death as the
 only deliverer from disease. Then they gave way to every
 inclination, and cared not to ask what was expedient, for nothing
 was expedient. All restraint laid aside, they crowded around the wells
 and fountains and drank till they died, without quenching thirst. Many
 had not strength to get away from the water, but died in the midst
 of the stream, and others would drink of it notwithstanding. Such
 was their weariness of their sick beds that some would creep forth,
 and if not strong enough to stand, would die on the ground. They
 seemed to hate their friends, and got away from their homes, as if,
 not knowing the cause of their sickness, they charged it on the
 place of their abode. Some were seen tottering along the road, as long
 as they could stand, while others sank on the earth, and turned
 their dying eyes around to take a last look, then closed them in
 death.
 </p>
 <p>"What heart had I left me, during all this, or what ought I to
 have had, except to hate life and wish to be with my dead subjects? On
 all sides lay my people strewn like over-ripened apples beneath the
 tree, or acorns under the storm-shaken oak. You see yonder a temple on
 the height. It is sacred to Jupiter. O how many offered prayers there,
 husbands for wives, fathers for sons, and died in the very act of
 supplication! How often, while the priest made ready for sacrifice,
 the victim fell, struck down by disease without waiting for the
 blow. At length all reverence for sacred things was lost. Bodies
 were thrown: out unburied, wood was wanting for funeral piles, men
 fought with one another for the possession of them. Finally there were
 none left to mourn; sons and husbands, old men and youths, Perished
 alike unlamented.
 </p>
 <p>"Standing before the altar I raised my eyes to heaven. 'O
 Jupiter,' I said, 'if thou art indeed my father, and art not ashamed
 of thy offspring, give me back my people, or take me also away!' At
 these words a clap of thunder was heard. 'I accept the omen,' I cried;
 'O may it be a sign of a favourable disposition towards me!' By chance
 there grew by the place where I stood an oak with wide-spreading
 branches, sacred to Jupiter. I observed a troop of ants busy with
 their labour, carrying minute grains in their mouths and following one
 another in a line up the trunk of the tree. Observing their numbers
 with admiration, I said, 'Give me, O father, citizens as numerous as
 these, and replenish my empty city.' The tree shook and gave a
 rustling sound with its branches, though no wind agitated them. I
 trembled in every limb, yet I kissed the earth and the tree. I would
 not confess to myself that I hoped, yet I did hope. Night came on
 and sleep took possession of my frame oppressed with cares. The tree
 stood before me in my dreams, with its numerous branches all covered
 with living, moving creatures. It seemed to shake its limbs and
 throw down over the ground a multitude of those industrious
 grain-gathering animals, which appeared to gain in size, and grow
 larger and larger, and by and by to stand erect, lay aside their
 superfluous legs and their black colour, and finally to assume the
 human form. Then I awoke, and my first impulse was to chide the gods
 who had robbed me of a sweet vision and given me no reality in its
 place. Being still in the temple, my attention was caught by the sound
 of many voices without; a sound of late unusual to my ears. While I
 began to think I was yet dreaming, Telamon, my son, throwing open
 the temple gates, exclaimed: 'Father, approach, and behold things
 surpassing even your hopes!' I went forth; I saw a multitude of men
 such as I had seen in my dream, and they were passing in procession in
 the same manner. While I gazed with wonder and delight they
 approached, and kneeling hailed me as their king. I paid my vows to
 Jove, and proceeded to allot the vacant city to the new-born race, and
 to parcel out the fields among them. I called them Myrmidons, from the
 ant (myrmex) from which they sprang. You have seen these persons;
 their dispositions resemble those which they had in their former
 shape. They are a diligent and industrious race, eager to gain, and
 tenacious of their gains. Among them you may recruit your forces. They
 will follow you to the war, young in years and bold in heart."

 <p>This description of the plague is coped by Ovid from the account
 which Thucydides, the Greek historian, gives of the plague of
 Athens. The historian drew from life, and all the poets and writers of
 fiction since his day, when they have had occasion to describe a
 similar scene, have borrowed their details from him.
