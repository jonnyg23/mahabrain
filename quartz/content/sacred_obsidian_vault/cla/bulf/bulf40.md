 <h2 align="CENTER">THE DRUIDS- IONA.</h2>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE DRUIDS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>THE Druids were the priests or ministers of religion among the
 ancient Celtic nations in Gaul, Britain, and Germany. Our
 information respecting them is borrowed from notices in the Greek
 and Roman writers; compared with the remains of Welsh and Gaelic
 poetry still extant.
 </p>
 <p>The Druids combined the functions of the priest, the magistrate, the
 scholar, and the physician. They stood to the people of the Celtic
 tribes in a relation closely analogous to that in which the Brahmans
 of India, the Magi of Persia, and the priests of the Egyptians stood
 to the people respectively by whom they were revered.
 </p>
 <p>The Druids taught the existence of one god, to whom they gave a name
 "Be' al," which Celtic antiquaries tell us means "the life of
 everything," or "the source of all beings," and which seems to have
 affinity with the Phoenician Baal. What renders this affinity more
 striking is that the Druids as well as the Phoenicians identified
 this, their supreme deity, with the Sun. Fire was regarded as a symbol
 of the divinity. The Latin writers assert that the Druids also
 worshipped numerous inferior gods.
 </p>
 <p>They used no images to represent the object of their worship, nor
 did they meet in temples or buildings of any kind for the
 performance of their sacred rites. A circle of stones (each stone
 generally of vast size), enclosing an area of from twenty feet to
 thirty yards in diameter, constituted their sacred place. The most
 celebrated of these now remaining is Stonehenge, on Salisbury Plain,
 England.
 </p>
 <p>These sacred circles were generally situated near some stream, or
 under the shadow of a grove or widespreading oak. In the centre of the
 circle stood the Cromlech or altar, which was a large stone, placed in
 the manner of a table upon other stones set up on end. The Druids
 had also their high places, which were large stones or piles of stones
 on the summits of hills. These were called Cairns, and were used in
 the worship of the deity under the symbol of the sun.
 </p>
 <p>That the Druids offered sacrifices to their deity there can be no
 doubt. But there is some uncertainty as to what they offered, and of
 the ceremonies connected with their religious services we know
 almost nothing. The classical (Roman) writers affirm that they offered
 on great occasions human sacrifices; as for success in war or for
 relief from dangerous diseases. Caesar has given a detailed account of
 the manner in which this was done. "They have images of immense
 size, the limbs of which are framed with twisted twigs and filled with
 living persons. These being set on fire, those within are
 encompassed by the flames." Many attempts have been made by Celtic
 writers to shake the testimony of the Roman historians to this fact,
 but without success.
 </p>
 <p>The Druids observed two festivals in each year. The former took
 place in the beginning of May, and was called Beltane or "fire of
 God." On this occasion a large fire was kindled on some elevated spot,
 in honour of the sun, whose returning beneficence they thus welcomed
 after the gloom and desolation of winter. Of this custom a trace
 remains in the name given to Whitsunday in parts of Scotland to this
 day. Sir Walter Scott uses the word in the "Boat Song" in the "Lady of
 the Lake":
 
 </p>
         "Ours is no sapling, chance sown by the fountain,<br>
          Blooming at Beltane in winter to fade;" etc.<br>
 
 <p>The other great festival of the Druids was called "Samh' in," or
 "fire of peace," and was held on Hallow-eve (first of November), which
 still retains this designation in the Highlands of Scotland. On this
 occasion the Druids assembled in solemn conclave, in the most
 central part of the district, to discharge the judicial functions of
 their order. All questions, whether public or private, all crimes
 against person or property, were at this time brought before them
 for adjudication. With these judicial acts were combined certain
 superstitious usages, especially the kindling of the sacred fire, from
 which all the fires in the district, which had been beforehand
 scrupulously extinguished, might be relighted. This usage of
 kindling fires on Hallow-eve lingered in the British islands long
 after the establishment of Christianity.
 </p>
 <p>Besides these two great annual festivals, the Druids were in the
 habit of observing the full moon, and especially the sixth day of
 the moon. On the latter they sought the Mistletoe, which grew on their
 favourite oaks, and to which, as well as to the oak itself, they
 ascribed a peculiar virtue and sacredness. The discovery of it was
 an occasion of rejoicing and solemn worship. "They call it," says
 Pliny, "by a word in their language, which means 'heal-all,' and
 having made solemn preparation for feasting and sacrifice under the
 tree, they drive thither two milk-white bulls, whose horns are then
 for the first time bound. The priest then, robed in white, ascends the
 tree, and cuts off the mistletoe with a golden sickle. It is caught in
 a white mantle, after which they proceed to slay the victims, at the
 same time praying that God would render his gift prosperous to those
 to whom he had given it." They drink the water in which it has been
 infused, and think it a remedy for all diseases. The mistletoe is a
 parasitic plant, and is not always nor often found on the oak, so that
 when it is found it is the more precious.
 </p>
 <p>The Druids were the teachers of morality as well as of religion.
 Of their ethical teaching a valuable specimen is preserved in the
 Triads of the Welsh Bards, and from this we may gather that their
 views of moral rectitude were on the whole just, and that they held
 and inculcated many very noble and valuable principles of conduct.
 They were also the men of science and learning of their age and
 people. Whether they were acquainted with letters or not has been
 disputed, though the probability is strong that they were, to some
 extent. But it is certain that they committed nothing of their
 doctrine, their history, or their poetry to writing. Their teaching
 was oral, and their literature (if such a word may be used in such a
 case) was preserved solely by tradition. But the Roman writers admit
 that "they paid much attention to the order and laws of nature, and
 investigated and taught to the youth under their charge many things
 concerning the stars and their motions, the size of the world and
 the lands, and concerning the might and power of the immortal gods."
 </p>
 <p>Their history consisted in traditional tales, in which the heroic
 deeds of their forefathers were celebrated. These were apparently in
 verse, and thus constituted part of the poetry as well as the
 history of the Druids. In the poems of Ossian we have, if not the
 actual productions of Druidical times, what may be considered faithful
 representations of the songs of the Bards.
 </p>
 <p>The Bards were an essential part of the Druidical hierarchy. One
 author, Pennant, says, "The Bards were supposed to be endowed with
 powers equal to inspiration. They were the oral historians of all past
 transactions, public and private. They were also accomplished
 genealogists," etc.
 </p>
 <p>Pennant gives a minute account of the Eisteddfods or sessions of the
 Bards and minstrels, which were held in Wales for many centuries, long
 after the Druidical priesthood in its other departments became
 extinct. At these meetings none but Bards of merit were suffered to
 rehearse their pieces, and minstrels of skill to perform. Judges
 were appointed to decide on their respective abilities, and suitable
 degrees were conferred. In the earlier period the judges were
 appointed by the Welsh princes, and after the conquest of Wales, by
 commission from the kings of England. Yet the tradition is that Edward
 I, in revenge for the influence of the Bards in animating the
 resistance of the people to his sway, persecuted them with great
 cruelty. This tradition has furnished the poet Gray with the subject
 of his celebrated ode, the "Bard."
 </p>
 <p>There are still occasional meetings of the lovers of Welsh poetry
 and music, held under the ancient name. Among Mrs. Hemans' poems is
 one written for an Eisteddfod, or meeting of Welsh Bards, held in
 London, May 22, 1822. It begins with a description of the ancient
 meeting, of which the following lines are a part:
 
 </p>
       "...midst the eternal cliffs, whose strength defied<br>
        The crested Roman in his hour of pride;<br>
        And where the Druid's ancient cromlech frowned,<br>
        And the oaks breathed mysterious murmurs round,<br>
        There thronged the inspired of yore! on plain or height,<br>
        In the sun's face, beneath the eye of light,<br>
        And baring unto heaven each noble head,<br>
        Stood in the circle, where none else might tread."<br>
 
 <p>The Druidical system was at its height at the time of the Roman
 invasion under Julius Caesar. Against the Druids, as their chief
 enemies, these conquerors of the world directed their unsparing
 fury. The Druids, harassed at all points on the mainland, retreated to
 Anglesey and Iona, where for a season they found shelter and continued
 their now dishonoured rites.
 </p>
 <p>The Druids retained their predominance in Iona and over the adjacent
 islands and mainland until they were supplanted and their
 superstitions overturned by the arrival of St. Columba, the apostle of
 the Highlands, by whom the inhabitants of that district were first led
 to profess Christianity.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">IONA.</h3>
 
 
 <p>One of the smallest of the British Isles, situated near a rugged and
 barren coast, surrounded by dangerous seas, and possessing no
 sources of internal wealth, Iona has obtained an imperishable place in
 history as the seat of civilization and religion at a time when the
 darkness of heathenism hung over almost the whole of Northern
 Europe. Iona or Icolmkill is situated at the extremity of the island
 of Mull, from which it is separated by a strait of half a mile in
 breadth, its distance from the mainland of Scotland being thirty-six
 miles.
 </p>
 <p>Columba was a native of Ireland, and connected by birth with the
 princes of the land. Ireland was at that time a land of gospel
 light, while the western and northern parts of Scotland were still
 immersed in the darkness of heathenism. Columba with twelve friends
 landed on the island of Iona in the year of our Lord 563, having
 made the passage in a wicker boat covered with hides. The Druids who
 occupied the island endeavoured to prevent his settling there, and the
 savage nations on the adjoining shores incommoded him with their
 hostility, and on several occasions endangered his rife by their
 attacks. Yet by his perseverance and zeal he surmounted all
 opposition, procured from the king a gift of the island, and
 established there a monastery of which he was the abbot. He was
 unwearied in his labours to disseminate a knowledge of the
 Scriptures throughout the Highlands and islands of Scotland, and
 such was the reverence paid him that though not a bishop, but merely a
 presbyter and monk, the entire province with its bishops was subject
 to him and his successors. The Pictish monarch was so impressed with a
 sense of his wisdom and worth that he held him in the highest
 honour, and the neighbouring chiefs and princes sought his counsel and
 availed themselves of his judgment in settling their disputes.
 </p>
 <p>When Columba landed on Iona he was attended by twelve followers whom
 he had formed into a religious body of which he was the head. To
 these, as occasion required, others were from time to time added, so
 that the original number was always kept up. Their institution was
 called a monastery and the superior an abbot, but the system had
 little in common with the monastic institutions of later times. The
 name by which those who submitted to the rule were known was that of
 Culdees, probably from the Latin "cultores Dei"- worshippers of God.
 They were a body of religious persons associated together for the
 purpose of aiding each other in the common work of preaching the
 gospel and teaching youth, as well as maintaining in themselves the
 fervour of devotion by united exercises of worship. On entering the
 order certain vows were taken by the members, but they were not
 those which were usually imposed by monastic orders, for of these,
 which are three- celibacy, poverty, and obedience,- the Culdees were
 bound to none except the third. To poverty they did not bind
 themselves; on the contrary they seem to have laboured diligently to
 procure for themselves and those dependent on them the comforts of
 life. Marriage also was allowed them, and most of them seem to have
 entered into that state. True, their wives were not permitted to
 reside with them at the institution, but they had a residence assigned
 to them in an adjacent locality, Near Iona there is an island which
 still bears the name of "Eilen nam ban," women's island, where their
 husbands seem to have resided with them, except when duty required
 their presence in the school or the sanctuary.
 
 </p>
 <p>Campbell, in his poem of "Reullura," alludes to the married monks of
 Iona:
 
 </p>
           "...The pure Culdees<br>
              Were Albyn's earliest priests of God,<br>
            Ere yet an island of her seas<br>
              By foot of Saxon monk was trod,<br>
            Long ere her churchmen by bigotry<br>
            Were barred from holy wedlock's tie.<br>
            'Twas then that Aodh, famed afar,<br>
              In Iona preached the word with power,<br>
            And Reullura, beauty's star,<br>
              Was the partner of his bower."<br>
 
 <p>In one of his "Irish Melodies," Moore gives the legend of St.
 Senanus and the lady who sought shelter on the island, but was
 repulsed:
 
 </p>
           "O, haste and leave this sacred isle,<br>
            Unholy bark, ere morning smile;<br>
            For on thy deck, though dark it be,<br>
                A female form I see;<br>
            And I have sworn this sainted sod<br>
            Shall ne'er by woman's foot be trod."<br>
 
 <p>In these respects and in others the Culdees departed from the
 established rules of the Romish church, and consequently were deemed
 heretical. The consequence was that as the power of the latter
 advanced that of the Culdees was enfeebled. It was not, however,
 till the thirteenth century that the communities of the Culdees were
 suppressed and the members dispersed. They still continued to labour
 as individuals, and resisted the inroads of Papal usurpation as they
 best might till the light of the Reformation dawned on the world.
 </p>
 <p>Iona, from its position in the western seas, was exposed to the
 assaults of the Norwegian and Danish rovers by whom those seas were
 infested, and by them it was repeatedly pillaged, its dwellings
 burned, and its peaceful inhabitants put to the sword. These
 unfavourable circumstances led to its gradual decline, which was
 expedited by the subversion of the Culdees throughout Scotland.
 Under the reign of Popery the island became the seat of a nunnery, the
 ruins of which are still seen. At the Reformation, the nuns were
 allowed to remain, living in community, when the abbey was dismantled.
 </p>
 <p>Iona is now chiefly resorted to by travellers on account of the
 numerous ecclesiastical and sepulchral remains which are found upon
 it. The principal of these are the Cathedral or Abbey Church and the
 Chapel of the Nunnery. Besides these remains of ecclesiastical
 antiquity, there are some of an earlier date, and pointing to the
 existence on the island of forms of worship and belief different
 from those of Christianity. These are the circular Cairns which are
 found in various parts, and which seem to have been of Druidical
 origin. It is in reference to all these remains of ancient religion
 that Johnson exclaims, "That man is little to be envied whose
 patriotism would not gain force upon the plains of Marathon, or
 whose piety would not grow warmer amid the ruins of Iona."
 </p>
 <p>In the "Lord of the Isles," Scott beautifully contrasts the church
 on Iona with the cave of Staffa, opposite:
 
 </p>
           "Nature herself, it seemed, would raise<br>
            A minster to her Maker's praise!<br>
            Not for a meaner use ascend<br>
            Her columns, or her arches bend;<br>
            Nor of a theme less solemn tells<br>
            That mighty surge that ebbs and swells,<br>
            And still between each awful pause,<br>
            From the high vault an answer draws,<br>
            In varied tone, prolonged and high,<br>
            That mocks the organ's melody;<br>
            Nor doth its entrance front in vain<br>
            To old Iona's holy fane,<br>
            That Nature's voice might seem to say,<br>
            Well hast thou done, frail child of clay!<br>
            Thy humble powers that stately shrine<br>
            Tasked high and hard- but witness mine!"<br>
