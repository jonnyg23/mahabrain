 <h2 align="CENTER">CUPID AND PSYCHE.</h2>
 
 <p>A CERTAIN king and queen had three daughters. The charms of the
 two elder were more than common, but the beauty of the youngest was so
 wonderful that the poverty of language is unable to express its due
 praise. The fame of her beauty was so great that strangers from
 neighbouring countries came in crowds to enjoy the sight, and looked
 on her with amazement, paying her that homage which is due only to
 Venus herself. In fact Venus found her altars deserted, while men
 turned their devotion to this young virgin. As she passed along, the
 people sang her praises, and strewed her way with chaplets and
 flowers.
 </p>
 <p>This perversion of homage due only to the immortal powers to the
 exaltation of a mortal gave great offence to the real Venus. Shaking
 her ambrosial locks with indignation, she exclaimed, "Am I then to
 be eclipsed in my honours by a mortal girl? In vain then did that
 royal shepherd, whose judgment was approved by Jove himself, give me
 the palm of beauty over my illustrious rivals, Pallas and Juno. But
 she shall not so quietly usurp my honours. I will give her cause to
 repent of so unlawful a beauty."
 </p>
 <p>Thereupon she calls her winged son Cupid, mischievous enough in
 his own nature, and rouses and provokes him yet more by her
 complaints. She points out Psyche to him and says, "My dear son,
 punish that contumacious beauty; give thy mother a revenge as sweet as
 her injuries are great; infuse into the bosom of that haughty girl a
 passion for some low, mean, unworthy being, so that she may reap a
 mortification as great as her present exultation and triumph."
 </p>
 <p>Cupid prepared to obey the commands of his mother. There are two
 fountains in Venus's garden, one of sweet waters, the other of bitter.
 Cupid filled two amber vases, one from each fountain, and suspending
 them from the top of his quiver, hastened to the chamber of Psyche,
 whom he found asleep. He shed a few drops from the bitter fountain
 over her lips, though the sight of her almost moved him to pity;
 then touched her side with the point of his arrow. At the touch she
 awoke, and opened eyes upon Cupid (himself invisible), which so
 startled him that in his confusion he wounded himself with his own
 arrow. Heedless of his wound, his whole thought now was to repair
 the mischief he had done, and he poured the balmy drops of joy over
 all her silken ringlets.
 </p>
 <p>Psyche, henceforth frowned upon by Venus, derived no benefit from
 all her charms. True, all eyes were cast eagerly upon her, and every
 mouth spoke her praises; but neither king, royal youth, nor plebeian
 presented himself to demand her in marriage. Her two elder sisters
 of moderate charms had now long been married to two royal princes; but
 Psyche, in her lonely apartment, deplored her solitude, sick of that
 beauty which, while it procured abundance of flattery, had failed to
 awaken love.
 </p>
 <p>Her parents, afraid that they had unwittingly incurred the anger
 of the gods, consulted the oracle of Apollo, and received this answer:
 "The virgin is destined for the bride of no mortal lover. Her future
 husband awaits her on the top of the mountain. He is a monster whom
 neither gods nor men can resist."
 </p>
 <p>This dreadful decree of the oracle filled all the people with
 dismay, and her parents abandoned themselves to grief. But Psyche
 said, "Why, my dear parents, do you now lament me? You should rather
 have grieved when the people showered upon me undeserved honours,
 and with one voice called me a Venus. I now perceive that I am a
 victim to that name. I submit. Lead me to that rock to which my
 unhappy fate has destined me." Accordingly, all things being prepared,
 the royal maid took her place in the procession, which more
 resembled a funeral than a nuptial pomp, and with her parents, amid
 the lamentations of the people, ascended the mountain, on the summit
 of which they left her alone, and with sorrowful hearts returned home.
 </p>
 <p>While Psyche stood on the ridge of the mountain, panting with fear
 and with eyes full of tears, the gentle Zephyr raised her from the
 earth and bore her with an easy motion into a flowery dale. By degrees
 her mind became composed, and she laid herself down on the grassy bank
 to sleep. When she awoke refreshed with sleep, she looked round and
 beheld near by a pleasant grove of tall and stately trees. She entered
 it, and in the midst discovered a fountain, sending forth clear and
 crystal waters, and fast by, a magnificent palace whose august front
 impressed the spectator that it was not the work of mortal hands,
 but the happy retreat of some god. Drawn by admiration and wonder, she
 approached the building and ventured to enter. Every object she met
 filled her with pleasure and amazement. Golden pillars supported the
 vaulted roof, and the walls were enriched with carvings and
 paintings representing beasts of the chase and rural scenes, adapted
 to delight the eye of the beholder. Proceeding onward, she perceived
 that besides the apartments of state there were others filled with all
 manner of treasures, and beautiful and precious productions of
 nature and art.
 </p>
 <p>While her eyes were thus occupied, a voice addressed her, though she
 saw no one, uttering these words: "Sovereign lady, all that you see is
 yours. We whose voices you hear are your servants and shall obey all
 your commands with our utmost care and diligence. Retire, therefore,
 to your chamber and repose on your bed of down, and when you see fit
 repair to the bath. Supper awaits you in the adjoining alcove when
 it pleases you to take your seat there."
 </p>
 <p>Psyche gave ear to the admonitions of her vocal attendants, and
 after repose and the refreshment of the bath, seated herself in the
 alcove, where a table immediately presented itself, without any
 visible aid from waiters or servants, and covered with the greatest
 delicacies of food and the most nectareous wines. Her ears too were
 feasted with music from invisible performers; of whom one sang,
 another played on the lute, and all closed in the wonderful harmony of
 a full chorus.
 </p>
 <p>She had not yet seen her destined husband. He came only in the hours
 of darkness and fled before the dawn of morning, but his accents
 were full of love, and inspired a like passion in her. She often
 begged him to stay and let her behold him, but he would not consent.
 On the contrary he charged her to make no attempt to see him, for it
 was his pleasure, for the best of reasons, to keep concealed. "Why
 should you wish to behold me?" he said; "have you any doubt of my
 love? have you any wish ungratified? If you saw me, perhaps you
 would fear me, perhaps adore me, but all I ask of you is to love me. I
 would rather you would love me as an equal than adore me as a god."
 </p>
 <p>This reasoning somewhat quieted Psyche for a time, and while the
 novelty lasted she felt quite happy. But at length the thought of
 her parents, left in ignorance of her fate, and of her sisters,
 precluded from sharing with her the delights of her situation,
 preyed on her mind and made her begin to feel her palace as but a
 splendid prison, When her husband came one night, she told him her
 distress, and at last drew from him an unwilling consent that her
 sisters should be brought to see her.
 </p>
 <p>So, calling Zephyr, she acquainted him with her husband's
 commands, and he, promptly obedient, soon brought them across the
 mountain down to their sister's valley. They embraced her and she
 returned their caresses. "Come," said Psyche, "enter with me my
 house and refresh yourselves with whatever your sister has to
 offer." Then taking their hands she led them into her golden palace,
 and committed them to the care of her numerous train of attendant
 voices, to refresh them in her baths and at her table, and to show
 them all her treasures. The view of these celestial delights caused
 envy to enter their bosoms, at seeing their young sister possessed
 of such state and splendour so much exceeding their own.
 </p>
 <p>They asked her numberless questions, among others what sort of a
 person her husband was. Psyche replied that he was a beautiful
 youth, who generally spent the daytime in hunting upon the
 mountains. The sisters, not satisfied with this reply, soon made her
 confess that she had never seen him. Then they proceeded to fill her
 bosom with dark suspicions. "Call to mind," they said, "the Pythian
 oracle that declared you destined to marry a direful and tremendous
 monster. The inhabitants of this valley say that your husband is a
 terrible and monstrous serpent, who nourishes you for a while with
 dainties that he may by and by devour you. Take our advice. Provide
 yourself with a lamp and a sharp knife; put them in concealment that
 your husband may not discover them, and when he is sound asleep,
 slip out of bed, bring forth your lamp, and see for yourself whether
 what they say is true or not. If it is, hesitate not to cut off the
 monster's head, and thereby recover your liberty."
 </p>
 <p>Psyche resisted these persuasions as well as she could, but they did
 not fail to have their effect on her mind, and when her sisters were
 gone, their words and her own curiosity were too strong for her to
 resist. So she prepared her lamp and a sharp knife, and hid them out
 of sight of her husband. When he had fallen into his first sleep,
 she silently rose and uncovering her lamp beheld not a hideous
 monster, but the most beautiful and charming of the gods, with his
 golden ringlets wandering over his snowy neck and crimson cheek,
 with two dewy wings on his shoulders, whiter than snow, and with
 shining feathers like the tender blossoms of spring. As she leaned the
 lamp over to have a nearer view of his face a drop of burning oil fell
 on the shoulder of the god, startled with which he opened his eyes and
 fixed them full upon her; then, without saying one word, he spread his
 white wings and flew out of the window. Psyche, in vain endeavouring
 to follow him, fell from the window to the ground. Cupid, beholding
 her as she lay in the dust, stopped his flight for an instant and
 said, "O foolish Psyche, is it thus you repay my love? After having
 disobeyed my mother's commands and made you my wife, will you think me
 a monster and cut off my head? But go; return to your sisters, whose
 advice you seem to think preferable to mine. I inflict no other
 punishment on you than to leave you for ever. Love cannot dwell with
 suspicion." So saying, he fled away, leaving poor Psyche prostrate
 on the ground, filling the place with mournful lamentations.
 </p>
 <p>When she had recovered some degree of composure she looked around
 her, but the palace and gardens had vanished, and she found herself in
 the open field not far from the city where her sisters dwelt. She
 repaired thither and told them the whole story of her misfortunes,
 at which, pretending to grieve, those spiteful creatures inwardly
 rejoiced. "For now," said they, "he will perhaps choose one of us."
 With this idea, without saying a word of her intentions, each of
 them rose early the next morning and ascended the mountain, and having
 reached the top, called upon Zephyr to receive her and bear her to his
 lord; then leaping up, and not being sustained by Zephyr, fell down
 the precipice and was dashed to pieces.
 </p>
 <p>Psyche meanwhile wandered day and night, without food or repose,
 in search of her husband. Casting her eyes on a lofty mountain
 having on its brow a magnificent temple, she sighed and said to
 herself, "Perhaps my love, my lord, inhabits there," and directed
 her steps thither.
 </p>
 <p>She had no sooner entered than she saw heaps of corn, some in
 loose ears and some in sheaves, with mingled ears of barley. Scattered
 about, lay sickles and rakes, and all the instruments of harvest,
 without order, as if thrown carelessly out of the weary reapers' hands
 in the sultry hours of the day.
 </p>
 <p>This unseemly confusion the pious Psyche put an end to, by
 separating and sorting everything to its proper place and kind,
 believing that she ought to neglect none of the gods, but endeavour by
 her piety to engage them all in her behalf. The holy Ceres, whose
 temple it was, finding her so religiously employed, thus spoke to her:
 "O Psyche, truly worthy of our pity, though I cannot shield you from
 the frowns of Venus, yet I can teach you how best to allay her
 displeasure. Go, then, and voluntarily surrender yourself to your lady
 and sovereign, and try by modesty and submission to win her
 forgiveness, and perhaps her favour will restore you the husband you
 have lost."
 </p>
 <p>Psyche obeyed the commands of Ceres and took her way to the temple
 of Venus, endeavouring to fortify her mind and ruminating on what
 she should say and how best propitiate the angry goddess, feeling that
 the issue was doubtful and perhaps fatal.
 </p>
 <p>Venus received her with angry countenance. "Most undutiful and
 faithless of servants," said she, "do you at last remember that you
 really have a mistress? Or have you rather come to see your sick
 husband, yet laid up of the wound given him by his loving wife? You
 are so ill-favoured and disagreeable that the only way you can merit
 your lover must be by dint of industry and diligence. I will make
 trial of your housewifery." Then she ordered Psyche to be led to the
 storehouse of her temple, where was laid up a great quantity of wheat,
 barley, millet, vetches, beans, and lentils prepared for food for
 her pigeons, and said, "Take and separate all these grains, putting
 all of the same kind in a parcel by themselves, and see that you get
 it done before evening." Then Venus departed and left her to her task.
 </p>
 <p>But Psyche, in a perfect consternation at the enormous work, sat
 stupid and silent, without moving a finger to the inextricable heap.
 </p>
 <p>While she sat despairing, Cupid stirred up the little ant, a
 native of the fields, to take compassion on her. The leader of the
 ant-hill, followed by whole hosts of his six-legged subjects,
 approached the heap, and with the utmost diligence taking grain by
 grain, they separated the pile, sorting each kind to its parcel; and
 when it was all done, they vanished out of sight in a moment.
 </p>
 <p>Venus at the approach of twilight returned from the banquet of the
 gods. breathing odours and crowned with roses. Seeing the task done,
 she exclaimed, "This is no work of yours, wicked one, but his, whom to
 your own and his misfortune you have enticed." So saying, she threw
 her a piece of black bread for her supper and went away.
 </p>
 <p>Next morning Venus ordered Psyche to be called and said to her,
 "Behold yonder grove which stretches along the margin of the water.
 There you will find sheep feeding without a shepherd, with
 golden-shining fleeces on their backs. Go, fetch me a sample of that
 precious wool gathered from every one of their fleeces."
 </p>
 <p>Psyche obediently went to the riverside, prepared to do her best
 to execute the command. But the river god inspired the reeds with
 harmonious murmurs, which seemed to say, "O maiden, severely tried,
 tempt not the dangerous flood, nor venture among the formidable rams
 on the other side, for as long as they are under the influence of
 the rising sun, they burn with a cruel rage to destroy mortals with
 their sharp horns or rude teeth. But when the noontide sun has
 driven the cattle to the shade, and the serene spirit of the flood has
 lulled them to rest, you may then cross in safety, and you will find
 the woolly gold sticking to the bushes and the trunks of the trees."
 </p>
 <p>Thus the compassionate river god gave Psyche instructions how to
 accomplish her task, and by observing his directions she soon returned
 to Venus with her arms full of the golden fleece; but she received not
 the approbation of her implacable mistress, who said, "I know very
 well it is by none of your own doings that you have succeeded in
 this task, and I am not satisfied yet that you have any capacity to
 make yourself useful. But I have another task for you. Here, take this
 box and go your way to the infernal shades, and give this box to
 Proserpine and say, 'My mistress Venus desires you to send her a
 little of your beauty, for in tending her sick son she has lost some
 of her own.' Be not too long on your errand, for I must paint myself
 with it to appear at the circle of the gods and goddesses this
 evening."
 </p>
 <p>Psyche was now satisfied that her destruction was at hand, being
 obliged to go with her own feet directly down to Erebus. Wherefore, to
 make no delay of what was not to be avoided, she goes to the top of
 a high tower to precipitate herself headlong, thus to descend the
 shortest way to the shades below. But a voice from the tower said to
 her, "Why, poor unlucky girl, dost thou design to put an end to thy
 days in so dreadful a manner? And what cowardice makes thee sink under
 this last danger who hast been so miraculously supported in all thy
 former?" Then the voice told her how by a certain cave she might reach
 the realms of Pluto, and how to avoid all the dangers of the road,
 to pass by Cerberus, the three-headed dog, and prevail on Charon,
 the ferryman, to take her across the black river and bring her back
 again. But the voice added, "When Proserpine has given you the box
 filled with her beauty, of all things this is chiefly to be observed
 by you, that you never once open or look into the box nor allow your
 curiosity to pry into the treasure of the beauty of the goddesses."
 </p>
 <p>Psyche, encouraged by this advice, obeyed it in all things, and
 taking heed to her ways travelled safely to the kingdom of Pluto.
 She was admitted to the palace of Proserpine, and without accepting
 the delicate seat or delicious banquet that was offered her, but
 contented with coarse bread for her food, she delivered her message
 from Venus. Presently the box was returned to her, shut and filled
 with the precious commodity. Then she returned the way she came, and
 glad was she to come out once more into the light of day.
 </p>
 <p>But having got so far successfully through her dangerous task a
 longing desire seized her to examine the contents of the box,
 "What," said she, "shall I, the carrier of this divine beauty, not
 take the least bit to put on my cheeks to appear to more advantage
 in the eyes of my beloved husband!" So she carefully opened the box,
 but found nothing there of any beauty at all, but an infernal and
 truly Stygian sleep, which being thus set free from its prison, took
 possession of her, and she fell down in the midst of the road, a
 sleepy corpse without sense or motion.
 </p>
 <p>But Cupid, being now recovered from his wound, and not able longer
 to bear the absence of his beloved Psyche, slipping through the
 smallest crack of the window of his chamber which happened to be
 left open, flew to the spot where Psyche lay, and gathering up the
 sleep from her body closed it again in the box, and waked Psyche
 with a light touch of one of his arrows. "Again," said he, "hast
 thou almost perished by the same curiosity. But now perform exactly
 the task imposed on you by my mother, and I will take care of the
 rest.
 </p>
 <p>Then Cupid, as swift as lightning penetrating the heights of heaven,
 presented himself before Jupiter with his supplication. Jupiter lent a
 favouring ear, and pleaded the cause of the lovers so earnestly with
 Venus that he won her consent. On this he sent Mercury to bring Psyche
 up to the heavenly assembly, and when she arrived, handing her a cup
 of ambrosia, he said, "Drink this, Psyche, and be immortal; nor
 shall Cupid ever break away from the knot in which he is tied, but
 these nuptials shall be perpetual."
 </p>
 <p>Thus Psyche became at last united to Cupid, and in due time they had
 a daughter born to them whose name was Pleasure.
 </p>
 <p>The fable of Cupid and Psyche is usually considered allegorical. The
 Greek name for a butterfly is Psyche, and the same word means the
 soul. There is no illustration of the immortality of the soul so
 striking and beautiful as the butterfly, bursting on brilliant wings
 from the tomb in which it has lain, after a dull, grovelling,
 caterpillar existence, to flutter in the blaze of day and feed on
 the most fragrant and delicate productions of the spring. Psyche,
 then, is the human soul, which is purified by sufferings and
 misfortunes, and is thus prepared for the enjoyment of true and pure
 happiness.
 </p>
 <p>In works of art Psyche is represented as a maiden with the wings
 of a butterfly, along with Cupid, in the different situations
 described in the allegory.
 </p>
 <p>Milton alludes to the story of Cupid and Psyche in the conclusion of
 his "Comus":
 
 </p>
           "Celestial Cupid, her famed son, advanced,<br>
            Holds his dear Psyche sweet entranced,<br>
            After her wandering labours long,<br>
            Till free consent the gods among<br>
            Make her his eternal bride;<br>
            And from her fair unspotted side<br>
            Two blissful twins are to be born,<br>
            Youth and Joy; so Jove hath sworn."<br>
 
 <p>The allegory of the story of Cupid and Psyche is well presented in
 the beautiful lines of T. K. Harvey:
 
 </p>
       "They wove bright fables in the days of old,<br>
          When reason borrowed fancy's painted wings;<br>
        When truth's clear river flowed o'er sands of gold,<br>
          And told in song its high and mystic things!<br>
        And such the sweet and solemn tale of her<br>
          The pilgrim heart, to whom a dream was given,<br>
        That led her through the world,- Love's worshipper,-<br>
          To seek on earth for him whose home was heaven!<br>
 
       "In the full city,- by the haunted fount,-<br>
          Through the dim grotto's tracery of spars,-<br>
        'Mid the pine temples, on the moonlit mount,<br>
          Where silence sits to listen to the stars;<br>
        In the deep glade where dwells the brooding dove,<br>
          The painted valley, and the scented air,<br>
        She heard far echoes of the voice of Love,<br>
          And found his footsteps' traces everywhere.<br>
 
       "But nevermore they met! since doubts and fears,<br>
          Those phantom shapes that haunt and blight the earth,<br>
        Had come 'twixt her, a child of sin and tears,<br>
          And that bright spirit of immortal birth;<br>
        Until her pining soul and weeping eyes<br>
        Had learned to seek him only in the skies;<br>
        Till wings unto the weary heart were given,<br>
        And she became Love's angel bride in heaven!"<br>
 
 <p>The story of Cupid and Psyche first appears in the works of
 Apuleius, a writer of the second century of our era. It is therefore
 of much more recent date than most of the legends of the Age of Fable.
 It is this that Keats alludes to in his "Ode to Psyche":
 
 </p>
       "O latest born and loveliest vision far<br>
          Of all Olympus' faded hierarchy!<br>
        Fairer than Phoebe's sapphire-regioned star<br>
          Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky;<br>
        Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,<br>
          Nor altar heaped with flowers;<br>
        Nor virgin choir to make delicious moan<br>
          Upon the midnight hours;<br>
        No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet,<br>
          From chain-swung censer teeming;<br>
        No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat<br>
          Of pale-mouthed prophet dreaming."<br>
 
 <p>In Moore's "Summer Fete" a fancy ball is described, in which one
 of the characters personated is Psyche-
 
 </p>
       "...not in dark disguise to-night<br>
        Hath our young heroine veiled her light;-<br>
        For see, she walks the earth, Love's own.<br>
            His wedded bride, by holiest vow<br>
        Pledged in Olympus, and made known<br>
            To mortals by the type which now<br>
            Hangs glittering on her snowy brow,<br>
          That butterfly, mysterious trinket,<br>
        Which means the soul, (though few would think it,)<br>
          And sparkling thus on brow so white<br>
          Tells us we've Psyche here to-night."<br>
