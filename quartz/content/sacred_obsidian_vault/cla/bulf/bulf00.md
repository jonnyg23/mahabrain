 <h2 align="CENTER">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
 
 <p>THE religions of ancient Greece and Rome are extinct. The
 so-called divinities of Olympus have not a single worshipper among
 living men. They belong now not to the department of theology, but
 to those of literature and taste. There they still hold their place,
 and will continue to hold it, for they are too closely connected
 with the finest productions of poetry and art, both ancient and
 modern, to pass into oblivion.
 </p>
 <p>We propose to tell the stories relating to them which have come down
 to us from the ancients, and which are alluded to by modern poets,
 essayists, and orators. Our readers may thus at the same time be
 entertained by the most charming fictions which fancy has ever
 created, and put in possession of information indispensable to every
 one who would read with intelligence the elegant literature of his own
 day.
 </p>
 <p>In order to understand these stories, it will be necessary to
 acquaint ourselves with the ideas of the structure of the universe
 which prevailed among the Greeks- the people from whom the Romans, and
 other nations through them, received their science and religion.
 </p>
 <p>The Greeks believed the earth to be flat and circular, their own
 country occupying the middle of it, the central point being either
 Mount Olympus, the abode of the gods, or Delphi, so famous for its
 oracle.
 </p>
 <p>The circular disk of the earth was crossed from west to east and
 divided into two equal parts by the Sea, as they called the
 Mediterranean, and its continuation the Euxine, the only seas with
 which they were acquainted.
 </p>
 <p>Around the earth flowed the River Ocean, its course being from south
 to north on the western side of the earth, and in a contrary direction
 on the eastern side. It flowed in a steady, equable current, unvexed
 by storm or tempest. The sea, and all the rivers on earth, received
 their waters from it.
 </p>
 <p>The northern portion of the earth was supposed to be inhabited by
 a happy race named the Hyperboreans, dwelling in everlasting bliss and
 spring beyond the lofty mountains whose caverns were supposed to
 send forth the piercing blasts of the north wind, which chilled the
 people of Hellas (Greece). Their country was inaccessible by land or
 sea. They lived exempt from disease or old age, from toils and
 warfare. Moore has given us the "Song of a Hyperborean," beginning
 
 </p>
            "I come from a land in the sun-bright deep,<br>
               Where golden gardens glow,<br>
             Where the winds of the north, becalmed in sleep,<br>
               Their conch shells never blow."<br>
 
 <p>On the south side of the earth, close to the stream of Ocean,
 dwelt a people happy and virtuous as the Hyperboreans. They were named
 the AEthiopians. The gods favoured them so highly that they were
 wont to leave at times their Olympian abodes and go to share their
 sacrifices and banquets.
 </p>
 <p>On the western margin of the earth, by the stream of Ocean, lay a
 happy place named the Elysian Plain, whither mortals favoured by the
 gods were transported without tasting of death, to enjoy an
 immortality of bliss. This happy region was also called the "Fortunate
 Fields," and the "Isles of the Blessed."
 </p>
 <p>We thus see that the Greeks of the early ages knew little of any
 real people except those to the east and south of their own country,
 or near the coast of the Mediterranean. Their imagination meantime
 peopled the western portion of this sea with giants, monsters, and
 enchantresses, while they placed around the disk of the earth, which
 they probably regarded as of no great width, nations enjoying the
 peculiar favour of the gods, and blessed with happiness and longevity.
 </p>
 <p>The Dawn, the Sun, and the Moon were supposed to rise out of the
 Ocean, on the eastern side, and to drive through the air, giving light
 to gods and men. The stars, also, except those forming the Wain or
 Bear, and others near them, rose the stream of Ocean. There the
 sun-god embarked in a winged boat, which conveyed him round by the
 northern part of the earth, back to his place of rising in the east.
 Milton alludes to this in his "Comus":
 
 </p>
                "Now the gilded car of day<br>
                 His golden axle doth allay<br>
                 In the steep Atlantic stream,<br>
                 And the slope Sun his upward beam<br>
                 Shoots against the dusky pole,<br>
                 Facing towards the other goal<br>
                 Of his chamber in the east."<br>
 
 <p>The abode of the gods was on the summit of Mount Olympus, in
 Thessaly. A gate of clouds, kept by the godesses named the Seasons,
 opened to permit the passage of the Celestials to earth, and to
 receive them on their return. The gods had their separate dwellings;
 but all, when summoned, repaired to the palace of Jupiter, as did also
 those deities whose usual abode was the earth, the waters, or the
 under-world. It was also in the great hall of the palace of the
 Olympian king that the gods feasted each day on ambrosia and nectar,
 their food and drink, the latter being handed round by the lovely
 goddess Hebe. Here they conversed of the affairs of heaven and
 earth; and as they quaffed their nectar, Apollo, the god of music,
 delighted them with the tones of his lyre, to which the Muses sang
 in responsive strains. When the sun was set, the gods retired to sleep
 in their respective dwellings.
 </p>
 <p>The following lines from the "Odyssey" will show how Homer conceived
 of Olympus:
 
 </p>
            "So saying, Minerva, goddess azure-eyed,<br>
             Rose to Olympus, the reputed seat<br>
             Eternal of the gods, which never storms<br>
             Disturb, rains drench, or snow invades, but calm<br>
             The expanse and cloudless shines with purest day.<br>
             There the inhabitants divine rejoice<br>
             For ever."                              Cowper.<br>
 
 <p>The robes and other parts of the dress of the goddesses were woven
 by Minerva and the Graces, and everything of a more solid nature was
 formed of the various metals. Vulcan was architect, smith, armourer,
 chariot builder, and artist of all work in Olympus. He built of
 brass the houses of the gods; he made for them the golden shoes with
 which they trod the air or the water, and moved from place to place
 with the speed of the wind, or even of thought. He also shod with
 brass the celestial steeds, which whirled the chariots of the gods
 through the air, or along the surface of the sea. He was able to
 bestow on his workmanship self-motion, so that the tripods (chairs and
 tables) could move of themselves in and out of the celestial hall.
 He even endowed with intelligence the golden handmaidens whom he
 made to wait on himself.
 </p>
 <p>Jupiter, or Jove (Zeus*), though called the father of gods and
 men, had himself a beginning. Saturn (Cronos) was his father, and Rhea
 (Ops) his mother. Saturn and Rhea were of the race of Titans, who were
 the children of Earth and Heaven, which sprang from Chaos, of which we
 shall give a further account in our next chapter.
 
 </p>
 <p>* The names in parentheses are the Greek, the others being the Roman
 or Latin names.
 
 </p>
 <p>There is another cosmogony, or account of the creation, according to
 which Earth, Erebus, and Love were the first of beings. Love (Eros)
 issued from the egg of Night, which floated on Chaos. By his arrows
 and torch he pierced and vivified all things, producing life and joy.
 </p>
 <p>Saturn and Rhea were not the only Titans. There were others, whose
 names were Oceanus, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Ophion, males; and
 Themis, Mnemosyne, Eurynome, females. They are spoken of as the
 elder gods, whose dominion was afterwards transferred to others.
 Saturn yielded to Jupiter, Oceanus to Neptune, Hyperion to Apollo.
 Hyperion was the father of the Sun, Moon, and Dawn. He is therefore
 the original sun-god, and is painted with the splendour and beauty
 which were afterwards bestowed on Apollo.
 
 </p>
          "Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself."<br>
                                                  Shakespeare.<br>
 
 <p>Ophion and Eurynome ruled over Olympus till they were dethroned by
 Saturn and Rhea. Milton alludes to them in "Paradise Lost." He says
 the heathens seem to have had some knowledge of the temptation and
 fall of man.
 
 </p>
          "And fabled how the serpent, whom they called<br>
           Ophion, with Eurynome, (the wide-<br>
           Encroaching Eve perhaps,) had first the rule<br>
           Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driven."<br>
 
 <p>The representations given of Saturn are not very consistent; for
 on the one hand his reign is said to have been the golden age of
 innocence and purity, and on the other he is described as a monster
 who devoured his children.* Jupiter, however, escaped this fate, and
 when grown up espoused Metis (Prudence), who administered a draught to
 Saturn which caused him to disgorge his children. Jupiter, with his
 brothers and sisters, now rebelled against their father Saturn and his
 brothers the Titans; vanquished them, and imprisoned some of them in
 Tartarus, inflicting other penalties on others. Atlas was condemned to
 bear up the heavens on his shoulders.
 
 </p>
 <p>* This inconsistency arises from considering the Saturn of the
 Romans the same with the Grecian deity Cronos (Time), which, as it
 brings an end to all things which have had a beginning, may be said to
 devour its own offspring.
 
 </p>
 <p>On the dethronement of Saturn, Jupiter with his brothers Neptune
 (Poseidon) and Pluto (Dis) divided his dominions. Jupiter's portion
 was the heavens, Neptune's the ocean, and Pluto's the realms of the
 dead. Earth and Olympus were common property. Jupiter was king of gods
 and men. The thunder was his weapon, and he bore a shield called
 AEgis, made for him by Vulcan. The eagle was his favourite bird, and
 bore his thunderbolts.
 </p>
 <p>Juno (Hera) was the wife of Jupiter, and queen of the gods. Iris,
 the goddess of the rainbow, was her attendant and messenger. The
 peacock was her favourite bird.
 </p>
 <p>Vulcan (Hephaestos), the celestial artist, was the son of Jupiter
 and Juno. He was born lame, and his mother was so displeased at the
 sight of him that she flung him out of heaven. Other accounts say that
 Jupiter kicked him out for taking part with his mother in a quarrel
 which occurred between them. Vulcan's lameness, according to this
 account, was the consequence of his fall. He was a whole day
 falling, and at last alighted in the Island of Lemnos, which was
 thenceforth sacred to him. Milton alludes to this story in "Paradise
 Lost,"
 Book I.:
 
 </p>
                                               "...From morn<br>
               To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,<br>
               A summer's day; and with the setting sun<br>
               Dropped from the zenith, like a falling star,<br>
               On Lemnos, the AEgean isle."<br>
 
 <p>Mars (Ares), the god of war, was the son of Jupiter and Juno,
 </p>
 <p>Phoebus Apollo, the god of archery, prophecy, and music, was the son
 of Jupiter and Latona, and brother of Diana (Artemis). He was god of
 the sun, as Diana, his sister, was the goddess of the moon.
 </p>
 <p>Venus (Aphrodite), the goddess of love and beauty, was the
 daughter of Jupiter and Dione. Others say that Venus sprang from the
 foam of the sea. The zephyr wafted her along the waves to the Isle
 of Cyprus, where she was received and attired by the Seasons, and then
 led to the assembly of the gods. All were charmed with her beauty, and
 each one demanded her for his wife. Jupiter gave her to Vulcan, in
 gratitude for the service he had rendered in forging thunderbolts.
 So the most beautiful of the goddesses became the wife of the most
 ill-favoured of gods. Venus possessed an embroidered girdle called
 Cestus, which had the power of inspiring love. Her favourite birds
 were swans and doves, and the plants sacred to her were the rose and
 the myrtle.
 </p>
 <p>Cupid (Eros), the god of love, was the son of Venus. He was her
 constant companion; and, armed with bow and arrows, he shot the
 darts of desire into the bosoms of both gods and men. There was a
 deity named Anteros, who was sometimes represented as the avenger of
 slighted love, and sometimes as the symbol of reciprocal affection.
 The following legend is told of him:
 </p>
 <p>Venus, complaining to Themis that her son Eros continued always a
 child, was told by her that it was because he was solitary, and that
 if he had a brother he would grow apace. Anteros was soon afterwards
 born, and Eros immediately was seen to increase rapidly in size and
 strength.
 </p>
 <p>Minerva (Pallas, Athene, the goddess of wisdom,) was the offspring
 of Jupiter, without a mother. She sprang forth from his head
 completely armed. Her favourite bird was the owl, and the plant sacred
 to her the olive.
 </p>
 <p>Byron, in "Childe Harold," alludes to the birth of Minerva thus:
 
 </p>
          "Can tyrants but by tyrants conquered be,<br>
           And Freedom find no champion and no child,<br>
           Such as Columbia saw arise, when she<br>
           Sprang forth a Pallas, armed and undefiled?<br>
           Or must such minds be nourished in the wild,<br>
           Deep in the unpruned forest, 'midst the roar<br>
           Of cataracts, where nursing Nature smiled<br>
           On infant Washington? Has earth no more<br>
           Such seeds within her breast, or Europe no such shore?"<br>
 
 <p>Mercury (Hermes) was the son of Jupiter and Maia. He presided over
 commerce, wrestling, and other gymnastic exercises, even over
 thieving, and everything, in short, which required skill and
 dexterity. He was the messenger of Jupiter, and wore a winged cap
 and winged shoes. He bore in his hand a rod entwined with two
 serpents, called the caduceus.
 </p>
 <p>Mercury is said to have invented the lyre. He found, one day, a
 tortoise, of which he took the shell, made holes in the opposite edges
 of it, and drew cords of linen through them, and the instrument was
 complete. The cords were nine, in honour of the nine Muses. Mercury
 gave the lyre to Apollo, and received from him in exchange the
 caduceus.*
 
 </p>
 <p>* From this origin of the instrument, the word "shell" is often used
 as synonymous with "lyre," and figuratively for music and poetry. Thus
 Gray, in his ode on the "Progress of Poesy," says:
 
 </p>
             "O Sovereign of the willing Soul,<br>
              Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs,<br>
              Enchanting shell! the sullen Cares<br>
              And frantic Passions hear thy soft control."<br>
 
 <p>Ceres (Demeter) was the daughter of Saturn and Rhea. She had a
 daughter named Proserpine (Persephone), who became the wife of
 Pluto, and queen of the realms of the dead. Ceres presided over
 agriculture.
 </p>
 <p>Bacchus (Dionysus), the god of wine, was the son of Jupiter and
 Semele. He represents not only the intoxicating power of wine, but its
 social and beneficent influences likewise, so that he is viewed as the
 promoter of civilization, and a lawgiver and lover of peace.
 </p>
 <p>The Muses were the daughters of Jupiter and Mnemosyne (Memory). They
 presided over song, and prompted the memory. They were nine in number,
 to each of whom was assigned the presidence over some particular
 department of literature, art, or science. Calliope was the muse of
 epic poetry, Clio of history, Euterpe of lyric poetry, Melpomene of
 tragedy, Terpsichore of choral dance and song, Erato of love poetry,
 Polyhymnia of sacred poetry, Urania of astronomy, Thalia of comedy.
 </p>
 <p>The Graces were goddesses presiding over the banquet, the dance, and
 all social enjoyments and elegant arts. They were three in number.
 Their names were Euphrosyne, Aglaia, and Thalia.
 </p>
 <p>Spenser describes the office of the Graces thus:
 
 </p>
           "These three on men all gracious gifts bestow<br>
            Which deck the body or adorn the mind,<br>
            To make them lovely or well-favoured show;<br>
            As comely carriage, entertainment kind,<br>
            Sweet semblance, friendly offices that bind,<br>
            And all the complements of courtesy;<br>
            They teach us how to each degree and kind<br>
            We should ourselves demean, to low, to high,<br>
            To friends, to foes; which skill men call Civility."<br>
 
 <p>The Fates were also three- Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. Their
 office was to spin the thread of human destiny, and they were armed
 with shears, with which they cut it off when they pleased. They were
 the daughters of Themis (Law), who sits by Jove on his throne to
 give him counsel.
 </p>
 <p>The Erinnyes, or Furies, were three goddesses who punished by
 their secret stings the crimes of those who escaped or defied public
 justice. The heads of the Furies were wreathed with serpents, and
 their whole appearance was terrific and appalling. Their names were
 Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera. They were also called Eumenides.
 </p>
 <p>Nemesis was also an avenging goddess. She represents the righteous
 anger of the gods, particularly towards the proud and insolent.
 </p>
 <p>Pan was the god of flocks and shepherds. His favourite residence was
 in Arcadia.
 </p>
 <p>The Satyrs were deities of the woods and fields. They were conceived
 to be covered with bristly hair, their heads decorated with short,
 sprouting horns, and their feet like goats' feet.
 </p>
 <p>Momus was the god of laughter, and Plutus the god of wealth.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ROMAN DIVINITIES.</h3>
 
 
 <p>The preceding are Grecian divinities, though received also by the
 Romans. Those which follow are peculiar to Roman mythology:
 </p>
 <p>Saturn was an ancient Italian deity. It was attempted to identify
 him with the Grecian god Cronos, and fabled that after his
 dethronement by Jupiter he fled to Italy, where he reigned during what
 was called the Golden Age. In memory of his beneficent dominion, the
 feast of Saturnalia was held every year in the winter season. Then all
 public business was suspended, declarations of war and criminal
 executions were postponed, friends made presents to one another, and
 the slaves were indulged with great liberties. A feast was given
 them at which they sat at table, while their masters served them, to
 show the natural equality of men, and that all things belonged equally
 to all, in the reign of Saturn.
 </p>
 <p>Faunus,* the grandson of Saturn, was worshipped as the god of fields
 and shepherds, and also as a prophetic god. His name in the plural,
 Fauns, expressed a class of gamesome deities, like the Satyrs of the
 Greeks.
 
 </p>
 <p>* There was also a goddess called Fauna, or Bona Dea.
 
 </p>
 <p>Quirinus was a war god, said to be no other than Romulus, the
 founder of Rome, exalted after his death to a place among the gods.
 </p>
 <p>Bellona, a war goddess.
 </p>
 <p>Terminus, the god of landmarks. His statue was a rude stone or post,
 set in the ground to mark the boundaries of fields.
 </p>
 <p>Pales, the goddess presiding over cattle and pastures.
 </p>
 <p>Pomona presided over fruit trees.
 </p>
 <p>Flora, the goddess of flowers.
 </p>
 <p>Lucina, the goddess of childbirth.
 </p>
 <p>Vesta (the Hestia of the Greeks) was a deity presiding over the
 public and private hearth. A sacred fire, tended by six virgin
 priestesses called Vestals, flamed in her temple. As the safety of the
 city was held to be connected with its conservation, the neglect of
 the virgins, if they let it go out, was severely punished, and the
 fire was rekindled from the rays of the sun.
 </p>
 <p>Liber is the Latin name of Bacchus; and Mulciber of Vulcan.
 </p>
 <p>Janus was the porter of heaven. He opens the year, the first month
 being named after him. He is the guardian deity of gates, on which
 account he is commonly represented with two heads, because every
 door looks two ways. His temples at Rome were numerous. In war time
 the gates of the principal one were always open. In peace they were
 closed; but they were shut only once between the reign of Numa and
 that of Augustus.
 </p>
 <p>The Penates were the gods who were supposed to attend to the welfare
 and prosperity of the family. Their name is derived from Penus, the
 pantry, which was sacred to them. Every master of a family was the
 priest of the Penates of his own house.
 </p>
 <p>The Lares, or Lars, were also household gods, but differed from
 the Penates in being regarded as the deified spirits of mortals. The
 family Lars were held to be the souls of the ancestors, who watched
 over and protected their descendants. The words Lemur and Larva more
 nearly correspond to our word Ghost.
 </p>
 <p>The Romans believed that every man had his Genius, and every woman
 her Juno: that is, a spirit who had given them being, and was regarded
 as their protector through life. On their birthdays men made offerings
 to their Genius, women to their Juno.
 </p>
 <p>A modern poet thus alludes to some of the Roman gods:
 
 </p>
              "Pomona loves the orchard,<br>
                 And Liber loves the vine,<br>
               And Pales loves the straw-built shed;<br>
                 Warm with the breath of kine;<br>
               And Venus loves the whisper<br>
                 Of plighted youth and maid,<br>
               In April's ivory moonlight,<br>
                 Beneath the chestnut shade."<br>
                                      Macaulay, "Prophecy of Capys."<br>
 
 <p>N.B.- It is to be observed that in proper names the final e and es
 are to be sounded. Thus Cybele and Penates are words of three
 syllables. But Proserpine and Thebes are exceptions and to be
 pronounced as English words.
