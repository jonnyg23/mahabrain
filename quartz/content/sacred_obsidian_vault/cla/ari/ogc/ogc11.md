   <h3 align="center">Book II</h3>  <h4 align="center">1</h4>  
 <p>WE have explained under what conditions combination, contact, and action-passion are attributable to the things which undergo natural change. Further, we have discussed unqualified coming-to-be and passing-away, and explained under what conditions they are predicable, of what subject, and owing to what cause. Similarly, we have also discussed alteration, and explained what altering is and how it differs from coming-to-be and passing-away. But we have still to investigate the so-called elements of bodies.</p>  
 <p>For the complex substances whose formation and maintenance are due to natural processes all presuppose the perceptible bodies as the condition of their coming-to-be and passing-away: but philosophers disagree in regard to the matter which underlies these perceptible bodies. Some maintain it is single, supposing it to be, e.g. Air or Fire, or an intermediate between these two (but still a body with a separate existence). Others, on the contrary, postulate two or more materials-ascribing to their association and dissociation, or to their alteration, the coming-to-be and passing-away of things. (Some, for instance, postulate Fire and Earth: some add Air, making three: and some, like Empedocles, reckon Water as well, thus postulating four.)</p>  
 <p>Now we may agree that the primary materials, whose change (whether it be association and dissociation or a process of another kind) results in coming-to-be and passing-away, are rightly described as originative sources, i.e. elements. But (i) those thinkers are in error who postulate, beside the bodies we have mentioned, a single matter-and that corporeal and separable matter. For this body of theirs cannot possibly exist without a perceptible contrariety: this Boundless, which some thinkers identify with the original real, must be either light or heavy, either cold or hot. And (ii) what Plato has written in the Timaeus is not based on any precisely-articulated conception. For he has not stated clearly whether his Omnirecipient exists in separation from the elements; nor does he make any use of it. He says, indeed, that it is a substratum prior to the so-called elements-underlying them, as gold underlies the things that are fashioned of gold. (And yet this comparison, if thus expressed, is itself open to criticism. Things which come-to-be and pass-away cannot be called by the name of the material out of which they have come-to-be: it is only the results of alteration which retain the name of the substratum whose alterations they are. However, he actually says that the truest account is to affirm that each of them is gold.) Nevertheless he carries his analysis of the elements--solids though they are--back to planes, and it is impossible for the Nurse (i.e. the primary matter) to be identical with the planes.</p>  
 <p>Our own doctrine is that although there is a matter of the perceptible bodies (a matter out of which the so-called elements come-to-be), it has no separate existence, but is always bound up with a contrariety. A more precise account of these presuppositions has been given in another work: we must, however, give a detailed explanation of the primary bodies as well, since they too are similarly derived from the matter. We must reckon as an originative source and as primary the matter which underlies, though it is inseparable from, the contrary qualities: for the hot is not matter for the cold nor the cold for the hot, but the substratum is matter for them both. We therefore have to recognize three originative sources: firstly that which potentially perceptible body, secondly the contrarieties (I mean, e.g. heat and cold), and thirdly Fire, Water, and the like. Only thirdly, however: for these bodies change into one another (they are not immutable as Empedocles and other thinkers assert, since alteration would then have been impossible), whereas the contrarieties do not change.</p>  
 <p>Nevertheless, even so the question remains: What sorts of contrarieties, and how many of them, are to be accounted originative sources of body? For all the other thinkers assume and use them without explaining why they are these or why they are just so many.</p>
