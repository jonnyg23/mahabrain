 hundred verses.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>

 Pausanias, ix. 5.10:
 Judging by Homer I do not believe that Oedipus had children by

 Epic called the "Story of Oedipus" clearly shows.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #3 --
 Scholiast on Euripides Phoen., 1750:
 The authors of the "Story of Oedipus" (say) of the Sphinx: `But

 seven thousand verses, which begins: `Sing, goddess, of parched
 Argos, whence lords...'
 </p><p>

 Fragment #2 --
 Athenaeus, xi. 465 E:
 `Then the heaven-born hero, golden-haired Polyneices, first set
 beside Oedipus a rich table of silver which once belonged to
 Cadmus the divinely wise: next he filled a fine golden cup with
 sweet wine.  But when Oedipus perceived these treasures of his
 father, great misery fell on his heart, and he straight-way
 called down bitter curses there in the presence of both his sons.
 </p><p>
 And the avenging Fury of the gods failed not to hear him as he
 prayed that they might never divide their father's goods in
 loving brotherhood, but that war and fighting might be ever the
 portion of them both.'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #3 --
 Laurentian Scholiast on Sophocles, O.C. 1375:
 `And when Oedipus noticed the haunch (1) he threw it on the
 ground and said: "Oh!  Oh!  my sons have sent this mocking me..."
 </p><p>
 So he prayed to Zeus the king and the other deathless gods that
 each might fall by his brother's hand and go down into the house
 of Hades.'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #4 --
 Pausanias, viii. 25.8:
 Adrastus fled from Thebes `wearing miserable garments, and took
 black-maned Areion (2) with him.'
 </p><p>

 Fragment #5 --
 Pindar, Ol. vi. 15: (3)
 `But when the seven dead had received their last rites in Thebes,
 the Son of Talaus lamented and spoke thus among them: "Woe is me,
 for I miss the bright eye of my host, a good seer and a stout
 spearman alike."'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #6 --

 the "Thebais" says that when Olenus had been stormed, Oeneus
 received her as a prize.

 </p><p>
 Fragment #7 --
 Pausanias, ix. 18.6:
 Near the spring is the tomb of Asphodicus.  This Asphodicus
 killed Parthenopaeus the son of Talaus in the battle against the
 Argives, as the Thebans say; though that part of the "Thebais"
 which tells of the death of Parthenopaeus says that it was
 Periclymenus who killed him.

 (3)  Restored from Pindar Ol. vi. 15 who, according to
      Asclepiades, derives the passage from the "Thebais".<br>

 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE EPIGONI (fragments)</h3>
 <p>
 Fragment #1 --
 Contest of Homer and Hesiod:
 Next (Homer composed) the "Epigoni" in seven thousand verses,
 beginning, `And now, Muses, let us begin to sing of younger men.'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #2 --
 Photius, Lexicon:
 Teumesia.  Those who have written on Theban affairs have given a
 full account of the Teumesian fox. (1)  They relate that the
 creature was sent by the gods to punish the descendants of
 Cadmus, and that the Thebans therefore excluded those of the
 house of Cadmus from kingship.  But (they say) a certain
 Cephalus, the son of Deion, an Athenian, who owned a hound which
 no beast ever escaped, had accidentally killed his wife Procris,
 and being purified of the homicide by the Cadmeans, hunted the
 fox with his hound, and when they had overtaken it both hound and
 fox were turned into stones near Teumessus.  These writers have
 taken the story from the Epic Cycle.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #3 --
 Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. i. 308:
 The authors of the "Thebais" say that Manto the daughter of
 Teiresias was sent to Delphi by the Epigoni as a first fruit of
 their spoil, and that in accordance with an oracle of Apollo she
 went out and met Rhacius, the son of Lebes, a Mycenaean by race. 
 This man she married -- for the oracle also contained the command
 that she should marry whomsoever she might meet -- and coming to
 Colophon, was there much cast down and wept over the destruction
 of her country.
