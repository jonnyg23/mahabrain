 <h2 align="CENTER">Homerica: The Battle of Frogs and Mice</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">translated by Hugh G. Evelyn-White</h3>
 <h4 align="CENTER">[1914]</h4>
 
 
 <p>
 (ll. 1-8) Here I begin: and first I pray the choir of the Muses
 to come down from Helicon into my heart to aid the lay which I
 have newly written in tablets upon my knee.  Fain would I sound
 in all men's ears that awful strife, that clamorous deed of war,
 and tell how the Mice proved their valour on the Frogs and
 rivalled the exploits of the Giants, those earth-born men, as the
 tale was told among mortals.  Thus did the war begin.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 9-12) One day a thirsty Mouse who had escaped the ferret,
 dangerous foe, set his soft muzzle to the lake's brink and
 revelled in the sweet water.  There a loud-voiced pond-larker
 spied him: and uttered such words as these.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 13-23) `Stranger, who are you?  Whence come you to this
 shore, and who is he who begot you?  Tell me all this truly and
 let me not find you lying.  For if I find you worthy to be my
 friend, I will take you to my house and give you many noble gifts
 such as men give to their guests.  I am the king Puff-jaw, and am
 honoured in all the pond, being ruler of the Frogs continually. 
 The father that brought me up was Mud-man who mated with
 Waterlady by the banks of Eridanus.  I see, indeed, that you are
 well-looking and stouter than the ordinary, a sceptred king and a
 warrior in fight; but, come, make haste and tell me your
 descent.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 24-55) Then Crumb-snatcher answered him and said: `Why do
 you ask my race, which is well-known amongst all, both men and
 gods and the birds of heaven?  Crumb-snatcher am I called, and I
 am the son of Bread-nibbler -- he was my stout-hearted father --
 and my mother was Quern-licker, the daughter of Ham-gnawer the
 king: she bare me in the mouse-hole and nourished me with food,
 figs and nuts and dainties of all kinds.  But how are you to make
 me your friend, who am altogether different in nature?  For you
 get your living in the water, but I am used to each such foods as
 men have: I never miss the thrice-kneaded loaf in its neat, round
 basket, or the thin-wrapped cake full of sesame and cheese, or
 the slice of ham, or liver vested in white fat, or cheese just
 curdled from sweet milk, or delicious honey-cake which even the
 blessed gods long for, or any of all those cates which cooks make
 for the feasts of mortal men, larding their pots and pans with
 spices of all kinds.  In battle I have never flinched from the
 cruel onset, but plunged straight into the fray and fought among
 the foremost.  I fear not man though he has a big body, but run
 along his bed and bite the tip of his toe and nibble at his heel;
 and the man feels no hurt and his sweet sleep is not broken by my
 biting.  But there are two things I fear above all else the whole
 world over, the hawk and the ferret -- for these bring great
 grief on me -- and the piteous trap wherein is treacherous death.
 </p><p>
 Most of all I fear the ferret of the keener sort which follows
 you still even when you dive down your hole. (1)  In gnaw no
 radishes and cabbages and pumpkins, nor feed on green leeks and
 parsley; for these are food for you who live in the lake.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 56-64) Then Puff-jaw answered him with a smile: `Stranger
 you boast too much of belly-matters: we too have many marvels to
 be seen both in the lake and on the shore.  For the Son of
 Chronos has given us Frogs the power to lead a double life,
 dwelling at will in two separate elements; and so we both leap on
 land and plunge beneath the water.  If you would learn of all
 these things, 'tis easy done: just mount upon my back and hold me
 tight lest you be lost, and so you shall come rejoicing to my
 house.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 65-81) So said he, and offered his back.  And the Mouse
 mounted at once, putting his paws upon the other's sleek neck and
 vaulting nimbly.  Now at first, while he still saw the land near
 by, he was pleased, and was delighted with Puff-jaw's swimming;
 but when dark waves began to wash over him, he wept loudly and
 blamed his unlucky change of mind: he tore his fur and tucked his
 paws in against his belly, while within him his heart quaked by
 reason of the strangeness: and he longed to get to land, groaning
 terribly through the stress of chilling fear.  He put out his
 tail upon the water and worked it like a steering oar, and prayed
 to heaven that he might get to land.  But when the dark waves
 washed over him he cried aloud and said: `Not in such wise did
 the bull bear on his back the beloved load, when be brought
 Europa across the sea to Crete, as this Frog carries me over the
 water to his house, raising his yellow back in the pale water.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 82-92) Then suddenly a water-snake appeared, a horrid sight
 for both alike, and held his neck upright above the water.  And
 when he saw it, Puff-jaw dived at once, and never thought how
 helpless a friend he would leave perishing; but down to the
 bottom of the lake he went, and escaped black death.  But the
 Mouse, so deserted, at once fell on his back, in the water.  He
 wrung his paws and squeaked in agony of death: many times he sank
 beneath the water and many times he rose up again kicking.  But
 he could not escape his doom, for his wet fur weighed him down
 heavily.  Then at the last, as he was dying, he uttered these
 words.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 93-98) `Ah, Puff-jaw, you shall not go unpunished for this
 treachery!  You threw me, a castaway, off your body as from a
 rock.  Vile coward!  On land you would not have been the better
 man, boxing, or wrestling, or running; but now you have tricked
 me and cast me in the water.  Heaven has an avenging eye, and
 surely the host of Mice will punish you and not let you escape.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 99-109) With these words he breathed out his soul upon the
 water.  But Lick-platter as he sat upon the soft bank saw him die
 and, raising a dreadful cry, ran and told the Mice.  And when
 they heard of his fate, all the Mice were seized with fierce
 anger, and bade their heralds summon the people to assemble
 towards dawn at the house of Bread-nibbler, the father of hapless
 Crumb-snatcher who lay outstretched on the water face up, a
 lifeless corpse, and no longer near the bank, poor wretch, but
 floating in the midst of the deep.  And when the Mice came in
 haste at dawn, Bread-nibbler stood up first, enraged at his son's
 death, and thus he spoke.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 110-121) `Friends, even if I alone had suffered great wrong
 from the Frogs, assuredly this is a first essay at mischief for
 you all.  And now I am pitiable, for I have lost three sons. 
 First the abhorred ferret seized and killed one of them, catching
 him outside the hole; then ruthless men dragged another to his
 doom when by unheard-of arts they had contrived a wooden snare, a
 destroyer of Mice, which they call a trap.  There was a third
 whom I and his dear mother loved well, and him Puff-jaw has
 carried out into the deep and drowned.  Come, then, and let us
 arm ourselves and go out against them when we have arrayed
 ourselves in rich-wrought arms.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 122-131) With such words he persuaded them all to gird
 themselves.  And Ares who has charge of war equipped them.  First
 they fastened on greaves and covered their shins with green bean-
 pods broken into two parts which they had gnawed out, standing
 over them all night.  Their breast plates were of skin stretched
 on reeds, skilfully made from a ferret they had flayed.  For
 shields each had the centre-piece of a lamp, and their spears
 were long needles all of bronze, the work of Ares, and the
 helmets upon their temples were pea-nut shells.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 132-138) So the Mice armed themselves.  But when the Frogs
 were aware of it, they rose up out of the water and coming
 together to one place gathered a council of grievous war.  And
 while they were asking whence the quarrel arose, and what the
 cause of this anger, a herald drew near bearing a wand in his
 paws, Pot-visitor the son of great-hearted Cheese-carver.  He
 brought the grim message of war, speaking thus:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 139-143) `Frogs, the Mice have sent me with their threats
 against you, and bid you arm yourselves for war and battle; for
 they have seen Crumb-snatcher in the water whom your king Puff-
 jaw slew.  Fight, then, as many of you as are warriors among the
 Frogs.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 144-146) With these words he explained the matter.  So when
 this blameless speech came to their ears, the proud Frogs were
 disturbed in their hearts and began to blame Puff-jaw.  But he
 rose up and said:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 147-159) `Friends, I killed no Mouse, nor did I see one
 perishing.  Surely he was drowned while playing by the lake and
 imitating the swimming of the Frogs, and now these wretches blame
 me who am guiltless.  Come then; let us take counsel how we may
 utterly destroy the wily Mice.  Moreover, I will tell you what I
 think to be the best.  Let us all gird on our armour and take our
 stand on the very brink of the lake, where the ground breaks down
 sheer: then when they come out and charge upon us, let each seize
 by the crest the Mouse who attacks him, and cast them with their
 helmets into the lake; for so we shall drown these dry-hobs (2)
 in the water, and merrily set up here a trophy of victory over
 the slaughtered Mice.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 160-167) By this speech he persuaded them to arm themselves.
 </p><p>
 They covered their shins with leaves of mallows, and had
 breastplates made of fine green beet-leaves, and cabbage-leaves,
 skilfully fashioned, for shields.  Each one was equipped with a
 long, pointed rush for a spear, and smooth snail-shells to cover
 their heads.  Then they stood in close-locked ranks upon the high
 bank, waving their spears, and were filled, each of them, with
 courage.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 168-173) Now Zeus called the gods to starry heaven and
 showed them the martial throng and the stout warriors so many and
 so great, all bearing long spears; for they were as the host of
 the Centaurs and the Giants.  Then he asked with a sly smile;
 `Who of the deathless gods will help the Frogs and who the Mice?'
 </p><p>
 And he said to Athena;
 </p><p>
 (ll. 174-176) `My daughter, will you go aid the Mice?  For they
 all frolic about your temple continually, delighting in the fat
 of sacrifice and in all kinds of food.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 177-196) So then said the son of Cronos.  But Athena
 answered him: `I would never go to help the Mice when they are
 hard pressed, for they have done me much mischief, spoiling my
 garlands and my lamps too, to get the oil.  And this thing that
 they have done vexes my heart exceedingly: they have eaten holes
 in my sacred robe, which I wove painfully spinning a fine woof on
 a fine warp, and made it full of holes.  And now the money-lender
 is at me and charges me interest which is a bitter thing for
 immortals.  For I borrowed to do my weaving, and have nothing
 with which to repay.  Yet even so I will not help the Frogs; for
 they also are not considerable: once, when I was returning early
 from war, I was very tired, and though I wanted to sleep, they
 would not let me even doze a little for their outcry; and so I
 lay sleepless with a headache until cock-crow.  No, gods, let us
 refrain from helping these hosts, or one of us may get wounded
 with a sharp spear; for they fight hand to hand, even if a god
 comes against them.  Let us rather all amuse ourselves watching
 the fight from heaven.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 197-198) So said Athena.  And the other gods agreed with
 her, and all went in a body to one place.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 199-201) Then gnats with great trumpets sounded the fell
 note of war, and Zeus the son of Cronos thundered from heaven, a
 sign of grievous battle.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 202-223) First Loud-croaker wounded Lickman in the belly,
 right through the midriff.  Down fell he on his face and soiled
 his soft fur in the dust: he fell with a thud and his armour
 clashed about him.  Next Troglodyte shot at the son of Mudman,
 and drove the strong spear deep into his breast; so he fell, and
 black death seized him and his spirit flitted forth from his
 mouth.  Then Beety struck Pot-visitor to the heart and killed
 him, and Bread-nibbler hit Loud-crier in the belly, so that he
 fell on his face and his spirit flitted forth from his limbs. 
 Now when Pond-larker saw Loud-crier perishing, he struck in
 quickly and wounded Troglodyte in his soft neck with a rock like
 a mill-stone, so that darkness veiled his eyes.  Thereat Ocimides
 was seized with grief, and struck out with his sharp reed and did
 not draw his spear back to him again, but felled his enemy there
 and then.  And Lickman shot at him with a bright spear and hit
 him unerringly in the midriff.  And as he marked Cabbage-eater
 running away, he fell on the steep bank, yet even so did not
 cease fighting but smote that other so that he fell and did not
 rise again; and the lake was dyed with red blood as he lay
 outstretched along the shore, pierced through the guts and
 shining flanks.  Also he slew Cheese-eater on the very brink....
 </p><p>
 ((LACUNA))
 </p><p>
 (ll. 224-251) But Reedy took to flight when he saw Ham-nibbler,
 and fled, plunging into the lake and throwing away his shield. 
 Then blameless Pot-visitor killed Brewer and Water-larked killed
 the lord Ham-nibbler, striking him on the head with a pebble, so
 that his brains flowed out at his nostrils and the earth was
 bespattered with blood.  Faultless Muck-coucher sprang upon Lick-
 platter and killed him with his spear and brought darkness upon
 his eyes: and Leeky saw it, and dragged Lick-platter by the foot,
 though he was dead, and choked him in the lake.  But Crumb-
 snatcher was fighting to avenge his dead comrades, and hit Leeky
 before he reached the land; and he fell forward at the blow and
 his soul went down to Hades.  And seeing this, the Cabbage-
 climber took a clod of mud and hurled it at the Mouse, plastering
 all his forehead and nearly blinding him.  Thereat Crumb-snatcher
 was enraged and caught up in his strong hand a huge stone that
 lay upon the ground, a heavy burden for the soil: with that he
 hit Cabbage-climber below the knee and splintered his whole right
 shin, hurling him on his back in the dust.  But Croakperson kept
 him off, and rushing at the Mouse in turn, hit him in the middle
 of the belly and drove the whole reed-spear into him, and as he
 drew the spear back to him with his strong hand, all his foe's
 bowels gushed out upon the ground.  And when Troglodyte saw the
 deed, as he was limping away from the fight on the river bank, he
 shrank back sorely moved, and leaped into a trench to escape
 sheer death.  Then Bread-nibbler hit Puff-jaw on the toes -- he
 came up at the last from the lake and was greatly distressed....
 </p><p>
 ((LACUNA))
 </p><p>
 (ll. 252-259) And when Leeky saw him fallen forward, but still
 half alive, he pressed through those who fought in front and
 hurled a sharp reed at him; but the point of the spear was stayed
 and did not break his shield.  Then noble Rueful, like Ares
 himself, struck his flawless head-piece made of four pots -- he
 only among the Frogs showed prowess in the throng.  But when he
 saw the other rush at him, he did not stay to meet the stout-
 hearted hero but dived down to the depths of the lake.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 260-271) Now there was one among the Mice, Slice-snatcher,
 who excelled the rest, dear son of Gnawer the son of blameless
 Bread-stealer.  He went to his house and bade his son take part
 in the war.  This warrior threatened to destroy the race of Frogs
 utterly (3), and splitting a chestnut-husk into two parts along
 the joint, put the two hollow pieces as armour on his paws: then
 straightway the Frogs were dismayed and all rushed down to the
 lake, and he would have made good his boast -- for he had great
 strength -- had not the Son of Cronos, the Father of men and
 gods, been quick to mark the thing and pitied the Frogs as they
 were perishing.  He shook his head, and uttered this word:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 272-276) `Dear, dear, how fearful a deed do my eyes behold! 
 Slice-snatcher makes no small panic rushing to and fro among the
 Frogs by the lake.  Let us then make all haste and send warlike
 Pallas or even Ares, for they will stop his fighting, strong
 though he is.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 277-284) So said the Son of Cronos; but Hera answered him:
 `Son of Cronos, neither the might of Athena nor of Ares can avail
 to deliver the Frogs from utter destruction.  Rather, come and
 let us all go to help them, or else let loose your weapon, the
 great and formidable Titan-killer with which you killed Capaneus,
 that doughty man, and great Enceladus and the wild tribes of
 Giants; ay, let it loose, for so the most valiant will be slain.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 285-293) So said Hera: and the Son of Cronos cast a lurid
 thunderbolt: first he thundered and made great Olympus shake, and
 the cast the thunderbolt, the awful weapon of Zeus, tossing it
 lightly forth.  Thus he frightened them all, Frogs and Mice
 alike, hurling his bolt upon them.  Yet even so the army of the
 Mice did not relax, but hoped still more to destroy the brood of
 warrior Frogs.  Only, the Son of Cronos, on Olympus, pitied the
 Frogs and then straightway sent them helpers.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 294-303) So there came suddenly warriors with mailed backs
 and curving claws, crooked beasts that walked sideways, nut-
 cracker-jawed, shell-hided: bony they were, flat-backed, with
 glistening shoulders and bandy legs and stretching arms and eyes
 that looked behind them.  They had also eight legs and two
 feelers -- persistent creatures who are called crabs.  These
 nipped off the tails and paws and feet of the Mice with their
 jaws, while spears only beat on them.  Of these the Mice were all
 afraid and no longer stood up to them, but turned and fled. 
 Already the sun was set, and so came the end of the one-day war.
