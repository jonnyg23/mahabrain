 <h3 align="CENTER">THE RETURNS</h3>
 <p>
 Fragment #1 --<br>
 Proclus, Chrestomathia, ii:<br>
 After the "Sack of Ilium" follow the "Returns" in five books by
 Agias of Troezen.  Their contents are as follows.  Athena causes
 a quarrel between Agamemnon and Menelaus about the voyage from
 Troy.  Agamemnon then stays on to appease the anger of Athena. 
 Diomedes and Nestor put out to sea and get safely home.  After
 them Menelaus sets out and reaches Egypt with five ships, the
 rest having been destroyed on the high seas.  Those with Calchas,
 Leontes, and Polypoetes go by land to Colophon and bury Teiresias
 who died there.  When Agamemnon and his followers were sailing
 away, the ghost of Achilles appeared and tried to prevent them by
 foretelling what should befall them.  The storm at the rocks
 called Capherides is then described, with the end of Locrian
 Aias.  Neoptolemus, warned by Thetis, journeys overland and,
 coming into Thrace, meets Odysseus at Maronea, and then finishes
 the rest of his journey after burying Phoenix who dies on the
 way.  He himself is recognized by Peleus on reaching the Molossi.
 </p><p>
 Then comes the murder of Agamemnon by Aegisthus and
 Clytaemnestra, followed by the vengeance of Orestes and Pylades. 
 Finally, Menelaus returns home.

 Fragment #2 --<br>
 Argument to Euripides Medea:<br>
 `Forthwith Medea made Aeson a sweet young boy and stripped his
 old age from him by her cunning skill, when she had made a brew
 of many herbs in her golden cauldrons.'
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #3 --<br>
 Pausanias, i. 2:<br>
 The story goes that Heracles was besieging Themiscyra on the
 Thermodon and could not take it; but Antiope, being in love with
 Theseus who was with Heracles on this expedition, betrayed the
 place.  Hegias gives this account in his poem.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #4 --<br>
 Eustathius, 1796. 45:<br>
 The Colophonian author of the "Returns" says that Telemachus
 afterwards married Circe, while Telegonus the son of Circe
 correspondingly married Penelope.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #5 --<br>
 Clement of Alex. Strom., vi. 2. 12. 8:<br>
 `For gifts beguile men's minds and their deeds as well.' (1)
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #6 --<br>
 Pausanias, x. 28. 7:<br>
 The poetry of Homer and the "Returns" -- for here too there is an
 account of Hades and the terrors there -- know of no spirit named
 Eurynomus.
 </p><p>
 Athenaeus, 281 B:<br>
 The writer of the "Return of the Atreidae" (2) says that Tantalus
 came and lived with the gods, and was permitted to ask for
 whatever he desired.  But the man was so immoderately given to
 pleasures that he asked for these and for a life like that of the
 gods.  At this Zeus was annoyed, but fulfilled his prayer because
 of his own promise; but to prevent him from enjoying any of the
 pleasures provided, and to keep him continually harassed, he hung
 a stone over his head which prevents him from ever reaching any
 of the pleasant things near by.

 <p>
 (1)  Clement attributes this line to Augias: probably Agias is
      intended.
 (2)  Identical with the "Returns", in which the Sons of Atreus
      occupy the most prominent parts.

 <p>
 Fragment #1 --<br>
 Proclus, Chrestomathia, ii:<br>
 After the "Returns" comes the "Odyssey" of Homer, and then the
 "Telegony" in two books by Eugammon of Cyrene, which contain the
 following matters.  The suitors of Penelope are buried by their
 kinsmen, and Odysseus, after sacrificing to the Nymphs, sails to
 Elis to inspect his herds.  He is entertained there by Polyxenus
 and receives a mixing bowl as a gift; the story of Trophonius and
 Agamedes and Augeas then follows.  He next sails back to Ithaca
 and performs the sacrifices ordered by Teiresias, and then goes
 to Thesprotis where he marries Callidice, queen of the
 Thesprotians.  A war then breaks out between the Thesprotians,
 led by Odysseus, and the Brygi.  Ares routs the army of Odysseus
 and Athena engages with Ares, until Apollo separates them.  After
 the death of Callidice Polypoetes, the son of Odysseus, succeeds
 to the kingdom, while Odysseus himself returns to Ithaca.  In the
 meantime Telegonus, while travelling in search of his father,
 lands on Ithaca and ravages the island: Odysseus comes out to
 defend his country, but is killed by his son unwittingly. 
 Telegonus, on learning his mistake, transports his father's body
 with Penelope and Telemachus to his mother's island, where Circe
 makes them immortal, and Telegonus marries Penelope, and
 Telemachus Circe.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 Fragment #2 --<br>
 Eustathias, 1796. 35:<br>
 The author of the "Telegony", a Cyrenaean, relates that Odysseus
 had by Calypso a son Telegonus or Teledamus, and by Penelope
 Telemachus and Acusilaus.
