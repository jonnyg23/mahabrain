 <p>7. We are thus brought back to the nature of that underlying
 matter and the things believed to be based upon it; 
 investigation will
 show us that Matter has no reality and is not capable of being
 affected.
 
 </p><p>Matter must be bodiless- for body is a later production, a
 compound made by Matter in conjunction with some other 
 entity. Thus it
 is included among incorporeal things in the sense that body is
 something that is neither Real-Being nor Matter.
 
 </p><p>Matter is no Soul; it is not Intellect, is not Life, is no
 Ideal-Principle, no Reason-Principle; it is no limit or bound, for
 it is mere indetermination; it is not a power, for what does it
 produce?
 
 </p><p>It lives on the farther side of all these categories and 
 so has no
 tide to the name of Being. It will be more plausibly called a
 non-being, and this in the sense not of movement [away from Being]
 or station (in Not-Being) but of veritable Not-Being, so 
 that it is no
 more than the image and phantasm of Mass, a bare aspiration towards
 substantial existence; it is stationary but not in the sense 
 of having
 position, it is in itself invisible, eluding all effort to 
 observe it,
 present where no one can look, unseen for all our gazing,
 ceaselessly presenting contraries in the things based upon it; it is
 large and small, more and less, deficient and excessive; a phantasm
 unabiding and yet unable to withdraw- not even strong enough to
 withdraw, so utterly has it failed to accept strength from the
 Intellectual Principle, so absolute its lack of all Being.
 
 </p><p>Its every utterance, therefore, is a lie; it pretends to be
 great and it is little, to be more and it is less; and the Existence
 with which it masks itself is no Existence, but a passing 
 trick making
 trickery of all that seems to be present in it, phantasms within a
 phantasm; it is like a mirror showing things as in itself when they
 are really elsewhere, filled in appearance but actually empty,
 containing nothing, pretending everything. Into it and out of it
 move mimicries of the Authentic Existents, images playing upon an
 image devoid of Form, visible against it by its very formlessness;
 they seem to modify it but in reality effect nothing, for they are
 ghostly and feeble, have no thrust and meet none in Matter either;
 they pass through it leaving no cleavage, as through water; or they
 might be compared to shapes projected so as to make some appearance
 upon what we can know only as the Void.
 
 </p><p>Further: if visible objects were of the rank of the 
 originals from
 which they have entered into Matter we might believe Matter to be
 really affected by them, for we might credit them with some share of
 the power inherent in their Senders: but the objects of our
 experiences are of very different virtue than the realities they
 represent, and we deduce that the seeming modification of matter by
 visible things is unreal since the visible thing itself is unreal,
 having at no point any similarity with its source and cause. Feeble,
 in itself, a false thing and projected upon a falsity, like an image
 in dream or against water or on a mirror, it can but leave Matter
 unaffected; and even this is saying too little, for water and mirror
 do give back a faithful image of what presents itself before them.
