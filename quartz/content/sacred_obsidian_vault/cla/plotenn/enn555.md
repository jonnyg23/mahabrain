 <p>18. To pass to the consideration of beauty:
 
 </p><p>If by beauty we mean the primary Beauty, the same or similar
 arguments will apply here as to goodness: and if the beauty in the
 Ideal-Form is, as it were, an effulgence [from that primary Beauty],
 we may observe that it is not identical in all participants and that
 an effulgence is necessarily a posterior.
 
 </p><p>If we mean the beauty which identifies itself with 
 Substance, this
 has been covered in our treatment of Substance.
 
 </p><p>If, again, we mean beauty in relation to ourselves as spectators
 in whom it produces a certain experience, this Act [of production]
 is Motion- and none the less Motion by being directed 
 towards Absolute
 Beauty.
 
 </p><p>Knowledge again, is Motion originating in the self; it is the
 observation of Being- an Act, not a State: hence it too falls under
 Motion, or perhaps more suitably under Stability, or even under
 both; if under both, knowledge must be thought of as a 
 complex, and if
 a complex, is posterior.
 
 </p><p>Intelligence, since it connotes intelligent Being and comprises
 the total of existence, cannot be one of the genera: the true
 Intelligence [or Intellect] is Being taken with all its concomitants
 [with the other four genera]; it is actually the sum of all the
 Existents: Being on the contrary, stripped of its 
 concomitants, may be
 counted as a genus and held to an element in Intelligence.
 
 </p><p>Justice and self-control [sophrosyne], and virtue in general-
 these are all various Acts of Intelligence: they are consequently
 not primary genera; they are posterior to a genus, that is to say,
 they are species.
