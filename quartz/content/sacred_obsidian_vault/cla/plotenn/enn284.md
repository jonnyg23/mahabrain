 <p>1. In our attempt to elucidate the Essence of the soul, 
 we show it
 to be neither a material fabric nor, among immaterial things, a
 harmony. The theory that it is some final development, some
 entelechy, we pass by, holding this to be neither true as presented
 nor practically definitive.
 
 </p><p>No doubt we make a very positive statement about it when we
 declare it to belong to the Intellectual Kind, to be of the divine
 order; but a deeper penetration of its nature is demanded.
 
 </p><p>In that allocation we were distinguishing things as they fall
 under the Intellectual or the sensible, and we placed the soul in
 the former class; now, taking its membership of the Intellectual for
 granted, we must investigate by another path the more specific
 characteristics of its nature.
 
 </p><p>There are, we hold, things primarily apt to partition, tending
 by sheer nature towards separate existence: they are things in which
 no part is identical either with another part or with the whole,
 while, also their part is necessarily less than the total and whole:
 these are magnitudes of the realm of sense, masses, each of which
 has a station of its own so that none can be identically present in
 entirety at more than one point at one time.
 
 </p><p>But to that order is opposed Essence [Real-Being]; this is in no
 degree susceptible of partition; it is unparted and impartible;
 interval is foreign to it, cannot enter into our idea of it: 
 it has no
 need of place and is not, in diffusion or as an entirety, situated
 within any other being: it is poised over all beings at 
 once, and this
 is not in the sense of using them as a base but in their 
 being neither
 capable nor desirous of existing independently of it; it is 
 an essence
 eternally unvaried: it is common to all that follows upon it: it is
 like the circle's centre to which all the radii are attached while
 leaving it unbrokenly in possession of itself, the starting point of
 their course and of their essential being, the ground in which they
 all participate: thus the indivisible is the principle of these
 divided existences and in their very outgoing they remain enduringly
 in contact with that stationary essence.
 
 </p><p>So far we have the primarily indivisible- supreme among the
 Intellectual and Authentically Existent- and we have its 
 contrary, the
 Kind definitely divisible in things of sense; but there is also
 another Kind, of earlier rank than the sensible yet near to it and
 resident within it- an order, not, like body, primarily a thing of
 part, but becoming so upon incorporation. The bodies are 
 separate, and
 the ideal form which enters them is correspondingly sundered while,
 still, it is present as one whole in each of its severed parts,
 since amid that multiplicity in which complete individuality has
 entailed complete partition, there is a permanent identity; we may
 think of colour, qualities of all kinds, some particular shape,
 which can be present in many unrelated objects at the one 
 moment, each
 entire and yet with no community of experience among the various
 manifestations. In the case of such ideal-forms we may 
 affirm complete
 partibility.
 
 </p><p>But, on the other hand, that first utterly indivisible Kind must
 be accompanied by a subsequent Essence, engendered by it and holding
 indivisibility from it but, in virtue of the necessary outgo from
 source, tending firmly towards the contrary, the wholly 
 partible; this
 secondary Essence will take an intermediate Place between the first
 substance, the undivided, and that which is divisible in material
 things and resides in them. Its presence, however, will differ in
 one respect from that of colour and quantity; these, no doubt, are
 present identically and entire throughout diverse material 
 masses, but
 each several manifestation of them is as distinct from every other
 as the mass is from the mass.
 
 </p><p>The magnitude present in any mass is definitely one 
 thing, yet its
 identity from part to part does not imply any such community as
 would entail common experience; within that identity there is
 diversity, for it is a condition only, not the actual Essence.
 
 </p><p>The Essence, very near to the impartible, which we assert to
 belong to the Kind we are now dealing with, is at once an Essence
 and an entrant into body; upon embodiment, it experiences a
 partition unknown before it thus bestowed itself.
 
 </p><p>In whatsoever bodies it occupies- even the vastest of 
 all, that in
 which the entire universe is included- it gives itself to the whole
 without abdicating its unity.
 
 </p><p>This unity of an Essence is not like that of body, which 
 is a unit
 by the mode of continuous extension, the mode of distinct parts each
 occupying its own space. Nor is it such a unity as we have dealt
 with in the case of quality.
 
 </p><p>The nature, at once divisible and indivisible, which we affirm
 to be soul has not the unity of an extended thing: it does 
 not consist
 of separate sections; its divisibility lies in its presence at every
 point of the recipient, but it is indivisible as dwelling entire in
 the total and entire in any part.
 
 </p><p>To have penetrated this idea is to know the greatness of the
 soul and its power, the divinity and wonder of its being, as a
 nature transcending the sphere of Things.
 
 </p><p>Itself devoid of mass, it is present to all mass: it exists here
 and yet is There, and this not in distinct phases but with
 unsundered identity: thus it is "parted and not parted," or, better,
 it has never known partition, never become a parted thing, 
 but remains
 a self-gathered integral, and is "parted among bodies" merely in the
 sense that bodies, in virtue of their own sundered existence, cannot
 receive it unless in some partitive mode; the partition, in other
 words, is an occurrence in body not in soul.
