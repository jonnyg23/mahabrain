 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 5</h4>
 
 <p>5. Often for the purpose of exposition- as a help towards
 stating the nature of the produced multiplicity- we use the 
 example of
 many lines radiating from one centre; but, while we provide for
 individualization, we must carefully preserve mutual 
 presence. Even in
 the case of our circle we need not think of separated radii; all may
 be taken as forming one surface: where there is no distinction even
 upon the one surface but all is power and reality undifferentiated,
 all the beings may be thought of as centres uniting at one central
 centre: we ignore the radial lines and think of their terminals at
 that centre, where they are at one. Restore the radii; once more we
 have lines, each touching a generating centre of its own, but that
 centre remains coincident with the one first centre; the centres all
 unite in that first centre and yet remain what they were, so 
 that they
 are as many as are the lines to which they serve as terminals; the
 centres themselves appear as numerous as the lines starting from gem
 and yet all those centres constitute a unity.
 
 </p><p>Thus we may liken the Intellectual Beings in their diversity to
 many centres coinciding with the one centre and themselves at one in
 it but appearing multiple on account of the radial lines- lines
 which do not generate the centres but merely lead to them. The
 radii, thus, afford a serviceable illustration for the mode 
 of contact
 by which the Intellectual Unity manifests itself as multiple and
 multipresent.
