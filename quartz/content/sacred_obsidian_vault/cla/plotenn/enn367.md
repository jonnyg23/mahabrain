 <p>2. If sight depends upon the linking of the light of vision with
 the light leading progressively to the illumined object, then, by
 the very hypothesis, one intervening substance, the light, is
 indispensable: but if the illuminated body, which is the object of
 vision, serves as an agent operating certain changes, some 
 such change
 might very well impinge immediately upon the eye, requiring 
 no medium;
 this all the more, since as things are the intervening substance,
 which actually does exist, is in some degree changed at the point of
 contact with the eye [and so cannot be in itself a requisite to
 vision].
 
 </p><p>Those who have made vision a forth-going act [and not an 
 in-coming
 from the object] need not postulate an intervening substance-
 unless, indeed, to provide against the ray from the eye 
 failing on its
 path- but this is a ray of light and light flies straight. Those who
 make vision depend upon resistance are obliged to postulate an
 intervening substance.
 
 </p><p>The champions of the image, with its transit through a void, are
 seeking the way of least resistance; but since the entire absence of
 intervenient gives a still easier path they will not oppose that
 hypothesis.
 
 </p><p>So, too, those that explain vision by sympathy must 
 recognize that
 an intervening substance will be a hindrance as tending to check or
 block or enfeeble that sympathy; this theory, especially, 
 requires the
 admission that any intervenient, and particularly one of kindred
 nature, must blunt the perception by itself absorbing part of the
 activity. Apply fire to a body continuous through and through, and
 no doubt the core will be less affected than the surface: 
 but where we
 are dealing with the sympathetic parts of one living being, 
 there will
 scarcely be less sensation because of the intervening substance, or,
 if there should be, the degree of sensation will still be
 proportionate to the nature of the separate part, with the
 intervenient acting merely as a certain limitation; this, 
 though, will
 not be the case where the element introduced is of a kind to
 overleap the bridge.
 
 </p><p>But this is saying that the sympathetic quality of the universe
 depends upon its being one living thing, and that our amenability to
 experience depends upon our belonging integrally to that unity;
 would it not follow that continuity is a condition of any perception
 of a remote object?
 
 </p><p>The explanation is that continuity and its concomitant, the
 bridging substance, come into play because a living being must be a
 continuous thing, but that, none the less, the receiving of 
 impression
 is not an essentially necessary result of continuity; if it were,
 everything would receive such impression from everything else, and
 if thing is affected by thing in various separate orders, 
 there can be
 no further question of any universal need of intervening substance.
 
 </p><p>Why it should be especially requisite in the act of seeing would
 have to be explained: in general, an object passing through the air
 does not affect it beyond dividing it; when a stone falls, the air
 simply yields; nor is it reasonable to explain the natural direction
 of movement by resistance; to do so would bring us to the absurdity
 that resistance accounts for the upward movement of fire, 
 which on the
 contrary, overcomes the resistance of the air by its own essentially
 quick energy. If we are told that the resistance is brought more
 swiftly into play by the very swiftness of the ascending body, that
 would be a mere accidental circumstance, not a cause of the upward
 motion: in trees the upthrust from the root depends on no such
 external propulsion; we, too, in our movements cleave the air and
 are in no wise forwarded by its resistance; it simply flows in from
 behind to fill the void we make.
 
 </p><p>If the severance of the air by such bodies leaves it unaffected,
 why must there be any severance before the images of sight can reach
 us?
 
 </p><p>And, further, once we reject the theory that these 
 images reach us
 by way of some outstreaming from the objects seen, there is no
 reason to think of the air being affected and passing on to us, in a
 progression of impression, what has been impressed upon itself.
 
 </p><p>If our perception is to depend upon previous impressions 
 made upon
 the air, then we have no direct knowledge of the object of 
 vision, but
 know it only as through an intermediary, in the same way as we are
 aware of warmth where it is not the distant fire itself that 
 warms us,
 but the warmed intervening air. That is a matter of contact; 
 but sight
 is not produced by contact: the application of an object to the eye
 would not produce sight; what is required is the illumination of the
 intervening medium; for the air in itself is a dark substance: If it
 were not for this dark substance there would probably be no 
 reason for
 the existence of light: the dark intervening matter is a barrier,
 and vision requires that it be overcome by light. Perhaps also the
 reason why an object brought close to the eye cannot be seen is that
 it confronts us with a double obscuration, its own and that of the
 air.
