 <p>6. But that this same Mars, or Aphrodite, in certain aspects
 should cause adulteries- as if they could thus, through the agency
 of human incontinence, satisfy their own mutual desires- is 
 not such a
 notion the height of unreason? And who could accept the fancy that
 their happiness comes from their seeing each other in this or that
 relative position and not from their own settled nature?
 
 </p><p>Again: countless myriads of living beings are born and 
 continue to
 be: to minister continuously to every separate one of these; to make
 them famous, rich, poor, lascivious; to shape the active 
 tendencies of
 every single one- what kind of life is this for the stars, how could
 they possibly handle a task so huge?
 
 </p><p>They are to watch, we must suppose, the rising of each several
 constellation and upon that signal to act; such a one, they see, has
 risen by so many degrees, representing so many of the periods of its
 upward path; they reckon on their fingers at what moment they must
 take the action which, executed prematurely, would be out of order:
 and in the sum, there is no One Being controlling the entire scheme;
 all is made over to the stars singly, as if there were no Sovereign
 Unity, standing as source of all the forms of Being in subordinate
 association with it, and delegating to the separate members, in
 their appropriate Kinds, the task of accomplishing its purposes and
 bringing its latent potentiality into act.
 
 </p><p>This is a separatist theory, tenable only by minds 
 ignorant of the
 nature of a Universe which has a ruling principle and a first cause
 operative downwards through every member.
