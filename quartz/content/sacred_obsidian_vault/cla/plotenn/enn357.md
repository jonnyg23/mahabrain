 <p>38. Whatever springs automatically from the All out of that
 distinctive life of its own, and, in addition to that self-moving
 activity, whatever is due to some specific agency- for example, to
 prayers, simple or taking the form of magic incantations- this
 entire range of production is to be referred, not to each such
 single cause, but to the nature of the thing produced [i.e., to a
 certain natural tendency in the product to exist with its own
 quality].
 
 </p><p>All that forwards life or some other useful purpose is to be
 ascribed to the transmission characteristic of the All; it is
 something flowing from the major of an integral to its 
 minor. Where we
 think we see the transmission of some force unfavourable to the
 production of living beings, the flaw must be found in the inability
 of the subject to take in what would serve it: for what happens does
 not happen upon a void; there is always specific form and quality;
 anything that could be affected must have an underlying nature
 definite and characterized. The inevitable blendings, further, have
 their constructive effect, every element adding something 
 contributory
 to the life. Then again some influence may come into play at the
 time when the forces of a beneficent nature are not acting: the
 co-ordination of the entire system of things does not always allow
 to each several entity everything that it needs: and further we
 ourselves add a great deal to what is transmitted to us.
 
 </p><p>None the less all entwines into a unity: and there is something
 wonderful in the agreement holding among these various things of
 varied source, even of sources frankly opposite; the secret lies in
 a variety within a unity. When by the standard of the better kind
 among things of process anything falls short- the reluctance of its
 material substratum having prevented its perfect shaping under idea-
 it may be thought of as being deficient in that noble element whose
 absence brings to shame: the thing is a blend, something due to the
 high beings, an alloy from the underlying nature, something added by
 the self.
 
 </p><p>Because all is ever being knit, all brought to culmination in
 unity, therefore all events are indicated; but this does not make
 virtue a matter of compulsion; its spontaneity is equally 
 inwoven into
 the ordered system by the general law that the things of this sphere
 are pendant from the higher, that the content of our universe lies
 in the hands of the diviner beings in whom our world is participant.
