 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 7</h4>
 
 <p>7. It remains to notice the theory of the one Causing-Principle
 alleged to interweave everything with everything else, to make
 things into a chain, to determine the nature and condition of each
 phenomenon- a Principle which, acting through seminal Reason-Forms-
 Logoi Spermatikoi- elaborates all that exists and happens.
 
 </p><p>The doctrine is close to that which makes the Soul of 
 the Universe
 the source and cause of all condition and of all movement whether
 without or- supposing that we are allowed as individuals some little
 power towards personal act- within ourselves.
 
 </p><p>But it is the theory of the most rigid and universal Necessity:
 all the causative forces enter into the system, and so every several
 phenomenon rises necessarily; where nothing escapes Destiny, nothing
 has power to check or to change. Such forces beating upon us, as it
 were, from one general cause leave us no resource but to go 
 where they
 drive. All our ideas will be determined by a chain of 
 previous causes;
 our doings will be determined by those ideas; personal action
 becomes a mere word. That we are the agents does not save our
 freedom when our action is prescribed by those causes; we have
 precisely what belongs to everything that lives, to infants guided
 by blind impulses, to lunatics; all these act; why, even fire acts;
 there is act in everything that follows the plan of its being,
 servilely.
 
 </p><p>No one that sees the implications of this theory can hesitate:
 unable to halt at such a determinant principle, we seek for other
 explanations of our action.
