 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 8</h4>
 
 <p>8. These considerations, amounting to the settlement of the
 question, are not countered by the phenomenon of sympathy; the
 response between soul and soul is due to the mere fact that 
 all spring
 from that self-same soul [the next to Divine Mind] from which
 springs the Soul of the All.
 
 </p><p>We have already stated that the one soul is also multiple; and
 we have dealt with the different forms of relationship between part
 and whole: we have investigated the different degrees existing
 within soul; we may now add, briefly, that differences might be
 induced, also, by the bodies with which the soul has to do, and,
 even more, by the character and mental operations carried over from
 the conduct of the previous lives. "The life-choice made by 
 a soul has
 a correspondence"- we read- "with its former lives."
 
 </p><p>As regards the nature of soul in general, the differences have
 been defined in the passage in which we mentioned the secondary and
 tertiary orders and laid down that, while all souls are
 all-comprehensive, each ranks according to its operative phase- one
 becoming Uniate in the achieved fact, another in knowledge, 
 another in
 desire, according to the distinct orientation by which each is, or
 tends to become, what it looks upon. The very fulfillment and
 perfectionment attainable by souls cannot but be different.
 
 </p><p>But, if in the total the organization in which they have their
 being is compact of variety- as it must be since every
 Reason-Principle is a unity of multiplicity and variety, and may be
 thought of as a psychic animated organism having many shapes at its
 command- if this is so and all constitutes a system in which being
 is not cut adrift from being, if there is nothing chance- borne
 among beings as there is none even in bodily organisms, then it
 follows that Number must enter into the scheme; for, once 
 again, Being
 must be stable; the members of the Intellectual must possess 
 identity,
 each numerically one; this is the condition of individuality. Where,
 as in bodily masses, the Idea is not essentially native, and the
 individuality is therefore in flux, existence under ideal form can
 rise only out of imitation of the Authentic Existences; 
 these last, on
 the contrary, not rising out of any such conjunction [as the duality
 of Idea and dead Matter] have their being in that which is 
 numerically
 one, that which was from the beginning, and neither becomes what it
 has not been nor can cease to be what it is.
 
 </p><p>Even supposing Real-Beings [such as soul] to be produced by some
 other principle, they are certainly not made from Matter; or, if
 they were, the creating principle must infuse into them, from within
 itself, something of the nature of Real-Being; but, at this, it
 would itself suffer change, as it created more or less. And, after
 all, why should it thus produce at any given moment rather 
 than remain
 for ever stationary?
 
 </p><p>Moreover the produced total, variable from more to less, 
 could not
 be an eternal: yet the soul, it stands agreed, is eternal.
 
 </p><p>But what becomes of the soul's infinity if it is thus fixed?
 
 </p><p>The infinity is a matter of power: there is question, not of the
 soul's being divisible into an infinite number of parts, but of an
 infinite possible effectiveness: it is infinity in the sense in
 which the Supreme God, also, is free of all bound.
 
 </p><p>This means that it is no external limit that defines the
 individual being or the extension of souls any more than of God; on
 the contrary each in right of its own power is all that it chooses
 to be: and we are not to think of it as going forth from itself
 [losing its unity by any partition]: the fact is simply that the
 element within it, which is apt to entrance into body, has the power
 of immediate projection any whither: the soul is certainly not
 wrenched asunder by its presence at once in foot and in finger. Its
 presence in the All is similarly unbroken; over its entire range it
 exists in every several part of everything having even vegetal life,
 even in a part cut off from the main; in any possible 
 segment it is as
 it is at its source. For the body of the All is a unit, and soul is
 everywhere present to it as to one thing.
 
 </p><p>When some animal rots and a multitude of others spring from it,
 the Life-Principle now present is not the particular soul that was
 in the larger body; that body has ceased to be receptive of soul, or
 there would have been no death; what happens is that 
 whatsoever in the
 product of the decay is apt material for animal existence of one
 kind or another becomes ensouled by the fact that soul is nowhere
 lacking, though a recipient of soul may be. This new ensouling does
 not mean, however, an increase in the number of souls: all 
 depend from
 the one or, rather, all remains one: it is as with ourselves; some
 elements are shed, others grow in their place; the soul abandons the
 discarded and flows into the newcoming as long as the one soul of
 the man holds its ground; in the All the one soul holds its 
 ground for
 ever; its distinct contents now retain soul and now reject 
 it, but the
 total of spiritual beings is unaffected.
