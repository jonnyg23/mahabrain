 <p>5. All that comes to be, work of nature or of craft, some wisdom
 has made: everywhere a wisdom presides at a making.
 
 </p><p>No doubt the wisdom of the artist may be the guide of 
 the work; it
 is sufficient explanation of the wisdom exhibited in the 
 arts; but the
 artist himself goes back, after all, to that wisdom in 
 Nature which is
 embodied in himself; and this is not a wisdom built up of 
 theorems but
 one totality, not a wisdom consisting of manifold detail
 co-ordinated into a unity but rather a unity working out into detail.
 
 </p><p>Now, if we could think of this as the primal wisdom, we need
 look no further, since, at that, we have discovered a principle
 which is neither a derivative nor a "stranger in something strange
 to it." But if we are told that, while this Reason-Principle is in
 Nature, yet Nature itself is its source, we ask how Nature came to
 possess it; and, if Nature derived it from some other source, we ask
 what that other source may be; if, on the contrary, the principle is
 self-sprung, we need look no further: but if we are referred to the
 Intellectual-Principle we must make clear whether the
 Intellectual-Principle engendered the wisdom: if we learn 
 that it did,
 we ask whence: if from itself, then inevitably, it is itself Wisdom.
 
 </p><p>The true Wisdom, then [found to be identical with the
 Intellectual-Principle] is Real Being; and Real Being is 
 Wisdom; it is
 wisdom that gives value to Real Being; and Being is Real in virtue
 of its origin in wisdom. It follows that all forms of existence not
 possessing wisdom are, indeed, Beings in right of the wisdom which
 went to their forming but, as not in themselves possessing 
 it, are not
 Real Beings.
 
 </p><p>We cannot therefore think that the divine Beings of that sphere,
 or the other supremely blessed There, need look to our apparatus of
 science: all of that realm, all is noble image, such images as we
 may conceive to lie within the soul of the wise- but There not as
 inscription but as authentic existence. The ancients had this in
 mind when they declared the Ideas to be Beings, Essentials.
