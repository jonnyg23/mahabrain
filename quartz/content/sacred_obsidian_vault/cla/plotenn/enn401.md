 <p>2. Enquiring, then, of Plato as to our own soul, we find 
 ourselves
 forced to enquire into the nature of soul in general- to 
 discover what
 there can be in its character to bring it into partnership with
 body, and, again, what this kosmos must be in which, willing 
 unwilling
 or in any way at all, soul has its activity.
 
 </p><p>We have to face also the question as to whether the Creator has
 planned well or ill...... like our souls, which it may be, are such
 that governing their inferior, the body, they must sink deeper and
 deeper into it if they are to control it.
 
 </p><p>No doubt the individual body- though in all cases appropriately
 placed within the universe- is of itself in a state of dissolution,
 always on the way to its natural terminus, demanding much irksome
 forethought to save it from every kind of outside assailant, always
 gripped by need, requiring every help against constant 
 difficulty: but
 the body inhabited by the World-Soul- complete, competent,
 self-sufficing, exposed to nothing contrary to its nature- this
 needs no more than a brief word of command, while the governing soul
 is undeviatingly what its nature makes it wish to be, and, amenable
 neither to loss nor to addition, knows neither desire nor distress.
 
 </p><p>This is how we come to read that our soul, entering into
 association with that complete soul and itself thus made perfect,
 walks the lofty ranges, administering the entire kosmos, and that as
 long as it does not secede and is neither inbound to body nor held
 in any sort of servitude, so long it tranquilly bears its part in
 the governance of the All, exactly like the world-soul itself; for
 in fact it suffers no hurt whatever by furnishing body with the
 power to existence, since not every form of care for the 
 inferior need
 wrest the providing soul from its own sure standing in the highest.
 
 </p><p>The soul's care for the universe takes two forms: there is the
 supervising of the entire system, brought to order by 
 deedless command
 in a kindly presidence, and there is that over the individual,
 implying direct action, the hand to the task, one might say, in
 immediate contact: in the second kind of care the agent absorbs much
 of the nature of its object.
 
 </p><p>Now in its comprehensive government of the heavenly system, the
 soul's method is that of an unbroken transcendence in its highest
 phases, with penetration by its lower power: at this, God can no
 longer be charged with lowering the All-Soul, which has not been
 deprived of its natural standing and from eternity possesses and
 will unchangeably possess that rank and habit which could never have
 been intruded upon it against the course of nature but must be its
 characteristic quality, neither failing ever nor ever beginning.
 
 </p><p>Where we read that the souls or stars stand to their bodily
 forms as the All to the material forms within it- for these starry
 bodies are declared to be members of the soul's circuit- we are
 given to understand that the star-souls also enjoy the blissful
 condition of transcendence and immunity that becomes them.
 
 </p><p>And so we might expect: commerce with the body is repudiated for
 two only reasons, as hindering the soul's intellective act and as
 filling with pleasure, desire, pain; but neither of these
 misfortunes can befall a soul which has never deeply penetrated into
 the body, is not a slave but a sovereign ruling a body of such an
 order as to have no need and no shortcoming and therefore to give
 ground for neither desire nor fear.
 
 </p><p>There is no reason why it should be expectant of evil with
 regard to such a body nor is there any such preoccupied concern,
 bringing about a veritable descent, as to withdraw it from 
 its noblest
 and most blessed vision; it remains always intent upon the Supreme,
 and its governance of this universe is effected by a power 
 not calling
 upon act.
