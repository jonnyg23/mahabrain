 <p>33. The Circuit does not go by chance but under the
 Reason-Principle of the living whole; therefore there must be a
 harmony between cause and caused; there must be some order ranging
 things to each other's purpose, or in due relation to each other:
 every several configuration within the Circuit must be accompanied
 by a change in the position and condition of things 
 subordinate to it,
 which thus by their varied rhythmic movement make up one total
 dance-play.
 
 </p><p>In our dance-plays there are outside elements contributing to
 the total effect- fluting, singing, and other linked accessories-
 and each of these changes in each new movement: there is no need to
 dwell on these; their significance is obvious. But besides this
 there is the fact that the limbs of the dancer cannot possibly keep
 the same positions in every figure; they adapt themselves to 
 the plan,
 bending as it dictates, one lowered, another raised, one active,
 another resting as the set pattern changes. The dancer's mind is on
 his own purpose; his limbs are submissive to the dance-movement
 which they accomplish to the end, so that the connoisseur can
 explain that this or that figure is the motive for the lifting,
 bending, concealment, effacing, of the various members of the body;
 and in all this the executant does not choose the particular motions
 for their own sake; the whole play of the entire person dictates the
 necessary position to each limb and member as it serves to the plan.
 
 </p><p>Now this is the mode in which the heavenly beings [the diviner
 members of the All] must be held to be causes wherever they have any
 action, and, when. they do not act, to indicate.
 
 </p><p>Or, a better statement: the entire kosmos puts its entire life
 into act, moving its major members with its own action and 
 unceasingly
 setting them in new positions; by the relations thus established, of
 these members to each other and to the whole, and by the different
 figures they make together, the minor members in turn are brought
 under the system as in the movements of some one living 
 being, so that
 they vary according to the relations, positions, configurations: the
 beings thus co-ordinated are not the causes; the cause is the
 coordinating All; at the same time it is not to be thought of as
 seeking to do one thing and actually doing another, for there is
 nothing external to it since it is the cause by actually 
 being all: on
 the one side the configurations, on the other the inevitable effects
 of those configurations upon a living being moving as a unit and,
 again, upon a living being [an All] thus by its nature conjoined and
 concomitant and, of necessity, at once subject and object to its own
 activities.
