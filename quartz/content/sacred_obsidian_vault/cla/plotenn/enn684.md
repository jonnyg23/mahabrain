 <p>3. All this calls for examination; the enquiry must 
 bring us close
 to the solution as regards the gods.
 
 </p><p>We have traced self-disposal to will, will to reasoning and,
 next step, to right reasoning; perhaps to right reasoning we must
 add knowledge, for however sound opinion and act may be they do not
 yield true freedom when the adoption of the right course is 
 the result
 of hazard or of some presentment from the fancy with no knowledge of
 the foundations of that rightness.
 
 </p><p>Taking it that the presentment of fancy is not a matter of our
 will and choice, how can we think those acting at its dictation to
 be free agents? Fancy strictly, in our use, takes it rise from
 conditions of the body; lack of food and drink sets up presentments,
 and so does the meeting of these needs; similarly with seminal
 abundance and other humours of the body. We refuse to range under
 the principle of freedom those whose conduct is directed by such
 fancy: the baser sort, therefore, mainly so guided, cannot 
 be credited
 with self-disposal or voluntary act. Self-disposal, to us, belongs
 to those who, through the activities of the Intellectual-Principle,
 live above the states of the body. The spring of freedom is the
 activity of Intellectual-Principle, the highest in our being; the
 proposals emanating thence are freedom; such desires as are formed
 in the exercise of the Intellectual act cannot be classed as
 involuntary; the gods, therefore, that live in this state, living by
 Intellectual-Principle and by desire conformed to it, 
 possess freedom.
