 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 8</h4>
 
 <p>8. What can this other cause be; one standing above those
 treated of; one that leaves nothing causeless, that 
 preserves sequence
 and order in the Universe and yet allows ourselves some reality and
 leaves room for prediction and augury?
 
 </p><p>Soul: we must place at the crest of the world of beings, this
 other Principle, not merely the Soul of the Universe but, included
 in it, the Soul of the individual: this, no mean Principle, is
 needed to be the bond of union in the total of things, not, itself,
 a thing sprung like things from life-seeds, but a first-hand Cause,
 bodiless and therefore supreme over itself, free, beyond the reach
 of kosmic Cause: for, brought into body, it would not be
 unrestrictedly sovereign; it would hold rank in a series.
 
 </p><p>Now the environment into which this independent principle
 enters, when it comes to this midpoint, will be largely led by
 secondary causes [or, by chance-causes]: there will therefore be a
 compromise; the action of the Soul will be in part guided by this
 environment while in other matters it will be sovereign, leading the
 way where it will. The nobler Soul will have the greater power; the
 poorer Soul, the lesser. A soul which defers to the bodily 
 temperament
 cannot escape desire and rage and is abject in poverty, 
 overbearing in
 wealth, arbitrary in power. The soul of nobler nature holds good
 against its surroundings; it is more apt to change them than to be
 changed, so that often it improves the environment and, where it
 must make concession, at least keeps its innocence.
