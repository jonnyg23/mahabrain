 <p>2. It can be demonstrated that soul must, necessarily, be of
 just this nature and that there can be no other soul than such a
 being, one neither wholly partible but both at once.
 
 </p><p>If it had the nature of body it would consist of isolated
 members each unaware of the conditions of every other; there would
 be a particular soul- say a soul of the finger- answering as a
 distinct and independent entity to every local experience; in
 general terms, there would be a multiplicity of souls administering
 each individual; and, moreover, the universe would be governed not
 by one soul but by an incalculable number, each standing apart to
 itself. But, without a dominant unity, continuity is meaningless.
 
 </p><p>The theory that "Impressions reach the leading-principle by
 progressive stages" must be dismissed as mere illusion.
 
 </p><p>In the first place, it affirms without investigation a "leading"
 phase of the soul.
 
 </p><p>What can justify this assigning of parts to the soul, the
 distinguishing one part from another? What quantity, or what
 difference of quality, can apply to a thing defined as a
 self-consistent whole of unbroken unity?
 
 </p><p>Again, would perception be vested in that leading 
 principle alone,
 or in the other phases as well?
 
 </p><p>If a given experience bears only on that "leading principle," it
 would not be felt as lodged in any particular members of the 
 organism;
 if, on the other hand, it fastens on some other phase of the 
 soul- one
 not constituted for sensation- that phase cannot transmit any
 experience to the leading principle, and there can be no sensation.
 
 </p><p>Again, suppose sensation vested in the 
 "leading-principle" itself:
 then, a first alternative, it will be felt in some one part of that
 [some specifically sensitive phase], the other part excluding a
 perception which could serve no purpose; or, in the second
 alternative, there will be many distinct sensitive phases, 
 an infinite
 number, with difference from one to another. In that second case,
 one sensitive phase will declare "I had this sensation primarily";
 others will have to say "I felt the sensation that rose elsewhere";
 but either the site of the experience will be a matter of doubt to
 every phase except the first, or each of the parts of the 
 soul will be
 deceived into allocating the occurrence within its own particular
 sphere.
 
 </p><p>If, on the contrary, the sensation is vested not merely in the
 "leading principle," but in any and every part of the soul, what
 special function raises the one rather than the other into that
 leading rank, or why is the sensation to be referred to it 
 rather than
 elsewhere? And how, at this, account for the unity of the knowledge
 brought in by diverse senses, by eyes, by ears?
 
 </p><p>On the other hand, if the soul is a perfect unity- 
 utterly strange
 to part, a self-gathered whole- if it continuously eludes 
 all touch of
 multiplicity and divisibility- then, no whole taken up into it can
 ever be ensouled; soul will stand as circle-centre to every object
 [remote on the circumference], and the entire mass of a living being
 is soulless still.
 
 </p><p>There is, therefore, no escape: soul is, in the degree
 indicated, one and many, parted and impartible. We cannot 
 question the
 possibility of a thing being at once a unity and multi-present,
 since to deny this would be to abolish the principle which sustains
 and administers the universe; there must be a Kind which 
 encircles and
 supports all and conducts all with wisdom, a principle which is
 multiple since existence is multiple, and yet is one soul 
 always since
 a container must be a unity: by the multiple unity of its nature, it
 will furnish life to the multiplicity of the series of an all; by
 its impartible unity, it will conduct a total to wise ends.
 
 </p><p>In the case of things not endowed with intelligence, the
 "leading-principle" is their mere unity- a lower reproduction of the
 soul's efficiency.
 
 </p><p>This is the deeper meaning of the profound passage [in the
 Timaeus], where we read "By blending the impartible, eternally
 unchanging essence with that in division among bodies, he produced a
 third form of essence partaking of both qualities."
 
 </p><p>Soul, therefore, is, in this definite sense, one and many; the
 Ideal-Form resident in body is many and one; bodies themselves are
 exclusively many; the Supreme is exclusively one.
