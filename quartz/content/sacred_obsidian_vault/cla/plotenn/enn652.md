 <p>14. On the nature of the Intellectual-Principle we get light
 from its manifestations; they show that it demands such diversity as
 is compatible with its being a monad. Take what principle you will,
 that of plant or animal: if this principle were a pure unity 
 and not a
 specifically varied thing, it could not so serve as principle; its
 product would be Matter, the principle not having taken all those
 forms necessary if Matter is to be permeated and utterly
 transformed. A face is not one mass; there are nose and eyes; and
 the nose is not a unity but has the differences which make it a
 nose; as bare unity it would be mere mass.
 
 </p><p>There is infinity in Intellectual-Principle since, of its very
 nature, it is a multiple unity, not with the unity of a 
 house but with
 that of a Reason-Principle, multiple in itself: in the one
 Intellectual design it includes within itself, as it were in
 outline, all the outlines, all the patterns. All is within 
 it, all the
 powers and intellections; the division is not determined by 
 a boundary
 but goes ever inward; this content is held as the living universe
 holds the natural forms of the living creatures in it from the
 greatest to the least, down even to the minutest powers 
 where there is
 a halt at the individual form. The discrimination is not of items
 huddled within a sort of unity; this is what is known as the 
 Universal
 Sympathy, not of course the sympathy known here which is a copy and
 prevails amongst things in separation; that authentic Sympathy
 consists in all being a unity and never discriminate.
