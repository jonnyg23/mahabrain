 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 7</h4>
 
 <p>7. It is inevitably necessary to think of all as contained
 within one nature; one nature must hold and encompass all; there
 cannot be as in the realm of sense thing apart from thing, here a
 sun and elsewhere something else; all must be mutually present
 within a unity. This is the very nature of the
 Intellectual-Principle as we may know from soul which reproduces it
 and from what we call Nature under which and by which the things of
 process are brought into their disjointed being while that Nature
 itself remains indissolubly one.
 
 </p><p>But within the unity There, the several entities have 
 each its own
 distinct existence; the all-embracing Intellect sees what is in it,
 what is within Being; it need not look out upon them since 
 it contains
 them, need not separate them since they stand for ever 
 distinct within
 it.
 
 </p><p>Against doubters we cite the fact of participation; the
 greatness and beauty of the Intellectual-Principle we know by the
 soul's longing towards it; the longing of the rest towards 
 soul is set
 up by its likeness to its higher and to the possibility open to them
 of attaining resemblance through it.
 
 </p><p>It is surely inconceivable that any living thing be beautiful
 failing a Life-Absolute of a wonderful, an ineffable, beauty: this
 must be the Collective Life, made up of all living things, or
 embracing all, forming a unity coextensive with all, as our universe
 is a unity embracing all the visible.
