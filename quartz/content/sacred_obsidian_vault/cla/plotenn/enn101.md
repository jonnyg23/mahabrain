 <p>3. The truth may be resumed in this way:
 
 </p><p>There is a lowest power of the Soul, a nearest to earth, and
 this is interwoven throughout the entire universe: another phase
 possesses sensation, while yet another includes the Reason which is
 concerned with the objects of sensation: this higher phase holds
 itself to the spheres, poised towards the Above but hovering over
 the lesser Soul and giving forth to it an effluence which makes it
 more intensely vital.
 
 </p><p>The lower Soul is moved by the higher which, besides encircling
 and supporting it, actually resides in whatsoever part of it has
 thrust upwards and attained the spheres. The lower then, ringed
 round by the higher and answering its call, turns and tends towards
 it; and this upward tension communicates motion to the material
 frame in which it is involved: for if a single point in a 
 spheric mass
 is in any degree moved, without being drawn away from the rest, it
 moves the whole, and the sphere is set in motion. Something of the
 same kind happens in the case of our bodies: the unspatial 
 movement of
 the Soul- in happiness, for instance, or at the idea of some
 pleasant event- sets up a spatial movement in the body: the Soul,
 attaining in its own region some good which increases its sense of
 life, moves towards what pleases it; and so, by force of the union
 established in the order of nature, it moves the body, in the body's
 region, that is in space.
 
 </p><p>As for that phase of the Soul in which sensation is vested, it,
 too, takes its good from the Supreme above itself and moves,
 rejoicingly, in quest of it: and since the object of its desire is
 everywhere, it too ranges always through the entire scope of the
 universe.
 
 </p><p>The Intellectual-Principle has no such progress in any 
 region; its
 movement is a stationary act, for it turns upon itself.
 
 </p><p>And this is why the All, circling as it does, is at the same
 time at rest.
