 <p>5. It is possible to reconcile all these apparent
 contradictions- the divine sowing to birth, as opposed to a
 voluntary descent aiming at the completion of the universe; the
 judgement and the cave; necessity and free choice- in fact the
 necessity includes the choice-embodiment as an evil; the Empedoclean
 teaching of a flight from God, a wandering away, a sin bringing its
 punishment; the "solace by flight" of Heraclitus; in a word a
 voluntary descent which is also voluntary.
 
 </p><p>All degeneration is no doubt involuntary, yet when it has been
 brought about by an inherent tendency, that submission to 
 the inferior
 may be described as the penalty of an act.
 
 </p><p>On the other hand these experiences and actions are determined
 by an external law of nature, and they are due to the movement of a
 being which in abandoning its superior is running out to serve the
 needs of another: hence there is no inconsistency or untruth 
 in saying
 that the soul is sent down by God; final results are always to be
 referred to the starting point even across many intervening stages.
 
 </p><p>Still there is a twofold flaw: the first lies in the 
 motive of the
 Soul's descent [its audacity, its Tolma], and the second in the evil
 it does when actually here: the first is punished by what 
 the soul has
 suffered by its descent: for the faults committed here, the lesser
 penalty is to enter into body after body- and soon to return- by
 judgement according to desert, the word judgement indicating a
 divine ordinance; but any outrageous form of ill-doing incurs a
 proportionately greater punishment administered under the 
 surveillance
 of chastising daimons.
 
 </p><p>Thus, in sum, the soul, a divine being and a dweller in the
 loftier realms, has entered body; it is a god, a later phase of the
 divine: but, under stress of its powers and of its tendency to bring
 order to its next lower, it penetrates to this sphere in a voluntary
 plunge: if it turns back quickly, all is well; it will have taken no
 hurt by acquiring the knowledge of evil and coming to understand
 what sin is, by bringing its forces into manifest play, by
 exhibiting those activities and productions which, remaining merely
 potential in the unembodied, might as well never have been 
 even there,
 if destined never to come into actuality, so that the soul itself
 would never have known that suppressed and inhibited total.
 
 </p><p>The act reveals the power, a power hidden, and we might 
 almost say
 obliterated or nonexistent, unless at some moment it became 
 effective:
 in the world as it is, the richness of the outer stirs us all to the
 wonder of the inner whose greatness is displayed in acts so splendid.
