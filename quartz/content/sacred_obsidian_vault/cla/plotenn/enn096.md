 <p>7. We can scarcely do better, in fine, than follow Plato.
 
 </p><p>Thus:
 
 </p><p>In the universe as a whole there must necessarily be 
 such a degree
 of solidity, that is to say, of resistance, as will ensure that the
 earth, set in the centre, be a sure footing and support to the
 living beings moving over it, and inevitably communicate something
 of its own density to them: the earth will possess coherence by its
 own unaided quality, but visibility by the presence of fire: it will
 contain water against the dryness which would prevent the cohesion
 of its particles; it will hold air to lighten its bulky matters; it
 will be in contact with the celestial fire- not as being a member of
 the sidereal system but by the simple fact that the fire 
 there and our
 earth both belong to the ordered universe so that something of the
 earth is taken up by the fire as something of the fire by the earth
 and something of everything by everything else.
 
 </p><p>This borrowing, however, does not mean that the one thing
 taking-up from the other enters into a composition, becoming an
 element in a total of both: it is simply a consequence of the kosmic
 fellowship; the participant retains its own being and takes over not
 the thing itself but some property of the thing, not air but air's
 yielding softness, not fire but fire's incandescence: mixing is
 another process, a complete surrender with a resultant compound not,
 as in this case, earth- remaining earth, the solidity and density we
 know- with something of fire's qualities superadded.
 
 </p><p>We have authority for this where we read:
 
 </p><p>"At the second circuit from the earth, God kindled a 
 light": he is
 speaking of the sun which, elsewhere, he calls the all-glowing and,
 again, the all-gleaming: thus he prevents us imagining it to be
 anything else but fire, though of a peculiar kind; in other words it
 is light, which he distinguishes from flame as being only modestly
 warm: this light is a corporeal substance but from it there shines
 forth that other "light" which, though it carries the same name, we
 pronounce incorporeal, given forth from the first as its flower and
 radiance, the veritable "incandescent body." Plato's word earthy is
 commonly taken in too depreciatory a sense: he is thinking 
 of earth as
 the principle of solidity; we are apt to ignore his distinctions and
 think of the concrete clay.
 
 </p><p>Fire of this order, giving forth this purest light, 
 belongs to the
 upper realm, and there its seat is fixed by nature; but we must not,
 on that account, suppose the flame of earth to be associated with
 the beings of that higher sphere.
 
 </p><p>No: the flame of this world, once it has attained a certain
 height, is extinguished by the currents of air opposed to it.
 Moreover, as it carries an earthy element on its upward path, it is
 weighed downwards and cannot reach those loftier regions. It comes
 to a stand somewhere below the moon- making the air at that point
 subtler- and its flame, if any flame can persist, is subdued and
 softened, and no longer retains its first intensity, but gives out
 only what radiance it reflects from the light above.
 
 </p><p>And it is that loftier light- falling variously upon the 
 stars; to
 each in a certain proportion- that gives them their characteristic
 differences, as well in magnitude as in colour; just such light
 constitutes also the still higher heavenly bodies which, 
 however, like
 clear air, are invisible because of the subtle texture and 
 unresisting
 transparency of their material substance and also by their very
 distance.
