 <p>4. Another theory:
 
 </p><p>The Universe is permeated by one Soul, Cause of all things and
 events; every separate phenomenon as a member of a whole moves in
 its place with the general movement; all the various causes spring
 into action from one source: therefore, it is argued, the entire
 descending claim of causes and all their interaction must follow
 inevitably and so constitute a universal determination. A plant
 rises from a root, and we are asked on that account to 
 reason that not
 only the interconnection linking the root to all the members 
 and every
 member to every other but the entire activity and experience of the
 plant, as well, must be one organized overruling, a "destiny" of the
 plant.
 
 </p><p>But such an extremity of determination, a destiny so
 all-pervasive, does away with the very destiny that is affirmed: it
 shatters the sequence and co-operation of causes.
 
 </p><p>It would be unreasonable to attribute to destiny the movement of
 our limbs dictated by the mind and will: this is no case of
 something outside bestowing motion while another thing accepts it
 and is thus set into action; the mind itself is the prime mover.
 
 </p><p>Similarly in the case of the universal system; if all that
 performs act and is subject to experience constitutes one substance,
 if one thing does not really produce another thing under causes
 leading back continuously one to another, then it is not a truth
 that all happens by causes, there is nothing but a rigid 
 unity. We are
 no "We": nothing is our act; our thought is not ours; our decisions
 are the reasoning of something outside ourselves; we are no more
 agents than our feet are kickers when we use them to kick with.
 
 </p><p>No; each several thing must be a separate thing; there must be
 acts and thoughts that are our own; the good and evil done by each
 human being must be his own; and it is quite certain that we must
 not lay any vileness to the charge of the All.
