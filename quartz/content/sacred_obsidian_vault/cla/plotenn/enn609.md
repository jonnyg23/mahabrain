 <p>3. If this principle is the Authentic Existent and holds
 unchanging identity, does not go forth from itself, is untouched by
 any process of becoming or, as we have said, by any situation in
 place, then it must be always self-gathered, never in separation,
 not partly here and partly there, not giving forth from itself: any
 such instability would set it in thing after thing or at least in
 something other than itself: then it would no longer be 
 self-gathered;
 nor would it be immune, for anything within which it were 
 lodged would
 affect it; immune, it is not in anything. If, then, not standing
 away from itself, not distributed by part, not taking the slightest
 change, it is to be in many things while remaining a 
 self-concentrated
 entire, there is some way in which it has multipresence; it 
 is at once
 self-enclosed and not so: the only way is to recognise that 
 while this
 principle itself is not lodged in anything, all other things
 participate in it- all that are apt and in the measure of their
 aptitude.
 
 </p><p>Thus, we either cancel all that we have affirmed and the
 principles laid down, and deny the existence of any such Nature, or,
 that being impossible, we return to our first position:
 
 </p><p>The One, numerically identical, undistributed, an 
 unbroken entire,
 yet stands remote from nothing that exists by its side; but it does
 not, for that, need to pour itself forth: there is no 
 necessity either
 that certain portions of it enter into things or again that, while
 it remains self-abiding, something produced and projected from it
 enter at various points into that other order. Either would imply
 something of it remaining there while the emanant is elsewhere: thus
 separated from what has gone forth, it would experience local
 division. And would those emanants be, each in itself, whole or
 part? If part, the One has lost its nature, that of an entire, as we
 have already indicated; if whole, then either the whole is broken up
 to coincide point for point with that in which it is become 
 present or
 we are admitting that an unbroken identity can be omnipresent.
 
 </p><p>This is a reasoning, surely, founded on the thing itself and its
 essential nature, not introducing anything foreign, anything 
 belonging
 to the Other Order.
