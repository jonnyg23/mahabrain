 <p>13. (18) But how does the soul enter into body from the
 aloofness of the Intellectual?
 
 </p><p>There is the Intellectual-Principle which remains among the
 intellectual beings, living the purely intellective life; and this,
 knowing no impulse or appetite, is for ever stationary in that
 Realm. But immediately following upon it, there is that which has
 acquired appetite and, by this accruement, has already taken a great
 step outward; it has the desire of elaborating order on the model of
 what it has seen in the Intellectual-Principle: pregnant by those
 Beings, and in pain to the birth, it is eager to make, to create. In
 this new zest it strains towards the realm of sense: thus, while
 this primal soul in union with the Soul of the All transcends the
 sphere administered, it is inevitably turned outward, and has added
 the universe to its concern: yet in choosing to administer 
 the partial
 and exiling itself to enter the place in which it finds its
 appropriate task, it still is not wholly and exclusively 
 held by body:
 it is still in possession of the unembodied; and the
 Intellectual-Principle in it remains immune. As a whole it is partly
 in body, partly outside: it has plunged from among the primals and
 entered this sphere of tertiaries: the process has been an 
 activity of
 the Intellectual-Principle, which thus, while itself remaining in
 its identity, operates throughout the soul to flood the universe
 with beauty and penetrant order- immortal mind, eternal in its
 unfailing energy, acting through immortal soul.
