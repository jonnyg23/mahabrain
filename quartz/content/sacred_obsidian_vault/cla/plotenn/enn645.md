 <p>7. But if it is by becoming evil and inferior that the soul
 produces the animal nature, the making of ox or horse was not at the
 outset in its character; the reason-principle of the animal, and the
 animal itself, must lie outside of the natural plan?
 
 </p><p>Inferior, yes; but outside of nature, no. The thing 
 There [Soul in
 the Intellectual] was in some sense horse and dog from the
 beginning; given the condition, it produces the higher kind; let the
 condition fail, then, since produce it must, it produces what it
 may: it is like a skillful craftsman competent to create all kinds
 of works of art but reduced to making what is ordered and what the
 aptitude of his material indicates.
 
 </p><p>The power of the All-Soul, as Reason-Principle of the universe,
 may be considered as laying down a pattern before the effective
 separate powers go forth from it: this plan would be something like
 a tentative illumining of Matter; the elaborating soul would give
 minute articulation to these representations of itself; 
 every separate
 effective soul would become that towards which it tended, assuming
 that particular form as the choral dancer adapts himself to 
 the action
 set down for him.
 
 </p><p>But this is to anticipate: our enquiry was How there can be
 sense-perception in man without the implication that the Divine
 addresses itself to the realm of process. We maintained, and proved,
 that the Divine does not look to this realm but that things here are
 dependent upon those and represent them and that man here, 
 holding his
 powers from Thence, is directed Thither, so that, while sense makes
 the environment of what is of sense in him, the Intellectual 
 in him is
 linked to the Intellectual.
 
 </p><p>What we have called the perceptibles of that realm enter into
 cognisance in a way of their own, since they are not material, while
 the sensible sense here- so distinguished as dealing with corporeal
 objects- is fainter than the perception belonging to that higher
 world; the man of this sphere has sense-perception because 
 existing in
 a less true degree and taking only enfeebled images of things There-
 perceptions here are Intellections of the dimmer order, and the
 Intellections There are vivid perceptions.
