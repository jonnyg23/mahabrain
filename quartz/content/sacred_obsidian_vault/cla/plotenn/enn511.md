 <p>4. We are told that number is Quantity in the primary sense,
 number together with all continuous magnitude, space and time: these
 are the standards to which all else that is considered as Quantity
 is referred, including motion which is Quantity because its time is
 quantitative- though perhaps, conversely, the time takes its
 continuity from the motion.
 
 </p><p>If it is maintained that the continuous is a Quantity by the
 fact of its continuity, then the discrete will not be a Quantity.
 If, on the contrary, the continuous possesses Quantity as an 
 accident,
 what is there common to both continuous and discrete to make them
 quantities?
 
 </p><p>Suppose we concede that numbers are quantities: we are merely
 allowing them the name of quantity; the principle which gives them
 this name remains obscure.
 
 </p><p>On the other hand, line and surface and body are not called
 quantities; they are called magnitudes: they become known as
 quantities only when they are rated by number-two yards, three
 yards. Even the natural body becomes a quantity when 
 measured, as does
 the space which it occupies; but this is quantity accidental, not
 quantity essential; what we seek to grasp is not accidental quantity
 but Quantity independent and essential, Quantity-Absolute. Three
 oxen is not a quantity; it is their number, the three, that is
 Quantity; for in three oxen we are dealing with two 
 categories. So too
 with a line of a stated length, a surface of a given area; the area
 will be a quantity but not the surface, which only comes under that
 category when it constitutes a definite geometric figure.
 
 </p><p>Are we then to consider numbers, and numbers only, as 
 constituting
 the category of Quantity? If we mean numbers in themselves, they are
 substances, for the very good reason that they exist 
 independently. If
 we mean numbers displayed in the objects participant in number, the
 numbers which give the count of the objects- ten horses or ten oxen,
 and not ten units- then we have a paradoxical result: first, the
 numbers in themselves, it would appear, are substances but 
 the numbers
 in objects are not; and secondly, the numbers inhere in the 
 objects as
 measures [of extension or weight], yet as standing outside 
 the objects
 they have no measuring power, as do rulers and scales. If however
 their existence is independent, and they do not inhere in 
 the objects,
 but are simply called in for the purpose of measurement, the objects
 will be quantities only to the extent of participating in Quantity.
 
 </p><p>So with the numbers themselves: how can they constitute the
 category of Quantity? They are measures; but how do measures come to
 be quantities or Quantity? Doubtless in that, existing as they do
 among the Existents and not being adapted to any of the other
 categories, they find their place under the influence of verbal
 suggestion and so are referred to the so-called category of
 Quantity. We see the unit mark off one measurement and then 
 proceed to
 another; and number thus reveals the amount of a thing, and the mind
 measures by availing itself of the total figure.
 
 </p><p>It follows that in measuring it is not measuring essence; it
 pronounces its "one" or "two," whatever the character of the
 objects, even summing contraries. It does not take count of 
 condition-
 hot, handsome; it simply notes how many.
 
 </p><p>Number then, whether regarded in itself or in the participant
 objects, belongs to the category of Quantity, but the participant
 objects do not. "Three yards long" does not fall under the 
 category of
 Quantity, but only the three.
 
 </p><p>Why then are magnitudes classed as quantities? Not because they
 are so in the strict sense, but because they approximate to
 Quantity, and because objects in which magnitudes inhere are
 themselves designated as quantities. We call a thing great or small
 from its participation in a high number or a low. True, greatness
 and smallness are not claimed to be quantities, but relations: but
 it is by their apparent possession of quantity that they are thought
 of as relations. All this, however, needs more careful examination.
 
 </p><p>In sum, we hold that there is no single genus of Quantity. Only
 number is Quantity, the rest [magnitudes, space, time, motion]
 quantities only in a secondary degree. We have therefore not
 strictly one genus, but one category grouping the 
 approximate with the
 primary and the secondary.
 
 </p><p>We have however to enquire in what sense the abstract numbers
 are substances. Can it be that they are also in a manner 
 quantitative?
 Into whatever category they fall, the other numbers [those 
 inherent in
 objects] can have nothing in common with them but the name. 
 5. Speech,
 time, motion- in what sense are these quantities?
 
 </p><p>Let us begin with speech. It is subject to measurement, but only
 in so far as it is sound; it is not a quantity in its essential
 nature, which nature is that it be significant, as noun and verb are
 significant. The air is its Matter, as it is Matter to verb and
 noun, the components of speech.
 
 </p><p>To be more precise, we may define speech as an impact [made upon
 the outer air by the breath], though it is not so much the impact as
 the impression which the impact produces and which, as it were,
 imposes Form [upon the air]. Speech, thus, is rather an action than
 a quantity- an action with a significance. Though perhaps it would
 be truer to say that while this motion, this impact, is an 
 action, the
 counter-motion is an experience [or Passion]; or each may be from
 different points of view either an action or an experience: or we
 may think of speech as action upon a substrate [air] and experience
 within that substrate.
 
 </p><p>If however voice is not characteristically impact, but is simply
 air, two categories will be involved: voice is significant, and the
 one category will not be sufficient to account for this significance
 without associating with a second.
 
 </p><p>With regard to time, if it is to be thought of as a measure, we
 must determine what it is that applies this measure. It must clearly
 be either Soul or the Present Moment. If on the contrary we take
 time to be something measured and regard it as being of such and
 such extension- a year, for example- then we may consider it as a
 quantity: essentially however time is of a different nature; the
 very fact that we can attribute this or that length to it shows us
 that it is not length: in other words, time is not Quantity.
 Quantity in the strict sense is the Quantity not inbound with
 things; if things became quantities by mere participation in 
 Quantity,
 then Substance itself would be identical with Quantity.
 
 </p><p>Equality and inequality must be regarded as properties of
 Quantity-Absolute, not of the participants, or of them not 
 essentially
 but only accidentally: such participants as "three yards' length,"
 which becomes a quantity, not as belonging to a single genus of
 Quantity, but by being subsumed under the one head, the one category.
