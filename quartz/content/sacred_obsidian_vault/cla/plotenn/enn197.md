 <p>11. Are we, then, to conclude that particular things are
 determined by Necessities rooted in Nature and by the sequence of
 causes, and that everything is as good as anything can be?
 
 </p><p>No: the Reason-Principle is the sovereign, making all: it wills
 things as they are and, in its reasonable act, it produces even what
 we know as evil: it cannot desire all to be good: an artist would
 not make an animal all eyes; and in the same way, the 
 Reason-Principle
 would not make all divine; it makes Gods but also celestial spirits,
 the intermediate order, then men, then the animals; all is graded
 succession, and this in no spirit of grudging but in the 
 expression of
 a Reason teeming with intellectual variety.
 
 </p><p>We are like people ignorant of painting who complain that the
 colours are not beautiful everywhere in the picture: but the Artist
 has laid on the appropriate tint to every spot. Or we are censuring
 a drama because the persons are not all heroes but include a servant
 and a rustic and some scurrilous clown; yet take away the low
 characters and the power of the drama is gone; these are part and
 parcel of it.
