 <p>36. The Universe is immensely varied, the container of all the
 Reason-Principles and of infinite and diverse efficacies. In man, we
 are told, the eye has its power, and the bones have their varied
 powers, and so with each separate part of hand and of foot; and
 there is no member or organ without its own definite function, some
 separate power of its own- a diversity of which we can have no
 notion unless our studies take that direction. What is true of man
 must be true of the universe, and much more, since all this order is
 but a representation of the higher: it must contain an untellably
 wonderful variety of powers, with which, of course, the bodies
 moving through the heavens will be most richly endowed.
 
 </p><p>We cannot think of the universe as a soulless habitation,
 however vast and varied, a thing of materials easily told 
 off, kind by
 kind- wood and stone and whatever else there be, all blending into a
 kosmos: it must be alert throughout, every member living by its own
 life, nothing that can have existence failing to exist within it.
 
 </p><p>And here we have the solution of the problem, "How an ensouled
 living form can include the soulless": for this account allows
 grades of living within the whole, grades to some of which we deny
 life only because they are not perceptibly self-moved: in the truth,
 all of these have a hidden life; and the thing whose life is 
 patent to
 sense is made up of things which do not live to sense, but, none the
 less, confer upon their resultant total wonderful powers towards
 living. Man would never have reached to his actual height if the
 powers by which he acts were the completely soulless elements of his
 being; similarly the All could not have its huge life unless 
 its every
 member had a life of its own; this however does not necessarily
 imply a deliberate intention; the All has no need of intention to
 bring about its acts: it is older than intention, and therefore its
 powers have many servitors.
