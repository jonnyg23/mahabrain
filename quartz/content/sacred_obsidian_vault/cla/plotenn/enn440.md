 <p>9. In order, then, to know what the Divine Mind is, we must
 observe soul and especially its most God-like phase.
 
 </p><p>One certain way to this knowledge is to separate first, the man
 from the body- yourself, that is, from your body- next to put aside
 that soul which moulded the body, and, very earnestly, the system of
 sense with desires and impulses and every such futility, all setting
 definitely towards the mortal: what is left is the phase of the soul
 which we have declared to be an image of the Divine Intellect,
 retaining some light from that sun, while it pours downward upon the
 sphere of magnitudes [that is, of Matter] the light playing about
 itself which is generated from its own nature.
 
 </p><p>Of course we do not pretend that the sun's light [as the analogy
 might imply] remains a self-gathered and sun-centred thing: it is at
 once outrushing and indwelling; it strikes outward continuously, lap
 after lap, until it reaches us upon our earth: we must take it that
 all the light, including that which plays about the sun's orb, has
 travelled; otherwise we would have a void expanse, that of the
 space- which is material- next to the sun's orb. The Soul, on the
 contrary- a light springing from the Divine Mind and shining 
 about it-
 is in closest touch with that source; it is not in transit 
 but remains
 centred there, and, in likeness to that principle, it has no place:
 the light of the sun is actually in the air, but the soul is clean
 of all such contact so that its immunity is patent to itself and to
 any other of the same order.
 
 </p><p>And by its own characteristic act, though not without reasoning
 process, it knows the nature of the Intellectual-Principle which, on
 its side, knows itself without need of reasoning, for it is ever
 self-present whereas we become so by directing our soul towards it;
 our life is broken and there are many lives, but that principle
 needs no changings of life or of things; the lives it brings to
 being are for others not for itself: it cannot need the inferior;
 nor does it for itself produce the less when it possesses or is the
 all, nor the images when it possesses or is the prototype.
 
 </p><p>Anyone not of the strength to lay hold of the first soul, that
 possessing pure intellection, must grasp that which has to 
 do with our
 ordinary thinking and thence ascend: if even this prove too hard,
 let him turn to account the sensitive phase which carries the ideal
 forms of the less fine degree, that phase which, too, with 
 its powers,
 is immaterial and lies just within the realm of Ideal-principles.
 
 </p><p>One may even, if it seem necessary, begin as low as the
 reproductive soul and its very production and thence make the
 ascent, mounting from those ultimate ideal principles to the 
 ultimates
 in the higher sense, that is to the primals.
