 <p>8. But, we need not record in memory all we see; mere incidental
 concomitants need not occupy the imagination; when things vividly
 present to intuition, or knowledge, happen to occur in concrete
 form, it is not necessary- unless for purposes of a strictly 
 practical
 administration- to pass over that direct acquaintance, and 
 fasten upon
 the partial sense-presentation, which is already known in the larger
 knowledge, that of the Universe.
 
 </p><p>I will take this point by point:
 
 </p><p>First: it is not essential that everything seen should be laid
 up in the mind; for when the object is of no importance, or of no
 personal concern, the sensitive faculty, stimulated by the 
 differences
 in the objects present to vision, acts without accompaniment of the
 will, and is alone in entertaining the impression. The soul does not
 take into its deeper recesses such differences as do not meet any of
 its needs, or serve any of its purposes. Above all, when the soul's
 act is directed towards another order, it must utterly reject the
 memory of such things, things over and done with now, and not even
 taken into knowledge when they were present.
 
 </p><p>On the second point: circumstances, purely accidental, need
 not be present to the imaging faculty, and if they do so appear they
 need not be retained or even observed, and in fact the impression of
 any such circumstance does not entail awareness. Thus in local
 movement, if there is no particular importance to us in the fact
 that we pass through first this and then that portion of air, or
 that we proceed from some particular point, we do not take notice,
 or even know it as we walk. Similarly, if it were of no importance
 to us to accomplish any given journey, mere movement in the air
 being the main concern, we would not trouble to ask at what 
 particular
 point of place we were, or what distance we had traversed; if we
 have to observe only the act of movement and not its 
 duration, nothing
 to do which obliges us to think of time, the minutes are not
 recorded in our minds.
 
 </p><p>And finally, it is of common knowledge that, when the
 understanding is possessed of the entire act undertaken and has no
 reason to foresee any departure from the normal, it will no longer
 observe the detail; in a process unfailingly repeated without
 variation, attention to the unvarying detail is idleness.
 
 </p><p>So it is with the stars. They pass from point to point, but they
 move on their own affairs and not for the sake of traversing 
 the space
 they actually cover; the vision of the things that appear on the
 way, the journey by, nothing of this is their concern: their passing
 this or that is of accident not of essence, and their intention is
 to greater objects: moreover each of them journeys, unchangeably,
 the same unchanging way; and again, there is no question to them of
 the time they spend in any given section of the journey, even
 supposing time division to be possible in the case. All this
 granted, nothing makes it necessary that they should have any memory
 of places or times traversed. Besides this life of the ensouled
 stars is one identical thing [since they are one in the All-Soul] so
 that their very spatial movement is pivoted upon identity 
 and resolves
 itself into a movement not spatial but vital, the movement 
 of a single
 living being whose act is directed to itself, a being which to
 anything outside is at rest, but is in movement by dint of the inner
 life it possesses, the eternal life. Or we may take the comparison
 of the movement of the heavenly bodies to a choral dance; if we
 think of it as a dance which comes to rest at some given period, the
 entire dance, accomplished from beginning to end, will be perfect
 while at each partial stage it was imperfect: but if the dance is a
 thing of eternity, it is in eternal perfection. And if it is in
 eternal perfection, it has no points of time and place at which it
 will achieve perfection; it will, therefore, have no concern about
 attaining to any such points: it will, therefore, make no 
 measurements
 of time or place; it will have, therefore, no memory of time and
 place.
 
 </p><p>If the stars live a blessed life in their vision of the life
 inherent in their souls, and if, by force of their souls' tendency
 to become one, and by the light they cast from themselves upon the
 entire heavens, they are like the strings of a lyre which, being
 struck in tune, sing a melody in some natural scale... if this is
 the way the heavens, as one, are moved, and the component parts in
 their relation to the whole- the sidereal system moving as one, and
 each part in its own way, to the same purpose, though each, too,
 hold its own place- then our doctrine is all the more surely
 established; the life of the heavenly bodies is the more clearly an
 unbroken unity.
