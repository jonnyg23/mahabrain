 <p>5. We return to our statement that The First remains intact even
 when other entities spring from it.
 
 </p><p>In the case of numbers, the unit remains intact while something
 else produces, and thus number arises in dependence on the unit:
 much more then does the unit, The One, remain intact in the
 principle which is before all beings; especially since the entities
 produced in its likeness, while it thus remains intact, owe their
 existence to no other, but to its own all-sufficient power.
 
 </p><p>And just as there is, primarily or secondarily, some form or
 idea from the monad in each of the successive numbers- the 
 later still
 participating, though unequally, in the unit- so the series of
 Beings following upon The First bear, each, some form or idea
 derived from that source. In Number the participation establishes
 Quantity; in the realm of Being, the trace of The One establishes
 reality: existence is a trace of The One- our word for entity may
 probably be connected with that for unity.
 
 </p><p>What we know as Being, the first sequent upon The One, advanced
 a little outward, so to speak, then chose to go no further, turned
 inward again and comes to rest and is now the reality and hearth
 [ousia and hestia] of the universe. Pressing [with the rough
 breathing] on the word for Being [on] we have the word "hen" 
 [one], an
 indication that in our very form of speech we tell, as far as may
 be, that Being [the weaker] is that which proceeds from [the 
 stronger]
 The One. Thus both the thing that comes to be and Being itself are
 carriers of a copy, since they are outflows from the power of The
 primal One: this power sees and in its emotion tries to 
 represent what
 it sees and breaks into speech "On"; "einai"; "ousia," "hestia"
 [Existent: Existence: Essence: Hestia or Hearth], sounds which
 labour to express the essential nature of the universe 
 produced by the
 travail of the utterer and so to represent, as far as sounds may,
 the origin of reality.
