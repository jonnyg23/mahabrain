 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 12</h4>
 
 <p>12. Possessed of such powers, how does it happen that we do not
 lay hold of them, but for the most part, let these high activities
 go idle- some, even, of us never bringing them in any degree to
 effect?
 
 </p><p>The answer is that all the Divine Beings are unceasingly about
 their own act, the Intellectual-Principle and its Prior always
 self-intent; and so, too, the soul maintains its unfailing movement;
 for not all that passes in the soul is, by that fact, perceptible;
 we know just as much as impinges upon the faculty of sense. Any
 activity not transmitted to the sensitive faculty has not traversed
 the entire soul: we remain unaware because the human being includes
 sense-perception; man is not merely a part [the higher part] of the
 soul but the total.
 
 </p><p>None the less every being of the order of soul is in continuous
 activity as long as life holds, continuously executing to itself its
 characteristic act: knowledge of the act depends upon 
 transmission and
 perception. If there is to be perception of what is thus present, we
 must turn the perceptive faculty inward and hold it to attention
 there. Hoping to hear a desired voice, we let all others pass and
 are alert for the coming at last of that most welcome of sounds: so
 here, we must let the hearings of sense go by, save for sheer
 necessity, and keep the soul's perception bright and quick to the
 sounds from above.
