 <p>1. Some enquiry must be made into what is known as the complete
 transfusion of material substances.
 
 </p><p>Is it possible that fluid be blended with fluid in such 
 a way that
 each penetrate the other through and through? or- a difference of no
 importance if any such penetration occurs- that one of them pass
 completely through the other?
 
 </p><p>Those that admit only contact need not detain us. They 
 are dealing
 with mixture, not with the coalescence which makes the total a thing
 of like parts, each minutest particle being composed of all the
 combined elements.
 
 </p><p>But there are those who, admitting coalescence, confine it to
 the qualities: to them the material substances of two bodies are in
 contact merely, but in this contact of the matter they find footing
 for the qualities of each.
 
 </p><p>Their view is plausible because it rejects the notion of total
 admixture and because it recognizes that the masses of the mixing
 bodies must be whittled away if there is to be mixture without any
 gap, if, that is to say, each substance must be divided within
 itself through and through for complete interpenetration with the
 other. Their theory is confirmed by the cases in which two mixed
 substances occupy a greater space than either singly, especially a
 space equal to the conjoined extent of each: for, as they point out,
 in an absolute interpenetration the infusion of the one into 
 the other
 would leave the occupied space exactly what it was before and, where
 the space occupied is not increased by the juxtaposition, 
 they explain
 that some expulsion of air has made room for the incoming substance.
 They ask further, how a minor quantity of one substance can be
 spread out so as to interpenetrate a major quantity of another. In
 fact they have a multitude of arguments.
 
 </p><p>Those, on the other hand, that accept "complete transfusion,"
 might object that it does not require the reduction of the mixed
 things to fragments, a certain cleavage being sufficient: thus, for
 instance, sweat does not split up the body or even pierce 
 holes in it.
 And if it is answered that this may well be a special decree 
 of Nature
 to allow of the sweat exuding, there is the case of those 
 manufactured
 articles, slender but without puncture, in which we can see a liquid
 wetting them through and through so that it runs down from the upper
 to the under surface. How can this fact be explained, since both the
 liquid and the solid are bodily substances? Interpenetration without
 disintegration is difficult to conceive, and if there is such mutual
 disintegration the two must obviously destroy each other.
 
 </p><p>When they urge that often there is a mixing without augmentation
 their adversaries can counter at once with the exit of air.
 
 </p><p>When there is an increase in the space occupied, nothing refutes
 the explanation- however unsatisfying- that this is a necessary
 consequence of two bodies bringing to a common stock their magnitude
 equally with their other attributes: size is as permanent as 
 any other
 property; and, exactly as from the blending of qualities 
 there results
 a new form of thing, the combination of the two, so we find a new
 magnitude; the blending gives us a magnitude representing each of
 the two. But at this point the others will answer, "If you mean that
 substance lies side by side with substance and mass with mass, each
 carrying its quantum of magnitude, you are at one with us: if there
 were complete transfusion, one substance sinking its original
 magnitude in the other, we would have no longer the case of two
 lines joined end to end by their terminal points and thus 
 producing an
 increased extension; we would have line superimposed upon line with,
 therefore, no increase."
 
 </p><p>But a lesser quantity permeates the entire extent of a 
 larger; the
 smallest is sunk in the greatest; transfusion is exhibited
 unmistakably. In certain cases it is possible to pretend 
 that there is
 no total penetration but there are manifest examples leaving no room
 for the pretence. In what they say of the spreading out of 
 masses they
 cannot be thought very plausible; the extension would have to be
 considerable indeed in the case of a very small quantity [to be in
 true mixture with a very large mass]; for they do not 
 suggest any such
 extension by change as that of water into air.
