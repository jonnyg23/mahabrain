 <p>6. Now the Principle this stated, all good and beauty, and
 everlasting, is centred in The One, sprung from It, and pointed
 towards It, never straying from It, but ever holding about It and in
 It and living by Its law; and it is in this reference, as I judge,
 that Plato- finely, and by no means inadvertently but with profound
 intention- wrote those words of his, "Eternity stable in Unity"; he
 wishes to convey that Eternity is not merely something 
 circling on its
 traces into a final unity but has [instantaneous] Being about The
 One as the unchanging Life of the Authentic Existent. This is
 certainly what we have been seeking: this Principle, at rest within
 rest with the One, is Eternity; possessing this stable quality,
 being itself at once the absolute self-identical and none 
 the less the
 active manifestation of an unchanging Life set towards the Divine
 and dwelling within It, untrue, therefore, neither on the side of
 Being nor on the side of Life- this will be Eternity [the Real-Being
 we have sought].
 
 </p><p>Truly to be comports never lacking existence and never knowing
 variety in the mode of existence: Being is, therefore,
 self-identical throughout, and, therefore, again is one
 undistinguishable thing. Being can have no this and that; it 
 cannot be
 treated in terms of intervals, unfoldings, progression, extension;
 there is no grasping any first or last in it.
 
 </p><p>If, then, there is no first or last in this Principle, if
 existence is its most authentic possession and its very 
 self, and this
 in the sense that its existence is Essence or Life- then, once
 again, we meet here what we have been discussing, Eternity.
 
 </p><p>Observe that such words as "always," "never," "sometimes" must
 be taken as mere conveniences of exposition: thus "always- 
 used in the
 sense not of time but of incorruptibility and endlessly complete
 scope- might set up the false notion of stage and interval. We might
 perhaps prefer to speak of "Being," without any attribute; but since
 this term is applicable to Essence and some writers have 
 used the word
 "Essence" for things of process, we cannot convey our meaning to
 them without introducing some word carrying the notion of perdurance.
 
 </p><p>There is, of course, no difference between Being and Everlasting
 Being; just as there is none between a philosopher and a true
 philosopher: the attribute "true" came into use because there arose
 what masqueraded as philosophy; and for similar reasons
 "everlasting" was adjoined to "Being," and "Being" to "everlasting,"
 and we have [the tautology of] "Everlasting Being." We must take
 this "Everlasting" as expressing no more than Authentic Being: it is
 merely a partial expression of a potency which ignores all 
 interval or
 term and can look forward to nothing by way of addition to the All
 which it possesses. The Principle of which this is the statement
 will be the All-Existent, and, as being all, can have no failing or
 deficiency, cannot be at some one point complete and at some other
 lacking.
 
 </p><p>Things and Beings in the Time order- even when to all appearance
 complete, as a body is when fit to harbour a soul- are still bound
 to sequence; they are deficient to the extent of that thing, Time,
 which they need: let them have it, present to them and 
 running side by
 side with them, and they are by that very fact incomplete;
 completeness is attributed to them only by an accident of language.
 
 </p><p>But the conception of Eternity demands something which is in its
 nature complete without sequence; it is not satisfied by something
 measured out to any remoter time or even by something limitless,
 but, in its limitless reach, still having the progression of 
 futurity:
 it requires something immediately possessed of the due fullness of
 Being, something whose Being does not depend upon any quantity [such
 as instalments of time] but subsists before all quantity.
 
 </p><p>Itself having no quantity, it can have no contact with anything
 quantitative since its Life cannot be made a thing of fragments, in
 contradiction to the partlessness which is its character; it must be
 without parts in the Life as in the essence.
 
 </p><p>The phrase "He was good" [used by Plato of the Demiurge] 
 refers to
 the Idea of the All; and its very indefiniteness signifies the utter
 absense of relation to Time: so that even this Universe has had no
 temporal beginning; and if we speak of something "before" it, that
 is only in the sense of the Cause from which it takes its Eternal
 Existence. Plato used the word merely for the convenience of
 exposition, and immediately corrects it as inappropriate to the
 order vested with the Eternity he conceives and affirms.
