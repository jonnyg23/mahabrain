And I will tell out truly all our evil plight, that ye yourselves too may know it well.  When my father Thoas reigned over the citizens, then our folk starting from their homes used to plunder from their ships the dwellings of the Thracians who live opposite, and they brought back hither measureless booty and maidens too.  But the counsel of the baneful goddess Cypris was working out its accomplishment, who brought upon them soul destroying infatuation.  For they hated their lawful wives, and, yielding to their own mad folly, drove them from their homes; and they took to their beds the captives of their spear, cruel ones. Long in truth we endured it, if haply again, though late, they might change their purpose, but ever the bitter woe grew, twofold.  And the lawful children were being dishonoured in their halls, and a bastard race was rising.  And thus unmarried maidens and widowed mothers too wandered uncared for through the city; no father heeded his daughter ever so little even though he should see her done to death before his eyes at the hands of an insolent step-dame, nor did sons, as before, defend their mother against unseemly outrage; nor did brothers care at heart for their sister.  But in their homes, in the dance, in the assembly and the banquet all their thought was only for their captive maidens; until some god put desperate courage in our hearts no more to receive our lords on their return from Thrace within our towers so that they might either heed the right or might depart and begone elsewhither, they and their captives.  So they begged of us all the male children that were left in the city and went back to where even now they dwell on the snowy tilths of Thrace.  Do ye therefore stay and settle with us; and shouldst thou desire to dwell here, and this finds favour with thee, assuredly thou shalt have the prerogative of my father Thoas; and I deem that thou wilt not scorn our land at all; for it is deepsoiled beyond all other islands that lie in the Aegaean sea.  But come now, return to the ship and relate my words to thy comrades, and stay not outside our city."

 812   μητέρες ἂμ πτολίεθρον ἀτημελέες ἀλάληντο.
 <br>
 813   οὐδὲ πατὴρ ὀλίγον περ ἑῆς ἀλέγιζε θυγατρός,
 <br>
 814   εἰ καὶ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖσι δαϊζομένην ὁρόῳτο
 <br>
 815   μητρυιῆς ὑπὸ χερσὶν ἀτασθάλου: οὐδ' ἀπὸ μητρὸς
 <br>
 816   λώβην, ὡς τὸ πάροιθεν, ἀεικέα παῖδες ἄμυνον:
 <br>
 817   οὐδὲ κασιγνήτοισι κασιγνήτη μελε θυμῷ.
 <br>
 818   ἀλλ' οἶαι κοῦραι ληίτιδες ἔν τε δόμοισιν
 <br>
 819   ἔν τε χοροῖς ἀγορῇ τε καὶ εἰλαπίνῃσι μέλοντο:
 <br>
 820   εἰσόκε τις θεὸς ἄμμιν ὑπέρβιον ἔμβαλε θάρσος,
 <br>
 821   ἂψ ἀναερχομένους Θρῃκῶν ἄπο μηκέτι πύργοις
 <br>
 822   δέχθαι, ἵν' ἢ φρονέοιεν ἅπερ θέμις, ἠέ πῃ ἄλλῃ
 <br>
 823   αὐταῖς ληιάδεσσιν ἀφορμηθέντες ἵκοιντο.
 <br>
 824   οἱ δ' ἄρα θεσσάμενοι παίδων γένος, ὅσσον ἔλειπτο
 <br>
 825   ἄρσεν ἀνὰ πτολίεθρον, ἔβαν πάλιν, ἔνθ' ἔτι νῦν περ
 <br>
 826   Θρηικίης ἄροσιν χιονώδεα ναιετάουσιν.
 <br>
 827   τῶ ὑμεῖς στρωφᾶσθ' ἐπιδήμιοι: εἰ δέ κεν αὖθι
 <br>
 828   ναιετάειν ἐθέλοις, καί τοι ἅδοι, ἦ τ' ἂν ἔπειτα
 <br>
 829   πατρὸς ἐμεῖο Θόαντος ἔχοις γέρας: οὐδέ τί σ' οἴω
 <br>
 830   γαῖαν ὀνόσσεσθαι: περὶ γὰρ βαθυλήιος ἄλλων
 <br>
 831   νήσων, Αἰγαίῃ ὅσαι εἰν ἁλὶ ναιετάουσιν.
 <br>
 832   ἀλλ' ἄγε νῦν ἐπὶ νῆα κιὼν ἑτάροισιν ἐνίσπες
 <br>
 833   μύθους ἡμετέρους, μηδ' ἔκτοθι μίμνε πόληος."
