But straightway fearful dreams, deceitful, such as trouble one in grief, assailed her.  And she thought that the stranger had taken on him the contest, not because he longed to win the ram's fleece, and that he had not come on that account to Aeetes' city, but to lead her away, his wedded wife, to his own home; and she dreamed that herself contended with the oxen and wrought the task with exceeding ease; and that her own parents set at naught their promise, for it was not the maiden they had challenged to yoke the oxen but the stranger himself; from that arose a contention of doubtful issue between her father and the strangers; and both laid the decision upon her, to be as she should direct in her mind.  But she suddenly, neglecting her parents, chose the stranger.  And measureless anguish seized them and they shouted out in their wrath; and with the cry sleep released its hold upon her.  Quivering with fear she started up, and stared round the  walls of her chamber, and with difficulty did she gather her spirit within her as before, and lifted her voice aloud:

My heart is trembling for the stranger.  Let him woo some Achaean girl far away among his own folk; let maidenhood be mine and the home of my parents.  Yet, taking to myself a reckless heart, I will no more keep aloof but will make trial of my sister to see if she will entreat me to aid in the contest, through grief for her own sons; this would quench the bitter pain in my heart."

And for long she stayed there at the entrance of her chamber, held back by shame; and she turned back once more; and again she came forth from within, and again stole back; and idly did her feet bear her this way and that; yea, as oft as she went straight on, shame held her within the chamber, and though held back by shame, bold desire kept urging her on.  Thrice she made the attempt and thrice she checked herself, the fourth time she fell on her bed face downward, writhing in pain.  And as when a bride in her chamber bewails her youthful husband, to whom her brothers and parents have given her, nor yet does she hold converse with all her attendants for shame and for thinking of him; but she sits apart in her grief; and some doom has destroyed him, before they have had pleasure of each other's charms; and she with heart on fire silently weeps, beholding her widowed couch, in fear lest the women should mock and revile her; like to her did Medea lament.  And suddenly as she was in the midst of her tears, one of the handmaids came forth and noticed her, one who was her youthful attendant; and straightway she told Chalciope, who sat in the midst of her sons devising how to win over her sister.  And when Chalciope heard the strange tale from the handmaid, not even so did she disregard it.  And she rushed in dismay from her chamber right on to the chamber where the maiden lay in her anguish, having torn her cheeks on each side; and when Chalciope saw her eyes all dimmed with tears, she thus addressed her:
