   <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE SEA-GODS</h1>  <h3 align="center">VII</h3>

 <p><i>S</i>. Zephyr, is it true about Zeus and the heifer that Hermes is convoying across the sea to Egypt?--that he fell in love with it?</p>  
 <p><i>W</i>. Certainly. She was not a heifer then, though, but a daughter of the river Inachus. Hera made her what she is now; Zeus was so deep in love that Hera was jealous.</p>  
 <p><i>S</i>. And is he still in love, now that she is a cow?</p>  
 <p><i>W</i>. Oh, yes; that is why he has sent her to Egypt, and told us not to stir up the sea till she has swum across; she is to be delivered there of her child, and both of them are to be Gods.</p>  
 <p><i>S</i>. The heifer a God?</p>  
 <p><i>W</i>. Yes, I tell you. And Hermes said she was to be the patroness of sailors and our mistress, and send out or confine any of us that she chooses.</p>

 <p><i>S</i>. So we must regard ourselves as her servants at once?</p>  
 <p><i>W</i>. Why, yes; she will be the kinder if we do. Ah, she has got across and landed. Do you see? she does not go on four legs now; Hermes has made her stand erect, and turned her back into a beautiful woman.</p>  
 <p><i>S</i>. This is most remarkable, Zephyr; no horns, no tail, no cloven hoofs; instead, a lovely maid. But what is the matter with Hermes? he has changed his handsome face into a dog's.</p>  
 <p><i>W</i>. We had better not meddle; he knows his own business best.</p>
