 <p><i>Her</i>. Mother, I am the most miserable god in Heaven.</p>  
 <p><i>Ma</i>. Don't say such things, child.</p>  
 <p><i>Her</i>. Am I to do all the work of Heaven with my own hands, to be hurried from one piece of drudgery to another, and never say a word?

I am half dead with it all. Mortal slaves are better off than I am: they have the chance of being sold to a new master; I wish I had the same!</p>  
 <p><i>Ma</i>. Come, come, child. You must do as your father bids you, like a good boy. Run along now to Argos and Boeotia; don't loiter, or you will get a whipping. Lovers are apt to be hasty.</p>
