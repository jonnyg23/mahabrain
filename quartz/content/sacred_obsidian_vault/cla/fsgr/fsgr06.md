 <h3>THE OLYMPIAN CONQUEST</h3>
 
 
 <h4>I. <i>Origin of the Olympians</i></h4>
 
 <p>The historian of early Greece must find himself often on the watch for a
 particular cardinal moment, generally impossible to date in time and
 sometimes hard even to define in terms of development, when the clear
 outline that we call Classical Greece begins to take shape out of the
 mist. It is the moment when, as Herodotus puts it, 'the Hellenic race
 was marked off from the barbarian, as more intelligent and more
 emancipated from silly nonsense'.<a name="an_fr_39_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_39_1">39_1</a> In the eighth century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, for
 instance, so far as our remains indicate, there cannot have been much to
 show that the inhabitants of Attica and Boeotia and the Peloponnese were
 markedly superior to those of, say, Lycia or Phrygia, or even Epirus. By
 the middle of the fifth century the difference is enormous. On the one
 side is Hellas, on the other the motley tribes of 'barbaroi'.</p>
 
 <p>When the change does come and is consciously felt we may notice a
 significant fact about it. It does not announce itself as what it was, a
 new thing in the <a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></a> world. It professes to be a revival, or rather an
 emphatic realization, of something very old. The new spirit of classical
 Greece, with all its humanity, its intellectual life, its genius for
 poetry and art, describes itself merely as being 'Hellenic'—like the
 Hellenes. And the Hellenes were simply, as far as we can make out, much
 the same as the Achaioi, one of the many tribes of predatory Northmen
 who had swept down on the Aegean kingdoms in the dawn of Greek
 history.<a name="an_fr_40_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_40_1">40_1</a></p>
 
 <p>This claim of a new thing to be old is, in varying degrees, a common
 characteristic of great movements. The Reformation professed to be a
 return to the Bible, the Evangelical movement in England a return to the
 Gospels, the High Church movement a return to the early Church. A large
 element even in the French Revolution, the greatest of all breaches with
 the past, had for its ideal a return to Roman republican virtue or to
 the simplicity of the natural man.<a name="an_fr_40_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_40_2">40_2</a> I noticed quite lately a speech
 of an American Progressive leader claiming that his principles were
 simply those of Abraham Lincoln. The tendency is due in part to the
 almost insuperable difficulty of really inventing a new word to denote a
 new thing. It is so much easier to take an existing word, especially a
 famous word with fine associations, and twist it into a new sense. In
 part, no doubt, it comes from mankind's natural love <a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></a> for these old
 associations, and the fact that nearly all people who are worth much
 have in them some instinctive spirit of reverence. Even when striking
 out a new path they like to feel that they are following at least the
 spirit of one greater than themselves.</p>
 
 <p>The Hellenism of the sixth and fifth centuries was to a great extent
 what the Hellenism of later ages was almost entirely, an ideal and a
 standard of culture. The classical Greeks were not, strictly speaking,
 pure Hellenes by blood. Herodotus, and Thucydides<a name="an_fr_41_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_41_1">41_1</a> are quite clear
 about that. The original Hellenes were a particular conquering tribe of
 great prestige, which attracted the surrounding tribes to follow it,
 imitate it, and call themselves by its name. The Spartans were, to
 Herodotus, Hellenic; the Athenians on the other hand were not. They were
 Pelasgian, but by a certain time 'changed into Hellenes and learnt the
 language'. In historical times we cannot really find any tribe of pure
 Hellenes in existence, though the name clings faintly to a particular
 district, not otherwise important, in South Thessaly. Had there been any
 undoubted Hellenes with incontrovertible pedigrees still going, very
 likely the ideal would have taken quite a different name. But where no
 one's ancestry would bear much inspection, the only way to show you were
 a true Hellene was to behave as such: that is, to approximate to some
 constantly rising ideal of what the true Hellene should be. In all
 probability if a Greek of the fifth century, like Aeschylus or even
 Pindar, had met a group of the real Hellenes or Achaioi of the
 Migrations, he would have set them down as so many obvious and flaming
 barbarians.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a> </p><p>We do not know whether the old Hellenes had any general word to denote
 the surrounding peoples ('Pelasgians and divers other barbarous
 tribes'<a name="an_fr_42_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_42_1">42_1</a>) whom they conquered or accepted as allies.<a name="an_fr_42_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_42_2">42_2</a> In any
 case by the time of the Persian Wars (say 500 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) all these tribes
 together considered themselves Hellenized, bore the name of 'Hellenes',
 and formed a kind of unity against hordes of 'barbaroi' surrounding them
 on every side and threatening them especially from the east.</p>
 
 <p>Let us consider for a moment the dates. In political history this
 self-realization of the Greek tribes as Hellenes against barbarians
 seems to have been first felt in the Ionian settlements on the coast of
 Asia Minor, where the 'sons of Javan' (Yawan = <ins class="greek" title="Iaôn">Ἰάων</ins>) clashed as
 invaders against the native Hittite and Semite. It was emphasized by a
 similar clash in the further colonies in Pontus and in the West. If we
 wish for a central moment as representing this self-realization of
 Greece, I should be inclined to find it in the reign of Pisistratus
 (560-527 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) when that monarch made, as it were, the first sketch of
 an Athenian empire based on alliances and took over to Athens the
 leadership of the Ionian race.</p>
 
 <p>In literature the decisive moment is clear. It came when, in Mr.
 Mackail's phrase, 'Homer came to Hellas'.<a name="an_fr_42_3"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_42_3">42_3</a> The date is apparently
 the same, and the <a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></a> influences at work are the same. It seems to have
 been under Pisistratus that the Homeric Poems, in some form or other,
 came from Ionia to be recited in a fixed order at the Panathenaic
 Festival, and to find a canonical form and a central home in Athens till
 the end of the classical period. Athens is the centre from which Homeric
 influence radiates over the mainland of Greece. Its effect upon
 literature was of course enormous. It can be traced in various ways. By
 the content of the literature, which now begins to be filled with the
 heroic saga. By a change of style which emerges in, say, Pindar and
 Aeschylus when compared with what we know of Corinna or Thespis. More
 objectively and definitely it can be traced in a remarkable change of
 dialect. The old Attic poets, like Solon, were comparatively little
 affected by the epic influence; the later elegists, like Ion, Euenus,
 and Plato, were steeped in it.<a name="an_fr_43_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_43_1">43_1</a></p>
 
 <p>In religion the cardinal moment is the same. It consists in the coming
 of Homer's 'Olympian Gods', and that is to be the subject of the present
 essay. I am not, of course, going to describe the cults and characters
 of the various Olympians. For that inquiry the reader will naturally go
 to the five learned volumes <a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></a> of my colleague, Dr. Farnell. I wish merely
 to face certain difficult and, I think, hitherto unsolved problems
 affecting the meaning and origin and history of the Olympians as a
 whole.</p>
 
 <p>Herodotus in a famous passage tells us that Homer and Hesiod 'made the
 generations of the Gods for the Greeks and gave them their names and
 distinguished their offices and crafts and portrayed their shapes' (2.
 53). The date of this wholesale proceeding was, he thinks, perhaps as
 much as four hundred years before his own day (<i>c.</i> 430 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) but not
 more. Before that time the Pelasgians—i. e. the primitive inhabitants
 of Greece as opposed to the Hellenes—were worshipping gods in
 indefinite numbers, with no particular names; many of them appear as
 figures carved emblematically with sex-emblems to represent the powers
 of fertility and generation, like the Athenian 'Herms'. The whole
 account bristles with points for discussion, but in general it suits
 very well with the picture drawn in the first of these essays, with its
 Earth Maidens and Mothers and its projected Kouroi. The background is
 the pre-Hellenic 'Urdummheit'; the new shape impressed upon it is the
 great anthropomorphic Olympian family, as defined in the Homeric epos
 and, more timidly, in Hesiod. But of Hesiod we must speak later.</p>
 
 <hr style="width: 45%;">
 
 <p>Now who are these Olympian Gods and where do they come from? Homer did
 not 'make' them out of nothing. But the understanding of them is beset
 with problems.</p>
 
 <p>In the first place why are they called 'Olympian'? Are they the Gods of
 Mount Olympus, the old sacred <a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></a> mountain of Homer's Achaioi, or do they
 belong to the great sanctuary of Olympia in which Zeus, the lord of the
 Olympians, had his greatest festival? The two are at opposite ends of
 Greece, Olympus in North Thessaly in the north-east, Olympia in Elis in
 the south-west. From which do the Olympians come? On the one hand it is
 clear in Homer that they dwell on Mount Olympus; they have 'Olympian
 houses' beyond human sight, on the top of the sacred mountain, which in
 the <i>Odyssey</i> is identified with heaven. On the other hand, when
 Pisistratus introduced the worship of Olympian Zeus on a great scale
 into Athens and built the Olympieum, he seems to have brought him
 straight from Olympia in Elis. For he introduced the special Elean
 complex of gods, Zeus, Rhea, Kronos, and Gê Olympia.<a name="an_fr_45_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_45_1">45_1</a></p>
 
 <p>Fortunately this puzzle can be solved. The Olympians belong to both
 places. It is merely a case of tribal migration. History, confirmed by
 the study of the Greek dialects, seems to show that these northern
 Achaioi came down across central Greece and the Gulf of Corinth and
 settled in Elis.<a name="an_fr_45_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_45_2">45_2</a> They brought with them their Zeus, who was
 already called 'Olympian', and established him as superior to the
 existing god, Kronos. The Games became Olympian and the sanctuary by
 which they were performed 'Olympia'.<a name="an_fr_45_3"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_45_3">45_3</a></p>
 
 <p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="green">p. 46</font></a> </p><p>As soon as this point is clear, we understand also why there is more
 than one Mount Olympus. We can all think of two, one in Thessaly and one
 across the Aegean in Mysia. But there are many more; some twenty-odd, if
 I mistake not, in the whole Greek region. It is a pre-Greek word applied
 to mountains; and it seems clear that the 'Olympian' gods, wherever
 their worshippers moved, tended to dwell in the highest mountain in the
 neighbourhood, and the mountain thereby became Olympus.</p>
 
 <p>The name, then, explains itself. The Olympians are the mountain gods of
 the old invading Northmen, the chieftains and princes, each with his
 <i>comitatus</i> or loose following of retainers and minor chieftains, who
 broke in upon the ordered splendours of the Aegean palaces and, still
 more important, on the ordered simplicity of tribal life in the
 pre-Hellenic villages of the mainland. Now, it is a canon of religious
 study that all gods reflect the social state, past or present, of their
 worshippers. From this point of view what appearance do the Olympians of
 Homer make? What are they there for? What do they do, and what are their
 relations one to another?</p>
 
 <p>The gods of most nations claim to have created the world. The Olympians
 make no such claim. The most they ever did was to conquer it. Zeus and
 his <i>comitatus</i> conquered Cronos and his; conquered and expelled
 them—sent them migrating beyond the horizon, Heaven knows where. Zeus
 took the chief dominion and remained a permanent overlord, but he
 <a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></a> apportioned large kingdoms to his brothers Hades and Poseidon, and
 confirmed various of his children and followers in lesser fiefs. Apollo
 went off on his own adventure and conquered Delphi. Athena conquered the
 Giants. She gained Athens by a conquest over Poseidon, a point of which
 we will speak later.</p>
 
 <p>And when they have conquered their kingdoms, what do they do? Do they
 attend to the government? Do they promote agriculture? Do they practise
 trades and industries? Not a bit of it. Why should they do any honest
 work? They find it easier to live on the revenues and blast with
 thunderbolts the people who do not pay. They are conquering chieftains,
 royal buccaneers. They fight, and feast, and play, and make music; they
 drink deep, and roar with laughter at the lame smith who waits on them.
 They are never afraid, except of their own king. They never tell lies,
 except in love and war.</p>
 
 <p>A few deductions may be from this statement, but they do not affect its
 main significance. One god, you may say, Hephaistos, is definitely a
 craftsman. Yes: a smith, a maker of weapons. The one craftsman that a
 gang of warriors needed to have by them; and they preferred him lame, so
 that he should not run away. Again, Apollo herded for hire the cattle of
 Admetus; Apollo and Poseidon built the walls of Troy for Laomedon.
 Certainly in such stories we have an intrusion of other elements; but in
 any case the work done is not habitual work, it is a special punishment.
 Again, it is not denied that the Olympians have some effect on
 agriculture and on justice: they destroy the harvests of those who
 offend them, they punish oath-breakers and the like. Even in the Heroic
 <a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></a> Age itself—if we may adopt Mr. Chadwick's convenient title for the Age
 of the Migrations—chieftains and gods probably retained some vestiges
 of the functions they had exercised in more normal and settled times;
 and besides we must always realize that, in these inquiries, we never
 meet a simple and uniform figure. We must further remember that these
 gods are not real people with a real character. They never existed. They
 are only concepts, exceedingly confused cloudy and changing concepts, in
 the minds of thousands of diverse worshippers and non-worshippers. They
 change every time they are thought of, as a word changes every time it
 is pronounced. Even in the height of the Achaean wars the concept of any
 one god would be mixed up with traditions and associations drawn from
 the surrounding populations and their gods; and by the time they come
 down to us in Homer and our other early literature, they have passed
 through the minds of many different ages and places, especially Ionia
 and Athens.</p>
 
 <p>The Olympians as described in our text of Homer, or as described in the
 Athenian recitations of the sixth century, are <i>mutatis mutandis</i>
 related to the Olympians of the Heroic Age much as the Hellenes of the
 sixth century are to the Hellenes of the Heroic Age. I say '<i>mutatis
 mutandis</i>', because the historical development of a group of imaginary
 concepts shrined in tradition and romance can never be quite the same as
 that of the people who conceive them. The realm of fiction is apt both
 to leap in front and to lag in the rear of the march of real life.
 Romance will hug picturesque darknesses as well as invent perfections.
 But the gods of Homer, as we have them, certainly seem to show <a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></a> traces
 of the process through which they have passed: of an origin among the
 old conquering Achaioi, a development in the Ionian epic schools, and a
 final home in Athens.<a name="an_fr_49_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_49_1">49_1</a></p>
 
 <p>For example, what gods are chiefly prominent in Homer? In the <i>Iliad</i>
 certainly three, Zeus, Apollo, and Athena, and much the same would hold
 for the <i>Odyssey</i>. Next to them in importance will be Poseidon, Hera,
 and Hermes.</p>
 
 <p>Zeus stands somewhat apart. He is one of the very few gods with
 recognizable and undoubted Indo-germanic names, Djëus, the well-attested
 sky- and rain-god of the Aryan race. He is Achaian; he is 'Hellanios',
 the god worshipped by all Hellenes. He is also, curiously enough,
 Pelasgian, and Mr. A. B. Cook<a name="an_fr_49_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_49_2">49_2</a> can explain to us the seeming
 contradiction. But the Northern elements in the conception of Zeus have
 on the whole triumphed over any Pelasgian or Aegean sky-god with which
 they may have mingled, and Zeus, in spite of his dark hair, may be
 mainly treated as the patriarchal god of the invading Northmen, passing
 from the Upper Danube down by his three great sanctuaries, Dodona,
 Olympus, and Olympia. He had <a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></a> an extraordinary power of ousting or
 absorbing the various objects of aboriginal worship which he found in
 his path. The story of Meilichios above (<a href="fsgr05.htm#page_14">14</a>) is a common one. Of
 course, we must not suppose that the Zeus of the actual Achaioi was a
 figure quite like the Zeus of Pheidias or of Homer. There has been a
 good deal of expurgation in the Homeric Zeus,<a name="an_fr_50_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_50_1">50_1</a> as Mr. Cook clearly
 shows. The Counsellor and Cloud-compeller of classical Athens was the
 wizard and rainmaker of earlier times; and the All-Father surprises us
 in Thera and Crete by appearing both as a babe and as a Kouros in spring
 dances and initiation rituals.<a name="an_fr_50_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_50_2">50_2</a> It is a long way from these
 conceptions to the Zeus of Aeschylus, a figure as sublime as the Jehovah
 of Job; but the lineage seems clear.</p>
 
 <p>Zeus is the Achaean Sky-god. His son Phoebus Apollo is of more complex
 make. On one side he is clearly a Northman. He has connexions with the
 Hyperboreans.<a name="an_fr_50_3"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_50_3">50_3</a> He has a 'sacred road' leading far into the North,
 along which offerings are sent back from shrine to shrine beyond the
 bounds of Greek knowledge. Such 'sacred roads' are normally the roads by
 which the God himself has travelled; the offerings are sent back from
 the new sanctuary to the old. On the other side Apollo reaches back to
 an Aegean matriarchal Kouros. His home is Delos, where he has a mother,
 Leto, but no very visible father. He leads the ships of his islanders,
 sometimes in the form of a dolphin. He is no 'Hellene'. In the fighting
 <a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a> at Troy he is against the Achaioi: he destroys the Greek host, he
 champions Hector, he even slays Achilles. In the Homeric hymn to Apollo
 we read that when the great archer draws near to Olympus all the gods
 tremble and start from their seats; Leto alone, and of course Zeus, hold
 their ground.<a name="an_fr_51_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_51_1">51_1</a> What this god's original name was at Delos we cannot
 be sure: he has very many names and 'epithets'. But he early became
 identified with a similar god at Delphi and adopted his name, 'Apollôn',
 or, in the Delphic and Dorian form, 'Apellôn'—presumably the Kouros
 projected from the Dorian gatherings called '<i>apellae</i>'.<a name="an_fr_51_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_51_2">51_2</a> As
 Phoibos he is a sun-god, and from classical times onward we often find
 him definitely identified with the Sun, a distinction which came easily
 to a Kouros.</p>
 
 <p>In any case, and this is the important point, he is at Delos the chief
 god of the Ionians. The Ionians are defined by Herodotus as those tribes
 and cities who were sprung from Athens and kept the Apaturia. They
 recognized Delos as their holy place and worshipped Apollo Patrôos as
 their ancestor.<a name="an_fr_51_3"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_51_3">51_3</a> The Ionian Homer has naturally brought us the
 Ionian god; and, significantly enough, though the tradition makes him an
 enemy of the Greeks, and the poets have to accept the tradition, there
 is no tendency to crab or belittle him. He is the most splendid and
 awful of Homer's Olympians.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></a> </p><p>The case of Pallas Athena is even simpler, though it leads to a
 somewhat surprising result. What Apollo is to Ionia that, and more,
 Athena is to Athens. There are doubtless foreign elements in Athena,
 some Cretan and Ionian, some Northern.<a name="an_fr_52_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_52_1">52_1</a> But her whole appearance in
 history and literature tells the same story as her name. Athens is her
 city and she is the goddess of Athens, the Athena or Athenaia Korê. In
 Athens she can be simply 'Parthenos', the Maiden; elsewhere she is the
 'Attic' or 'Athenian Maiden'. As Glaucopis she is identified or
 associated with the Owl that was the sacred bird of Athens. As Pallas
 she seems to be a Thunder-maiden, a sort of Keraunia or bride of
 Keraunos. A Palladion consists of two thunder-shields, set one above the
 other like a figure 8, and we can trace in art-types the development of
 this 8 into a human figure. It seems clear that the old Achaioi cannot
 have called their warrior-maiden, daughter of Zeus, by the name Athena
 or Athenaia. The Athenian goddess must have come in from Athenian
 influence, and it is strange to find how deep into the heart of the
 poems that influence must have reached. If we try to conjecture whose
 place it is that Athena has taken, it is worth remarking that her
 regular epithet, 'daughter of Zeus', belongs in Sanskrit to the
 Dawn-goddess, Eôs.<a name="an_fr_52_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_52_2">52_2</a> The transition might be helped by some touches
 of the Dawn-goddess that seem to linger about Athena in myth. The rising
 Sun stayed his horses while Athena was born from <a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="green">p. 53</font></a> the head of Zeus. Also
 she was born amid a snowstorm of gold. And Eôs, on the other hand, is,
 like Athena, sometimes the daughter of the Giant Pallas.<a name="an_fr_53_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_53_1">53_1</a></p>
 
 <p>Our three chief Olympians, then, explain themselves very easily. A body
 of poetry and tradition, in its origin dating from the Achaioi of the
 Migrations, growing for centuries in the hands of Ionian bards, and
 reaching its culminating form at Athens, has prominent in it the Achaian
 Zeus, the Ionian Apollo, the Athenian Korê—the same Korê who descended
 in person to restore the exiled Pisistratus to his throne.<a name="an_fr_53_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_53_2">53_2</a></p>
 
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="green">p. 54</font></a> </p><p>We need only throw a glance in passing at a few of the other Olympians.
 Why, for instance, should Poseidon be so prominent? In origin he is a
 puzzling figure. Besides the Achaean Earth-shaking brother of Zeus in
 Thessaly there seems to be some Pelasgian or Aegean god present in him.
 He is closely connected with Libya; he brings the horse from
 there.<a name="an_fr_54_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_54_1">54_1</a> At times he exists in order to be defeated; defeated in
 Athens by Athena, in Naxos by Dionysus, in Aegina by Zeus, in Argos by
 Hera, in Acrocorinth by Helios though he continues to hold the Isthmus.
 In Trozen he shares a temple on more or less equal terms with
 Athena.<a name="an_fr_54_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_54_2">54_2</a> Even in Troy he is defeated and cast out from the walls
 his own hands had built.<a name="an_fr_54_3"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_54_3">54_3</a> These problems we need not for the
 present face. By the time that concerns us most the Earth-Shaker is a
 sea-god, specially important to the sea-peoples of Athens and Ionia. He
 is the father of Neleus, the ancestor of the Ionian kings. His temple at
 Cape Mykale is the scene of the Panionia, and second only to Delos as a
 religious centre of the Ionian tribes. He has intimate relations with
 Attica too. Besides the ancient contest with Athena for the possession
 of the land, he appears <a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="green">p. 55</font></a> as the father of Theseus, the chief Athenian
 hero. He is merged in other Attic heroes, like Aigeus and Erechtheus. He
 is the special patron of the Athenian knights. Thus his prominence in
 Homer is very natural.</p>
 
 <p>What of Hermes? His history deserves a long monograph to itself; it is
 so exceptionally instructive. Originally, outside Homer, Hermes was
 simply an old upright stone, a pillar furnished with the regular
 Pelasgian sex-symbol of procreation. Set up over a tomb he is the power
 that generates new lives, or, in the ancient conception, brings the
 souls back to be born again. He is the Guide of the Dead, the
 Psychopompos, the divine Herald between the two worlds. If you have a
 message for the dead, you speak it to the Herm at the grave. This notion
 of Hermes as herald may have been helped by his use as a
 boundary-stone—the Latin <i>Terminus</i>. Your boundary-stone is your
 representative, the deliverer of your message, to the hostile neighbour
 or alien. If you wish to parley with him, you advance up to your
 boundary-stone. If you go, as a Herald, peacefully, into his territory,
 you place yourself under the protection of the same sacred stone, the
 last sign that remains of your own safe country. If you are killed or
 wronged, it is he, the immovable Watcher, who will avenge you.</p>
 
 <p>Now this phallic stone post was quite unsuitable to Homer. It was not
 decent; it was not quite human; and every personage in Homer has to be
 both. In the <i>Iliad</i> Hermes is simply removed, and a beautiful creation
 or tradition, Iris, the rainbow-goddess, takes his place as the
 messenger from heaven to earth. In the <i>Odyssey</i> he is admitted, but so
 changed and castigated that no one would recognize the old Herm <a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></a> in the
 beautiful and gracious youth who performs the gods' messages. I can only
 detect in his language one possible trace of his old Pelasgian
 character.<a name="an_fr_56_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_56_1">56_1</a></p>
 
 <p>Pausanias knew who worked the transformation. In speaking of Hermes
 among the other 'Workers', who were 'pillars in square form', he says,
 'As to Hermes, the poems of Homer have given currency to the report that
 he is a servant of Zeus and leads down the spirits of the departed to
 Hades'.<a name="an_fr_56_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_56_2">56_2</a> In the magic papyri Hermes returns to something of his old
 functions; he is scarcely to be distinguished from the Agathos Daimon.
 But thanks to Homer he is purified of his old phallicism.</p>
 
 <p>Hera, too, the wife of Zeus, seems to have a curious past behind her.
 She has certainly ousted the original wife, Dione, whose worship
 continued unchallenged in far Dodona, from times before Zeus descended
 upon Greek lands. When he invaded Thessaly he seems to have left Dione
 behind and wedded the Queen of the conquered territory. Hera's permanent
 epithet is 'Argeia', 'Argive'. She is the Argive Korê or Year-Maiden, as
 Athena is the Attic, Cypris the Cyprian. But Argos in Homer denotes two
 different places, a watered plain in the Peloponnese and a watered plain
 in Thessaly. Hera was certainly the chief goddess of Peloponnesian Argos
 in historic times, and had brought her consort Herakles<a name="an_fr_56_3"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_56_3">56_3</a> along with
 her, but at one time she seems to have belonged to the Thessalian Argos.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></a> </p><p>She helped Thessalian Jason to launch the ship <i>Argo</i>, and they
 launched it from Thessalian Pagasae. In the Argonautica she is a
 beautiful figure, gracious and strong, the lovely patroness of the young
 hero. No element of strife is haunting her. But in the <i>Iliad</i> for some
 reason she is unpopular. She is a shrew, a scold, and a jealous wife.
 Why? Miss Harrison suggests that the quarrel with Zeus dates from the
 time of the invasion, when he was the conquering alien and she the
 native queen of the land.<a name="an_fr_57_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_57_1">57_1</a> It may be, too, that the Ionian poets
 who respected their own Apollo and Athena and Poseidon, regarded Hera as
 representing some race or tribe that they disliked. A goddess of Dorian
 Argos might be as disagreeable as a Dorian. It seems to be for some
 reason like this that Aphrodite, identified with Cyprus or some centre
 among Oriental barbarians, is handled with so much disrespect; that
 Ares, the Thracian Kouros, a Sun-god and War-god, is treated as a mere
 bully and coward and general pest.<a name="an_fr_57_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_57_2">57_2</a></p>
 
 <p>There is not much faith in these gods, as they appear to us in the
 Homeric Poems, and not much respect, except perhaps for Apollo and
 Athena and Poseidon. The buccaneer kings of the Heroic Age, cut loose
 from all local and tribal pieties, intent only on personal gain and
 glory, were not the people to build up a powerful religious faith. They
 left that, as they left agriculture and handiwork, to the nameless
 common folk.<a name="an_fr_57_3"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_57_3">57_3</a> And <a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></a> it was not likely that the bards of cultivated
 and scientific Ionia should waste much religious emotion on a system
 which was clearly meant more for romance than for the guiding of life.</p>
 
 <p>Yet the power of romance is great. In the memory of Greece the kings and
 gods of the Heroic Age were transfigured. What had been really an age of
 buccaneering violence became in memory an age of chivalry and splendid
 adventure. The traits that were at all tolerable were idealized; those
 that were intolerable were either expurgated, or, if that was
 impossible, were mysticized and explained away. And the savage old
 Olympians became to Athens and the mainland of Greece from the sixth
 century onward emblems of high humanity and religious reform.</p>
 
 
 <h4>II. <i>The Religious Value of the Olympians</i></h4>
 
 <p>Now to some people this statement may seem a wilful paradox, yet I
 believe it to be true. The Olympian religion, radiating from Homer at
 the Panathenaea, produced what I will venture to call exactly a
 religious reformation. Let us consider how, with all its flaws and
 falsehoods, it was fitted to attempt such a work.</p>
 
 <p>In the first place the Poems represent an Achaian tradition, the
 tradition of a Northern conquering race, organized on a patriarchal
 monogamous system vehemently distinct from the matrilinear customs of
 the Aegean or Hittite races, with their polygamy and polyandry, their
 agricultural rites, their sex-emblems and fertility goddesses. Contrast
 for a moment the sort of sexless Valkyrie who appears in the <i>Iliad</i>
 under the name of Athena with the Korê of Ephesus, strangely called
 Artemis, a shapeless fertility figure, <a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></a> covered with innumerable
 breasts. That suggests the contrast that I mean.</p>
 
 <p>Secondly, the poems are by tradition aristocratic; they are the
 literature of chieftains, alien to low popular superstition. True, the
 poems as we have them are not Court poems. That error ought not to be so
 often repeated. As we have them they are poems recited at a Panegyris,
 or public festival. But they go back in ultimate origin to something
 like lays sung in a royal hall. And the contrast between the Homeric
 gods and the gods found outside Homer is well compared by Mr.
 Chadwick<a name="an_fr_59_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_59_1">59_1</a> to the difference between the gods of the Edda and the
 historical traces of religion outside the Edda. The gods who feast with
 Odin in Asgard, forming an organized community or <i>comitatus</i>, seem to
 be the gods of the kings, distinct from the gods of the peasants,
 cleaner and more warlike and lordlier, though in actual religious
 quality much less vital.</p>
 
 <p>Thirdly, the poems in their main stages are Ionian, and Ionia was for
 many reasons calculated to lead the forward movement against the
 'Urdummheit'. For one thing, Ionia reinforced the old Heroic tradition,
 in having much the same inward freedom. The Ionians are the descendants
 of those who fled from the invaders across the sea, leaving their homes,
 tribes, and tribal traditions. Wilamowitz has well remarked how the
 imagination of the Greek mainland is dominated by the gigantic
 sepulchres of unknown kings, which the fugitives to Asia had left behind
 them and half forgotten.<a name="an_fr_59_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_59_2">59_2</a></p>
 
 <p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></a> </p><p>Again, when the Ionians settled on the Asiatic coasts they were no
 doubt to some extent influenced, but they were far more repelled by the
 barbaric tribes of the interior. They became conscious, as we have said,
 of something that was Hellenic, as distinct from something else that was
 barbaric, and the Hellenic part of them vehemently rejected what struck
 them as superstitious, cruel, or unclean. And lastly, we must remember
 that Ionia was, before the rise of Athens, not only the most imaginative
 and intellectual part of Greece, but by far the most advanced in
 knowledge and culture. The Homeric religion is a step in the
 self-realization of Greece, and such self-realization naturally took its
 rise in Ionia.</p>
 
 <p>Granted, then, that Homer was calculated to produce a kind of religious
 reformation in Greece, what kind of reformation was it? We are again
 reminded of St. Paul. It was a move away from the 'beggarly elements'
 towards some imagined person behind them. The world was conceived as
 neither quite without external governance, nor as merely subject to the
 incursions of <i>mana</i> snakes and bulls and thunder-stones and monsters,
 but as governed by an organized body of personal and reasoning rulers,
 wise and bountiful fathers, like man in mind and shape, only unspeakably
 higher.</p>
 
 <p>For a type of this Olympian spirit we may take a phenomenon that has
 perhaps sometimes wearied us: the reiterated insistence in the reliefs
 of the best period on the strife of men against centaurs or of gods
 against giants. Our modern sympathies are apt to side with the giants
 and centaurs. An age of order likes romantic violence, as landsmen safe
 in their houses like <a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></a> storms at sea. But to the Greek, this battle was
 full of symbolical meaning. It is the strife, the ultimate victory, of
 human intelligence, reason, and gentleness, against what seems at first
 the overwhelming power of passion and unguided strength. It is Hellas
 against the brute world.<a name="an_fr_61_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_61_1">61_1</a></p>
 
 <p>The victory of Hellenism over barbarism, of man over beast: that was the
 aim, but was it ever accomplished? The Olympian gods as we see them in
 art appear so calm, so perfect, so far removed from the atmosphere of
 acknowledged imperfection and spiritual striving, that what I am now
 about to say may again seem a deliberate paradox. It is nevertheless
 true that the Olympian Religion is only to the full intelligible and
 admirable if we realize it as a superb and baffled endeavour, not a
 <i>telos</i> or completion but a movement and effort of life.</p>
 
 <p>We may analyse the movement into three main elements: a moral
 expurgation of the old rites, an attempt to bring order into the old
 chaos, and lastly <a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="green">p. 62</font></a> an adaptation to new social needs. We will take the
 three in order.</p>
 
 <p>In the first place, it gradually swept out of religion, or at least
 covered with a decent veil, that great mass of rites which was concerned
 with the Food-supply and the Tribe-supply and aimed at direct
 stimulation of generative processes.<a name="an_fr_62_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_62_1">62_1</a> It left only a few reverent
 and mystic rituals, a few licensed outbursts of riotous indecency in
 comedy and the agricultural festivals. It swept away what seems to us a
 thing less dangerous, a large part of the worship of the dead. Such
 worship, our evidence shows us, gave a loose rein to superstition. To
 the Olympian movement it was vulgar, it was semi-barbarous, it was often
 bloody. We find that it has almost disappeared from Homeric Athens at a
 time when the monuments show it still flourishing in un-Homeric Sparta.
 The Olympian movement swept away also, at least for two splendid
 centuries, the worship of the man-god, with its diseased atmosphere of
 megalomania and blood-lust.<a name="an_fr_62_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_62_2">62_2</a> These things return with the fall of
 Hellenism; but the great period, as it urges man to use all his powers
 of thought, of daring and endurance, of social organization, so it bids
 him remember that he is a man like other men, subject to the same laws
 and bound to reckon with the same death.</p>
 
 <p>So much for the moral expurgation: next for the bringing of intellectual
 order. To parody the words of Anaxagoras, 'In the early religion all
 things were together, till the Homeric system came and arranged them'.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></a> </p><p>We constantly find in the Greek pantheon beings who can be described as
 <ins class="greek" title="pollôn onomatôn morphê mia">πολλῶν ὀνομάτων μορφὴ μἴα</ins>, 'one form of many names'. Each tribe, each
 little community, sometimes one may almost say each caste—the Children
 of the Bards, the Children of the Potters—had its own special gods. Now
 as soon as there was any general 'Sunoikismos' or 'Settling-together',
 any effective surmounting of the narrowest local barriers, these
 innumerable gods tended to melt into one another. Under different
 historical circumstances this process might have been carried resolutely
 through and produced an intelligible pantheon in which each god had his
 proper function and there was no overlapping—one Korê, one Kouros, one
 Sun-God, and so on. But in Greece that was impossible. Imaginations had
 been too vivid, and local types had too often become clearly personified
 and differentiated. The Maiden of Athens, Athena, did no doubt absorb
 some other Korai, but she could not possibly combine with her of Cythêra
 or Cyprus, or Ephesus, nor with the Argive Korê or the Delian or the
 Brauronian. What happened was that the infinite cloud of Maidens was
 greatly reduced and fell into four or five main types. The Korai of
 Cyprus, Cythêra, Corinth, Eryx, and some other places were felt to be
 one, and became absorbed in the great figure of Aphrodite. Artemis
 absorbed a quantity more, including those of Delos and Brauron, of
 various parts of Arcadia and Sparta, and even, as we saw, the fertility
 Korê of Ephesus. Doubtless she and the Delian were originally much
 closer together, but the Delian differentiated towards ideal virginity,
 the Ephesian towards ideal fruitfulness. The Kouroi, or Youths, in the
 same way were absorbed into some <a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></a> half-dozen great mythological shapes,
 Apollo, Ares, Hermes, Dionysus, and the like.</p>
 
 <p>As so often in Greek development, we are brought up against the immense
 formative power of fiction or romance. The simple Korê or Kouros was a
 figure of indistinct outline with no history or personality. Like the
 Roman functional gods, such beings were hardly persons; they melted
 easily one into another. But when the Greek imagination had once done
 its work upon them, a figure like Athena or Aphrodite had become, for
 all practical purposes, a definite person, almost as definite as
 Achilles or Odysseus, as Macbeth or Falstaff. They crystallize hard.
 They will no longer melt or blend, at least not at an ordinary
 temperature. In the fourth and third centuries we hear a great deal
 about the gods all being one, 'Zeus the same as Hades, Hades as Helios,
 Helios the same as Dionysus',<a name="an_fr_64_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_64_1">64_1</a> but the amalgamation only takes
 place in the white heat of ecstatic philosophy or the rites of religious
 mysticism.</p>
 
 <p>The best document preserved to us of this attempt to bring order into
 Chaos is the poetry of Hesiod. There are three poems, all devoted to
 this object, composed perhaps under the influence of Delphi and
 certainly under that of Homer, and trying in a quasi-Homeric dialect and
 under a quasi-Olympian system to bring together vast masses of ancient
 theology and folk-lore and scattered tradition. The <i>Theogony</i> attempts
 to make a pedigree and hierarchy of the Gods; <i>The Catalogue of Women</i>
 and the <i>Eoiai</i>, <a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="green">p. 65</font></a> preserved only in scanty fragments, attempt to fix in
 canonical form the cloudy mixture of dreams and boasts and legends and
 hypotheses by which most royal families in central Greece recorded their
 descent from a traditional ancestress and a conjectural God. The <i>Works
 and Days</i> form an attempt to collect and arrange the rules and tabus
 relating to agriculture. The work of Hesiod as a whole is one of the
 most valiant failures in literature. The confusion and absurdity of it
 are only equalled by its strange helpless beauty and its extraordinary
 historical interest. The Hesiodic system when compared with that of
 Homer is much more explicit, much less expurgated, infinitely less
 accomplished and tactful. At the back of Homer lay the lordly
 warrior-gods of the Heroic Age, at the back of Hesiod the crude and
 tangled superstitions of the peasantry of the mainland. Also the
 Hesiodic poets worked in a comparatively backward and unenlightened
 atmosphere, the Homeric were exposed to the full light of Athens.</p>
 
 <p>The third element in this Homeric reformation is an attempt to make
 religion satisfy the needs of a new social order. The earliest Greek
 religion was clearly based on the tribe, a band of people, all in some
 sense kindred and normally living together, people with the same
 customs, ancestors, initiations, flocks and herds and fields. This
 tribal and agricultural religion can hardly have maintained itself
 unchanged at the great Aegean centres, like Cnossus and Mycenae.<a name="an_fr_65_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_65_1">65_1</a>
 It <a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></a> certainly did not maintain itself among the marauding chiefs of the
 heroic age. It bowed its head beneath the sceptre of its own divine
 kings and the armed heel of its northern invaders, only to appear again
 almost undamaged and unimproved when the kings were fallen and the
 invaders sunk into the soil like storms of destructive rain.</p>
 
 <p>But it no longer suited its environment. In the age of the migrations
 the tribes had been broken, scattered, re-mixed. They had almost ceased
 to exist as important social entities. The social unit which had taken
 their place was the political community of men, of whatever tribe or
 tribes, who were held together in times of danger and constant war by
 means of a common circuit-wall, a Polis.<a name="an_fr_66_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_66_1">66_1</a> The idea of the tribe
 remained. In the earliest classical period we find every Greek city
 still nominally composed of tribes, but the tribes are fictitious. The
 early city-makers could still only conceive of society on a tribal
 basis. Every local or accidental congregation of people who wish to act
 together have to invent an imaginary common ancestor. The clash between
 the old tribal traditions that have lost their meaning, though not their
 sanctity, and the new duties imposed <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></a> by the actual needs of the Polis,
 leads to many strange and interesting compromises. The famous
 constitution of Cleisthenes shows several. An old proverb expresses well
 the ordinary feeling on the subject:</p>
 
 <div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
 <span class="i0"><ins class="greek" title="hôs ke polis rhexeie, nomos d' archaios haristos.">ὥς κε πόλις ῥέξειε, νόμος δ' ἀρχαῖος ἅριστος.</ins><br></span>
 </div><div class="stanza">
 <span class="i0">'Whatever the City may do; but the old custom is the best.'<br></span>
 </div></div>
 
 <p>Now in the contest between city and tribe, the Olympian gods had one
 great negative advantage. They were not tribal or local, and all other
 gods were. They were by this time international, with no strong roots
 anywhere except where one of them could be identified with some native
 god; they were full of fame and beauty and prestige. They were ready to
 be made 'Poliouchoi', 'City-holders', of any particular city, still more
 ready to be 'Hellânioi', patrons of all Hellas.</p>
 
 <hr style="width: 45%;">
 
 <p>In the working out of these three aims the Olympian religion achieved
 much: in all three it failed. The moral expurgation failed owing to the
 mere force of inertia possessed by old religious traditions and local
 cults. We must remember how weak any central government was in ancient
 civilization. The power and influence of a highly civilized society were
 apt to end a few miles outside its city wall. All through the backward
 parts of Greece obscene and cruel rites lingered on, the darker and
 worse the further they were removed from the full light of Hellenism.</p>
 
 <p>But in this respect the Olympian Religion did not merely fail: it did
 worse. To make the elements of <a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></a> a nature-religion human is inevitably to
 make them vicious. There is no great moral harm in worshipping a
 thunder-storm, even though the lightning strikes the good and evil quite
 recklessly. There is no need to pretend that the Lightning is exercising
 a wise and righteous choice. But when once you worship an imaginary
 quasi-human being who throws the lightning, you are in a dilemma. Either
 you have to admit that you are worshipping and flattering a being with
 no moral sense, because he happens to be dangerous, or else you have to
 invent reasons for his wrath against the people who happen to be struck.
 And they are pretty sure to be bad reasons. The god, if personal,
 becomes capricious and cruel.</p>
 
 <p>When the Ark of Israel was being brought back from the Philistines, the
 cattle slipped by the threshing floor of Nachon, and the holy object was
 in danger of falling. A certain Uzzah, as we all know, sprang forward to
 save it and was struck dead for his pains. Now, if he was struck dead by
 the sheer holiness of the tabu object, the holiness stored inside it
 like so much electricity, his death was a misfortune, an interesting
 accident, and no more.<a name="an_fr_68_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_68_1">68_1</a> But when it is made into the deliberate act
 of an anthropomorphic god, who strikes a well-intentioned man dead in
 explosive rage for a very pardonable mistake, a dangerous element has
 been introduced into the ethics of that religion. A being who is the
 moral equal of man must not behave like a charge of dynamite.</p>
 
 <p>Again, to worship emblems of fertility and generation, as was done in
 agricultural rites all through the Aegean <a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="green">p. 69</font></a> area, is in itself an
 intelligible and not necessarily a degrading practice. But when those
 emblems are somehow humanized, and the result is an anthropomorphic god
 of enormous procreative power and innumerable amours, a religion so
 modified has received a death-blow. The step that was meant to soften
 its grossness has resulted in its moral degradation. This result was
 intensified by another well-meant effort at elevation. The leading
 tribes of central Greece were, as we have mentioned, apt to count their
 descent from some heroine-ancestress. Her consort was sometimes unknown
 and, in a matrilinear society, unimportant. Sometimes he was a local god
 or river. When the Olympians came to introduce some order and unity
 among these innumerable local gods, the original tribal ancestor tended,
 naturally enough, to be identified with Zeus, Apollo, or Poseidon. The
 unfortunate Olympians, whose system really aimed at purer morals and
 condemned polygamy and polyandry, are left with a crowd of consorts that
 would put Solomon to shame.</p>
 
 <p>Thus a failure in the moral expurgation was deepened by a failure in the
 attempt to bring intellectual order into the welter of primitive gods.
 The only satisfactory end of that effort would have been monotheism. If
 Zeus had only gone further and become completely, once and for all, the
 father of all life, the scandalous stories would have lost their point
 and meaning. It is curious how near to monotheism, and to monotheism of
 a very profound and impersonal type, the real religion of Greece came in
 the sixth and fifth centuries. Many of the philosophers, Xenophanes,
 Parmenides, and others, asserted it clearly or assumed it without
 hesitation. Aeschylus, Euripides, Plato, in their deeper <a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="green">p. 70</font></a> moments point
 the same road. Indeed a metaphysician might hold that their theology is
 far deeper than that to which we are accustomed, since they seem not to
 make any particular difference between <ins class="greek" title="hoi theoi">οἱ θεοί</ins> and <ins class="greek" title="ho theos">ὁ θεός</ins> or <ins class="greek" title="to
 theion">τὸ θεῖον</ins>. They do not instinctively suppose that the human distinctions
 between 'he' and 'it', or between 'one' and 'many', apply to the divine.
 Certainly Greek monotheism, had it really carried the day, would have
 been a far more philosophic thing than the tribal and personal
 monotheism of the Hebrews. But unfortunately too many hard-caked
 superstitions, too many tender and sensitive associations, were linked
 with particular figures in the pantheon or particular rites which had
 brought the worshippers religious peace. If there had been some Hebrew
 prophets about, and a tyrant or two, progressive and bloody-minded, to
 agree with them, polytheism might perhaps actually have been stamped out
 in Greece at one time. But Greek thought, always sincere and daring, was
 seldom brutal, seldom ruthless or cruel. The thinkers of the great
 period felt their own way gently to the Holy of Holies, and did not try
 to compel others to take the same way. Greek theology, whether popular
 or philosophical, seldom denied any god, seldom forbade any worship.
 What it tried to do was to identify every new god with some aspect of
 one of the old ones, and the result was naturally confusion. Apart from
 the Epicurean school, which though powerful was always unpopular, the
 religious thought of later antiquity for the most part took refuge in a
 sort of apotheosis of good taste, in which the great care was not to
 hurt other people's feelings, or else it collapsed into helpless
 mysticism.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></a> </p><p>The attempt to make Olympianism a religion of the Polis failed also.
 The Olympians did not belong to any particular city: they were too
 universal; and no particular city had a very positive faith in them. The
 actual Polis was real and tangible, the Homeric gods a little alien and
 literary. The City herself was a most real power; and the true gods of
 the City, who had grown out of the soil and the wall, were simply the
 City herself in her eternal and personal aspect, as mother and guide and
 lawgiver, the worshipped and beloved being whom each citizen must defend
 even to the death. As the Kouros of his day emerged from the social
 group of Kouroi, or the Aphiktor from the band of suppliants, in like
 fashion <ins class="greek" title="hê Polias">ἡ Πολιάς</ins> or <ins class="greek" title="ho Polieus">ὁ Πολιεύς</ins> emerged as a personification or
 projection of the city. <ins class="greek" title="hê Polias">ἡ Πολιάς</ins> in Athens was of course Athena; <ins class="greek" title="ho
 Polieus">ὁ Πολιεύς</ins> might as well be called Zeus as anything else. In reality such
 beings fall into the same class as the hero Argos or 'Korinthos son of
 Zeus'. The City worship was narrow; yet to broaden it was, except in
 some rare minds, to sap its life. The ordinary man finds it impossible
 to love his next-door neighbours except by siding with them against the
 next-door-but-one.</p>
 
 <p>It proved difficult even in a city like Athens to have gods that would
 appeal to the loyalty of all Attica. On the Acropolis at Athens there
 seem originally to have been Athena and some Kouros corresponding with
 her, some Waterer of the earth, like Erechtheus. Then as Attica was
 united and brought under the lead of its central city, the gods of the
 outlying districts began to claim places on the Acropolis. Pallas, the
 thunder-maid of Pallene in the south, came to form a joint personality
 with Athena. Oinoe, a town in the north-east, <a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="green">p. 72</font></a> on the way from Delos to
 Delphi, had for its special god a 'Pythian Apollo'; when Oinoe became
 Attic a place for the Pythian Apollo had to be found on the Acropolis.
 Dionysus came from Eleutherae, Demeter and Korê from Eleusis, Theseus
 himself perhaps from Marathon or even from Trozên. They were all given
 official residences on Athena's rock, and Athens in return sent out
 Athena to new temples built for her in Prasiae and Sunion and various
 colonies.<a name="an_fr_72_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_72_1">72_1</a> This development came step by step and grew out of real
 worships. It was quite different from the wholesale adoption of a body
 of non-national, poetical gods: yet even this development was too
 artificial, too much stamped with the marks of expediency and courtesy
 and compromise. It could not live. The personalities of such gods vanish
 away; their prayers become prayers to 'all gods and goddesses of the
 City'—<ins class="greek" title="theois kai theêsi pasi kai pasêsi">θεοῖς καὶ θεῇσι πᾶσι καὶ πάσῃςι</ins>; those who remain, chiefly
 Athena and Theseus, only mean Athens.</p>
 
 <p>What then, amid all this failure, did the Olympian religion really
 achieve? First, it debarbarized the worship of the leading states of
 Greece—not of all Greece, since antiquity had no means of spreading
 knowledge comparable to ours. It reduced the horrors of the
 'Urdummheit', for the most part, to a romantic memory, and made religion
 no longer a mortal danger to humanity. Unlike many religious systems, it
 generally permitted progress; it encouraged not only the obedient
 virtues but the daring virtues as well. It had in it the spirit that
 saves from disaster, that <a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="green">p. 73</font></a> knows itself fallible and thinks twice before
 it hates and curses and persecutes. It wrapped religion in Sophrosynê.</p>
 
 <p>Again, it worked for concord and fellow-feeling throughout the Greek
 communities. It is, after all, a good deal to say, that in Greek history
 we find almost no warring of sects, no mutual tortures or even
 blasphemies. With many ragged edges, with many weaknesses, it built up
 something like a united Hellenic religion to stand against the 'beastly
 devices of the heathen'. And after all, if we are inclined on the purely
 religious side to judge the Olympian system harshly, we must not forget
 its sheer beauty. Truth, no doubt, is greater than beauty. But in many
 matters beauty can be attained and truth cannot. All we know is that
 when the best minds seek for truth the result is apt to be beautiful. It
 was a great thing that men should envisage the world as governed, not by
 Giants and Gorgons and dealers in eternal torture, but by some human and
 more than human Understanding (<ins class="greek" title="Xynesis">Ξύνεσις</ins>),<a name="an_fr_73_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_73_1">73_1</a> by beings of quiet
 splendour like many a classical Zeus and Hermes and Demeter. If
 Olympianism was not a religious faith, it was at least a vital force in
 the shaping of cities and societies which remain after two thousand
 years a type to the world of beauty and freedom and high endeavour. Even
 the stirring of its ashes, when they seemed long cold, had power to
 produce something of the same result; for the <a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></a> classicism of the Italian
 Renaissance is a child, however fallen, of the Olympian spirit.</p>
 
 <p>Of course, I recognize that beauty is not the same as faith. There is,
 in one sense, far more faith in some hideous miracle-working icon which
 sends out starving peasants to massacre Jews than in the Athena of
 Phidias. Yet, once we have rid our minds of trivial mythology, there is
 religion in Athena also. Athena is an ideal, an ideal and a mystery; the
 ideal of wisdom, of incessant labour, of almost terrifying purity, seen
 through the light of some mystic and spiritual devotion like, but
 transcending, the love of man for woman. Or, if the way of Athena is too
 hard for us common men, it is not hard to find a true religious ideal in
 such a figure as Persephone. In Persephone there is more of pathos and
 of mystery. She has more recently entered the calm ranks of Olympus; the
 old liturgy of the dying and re-risen Year-bride still clings to her. If
 Religion is that which brings us into relation with the great
 world-forces, there is the very heart of life in this home-coming Bride
 of the underworld, life with its broken hopes, its disaster, its
 new-found spiritual joy: life seen as Mother and Daughter, not a thing
 continuous and unchanging but shot through with parting and death, life
 as a great love or desire ever torn asunder and ever renewed.</p>
 
 <p>'But stay,' a reader may object: 'is not this the Persephone, the
 Athena, of modern sentiment? Are these figures really the goddesses of
 the <i>Iliad</i> and of Sophocles?' The truth is, I think, that they are
 neither the one nor the other. They are the goddesses of ancient
 reflection and allegory; the goddesses, that is, of the best and most
 characteristic worship that <a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></a> these idealized creations awakened. What we
 have treated hitherto as the mortal weakness of the Olympians, the fact
 that they have no roots in any particular soil, little hold on any
 definite primeval cult, has turned out to be their peculiar strength. We
 must not think of allegory as a late post-classical phenomenon in
 Greece. It begins at least as early as Pythagoras and Heraclitus,
 perhaps as early as Hesiod; for Hesiod seems sometimes to be turning
 allegory back into myth. The Olympians, cut loose from the soil,
 enthroned only in men's free imagination, have two special regions which
 they have made their own: mythology and allegory. The mythology drops
 for the most part very early out of practical religion. Even in Homer we
 find it expurgated; in Pindar, Aeschylus, and Xenophanes it is
 expurgated, denied and allegorized. The myths survive chiefly as
 material for literature, the shapes of the gods themselves chiefly as
 material for art. They are both of them objects not of belief but of
 imagination. Yet when the religious imagination of Greece deepens it
 twines itself still around these gracious and ever-moving shapes; the
 Zeus of Aeschylus moves on into the Zeus of Plato or of Cleanthes or of
 Marcus Aurelius. Hermes, Athena, Apollo, all have their long spiritual
 history. They are but little impeded by the echoes of the old frivolous
 mythology; still less by any local roots or sectional prejudices or
 compulsory details of ritual. As the more highly educated mind of Greece
 emerged from a particular, local, tribal, conception of religion, the
 old denationalized Olympians were ready to receive her.</p>
 
 <p>The real religion of the fifth century was, as we have said, a devotion
 to the City itself. It is expressed <a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="green">p. 76</font></a> often in Aeschylus and Sophocles,
 again and again with more discord and more criticism in Euripides and
 Plato; for the indignant blasphemies of the Gorgias and the Troades bear
 the same message as the ideal patriotism of the Republic. It is
 expressed best perhaps, and that without mention of the name of a single
 god, in the great Funeral Speech of Pericles. It is higher than most
 modern patriotism because it is set upon higher ideals. It is more
 fervid because the men practising it lived habitually nearer to the
 danger-point, and, when they spoke of dying for the City, spoke of a
 thing they had faced last week and might face again to-morrow. It was
 more religious because of the unconscious mysticism in which it is
 clothed even by such hard heads as Pericles and Thucydides, the
 mysticism of men in the presence of some fact for which they have no
 words great enough. Yet for all its intensity it was condemned by its
 mere narrowness. By the fourth century the average Athenian must have
 recognized what philosophers had recognized long before, that a
 religion, to be true, must be universal and not the privilege of a
 particular people. As soon as the Stoics had proclaimed the world to be
 'one great City of gods and men', the only Gods with which Greece could
 satisfactorily people that City were the idealized band of the old
 Olympians.</p>
 
 <p>They are artists' dreams, ideals, allegories; they are symbols of
 something beyond themselves. They are Gods of half-rejected tradition,
 of unconscious make-believe, of aspiration. They are gods to whom
 doubtful philosophers can pray, with all a philosopher's due caution, as
 to so many radiant and heart-searching hypotheses. They are not gods in
 whom any one <a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="green">p. 77</font></a> believes as a hard fact. Does this condemn them? Or is it
 just the other way? Is it perhaps that one difference between Religion
 and Superstition lies exactly in this, that Superstition degrades its
 worship by turning its beliefs into so many statements of brute fact, on
 which it must needs act without question, without striving, without any
 respect for others or any desire for higher or fuller truth? It is only
 an accident—though perhaps an invariable accident—that all the
 supposed facts are false. In Religion, however precious you may consider
 the truth you draw from it, you know that it is a truth seen dimly, and
 possibly seen by others better than by you. You know that all your
 creeds and definitions are merely metaphors, attempts to use human
 language for a purpose for which it was never made. Your concepts are,
 by the nature of things, inadequate; the truth is not in you but beyond
 you, a thing not conquered but still to be pursued. Something like this,
 I take it, was the character of the Olympian Religion in the higher
 minds of later Greece. Its gods could awaken man's worship and
 strengthen his higher aspirations; but at heart they knew themselves to
 be only metaphors. As the most beautiful image carved by man was not the
 god, but only a symbol, to help towards conceiving the god;<a name="an_fr_77_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fn_77_1">77_1</a> <a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></a> so
 the god himself, when conceived, was not the reality but only a symbol
 to help towards conceiving the reality. That was the work set before
 them. Meantime they issued no creeds that contradicted knowledge, no
 commands that made man sin against his own inner light.</p>

 the Athenas are', like <ins class="greek" title="hoi ichthyes">οἱ ἰχθύες</ins>, the fish-market; 'the Athenas'
 would be statues, like <ins class="greek" title="hoi Hermai">οἱ Ἑρμαῖ</ins>—the famous 'Attic Maidens' on the
 Acropolis. This explanation would lead to some interesting results.
 </p><p>
 We need not here consider how, partly by identification with other
 Korae, like Pallas, Onka, &amp;c., partly by a genuine spread of the cult,
 Athena became prominent in other cities. As to Homer, Athena is far more
 deeply imbedded in the <i>Odyssey</i> than in the <i>Iliad</i>. I am inclined to
 agree with those who believe that our <i>Odyssey</i> was very largely
 composed in Athens, so that in most of the poem Athena is original. (Cf.
 O. Seeck, <i>Die Quellen der Odyssee</i> (1887), pp. 366-420; Mülder, <i>Die
 Ilias and ihre Quellen</i> (1910), pp. 350-5.) In some parts of the <i>Iliad</i>
 the name Athena may well have been substituted for some Northern goddess
 whose name is now lost.</p></div>
 
 <div class="footnote"><p><a name="an_fn_53_2"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fr_53_2">53_2</a> It is worth noting also that this Homeric triad seems
 also to be recognized as the chief Athenian triad. Plato, <i>Euthyd.</i> 302
 c, quoted above, continues: <i>Socrates.</i> 'We have Zeus with the names
 Herkeios and Phratrios, but not Patrôos, and Athena Phratria.'
 <i>Dionysodorus.</i> 'Well that is enough. You have, apparently, Apollo and
 Zeus and Athena?' <i>Socrates.</i> 'Certainly.'—Apollo is put first because
 he has been accepted as Patrôos. But see <i>R. G. E.</i>,<sup>3</sup> p. 49, n.</p></div>

 Egyptian, influences. No doubt the Achaean gods were influenced on their
 side by Cretan conceptions, though perhaps not so much as Ionia was. Cf.

 <div class="footnote"><p><a name="an_fn_73_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fr_73_1">73_1</a> The <ins class="greek" title="Xynesis">Ξύνεσις</ins> in which the Chorus finds it hard to
 believe, <i>Hippolytus</i>, 1105. Cf. <i>Iph. Aul.</i> 394, 1189; <i>Herc.</i> 655;
 also the ideas in <i>Suppl.</i> 203, Eur. Fr. 52, 9, where <ins class="greek" title="Xynesis">Ξύνεσις</ins> is
 implanted in man by a special grace of God. The gods are <ins class="greek" title="xynetoi">ξυνετοί</ins>, but
 of course Euripides goes too far in actually praying to <ins class="greek" title="Xynesis">Ξύνεσις</ins>, Ar.
 <i>Frogs</i>, 893.</p></div>
 
 <div class="footnote"><p><a name="an_fn_77_1"></a><a href="fsgr06.htm#an_fr_77_1">77_1</a> Cf. the beautiful defence of idols by Maximus of Tyre,
 Or. viii (in Wilamowitz's <i>Lesebuch</i>, ii. 338 ff.). I quote the last
 paragraph:
 </p><p>
 'God Himself, the father and fashioner of all that is, older than the
 Sun or the Sky, greater than time and eternity and all the flow of
 being, is unnameable by any lawgiver, unutterable by any voice, not to
 be seen by any eye. But we, being unable to apprehend His essence, use
 the help of sounds and names and pictures, of beaten gold and ivory and
 silver, of plants and rivers, mountain-peaks and torrents, yearning for
 the knowledge of Him, and in our weakness naming all that is beautiful
 in this world after His nature—just as happens to earthly lovers. To
 them the most beautiful sight will be the actual lineaments of the
 beloved, but for remembrance' sake they will be happy in the sight of a
 lyre, a little spear, a chair, perhaps, or a running-ground, or anything
 in the world that wakens the memory of the beloved. Why should I further
 examine and pass judgement about Images? Let men know what is divine
 (<ins class="greek" title="to theion genos">τὸ θεῖον γένος</ins>), let them know: that is all. If a Greek is stirred
 to the remembrance of God by the art of Pheidias, an Egyptian by paying
 worship to animals, another man by a river, another by fire—I have no
 anger for their divergences; only let them know, let them love, let them
 remember.'</p></div>
