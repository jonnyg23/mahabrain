 <h2>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h2>
 
 <p>This small book has taken a long time in growing. Though the first two
 essays were only put in writing this year for a course of lectures which
 I had the honour of delivering at Columbia University in 1912, the
 third, which was also used at Columbia, had in its main features
 appeared in the <i>Hibbert Journal</i> in 1910, the fourth in part in the
 <i>English Review</i> in 1908; the translation of Sallustius was made in 1907
 for use with a small class at Oxford. Much of the material is much older
 in conception, and all has been reconsidered. I must thank the editors
 of both the above-named periodicals for their kind permission to
 reprint.</p>
 
 <p>I think it was the writings of my friend Mr. Andrew Lang that first
 awoke me, in my undergraduate days, to the importance of anthropology
 and primitive religion to a Greek scholar. Certainly I began then to
 feel that the great works of the ancient Greek imagination are
 penetrated habitually by religious conceptions and postulates which
 literary scholars like myself had not observed or understood. In the
 meantime the situation has changed. Greek religion is being studied
 right and left, and has revealed itself as a surprisingly rich and
 attractive, though somewhat controversial, subject. It used to be a
 deserted territory; now it is at least a battle-ground. If ever the
 present differences resolved themselves into a simple fight with
 shillelaghs between the scholars and the anthropologists, I should
 without doubt wield my <a name="page_xiv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xiv</font></a> reluctant weapon on the side of the scholars.
 Scholarship is the rarer, harder, less popular and perhaps the more
 permanently valuable work, and it certainly stands more in need of
 defence at the moment. But in the meantime I can hardly understand how
 the purest of 'pure scholars' can fail to feel his knowledge enriched by
 the savants who have compelled us to dig below the surface of our
 classical tradition and to realize the imaginative and historical
 problems which so often lie concealed beneath the smooth security of a
 verbal 'construe'. My own essays do not for a moment claim to speak with
 authority on a subject which is still changing and showing new facets
 year by year. They only claim to represent the way of regarding certain
 large issues of Greek Religion which has gradually taken shape, and has
 proved practically helpful and consistent with facts, in the mind of a
 very constant, though unsystematic, reader of many various periods of
 Greek literature.</p>
 
 <p>In the first essay my debt to Miss Harrison is great and obvious. My
 statement of one or two points is probably different from hers, but in
 the main I follow her lead. And in either case I cannot adequately
 describe the advantage I have derived from many years of frequent
 discussion and comparison of results with a Hellenist whose learning and
 originality of mind are only equalled by her vivid generosity towards
 her fellow-workers.</p>
 
 <p>The second may also be said to have grown out of Miss Harrison's
 writings. She has by now made the title of 'Olympian' almost a term of
 reproach, and thrown down so many a scornful challenge to the canonical
 gods of Greece, that I have ventured on <a name="page_xv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xv</font></a> this attempt to explain their
 historical origin and plead for their religious value. When the essay
 was already written I read Mr. Chadwick's impressive book on <i>The Heroic
 Age</i> (Cambridge, 1912), and was delighted to find in an author whose
 standpoint and equipment are so different from mine so much that
 confirmed or clarified my own view.</p>
 
 <p>The title of the third essay I owe to a conversation with Professor J.
 B. Bury. We were discussing the change that took place in Greek thought
 between, say, Plato and the Neo-Platonists, or even between Aristotle
 and Posidonius, and which is seen at its highest power in the Gnostics.
 I had been calling it a rise of asceticism, or mysticism, or religious
 passion, or the like, when my friend corrected me. 'It is not a rise; it
 is a fall or failure of something, a sort of failure of nerve.'—We are
 treading here upon somewhat firmer ground than in the first two essays.
 The field for mere conjecture is less: we are supported more
 continuously by explicit documents. Yet the subject is a very difficult
 one owing to the scattered and chaotic nature of the sources, and even
 where we get away from fragments and reconstructions and reach definite
 treatises with or without authors' names, I cannot pretend to feel
 anything like the same clearness about the true meaning of a passage in
 Philo or the Corpus Hermeticum that one normally feels in a writer of
 the classical period. Consequently in this essay I think I have hugged
 my modern authorities rather close, and seldom expressed an opinion for
 which I could not find some fairly authoritative backing, my debt being
 particularly great to Reitzenstein, Bousset, and the brilliant
 <i>Hellenistisch-römische Kultur</i> of <a name="page_xvi"><font size="1" color="green">p. xvi</font></a> P. Wendland. I must also thank my
 old pupil, Mr. Edwyn Bevan, who was kind enough to read this book in
 proof, for some valuable criticisms. The subject is one of such
 extraordinary interest that I offer no apology for calling further
 attention to it.</p>
 
 <p>A word or two about the last brief revival of the ancient religion under
 'Julian the Apostate' forms the natural close to this series of studies.
 But here our material, both historical and literary, is so abundant that
 I have followed a different method. After a short historical
 introduction I have translated in full a very curious and little-known
 ancient text, which may be said to constitute something like an
 authoritative Pagan creed. Some readers may regret that I do not give
 the Greek as well as the English. I am reluctant, however, to publish a
 text which I have not examined in the MSS., and I feel also that, while
 an edition of Sallustius is rather urgently needed, it ought to be an
 edition with a full commentary.<a name="an_fr_xvi_1"></a><a href="fsgr03.htm#an_fn_xvi_1">xvi_1</a></p>
 
 <p>I was first led to these studies by the wish to fill up certain puzzling
 blanks of ignorance in my own mind, and doubtless the little book bears
 marks of this origin. It aims largely at the filling of interstices. It
 avoids the great illuminated places, and gives its mind to the stretches
 of intervening twilight. It deals little with the harvest of flowers or
 fruit, but watches the inconspicuous seasons when the soil is beginning
 to stir, the seeds are falling or ripening.</p>
