 <h3>THE LAST PROTEST</h3>
 
 
 <p>In the last essay we have followed Greek popular religion to the very
 threshold of Christianity, till we found not only a soil ready for the
 seed of Christian metaphysic, but a large number of the plants already
 in full and exuberant growth. A complete history of Greek religion
 ought, without doubt, to include at least the rise of Christianity and
 the growth of the Orthodox Church, but, of course, the present series of
 studies does not aim at completeness. We will take the Christian
 theology for granted as we took the classical Greek philosophy, and will
 finish with a brief glance at the Pagan reaction of the fourth century,
 when the old religion, already full of allegory, mysticism, asceticism,
 and Oriental influences, raised itself for a last indignant stand
 against the all-prevailing deniers of the gods.</p>
 
 <p>This period, however, admits a rather simpler treatment than the others.
 It so happens that for the last period of paganism we actually possess
 an authoritative statement of doctrine, something between a creed and a
 catechism. It seems to me a document so singularly important and, as far
 as I can make out, so little known, that I shall venture to print it
 entire.</p>
 
 <p>A creed or catechism is, of course, not at all the same thing as the
 real religion of those who subscribe <a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 174</font></a> to it. The rules of metre are not
 the same thing as poetry; the rules of cricket, if the analogy may be
 excused, are not the same thing as good play. Nay, more. A man states in
 his creed only the articles which he thinks it right to assert
 positively against those who think otherwise. His deepest and most
 practical beliefs are those on which he acts without question, which
 have never occurred to him as being open to doubt. If you take on the
 one hand a number of persons who have accepted the same creed but lived
 in markedly different ages and societies, with markedly different
 standards of thought and conduct, and on the other an equal number who
 profess different creeds but live in the same general environment, I
 think there will probably be more real identity of religion in the
 latter group. Take three orthodox Christians, enlightened according to
 the standards of their time, in the fourth, the sixteenth, and the
 twentieth centuries respectively, I think you will find more profound
 differences of religion between them than between a Methodist, a
 Catholic, a Freethinker, and even perhaps a well-educated Buddhist or
 Brahmin at the present day, provided you take the most generally
 enlightened representatives of each class. Still, when a student is
 trying to understand the inner religion of the ancients, he realizes how
 immensely valuable a creed or even a regular liturgy would be.</p>
 
 <p>Literature enables us sometimes to approach pretty close, in various
 ways, to the minds of certain of the great men of antiquity, and
 understand how they thought and felt about a good many subjects. At
 times one of these subjects is the accepted religion of <a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></a> their society;
 we can see how they criticized it or rejected it. But it is very hard to
 know from their reaction against it what that accepted religion really
 was. Who, for instance, knows Herodotus's religion? He talks in his
 penetrating and garrulous way, 'sometimes for children and sometimes for
 philosophers,' as Gibbon puts it, about everything in the world; but at
 the end of his book you find that he has not opened his heart on this
 subject. No doubt his profession as a reciter and story-teller prevented
 him. We can see that Thucydides was sceptical; but can we fully see what
 his scepticism was directed against, or where, for instance, Nikias
 would have disagreed with him, and where he and Nikias both agreed
 against us?</p>
 
 <p>We have, of course, the systems of the great philosophers—especially of
 Plato and Aristotle. Better than either, perhaps, we can make out the
 religion of M. Aurelius. Amid all the harshness and plainness of his
 literary style, Marcus possessed a gift which has been granted to few,
 the power of writing down what was in his heart just as it was, not
 obscured by any consciousness of the presence of witnesses or any
 striving after effect. He does not seem to have tried deliberately to
 reveal himself, yet he has revealed himself in that short personal
 note-book almost as much as the great inspired egotists, Rousseau and
 St. Augustine. True, there are some passages in the book which are
 unintelligible to us; that is natural in a work which was not meant to
 be read by the public; broken flames of the white passion that consumed
 him bursting through the armour of his habitual accuracy and
 self-restraint.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 176</font></a> </p><p>People fail to understand Marcus, not because of his lack of
 self-expression, but because it is hard for most men to breathe at that
 intense height of spiritual life, or, at least, to breathe soberly. They
 can do it if they are allowed to abandon themselves to floods of
 emotion, and to lose self-judgement and self-control. I am often rather
 surprised at good critics speaking of Marcus as 'cold'. There is as much
 intensity of feeling in <ins class="greek" title="Ta eis heauton">Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν</ins> as in most of the nobler modern
 books of religion, only there is a sterner power controlling it. The
 feeling never amounts to complete self-abandonment. 'The Guiding Power'
 never trembles upon its throne, and the emotion is severely purged of
 earthly dross. That being so, we children of earth respond to it less
 readily.</p>
 
 <p>Still, whether or no we can share Marcus's religion, we can at any rate
 understand most of it. But even then we reach only the personal religion
 of a very extraordinary man; we are not much nearer to the religion of
 the average educated person—the background against which Marcus, like
 Plato, ought to stand out. I believe that our conceptions of it are
 really very vague and various. Our great-grandfathers who read 'Tully's
 <i>Offices</i> and <i>Ends</i>' were better informed than we. But there are many
 large and apparently simple questions about which, even after reading
 Cicero's philosophical translations, scholars probably feel quite
 uncertain. Were the morals of Epictetus or the morals of Part V of the
 Anthology most near to those of real life among respectable persons? Are
 there not subjects on which Plato himself sometimes makes our flesh
 creep? What are we to feel about slavery, about the exposing <a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="green">p. 177</font></a> of
 children? True, slavery was not peculiar to antiquity; it flourished in
 a civilized and peculiarly humane people of English blood till a
 generation ago. And the history of infanticide among the finest modern
 nations is such as to make one reluctant to throw stones, and even
 doubtful in which direction to throw them. Still, these great facts and
 others like them have to be understood, and are rather hard to
 understand, in their bearing on the religious life of the ancients.</p>
 
 <p>Points of minor morals again are apt to surprise a reader of ancient
 literature. We must remember, of course, that they always do surprise
 one, in every age of history, as soon as its manners are studied in
 detail. One need not go beyond Salimbene's Chronicle, one need hardly go
 beyond Macaulay's History, or any of the famous French memoirs, to
 realize that. Was it really an ordinary thing in the first century, as
 Philo seems to say, for gentlemen at dinner-parties to black one
 another's eyes or bite one another's ears off?<a name="an_fr_177_1"></a><a href="fsgr09.htm#an_fn_177_1">177_1</a> Or were such
 practices confined to some Smart Set? Or was Philo, for his own
 purposes, using some particular scandalous occurrence as if it was
 typical?</p>
 
 <p>St. Augustine mentions among the virtues of his mother her unusual
 meekness and tact. Although her husband had a fiery temper, she never
 had bruises on her face, which made her a <i>rara avis</i> among the matrons
 of her circle.<a name="an_fr_177_2"></a><a href="fsgr09.htm#an_fn_177_2">177_2</a> Her circle, presumably, included Christians as
 well as Pagans and Manicheans. And Philo's circle can scarcely be
 considered Pagan. Indeed, as for the difference of <a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="green">p. 178</font></a> religion, we should
 bear in mind that, just at the time we are about to consider, the middle
 of the fourth century, the conduct of the Christians, either to the rest
 of the world or to one another, was very far from evangelical. Ammianus
 says that no savage beasts could equal its cruelty; Ammianus was a
 pagan; but St. Gregory himself says it was like Hell.<a name="an_fr_178_1"></a><a href="fsgr09.htm#an_fn_178_1">178_1</a></p>
 
 <p>I have expressed elsewhere my own general answer to this puzzle.<a name="an_fr_178_2"></a><a href="fsgr09.htm#an_fn_178_2">178_2</a>
 Not only in early Greek times, but throughout the whole of antiquity the
 possibility of all sorts of absurd and atrocious things lay much nearer,
 the protective forces of society were much weaker, the strain on
 personal character, the need for real 'wisdom and virtue', was much
 greater than it is at the present day. That is one of the causes that
 make antiquity so interesting. Of course, different periods of antiquity
 varied greatly, both in the conventional standard demanded and in the
 spiritual force which answered or surpassed the demand. But, in general,
 the strong governments and orderly societies of modern Europe have made
 it infinitely easier for men of no particular virtue to live a decent
 life, infinitely easier also for men of no particular reasoning power or
 scientific knowledge to have a more or less scientific or sane view of
 the world.</p>
 
 <p>That, however, does not carry us far towards solving the main problem:
 it brings us no nearer to knowledge of anything that we may call
 typically a religious creed or an authorized code of morals, in any age
 from Hesiod to M. Aurelius.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="green">p. 179</font></a> </p><p>The book which I have ventured to call a Creed or Catechism is the work
 of Sallustius <i>About the Gods and the World</i>, a book, I should say,
 about the length of the Scottish Shorter Catechism. It is printed in the
 third volume of Mullach's <i>Fragmenta Philosophorum</i>; apart from that,
 the only edition generally accessible—and that is rare—is a duodecimo
 published by Allatius in 1539. Orelli's brochure of 1821 seems to be
 unprocurable.</p>
 
 <p>The author was in all probability that Sallustius who is known to us as
 a close friend of Julian before his accession, and a backer or inspirer
 of the emperor's efforts to restore the old religion. He was concerned
 in an educational edition of Sophocles—the seven selected plays now
 extant with a commentary. He was given the rank of prefect in 362, that
 of consul in 363. One must remember, of course, that in that rigorous
 and ascetic court high rank connoted no pomp or luxury. Julian had
 dismissed the thousand hairdressers, the innumerable cooks and eunuchs
 of his Christian predecessor. It probably brought with it only an
 increased obligation to live on pulse and to do without such pamperings
 of the body as fine clothes or warmth or washing.</p>
 
 <p>Julian's fourth oration, a prose hymn <i>To King Sun</i>, <ins class="greek" title="pros Hêlion
 basilea">πρὸς Ἥλιον βασιλέα</ins>, is dedicated to Sallustius; his eighth is a 'Consolation to
 Himself upon the Departure of Sallustius'. (He had been with Julian in
 the wars in Gaul, and was recalled by the jealousy of the emperor
 Constantius.) It is a touching and even a noble treatise. The nervous
 self-distrust which was habitual in Julian makes him write always with a
 certain affectation, but no one could mistake <a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="green">p. 180</font></a> the real feeling of loss
 and loneliness that runs through the consolation. He has lost his
 'comrade in the ranks', and now is 'Odysseus left alone'. So he writes,
 quoting the <i>Iliad</i>; Sallustius has been carried by God outside the
 spears and arrows: 'which malignant men were always aiming at you, or
 rather at me, trying to wound me through you, and believing that the
 only way to beat me down was by depriving me of the fellowship of my
 true friend and fellow-soldier, the comrade who never flinched from
 sharing my dangers.'</p>
 
 <p>One note recurs four times; he has lost the one man to whom he could
 talk as a brother; the man of 'guileless and clean free-speech',<a name="an_fr_180_1"></a><a href="fsgr09.htm#an_fn_180_1">180_1</a>
 who was honest and unafraid and able to contradict the emperor freely
 because of their mutual trust. If one thinks of it, Julian, for all his
 gentleness, must have been an alarming emperor to converse with. His
 standard of conduct was not only uncomfortably high, it was also a
 little unaccountable. The most correct and blameless court officials
 must often have suspected that their master looked upon them as simply
 wallowing in sin. And that feeling does not promote ease or
 truthfulness. Julian compares his friendship with Sallustius to that of
 Scipio and Laelius. People said of Scipio that he only carried out what
 Laelius told him. 'Is that true of me?' Julian asks himself. 'Have I
 only done what Sallustius told me?' His answer is sincere and beautiful:
 <ins class="greek" title="koina ta philôn">κοινὰ τὰ φίλων</ins>. It little matters who suggested, and who agreed to
 the suggestion; his thoughts, and any credit that came from the
 thoughts, are his friend's as much as his <a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="green">p. 181</font></a> own. We happen to hear from
 the Christian Theodoret (<i>Hist.</i> iii. 11) that on one occasion when
 Julian was nearly goaded into persecution of the Christians, it was
 Sallustius who recalled him to their fixed policy of toleration.</p>
 
 <p>Sallustius then may be taken to represent in the most authoritative way
 the Pagan reaction of Julian's time, in its final struggle against
 Christianity.</p>
 
 <p>He was, roughly speaking, a Neo-Platonist. But it is not as a professed
 philosopher that he writes. It is only that Neo-Platonism had permeated
 the whole atmosphere of the age.<a name="an_fr_181_1"></a><a href="fsgr09.htm#an_fn_181_1">181_1</a> The strife of the philosophical
 sects had almost ceased. Just as Julian's mysticism made all gods and
 almost all forms of worship into one, so his enthusiasm for Hellenism
 revered, nay, idolized, almost all the great philosophers of the past.
 They were all trying to say the same ineffable thing; all lifting
 mankind towards the knowledge of God. I say 'almost' in both cases; for
 the Christians are outside the pale in one domain and the Epicureans and
 a few Cynics in the other. Both had committed the cardinal sin; they had
 denied the gods. They are sometimes lumped together as <i>Atheoi</i>.
 <i>L'athéisme, voilà l'ennemi.</i></p>
 
 <p>This may surprise us at first sight, but the explanation is easy. To
 Julian the one great truth that matters is the presence and glory of the
 gods. No <a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="green">p. 182</font></a> doubt, they are all ultimately one: they are <ins class="greek" title="dynameis">δυνάμεις</ins>,
 'forces,' not persons, but for reasons above our comprehension they are
 manifest only under conditions of form, time, and personality, and have
 so been revealed and worshipped and partly known by the great minds of
 the past. In Julian's mind the religious emotion itself becomes the
 thing to live for. Every object that has been touched by that emotion is
 thereby glorified and made sacred. Every shrine where men have
 worshipped in truth of heart is thereby a house of God. The worship may
 be mixed up with all sorts of folly, all sorts of unedifying practice.
 Such things must be purged away, or, still better, must be properly
 understood. For to the pure all things are pure: and the myths that
 shock the vulgar are noble allegories to the wise and reverent. Purge
 religion from dross, if you like; but remember that you do so at your
 peril. One false step, one self-confident rejection of a thing which is
 merely too high for you to grasp, and you are darkening the Sun, casting
 God out of the world. And that was just what the Christians deliberately
 did. In many of the early Christian writings denial is a much greater
 element than assertion. The beautiful <i>Octavius</i> of Minucius Felix
 (about <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 130-60) is an example. Such denial was, of course, to our
 judgement, eminently needed, and rendered a great service to the world.
 But to Julian it seemed impiety. In other Christian writings the
 misrepresentation of pagan rites and beliefs is decidedly foul-mouthed
 and malicious. Quite apart from his personal wrongs and his contempt for
 the character of Constantius, Julian could have no sympathy for <a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="green">p. 183</font></a> men who
 overturned altars and heaped blasphemy on old deserted shrines, defilers
 of every sacred object that was not protected by popularity. The most
 that such people could expect from him was that they should not be
 proscribed by law.</p>
 
 <p>But meantime what were the multitudes of the god-fearing to believe? The
 arm of the state was not very strong or effective. Labour as he might to
 supply good teaching to all provincial towns, Julian could not hope to
 educate the poor and ignorant to understand Plato and M. Aurelius. For
 them, he seems to say, all that is necessary is that they should be
 pious and god-fearing in their own way. But for more or less educated
 people, not blankly ignorant, and yet not professed students of
 philosophy, there might be some simple and authoritative treatise
 issued—a sort of reasoned creed, to lay down in a convincing manner the
 outlines of the old Hellenic religion, before the Christians and
 Atheists should have swept all fear of the gods from off the earth.</p>
 
 <p>The treatise is this work of Sallustius.</p>
 
 <hr style="width: 45%;">
 
 <p>The Christian fathers from Minucius Felix onward have shown us what was
 the most vulnerable point of Paganism: the traditional mythology.
 Sallustius deals with it at once. The <i>Akroâtês</i>, or pupil, he says in
 Section 1, needs some preliminary training. He should have been well
 brought up, should not be incurably stupid, and should not have been
 familiarized with foolish fables. Evidently the mythology was not to be
 taught to children. He enunciates certain postulates of religious
 thought, viz. that God is always good and not subject to passion or to
 <a name="page_184"><font size="1" color="green">p. 184</font></a> change, and then proceeds straight to the traditional myths. In the
 first place, he insists that they are what he calls 'divine'. That is,
 they are inspired or have some touch of divine truth in them. This is
 proved by the fact that they have been uttered, and sometimes invented,
 by the most inspired poets and philosophers and by the gods themselves
 in oracles—a very characteristic argument.</p>
 
 <p>The myths are all expressions of God and of the goodness of God; but
 they follow the usual method of divine revelation, to wit, mystery and
 allegory. The myths state clearly the one tremendous fact that the Gods
 <i>are</i>; that is what Julian cared about and the Christians denied: <i>what</i>
 they are the myths reveal only to those who have understanding. 'The
 world itself is a great myth, in which bodies and inanimate things are
 visible, souls and minds invisible.'</p>
 
 <p>'But, admitting all this, how comes it that the myths are so often
 absurd and even immoral?' For the usual purpose of mystery and allegory;
 in order to make people think. The soul that wishes to know God must
 make its own effort; it cannot expect simply to lie still and be told.
 The myths by their obvious falsity and absurdity on the surface
 stimulate the mind capable of religion to probe deeper.</p>
 
 <p>He proceeds to give instances, and chooses at once myths that had been
 for generations the mock of the sceptic, and in his own day furnished
 abundant ammunition for the artillery of Christian polemic. He takes
 first Hesiod's story of Kronos swallowing his children; then the
 Judgement of Paris; then comes <a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="green">p. 185</font></a> a long and earnest explanation of the
 myth of Attis and the Mother of the Gods. It is on the face of it a
 story highly discreditable both to the heart and the head of those
 august beings, and though the rites themselves do not seem to have been
 in any way improper, the Christians naturally attacked the Pagans and
 Julian personally for countenancing the worship. Sallustius's
 explanation is taken directly from Julian's fifth oration in praise of
 the Great Mother, and reduces the myth and the ritual to an expression
 of the adventures of the Soul seeking God.</p>
 
 <p>So much for the whole traditional mythology. It has been explained
 completely away and made subservient to philosophy and edification,
 while it can still be used as a great well-spring of religious emotion.
 For the explanations given by Sallustius and Julian are never
 rationalistic. They never stimulate a spirit of scepticism, always a
 spirit of mysticism and reverence. And, lest by chance even this
 reverent theorizing should have been somehow lacking in insight or true
 piety, Sallustius ends with the prayer: 'When I say these things
 concerning the myths, may the gods themselves and the spirits of those
 who wrote the myths be gracious to me.'</p>
 
 <p>He now leaves mythology and turns to the First Cause. It must be one,
 and it must be present in all things. Thus, it cannot be Life, for, if
 it were, all things would be alive. By a Platonic argument in which he
 will still find some philosophers to follow him, he proves that
 everything which exists, exists because of some goodness in it; and thus
 arrives at the conclusion that the First Cause is <ins class="greek" title="to agathon">τὸ ἀγαθόν</ins>, the
 Good.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="green">p. 186</font></a> </p><p>The gods are emanations or forces issuing from the Good; the makers of
 this world are secondary gods; above them are the makers of the makers,
 above all the One.</p>
 
 <p>Next comes a proof that the world is eternal—a very important point of
 doctrine; next that the soul is immortal; next a definition of the
 workings of Divine Providence, Fate, and Fortune—a fairly skilful piece
 of dialectic dealing with a hopeless difficulty. Next come Virtue and
 Vice, and, in a dead and perfunctory echo of Plato's <i>Republic</i>, an
 enumeration of the good and bad forms of human society. The questions
 which vibrated with life in free Athens had become meaningless to a
 despot-governed world. Then follows more adventurous matter.</p>
 
 <p>First a chapter headed: 'Whence Evil things come, and that there is no
 <i>Phusis Kakou</i>—Evil is not a real thing.' 'It is perhaps best', he
 says, 'to observe at once that, since the gods are good and make
 everything, there is no positive evil; there is only absence of good;
 just as there is no positive darkness, only absence of light.'</p>
 
 <p>What we call 'evils' arise only in the activities of men, and even here
 no one ever does evil for the sake of evil. 'One who indulges in some
 pleasant vice thinks the vice bad but his pleasure good; a murderer
 thinks the murder bad, but the money he will get by it, good; one who
 injures an enemy thinks the injury bad, but the being quits with his
 enemy, good'; and so on. The evil acts are all done for the sake of some
 good, but human souls, being very far removed from the original flawless
 divine nature, <a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="green">p. 187</font></a> make mistakes or sins. One of the great objects of the
 world, he goes on to explain, of gods, men, and spirits, of religious
 institutions and human laws alike, is to keep the souls from these
 errors and to purge them again when they have fallen.</p>
 
 <p>Next comes a speculative difficulty. Sallustius has called the world
 'eternal in the fullest sense'—that is, it always has been and always
 will be. And yet it is 'made' by the gods. How are these statements
 compatible? If it was made, there must have been a time before it was
 made. The answer is ingenious. It is not made by handicraft as a table
 is; it is not begotten as a son by a father. It is the result of a
 quality of God just as light is the result of a quality of the sun. The
 sun causes light, but the light is there as soon as the sun is there.
 The world is simply the other side, as it were, of the goodness of God,
 and has existed as long as that goodness has existed.</p>
 
 <p>Next come some simpler questions about man's relation to the gods. In
 what sense do we say that the gods are angry with the wicked or are
 appeased by repentance? Sallustius is quite firm. The gods cannot ever
 be glad—for that which is glad is also sorry; cannot be angry—for
 anger is a passion; and obviously they cannot be appeased by gifts or
 prayers. Even men, if they are honest, require higher motives than that.
 God is unchangeable, always good, always doing good. If we are good, we
 are nearer to the gods, and we feel it; if we are evil, we are separated
 further from them. It is not they that are angry, it is our sins that
 hide them from us and prevent the goodness of God from shining into us.
 <a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="green">p. 188</font></a> If we repent, again, we do not make any change in God; we only, by the
 conversion of our soul towards the divine, heal our own badness and
 enjoy again the goodness of the gods. To say that the gods turn away
 from the wicked, would be like saying that the sun turns away from a
 blind man.</p>
 
 <p>Why then do we make offerings and sacrifices to the gods, when the gods
 need nothing and can have nothing added to them? We do so in order to
 have more communion with the gods. The whole temple service, in fact, is
 an elaborate allegory, a representation of the divine government of the
 world.</p>
 
 <p>The custom of sacrificing animals had died out some time before this.
 The Jews of the Dispersion had given it up long since because the Law
 forbade any such sacrifice outside the Temple.<a name="an_fr_188_1"></a><a href="fsgr09.htm#an_fn_188_1">188_1</a> When Jerusalem was
 destroyed Jewish sacrifice ceased altogether. The Christians seem from
 the beginning to have generally followed the Jewish practice. But
 sacrifice was in itself not likely to continue in a society of large
 towns. It meant turning your temples into very ill-conducted
 slaughter-houses, and was also associated with a great deal of muddled
 and indiscriminate charity.<a name="an_fr_188_2"></a><a href="fsgr09.htm#an_fn_188_2">188_2</a> One might have hoped that men so
 high-minded and spiritual as Julian and Sallustius would have considered
 this practice unnecessary or even have reformed it away. But no. It was
 part of the genuine Hellenic tradition; and <a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="green">p. 189</font></a> no jot or tittle of that
 tradition should, if they could help it, be allowed to die. Sacrifice is
 desirable, argues Sallustius, because it is a gift of life. God has
 given us life, as He has given us all else. We must therefore pay to Him
 some emblematic tithe of life. Again, prayers in themselves are merely
 words; but with sacrifice they are words plus life, Living Words.
 Lastly, we are Life of a sort, and God is Life of an infinitely higher
 sort. To approach Him we need always a medium or a mediator; the medium
 between life and life must needs be life. We find that life in the
 sacrificed animal.<a name="an_fr_189_1"></a><a href="fsgr09.htm#an_fn_189_1">189_1</a></p>
 
 <p>The argument shows what ingenuity these religious men had at their
 command, and what trouble they would take to avoid having to face a fact
 and reform a bad system.</p>
 
 <p>There follows a long and rather difficult argument to show that the
 world is, in itself, eternal. The former discussion on this point had
 only shown that the gods would not destroy it. This shows that its own
 nature is indestructible. The arguments are very inconclusive, though
 clever, and one wonders why the author is at so much pains. Indeed, he
 is so earnest that at the end of the chapter he finds it necessary to
 apologize to the Kosmos in case his language should have been
 indiscreet. The reason, I think, is that the Christians were still, as
 in apostolic times, pinning their faith to the approaching end of <a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="green">p. 190</font></a> the
 world by fire.<a name="an_fr_190_1"></a><a href="fsgr09.htm#an_fn_190_1">190_1</a> They announced the end of the world as near, and
 they rejoiced in the prospect of its destruction. History has shown more
 than once what terrible results can be produced by such beliefs as these
 in the minds of excitable and suffering populations, especially those of
 eastern blood. It was widely believed that Christian fanatics had from
 time to time actually tried to light fires which should consume the
 accursed world and thus hasten the coming of the kingdom which should
 bring such incalculable rewards to their own organization and plunge the
 rest of mankind in everlasting torment. To any respectable Pagan such
 action was an insane crime made worse by a diabolical motive. The
 destruction of the world, therefore, seems to have become a subject of
 profound irritation, if not actually of terror. At any rate the doctrine
 lay at the very heart of the <i>perniciosa superstitio</i>, and Sallustius
 uses his best dialectic against it.</p>
 
 <p>The title of Chapter XVIII has a somewhat pathetic ring: 'Why are
 <i>Atheïai</i>'—Atheisms or rejections of God—'permitted, and that God is
 not injured thereby?' <ins class="greek" title="Theos ou blaptetai.">Θεὸς οὐ βλάπτεται.</ins> 'If over certain parts of
 the world there have occurred (and will occur more hereafter) rejections
 of the gods, a wise man need not be disturbed at that.' We have always
 known that the human soul was prone to error. God's providence is there;
 but we cannot expect all men at all times <a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="green">p. 191</font></a> and places to enjoy it
 equally. In the human body it is only the eye that sees the light, the
 rest of the body is ignorant of the light. So are many parts of the
 earth ignorant of God.</p>
 
 <p>Very likely, also, this rejection of God is a punishment. Persons who in
 a previous life have known the gods but disregarded them, are perhaps
 now born, as it were, blind, unable to see God; persons who have
 committed the blasphemy of worshipping their own kings as gods may
 perhaps now be cast out from the knowledge of God.</p>
 
 <p>Philosophy had always rejected the Man-God, especially in the form of
 King-worship; but opposition to Christianity no doubt intensifies the
 protest.</p>
 
 <p>The last chapter is very short. 'Souls that have lived in virtue, being
 otherwise blessed and especially separated from their irrational part
 and purged of all body, are joined with the gods and sway the whole
 world together with them.' So far triumphant faith: then the
 after-thought of the brave man who means to live his best life even if
 faith fail him. 'But even if none of these rewards came to them, still
 Virtue itself and the Joy and Glory of Virtue, and the Life that is
 subject to no grief and no master, would be enough to make blessed those
 who have set themselves to live in Virtue and have succeeded.'</p>

 <p>There the book ends. It ends upon that well-worn paradox which, from the
 second book of the <i>Republic</i> onwards, seems to have brought so much
 comfort to the nobler spirits of the ancient world. Strange how we
 moderns cannot rise to it! We seem simply to lack the intensity of moral
 enthusiasm. When we <a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="green">p. 192</font></a> speak of martyrs being happy on the rack; in the
 first place we rarely believe it, and in the second we are usually
 supposing that the rack will soon be over and that harps and golden
 crowns will presently follow. The ancient moralist believed that the
 good man was happy then and there, because the joy, being in his soul,
 was not affected by the torture of his body.<a name="an_fr_192_1"></a><a href="fsgr09.htm#an_fn_192_1">192_1</a></p>
 
 <p>Not being able fully to feel this conviction, we naturally incline to
 think it affected or unreal. But, taking the conditions of the ancient
 world into account, we must admit that the men who uttered this belief
 at least understood better than most of us what suffering was. Many of
 them were slaves, many had been captives of war. They knew what they
 were talking about. I think, on a careful study of M. Aurelius,
 Epictetus, and some of these Neo-Platonic philosophers, that we shall be
 forced to realize that these men could rise to much the same heights of
 religious heroism as the Catholic saints of the Middle Age, and that
 they often did so—if I may use such a phrase—on a purer and thinner
 diet of sensuous emotion, with less wallowing in the dust and less
 delirium.</p>
 
 <p>Be that as it may, we have now seen in outline the kind of religion
 which ancient Paganism had become at the time of its final reaction
 against Christianity. It is a more or less intelligible whole, and
 succeeds better than most religions in combining two great appeals. It
 appeals to the philosopher and the thoughtful man as a fairly complete
 and rational <a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="green">p. 193</font></a> system of thought, which speculative and enlightened minds
 in any age might believe without disgrace. I do not mean that it is
 probably true; to me all these overpowering optimisms which, by means of
 a few untested <i>a priori</i> postulates, affect triumphantly to disprove
 the most obvious facts of life, seem very soon to become meaningless. I
 conceive it to be no comfort at all, to a man suffering agonies of
 frostbite, to be told by science that cold is merely negative and does
 not exist. So far as the statement is true it is irrelevant; so far as
 it pretends to be relevant it is false. I only mean that a system like
 that of Sallustius is, judged by any standard, high, civilized, and
 enlightened.</p>
 
 <p>At the same time this religion appeals to the ignorant and the
 humble-minded. It takes from the pious villager no single object of
 worship that has turned his thoughts heavenwards. It may explain and
 purge; it never condemns or ridicules. In its own eyes that was its
 great glory, in the eyes of history perhaps its most fatal weakness.
 Christianity, apart from its positive doctrines, had inherited from
 Judaism the noble courage of its disbeliefs.</p>
 
 <p>To compare this Paganism in detail with its great rival would be, even
 if I possessed the necessary learning, a laborious and unsatisfactory
 task. But if a student with very imperfect knowledge may venture a
 personal opinion on this obscure subject, it seems to me that we often
 look at such problems from a wrong angle. Harnack somewhere, in
 discussing the comparative success or failure of various early Christian
 sects, makes the illuminating remark that the main determining cause in
 each case was not their <a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="green">p. 194</font></a> comparative reasonableness of doctrine or skill
 in controversy—for they practically never converted one another—but
 simply the comparative increase or decrease of the birth-rate in the
 respective populations. On somewhat similar lines it always appears to
 me that, historically speaking, the character of Christianity in these
 early centuries is to be sought not so much in the doctrines which it
 professed, nearly all of which had their roots and their close parallels
 in older Hellenistic or Hebrew thought, but in the organization on which
 it rested. For my own part, when I try to understand Christianity as a
 mass of doctrines, Gnostic, Trinitarian, Monophysite, Arian and the
 rest, I get no further. When I try to realize it as a sort of
 semi-secret society for mutual help with a mystical religious basis,
 resting first on the proletariates of Antioch and the great commercial
 and manufacturing towns of the Levant, then spreading by instinctive
 sympathy to similar classes in Rome and the West, and rising in
 influence, like certain other mystical cults, by the special appeal it
 made to women, the various historical puzzles begin to fall into place.
 Among other things this explains the strange subterranean power by which
 the emperor Diocletian was baffled, and to which the pretender
 Constantine had to capitulate; it explains its humanity, its intense
 feeling of brotherhood within its own bounds, its incessant care for the
 poor, and also its comparative indifference to the virtues which are
 specially incumbent on a governing class, such as statesmanship,
 moderation, truthfulness, active courage, learning, culture, and public
 spirit. Of course, such indifference was only <a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="green">p. 195</font></a> comparative. After the
 time of Constantine the governing classes come into the fold, bringing
 with them their normal qualities, and thereafter it is Paganism, not
 Christianity, that must uphold the flag of a desperate fidelity in the
 face of a hostile world—a task to which, naturally enough, Paganism was
 not equal. But I never wished to pit the two systems against one
 another. The battle is over, and it is poor work to jeer at the wounded
 and the dead. If we read the literature of the time, especially some
 records of the martyrs under Diocletian, we shall at first perhaps
 imagine that, apart from some startling exceptions, the conquered party
 were all vicious and hateful, the conquerors, all wise and saintly.
 Then, looking a little deeper, we shall see that this great controversy
 does not stand altogether by itself. As in other wars, each side had its
 wise men and its foolish, its good men and its evil. Like other
 conquerors these conquerors were often treacherous and brutal; like
 other vanquished these vanquished have been tried at the bar of history
 without benefit of counsel, have been condemned in their absence and
 died with their lips sealed. The polemic literature of Christianity is
 loud and triumphant, the books of the Pagans have been destroyed.</p>
 
 <p>Only an ignorant man will pronounce a violent or bitter judgement here.
 The minds that are now tender, timid, and reverent in their orthodoxy
 would probably in the third or fourth century have sided with the old
 gods; those of more daring and puritan temper with the Christians. The
 historian will only try to have sympathy and understanding for both.
 They are all dead now, Diocletian and Ignatius, <a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="green">p. 196</font></a> Cyril and Hypatia,
 Julian and Basil, Athanasius and Arîus: every party has yielded up its
 persecutors and its martyrs, its hates and slanders and aspirations and
 heroisms, to the arms of that great Silence whose secrets they all
 claimed so loudly to have read. Even the dogmas for which they fought
 might seem to be dead too. For if Julian and Sallustius, Gregory and
 John Chrysostom, were to rise again and see the world as it now is, they
 would probably feel their personal differences melt away in comparison
 with the vast difference between their world and this. They fought to
 the death about this credo and that, but the same spirit was in all of
 them. In the words of one who speaks with greater knowledge than mine,
 'the most inward man in these four contemporaries is the same. It is the
 Spirit of the Fourth Century.'<a name="an_fr_196_1"></a><a href="fsgr09.htm#an_fn_196_1">196_1</a></p>

 <p>'Dieselbe Seelenstimmung, derselbe Spiritualismus'; also the same
 passionate asceticism. All through antiquity the fight against luxury
 was a fiercer and stronger fight than comes into our modern experience.
 There was not more objective luxury in any period of ancient history
 than there is now; there was never anything like so much. But there does
 seem to have been more subjective abandonment to physical pleasure and
 concomitantly a stronger protest against it. From some time before the
 Christian era it seems as if the subconscious instinct of humanity was
 slowly rousing itself for a great revolt against the long intolerable
 tyranny of the senses over the soul, and by the fourth century <a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></a> the
 revolt threatened to become all-absorbing. The Emperor Julian was
 probably as proud of his fireless cell and the crowding lice in his
 beard and cassock as an average Egyptian monk. The ascetic movement
 grew, as we all know, to be measureless and insane. It seemed to be
 almost another form of lust, and to have the same affinities with
 cruelty. But it has probably rendered priceless help to us who come
 afterwards. The insane ages have often done service for the sane, the
 harsh and suffering ages for the gentle and well-to-do.</p>
 
 <p><i>Sophrosynê</i>, however we try to translate it, temperance, gentleness,
 the spirit that in any trouble thinks and is patient, that saves and not
 destroys, is the right spirit. And it is to be feared that none of these
 fourth-century leaders, neither the fierce bishops with their homilies
 on Charity, nor Julian and Sallustius with their worship of Hellenism,
 came very near to that classic ideal. To bring back that note of
 Sophrosynê I will venture, before proceeding to the fourth-century Pagan
 creed, to give some sentences from an earlier Pagan prayer. It is cited
 by Stobaeus from a certain Eusebius, a late Ionic Platonist of whom
 almost nothing is known, not even the date at which he lived.<a name="an_fr_197_1"></a><a href="fsgr09.htm#an_fn_197_1">197_1</a> But
 the voice sounds like that of a stronger and more sober age.</p>
 
 <div class="blockquot"><p>'May I be no man's enemy,' it begins, 'and may I be the friend
 of that which is eternal and abides. May I never quarrel with
 those nearest to me; and if I do, may I be reconciled quickly.
 May I never devise evil against any man; if any devise evil
 <a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="green">p. 198</font></a> against me, may I escape uninjured and without the need of
 hurting him. May I love, seek, and attain only that which is
 good. May I wish for all men's happiness and envy none. May I
 never rejoice in the ill-fortune of one who has wronged me. . . .
 When I have done or said what is wrong, may I never wait for
 the rebuke of others, but always rebuke myself until I make
 amends. . . . May I win no victory that harms either me or my
 opponent. . . . May I reconcile friends who are wroth with one
 another. May I, to the extent of my power, give all needful
 help to my friends and to all who are in want. May I never
 fail a friend in danger. When visiting those in grief may I be
 able by gentle and healing words to soften their pain. . . . May
 I respect myself. . . . May I always keep tame that which rages
 within me. . . . May I accustom myself to be gentle, and never be
 angry with people because of circumstances. May I never
 discuss who is wicked and what wicked things he has done, but
 know good men and follow in their footsteps.'</p></div>
 
 <p>There is more of it. How unpretending it is and yet how searching! And
 in the whole there is no petition for any material blessing, and—most
 striking of all—it is addressed to no personal god. It is pure prayer.
 Of course, to some it will feel thin and cold. Most men demand of their
 religion more outward and personal help, more physical ecstasy, a more
 heady atmosphere of illusion. No one man's attitude towards the
 Uncharted can be quite the same as his neighbour's. In part
 instinctively, in part superficially and self-consciously, each
 generation of mankind reacts against the last. The grown man turns from
 the lights that were thrust upon his eyes in <a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="green">p. 199</font></a> childhood. The son shrugs
 his shoulders at the watchwords that thrilled his father, and with
 varying degrees of sensitiveness or dullness, of fuller or more
 fragmentary experience, writes out for himself the manuscript of his
 creed. Yet, even for the wildest or bravest rebel, that manuscript is
 only a palimpsest. On the surface all is new writing, clean and
 self-assertive. Underneath, dim but indelible in the very fibres of the
 parchment, lie the characters of many ancient aspirations and raptures
 and battles which his conscious mind has rejected or utterly forgotten.
 And forgotten things, if there be real life in them, will sometimes
 return out of the dust, vivid to help still in the forward groping of
 humanity. A religious system like that of Eusebius or Marcus, or even
 Sallustius, was not built up without much noble life and strenuous
 thought and a steady passion for the knowledge of God. Things of that
 make do not, as a rule, die for ever.</p>
