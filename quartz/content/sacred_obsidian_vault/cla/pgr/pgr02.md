 <p>Mr Raskin on the absence of fear in the Greek genius. Religion, to writers of the fifth century B.C., mainly a matter of festivals.

Distinction drawn by Isocrates and others between Olympian and apotropaic ritual. Contrast between 'Tendance' (θεραπεία) and 'Aversion' (ἀποτροπή). Sacrifice to Zeus in Homer is a banquet shared.

The 'Dian' fleece, not the 'fleece of Zeus' but the fleece of magical purification. Examination of the Attic calendar. The names of festivals not connected with the names of Olympian divinities. The ritual of these festivals belongs to a more primitive stratum than that of the Olympians, pp. <a href="pgr03.htm#page_1">1</a>-<a href="pgr03.htm#page_31">31</a>.</p>  <h3 align="center">CHAPTER II.</h3>  <h3 align="center">THE ANTHESTERIA.
