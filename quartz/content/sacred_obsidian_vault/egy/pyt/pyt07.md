 <p>134a. O N., thou didst not depart dead; thou didst depart living,</p>
 
 <p>134b. (so) thou sittest upon the throne of Osiris, thy <i>bȝ</i>-sceptre in thy hand, thou commandest the living;</p>
 
 <p>134c. (thy) <i>mkś</i>-sceptre and thy <i>nḥb.t</i>-sceptre in thy hand, commanding
 those of secret places.</p>
 
 <p>135a. Thine arm is like that of Atum; thy shoulders are like those of Atum;
 thy body is like that of Atum; thy back is like that of Atum;</p>
 
 <p>135b. thy seat is like that of Atum; thy legs are like those of Atum; thy

 <p>137a. Go after (pursue) thy sun (days); purify thyself,</p>
 
 <p>137b. (for) thy bones are (those of) female-falcons, goddesses, who are in
 heaven,</p>
 
 <p>137c. that thou mayest be at the side of the god; that thou mayest leave thy
 house to thy son</p>
 
 <p>137d. who is thine heir. Everyone who speaks, evil against the name of N.,</p>
 
 <p>138a. when he ascends, Geb reckons him as an evil-doer in his own city,</p>
 
 <p>138b. so that he weakens, he falters. Thou purifiest thyself in the dew of
 the stars;</p>
 
 <p>138c. thou descendest on firm (copper?) cables, on the shoulders of Horus in
 his name of "He who is in the <i>Ḥnw</i>-boat."</p>

 bore thee (away).</p>
 
 <p>139b. Enter the abode of thy father, to the abode of Geb,</p>
 
 <p>139c. that he may give to thee that which is on the brow of Horus, that thou

 <p>140a. O N.,</p>
 
 <p>140b. let thy messengers go; let thine envoys hasten to thy father, to Atum.</p>
 
 <p>140c. Atum, let him ascend to thee; enfold him in thine embrace,</p>
 
 <p>141a. (for) there is no god, (who has become) a star, who has not his
 companion. Shall I be thy companion?</p>
 
 <p>146. Look (at me); thou hast regarded the form of the children of their
 fathers,</p>
 
 <p>141c. who know their speech. (They are now) imperishable stars.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a></p>
 
 <p>141d. (So) shalt thou see those who are in the palace, (that is) Horus and

 earth quakes." [Thou art conceived, O Set, as one whose name is] "Him
 at whom heaven trembles."</p>
 
 <p>143b. That one (Horus) has not a mutilation; this one (Set) has not an
 injury; this one (Set) has not an injury; that one (Horus) has not a
 mutilation.</p>
 
 <p>144a. Thou art born, Horus, of Osiris; thou art more <i>ba</i> than he, thou art more <i>śḫm</i>
 than he.</p>
 
 <p>144b. Thou art conceived, Set by Geb; thou art more <i>ba</i> than he, thou art more <i>śḫm</i>
 than he.</p>
 
 <p>145a. No seed of a god, which belongs to him, goes to ruin; so thou who
 belongest to him wilt not go to ruin.</p>
 
 <p>145b. Rē-Atum does not surrender thee to Osiris. He judges (lit. numbers)
 not thy heart; he gains not power over thy heart.</p>
 
 <p>145c. Rē-Atum does not surrender thee to Horus. He judges (lit. numbers)
 not thy heart; he gains not power over thy heart.</p>
 
 <p>146a. Osiris, thou dost not gain power over him (Set); thy son gains not
 power over him.</p>
 
 <p>146b. Horus, thou dost not gain power over him (Set); thy father gains not
 power over him.</p>
 
 <p>147a. Thou belongest, O <i>mn</i>, to
 that god, of whom the twin-children of Atum said (to him):</p>
 
 <p>147b. "Arise," said they, "in thy name of god"--and so
 thou becomest an Atum to (of) every god:</p>

 <p>148d. Thy nose is (that of) Anubis, O Imperishable. Thy teeth are (those of)
 Sopdu, O Imperishable.</p>
 
 <p>149a. Thine arms are <i>Hp</i> and <i>Dwȝ-mw.t.f</i>, which thou needest to
 ascend to heaven, when thou ascendest;</p>
 
 <p>149b. thy legs are <i>Imś.ti</i> and <i>Ḳbḥ-śn.w.f</i>, which thou needest to
 descend to the lower heaven (underworld) when thou descendest.</p>
 
 <p>149c. Thy (other) members are the twin-children of Atum, O Imperishable.</p>
 
 <p>149d. Thou perishest not, thy <i>ka</i>
