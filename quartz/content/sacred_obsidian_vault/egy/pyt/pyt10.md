 (here); his magic power has equipped him.</p>
 
 <p>251a. Thou openest thy place in heaven, among the stars of heaven;</p>

 <p align="center"><i>Utterance
 246</i>.</p>
 
 <p>252a. See, how N. stands there among (you), the two horns on him (like) two
 wild-bulls,</p>
 
 <p>252b. for thou art the black ram, son of a black sheep.</p>
 
 <p>252c. born of a white sheep, nursed by four sheep.</p>
 
 <p>253a. The blue-eyed Horus comes against you; guard yourselves against the
 red-eyed Horus,</p>
 
 <p>253b. furious in wrath, whose might no one withstands.</p>

 <p>253d. They announce to him who lifts up his arm in the East</p>
 
 <p>254a. that this One passes in thee of whom <i>Dwn-n.wi</i> said: "He shall command my (?) fathers, the
 gods."</p>
 
 <p>254b. The gods are silent before thee; the Ennead lay their hands upon their
 mouth,</p>

 of his Ennead--</p>
 
 <p>255c. they (the gods) enter, they are smitten with fear; they depart, they
 lift up their head.</p>
 
 <p>256a. They see thee like Min, chief of the two <i>itr.t</i>-palaces.</p>

 relative (nś) stands behind thee.</p>
 
 <p>256c. Thou perishest not; thou art not destroyed.</p>

 <p>258b. Geb has created thee; the Ennead have engendered thee.</p>

 years.</p>

 <p>259b. N, O (thou) who hast heard; N., O N., (thou) who hast been there;</p>
 
 <p>260a. N., O N., lift thee up upon thy side, (thou) doer of command;</p>
 
 <p>260b. (thou) who hatest sleep, (thou) who art made tired, stand up, (thou)
 who art in <i>Ndi.t</i>.</p>
 
 <p>260c. Thy fine bread is made (i.e. offered, cf. CT, I Spell 67, 286b) in
 Buto; take thy power in Heliopolis.</p>
 
 <p>261a. This Horus commanded to do (this) for his father. The lord of tempest
 prevented the saliva of Set,</p>
 
 <p>261b. when he (Set) should carry thee. It is he who will carry the one who
 is (again) complete.</p>
