 <h1 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h1>
 
 <p>The famous Pyramid Texts herein translated for the first time
 in English with commentary were found inscribed on the walls of five pyramids
 at Saḳḳâreh, the ancient necropolis of Memphis
 in Egypt.
 These pyramids are those of the kings Unis of the Fifth Dynasty, and Teti, Pepi
 I, Merenrē and Pepi II of the Sixth Dynasty. To this translation has been
 added that of recently discovered additional texts, parallel and complementary,
 in the pyramids of Oudjebten, Neit, and Apouit, queens of Pepi II, and of Ibi,
 a king of the Seventh Dynasty, of whom little historically is known. Thus,
 according to the present generally accepted chronology, these pyramids were
 constructed, and apparently inscribed, between the years about 2350 to 2175
 B.C. It is, however, certain that many of these texts came into existence
 before the final union of Upper and Lower Egypt,
 and perhaps long before that date, which is now put at about 3000 B.C. Indeed,
 some of them possibly existed in oral form before the art of writing was
 developed. These inscriptions together with others were after that probably
 written on papyrus and potsherds, many of which in time perished, the rest
 remaining in various forms until they were collected and incised on the walls
 of the Saḳḳâreh h pyramids. Evidence of a date previous to about 3000 B.C. is
 seen in passages which reflect events and conditions previous to the union of
 the two Lands, for example, the hostility between North and South, before the
 time of the first king, Menes; in the mode of burying bodies of the dead in the
 sand; in the pre-civilized era reflected in the so-called Cannibal Hymn; and in
 the many references to the assembling of the bones of the deceased, passages
 which indicate a pre-mummification period. And in the historic period various
 chronological points can be established with fair certainty, such as the time
 of the Second Dynasty, when both Horus and Set were in favour in royal circles;
 references to previously written material such as the "Chapter of those
 who ascend" and the "Chapter of those who raise themselves up,"
 1245d-e, indicating a time in the historic period in which writing became
 common; and the formulae for the protection of pyramids, such as, Uts. 600-601,
 which represent a date after the time of the</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_2"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 2</font></a></p>
 
 <p>construction of pyramids. So that the myths and legends, the history and
 philosophy, the hopes and fears of people (subjects as well as monarchs) of
 many hundreds of years were finally inscribed in enduring stone, which over
 four thousand years removed from our time, may now be read with comparative
 ease and certainty, thanks to the modern discipline of archaeological research
 and philology. The extent of this written material may be appreciated in saying
 that it takes well over a thousand pages of two quarto volumes to contain it.
 In the standard modern edition of the original text, together with parallels
 and additions from the pyramids of Pepi II, Neit, and others, there are about
 7000 lines, most of which are parallels, of more or less completeness of the
 estimated 2500 lines, which occur in one or other of the pyramids; for most of
 the utterances occur in more than one pyramid, but very few are repeated in all
 these pyramids. Thus, the pyramid of Unis has only two hundred and eight
 utterances out of a total of over seven hundred and thirty; and they with those
 of the pyramid of Teti are among the oldest in the collection.</p>
 
 <p>A general idea of the contents of this mass of literary material may be seen
 in the detailed list of Contents preceding this Introduction; but that does not
 mean that these texts present a coherent whole, for they do not; and while
 there are clearly three outstanding elements in them, namely, Solar Theology,
 Religion and Myths of Osiris, and the Political unification of Upper and Lower
 Egypt, yet the following seven points may be taken to represent the whole
 collection with fair general accuracy: 1) A funerary ritual of mortuary
 offerings, connected with the corporeal reconstitution and resurrection of the
 deceased king, 2) Magical formulae to ward against harm and evil, 3) A ritual
 of worship, 4) Religious hymns, 5) Mythical formulae, identifying the deceased
 king with certain deities, 6) Prayers and petitions on behalf of the deceased
 king, and 7) The greatness and power of the deceased king in heaven.</p>
 
 <p>These pyramid texts were royal texts, and during the Old
  Kingdom there is no evidence that the people ever took them to
 themselves and used them in their own tombs. However, at the end of the Sixth
 Dynasty, Neit, one of the queens of Pepi II, had them applied to herself,
 though the second person and third person masculine singular were often used
 and applied to her; but during the Middle Kingdom the use of them spread to the
 nobles, and in the New Kingdom parts of them were incorporated in the popular
 Theban Book of the Dead.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 3</font></a></p>
 
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> And doubtless because of their sanctity little attempt was made to put
 them in accord with changed circumstances.</p>
 
 <p>When these small pyramids were built and inscribed the age of the great
 pyramids, like those at Giza,
 had passed, and with it the sense of royal security after this life. The great
 pyramids had been entered in spite of their thousands of tons of masonry, and
 kings came to look elsewhere for the assurance of a happy and glorious
 hereafter. They turned to religion and magic. By mortuary offerings and
 funerary rites the deceased king was armed for his future life; and by magic he
 was endowed with physical and spiritual power, becoming a great god and
 associating with the gods, to avoid whatever in the world to come might
 otherwise compromise his destiny. The purpose of these royal texts then was to
 guarantee the deceased king's resurrection and new-birth, his transfiguration
 and divinity, his successful journey to heaven, and his immortality there with
 the other gods. There in heaven as a great god, sometimes as the greatest of
 all the, gods, the deceased king was believed to be able to overcome all
 difficulties by his own might, or by identifying himself with other gods.</p>
 
 <p>In the earliest of these texts two very ancient doctrines may be discerned:
 that of the old heaven-god, perhaps Horus the elder, in which the deceased king
 as a star was prominent, and that of the sun-god where the deceased as the
 sun-god was contemplated. But the two were harmonized doubtless at a very early
 period, when the celestial abode of the heaven- and star-gods became identified
 with that of the solar deities. But what we do see more clearly in the Pyramid
 Texts are the two opposing systems of theological thought, that of Rē of Heliopolis and that of
 Osiris. The Pyramid Texts were largely solar, but long before the texts were
 inscribed in the pyramids of Saḳḳâreh, there existed Osirian texts as well as
 Solar ones, though there is reason to believe that the learned men and scribes
 of Heliopolis were the first to make collections of their texts. And gradually
 as such collections were being made, there was a tendency to include Osirian
 texts, as well as, an effort on the part of Osirians to facilitate the entrance
 of their texts into the great Solar collections (cf. Excursus XXVII), with the
 result that there was a redaction continually going on, in which not only was
 the name of Osiris introduced into the collections, especially as an epithet of
 the king, such as Osiris Teti, but also the name of the solar king was
 introduced into original Osirian texts. However, the great bulk of the texts
 remained solar and celestial with comparatively little trace of the underworld</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 4</font></a></p>
 
 <p>character of the Osirian faith. There are also traces in these texts of
 other systems of theological thought than the Heliopolitan and Osirian, namely,
 those of Memphis
 and Hermopolis.</p>
 
 <p>As one reads these ancient texts, there is a primitiveness about them which
 is not unexpected, though they are never naive. There is much repetition, not
 much order, contradictions, errors, and sometimes what appear to be ridiculous
 statements, but in spite of all that, real poetic passages and consistent
 reasoning are not lacking. There is the art to create images, figures of
 speech, and metaphores in beautiful and choice language. There are paronomasiae,
 parallelisms, litanies, and hymns. There are poetic expressions, such as
 567a-c; real lyrics, like Ut. 362; symbolical expressions, such as 681d; and
 really fine bits, like 307a-c. There are proverbs, such as 396d; and adages,
 such as 444e. The most symmetrically and mechanically arranged utterance in the
 whole collection is Ut. 575, which reminds one of Ps. 119. But the overall
 characteristic of these texts is their religious and funerary, their magical,
 mythological, and astronomic expressions, interpretations, and predispositions.</p>
 
 <p>Auguste Mariette had the distinction, in the later part of his life, of
 being the modern discoverer of the inscribed pyramids at Saḳḳâreh,, but it
 was Maspero in 1880 working under Mariette's direction, who discovered the
 first set of Pyramid Texts. They were those inscribed on the walls of the
 sarcophagus chamber of the pyramid of Pepi I. Following that, he found texts in
 the pyramids of Unis of the Fifth Dynasty, as well as in the pyramids of Teti,
 Merenrē, and Pepi II, in addition to Pepi I, all of the Sixth Dynasty. This
 work of discovery of pyramid texts did not find a continuation until the years
 1920 and 1936, when the Swiss Egyptologist, Jéquier, discovered texts in the
 pyramids of Oudjebten, Neit, and Apouit, queens of Pepi II, and in that of Ibi,
 an obscure king of the Seventh Dynasty, besides clearing that of Pepi II, whom
 Sethe records as N. (Neferkarē).</p>
 
 <p>These texts usually occupy the walls of the sarcophagus chamber except the
 west side, and are so disposed that the deceased king in his sarcophagus might
 spiritually see and read them. Texts are also on the walls of the antechamber,
 on the horizontal passages, and some are on the walls of the vestibule and even
 on those of the ramp. They are normally in vertical columns, incised on the
 limestone walls, some excellently done as in the pyramids of Unis and Pepi II,
 others very crudely done as in that of Ibi.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 5</font></a></p>
 
 <p>As Maspero was the discoverer of the Pyramid Texts, so be was the first to
 make an edition and translation of them. These were all the pyramid texts which
 were known at the time of their publication in 1894. And in view of what we now
 know about the difficulties of the Pyramid Texts, this edition and translation
 were evidence of the genius of the great master. Even today many of his
 translations accord with the best that is known on those passages, which is an
 indication of his great learning and insight.</p>
 
 <p>For years before the beginning of this century Kurt Sethe, whose name will
 be forever associated with the Pyramid Texts, was deeply interested in
 everything which concerned them. He as well as other trained Egyptologists
 realized that the earlier copy of the texts was often incorrect, and that a new
 and scientifically copied edition was a necessity. Accordingly, taking
 advantage of the work of Dr. Heintze and Ludwig Borchardt, who were in Egypt taking impressions and photographs of the
 Pyramid Texts for slips in preparation for the making of the great Berlin <i>Wörterbuch der Aegyptischen Sprache</i>,
 Sethe made use of their material in preparing a new edition of the Pyramid
 Texts. And no Egyptologist was more thoroughly prepared for such an undertaking
 than Kurt Sethe. And so he began the critical and exacting task of constructing
 a text principally on the basis of the five versions Unis, Teti, Pepi I,
 Merenrē, and Pepi II, which was finished and published in 1908-1910 in two
 great quarto volumes of over a thousand pages of hieroglyphic text, which is
 now the standard text. To accompany the text, he followed them with a third
 volume of critical apparatus in 1922 and a fourth of epigraphy in the same
 year. Thus the great work of giving to the world the text of the oldest
 collection of mythical, religious, and literary material in existence was
 finished. However, the text was marred by one blemish, but not due to the
 science of Sethe. It was due to the fact that a considerable Portion of the
 texts in the five pyramids was broken, damaged and destroyed--a condition which
 may never be completely remedied. It is along this line that Egyptologists who
 were specialists in these texts have been working since the time of Sethe.
 Already considerable progress has been made in the discovery of texts,
 anciently copied from the texts in these five pyramids, before they were
 damaged, and recorded elsewhere; in a further study of the walls of the five
 pyramids themselves; and in the discovery and publishing of new pyramids and
 tombs with parallel and additional texts, all which will be used in the future,
 but not till after many years of archaeological research</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 6</font></a></p>
 
 <p>in Egypt,
 in the construction of a more complete text. Already between 1920 and 1936
 Jéquier discovered at Saḳḳâreh similar texts in the pyramids of Oudjebten,
 Neit, and Apouit of the Sixth Dynasty and of Ibi of the Seventh Dynasty; in
 1932 the Egyptian Expedition of the Metropolitan Museum of Art discovered in
 the cemetery surrounding the pyramid of Sen-Wosret I at Lisht the tomb of an
 official of the Twelfth Dynasty named Sen-Wosret-Ankh, containing a long
 series of inscriptions drawn from the Pyramid Texts, and published in 1937; and
 in 1935 William C. Hayes published the "Royal Sarcophagi of the Eighteenth
 Dynasty," containing parts of the Pyramid Texts, which are useful in
 filling some lacunae in the Saḳḳâreh texts. Then older publications are
 useful, such as that of de Morgan in 1894-1895 of similar texts in a private
 tomb at Dahshûr; that of Firth and Gunn in 1926 of texts in the Teti Pyramid
 Cemeteries at Saḳḳâreh; and that of Borchardt in 1913 of similar texts in the
 mortuary temple
  of Sahurē at Abuṣîr.
 Then there are the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom and the Theban Book of
 the Dead of the New Kingdom, which contain Pyramid Texts in modified and
 further modified form; as well as tombs of kings, such as that of Seti I, and
 of private individuals, which contain Pyramid Texts sometimes in quite exact
 quotation. All these and others may be drawn upon in the future construction of
 a still more perfect version of the famous ancient Pyramid Texts of Saḳḳâreh.
 Quite recently T. G. Allen of the University
  of Chicago has published
 a most useful guide to all parallel and illustrative Egyptian texts at present
 known in his valuable book, <i>Occurrences
 of Pyramid Texts with cross Indexes of these and other Egyptian Mortuary Texts</i>,
 Chicago, 1950.</p>
 
 <p>After the publication of his text, Sethe's next concern was to prepare a
 translation with a commentary. The central thought in his busy years of
 research as soon as the text was published was directed towards that purpose,
 and by 1929 he was ready to begin. He was master of an immense accumulation of
 philological, historical, and religious facts in the field of ancient Egyptian
 literature, and with him were associated co-workers and colleagues, such as
 Lange, Grapow, and Sander-Hansen. He began with Ut. 2 13 and by the time of his
 death in 1934 had finished up to and including Ut. 506, or less than one half
 of the text as he had published it. It remained for a commission of his
 associates to carry on the work. This they began to do immediately after the
 great master's death.</p>
 
 <p>Sethe's translation and commentary on Uts. 213-506 was not ready</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 7</font></a></p>
 
 <p>for the printer. It needed revising, especially in the later portions, and
 writing. The Commission received the material left by Sethe and published it
 much as it was. Before the beginning of the war in 1939 four volumes of
 translation and commentary were published, which included Uts. 213-506, or
 between one-third and one-half of the whole. A fifth volume is said to be in preparation.</p>
 
 <p>Not counting the early and tentative translation by Maspero in 1894, Sethe's
 is the only translation--itself only between one-third and one-half of the
 whole--in any language of the Pyramid Texts, except one made in French by L.
 Speleers, a Belgian Egyptologist in 1923-1924, remade in 1934, but without a
 commentary. No translation in any other language has so far been published.
 Individual scholars have translated portions here and there for their use in
 works on various aspects of ancient Egyptian religion and thought, philology
 and literature, customs and history, such as Kees, Junker, Drioton, Weill,
 Breasted, Gardiner, Gunn, Sander-Hansen, etc.</p>
 
 <p>The present translation is thus, the only complete one with full commentary
 in any language. It is not as full as that part of Sethe's which is finished,
 but it has been planned to be more concise in its comments, leaving longer
 comments on important points for a series of Excursuses, so as not to interfere
 with the proportioned flow of comment on the current text. But it has been able
 to make use of large portions of the pyramids of Pepi II and Neit as well as of
 publications of other pyramids, tombs, and sarcophagi brought to light since
 Sethe's day. It has thus added over four hundred lines to the text, besides,
 filling some smaller lacunae here and there.</p>
 
 <p>It is not claimed to be a definitive translation, because we have not yet a
 definitive text. Such a text and translation may never be able to be made,
 because of quite natural causes. But with the further discovery of new texts
 and a complete comparison with all extant later parallels in texts already
 published as well as yet unpublished a future text and translation will be
 called for. For that reason, in this present translation use has been made of material
 later than the time of the Pyramid Texts themselves only when it was thought to
 have some light to throw upon a problem difficult of solution, or when it gave
 a new meaning to a passage. In other words, this is an interim translation and
 commentary of the Pyramid Texts for the use not only of Egyptologists but
 likewise of students of religions and comparative religions, of literature and
 comparative literature, of the history of ideas and customs, and of culture and
 civilization in general.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 8</font></a></p>
 
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> There is published with it a complete apparatus for general use such
 as an analysis of each utterance with a discussion of its date, a series of
 Excursuses on important subjects, a full glossary of useful terms, phrases, and
 subjects, and a full index to the translation.</p>
 
 <p>In translating and interpreting these texts many things have had to be taken
 into consideration and many allowances have had to be made. It must he
 remembered that many of these old utterances or discourses are veritable magic
 formulae to procure for the deceased king all kinds of material satisfaction,
 to protect him against any enemies he may meet on his way to the other world,
 and to procure for him an eternal life; and that very often place names refer
 to celestial locations and not to ancient places in Egypt. In keeping with
 their general magical character, most if not all of these utterances begin with
 the expression <i><u>d</u>d mdw</i>, which is a
 rubrical direction "to say," that is, the words are to be spoken or
 recited by someone, often a lector-priest, sometimes the deceased king himself,
 and sometimes by him in the first person. The rubric sometimes directs that the
 petition be repeated four times. There is evidence that some of the utterances
 were written in the first person singular, and were later changed to the third
 person singular. Ut.
 506 is a good example of a text which was surely in the first person singular
 originally, but in general in translations the third person has been used
 unless the form of the first person has been reproduced in the hieroglyphic
 text. It has been useful to notice when the first person is used, for it is one
 of the signs of an early date for the text in which it is found, for example,
 Uts. 325 and 563 are late, and one of the indications is that the third person
 singular is always used. On the whole, the determination of the date of a text
 is rather uncertain, and sometimes impossible. There can be no systematic
 ordering of the dates as J. E. D. P. of Old Testament criticism. Nor is n, the
 sign of the genitive, a sure guide of date, its presence indicating a late and
 its absence an early date, as the occurrence and the absence of the n in the
 same sentence or compound sentence proves, Cf. 2056c.</p>
 
 <p>Among the texts of the Saḳḳâreh pyramids there is evidence of redaction of
 some of them, thus, Ut. 55 is a re-writing for kings of the historic period of
 an older text, composed for the predynastic kings of Buto; and some long
 utterances are made up of independent short parts, with some changes added by
 the redactor, e.g. Ut. 468. Indeed the Pyramid Texts are to a large extent a
 composition, compiling, and joining of earlier texts. Moreover, there are
 corruptions</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 9</font></a></p>
 
 <p>in the texts, mistakes in writing, errors in grammar and syntax,
 contradictions and confusions, expressions which seem ridiculous, and illogical
 expressions, most of which have been referred to in the Commentary on the text
 where they occur. There are numerous paronomasiae and words of double meaning;
 and superstition led to the mutilation of hieroglyphic signs of creatures which
 were thought, if left whole, may be capable of injuring the deceased king, and
 the fish for the same reason was used only once (218c, N.) in the inscriptions
 in his burial chamber.</p>
 
 <p>As there is a minimum of classification and order in the sequence of the
 texts, a list of Contents of the Pyramid Texts precedes this Introduction.
 Therein an attempt has been made to find groups of texts without disturbing the
 sequence of the text in Sethe's edition. Consequently it often happens that we
 are obliged to group some texts under the heading "Texts of Miscellaneous
 Contents." However, there are many instances where texts grouped in
 Sethe's edition form a natural and often perfect group, e.g. the Serpent Charms
 of Uts. 226-244, or the Ferryman Texts, Uts. 300-337.</p>
 
 <p>In translations an honest effort has been made to express the sense of the
 original in English, with the result that many translations are literal instead
 of free, thus in 1004d the original is translated "at the voice of
 lamentation" instead of "at the sound of lamentation," so that
 the English will be apt to be stilted instead of elegant. As in all ancient
 languages, particles, such as adverbs, and conjunctions are rare, with the
 result that it is often not easy to make the correct sequence or dependence,
 rendering the sense of the sentence or passage uncertain. Again the same word
 in different contexts may require varied renderings, such as the word <i>ȝgb</i> which means "flood,"
 "abundance," or "violence," in accordance with the context.
 To save as much space as possible, very few alternative translations have been
 introduced, where in many cases the same phrase or sentence could be rendered
 in different ways. In most lines of the Pyramid Texts the line as it appears in
 two or more pyramids is given; in other words, in Sethe's edition every line is
 given in as many pyramids as it occurs; so as a rule the earliest text is the
 one followed in translating the line unless one of the other pyramids has
 decidedly the best text. Where important differences occur, they are pointed
 out in the commentary; but where differences are not helpful in interpretation
 they are not always noted. Nor are variants in other texts not in the Sethe
 edition referred to unless they are useful in a better understanding of the
 meaning</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 10</font></a></p>
 
 <p>of the text. Whenever "to say" occurs if in only one of the
 parallel pyramids, it is used in the translation. In the Commentary on Uts.
 213-506, Sethe's discussions were ever before me, and I felt myself constrained
 by his logic and learning to follow him, but wherever I felt that another
 solution to a problem of interpretation was better though different from his I
 have not hesitated to use it. In other words, in those utterances, Sethe became
 my standard unless I could improve on it, as I often did, I believe, in the
 light of additional Nt. or N. texts, or still later texts, or comparative
 literature or religion. In all my comments, I have felt free to draw upon any
 sources, especially ancient ones, whenever I felt the need of an illustrative
 idea or custom. But I have been unable to take advantage of some of the new
 points made by my colleagues in their Excursuses, due to a difference of date
 in the completion of the earlier parts of this work and the arrival of their
 manuscript. At the same time, obvious remarks have been avoided as much as
 possible, and only important differences and similarities between lines,
 paragraphs, and utterances have been noted. Minor errors, whether in the
 original hieroglyphics, or in Sethe's text, are not always noted, neither are
 the presence or absence of an <i>i</i>
 prosthetic, or a genitival <i>n</i> always
 mentioned, nor has the analysis of the utterances been too meticulous in
 unessential matters, for as the German proverb has it:</p>
 
 <p>"Wer auf jede Feder acht,<br>
 Nie das Bette fertig macht."</p>
 
 <p>The abbreviations of the pyramids in which texts so far have been found are:
 W. = Unis, T. = Teti, P. = Pepi I, M. = Merenrē, N. = Pepi II (Neferkarē),
 Nt. = Neit, Ip. = Apouit, Wd. = Oudjebten, Ib. = Aba, Sen = Sen-Wosret-Ankh. In the
 translations of the texts of these pyramids, instead of using the different
 abbreviations for the different sovereigns, the letter N. (nomen) is used
 throughout. Other abbreviations may be seen in the "List of
 Abbreviations" of literature. The square brackets [ ] are used to
 designate a conjecture made by Sethe, or by me, which has not with satisfaction
 been textually verified; the round brackets ( ) are used for explanatory words
 or phrases or for alternative translations. Capitalization is used as sparingly
 as possible in the translation and commentary, but when common nouns referring
 to things are personified, or deified, or both, they are written with a capital
 letter; but punctuation marks are used somewhat excessively, especially</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 11</font></a></p>
 
 <p>where they aid the meaning. I have always made a slight departure from the
 orthodox method of transliterating hieroglyphics, in the interest of
 simplicity, in that I have used the accepted <i>i</i> when it is initial, but <i>i</i>
 otherwise; and I use the grammatical word "gentilic" instead of the
 word "nisbé." In case of the two words usually translated, the first
 "soul" and the other "double," I use the transliterated
 forms <i>bȝ</i> and <i>kȝ</i>, or <i>ba</i> and <i>ka</i>, to avoid misunderstanding in the
 supposed English equivalents. In the case of the plural of <i>ka</i>, I use the form <i>ka's</i>
 or <i>kas</i>, which others also use. Any
 differences in the transliteration of words, in abbreviations, and in modes of
 reference, etc., in the Excursuses of authors other than myself are ordinarily
 retained. In broken passages, the approximate length of the broken line is
 indicated by ------------</p>
 
 <p>The Excursuses are meant to treat subjects ordinarily too large for the
 Commentary, but the discussion is confined to the Pyramid Texts, except for
 parallel and illustrative matter. The Glossary is meant to give a brief
 description or definition of important words, names, phrases, and subjects
 which occur in the Translation and Commentary, with as a rule only one
 reference, usually the most important one. Other references may be found in the
 Commentary, in the Index, or in Speleers' excellent Vocabulary. The List of
 Abbreviations applies to the chief works actually used in this book; and the
 Index which follows is that to the Translation alone, but which naturally serves
 the Commentary as well. On account of the lack of hieroglyphic type only a few
 hieroglyphs, considered essential in the comments, have been used, and are
 collected together on three plates at the end of the work, but referred to in
 the Commentary by plate and number. With a few exceptions of names of a general
 character, only those found in the Translation and Commentary are entered in
 the map, which appears at the end of the last volume.</p>
 
 <p>As noted above, the only scientific edition of the hieroglyphic texts of the
 inscribed pyramids was made by Sethe in 1908-1910. The texts form a collection
 of 714 utterances or chapters, and although most of the utterances occur in
 more than one pyramid and very few are repeated in all the pyramids in which
 the texts are found, many of them are damaged and incomplete wherever they are
 found in the texts published by Sethe. However, since the time of Sethe's
 publication similar texts have been found in other pyramids at Saḳḳâreh of
 the Sixth and Seventh Dynasties as well as in private tombs of the Middle
 Kingdom, and which have been published, and are specified</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 12</font></a></p>
 
 <p>above. A study of these additional texts has made it possible for me to add
 in translation 386 lines to the approximately 6500 lines in Sethe's
 hieroglyphic edition, and to make 57 larger restorations, besides many smaller
 ones, amounting to about 40 additional lines, making in all an addition of
 about 426 lines, in translation, to Sethe's original edition. The confirmation
 from texts not available to Sethe of his restorations are not recorded in these
 lists, but they are given in the Commentary (e.g. that in 130, while
 emendations and restorations as well as all substantial additions are mentioned
 in the comments on the lines where they occur. Therefore, for convenience of
 reference to the published hieroglyphic texts, there follow here two lists, the
 <i>first</i> a list of the <i>added lines</i>, and the <i>second</i> a list of the <i>larger restorations</i>. The additions as
