           (1-8,Shadow Hawk) Blessed Goddess, Queen of Heaven and Earth,
                You with the Stars in your eyes, and love in your heart...
                Descend to this our Circle on your Night of Power.
 
           (1-5,Jehana) I am the Lady of the starry heavens
                I am she who is the Mother of all living things
                I have worked the landscape into mountains
                lay the waters into their ocean beds,
                and set the winds in their course.
                Every snowflake, every speck of soil or sand
                Bears my imprint.
                My countenance appears in the faintest flicker,
                and the largest star;
                The Universe is My handiwork.
                I am She who consoles the sorrowful,
                and I am She who tends to the sick.
                I bring solace to those in life,
                and peace and understanding in death.
                I am the changing Goddess --
                Maiden, Mother, and Crone --
                The Hag hidden deep within...
                I have been to the Underworld,
                and I have Returned.
                Let there be beauty and strength,
                Power and compassion,
                Honor and humility,
                Mirth and reverence within you.
                And you who seek to know Me,
                To feel My spirit
                Come before Me with a sincere heart,
                burn incense upon my altar
                Listen and be still:
                Know that your seeking and your yearning 
                will avail you not,
                Unless you know the Mystery:
                For if that which you seek, 
 
 
 
                                                                             2125
 
                you find not within yourself,
                You will never find it without.
                For Behold:  
                I have been with you from the beginning,
                and I am that which is attained at the end of          
                desire.
 
           (1-8,Shadow Hawk) Blessed Be!
 
           (1-8,Shadow Hawk) By the Flame that burneth bright O' Horned One!
                We call thy name into the night, O' Ancient One!
                Thee we invoke, by the moon-lit sea, 
                by the standing stone and the twisted tree.
                Thee we invoke, where gather thine own, 
                by the nameless shrine forgotten and alone.
                Come where the round of the dance is Trod.
                Horn and Hoof of the Goatfoot God!
                By moon-lit meadows on dusky hill, 
                when the haunted wood is hushed and still.
                Come to the charm of the chanted prayer.
                As the moon bewitches the midnight air, 
                evoke thy powers, that potent bide.
                In shining stream and the secret tide, 
                in fiery flame by starlight pale, 
                in Shadowy host that rides the gale, 
                and by the fern-brakes fairy-haunted 
                of forest wild and woods enchanted.
                Come!  O' Come!
                To the heart-beat's drum!
                When the broad white moon is climbing slow.
                Through the stars to the heaven's height.
                We hear thy hoofs on the wind of night!
                As black tree-branches shake and sigh,
                By Joy and terror we know thee nigh,
                We speak the spell thy power unlocks,
                At Solstice, Sabbat, and Equinox.
                Word of Virtue the veil to rend,
                From Primal Dawn to the wide World's end,
                Since time began, the blessings of Pan
                Blessed be in strength and love,
                Blessed be, wher'ere we rove,
                Vision fade not from our eyes
                Of the Pagan Paradise.
                Past the gates of Death and Birth,
                Our inheritance of Earth.
                From our soul the song of Spring
                Fade not in our wandering, Our life is one, 
                By blackest night or the noonday Sun. 
                Eldest of Gods on thee we call, 
                Blessing be on thy Creatures all.
                I call upon thee, O' Ancient Horned One Who art the
                Comforter and the Consoler of Men I call upon thee, O' Great
                God of the Witches.
                Ruler of the Sabbat, Lord of the Wild Woods, I call upon
                thee in the Name of your Lady, Come out of the North upon
 
 
 
                                                                             2126
 
                the back of the Winds.
                And join the Lady Cerridwin at this Holy Sabbat/Esbat.
                I call thee by thy most ancient name Cernunnos.

                The blue glowing field...
                a part of your body...
                Take it in...
                Let all return to as it has been.
 
           (1-8,Shadow Hawk) Fire Seal the Circle Round, Let it fade beneath
                the ground...
                let all things be as they were since the Beginning of Time.
 
           (1-5,Jehana) Merry meet...
                and merry part...
                and merry  meet again!
 
           (1-8,Shadow Hawk) Merry meet!
                Blessed Be, Jehana.
