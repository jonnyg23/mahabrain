                             "LEGITIMACY" IN THE CRAFT, a conversation 
 
             ---------------------------------------------------------------------

             Re: things
             St:
             ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
             L&gt; What rituals do you think I would have to do to become "letigimate" L&gt; ....(do I
             have to be "initiated" in other words... )!
 
                 That rather depends on who you want to recognise you as legitimate. There's a
 
             wide variance of opinion as to what makes a witch, a Witch or a Wiccan.  If you open
 
             your heart to the Lady and commune (speak with your heart, not necessarily in words)
 
             with her often, she will eventually adopt her as one of her special Children (the
 
             "inner", or Lady's, initiation). Her adoption will cause changes to your spirit and
 
             way of looking at things that will be obvious to those of us who share it, as its
 
             presence in others will become obvious to you after you've awakened to her touch
 
             (unfortunately, it's one of those things
 
             that doesn't make much sense until you've *been there*).
 
                  Most of us here accept the Lady's initiation as the mark of a true Witch
 
             (capitalised to denote the priest/ess, as opposed to the folk mage or witch).  I
 
             gather that the majority of those posting here think of Wiccans and Witches as one
 
             and the same, though many of us think of Wicca as a particular subset of Witches
 
             (i.e. all Wiccans are Witches, but not all Witches are, or even wish to be, Wiccan).
 
 
                                                                                            1767
           
 
                For those of us who see them as different (I'm one of them), you will need to
 
             be formally adopted into a Wiccan clan to be a *Wiccan* Witch. Some traditions
 
             permit self-adoption into their clans, some (Gardnerians and their near kin in
 
             particular) recognise you as Wiccan only if you've been adopted by an authorised
 
             Elder of the clan in question.  Then again,there's a few diehards who don't
 
             recognise anyone but members of their own clan as Wiccan.
 
                  Which brings us back to square one -- it depends on whose recognition you're
 
             looking for.  Most will accept your legitimacy *as a Witch* based on the quality of
 
             your rapport with the Lady.  And the way to develop that is to spend a lot of time
 
             in her company, whether with like-minded others in a coven or quietly by yourself. 
 
             A large minority will accept you *as a Wiccan* based on whether or not you have
 
             passed through a human rite of passage (confusingly, also called initiation)
 
             adopting you into a Wiccan clan.  Be sure you know the
 
             family that wishes to adopt you before accepting: this time you get to *choose* your
 
             relatives &lt;g&gt;.  Those who insist that only *they* have the Truth, and therefore only
 
             they are legitimate aren't really worth wasting your time worrying about, IMHO.
 
 
                                                                                            1768
           
 
 
 
           L&gt; I was wondering if you HAD to belong to a coven in order to 
             L&gt; practice, or to be "letigimate", so to speak.
 
                As Ayesha mentioned, what matters is that you spend time in the Lady's company,
 
             and "listen" to what she has to say, "feel" what she has to show. Even amongst
 
             crusty old Gardnerians such as myself, there's no need to be a member of a coven to
 
             practice your Craft, nor does resigning from a coven invalidate your initiation(s). 
 
             We prefer to work in covens, because we generally prefer the company of our brethren
 
             in Circle, but there's no law that says we *have to* if we feel like being alone, or
 
             have no choice in the matter.  Gardnerian
 
             *initiations* are done by a coven, and one normally has to be a candidate for
 
             membership in that coven in order to be initiated (by us).  This is by no means
 
             invariable, but initiating someone you don't want in your coven is considered
 
             tasteless at best, a betrayal of your sacred trust at worst.  
 
 
 
                  So, no, you don't HAVE to be a member of a coven to be seen as legitimate.  And
 
             since my own opinion is that the weakest link in a coven is its weakest solitary,
 
             I'd encourage you to continue to do some solo work, even if you DO join a coven. 
 
             But what would I know, I'm just a 3rd &lt;big grin&gt;.  Blessings on your path, whichever
 
             way you choose to go...
