                         Sigil Magic for the Professional Magician 
 
                                         by Areosol 
 
            
 
                I will assume that you are already initiated into the secrets of 
 
           Austin  Spare`s sigil magic. Consulting  with my clients  as a profes-
 
           sional magician, I am always confronted with the same question: Is the
 
           client`s  will identical with  my own ?  If it is,  there should be no
 
           problem  involved in  charging  the sigil  in  the client`s  stead  by
 
           myself. (The client, one  must remember, will usually not  be familiar
 
           with the basic tenets of sigil magic or even magic in general and will
 
           probably hesitate  to try it out for himself.) However, I believe as a
 
           matter  of principle  that  everybody should  vaccinate  his will  for
 
           himself. I do not feel happy with charging myself i.e. my subconscious
 
           with  other people`s  desires.   For example:  if Mrs.  X wants  to be
 
           brought  together with  Mr. Y  by a  sigil (love  spell), it  could be
 
           intersting  to  know what  might happen  if  the pertinent  sigil were
 
           charged by myself. 
 
            
 
                Accordingly  I had  to find  a means  to implant  sigils into  my
 
           individual clients in such a way that they are not aware of  what they
 
           are really  doing. At first,  talking with the  client, I will  try to
 
           find  the "smallest  common  denominator" out  of  a tangled  mass  of
 
           multiple desires. This will continue until the client is able to  word
 
           his or her statement of will (henceforth to be termed "will sentence")
 
           in plain and unambiguous language. Following  this all contact between
 
           the client and myself will be abandoned  for two or tree weeks. In the
 
           meantime  I  will construct  the  sigil,  usually employing  the  word
 
           method, and sketch it  on a piece of parchment.  Very  often the clie-
 
           nt`s  name will  be encoded applying  the magical camea  of the planet
 
 
                                                                             1417
 
           pertinent to the client`s desire. I may then supplement the sigil with
 
           this personalised glyph. Then  I will outline  a short ritual for  the
 
           client in which will be hidden the charge proper of the sigil (employ-
 
           ing either the mantric method  or a variation of the so-called  "death
 
           posture"). 
 
            
 
                After a  while I will  send the client this  constructed sigil by
 
           mail including instructions on  how to charge it plus  possible addit-
 
           ional admonitions, if necessary. Most probably the client will have 
 
           forgotten the precise wording of his/her will sentence by now; neither
 
           will  he or  she be able  to draw  any conclusions  from these strange
 
           glyphs. After having  been charged the  sigil can  be sealed and  con-
 
           stantly worn in a locket, it can also be put  permanently in view e.g.
 
           as a wall  decoration. Some of  my clients have  placed or hung  their
 
           sigils nicely framed in their office rooms. 
 
            
 
                To charge  a sigil the following  method is very effective.   The
 
           client arrives for consultation. In some cases has to bring along some
 
           substance  imbibed with  his or her  Od. During a  small ritual client
 
           must close  his/her eyes  and place  the odic  substance on  the sigil
 
           which  will be lying  open in front  of him/her. Then  I will take the
 
           client`s finger and  prick it quickly and sharply with a small chirur-
 
           gical lancet. After the blooddrop has been smeared onto the sigil, the
 
           latter  will be  folded and  sealed immediately.  I then  admonish the
 
           client to  bear in mind that  this talisman must never  get into other
 
           people`s  hands.   This  charging  method is  especially  effective in
 
           working with protection or "antipersonnel mine" sigils. 
 
            
 
 
                                                                             1418
 
 
 
                Here are some examples relating to client`s feedback:  
 
           30.04. Sigil as wall decoration 
 
           24.06. Business enterprises developed well. 
 
           12.07. Protection/defence sigil, charged employing chirurgical 
 
                  lancet. 
 
           14.07. Client feels well and secure. 
 
           23.06. Sigil as a defense "antipersonnel mine" with codification of 
 
                  client`s name by the magical camea of Mars, charged with 
 
                  lancet. 
 
           09.10. "Mine" fully operative: sickness and accidents of 2-3 
 
                  enemies. 
 
           11.10. Sigil employed as a wall decoration. 
 
              11. Business successful. Sale of real estate to a monastry (!) 
 
                  has been agreed upon. 
 
           27.12. Sigil, mantric charge. 
 
           14.02. Client`s partner becomes more friendly and loving. 
 
           18.03. Partnership satisfactory. 
 
           17.06. Sigil charged spastically by myself in client`s stead. 
 
           18.06. Shortly before the potential buyer arrived for inspection in 
 
                  the afternoon, the last seat in the coffeehouse (sales 
 
                  object) had been taken, suggesting excellent business; 
 
                  immediately after inspection number of customers decreased 
 
                  again. 
 
            
 
           07.12. Fast charge of a "combat sigil". 
 
           21.12. The idea incorporated by the sigil incarnates as a conscious 
 
                  wish in the target person`s love partner. 
 
 
                                                                             1419
