                       Coming of Age Ritual Notes 
                                 Malakus
      Over the past weekend during an emotional upheaval I "Birthed" the
 concept for the ritual.  I thought I would pass the concept on to you
 and see what you think.  I have the ability to visualize a ritual from
 beginning to end, sometime with brief snatches of dialogue.  It's like
 watching a play from the catwalks.
     This is how I see this ritual unfolding.  The boy who is entering
 into Manhood will be abducted from the encampment where he is staying. 
 The women of his Mother Grove will try to fight the men off from
 abducting the boy.  When this skirmish is over and the boy is being
 taken off by the men the women will mourn the loss of the child.  The
 boy will be stripped of his clothing and dressed in a deerhide loin
 cloth.  He will then be blindfolded and his journey will begin.  Where
 this ritual is being held there is approximately 5 miles of paths which
 the boy will journey over.  He will be led by his Father who will carry
 a lamp to light his and his son's way.  At the first prescribed stop the
 boy will be addressed by Herne.  Herne, will speak to the boy of his
 wild nature, what it is like to be the hunter and the hunted.  He will
 charge the boy with the responsibilities of becoming a man through Him. 
 He will then tell the boy that He will meet him at the appointed place
 in the appointed hour.  Never revealing when and where that is.  Herne
 will withdraw into the woods as the Father and son begin to journey
 again.
     At the second stop the Father and boy will meet the Green Man.  He
 represents the boy's earthy nature.  He is the boy sexual responsibility
 as a carrier of sacred seed which is necessary to begin life.  That he
 must act intelligently when it comes to the act of procreation.  The
 Green Man as well will tell the boy that they will meet in the appointed
 placed at the appointed hour.   The Green Man will stand in silence as
 the Father and boy leave.
     At the third stop the Father and boy will meet LokiRRainbow Dancer.
 When I visualized the archetype I saw a myriad number of colours and
 flashed of refracted light.  Loki will speak to the boy of his dreams,
 wishes and hope He will inform the boy that these are necessary even as
 a man.  That he should not give them up but allow them to mature as he
 matures.  Loki will also tell the boy that they will meet at the
 appointed place in the appointed hour.
     The Father and son will continue there journey until they reach the
 last stop on their journey.  Here they will meet the Magus who is robed
 in black and you are unable to see his face.  The Magus will speak to
 the boy of his inner true self, his highest ideals, his magical self. 
 He symbolizes Divine Wisdom.  When he is finished speaking he will also
 tell the boy of meeting in the appointed place in the appointed hour.
     All the archetype will be wearing masks that will be indicative of
 them.  Herne with horns, Green Man with a mask made of leaves, Loki with
 the face of the fox, and the Magus with a black mask which entirely
 covers his face.  All the other masks will not cover the mouth area.  My
 Spirit Brother in Akron, OH is creating the masks and the staves for the
 four archetypes.  After the journey has been completed he will be
 brought to the gateway of the ritual are Prior to the ritual itself the
 boy will be asked to select something that symbolizes his childhood and
 that he should bring it with him.  When the boy is abducted those who
 abduct him must be sure to acquire this childhood symbol to be given to
 the father to take on the journey.  At the gateway the father will stop
 the boy and inform him that he must now give up this childhood symbol in
 order to enter into the world of men. The boy must surrender the symbol
 before the rite can continue.  The symbol will be left at the gateway.

 I didn see a traditional circle being cast, rather a ring of men hand in
 hand passing energy to form the circle.  I keep hearing "a hand to a
 hand, to feed a hand" or a "brother to a brother".  The circle will open
 to admit the father and boy The boy is still blindfold and will be place
 before the balefire facing the gateway through which he just entered. 
 I see four men at various stage of the lives serving as Priests.  One is
 just past puberty, the next has himself just become a father, the next
 being around 40-50 years (the age of the God at the
 time of his decline in power) and the last being the Grandfather.  The
 four will each evoke one of the four achetypes that spoke to the boy
 during his journey.  The Priest just past puberty will evoke Loki, the
 new father will evoke the Green Man, the 40-50 year old will evoke
 Herne, and Grandfather will evoke the Magus.  Each will be evoked
 separately and when each has been evoked will enter the circle from
 where they have been waiting out of sight of the circle itself.  Each
 will speak further to the boy of his mystery and present the boy with a
 "gift" which will enable the boy to commune with the archetype
 in times of trial in his life as a man.  The last to speak will be
 Herne.  Just as he is is finishing what he has to say he will be
 interrupted by the final archetype.  This is the Great Mother.  She will
 speak to the boy of his union with her and to truly become a man he must
 understand her magics as well.  Herne and the Great Mother will argue
 (choice of words, maybe not the best) over who this boy/man belong.  The
 Great Mother informs Herne that the boy/man belongs to Her.  Herne
 informs Her that She was there at his conception and birth and that She
 will have him in death but now the boy/man belongs to Him.  My Spirit
 Brother has a staff with a deer hoof end which I see being placed on the
 boy's heart while Herne claims him as his.  During the claiming the
 boy's blindfold will be removed and the boy/man will see Herne for the
 first time with his hoof on his chest over his heart.  After the
 claiming is finished the boy will be approached by the four Priests for
 the anointing.
      I have an anointing already written for this part of the rite. 
 While the anointing is being done the four persons who are taking the
 roles of the archetypes will leave and return dressed as they wish.  The
 boy will be taken to his father who will first greet the boy/man now as
 a fellow man and a guardian of the male mystery.  The father will then
 take the newly made man to the North quarter where the Great Mother will
 speak to the newly made man bestowing Her gift to him.  When the Great
 Mother speaks She will be heard only and not seen as if Her voice were
 being carried on the wind.
     The the newly made man will be taken to each man in turn in the
 circle who will give the newly made man a gift.  I see the gift being
 wisdom something that they have learned of life and that they wish to
 pass on to help the newly made man's journey through life.  As each man
 has an occupation which requires particular tools so does life require
 its tools.
      When all have granted their gift the newly made man will be asked
 to bestow his blessing upon a horn of ale which symbolized the cup of
 brotherhood of all peoples.  The cup will be shared with all in the
 circle and will symbolized the universality of men.
     This is where I see the ritual ending.  I see a simple feast being
 held where the ritual has been.  More cups will be filled, stories share
 in the spirit of brotherhood.  As the night wears on towards dawn the
 newly made made will be left to himself, the balefire and the night.  He
 will return to the campsite from which he was abducted no longer as a
 child but as a man with all the responsibilities of a man.
