           night,

           come forth,
           (1-2,High Priestess) Gather you around as is your right.

           Air,
           (1-2,High Priestess) spirits of Fire, and spirits of Water.  COME,

           that is, was

           (1-2,High Priest) I walk the circle Round and Round, I
           (1-2,High Priest) cast the Circle on the Ground.  I
           (1-2,High Priest) walk the Circle round and round, I
           (1-2,High Priest) cast the Circle on the ground.
           (1-2,High Priest) Willow, will you call the directions, beginning in
           the
           (1-2,High Priest) North?
           ---lost transmission for North, East---
           (1-3,Willow) Spirits of the South, the (creatures lost)
           (1-3,Willow) bring your flame of life and love to your children to
           dance in
            until the Winter rules again. Be with us now.
           (1-3,Willow) Spirits of the West, the dolphin, the dragonfly,
           (1-3,Willow) bring us your peace and healing love.
           (1-3,Willow) Let the warm waters wash us clean and purify  us in this
           sacred
            rite.
           (1-3,Willow) Let the waters of the mother be with us now.So mote it
           be.
           (1-2,High Priest) So mote it be!
           (1-2,High Priest) We are in the place that is not a Place, in a time
           that
 
 
 
                                                                             2117
 
           (1-2,High Priest) is not a Time, and in a space that is not a Space. 
           Let
           (1-2,High Priest) none disturb that which the Gods have decreed.
           (1-2,High Priestess) This is the time of the Full Moon, the high tide
           of
           (1-2,High Priestess) power.  As we are bid to assemble, at least once
           in the
           (1-2,High Priestess) month to seek Her blessings, so we are here
           tonight.
           (1-2,High Priest) Maiden, Mother, Crone as One, Triple Faced Goddess,
           we
           (1-2,High Priest) call upon you.  Your Children have come as in the
           olde
           (1-2,High Priest) days, with joy in our eyes and Love in our hearts. 
           We
           (1-2,High Priest) walk the old paths, we sing the old songs, we chant
           the
           (1-2,High Priest) old chants and we call the old calls.
           (1-2,High Priest) Goddess of the Spring, we call upon you, Queen of
           the
           (1-2,High Priest) great woods, Diana, we open our hearts to you.
           (1-2,High Priestess) Child of Vine and Child of field, we call upon
           you,
           (1-2,High Priestess) Dionysus,  Shining One, Mother's Son, Lover in
           the
           (1-2,High Priestess) Fields, we open our hearts to you.
           (1-2,Diana) Children of the Night, Thrice blessed are you who walk
           (1-2,Diana) My Path, for Mine is the Path of New Beginnings.  None
           (1-2,Diana) shall wither and grow stagnant who pulls on the Bow of
           (1-2,Diana) Life, and launches themselves into the Stars upon my
           (1-2,Diana) Arrow.
           (1-2,Dionysus) Children of the Day, Thrice blessed are you who walk My
           (1-2,Dionysus) Path, for Mine is the Path of New Beginnings.  None
           (1-2,Dionysus) shall Die who knows the secret of my seed.
           (1-2,Diana) Listen to me, Oh my Children, and walk with me in the
           (1-2,Diana) Woods.
           (1-2,Diana) Around you I weave my spell and might.  The trees grow
           (1-2,Diana) thicker and strong.  Off in the distance you hear the
           (1-2,Diana) sound of a large animal crashing through the brush, and
           (1-2,Diana) close you hear the chirping of birds.  The gentle hum
           (1-2,Diana) of sacred bees about their labor of collecting pollen
           (1-2,Diana) for Me, for I am their Queen too.
           (1-2,Diana) The Wind swirls around us, and the scent of life fills
           (1-2,Diana) the air.  Tangy pine, sharp ceder, far off apple trees
           (1-2,Diana) all cast their call upon the air.
           (1-2,Diana) The sound in the brush gets closer and closer, till a
           (1-2,Diana) great Stag bursts forth from the brush.  Head thrown
           (1-2,Diana) back he bellows his cry.  Then with a twist he is off,
           (1-2,Diana) quicker than the thunder rolling down from the hills,
           (1-2,Diana) he speeds.  But, I am faster.
           (1-2,Diana) Bow twangs, arrow flies, and with the muted sound of an
           (1-2,Diana) earthquake, he dies.
           (1-2,Diana) Look at me, my Children.  I am the Goddess of
           (1-2,Diana) Swiftness, with a look I can bring death.  And bending
           (1-2,Diana) down, I touch the Stag, and with a start he bounds
 
 
 
                                                                             2118
 
           (1-2,Diana) away.  I am the Goddess of Swiftness, with a touch I
           (1-2,Diana) can bring life.  I am Life Eternal, and I am Death
           (1-2,Diana) Eternal.
           (1-2,Dionysus) Her hand is the Blade, her Eye the Arrow, Her touch the
           (1-2,Dionysus) Kiss of Life and Death.  And I love her.
           (1-2,Dionysus) Mine is the secret of the Cycle, the Secret of the
           (1-2,Dionysus) Doorway betwixt Life and Death is Mine.
           (1-2,Dionysus) Behold, I give you this seed.  In this seed is the
           (1-2,Dionysus) coming Year.  Charge it well with your wishes tonight,
           (1-2,Dionysus) that Her Blessings will grow with you through the year.
           (1-2,Dionysus) I am the Seed of New Beginnings, and Her's is the Water
           (1-2,Dionysus) of Life.
           (1-2,Diana) Children of the Night, bring forth your Seed, that I
           (1-2,Diana) may touch them and bring you the gifts that are mine to
           (1-2,Diana) share.
           (1-2,High Priestess) (everyone plant at least one desire in their
           Virtual
           (1-2,High Priestess) Seed and hold it in your hands.  Visualize a
           white
           (1-2,High Priestess) light coming from the Center of the Circle and
           all the

           for my

           (1-2,Shadow Hawk) Willow, do you have a desire?
           (1-10,Dave) merry meet everyone!
           (1-2,Shadow Hawk) Merry Meet Dave, Take a seed from the hand of the
           God,
            and...
           (1-2,Shadow Hawk) place your desire for the coming year in it.

           Circle
           (1-10,Dave) Aye, that I will do...
           (1-3,Willow) I place within my seed the desire to fill our new home
           with
            love and the promise of a marriage filled with beauty and wonder.
           (1-2,Shadow Hawk) So mote it be Willow!
