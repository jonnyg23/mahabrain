                                    Treatise on Mind 
                                     From: The Tigress  
 
                 Fromthe moment that 2cells form a zygote, wesee  the interaction
 
           of  informational process  - recognition,  communication, interaction,
 
           integration, re-stabilization and  reproduction and or  re-structuriz-
 
           ation.  This cycle of  life can be see from the barest combinations of
 
           any  two elemental  components beginning  at the lowest  atomic desig-
 
           nations  of  energy and  throughout the  continuum of  increasing com-
 
           plexity - perhaps far beyond our capabilities 
 
           to understand.   ***  If consciousness can be  defined as an awareness
 
           of integrity through this process of self recognition; then conscious-
 
           ness can be easily applied to that which is non-human.*** 
 
             
 
                 From the most basicinteractions of chemistry, wefind that evenon
 
           an  atomic level there is to be  found this type of consciousness.  We
 
           have  become aware  of the  atom's necessary  maintenance of  it's own
 
           structure  through the  evidence  of necessary  balancing of  protons,
 
           neutrons and electrons;  the importance of electron shell  valences is
 
           also a  reminder of this type of integrity.   Even on an atomic level,
 
           there is  a form of awareness  of self-integrity in order  to maintain
 
           structure and identity. 
 
             
 
                     This process ofawareness is alsoa geniusof discrimination. A
 
           form  of identification  of self  &amp;  non self  on an  energetic level.
 
           There  is a borrowing, and sometimes a sharing energetically, yet when
 
           this process of self recognition begins to fail we see the destruction
 
           of the matter it  involves &lt;this is evident with  atomic structure and
 
           also evident at the human level  in the study of cancer.&gt; Therefore we
 
           might  look at  this process of  self-recognition and  maintenance and
 
           examine it's nature in order to find its function and capabilities. 
 
 
                                                                             1266
 
             
 
                     When we lookat different typesof matter, wefind that themore
 
           simple the atomic structure  of the mass, the less complex its process
 
           of  "consciousness" needs to  be.  Things which  are comprised of only
 
           one atomic component  do not need  complex processes of  communication
 
           between those components.   Thus the level of consciousness  is rather
 
           low on an evolutionary scale of creativity, yet we also see that these
 
           types of  things are far more  stable in regards to  their integrity -
 
           far less  vulnerable to destruction.   In example, it takes  an enorm-
 
           ously concentrated force of heat to break the integrity of an atom...-
 
           yet a  mere 2000 degree flame  will not only destroy  the integrity of
 
           human consciousness, but also destroy  the integrity of the individual
 
           component molecules which  form the material mass of  a human to their
 
           lowest forms as individual atoms. 
 
             
 
 
                                                                             1267
 
                     Whenwe look at theforces involved incommunication of energy,
 
           we  see  a flowing  medium of  different  frequencies within  a single
 
           spectrum  of  energetic  potential.   Elemental  energies  and  forces
 
           &lt;light,  sound,  temperature,  pressure,   magnetism,  electricity...&gt;
 
           differentiate and vary in  intensity and frequency yet are  very alike
 
           in  that they are all  means of transferring energy  as a form of com-
 
           munication which can be informative/stabilizing or disinformative/des-
 
           tructive,  depending  on the  structure  of  the "consciousness"  they
 
           encounter.  It  may be perceived that the more  complex the structure,
 
           the lower the  frequency of the  integrity of that  structure and  the
 
           more vulnerable that structure is to disinformation. 
 
            
 
                The  more diverse the components  are that are  included within a
 
           thing,  and the more efficient  the means of  communication within the
 
           structure  of that thing; the  lower the common  denomination of freq-
 
           uency of integrity must  be in order that the  informational frequency
 
           will not be  destructive to any  of the component  parts.  To  analyze
 
           this statement we must look at other analogies within our environment.
 
           Firstly I would like to examine the nature of sound. 
 
             
 
 
                                                                             1268
 
                Sound waves come  in varying frequencies and  modulations, and as
 
           humans we assign different  notes to those steps within  the frequency
 
           spectrum which we can  differentiate and perceive.  If we play several
 
           notes  simultaneously, we  find that  in order  to maintain  a balance
 
           harmonically, we must  play notes that  match each others  modulation.
 
           You can play a "C" note at any  octave and in fact play all "C"  notes
 
           simultaneously  and you  will  find that  within  the frequency  range
 
           these notes will compliment each other, in fact they will contribute/-
 
           share energy with each other.  WE find similar  matching if we look at
 
           musical chording.  If you play the  notes "F" and "C" , the sharing of
 
           energy  vibrationally between  those two ranges  of frequency  will in
 
           fact create  the note  of "A"  in  the range  in which  the two  notes
 
           frequencies  overlap.  In this way communication is informative and in
 
           fact the "whole  is greater" than  the sum of  its parts.   Similarly,
 
           playing  two notes which lie in the same modulation frequencies simul-
 
           taneously  will increase the duration of the vibration compared to the
 
           duration if each note were played alone. 
 
             
 
                When  we examine  the  sharing of  electrical  information at  an
 
           atomic level, we see  that through the temporary sharing  of electrons
 
           in a phase  path also indicates  something that we  might consider  as
 
           investing a thing &lt;atom&gt; with more than the sum  of its parts.  Simil-
 
           arly in using electric  frequencies in a series, we  store information
 
           on silicon chips which invest them with more than they would be if one
 
           simply  looked at the electrical  and silicon components  alone.  This
 
           transference  of  energy  is also  a  transference  of information  in
 
           frequencies which in many ways we are still attempting to understand. 
 
            
 
 
                                                                             1269
 
                Simple, one component things,  can sustain far higher frequencies
 
           of  energetic  transmission than  can  complex  components of  things.
 
           Frequencies which pass freely through atoms ultimately destroy complex
 
           things such as humans when they are subject to them.   It appears that
 
           the  more complex  the union  of the components,  the slower  and more
 
           tediously  complex the  transformation  of data  must  be.   The  more
 
           complex a thing is,  the lower the vibrational capability  it sustains
 
           in order to maintain the integrity of its own structure. 
 
             
 
                Energetic  communication exists  infinitely throughout  the univ-
 
           erse.  The transference  of information through radio waves  and light
 
           waves continues back in time to the occasion of what was known as  the
 
           Big Bang.  It may be that in the future we will find that in the  same
 
           way gravity  and electromagnetism  are also continuums  of information
 
           from  times long past.   Scientifically we study  these energetic con-
 
           tinuums and yet we doubt and deny the holistic communicative nature of
 
           the  universe.  We search for causes  and effects within the realms of
 
           our limited  perceptions and are  amazed when  we can  find no  causal
 
           effects to explain change. 
 
             
 
 
                                                                             1270
 
 
 
                When we  examine biological life, we find  that each evolutionary
 
           adaptation seems to be  an extension of the  process of self/non  self
 
           awareness  and maintenance of  integrity.  Not  only do  we see inten-
 
           sification  of sensory perceptual abilities, but also we note that the
 
           integrational and responsive/reactive   components of the process also
 
           have to  evolve and adapt in order to stay integrated with the rest of
 
           the "consciousness".   Amoebas are "simple" life forms, and yet we can
 
           examine them and see that each organic component within that life form
 
           serves  as an  informational  and communicative  component within  the
 
           process of maintaining the integrity &lt;life&gt;  of the whole.  When  this
 
           communication  process or any part  of it ceases,  the organization of
 
           the organism begins to deteriorate and eventually ceases and dies.  In
 
           biological life, we  find that  though we have  maintained the use  of
 
           electronic  communication on some neural  levels, we have  sunk to the
 
           depths  of transferring  actual molecular  compounds &lt;proteins,  amino
 
           acids...&gt; in  most of our  organic processes.   Even the  human brain,
 
           supposed  highest achievement  of  organic life  forms, requires  base
 
           molecular  salts in  order  to process  electrical  information.   Our
 
           complexity denies us the speed of light, radio, 
 
           and other  faster and higher  frequency modes of  communication except
 
           from outside of ourselves. 
 
             
 
 
                                                                             1271
 
 
 
                The  human consciousness is a  genius of discrimination.   We use
 
           the abilities of  discrimination to identify those  stimuli which come
 
           from outside of our biological forms in order  to protect and maintain
 
           our integrity &lt;life.   We use our senses &lt;inefficient  though they may
 
           be&gt;  to gather and interpret pure energetic communications such as the
 
           radiated  energy of sunlight and we are so inefficient at interpreting
 
           that data that we can only sense light and heat and it  destroys those
 
           sensors  that gather that information through blindness and sunburn if
 
           we continue too long in our attempts.  Yet, 
 
           conversely , we  need the information  from sunlight which  stimulates
 
           our organic forms  into producing  vitamin D &lt;without  which we  would
 
           die&gt;. Is  this a remnant  of photosynthetic  capabilities from  lessor
 
           complex integrations, or  merely a new  attempt at further  increasing
 
           our potential? 
 
             
 
 
                                                                             1272
 
                As organic forms of  consciousness, we are sorely limited  in our
 
           perceptions  of the  universe.    Limited  in exploring  the  possibly
 
           limitless ranges of energetic exchange simply due to the limits placed
 
           upon  communication due to the complexity  of our component structure.
 
           Yet  rather than admit to our limitations, we seek further exploration
 
           through  the development of tools  made from things  less complex than
 
           ourselves.   In the laboratory, we  use light waves and shaped silicon
 
           to create microscopes to increase our sense of visual acuity within 
 
           the spectrum  of visible  radiation imaging.   In  the studio,  we use
 
           simple cones  flattened vegetable matter and  electronic amplification
 
           to create tools  to compensate for our  limited aural perception.   We
 
           have created many tools out of simpler  and less complex components in
 
           order  to reach  those  higher frequencies  of  information which  are
 
           either  so far removed from us as  to be imperceptible, or so destruc-
 
           tive to us that we dare not experience them ourselves. 
 
             
 
                The  human zygote from the moment of conception is a discriminat-
 
           ing  consciousness which is involved in the differentialization of its
 
           components in order to 
 
           develop finer  levels of complexity.   This fetus is also  even before
 
           birth  learning to  interpret  communicative energies  from the  outer
 
           world in order  to begin definition of  itself, its integrity  and its
 
           maintenance  of  self apart  from the  influence  of "other".   Cells,
 
           joining together  in communication  to form co-operative  systems each
 
           with  separate responsibilities  to the  whole.  Organs  with specific
 
           functions  supporting the organism in its fight to maintain its integ-
 
           rity.   Consciousness of Mind, determining the difference between self
 
           and non self, regulating the integrity  of the whole.  This harmony of
 
           components within a symphony  of orchestration, this is the  matter of
 
           being alive. 
 
 
                                                                             1273
 
                Despite our  complexities, despite recognition of our vulnerabil-
 
           ities  and limitations; we as humans are  beings of arrogant mind.  We
 
           claim supremacy over all biological organisms and claim the sole right
 
           to conscious thought &lt;as if we  were the only from of communication we
 
           wished  to recognize.&gt;   We  deny our insecurities  and lay  claims to
 
           great understandings concerning the  universe, when we in fact  do not
 
           even  understand the actual workings of our own process of integration
 
           and communication within our own biological forms. 
 
           We claim  ownership of consciousness,  yet we  do not even  pretend to
 
           truly evaluate the process of consciousness nor its beginnings. 
 
                Despite our inadequacies,  we assume  to know the  nature of  the
 
           beginnings of  all life.   We claim to  know the "mind"  of "God" &lt;the
 
           prime causation for all that exists&gt; and we claim title to superiority
 
           in emulation of this "God" - above  and beyond all other forms of life
 
           or integrity.  An egotistic lot are we, who strive to seek security in
 
           the  midst of  our  fear, our  inadequacies,  our vulnerabilities;  by
 
           developing a system of belief which guarantees our security in a place
 
           beyond our perception.  We seek safety and foundation at the same time
 
           that we reach outward to claim flight amongst the stars. 
 
                This is  the paradox on humanity,  of mind.  Complexity  found in
 
           simplicity... using simplicity to explore  a universe beyond the range
 
           of our complex integrity.  Our complex integrity vulnerable to all but
 
           the  simplest energies,  while we  lay grasp  to use  complex energies
 
           which would destroy us in order to  prove our strength.  What it is we
 
           look for, we  eventually find at the expense of  closing our senses to
 
           see what  really is.   Perhaps it  is true that  the most foolish  are
 
           those who lay claim to knowledge for they have closed their minds 
 
           to  further learning,  and  that the  most wise  are  those who  claim
 
           knowledge of no thing, that they may learn all. 
 
 
                                                                             1274

           ** MAGICK 1 -- WHY MAGICK ** 
 
            
 
                           Theability tothink seems toset usapart fromother crea-
 
           tures.  And  although we  are concerned  with  living in  the physical
 
           world, we are mental beings. The fact is we are thinking all the time.
 
           We plan, we brood, we get depressed or elated -- all of it is thought.
 
           But  the universe is mental too, and  if we could control our thinking
 
           we would see magnificent results in the everyday world. 
 
 
 
                           Manysystems have been developedover the agesto help us
 
           control our  thoughts. A great  amount of  dogma too  has been  kicked
 
           around in an attempt to make us into better people. Magick (the occult
 
           kind, spelled with a  'k') is one  of the oldest  and most general  of
 
           these  systems. Magick is the study and application of psychic forces.
 
           It uses mental  training, concentration,  and a system  of symbols  to
 
           program the mind. The  purpose of magick is to alter  the self and the
 
           environment according to the will. 
 
 
 
                           Mostofthe magickwesee todaycomesto usfromancient Egypt
 
           and Chaldea.  The Chinese,  Hindus, and Tibetans  developed their  own
 
           unique types of  magick. Western magick was locked up  by the Egyptian
 
           priests  for thousands  of  years and  then supressed  by the  rise of
 
           Christianity. It was not until  medieval Europe that magical knowledge
 
 
           was rediscovered by the alchemists and Cabalists. Only during the past
 
           hundred years  or so has  western culture been  open minded  enough to
 
           permit widespread investigation  of the subject. Only  since the start
 
           of the twentieth century has science shown much interest in it al all.
 
            
 
           PARAPSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIC PHENOMENA 
 
            
 
                           Through parapsychology, weare gaining insightsinto the
 
           hidden  nature of man. Parapsychology is  a branch of psychology which
 
           studies psychic  phenomena. It remains  something of a  frontier, even
 
           today.  Perhaps one  reason  for this  is that  psychic  phenomena are
 
           somewhat inconsistent. 
 
           Nevertheless, there  is strong evidence  from numerous cases  and exp-
 
           eriments in  support of  psychic phenomena.  Somehow, under the  right
 
           conditions, the mind can directly affect the environment. 
 
 
 
                           Wemaytheorize thatthehumanmind andbodybroadcasts akind
 
           of psychic energy or force, much like a radio station. Kirlian photog-
 
           raphy, temperature effects, cloud chamber tests, and other experiments
 
           tend to support this theory. Although the exact nature of this psychic
 
           force 
 
           is subtle and unknown, it is undoubtedly the energy behind all psychic
 
           phenomena and  magick. However,  it is  *not* a  radio wave,  since it
 
           behaves  somewhat differently.  The psychic  force is  too weak  to be
 
 
                                            1275
 
 
           measured directly  (at least  so far  as we  know). Everyone  has some
 
           psychic ability. There 
 
           are numerous types of psychic phenomena. Parapsychology separates them
 
           into two groups: ESP and PK...  
 
            
 
           EXAMPLES OF ESP 
 
            
 
                           ESP,theabreviation forextrasensoryperception, meansthe
 
           reception  of information  through paranormal  means (ie.  not regular
 
           physical  senses of sight, sound, touch,  smell, or taste). In theory,
 
           this is accomplished by receiving psychic force from outside the body.
 
           Here are some examples of ESP:  
 
                           1)Clairvoyance,orRemote Viewing--the abilitytosense or
 
           'see' (non-physically)  distant objects, places,  and people. Individ-
 
           uals who see ghosts and spirits are probably clairvoyant.  
 
                   2) Clairaudience, or remote hearing -- the 'hearing' 
 
           of paranormal information. 
 
                           3)AstralProjection(OOBE)or TravelingClairvoyance--Full
 
           experience at a remote location while the physical body sleeps.  
 
                   4) Psychometry -- the reading of information by the 
 
           touch of physical objects. 
 
                           5) Telepathicreceiver --the ability todirectly receive
 
           thought (communication) at  a distance, with no physical connection to
 
           the sender.  There are many  everyday examples  of this,  in which  we
 
 
                                            1276
 
 
           think something just as another  person is about to say it. This is an
 
           easy  one  to  test for  through  experiment. Very  dramatic  cases of
 
           telepathy  have been recorded; there is  often an emotional element in
 
           such cases.  
 
                           6) A 'channel'or medium, asin a seance,who is indirect
 
           communication with a 'spirit' or entity.  
 
                           7) Experiencewith a Ouija board,pendulum, or automatic
 
           writing. 
 
                           8) Precognition--to forseethefuture. Again,highlyemot-
 
           ional events are the ones most likely to be 'tuned in'.  
 
                           9) Retrocognition-- knowledgeof the past,by paranormal
 
           means. 
 
             
 
           EXAMPLES OF PK 
 
            
 
                           PK, the abreviation forpsychokinesis, is the active or
 
           sending side  of psychic phenomena.  The theory  here is that  psychic
 
           force is sent out from the individual. Examples of PK include:  
 
                           1)Telepathicsender --thetransmitterin thetelepathyjust
 
           discussed. 
 
                           2)Psychokinesis (ortelekinesis) proper-- theability to
 
           move objects by means of psychic force. 
 
                           3)Somewhatalong thesamelinesarepoltergeist(noisyghost)
 
           phenomena in  which objects move  of their  own accord  or noises  are
 
 
                                            1277
 
 
           heard. There is always a human  agent involved -- frequently a teenage
 
           girl -- who appears to be the source of psychic energy.  
 
                           4)Psychic healing-- theability toheal variousillnesses
 
           and  infirmities. There are many documented  cases of this. Usually it
 
           involves  a healer  and  a subject,  although there  are  recent cases
 
           invloving cancer patients learning to heal themselves.  
 
                           5)Teleportation, apportation,andlevitation. Someoccul-
 
           tists  feel a magician  producing PK effects  is simply a  channel for
 
           universal  energy. Others think the force originates some way directly
 
           within the magician. 
 
            
 
           THE SUBCONSCIOUS  
 
            
 
                           Postulated byFreud andothers, theconcept of thesubcon-
 
           scious mind is an important  one. Basicly, this is the idea  that part
 
           of the mind  normally operates below or outside of ordinary conscious-
 
           ness and  awareness. Dreams and  hypnosis are  examples of this.  Also
 
           subconscious are the many 
 
           automatic  functions of  the  physical body  such  as respiration  and
 
           digestion.

           WHY DO MAGICK? 
 
            
 
                           Magickencompassesmanythings-- scienceandart,philosophy
 
           and  metaphysics, psychology  and comparative  religion. Magick  is an
 
           adventure at  the borderlands of the unknown. It can fit the pieces of
 
           the puzzel of life into a meaningful whole. 
 
                           *Magick is fun*and interesting. Usemagick to helpraise
 
           consciousness without drugs.  Gain new experiences.  Fantacy  can come
 
           alive  through magick. Psychic phenomena can  be controlled and be fun
 
           and helpful. 
 
                           *Magick isbeneficial*. It canhelp you tohave excellent
 
           health, and bring you good luck. With magick life  runs smoothly; life
 
           is  good. Also use magick for  personality improvement, to control bad
 
           habits and to develop new motivations. 
 
                           *Magickis
                                   powerful*.Neverunderestimatethetremendouspower
 
           of magick. Use magick to alter events and to achieve your goals. Exert
 
           an influence  over people and phenomena. But power for its own sake is
 
           self defeating. The power which magick can give you should not be your
 
           primary 
 
           reason for studying it. 
 
            
 
           MAGICK AND WITCHCRAFT 
 
            
 
 
                                            1279
 
 
                           A numberof other occult disciplinesare prevalent today
 
           besides magick. There are many cults and sects which profess their own
 
           views, but there  are really few differences between them. One popular
 
           area in the  occult today is witchcraft. This is  far removed from the
 
           cliche of devil 
 
           worship. Real witchcraft is a nature religion  (pagan). Witchcraft has
 
           much in common with magick. 
 
 
 
                           Alchemy alsohas muchin common withmagick. It'sheritage
 
           comes  from the middle ages. Alchemy  fathered chemistry and the phys-
 
           ical sciences. But  the avowed purpose of  alchemy, turning lead  into
 
           gold,  is too  limiting to  be called  magick. Sometimes  the goal  of
 
           alchemy is interpreted  in another way, as  the transformation of  man
 
           into a spiritual being.  
 
 
 
                           Thentherearethe numerousmodernday seersor'pychics', as
 
           they like to be called, who  operate within their own somewhat  unique
 
           systems. Although many  of these people are  deluded frauds, some  are
 
           very powerful occultists indeed.

                           Of course,everything Ihavesaid hereis ageneralization.
 
           Magick, witchcraft, alchemy, or any occult field are complex subjects.
 
           Suffice it to say that magick  includes them all (it is eclectic). For
 
           magick is  undoubtedly a philosophy  which has,  as the late  Aleister
 
           Crowley wrote, 
 
           "The method of science -- the aim of religion."

           ** MAGICK 2 -- THE SUBJECTIVITY OF EXPERIENCE -- **
 
 
 
                   ' The universe is a projection of ourselves;
 
                   an image as unreal as that of our faces in a
 
                   mirror....We cannot affirm any quality in an
 
                   object as being independent of our sensorium,
 
                   or as being in itself that which it seems to
 
                   us. Nor can we assume that what we cognize is
 
                   more than a partial phantom of its cause.'
 
                             ( --Aleister Crowley, Magick, p. 110)

           it is  mostly based  upon the physical  senses(hearing, sight,  smell,
 
           touch, taste). These  five senses continually send  information to the
 
           mind, and it is up to
 
           the  mind to select and interpret  them. If you could  not do so, your
 
           senses  would overwhelm you and be  meaningless.  Selection and inter-
 
           pretation  of your sensory inputs  is essentially an automatic, mostly

           subconscious  function  of  the mind.  The  program or  map  which the
 
           subconscious follows
 
           as  its reference point  is called a  'model'. The model  is a subcon-
 
           scious  mental photograph  of  how you  believe the  world  looks (ie.
 
           worldview, mindset, egregore, or belief system).  It was built up from
 
           an early age  by your religious and cultural background through inter-
 
           action with family and
 
           others.  It  contains your  experiences,  attitudes,  and habits.  And
 
           whether  you  realize  it or  not,  most of  your  behavior, thoughts,
 
           feelings, and  habits are based  upon and  conditioned by that  model;
 
           even  personality. The  model is  one of  the mind's  master programs.
 
           Change in  behavior generally requires  a change  in the model.  These
 
           limitations built into our way of thinking cause our perceptions to be
 
           subjective.  That is  why  Hindu philosophy  looks upon  the  world as
 
           illusory (maya); the world itself (object) is not an illusion, however
 
           from our viewpoint through perception
 
           (subject) it is.
 
            
 
                           Thus weare allconditioned byexperience. Exceptthat our
 
           perceptions, hence our experiences,  are first conditioned and limited
 
           by the model. Our perceptions and experiences tend  to conform to what
 
           we expect. We tend to misinterpret or ignore things which do not match
 
           our
 
           preconcieved notions about them. This is automatic.

           THE TRUE WILL
 
 
 
                           The forgoingdemonstrates how itis thatthere are somany
 
           different versions of 'truth'. One's particular view is  almost arbit-
 
           rary. Although numerous  religions, philosophies,  and occult  systems
 
           abound,  they do  not contradict  one and  other as  much as  it might
 
           appear.  Rather, they describe the same (universal) reality taken from
 
           different  perspectives. For  there can  be no  ultimate truth  in the
 
           physical  world. We  can only  base our  actions upon  assumptions and
 
           agreements.  All experience  is  subjective. I  like to  think  of the
 
           universe as something indescribable,  perhaps a 4-dimentional 'thing'.
 
           As soon as we attempt to put it into our 3-dimentional knowledge-base,
 
           something changes and  we only see an aspect of  the big picture. Just
 
           as a photograph can only show us a flat *representation*  of a greater
 
           thing, so  it is with any  attempt to describe *spiritual  reality* in
 
           physical terms.
 
                           Yet,there isa separatereality withineach of uswhich is
 
           often ignored unless we seek  it. This inner self is in  magick called
 
           the 'true  will'. The  true will is  the center  of consciousness  and
 
           identity. It  is the 'real you'.   Everything else is  an interface or
 
           link  to it from  the outer (illusory) world.  Since that interface is
 
           based upon our model, it is conditoned and may sometimes produce false
 
           information. 'Do what thou wilt' (Crowley)  is an axiom of magick; for
 
 
 
 
                                            1285
 
 
           the true  will expresses  our exact  desires. And  what we  truly want
 
           ('down deep') we tend to automatically
 
           get. This  isn't always in our best interests, since the true will can
 
           be conditioned (tricked) by the illusion; and then we might desire and
 
           obtain  that  which  is not  ultimately  good for  us.  (Karma strikes
 
           again!) The task  of the magician therefor is to awaken his awareneess
 
           of the true will, to be free of conditioning, and thereby to transcend
 
           maya. ('My will unconditioned is magical' -- Spare).

           largely  a matter  of determination.  It equires  that you  ignore the

           permananent change to occur.  There are two ways  to do this:  direct,
 
           through will power and awareness alone -- observing  and acting out in
 
           an unattached  or indifferent  manner;  and indirect  -- through  con-
 
           ditioning such as  affirmation (explained  later), self-hypnosis,  and
 
           magick. Meditation may help too, by relaxing tension and conflict. 
 
 
 
                           Emotionsfollowphysical expression:smileandact happyand
 
           you  will tend to feel  and be happy. The same  is also true for other
 
           emotions.  Also,  emotions can  be  purposely used  (or  programed) to
 
           replace other emotions.   Using this technique, a magician is somewhat
 
           like an actor
 
           in that he learns how  to turn his emotions  on and off at will.  Note
 
           that this  is not 'fakeing it'; the magician is probably more in touch
 
           with his true feelings than most  people. And for these reasons we say
 
           that happiness is being happy.

           SYSTEMS OF MAGICK
 
 
 
                           Magickalwaysinvolvesself-hypnosis.However, itmaybemore
 
           than that. For  one thing, there are objective forces  involved (or so
 
           it would seem). Deities, spirits, and cosmic force can have  an indep-
 
           endent  existence.  And  the  repetitive  physical movement  sometimes
 
           involved in ritual can itself generate PK force. On the other hand, it
 
           could  be argued that all of  this is subjective to  the magician.  Or
 
           that  the deities  and  spirits are  nothing more  than  architypes or
 
           cosmic patterns  which the magician  energizes with his  own vitality.
 
           Perhaps all magical effects could be produced through hypnosis  alone.
 
           But the effects are certainly real.

                           Greatcomplexityisnotnecessaryinmagick.Although basicly
 
           magick is  a medieval system of  symbolism (in a  modern context), any
 
           cosmological system will work from Cabala to Star Wars. We usually use
 
           the  medieval one in magick because  it is convenient and traditional,
 
           and
 
           because  it seems  to  fit our  thought processes  well.   Traditional
 
           symbols have greater emotional effect on the magician than modern ones
 
           because of his familiarity  with them. What really matters is that the
 
           model of the magician be understood and programmed,  and thus that the
 
           model and the cosmological system do correspond.
 
 
 
           REVIEW QUESTIONS
 
 
 
           1) Contrast subjective with objective.
 
           2) What is a 'model'?
 
           3) Explain the task of the magician.

           ** MAGICK 3 -- THE FOUR WORLDS ** 
 
            
 
                           Theancientsdescribed manasmind, body,andsoul. Psychol-
 
           ogists of the  twentieth century added the  subconscious to that  def-
 
           finition. This  produces a  four-fold classification. The  universe is
 
           also divided into four corresponding parts ('worlds'), as shown below:
 
            
 
           WORLD                   BODY                      QUALITY 
 
           =====                   ====                      ======= 
 
            
 
           spiritual world    spiritual body (soul or kia)   intuition 
 
           mental world       mental body (conscious mind)   rationalthought 
 
           astral world       astral body (subconscious)     emotions 
 
           physical world     physical body                  physical senses 
 
            
 
                           Theastral body(subconscious)is theintermediary forint-
 
           uition, magical and  psychic phenomena, and is  the 'psychic link'  to
 
           the physical world. J.H. Brennan says that the astral is  the realm of
 
 
 
 
                                            1291
 
 
           visual imagination.  It seems  to be  both a 'place'  and a  'state of
 
           mind' at the 
 
           same  time. Most occult and magical  phenomena originate in the invis-
 
           ible, non-sensate,  non-physical realm (ie. without  physical senses).
 
           Each  of the  four  worlds interacts  with the  other  worlds. Psychic
 
           energy flows from the spiritual to  mental to astral to physical.  The
 
           physical world is a  projection (manifestation, reflection, or shadow)
 
           of the higher  worlds. Our center of consciousness is generally within
 
           these  higher worlds.  "We are",  to quote  the rock  music  group the
 
           Police, "spirits in the material world".

                           Therearemanysimilar termsusedby otheroccultgroups. For
 
           example, 'astral light'  is another name for astral world, although it
 
           may  sometimes also  refer to  the entire  non-physical realm,  as may
 
           'inner planes' or  'the invisible world'.  Planes are essentially  the
 
           same as  worlds.  Vehicles  or sheaths  are the same  as bodies.  Some
 
           groups  include an etheric or vital  body between physical and astral:
 
           it is mostly  'physical' with a little of  the lower 'astral' besides.
 
           And sometimes astral and mental are each divided into two parts (upper
 
           and lower). The 'causal body' is the upper 'mental'. 
 
            
 
           MICROCOSM AND MACROCOSM 
 
            
 
                           Wehavebeendescribing'traditonal'occultphilosophy here,
 
           and certainly  an important  part of  the tradition  is the  idea (and
 
           terms) microcosm and  macrocosm.  The greater  universe, known as  the
 
           *macrocosm*, includes everything that  exists. It corresponds with the
 
           *microcosm*, 
 
           or tiny universe,  ie. man -- who is thought of as a miniature replica
 
           of the macrocosm (whole universe).  This basic magical relationship is
 
           demonstrated in the  Bible (Genesis 1.27), where God is the macrocosm;
 
           and in the  writing of Trismegistus ("As above so  below").  Since man
 
           is in the image of  God (universe) it follows that God is in the image
 
           of man  (in other words,  man and the God/universe  match each other).
 
 
                                            1293
 
 
           The magician,  as a microcosm  is thus  connected with the  macrocosm.
 
           There  is an intimate relationship of  energies between you and every-
 
           thing else.   The universe is reflected within us and we are projected
 
           into  the universe.  This  is an  important theory  behind  magick and
 
           astrology. 
 
            
 
           MAGICK WHITE AND BLACK 
 
            
 
                           'Personalmagick' is thatmagick used toaffect the self;
 
           often   involving  affirmation,  self-suggestion,  and  self-hypnosis.
 
           'Active magick'  is outer directed  magick (as in  PK) used to  affect
 
           someone or thing, or to  bring about an event. 'Passive magick'  is to
 
           be affected (as in ESP) 
 
           by an outside non-physical cause. Everyone possesses some magical (and
 
           psychic)  potential. Some  are especially  gifted. Usually  people are
 
           better at one kind of magick (ie. active or passive) than they  are at
 
           the other kind; only rarely does an individual excell at both. Traning
 
           and practice will, of course, improve ability somewhat.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                            1294
 
 
                Although the  forces of magick  are neutral, various  systems may
 
           take  on the  qualities  of good  and evil.  There is  so-called white
 
           magick or  good magick, black magick  or evil magick,  and gray magick
 
           between them. When many people refer  to white magick they mean magick
 
           for  unselfish purposes, also healing  and mental influence with spec-
 
           ific permission. By  black magick they refer to magick for self-inter-
 
           est  and  healing  *without* specific  permission.    Using  magick to
 
           forcefully control another's  will is, in a  sense, black magick  too.
 
           There  are also  some people  on the  occult fringe  who claim  to be,
 
           possibly even think they are,  'Satanists', devil worshipers, or black
 
           magicians.  These people  are most  likely charlatans,  hoaxters, dab-
 
           blers, or  merely misinformed. They may  be attracted by the  'art' of
 
           black magick, or even by the 'glamor' of doing something 
 
           against  the 'rules'.  But a  real black  magician is  very dangerous.
 
           Because he  has dedicated his life to evil. We usually think of 'white
 
           magick' as  having *unselfish intent*,  and (in  the extreme case)  of
 
           'black magick' as 
 
           being  actual  Satan worship,  human  or  animal sacrifice,  dangerous
 
           unconventional magical practices,  and other bizarre stuff  as makes a
 
           nightmare.  It is  all  a matter  of degree.  Most  mild self-interest
 
           magick (one of the most  common kinds) would be called 'gray'.  Better
 
           terms may be 
 
           *constructive magick*  as being  beneficial; and *aversive  magick* as
 
           magick  intended to work against the  natural order, and to tear down.
 
 
                                            1295
 
 
           There is also  the *high magick* of  spiritual alchemy (ie.  spiritual
 
           growth), also known as 'the Great Work'; and conversely  there is 'low
 
           magick' which is concerned with materiality.  
 
 
 
                           Any magickactislikelyto producesideeffectsregardlessof
 
           whether or  not the desired result is achieved.  Such side effects are
 
           no problem for constructive magick, since they are benificial as well.
 
           However, aversive magick can  produce aversive side effects  which may
 
           even harm the magician -- aversive magick is dangerous!

           MAGICK IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS 
 
            
 
                           Whatwe havebeencalling 'magick'is actuallya continuous
 
           process.  Since your  subconscious  never rests,  your environment  is
 
           continually  being shifted  into line  with your  model. This  is true
 
           whether you study  magick or not.  For most  people, these effects are
 
           usually very subtle, and they are probably not aware of them. However,
 
           as you work 
 
           with the occult,  the flow of psychic energy and  your awareness of it
 
           increases. Your  true will is  more likely  to be strongly  expressed.
 
           Your luck  may be affected (either  in a positive or  a negative way).
 
           Remember, our lives tend to follow what we want down deep. That is why
 
           a positive 
 
           outlook is so very beneficial to us. 
 
            
 
 
 
 
 
           THE MAGICAL DIARY 
 
            
 
                           Sometimes it ishelpful to keep a diary of your magical
 
           experiments and  research.  Such  a  diary should  include  the  date,
 
           perhaps even some  astrological data (or anything  else you think  may
 
           have a relationship to what you are doing).  This is also a  good time
 
 
                                            1297
 
 
           to begin recording your dreams  -- at least the important ones -- in a
 
           dream diary. Your dreams 
 
           can  tell you  a great deal  about yourself, and  may sometimes reveal
 
           premonitions.  Dreams  are personal.  Don't  fall  for the  commercial
 
           'dream book' gimmick. 
 
            
 
           AFFIRMATIONS 
 
            
 
                           Themind is always open to suggestion -- especially the
 
           subconscious. Most of  the time we censor any suggestions according to
 
           the model; but one way to break through the censor is with repetition.
 
           An affirmation does this exactly. By suggestion, we mean any statement
 
           which is capable of affecting your model. Usually suggestion is in the
 
           form of a positive statement (such as the hypnotist's patter  -- " You
 
           are becomming  sleepy"). An affirmation is the same kind of thing -- a
 
           positive suggestion,  which you repeat  (affirm) to yourself  aloud or
 
           silently  (for example,  "I  remember my  dreams"). If  there  is some
 
           quality you wish to change or develope within yourself, an affirmation
 
           is ideal. Repeat it several times every day at several different times
 
           throughout the day, 
 
           expecially when you go to bed. Affirmations are subtle and may require
 
           a few months to work. Use them for changes, not miracles. 
 
            
 
           SIMPLE BANISHING TECHNIQUE

           the  subconscious. A  good  example of  this is  the  simple banishing
 
           technique which  follows. Banishing is  used in  magick to 'clear  the
 
           air' of negative 'vibes' and interference...  
 
            
 
                           Visualize astrong white lightflowing outthe top ofyour
 
           head,  flowing down  around you  and  covering you.  At the  same time
 
           imagine  you are  throwing  away any  'problem' vibes.    Maintain the
 
           visualization for  a half a minute  or longer.   Good way to  help you
 
           handle your emotions, and to control worry or anger.

           ** MAGICK 4 -- ELEMENTS AND FORCES **
 
 
 
                           The Ancientsdividedthe worldintofour basicprinciplesor
 
           *elements* -- earth, water, fire, and air.   That viewpoint has mostly
 
           changed  with advances  of science,  but the  four elements  are still
 
           accepted in magick,  for they are more  closely linked with  emotions,
 
           the human psyche, and with nature than are modern  explanations of the
 
           world. These
 
           *magical elements*  are also of  some importance  in astrology.   Many
 
           occultists think of  the magical elements as forces, or as *qualities*
 
           of energy;  especially within  the astral world.   Each element  has a
 
           symbol and color. (Common symbols are -- fire: a triangle pointing up;
 
           air:  a triangle pointing  up and with  a horizontal line  through the
 
           middle  of it;  water:  a triangle  pointing down;  earth:  a triangle
 
           pointing  down and with  a horizontal line through  the middle of it.)
 
           Colors of  the elements are  -- earth: brown  and green; water:  blue;
 
           fire:  red; air:  yellow...The Eastern  tattvic system  uses different

           symbols and colors.  (The tattvic symbols are  briefly described later
 
           on in this course.)  The elements are often used in magick ritual.

           are called 'correspondences'. Although magical correspondences are not
 
           literally equal to one another,  you can think of them that  way (such
 
           as gold  equals sun). Tables  of these relationships,  called 'Corres-
 
           pondence Tables', are available (an important one is Crowley's '777').
 
           Thus  one thing  or symbol  can be  used to  suggest another.  This is
 
           important in
 
           magick, for the magician may surround himself with as many appropriate
 
           correspondences as he  can to vividly affect  the senses; thus  making
 
           his magical contact with the inner planes more lucid.

                           The magicalelements are saidto bepeopled by spiritsand
 
           mythological entities called  elementals or nature spirits.  These are
 
           grouped into four main categories --
 
 
                                            1303

           country away  from cities --  especially if you  are tired  or sleepy.
 
           Although elementals exist naturally, it is also possible to create one
 
           which will exist for a limited time -- no elemental has immortality. A
 
           created elemental is called
 
           an 'artificial elemental'.

           the universe. However,  some contemporary occultists see  them only as
 
           symbols  for forces  and  otherwise not  'real' at  all.  Another word
 
           sometimes  used  for  elemental  is 'familiar'  (usually  in  medieval
 
           witchcraft); the term  is ambiguous, as it might merely be an ordinary
 
           household pet such as a dog or cat.

           ** MAGICK 5 -- CHAKRAS AND MEDITATION ** 
 
            
 
                           AccordingtoEastIndianphilosophy,manpossessessevenmajor
 
           *chakras*  or  psychic centers  on his  body.  Each of  these  forms a
 
           bridge,  link, or  energy transformer;  changing pure  (higher) energy
 
           into  various forms,  and connecting the  four bodies  (ie. spiritual,
 
           mental, astral, and physical) together.  The chakras are located along
 
           the nadies  (a network of  psychic nerves or channels)  and follow the
 
           autonomic nervous  system   along the  spinal cord. Chakras  correlate
 
           with major  acupuncture points  along the 'governing  vessel meridian'
 
           (acupuncture term).  The seven major chakras are connected together by
 
           three major nadies  which are parallel and near each other. The middle
 
           nadi is called *sushumna* and it has neutral characteristics. The nadi
 
           on the left (ie. nearest your  left hand) is the *ida* nadi which  has
 
           yin characteristics. On the other side of sushumna 
 
           (nearest  your right hand) is the  *pingala* nadi, having yang qualit-
 
           ies.

           rotating circles or funnels. In the East they are described as petaled
 
           flowers or lotuses. Sources disagree on the  colors. 
 
            
 
                           The first chakra,located at thebase of the spineat the
 
           perineum is the *root chakra*, muladhara. It primarily  relates to the
 
           element of earth and to psychic smell.  
 
                           Thesecondchakra,knownasthe*sacralcenter*,svadhisthana,
 
           is  located above  and behind  the genitals.  Its dominant  element is
 
           water, and it is related to psychic taste. 
 
                           Thirdof thechakrasisthe*solar plexus*,manipura,located
 
           at the navel and corresponding with  the emotions and with the element
 
           of fire; also with psychic sight (clairvoyance).  
 
                           The*heart chakra*,anahata, isthe fourthchakra, located
 
           over the  heart and corresponding  with the  element of air,  and also
 
           with psychic touch. 
 
                           Thefifthchakraisthe*throat chakra*,vishuddha,locatedat

                           The remainingtwo chakrasare very important.They relate
 
           mostly to elevated states of  consciousness. The *frontal chakra*, (or
 
           'third eye') ajna,  the sixth chakra, is located between, and slightly
 
           above,  the eyebrows.  Ajna is the  center of  psychic powers  and can
 
           produce  many psychic  effects.  Meditation on  ajna is  said  to cure
 
           nervousness. 
 
 
 
                           Finally,the*crownchakra*,sahasrara,locatedatopthehead,
 
           (pineal gland) is the seventh chakra.  It is referred to as the thous-
 
           and-petaled lotus and corresponds  with astral projection and enlight-
 
           enment. 
 
            
 
                           Thereare alsomany minorchakras throughoutthebody. Each
 
           chakra  has a sound  (letter) and a  pitch which is  sometimes used to
 
           invoke it.

                           Someoccultists preferto describethe magicalelements as
 
           tattvas according to the Eastern system. Notice that these symbols and

           colors are generally different than the western symbols and colors for
 
           the elements.

           YOGA 
 
            
 
                           Yoga originated inIndia. It is aphysical or mentaldis-
 
           cipline designed to condition and invigorate the mind and body.  There
 
           are many kinds of yoga,  but they may be generally divided  into three
 
           main types... 
 
                           Hathayoga--affect themindthrough thebodyusing physical
 
           exercises; improve physical health and endurance. 
 
                           Rajayoga-- affectthemindthrough mentaltraining;improve
 
           concentration. 
 
                           Mantrayoga --affect themind throughchanting andaffirm-
 
           ation; achieve relaxation. 
 
            
 
           MEDITATION 
 
            
 
                           This is a much touted areaof the occult. There aremany
 
           meditation  techniques,  and many  claims  made  for  the benefits  of
 
           meditation. Basicly,  meditation has two functions  -- relaxation, and
 
           perhaps, improved concentration. There are two main types... 
 
            
 
                   1) concentration meditation (focusing), 
 
                   2) insight meditation (mindfullness). 
 
            
 
 
                                            1313
 
 
           Most  kinds  of meditation  are  the  concentrative type.  One  simply
 
           focuses his attention upon a single physical object (such  as a candle
 
           flame); upon a sensation (such  as that felt while walking  or breath-
 
           ing);  upon an  emotion (such  as reverence  or love);  upon a  mantra
 
           spoken aloud  or even silently; or upon  a visualization (as in chakra
 
           meditation, seebelow)...Concentration  meditation  is, simply  put,  a
 
           form of self-hypnosis. 
 
            
 
                           Amantra(or mantrum)is oneormore wordsorsyllables which
 
           are repeated --  often chanted -- aloud...A simple yet powerful mantra
 
           is  to vibrate  the  mystical word  'OM'.  This mantra  has  long been
 
           associated in India with the  godhead/unity.  Use it to aid  in tuning
 
           into universal  vibrations which  promote feelings of  harmony, peace,
 
           and well-being. Use it before magick ritual to 'get into the mood' and
 
           afterward to 'dismiss the 
 
           forces'. You vibrate  a mantra by saying it slowly  aloud in a lower--
 
           pitched voice  than your  normal speech, and  a more or  less constant
 
           pitch as well. Let the sound fade at the end of the mantra. A powerful
 
           one such as 'OM' will seem to vibrate the air around you. It should be
 
           vocalized  for 5-10 seconds and repeated a  number of times with a few
 
           seconds rest between each vocalization.  Chanting of mantras may cause
 
           slight dizziness from hyperventilation. 
 
            
 
 
 
 
                                            1314
 
 
                           Theothermaintype ofmeditaiton-- insightmeditation-- is
 
           the analysis  of thoughts  and  feelings in  such a  way  as to  cause
 
           realization of  the subjectivity and  illusion of experience.  This is
 
           done in  a effort to  attain trancendental awareness.  Such statements
 
           as, 'This  body is not me', fall  under this category. Buddhist medit-
 
           ations are usually of this type. 
 
            
 
           CHAKRA MEDITATION 
 
            
 
                           Thereis aspecialtype ofconcentrativemeditation whichwe
 
           will  call 'Chakra meditation'. This is  basicly Kundalini yoga -- the
 
           practice of  causing psychic energy  (kundalini) to flow  up sushumna,
 
           energizing the various chakras along the way. The practice, considered
 
           dangerous by 
 
           some, will produce  deffinite physiological sensations  and psycholog-
 
           ical effects  if continued long enough. It  should not be attempted by
 
           epileptics or persons with  an unstable mental or  physical condition,
 
           or with heart  disease. Certain drugs and  medications, such as  those
 
           used to treat  epilepsy may retard progress. Although the technique is
 
           very simple,  it may eventually produce powerful  results. Results may
 
           at first appear hours after the practice during  sleep. As each chakra
 
           is energized  by this practice, it  is said to add  occult powers (si-
 
           dhis), until  at last the crown  chakra is reached, and  with it, full
 
           enlightenment is attained. Sometimes kundalini awakens all by itself.

           the chakras, beginning with the root chakra, and moving  progressively
 
           up, as  you visualize psychic energy from the root chakra traveling up
 
           shushumna and  vivifying  each  higher  chakra. As  we  mentioned  the
 
           chakras have  certain properties  associated with  them, so that  this
 
           type of visualization may 
 
           'raise consciousness', promote astral  projection, and other things --
 
           once you have reached ajna and eventually the crown chakra. You  might
 
           typically  meditate in this  fashion for 15  minutes to a  half hour a
 
           day. It  might  help to  practice some  hatha yoga  or other  physical
 
           exercise  in an effort to  make the spinal  cord 'more flexible'. Diet
 
           may also  affect the  process. The  technique is  also similar  to the
 
           Tibetan 'Tummo'  meditation.    The  rise of  kundalini  is  sometimes
 
           experienced as a 'vibration' or buzzing, as light, or as heat.

           HEALTH AND DIET 
 
            
 
                           Certainly theway you treatyour physicalbody willaffect
 
           your mind. In magick you want an alert mind. Therefore, your body must
 
           be  as healthy as you  can keep it.  Take care of  your body. Exercise
 
           regularly.  eat a  good diet  (with vitamin  supplements), and  do not
 
           consume  anything which  will have  a negative  effect upon  the mind.
 
           Drugs, smoking,, and alcohol 
 
           should be restricted,  or eliminated. (The mind can create any condit-
 
           ion which a drug  can create.) A good rule here is  moderation in what
 
           and how  much you consume. (Most of this stuff is pretty obvious isn't
 
           it.) You may also want to cut down  on sugar and processed foods. Many
 
           occultists advise dietary changes,  expecially the non-eating of meat.
 
           We cannot deny the 
 
           physical, psychological,  and spiritual  effect which all  foods have.
 
           This  effect may  be  described as  the 'heaviness'  factor  of foods.
 
           Various foods are so ranked in the chart, lighter to heavier... 
 
            
 
                   1.  lettuce and other greens. 
 
                   2.  fruits and most vegetables. 
 
                   3.  wheat, rice, and other grains. 
 
                   4.  nuts, beans, and other legumes. 
 
                   5.  cheese, dairy products, including eggs. 
 
 
                                            1317
 
 
                   6.  fish, seafood. 
 
                   7.  chicken, poultry. 
 
                   8.  beef, pork, other red meats. 
 
            
 
           Note that  meats,  especially  red meats  are  the  'heaviest'  foods.
 
           Generally, foods which  are harder to digest,  or which are  higher in
 
           protein are 'heavier'  than those which are  not. Animal products  are
 
           heavier than plants. Foods high in carbohydrate (candy, bread, starch)
 
           are  heavy. However, the 'heaviness' of  foods is not directly related
 
           to the amount of calories.

                           Whatthismeansis thatforvarious reasons,theheaviness of
 
           food  in your  diet will affect  your magical experiences.  You may be
 
           able  to increase your psychic receptivity  ('energy level') by eating
 
           lighter foods, or  by eating less. Conversely, emphasizing heavy foods
 
           in your diet, or eating  larger helpings, may help to 'bring  you down
 
           to earth' should you 'rent the veil'  too much. These are generalizat-
 
           ions,  of course, and it may  take a number of  days of dietary change
 
           before  you notice  much  effect. I  do not  advocate  radical dietary
 
           changes, excessive fasting,  or malnutrition. Your good  health is far
 
           more  important  in  magick than  any  temporary effect  you  get from
 
           prolonged starvation. A change in diet will sometimes only 
 
           produce  a temporary  effect, until  the physical  body adapts  to the
 
           change. Healthy natural foods and  lifestyle make it easier for  us to
 
           be  healthy, but  ultimately, good  health is  a mentual  quality (at-
 
           titude). 
 
            
 
           THE FOUR-FOLD BREATH 
 
            
 
                           With physicalexercise too, moderation isadvised.  (You
 
           should  be cautious, or  not attempt it  if you have  a respiratory or
 
           heart  condition. Check  with your  physician if  in doubt,  and don't
 
           overdo.) One of  the most useful physical  exercises is pranayama,  or
 
           controlled  breathing (actually a  type of  hatha yoga  exercise). For
 
 
                                            1319
 
 
           this and any other calesthentics or  hatha yoga which you might choose
 
           to do  a 'kitchen timer'  is suggested (many of  these aren't accurate
 
           for under three minutes, but are helpful for longer periods).

                           Themain purposeofpranayama isto relaxthe bodyand mind.
 
           There are many kinds of pranayama, but a simple one called the 'four--
 
           fold  breath' will suffice. This consists  of four short quick inhall-
 
           ations, then  four short  quick exhallations; then  repeat, continuing
 
           until the allotted time is used  up. It will take about 1 1/2  seconds
 
           for  the  four inhallations,  and  about 1  1/2 seconds  for  the four
 
           exhallations; or about  3 seconds for the complete in-out cycle ('rep'
 
           for repetition). There  should be  no strain of  any kind during  your
 
           pranayama. You  will probably notice a  slight dizziness, particularly
 
           at  first, since  the effect  of pranayama  is to  hyperventilate. Try
 
           sitting back in a chair with your eyes closed when you  do your prana-
 
           yama.  Begin a minute a day for  the first week and gradually increase
 
           up to about five minutes a day. If you do the pranayama befor 
 
           your magical activity, it will help you to get 'into the mood'.  It is
 
           also an excellent  aid to relaxation and  tension release.   Pranayama
 
           should not  be done during  heavy air  pollution. Other exercises  you
 
           might consider are hatha yoga, calesthentics, walking or jogging.

           ** MAGICK 6 -- THOUGHTFORMS AND SPIRITS ** 
 
            
 
                           Although there are hundredsof kinds of divination, the
 
           principle ones are  astrology, geomancy, the tarot,  the I Ching,  and
 
           direct psychic  means (especially  clairvoyance).  True  divination is
 
           more than  a mechanical system,  for it  implies true psychic  interp-
 
           retation (receiving). Some  form of divination is often used in magick
 
           ritual to communicate with 
 
           the entity invoked. 
 
 
 
                           Sincedivination operatesthroughthemind,itisaffectedand
 
           biased by the  mind. Our attitudes and  fears may alter  it. Sometimes
 
           results are very detailed,  and accurate -- but not always.  Often the
 
           future  is plastic and  changeable anyway, and  the use of  magick may
 
           alter the result.  Thus divination shows tendencies only, which may be
 
           helpful, but must not rule us. 
 
            
 
           DEVELOPING CLAIRVOYANCE

                           It ispossible toimprove yournatural abilitywith clair-
 
           voyance through  practice. A good  start might be to  look around you,
 
           then  close your  eyes and try  to picture your  surroundings. This is
 
           also  good exercise for visualization. And  visualization is an essen-
 
           tial talent  in magick. Open your eyes  again and check your accuracy.
 
           Then close your eyes and try it 
 
           again. When you  use your  physical eyes,  look at  everything like  a
 
           child seeing it  for the first  time. Let the  vividness of color  and
 
           form burn into you, until everything takes on a veritable glow. Try to
 
           capture that  glow  when you  close  your eyes  now and  picture  your
 
           surroundings. It's just a simple step to extend what you see with your
 
           eyes closed  into what you remember  seeing in the next  room, or what
 
           you *imagine*  seeing in the  next building, the  next city,  even the
 
           other  side of the world. Don't  expect perfect results, especially at
 
           first.  Just try  to  be even  partly right.  Another  exercise is  to
 
           picture a clock face, and thereby tell the time 
 
           clairvoyantly.

           THE AURA 
 
            
 
                           Underthe rightconditions,it ispossible toclairvoyantly
 
           observe  a colored  light around other  people. This  is known  as the
 
           'aura'.  Sometimes the aura is seen as multi-colored emanations around
 
           the person, built  up of various differently colored layers and zones.
 
           Although many 
 
           occult dabblers claim to be able to see the aura easily and under many
 
           varied conditions, I seriously doubt that they do.   There are optical
 
           illusions and qualities  of sight which can  sometimes trick one  into
 
           thinking he  sees what he does not  see. In this area,  the quality of
 
           sight known as after image is especially pertinent. Do  this: stare at
 
           any solidly colored bright object for a few moments. Very intense red,
 
           green, or  blue are especially good for this. Now look away at a white
 
           surface and you  will see a phantom image  of the object in  its comp-
 
           lementary  color (a  red object  will show  green, a blue  one orange,
 
           etc.).    If the bright object is in front of a light surface, you may
 
           observe a fringe of complementary color 
 
           around the object after a few moments. This is all very normal, and is
 
           used  by some  magical  groups as  an aid  to  visualization sometimes
 
           called 'flashing colors'. Some silly people will stare at other people
 
           in the  same way. And when  they see the  after image of  the person's
 
           clothing,  they think they are seeing  his aura. What is more, various
 
 
                                            1325
 
 
           meanings have been attributed to the colors of the aura. A psychic who
 
           can  see the  aura is supposed  to be  able to  determine that persons
 
           emotional state. Thus  psychic frauds can have  a marvelous time  with
 
           auras.   One deluded  psychic taught  a class I  attended in  which he
 
           performed instant psychoanalysis on the 
 
           basis  of the  supposed aura.  It  was obvious  that  he was  actually
 
           observing after images from the students clothes!

           It is a general guide, based mostly on Theosophical material.  Various
 
           groups  may attribute different meanings to the colors.  The colors we
 
           show  on the  chart are  emotional in  nature; useful  if you  plan to
 
           create an artificial elemental or do healing.     Surrounding yourself
 
           with  a particular  color will  tend to  produce the  specific psycho-
 
           logical  effect described  in the  chart.   That quality  of color  is
 
           useful in magick ritual.

           THOUGHTFORMS AND SPIRITS 
 
            
 
                Whenever  we concentrate  our  thoughts, we  draw psychic  energy
 
           together.   This is  called a  thoughtform.   Usually the  energy dis-
 
           sipates  as soon as we break the  concentration, but it is possible to
 
           purposely  concentrate  energy  in  this way,  producing  very  strong
 
           thoughtforms.  Such thoughtforms are 
 
           vortexes or centers of psychic energy.  They  can exist as entities by
 
           themselves,  at least  for  a while.   They  are  basically inanimate,
 
           non-thinking forces.  Talking to one is about as logical as talking to
 
           a chair.  In this way, thoughtforms are similar to elementals, ghosts,
 
           and  spirits.   All of  these psychic  entities consist  of a  psychic
 
           energy vortex  which could be described  as a localized field  or as a
 
           discontinuity of the physical world. 
 
 
 
                Psychic entities  respond to  certain electrostatic and  magnetic
 
           fields,  and to  other energy  vortexes. That  is why they  respond to
 
           magick  ritual. Someday, we may accomplish  the same thing with elect-
 
           ronic  machines. Psychic  entities are  sometimes able  to affect  our
 
           thought processes. 
 
 
 
                Thoughtforms, elementals, and ghosts  are usually not very smart.
 
           If they display any  intelligence at all, it is limited.  They are the
 
           morons  of the  spirit world.   Their  behavior is  usually automatic,
 
 
                                            1329
 
 
           repetitive, robot-like (just  like some people).   We see that  artif-
 
           icial elementals 
 
           are little  more than  astral robots.   Spirits and  deities are  more
 
           intelligent and volitional. 
 
            
 
           DIRECTED ATTENTION 
 
            
 
                Your  mind  follows  your  attention. Wherever  you  direct  your
 
           attention, there will  your thoughts go too. By directing attention to
 
           a specific place or purpose you *focus* mental energy upon it. 
 
 
 
                For  example: you're  having lunch  in a  cafeteria crowded  with
 
           people. It is a large place, and everyone there is talking at once, so
 
           that  the room is a  constant jumble of noise.  You happen to notice a
 
           man accross  the room; he reminds you of someone. All at once he drops
 
           his fork and you hear it hit the table. But would you have noticed the
 
           sound of his fork if  you had not been  looking? No. Only by  focusing
 
           your attention there were  you able to pick out that  individual event
 
           and associated sound. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                            1330
 
 
 
 
                It is a dark night.  You are walking and the only light  you have
 
           is from the flashlight you hold in your hand.  As you move  the flash-
 
           light around, the  beam of light from it directs  your attention first
 
           one way then another. Now, the mind is something like  that flashlight
 
           in the  dark. And by  directed attention,  you point the  mind to  one
 
           place or another. As with that flashlight beam, you see where the mind
 
           is pointed; nothing more. The rest is 'noise'. And so  we could define
 
           mental noise as anything not focused upon. In another way, noise could
 
           be considered as negative emotions, attitudes, and thoughts which make
 
           it more difficult to direct the attention. 
 
 
 
                Your emotions  follow your  thoughts quite easily.  Your emotions
 
           are  not YOU, but are rather reactions  prompted by your model and ego
 
           -- like  a performance or  an act,  while the real  you watches.  In a
 
           similar way, directing your  attention toward a specific emotion  will
 
           cause you to 
 
           experience that emotion.

           ** MAGICK 7 -- BASIC RITUAL ** 
 
            
 
                   'The first part of every ceremony is the 
 
                   banishing; the second the invoking.' 
 
                              (--Crowley, Magick, p. 104) 
 
            
 
                           Itmay besaid that ritualis thevery heartof magick. For
 
           it is through ritual that we  achieve our magical results. Ritual is a
 
           magical  procedure  or  ceremony we  perform  in order  to  change the
 
           environment.  Usually we think of ritual  as bearing on active magick,
 
           although certainly, it  can also affect passive magick. Most often the
 
           change achieved is subjective (it may  be subtle) and in the  physical
 
           world. Outsiders may put them down to coincidence, but the effects are
 
           very real. Magical goals for a ritual should not be taken lightly. 
 
 
 
                           Thesuccessfulpracticeofmagick dependsuponstrongbelief.
 
           The simplest  ritual of  them all  must be belief  itself. If  you can
 
           believe in your desired results strongly enough, that act is a magical
 
           ritual which will achieve your results. Even a very  complex ritual is
 
 
                                            1334
 
 
           no more effective  than strong belief. There are aids to concentration
 
           which  may help.  Thus  in *creative  visualization*, imagination  and
 
           controlled breathing are brought into play.

           CREATIVE VISUALIZATION 
 
            
 
                           Whenyouwanttomagicallyachievesomething,first pictureit
 
           clearly in your  mind. The more  deffinite and specific  your idea  of
 
           what it  is the better. Picture  yourself having it or  doing it. Vis-
 
           ualize it as vividly and as intensely  as you can and hold it in  your
 
           thoughts for a few 
 
           moments. Concentrate on it intensely (it may help to hold your breath-
 
           ). Feel the energy of desire welling up inside you. Then suddenly feel
 
           the image or desire released from your mind. Feel the energy filtering
 
           through the image and intensifying it, as if the image is a 'stencil'.
 
           Imagine the 
 
           energy exploding  out from you into the macrocosm in all directions at
 
           once, and  feel the universe 'tilt' as it reacts to the force. (At the
 
           same time  it may  help  to release  your breath  suddenly). Feel  the
 
           energy draining from you.  Finally, *believe* that your  purpose *has*
 
           been accomplished; that it 
 
           HAS HAPPENED, perhaps saying something such as "so mote it be", or "it
 
           is done".

           magick ritual  must always reduce  to these stages  -- 1)  imaging; 2)
 
           building; 3)  firing.  Sometimes a  ritual must be  repeated every day
 
           for a while to achieve difficult results or to overcome weak belief.

           THE MAGICK CIRCLE 
 
            
 
                           Often animportantpartofformal ritualisthemagickcircle.
 
           Medieval magicians  considered the circle essential,  and placed great
 
           emphasis  upon its exactness.   Elaborate  designs were  invented with
 
           many layers of complex  symbols and words. It was very  important that
 
           the circle 
 
           be completely  intact with no breaks in it. The magician and any other
 
           participants stand in  the circle during ritual. The ritual began with
 
           a banishing of evil  forces (using the lesser ritual  of the pentagram
 
           for example) to keep them outside  the circle. Today, circles are made
 
           on the floor with chalk  or paint, rock salt, or a  rope. Whatever its
 
           form, the  circle is still an important part of magical protection for
 
           the magician. This is especially  important for aversive entities  and
 
           purposes. The  circle also helps in focusing  the energy of the ritual
 
           toward its purpose,  that is, it keeps it contained until the magician
 
           is ready to release it. Of course, the magick circle is basicly only a
 
           symbol, but  it may eventually  be possible  to supplement the  circle
 
           with electronic equipment for a 
 
           similar  purpose.  We are  researching  the  practicality of  electro-
 
           staticly charged Faraday shields.  
 
            
 
           ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTALS 
 
 
                                            1338
 
 
            
 
                           An artificial elemental isuseful for certain tasks: 1)
 
           invisible  watcher and observer, telling you  what it sees; 2) psychic
 
           guard; 3) it can  be used in healing; 4) it is  helpful in other ways.
 
           Ophiel calls the artificial elemental a 'familiar'. Producing your own
 
           artificial elemental is fairly easy.  YOU MUST ASSUME THAT THE ACT HAS
 
           PRODUCED RESULTS, EVEN IF  YOU DO NOT IMMEDIATELY OBSERVE THEM.  It is
 
           entirely possible to produce one of these little beasties and not know
 
           it (not being clairvoyant enough to 
 
           observe it directly).  Therefore, and this is  a general principle  of
 
           any  magick, never ignore forces you have set into motion. Even though
 
           you may not see the elemental, you may nevertheless 'feel' it.  
 
 
 
                           WARNING-- Donot useartificial elementalsfor anykind of
 
           aversive magick  at this point; they  can be nasty little  critters to
 
           get rid of. Should you have to eliminate one of them which you created
 
           in error, you  must re-absorb it back into yourself through your will;
 
           or in some cases you can 'exorcise' it. 
 
            
 
           HOW TO CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTAL 
 
            
 
                           You cancreate your own artificialelemental for various
 
           purposes. An artificial elemental is basically a thoughtform which has
 
           been  strengthened with emotion. Refer to  the aura color chart in the
 
 
                                            1339
 
 
           previous lesson  and decide what  color to  make the elemental,  based
 
           upon  your intended purpose. Apple green  is a good choice for general
 
           purposes. 
 
           Then  decide on  a shape  or outline.  Do you  want your  elemental to
 
           resemble some sort of animal? A simple circle or cloud is a good place
 
           to start. With  this in mind you can use ritual to create your elemen-
 
           tal.  Creative visualization  is good  for this. Visualize  it glowing
 
           before you. A darkened room is helpful for this. 
 
 
 
                           Communicatewithyourelementalwith telepathy,bytalkingto
 
           it,  or  with creative  visualization.  Your  artificial elemental  is
 
           closely  linked  to  you and  your  subconscious attitudes.    It will
 
           generally not  do things  you think  it cannot do.  As in  any magick,
 
           results relate  to effort  and belief.  Another way of  looking at  an
 
           artificial elemental is  as an aspect of your personality (sub person-
 
           ality) which has been detached from you. 
 
            
 
           INVOCATION 
 
            
 
                           Formalritual usually involves the invocation (ritually
 
           calling up)  of a god  or goddess,  spirit, or other  entity. In  this
 
           sense, magick  is somewhat similar  to pagan religion  and witchcraft.
 
           However, we  consider  magick  ritual a  technique,  not  a  religion.
 
           Worship need not be involved. 
 
 
                                            1340
 
 
           Sometimes the invocation of an entity creates an artificial elemental.
 
                   Crowley says there are three different kinds of 
 
           invocation -- 
 
                   1) Devotion to the entity (as in the Bhakti yoga of 
 
           the Hare Krishna sect; the Faustian devil pact). 
 
                   2) Ceremonial invocation -- usual method of the 
 
           middle ages. 
 
                   3) Drama -- usually needs more than one person (as in 
 
           a mass).

                           Becauseof themicrocosm-macrocosmidentity,whenyouinvoke
 
           the gods, you are invoking  aspects of yourself. Jung has  referred to
 
           the gods as primitive archetypes.   This makes it sound like spiritual
 
           entities are  illusions. But in fact  the microcosm-macrocosm identity
 
           does not  discredit the  gods and goddesses.  It instead helps  to il-
 
           lustrate our relationship to the cosmos.

                           1.Balanceis importantinmagick. Varytheentities invoked
 
           in order to keep your personality in balance.
 
            
 
                           2. Oftenas nota ritualmay produce side-effects,usually
 
           something similar to, though not exactly the desired goal. If the true
 
           goal is delayed  (as sometimes happens)  we may see  the side  effects
 
           first. And if for some  reason the goal is  not achieved at all  ('mi-
 
           ssing the target')  the side effects may  be pronounced. Examples:  1)
 
           You use magick  ritual to hurry shipment of  an anticipated package in
 
           the mail. Side effect -- the next day an unexpected package (the wrong
 
           one)  arrives instead. 2)  You use  magick ritual  to cause  a certain
 
           person to phone you. Side effect -- for several 
 
           days all sorts of people phone you...The sides effects will not affect
 
           you (or anyone else) adversely unless that is what you inwardly want.

                           3.We maysaywith certaintythat"something alwayshappens"
 
           when  we perform  a magick  ritual. But  like everything  else, magick
 
           follows  the 'law of results'. This  means that results require effort
 
           of some kind.  And if you don't  work hard enough at it  you don't get
 
           results. Difficult goals have  greater resistance (magical inertia) to
 
           overcome. If the ritual doesn't produce the desired results there is a
 
           good chance that  the reason for the  failure is within oursleves.  Be
 
           certain there is  no contradiction between your model and your magical
 
           goals. Sometimes self doubt and mental 
 
           contradictions  (wanting and not wanting at  the same time) may inter-
 
           fere. The  first step in magick  is to re-program your  model. And, of
 
           course you  can help your magical  results by working on  the physical
 
           level toward  your goals. Don't expect  them to fall into  your lap by
 
           themselves.

                           4)A peculiarqualityofmagickis timedisplacement.Results
 
           of a ritual are not  usually instantaneous. There is often a  delay of
 
           12 hours or more. Difficult tasks  or weakly performed ritual are more
 
           likely to be delayed. In most cases  a slight delay is alright, and it
 
           gives us  time to get used  to the comming changes.  And sometimes the
 
           effects of a ritual 
 
           appear to extend to before the ritual was performed! 
 
 
 
                           5)Because of theway magick works,a ritualmay create an
 
           emphasis  in what  is sought,  and a  de-emphasis in  everything else.
 
           Balance  is  therefore important  here.  Once  the magical  result  is
 
           achieved it may be 'bound'  to you and difficult to get  rid of should
 
           you later decide to do so. 
 
 
 
           Example: You use a magick ritual to help you find and buy a new house.
 
           Years  later when you  decide to  sell it,  you are  unable to  do so.
 
           Consider your magical  goals wisely so  you dont  get stuck with  som-
 
           ething  you don't really  want. Note that  theory says you  can always
 
           unbind through ritual what was bound to you...theory says. 
 
 
 
                           6) Sometimesthe environmentappears to reactagainst the
 
           magick after the results are achieved. This is particularly noticeable
 
           in  using magick to  affect the weather  (and the main  reason why you
 
 
                                            1344
 
 
           should  NOT use  magick  to affect  the  weather). For  example...Your
 
           performance  of a ritual to produce a  sunny day produces a sunny day.
 
           The next day is sunny, alright, but the rest of the month is  cold and
 
           overcast. Here  the weather seems  to react to  the magick in  the op-
 
           posite  way to re-establish its natural  balance. It is something like
 
           pushing a pendulum to one side and releasing it -- the pendulum swings
 
           to the other side. To quote 
 
           Emmerson  -- "For everything you gain  you lose something...". I don't
 
           know that  this is always true  in magick, but it  does illustrate the
 
           point. And another  reason not to use magick to  affect the weather is
 
           that it might foul it up in other parts of the country (world??). 
 
 
 
                           7) Finally,magickritual(orany magickoroccultism)isvery
 
           dangerous for the  mentally unstable. If you  should somehow 'get  out
 
           too  far', eat 'heavy foods' as  previously discussed (lesson on chak-
 
           ras)  and  use  your religious  background  or old  belief  system for
 
           support. But remember too, that wierd  experiences are not necessarily
 
           bad experiences.
