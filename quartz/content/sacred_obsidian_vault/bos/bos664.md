                             Handfast Ritual 
 
 This is adapted from "Magical Rites from the Crystal Well" by Ed Fitch
 and is a combination of their handfast ritual and american indian
 ceremonial prelude. I'll skip over the consecration as it is a standard
 one and get straight to the ritual itself.  We had a Priestess only, so
 this was written with that in mind but could easily be adapted for a
 Priest and Priestess.
 
 At this time and in this place
 Do we call upon the Spirits of the Land
 As well as the Mighty Ones of the Skies.
 We call upon the Gods of our own distant past
 From lands far away.
 We call upon the Gods of our spiritual brethren
 Who once called this place
 Their own.
 Witness and rejoyce with us in this moment
 As love is affirmed.
 
 __Groom's name__ and __Bride's name__ step forward
 Stand before the Gods and those who witness on Earth
 
 __Groom's name__, if it is your wish to become one with this woman
 Will you pledge your love through all that may come
 As long as love shall last?
 
 &lt;Groom replies: I so pledge&gt;
 
 __Bride's name__, if it is your wish to become one with this man
 Will you pledge your love through all that may come As long as love
 shall last?
 
 
 &lt;Bride replies: I so pledge&gt;
 
 Does any say nay?
 
 As the Gods and the Old Ones are witness
 With those of us present now,
 I now proclaim you man and wife1
 Thus are thy hands fasted...
 The Two are now One,
 This work is done
 And joy is yet begun!
 
 
 There is also a portion for the rings using a wand that was left out of
 ours but is normally placed immediately after the vows and is as
 follows...
 
 The rings are placed upon the wand before the ritual and the wand upon
 the altar.  (This is written for bot Priest and Priestess present)
 
      The priest picks up the wand and holds one end before him in his
 right hand, the priestess likewise holds the other end in her left hand.
 
 Place your right hands
 
 Over this wand...
 And your rings...
 His hand over hers.
 
 Above you are the stars
 Below you are the stones
 As time passes, remember...
 e a star should your love burn brightly,
 Like the earth should your love be firm.
 Be free in giving of affection and of warmth.
 Have no fear, and let not the ways or words
 Of the unenlightened give you unease.
 For the Gods are with you,
 Now and always!
 
 The rings are exchanged during the vows.
