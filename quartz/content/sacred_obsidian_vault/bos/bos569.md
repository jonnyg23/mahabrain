 laws of the United States or the State of residence of the Nest or
 Chapter; 
      B.  The conduct or statements of the Nest or Chapter in its
 meetings and public functions or in its public statements, in the
 judgement of the Board of Directors, reflects unacceptable discredit on
 the Church of All Worlds, its purposes, members and Clergy; 
      C.  The Board of Directors has reason to believe -- on recommenda-
 tion from either the Council of the Third Ring or the Nest Co-ordinating
 Council -- that the chartered group is not truly functioning as a Nest
 or Chapter in that the contact person of that Nest or Chapter does not
 respond to queries, show evidence of membership or the holding of
 regular meetings or other evidence that the Chartered Nest or Chapter
 is, indeed, functioning as a viable organizational unit of the Church of
 All Worlds.   
 
      ARTICLE XII Meetings  
                Section l: 
 General meetings of the Corporation shall be held in conjunction with
 the first yearly meeting of the Board of Directors. Regular meetings of
 the Board of Directors shall be held quarterly, approximately three
 weeks before cross-quarter Sabbats. The first annual meeting shall
 propose the meeting dates for the remaining quarters of the year.
 Special meetings may be held whenever deemed necessary. 
                Section 2: 
 Notice of the Annual Meetings of the General Membership shall be made
 each year at least one month in advance of the date of the meeting by a
 special mailing to all registered members of the Church of at least 2nd
 Circle. Notices of regular meetings of the Board of Directors, together
 2509
 
 with quarterly subsidiary reports and proposed agenda items, shall be
 sent to members of the Board  two weeks prior to such meetings by the
 Church Secretary. Notice of special Board meetings shall be made as
 early as possible. Notice of regular meetings of other councils shall be
 sent to relevant members two weeks in advance by the appropriate council
 secretary, and notices of special meetings, as early as possible. 
 Meetings of Nest Councils shall be held at least quarterly, the
 frequency and dates to be determined by said councils. 
                Section 3:  
 The privelege of decision-making at any meeting shall be limited to
 those present who are actual active members both of the Church and of
 the particular Council or Ring convening the meeting.  If the number
 present is thirteen or less than thirteen, all decisions must be made by
 consensus, and if consensus cannot be reached, by a twothirds majority.
 If the number present is greater than thirteen, all decisions must be by
 a two-thirds majority vote. In meetings where more than thirteen voting
 members are present, the number of votes carried by each member shall be
 equal to the ring (1,2, or 3) that member has attained. Section 4: A
 quorum to conduct business shall consist of a number of voting members
 equal to two-thirds majority plus one of the members of that particular
 council. 
                Section 5: The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be from
 January l to December 31, inclusive.  
 
      ARTICLE XIII Subsidiary Operations  
                Section 1: 
 The Corporation, acting through the Board of Directors or their
 delegated authority, may organize, charter, establish, and operate such
 subsidiary operations, agencies, groups, and institutions as may be
 found necessary or expedient adequately to carry out the purposes of the
 Corporation. 
                Section 2: 
 Each subsidiary shall send a representative to serve on the Board of
 Directors. The subsidiary representatives shall be responsible for
 reporting the activities of the Subsidiary to the Board, and for
 relaying information from the Board to each subsidiary. In addition, the
 subsidiary representatives shall submit reports to the Secretary and the
 Treasurer detailing the activities of each subsidiary.
               Section 3: 
 Chartering and serving as Directors of subsidiary organizations is open
 only to active members of the Church with Scion or Clergy status.  Under
 exceptional circumstances, and by special dispensation of the Board of
 Directors, a project or provisional subsidiary may be approved for
 inception by a Church member of only 3rd Circle status, conditional upon
 that person's attainment of 4th Circle within a year from the date of
 approval, or the appointment within that time as a Director of the
 aforesaid subsidiary of another active Churcdh member of at least 4th
 Circle. Subsidiaries should begin as projects or provisional sub-
 sidiaries and be considered for full subsidiary status if they have been
 active for two years and two days. Provisional subsidiaries should send
 a contact person to the Board of Directors' meetings. 
                Section 4:  
 The governance of subsidiaries shall be by Directors and Councils, the
 combined total number of which must always be an odd number, from one to
 seven, of whom one to three shall be designated Directors.  Should the
 subsidiary be authorized to open a bank or checking account, there shall
 be three approved signatories on the account, at least one of which must
 be a Scion or Clergy.  Directors of subsidiaries must be Scions or 
 2510
 
 Clergy, but other members of the subsidiary councils may be any active
 members of the Church that the subsidiary Directors wish to delegate. 
                Section 5:  
 Decision-making in subsidiary councils should follow the procedures
 outlined in Article XI, Section 3 above. 
 
      ARTICLE IV Amendments  
                Section 1: 
 Amendments or changes in these Bylaws may be made by recommendation of
 the Board of Directors at the Annual meeting, by unanimous vote or
 consensus of voting members present.
