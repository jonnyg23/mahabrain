           CompuServe on-line Imbolc Ritual, 1990
            
           (Ladyhawk) 
           This is Imbolc...or Candlemas...or Brigit's day 
           This is the feast of the waxing light. 
           What was born at the Winter Solstice begins to manifest 
           The Lady, midwife to the infant year, 
           now sees the Child Sun grow strong 
           as the days grow visibly longer. 
           It is a time of beginnings, 
           when we select the seed we will later plant, 
           nurture, and eventually harvest. 
            
           After I do each invocation, I will pause and let each of you say
           a FEW words no more than 2 lines, please...to your particular
           deity 
            
           Right now, I'd like everyone to ground and center themselves... 
           in the way that is best for you. 
           As you do, see yourself bathed in a white light, cleansing you
           and your area. 
            
           Now, mentally turn to the East: 
           Powers of the East 
           We bid you come 
           To witness our rite 
           And protect us! 
            
           Now mentally turn to the South: 
           Powers of the South 
           We bid you come 
           To witness our rite 
           And protect us! 
            
           &lt;Now mentally turn to the West:&gt; 
           Powers of the West 
           We bid you come 
           To witness our rite 
           And protect us! 
            
           &lt;Now mentally turn to the North:&gt; 
           Powers of the North 
           We bid you come 
           To witness our rite 
           And protect us! 
            
           &lt;Back once more to the East and in your own way, salute the East
           again&gt; 
            
           Now, let us all link together 
           Feel the earth energy welling up from the bowels of the Earth,
           our Mother 
           Feel it rise to our feet and up through our bodies 
           White light energy 
           Feel it flow through us and link us, 
 
 
 
                                                                             2097
 
           one with the other 
           So finally we feel and see the circle of energy, 
           the circle of power 
           binding us together and setting us apart 
           In a space not of this time, but of all times 
           Not of these places, but all places! 
           Blessed Be! 
            
           Sun King! 
           Horned One of animals and wild places 
           Joyously we ask you come! 
           All the land is wrapped in the chill of winter 
           The trees are bare and 
           the air is cold. 
           Yet still our hearts are glad 
           For we know you have been reborn 
           And nurtured in your early days 
           By the gracious Mother Goddess, 
           Lady of all fertility. 
           We bid you welcome 
           And rejoice in your growing strength! 
           Hail Great God! 
           Hail and Welcome!     &lt;ga&gt; 
            
           (Jehana) Hail &amp; Welcome! 
            
           (Ocean Mist) u!/u 
            
           (Shadow Hawk) Hail Mother, from you the Sun once more does grow!
 
            
           (Gwynndon) Hail and Welcome! 
            
           (Shadowstar) Welcome, Lord of the Sun! 
            
           (Jehana) Brigid, Arianhrod, Cerridwyn, Herne... Welcome! 
            
           (Larne) Welcome Lord!  Share with us your warmth and light! 
            
           (Ocean Mist) Hail and welcome in your new light! 
            
           (Ladyhawk) 
           Great Goddess, Noble Lady! 
           Known to the Celts as Brigit, Bride, Cerridwen, and more 
           Goddess of Light 
           Keeper of the sacred wells! 
           We gather tonite to honor your 
           who has nurtured the Sun King. 
           As the spring lambs are born 
           and the ewes come to milk, 
           as we sense spring itself 
           so close 
           We bid you welcome as we 
           Clear out the old and make way for the new 
           Welcome Lady 
 
 
 
                                                                             2098
 
           Welcome and all Hail! 
            
           (Gwynndon) Bride is come! Bride is Welcome! 
            
           (Jehana) Welcome, bright lady, spark of inspiration! 
            
           (Rita) Welcome, Great Mother.  Welcome and grow strong, Young
           Lord. 
            
           (Shadowstar) Welcome, Lady of Light! 
            
           (Larne) Welcome Lady!  Nurture and help us as we grow! 
            
           (Shadow Hawk) Mother smile upon us and bring us Life, Son shine
           down upon us and bring us Light! 
            
            
           (Ocean Mist) Welcome goddess of light! 
            
           (Ladyhawk) 
           Now, let us each concentrate on that which we need to "sweep out"
           of our lives 
           Picture it as, with a new, clean broom, 
           you sweep it away 
           and it vanishes in the air. 
            
           And now, with ourselves cleansed, 
           let us meditate on that we might wish 
           to plant for this year... 
           the "seed" we will plant in the spring. 
           For, this is the time of chosing the seed 
           and preparing for the planting. 
           Gracious Lady! Help us chose wisely the seed! 
            
           and now, with our seed selected and held dearly in our hearts, 
           it is time to thank the Lady and the Lord. 
           O Sun King, Horned One! 
           We thank thee for thy presence 
           Surely we feel your growing strength 
           In our heart of hearts 
           and find joy in knowing 
           that as the sun grows, 
           so do you! 
           We thank thee for teaching us that 
           even in the depths of winter 
           Life grows! 
           Farewell, Lord, if you must go. 
           Though, gladly would we have you stay and 
           rejoice with us. 
           Hail, Sun King! 
            
           Gracious Lady, 
           We thank thee for thy guidance 
           in selecting our seed. 
           Truly will we hold it in our hearts 
 
 
 
                                                                             2099
 
           Till the time of planting. 
           We thank thee also 
           For teaching us the wisdom 
           of cleansing and letting go 
           of that which is no longer useful to us. 
           Thus do we heal of past hurts 
           and grow in strength, even as does our Lord. 
           We thank thee 
           and bid you farewell if you must go, 
           but gladly would we have you stay 
           and rejoice with us! 
           Hail, Gracious Lady! 
            
           And now, we will let our circle sink back into the Earth once
           again. 
           For all that comes of the Earth, must surely return to Her. 
           But even as the circle departs, 
           know that we are still bound 
           By our love of the Gods 
           and the Love between us. 
           Blessed Be! 
            
           (Shadow Hawk) Blessed Be 
            
           (Rita) Blessed Be! 
            
           (Ocean Mist) Blessed Be! 
            
           (Shadowstar) Blessed Be! 
            
           (Larne) Farewell Lord and Lady.  Depart our circle, but be always
           with us.  
                   Blessed Be! 
            
           (Jehana) Blessed Be!  So Mote it Be! 
            
           (Gwynndon) Blessed Be! 
            
           (Vkai) Blessed Be! 
            
           (Ladyhawk) 
           &lt;Now turn in your mind's eye once again to the East&gt; 
           Farewell, Powers of the East 
           We thank you for 
           Your attendence 
           and protection 
           Peace ever between thee and we! 
            
           &lt;Face South&gt; 
           Farewell Powers of the South 
           We thank you for your attendence 
           and protection 
           Peace ever between thee and we!

                                                                             2100

           &lt;once more face East and mentally salute once again&gt; 
            
           The circle is open, but unbroken 
           Merry meet and merry part 
           and merry meet again! 
            
           (Shadow Hawk) Merry Meet and Merry Part, and Merry Meet Again! 
            
           (Ladyhawk) &lt;The Rite is ended&gt;

           (Jehana) (Passing drink) 
            
           (Larne) I'll have some of those cakes! 
 
 
 
                                                                             2101
