           (Jehana)  Sit calmly, breath with relaxation..

                Feel it expand...   Feel it connect with your friends and
                companions within Circle...
                Feel it Circle around you; around all of us...

                We invite you to our Circle

           (Jehana) Invoke into your heart and into this our Circle
                The bright Lady of New Beginnings.  
                The Maiden who sings the joys of Spring to come
                The Mother who brings nurturance, love and guidance.
                Hail, bright Lady; we welcome thee!!!
                Invoke into your heard and into this our Circle
                The Oak King
                Growing as a sapling
                Growing strong.
                A child at heart, learning, searching, in true Discovery.
                Hail, bright Lord; we welcome thee!!
                According to Sun Bear, this Moon is the Moon of Rest and
                Cleansing, following upon the Moon of Earth Renewal. The
                animal is the Otter, and the plant, the Quaking Aspen. 
                Its  mineral is silver.  
                In the Celtic tree calendar, as reported by Graves, this
                full Moon falls in the month of Luis, signified by the Rowan
                tree, and by the Tourmaline.  Its attribute is Quickening.  
                Those who follow astrology know this is the month of
                Aquarius, the Water Bearer; the fixed sign of Air. 
                According to Z Budapest, the Full Moon aspect of February is
                the red and cleansing wild Moon.  Life quickens now.  It is
 
 
 
                                                                             2130
 
                a time of purification, of growth, of the stimulation of all
                living things.  
                It is a healing time.  It brings in the wind of the New. 
                Its flower:  the primose and the violet.  Its animal: the
                duck and the otter.  Its stone:  the amethyst.  
                It is appropriate at this time to do workings; workings for 
                things we may wish to see in our lives, and in the world in 
                general.  It is a time for healing.  It is a time for
                growth.   
                I ask each of you to think of those things you wish to work
                on,-- you may speak or keep them silent, as you will...
                Speak first of new beginnings and things of growth for the
                world at large.  Then, speak of those new beginnings and
                things of growth and healing for people or events closer to
                home.  And, yes, speak of those beginnings and things of
                growth for you yourself.  After we finish mentioning all of
                our workings, we will repeat a phrase -- visualize the
                energy, through the hand of the Goddess, flowing into the
                things we seek, imbuing them with constructive energy. 
                (Please note that most Witches consider it unethical to work
                healings or other magic for specific people without first
                asking their permission).  
                (When I start doing the chant (which begins with "We all
                come from the Goddess"), others may copy me, or jump ahead
                if they are familiar with it...
                I will tell you when to visualize the energy peaking.)
                -- mention things in your mind or in print that you wish to
                allow to grow/heal:
           (Rilla) I wish for a healing ...
                of the youth of this country...
                that they may find the peace that they need...
                to learn to live in harmony...
                and to be the "future" of this world...
                and for myself the patience...
                to wait for direction...
                in my life path...
                and a healthy mind and body..
                for the coming year.
           (Jehana) I wish for the earth's healing...
                the pain in the environment to be turned around...
                an understanding of the nature of this planet upon which we
                live.
                I wish to know and be known by love and compassion.
           (Ardelia) I wish for this world.....
                the ability to be calm...
                as we learn to work with each other.....
                the earth.....
                and ourselves.
           (Jehana) We all come from the Goddess
                And to her we shall return
                Like a drop of rain
                Flowing to the ocean.
           (Rilla) We all come from the Goddess..
                and to her we shall return...
                Like a drop of rain...
 
 
 
                                                                             2131
 
                Flowing to the ocean.
           (Jehana) We all come from the Goddess
                And to her we shall return
                Like a drop of rain
                Flowing to the ocean.
           (Rilla) We all come from the Goddess...
                and the her we shall return...
                Like a drop of rain...
                Flowing to the ocean.
           (Jehana) Feel the energy; rising up; rising up; rising up!
                Drink in the energy...
                Take your glass of water, know that it is energized, 
                and drink!
                Take a quiet moment to pause and reflect.
                Oak King, Sapling growing strong...
                Playful lord, in the growing time of your cycle...
                Thank you for your presence here...
                Hail, and Farewell!
                Bright Maiden, singing your songs of Spring nearly afoot...
                Gracious Mother, You of love and nurturance and guidance..
                We thank you for your presence here..
                We thank you for your blessings...
                Hail, and Farewell!!
                Powers of Air!
                We thank you for your fresh breath!
                Hail, and Farewell!
           (Rilla) Powers of Fire!
                We thank you for you strength!
                Hail and Farewell!
           (Jehana) Powers of Water!
                We thank you for your healing compassion!
                Hail, and farewell!
           (Rilla) Powers of the Earth!
                We thank you for your sustenance and nurturance!
                Hail and farewell!
           (Jehana) The blue-white glow that surronds us all...
                begins to retract...
                slowly, slowly...
                Fire seal the Circle round
                Let it fade beneath the ground
                Let all things be as they were
                Since the beginning of time.
                Merry Meet, Merry Part, and Merry Meet Again!
           (Rilla) Blessed Be!
           (Jehana) (The Ritual has concluded; Bright Blessings; Blessed
                Be!)
 
 
 
                                                                             2132
