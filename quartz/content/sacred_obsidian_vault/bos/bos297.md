                                    --- A WICCANING  --- 
                                    Date: 08-31-92  18:25
                                    By: Ceridwen Goddess
 
            
             (please bear  in mind that since  non-Wiccans  were present  at this
           ceremony,  some things  WERE  toned down...we  did   not  perform  the
           Five-fold Kiss, or  a more emphatic  version of the Great  Rite... our
           horned statue of Pan  was left at home  in favor of a  small, antlered
           god-figure  from an  American Indian  motif.. we  did not  include the
           scourge  on  the alter,  or the  Cords (I  chose  instead to  wear our
           blue-colored Cord  around my waist, however),  and **most** references
           to the Horned  God were  altered to reflect  a less-imposing  Antlered
           One...  I do  hope that  those who  may read  this will  understand my
           reasoning for these actions.   
            
            
           Lammas 1992  
            
           I thought that i would share with you the ritual that  we performed in
           blessing our  children this  past Lammas  (we did  it  on July  30th),
           Blessings to you all! 
           -Heidi 
            
           A WICCANING: 
            
           --consecrate the salt and water 
 
           (Priestess takes her athame, plunges the blade into the container of 
           salt, "So that you may be fit to dwell in this Sacred Space, I bless 
           this salt, in the names of our Lord and Lad, i bless this salt" then 
           transfering three 'knife-fuls' to the container of [in this case 
           water taken from the beach where we held the ritual] water "So that  
           you may be fit to dwell in this Sacred Space, I consecrate and bless 
           this water" and stir the salt into the water.) 
 
           --purify work space with [salt-]water 
           (Priestess walks the diameter of the Circle and casts the [salt-]water
           along its perimeter) 
 
           --purify work space with incense and candle... 
           (Priest  traverses  the perimeter  of the  Circle with  frankincense &amp;
           myrrh and then a candle) 
            
           Priest hands athame to Priestess who casts the Sacred Circle: 
            
           "With earth and air draw forth all that is fair 
           by fire and sea of ill stay free 
           O Circle, be thou a meeting-place of love and joy and truth 
           a shield against all wickedness and evil 
           a rampart of protection that shall preserve 
           the powers that we may raise within Thee. 
           Wherefore do i bless and consecrate thee. 
            
           Priestess welcomes all gathered into the Circle space: 
               "May your mind be free, may  your heart be free, may your  body be
           free." 
            
 
 
                                            1493
           
 
           Invoking the Watchtowers: 
            
           The Priestess takes the bowl of water to the East and says: 
            
           O cool lakes and deep seas of the East 
           waters soft and giving of fresh life 
           join with us -- 
           Cast your blessings upon these children 
           and become a friend to them! 
           Blessed Be. 
            
            
           All echo, "Blessed Be!" 
           (the water is placed at the east gate) 
            
           The Priestess takes a candle to the South and says: 
            
           O warm sun and warm skies of the South 
           bringing life anew, the growth of all things, 
           and promise of the future, 
           join us -- 
           Cast your blessings upon these children 
           and become a friend to them! 
           Blessed Be!
 
            
           All echo, "Blessed Be!" 
           (the candle is placed at the south gate) 
            
           The Priestess takes the censor/sage to the West and says: 
            
           O Winds of the East 
           who bring forth freshness, life, and joy... 
           join us -- 
           Cast your blessings upon these children 
           and and become a friend to them! 
           Blessed Be! 
            
            
           All echo, "Blessed Be!" 
           (the censor is placed at the west gate) 
            
           The Priestess takes the bowl of earth to the North and says: 
            
           O mighty mountains and endless steppes of the North 
           Meadows of green and the creatures that therein dwell 
           join us -- 
           cast your blessings upon these children 
           and become a friend to them. 
            
            
           All echo, "Blessed Be!" 
           (the bowl is set at the north gate) 
            
 
 
                                            1494
           
 
            
           The Priestess holds the alter Wand aloft and asks: 
           "Repeat after me.... 
           As above so below 
           as the Universe, so the soul 
           as without so within. 
           Blessed and Gracious Ones -- on this night 
           do we consecrate to you 
           our minds, our bodies, and our spirits. Blessed Be!" 
            
            
           INVOKING THE GODDESS AND GOD 
            
           goddess: 
            
            
           All-dewy Sky-sailing Pregnant Moon 
           who shines for all 
           who flows through all 
           light of the world which is yourself 
           maiden mother crone 
           the weaver the green one 
            
           O most gracious and magnificent Lady 
           We ask that some portion of your presence 
           be here among us now 
           Give protection and shelter to the small 
           and sacred ones 
           who are here to be dedicated in Your honor. 
            
            
           god; 
            
           Seed sower, grain reborn 
           Antered One come! 
           Bright sun, Dark death, 
           Lord of winds, lord of the dance 
           sun-child, winter born king 
           Hanged one 
           Untamed, untamed! 
           Stag and stallion, goat and bull, 
           sailor of the last sea, guardian of the gate 
           lord of the two lands 
           ever-dying, ever-living, radiance
 
           O ancient lord of the universe 
           we ask some portion of your presence here 
           among us now. 
           Shield and strengthen the children who shall be 
           dedicated in your honor! 
            
            
 
 
                                            1495
           
 
            
           THE BLESSINGS and PURIFICATIONS 
            
           Maiden (in this case an unattached and close aunt of the children): 
           (as she sprinkles the children with barley) 
            
           "Dearest ones, may you never know hunger or poverty for 
           material or spiritual things. I bless you with the barley 
           of the Spirits, for nourishment and wealth." 
            
           Mother (the Priestess who is the mother of the children): 
           (as she sprinkles the children with water) 
            
           "I bless you in the name of the Spirits of all life and 
           healing, with the waters of the Earth, that you may be 
           healthy and strong in body, mind, and spirit. Let love  
           be your treasure, may you be happy in your heart." 
            
           Crone (the Priestess's mother and the grandmother of the children): 
           (as she sprinkles the children with salt) 
            
           "Dearest ones, may you have access to your own wisdom 
           and that of others. May you be protected from foolishness 
           and self-destruction. May you know the essence of things; 
           may you be bright and find it easy to learn and teach." 
            
           The Antlered One (the Priest, who is the father of the children): 
           (fire/sage incense) 
             
           "With the Fire of the Universe to spark your temper, 
           I would ask that you may find joy and a sense of merriment 
           in all that you accomplish - to see the lighter side 
           of life's journey and find happiness in your work." 
            
            
           THE DIVULGENCE OF THE NAMES (explained to the Witnesses): 
            
           ANCIENT EUROPEAN PEOPLES BELIEVED THAT YOU MUST HAVE TWO 
           NAMES, ONE PUBLIC AND ONE A SECRET NAME THAT ONLY THOSE 
           PRESENT AT THE BLESSING CEREMONY KNEW. THIS SECOND NAME 
           IS FOR USE AFTER PUBERTY, WHEN THE SOUL CHANGES INTO ITS  
           FIRST ADULT SELF, WHEN IT CAN BE UTTERED ONCE MORE, AND 
           MADE PUBLIC. THE PURPOSE OF THE FIRST PUBLIC NAME WAS TO 
           DIVERT THE EVIL EYE, TO GAIN FAVOR WITH THE FATES, TO  
           KEEP AWAY SICKNESS, AND TO HELP THE CHILD REACH ADULTHOOD. 
            
           Priestess: 
           "Great Spirit of Nature, protect and guide these young souls 
           among us. 
           May the Blessings of the wise and joyous Father of the Gods 
           far-seeing and far-knowing be upon thee. 
           May the blessings of the Triple Goddess, 
           of Maiden, of Mother, of Crone, and all their power 
           be upon thee." 
            
            
           The following blessings/invocations were spoken and followed by 
           the child being immersed in the ocean water of the beach where 
           the ritual was held: 
            
 
 
                                            1496
           
 
           ELIZABETH'S DUNKING: 
            
           Anna Perenna 
           Great Goddess, Mother of All 
           Envelope this daughter of yours 
           in the waters of Your womb 
           Grant her protection from wrong-doing 
           Wash away the memories of her pain 
           Shower her with Your blessings 
           in a life everlasting 
           Bless Elizabeth Mae Luzerne. 
           So Mote it Be! 
            
            
           PATRICK'S DUNKING: 
            
           Great Goddess, Nurturer and Bearer of all Men, great and small 
           Without whose womb they would not be 
           Mother of Gods, of Sacrificial Kings, 
           Presidents, Emperors, and beggars 
           Welcome this son of Yours into Your Light 
           and as you have taught us, let him find 
           "Beauty and strength, power and compassion, 
           mirth and reverence, honor and humility" 
           within his heart.  
           Wash his fears away with your caress! 
           Bless Patrick Howard Lloyd! 
           Blessed Be! 
            
            
           MORGAINNE'S DUNKING: 
            
           Hail, o gracious and most magnificent Lady 
           whose slender hand turns the vast wheel of the sky. 
           whose triple aspect does see 
           the beginning, the life, and the end of all things. 
           whose wells of mystery do give 
           inspiration and rebirth thoughout eternity, 
           receive here this small daughter of yours with blessings 
           and with love. 
           Bless Morgainne Ellayne! 
           So mote it be! 
            
            
           (explained to the Witnesses:) 
           THE SECOND NAMES CHOSEN WERE DECIDED UPON FOR BOTH WHIMSICAL 
           AND SERIOUS REASONS -- FOR PERSONALITY AND FOR CIRCUMSTANCE. 
            
           "For this newest arrival, a small girl-child who came as 
           an unplanned gift from the gods, whose arrival has 
           challenged us and helped us grow, as did her namesake, 
           bringing all of Mankind's challenges upon him, she is 
           called PANDORA." 
            
           "For a small boy-child who seems to live for good food and drink, 
           who enjoys this life he's been blessed with, and who reminds us 
           that merriment is part of our everyday challenge as well as 
           paying the bills and doing the housework, so we found inspiration 
           in the spirited and fun-loving god of wine, and give his name 
           to our son, who will be BACCHUS." 
 
 
                                            1497
           
 
            
            
           (our oldest, 4 year old daughter was severely burned when she was 
           16 months old, thus the inspiration for her naming...) 
            
           "And at last, for our eldest daughter, as did the beautiful bird rise 
           miraculously from its burning, so did she -- and aptly she is 
           named PHOENIX." 
            
            
           Priestess: 
           "O Lady of the Starry Heavens, Wise All-Father, behold these 
           lovely children, PANDORA, BACCHUS, and PHOENIX 
           conceived and brought forth in love. 
           Bless and protect them and grant the gifts of wisdom, 
           inspiration, and wonder, adorn them with your enduring 
           and eternal strength and steadfastness. May they ever 
           have spirits that seek the stars, and roots that hold 
           tight deep within thy loving breast." 
            
            
            
           SHARING OF THE BREAD AND WINE: 
            
           Priestess blesses the wine, dipping the athame into the chalice: 
           "As the cup is to the female so the athame is to the male, 
           and conjoined they bring blessed creation" 
            
            
           "Offering to the Mother: 
           Hail Earth, Mother of All! 
           May your fileds increase and flourish. 
           Your forests grow and spread, 
           And your waters run pure and free! 
           Accept my offering, O Earth Mother! 
           Bring forth that which is good, and sustaining, 
           For every living thing!" 
            
            
           --The Bread: 
           As the bread is passed around, the Priestess asks for its 
           glorification: 
            
           "Let us join hands and purify ourselves 
           breathing in the life force of the universe 
           and expelling all evil from us. 
           Take now of the bread 
           and know of the grain of which you partake 
           as the latest of countless generations 
           growing to fruitfulness 
           and in dying, giving of the seeds 
           from which new life shall spring 
           Know that every seed, every grain is 
           the record of times most ancient 
           and a promise of all that shall be. 
           Partake of the bread 
           and know of life eternal and of Immortality. 
           With this knowledge are our souls sustained."

           --The Wine: 
            
           As the Chalice of wine is shared around the Circle, the 
           Priestess asks for it's glorification, also: 
            
           Drink now of the wine 
           And know of the tranformation 
           of simple fruits to sparkling elixir 
           as this wine has undergone change 
           so by life's cauldron shall we 
           As this wine gives the enchantment of the Divine 
           or abasement into the lower realms, 
           so do all humans rise or fall in each life 
           As their own will and strength determines. 
            
            
           --The Storytelling: 
           at this point the group of celebrants and the witnesses were asked 
           to seat themselves and the Priestess read a story called "The Burning 
           of the Lady's People" chosen from a collection of Goddess tales, 
           THE STORYTELLER'S GODDESS by Carolyn McVickar Edwards. 
            
            
            
            
           --OPENING THE CIRCLE: 
            
           All join hands, Priestess says: 
           "Lords of the Winds, the Fires, the Seas, and the Fields, before you 
           depart to your fair and lovely realms, we thank you for your presence 
           this evening! Blessed be! ... 
            
           May the Circle be open but not broken 
           may the Beauty of the Goddess and the Strength of the God 
           dwell in our hearts. Merry meet, and merry part, and merry 
           meet again. Blessed Be!" 
            
           END 
            
            
           The  Priestess of  EarthWorld Circle  wishes to  acknowledge the  many
           sources from which these invocations and blessings and ritual writings
           were chosen including MAGICAL RITES FROM THE CRYSTAL WELL by Ed Fitch,
           and several of the various books by Stewart and Janet Farrar, Doreen  
           Valiente, Starhawke's THE SPIRAL DANCE, A WICCAN BARDO by Paul Beyerl,
           and probably  others that i've  forgotten their original  sources over
           the years of use.
