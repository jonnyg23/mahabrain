                send my Will, starting in the North I cast a line of Fire
                around the country, moving Eastward, then South, Then West,
                and Back to the  North.  We are encompassed in a circle of
                Fire that protects our Sacred Space.

                Lady.  Be Here Now!
                  
           (1-4,Shadow Hawk)  The Circle is cast, we are in the space
                between the worlds, where Time and Space cease to exist. 
                Let none disturb the boundaries without dire cause.
            
           (1-4,Shadow Hawk)  Now we turn out thoughts to the Divine
                Consort, the Horned God.

                we are here...
                Hail to Our Lady, in whose eyes the stars do shine forth and
                upon whose brow the Moon doth ride.  Lady, your children
                call to you from within your Sacred Space.  We bid you come
                and let us Feel your touch.  You who will deny your children
                naught.  We are at your feet in Wonder and Awe.  Welcome to
                this your Circle.
 
 
 
                                                                             2133
 
            
           (1-4,Cernunnos) We are in the Place between the Worlds, Beyond
                Time and Space, and in the presence of the Goddesses and
                Gods.  Let none leave this space without grave cause.
            
           (1-4,Cernunnos) Welcome the Divine Lady, Gracious Goddess and
                Mother of us all.
                I call upon thee, Mighty Mother of us all, bringer of all
                fruitfulness; by seed and root, by stem and bud, by leaf and
                flower and fruit, by life and love do I invoke thee to
                descend upon the body of this thy Circle and thy
                Priestesses.
            
           (1-4,Cernunnos)   Hail Aradia!  From the Almathean horn Pour
                forth thy store of love; I lowly bend before thee, I adore
                thee to the end, with loving sacrifice thy shrine adorn. 
                Thy foot is to my lip, my prayer upborne upon the rising
                incense smoke; then spend thine ancient love, O Mighty One,
                descend to Aid me, who without thee am forlorn.
            
           (1-4,Cernunnos)   Thou art the Mother Darksome and Divine, Yours
                the scourge and yours the Kiss, the Five-point star of love
                and bliss, bless us with your sign.
            
           (1-4,Cernunnos) Listen to the words of the Great Mother, she whom
                of old was also called among men Artemis, Astarte, Athena,
                Dione, Melusine, Aphrodite, Cerridwen, Dana, Arianrhod,
                Isis, Brid, and by many other names.
            
           (1-4,Cernunnos)  "Whenever you have need of any thing, once in
                the month, and better it be when the Moon is full, then
                shall ye assemble in some secret place and adore the spirit
                of Her, who is Queen of all witches.
                There shall ye assemble, ye who are fain to learn all
                sorcery, yet have not won its deepest secrets, to these will
                She teach things that are yet unknown.  And ye shall be free
                from slavery, and as a sign that ye be really free, ye shall
                be naked in your rites, and ye shall dance, sing, feast,
                make music and love, all in Her praise.  For Hers is the
                secret door that opens upon the Land of Youth, and Hers is
                the cup of the wine of life, and the Cauldron of Cerridwen,
                which is the Holy Grail of Immortality.  She is the Gracious
                Goddess, who gives the gift of Joy unto the hearts of Man. 
                Upon Earth, She gives knowledge of the spirit eternal, and
                beyond death, She gives peace, and freedom, and reunion with
                those who have gone before.  Nor does She demand sacrifice,
                for behold, She is the Mother of all living, and her Love is
                poured out upon the Earth."
            
           (1-4,Cernunnos)  Hear ye the words of the Star Goddess, she in
           the dust of whose feet are the hosts of Heaven, and whose body
           encircles the Universe.
            
           (1-4,Cernunnos)  "She who is the beauty of the green Earth, and
                the white Moon among the stars, and the mystery of the
 
 
 
                                                                             2134
 
                waters, and the desire of the hearts of man, calls unto thy
                soul.  Arise, and come unto Her.
                For She is the soul of Nature, who gives life to the
                universe.  From Her all things proceed, and unto Her all
                things must return, and before Her face, beloved of Gods and
                of men, let thine innermost divine self be enfolded in the
                rapture of the infinite.  Let Her worship be within the
                heart that rejoiceth, for behold, all acts of love and
                pleasure are Her rituals.  And therefore let there be beauty
                and strength, power and compassion, honor and humility,
                mirth and reverence within you.  And thou who thinkest to
                seek for Her, know thy seeking and yearning shall avail thee
                not, unless thou knowest the mystery, that if what thou
                seekest thou findest not within thee, then thou shalt never
                find it without thee.  For behold, She has been with thee
                from the beginning, and She is that which is attained at the
                end of desire."
                Absorb Her Blessings and her words.  Feel them resonate in
                your core.
 
           (1-4,S.H.)   If there are any here that have a petition to bring
                before the Lady, please do so now.
                If there are any objects to be charged, please bring them
                forth now.
            
           &lt;At this point, petitions and objects were presented to the Lady
           and the Circle for blessings--this section is deleted due to
           mention of names of non-participants&gt;
            
           (1-3,S.H.) Now is the time for the Great Rite.  Please take your
                knife in one hand...and your chalice in the other.
                Place the tip of the knife in the chalice and say,
                  "As the chalice is to the Woman
                  So the Athame is to the Man
                  And when the two become one,
                  The greatest magic is begun!"
                Now dip your atheme into the chalice to energize the
                lifeforce within it.
                Blessed Be, So mote it be!
            
           (1-3,S.H.) Now, take the Atheme (knife) over the bread/cake..
            
           (1-3,S.H.) Lady, we come before you with love in our heart and
                awe in our eyes, asking you to give us your blessings and
                pour your blessings on the fruit of the vine and the field,
                that we may be filled with your blessings.
                So mote it be, Blessed be!
            
           (1-3,S.H.) Draw a pentagram on the bread with the knife.
                Now, eat of the bread and drink of the wine, saving some
                portion for offering to the creatures of the Lady later.
            
           (1-3,S.H.) Now it's time to bid farewell to the Lady and the
                Lord.
            
 
 
 
                                                                             2135
 
           (1-3,S.H.) Hail Mother of us all, we thank you for attending this
                our Rite, and for your blessings and love that you have
                poured forth upon us your children.  Blessed be thy Name.
            
           (1-3.S.H.) Hail Lord of the Dance, we thank you for attending
                this our Rite, and for your presence and love that you have
                poured forth upon us your children.  Blessed be thy Name.
            
           (1-3,S.H.) Now we turn our attention to the South
                Hail Lord of the South, Lord of Fire, we thank you for your
                presence and the Light and warmth that you shed upon us. 
                Farewell and Blessed Be.
            
           (1-3,S.H.) Now we turn our attention to the East....
                Hail Lord of the East, Lord of Air, we thank you for your
                presence and the Air that you bring to us that life may be
                sustained.  Farewell and Blessed Be.
            
           (1-3,S.H.) Now we turn our attention to the North....
                Hail Lord of the North, Lord of Earth, we thank you for your
                presence and the harvest from your fields that feed and
                shelter us.  Farewell and Blessed Be.
            
           (1-3,S.H.) Now we turn our attention to the West....
                Hail Lord of the West, Lord of Water, we thank you for your
                presence and the blood of your body to slake our thirst and
                the thirst of the fields.  Farewell and Blessed Be.
            
           (1-3,S.H.) Now I send my Will to the North, and I walk the
                circle...
                Circle of Fire, I quench your thirst...
                Down down into the ground...
                Nevermore to be found...
                Spread your life throughout the land...
                That all may feel your blessing.
                So Mote it Be!
                Blessed Be!
                The Circle is Open, Merry Meet, Merry Part, and Merry Meet
                again!
            
           (1-3,S.H.) Blessed Be all!
 
 
 
                                                                             2136
