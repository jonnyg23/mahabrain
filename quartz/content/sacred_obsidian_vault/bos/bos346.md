                                          IMBOLG 1992
                                                JULIA PHILLIPS
 
 
             Temple in darkness, apart from the Yule log in the centre. Brigid in her bed on the
 
             small altar. Lots of unlit candles in sand pots around the room. All enter as usual,
 
             and the Circle is cast in the normal manner. After the central invocations, HP says:
 
 
 
             Awake O Earth from your slumbers! Awake O Sun and restore the Earth! Mother - we are
 
             in darkness.
 
 
 
             HPS picks up a jug of water, and pours it into the cauldron saying:
 
 
 
             The waters are broken. The ice melting towards Candletime. Blood has been along the
 
             track, but now the ways are clear of death. Old and grey I was, but here in the
 
             mystery of the waters I am renewed. For I am the one you sought, but could not find.
 
             For I was singing to my child unseen, beneath the hills of birch and rowan.
 
 
 
             HPS takes the asperge, and all circle around her chanting the Witches Rune. She
 
             asperges each person as they pass, and on the last round, hands each person a white
 
             candle. When everyone has a candle, the circling stops, and HPS lights the main
 
             candles and says:
 
 
 
             The darkness of winter is passing: the Earth awakens once more from its slumbers;
 
             the Virgin walks among us again, and brings Her blessings upon the land and upon our
 
             lives.
 
 
 
             Priest and Priestess step forward and remove the cover from Brigid's bed, revealing
 
             the Virgin. Everyone shouts:
 
 
 
             Brigid is Come! Brigid is Welcome!
 
 
                                                                                            1758
           
 
           HPS takes a light from the Yule log and says:
 
 
 
             Let the inner light bear fruit in our own lives, even as the Earth bears the first
 
             flowers.
 
 
 
             I am Brigid: She of the Golden Hair; Queen of the White Hills, and rider of the
 
             White Swan. I bring three gifts of fire. The first is the flame of creation; of the
 
             poet and artist; of the lovers' passion for union with the beloved. The second is
 
             the flame of purification and testing, the flame of truth. With this flame all dross
 
             and weakness are made clear and cleansed from thee, so thou become like a true and
 
             tested sword. The third is the greatest of all, for it is the healing flame born out
 
             of the love that gives all, the maker of peace and harmony. But I do not give these
 
             gifts one by one; I give them as a whole in the form of the growing Sun.
 
 
 
             Everyone then lights their candle from the Yule log, and starts to circle deosil,
 
             lighting the candles around the room as they go, chanting: 
 
 
 
             Thus we banish winter, thus we welcome spring;
 
             Say farewell to what is dead, and greet each living thing.
 
 
 
             When all the candles are lit, everyone places their candle in a sand pot, and the
 
             chanting ceases.
 
 
 
             HPs and HP bless cakes and wine.
 
 
                                                                                            1759
