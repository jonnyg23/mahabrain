           CompuServe online Yule Ritual, 1990
 
           (8-2,DragonHart) Relax....let the worries of the day dissolve
                into the earth under your feet.  Breath deeply.  This is a
                journey, sacred and magical.  Prepare yourself for that
                journey. 
                * 
                Yule is a time of change.  Death and rebirth are the  
                themes that this holiday brings to us.  We enter this sacred
                time anxious for the birth and growth of the Sun God.  We
                naturally go through many changes during this time.  We make
                resolutions to do better, to give up things that keep us
                from growing.
                *
                In our mind's eye we draw a circle of Power.  Our blade
                travels at astounding speeds, dividing us from the rest of
                the natural world.  We are set apart, between worlds. 
                *
                Taking the chalice of water, we sprinkle the circle,  
                feeling the cool liquid on our fingers.  We begin to feel
                the cleansing power of our Mother's blood.  The sprinkling
                finished, we return the chalice to the altar. 
                * 
                The smoke from the censor curls playfully around your
                fingers as you reach to pick it up.  Breath deep of the
                sweet Frankincense and Myrhh as you walk the boundries of
                the circle with it.  Let the scent drive away all negativity
                in you.  When you have finished your sacred task, place the
                censor in it's place on the altar. 
                * 
                Pause a moment to notice the unlit altar candle.
