 BLOODSTONE
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Bloodstone is a member of the Chalcedony
 family.It is a variety of quartz (silicon dioxide) often with some iron
 and aluminum. The chemistry is SiO2. It is dark, bright green spotted
 with red inclusions. The streak is white. This is considered a microcry-
 stalline variety of quartz and is not found in crystal form.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Chalcedony is formed in several environments, generally
 near the surface of the earth where temperatures and pressures are
 relatively low. It commonly forms in the zone of alteration of lode and
 massive hydrothermal replacement deposits and as bodies of chert in
 chemical sedimentary rocks.
 
 OCCURENCE: India, Germany.
 
 NAME: This stone is also referred to as "heliotrope," which is derived
 from two Greek words which signify "sun-turning". It was given this name
 because of a notion that when immersed in water it would turn the sun
 red. Chalcedony is derived from Chalcedon, an ancient Greek city of Asia
 Minor.
 
 LEGEND and LORE: This is one of the birthstones for March.
 
     "Who in this world of ours, her eyes
     In March first opens, shall be wise.
     In days of peril, firm and brave,
     And wear a Bloodstone to her grave." (5)
 
 Ancient warriors often carried an amulet of bloodstone which was
 intended to stop bleeding when applied to a wound.
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Because it is green, it can be used for "money
 spells". It is also considered a "lucky" stone for atheletes because it
 imparts courage and stamina.
 
 HEALING: Heliotrope is used today in conjunction with anything having to
 do with blood.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:I consider the ancient uses of bloodstone in line
 with what I use it for today. In addition, I consider it a "cholesterol
 buster", and wouldn't hesitate to apply it to any with this type of
 problem. Generally I would use it at the Heart Chakra. I've also used it
 successfully in situations where I needed "courage" to accomplish
 something. I will just carry a piece of it in my pocket for this
 purpose.
 
 NOTE: Chrysoprase, carnelian, jasper and agate are all forms of
 Chalcedony.

  an interesting experiment (BLOODSTONE cont.)
 .......................................................................-
 This is more about bloodstone, but I didn't want to include it in the
 main text.  Read on, and you'll see why...
 
 A few years ago, I had a discussion with my daughter (who was about 13
 at the time) about the "spiritual essence" of plants and stones. I
 explained to her that different people "see" this spiritual essence in
 various forms. Somehow, this led to a discussion of "devas", which she
 interpreted as "people, but without a body that we can see with mundane
 eyes."
 
 A few days later, I was reading a novel, reposed on the sofa in my
 livingroom.  She was sitting on the floor by the coffee table, drawing
 in her sketchbook with her pastels.
 
 On the coffee table were several stones in a dish. One was an amethyst,
 one a bloodstone, one was some yellow/green crystal that someone had
 loaned to me because they wanted my "impressions" ...and there were some
 others that I don't remember now.
 
 I glanced over at my daughter, and she was holding one of the stones in
 her hands, with her eyes closed. She apparently had achieved some form
 of "altered state" because her little eyeballs were just wigglin' away
 (REM).
 
 A while later, I glanced over, and she was drawing a portrait. After she
 seemed finished and satisfied with what she was doing, I questioned her
 about it. She said she was drawing the "spirit/deva" of the stones in
 the dish.
 
 The one for bloodstone was an elf-like, male person. He had dark/black
 hair, green, slanted eyes, "Spock" eyebrows, and pointed ears. Because
 of the expression on his face, I asked her what she thought of him. Her
 comments were:
 "He is very fierce. I'm kind of afraid of him, because it seems like he
 is pretty strong and could get mad. He uses weapons...and can fight."
 
 My daughter didn't know anything about the "lore" connected with the
 stones. In addition, I found that "bloodstone" was very different from
 any of the other "stone portraits" that she did...The rest were much
 more "human"...

 BROWN (PICTURE) JASPER
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Brown Jasper, sometimes called "picture" Jasper
 because of the beautiful variations in coloring, is a type of Chal-
 cedony. It is closely related to Quartz, with the chemistry of SiO2. The
 color variations are from trace amounts of other minerals, usually iron
 and aluminum. The hardness is 7.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Chalcedony is formed in several environments, generally
 near the surface of the earth where temperatures and pressures are
 relatively low. It commonly forms in the zone of alteration of lode and
 massive hydrothermal replacement deposits and as bodies of chert in
 chemical sedimentary rocks.
 
 OCCURENCE: Montana, Utah and Wyoming are prolific locations for Brown
 Jasper in the U.S. In addition, fine specimens have come from Brazil,
 Uruguay and Egypt.  Other colors and forms of Jasper are abundant in
 California, Texas and Arkansas.
 
 NAME: The name Chalcedony is from Chalcedon, an ancient Greek city of
 Asia Minor.
 
 LEGEND and LORE: Beautiful Jasper, with light and dark brown markings
 was referred to as "Egyptian Marble". Various Native American tribes
 used Jasper as a rubbing stone and some called it "the rain bringer".
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Brown Jasper is balancing and grounding. This stone,
 carved into an arrowhead, is worn to attract luck. It is a good stone to
 use after completing a ritual to help you regain your center and become
 grounded.
 
 HEALING: Jasper is stabilizing. It will help to reduce insecurity, fear
 and guilt.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I use a piece of Montana Picture Jasper, which is
 mostly brown and tan with a slight bit of sky or navy blue as a strong
 grounding stone for those who have an excess of energy at the Splenic
 Chakra.I've also used the stone as a basis for a "journey"...The stone
 looks like a scene of the Rocky Mountains. Finally, I've used Picture
 Jasper as a psychological tool:I will ask someone who is "looking for an
 answer" to gaze into the stone and describe all the symbols they see.
 Then I work with the client to form the "symbols" into some sort of
 answer.
 
 NOTES: Agate, Jasper, Flint, Sardonyx, and onyx are all forms of
 Chalcedony. In addition, particular colors of Chalcedony have specific
 names, such as Heliotrope, Bloodstone, Chrysophrase and Moss Agate.

 CARNELIAN
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION:Carnelian is the clear red to brownish red member
 of the Chalcedony family. It is a microcrystalline variety of Quartz(Si-
 licone Dioxide) and may contain small amounts of iron oxides. The
 hardness is 7, and the streak is white.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Chalcedony is formed in several environments, generally
 near the surface of the earth where temperatures and pressures are
 relatively low. It commonly forms in the zone of alteration of lode and
 massive hydrothermal replacement deposits and as bodies of chert in
 chemical sedimentary rocks.
 
 OCCURENCE: Fine carnelian comes from India and South America.
 
 GEMSTONE INFORMATION:Carnelian is used as an alternate birthstone for
 the month of May.It is normally cut into cabochons, engraved, or made
 into seal stones or rounded, polished, and pierced for necklaces and
 other items of jewelry.
 
 NAME: The name means "flesh-colored", from [caro], meaning "genitive"
 and [carnis], meaning "flesh".
 
 LEGEND and LORE: Carnelian has long been associated with courage and
 cleansing of the blood. It was beleived that the stone would improve
 one's outlook, making the individual cheerful and expelling fears.
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Katrina Raphaell says that Carnelian can be used to
 "see into the past". The "Crystal Oracle" says that Carnelian referrs to
 the Self, and Current Conditions. It is a grounding stone, and associ-
 ated with the Earth.  As such, it is considered practical, sensible and
 balanced. Cunningham associates the stone with the element of Fire. He
 suggests it as a talisman against Telepathic invasion.
 
 HEALING: It is recommended for infertility or impotency. In addition it
 is used for purification of the blood. It has also been suggested that
 this stone will stop nosebleeding.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I call this the "sexy" stone...since I beleive it
 stimulates sexual appetites. I use it in the lower Chakras for infer-
 tility and impotency for men(I use Coral as the feminine counterpart.)
 I always get a good chuckle when I notice a man wearing a LARGE
 Cornelian belt buckle. In addition, I would use this stone for relief of
 pain from arthritis in men.

 CORAL
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: CaCo3, or calcium carbonate in the form of
 calcite, is the main constituent of calcareous corals; minor con-
 stituents are MgCo3, or magnesium carbonate and proteinaceous organic
 substances, which act as binding agents. At 2.5 to 4, the hardness is
 slightly higher than that of calcite. The skeletons of corals vary in
 color: from bright to dark red, slightly orange-red, pink and white.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: In all cases, coral consists of the branching skeletons of
 animals which live in colonies planted on the seabed at depths varying
 from tens to hundreds of meters. They are typical of warmish to very
 warm seas.
 
 OCCURENCE: The most famous of these organisms is Corallium rubrum, which
 lives in the waters of the Mediterranean and, despite its name,provides
 not only red, but orange, pink, and white coral. Similar to this are
 Corallium elatius, C. japonicum, and C. secundum, which maily live off
 the coasts of Japan, China, Indochina, the Philippines, and other
 archipelagos of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Coral colonies occupy
 large areas especially in the Pacific, but also near the coast of South
 Africa, in the Red Sea, and to the east of Australia.  These latter
 colonies, however, consist of madrepore, which has little in common with
 the corals used as ornaments.
 
 GEMSTONE INFORMATION: Most of the coral used since antiquity as an
 ornamental material comes from the calcareous skeletons of colonies of
 marine organisms of the phylum Cnidaria, order Corgonacea, genus
 Corallium. Corals take a good polish. They also have a certain degree of
 elasticity and can be heated and bent into bangles. Thin brancehes were
 and still are polished, pierced, and threaded, unaltered, into neck-
 laces. Larger pieces are cut into spherical or faceted necklace beads,
 pear shapes for pendant jewelry, or cabochons. It is also used for
 carved pieces and small figurines, in both oriental and western
 art styles. The most highly prized varities of coral are those that are
 a uniform, strong bright red.
 
 NAME: The name is derived from the Latin [corallium,] related to the
 Greek [korallion].
 
 LEGEND and LORE: The oldest known findings of red coral date from the
 Mesopotamian civilization, i.e. from about 3000 BC. For centuries, this
 was the coral par excellence, and at the time of Pliny the Elder it was
 apparently much appreciated in India, even more than in Europe.Red coral
 has traditionally been used as a protection from the "evil eye" and as
 a cure for sterility.  One of the Greek names for Coral was Gorgeia,
 from the tradition that blood dripped from the Head of Medea, which
 Perseus had deposited on some branches near the sea-shore; which blood,
 2609
 
 becoming hard, was taken by the Sea Nymps, and planted in the sea. (8)
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Coral is associated with Venus, Isis and Water. It
 has been used as a form of protective magic for children for hundreds of
 years.  Cunningham recommends it as a luck-attractor for living
 areas.Sailors use it as a protection from bad weather while at sea.
 Red-orange coral is one of the four element gemstones of the Pueblo
 Indians. It is one of the four colors used for the directions in the
 Hopi/Zuni Road of Life. Coral is considered a representative of the warm
 energy of the Sun, and the southern direction.
 
 HEALING: Coral's healing properties are mostly associated with Women,
 young children and the elderly. For women it is said to increase
 fertility and regulate menstration. For young children, it is recom-
 mended to ease teething and to prevent epilepsy. For the elderly, it is
 used as a cure for arthritis.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I use coral at the lower Chakras for "Women's
 Healing." In  particular, I will use it for disorders relating to female
 reproductive organs.  I also use it magically, to represent female
 fertility.I have used it with some success for arthritis, but only for
 women. This is one of the stones that I "reserve" for female/feminine
 use. (I use Carnelian as the "male" counterpart.)  I have not had an
 opportunity to try it for a young child.

 EMERALD
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION:Emerald is a type of Beryl, Beryllium aluminum
 silicate, frequently with some sodium, lithium and cesium.It's chemistry
 is Be3Al2Si6O18. Beryls range in color from Bright green (emerald),
 blue, greenish blue (aquamarine), yellow (golden beryl), red, pink
 (morganite) to white. The streak is colorless. It's hardness is 7-1/2 to
 8. The crystals are Hexagonal and they are common. Fine emeralds have
 velvety body appearance; their value lies in their even distribution of
 color. Inclusions are common in emerald, but other stones of this group
 are usually most valuable when free of flaws.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Beryl develops in pegmatites and certain metamorphic rocks.
 It occurs with quartz, microcline, and muscovite in pegmatites, and with
 quartz, muscovite, and almandine in schist of regional metamorphic
 rocks.
 
 OCCURENCE: Best emerald comes from Colombia.(NOTE: it is not necessary
 to spend thousands of dollars for a tiny chip of emerald to add to your
 healing/ magical collection. If you look around in rock shops, you may
 be able to come across some "less than perfect" stones that aren't
 faceted. I've found 4 of them, slightly larger than my fingernail and
 they were about $3.00 each.)
 
 NAME: The name is from the Greek [beryllos] indicating any green
 gemstone.
 
 LEGEND and LORE: Emerald is considered a birthstone for the month of
 May.
 
     "Who first beholds the light of day,
     In spring's sweet flowery month of May,
     And wears an Emerald all her life,
     Shall be a loved, and happy wife." (5)
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: "If you wish to bring a love into your life, buy an
 emerald and charge it with your magical need through your visualization,
 perhaps while placing it near a green candle. After this ritual, wear or
 carry the emerald somewhere near your heart. Do this in such a way that
 it cannot be seen by others. When you meet a future love, you'll know it
 wasn't the visible jewel that attracted him or her." (3) The Greeks
 associated this stone with the Goddess Venus. It has come to represent,
 for many people, the security of love.  Emerald, like allmost all of the
 green stones, is also advantageous for business/money ventures.
 
 HEALING: Emerald is said to aid perception and inner clarity. Because of
 this, they are also associated with healing diseases of the eye, and
 problems affecting eyesight. It was believed that emeralds could
 counteract poisons and cure disentary.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:I sometimes use Emeralds in a stone layout. I will
 use them for their psychological/spiritual values of clarity and
 perception. If I am using them for this purpose, I use them in the area
 of the Heart Chakra, in conjunction with Rose Quartz, or Rhodochrosite
 for balanced energy. I've also used them for prosperity consciousness.

 GARNET (PYROPE)
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Pyrope Garnets are from a group of very closely
 related aluminum silicates. The Chemistry for the Pyrope variety is
 Mg3Al2Si3O12. These Garnets range in color from deep red to reddish
 black and on rare occasions from purple and rose to pale purplish red
 (sometimes called [rhodolite].) The hardness ranges between 6-1/2 and
 7-1/2.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Pyrope occurs with olivine and hypersthene in peridotite of
 plutonic rocks.
 
 OCCURENCE: Pyrope Garnets occur in peridotite in Kentucky, Arkansas,
 Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. In the latter half of the nineteenth
 century, most Pyrope came from Bohemia, where it is still found today.
 The main sources nowadays, however, are South Africa, Zimbabwe,
 Tanzania, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia.
 
 GEMSTONE INFORMATION: The garnet species with red or purple varieties,
 including Pyrope are considered gemstones. Usually bright red, Pyrope
 can be a much less attractive brick or dark red. It can be perfectly
 transparent, but this feature is less visible in dark specimens. It is
 either made into fairly convex cabochons, or faceted, with an oval or
 round mixed cut or, more rarely, a step cut. The faceted gems have good
 luster, rather less obvious in cabochons. The most valuable types are,
 of course, the transparent ones with the brightest red color. Pyrope is
 relatively common, although less so than almandine. Very large stones,
 up to several hundred carats have been found; but these are rare and are
 found in museums and famous collections.
 
 NAME: The name comes from the Greek [pyropos,] meaning "fiery." The name
 "Garnet" comes from the Latin [granatus,] meaning "seed-like".
 
 LEGEND and LORE: Pyrope Garnet has long been associated with love,
 passion, sensuality and sexuality. Some Asiatic tribes used red garnets
 as bullets for sling bows because they pierced their victims quickly,
 and could not be seen well in the body when they mingled with the blood.
 2612
 
 Throughout the ages, Pyrope has been used as a curative for all types of
 ailments dealing with blood.
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Pyrope is directly linked with the Will. As such, it
 is a strong stone for the Magician and Shaman. It is associated with
 Fire and Mars, Strength and Protection. It will help the practitioner
 tap into extra energy for ritualistic purposes.
 
 HEALING: While all Garnets are associated with the Root Chakra, Pyrope
 is particularly symbolic. It is used for healing when the subject
 involved has "lost the will to live", since it is directly related to
 the desire to live and achieve in this lifetime. This stone warms and
 aids blood circulation, rouses sexuality and heals the reproductive
 system and the heart.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: If you are already a strong willed individual or
 have a fiery temper that you need to learn to control, I suggest that
 you work with the Alamandine Garnets, rather than the Pyropes. This is
 a good stone to use for treating depression. Very often, when I've
 "worked" on an individual who has suffered a heart attack, I find that
 the individual is rather severely depressed (which I think is a side
 effect of the medication) and has lost the will to continue in this
 lifetime. I've found that fiery red Pyrope Garnets are a great help in
 this situation.
 
 ADDITIONAL NOTES: The Latin name [carbunculus,] (small coal or ember),
 is attributed to all red transparent stones. It is more often applied to
 Pyropes when they are formed into cabochons than any other stone.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 GARNET (ALMANDINE)
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION:  Almandine Garnets are from a group of very
 closely related aluminum silicates. The Chemistry for the Almandine
 variety is Fe2/3+Al2Si3O12. These Garnets range in color from deep red
 to brown and brownish black. The hardness ranges between 6-1/2 and
 7-1/2.
 
 2613
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Almandine occurs in diorite of plutonic rocks, and with
 andalusite, hornblende, and biotite in hornfels and schist of contact
 and regional metamorphic rocks.
 
 OCCURENCE: Well-formed crystals of Almandine have come from Wrangell, SE
 Alaska; from Emerald Creek, Benewah Co., Idaho; and from Michigamme,
 Michigan.  Gemstone quality material is obtained in large quantities
 from Sri Lanka and India, where it is also cut; other sources are Burma,
 Brazil, Madagascar, Tanzania, and Australia.
 
 GEMSTONE INFORMATION: Most red garnets come under the name Almandine,
 even when their composition is midway between that of Pyrope and
 Almandine and similar, in many cases, to that of Rhodolite. The reason
 for this is the similarity in their color and absorption spectrum
 characteristics. Almandine has a brilliant luster, but its transparency
 is frequently marred, even in very clear stones, by excessive depth of
 color. The cabochon cut is widely used, often being given a strongly
 convex shape and sometimes a concave base, in an effort to lighten
 the color by reducing the thickness. Rose cuts have also been used,
 particularly in the past. Nowdays, when the material is quite transpare-
 nt, faceted cuts are used as well, and sometimes square or rectangular
 step cuts.  Gems of several carats are not uncommon. Faceted or even
 barely rounded pieces of Almandine, pierced as necklace beads, were very
 common in the recent past, but are now considered old-fashioned.
 
 NAME: The name Almandine comes from [carbunculus alabandicus,] after the
 city of Alabanda in Asia Minor, where gems were traded at the time of
 Pliny theElder.
 
 LEGEND and LORE: All red Garnet has long been associated with love,
 passion, sensuality and sexuality. Garnet is considered a birthstone for
 those born in January:
 
 "By her in January born
 No gem save Garnets should be worn;
 They will ensure her constancy,
 True friendship, and fidelity."
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: The darker Garnets are associated with the Will and
 the Source of Life Incarnate. This is who and what we are in this
 lifetime. This stone is worn for protective purposes, and is thought to
 drive off demons and phantoms.
 
 HEALING: Almandine Garnets are used to heal skin conditions associated
 with poor circulation. They improve vigor, strength and endurance.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: Almandine Garnets are particularly effective when
 healing "traumas" that are carried over from a past life and deal with
 sexuality and heart/love problems.

 GARNET (SPESSARTINE)
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION:  Spessartine Garnets are from a group of very
 closely related aluminum silicates. The Chemistry for the Spessartine
 variety is Mn3Al2Si3O12. These Garnets range in color from brownish red
 to hyacinth-red.  The hardness ranges between 6-1/2 and 7-1/2.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Spessartine occurs with albite and muscovite in granite
 pegmatites and with quartz and riebeckite in blue schist or regional
 metamorphic rocks..
 
 OCCURENCE: Large corroded crystals of Spessartine have come from the
 Rutherford No. 2 Mine, Amelia, Amelia Co., Virginia; crystals up to 1"
 in diameter have been found in several pegmatites in the Ramona
 District, San Diego Co., California; sharp, dark-red, well-formed
 crystals occur in cavities in rhyolite near Ely, White Pine C., Nevada;
 and brilliant crystals of Spessartine have been found with topaz at Ruby
 Mt., near Nathrop, Chaffee Co., Colorado. Gem material comes from the
 gem gravels of Sri Lanka and Burma. It is also found in Brazil and
 Madagascar.
 
 GEMSTONE INFORMATION: The gem variety of Spessartine Garnet is uncommon.
 It tends to be midway between spessartine and almandine in composition.
 The "aurora red", orange-red or orange-pink color is typical. It has
 good transparency and considerable luster. It is normally given a mixed,
 round, or oval cut. The weight does not normally exceed a few carats.
 Gems of about 10 carats are extremely rare and usually of an atypical,
 rather dark, unattactive color.
 
 NAME: Spessartine is named after an occurrence in the spessart district,
 Bavaria, Germany.
 
 LEGEND and LORE: In the 13th century garnets were thought to repel
 insect stings. A magical treatise, "The Book of Wings", dating from the
 thirteenth century says "The well-formed image of a lion, if engraved on
 a garnet, will protect and preserve honors and health, cures the wearer
 of all diseases, brings him honors, and guards him from all perils in
 traveling."
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Spessartine is normally considered to be red-orange
 to orange-pink. Thus it links the "will" with the "desire". It is a good
 stone to use when casting a spell for your "heart's desire", especially
 if it is of the orange-pink" variety.
 2615
 
 HEALING: The orange garnets are linked to the root and the belly chakra.
 They are beneficial in instances of infertility, dealing with reproduc-
 tive organs. Mentally, it inspires confidence in personal creativity and
 self-worth.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: Spessartine is not as effective as Carnelian for
 instances of infertility. But it DOES help the mental attitude of the
 individual experiencing the difficulty. It is a warming stone, and works
 well for increasing circulation in the lower part of the body.

 GARNET (GROSSULAR)
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION:  Grossular Garnets are from a group of very
 closely related calcium silicates. The Chemistry for the Grossular
 variety is Ca3Al2Si3O12. These Garnets range in color from yellow, pink
 and brown through white and colorless. The hardness ranges between 6-1/2
 and 7-1/2.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Grossular occurs with wollastonite, calcite, and vesuviani-
 te in hornfels of contact metamorphic rocks.
 
 OCCURENCE: Being the commonest of all garnets, it is found in a variety
 of locations. Fine colorless crystals up to 1/2" across occur in
 Gatineau and Magantic Cos., Quebec, fine lusterous pale brown crystals
 2616
 
 up to 3" across were found near Minot, Androscoggin Co., Main, and
 beautiful white and pick crystals up to 4" across have been found near
 Xalostoc, Morelos, Mexico.
 
 GEMSTONE INFORMATION: Grossular also has the typical crystal form of
 garnets, occuring in isolated crystals which are often complete, in the
 shape of a rhombic dodecahedron, sometimes combined with a trapezo-
 hedron. They vary from transparent to semiopaque. The typical color is
 light (gooseberry) yellowish green; but they can be a strong to bluish
 green, honey yellow or pinkish yellow, or even colorless. When transpar-
 ent, the crystals have good luster.  Like other garnets, they have no
 cleavage. The greenish to yellowish varieties are used as gems. 
 Grossular is not a rare mineral. The types used as gems mainly come from
 the gem gravels of Sri Lanka (honey yellow variety); the the United
 States, Canada, Mexico, Madagascar, Kenya. The green variety of
 grossular garnet, discovered a few decades ago and found mainly in
 Kenya, near the Tsavo National Park, is also known as Tsavorite (or
 Tsavolite) It is a light, verdant, or dark green, similar to the color
 of the better green tourmalines and sometimes, it is said, even
 comparable to African emerald. It has good luster. These gems, which are
 usually given a round or pear-shaped mixed cut, or occasionally a
 brilliant cut, are generally small, rarely exceeding one carat and never
 more than a few carats.
 
 NAME: Grossular is from the New Latin [grosssularia,] "gooseberry,"
 because some Grossular crystals are pale green like the fruit.
 
 LEGEND and LORE: I do not find anything referring specifically to yellow
 or green garnets in my sources.
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: While deep red garnets focus on "Will" and orange--
 red garnets focus on "Desire", yellow garnets are focused on Personal
 Power and Personality. In addition they are (because of their color)
 associated with athletic prowess and Oriental philosophies.
 
 HEALING: Being linked to the Solar Plexus Chakra, yellow garnets are
 energizing. They can be used for the digestive organs, the diaphram (and
 the breath) and eyesight. Green garnets center their healing on the
 Heart Chakra.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: It is difficult to find a green stone that works
 well for the lower chakras and the lower half of the body. When I do
 total layouts for individuals with Aids, I use all green stones,
 whenever possible. The Green garnets work well for this. Since Garnet is
 the stone of the Root Chakra, the Will, and green is the color of the
 Heart Chakra, love, circulation, general healing, this stone works
 exceptionally well. I find that the yellow garnets work better for
 magical purposes than healing. For healing, there are several
 yellow stones that seem to work better for me.
 
 NOTES: Garnets are used in industry as an abrasive.

          -----------------------------------------------------
 LAZURITE (LAPIS LAZULI)
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Lazurite is a silicate of sodium calcium and
 aluminum, with some sulfur. It is a member of the sodalite group. It's
 chemistry is (Na, Ca)8(Al,Si)12O24(S,SO)4. The color ranges in shades of
 blue from violet blue and azure blue thru greenish-blue. Lazurite is
 distinguished from sodalite by its deeper color and fine grain. It is
 also softer and lighter in weight than lazulite. It is dull to greasy
 and the streak is pale blue. The hardness ranges between 5 and 5-1/2.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Crystals are rare. It is usually granular, compact,
 massive. It forms in association with pyrite, calcite, and diopside in
 hornfels of contact metamorphic rocks. The opaque, vivid blue, light
 blue, greenish-blue, or violet-blue stone, consisting largely of
 lazurite but with appreciable amounts of calcite, diopside, and pyrite,
 is a rock called [lapis lazuli.] The stone is usually veined or spotted.
 Its value depends largely upon excellence and uniformity of color and
 absence of pyrite, although some purchasers prefer lapis with pyrite.
 
 OCCURRENCE: Lazurite is a rare mineral in North America, but it does
 occur on Italian Mt. in the Sawatch Mts. of Colorado; on Ontario Peak in
 the San Gabriel Mts., Los Angeles Co., and in Cascade Canyon in the San
 Bernardino Mts., San Bernardino Co., California. The finest lapis lazuli
 has come from Badakshan in Afghanistan, and less valuable material has
 come from Russia and Chile.
 
 NAME:  The name is from the Arabic [lazaward], "heaven," which was also
 applied to sky-blue lapis lazuli.
 2618
 
 LEGEND and LORE: Lapis Lazuli was a favorite stone of the ancient
 Egyptians. In the past Lazurite has been burned and ground to form the
 pigment "ultramarine." It was consider an aid to childbirth, and has
 long been associated with altered states of consciousness and trance
 work. Lapis is sometimes designated as a birthstone for December,
 although turquoise is most common.
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: To quote Cunningham: "This stone is used in rituals
 designed to attract spiritual love. Take an untumbled piece of lapis
 with a sharp edge.  Empower the stone and a pink candle with your need
 for love. Then, using the lapis lazuli, carve a heart onto the candle.
 Place the stone near the candleholder and burn the candle while
 visualizing a love coming into your life." Actually, the most important
 magical aspect of lapis is it's ability to strengthen psychic awareness.
 Cunningham says "Despite its somewhat high price, lapis lazuli is one
 stone every stone magician should own and utilize."(2)
 
 HEALING: This stone is used at the Ajina, the Brow Chakra. It's related
 gland is the pituitary. The pituitary gland is also referred to as the
 "master gland" because it regulates all of the others. This location is
 also the center for the eyes, ears, nose and brain.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I don't often use Lapis for physical healing,
 unless I feel that there is a "link" between what is manifested as
 disease, and some conflict of the "higher self". I have used it for
 brain disorders (tumors, inflammation, etc.) More often, I use it in
 layouts where the client is trying to achieve an altered state of
 consciousness.

 LEPIDOLITE
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Lepidolite a potassium, lithium, aluminum
 fluorsilicate mica. Its chemistry is complex: K(Li,Al)3(Si,Al)4O10-
 (F,OH)2. It is pink, lilac, yellowish, grayish white or a combination of
 all of these. The streak is colorless. It is one of the softer stones,
 with a hardness of 2-1/2 to 3.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Lepidolite is confined to granite pegmatites, where it
 occurs either as fine-granular masses near the core of the pegmatite or
 as stubby or tabular crystals in cavities. It is commonly associated
 with microcline, quartz, and tourmaline.
 2619
 
 OCCURENCE: Large fine masses of lepidolite have been mined at the
 Stewart Pegmatite at Pala, and superb sharp crystals have been obtained
 from the Little Three Pegmatite near Ramona, both in San Diego Co.,
 California. It has also been mined in substantial amounts in several New
 England states and in the Black Hills of South Dakota.
 
 NAME: The name comes from the Greek [lepidos], meaning 'scale', in
 allusion to the scaly aggregates in which the mineral commonly occurs.
 
 ................................................................................
 2620
 
 LEGEND and LORE: Lepidolite is a stone that could certainly be con-
 sidered "new age" in the sense that it is just now coming into recogni-
 tion by healers and magicians. There is no "past lore" on this stone, to
 the best of my knowledge.  Part of this may be due to the fact, that it
 is native to the United States.
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: "This stone soothes anger, hatred or any other
 negative emotion. To quiet the entire house, place lepidolite stones in
 a circle around a pink candle." (2)
 
 HEALING: Lepidolite is also know as the "Dream Stone". It will protect
 the individual from nightmares, especially those caused by stress or an
 upset in personal relationships. It can be used in the same types of
 circumstances as Kunzite, namely for manic depression or schizophrenia.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: This is one of the most soothing and relaxing
 stones I've ever held. It is a beauty to look at, and calms the mind
 enabling it to concentrate on the TRUE source of a problem...instead of
 running around in frantic circles accomplishing nothing. The more
 rubellite in the stone, the better it will help the heart and mind work
 together.
 
 NOTES: Lepidolite has been used as a source of lithium. The above
 description of the appearance of this stone may be deceiving, as I found
 Cunningham's to be, also. All of the specimens of this stone that I have
 seen so far have been grey to a pale lavendar grey with "sparkles" of
 the lithium mica embedded in it. The heart-shaped cabuchon that I have
 also has very distinctive crystals of rubellite (pink tourmaline) and
 veins of white running through it. I was originally looking for a MUCH
 brighter lavendar stone. It is unusual, also, to find specimens that are
 cut and polished. Usually the stone is too "crumbly" to take a good
 polish. However, it is equally handsome in rough form.

         ------------------------------------------------------
 MALACHITE
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Malachite is a basic copper carbonate. It's
 chemistry is Cu2CO3(OH)2. It ranges in color from emerald green thru
 grass green to shades of silky pale green. The streak is light green.
 It's hardness is 3-1/2 to 4.  Crystals are rare. Most gem specimens
 display distinctive concentric colorbanding; (alternating dark green and
 light green bands.)
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Malachite is a secondary copper mineral and develops in the
 zone of alteration in massive, lode, and disseminated hydrothermal
 replacement deposits.  Associated minerals are azurite, limonite, and
 2621
 
 chalcopyrite.
 
 OCCURENCE: The copper mines at Bisbee, Chochise Co., Arizona, are famous
 for their fine specimens of massive malachite and pseudomorphs of
 malachite after azurite. Mines at Morenci in Greenlee Co., and at Globe
 in Gila Co., Arizona, have yielded beautiful malachite specimens, of
 which some consist of alternating layers of green malachite and blue
 azurite. Fine malachite has also come from copper mines in California,
 Nevada, Utah, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.
 
 NAME: The name is from the Greek [moloche], "mallow," an illusion to the
 mineral's leaf-green color. Malachite is used as an ore of copper and as
 a gemstone.
 
 LEGEND and LORE: It is said that if malachite is worn, it will break
 into pieces to warn the wearer of danger.
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Used to direct power towards magical goals.
 Protective, especially towards children. According to Cunningham, "Small
 pieces of malachite placed in each corner of a business building or a
 small piece placed in the cash register draws customers. Worn during
 business meetings or trade shows, it increases your ability to obtain
 good deals and sales. It is the salesperson's stone." (2)
 
 HEALING: If the malachite is of the blue-green variety, it can be
 associated with the Sacral Center, or Splenic Chakra (Svadisthana).
 Here, it's energy branches to the left, to the spleen. (It is intended
 in this position for those who are celebate.) In addition, if it is
 grass-green, it can be used at the Lumbar/Solar Plexis Center. "When the
 malachite is placed at the solar plexus and a piece of green jade is
 placed at the heart center and a double-terminated quartz crystal is
 placed between them, people may remember events that have been blocked
 for years. They may cry or scream. As these buried emotions are brought
 to the surface and released, a great weight is lifted and they soon feel
 renewed." (3)
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I am very careful about using Malachite. It has
 been my experience that the emotions that it releases can be very
 powerful, to the point of overwhelming some people. On the other hand,
 if the individual is ready to deal with them (in a "growth" period) it
 may work out just fine. You could "balance" the emotional content with
 a pink stone (such as rose quartz) to cut down some on the intensity.
 
 A few years ago, I broke my arm. To do so, I damaged the muscles and
 nerves in my wrist. I was in a lot of pain, and was searching for what
 I could do to help the situation. During a journey, I saw malachite, so
 I found a malachite heart which I held in the palm of the broken arm
 while meditating. I got a lot of relief from it. Now, if the wrist acts
 up, I use the heart, taped over the wrist area when I go to bed at
 night. It seems to help quite a bit. I now recommend malachite for
 nerve/muscle damage with some success. (4)

           --------------------------------------------------
 MOONSTONE
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Moonstone is one variation of Orthoclase. It
 owes its beautiful silvery to bluish sheen ('adularescence' or 'schil-
 ler') to its composition of extremely thin plates of orthoclase and
 albite. The thinner these plates are, the bluer is the sheen. There are
 also moonstones consisting mainly of albite. These are less translucent,
 but they can occur in a variety of colours: grey, blue, green, brown,
 yellow and white. There are also moonstone cat's-eyes. The chemical
 composition is KAlSi3O8 and the hardness is 7. The streak is white.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: The potash feldspars are important rock-forming minerals in
 plutonic, volcanic, and metamorphic rocks. Adularia and sanidine are
 found usually in volcanic rocks.
 
 OCCURENCE: The main countries of origin are Ceylon, southern India (the
 district near Kangayam), Tanzia and Malagasy which, together with Burma,
 produces some of the finest stones with a deep blue schiller. White
 adularia crystals up to 2.5 cm (1") across have been found in gold-bear-
 ing quartz veins at Bodie, Mono Co., California, and in the silver mines
 of the Silver City district, Owhyee Co., Idaho.
 
 GEMSTONE INFORMATION: Moonstone is always cut into cabochons, to display
 the cat's-eye, or schiller.
 
 NAME: Adularia (another name for Moonstone) comes from the locality in
 Switzerland, the Adula Mts.
 
 LEGEND and LORE: This stone has always been revered because of its lunar
 attraction. It was believed that the shiller in the stone would follow
 the cycles of the moon. (Becoming greatest when the moon was full.) In
 addition, it has always been considered a "feminine, or Goddess" stone.
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Meditation with moonstone calls into consciousness
 the three-form moon phase goddesses, Diana/Selene/Hecate, the waxing,
 Full and waning Moon. These are woman as goddess in her ages and
 contradictions, Maiden/Mother/Crone. Cunningham favors this stone for
 spells involving love. In addition he has a longish essay on using it
 for a "diet" stone.
 
 HEALING: Because of it's feminine nature, Moonstone has long been
 considered a "womans healing stone". It is used traditionally for
 healing/balancing of female organs and hormones.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I use Moonstone at the Transpersonal Point, for
 connection to the Goddess and Universal Feminine Energy. This is the
 connection to dreams and dreaming, feminine "intuition", and "cycles".
 There are cycles of time, seasons, the moon, stars, etc. I also use/give
 2623
 
 this stone for those clients who are having difficulty being in tune
 with the feminine side of their nature.  (Everyone has a masculine and
 a feminine side.)
 
 NOTES: In the past, this stone has also been called "Cylon Opal".

             -----------------------------------------------
 OBSIDIAN
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Obsidian occurs as volcanic lava flows that are
 thick and of limited area. Its black, glassy, lustrous, and often
 flow-banded appearance makes it rather easy to distinguish from the
 other volcanic rocks with which it is commonly associated. This mineral
 forms when a silica-rich magma of granitic composition flows onto the
 earth's surface, where it solidifies before minerals can develop and
 crystallize. It is, therefore, an amorphous solid or glass rather than
 an aggregate of minerals. The hardness of Obsidian is between 6 and 7;
 it will scratch window glass. Although generally black, it is more or
 less smoky along translucent to transparent edges; other colors are
 gray, reddish brown, mahogany and dark green. When it has small white
 "flower" designs in it, it is called Snowflake Obsidian. It is also
 possible to find pieces with a sheen, or chatoyance. This is often
 called Rainbow Obsidian.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Obsidian is an environment for very few minerals. Lithophy-
 sae and spherulites may contain small but beautiful crystals of
 feldspar, tridymite, and cristobalite.
 
 OCCURENCE: Some locations of Obsidian bodies are California (Inyo,
 Imperial, and Modoc Cos.), Oregon (Crater Lake), Wyoming (Yellowstone
 Park), and Mexico (near Pachuca.)
 2624
 
 NAME: The name is dervied from the latin name for the mineral, [obsio.]
 
 LEGEND and LORE: Polished pieces of black Obsidian have been used for
 Scrying.  Primitive peoples once valued obsidian highly, chipping and
 flaking it into knives, spearheads, and many other implements with
 razor-sharp edges resulting from the intersecting conchoidal fractures.
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Obsidian is a very protective stone. It is also
 associated with the inner mysteries of the Goddess, symbolizing entrance
 to the labyrinth, the womb or the subconscious self.
 
 HEALING: Because of its protective qualities, Obsidian is a good stone
 for those who are soft-hearted and gentle. It will help to guard them
 against abuse. This stone cleanses toxins from the liver, so it is also
 good for people who are exposed to environmental pollutants.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: This is the "balance" stone for Clear Quartz
 Crystals. We jokingly refer to it around here as a "dark sucker"...mean-
 ing it will absorb all sorts of negative things. It is also a grounding
 stone, and I use it at the Base Chakra (below the feet) at the beginning
 of a layout to keep my client "grounded". In India, the women wear
 obsidian toe rings for the same purpose. I use Black Obsidian in
 conjunction with Quartz. If I'm not using Clear Quartz, I use Snowflake
 Obsidian. I also have a piece of Rainbow Obsidian, but it is relatively
 new and I haven't finished "conversing" with it, so I have no advice
 as to how to use it...at the moment.

             ----------------------------------------------
 OPAL
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Opal is hydrous silica, often with some iron and
 aluminum. Its chemistry is SiO2.nH2O; amount of water varies up to 10
 percent. It ranges in color from White, yellow, red, pink, brown to
 gray, blue and even colorless. It is most easily recognized by its rich
 internal play of colors (opalescence). Its hardness ranges from 5-1/2 to
 6-1/2. It is vitreous and pearly. The streak is white. It is not found
 in crystal form, rather is is usually massive, botryoidal, reniform,
 stalactitic, and/or earthy.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Opal is a low-temperature mineral and usually develops in
 a wide variety of rocks as cavity and fracture fillings. It requently
 develops as amygdules in basalt and rhyolite of volcanic rock and
 replaces the cells in wood and the shells of clams.
 2625
 
 OCCURENCE: Common opal is widespread and can be readily obtained at many
 places, but localities for precious opal are rare and seem to localized
 in W United States and Mexico. Magnificent examples of opalized wood can
 be found in Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, and lively
 green fluorescing opal (hyalite) occurs in seams in pegmatites in New
 England and North Carolina and in cavities in basalt near Klamath Falls,
 Oregon. Beautiful precious opal, as a replacement in wood, has been
 obtained in Virgin Valley, Humboldt Co., Nevada.  Excellent fire and
 precious opal occur in laval flows in N Mexico. Nevada, Australia, and
 Honduras are sources for black opal; Australia and Czechoslovakia
 for white opal; Mexico and SW United States for fire opal. 
 
 GEMSTONE INFORMATION: Black, dark blue, dark green opal with dark gray
 body color and fine play of colors is called [black opal;] opal with
 white or light body color and fine play of color is called [white opal;]
 and transparent to translucent opal with body color ranging from
 orange-yellow to red and a play of colors is called [fire opal.] Play of
 colors depends upon interference of light and is not dependent upon body
 color. Black opal is the most highly prized, and fire opal is the most
 valued of the orange and red varieties. Most opal is fashioned into
 cabochons, but some fire opals are faceted.
 
 NAME: The word is from the Sanskrit [upala,] meaning "precious stone."
 
 LEGEND and LORE: Opal is a birthstone for October.
 
     "October's child is born for woe,
     And life's vicissitudes must know;
     But lay an  Opal on her breast,
     And hope will lull those foes to rest." (5)
 
 Opals have traditionally been considered "lucky" stones...but only for
 those born in the month of October. It has been considered bad luck to
 wear them if you were born in any other month.
 
 MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Opal is considered to be able to confer the gift of
 invisibility on its wearer. To accomplish this, Cunningham says "The gem
 was wrapped in a fresh bay leaf and carried for this purpose." He also
 says, "Opals are also worn to bring out inner beauty. A beauty spell:
 Place a round mirror on the altar or behind it so that you can see your
 face within it while kneeling.  Place two green candles on eithe side of
 the mirror. Light the candles. Empower an opal with your need for beauty
 -- while holding the stone, gaze into your reflection. With the scalpel
 of your visualization, mold and form your face (and your body) to the
 form you desire. Then, carry or wear the opal and dedicate
 yourself to improving your appearance." (2)
 
 HEALING: Opals contain all the colors of the other stones, thus, it
 could be used in place of any of them. (They are akin to quartz
 crystals, in this aspect.) Generally speaking, Opal is used more
 frequently for healing the spirit, rather than the physical body.
 
 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: Opals are probably my favorite stone. This may be
 partially due to the fact that they are my birthstone, and I have been
 surrounded by them all of my life. For me, they are protective and
 invigorating. I normally use them during Journeying, and when doing
 "readings" for other...anything where I am using altered states of
 consciousness. I find that they help me to understand the symbols of my
 2626
 
 visions in a way that makes them meaningful for others.

 VESUVIANITE (IDOCRASE)
 
 SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Vesuvianite is composed of calcium, magnesium
 and aluminum silicate, often with some beryllium and fluorine. The
 chemistry is Ca10Mg2Al4(SiO4)5(Si2)7)2(OH)4. Specimens range from brown
 and green to a rare yellow or blue. The hardness is 6-1/2.
 
 ENVIRONMENT: Vesuvianite forms by igneous and metamorphic processes. It
 commonly is metamorphic and occurs with grossular, wollastonite, and
 calcite in hornfels of contact metamorphic rocks; with chromite and
 magnetite in serpentinite of hydrothermal metamorphic rocks; and with
 wollastonite, andradite, and diopside in carbonatites.
 
 OCCURENCE: Gem-quality Vesuvianite has been obtained from a pegmatite in
 marble near Sixteen Island Lake, Laurel, Argenteuil Co., Quebec, and
 beautiful micromount cyrstals of purplish-pink color occur in massive
 Vesuvianite at the Montral chrome pit at Black Lake, Megantic Co.,
 Quebec. The blue variety called [cyprine] has been obtained at Franklin,
 Sussex Co., New Jersey. Fine crystals up to 1-1/2 inches across occur in
 pale-blue calcite at Scratch Gravel, near Helena, Lewis and Clark Co.,
 Montana, and spectacular material of similar nature occurs at quarries
 near Riverside, California. Beautiful pale-green massive Vesuvianite
 ([californite]) occurs in California at Pulga, Butte Co.,
 and near Happy Camp, Siskiyou Co., and crude yellow prismatic crystals
 occur with grossular at Xalostoc, Morelos, and Lake Jaco, Chihuahua,
 Mexico.
 
 GEMSTONE INFORMATION: Translucent gray to green or nearly colorless
 Vesuvianite with green streaks is called [californite], and is often
 sold as "California Jade." Californite is fashioned into cabochons.
 Principal sources are the USSR, Italy, Canada and California.
 
 NAME: The name "Vesuvianite" is from the original locality at Mt.
 Vesuvius, Italy. The alternate name, "idocrase," comes from the Greek
 [eidos,] "form", and [krasis,] "mixture," because Vesuvianite may appear
 to combine the crystal forms of several other minerals.
