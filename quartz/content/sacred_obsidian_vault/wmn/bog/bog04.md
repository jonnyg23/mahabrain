 <p>The Goddess is one and multiform;<br> The Goddess has nine billion names;<br> And more;<br> Of her names only a few do we sing:</p>  <h3 align="center">I.</h3>  
 <p>Blessed be to the Goddess of Chaos, Eris inchoate,<br> First of all to emerge in the undifferentiated plenum<br> The splendid dancer on the interface<br> Of the macrocosm and the microcosm;<br> The Creatrix of all fractal dimensions;</p>  <h3 align="center">II.</h3>  
 <p>Blessed be the Sun, Amaterasu,<br> Creatrix of all solar planets;<br> She we greet at dawns' first breath;<br> She we hail at noon;<br> She we bid farewell at twilight;</p>  <h3 align="center">III.</h3>  
 <p>Blessed be broad-breasted Earth, Gaia;<br> The ever-bountiful planet of our birth;<br> From her core of fire<br> To the outer wisps of her Ionosphere;<br> She has birthed all evolved life;<br> She has suffered mass extinctions;<br> She has rebirthed species time and time again;<br> We shall not rest in our defense of her<br> Against the depredations of the patriarchs.</p>  <h3 align="center">IV.</h3>  
 <p>Blessed be Maria,<br> The Goddess of the Ocean;<br> Blue-mantled, foam crested;<br> She brings rains to the dry lands;<br> Her song is sung by the whales of the deep.<br> She nurtured life in its infancy;<br> As she watches over childbirth;</p>  <h3 align="center">V.</h3>  
 <p>Blessed be Maria's sister, Selene, the silent;<br> Our constant companion;<br> Goddess of the lunar cycle of the womb.<br> At the dark moon we watch for her expectantly;<br> At the new moon we hail her joyously;<br> At the full moon we make love and sing her praise;<br> At the waning moon we mourn and meditate.</p>  <h3 align="center">VI.</h3>  
 <p>Blessed be Aphrodite, Goddess of Love<br> Who we know also as Aphrodite,<br> Bringer of delights;<br> Joy which knows no boundaries;<br> Kindness which needs no recompense;<br> Lead us from jealousy which keeps us ever-reborn<br> And bestow on us the paradise of the Goddess<br> On Earth as it is on Heaven.</p>  <h3 align="center">VII.</h3>  
 <p>Blessed be Athena; Goddess of Wisdom;<br> She who taught us in the dawn time;<br> How to speak, create tools, use fire;<br> To till the land and tend it wisely;<br> We see far and go forth in her name.</p>  <h3 align="center">VIII.</h3>  
 <p>Blessed be Demeter,<br> Bringer of seasons and giver of good gifts,<br> We eat of your divine foods:<br> Grains, Fruits, Vegetables;<br> We praise your bounty at every meal;<br> You sustain our bodies and gladden our soul.</p>  <h3 align="center">IX.</h3>  
 <p>Blessed be Kali,<br> Goddess of the Underworld;<br> Skull-wreathed, terrible Goddess<br> Death, destroyer of Universes;<br> She who sits at the gate of rebirth;<br> She who weighs our heart in the scales;<br> If it weighs less than a pomegranate seed;<br> She will send you on to the summerland;<br> If it is heavier, you will wander in the Bardos;<br> To find rebirth and find love once more.</p>
