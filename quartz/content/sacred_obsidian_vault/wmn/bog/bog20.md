 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Book of the Goddess</i>, by Anna Livia Plurabelle, [© 2002 Anna Livia Plurabelle, All rights reserved], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h1 align="center">The Testament of Gaia</h1>  
 <p>And when she arose on that morning the Patriarchs seized her,<br> And bound her,<br> And broke her body on the wheel,<br> And accused her of witchcraft,<br> And stripped her of her clothes and her name:<br> "You will be called Gaia; she that has no name,"<br> Said the Patriarchs;<br> And they took her to the marketplace to be burned.</p>  
 <p>Then, at that hour of Gaias' death,<br> The Sun and the Moon stood still in the Heaven;<br> And a glory shrouded the body of Gaia;<br> And Gaia spoke:</p>  
 <p>I have become Gaia, beloved of the Goddess,<br> Creatrix and Destroyer of Worlds;<br> And this is my testament.</p>  
 <p>Blessed are the generous in love: for theirs is the Love of the Goddess.<br> Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.<br> Blessed are the poor: for they shall inherit the Earth.<br> Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after the knowledge: for they shall be enlightened.<br> Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.<br> Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall be loved by the Goddess.<br> Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the avatars of the Goddess.<br> Blessed are they who are persecuted: for theirs will be the Goddesses' justice.<br> Blessed are you of the Goddess when the ignorant shall revile you,<br> And persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for the Goddesses sake.</p>  
 <p>I, the Creatrix, speak through my beloved Gaia to those who come after:<br> "Rejoice, I say, and be exceeding glad: for I will take you into My arms:<br> For the Patriarchs burned and persecuted the Witches who came before you:<br> And these I gathered to My arms and freed from the cycle of rebirth."</p>  
 <p>Women are the salt of the earth: but if the salt has lost its taste,<br> What with shall our food be salted?<br> It is thenceforth good for nothing,<br> But to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot;<br> The Patriarchs would wish women to be invisible.<br> But in women are the light of the world.<br> A tree that grows on a hill cannot be hid.<br> Neither do women light a hearth fire, and hide it;<br> As it gives light to all that are in the house.<br> Let your light so shine before humanity,<br> That they may see your good works, and glorify your Queen, the Goddess.</p>  
 <p>Think not that She has returned to destroy other religions,<br> She comes not to destroy, but to fulfil.<br> For truly I say to you, till the death of the Sun,<br> Nothing will be taken from the other religions of the Earth,<br> Till the good in all of them be fulfilled.</p>  
 <p>You have heard that it was said of them of old time,<br> Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:<br> But I say to you, that whosoever take away<br> A woman's right to control her own body,<br> And her reproductive system, in the name of holy life,<br> Shall be in danger of the anger of the Goddess.<br> They themselves have scorned life and serve death;<br> They will be doomed to infinite reincarnation.</p>  
 <p>Of old it was said: Thou shalt not commit adultery:<br> But I say to you,<br> That whosoever nurtures jealousy will be scorned by the Goddess.<br> And each of the lovers that you embrace is likewise beloved of the Goddess.</p>  
 <p>You have heard it said that it is unholy for woman to lay with woman,<br> Or man to lay with man,<br> But I say to you that the Goddesses' love knows no gender.</p>  
 <p>You have heard that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:<br> But I say to you, resist chaos with all of the passion of the Goddess:<br> Create peace in the sacred places of the Earth;<br> Revenge begats revenge; whosoever <i>breaks</i> the cycle of revenge is beloved of the Goddess.<br> Find common ground with your adversary quickly,<br> For whosoever shall create consensus is the beloved of the Goddess.</p>  
 <p>You have heard that it was said by them of old time,<br> Whosoever shall hit you on your right cheek in anger, turn to her the other also.<br> And if any will sue thee at the law, and take away your coat, let her have your cloak also.<br> And whosoever shall force thee to walk a kilometer, walk with her two kilometers.<br> Give to she that ask you, and from her that would borrow of you turn not you away.<br> And be not afraid of those who persecute you;<br> For if you return injury with kindness they will be shamed;<br> This is the right thing to do.</p>  
 <p>You have heard that it has been said,<br> You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.<br> But I say to you,<br> Love your enemies,<br> Speak truth to the liars,<br> Bless them that curse you,<br> Do good to them that hate you,<br> This is what they least wish you to do;<br> In this way you will overcome all oppression.</p>  
 <p>Forgive those who abuse you, <br> For you are the daughter of your Mother who created the universe:<br> For She is the Sun who rises over the evil and the good,<br> The Moon that shines on the ocean and the mountains,<br> She sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</p>  
 <p>Love those who love you, but what is exceptional about that?<br> Be you therefore not jealous, even as your Creatrix is not jealous;<br> This <i>is</i> exceptional.<br> Rebirth after rebirth, Her children suffer;<br> This ring of suffering is sundered if you can extinguish jealousy in your heart;<br> This is the noble truth of the Goddess;<br> It is as light as a feather, but as difficult to lift as a mountain.</p>  
 <p>By not seeing the noble truth of the Goddess,<br> Long is the path that is traversed through many a birth;<br> When this is grasped, the cause of rebirth is then removed,<br> The root of sorrow rooted out, and there is no more rebirth.</p>  
 <p>Live simply on the Earth and do not compel others to worship the Goddess;<br> For all will find their own path to Her Grove;<br> There are many paths to the Grove of the Goddess.</p>  
 <p>This is the supreme Invocation of the One Goddess:</p>  
 <p><i>Our Mother, creator of heaven;<br> Blessed be your name.<br> Your springtime come,<br> Your singtime sung,<br> On Earth, as it is in Heaven.<br> "Do what you love, shall be the whole of the law,<br> And harm no one, lest ye be harmed threefold;"<br> And lead us to knowledge, and deliver us from jealousy:<br> For yours is the wisdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.<br> Blessed be. Blessed be. Blessed be</i>.</p>  
 <p>If you forgive the hateful their trespasses,<br> Your Mother will also forgive you:<br> But if you forgive not the hateful their trespasses,<br> Neither will your Mother forgive your trespasses.</p>  
 <p>When you fast, be not hungry;<br> When you meditate on the Goddess, be not distracted;<br> For in her name is perfection;<br> And in her name is satisfaction.</p>  
 <p>If you hoard for yourselves treasures upon earth,<br> Moth and rust will corrupt, and thieves break through and steal:<br> But accumulate for yourselves wisdom and kindness,<br> Which neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,<br> And which thieves do not break through nor steal:<br> Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>  
 <p>The light of the body is your heart chakra:<br> If therefore your heart chakra radiate light,<br> Your whole body shall be full of light.<br> But if your heart be evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness.<br> If therefore the light that is in you be darkness, how great is that darkness!</p>  
 <p>Therefore I say to you,<br> Love yourself, even as you are today;<br> Love what you eat, and drink; and your body,<br> And what you adorn yourself with.<br> But be aware that life is more than food, and the body more than raiment.<br> Behold the birds of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap,<br> Nor save up food; yet your heavenly Mother feeds them.<br> Are you any better than they?<br> Which of you by thinking can add one centimeter to her stature?<br> And why be concerned about your clothing?<br> Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:<br> And yet I say to you, that their clothing is more glorious than the finest couture.<br> Wherefore, if Goddess so clothe the grain of the field,<br> Which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall she not much more clothe you,<br> O you of little faith?<br> Therefore in your heart do not worry about<br> What shall we eat? or,<br> What shall we drink? or,<br> Wherewithal shall we be clothed?<br> For your Mother the Goddess knows that you have need of all these things.<br> But seek you first the Path of the Goddess, and Her love;<br> And all these things shall be provided for you;<br> For the Goddess loves things of beauty and gracefulness.<br> Take therefore no thought for tomorrow:<br> For tomorrow shall take care of itself.<br> Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof.</p>  
 <p>Judge not, lest you be not judged.<br> For with what judgment you judge,<br> You shall be judged:<i><br> </i>Why criticize the splinter that is in your sister's eye,<br> But consider not the log that is in your own eye?<br> Or how wilt thou say to your sister,<br> "Let me pull out the splinter out of your eye;"<br> And, behold, a log is in your own eye?<br> Oh hypocrite, first cast out the splinter out of your own eye;<br> And then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the log out of your sister's eye.<br> Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine,<br> Lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</p>  
 <p>Ask, and it shall be given you;<br> Seek, and you shall find;<br> Knock, and it shall be opened to you:<br> For every one that asks receives;<br> And she that seeks finds;<br> And to her that knocks the door shall be opened.<br> Enter you in at the narrow gate:<br> For <i>wide</i> open is the gate,<br> And straight is the way, that leads to ignorance,<br> And many there be which go in thereat:<br> But narrow is the gate, and labyrinthine is the path<br> Which leads to the Goddess, and few there be that find it.</p>  
 <p>Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing,<br> But inwardly they are ravening wolves.<br> Ye shall know them by their fruits.<br> Do we harvest grapes from thorn-bushes, or figs from thistles?<br> Even so every good tree bring forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bring forth evil fruit.<br> A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.<br> Every tree that bring not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.<br> Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.<br> In quiet the voice of the Goddess is best heard;<br> Those who say do not know and those who know do not say;<br> Not every one that says to me, Goddess, Goddess, Goddess,<br> Shall enter into the Grove; but only she that does the will of my Mother.</p>  
 <p>Many will say to me in that day,<br> Goddess, Goddess, Goddess, have we not prophesied in your name?<br> And in your name have cast out evil?<br> And in your name done many wonderful works?<br> And then will I profess to them, I never knew you:<br> You have deceived many and enlightened none;<br> Depart from me, you that work iniquity.</p>  
 <p>Therefore whosoever hear these sayings of mine, and do them,<br> I will liken her to a wise woman, which built her house upon a solid foundation.<br> And then the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew,<br> And beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was built upon bedrock.<br> And every one that hear these sayings of mine, and do them not,<br> Shall be likened to a foolish woman, which built her house upon a beach<br> And the rain descended, and the waves came, and the winds blew,<br> And beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</p>  
 <p>At that moment the Sun set and the full Moon rose;<br> And silence fell on the marketplace;<br> Gaia was consumed by the flames;<br> She died at the hands of the patriarchs;<br> May the burning times not come again;<br> May we be blessed by Her tolerance and wisdom.</p>
