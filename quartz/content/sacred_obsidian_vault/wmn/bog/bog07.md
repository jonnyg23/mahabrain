 <p>Remember now your Creatrix in the days of your youth,<br> While the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh,<br> When thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; <br> While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened,<br> Nor the clouds return after the rain: In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,<br> Vanity of vanities, said the Goddess, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.<br> What profit has one of all her labor which they take under the sun?<br> One generation passes away, and another generation comes:<br> But the Earth abides for ever.<br> The sun also arises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where She arose.<br> The wind goes toward the south, and turns about to the north;<br> It whirls about continually, and the wind returns again according to Her circuits.<br> All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full;<br> Unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.<br> All things are full of labor; none cannot utter it:<br> The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.<br> The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be;<br> And that which is done is that which shall be done:<br> And there is no new thing under the sun.<br> Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?<br> It has been already in the depths of time, which was before us.<br> There is no remembrance of former things;<br> Neither shall there be any remembrance of things<br> That are to come with those that shall come after.<br> To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:<br> A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;<br> A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;<br> A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; <br> A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;<br> A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;<br> A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;<br> A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;<br> A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.<br> What profit hath they that work in that wherein they labor?<br> I have seen the travail, which the Goddess hath given<br> To the daughters of women to be exercised in it.<br> She has made every thing beautiful in her time:<br> Also she has set the world in their heart,<br> So that nobody can find out the work that the Goddess created from the beginning to the end.<br> I know that there is no good in them, but for a woman to rejoice, and to do good in her life.<br> And also that every woman should eat and drink,<br> And enjoy the good of all her labor, it is the gift of the Goddess.<br> Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor.<br> For if they fall, the one will lift up her lover:<br> And three are better than two, for three shall make the circle complete.<br> But woe to her that is alone when she falls; for she hath not another to help her up.<br> Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?<br> And if one prevail against her, two shall withstand her;<br> And a threefold cord is not quickly broken.<br> And when three lie together, there is no harm and much joy;<br> Go your way, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart;<br> For the Goddess now accepts your love.<br> Live joyfully with the lovers who you love<br> All the days of your life which She hath given you under the sun,<br> All the days of your life: for that is your portion in this life,<br> And in your labor which thou take under the sun.<br> Whatsoever your hand find to do, do it with your might;<br> For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge,<br> Nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou go<br> I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift,<br> Nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise,<br> Nor yet riches to those of understanding,<br> Nor yet favor to women of skill; but time and chance happen to them all.<br> Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength:<br> Nevertheless the poor woman's wisdom is despised, and her words are not heard.<br> The words of wise women are heard in quiet more than the cry of she that rules among fools.<br> Wisdom is better than weapons of war: and hatred much good.<br> If the spirit of the ruler rise up against you, leave not your place;<br> For yielding pacifies great offences.<br> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceeds from the ruler:<br> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low places.<br> Cast your bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.<br> Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for you know not what evil shall be upon the earth.<br> If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth:<br> And if the tree fall toward the south,<br> Or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it shall be.<br> She that observes the wind shall not sow; and she that regards the clouds shall not reap.<br> While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened,<br> Nor the clouds return after the rain:<br> In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,<br> Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to Goddess who gave it.<br> Vanity of vanities, said the Goddess; all is vanity.</p>
