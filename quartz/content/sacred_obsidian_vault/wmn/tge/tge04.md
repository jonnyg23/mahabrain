   <h1 align="center">THE REVELATION OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE,</h1>  <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXI.</h3>  
 <p>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.</p>  
 <p>2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</p>  
 <p>3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God <i>is</i> with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them <i>and be</i> their God.</p>  
 <p>4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a></p>  
 <p>5 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write; for these words are true and faithful.</p>  
 <p>6 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.</p>  
 <p>7 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.</p>  
 <p>8 But the fearful and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolators, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.</p>  
 <p>9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.</p>  
 <p>10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.</p>  
 <p>11 Having the glory of God: and her light <i>was</i> like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;</p>  
 <p>12 And had a wall great and high, <i>and</i> had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are <i>the names</i> of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:</p>  
 <p>13 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.</p>  
 <p>14 And the wall of that city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p>  
 <p>15 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.</p>  
 <p>16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</p>  
 <p>17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty <i>and</i> four cubits, <i>according to</i> the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.</p>  
 <p>18 And the building of the wall of it was <i>of</i> jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.</p>  
 <p>19 And the foundation of the wall of the city <i>were</i> garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was</p>  
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a></p>  
 <p>jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald.</p>  
 <p>20 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eight, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.</p>  
 <p>21 And the twelve gates <i>were</i> twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city <i>was</i> pure gold, as it were transparent glass.</p>  
 <p>22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.</p>  
 <p>23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</p>  
 <p>24 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.</p>  
 <p>25 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.</p>  
 <p>26 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.</p>  
 <p>27 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither <i>whatsoever</i> worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.</p>  <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXII.</h3>  
 <p>And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</p>  
 <p>2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, <i>was there</i> the tree of life, which bare twelve <i>manner of</i> fruits, <i>and</i> yielded her the fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree <i>were</i> for the healing of the nations.</p>  
 <p>3 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve them:</p>  
 <p>4 And they shall see his face: and his name <i>shall</i> be in their foreheads.</p>  
 <p>5 And there shall be no light there; and they need no candle neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.</p>  
 <p>6 And he said unto me, These sayings <i>are</i> faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 55</font></a></p>  
 <p>7 Behold I come quickly: blessed <i>is</i> he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.</p>  
 <p>8 And I John saw these things, and heard <i>them</i>. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things.</p>  
 <p>9 Then saith he unto me, See <i>thou do it</i> not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.</p>  
 <p>10 And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.</p>  
 <p>11 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy let him be filthy still: and he is that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.</p>  
 <p>12 And, behold I come quickly; and my reward <i>is</i> with me to give every man according as his work shall be.</p>  
 <p>13 1 am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.</p>  
 <p>14 Blessed <i>are</i> they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates in the city.</p>  
 <p>15 For without <i>are</i> dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.</p>  
 <p>16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, <i>and</i> the bright and morning star.</p>  
 <p>17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.</p>  
 <p>18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.</p>  
 <p>19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and <i>from</i> the things which are written in this book.</p>  
 <p>20 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.</p>  
 <p>21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>

 <p>India, according to the Vedas, entertained a respect for woman amounting almost to worship.</p>  <h3 align="center">MAXIMS FROM THE SACRED BOOKS OF INDIA.</h3>  
 <p>"He who despises woman despises his mother."</p>  
 <p>"Who is cursed by a woman is cursed by God."</p>  
 <p>"The tears of a woman call down the fire of Heaven on those who make them flow."</p>  
 <p>"Evil to him who laughs at woman's sufferings: God shall laugh at his prayers."</p>  
 <p>"It was at the prayer of a woman that the Creator pardoned Man: cursed be he who forgets it."</p>

 <p>"When women are honoured the Divinities are content; but when they are not honoured all undertakings fail."</p>  
 <p>"The households cursed by women to whom they have not rendered the homage due them find themselves weighed down with ruin, and destroyed, as if they had been struck by some secret power."</p>

 <p>Let us repeat that story from Sufi: "There was a man, who for seven years, did every act of charity, and at the end of seven years he mounted the steps to the gate of Heaven and knocked. A voice cried, 'Who is there'?' 'Thy servant, O Lord,' and the gate was shut. Seven other years he did every other good work, and again mounted the three steps to Heaven and knocked. The voice cried, 'Who is there I?' He answered, 'Thy slave, O God,' and the gates were shut. Seven other years he did every good deed and again mounted the steps, to Heaven, and the voice said, 'Who is there?' He replied, 'Thyself, O God,' and the gates wide open flew."</p>  
 <p>And why?</p>  
 <p>Because, as the scripture saith,--"<i>The good that is done in the earth, Thou, Lord, doest it</i>."</p>    </body>
