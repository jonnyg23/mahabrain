 <p>The Texas statutes that concern us here are Arts. 1191-1194 and 1196 of the State's Penal Code. <a href="rvw13.htm#xref_1"><font color="GREEN" size="1">1</font></a> These make it a crime to "procure an abortion," as therein [410 U.S. 113, 118] defined, or to attempt one, except with respect to "an abortion procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother." Similar statutes are in existence in a majority of the States. <a href="rvw13.htm#xref_2"><font color="GREEN" size="1">2</font></a> [410 U.S. 113, 119]</p>  
 <p>Texas first enacted a criminal abortion statute in 1854. Texas Laws 1854, c. 49, 1, set forth in  <a href="rvw13.htm#xref_3"><font color="GREEN" size="1">3</font></a> H. Gammel, Laws of Texas 1502 (1898). This was soon modified into language that has remained substantially unchanged to the present time. See Texas Penal Code of 1857, c. 7, Arts. 531-536; G. Paschal, Laws of Texas, Arts. 2192-2197 (1866); Texas Rev. Stat., c. 8, Arts. 536-541 (1879); Texas Rev. Crim. Stat., Arts. 1071-1076 (1911). The final article in each of these compilations provided the same exception, as does the present Article 1196, for an abortion by "medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother."  <a href="rvw13.htm#xref_3"><font color="GREEN" size="1">3</font></a> [410 U.S. 113, 120]</p>
