 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p1"></a>The <a name="an_iii.i-p1.1"></a>most highly developed branches of the human family have in common one  peculiar characteristic. They tend to produce—sporadically it is  true, and often in the teeth of adverse external circumstances—a  curious and definite type of personality; a type which refuses to be  satisfied with that which other men call experience, and is inclined,  in the words of its enemies, to “deny the world in order that it  may find reality.” We meet these persons in the east and the  west; in the ancient, mediaeval, and modern worlds. Their one passion  appears to be the prosecution of a certain spiritual and intangible  quest: the finding of a “way out” or a “way  back” to some desirable state in which alone they can satisfy  their craving for absolute truth. This quest, for them, has  constituted the whole meaning of life. They have made for it without  effort sacrifices which have appeared enormous to other men: and it is  an indirect testimony to its objective actuality, that whatever the  place or period in which they have arisen, their aims, doctrines and  methods have been substantially the same. Their experience, therefore,  forms a body of evidence, curiously self-consistent and often mutually  explanatory, which must be taken into account before we can add up the  sum of the energies and potentialities of the human spirit, or  reasonably speculate on its relations to the unknown world which lies  outside the boundaries of sense.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p2"></a>All men, at one time or another, have fallen in love  with the veiled Isis whom they call Truth. With most, this has been a  passing passion: they have early seen its hopelessness and turned to  more practical things. But others remain all their lives the devout  lovers of reality: though the manner of their love, the <a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="green">p. 4</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_4"></a> vision which they make to themselves of the  beloved object varies enormously. Some see Truth as Dante saw  Beatrice: an adorable yet intangible figure, found in this world yet  revealing the next. To others she seems rather an evil but an  irresistible enchantress: enticing, demanding payment and betraying  her lover at the last. Some have seen her in a test tube, and some in  a poet’s dream: some before the altar, others in the slime. The  extreme pragmatists have even sought her in the kitchen; declaring  that she may best be recognized by her utility. Last stage of all, the  philosophic sceptic has comforted an unsuccessful courtship by  assuring himself that his mistress is not really there.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p3"></a>Under whatsoever symbols they have objectified their  quest, none of these seekers have ever been able to assure the world  that they have found, seen face to face, the Reality behind the veil.  But if we may trust the reports of the mystics—and they are  reports given with a strange accent of certainty and good  faith—they have succeeded where all these others have failed, in  establishing immediate communication between the spirit of man,  entangled as they declare amongst material things, and that  “only Reality,” that immaterial and final Being, which  some philosophers call the Absolute, and most theologians call God.  This, they say—and here many who are not mystics agree with  them—is the hidden Truth which is the object of man’s  craving; the only satisfying goal of his quest. Hence, they should  claim from us the same attention that we give to other explorers of  countries in which we are not competent to adventure ourselves; for  the mystics are the pioneers of the spiritual world, and we have no  right to deny validity to their discoveries, merely because we lack  the opportunity or the courage necessary to those who would prosecute  such explorations for themselves.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p4"></a>It is the object of this book to attempt a  description, and also—though this is needless for those who read  that description in good faith—a justification of these  experiences and the conclusions which have been drawn from them. So  remote, however, are these matters from our ordinary habits of  thought, that their investigation entails, in those who would attempt  to understand them, a definite preparation: a purging of the  intellect. As with those who came of old to the Mysteries,  purification is here the gate of knowledge. We must come to this  encounter with minds cleared of prejudice and convention, must  deliberately break with our inveterate habit of taking the  “visible world” for granted; our lazy assumption that  somehow science is “real” and metaphysics is not. We must  pull down our own card houses—descend, as the mystics say,  “into our nothingness”—and examine for ourselves the  foundations of all possible human experience, <a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_5"></a> before we are in a position to criticize the  buildings of the visionaries, the poets, and the saints. We must not  begin to talk of the unreal world of these dreamers until we have  discovered—if we can—a real world with which it may be  compared.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p5"></a>Such a criticism of reality is of course the business  of philosophy. I need hardly say that this book is not written by a  philosopher, nor is it addressed to students of that imperial science.  Nevertheless, amateurs though we be, we cannot reach our  starting-point without trespassing to some extent on philosophic  ground. That ground covers the whole area of first principles: and it  is to first principles that we must go, if we would understand the  true significance of the mystic type.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p6"></a>Let us then begin at the beginning: and remind  ourselves of a few of the trite and primary facts which all practical  persons agree to ignore. That beginning, for human thought, is of  course the I, the Ego, the self-conscious subject which is writing  this book, or the other self-conscious subject which is reading it;  and which declares, in the teeth of all arguments, I AM.   <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a>
     Here is a point as to which we all feel quite sure. No metaphysician  has yet shaken the ordinary individual’s belief in his own  existence. The uncertainties only begin for most of us when we ask  what else   <i>is</i>   .</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p8"></a>To this I, this conscious self “imprisoned in  the body like an oyster in his shell,”   <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">2</font></a>
     come, as we know, a constant stream of messages and experiences.  Chief amongst these are the stimulation of the tactile nerves whose  result we call touch, the vibrations taken up by the optic nerve which  we call light, and those taken up by the ear and perceived as  sound.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p10"></a>What do these experiences mean? The first answer of  the unsophisticated Self is, that they indicate the nature of the  external world: it is to the “evidence of her senses” that  she turns, when she is asked what the world is like. From the messages  received through those senses, which pour in on her whether she will  or no, battering upon her gateways at every instant and from every  side, she constructs that “sense-world” which is the  “real and solid world” of normal men. As the impressions  come in—or rather those interpretations of the original  impressions which her nervous system supplies—she pounces on  them, much as players in the spelling game pounce on the separate  letters dealt <a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_6"></a> out to them. She sorts,  accepts, rejects, combines: and then triumphantly produces from them a  “concept” which   <i>is,</i>    she says, the external world. With an enviable and amazing simplicity  she attributes her own sensations to the unknown universe. The stars,  she says,   <i>are</i>    bright; the grass   <i>is</i>    green. For her, as for the philosopher Hume, “reality consists  in impressions and ideas.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p11"></a>It is immediately apparent, however, that this  sense-world, this seemingly real external universe—though it may  be useful and valid in other respects—cannot be   <i>the</i>    external world, but only the Self’s projected picture of it.   <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">3</font></a>
     It is a work of art, not a scientific fact; and, whilst it may well  possess the profound significance proper to great works of art, is  dangerous if treated as a subject of analysis. Very slight  investigation shows that it is a picture whose relation to reality is  at best symbolic and approximate, and which would have no meaning for  selves whose senses, or channels of communication, happened to be  arranged upon a different plan. The evidence of the senses, then,  cannot be accepted as evidence of the nature of ultimate reality:  useful servants, they are dangerous guides. Nor can their testimony  disconcert those seekers whose reports they appear to contradict.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p13"></a>The conscious self sits, so to speak, at the receiving  end of a telegraph wire. On any other theory than that of mysticism,  it is her one channel of communication with the hypothetical  “external world.” The receiving instrument registers  certain messages. She does not know, and—so long as she remains  dependent on that instrument—never can know, the object, the  reality at the other end of the wire, by which those messages are  sent; neither can the messages truly disclose the nature of that  object. But she is justified on the whole in accepting them as  evidence that something exists beyond herself and her receiving  instrument. It is obvious that the structural peculiarities of the  telegraphic instrument will have exerted a modifying effect upon the  message. That which is conveyed as dash and dot, colour and shape, may  have been received in a very different form. Therefore this message,  though it may in a partial sense be relevant to the supposed reality  at the other end, can never be adequate to it. There will be fine  vibrations which it fails to take up, others which it confuses  together. Hence a portion of the message is always lost; or, in <a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_7"></a> other language, there are aspects of the world  which we can never know.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p14"></a>The sphere of our possible intellectual knowledge is  thus strictly conditioned by the limits of our own personality. On  this basis, not the ends of the earth, but the external termini of our  own sensory nerves, are the termini of our explorations: and to  “know oneself” is really to know one’s universe. We  are locked up with our receiving instruments: we cannot get up and  walk away in the hope of seeing whither the lines lead.  Eckhart’s words are still final for us: “the soul can only  approach created things by the voluntary reception of images.”  Did some mischievous Demiurge choose to tickle our sensory apparatus  in a new way, we should receive by this act a new universe.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p15"></a>William James once suggested as a useful exercise for  young idealists, a consideration of the changes which would be worked  in our ordinary world if the various branches of our receiving  instruments exchanged duties; if, for instance, we heard all colours  and saw all sounds. Such a remark throws a sudden light on the strange  and apparently insane statement of the visionary Saint-Martin,  “I heard flowers that sounded, and saw notes that shone”;  and on the reports of other mystics concerning a rare moment of  consciousness in which the senses are fused into a single and  ineffable act of perception, and colour and sound are known as aspects  of one thing.   <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">4</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p17"></a>Since music is but an interpretation of certain  vibrations undertaken by the ear, and colour an interpretation of  other vibrations performed by the eye, this is less mad than it sounds  and may yet be brought within the radius of physical science. Did such  an alteration of our senses take place the world would still send us  the same messages—that strange unknown world from which, on this  hypothesis, we are hermetically sealed—but we should interpret  them differently. Beauty would still be ours, though speaking another  tongue. The bird’s song would then strike our retina as a  pageant of colour: we should see the magical tones of the wind, hear  as a great fugue the repeated and harmonized greens of the forest, the  cadences of stormy skies. Did we realize how slight an adjustment of  our organs is needed to initiate us into such a world, we should  perhaps be less contemptuous of those mystics who tell us that they  apprehended the Absolute as “heavenly music” or  “Uncreated Light”: less fanatical in our determination to  make the solid “world of common sense” the only standard  of reality. This “world of common sense” is a conceptual  <a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_8"></a> world. It may represent an external  universe: it certainly does represent the activity of the human mind.  Within that mind it is built up: and there most of us are content  “at ease for aye to dwell,” like the soul in the Palace of  Art.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p18"></a>A direct encounter with absolute truth, then, appears  to be impossible for normal non-mystical consciousness. We cannot know  the reality, or even prove the existence, of the simplest object:  though this is a limitation which few people realize acutely and most  would deny. But there persists in the race a type of personality which  does realize this limitation: and cannot be content with the sham  realities that furnish the universe of normal men. It is necessary, as  it seems, to the comfort of persons of this type to form for  themselves some image of the Something or Nothing which is at the end  of their telegraph lines: some “conception of being,” some  “theory of knowledge.” They are tormented by the  Unknowable, ache for first principles, demand some background to the  shadow show of things. In so far as man possesses this temperament, he  hungers for reality, and must satisfy that hunger as best he can:  staving off starvation, though he many not be filled.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p19"></a>It is doubtful whether any two selves have offered  themselves exactly the same image of the truth outside their gates:  for a living metaphysic, like a living religion, is at bottom a  strictly personal affair—a matter, as William James reminded us,  of vision rather than of argument.   <a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#fn_4"><font size="1">5</font></a>
     Nevertheless such a living metaphysic may—and if sound  generally does—escape the stigma of subjectivism by outwardly  attaching itself to a traditional School; as personal religion may and  should outwardly attach itself to a traditional church. Let us then  consider shortly the results arrived at by these traditional  schools—the great classic theories concerning the nature of  reality. In them we see crystallized the best that the human  intellect, left to itself, has been able to achieve.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p21"></a>I. The most obvious and generally accepted explanation  of the world is of course that of   <i>Naturalism,</i>    or naive Realism: the point of view of the plain man. Naturalism  states simply that we see the real world, though we may not see it  very well. What seems to normal healthy people to be there, is  approximately there. It congratulates itself on resting in the  concrete; it accepts material things as real. In other words, our  corrected and correlated sense impressions, raised to their highest  point of efficiency, form for it the only valid material of knowledge:  knowledge itself being the classified results of exact  observation.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p22"></a>Such an attitude as this may be a counsel of prudence,  in view of our ignorance of all that lies beyond: but it can never  satisfy <a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_9"></a> our hunger for reality. It says  in effect, “The room in which we find ourselves is fairly  comfortable. Draw the curtains, for the night is dark: and let us  devote ourselves to describing the furniture.” Unfortunately,  however, even the furniture refuses to accommodate itself to the  naturalistic view of things. Once we begin to examine it attentively,  we find that it abounds in hints of wonder and mystery: declares aloud  that even chairs and tables are not what they seem.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p23"></a>We have seen that the most elementary criticism,  applied to any ordinary object of perception, tends to invalidate the  simple and comfortable creed of “common sense”; that not  merely faith but gross credulity, is needed by the mind which would  accept the apparent as the real. I say, for instance, that I  “see” a house. I can only mean by this that the part of my  receiving instrument which undertakes the duty called vision is  affected in a certain way, and arouses in my mind the idea  “house.” The idea “house” is now treated by me  as a real house, and my further observations will be an unfolding,  enriching, and defining of this image. But what the external reality  is which evoked the image that I call “house,” I do not  know and never can know. It is as mysterious, as far beyond my  apprehension, as the constitution of the angelic choirs. Consciousness  shrinks in terror from contact with the mighty verb “to  be.” I may of course call in one sense to  “corroborate,” as we trustfully say, the evidence of the  other; may approach the house, and touch it. Then the nerves of my  hand will be affected by a sensation which I translate as hardness and  solidity; the eye by a peculiar and wholly incomprehensible sensation  called redness; and from these purely personal changes my mind  constructs and externalizes an idea which it calls red bricks. Science  herself, however, if she be asked to verify the reality of these  perceptions, at once declares that though the material world be real,  the ideas of solidity and colour are but hallucination. They belong to  the human animal, not to the physical universe: pertain to accident  not substance, as scholastic philosophy would say.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p24"></a>“The red brick,” says Science, “is a  mere convention. In reality that bit, like all other bits of the  universe, consists, so far as I know at present, of innumerable atoms  whirling and dancing one about the other. It is no more solid than a  snowstorm. Were you to eat of Alice-in-Wonderland’s mushroom and  shrink to the dimensions of the infra-world, each atom with its  electrons might seem to you a solar system and the red brick itself a  universe. Moreover, these atoms themselves elude me as I try to grasp  them. They are only manifestations of something else. Could I track  matter to its lair, I might conceivably discover that it has no  extension, and become an idealist in spite of myself. As for redness,  as you <a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_10"></a> call it, that is a question of  the relation between your optic nerve and the light waves which it is  unable to absorb. This evening, when the sun slopes, your brick will  probably be purple, a very little deviation from normal vision on your  part would make it green. Even the sense that the object of perception  is outside yourself may be fancy; since you as easily attribute this  external quality to images seen in dreams, and to waking  hallucinations, as you do to those objects which, as you absurdly say,  are   <i>‘really there.’”</i> </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p25"></a>Further, there is no trustworthy standard by which we  can separate the “real” from the “unreal”  aspects of phenomena. Such standards as exist are conventional: and  correspond to convenience, not to truth. It is no argument to say that  most men see the world in much the same way, and that this  “way” is the true standard of reality: though for  practical purposes we have agreed that sanity consists in sharing the  hallucinations of our neighbours. Those who are honest with themselves  know that this “sharing” is at best incomplete. By the  voluntary adoption of a new conception of the universe, the fitting of  a new alphabet to the old Morse code—a proceeding which we call  the acquirement of knowledge—we can and do change to a marked  extent our way of seeing things: building up new worlds from old sense  impressions, and transmuting objects more easily and thoroughly than  any magician. “Eyes and ears,” said Heracleitus,  “are bad witnesses to those who have barbarian souls”: and  even those whose souls are civilized tend to see and hear all things  through a temperament. In one and the same sky the poet may discover  the habitation of angels, whilst the sailor sees only a promise of  dirty weather ahead. Hence, artist and surgeon, Christian and  rationalist, pessimist and optimist, do actually and truly live in  different and mutually exclusive worlds, not only of thought but also  of perception. Only the happy circumstance that our ordinary speech is  conventional, not realistic, permits us to conceal from one another  the unique and lonely world in which each lives. Now and then an  artist is born, terribly articulate, foolishly truthful, who insists  on “Speaking as he saw.” Then other men, lapped warmly in  their artificial universe, agree that he is mad: or, at the very best,  an “extraordinarily imaginative fellow.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p26"></a>Moreover, even this unique world of the individual is  not permanent. Each of us, as we grow and change, works incessantly  and involuntarily at the re-making of our sensual universe. We behold  at any specific moment not “that which is,” but  “that which we are”, and personality undergoes many  readjustments in the course of its passage from birth through maturity  to death. The <a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_11"></a> mind which seeks the Real,  then, in this shifting and subjective “natural” world is  of necessity thrown back on itself: on images and concepts which owe  more to the “seer” than to the “seen.” But  Reality must be real for all, once they have found it: must exist  “in itself” upon a plane of being unconditioned by the  perceiving mind. Only thus can it satisfy that mind’s most vital  instinct, most sacred passion—its “instinct for the  Absolute,” its passion for truth.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p27"></a>You are not asked, as a result of these antique and  elementary propositions, to wipe clean the slate of normal human  experience, and cast in your lot with intellectual nihilism. You are  only asked to acknowledge that it is but a slate, and that the white  scratches upon it which the ordinary man calls facts, and the  Scientific Realist calls knowledge, are at best relative and  conventionalized symbols of that aspect of the unknowable reality at  which they hint. This being so, whilst we must all draw a picture of  some kind on our slate and act in relation therewith, we cannot deny  the validity—though we may deny the usefulness—of the  pictures which others produce, however abnormal and impossible they  may seem; since these are sketching an aspect of reality which has not  come within our sensual field, and so does not and cannot form part of  our world. Yet as the theologian claims that the doctrine of the  Trinity veils and reveals not Three but One, so the varied aspects  under which the universe appears to the perceiving consciousness hint  at a final reality, or in Kantian language, a Transcendental Object,  which shall be, not any one, yet all of its manifestations;  transcending yet including the innumerable fragmentary worlds of  individual conception. We begin, then, to ask what can be the nature  of this One; and whence comes the persistent instinct  which—receiving no encouragement from sense  experience—apprehends and desires this unknown unity, this  all-inclusive Absolute, as the only possible satisfaction of its  thirst for truth.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p28"></a>2. The second great conception of Being—  <i>Idealism—</i>   has arrived by a process of elimination at a tentative answer to this  question. It whisks us far from the material universe, with its  interesting array of “things,” its machinery, its law,  into the pure, if thin, air of a metaphysical world. Whilst the  naturalist’s world is constructed from an observation of the  evidence offered by the senses, the Idealist’s world is  constructed from an observation of the processes of thought. There are  but two things, he says in effect, about which we are sure: the  existence of a thinking subject, a conscious Self, and of an object,  an Idea, with which that subject deals. We know, that is to say, both  Mind and Thought. What we call the universe is really a collection of  such thoughts; and <a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_12"></a> these, we agree, have  been more or less distorted by the subject, the individual thinker, in  the process of assimilation. Obviously, we do not think all that there  is to be thought, conceive all that there is to be conceived; neither  do we necessarily combine in right order and proportion those ideas  which we are capable of grasping. Reality, says Objective Idealism, is  the complete, undistorted Object, the big thought, of which we pick up  these fragmentary hints: the world of phenomena which we treat as real  being merely its shadow show or “manifestation in space and  time.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p29"></a>According to the form of Objective Idealism here  chosen from amongst many as typical—for almost every Idealist  has his own scheme of metaphysical salvation   <a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#fn_5"><font size="1">6</font></a>
    —we live in a universe which is, in popular language, the Idea,  or Dream of its Creator. We, as Tweedledum explained to Alice in the  most philosophic of all fairy tales, are “just part of the  dream.” All life, all phenomena, are the endless modifications  and expressions of the one transcendent Object, the mighty and dynamic  Thought of one Absolute Thinker, in which we are bathed. This Object,  or certain aspects of it—and the place of each individual  consciousness within the Cosmic Thought, or, as we say, our position  in life, largely determines which these aspects shall be—is  interpreted by the senses and conceived by the mind, under limitations  which we are accustomed to call matter, space and time. But we have no  reason to suppose that matter, space, and time are necessarily parts  of reality; of the ultimate Idea. Probability points rather to their  being the pencil and paper with which we sketch it. As our vision, our  idea of things, tends to approximate more and more to that of the  Eternal Idea, so we get nearer and nearer to reality: for the  idealist’s reality is simply the Idea, or Thought of God.   <i>This,</i>    he says, is the supreme unity at which all the illusory appearances  that make up the widely differing worlds of “common  sense,” of science, of metaphysics, and of art dimly hint. This  is the sense in which it can truly be said that only the supernatural  possesses reality; for that world of appearance which we call natural  is certainly largely made up of preconception and illusion, of the  hints offered by the eternal real world of Idea outside our gates, and  the quaint concepts which we at our receiving instrument manufacture  from them.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p31"></a>There is this to be said for the argument of Idealism:  that in the last resort, the destinies of mankind are invariably  guided, not by the concrete “facts” of the sense world,  but by concepts <a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_13"></a> which are acknowledged  by every one to exist only on the mental plane. In the great moments  of existence, when he rises to spiritual freedom, these are the things  which every man feels to be real. It is by these and for these that he  is found willing to live, work suffer, and die. Love, patriotism,  religion, altruism, fame, all belong to the transcendental world.  Hence, they partake more of the nature of reality than any  “fact” could do; and man, dimly recognizing this, has ever  bowed to them as to immortal centres of energy. Religions as a rule  are steeped in idealism: Christianity in particular is a trumpet call  to an idealistic conception of life, Buddhism is little less. Over and  over again, their Scriptures tell us that only materialists will be  damned.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p32"></a>In Idealism we have perhaps the most sublime theory of  Being which has ever been constructed by the human intellect: a theory  so sublime, in fact, that it can hardly have been produced by the  exercise of “pure reason” alone, but must be looked upon  as a manifestation of that natural mysticism, that instinct for the  Absolute, which is latent in man. But, when we ask the idealist how we  are to attain communion with the reality which he describes to us as  “certainly there,” his system suddenly breaks down; and  discloses itself as a diagram of the heavens, not a ladder to the  stars. This failure of Idealism to find in practice the reality of  which it thinks so much is due, in the opinion of the mystics, to a  cause which finds epigrammatic expression in the celebrated phrase by  which St. Jerome marked the distinction between religion and  philosophy. “Plato located the soul of man in the head; Christ  located it in the heart.” That is to say, Idealism, though just  in its premises, and often daring and honest in their application, is  stultified by the exclusive intellectualism of its own methods: by its  fatal trust in the squirrel-work of the industrious brain instead of  the piercing vision of the desirous heart. It interests man, but does  not involve him in its processes: does not catch him up to the new and  more real life which it describes. Hence the thing that matters, the  living thing, has somehow escaped it; and its observations bear the  same relation to reality as the art of the anatomist does to the  mystery of birth.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p33"></a>3. But there is yet another Theory of Being to be  considered: that which may be loosely defined as   <i>Philosophic Scepticism.</i>    This is the attitude of those who refuse to accept either the  realistic or the idealistic answer to the eternal question: and,  confronted in their turn with the riddle of reality, reply that there  is no riddle to solve. We of course assume for the ordinary purposes  of life that for every sequence a: b: present in our consciousness  there exists a mental or material A: B: in the external universe, and  that the first is a strictly relevant, though probably wholly  inadequate, <a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_14"></a> expression of the second.  The bundle of visual and auditory sensations, for instance, whose sum  total I am accustomed to call Mrs. Smith, corresponds with something  that exists in the actual as well as in my phenomenal world. Behind my  Mrs. Smith, behind the very different Mrs. Smith which the X rays  would exhibit, there is, contends the Objective Idealist, a  transcendental, or in the Platonic sense an ideal Mrs. Smith, at whose  qualities I cannot even guess; but whose existence is quite  independent of my apprehension of it. But though we do and must act on  this hypothesis, it remains only a hypothesis; and it is one which  philosophic scepticism will not let pass.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p34"></a>The external world, say the sceptical schools,  is—so far as I know it—a concept present in my mind. If my  mind ceased to exist, so far as I know the concept which I call the  world would cease to exist too. The one thing which for me indubitably    <i>is,</i>    isthe self’s experience, its whole consciousness. Outside this  circle of consciousness I have no authority to indulge in guesses as  to what may or may not Be. Hence, for me, the Absolute is a  meaningless diagram, a superfluous complication of thought: since the  mind, wholly cut off from contact with external reality, has no reason  to suppose that such a reality exists except in its own ideas. Every  effort made by philosophy to go forth in search of it is merely the  metaphysical squirrel running round the conceptual cage. In the  completion and perfect unfolding of the set of ideas with which our  consciousness is furnished, lies the only reality which we can ever  hope to know. Far better to stay here and make ourselves at home: only  this, for us, truly is.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p35"></a>This purely subjective conception of Being has found  representatives in every school of thought: even including by a  curious paradox, that of mystical philosophy—its one effective  antagonist. Thus Delacroix, after an exhaustive and even sympathetic  analysis of St. Teresa’s progress towards union with the  Absolute, ends upon the assumption that the God with whom she was  united was the content of her own subconscious mind.   <a name="fr_6"></a><a href="#fn_6"><font size="1">7</font></a>
     Such a mysticism is that of a kitten running after its own tail: a  different path indeed from that which the great seekers for reality  have pursued. The   <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>    of this doctrine is found in the so-called “philosophy”  of New Thought, which begs its disciples to “try quietly to  realize that the Infinite is really You.”   <a name="fr_7"></a><a href="#fn_7"><font size="1">8</font></a>
     By its utter denial not merely of a knowable, but of a logically  conceivable Transcendent, it drives us in the end to the conclusion of  extreme pragmatism; that Truth, for us, is not an immutable reality,  but merely that idea which happens to work out as true and useful  <a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_15"></a> in any given experience. There is no  reality behind appearance; therefore all faiths, all figments with  which we people that nothingness are equally true, provided they be  comfortable and good to live by.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p38"></a>Logically carried out, this conception of Being would  permit each man to regard other men as non-existent except within his  own consciousness: the only place where a strict scepticism will allow  that anything exists. Even the mind which conceives consciousness  exists for us only in our own conception of it; we no more know what  we are than we know what we shall be. Man is left a conscious  Something in the midst, so far as he knows, of Nothing: with no  resources save the exploring of his own consciousness.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p39"></a>Philosophic scepticism is particularly interesting to  our present inquiry, because it shows us the position in which  “pure reason,” if left to itself, is bound to end. It is  utterly logical; and though we may feel it to be absurd, we can never  prove it to be so. Those who are temperamentally inclined to credulity  may become naturalists, and persuade themselves to believe in the  reality of the sense world. Those with a certain instinct for the  Absolute may adopt the more reasonable faith of idealism. But the true  intellectualist, who concedes nothing to instinct or emotion, is  obliged in the end to adopt some form of sceptical philosophy. The  horrors of nihilism, in fact, can only be escaped by the exercise of  faith, by a trust in man’s innate but strictly irrational  instinct for that Real “above all reason, beyond all  thought” towards which at its best moments his spirit tends. If  the metaphysician be true to his own postulates, he must acknowledge  in the end that we are all forced to live, to think, and at last to  die, in an unknown and unknowable world: fed arbitrarily and  diligently, yet how we know not, by ideas and suggestions whose truth  we cannot test but whose pressure we cannot resist. It is not by sight  but by faith—faith in a supposed external order which we can  never prove to exist, and in the approximate truthfulness and  constancy of the vague messages which we receive from it—that  ordinary men must live and move. We must put our trust in “laws  of nature” which have been devised by the human mind as a  convenient epitome of its own observations of phenomena, must, for the  purposes of daily life, accept these phenomena at their face value: an  act of faith beside which the grossest superstitions of the Neapolitan  peasant are hardly noticeable.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p40"></a>The intellectual quest of Reality, then, leads us down  one of three blind alleys: (1) To an acceptance of the symbolic world  of appearance as the real; (2) to the elaboration of a theory also of  necessity symbolic—which, beautiful in itself, cannot help us  <a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_16"></a> to attain the Absolute which it  describes; (3) to a hopeless but strictly logical skepticism.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p41"></a>In answer to the “Why? Why?” of the  bewildered and eternal child in us, philosophy, though always ready to  postulate the unknown if she can, is bound to reply only,   <i>“Nescio! Nescio!”</i>    In spite of all her busy map-making, she cannot reach the goal which  she points out to us, cannot explain the curious conditions under  which we imagine that we know; cannot even divide with a sure hand the  subject and object of thought. Science, whose business is with  phenomena and our knowledge of them, though she too is an idealist at  heart, has been accustomed to explain that all our ideas and  instincts, the pictured world that we take so seriously, the oddly  limited and illusory nature of our experience, appear to minister to  one great end: the preservation of life, and consequent fulfilment of  that highly mystical hypothesis, the Cosmic Idea. Each perception, she  assures us, serves a useful purpose in this evolutionary scheme: a  scheme, by the way, which has been invented—we know not  why—by the human mind, and imposed upon an obedient  universe.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p42"></a>By vision, hearing, smell, and touch, says Science, we  find our way about, are warned of danger, obtain our food. The male  perceives beauty in the female in order that the species may be  propagated. It is true that this primitive instinct has given birth to  higher and purer emotions; but these too fulfil a social purpose and  are not so useless as they seem. Man must eat to live, therefore many  foods give us agreeable sensations. If he overeats, he dies; therefore  indigestion is an unpleasant pain. Certain facts of which too keen a  perception would act detrimentally to the life-force are, for most  men, impossible of realization:   <i>i.e.</i>   , the uncertainty of life, the decay of the body, the vanity of all  things under the sun. When we are in good health, we all feel very  real, solid, and permanent; and this is of all our illusions the most  ridiculous, and also the most obviously useful from the point of view  of the efficiency and preservation of the race.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p43"></a>But when we look closer, we see that this brisk  generalization does not cover all the ground—not even that  little tract of ground of which our senses make us free; indeed, that  it is more remarkable for its omissions than for its inclusions.  Récéjac has well said that “from the moment in which  man is no longer content to devise things useful for his existence  under the exclusive action of the will-to-live, the principle of  (physical) evolution has been violated.”   <a name="fr_8"></a><a href="#fn_8"><font size="1">9</font></a>
     Nothing can be more certain than that man is not so content. He has  been called by utilitarian philosophers a tool-making animal—the  highest praise they knew how to bestow. <a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_17"></a> More surely  he is a vision-making animal;   <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">10</font></a>
     a creature of perverse and unpractical ideals, dominated by dreams no  less than by appetites—dreams which can only be justified upon  the theory that he moves towards some other goal than that of physical  perfection or intellectual supremacy, is controlled by some higher and  more vital reality than that of the determinists. We are driven to the  conclusion that if the theory of evolution is to include or explain  the facts of artistic and spiritual experience—and it cannot be  accepted by any serious thinker if these great tracts of consciousness  remain outside its range—it must be rebuilt on a mental rather  than a physical basis.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p46"></a>Even the most ordinary human life includes in its  range fundamental experiences—violent and unforgettable  sensations—forced on us as it were against our will, for which  science finds it hard to account. These experiences and sensations,  and the hours of exalted emotion which they bring with  them—often recognized by us as the greatest, most significant  hours of our lives—fulfil no office in relation to her pet  “functions of nutrition and reproduction.” It is true that  they are far-reaching in their effects on character; but they do  little or nothing to assist that character in its struggle for  physical life. To the unprejudiced eye many of them seem hopelessly  out of place in a universe constructed on strictly physico-chemical  lines—look almost as though nature, left to herself, tended to  contradict her own beautifully logical laws. Their presence, more, the  large place which they fill in the human world of appearance, is a  puzzling circumstance for deterministic philosophers; who can only  escape from the dilemma here presented to them by calling these things  illusions, and dignifying their own more manageable illusions with the  title of facts.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p47"></a>Amongst the more intractable of these groups of  perceptions and experiences are those which we connect with religion,  with pain and with beauty. All three, for those selves which are  capable of receiving their messages, possess a mysterious authority  far in excess of those feelings, arguments, or appearances which they  may happen to contradict. All three, were the universe of the  naturalists true, would be absurd; all three have ever been treated  with the reverence due to vital matters by the best minds of the  race.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p48"></a>A. I need not point out the hopelessly irrational  character of all great religions: which rest, one and all, on a  primary assumption that can never be intellectually demonstrated, much  less <a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_18"></a> proved—the assumption that  the supra-sensible is somehow important and real, and is intimately  connected with the life of man. This fact has been incessantly dwelt  upon by their critics, and has provoked many a misplaced exercise of  ingenuity on the part of their intelligent friends. Yet  religion—emphasizing and pushing to extremes that general  dependence on faith which we saw to be an inevitable condition of our  lives—is one of the most universal and ineradicable functions of  man, and this although it constantly acts detrimentally to the  interests of his merely physical existence, opposes “the  exclusive action of the will-to-live,” except in so far as that  will aspires to eternal life. Strictly utilitarian, almost logical in  the savage, religion becomes more and more transcendental with the  upward progress of the race. It begins as black magic; it ends as Pure  Love. Why did the Cosmic Idea elaborate this religious instinct, if  the construction put upon its intentions by the determinists be  true?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p49"></a>B. Consider again the whole group of phenomena which  are known as “the problem of suffering”: the mental  anguish and physical pain which appear to be the inevitable result of  the steady operation of “natural law” and its voluntary  assistants, the cruelty, greed, and injustice of man. Here, it is  true, the naturalist seems at first sight to make a little headway,  and can point to some amongst the cruder forms of suffering which are  clearly useful to the race: punishing us for past follies, spurring to  new efforts, warning against future infringements of  “law.” But he forgets the many others which refuse to be  resumed under this simple formula: forgets to explain how it is that  the Cosmic Idea involves the long torments of the incurable, the  tortures of the innocent, the deep anguish of the bereaved, the  existence of so many gratuitously agonizing forms of death. He  forgets, too, the strange fact that man’s capacity for suffering  tends to increase in depth and subtlety with the increase of culture  and civilization; ignores the still more mysterious, perhaps most  significant circumstance that the highest types have accepted it  eagerly and willingly, have found in Pain the grave but kindly teacher  of immortal secrets, the conferrer of liberty, even the initiator into  amazing joys.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p50"></a>Those who “explain” suffering as the  result of nature’s immense fecundity—a by-product of that  overcrowding and stress through which the fittest tend to  survive—forget that even were this demonstration valid and  complete it would leave the real problem untouched. The question is  not, whence come those conditions which provoke in the self the  experiences called sorrow, anxiety, pain: but, why do these conditions    <i>hurt</i>    the self? The pain is mental; a little chloroform, and though the  conditions continue <a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_19"></a> unabated the  suffering is gone. Why does full consciousness always include the  mysterious capacity for misery as well as for happiness—a  capacity which seems at first sight to invalidate any conception of  the Absolute as Beautiful and Good? Why does evolution, as we ascend  the ladder of life, foster instead of diminishing the capacity for  useless mental anguish, for long, dull torment, bitter grief? Why,  when so much lies outside our limited powers of perception, when so  many of our own most vital functions are unperceived by consciousness,  does suffering of some sort form an integral part of the experience of  man? For utilitarian purposes acute discomfort would be quite enough;  the Cosmic Idea, as the determinists explain it, did not really need  an apparatus which felt all the throes of cancer, the horrors of  neurasthenia, the pangs of birth. Still less did it need the torments  of impotent sympathy for other people’s irremediable pain the  dreadful power of feeling the world’s woe. We are hopelessly  over-sensitized for the part science calls us to play.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p51"></a>Pain, however we may look at it, indicates a profound  disharmony between the sense-world and the human self. If it is to be  vanquished, either the disharmony must be resolved by a deliberate and  careful adjustment of the self to the world of sense, or, that self  must turn from the sense-world to some other with which it is in tune.   <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">11</font></a>
     Pessimist and optimist here join hands. But whilst the pessimist,  resting in appearance, only sees “nature red in tooth and  claw” offering him little hope of escape, the optimist thinks  that pain and anguish—which may in their lower forms be  life’s harsh guides on the path of physical evolution—in  their higher and apparently “useless” developments are her  leaders and teachers in the upper school of Supra-sensible Reality. He  believes that they press the self towards another world, still  “natural” for him, though “supernatural” for  his antagonist, in which it will be more at home. Watching life, he  sees in Pain the complement of Love: and is inclined to call these the  wings on which man’s spirit can best take flight towards the  Absolute. Hence he can say with A Kempis, “Gloriari in  tribulatione non est grave amanti,”   <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">12</font></a>
     and needs not to speak of morbid folly when he sees the Christian  saints run eagerly and merrily to the Cross.   <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">13</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p55"></a>He calls suffering the “gymnastic of  eternity,” the “terrible <a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_20"></a> initiative  caress of God”; recognizing in it a quality for which the  disagreeable rearrangement of nerve molecules cannot account.  Sometimes, in the excess of his optimism, he puts to the test of  practice this theory with all its implications. Refusing to be deluded  by the pleasures of the sense world, he accepts instead of avoiding  pain, and becomes an ascetic; a puzzling type for the convinced  naturalist, who, falling back upon contempt—that favourite  resource of the frustrated reason—can only regard him as  diseased.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p56"></a>Pain, then, which plunges like a sword through  creation, leaving on the one side cringing and degraded animals and on  the other side heroes and saints, is one of those facts of universal  experience which are peculiarly intractable from the point of view of  a merely materialistic philosophy.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p57"></a>C. From this same point of view the existence of music  and poetry, the qualities of beauty and of rhythm, the evoked  sensations of awe, reverence, and rapture, are almost as difficult to  account for. The question   <i>why</i>    an apparent corrugation of the Earth’s surface, called for  convenience’ sake an Alp, coated with congealed water, and  perceived by us as a snowy peak, should produce in certain natures  acute sensations of ecstasy and adoration, why the skylark’s  song should catch us up to heaven, and wonder and mystery speak to us  alike in “the little speedwell’s darling blue” and  in the cadence of the wind, is a problem that seems to be merely  absurd, until it is seen to be insoluble. Here Madam How and Lady Why  alike are silent. With all our busy seeking, we have not found the  sorting house where loveliness is extracted from the flux of things.  We know not why “great” poetry should move us to  unspeakable emotion, or a stream of notes, arranged in a peculiar  sequence, catch us up to heightened levels of vitality: nor can we  guess how a passionate admiration for that which we call  “best” in art or letters can possibly contribute to the  physical evolution of the race. In spite of many lengthy disquisitions  on Esthetics, Beauty’s secret is still her own. A shadowy  companion, half seen, half guessed at, she keeps step with the upward  march of life: and we receive her message and respond to it, not  because we understand it but because we   <i>must</i>   .</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p58"></a>Here it is that we approach that attitude of the self,  that point of view, which is loosely and generally called   <i>mystical.</i>    Here, instead of those broad blind alleys which philosophy showed us,  a certain type of mind has always discerned three strait and narrow  ways going out towards the Absolute. In religion, in pain, and in  beauty—and not only in these, but in many other apparently  useless peculiarities of the empirical world and of the perceiving  consciousness—these persons insist that they recognize at least  <a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="green">p. 21</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_21"></a> the fringe of the real. Down these three  paths, as well as by many another secret way, they claim that news  comes to the self concerning levels of reality which in their  wholeness are inaccessible to the senses: worlds wondrous and  immortal, whose existence is not conditioned by the  “given” world which those senses report.  “Beauty,” said Hegel, who, though he was no mystic, had a  touch of that mystical intuition which no philosopher can afford to be  without, “is merely the Spiritual making itself known  sensuously.”   <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">14</font></a>
     In the good, the beautiful, the true,” says Rudolph Eucken,  “we see Reality revealing its personal character. They are parts  of a coherent and substantial spiritual world.”   <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">15</font></a>
     Here, some of the veils of that substantial world are stripped off:  Reality peeps through and is recognized, dimly or acutely, by the  imprisoned self.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p61"></a>Récéjac only develops this idea when he  says,   <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">16</font></a>
     “If the mind penetrates deeply into the facts of aesthetics, it  will find more and more, that these facts are based upon an ideal  identity between the mind itself and things. At a certain point the  harmony becomes so complete, and the finality so close that it gives  us actual emotion. The Beautiful then becomes the sublime; brief  apparition, by which the soul is caught up into the true mystic state,  and touches the Absolute. It is scarcely possible to persist in this  Esthetic perception without feeling lifted up by it above things and  above ourselves, in an ontological vision which closely resembles the  Absolute of the Mystics.” It was of this underlying  reality—this truth of things—that St. Augustine cried in a  moment of lucid vision, “Oh, Beauty so old and so new, too late  have I loved thee!”   <a name="fr_16"></a><a href="#fn_16"><font size="1">17</font></a>
     It is in this sense also that “beauty is truth, truth  beauty”: and as regards the knowledge of ultimate things which  is possible to ordinary men, it may well be that</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iii.i-p63.1"></a> “That is all<br>   Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.”<br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p64"></a>“Of Beauty,” says Plato in an  immortal passage, “I repeat again that we saw her there shining  in company with the celestial forms; and coming to earth we find her  here too, shining in clearness through the clearest aperture of sense.  For sight is the most piercing of our bodily senses: though not by  that is wisdom seen; her loveliness would have been transporting if  there had been a visible image of her, and the other ideas, if they  had visible counterparts, would be equally lovely. But this is the  privilege of Beauty, that being the loveliest she is also the most  palpable to sight. Now <a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_22"></a> he who is not  newly initiated, or who has been corrupted, does not easily rise out  of this world to the sight of true beauty in the other. . . . But he  whose initiation is recent, and who has been the spectator of many  glories in the other world, is amazed when he sees anyone having a  godlike face or form, which is the expression of Divine Beauty; and at  first a shudder runs through him, and again the old awe steals over  him. . . .”   <a name="fr_17"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">18</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p66"></a>Most men in the course of their lives have known such  Platonic hours of initiation, when the sense of beauty has risen from  a pleasant feeling to a passion, and an element of strangeness and  terror has been mingled with their joy. In those hours the world has  seemed charged with a new vitality; with a splendour which does not  belong to it but is poured through it, as light through a coloured  window, grace through a sacrament, from that Perfect Beauty which  “shines in company with the celestial forms” beyond the  pale of appearance. In such moods of heightened consciousness each  blade of grass seems fierce with meaning, and becomes a well of  wondrous light: a “little emerald set in the City of God.”  The seeing self is indeed an initiate thrust suddenly into the  sanctuary of the mysteries: and feels the “old awe and  amazement” with which man encounters the Real. In such  experiences, a new factor of the eternal calculus appears to be thrust  in on us, a factor which no honest seeker for truth can afford to  neglect; since, if it be dangerous to say that any two systems of  knowledge are mutually exclusive, it is still more dangerous to give  uncritical priority to any one system. We are bound, then, to examine  this path to reality as closely and seriously as we should investigate  the most neatly finished safety-ladder of solid ash which offered a   <i>salita alle stelle.</i> </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p67"></a>Why, after all, take as our standard a material world  whose existence is affirmed by nothing more trustworthy than the  sense-impressions of “normal men”; those imperfect and  easily cheated channels of communication? The mystics, those  adventurers of whom we spoke upon the first page of this book, have  always declared, implicitly or explicitly, their distrust in these  channels of communication. They have never been deceived by phenomena,  nor by the careful logic of the industrious intellect. One after  another, with extraordinary unanimity, they have rejected that appeal  to the unreal world of appearance which is the standard of <a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_23"></a> sensible men: affirming that there is another  way, another secret, by which the conscious self may reach the  actuality which it seeks. More complete in their grasp of experience  than the votaries of intellect or of sense, they accept as central for  life those spiritual messages which are mediated by religion, by  beauty, and by pain. More reasonable than the rationalists, they find  in that very hunger for reality which is the mother of all  metaphysics, an implicit proof that such reality exists; that there is  something else, some final satisfaction, beyond the ceaseless stream  of sensation which besieges consciousness. “In that thou hast  sought me, thou hast already found me,” says the voice of  Absolute Truth in their ears. This is the first doctrine of mysticism.  Its next is that only in so far as the self is real can it hope to  know Reality: like to like: <a name="an_iii.i-p67.1"></a>Cot ad cot  loquitur. Upon the propositions implicit in these two  laws the whole claim and practice of the mystic life depends.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p68"></a>“Finite as we are,” they say—and  here they speak not for themselves, but for the race—“lost  though we seem to be in the woods or in the wide air’s  wilderness, in this world of time and of chance, we have still, like  the strayed animals or like the migrating birds, our homing instinct.  . . . We seek. That is a fact. We seek a city still out of sight. In  the contrast with this goal, we live. But if this be so, then already  we possess something of Being even in our finite seeking. For the  readiness to seek is already something of an attainment, even if a  poor one.”   <a name="fr_18"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">19</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p70"></a>Further, in this seeking we are not wholly dependent  on that homing instinct. For some, who have climbed to the hill-tops,  that city is not really out of sight. The mystics see it and report to  us concerning it. Science and metaphysics may do their best and their  worst: but these pathfinders of the spirit never falter in their  statements concerning that independent spiritual world which is the  only goal of “pilgrim man.” They say that messages come to  him from that spiritual world, that complete reality which we call  Absolute: that we are not, after all, hermetically sealed from it. To  all who will receive it, news comes of a world of Absolute Life,  Absolute Beauty, Absolute Truth, beyond the bourne of time and place:  news that most of us translate—and inevitably distort in the  process—into the language of religion, of beauty, of love, or of  pain.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p71"></a>Of all those forms of life and thought with which  humanity has fed its craving for truth, mysticism alone postulates,  and in the persons of its great initiates proves, not only the  existence of the Absolute, but also this link: this possibility first  of knowing, finally of attaining it. It denies that possible knowledge  is to be limited (<i>a</i>) to sense impressions, (<i>b</i>) to   any process of intellection, <a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_24"></a> (<i>c</i>) to the   unfolding of the content of normal consciousness. Such  diagrams of experience, it says, are hopelessly incomplete. The  mystics find the basis of their method not in logic but in life: in  the existence of a discoverable “real,” a spark of true  being, within the seeking subject, which can, in that ineffable  experience which they call the “act of union,” fuse itself  with and thus apprehend the reality of the sought Object. In  theological language, their theory of knowledge is that the spirit of  man, itself essentially divine, is capable of immediate communion with  God, the One Reality.   <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">20</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p73"></a>In mysticism that love of truth which we saw as the  beginning of all philosophy leaves the merely intellectual sphere, and  takes on the assured aspect of a personal passion. Where the  philosopher guesses and argues, the mystic lives and looks; and  speaks, consequently, the disconcerting language of first-hand  experience, not the neat dialectic of the schools. Hence whilst the  Absolute of the metaphysicians remains a diagram—impersonal and  unattainable—the Absolute of the mystics is lovable, attainable,  alive.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iii.i-p74"></a>“Oh, taste and see!” they cry, in accents  of astounding certainty and joy. “Ours is an experimental  science. We can but communicate our system, never its result. We come  to you not as thinkers, but as doers. Leave your deep and absurd trust  in the senses, with their language of dot and dash, which may possibly  report fact but can never communicate personality. If philosophy has  taught you anything, she has surely taught you the length of her  tether, and the impossibility of attaining to the doubtless admirable  grazing land which lies beyond it. One after another, idealists have  arisen who, straining frantically at the rope, have announced to the  world their approaching liberty; only to be flung back at last into  the little circle of sensation. But here we are, a small family, it is  true, yet one that refuses to die out, assuring you that we have  slipped the knot and are free of those grazing grounds. This is  evidence which you are bound to bring into account before you can add  up the sum total of possible knowledge; for you will find it  impossible to prove that the world as seen by the mystics,  ‘unimaginable, formless, dark with excess of bright,’ is  less real than that which is expounded by the youngest and most  promising demonstrator of a physicochemical universe. We will be quite  candid with you. Examine us as much as you like: our machinery, our  veracity, our results. We cannot promise that you shall see what we  have seen, for here each man must adventure for himself; <a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></a> <a name="an_iii.i-Page_25"></a> but we defy you to stigmatize our experiences  as impossible or invalid. Is your world of experience so well and  logically founded that you dare make of it a standard? Philosophy  tells you that it is founded on nothing better than the reports of  your sensory apparatus and the traditional concepts of the race.  Certainly it is imperfect, probably it is illusion in any event, it  never touches the foundation of things. Whereas ‘what the world,  which truly knows nothing, calls “mysticism” is the  science of ultimates, . . . the science of self-evident Reality, which  cannot be “reasoned about,” because it is the object of  pure reason or perception.’“   <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">21</font></a>

 </p><p><a name="an_iii.i-p7"></a>         Even this I AM, which has seemed safe ground to most metaphysicians,    is of course combated by certain schools of philosophy. “The    word     <i>Sum</i>     ,” said Eckhart long ago, “can be spoken by no creature    but by God only: for it becomes the creature to testify of itself     <i>Non Sum</i>     .” In a less mystical strain Lotze, and after him Bradley and    other modern writers, have devoted much destructive criticism to the    concept of the Ego as the starting-point of philosophy: looking upon    it as a large, and logically unwarrantable, assumption.</p>

 </p><p><a name="an_iii.i-p12"></a>         Thus Eckhart, “Every time that the powers of the soul come    into contact with created things, they receive the     <i>create</i>      images and likenesses from the created thing and absorb them. In    this way arises the soul’s knowledge of created things.    Created things cannot come nearer to the soul than this, and the    soul can only approach created things by the voluntary reception of    images. And it is through the presence of the image that the soul    approaches the created world: for     <i>the</i>          <i>image is a Thing, which the soul creates</i>      with her own powers. Does the soul want to know the nature of a    stone—horse—a man? She forms an    image.”—-Meister Eckhart, Pred. i. (“Mystische    Schriften,” p. 15).</p>

 </p><p><a name="an_iii.i-p16"></a>         Thus Edward Carpenter says of his own experience of the mystical    consciousness, “The perception seems to be one in which all    the senses unite into one sense” (quoted in Bucke’s    “Cosmic Consciousness,” p. 198).</p>

 </p><p><a name="an_iii.i-p65"></a>         “Phaedrus,” § 250 (Jowett’s translation). The    reference in the phrase “he whose initiation is recent”    is to the rite of admission into the Orphic Mysteries. It is    believed by some authorities that the neophyte may have been cast    into an hypnotic sleep by his “initiator,” and whilst in    this condition a vision of the “glories of the other    world” suggested to him. The main phenomena of    “conversion” would thus be artificially produced: but    the point of attack being the mind rather than the heart, the    results, as would appear from the context, were usually    transient.</p>

 </p><p><a name="an_iii.i-p72"></a>         The idea of Divine Union as man’s true end is of course of    great antiquity. Its first definite appearance in the religious    consciousness of Europe seems to coincide with the establishment of    the Orphic Mysteries in Greece and Southern Italy in the sixth    century B.C.
