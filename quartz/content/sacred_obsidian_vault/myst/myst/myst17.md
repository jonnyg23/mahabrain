 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p1"></a>In<a name="an_iv.vi-p1.1"></a> our study of the First Mystic Life, its purification and  illumination, we have been analysing and considering a process of  organic development; an evolution of personality. We may treat this  either as a movement of consciousness towards higher levels, or as a  remaking of consciousness consequent on the emergence and growth of a  factor which is dormant in ordinary man, but destined to be supreme in  the full-grown mystic type. We have seen the awakening of this  factor—this spark of the soul—with its innate capacity for  apprehending the Absolute. We have seen it attack and conquer the old  sense-fed and self-centred life of the normal self, and introduce it  into a new universe, lit up by the Uncreated Light. These were the  events which, taken together, constituted the “First Mystic  Life”; a complete round upon the spiral road which leads from  man to God.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p2"></a>What we have been looking at, then, is a life-process,  the establishment of a certain harmony between the created self and  that Reality whose invitation it has heard: and we have discussed this  life-process rather as if it contained no elements which were not  referable to natural and spontaneous growth, to the involuntary <a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="green">p. 299</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_299"></a> adjustments of the organism to that extended or  transcendental universe of which it gradually becomes aware. But side  by side with this organic growth there always goes a specific kind of  activity which is characteristic of the mystic: an education which he  is called to undertake, that his consciousness of the Infinite may be  stabilized, enriched and defined. Already once or twice we have been  in the presence of this activity, have been obliged to take its  influence into account: as, were we studying other artistic types, we  could not leave on one side the medium in which they work.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p3"></a>  <i>Contemplation</i>    is the mystic’s medium. It is an extreme form of that  withdrawal of attention from the external world and total dedication  of the mind which also, in various degrees and ways, conditions the  creative activity of musician, painter and poet: releasing the faculty  by which he can apprehend the Good and Beautiful, enter into communion  with the Real. As “voice” or “vision” is often  the way in which the mystical consciousness presents its discoveries  to the surface-mind, so contemplation is the way in which it makes  those discoveries, perceives the suprasensible over against itself.  The growth of the mystic’s effective genius, therefore, is  connected with his growth in this art: and that growth is largely  conditioned by education.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p4"></a>The painter, however great his natural powers, can  hardly dispense with some technical training; the musician is wise if  he acquaint himself at least with the elements of counterpoint. So too  the mystic. It is true that he sometimes seems to spring abruptly to  the heights, to be caught into ecstasy without previous preparation:  as a poet may startle the world by a sudden masterpiece. But unless  they be backed by discipline, these sudden and isolated flashes of  inspiration will not long avail for the production of great works.  <a name="an_iv.vi-p4.1"></a>“Ordina quest’ amore, o tu che  m’ami” is the imperative demand made by  Goodness, Truth, and Beauty, by every aspect of Reality, upon the  human soul. Lover and philosopher, saint, artist, and scientist, must  alike obey or fail.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p5"></a>Transcendental genius, then, obeys the laws which  govern all other forms of genius, in being susceptible of culture:  and, indeed, cannot develop its full powers without an educative  process of some kind. This strange art of contemplation, which the  mystic tends to practise during the whole of his career—which  develops step by step with his vision and his love—demands of  the self which undertakes it the same hard dull work, the same slow  training of the will, which lies behind all supreme achievement, and  is the price of all true liberty. It is the want of such  training—such “supersensual drill”—which is  responsible for the mass of vague, ineffectual, and sometimes harmful  mysticism which has <a name="page_300"><font size="1" color="green">p. 300</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_300"></a> always existed: the dilute  cosmic emotion and limp spirituality which hang, as it were, on the  skirts of the true seekers of the Absolute, and bring discredit upon  their science.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p6"></a>In this, as in all the other and lesser arts which  have been developed by the race, education consists largely in a  humble willingness to submit to the discipline, and profit by the  lessons, of the past. Tradition runs side by side with experience; the  past collaborates with the present. Each new and eager soul rushing  out towards the only end of Love passes on its way the landmarks left  by others upon the pathway to Reality. If it be wise it observes them:  and finds in them rather helps towards attainment than hindrances to  that freedom which is of the essence of the mystic act. This act, it  is true, is in the last resort a solitary experience, “the  flight of the Alone to the Alone”; even though no achievement of  the soul truly takes place   <i>in</i>      <i>vacao,</i>    or leaves the universe of souls unchanged. At the same time, here as  elsewhere, man cannot safely divorce his personal history from that of  the race. The best and truest experience does not come to the  eccentric and individual pilgrim whose intuitions are his only law:  but rather to him who is willing to profit by the culture of the  spiritual society in which he finds himself, and submit personal  intuition to the guidance afforded by the general history of the  mystic type. Those who refuse this guidance expose themselves to all  the dangers which crowd about the individualist: from heresy at one  end of the scale to madness at the other.  <i>Vae Soli!</i>  Nowhere more clearly than in the history of mysticism  do we observe the essential solidarity of mankind, the penalty paid by  those who will not acknowledge it.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p7"></a>The education which tradition has ever prescribed for  the mystic, consists in the gradual development of an extraordinary  faculty of concentration, a power of spiritual attention. It is not  enough that he should naturally be “aware of the  Absolute,” unless he be able to contemplate it: just as the mere  possession of eyesight or hearing, however acute, needs to be  supplemented by trained powers of perception and reception, if we are  really to appreciate—see or hear to any purpose—the  masterpieces of Music or of Art. More, Nature herself reveals little  of her secret to those who only look and listen with the outward ear  and eye. The condition of all valid seeing and hearing, upon every  plane of consciousness, lies not in the sharpening of the senses, but  in a peculiar attitude of the whole personality: in a self-forgetting  attentiveness, a profound concentration, a self-merging, which  operates a real communion between the seer and the seen—in a  word, in   <i>Contemplation.</i> </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p8"></a>Contemplation, then, in the most general sense is a  power which we may—and often must—apply to the perception,  not <a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="green">p. 301</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_301"></a> only of Divine Reality, but of anything. It is  a mental attitude under which all things give up to us the secret of  their life. All artists are of necessity in some measure  contemplative. In so far as they surrender themselves without selfish  preoccupation, they see Creation from the point of view of God.   <a name="fr_629"></a><a href="#fn_629"><font size="1">630</font></a>
     “Innocence of eye” is little else than this: and only by  its means can they see truly those things which they desire to show  the world. I invite those to whom these statements seem a compound of  cheap psychology and cheaper metaphysics to clear their minds of  prejudice and submit this matter to an experimental test. If they will  be patient and honest—and unless they belong to that minority  which is temperamentally incapable of the simplest contemplative  act—they will emerge from the experiment possessed of a little  new knowledge as to the nature of the relation between the human mind  and the outer world.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p10"></a>All that is asked is that we shall look for a little  time, in a special and undivided manner, at some simple, concrete, and  external thing. This object of our contemplation may be almost  anything we please: a picture, a statue, a tree, a distant hillside, a  growing plant, running water, little living things. We need not, with  Kant, go to the starry heavens. “A little thing the quantity of  an hazel nut” will do for us, as it did for Lady Julian long  ago.   <a name="fr_630"></a><a href="#fn_630"><font size="1">631</font></a>
     Remember, it is a practical experiment on which we are set; not an  opportunity of pretty and pantheistic meditation.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p12"></a>Look, then, at this thing which you have chosen.  Wilfully yet tranquilly refuse the messages which countless other  aspects of the world are sending; and so concentrate your whole  attention on this one act of loving sight that all other objects are  excluded from the conscious field. Do not think, but as it were pour  out your personality towards it: let your soul be in your eyes. Almost  at once, this new method of perception will reveal unsuspected  qualities in the external world. First, you will perceive about you a  strange and deepening quietness; a slowing down of our feverish mental  time. Next, you will become aware of a heightened significance, an  intensified existence in the thing at which you look. As you, with all  your consciousness, lean out towards it, an answering current will  meet yours. It seems as though the barrier between its life and your  own, between subject and object, had melted away. <a name="page_302"><font size="1" color="green">p. 302</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_302"></a>  You are merged with it, in an act of true communion: and you   <i>know</i>    the secret of its being deeply and unforgettably, yet in a way which  you can never hope to express.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p13"></a>Seen thus, a thistle has celestial qualities: a  speckled hen a touch of the sublime. Our greater comrades, the trees,  the clouds, the rivers, initiate us into mighty secrets, flame out at  us “like shining from shook foil.” The “eye which  looks upon Eternity” has been given its opportunity. We have  been immersed for a moment in the “life of the All”: a  deep and peaceful love unites us with the substance of all things, a  “Mystic Marriage” has taken place between the mind and  some aspect of the external world. <a name="an_iv.vi-p13.1"></a>   <i>Cor ad cor loquitur</i>   :Life has spoken to life, but not to the  surface-intelligence. That surface-intelligence knows only that the  message was true and beautiful: no more.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p14"></a>The price of this experience has been a stilling of  that surface-mind, a calling in of all our scattered interests: an  entire giving of ourselves to this one activity, without  self-consciousness, without reflective thought. To reflect is always  to distort: our minds are not good mirrors. The contemplative, on  whatever level his faculty may operate, is contented to absorb and be  absorbed: and by this humble access he attains to a plane of knowledge  which no intellectual process can come near.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p15"></a>I do not suggest that this simple experiment is in any  sense to be equated with the transcendental contemplation of the  mystic. Yet it exercises on a small scale, and in regard to visible  Nature, the same natural faculties which are taken up and  used—it is true upon other levels, and in subjection to the  transcendental sense—in his apprehension of the Invisible Real.  Though it is one thing to see truthfully for an instant the flower in  the crannied wall, another to be lifted up to the apprehension of  “eternal Truth, true Love and loved Eternity,” yet both  according to their measure are functions of the inward eye, operating  in the “suspension of the mind.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p16"></a>This humble receptiveness, this still and steady  gazing, in which emotion, will, and thought are lost and fused, is the  secret of the great contemplative on fire with love of that which he  has been allowed to see. But whilst the contemplation of Nature  entails an outgoing towards somewhat indubitably external to us, and  has as its material the world of sensible experience: the  contemplation of Spirit, as it seems to those who practise it,  requires a deliberate refusal of the messages of the senses, an  ingoing or “introversion” of our faculties, a  “journey towards the centre.” The Kingdom of God, they  say, is within you: seek it, then, in the most secret habitations of  the soul. The mystic must learn so to concentrate all his faculties,  his very self, upon the invisible and intangible, <a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="green">p. 303</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_303"></a>  that all visible things are forgot: to bring it so sharply into focus  that everything else is blurred. He must call in his scattered  faculties by a deliberate exercise of the will, empty his mind of its  swarm of images, its riot of thought. In mystical language he must  “sink into his nothingness”: into that blank abiding place  where busy, clever Reason cannot come. The whole of this process, this  gathering up and turning “inwards” of the powers of the  self, this gazing into the ground of the soul, is that which is called    <i>Introversion.</i> </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p17"></a>Introversion is an art which can be acquired, as  gradually and as certainly, by the born mystic, as the art of  piano-playing can be acquired by the born musician. In both cases it  is the genius of the artist which makes his use of the instrument  effective: but it is also his education in the use of the instrument  which enables that genius to express itself in an adequate way. Such  mystical education, of course, presumes a something that can be  educated: the “New Birth,” the awakening of the deeper  self, must have taken place before it can begin. It is a psychological  process, and obeys psychological laws. There is in it no element of  the unexpected or the abnormal. In technical language, we are here  concerned with “ordinary” not “extraordinary”  contemplation.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p18"></a>In its early stages the practice of introversion is  voluntary, difficult, and deliberate; as are the early stages of  learning to read or write. But as reading or writing finally becomes  automatic, so as the mystic’s training in introversion proceeds,  habits are formed: and those contemplative powers which he is  educating establish themselves amongst his normal faculties. Sometimes  they wholly dominate these faculties, escape the control of the will,  and appear spontaneously, seizing upon the conscious field. Such  violent and involuntary invasions of the transcendental powers, when  they utterly swamp the surface-consciousness and the subject is  therefore cut off from his ordinary “external world,”  constitute the typical experience of   <i>rapture</i>    or   <i>ecstasy.</i>    It is under the expansive formula of such abrupt ecstatic perception,  “not by gradual steps, but by sudden ecstatic flights soaring  aloft to the glorious things on high,”   <a name="fr_631"></a><a href="#fn_631"><font size="1">632</font></a>
     that the mystical consciousness of Divine Transcendence is most  clearly expressed. Those wide, exalted apprehensions of the Godhead  which we owe to the mystics have usually been obtained, not by  industrious meditation, but by “a transcending of all creatures,  a perfect going forth from oneself: by standing in an ecstasy of  mind.”   <a name="fr_632"></a><a href="#fn_632"><font size="1">633</font></a>
     Hence the experiences peculiar to these ecstatic states have a great  value for the student of mysticism. It will be our duty to consider  them in detail in a <a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="green">p. 304</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_304"></a> later section of this book. The  normal and deliberate practice of introversion, on the contrary, is  bound up with the sense of Divine Immanence. Its emphasis is on the  indwelling God Who may be found “by a journey towards the  centre”: on the conviction indeed that “angels and  archangels are with us, but He is more truly our own who is not only   <i>with us</i>    but   <i>in us</i>   .”   <a name="fr_633"></a><a href="#fn_633"><font size="1">634</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p22"></a>Contemplation—taking that term in its widest  sense, as embracing all the degrees and kinds of mystical  prayer—establishes communion between the soul and the Absolute  by way of these complementary modes of apprehending that which is One.  A. The usually uncontrollable, definitely outgoing, ecstatic  experience; the attainment of Pure Being, or “flight to  God.” B. The more controllable ingoing experience; the breaking  down of the barrier between the surface-self and those deeper levels  of personality where God is met and known “in our  nothingness,” and a mysterious fusion of divine and human life  takes place. The one, says the Christian mystic, is the “going  forth to the Father”; the other is the “marriage with the  Son.” Both are operated by the Spirit whose dwelling is in the  “spark of the soul.” Yet it is probable, in spite of the  spatial language which the mystics always use concerning them, that  these two experiences, in their most sublime forms, are but opposite  aspects of one whole: the complementary terms of a higher synthesis  beyond our span. In that consummation of love which Ruysbroeck has  called “the peace of the summits” they meet: then  distinctions between inward and outward, near and far, cease to have  any meaning, in “the dim silence where lovers lose  themselves.” “To mount to God,” says the writer of  “De Adhaerando Deo,” “is to enter into one’s  self. For he who inwardly entereth and intimately penetrateth into  himself, gets above and beyond himself and truly mounts up to  God.”   <a name="fr_634"></a><a href="#fn_634"><font size="1">635</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p24"></a>Says Tauler of this ineffable meeting-place, which is  to the intellect an emptiness, and to the heart a fulfillment of all  desire, “All there is so still and mysterious and so desolate:  for there is nothing there but God only, and nothing strange. . . .  This Wilderness is the Quiet Desert of the Godhead, into which He  leads all who are to receive this inspiration of God, now or in  Eternity.”   <a name="fr_635"></a><a href="#fn_635"><font size="1">636</font></a>
     From this “quiet desert,” this still plane of being, so  near to her though she is far from it, the normal self is separated by  all the “unquiet desert” of sensual existence. Yet it  stretches through and in her, the stuff of Reality, the very Ground of  her being, since it is, in Julian’s words, “the Substance  of all that is”: linking that <a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="green">p. 305</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_305"></a> being at once  with the universe and with God. “God is near us, but we are far  from Him, God is within, we are without, God is at home, we are in the  far country,” said Meister Eckhart, struggling to express the  nature of this “intelligible where.”   <a name="fr_636"></a><a href="#fn_636"><font size="1">637</font></a>
     Clearly, if the self is ever to become aware of it, definite work  must be undertaken, definite powers of perception must be trained: and  the consciousness which has been evolved to meet the exigencies of the  World of Becoming must be initiated into that World of Being from  which it came forth.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p27"></a>Plato long ago defined the necessity of such a  perception, and the nature of that art of contemplation by which the  soul can feed upon the Real, when he said in one of his most purely  mystical passages, “When the soul returns into itself and  reflects, it passes into . . . the region of that which is pure and  everlasting, immortal and unchangeable: and, feeling itself kindred  thereto, it dwells there under its own control, and has rest from its  wanderings.”   <a name="fr_637"></a><a href="#fn_637"><font size="1">638</font></a>
     In the “contemplation” of Plato and of the Platonic  Schools generally, however, the emphasis lies at least as much on  intellect as on intuition: with him the head and not the heart is the  meeting-place between man and the Real. “Anciently,” says  Augustine Baker, “there was a certain kind of false  contemplation, which we may call philosophical, practised by some  learned heathens of old, and imitated by some in these days, which  hath for its last and best end only the perfection of knowledge, and a  delightful complacency in it. . . . To this rank of philosophical  contemplations may be referred those scholastic wits which spend much  time in the study and subtle examination of the mysteries of faith,  and have not for their end the increasing of divine love in their  hearts.”   <a name="fr_638"></a><a href="#fn_638"><font size="1">639</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p30"></a>We cannot long read the works of the mystics without  coming across descriptions—often first-hand descriptions of  great psychological interest—of the processes through which the  self must pass, the discipline which it must undertake, in the course  of acquiring the art of contemplation. Most of these descriptions  differ in detail; in the divisions adopted, the emotions experienced,  the number of “degrees” through which the subject passes,  from the first painful attempt to gather up its faculties to the  supreme point at which it feels itself to be “lost in  God.” In each there is that quality of uniqueness which is  inherent in every expression of life: in each the temperamental bias  and analytical powers of the writer have exerted a further modifying  influence. All, however, describe a connected experience, the  progressive concentration of the entire self under the spur of love  upon the contemplation <a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="green">p. 306</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_306"></a> of transcendental reality.  As the Mystic Way involves transcendence of character, the sublimation  of the instinctive life and movement of the whole man to higher levels  of vitality, his attainment of freedom, so the ascent of the ladder of  contemplation involves such a transcendence, or movement to high  levels of liberty, of his perceptive powers.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p31"></a>The steps of the ladder, the substance of the  progressive exercises undertaken by the developing self, its education  in the art of contemplation, are usually know by the Christian mystics  as the “degrees of prayer” or “orison.” But  the common implications of the word “prayer,” with its  suggestions of formal devotion, detailed petition—a definite  something asked for, and a definite duty done, by means of extemporary  or traditional allocutions—do not really suggest the nature of  those supersensual activities which the mystics mean to express in  their use of this term.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p32"></a>Mystical prayer, or “orison”—the  term which I propose for the sake of clearness to use here—has  nothing in common with petition. It is not articulate; it has no  forms. “It is,” says “The Mirror of St.  Edmund,” “naught else but yearning of soul.”   <a name="fr_639"></a><a href="#fn_639"><font size="1">640</font></a>
    —the expression of man’s metaphysical thirst. In it, says  Grou, “the soul is united to God in its ground, the created  intelligence to the Intelligence Increate, without the intervention of  imagination or reason, or of anything but a very simple attention of  the mind and an equally simple application of the will.”   <a name="fr_640"></a><a href="#fn_640"><font size="1">641</font></a>
     On the psychological side its development involves a steady  discipline of the mystic’s rich subliminal mind, slowly  preparing the channels in which the deeper consciousness is to flow.  This discipline reduces to some sort of order, makes effective for  life, those involuntary states of passivity, rapture and intuition  which are the characteristic ways in which an uncontrolled,  uncultivated genius for the Absolute breaks out. To the subject  himself, however, his orison seems rather a free and mutual act of  love; a supernatural intercourse between the soul and the divine, or  some aspect of the divine, sometimes full of light and joy, sometimes  dark and bare.   <a name="fr_641"></a><a href="#fn_641"><font size="1">642</font></a>
     In some of its degrees it is a placid, trustful waiting upon messages  from without. In others, it is an inarticulate communion, a wordless  rapture, a silent gazing upon God. The mystics have exhausted all the  resources of all tongues in their efforts to tell us of the rewards  <a name="page_307"><font size="1" color="green">p. 307</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_307"></a> which await those who will undertake this most  sublime and difficult of arts.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p36"></a>As we come to know our friends better by having  intercourse with them, so by this deliberate intercourse the self  enters more and more deeply into the Heart of Reality. Climbing like  Dante step by step up the ladder of contemplation, it comes at last to  the Empyrean, <a name="an_iv.vi-p36.1"></a>“ivi è perfetta,  matura ed intera ciascuna disianza.”   <a name="fr_642"></a><a href="#fn_642"><font size="1">643</font></a>
     The true end of orison, like the true end of that mystical life  within which it flowers, is the supreme meeting between Lover and  Beloved, between God and the soul. Its method is the method of the  mystic life, transcendence: a gradual elimination of sensible image,  and bit by bit approximation of the contemplative self to reality,  gradually producing within it those conditions in which union can take  place. This entails a concentration, a turning inwards, of all those  faculties which the normal self has been accustomed to turn outwards,  and fritter upon the manifold illusions of daily life. It means,  during the hours of introversion, a retreat from and refusal of the  Many, in order that the mind may be able to apprehend the One.  “Behold,” says Boehme, “if thou desirest to see  God’s Light in thy Soul, and be divinely illuminated and  conducted, this is the short way that thou art to take; not to let the  Eye of thy Spirit enter into Matter or fill itself with any Thing  whatever, either in Heaven or Earth, but to let it enter by a naked  faith into the Light of the Majesty.”   <a name="fr_643"></a><a href="#fn_643"><font size="1">644</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p39"></a>“What this opening of the ghostly eye is,”  says Hilton, “the greatest clerk on earth could not imagine by  his wit, nor show fully by his tongue. For it may not be got by study  nor through man’s travail only, but principally by grace of the  Holy Ghost and with travail of man. I dread mickle to speak aught of  it, for me thinketh I cannot; it passeth mine assay, and my lips are  unclean. Nevertheless, for I expect love asketh and love biddeth,  therefore I shall say a little more of it as I hope love teacheth.  This opening of the ghostly eye is that lighty murkness and rich  nought that I spake of before, and it may be called:   <i>Purity of spirit and ghostly rest, inward stillness and peace of  conscience, highness of thought and onlyness of soul, a lively feeling  of grace and privily of heart, the waking sleep of the spouse and  tasting of heavenly savour burning in love and shining in light, entry  of contemplation and reforming in feeling . . .</i>    they are divers in showing of words, nevertheless they are all one in  sense of soothfastness.”   <a name="fr_644"></a><a href="#fn_644"><font size="1">645</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p41"></a>“Human industry,” says Hilton here, must  be joined to “grace.” If the spiritual eye is to be  opened, definite work must be done. So long as the “eye which  looks upon Time” fills itself with things <a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="green">p. 308</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_308"></a> and  usurps the conscious field, that spiritual eye which “looks upon  Eternity” can hardly act at all: and this eye must not only be  opened, it must be trained, so that it may endure to gaze steadfastly  at the Uncreated Light. This training and purging of the  transcendental sight is described under many images; “diverse in  showing of words, one in sense and soothfastness.” Its essence  is a progressive cleaning of the mirror, a progressive self-emptying  of all that is not real the attainment of that unified state of  consciousness which will permit a pure, imageless apprehension of the  final Reality which “hath no image” to be received by the  self. “Naked orison,” “emptiness,”  “nothingness,” “entire surrender,”  “peaceful love in life naughted,” say the mystics again  and again. Where apprehension of the divine comes by way of vision or  audition, this is but a concession to human weakness; a sign, they  think, that “sensitive nature” is not yet wholly  transcended. It is a translation of the true tongue of angels into a  dialect that the normal mind can understand. A steady abolition of  sense imagery, a cutting off of all possible sources of illusion, all  possible encouragements of selfhood and pride—the most fertile  of all sources of deception—this is the condition of pure sight;  and the “degrees of orison,” the “steep stairs of  love” which they climb so painfully, are based upon this  necessity.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p42"></a>The terms used by individual mystics, the divisions  which they adopt in describing the self’s progress in  contemplation, are bewildering in their variety. Here, more than  elsewhere, the mania for classification has obsessed them. We find,  too, when we come to compare one with another, that the language which  they employ is not always so exact as it seems: nor are traditional  terms always used in the same sense. Sometimes by the word  “contemplation” they intend to describe the whole process  of introversion: sometimes they reserve it for the “orison of  union,” sometimes identify it with ecstasy. It has been pointed  out by Delacroix that even St. Teresa’s classification of her  own states is far from lucid, and varies in each of her principal  works.   <a name="fr_645"></a><a href="#fn_645"><font size="1">646</font></a>
     Thus in the “Life” she appears to treat Recollection and  Quiet as synonymous, whilst in “The Way of Perfection”  these conditions are sharply differentiated. In “The Interior  Castle” she adopts an entirely different system; the prayer of  quiet being there called “tasting of God.”   <a name="fr_646"></a><a href="#fn_646"><font size="1">647</font></a>
     Finally, Augustine Baker, in treating of the “Prayer of  Interior Silence and Quiet,” insists that by the term  “Quiet” St. Teresa did not mean this at all, but a form of  “supernatural contemplation.”   <a name="fr_647"></a><a href="#fn_647"><font size="1">648</font></a>
     <a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="green">p. 309</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_309"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p46"></a>Thus we are gradually forced to the conclusion that  the so-called “degrees of orison” so neatly tabulated by  ascetic writers are largely artificial and symbolic: that the process  which they profess to describe is really, like life itself, one and  continuous—not a stairway but a slope—and the parts into  which they break it up are diagrammatic. Nearly every mystic makes  these breaks in a different place, though continuing to use the  language of his predecessors. In his efforts towards self-analysis he  divides and subdivides, combines and differentiates his individual  moods. Hence the confusion of mind which falls upon those who try to  harmonize different systems of contemplation: to identify St.  Teresa’s “Four Degrees”   <a name="fr_648"></a><a href="#fn_648"><font size="1">649</font></a>
     with Hugh of St. Victor’s other four,   <a name="fr_649"></a><a href="#fn_649"><font size="1">650</font></a>
     and with Richard of St. Victor’s “four steps of ardent  love”:   <a name="fr_650"></a><a href="#fn_650"><font size="1">651</font></a>
     or to accommodate upon this diagram Hilton’s simple and poetic  “three steps of contemplations—Knowing, Loving, and  Knowing-and-Loving—where the adventurer rather than the  map-maker speaks. Such fine shades, says Augustine Baker in this  connection, are “nicely distinguished” by the author  “rather out of a particular experience of the effects passing in  his own soul   <a name="fr_651"></a><a href="#fn_651"><font size="1">652</font></a>
     which perhaps are not the same in all” than for any more  general reason.   <a name="fr_652"></a><a href="#fn_652"><font size="1">653</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p52"></a>Some diagram, however, some set scheme, the writer on  introversion must have, if he is to describe with lucidity the normal  development of the contemplative consciousness: and so long as the  methodological nature of this diagram is kept in mind, there can be  little objection to the use of it. I propose then to examine under  three divisions that continuous and orderly growth, that gradual  process of change, by which the mystical consciousness matures, and  develops its apprehension of God. We will give to these three  divisions names familiar to all readers of ascetic literature:  Recollection, Quiet, and Contemplation. Each of these three parts of  the introversive experience may be discerned in embryo in that little  experiment at which the reader has been invited to assist: the act of  concentration, the silence, the new perception which results. Each has  a characteristic beginning which links it with its predecessor, and a  characteristic end which shades off into the next state. Thus  Recollection commonly begins in Meditation and develops into the  “Orison of Inward Silence or Simplicity,” which again  melts into the true “Quiet.” “Quiet” as it  becomes deeper passes into Ordinary Contemplation: and this <a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="green">p. 310</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_310"></a> grows through Contemplation proper to that Orison of  Passive Union which is the highest of the non-ecstatic introversive  states. Merely to state the fact thus is to remind ourselves how  smoothly continuous is this life-process of the soul.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p53"></a>It is the object of contemplative prayer, as it is the  object of all education, to discipline and develop certain growing  faculties. Here, the faculties are those of the “transcendental  self,” the “new man”—all those powers which we  associate with the “spiritual consciousness.” The  “Sons of God,” however, like the sons of men, begin as  babies; and their first lessons must not be too hard. Therefore the  educative process conforms to and takes advantage of every step of the  natural process of growth: as we, in the education of our children,  make the natural order in which their faculties develop the basis of  our scheme of cultivation. Recollection, Quiet, and Contemplation,  then, answer to the order in which the mystic’s powers unfold.  Roughly speaking, we shall find that the form of spiritual attention  which is called “Meditative” or “Recollective”  goes side by side with the Purification of the Self; that  “Quiet” tends to be characteristic of Illumination; that  Contemplation proper—at any rate in its higher forms—is  most fully experienced by those who have attained, or nearly attained,  the Unitive Way. At the same time, just as the self in its  “first mystic life,” before it has passed through the dark  night of the spirit, often seems to run through the whole gamut of  spiritual states, and attain that immediate experience of the Absolute  which it seeks—though as a fact it has not reached those higher  levels of consciousness on which true and permanent union takes  place—so too in its orison. At any point in its growth it may  experience for brief periods that imageless and overpowering sense of  identity with the Absolute Life—that loving and exalted  absorption in God—which is called “passive union,”  and anticipates the consciousness which is characteristic of the  unitive life. Over and over again in its “prayerful  process” it recapitulates in little the whole great process of  its life. It runs up for an instant to levels where it is not yet  strong enough to dwell: “seeks God in its ground” and  finds that which it seeks. Therefore we must not be too strict in our  identification of the grades of education with the stages of  growth.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p54"></a>This education, rightly understood, is one coherent  process: it consists in a steady and voluntary surrender of the  awakened consciousness, its feeling, thought, and will, to the play of  those transcendental influences, that inflowing vitality, which it  conceives of as divine. In the preparative process of Recollection,  the unruly mind is brought into subjection. In “Quiet” the  eager will is silenced, the “wheel of imagination” is  stilled. In Contemplation, <a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="green">p. 311</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_311"></a> the heart at last comes  to its own—<a name="an_iv.vi-p54.1"></a>   <i>Cor ad cor loquitur</i>     .    In their simplest forms, these three states involve the deliberate  concentration upon, the meek resting in, the joyous communing with,  the ineffable Object of man’s quest. They require a progressive  concentration of the mystic’s powers, a gradual handing over of  the reins from the surface intelligence to the deeper mind; that  essential self which alone is capable of God. In Recollection the  surface-mind still holds, so to speak, the leading strings: but in  “Quiet” it surrenders them wholly, allowing consciousness  to sink into that “blissful silence in which God works and  speaks.” This act of surrender, this deliberate negation of  thought, is an essential preliminary of the contemplative state.  “Lovers put out the candles and draw the curtains when they wish  to see the god and the goddess; and in the higher communion the night  of thought is the light of perception.”   <a name="fr_653"></a><a href="#fn_653"><font size="1">654</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p56"></a>The education of the self in the successive degrees of  orison has been compared by St. Teresa, in a celebrated passage in her  Life, to four ways of watering the garden of the soul so that it may  bring forth its flowers and fruits.   <a name="fr_654"></a><a href="#fn_654"><font size="1">655</font></a>
     The first and most primitive of these ways is meditation. This, she  says, is like drawing water by hand from a deep well: the slowest and  most laborious of all means of irrigation. Next to this is the orison  of quiet, which is a little better and easier: for here soul seems to  receive some help,   <i>i.e.</i>   , with the stilling of the senses the subliminal faculties are brought  into play. The well has now been fitted with a windlass—that  little Moorish water-wheel possessed by every Castilian farm. Hence we  get more water for the energy we expend: more sense of reality in  exchange for our abstraction from the unreal. Also “the water is  higher, and accordingly the labour is much less than it was when the  water had to be drawn out of the depths of the well. I mean that the  water is nearer to it, for grace now reveals itself more distinctly to  the soul.” In the third stage, or orison of union, we leave all  voluntary activities of the mind: the gardener no longer depends on  his own exertions, contact between subject and object is established,  there is no more stress and strain. It is as if a little river now ran  through our garden and watered it. We have but to direct the stream.  In the fourth and highest stage, God Himself waters our garden with  rain from heaven “drop by drop.” The attitude of the self  is now that of perfect receptivity, “passive  contemplation,” loving trust. Individual activity is sunk in the  “great life of the All.”   <a name="fr_655"></a><a href="#fn_655"><font size="1">656</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p59"></a>The measure of the mystic’s real progress is and  must always <a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="green">p. 312</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_312"></a> be his progress in love; for his  apprehension is an apprehension of the heart. His education, his  watering of the garden of the soul, is a cultivation of this one  flower—this Rosa Mystica which has its root in God. His advance  in contemplation, then, will be accompanied step by step by those  exalted feeling-states which Richard of St. Victor called the Degrees  of Ardent Love. Without their presence, all the drill in the world  will not bring him to the time contemplative state; though it may  easily produce abnormal powers of perception of the kind familiar to  students of the occult.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p60"></a>Thus our theory of mystic education is in close accord  with our theory of mystic life. In both, there is a progressive  surrender of selfhood under the steady advance of conquering love; a  stilling of that “I, Me, and Mine,” which is linked by all  the senses, and by all its own desires, to the busy world of visible  things. This progressive surrender usually appears in the practice of  orison as a progressive inward retreat from circumference to centre,  to that ground of the soul, that substantial   <i>somewhat</i>    in man, deep buried for most of us beneath the great rubbish heap of  our surface-interests, where human life and divine life meet. To clear  away the rubbish-heap so that he may get down to this treasure-house  is from one point of view the initial task of the contemplative. This  clearing away is the first part of “introversion”: that  journey inwards to his own centre where, stripped of all his  cleverness and merit, reduced to his “nothingness,” he can  “meet God without intermediary.” This ground of the soul,  this strange inward sanctuary to which the normal man so seldom  penetrates, is, says Eckhart, “immediately receptive of the  Divine Being,” and “no one can move it but God  alone.”   <a name="fr_656"></a><a href="#fn_656"><font size="1">657</font></a>
     There the finite self encounters the Infinite; and, by a close and  loving communion with and feeding on the attributes of the Divine  Substance, is remade in the interests of the Absolute Life. This  encounter, the consummation of mystical culture, is what we mean by  contemplation in its highest form. Here we are on the verge of that  great self-merging act which is of the essence of pure love: which  Reality has sought of us, and we have unknowingly desired of It. Here  contemplation and union are one. “Thus do we grow,” says  Ruysbroeck, “and, carried above ourselves, above reason, into  the very heart of love, there do we feed according to the spirit; and  taking flight for the Godhead by naked love, we go to the encounter of  the Bridegroom, to the encounter of His Spirit, which is His love; and  thus we are brought forth by God, out of <a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="green">p. 313</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_313"></a> our  selfhood, into the immersion of love, in which we possess blessedness  and are one with God.”   <a name="fr_657"></a><a href="#fn_657"><font size="1">658</font></a>
  </p>   <h4 align="center"><a name="an_iv.vi-p62.1"></a>Recollection</h4>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p63"></a>The beginning of the process of introversion, the  first deliberate act in which the self turns towards the inward path,  will not merely be the yielding to an instinct, the indulgence of a  natural taste for reverie; it will be a voluntary and purposeful  undertaking. Like conversion, it entails a break with the obvious,  which must, of necessity, involve and affect the whole normal  consciousness. It will be evoked by the mystic’s love, and  directed by his reason; but can only be accomplished by the strenuous  exercise of his will. These preparatory labours of the contemplative  life—these first steps upon the ladder—are, says St.  Teresa, very hard, and require greater courage than all the rest.   <a name="fr_658"></a><a href="#fn_658"><font size="1">659</font></a>
     All the scattered interests of the self have here to be collected;  there must be a deliberate and unnatural act of attention, a  deliberate expelling of all discordant images from the consciousness a  hard and ungrateful task. Since the transcendental faculties are still  young and weak, the senses not wholly mortified, it needs a stern  determination, a “wilful choice,” if we are to succeed in  concentrating our attention upon the whispered messages from within,  undistracted by the loud voices which besiege us from without.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p65"></a>“How,” says the Disciple to the Master in  one of Boehme’s “Dialogues,” “am I to seek in  the Centre this Fountain of Light which may enlighten me throughout  and bring my properties into perfect harmony? I am in Nature, as I  said before, and which way shall I pass through Nature and the light  thereof, so that I may come into the supernatural and supersensual  ground whence this true Light, which is the Light of Minds, doth  arise; and this without the destruction of my nature, or quenching the  Light of it, which is my reason?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p66"></a>  <i>“Master.</i>    Cease but from thine own activity, steadfastly fixing thine Eye upon   <i>one Point. . . .</i>    For this end, gather in all thy thoughts, and by faith press into the  Centre, laying hold upon the Word of God, which is infallible and  which hath called thee. Be thou obedient to this call, and be silent  before the Lord, sitting alone with Him in thy inmost and most hidden  cell, thy mind being centrally united in itself, and attending His  Will in the patience of hope. So shall thy Light break forth as the  morning, and after the redness thereof is passed, the Sun himself,  which thou waitest for, shall arise unto thee, and under his most  healing wings thou shalt greatly rejoice: ascending and descending in  <a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="green">p. 314</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_314"></a> his bright and health-giving beams. Behold, this is  the true Supersensual Ground of Life.”   <a name="fr_659"></a><a href="#fn_659"><font size="1">660</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p68"></a>In this short paragraph Boehme has caught and  described the psychological state in which all introversion must  begin: the primary simplification of consciousness, steadfastly fixing  the soul’s eye upon   <i>one point,</i>    and the turning inwards of the whole conative powers for a purpose  rather believed in than known, “by faith pressing into the  centre.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p69"></a>The unfortunate word   <i>Recollection,</i>    which the hasty reader is apt to connect with remembrance, is the  traditional term by which mystical writers define just such a  voluntary concentration, such a first collecting or gathering in of  the attention of the self to its “most hidden cell.” That  self is as yet unacquainted with the strange plane of silence which so  soon becomes familiar to those who attempt even the lowest activities  of the contemplative life, where the self is released from succession,  the noises of the world are never heard, and the great adventures of  the spirit take place. It stands here between the two planes of its  being; the Eye of Time is still awake. It knows that it wants to enter  the inner world, that “interior palace where the King of Kings  is guest”:   <a name="fr_660"></a><a href="#fn_660"><font size="1">661</font></a>
     but it must find some device to help it over the  threshold—rather, in the language of psychology, to shift that  threshold and permit its subliminal intuition of the Absolute to  emerge.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p71"></a>This device is as a rule the practice of meditation,  in which the state of Recollection usually begins: that is to say, the  deliberate consideration of and dwelling upon some one aspect of  Reality—an aspect most usually chosen from amongst the religious  beliefs of the self. Thus Hindu mystics will brood upon a sacred word,  whilst Christian contemplatives set before their minds one of the  names or attributes of God, a fragment of Scripture, an incident of  the life of Christ; and allow—indeed encourage—this  consideration and the ideas and feelings which flow from it, to occupy  the whole mental field. This powerful suggestion, kept before the  consciousness by an act of will, overpowers the stream of small  suggestions which the outer world pours incessantly upon the mind. The  self, concentrated upon this image or idea, dwelling on it more than  thinking about it—as one may gaze upon a picture that one  loves—falls gradually and insensibly into the condition of  reverie; and, protected by this holy day-dream from the more  distracting dream of life, sinks into itself, and becomes in the  language of asceticism “recollected” or gathered together.  Although it is deliberately ignoring the whole of its usual  “external universe,” its faculties are wide awake: all  have had their part in <a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="green">p. 315</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_315"></a> the wilful production of  this state of consciousness: and this it is which marks off meditation  and recollection from the higher or “infused” degrees of  orison.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p72"></a>Such meditation as this, says Richard of St. Victor,  is the activity proper to one who has attained the first degree of  ardent love. By it, “God enters into the mind,” and  “the mind also enters into itself”; and thus receives in  its inmost cell the “first visit of the Beloved.” It is a  kind of half-way house between the perception of Appearance and the  perception of Reality. To one in whom this state is established  consciousness seems like a blank field, save for the “one  point” in its centre, the subject of the meditation. Towards  this focus the introversive self seems to press inwards from every  side; still faintly conscious of the buzz of the external world  outside its ramparts, but refusing to respond to its appeals.  Presently the subject of meditation begins to take on a new  significance; to glow with life and light. The contemplative suddenly  feels that he knows it; in the complete, vital, but indescribable way  in which one knows a friend. More, through it hints are coming to him  of mightier, nameless things. It ceases to be a picture, and becomes a  window through which the mystic peers out into the spiritual universe,  and apprehends to some extent—though how, he knows not—the  veritable presence of God.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p73"></a>In these meditative and recollective states, the self  still feels very clearly the edge of its own personality: its  separateness from the Somewhat Other, the divine reality set over  against the soul. It is aware of that reality: the subject of its  meditation becomes a symbol through which it receives a distinct  message from the transcendental world. But it is still operating in a  natural way—as mystical writers would say, “by means of  the faculties.” There is yet no conscious fusion with a greater  Life; no resting in the divine atmosphere, as in the  “Quiet”; no involuntary and ecstatic lifting up of the  soul to direct apprehension of truth, as in contemplation.  Recollection is a definite psychic condition, which has logical  psychic results. Originally induced by meditation, or absorbed  brooding upon certain aspects of the Real, it develops in the Self, by  way of the strenuous control exercised by the will over the  understanding, a power of cutting its connection with the external  world, and retreating to the inner world of the spirit.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p74"></a>“True recollection,” says St. Teresa,  “has characteristics by which it can be easily recognized. It  produces a certain effect which I do not know how to explain, but  which is well understood by those who have experienced it. . . . It is  true that recollection has several degrees, and that in the beginning  these great effects <a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="green">p. 316</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_316"></a> are not felt, because it is not  yet profound enough. But support the pain which you first feel in  recollecting yourself, despise the rebellion of nature, overcome the  resistance of the body, which loves a liberty which is its ruin, learn  self-conquest, persevere thus for a time, and you will perceive very  clearly the advantages which you gain from it. As soon as you apply  yourself to orison, you will at once feel your senses gather  themselves together: they seem like bees which return to the hive and  there shut themselves up to work at the making of honey: and this will  take place without effort or care on your part. God thus rewards the  violence which your soul has been doing to itself; and gives to it  such a domination over the senses that a sign is enough when it  desires to recollect itself, for them to obey and so gather themselves  together. At the first call of the will, they come back more and more  quickly. At last, after countless exercises of this kind, God disposes  them to a state of utter rest and of perfect contemplation.”   <a name="fr_661"></a><a href="#fn_661"><font size="1">662</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p76"></a>This description makes it clear that  “recollection” is a form of spiritual gymnastics; less  valuable for itself than for the training which it gives, the powers  which it develops. In it, says St. Teresa again, the soul enters with  its God into that Paradise which is within itself, and shuts the door  behind it upon all the things of the world. “You should know, my  daughters,” she continues, “that this is no supernatural  act, but depends upon our will, and that therefore we can do it with  that ordinary assistance of God which we need for all our acts and  even for our good thoughts. For here we are not concerned with the  silence of the faculties, but with a simple retreat of these powers  into the ground of the soul. There are various ways of arriving at it,  and these ways are described in different books. There it is said that  we must abstract the mind from exterior things, in order that we may  inwardly approach God: that even in our work we ought to retire within  ourselves, though it be only for a moment: that this remembrance of a  God who companions us within, is a great help to us; finally, that we  ought little by little to habituate ourselves to gentle and silent  converse with Him, so that He may make us feel His presence in the  soul.”   <a name="fr_662"></a><a href="#fn_662"><font size="1">663</font></a>
  </p>   <h4 align="center"><a name="an_iv.vi-p77.1"></a>Quiet</h4>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p78"></a>More important for us, because more characteristically  mystical, is the next great stage of orison: that curious and  extremely definite mental state which mystics call the Prayer of Quiet  or Simplicity, or sometimes the Interior Silence. This represents  <a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="green">p. 317</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_317"></a> the result for consciousness of a further degree of  that inward retreat which Recollection began.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p79"></a>Out of the deep, slow brooding and pondering on some  mystery, some incomprehensible link between himself and the Real, or  the deliberate practice of loving attention to God, the  contemplative—perhaps by way of a series of moods and acts which  his analytic powers may cause him “nicely to  distinguish”—glides, almost insensibly, on to a plane of  perception for which human speech has few equivalents. It is a plane  which is apparently characterized by an immense increase in the  receptivity of the self and by an almost complete suspension of the  reflective powers. The strange silence which is the outstanding  quality of this state—almost the only note in regard to it which  the surface-intelligence can secure—is not describable. Here, as  Samuel Rutherford said of another of life’s secrets,   <i>“Come and see</i>    willtell you much:   <i>come nearer</i>    will say more.” Here the self passes beyond the stage at which  its perceptions are capable of being dealt with by thought. It can no  longer “take notes”: can only surrender itself to the  stream of an inflowing life, and to the direction of a larger will.  Discursive thought would only interfere with this process: as it  interferes with the vital processes of the body if it once gets them  under its control. That thought, then, already disciplined by  Recollection, gathered up, and forced to work in the interests of the  transcendental mind, is now to be entirely inhibited.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p80"></a>As Recollection becomes deeper, the self slides into a  certain dim yet vivid consciousness of the Infinite. The door tight  shut on the sensual world, it becomes aware that it is immersed in a  more real world which it cannot define. It rests quietly in this  awareness: quite silent, utterly at peace. In the place of the  struggles for complete concentration which mark the beginning of  Recollection, there is now “a living, somehow self-acting  recollection—with God, His peace, power, and presence, right in  the midst of this rose of spiritual fragrance.”   <a name="fr_663"></a><a href="#fn_663"><font size="1">664</font></a>
     With this surrender to something bigger, as with the surrender of  conversion, comes an immense relief of strain. This is  “Quiet” in its most perfect form: this sinking, as it  were, of the little child of the Infinite into its Father’s  arms. The giving up of I-hood, the process of self-stripping, which we  have seen to be the essence of the purification of the self, finds its  parallel in this phase of the contemplative experience. Here, in this  complete cessation of man’s proud effort to do somewhat of  himself, Humility, who rules the Fourth Degree of Love, begins to be  known in her paradoxical beauty and power. Consciousness loses to  find, and dies that it may live. No longer, in Rolle’s pungent  phrase, is it a “Raunsaker of the myghte <a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="green">p. 318</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_318"></a> of  Godd and of His Majeste.”   <a name="fr_664"></a><a href="#fn_664"><font size="1">665</font></a>
     Thus the act by which it passes into the Quiet is a sacrament of the  whole mystic quest: of the turning from doing to being, the abolition  of separateness in the interests of the Absolute Life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p83"></a>The state of “Quiet,” we have said,  entails suspension of the surface-consciousness: yet consciousness of  the subject’s personality remains. It follows, generally, on a  period of deliberate and loving recollection, of a slow and steady  withdrawal of the attention from the channels of sense. To one who is  entering this state, the external world seems to get further and  further away: till at last nothing but the paramount fact of his own  existence remains. So startling, very often, is the deprivation of all  his accustomed mental furniture, of the noise and flashing of the  transmitting instruments of sense, that the negative aspect of his  condition dominates consciousness; and he can but describe it as a  nothingness, a pure passivity, an emptiness, a “naked”  orison. He is there, as it were poised, resting, waiting, he does not  know for what: only he is conscious that all, even in this utter  emptiness, is well. Presently, however, he becomes aware that   <i>Something</i>    fills this emptiness; something omnipresent, intangible, like sunny  air. Ceasing to attend to the messages from without, he begins to  notice That which has always been within. His whole being is thrown  open to its influence: it permeates his consciousness.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p84"></a>There are, then, two aspects of the Orison of Quiet:  the aspect of deprivation, of emptiness which begins it, and the  aspect of acquisition, of something found, in which it is complete. In  its description, all mystics will be found to lean to one side or the  other, to the affirmative or negative element which it contains. The  austere mysticism of Eckhart and his followers, their temperamental  sympathy with the Neoplatonic language of Dionysius the Areopagite,  caused them to describe it and also very often the higher state of  contemplation to which it leads—as above all things an  emptiness, a divine dark, an ecstatic deprivation. They will not  profane its deep satisfactions by the inadequate terms proper to  earthly peace and joy: and, true to their school, fall back on the  paradoxically suggestive powers of negation. To St. Teresa, and  mystics of her type, on the other hand, even a little and inadequate  image of its joy seems better than none. To them it is a sweet calm, a  gentle silence, in which the lover apprehends the presence of the  Beloved: a God-given state over which the self has little control.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p85"></a>In Eckhart’s writings enthusiastic descriptions  of the Quiet, of inward silence and passivity as the fruit of a  deliberate recollection, abound. In his view, the psychical state of  Quiet is preeminently <a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="green">p. 319</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_319"></a> that in which the soul of man  begins to be united with its “ground,” Pure Being. It  marks the transition from “natural” to  “supernatural” prayer. The emptying of the field of  consciousness, its cleansing of all images—even of those symbols  of Reality which are the objects of meditation—is the necessary  condition under which alone this encounter can take place.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p86"></a>“The soul,” he says, “with all its  powers, has divided and scattered itself in outward things, each  according to its functions: the power of sight in the eye, the power  of hearing in the ear, the power of taste in the tongue, and thus they  are the less able to work inwardly, for every power which is divided  is imperfect. So the soul, if she would work inwardly, must call home  all her powers and collect them from all divided things to one inward  work. . . . If a man will work an inward work, he must pour all his  powers into himself as into a corner of the soul, and must hide  himself from all images and forms, and then he can work. Then he must  come into a forgetting and a not-knowing. He must be in a stillness  and silence, where the Word may be heard. One cannot draw near to this  Word better than by stillness and silence: then it is heard and  understood in utter ignorance. When one knows nothing, it is opened  and revealed. Then we shall become aware of the Divine Ignorance, and  our ignorance will be ennobled and adorned with supernatural  knowledge. And when we simply keep ourselves receptive, we are more  perfect than when at work.”   <a name="fr_665"></a><a href="#fn_665"><font size="1">666</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p88"></a>The psychic state of Quiet has a further value for the  mystic, as being the intellectual complement and expression of the  moral state of humility and receptivity: the very condition, says  Eckhart, of the New Birth. “It may be asked whether this Birth  is best accomplished in Man when he does the work and   <i>forms and thinks himself into God,</i>    or when he keeps himself in Silence, stillness and peace, so that God  may speak and work in him; . . . the best and noblest way in which  thou mayst come into this work and life is by keeping silence, and  letting God work and speak. When all the powers are withdrawn from  their work and images, there is this word spoken.”   <a name="fr_666"></a><a href="#fn_666"><font size="1">667</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p90"></a>Eckhart’s view of the primary importance of  “Quiet” as essentially the introverted state is shared by  all those mediaeval mystics who lay stress on the psychological rather  than the objective aspect of the spiritual life. They regard it as the  necessary preliminary of all contemplation; and describe it as a  normal phase of the inner experience, possible of attainment by all  those who have sufficiently disciplined themselves in patience,  recollection, and humility.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p91"></a>In an old English mystical tract by the author of  “The Cloud <a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="green">p. 320</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_320"></a> of Unknowing” there is a  curious and detailed instruction on the disposition of mind proper to  this orison of silence. It clearly owes much to the teaching of the  Areopagite, and something surely—if we may judge by its vivid  and exact instructions—to personal experience. “When thou  comest by thyself,” says the master to the disciple for whom  this “pystle” was composed, “think not before what  thou shalt do after: but forsake as well good thoughts as evil  thoughts, and pray not with thy mouth, but lift thee right well. . . .  And look that nothing live in thy working mind but a naked intent  stretching unto God, not clothed in any special thought of God in  thyself, how He is in Himself or in any of His works, but only that He  is as He is. Let Him be so, I pray thee, and make Him on none  otherwise speech, nor search in Him by subtilty of wit: but   <i>believe by thy ground.</i>    This naked intent freely fastened and grounded by very belief, shall  be nought else to thy thought and thy feeling but a naked thought and  a blind feeling of thine own being. . . . That darkness be thy mirror  and thy mind whole. Think no further of thyself than I bid thee do of  thy God, so that thou be oned with Him in spirit as in thought,  without departing and scattering, for He is thy being and in Him thou  art that thou art: not only by cause and by being, but also He is in  thee both thy cause and thy being. And therefore think on God as in  this work as thou dost on thyself, and on thyself as thou dost on God,  that He is as He is, and thou art as thou art, and that thy thought be  not scattered nor departed but privied in Him that is All.”   <a name="fr_667"></a><a href="#fn_667"><font size="1">668</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p93"></a>“Let Him be so, I pray thee!” It is an  admonition against spiritual worry, an entreaty to the individual,  already at work twisting experience to meet his own conceptions, to  let things be as they are, to receive and be content. Leave off doing,  that you may be. Leave off analysis, that you may know. “That  meek darkness be thy mirror”—humble receptivity is the  watchword of this state. “In this,” says Eckhart finely,  “the soul is of equal capacity with God. As God is boundless in  giving, so the soul is boundless in receiving. And as God is almighty  in His work, se the soul is an abyss of receptivity: and so she is  formed anew with God and in God. . . . The disciples of St. Dionysius  asked him why Timotheus surpassed them all in perfection. Then said  Dionysius, ‘Timotheus is receptive of God.’ And thus thine  ignorance is not a defect but thy highest perfection, and thine  inactivity thy highest work. And so in this work thou must bring all  thy works to nought and all thy powers into silence, if thou wilt in  truth experience this birth within thyself.”   <a name="fr_668"></a><a href="#fn_668"><font size="1">669</font></a>
     <a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="green">p. 321</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_321"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p95"></a>It is interesting to contrast these descriptions of  the Quiet with St. Teresa’s subjective account of the same  psychological state. Where the English mystic’s teaching is full  of an implied appeal to the will, the Spanish saint is all for the  involuntary, or, as she would call it, the “supernatural”  actions of the soul. “This true orison of quiet,” she  says, “has in it an element of the supernatural. We cannot, in  spite of all our efforts, procure it for ourselves. It is a sort of  peace in which the soul establishes herself, or rather in which God  establishes the soul, as He did the righteous Simeon. All her powers  are at rest. She understands, but otherwise than by the senses, that  she is already near her God, and that if she draws a little nearer,  she will become by union one with Him. She does not see this with the  eyes of the body, nor with the eyes of the soul. . . . It is like the  repose of a traveller who, within sight of the goal stops to take  breath, and then continues with new strength upon his way. One feels a  great bodily comfort, a great satisfaction of soul: such is the  happiness of the soul in seeing herself close to the spring, that even  without drinking of the waters she finds herself refreshed. It seems  to her that she wants nothing more: the faculties which are at rest  would like always to remain still, for the least of their movements is  able to trouble or prevent her love. Those who are in this orison wish  their bodies to remain motionless, for it seems to them that at the  least movement they will lose this sweet peace . . . they are in the  palace close to their King, and they see that He begins to give them  His kingdom. It seems to them that they are no longer in the world,  and they wish neither to hear nor to see it, but only God. . . . There  is this difference between the orison of quiet and that in which the  whole soul is united to God; that in this last the soul has not to  absorb the Divine Food. God deposits it with her, she knows not how.  The orison of quiet, on the other hand, demands, it seems to me, a  slight effort; but it is accompanied by so much sweetness that one  hardly feels it.”   <a name="fr_669"></a><a href="#fn_669"><font size="1">670</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p97"></a>“A slight effort,” says St. Teresa.  “A naked intent stretching,” says the “Pystle of  Private Counsel.” These words mark the frontier between the true  and healthy mystic state of “Quiet” and its morbid  perversion in “Quietism”: the difference between the tense  stillness of the athlete and the limp passivity of the sluggard, who  is really lazy, though he looks resigned. True “Quiet” is  a means, not an end: is actively embraced, not passively endured. It  is a phase in the self’s growth in contemplation; a bridge which  leads from its old and uncoordinated life of activity to its new  unified life of deep action—the real “mystic life”  of man. This <a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="green">p. 322</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_322"></a> state is desired by the mystic, not in  order that consciousness may remain a blank, but in order that the  “Word which is Alive” may be written thereon. Too often,  however, this fact has been ignored; and the Interior Silence has been  put by wayward transcendentalists to other and less admirable use.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p98"></a>“Quiet” is the danger-zone of  introversion. Of all forms of mystical activity, perhaps this has been  the most abused, the least understood. Its theory, seized upon,  divorced from its context, and developed to excess, produced the  foolish and dangerous exaggerations of Quietism: and these, in their  turn, caused a wholesale condemnation of the principle of passivity,  and made many superficial persons regard “naked orison” as  an essentially heretical act.   <a name="fr_670"></a><a href="#fn_670"><font size="1">671</font></a>
     The accusation of Quietism has been hurled at mystics whose only  fault was a looseness of language which laid them open to  misapprehension. Others, however, have certainly contrived, by a  perversion and isolation of the teachings of great contemplatives on  this point, to justify the deliberate production of a half-hypnotic  state of passivity. With this meaningless state of “absorption  in nothing at all” they were content; claiming that in it they  were in touch with the divine life, and therefore exempt from the  usual duties and limitations of human existence.  “Quietism,” usually, and rather unfairly, regarded as the  special folly of Madame Guyon and her disciples, already existed in a  far more dangerous form in the Middle Ages: and was described and  denounced by Ruysbroeck, one of the greatest masters of true  introversion whom the Christian world has known.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p100"></a>“Such quietude,” he says, “is nought  else but idleness, into which a man has fallen, and in which he  forgets himself and God and all things in all that has to do with  activity. This repose is wholly contrary to the supernatural repose  one possesses in God; for that is a loving self-mergence and simple  gazing at the Incomprehensible Brightness; actively sought with inward  desire, and found in fruitive inclination. . . . When a man possesses  this rest in false idleness, and all loving adherence seems a  hindrance to him, he clings to himself in his quietude and lives  contrary to the first way in which man is united with God; and this is  the beginning of all ghostly error.”   <a name="fr_671"></a><a href="#fn_671"><font size="1">672</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p102"></a>There can be no doubt that for selves of a certain  psychical constitution, such a “false idleness” is only  too easy of attainment. They can by wilful self-suggestion  deliberately produce this emptiness, this inward silence, and  luxuriate in its peaceful effects. To do this from self-regarding  motives, or to do it to excess—to let <a name="page_323"><font size="1" color="green">p. 323</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_323"></a>  “peaceful enjoyment” swamp “active  love”—is a mystical vice: and this perversion of the  spiritual faculties, like perversion of the natural faculties, brings  degeneration in its train. It leads to the absurdities of “holy  indifference,” and ends in the complete stultification of the  mental and moral life. The true mystic never tries deliberately to  enter the orison of quiet: with St. Teresa, he regards it as a  supernatural gift, beyond his control, though fed by his will and  love. That is to say, where it exists in a healthy form, it appears  spontaneously, as a phase in normal development; not as a self-induced  condition, a psychic trick.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p103"></a>The balance to be struck in this stage of introversion  can only be expressed, it seems, in paradox. The true condition of  quiet according to the great mystics, is at once active and passive:  it is pure surrender, but a surrender which is not limp  self-abandonment, but rather the free and constantly renewed  self-giving and self-emptying of a burning love. The departmental  intellect is silenced, but the totality of character is flung open to  the influence of the Real. Personality is not lost: only its hard edge  is gone. A “rest most busy,” says Hilton. Like the soaring  of an eagle, says Augustine Baker, when “the flight is continued  for a good space with a great swiftness, but withal with great  stillness, quietness and ease, without any waving of the wings at all,  or the least force used in any member, being in as much ease and  stillness as if she were reposing in her nest.”   <a name="fr_672"></a><a href="#fn_672"><font size="1">673</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p105"></a>“According to the unanimous teaching of the most  experienced and explicit of the specifically Theistic and Christian  mystics,” says Von Hügel, “the appearance, the  soul’s own impression, of a cessation of life and energy of the  soul in periods of special union with God, or of great advance in  spirituality, is an appearance only. Indeed this, at such times  strong, impression of rest springs most certainly from an unusually  large amount of actualized energy, an energy which is now penetrating,  and finding expression by ever pore and fibre of the soul. The whole  moral and spiritual creature expands and rests, yes; but this very  rest is produced by Action, ‘unperceived because so fleet, so  near, so all-fulfilling.’”   <a name="fr_673"></a><a href="#fn_673"><font size="1">674</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p107"></a>The great teachers of Quietism, having arrived at and  experienced the psychological state of “quiet”: having  known the ineffable peace and certainty, the bliss which follows on  its act of complete surrender, its utter and speechless resting in the  Absolute Life, believed themselves to have discovered in this halfway  house the goal of the mystic quest. Therefore, whilst much of their  teaching remains true, as a real description of a real and valid state  experienced by almost all contemplatives in the course <a name="page_324"><font size="1" color="green">p. 324</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_324"></a> of their development, the inference which they drew from  it, that in this mere blank abiding in the deeps the soul had reached  the end of her course, was untrue and bad for life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p108"></a>Thus Molinos gives in the “Spiritual  Guide” many unexceptional maxims upon Interior Silence:  “By not speaking nor desiring, and not thinking,” he says  justly enough of the contemplative spirit, “she arrives at the  true and perfect mystical silence wherein God speaks with the soul,  communicates Himself to it, and in the abyss of its own depth teaches  it the most perfect and exalted wisdom. He calls and guides it to this  inward solitude and mystical silence, when He says that He will speak  to it alone in the most secret and hidden part of the heart.”  Here Molinos speaks the language of all mystics, yet the total result  of his teaching was to suggest to the ordinary mind that there was a  peculiar virtue in doing nothing at all, and that all deliberate  spiritual activities were bad.   <a name="fr_674"></a><a href="#fn_674"><font size="1">675</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p110"></a>Much of the teaching of modern “mystical”  cults is thus crudely quietistic. It insists on the necessity of  “going into the silence,” and even, with a strange  temerity, gives preparatory lessons in subconscious meditation: a  proceeding which might well provoke the laughter of the saints. The  faithful, being gathered together, are taught by simple exercises in  recollection the way to attain the “Quiet.” By this mental  trick the modern transcendentalist naturally attains to a state of  vacant placidity, in which he rests: and “remaining in a  distracted idleness and misspending the time in expectation of  extraordinary visits,” believes—with a faith which many of  the orthodox might envy—that he is here “united with his  Principle.” But, though the psychological state which  contemplatives call the prayer of quiet is a common condition of  mystical attainment, it is not by itself mystical at all. It is a  state of preparation: a way of opening the door. That which comes in  when the door is opened will be that which we truly and passionately  desire. The will makes plain the way: the heart—the whole  man—conditions the guest. The true contemplative, coming to this  plane of utter stillness, does not desire “extraordinary favours  and visitations,” but the privilege of breathing for a little  while the atmosphere of Love. He is about that which St. Bernard  called “the business of all businesses”: goes, in perfect  simplicity, to the encounter of Perfection, not to the development of  himself.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p111"></a>So, even at this apparently “passive”  stage of his progress, the mystic’s operations are found on  analysis to have a dynamic and purposive character: his very repose is  the result of stress. He is a pilgrim that still seeks his country.  Urged by his innate tendency to transcendence, he is on his way to  higher levels, more <a name="page_325"><font size="1" color="green">p. 325</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_325"></a> sublime fulfilments, greater  self-giving acts. Though he may have forsaken all superficial  activity, deep, urgent action still remains. “The possession of  God,” says Ruysbroeck, “demands and supposes active love.  He who thinks or feels otherwise is deceived. All our life as it is in  God is immersed in blessedness: all our life as it is in ourselves is  immersed in active love. And though we live wholly in ourselves and  wholly in God, it is but one life, but it is twofold and opposite  according to our feeling—rich and poor hungry and fulfilled,  active and quiet.”   <a name="fr_675"></a><a href="#fn_675"><font size="1">676</font></a>
     The essential difference between this true “active” Quiet  and Quietism of all kinds has been admirably expressed by Baron von  Hügel. “Quietism, the doctrine of the One Act; passivity in  a literal sense, as the absence or imperfection of the power or use of  initiative on the soul’s part, in any and every state; these  doctrines were finally condemned, and most rightly and necessarily  condemned, the Prayer of Quiet and the various states and degrees of  an ever-increasing predominance of Action over Activity—an  action which is all the more the soul’s very own, because the  more occasioned, directed and informed by God’s action and  stimulation—these and the other chief lines of the ancient  experience and practice remain as true, correct, and necessary as  ever.”   <a name="fr_676"></a><a href="#fn_676"><font size="1">677</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p114"></a>The “ever-increasing predominance of Action over  Activity”—the deep and vital movement of the whole self,  too utterly absorbed for self-consciousness, set over against its  fussy surface-energies—here is the true ideal of orison. This  must inform all the soul’s aspiration towards union with the  absolute Life and Love which waits at the door. It is an ideal which  includes Quiet, as surely as it excludes Quietism.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p115"></a>As for that doctrine of the One Act here mentioned,  which was preached by the more extreme quietists; it, like all else in  this movement, was the perversion of a great mystical truth. It taught  that the turning of the soul towards Reality, the merging of the will  in God, which is the very heart of the mystic life, was   <i>One Act,</i>    never to be repeated. This done, the self had nothing more to do but  to rest in the Divine Life, be its unresisting instrument. Pure  passivity and indifference were its ideal. All activity was forbidden  it, all choice was a negation of its surrender, all striving was  unnecessary and wrong. It needed only to rest for evermore and  “let God work and speak in the silence.” This doctrine is  so utterly at variance with all that we know of the laws of life and  growth, that it hardly seems to stand in need of condemnation. Such a  state of indifference—which the quietists strove in vain to  identify with that state of Pure Love which “seeketh not its  own” <a name="page_326"><font size="1" color="green">p. 326</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_326"></a> in spiritual things—cannot coexist  with any of those “degrees of ardent charity” through  which man’s spirit must pass on its journey to the One: and this  alone is enough to prove its non-mystical character.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p116"></a>It is only fair to Madame Guyon to say that she cannot  justly be charged with preaching this exaggeration of passivity,  though a loose and fluid style has allowed many unfortunate inferences  to be drawn from her works. “Some persons,” she says,  “when they hear of the prayer of quiet, falsely imagine that the  soul remains stupid, dead, and inactive. But unquestionably it acteth  therein, more nobly and more extensively than it had ever done before,  for God Himself is the Mover and the soul now acteth by the agency of  His Spirit. . . . Instead, then, of promoting idleness we promote the  highest activity, by inculcating a total dependence on the Spirit of  God as our moving principle, for in Him we live and move and have our  being. . . . Our activity should therefore consist in endeavouring to  acquire and maintain such a state as may be most susceptible of divine  impressions, most flexile to all the operations of the Eternal Word.  Whilst a tablet is unsteady, the painter is unable to delineate a true  copy: so every act of our own selfish and proper spirit is productive  of false and erroneous lineaments, it interrupts the work and defeats  the design of this Adorable Artist.”   <a name="fr_677"></a><a href="#fn_677"><font size="1">678</font></a>
  </p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p118"></a>The true mystics, in whom the Orison of Quiet develops  to this state of receptivity, seldom use in describing it the language  of “holy indifference.” Their love and enthusiasm will not  let them do that. It is true, of course, that they are indifferent to  all else save the supreme claims of love: but then, it is of love that  they speak. <a name="an_iv.vi-p118.1"></a>  <i>Ego dormio et cor meum vigilat</i>      .    “This,” says St. Teresa, “is a sleep of the powers  of the soul, which are not wholly lost, nor yet understanding how they  are at work. . . . To me it seems to be nothing else than a death, as  it were, to all the things of this world, and a fruition of God. I  know of no other words whereby to describe it or explain it; neither  does the soul then know what to do—for it knows not whether to  speak or be silent, whether it should laugh or weep. It is a glorious  folly, a heavenly madness wherein true wisdom is acquired; and to the  soul a kind of fruition most full of delight. . . . The faculties of  the soul now retain only the power of occupying themselves wholly with  God; not one of them ventures to stir, neither can we move one of them  without making great efforts to distract ourselves—and, indeed,  I do not think we can do it at all at this time.”   <a name="fr_678"></a><a href="#fn_678"><font size="1">679</font></a>
     <a name="page_327"><font size="1" color="green">p. 327</font></a> <a name="an_iv.vi-Page_327"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p120"></a>Here, then, we see the Orison of Silence melting into  true contemplation: its stillness is ruffled by its joy. The Quiet  reveals itself as an essentially transitional state, introducing the  self into a new sphere of activity.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.vi-p121"></a>The second degree of ardent love, says Richard of St.  Victor,   <i>binds</i>   , sothat the soul which is possessed by it is unable to think of  anything else: it is not only “insuperable,” but also  “inseparable.”   <a name="fr_679"></a><a href="#fn_679"><font size="1">680</font></a>
     He compares it to the soul’s bridal; the irrevocable act, by  which permanent union is initiated. The feeling-state which is the  equivalent of the Quiet is just such a passive and joyous yielding-up  of the virgin soul to its Bridegroom; a silent marriage-vow. It is  ready for all that may happen to it, all that may be asked of  it—to give itself and lose itself, to wait upon the pleasure of  its Love. From this inward surrender the self emerges to the new life,  the new knowledge which is mediated to it under the innumerable forms  of Contemplation.</p>
