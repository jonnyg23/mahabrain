 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p1"></a>Far from being academic or unreal, that history, I  think, is vital for the deeper understanding of the history of  humanity. It shows us, upon high levels, the psychological process to  which every self which desires to rise to the perception of Reality  must submit: the formula under which man’s spiritual  consciousness, be it strong or weak, must necessarily unfold. In the  great mystics we see the highest and widest development of that  consciousness <a name="page_445"><font size="1" color="green">p. 445</font></a> <a name="an_iv.xi-Page_445"></a> to which the human race has yet  attained. We see its growth exhibited to us on a grand scale,  perceptible of all men: the stages of its slow transcendence of the  sense-world marked by episodes of splendour and of terror which are  hard for common men to accept or understand as a part of the organic  process of life. But the germ of that same transcendent life, the  spring of the amazing energy which enables the great mystic to rise to  freedom and dominate his world, is latent in all of us, an integral  part of our humanity. Where the mystic has a genius for the Absolute,  we have each a little buried talent, some greater, some less; and the  growth of this talent, this spark of the soul, once we permit its  emergence, will conform in little, and according to its measure, to  those laws of organic growth those inexorable conditions of  transcendence which we found to govern the Mystic Way.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p2"></a>Every person, then, who awakens to consciousness of a  Reality which transcends the normal world of sense—however  small, weak imperfect that consciousness may be—is put upon a  road which follows at low levels the path which the mystic treads at  high levels. The success with which he follows this way to freedom and  full life will depend on the intensity of his love and will, his  capacity for self-discipline, his steadfastness and courage. It will  depend on the generosity and completeness of his outgoing passion for  absolute beauty, absolute goodness, or absolute truth. But if he move  at all, he will move through a series of states which are, in their  own small way, analogous to those experienced by the greatest  contemplative on his journey towards that union with God which is the  term of the spirit’s ascent towards its home.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p3"></a>As the embryo of physical man, be he saint or savage,  passes through the same stages of initial growth, so too with  spiritual man. When the “new birth” takes place in him,  the new life-process of his deeper self begins, the normal individual,  no less than the mystic, will know that spiral ascent towards higher  levels, those oscillations of consciousness between light and  darkness, those odd mental disturbances, abrupt invasions from the  subliminal region, and disconcerting glimpses of truth, which  accompany the growth of the transcendental powers; though he may well  interpret them in other than the mystic sense. He too will be impelled  to drastic self-discipline, to a deliberate purging of his eyes that  he may see: and receiving a new vision of the world, will be spurred  by it to a total self-dedication, an active surrender of his whole  being, to that aspect of the Infinite which he has perceived. He too  will endure in little the psychic upheavals of the spiritual  adolescence: will be forced to those sacrifices which every form of  <a name="page_446"><font size="1" color="green">p. 446</font></a> <a name="an_iv.xi-Page_446"></a> genius demands. He will know according to his  measure the dreadful moments of lucid self-knowledge, the  counter-balancing ecstasy of an intuition of the Real. More and more,  as we study and collate all the available evidence, this  fact—this law—is borne in on us: that the general movement  of human consciousness, when it obeys its innate tendency to  transcendence, is always the same. There is only one road from  Appearance to Reality. “Men pass on, but the States are  permanent for ever.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p4"></a>I do not care whether the consciousness be that of  artist or musician, striving to catch and fix some aspect of the  heavenly light or music, and denying all other aspects of the world in  order to devote themselves to this: or of the humble servant of  Science, purging his intellect that he may look upon her secrets with  innocence of eye: whether the higher reality be perceived in the terms  of religion, beauty, suffering; of human love, of goodness, or of  truth. However widely these forms of transcendence may seem to differ,  the mystic experience is the key to them all. All in their different  ways are exhibitions here and now of the Eternal; extensions of  man’s consciousness which involve calls to heroic endeavour,  incentives to the remaking of character about new and higher centres  of life. Through each, man may rise to freedom and take his place in  the great movement of the universe: may “understand by dancing  that which is done.” Each brings the self who receives its  revelation in good faith, does not check it by self-regarding  limitations, to a humble acceptance of the universal law of knowledge:  the law that “we behold that which we are,” and hence that  “only the Real can know Reality.” Awakening, Discipline,  Enlightenment, Self-surrender, and Union, are the essential phases of  life’s response to this fundamental fact: the conditions of our  attainment of Being, the necessary formula under which alone our  consciousness of any of these fringes of Eternity—any of these  aspects of the Transcendent—can unfold, develop, attain to  freedom and full life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p5"></a>We are, then, one and all the kindred of the mystics;  and it is by dwelling upon this kinship, by interpreting—so far  as we may—their great declarations in the light of our little  experience, that we shall learn to understand them best. Strange and  far away though they seem, they are not cut off from us by some  impassable abyss. They belong to us. They are our brethren; the  giants, the heroes of our race. As the achievement of genius belongs  not to itself only, but also to the society that brought it forth; as  theology declares that the merits of the saints avail for all; so,  because of the solidarity of the human family, the supernal  accomplishment of the mystics is ours also. Their attainment is the  earnest-money of our eternal life. <a name="page_447"><font size="1" color="green">p. 447</font></a> <a name="an_iv.xi-Page_447"></a></p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p6"></a>To be a mystic is simply to participate here and now  in that real and eternal life; in the fullest, deepest sense which is  possible to man. It is to share, as a free and conscious  agent—not a servant, but a son—in the joyous travail of  the Universe: its mighty onward sweep through pain and glory towards  its home in God. This gift of “sonship,” this power of  free co-operation in the world-process, is man’s greatest  honour. The ordered sequence of states, the organic development,  whereby his consciousness is detached from illusion and rises to the  mystic freedom which conditions instead of being conditioned by, its  normal world, is the way he must tread if that sonship is to be  realized. Only by this deliberate fostering of his deeper self, this  transmutation of the elements of his character, can he reach those  levels of consciousness upon which he hears, and responds to, the  measure “whereto the worlds keep time” on their great  pilgrimage towards the Father’s heart. The mystic act of union,  that joyous loss of the transfigured self in God, which is the crown  of man’s conscious ascent towards the Absolute, is the  contribution of the individual to this, the destiny of the Cosmos.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p7"></a>The mystic knows that destiny. It is laid bare to his  lucid vision, as our puzzling world of form and colour is to normal  sight. He is the “hidden child” of the eternal order, an  initiate of the secret plan. Hence, whilst “all creation  groaneth and travaileth,” slowly moving under the spur of blind  desire towards that consummation in which alone it can have rest, he  runs eagerly along the pathway to reality. He is the pioneer of Life  on its age-long voyage to the One: and shows us, in his attainment,  the meaning and value of that life.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p8"></a>This meaning, this secret plan of Creation, flames  out, had we eyes to see, from every department of existence. Its  exultant declarations come to us in all great music; its magic is the  life of all romance. Its law—the law of love—is the  substance of the beautiful, the energizing cause of the heroic. It  lights the altar of every creed. All man’s dreams and diagrams  concerning a transcendent Perfection near him yet intangible, a  transcendent vitality to which he can attain—whether he call  these objects of desire God, grace, being, spirit, beauty, “pure  idea”—are but translations of his deeper self’s  intuition of its destiny; clumsy fragmentary hints at the  all-inclusive, living Absolute which that deeper self knows to be  real. This supernal Thing, the adorable Substance of all that  Is—the synthesis of Wisdom, Power, and Love—and  man’s apprehension of it, his slow remaking in its interests,  his union with it at last; this is the theme of mysticism. That  twofold extension of consciousness which allows him communion with its  transcendent and immanent aspects is, in all its gradual <a name="page_448"><font size="1" color="green">p. 448</font></a> <a name="an_iv.xi-Page_448"></a> processes, the Mystic Way. It is also the crown of human  evolution; the fulfilment of life, the liberation of personality from  the world of appearance, its entrance into the free creative life of  the Real.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p9"></a>Further, Christians may well remark that the  psychology of Christ, as presented to us in the Gospels, is of a piece  with that of the mystics. In its pain and splendour, its dual  character of action and fruition, it reflects their experience upon  the supernal plane of more abundant life. Thanks to this fact, for  them the Ladder of Contemplation—that ladder which mediaeval  thought counted as an instrument of the Passion, discerning it as  essential to the true salvation of man—stretches without a break  from earth to the Empyrean. It leans against the Cross; it leads to  the Secret Rose. By it the ministers of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty go  up and down between the transcendent and the apparent world. Seen,  then, from whatever standpoint we may choose to adopt—whether of  psychology, philosophy, or religion—the adventure of the great  mystics intimately concerns us. It is a master-key to man’s  puzzle: by its help he may explain much in his mental makeup, in his  religious constructions, in his experience of life. In all these  departments he perceives himself to be climbing slowly and clumsily  upward toward some attainment yet unseen. The mystics, expert  mountaineers, go before him: and show him, if he cares to learn, the  way to freedom, to reality, to peace. He cannot rise in this, his  earthly existence, to the awful and solitary peak, veiled in the Cloud  of Unknowing, where they meet that “death of the summit,”  which is declared by them to be the gate of Perfect Life: but if he  choose to profit by their explorations, he may find his level, his  place within the Eternal Order. He may achieve freedom, live the  “independent spiritual life.”</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p10"></a>Consider once more the Mystic Way as we have traced it  from its beginning. To what does it tend if not to this?</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p11"></a>It began by the awakening within the self of a new and  embryonic consciousness: a consciousness of divine reality, as opposed  to the illusory sense-world in which she was immersed. Humbled, awed  by the august possibilities then revealed to her, that self retreated  into the “cell of self-knowledge” and there laboured to  adjust herself to the Eternal Order which she had perceived, stripped  herself of all that opposed it, disciplined her energies, purified the  organs of sense. Remade in accordance with her intuitions of reality,  the “eternal hearing and seeing were revealed in her.” She  opened her eyes upon a world still natural, but no longer illusory;  since it was perceived to be illuminated by the Uncreated Light. She  knew then the beauty, the majesty, the divinity of the living World of  Becoming which holds in its meshes <a name="page_449"><font size="1" color="green">p. 449</font></a> <a name="an_iv.xi-Page_449"></a> every living  thing. She had transcended the narrow rhythm by which common men  perceive but one of its many aspects, escaped the machine-made  universe presented by the cinematograph of sense, and participated in  the “great life of the All.” Reality came forth to her,  since her eyes were cleansed to see It, not from some strange far-off  and spiritual country, but gently, from the very heart of things. Thus  lifted to a new level, she began again her ceaseless work of growth:  and because by the cleansing of the senses she had learned to see the  reality which is shadowed by the sense-world, she now, by the  cleansing of her will, sought to draw nearer to that Eternal Will,  that Being, which life, the World of Becoming, manifests and serves.  Thus, by the surrender of her selfhood in its wholeness, the  perfecting of her love, she slid from Becoming to Being, and found her  true life hidden in God.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p12"></a>Yet the course of this transcendence, this amazing  inward journey, was closely linked, first and last, with the processes  of human life. It sprang from that life, as man springs from the sod.  We were even able to describe it under those symbolic formulae which  we are accustomed to call the “laws” of the natural world.  By an extension of these formulae, their logical application, we  discovered a path which led us without a break from the sensible to  the supra-sensible; from apparent to absolute life. There is nothing  unnatural about the Absolute of the mystics: He sets the rhythm of His  own universe, and conforms to the harmonies which He has made. We,  deliberately seeking for that which we suppose to be spiritual, too  often overlook that which alone is Real. The true mysteries of life  accomplish themselves so softly, with so easy and assured a grace, so  frank an acceptance of our breeding, striving, dying, and unresting  world, that the unimaginative natural man—all agog for the  marvellous—is hardly startled by their daily and radiant  revelation of infinite wisdom and love. Yet this revelation presses  incessantly upon us. Only the hard crust of surface-consciousness  conceals it from our normal sight. In some least expected moment, the  common activities of life in progress, that Reality in Whom the  mystics dwell slips through our closed doors, and suddenly we see It  at our side.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p13"></a>It was said of the disciples at Emmaus, <a name="an_iv.xi-p13.1"></a>“Mensam igitur ponunt panes cibosque offerunt, et  Deum, quem in Scripturae sacrae expositione non cognoverant, in panis  fractione cognoscunt.” So too for us the  Transcendent Life for which we crave is revealed and our living within  it, not on some remote and arid plane of being, in the cunning  explanations of philosophy; but in the normal acts of our diurnal  experience, suddenly made significant for us. Not in the backwaters of  existence, not amongst subtle arguments and occult doctrines, but in  all those places where the direct <a name="page_450"><font size="1" color="green">p. 450</font></a> <a name="an_iv.xi-Page_450"></a> and simple life  of earth goes on. It is found in the soul of man so long as that soul  is alive and growing: it is not found in any sterile place.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p14"></a>This fact of experience is our link with the mystics,  our guarantee of the truthfulness of their statements, the supreme  importance of their adventure, their closer contact with Reality. The  mystics on their part are our guarantee of the end towards which the  Immanent Love, the hidden steersman which dwells in our midst, is  moving: our “lovely forerunners” on the path towards the  Real. They come back to us from an encounter with life’s most  august secret, as Mary came running from the tomb; filled with amazing  tidings which they can hardly tell. We, longing for some assurance,  and seeing their radiant faces, urge them to pass on their revelation  if they can. It is the old demand of the dim-sighted and  incredulous:—</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.xi-p14.1"></a> “Dic nobis Maria<br>   Quid vidisti in via?”<br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p15"></a>But they cannot say: can only report fragments  of the symbolic vision:—</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.xi-p15.1"></a> <a name="an_iv.xi-p15.3"></a>“Angelicos testes,  sudarium, et vestes”—<br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p16"></a>not the inner content, the final divine  certainty. We must ourselves follow in their footsteps if we would  have that.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p17"></a>Like the story of the Cross, so too the story of  man’s spirit ends in a garden: in a place of birth and  fruitfulness, of beautiful and natural things. Divine Fecundity is its  secret: existence, not for its own sake, but for the sake of a more  abundant life. It ends with the coming forth of divine humanity, never  again to leave us: living in us, and with us, a pilgrim, a worker, a  guest at our table, a sharer at all hazards in life. The mystics  witness to this story: waking very early they have run on before us,  urged by the greatness of their love. We, incapable as yet of this  sublime encounter, looking in their magic mirror, listening to their  stammered tidings, may see far off the consummation of the race.</p>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p18"></a>According to the measure of their strength and of  their passion, these, the true lovers of the Absolute, have conformed  here and now to the utmost tests of divine sonship, the final demands  of life. They have not shrunk from the sufferings of the cross. They  have faced the darkness of the tomb. Beauty and agony alike have  called them: alike have awakened a heroic response. For them the  winter is over: the time of the singing of birds is come. From the  deeps <a name="page_451"><font size="1" color="green">p. 451</font></a> <a name="an_iv.xi-Page_451"></a> of the dewy garden, Life—new,  unquenchable, and ever lovely—comes to meet them with the  dawn.</p>   <blockquote><a name="an_iv.xi-p18.1"></a>   <a name="an_iv.xi-p18.3"></a>Et hoc intellegere, quis bominum dabit  bomini?  <br>      <a name="an_iv.xi-p18.5"></a>Quis angelus angelo?  <br>      <a name="an_iv.xi-p18.7"></a>Quis angelus bomini?  <br>      <a name="an_iv.xi-p18.9"></a>El te petatur,  <br>      <a name="an_iv.xi-p18.11"></a>In te quaeratur,  <br>      <a name="an_iv.xi-p18.13"></a>Eld te pulsetur,  <br>     <a name="an_iv.xi-p18.15"></a>Sic, sic accipietur invenietur, sic  aperietur.<br>  </blockquote>   
 <p><a name="an_iv.xi-p19"></a><a name="page_453"><font size="1" color="green">p. 453</font></a> <a name="an_iv.xi-Page_453"></a></p>
