 <p align="center"><i>Ilocano</i></p>  
 <p>One day when a monkey was climbing a tree in the forest in which he lived, he ran a thorn into his tail. Try as he would, he could not get it out, so he went to a barber in the town and said:</p>  
 <p>"Friend Barber, I have a thorn in the end of my tail. Pull it out, and I will pay you well."</p>  
 <p>The barber tried to pull out the thorn with his razor, but in doing so he cut off the end of the tail. The monkey was very angry and cried:</p>  
 <p>"Barber, Barber, give me back my tail, or give me your razor!"</p>  
 <p>The barber could not put back the end of the monkey's tail, so he gave him his razor.</p>  
 <p>On the way home the monkey met an old woman who was cutting wood for fuel, and he said to her:</p>  
 <p>"Grandmother, Grandmother, that is very hard. Use this razor and then it will cut easily."</p>  
 <p>The old woman was very pleased with the offer and began to cut with the razor, but before she had used it long it broke. Then the monkey cried:</p>  
 <p>"Grandmother, Grandmother, you have broken my razor! You must get a new one for me or else give me all the firewood."</p>  
 <p>The old woman could not get a new razor so she gave him the firewood.</p>  
 <p>The monkey took the wood and was going back to town to sell it, when he saw a woman sitting beside the road making cakes.</p>  
 <p>"Grandmother, Grandmother," said he, "your wood is most gone; take this of mine and bake more cakes."</p>  
 <p>The woman took the wood and thanked him for his kindness, but when the last stick was burned, the monkey cried out:</p>  
 <p>"Grandmother, Grandmother, you have burned up all my wood! Now you must give me all your cakes to pay for it."</p>  
 <p>The old woman could not cut more dry wood at once, so she gave him all the cakes.</p>  
 <p>The monkey took the cakes and started for the town, but on the way he met a dog which bit him so that he died. And the dog ate all the cakes.</p>
