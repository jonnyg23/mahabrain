 <p align="center">(Fifteenth Century)</p>  
 <p></p><dir>THE Rose was gone. When to the empty tent<br> The Nightingale returned, his heart was torn.<br> He filled the night with mourning and lament,<br> And wandered through the darkness lone and lorn.  
 <p>"To thee I speak, O Garden, answer me,<br> Why did’st thou not preserve my precious Rose,<br> Whose perfume breathed of immortality,<br> Whose colour made her queen of all that grows?</p>  
 <p>"May’st thou become a desert parched and dry,<br> And may the flowers that grow within thee fade;<br> May thy protecting walls in ruin lie--<br> By ruthless feet thy soil in waste be laid.</p>  
 <p>"Ye trees, now cast away your verdant leaves,<br> And rushing torrents, your swift courses stay.<br> Reckless I speak, as one who sorely grieves,<br> For they have taken my sweet love away.</p></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir>"My Rose is gone and I am desolate.<br> Light of my eyes was she, now darkness reigns.<br> Both day and night I weep disconsolate.<br> My reason leaves me, and my spirit wanes.  
 <p>"Was it the gardener took her away<br> And grieved my soul If never more again<br> I should behold her face, what shall I say?<br> Instead of joy, I'll sing of grief and pain.</p>  
 <p>"Or else I fear the mighty wind arose,<br> And blasted with its strength her petals frail;<br> Or did the scorching sunbeams burn my Rose<br> Within her leaves, and turn her beauty pale? . . .</p>  
 <p>"I think perhaps the flowers were wroth with me<br> And hid her from my sight; I'll go to them.<br> Or else the clouds in cruel enmity<br> Sent hailstones down that broke her from the stem!"</p>  
 <p>Then all the flowers together made reply,<br> "We have no tidings of the Rose at all,<br> She left us suddenly, we know not why.<br> We have no tidings of the Rose at all."</p>  
 <p>The Nightingale then rose into the air,<br> "I'll ask the birds in friendly wise," he said,<br> "If they can tell me why she went, and where;<br> If not, a sea of tears my eyes shall shed.</p>  
 <p>"Birds, do you know what came to pass to-day?<br> The lovely Rose was stolen from her home.<br> Know you perchance who carried her away?<br> Have you seen aught, or heard where she doth roam?"</p></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir>They said, "The Lord Creator knoweth all;<br> No secrets of the heart from Him are hid.<br> On Him as witness reverently we call<br> We have not seen or touched her--God forbid!"  
 <p>The Nightingale then sadly made reply,<br> "What will become of me? From night to morn<br> I have no rest, and I shall surely die,<br> Parted from her, with ceaseless longings worn.</p>  
 <p>"If in her stead the world to me were given<br> I would esteem it but a paltry thing;<br> If choirs of minstrels sang the songs of heaven,<br> To me their songs as discords harsh would ring.</p>  
 <p>"Oh, in what corner have they buried thee?<br> How shall I e’er forget thy tenderness?<br> My heart and soul are wounded grievously,<br> All flowers are dead--this place a wilderness.</p>  
 <p>"The Psalmist's words are now fulfilled in me;<br> Mournful I go, and like a pelican<br> About the wilderness roam hopelessly,<br> Or like an owl the sandy desert scan."</p>  
 <p>The gardener then with soothing words drew near,<br> "Weep not, she will return, O Nightingale.<br> The Violet, her forerunner, is here,<br> And brings thee messages and words of hail."</p>  
 <p>Then he rejoiced and blessed the gardener,<br> "May’st thou in peace upon this earth abide,<br> Thy garden flourish with its bright allure,<br> Its circling walls renew their former pride.</p></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 55</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir>"May all thy plants grow verdant once again,<br> And gently sway about upon the breeze,<br> May they receive fresh brightness from the rain,<br> And waft sweet perfume human hearts to please!"</dir>  
 <p>Then did the Nightingale write a letter unto the Rose who collected all the Flowers and caused it to be read in their presence.</p>  
 <p></p><dir>They took the letter to the Rose's Court,<br> Where Hazrevart, her minister austere,<br> Stood on his feet with stately mien and port<br> And read it out for all the flowers to hear:--  
 <p>"I greet thee, O beloved of my heart,<br> And fain would hear concerning this thy rape.<br> I trust through God's protecting care thou art<br> Perfect in health, as faultless in thy shape.</p>  
 <p>"For which with outstretched hands I ever pray,<br> And beg that length of days be granted thee;<br> All flowers bend to thee and homage pay,<br> Thou rulest them in all thy majesty.</p>  
 <p>"Thy hue is beautiful, thy perfume sweet,<br> Each morn thou shinest brighter than the sun.<br> Happy the day when thee once more I meet,--<br> For thou art full of grace, my spotless one.</p></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 56</font></a></p>  
 <p>"Apart from thee, in humble reverence,<br> I worship thee, and pray for thy return.<br> I have no sleep at night for this suspense,<br> Now Spring is here I ever weep and mourn.</p>  
 <p>"The icy winter passed--I lived it through,<br> Still suffering many things because of thee;<br> They mocked at me, and said thou wast not true--<br> My Rose had no more love or care for me."</p>  
 <p>Then sent the Rose unto the Nightingale,<br> And said: "Behold, I send him many flowers.<br> And they shall cover mountain, hill, and dale,<br> My Nightingale shall dwell within those bowers.</p>  
 <p>"I cannot there return immediately;<br> A little he must wait, in patient wise:<br> But if his love is perfectly with me,<br> Tell him to look for it in Paradise."</p>  
 <p>The Nightingale rejoiced on hearing this<br> And said: "The beauteous Rose shall then return!<br> What tidings wonderful of untold bliss!<br> For all the world her ransom could not earn."</p>  
 <p>And when the sun into the Ram had passed,<br> The thunder rolled, the storm-clouds broke in showers;<br> Myriads of blossoms o’er the earth were cast:--<br> He sought the Rose--she was not of those flowers.</p>  
 <p>Until one morn he saw her foliage green,<br> Lovely and fresh as it had been before:<br> The Rose was hidden in a silken screen<br> And every flower worshipped her once more.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 57</font></a></p>  
 <p></p><dir>The Nightingale beheld and said: "Thank Heaven!<br> Blessing and praise from every mouth be breathed;<br> To Heaven's King be endless glory given--<br> For in her bud I saw the Rose ensheathed!"  
 <p>     .        .        .        .        .        .        .</p>  
 <p>Foolish Aghtamartzi, beware this bane,<br> For this world's love is ever linked with thorn;<br> A little while ’tis gladness, then ’tis pain<br> What boots the joy which needs must make us mourn?</p></dir>
