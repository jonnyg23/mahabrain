 <p>AFTER a while the world cooled off and <i>Wek'-wek</i> came back to <i>Oo'-yum-bel'-le</i> (Mount Diablo) to see his father <i>Mol'-luk</i> and his grandfather <i>O-let'te</i>. He said to <i>Mol'-luk</i>, "O father;" and <i>Mol'-luk</i> answered, "What is it my son?"</p>  
 <p><i>Wek'-wek</i> asked, "How can we make <i>Mew'-ko</i> (Indian people) and have them in the country?"</p>  
 <p>His father replied, "I cannot tell you; ask your grandfather, he can tell you."</p>  
 <p>So <i>Wek'-wek</i> asked his grandfather, <i>O-let'-te</i>, how they were going to make people.</p>  
 <p><i>O-let'-te</i> answered, "Hah-hah, it will take you a good while to do that. If you are going to do that you must have a head. If people are coming you must first put out [provide] everything everywhere so they can live. If you want to do this I will think about it."</p>  
 <p>"I want to see it done," answered <i>Wek'-wek</i>.</p>  
 <p>"All right," said <i>O-let'-te</i>, "I know how. I must catch the three birds--<i>Choo'-hoo</i> the Turkey Buzzard, <i>Kok'-kol</i> the Raven, and <i>Ah-wet'-che</i> the Crow. The only way to catch these birds is to make-believe dead."</p>  
 <p>So <i>Wek'-wek</i> and <i>O-let'-te</i> went out on the plain</p>  
 <p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></a></p>  
 <p>together and <i>O-let'-te</i> lay down on the ground and pretended he was dead. He opened his mouth and let his tongue out and relaxed himself so <i>Choo'-hoo</i> the Buzzard would think he was dead. He told <i>Wek'-wek</i> he would call if he caught the birds; and <i>Wek'-wek</i> went away.</p>  
 <p>Soon <i>Choo'-hoo</i> the Turkey Buzzard came sailing over and saw the dead Coyote-man and circled around and lit on the ground beside him. <i>Kok'-kol</i> the Raven and <i>Ah-wet'-che</i> the Crow saw <i>Choo'-hoo</i> go down and knew that he had found something to eat, so they too hastened to the place. just as all three began to eat, <i>O-let'-te</i> suddenly sprang up and caught them. He then called <i>Wek'-wek</i> to come, and told him to pick off the feathers and be careful not to lose a single one. This <i>Wek'-wek</i> did; he picked all the feathers from the three birds and. took them all home.</p>  
 <p>Then he asked his grandfather, "What are we going to do next?"</p>  
 <p>"Make people," answered <i>O-let'-te</i>.</p>  
 <p>"All right," said <i>Wek'-wek</i>, "do you know how?"</p>  
 <p>"Yes," answered <i>O-let'-te</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>Wek'-wek</i> then told <i>Mol'-luk</i> his father that they were going to make people. <i>Mol'-luk</i> answered, "All right."</p>  
 <p>Next morning <i>O-let'-te</i> and <i>Wek'-wek</i> took the feathers and traveled over all the country. They picked out the places where they wanted Indian villages to be, and in each place stuck up three</p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p>feathers--one for <i>Chā'-kah</i> the Chief, one for <i>Mi'-yum</i>, the head woman or Woman Chief, and one for <i>Soo-lā-too</i> the poor. And they gave each place its name--the name it has always had and bears today.</p>  
 <p>The next morning the three feathers at each place stood up and came to life and became <i>Mew'-ko</i> [Indian People]. This is the way people were made in the beginning and this is the way all the different rancherias or villages were named.</p>  
 <p>After that <i>O-let'-te</i> said to <i>Wek'-wek</i>, "Now we also are going to change; I am going to be a hunting animal and you are going to be a hunting bird." So <i>O-let'-te</i> the Coyote-man, whose form up to this time we do not know, changed to the Coyote, a furry hunting animal and became the first furry animal. And <i>Wek'-wek</i> changed to the Falcon, a hunting bird.</p>
