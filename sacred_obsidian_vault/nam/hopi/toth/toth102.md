 <p>Ishyaoí! East of Tcöokávü lived a great many Ants. One time the chief of the Ants said to them that they were going to have a Katcina initiation in four days. On the fourth day two of the Ants dressed themselves up as Hû Katcinas; one as Angwúshnacomtaka, just the same as is being done to-day when children are initiated into a Katcina society. They dressed up at Korítvi, a short distance north-west of the village. Some of the Ants also made a sand picture on the floor of the kiva; then the Ants began to bring their children that were to be initiated into the kiva.</p>  
 <p>When the children had all been put in, the Katcina priest of the Ants related the story in the same manner as the Katcina priest now relates it at the Katcina initiation. Four little Kóyemsis then had their performance. One of the Ants was in the meanwhile sitting on a rock outside, and when they were through in the kiva this Ant swung one fore-foot vigorously as a signal for the Katcinas to come. The Katcinas at once came running to the kiva, circled around the kiva several times, and then entered it, taking places opposite the sand picture. They then flogged the little Ant children. They flogged them so hard that they almost cut them through in the middle of their body When they were through all the Katcinas left the kiva and ran away. And that is the reason why the ants are now so thin in the middle of their bodies, because they were almost cut in two on that occasion.</p>
