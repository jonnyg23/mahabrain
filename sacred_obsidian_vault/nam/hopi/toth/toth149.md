He goes again and brings great deal of meat. He and old man eat together, and when done others come and take what is left. One man does not come, and then says they will bring their wealth to-morrow, and whoever is richest shall live with young man's wife. Next day they go for their possessions and fill kiva. Then Piwítamni goes to grandmother's house, and she gives him great many sashes. He returns and grandmother gives him buckskins in great quantities.
