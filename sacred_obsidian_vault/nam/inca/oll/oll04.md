 </i><p>An open space near the junction of the two torrents of Cuzco, the Huatanay and Tullumayu or Rodadero, called Pumap Chupan, just outside the gardens of the Sun. The Temple of the Sun beyond the gardens, and the Sacsahuaman hill surmounted by the fortress, rising in the distance. The palace of Colcampata on the hillside.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(<i>Enter</i> OLLANTAY L. [<i>in a gilded tunic, breeches of llama sinews</i>, usutas <i>or shoes of llama hide, a red mantle of</i> ccompi <i>or fine cloth, and the</i> chucu <i>or head-dress of his rank, holding a battle-axe</i> (champi) <i>and club</i> (macana)] <i>and</i> PIQUI CHAQUI <i>coming up from the back</i> R. [<i>in a coarse brown tunic of</i> auasca <i>or llama cloth, girdle used as a sling, and</i> chucu <i>or head-dress of a Cuzqueño</i>].)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>  <i>Ollantay</i>. Where, young fleet-foot, hast thou been?<br> Hast thou the starry Ñusta seen?<br>   <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. The Sun forbids such sacrilege<br> 'Tis not for me to see the star.<br> Dost thou, my master, fear no ill,<br> Thine eyes upon the Inca's child?<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. In spite of all I swear to love<br> That tender dove, that lovely star;<br> My heart is as a lamb <a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#fn_5"><font size="1">1</font></a> with her,<br> And ever will her presence seek.</p> 
 <p>
 </p> 
 <p><a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="green">p. 342</font></a></p> 
 <p>  <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Such thoughts are prompted by Supay <a name="fr_6"></a><a href="#fn_6"><font size="1">1</font></a>;<br> That evil being possesses thee.<br> All round are beauteous girls to choose<br> Before old age, and weakness come.<br> If the great Inca knew thy plot<br> And what thou seekest to attain,<br> Thy head would fall by his command,<br> Thy body would be quickly burnt.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. Boy, do not dare to cross me thus.<br> One more such word and thou shalt die.<br> These hands will tear thee limb from limb,<br> If still thy councils are so base.<br>   <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Well! treat thy servant as a dog,<br> But do not night and day repeat,<br> 'Piqui Chaqui! swift of foot!<br> Go once more to seek the star.'<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. Have I not already said<br> That e'en if death's fell scythe <a name="fr_7"></a><a href="#fn_7"><font size="1">2</font></a> was here,<br> If mountains should oppose my path<br> Like two fierce foes <a name="fr_8"></a><a href="#fn_8"><font size="1">3</font></a> who block the way,<br> Yet will I fight all these combined<br> And risk all else to gain my end,<br> And whether it be life or death<br> I'll cast myself at Coyllur's feet.<br>   <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Rut if Supay himself should come?<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. I'd strike the evil spirit down.</p>

 <p>  <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. If thou shouldst only see his nose,<br> Thou wouldst not speak as thou dost now.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. Now, Piqui Chaqui, speak the truth,<br> Seek not evasion or deceit.<br> Dost thou not already know,<br> Of all the flowers in the field,<br> Not one can equal my Princess?<br>   <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Still, my master, thou dost rave.<br> I think I never saw thy love.<br> Stay! was it her who yesterday<br> Came forth with slow and faltering steps<br> And sought a solitary <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">1</font></a> path <a name="fr_10"></a><a href="#fn_10"><font size="1">2</font></a>?<br> If so, 'tis true she's like the sun,<br> The moon less beauteous than her face. <a name="fr_11"></a><a href="#fn_11"><font size="1">3</font></a><br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. It surely was my dearest love.<br> How beautiful, how bright is she<br> This very moment thou must go<br> And take my message to the Star.<br>   <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. I dare not, master; in the day,<br> 1 fear to pass the palace gate.<br> With all the splendour of the court,<br> I could not tell her from the rest.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. Didst thou not say thou sawest her?<br>   <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. I said so, but it was not sense.<br> A star can only shine at night<br> Only at night could I be sure.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. Begone, thou lazy good-for-nought.<br> The joyful star that I adore,<br> If placed in presence of the Sun,<br> Would shine as brightly as before.</p>

 <p>  <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Lo! some person hither comes,<br> Perhaps an old crone seeking alms;<br> Yes! Look! he quite resembles one.<br> Lot him the dangerous message take.<br> Send it by him, O noble Chief!<br> From me they would not hear the tale;<br> Thy page is but a humble lad.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(<i>Enter the</i> UILLAC UMA, or High Priest of the Sun, <i>at the back, arms raised to the Sun. In a grey tunic and black mantle from the shoulders to the ground, a long knife in his belt, the undress </i>chucu<i> on his head</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>  <i>Uillac Uma</i>. O giver of all warmth and light<br> O Sun! I fall and worship thee.<br> For thee the victims are prepared,<br> A thousand llamas and their lambs<br> Are ready for thy festal day.<br> The sacred fire'll lap their blood,<br> In thy dread presence, mighty one,<br> After long fast <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">1</font></a> thy victims fall.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>.

 <p><a name="page_345"><font size="1" color="green">p. 345</font></a></p> 
 <p>  <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Silence, master, do not speak,<br> The old man doubly is informed;<br> Fore-knowing every word you say,<br> Already he has guessed it all.</p> 
 <p>(He lies down on a bank.)</p> 
 <p>  <i>Ollantay</i> (<i>aside</i>). He sees me. I must speak to him.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(<i>The </i>Uillac Uma<i> comes forward</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>O Uillac Uma, Great High Priest,<br> I bow before thee with respect<br> May the skies be clear for thee,<br> And brightest sunshine meet thine eyes.<br>   <i>Uillac Uma</i>. Brave Ollantay! Princely one!<br> May all the teeming land be thine;<br> May thy far-reaching arm of might<br> Reduce the wide-spread universe.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. Old man! thine aspect causes fear,<br> Thy presence here some ill forebodes;<br> All round thee dead men's bones appear,<br> Baskets, flowers, sacrifice.<br> All men when they see thy face<br> Are filled with terror and alarm.<br> What means it all? why comest thou?<br> It wants some months before the least.<br> Is it that the Inca is ill?<br> Perchance hast thou some thought divined<br> Which soon will turn to flowing blood.<br> Why comest thou? the Sun's great day,<br> The Moon's libations are not yet<br> The moon has not yet nearly reached<br> The solemn time for sacrifice.<br>   <i>Uillac Uma</i>. Why dost thou these questions put,<br> In tones of anger and reproach?</p> 
 <p><a name="page_346"><font size="1" color="green">p. 346</font></a></p> 
 <p>Am I, forsooth, thy humble slave?<br> That I know all I'll quickly prove.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. My beating heart is filled with dread,<br> Beholding thee so suddenly;<br> Perchance thy coming is a sign,<br> Of evils overtaking me.<br>   <i>Uillac Uma</i>. Fear not, Ollantay! not for that,<br> The High Priest comes to thee this day.<br> It is perhaps for love of thee,<br> That, as a straw is blown by wind,<br> A friend, this day, encounters thee.<br> Speak to me as to a friend,<br> Hide nothing from my scrutiny.<br> This day I come to offer thee<br> A last and most momentous choice<br> 'Tis nothing less than life or death.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. Then make thy words more clear to me,<br> That I may understand the choice<br> Till now 'tis but a tangled skein,<br> Unravel it that I may know.<br>   <i>Uillac Uma</i>. 'Tis well. Now listen, warlike. Chief<br> My science has enabled me,<br> To learn and see all hidden things<br> Unknown to other mortal men.<br> My power will enable me<br> To make of thee a greater prince.<br> I brought thee up from tender years,<br> And cherished thee with love and care<br> I now would guide thee in the right,<br> And ward off all that threatens thee.<br> As chief of Anti-suyu now,<br> The people venerate thy name;<br> Thy Sovereign trusts and honours thee,<br> E'en to sharing half his realm.<br> From all the rest he chose thee out,</p> 
 <p><a name="page_347"><font size="1" color="green">p. 347</font></a></p> 
 <p>And placed all power in thy hands;<br> He made thy armies great and strong,<br> And strengthened thee against thy foes<br> How numerous soe'er they be,<br> They have been hunted down by thee.<br> Are these good reasons for thy wish,<br> To wound thy Sovereign to the heart?<br> His daughter is beloved by thee;<br> Thy passion thou wouldst fain indulge,<br> Lawless and forbidden though it be.<br> I call upon thee, stop in time,<br> Tear this folly from thy heart.<br> If thy passion is immense,<br> Still let honour hold its place.<br> You reel, you stagger on the brink<br> I'd snatch thee from the very edge.<br> Thou knowest well it cannot be,<br> The Inca never would consent.<br> If thou didst e'en propose it now,<br> He would be overcome with rage;<br> From favoured prince and trusted chief,<br> Thou wouldst descend to lowest rank.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. How is it that thou canst surely know<br> What still is hidden in my heart?<br> Her mother only knows my love,<br> Yet thou revealest all to me.<br>   <i>Uillac Uma</i>. I read thy secret on the moon,<br> As if upon the Quipu knots;<br> And what thou wouldst most surely hide,<br> Is plain to me as all the rest.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. In my heart I had divined<br> That thou wouldst search me through and through<br> Thou knowest all, O Councillor,<br> And wilt thou now desert thy son?<br>   <i>Uillac Uma</i>. How oft we mortals heedless drink,</p> 
 <p><a name="page_348"><font size="1" color="green">p. 348</font></a></p> 
 <p>A certain death from golden cup<br> Recall to mind how ills befall,<br> And that a stubborn heart 's the cause.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i> (<i>kneeling</i>). Plunge that dagger in my breast,<br> Thou holdst it ready in thy belt;<br> Cut out my sad and broken heart<br> I ask the favour at thy feet.<br>   <i>Uillac Uma</i> (<i>to</i> Piqui Chaqui). Gather me that flower, boy.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(Piqui Chaqui <i>gives him a withered flower and lies down again, pretending to sleep</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>(<i>To</i> Ollantay). Behold, it is quite dead and dry.<br> Once more behold! e'en now it weeps,<br> It weeps. The water flows from it.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(<i>Water flows out of the flower</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>  <i>Ollantay</i>. More easy for the barren rocks<br> Or for sand to send forth water,<br> Than that I should cease to love<br> The fair princess, the joyful star.<br>   <i>Uillac Uma</i>. Put a seed into the ground,<br> It multiplies a hundredfold;<br> The more thy crime shall grow and swell,<br> The greater far thy sudden fall.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. Once for all, I now confess<br> To thee, O great and mighty Priest;<br> Now learn my fault. To thee I speak,<br> Since thou hast torn it from my heart.<br> The lasso to tie me is long,<br> 'Tis ready to twist round my throat<br> Yet its threads are woven with gold,<br> It avenges a brilliant crime.<br> Cusi Coyllur e'en now is my wife,<br> Already we 're bound and are one;</p> 
 <p><a name="page_349"><font size="1" color="green">p. 349</font></a></p> 
 <p>My blood now runs in her veins,<br> E'en now I am noble as she.<br> Her mother has knowledge of all,<br> The Queen can attest what I say;<br> Let me tell all this to the King,<br> I pray for thy help and advice.<br> I will speak without fear and with force,<br> He may perhaps give way to his rage<br> Yet he may consider my youth,<br> May remember the battles I've fought;<br> The record is carved on my club.</p><dir> <dir>  
 <p>(<i>Holds up his </i>macana.)</p></dir> </dir>  
 <p>He may think of his enemies crushed,<br> The thousands I've thrown at his feet.<br>   <i>Uillac Uma</i>. Young Prince! thy words are too bold,<br> Thou hast twisted the thread of thy fate--<br> Beware, before 'tis too late;<br> Disentangle and weave it afresh,<br> Go alone to speak to the King,<br> Alone bear the blow that you seek;<br> Above all let thy words be but few,<br> And say them with deepest respect;<br> Be it life, be it death that you find,<br> I will never forget thee, my son.</p> 
 <p align="RIGHT">[<i>Walks up and exit</i>.</p> 
 <p>  <i>Ollantay</i>. Ollantay, thou art a man,<br> No place in thy heart for fear;<br> Cusi Coyllur, surround me with light.<br> Piqui Chaqui, where art thou?<br>   <i>Piqui Chaqui</i> (<i>jumping up</i>). I was asleep, my master,<br> And dreaming of evil things.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. Of what?<br>   <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Of a fox with a rope round its neck.</p> 
 <p><a name="page_350"><font size="1" color="green">p. 350</font></a></p> 
 <p>  <i>Ollantay</i>. Sure enough, thou art the fox.<br>   <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. It is true that my nose is growing finer,<br> And my ears a good deal longer.<br>   <i>Ollantay</i>. Come, lead me to the Coyllur.<br>   <i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. It is still daylight.</p>
