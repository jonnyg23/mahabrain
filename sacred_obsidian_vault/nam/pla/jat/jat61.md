 <h3 align="CENTER">59. THE HORSES OF THE OLLERO ARE STOLEN.</h3>
 <font face="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><p>Long ago the Ollero came to Cimarron where the Llanero were then living and said, "We are going to hunt buffalo." Maxwell, having loaned them a number of good horses, burros, and mules, they went away to the plains and camped near the Canadian River. Having camped successively at K'aixactciye, Dakûgaye, and TseLîtcî naxabîLîye "stone red hangs down" they came to Nadôstse?aLîye "where pipes are made." They had now reached the range of the buffalo but there were none there except a few who were roaming about by themselves. They caught two buffalo calves with a lasso and led them home.</p>
 <p>Breaking camp, they traveled east to Red River, having camped on the way at Cheyenne Canyon and at NabeLtc'îdîye. Riding down the river, they came to a large herd of buffalo. Riding in among them they killed several and brought the meat back home. The next day they went again after the buffalo, securing several which they brought back. Although they now had much meat they went again, on the third day, and brought back a large quantity.</p>
 <p>That night, after it was dark, the enemy came and drove away half of their horses. The next day when their loss had been discovered they rode after the enemy but did not overtake them. After two days, they gave up the pursuit and returned to the place where the horses were driven off. Those who had extra horses lent them to those who were without for the packing of their loads. As they went back, some of the men rode far out on each side, watching for the enemy. They discovered a band of wild horses and sent word to the main party who immediately caught their good horses and rode after them. They found the wild horses on the south side of a dry lake. The wild horses having been already surrounded noticed the men, stood looking at them for an instant and then broke away. The Indians rode after them and turned them back. Coming toward them from both directions, they caught a good many. A colt was following close behind a wild horse which a man who was chasing kept missing. Soon after, having caught another wild horse, he succeeded in catching the horse which the colt was following and when he stopped it the colt stopped also. Everyone laughed. They brought many of the wild horses back to their camp.</p>
 <p>As they came back toward the west up Canadian River they saw wild horses again near the Salt River. Surrounding them, they caught two.</p>
 <p>From there they came to Cimarron having camped at Nagôntt'iye, Dakûgâye, K'aixactc'îye, and at the Canadian River. The Ollero went westward to their own country, and camped near El Rito. We camped on the</p>
 <p><a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 250</font></a></p>
 <p>other side of the Rio Grande by Cimarron which was our country. The enemy used to come after us there at Cimarron but we did not come westward on that account for we were not afraid of them. We used to go to the east and fight them, Sometimes the horses gave out on the journey and had to be left behind. If any of the enemy were killed their horses were taken away. When they returned with scalps, they camped about Cimarron and danced. They always kept watch toward the east while they were dancing.</p>
