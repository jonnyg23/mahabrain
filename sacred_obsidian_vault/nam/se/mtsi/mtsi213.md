 <h3 align="CENTER">13. THE STORY OF AN ORPHAN (7)</h3>
 <p>An orphan was traveling along and other persons said, "Let us cross to the other side of this big river." They took the orphan along. They went together and reached the other side. They told him to</p>

 <p>wander off [hunting] and when he did so they got into the boat and went away, leaving him there. Then the orphan said, "Hold on, I want to go too," but they left him and went away. Not knowing what to do, the orphan traveled along by the river. He traveled, traveled, and presently a Woodpecker came close to him singing. "Hī+yi', I will knock you down and kill you," said the orphan. "Don't. I am making a noise because I have something to tell you." "All right. Tell it to me!" he said and he rubbed red paint on the Woodpecker's head. Then the latter said to him, "Something big is pursuing you. Make many arrows. And as you travel make, four wooden rollers, travel on, and sit at the end of a bent-over tree. The big thing, Big Man-eater, will come there with some huge dogs."</p>
 <p>He got there with the dogs. Then the man was sitting up in the tree. And he threw the rollers one by one far out on the water. Each time he did so the dogs jumped in after it. When he threw in the fourth one, the dogs did not want to go in after it. So Big Man-eater became angry and killed all of his four big dogs. He took out a little clay pot which he always carried in his pocket and made it large by snapping his fingers against it. He set it down right at the very edge of the water, made a fire, and put water into the pot. Then he put all of his dogs into it, cooked them, and devoured them all. He put all of their bones into the water, stood on the bank and called all of his dogs by name. One shook himself and came out. All four did the same thing. He called to them and started off and they disappeared.</p>
 <p>Then the orphan climbed down, made many arrows, and traveled on. As he was going along he shot and killed a bird. He killed a number of them and roasted them. Then he took them with him and stood on the bank of the river. He called, "My grandfather," upon which the turtle, alligator, loggerhead turtle came out in succession. "Not you," he said. After they had gone away the Horned Snake came out. "You are the one," he said. Then it came close to him and lay still on the water. It was very pretty, having one blue and one red horn, and he sat upon them. Then he threw a bird far off. The Snake shot forward, picked it up, and ate it. When it was finished the orphan threw another far out. While he was doing this he was sawing upon the horn with a strong rope he had. He threw another far off and the Snake went on with him. Meanwhile he kept sawing upon the horn. Now the Horned Snake said, "What are you doing to my horn?" It gave him an itching feeling. "I am doing nothing," he answered. "I like it and so I am patting it." He went on in this manner until there were no more birds. Then he shot an arrow to a great distance and the Snake went on rapidly with him. When he got to the arrow he seized it by the ligaments used in fastening on the feathers and swallowed it. When he was about to sink the man shot another. The last one stuck into the ground close</p>
 <p><a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 177</font></a></p>
 <p>to the water. At that time the horn was about cut through. Holding it, he jumped and reached shore with the broken horn. The bank slid back under him, but he kept on and got out. Then he started on.</p>
 <p>When he had nearly reached the house where his sister lived he stuck up an arrow at a spring by the road. Then his sister came for water and saw the arrow. She said, "This looks like my brother's arrow. I think he is not in this world and has been dead a long time." Then her brother, who had hidden himself, stood up and said, "Hē+, I am not dead. I have returned." He talked to her.</p>
 <p>When he was on his travels they said to him, "Your sister has married Owl. They have a little owl baby." So he said to his sister, "They say you have married Owl." She answered, "I have married him. He whips me all the time." At that her brother was very angry. He said, "When I come, heat some water boiling hot on the fire. Call to Owl and when he looks toward you throw the little owl into the water and run this way."</p>
 <p>When he got there Owl was seated fixing an ax handle. Then the woman called to Owl. When he looked toward her she threw the little owl into the hot water and ran off. Owl ran toward her, holding his ax handle; but, when they got near, her brother, who was hidden, stood up. His sister went round and stood behind him. Owl came on, intending to hit her, and suddenly saw her brother. He said, "O-oh, I was just playing with you." But the brother shot him through with an arrow.</p>
