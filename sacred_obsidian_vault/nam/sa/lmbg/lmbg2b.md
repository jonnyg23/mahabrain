 Where land appears above the tidal wave;<br>
 And from their swampy refuges they come,<br>
 Beneath our rule to find a peaceful home.<br>

 More numerous than other tribes they seem.<br>
 And farther east, where ita swamps abound,<br>
 Even in Surinam, the Warau race is found.<br></td></tr>

 Unkempt, unclad, their women there we found;<br>
 Their naked children wallowed on the ground,<br>
 With filth and ashes grimed—sad sight to see:<br>
 We wondered how such way of life could be!<br>
 Most wild and gaunt the men, who took no care,<br>
 And only wished to be—just what they were.<br>
 Lower than others, as he would allow,<br>
 And satisfied to be so, was the poor Warau!<a name="page_53_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_53_note_1"><font size="1">1</font></a><br></td></tr>

 <table align="center" cellpadding="10">
 
 <tr><td>T<small>HEIR</small> ancient belief we had long wished to hear:<br>
 Some had said 'twas "romantic," while others said "queer."<br>
   But, from shyness or fear,<br>
   Till the twenty-first year,<br>
 Of their most knowing sorcerers none would come near.<br>
 Then, at last, a friend told me to send for "McLeod,"<br>
 
 
 <!------------------------page 54------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a>
 
 <br>
 Who to be their <i>most learned</i> by all was allowed.<br>
   And that Warau of fame<br>
   (With the highland Scotch name),<br>
 After long hesitation, consented, and came.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>His visit to us was a favour most rare:<br>
 So myself, our good teacher, and other friends there,<br>
 With honour received him, and offered—a chair.<br>
   But he sat on the ground,<br>
   With his Waraus around,<br>
 Whose costume was most "light and airy" we found.<br>
   They—with long, matted hair,<br>
   And bare skins—squatted there,<br>
 While their chief a striped shirt condescended to wear.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>  Their traditional "word"<br>
   A good friend there had heard;<br>
 Partly Warau was he, and to him we referred.<br>
 For a mixture most strange through some tales seemed to run;<br>
 Their most serious matters so blended with fun,<br>
 That (though none of the red men there thought it absurd)<br>
 <i>We</i> could scarcely believe it the "Old people's word."<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>"Oh tell me, McLeod, did not slaughter and woe<br>
 First cause the Waraus to that swamp-land to go?<br>
 Did you not live inland, where the clear waters flow,<br>
 Ere the fortune of war sternly drove you below?"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>"Stern foes have indeed caused the Waraus to fly:<br>
   But they first lived on high,<br>
   Above yonder blue sky,<br>
 Ere they came down the good things of this world to try.<br>

 Who thus rashly lost their high station in heaven!"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>  We opened our eyes;<br>

 Superior smiled, and enjoyed our surprise.<br>
 Then resumed: "What I tell you, you will not believe,<br>

 LEGEND OF OKONORÓTÉ.</h3>
 
 <table align="center" cellpadding="10">
 
 <tr><td>"Say, Okonoróté, thou archer so gay,<br>
 With bright feathered ornaments, whither away?<br>
 Let the birds now beware or thy clear, glancing eye;<br>
 For thine arrows bear death to all creatures that fly!"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>"With my arrows so keen I pursue a rare bird,<br>
 Of whose lovely plumage we often have heard;<br>
 That bird I must find, though I cannot tell where;<br>
 But its flesh I must eat, and its plumage must wear."<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>So Okonoróté went forth on his way,<br>
 To seek that rare bird with its plumage so gay.<br>
 He could only shoot <i>birds</i>, for above the blue sky<br>
 Were no living creatures, save those that could fly,<br>
 And the young Warau race, who in that high abode<br>
 Had been placed by their Maker, the Wise and the Good.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>That search he engaged in for many a day;<br>
 But still, as it saw him, the bird flew away,<br>
 Till (surely some evil one brought it to pass)<br>
 He saw it alight in a clump of high grass.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>
 
 <!------------------------page 56------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 56</font></a>
 
 <br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Then, lying flat down, he slid over the ground,<br>
 Like tiger or snake which some victim has found;<br>
 The distance diminished, yet still he crawled on,<br>
 Saying, "Oh for one shot ere the bird shall be gone!"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>At length he had crawled within shot of that bird,<br>
 When lo! it flew up, as some movement it heard.<br>
 With keen arrow transfixed the bright beauty was slain,<br>
 And, with quivering wing, fluttered down to the plain.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Glad Okonoróté sprang up with a bound,<br>
 And, shouting for joy, made the meadows resound.<br>
 "No longer," said he, "need I rise with the sun<br>
 To pursue this bright bird, for my prize now is won!"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>   Then he searched all the ground—<br>
    Walked around and around;<br>
 Strange!—arrow and bird were nowhere to be found!<br>
    Such a loss who could bear?<br>
    He looked everywhere,<br>
 Till he saw a deep pit, and said, "Both must be there;"<br>
 And the sides being steep, he approached it with care.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>But gone was his arrow for ever and aye;<br>
 Gone too that bright bird with its plumage so gay.<br>
 And he, fascinated, unable to move,<br>
 Saw daylight <i>beneath</i>, him, as well as above!<br>
    There, far, far below,<br>
    He could see forests grow;<br>
 Wide plains, and savannahs, where rivulets flow.<br>
 And he looked down for hours those new wonders to view,<br>
 Thinking, "All is a <i>dream</i>, sure it cannot be true!<br>
 
 
 <!------------------------page 57------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 57</font></a>
 
 <br>
    "Some charm fills mine eye,<br>
    Or do I espy<br>
 On the green plains below, <i>living creatures</i> pass by?"<br>
  He could see there the deer and the peccary go,<br>
 The choice paca, and others, which now we all know;<br>
    While birds which soar high,<br>
    Rising near to the sky,<br>
 And some, nearer earth, his clear vision could spy!<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="center">*  *  *  *  *  *</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>"Now hear, Waraus all! You know what I have seen;<br>
 And many here present to view it have been.<br>
 Prepare a rope ladder; I must go below<br>
 And see if those creatures are useful or no.<br>
 If it be as I hope, 'tis our people's great gain,<br>
 And if I lose my life, one man only is slain."<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Oh, great was their fear lest his life he should lose;<br>
 But Okonoróté none e'er could refuse.<br>
 So all to the woods, picking cotton, would go,<br>
 For forests of cotton were there, as we know.<br>
 (Perhaps they used "bush-ropes" the cotton to aid).<br>
 It took many months, but the ladder they made.<br>
 It was lengthened above when too short it was found,<br>
 Till it grappled the trees upon this lower ground;<br>
 And it then, tight above, with strong braces was bound.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Bold Okonoróté, determined to go,<br>
 Strong-limbed, and brave-hearted, then ventured below.<br>
 'Twas a perilous venture, to come from above<br>
 By a ladder so frail, which light currents could move.<br>
 
 <!------------------------page 58------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 58</font></a>
 
 <br>
 And when he was down, he stood gazing around<br>
 In utter amazement at all things he found;<br>
 The fire, so abundant, he saw with surprise,<br>
 The quadrupeds strange, and their wonderful size:<br>
 For all seemed most wonderful then to his eyes.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>He must have seen wild beasts devouring their prey,<br>
 For jaguars and snakes then had all their own way.<br>
 And he thought he would venture to taste some large game,<br>
 So he shot a young deer, and soon kindled a flame,<br>
 In the Indian style, with two pieces of wood;<br>
 And the ven'son he found to be excellent food.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Ascending again!—Oh, what labour and pain<br>
 To the quick-heaving chest!—to the limbs, what a strain!<br>
 It was hard to come down; but to climb up again!<br>
    (Though we came from the sky,<br>
    <i>I</i> had rather not try:<br>
 Some people turn giddy when mounting too high.)<br>
 It was done but <i>that once</i>, as you'll find by and by.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>A portion of game he brought up from below;<br>
 Not much, but sufficient his people to show:<br>
 His words (and its flavour) put all in a glow.<br>
 "Oh! we cannot stay here; for there is little good<br>
 In the small birds around us: but animal food<br>
    We know to abound<br>
    On that lower ground,<br>
 Which Okonoroté for Waraus has found!"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>So they asked no permission, but said, "We will go!"<br>
 And came down the rope ladder to this world below.<br>
 
 
 <!------------------------page 59------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 59</font></a>
 
 <br>
 All things then were young—no old people were found;<br>
 Small children they carried, and all reached the ground<br>
 In safety, save one—a poor woman, the last,<br>
 Who got wedged in the hole which the others had passed.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Her husband below her sore trouble could view,<br>
 And climbed back to give help, but could not get her through;<br>
 Then, his head turning giddy, he went down below,<br>
 Where his people all thought it a terrible blow,<br>
 And in clamorous talking gave vent to their woe.<br>
 They all asked how it happened. He could not tell how;<br>
 So the thing was mysterious to ev'ry Warau.<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Then the women, upbraiding, would ask, "Is it right<br>
 For that man to come down, and not stay up all night?<br>
 Brave Okonoróté! he climbed up before;<br>
 Will he not go up now, with a man or two more,<br>
 Since the husband, resigned, has quite given it o'er!"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>They all shrunk from the task, for a man there had said,<br>
 Whom they straightway discovered to have a wise head,<br>
 "Supposing you reach her, and can pull her through,<br>
 Will she not be the death of you all, if you do?<br>
    You will find it no fun—<br>
    She will come with a run;<br>
 Consider how you, in that case, can hold on?<br>
 You must be swept off, and our best men be gone."<br></td></tr>

 <tr><td>So the woman remains (though the ladder gave way),<br>
 And will always remain there, our old Waraus say,<br>
 <i>She fills up the hole</i>; and, good friends, that is why<br>
 We never can get a <i>fair peep though the sky!</i>"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="center">*  *  *  *  *  *</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>He paused. Some were laughing, and all the rest smiled<br>
 At a "descent from heaven" so grotesque and wild,<br>
 Then the old Warau said, "You all think I 'make fun;'<br>
 But it is in <i>this way</i> that the legend must run,<br>
 And so I must tell it. If not, I have done!"<br></td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>Being soothed, he resumed, in a different tone,<br>
 For the course of his legends more serious had grown.<br></td></tr>
