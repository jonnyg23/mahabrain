 <p align="center"><small><i>General outline—Signification of cards—How to consult the cards—An illustration—Its reading</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>HERE again the pack of thirty-two cards is used, the cards from two to six inclusively being discarded, as in "The Combination of Sevens."</p>  <h4 align="center">General Outline.</h4>  
 <p>The general meaning pertaining to each suit is as follows: The court cards bear the signification of people, and the king, queen, and knave in each suit suggest relationship. The kings indicate the profession followed.</p>  
 <p>Thus, the king of spades denotes a literary man, or one whose desires would lead him to the pulpit or the platform.</p>  
 <p>The king of hearts is the symbol of a wealthy man—one who deals with large sums of money—for instance, a banker, capitalist, or stockbroker.</p>  
 <p>The king of clubs indicates the mental side of business, and here we look for the lawyer or barrister.</p>  
 <p>The king of diamonds is a business man—one who will depend on both his brain and hands for work. Diamonds are eminently the practical suit, and must always be consulted with reference to the subject's condition in life. They signify the material side of life, and according to the needs, so this suit indicates success, or the absence of it—failure.</p>  
 <p>There is a very slight variation in the signification of the cards as given in the preceding method, but it is well to observe it carefully, as the mode of procedure is entirely different.</p>

 <p>The inquirer is to shuffle the pack of cards and cut it into three. Take up the cards and let your subject draw any chance card that he pleases. Place this card on the table, and the suit from which it is drawn will determine the representative card, as it is an indication of the character of your subject.</p>  
 <p>A lady is represented by a queen, a man by a king, and the knave stands for the male relations or thoughts.</p>  
 <p>After the card is drawn, place the remainder on the table in four rows, beginning each row from left to right.</p>  
 <p>The cards that immediately surround the king or queen aid us in our judgment of the inquirer; and remember that the right hand card is the more important one.</p>  <h4 align="center">An Illustration.</h4>  
 <p>A practical illustration will exemplify my meaning, and again we will suppose a lady has cut the cards to have her fortune read.</p>  
 <p>The cards being shuffled and cut into three, the card was drawn, and as this proved to be a seven of clubs, so the queen represented the subject in this instance. When the cards were placed in order this is how they appeared.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="green">p. 55</font></a></p>  
 <p>First line.—Seven of clubs, eight of clubs, king of clubs, seven of hearts, king of diamonds, nine of diamonds, ten of diamonds, king of hearts.</p>  
 <p>Second line.—Seven of spades, nine of spades, knave of hearts, king of spades, eight of spades, queen of spades, ten of spades, ace of diamonds.</p>  
 <p>Third line.—Ace of spades, knave of clubs, queen of clubs, ten of hearts, ace of hearts, queen of diamonds, ace of clubs, nine of hearts.</p>  
 <p>Fourth line.—Knave of spades, seven of diamonds, eight of hearts, nine of clubs, eight of diamonds, knave of diamonds, queen of hearts, ten of clubs.</p>  <h4 align="center">Its Reading.</h4>  
 <p>Now we can proceed with the reading:—</p>  
 <p>As the suit of clubs is a pleasant one, we may conclude the lady is of a cheerful temperament. The seven itself signifies gain and prosperity, and the eight pleasure, which come to the inquirer through the king of clubs—typical of a solicitor. The seven of hearts indicates that a fair man is in love with the inquirer. The nine of diamonds, with the joyful ten beside it, seems to foretell a birth, and the king of hearts stands for a good friend. But the seven and nine of spades, in conjunction, inform us that some annoyance is coming which is possibly connected with the king of hearts.</p>  
 <p>The king of spades, accompanied by the eight of that suit, tells that this man is suffering considerable grief and vexation on account of the queen of clubs, suffering which will cause another woman to be jealous.</p>  
 <p>The queen and ten of spades, with the ace of spades, imply disagreeable tidings; but as the knave of clubs appears side by side with the queen of that suit (the inquirer), and they are followed by the ten of hearts, it will in no wise disturb the affection of either. The knave here may be taken to indicate the thoughts or intentions of the king. The ace of hearts seems to promise great tranquillity and happiness in the domestic life. A near relation, one deeply interested in the queen of clubs, is represented by the queen of diamonds. The ace of clubs shows that a letter is on its way.</p>  
 <p>The nine of hearts, the wish or betrothal card, follows, and</p>  
 <p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></a></p>  
 <p>from this I should infer that a proposal of marriage will come by letter, and one which will most probably be accepted. The knave of spades is followed by the seven of diamonds and the eight of hearts, which shows that the queen of clubs has been much loved by some one, and that an offer of marriage will have to be considered either directly before or immediately after a journey. The inquirer will have a great deal of pleasure on a journey. The queen of hearts and knave of diamonds indicate good friends who show her much kindness, and there will be welcome tidings for her across the water.</p>  
 <p>Now, count the rows, and should the betrothal card (the nine of hearts) appear in the third or fourth row, that number of years must elapse before becoming affianced.</p>  
 <p>Count the rows again until the one in which the ten of hearts (the marriage card) appears. In this example the betrothal and marriage card both appear in the third row, which indicates that the inquirer will be engaged in about three years, and marriage will take place soon after.</p>
