 <p><small><i>Knowledge is power—Four twos added to the usual pack—The thirty-six squares and their significance—Tendencies of the suits</i>.</small></p>  <h4 align="center">Knowledge is Power.</h4>  
 <p>WE have here a detailed and exhaustive method by which the cards can be read. The beginner may feel somewhat alarmed at the mass of explanatory matter there is for him to study, but when once the information has been acquired, the would-be cartomancer will find he possesses a sense of power and comprehension, that will give both confidence and dexterity to his attempts to unravel the thread of destiny.</p>  <h4 align="center">Four Twos Added to the Usual Pack.</h4>  
 <p>The selected pack of thirty-two cards, which have been mentioned in connection with several of the preceding methods, are in this case augmented by the addition of the four twos, one of which is sometimes taken as the representative of the inquirer. There is no hard and fast rule about this, however, and another card may be taken if preferred. The accompanying table shows that not only has each card its own signification, but that every position upon the table within the cube in which the cards are arranged has its own meaning. These must be carefully studied, first separately and then together. It would be a help to the beginner to make a separate chart for his own use, and to have it at hand when laying the cards according to this system.</p>

 <p>The thirty-six cards must be shuffled and cut in the usual way, and then placed upon the table in six rows of six cards each, starting from the left-hand corner where square No. 1 is marked on the chart.

 <p>Covered by a diamond, the lawful ambitions of the inquirer will be partially frustrated, by the ill-will and jealousy of certain acquaintances.</p>  
 <p>Covered by a spade, the principal ambition of the inquirer will be defeated by underhand transactions, and he will even suffer from the consequences of perfectly justifiable steps which he may take to accomplish his desire.</p>  <h5 align="center">No. 36, SICKNESS—ILL-HEALTH.</h5>  
 <p>Covered by a heart, the inquirer will suffer from passing ailments, that will leave no bad results.</p>  
 <p>Covered by a club, a rather serious illness may be expected.</p>  
 <p>Covered by a diamond, an acute attack of a definite disease.</p>  
 <p>Covered by a spade, a very severe illness, that may materially interfere with the inquirer's career or happiness.</p>  <h4 align="center">Tendencies of the Suits.</h4>  
 <p>It will be seen in the foregoing definitions that hearts are almost invariably the sign of good luck, love, and happiness. Even where the position is indicative of misfortune, the presence of a heart has a mitigating effect upon the evil. Clubs rank next in order of good fortune, and seem specially connected with the precious gift of true friendship. Diamonds seem accompanied by the disquieting elements of jealousy and rivalry, which strew obstacles in the path to success and happiness, while for sheer bad luck and dire disaster the ill-omened suit of spades stands unrivalled.</p>
