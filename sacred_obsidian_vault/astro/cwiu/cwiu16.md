 <p><a name="an_1_1">1</a>. Cf. A. N. Whitehead, <i>Science and the modern world</i>, New York, 1925; E. A. Burtt, <i>The metaphysical foundations of modern physical science</i>, New York, 1926; J. H. Randall, <i>The making of the modern mind</i>, Boston, 1926; Arthur O. Lovejoy's classical <i>Great chain of being</i>, Cambridge, Mass., 1936, and my own <i>Études Galiléennes</i>, Paris, 1939.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_2">2</a>. The cosmos conception is only practically, that is, historically, linked together with the geocentric world-view. Yet it can be completely divorced from the latter as, for example, by Kepler.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_3">3</a>. The full story of the transformation of the space conception from the Middle Ages to modern times should include the history of the Platonic and Neoplatonic revival from the Florentine Academy to the Cambridge Platonists as well as that of the atomic conceptions of matter and the discussions about the vacuum following the experiments of Galileo, Torricelli and Pascal. But this would double the volume of this work and, besides, distract us somewhat from the very definite and precise line of development which we are following here. Moreover, for some of these problems we can refer our readers to the classical books of Kurd Lasswitz, <i>Geschichte des Atomistik</i>, 2 vols., Hamburg und Berlin, 1890, and Ernst Cassirer, <i>Das Erkenntnisproblem in der Philosophie und Wissenschaft der neuen Zeit</i>, 2 vols., Berlin, 1911, as well as to the recent works of Cornelis de Waard, <i>Lexpérience barométrique, ses antécédents et ses explications</i>, Thouars, 1936, and Miss Marie Boas, "Establishment of the mechanical philosophy," <i>Osiris</i>, vol. x, 1952. See now Max Jammer, <i>Concepts of space</i>, Harvard Univ. Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1954, and Markus Fierz, "Ueber den Ursprung und Bedeutung von Newtons Lehre vom absoluten Raum," <i>Gesnerus</i>, vol. xi, fasc. 3 / 4, 1954, especially for the space conceptions of Telesio Pattrizzi and Campanella.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_4">4</a>. On the Greek conceptions of the universe cf. Pierre Duhem, <i>Le système du monde</i>, vol. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">i</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii</span>, Paris, 1913, 1914; R. Mondolfo, <i>Linfinito nel pensiero dei Greci</i>, Firenze, 1934, and Charles Mugler, <i>Devenir cyclique et la pluralité des mondes</i>, Paris, 1953.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 278</font></a></p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_5">5</a>. The MS of <i>De rerum natura</i> was discovered in 1417. On its reception and influence cf. J. H. Sandys, <i>History of classical scholarship</i>, Cambridge, 1908, and G. Hadzitz, <i>Lucretius and his influence</i>, New York, 1935.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_6">6</a>. The first Latin translation of Diogenes Laertius <i>De vita et moribus philosophorum</i> by Ambrosius Civenius appeared in Venice in 1475 and was immediately reprinted in Nürnberg in 1476 and 1479.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_7">7</a>. The atomism of the ancients, at least in the aspect presented to us by Epicurus and Lucretiusit may be that it was different with Democritus, but we know very little about Democrituswas not a scientific theory, and though some of its precepts, as for instance, that which enjoins us to explain the celestial phenomena on the pattern of the terrestrial ones, <i>seem</i> to lead to the unification of the world achieved by modern science, it has never been able to yield a foundation for development of a physics; not even in modern times: indeed, its revival by Gassendi remained perfectly sterile. The explanation of this sterility lies, in my opinion, in the extreme sensualism of the Epicurean tradition; it is only when this sensualism was rejected by the founders of modern science and replaced by a mathematical approach to nature that atomismin the works of Galileo, R. Boyle, Newton, etc.became a scientifically valid conception, and Lucretius and Epicurus appeared as forerunners of modern science. It is possible, of course, and even probable, that, in linking mathematism with atomism, modern science revived the deepest intuitions and intentions of Democritus.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_8">8</a>. Cf. René Descartes, "Lettre à Chanut," June 6, 1647, <i>Oeuvres</i>, ed. Adam Tannery, vol. v, p. 50 sq., Paris, 1903.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_9">9</a>. Nicholas of Cusa (Nicholas Krebs or Chrypffs) was born in 1401 in Cues (or Cusa) on the Moselle. He studied law and mathematics in Padua, then theology in Cologne. As archdeacon of Liège he was a member of the Council of Basel (1437), was sent to Constantinople to bring about a union of the Eastern and Western churches, and to Germany as papal legate (1440). In 1448 he was raised by Pope Nicholas V to the cardinalate, and in 1450 he was appointed Bishop of Britten. He died August 11, 1464. On Nicholas of Cusa cf. Edmond Vansteenberghe, <i>Le Cardinal Nicolas de Cues</i>, Paris, 1920; Henry Bett, <i>Nicolas of Cusa</i>, London, 1932; Maurice de Gandillac, <i>La philosophie de Nicolas de Cues</i>, Paris, 1941.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_10">10</a>. Cf. Ernst Hoffmann, <i>Das Universum von Nikolas von Cues</i>, especially the <i>Textbeilage</i> by Raymond Klibansky, pp. 41 sq., which gives the text of Nicholas of Cusa in a critical edition as well as the bibliography of the problem. The booklet of E. Hoffmann appeared as "Cusanus</p>

 <p><a name="an_1_11">11</a>. Cf. <i>De docta ignorantia</i>, 1. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii</span>, cap. ii, p. 99. I am following the text of the latest, critical, edition of the works of Nicholas of Cusa by E. Hoffmann-R. Klibansky (<i>Opera omnia, Jussu et auctoritate Academiae litterarum Heidelbergensii ad codicum fidem edita</i>, vol. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">i</span>, Lipsiae, 1932). There is, now, an English translation of the <i>De docta ignorantia</i> by Fr. Germain Heron: <i>Of learned ignorance</i> by Nicholas Cusanus, London, 1954. I have, nevertheless, preferred to give my own translation of the texts I am quoting.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_12">12</a>. <i>Ibid</i>., p. 99 sq.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_13">13</a>. <i>Ibid</i>., p. 100.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_14">14</a>. <i>Ibid</i>., p. 100 sq. It is to be remembered, however, that the conception of the relativity of motion, at least in the sense of the necessity to relate motion to a resting reference-point (or body) is nothing new and can already be found in Aristotle; cf. P. Duhem, <i>Le mouvement absolu et le mouvement relatif</i>, Montlignon, 1909; the optical relativity of motion is studied at length by Witello (cf. <i>Opticae libri decem</i>, p. 167, Basilae, 1572) and, even more extensively, by Nicole Oresme, (cf. <i>Le livre du ciel et de la terre</i>, ed. by A. D. Meuret and A. J. Denomy, C. S. B., pp. 271 sq., Toronto, 1943).</p>

 <p><a name="an_1_18">18</a>. Cf. the famous passage of Virgil, <i>Provehimur portu terraeque urbesque recedunt</i>, quoted by Copernicus.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_19">19</a>. This famous saying which describes God as a <i>sphaera cuius centrum ubique, circumferentia nullibi</i> appears for the first time in this form in the pseudo-Hermetic <i>Book of the XXIV philosophers</i>, an anonymous compilation of the XIIth century; cf. Clemens Baemker, <i>Das pseudohermetische Buch der XXIV Meister</i> (Beiträge zur Geschichte der Philosophie und Theologie des Mittelalters, fasc. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">xxv</span>), Münster, 1928; Dietrich Mahnke, <i>Unendliche Sphaere und Allmittelpunct</i>, Halle/Saale, 1937. In this <i>Book of the XXIV philosophers</i>, the above-mentioned formula forms the proposition <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii</span>.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_20">20</a>. He is, however, referred to by Giovanni Francesco Pico in his <i>Examen doctae vanitatis gentium</i> (Opera, t. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii</span>, p. 773, Basileae, 1573) and Celio Calcagnini in his <i>Quod coelum stet, terra moveatur, vel de perenni motu terrae</i> (<i>Opera aliquot</i>, p. 395, Basileae, 1544); cf. R. Klibansky, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 41.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_280"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 280</font></a></p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_21">21</a>. Cf. L. A. Birkenmajer, <i>Mikolaj Kopernik</i>, vol. i, p. 248, Cracow, 1900. Birkenmajer denies any influence of Nicholas of Cusa on Copernicus. On the medieval "forerunners" of Copernicus cf. G. McColley, "The theory of the diurnal rotation of the earth," <i>Isis</i>, xxvi, 1937.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_22">22</a>. <i>De docta ignorantia</i>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii</span>, 12, p. 104.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_23">23</a>. Nicholas of Cusa's conception could be treated as an anticipation of that of Sir William Herschell; and even of more modern ones.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_1_24">24</a>. <i>De docta ignorantia</i>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii</span>, 12, p. 104.</p>

 <p><a name="an_1_26">26</a>. <i>Ibid</i>., p. 107. Once more, one could see in this conception of Nicholas of Cusa a prefiguration of the theory of the mutual attraction of the heavenly bodies.</p>

 <p><a name="an_1_29">29</a>. Marcellus Stellatus Palingenius, whose true name was Pier Angelo Manzoli, born at La Stellata some time between 1500 and 1503, wrote, under the title of <i>Zodiacus vitae</i>, a didactical poem, which was printed in Venice (probably) in 1534, rapidly became extremely popular, especially among Protestants, and was even translated into English, French and German. The English translation (<i>Zodiake of life</i>) by Barnaby Goodge, appeared in 1560 (the first three books), and in 1565 the entire poem was printed. It seems that Palingenius was at a certain time suspected of heresy, but it was only 15 years after his death (he died in 1543) that, in 1558, the <i>Zodiacus vitae</i> was put on the <i>Index librorum prohibitorum</i>. Under Pope Paul II his bones were disinterred and burnt; cf. F. W. Watson, <i>The Zodiacus Vitae of Marcellus Palingenius Stellatus: An old school book</i>, London, 1908 and F. R. Johnson, <i>Astronomical thought in Renaissance England</i>, pp. 145 sq., Baltimore, 1937.</p>

 <p><a name="an_1_35">35</a>. <i>Ibid</i>., ll. 71-85 (transl., p. 229). The world-view of Palingenius is beautifully expressed by Edmund Spenser in his <i>Hymn of heavenly beauty</i> (quoted by E. M. W. Tillyard, <i>The Elizabethan world picture</i>, p. 45, London, 1943):</p>  
 <p></p><div class="iq">Far above these heavens which here we see, <a name="page_281"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 281</font></a><br> Be others far exceeding these in light,<br> Not bounded, not corrupt, as these same be,<br> But infinite in largeness and in height,<br> Unmoving, incorrupt and spotless bright<br> That need no sun tilluminate their spheres<br> But their own native light far passing theirs<br> And as these heavens still by degree arise<br> Untill they come to their first mover's bound,<br> That in his mighty compass doth comprise<br> And carry all the rest with him around;<br> So those likewise do by degree redound<br> And rise more fair till they at last arrive<br> To the most fair, whereto they all do strive.</div>  <h4 align="center">CHAPTER II</h4>

The disastrous effects of the seventeenth century's spiritual revolution have recently been studied with great care and some nostalgic regret by a number of scholars; cf. <i>inter alia</i>, E. M. W. Tillyard, <i>The Elizabethan world picture</i>, London, 1943; Victor Harris, <i>All coherence gone</i>, Chicago, 1949; Miss Marjorie H. Nicolson, <i>The breaking of the circle</i>, Evanston, Ill., 1950; S. L. Bethell, <i>The cultural revolution of the XVIIth century</i>, London, 1951. For a non-nostalgic treatment cf. A. O. Lovejoy, <i>The great chain of being</i>, and Basil Willey, <i>The seventeenth century background</i>, Cambridge, 1934.</p>

 <p><a name="an_2_7">7</a>. For the pre-modern, that is, pre-telescopic astronomy, fixed stars possess a visible and even measurable diameter. Since, on the other hand, they are rather far away from us and in the Copernican conception even exceedingly far (cf. <i>infra</i>, pp. <a href="cwiu07.htm#page_92">92</a>-9), their real dimensions must be extremely large.</p>

 <p><a name="an_2_15">15</a>. Giordano Bruno understands them as teaching the infinity of the universe. I have already examined the case of Nicholas of Cusa; as for Lucretius, he asserts, indeed, the infinity of space and that of the <i>worlds</i>, but maintains the finiteness of our visible world and the existence of a limiting heavenly sphere, outside of which, but inaccessible to our perception, there are other identical or analogous "worlds." Anachronistically we could consider his conception as prefigurating the modern conception of island-universes dispersed in an infinite space, though with a very important difference: the Lucretian worlds are closed and not connected with each other.</p>

Larkey, "Thomas Digges, the Copernican system and the idea of the infinity of the universe," <i>The Huntington Library Bulletin</i>, n. 5 (1934), and Francis R.

 <p><a name="an_2_19">19</a>. A. O. Lovejoy, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 116. Giordano Bruno was born in Nola (near Naples) in 1548, became a Dominican in 1566, but, ten years later in 1576, on account of some rather heretical views held by him on <a href="errata.htm#7">transubstantiation</a> and the Immaculate Conception, had to leave both the order and Italy. In 1579 he came to Geneva (where he could not stay), then to Toulouse, and to Paris (1581) where he lectured on the logical system of Raymundus Lullus (and wrote some philosophical works, i. e. <i>De umbris idearum</i> and a satiric comedy, <i>Il Candelajo</i>); in 1583 he went to England where he lectured and published some of his best works, such as <i>La Cana de le Ceneri</i>, <i>De la causa</i>, <i>principio et uno</i> and <i>De linfinito universo e mondi</i>. From 1585 to 1592 Bruno wandered in Europe (Paris, Marburg, Wittenberg, Prague, Helmstadt, Zürich), publishing the <i>De immenso et innumerabilibus</i> in 1591. Finally, in 1592 he accepted an invitation to Venice. Denounced and arrested by the</p>

 <p><a name="an_2_24">24</a>. The <i>De linfinito universo e mondi</i> was written in 1584; the <i>De immenso et innumerabilibus</i>, or to quote the full title, <i>De innumerabilibus, immenso et infigurabili: sive de universo et mundis libri octo</i>, in 1591. I shall base my exposition on the <i>De linfinito universo e mondi</i> and quote it in the excellent recent translation of Mrs. Dorothea Waley Singer, adjoined to her <i>Giordano Bruno, his life and work</i>, New York, 1950. I shall give the reference first to the edition of Gentile (<i>Opere Italiane</i>, vol. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">i</span>); then to Mrs. Singer's translation.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_2_25">25</a>. Bruno's space is a void; but this void is nowhere really void; it is everywhere full of being. A vacuum with nothing filling it would mean a limitation of God's creative action and, moreover, a sin against the principle of sufficient reason which forbids God to treat any part of space in a manner different from any other.</p>

 <p><a name="an_2_33">33</a>. This very famous argument against the finitude of the universeor of spaceis a good example of the continuity of philosophical tradition and discussion. Giordano Bruno probably borrows it from Lucretius (<i>De rerum natura</i>, l. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">i</span>, v. 968 sq.), but it was already widely used in the discussions of the XIII-XIVth centuries about the plurality of the worlds and the possibility of the void (cf. my paper quoted in chap. in, 40) and will be used by Henry More (cf. <i>infra</i>, <a href="cwiu09.htm#page_139">p. 139</a>) and even by Locke</p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (cf. An essay on human understanding, l. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii</span>, §§13, 21). According to the <i>Commentaire exégétique et critique</i> of A. Ernout and L.

Fleury Mottelay in 1892 and by Sylvanus P. Thompson in 1900. The Mottelay translation was reprinted in 1941 as one of "The Classics of the St. John's Program" under the title: <i>William Gilbert of Colchester, physician of London, On the load stone and magnetic bodies and on the great magnet the Earth</i>; cf. pp. 319 sq. According to J. L. E. Dreyer, <i>A history of astronomy from Thales to Kepler</i>, 2nd ed., New York, 1953, p. 348, Gilbert, in his posthumous work, <i>De mundo nostro sublunari philosophia nova</i> (Amstelodami, 1651), "appears to hesitate between the system of Tycho and Copernicus." This is not quite exact, since Gilbert, in contradistinction to Tycho Brahe, (a) asserts the rotation of the earth which Tycho Brahe rejects, and (b) denies the existence of a sphere of fixed stars, and even the finitude of the universe still taught by Brahe. Thus Gilbert tells us that though the majority of the philosophers placed the earth in the center of the world, there is no reason to do so (l. 2, cap. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii</span>, <i>De telluris loco</i>, p. 115): "Telluris</p>  
 <p><a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 285</font></a></p>  
 <p>vero globum in centro universi manentem omnis fere philosophorum turba collocavit. At si motum aliquem habuerit praeter diurnam revolutionem (ut nonnulli existimant) erronem etiam illam oportet esse; sin in suo sede volveretur tantum, non in circulo, planetarum ritu moveretur. Non tamen inde, aut ullis aliunde depromptis rationibus, certo persuadetur eam in universae rerum naturae centro, aut circa centrum, permanere." He adds, indeed (<i>ibid</i>., p. 117), that "Non est autem quo persuaderi possit in centro universi magis terram reponi quam Lunam, quam Solem; nec ut in motivo mundo horum unum in centro sit, necesse esse," and that, moreover, the world itself has no center (p. 119).</p>  
 <p>On the other hand, though he puts the sun and not the earth in the center of the moving world (p. 120): "locus telluris non in medio quia planetae in motu circulari tellurem non observant, tanquam centrum motionum, sed Solem magis," and tells us that the sun (p. 158) "maximam vim egendi et impellendi habet, qui etiam motivi mundi centrum est," he does not tell us outright that the earth belongs to this "moving world" of the planets.</p>  
 <p>Though he quotes Copernicus and even tells us that Copernicus erred in ascribing to the earth three motions, instead of two (around its axis and around the sun), the third one, that which, according to Copernicus, turned the axis of the earth in order to keep it pointing always in the same direction being not a motion at all, but lack of it (p. 165): "Tertius motus a Copernico inductus non est motus omnino, sed telluris est directio stabilis," he does not assert the truth of the heliocentric world-view.</p>  
 <p>He tells us, indeed (l. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">i</span>, cap. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">xx</span>, <i>De vacuo separato</i>), that the Aristotelian objections against the void are worthless, that things can just as well move in the void space as remain immobile in it and that the earth can very well be a planet and turn around the sun like the others; that, nevertheless, he does not want to discuss this question (l. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">i</span>, cap. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">xx</span>, <i>De vacuo separato</i>, p. 49): "Cujus rei veritatem sic habeto. Omnia quiescunt in vacuo posita; ita quies plurimis globis mundi. At nonnulli globi et infinitis viribus et actu aliorum corporum aguntur circa quaedam corpora, ut planetae circa Solem, Luna circa Tellurem et erga Solem.</p>  
 <p>"Quod si Sol in medio quiescit ut Canis, ut Orion, ut Arcturus, turn planetae, tum etiam tellus, a Sole aguntur in orbem, consentientibus propter bonum ipsis globorum formis: si vero tellus in medio quiescat (de cujus motu annuo non est huius loci disceptare) aguntur circa ipsam cetera moventia."</p>  
 <p>It is possible, of course, that Gilbert really considered that the discussion of the annual motion of the earth was out of place in a book</p>  
 <p><a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 286</font></a></p>  
 <p>devoted to the development of a new philosophy of our sublunar world. Yet it is difficult to admit that, if he was fully convinced of the truth of the Copernican astronomy, he would so consistently avoid saying it, even when asserting its daily rotation, as, for instance in chap. VI of book II of the <i>Philosophia nova</i> (p. 135): "Terram circumvolvi diurno motu, verisimile videtur: an vero circulari aliquo motu annuo cietur, non hujus est loci inquirere." It seems, thus, that Gilbert was either not very much interested in the problem, or sceptical about the possibility to reach a solution and that he hesitated between an improved Copernicanism (such as Kepler's) and an improved Tycho Brah-ism (such as Longomontanus).</p>  <h4 align="center">CHAPTER III</h4>

Henry More, accordingly, believes in animals 'having souls and in souls' having a non-material extension; cf. also Miss Nicolson's <i>The breaking of the circle</i>, Evanston, Ill., 1950.</p>

Gassendi is not an original thinker and does not play any role in the discussion I am studying. He is a rather timorous mind and accepts, obviously for theological reasons, the finitude of the world immersed in void space; yet, by his revival of Epicurean atomism and his insistence upon the existence of the void, he undermined the very basis of the discussion, that is, the traditional ontology which still dominated the thought not only of Descartes and More but also of Newton and Leibniz.</p>

 <p><a name="an_5_28">28</a>. It is possible, of course, that, as he went to Sweden on Sept. 1, 1649 and died there on Feb. 11, 1650, Descartes did not receive this last letter of Henry More.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_5_29">29</a>. Cf. my <i>Essai sur les preuves de lexistence de Dieu chez Descartes</i>, Paris, 1923, and "Descartes after three hundred years," <i>The University of Buffalo Studies</i>, vol. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">xix</span>, 1951.</p>  <h4 align="center">CHAPTER VI</h4>  
 <p><a name="an_6_1">1</a>. Henry More has not received the monographical treatment to which he is undoubtedly entitled. On him, and on the Cambridge Platonists in general, cf. John Tulloch, <i>Rational theology and Christian philosophy in England in the XVIIIth century</i>, vol. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ii</span>, Edinburgh and London, 1874; F. J. Powicke, <i>The Cambridge Platonists</i>, London, 1926; J. H. Muirhead, <i>The Platonic tradition in Anglo-Saxon philosophy</i>, London, 1931; T. Cassirer, <i>Die Platonische Renaissance in England und die Schule von Cambridge</i>, Leipzig, 1932; English translation: <i>The Platonic Renaissance in England and the Cambridge School</i>, New Haven, 1953. Selections of the philosophical writings of Henry More (namely from <i>The antidote against atheism</i>, <i>The immortality of the soul</i>, and the <i>Enchiridium metaphysicum in translation</i>) were published in 1925 by Miss Flora J. Mackinnon with an interesting introduction, valuable notes, and an excellent bibliography: <i>Philosophical writings of Henry More</i>, New York, 1925. Cf. Marjorie Nicolson, <i>Conway letters, the correspondence of Anna, Viscountess Conway, Henry More and their friends</i>, 1642-1684, London, 1930; Markus Fierz, "Ueber den Ursprung und Bedeutung der Lehre Newtons vom absolutem Raum," <i>Gesnerus</i>, vol. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">xi</span>, fasc. 3 / 4, 1954; Max Jammer, <i>Concept of space</i>, Harvard Univ. Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1954. Both Markus Fierz and Max Jammer seem to me to exaggerate the real influence of cabalist space conceptions on Henry More (and his predecessors). In my opinion, it was a typical</p>  
 <p><a name="page_292"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 292</font></a></p>  
 <p>case of reprojection into the past of modern conceptions in order to back them up by sacred or venerable authorities; yet, as we know, misunderstanding and misinterpretation play an important part in the history of thought. It seems to me, moreover, that Fierz and Jammer themselves are not quite innocent of the sin of retroprojection, forgetting that space conceptions formed before the invention of geometry were not, and could not, be identical or even similar to the conceptions devised after this momentous event.</p>

The second edition of Cheyne's book, published under the title <i>Philosophical principles of religion, natural and revealed</i>, London, 1615, "corrected and enlarged," contains two parts: Part I, "containing the <i>Elements of Natural Philosophy</i> and the Proofs of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Natural Religion</span> arising from them," and a Part II, "containing the <i>Nature</i> and <i>Kinds of Infinities</i>, the <i>Arithmetick</i> and <i>Uses</i>, and the <i>Philosophick Principles of Reveald Religion</i>, now first published." Strangely enough the common title page, as well as that of the second part, bears the date 1715, whereas that of the first part, the date 1716. As a matter of fact, or at least according to David Gregory who held this information from Newton himself, it was the publication by Dr. Cheyne of his <i>Fluxionum methodus inversa sive quantitatum fluentium leges generales</i>, London, 1703 (rather sharply criticized by A. De Moivre in his <i>Animadversiones in Dr. G. Cheyne's Fluxionum methodus</i> . . . London, 1704), which prompted Newton to publish the <i>Two treatises on the species and magnitudes of curvilinear figures</i>, that is, <i>The quadrature of curves</i> and <i>The enumeration of the lines of the third order;</i> (cf. <i>David Gregory, Isaak Newton and their circle</i>, Extracts from David Gregory's <i>Memoranda</i>, edited by W. G. Hiscock, pp. 22 sq., Oxford, 1937). In the selfsame <i>Memoranda</i> under the date of December 21, 1705, we find also the following, very interesting passage (<i>ibid</i>., pp. 29-30): "Sir Isaak Newton was with me and told me that he had put 7 pages of Addenda to his Book of Lights and Colours in this new latin edition of it. He has by way of quaere explained the explosion of Gun powder, all the chief Operations of Chymistry. He has shewed that Light is neither a communication of motion nor of a Pressure. He inclines to believe it to be projected minute bodys. He has explained in those Quaerys the double Refraction in Iseland Crystall. His Doubt was whether he should put the last Quaere thus. <i>What the space that is empty of bodies is filled with</i>. The plain truth is that he believes God to be omnipresent in the literal sense. And that as we are sensible of Objects where their images are brought within the brain, so God must be sensible of every thing being intimately present with every thing: for he supposes that as God is present in space where there is no body, he is present in space where a body is also present. But if this way of proposing this his notion be too bold, he thinks of doing it thus. <i>What cause did the Ancients assign of</i> </p>

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> <i>Gravity</i>. He believes that they reckoned God the Cause of it, nothing else, that is no body being the cause; since every body is heavy.</p>  
 <p>"Sir Isaak believes that the Rays of Light enter into the composition of most Natural Bodies that is the small particles that are projected from a lucid body in form of Rays. As plain this may be the case with most combustible, inflammable bodies." On the relations of light and matter according to Newton cf.

As that it deserts mechanical causes, is built upon miracles and recurrs to Occult qualities. That you may not think it unnecessary to answer such Objections you may be pleased to consult a Weekly Paper called <i>Memoires of Literature</i> and sold by Ann Baldwin in Warwick-Lane. In the 18th Number of ye second Volume of those Papers which was published May 5th, 1712, you will find a very extraordinary letter of Mr. Leibnitz to Mr. Hartsoeker which will confirm what I have said." Indeed, in this letter, dated Hanover, February 10, 1711, Leibniz who, as a matter of fact already had attacked Newton in his <i>Théodicée</i> (<i>Essai de Théodicée, Discours de la Conformité de la Foi avec la Raison</i>, §19, Amsterdam, 1710) assimilated the Newtonian gravity to an "occult quality," so "occult" that it could never be cleared up even by God. It is well known that neither Leibniz nor Huygens had ever accepted the Newtonian conception of gravitation, or attraction. Cf.

 <p><a name="an_11_1">1</a>. Wilhelmine Caroline, later Queen Caroline, was born Princess of Brandenburg-Anspach and in 1705 became the wife of George Augustus, Electoral Prince of Hanover. It was as Princess of Hanover that she became intimate with Leibniz; as Leibniz put it himself, she "inherited" him from Sophie Charlotte of Prussia.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_11_2">2</a>. Cf. "An extract of a letter written in November 1715," §§3 and 4, published in <i>A Collection of papers, which passed between the late learned Mr. Leibnitz and Dr. Clarke. In the years 1715 and 1716 Relating to the Principles of Natural Philosophy and Religion. With an Appendix</i>, pp. 3 and 5, London, 1717. Leibniz writes, of course, in French, and Clarke, in English. But he accompanies the publication of the originals by a translation of Leibniz's "papers" into English (probably made by himself) and of his own "replies" into French (probably made by the Abbé Conti). Moreover, he adds to the text a series of footnotes with references to relevant passages in Newton's writings. This polemic is now available in the excellent edition of G. H. Alexander, <i>The Leibniz-Clarke correspondence</i>, Manchester Univ. Press, 1956; cf. also René Dugas, <i>La mécanique au XVII siècle</i>, cap. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">xvi</span>, §3, pp. 561 sq.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_11_3">3</a>. The choice of Dr. Samuel Clarke was rather obvious. Dr. Clarke, Rector of St. James, Westminster, was not only a philosophical theologianin 1704-5 he gave the Boyle Lecturesbut also was former chaplain of Queen Anne, removed, to say the truth, from this charge for lack of orthodoxy (he was practically an Arian). However, after Queen Anne's death he became an intimate of Princess Caroline with whom, at her request, he had weekly philosophical conversations in which other gentlemen interested in discussing philosophical problems participated. Thus it was only natural that, as Des Maizeaux tells us in the preface to his own French re-edition of the <i>Collection of papers</i> (<i>Recueil de diverses pièces sur la philosophie, la religion naturelle, lhistoire, les mathématiques etc.</i>, 2 vols., Amsterdam, 1720, p. II): "Madame la Princesse de Galles, accoutumée aux Recherches Philosophiques les plus abstraites et les plus sublimes fit voir cette Lettre à M. Clarke et souhaita quil y répondit. . . . Elle envoyait à M. Leibniz les Réponses de M. Clarke et communiquait à M. Clarke les nouvelles difficultés, ou les Instances de M. Leibniz." Indeed, Dr. Clarke as an intimate friend of Sir Isaac, and a Newtonian of long standing, could be relied upon to represent the philosophical views of his master.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 301</font></a></p>  
 <p>In my opinion we must go even farther: it is utterly unconceivable that Clarke should accept the role of philosophical spokesman (and defender) of Newton without being entrusted by the latter to do it, nay, without having secured the collaboration of the great man, at least in the form of approval.</p>  
 <p>I am, thus, morally certain that Clarke communicated to Newton <i>both</i> Leibniz's letters and his own replies to them. It is indeed unthinkable that in the midst of his bitter fight with Leibniz about the priority of the invention of the calculus, Newton who "aided" both Keill and Raphson in their attacks against Leibniz, as he "aided" Des Maiseaux some years later in the preparation of his edition of the "<i>Collection of papers</i>" (the second volume of his edition carries the history of the calculus controversy by publishing translations of selected pieces of the <i>Commercium epistolicum</i>), should remain aloof and disinterested in the face of an assault upon his religious view and an accusation, practically, of atheism, by the selfsame Leibniz. As a matter of fact, the Princess of Wales informed Leibniz (Caroline to Leibniz, Jan. 10, 1716, in O. Klopp, <i>Die Werke von Leibniz</i>, Hanover, 1864-84, vol. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">xi</span>, p. 71, quoted in <i>The Leibniz-Clarke correspondence</i>, Manchester Univ. Press, 1956, p. 193) that he was right in his supposition that these letters were not written without the advice of Newton. Strange as it may seem, the importance of Clarke's papers as representing <i>literally</i> the metaphysical views of Newton has never been recognized, with the result that their study was completely neglected by the historians both of Newton and of Leibniz. Thus, for instance, L. T. More, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 649: "It seems probable that Newton was even more exasperated by Leibniz's attack on the anti-Christian influence of the <i>Principia</i> than by the controversy over the invention of the calculus. To justify himself he guided Des Maizeaux in preparing for publication the long debate between Leibniz and Samuel Clarke on the religious significance of the Newtonian Philosophy. For this purpose he gave to the author the documents relating to the controversy, and assisted him in preparing an historical preface which reviewed the whole affair."</p>

 <p><a name="an_11_15">15</a>. "Dr. Clarke's third reply," <i>ibid</i>., p. 77. Dr. Clarke uses the term "property" in his own "replies" as well as in the translation of Leibniz's "papers"and one understands full well why he does not use the more correct one, "attribute": just because Leibniz has mentioned Spinoza. But Leibniz himself <i>uses</i> the term "attribute"; moreover the French translation of Clarke's "replies," reviewed and acknowledged by Clarke himself, uses "attribute" for "property."</p>  
 <p><a name="an_11_16">16</a>. Dr. Clarke's example is rather bad as, in this case, there would be a <i>relative</i> displacement of "our world" in respect to the fixed stars.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_11_17">17</a>. The use of the principle of inertia in the discussion of the old problem whether God can move the world in a straight line (cf. my paper quoted <i>supra</i>, cap. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">iii</span>, n. 43) is rather ingenious.</p>
