   <h3 align="center">CHAPTER VI</h3>  <h3 align="center">CHILDREN</h3>  
 <p>THE next point to be investigated is that concerning children: and, to accomplish this, observation must be made of the planets posited in, or configurated with the place on the zenith, <a name="fr_257"></a><a href="#fn_257"><font size="1">2</font></a> or its succedent house, which latter is called the place of the good dæmon. And should it happen that not any planets may be present in the said places, nor configurated with them, it will then be necessary to take into consideration such as may be in opposition thereto.</p>  
 <p>Now the Moon, Jupiter, and Venus are esteemed as givers of off-spring; but the Sun, Mars, and Saturn are considered as denying children altogether, or as allowing but few: while Mercury, being in quality common to both parties, lends co-operation to that with which he may be configurated, and gives offspring, when oriental, but with-holds, when occidental.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 129</font></a></p>  
 <p>To speak briefly, if the planets, which grant progeny, be so posited as described, <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">1</font></a> and placed singly, the gift of progeny will be single only <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">2</font></a>; but should they be in bicorporeal or in feminine signs, they will grant double offsprings <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">3</font></a>: so likewise if they should be in prolific or seminal signs, such as Pisces, Cancer, and Scorpio, they will grant twins, or even more. And provided they should also be masculinely constituted, as well by configuration with the Sun, as by being in masculine signs, they will grant male children; but otherwise, if femininely constituted, female.</p>  
 <p>But, although the said planets, even if beneath the malefics in elevation, or, even if found in barren places, or in signs such as those of Leo and Virgo, will still grant children; yet such children, thus indicated, will neither be healthy, nor continue in life. Should it happen, however, that the Sun and the malefics may be in entire possession of the places above mentioned, viz. that on the zenith, or the succedent house allotted to the good dæmon; and provided they be, at the same time, in masculine or barren signs, and the benefics be not in elevation above them, a total privation of offspring is thereby indicated; but, should they be in feminine or prolific signs, or supported by the testimony of the benefics, children will then be granted; yet they will be liable to disease, and short-lived.</p>  
 <p>If, however, planets of each condition should be configurated with, and have prerogative in prolific signs, there will then ensue a loss of either all the children, or only few, or else the major part of them; in the same proportion as that in which the planets, bearing testimony to either condition, may preponderate on one side rather than the other; by excelling in number, or in influence, in consequence of being posited more orientally, more genuinely in angles, higher in elevation, or successively ascending.</p>  
 <p>When the lords of the aforesaid signs <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">4</font></a> may be such as are givers of offspring, and be either oriental, or in places proper to themselves, the children thus granted will become eminent and illustrious: but, if occidental, or in places not proper to themselves, the children will then become undistinguished and abject. Should the said lords also be in concord with the part of fortune, and with the ascendant, they will render the children amiable, and cause them to be beloved by their parents, and to inherit their parents' substance: but, if found inconjunct, and not in concord with the said parts, the children will then become odious and mischievous to their parents, and will forfeit the inheritance of their substance.</p>

 <p>Further, should the planets which grant progeny be appropriately configurated with each other, they will promote brotherly love, and mutual regard and affection among the children; but, if in conjunct, or in opposition, they will excite in them mutual hatred, deceit, and treachery.</p>  
 <p>The general investigation regarding children is to be conducted in the foregoing method: but, in order to enquire into particular circumstances consequent on the above, it will be necessary to assume, as an ascendant, the position of each planet which gives offspring, and to observe the separate schemes; drawing inferences therefrom as in the case of a nativity.</p>
