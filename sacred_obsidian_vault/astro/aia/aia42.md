   <h3 align="center">EFFECTS OF THE ASPECTS BETWEEN THE SIGNIFICATORS.</h3>  
 <p align="center">♄ ☌ ♃</p>  
 <p>If ♄ be significator, he gives the querent inheritance of estates, and profit by means of agriculture; his disposition is extremely moral and grave; he may gain a fortune by merchandize, or, probably, by preaching.</p>  
 <p>If ♃ be significator, the disposition is not so good; the querent seldom meets with much success in the world; he is very niggardly, and generally acquires property by some selfish and unusual means; though he seldom enjoys it like other persons. He generally lives hated by every one for his mean and deceitful ways, and dies in obscurity.</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be in ☐ to the significator, and in aspect with, the querent is generally duped of his property, and dies a miserable death.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 317</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">♄ ☌ ♂</p>  
 <p>If ♄ be significator, the querent is of a rash, turbulent disposition, and generally very unfortunate; very often engaged in some public calling of the lowest order, and frequently ends his days in prison.</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be significator, the disposition is equally bad, but not quite so rash, being more sly and cowardly. Sometimes he gains favour from elderly persons, who assist him with their property, which he generally loses in the end, and becomes very unfortunate; especially if the significators be under the earth.</p>  
 <p align="center">♄ ☌ ☉</p>  
 <p>Signifies losses to the querent by fire, (especially if they be in a fiery sign), or by men in power, who persecute him, and confine him within the walls of a prison for some contempt of the law; and he is seldom healthy or of long life.</p>  
 <p>If ☉ be significator, the querent is generally very disagreeable, deceitful, mistrustful, and unfortunate; always losing his property by some speculation, which in the end often brings him to ruin; particularly if the querent have anything to do with the government, or persons connected with the state.</p>  
 <p align="center">♄ ☌ ♀</p>  
 <p>Shews gain to the querent by means of ladies, to a considerable extent; he is much attached to them, greatly addicted to pleasure, and very fortunate where females are concerned. If he be a man of property, he often wastes most of it by gaming or pleasure.</p>  
 <p>If ♀ be significator, the querent is very artful, sly, unfortunate, destitute of friends, often disappointed by death; and he loses considerably by persons older than himself, especially if he be in trade.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 318</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">♄ ☌ ☿</p>  
 <p>If ♄ be significator, the querent is subtle and crafty, fond of researches into antiquity; one of much gravity and considerable learning; though not always of the most agreeable manners.</p>  
 <p>If ☿ be significator, he is dull, suspicious, mean, cowardly, calculating, and covetous. Should he turn his attention to literature, he may gain some knowledge, although with great labour; and should he become an author, his writings may bring him into some disgrace.</p>  
 <p align="center">♄ ☌ ☽</p>  
 <p>If ♄ be significator, the person is restless and unsettled in his purposes, and often changes his residence. He is not very fortunate, though he may sometimes benefit by the populace, and by the lower order of females.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be significator, he is poor, miserable, and dejected, of unpleasant manners, and sullen disposition; extremely unfortunate, and uncommonly covetous, though possessing scarcely any property. With much suspicious caution, he frequently commits the most unaccountable errors in affairs of the greatest consequence; as, through excess of prudence, he is very likely to doubt and deliberate in the moment of action.</p>  
 <p align="center">♃ ☌ ♂</p>  
 <p>If ♃ be significator, the querent is bold, proud, and ambitious; fond of martial exploits and enterprises; a good soldier or surgeon; though he may lose much by strife and contention, and sometimes receive wounds in quarrels.</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be significator, he is good, pious, and just; he is eminently successful in the law or the church; and often makes a fortune by those means.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 319</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">♃ ☌ ☉</p>  
 <p>If ♃ be significator, the querent is weak, servile, and credulous; he incurs the displeasure of men in power, by whom he is much oppressed, and often ruined; he has bad health; and is generally a vain, loquacious character, indulging in fanciful speculations about religion, and other matters, for which he is totally unqualified.</p>  
 <p>If ☉ be significator, the power of ♃ is so much destroyed by the power of ☉, that he has but very little effect; though the party will, in general, be very much given to religion, which, if ♃ be well dignified in other respects, and not ill-aspected, will be sincere, otherwise it is fanatical or hypocritical.</p>  
 <p align="center">♃ ☌ ♀</p>  
 <p>If ♃ be significator, it promises the greatest happiness; the querent is highly favoured by the female sex, by whose means he gains great advancement; he is rich, prosperous, and fortunate; very healthy, and greatly admired and respected. It shews great personal beauty.</p>  
 <p>If ♀ be significator, it denotes great beauty of person, (unless ♀ be in ♏ or ♑), riches, honours, ecclesiastical preferment; the person so represented is truly virtuous, pious, kind and beneficent to all, with the greatest goodness of heart, and a disposition that will command universal love and esteem.</p>  
 <p align="center">♃ ☌ ☿</p>  
 <p>If ♃ be significator, it denotes a person of great learning, a good lawyer or divine, of excellent abilities and much in-formation.</p>  
 <p>If ☿ be significator, he is mild, humane, religious, fond of literature; possessing an elegant mind, and a gentle, engaging disposition; he is raised to eminence, and protected</p>  
 <p><a name="page_320"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 320</font></a></p>  
 <p>by powerful patrons; he accumulates great riches, and is, in general, extremely fortunate.</p>  
 <p align="center">♃ ☌ ☽</p>  
 <p>If ♃ be significator, the person so represented is restless and changeable, and seldom sufficiently settled to procure much wealth; he is, on the whole, very fortunate, often gains considerably by marriage, and is a general favourite with the fair sex; he is a great traveller, and is eminently successful in maritime affairs and among seamen, shipping, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be significator, he is fortunate in ecclesiastical affairs; or among mercantile men, magistrates, &amp;c. He obtains great wealth, though he is liable to losses frequently by canting, hypocritical persons, who impose upon his natural kindness and generosity of disposition. He has, however, too much good fortune to be injured by those persons to any serious extent.</p>  
 <p align="center">♂ ☌ ☉</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be significator, the querent is in danger by fire, lightning, or infectious fevers; it has been said in this case, with great truth, "he has the favour of kings and princes," and it may be their frowns too, to his utter undoing; he may rise hastily, but, perhaps, to a precipice.</p>  
 <p>If ☉ be significator, the querent is brave, but headstrong and violent; he will probably attain some considerable rank in the army or navy; but he will be frequently wounded, and most probably die in battle, or be killed by some accident, or fall a victim to some contagious fever.</p>  
 <p align="center">♂ ☌ ♀</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be significator, the querent is kind and gentle upon the whole, though at times rather hasty; he is moderately fortunate, extremely fond of women, and not always very particular as to their respectability.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 321</font></a></p>  
 <p>If ♀ be significator, he is wicked and debauched, a companion of prostitutes, from whom he generally receives great injury; a drunkard, frequently brawling in taverns or low public-houses; though he may sometimes meet with good fortune, he will quickly dissipate whatever property he may possess in the company of the most worthless of mankind.</p>  
 <p align="center">♂ ☌ ☿</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be significator, it represents the querent as possessed of considerable ability, a skilful mechanic, or a good mathematician; one of an acute sarcastic wit; if he be in the army or navy, for which he is well qualified, he obtains great reputation for his bravery, and is distinguished still more for the policy of his measures. He is never very scrupulous as to the means he employs; and will pay but little respect to the persons or possessions of others, when he can gain any advantage by sacrificing them to his own interest.</p>  
 <p>If ☿ be significator, he makes a cheat or swindler, a thief, robber, or treacherous miscreant; a frequenter of gaming-houses, rash, furious, and blood-thirsty.</p>  
 <p>N.B.--Any evil aspect of ♄ increases these evils, and a good aspect of ☉, ♃, or ♀, will much diminish them.</p>  
 <p align="center">♂ ☌ ☽</p>  
 <p>If ♂ be significator, it shews one of an unsettled life and temper, and a favourite of females; he is frequently a wandering adventurer, more remarkable for the variety of his fortune than his success or abilities. He is likely to die in a strange country.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be significator, he is a bold, enterprising character; frequently in great danger of a violent death, quarrelsome, and given to duelling, &amp;c. He. may be a good surgeon or soldier; and is seldom noted for much humanity. If a female, she is extremely likely to be seduced.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 322</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">☉ ☌ ♀</p>  
 <p>If ☉ be significator, it denotes one of soft and effeminate manners, a pleasing address, a great admirer of the ladies. He is too much given to extravagance and dissipation.</p>  
 <p>If ♀ be significator, he is of short life, unfortunate, and oppressed; too sickly to make much exertion; very proud and extravagant.</p>  
 <p align="center">☉ ☌ ☿</p>  
 <p>If ☉ be significator, it gives some ingenuity, but not much sound judgment.</p>  
 <p>If ☿ be significator, he represents a person of mean and shallow abilities; one addicted to fraud and deception; incapable of learning anything which requires memory or judgment, and extremely superstitious. He may succeed well in trade or business, but for study he is wholly unqualified.</p>  
 <p align="center">☉ ☌ ☽</p>  
 <p>If ☉ be significator, it represents a restless and change-able person, who aims at great things, but seldom accomplishes them.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be significator, the querent is extremely unfortunate, and generally sickly and unhappy, dejected, and oppressed by men in power. He is rash and violent, subject to burns and scalds, and has frequently some defect in the eyes; and if the ☌ happen near the <i>Hyades</i>, <i>Pleiades</i>, or <i>Præspe</i>, he is likely to be nearly blind. If the ☽ be applying, he is in danger of death, especially if it happen in the 8th house, or ☉ be lord of the 8th; but if ☽ be separating, the danger is not so great.</p>  
 <p align="center">♀ ☌ ☿</p>  
 <p>If ♀ be significator, it represents one who is polite, mild, and courteous, fond of the elegant branches of literature; a</p>  
 <p><a name="page_323"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 323</font></a></p>  
 <p>pleasant companion, a favourite of females; and one of an excellent disposition.</p>  
 <p>If ☿ be significator, he excels in any pursuit that requires taste; a good painter, an excellent poet or musician, of a very humane disposition, and of the most prepossessing appearance.</p>  
 <p>N.B. It must be most carefully observed, whether these planets have any other familiarity at the same time; for should ♅, ♄, or ♂ be in ☐, it will make a most remarkable difference. Indeed, this must be scrupulously attended to in all cases, but especially, where ♀, ☿, or ☽ may be significator.</p>  
 <p align="center">♀ ☌ ☽</p>  
 <p>If ♀ be significator, it renders a man very mutable and uncertain; often promising, through goodness of disposition, much more than he is capable of performing.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be significator, he is of an easy, happy, disposition, with little care beyond the enjoyment of the present moment; a great proficient in all elegant amusements, and of an easy and genteel address.</p>  
 <p align="center">☿ ☌ ☽</p>  
 <p>If ☿ be significator, the native is possessed of great abilities, though generally very unsteady in his pursuits. He frequently travels in some literary capacity.</p>  
 <p>If ☽ be significator, the effects are not very different; his intellectual powers are of the first order; he is much attached to learning, and gains great reputation by his abilities.</p>
