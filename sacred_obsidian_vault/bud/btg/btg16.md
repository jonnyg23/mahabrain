 <h1 align="CENTER">FOUNDING THE KINGDOM</h1>
 <h3 align="CENTER">UPAKA SEES THE BUDDHA</h3>
 <p>Now the Blessed One thought: "To whom shall I preach the doctrine first? My old teachers are dead. They would have received the good news with joy. But my five disciples are still alive. I shall go to them, and to them shall I first proclaim the gospel of deliverance."</p>
 <p>At that time the five bhikkhus dwelt in the Deer Park at Benares, and the Blessed One rose and journeyed to their abode, not thinking of their unkindness in having left him at a time when he was most in need of their sympathy and help, but mindful only of the services which they had ministered unto him, and pitying them for the austerities which they practiced in vain.</p>

 <p>The holy Buddha replied: "I have obtained deliverance by the extinction of self. My body is chastened, my mind is free from desire, and the deepest truth has taken abode in my heart. I have obtained Nirvana, and this is the reason that my countenance is serene and my eyes are bright. I now desire to found the kingdom of truth upon earth, to give light to those who are enshrouded in darkness and to open the gate of deathlessness."</p>
 <p>Upaka replied: "Thou professest then, friend, to be Jina, the conqueror of the world, the absolute one and the holy one.</p>
 <p>The Blessed One said: "Jinas are all those who have conquered self and the passions of self; those alone are victorious who control their minds and abstain from evil. Therefore, Upaka, I am the Jina."</p>
 <p>Upaka shook his head. "Venerable Gotama, he said, "thy way lies yonder," and taking another road he went away.</p>
