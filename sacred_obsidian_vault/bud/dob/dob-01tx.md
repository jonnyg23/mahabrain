 <p>   I. 1. Thus have I heard. The Blessed One was once going along the high road between Râ<i>g</i>agaha and Nâlandâ{2} with a great company of the brethren, with about five hundred brethren. And Suppiya the mendicant{3} too was going along the high road between Râ<i>g</i>agaha and Nâlandâ with his disciple the youth Brahmadatta. Now just then Suppiya the mendicant was speaking in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, in dispraise of the Doctrine, in dispraise of the Order. But young Brahmadatta, his pupil, gave utterance, in many ways, to praise of the Buddha, to praise of the Doctrine, to praise of the Order. Thus they two, teacher and pupil, holding opinions in direct contradiction one to the other, were following, step by</p>
 
 <p><small>{1. The whole of this Sutta was translated into English by the Rev. Daniel Gogerly, Wesleyan missionary in Ceylon, in the Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1846 (reprinted by P. Grimblot in his 'Sept Suttas Pâlis,' Paris, 1876).</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Nâlandâ, afterwards the seat of the famous Buddhist university, was about seven miles north of Râ<i>g</i>agaha, the capital of Magadha, the modern Ra<i>g</i>-gir (Sum. p. 35).</p>
 
 <p>3. Suppiya was a follower of the celebrated teacher Sa<i>ñg</i>aya, whose views are set out and controverted in the next Sutta.}</p>

 <p>step, after the Blessed One and the company of the brethren.</p>
 
 <p>   2. Now the Blessed One put up at the royal rest-house in the Ambala<i>tth</i>ikâ pleasance{l} to pass the night, and with him the company of the brethren. And so also did Suppiya the mendicant, and with him his young disciple Brahmadatta. And there, at the rest-house, these two carried on the same discussion as before.</p>
 
 <p>   <a name="text%20p.%202">[2]</a> 3. And in the early dawn a number of the brethren assembled, as they rose up, in the pavilion; and this was the trend of the talk that sprang up among them, as they were seated there. 'How wonderful a thing is it, brethren, and how strange that the Blessed One, he who knows and sees, the Arahat, the Buddha Supreme, should so clearly have perceived how various are the inclinations of men! For see how while Suppiya the mendicant speaks in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Doctrine, and the Order, his own disciple young Brahmadatta, speaks, in as many ways, in praise of them. So do these two, teacher and pupil, follow step by step after the Blessed One and the company of the brethren, giving utterance to views in direct contradiction one to the other.'</p>
 
 <p>   4. Now the Blessed One, on realising what was the drift of their talk, went to the pavilion, and took his seat on the mat spread out for him. And when he had sat down he said: 'What is the talk on which you are engaged sitting here, and what is the subject of the conversation between you?' And they told him all. And he said:</p>
 
 <p><small>{1. Ambala<i>tth</i>ikâ, 'the mango sapling.' It was, says Buddhaghosa (pp. 41, 42), a well-watered and shady park so called from a mango sapling by the gateway. It was surrounded with a rampart, and had in it a rest-house adorned with paintings for the king's amusement.</small></p>
 
 <p>There was another garden so named at Anârddhapura in Ceylon, to the east of the Brazen Palace (Sum. I, 131). This was so named, no doubt, after the other which was famous as the scene of the 'Exhortation to Râhula starting with falsehood,' mentioned in Asoka's Bhabra Edict (see my 'Buddhism,' pp. 224, 225).}</p>

 <p>   5. 'Brethren, if outsiders should speak against me, or against the Doctrine, <a name="text%20p.%203">[3]</a> or against the Order, you should not on that account either bear malice, or suffer heart-burning, or feel illwill. If you, on that account, should be angry and hurt, that would stand in the way of your own self-conquest. If, when others speak against us, you feel angry at that, and displeased, would you then be able to judge how far that speech of theirs is well said or ill?'</p>
 
 <p>   'That would not be so, Sir.'</p>
 
 <p>   'But when outsiders speak in dispraise of me, or of the Doctrine, or of the Order, you should unravel what is false and point it out as wrong, saying: "For this or that reason this is not the fact, that is not so, such a thing is not found among us, is not in us."</p>
 
 <p>   6. 'But also, brethren, if outsiders should speak in praise of me, in praise of the Doctrine, in praise of the Order, you should not, on that account, be filled with pleasure or gladness, or be lifted up in heart. Were you to be so that also would stand in the way of your self-conquest. When outsiders speak in praise of me, or of the Doctrine, or of the Order, you should acknowledge what is right to be the fact, saying: "For this or that reason this is the fact, that is so, such a thing is found among us, is in us."</p>
 
 <p>   7. 'It is in respect only of trifling things, of matters of little value, of mere morality, that an unconverted man, when praising the Tathâgata, would speak. And what are such trifling, minor details of mere morality that he would praise?'</p>

 <p><small>{1. These titles occur, in the MSS., at the end of the sections of the tract that now follows. It forms a part of each of the Suttas in the first division, the first third, of this collection of Suttas. The division is called therefore the Sîla Vagga or Section containing the Sîlas. The tract itself must almost certainly have existed as a separate work before the time when the discourses, in each of which it recurs, were first put together.</small></p>
 
 <p>Certain paragraphs from this tract occur also elsewhere. So in Ma<i>ggh</i>ima I, 179 we have the whole of the short paragraphs; in Ma<i>ggh</i>ima, Nos. 76 and 77, and in Mahâvagga V, 8, 3, we have § 17; in Ma<i>ggh</i>ima II, 3 we have most of § 18; and so on. The whole of this tract has been translated into English by Gogerly (in Grimblot, see page 1, note), into French by Burnouf (also in Grimblot, pp. 212 foll.), and into German by Dr. Neumann (in his Buddhistische Anthologie, pp. 67 foll.).}</p>

 <p>of life. He has laid the cudgel and the sword aside, and ashamed of roughness, and full of mercy, he dwells compassionate and kind to all creatures that have life." It is thus that the unconverted man, when speaking in praise of the Tathâgata, might speak{1}.</p>
 
 <p>   'Or he might say: "Putting away the taking of what has not been given, Gotama the recluse lived aloof from grasping what is not his own. He takes only what is given, and expecting that gifts will come{2}, he passes his life in honesty and purity of heart."</p>

 <p><small>{1. This refrain is repeated at the end of each clause. When the Sîlas recur below, in each Sutta, the only difference is in the refrain. See, for instance, the translation of <a href="dob-03tx.htm#text%20p.%20100">p. 100</a> in the text.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Neumann has 'waiting for a gift' which is a possible rendering: but pâtikankhati has not yet been found elsewhere in the sense of 'waiting for.' The usual meaning of the word expresses just such a trifling matter as we have been led, from the context, to expect.</p>
 
 <p>3. Gâma-dhammâ, 'from the village habit, the practice of country folk, the "pagan" way.' One might render the phrase by 'pagan' if that word had not acquired, in English, a slightly different connotalion. It is the opposite of porî, urbane (applied to speech, below, § 9). Dr. Neumann misses the point here, but has 'höflich' below.}</p>

Thus does he live as a binder together of those who are divided, an encourager of those who are friends, a peacemaker, a lover of peace, impassioned for peace, a speaker of words that make for peace."</p>
 
 <p>   'Or he might say: "Putting away rudeness of speech, Gotama the recluse holds himself aloof from harsh language. Whatsoever word is blameless, pleasant to the ear, lovely, reaching to the heart, urbane{1}, pleasing to the people, beloved of the people--such are words he speaks."</p>

 <p><small>{1. Ka<i>m</i>sa-kû<i>t</i>a. The context suggests that ka<i>m</i>sa (bronze) may here refer to coins, just as we say in English 'a copper,' and the word is actually so used in the 11th and 12th Bhikkhunî Nissaggiya Rules--the oldest reference in Indian books to coins. The most ancient coins, which were of private (not state) coinage, were either of bronze or gold. Buddhaghosa (p. 79) explains the expression here used as meaning the passing off of bronze vessels as gold. Gogerly translates 'weights,' Childers <i>sub voce</i> has 'counterfeit metal,' and Neumann has 'Maass.' Buddhaghosa is obliged to take ka<i>m</i>sa in the meaning of 'gold pot,' which seems very forced; and there is no authority for ka<i>m</i>sa meaning either weight or mass. On the whole the coin explanation seems to me to be the simplest.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Buddhaghosa gives examples of each of these five classes of the vegetable kingdom without explaining the terms. But it is only the fourth which is doubtful. It may mean 'graftings,' if the art of grafting was then known in the Ganges valley.}</p>

 <p>   12. <a name="text%20p.%206">[6]</a> 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to the use of things stored up; stores, to wit, of foods, drinks, clothing, equipages, bedding, perfumes, and curry-stuffs{1}--Gotama the recluse holds aloof from such use of things stored up."</p>
 
 <p>   13. 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to visiting shows{2}; that is to say,</p>
 
    (1) Nautch dances (na<i>kk</i>a<i>m</i>){3}.<br>

    (3) Instrumental music (vâdita<i>m</i>).<br>
 
    (4) Shows at fairs (pekkha<i>m</i>){4}.<br>
 
 <p><small>{1. Âmisa. Buddhaghosa (p. 83) gives a long list of curry-stuffs included under this term. If he is right then Gogerly's 'raw grain' is too limited a translation, and Neumann's 'all sorts of articles to use' too extensive. In its secondary meaning the word means 'something nice, a relish, a dainty.'</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Visûka-dassana<i>m</i>. This word has only been found elsewhere in the phrase di<i>tth</i>i-visûka<i>m</i>, 'the puppet shows of heresy' (Ma<i>ggh</i>ima I, pp. 8, 486; and Serissaka Vimâna LXXXIV, 26). The Sinhalese renders it wiparîta-dar<i>s</i>a<i>n</i>a.</p>
 
 <p>3. Dancing. cannot mean here a dancing in which the persons referred to took part. It must be ballet or nautch dancing.</p>
 
 <p>4. Literally 'shows.' This word; only found here, has always been rendered 'theatrical representations.' Clough first translated it so in his Sinhalese Dictionary, p. 665, and he was followed by Gogerly, Burnouf, myself (in 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 192), and Dr. Neumann (p. 69),--and Weber (Indian Literature, pp. 199, 319) seems to approve this. But it is most unlikely that the theatre was already known in the fifth century B.C. And Buddhaghosa (p. 84) explains it, quite simply, as na<i>t</i>a-sama<i>gg</i>â. Now sama<i>gg</i>o is a very interesting old word (at least in its Pâli form). The Sanskrit sama<i>g</i>yâ, according to the Petersburg Dictionary, has only been found in modern dictionaries. The Pâli occurs in other old texts such as Vinaya II, 107; IV, 267 (both times in the very same context as it does here); ibid. II, 150; IV, 85; Sigâlovada Sutta, p. 300; and it is undoubtedly the same word as samâ<i>g</i>a in the first of the fourteen Edicts of Asoka. In the Sigâlovada there are said to be six dangers at such a sama<i>gg</i>o; to wit, dancing, singing, music, recitations, conjuring tricks, and acrobatic shows. And in the Vinaya passages we learn that at a sama<i>gg</i>o not only amusements but also food was provided; that high officials were invited, and had special seats; and that it took place at the top of a hill. This last detail of 'high places' (that is sacred places) points to a religious motive as underlying the whole procedure. The root a<i>g</i> ({Greek <i>ágo</i>}, <i>ago</i>, whence our 'act') belongs to the stock of common Aryan roots, and means carrying on. What was the meaning of this 'carrying on together'? Who were the people who took part? Were they confined to one village? or have we here a survival from old exogamic communistic dancings together? Later the word means simply 'fair,' as at <i>G</i>âtaka III, 541:</p>
 
 <p>'Many the bout I have played with quarterstaves at the fair,' with which <i>G</i>âtaka I, 394 may be compared. And it is no doubt this side of the festival which is here in the mind of the author; but 'fair' is nevertheless a very inadequate rendering. The Sinhalese has 'rapid movement in dance-figures' (ranga-ma<i>nd</i>alu).}</p>

    (5) Ballad recitations (akkhâna<i>m</i>){1}.<br>
 
    (6) Hand music (pâ<i>n</i>issara<i>m</i>){2}.<br>
 
    (7) The chanting of bards (vetâla<i>m</i>){3}.<br>
 
    (8) Tam-tam playing (kumbhathûna<i>m</i>){4}.<br>
 
 <p><small>{1. These ballad recitations in prose and verse combined were the source from which epic poetry was afterwards gradually developed. Buddhaghosa has no explanation of the word, but gives as examples the Bhârata and the Râmâya<i>n</i>a. The negative anakkhâna<i>m</i> occurs Ma<i>ggh</i>ima I, 503.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Buddhaghosa explains this as 'playing on cymbals'; and adds that it is also called pâ<i>n</i>itâla<i>m</i>. The word is only found here and at <i>G</i>âtaka V, 506, and means literally 'hand-sounds.'</p>
 
 <p>3. Buddhaghosa says 'deep music, but some say raising dead bodies to life by spells.' His own explanation is, I think, meant to be etymological; and to show that he derives the word from vi+tâ<i>l</i>a. This would bring the word into connection with the Sanskrit vaitâlika, 'royal bard.' The other explanation connects the word with vetâla, 'a demon,' supposed to play pranks (as in the stories of the Vetâla-pa<i>ñk</i>a-vi<i>m</i>sati) by reanimating corpses. Dr. Neumann adopts it. But it does not agree so well with the context; and it seems scarcely justifiable to see, in this ancient list, a reference to beliefs which can only be traced in literature more than a thousand years later. Gogerly's rendering 'funeral ceremonies,' which I previously followed, seems to me now quite out of the question.</p>
 
 <p>4. It is clear from <i>G</i>âtaka V, 506 that this word means a sort of music. And at Vinaya IV, 285 kumbhathûnikâ are mentioned in connection with dancers, acrobats, and hired mourners. Buddhaghosa is here obscure and probably corrupt, and the derivation is quite uncertain. Gogerly's guess seems better than Burnouf's or Neumann's. The Sinhalese has 'striking a drum big enough to hold sixteen gallons.'}</p>

 <p>   Gotama the recluse holds aloof from visiting such shows."</p>
 
 <p>   14. 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to games and recreations{6}; that is to say,</p>
 
    (1) Games on boards with eight, or with ten, rows of squares{7}.<br>
 
    (2) The same games<br>
 
 <p><small>{1. Buddhaghosa seems to understand by this term (literally 'of Sobha city ) the adornments or scenery used for a ballet-dance. (Pa<i>t</i>ibhâ<i>n</i>a-kitta<i>m</i> at Vinaya II, 151; IV, 61, 298, 358; Sum. I, 42 is the nude in art.) Weber has pointed out (Indische Studien, II, 38; III, 153) that Sobha is a city of the Gandharvas, fairies much given to music and love-making. It is quite likely that the name of a frequently used scene for a ballet became a proverbial phrase for all such scenery. But the Sinhalese has 'pouring water over the heads of dancers, or nude paintings.'</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Buddhaghosa takes these three words separately, and so do all the MSS. of the text, and the Sinhalese version. But I now think that the passage at <i>G</i>âtaka IV, 390 is really decisive, and that we have here one of the rare cases where we can correct our MSS. against the authority of the old commentator. But I follow him in the general meaning he assigns to the strange expression '<i>K</i>a<i>nd</i>âla-bamboo-washings.'</p>
 
 <p>3. See <i>G</i>âtaka III, 541.</p>
 
 <p>4. Nibbuddha<i>m</i>. The verbal form nibbu<i>ggh</i>ati occurs in the list at Vinaya III, 180 (repeated at II, 10); and our word at Milinda 232.</p>
 
 <p>5. All these recur in the introductory story to the 50th Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya (Vinaya IV, 107). On the last compare Buddhaghosa on Mahâvagga V, 1, 29.</p>
 
 <p>6. All these terms recur at Vinaya III, 180 (repeated at II, 10).</p>
 
 <p>7. Chess played originally on a board of eight times ten squares was afterwards played on one of eight times eight squares. Our text cannot be taken as evidence of real chess in the fifth century B. C., but it certainly refers to games from which it and draughts must have been developed. The Sinhalese Sanna says that each of these games was played with dice and pieces such as kings and so on. The worJ for pieces is poru (from purisa)--just our 'men.'}</p>

 <p><small>{1. Âkâsa<i>m</i>. How very like blindfold chess!</small></p>

 <p>3. Santikâ. Spellicans, pure and simple.</p>
 
 <p>4. Khalikâ. Unfortunately the method of playing is not stated. Compare Eggeling's note as in his <i>S</i>atapatha-Brâhma<i>n</i>a III, 106, 7. In the gambling-scene on the Bharhut Tope (Cunningham, Pl. XLV, No. 9) there is a board marked out on the stone of six times five squares (not six by six), and six little cubes with marks on the sides visible lie on the stone outside the board.</p>
 
 <p>5. Gha<i>t</i>ikam. Something like 'tip-cat.' Si<i>m</i>-kelîmaya in Sinhalese.</p>
 
 <p>6. Salâka-hattha<i>m</i>. On flour-water as colouring matter, see <i>G</i>âtaka I, 220.</p>
 
 <p>7. Akkha<i>m</i>. The usual meaning is 'a die.' But the Sinhalese translator agrees with Buddhaghosa. Neither gives any details.</p>
 
 <p>8. Panga<i>k</i>îra<i>m</i>. The Sinhalese for this toy is 'pat-kulal. Morris in J. P. T. S., 1889, p. 205, compares the Marathî pungî.</p>

    (2) Divans with animal figures carved on the supports (Pallanko){5}.<br>
 
 <p><small>{1. All these six, from No. 10 inclusive, are mentioned in the Ma<i>ggh</i>ima, vol. i, p. 266, as children's games.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Akkharikâ. It is important evidence for the date at which writing was known in India that such a game should be known in the fifth century B.C.</p>
 
 <p>3. The following list recurs Vinaya I, 192 = II, 163 = A<u>n</u>guttara I, 181, &amp;c.</p>
 
 <p>4. Âsandî. Buddhaghosa merely says 'a seat beyond the allowed measure,' but that must refer to height, as the only rule as to measure in seats is the 87th Pâ<i>k</i>ittiya in which the height of beds or chairs is limited to eight 'great' inches (probably about eighteen inches). The Sinhalese Sanna adds 'a long chair for supporting the whole body.' At <i>G</i>ât. I, 208 a man lies down on an âsandî so as to be able to look up and watch the stars. At Dîgha I, 55 = Ma<i>ggh</i>ima I, 515 = Sa<i>m</i>yutta III, 307 (where the reading must be corrected), the âsandî is used as a bier. The âsandî is selected as the right sort of seat for the king in both the Vâ<i>g</i>apeya and Inauguration ceremonies because of its height (Eggeling, <i>S</i>at.-Brâh. III, 35, 105). It is there said to be made of common sorts of wood, and perforated; which probably means that the frame was of wood and the seat was of interlaced cane or wickerwork. The diminutive âsandiko, with short legs and made square (for sitting, not lying on), is allowed in the Buddhist Order by Vinaya II, 149. And even the âsandî is allowed, if the tall legs be cut down, by Vinaya II, 169, 170 (where the reading <i>kh</i>inditvâ seems preferable, and is read in the quotation at Sum. I, 88). The renderings 'large cushion' at 'Vinaya Texts,' II, 27 and 'stuffed couch' at III, 209 must be accordingly corrected. Gogerly translates 'large couch,' Burnouf 'une chaise longue,' and Neumann 'bequeme Lehnstuhl.'</p>
 
 <p>5. Pallanko. It is noteworthy that, in spite of the use of a divan with animals carved on its supports being here objected to, it is precisely the sort of seat on which the Buddha himself, or Buddhist personages of distinction, are often, in later sculptures, represented as sitting (Grünwedel, 'Buddhistische kunst,' pp. 111, 124, 137; Mitra, 'Budh Gayâ,' Plates XI, XX, &amp;c. &amp;c.). At Mahâva<i>m</i>sa 25 sîhâsana and pallanko are used of the same seat (Asoka's throne), and sîhâsana is used of Du<i>tth</i>a Garnini's throne, ibid. 157. But the Lion throne of Nissanka Malla, found at Pollonnaruwa, is not a pallanko, but an actual stone lion, larger than life size ('Indian Antiquary,' vol. i, p. 135. Compare the similar seat in Grünwedel, p. 95).</p>
 
 <p>By Vinaya II, 170 the possession of a pallanka was allowed to the Order if the animal figures were broken off (the translation in 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 209, must be altered accordingly, reading vâ<i>l</i>e for vale, as at Vinaya IV, 312). By Vinaya II, 163 it is laid down that members of the Order were not to use a complete pallanko even in laymen's houses, so that Nigrodha's action in the passage just quoted (Mahâvamsa 25) was really a breach of the regulations.}</p>

 <p><small>{1. The words from gonako down to ka<i>tth</i>issa<i>m</i> inclusive, and also kuttaka<i>m</i>, are found only in this list, and Buddhaghosa seems to be uncertain as to the exact meaning of some of them. All except No. 7 might be used in laymen's houses ('Vinaya Texts: III, 197), and all might be possessed by the Order if used only as floor-coverings (ibid. III, 209); except again No. 7, the cotton wool of which might be utilised for pillows. As there is a doubt about the spelling it may be noticed that the Sanna reads go<i>n</i>aka<i>m</i> and uddalomi<i>m</i>: and the MS. in the R. A. S.

'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to the use of means for adorning and beautifying themselves; that is to say,--Rubbing in scented powders on one's body, shampooing it, and bathing it. Patting the limbs with clubs after the manner of wrestlers{1}. The use of mirrors, eye-ointments, garlands, rouge, cosmetics, bracelets, necklaces, walking-sticks, reed cases for drugs, rapiers, sunshades, embroidered slippers, turbans, diadems, whisks of the yak's tail, and long-fringed white robes--</p>

 <p>   17. 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to such low conversation as these:</p>
 
 <p>   Tales of kings, of robbers, of ministers of state; tales of war, of terrors, of battles; talk about foods and drinks, clothes, beds, garlands, perfumes; talks about relationships, equipages, villages, town, cities, and countries; tales about women <a name="text%20p.%208">[8]</a>, and about heroes; gossip at street corners{3}, or places whence</p>
 
 <p><small>{1. Sambâhana<i>m</i>. Perhaps rubbing the limbs with flat pieces of wood. See Buddhaghosa here and at 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 60.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. This is not quite accurate. Out of the twenty items here objected to, three (shampooing, bathing, and the use of sunshades) were allowed in the Order, and practised by Gotama himself. Bathrooms, and halls attached to them, are permitted by 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 189; shampooing by ibid. III, 68, 297. There are elaborate regulations for the provision of hot steam baths and the etiquette to be observed in them; and instances of the use of the ordinary bath in streams or rivers are frequent. The use of sunshades is permitted by 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 132-3, and is referred to ibid. III, 88, 274.</p>
 
 <p>3. Visikhâ-kathâ. Buddhaghosa (p. 90) takes this word (literally 'street-talk') in the sense of talk about streets, whether ill or well situate, and whether the inhabitants are bold or poor, &amp;c.}</p>

 <p>   18. 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to the use of wrangling phrases{5}: such as--</p>
 
 <p>   "You don't understand this doctrine and discipline, I do."</p>
 
 <p>   "How should you know about this doctrine and discipline?"</p>
 
 <p>   "You have fallen into wrong views. It is I who am in the right."</p>
 
 <p>   "I am speaking to the point, you are not{6}."</p>

 <p><small>{1. Pubba-peta-kathâ. The commentator confines this to boasting talk about deceased relatives or ancestors.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Nânatta-katha<i>m</i>, literally 'difference-talk.' The expression seems somewhat forced, if taken as meaning 'desultory'; but I see no better explanation.</p>
 
 <p>3. Lokakkhâyikâ. Buddhaghosa refers this specially to such speculations as are put forth according to the Lokakkhâyikâ system by the Vita<i>nd</i>as (also called Lokâyatikas). These are materialistic theorisers, of whose system very little is, so far, known. See the note at 'Vinaya Texts,' vol. iii, p. 151. I have collected other references to them in my 'Milinda,' vol. i, p. 7; and to these Digha I, 11, 114, 120, and Attha Sâlinî, p. 3, may now be added. They are probably referred to below in chap. iii of this Sutta, §§ 10, 20.</p>
 
 <p>4. This list of foolish talks recurs in Suttas 76-78 in the Ma<i>ggh</i>ima, and at Vinaya I, 188.</p>
 
 <p>5. These expressions all recur at Ma<i>ggh</i>ima II, 3.</p>
 
 <p>6. Sahita<i>m</i> me, literally 'the put together is to me,' &amp;c. The idiom is only found here, and may mean either as rendered above, or 'the context is on my side,' or 'the text (of the Scriptures) is on my side,' or merely 'that which is of use is on my side.' This last, given by the Sanna, amounts to the same as the version adopted above.</p>

 <p>   "Disentangle yourself if you can.{4}"--</p>
 
 <p>   Gotama the recluse holds aloof from such wrangling phrases."</p>
 
 <p>   19. 'Or he might say: "Whereas some recluses and Brahmans, while living on food provided by the faithful, continue addicted to taking messages, going on errands, and acting as go-betweens; to wit, on kings, ministers of state, Kshatriyas, Brahmans, or young men, saying: 'Go there, come hither, take this with you, bring that from thence'--</p>
 
 <p>   Gotama the recluse abstains from such servile duties."</p>

 <p><small>{1. Âropito te vâdo. On the use of this idiom compare the Commentary on the Theri Gâthâ, p. 101. There is a misprint here in the text, aropito for âropito. 'Issue has been joined against you' would be a possible rendering. It is the phrase used, when some one has offered to hold debate (maintain a thesis) against all comers, by an opponent who takes up the challenge.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Niggahîto si. On this idiom compare the opening paragraphs of the Kathâ Vatthu and the Commentary on them (especially pp. 9, 10). It is literally 'you are censured.'</p>
 
 <p>3. <i>K</i>ara vâda-pamokkhâya. So Buddhaghosa. But Gogerly renders, 'Depart, that you may be freed from this disputation;' and the only parallel passage seems to support this view. It is Ma<i>ggh</i>ima I, 133, where it is said to be wrong to learn the Scriptures for the sake of the advantage of being freed from discussion or debate where texts are quoted against one. Pamokkha occurs besides at Samyutta I, 2, <i>G</i>âtaka V, 30, 31, and Mahâva<i>m</i>sa 158, but not in this connection.</p>
 
 <p>4. So the author of Milinda in making his hero Nâgasena use just such a phrase (Mil. p. 27) is making him commit a breach of propriety.</p>
 
 <p>5. Kuhakâ. 'Astonish the world with the three sorts of trickery,' says Buddhaghosa. These are also referred to without explanation at <i>G</i>âtaka IV, 297 (where we should, I think, read kuhana).</p>

    (1) palmistry-prophesying long life, prosperity, &amp;c. (or the reverse), from marks on a child's hands, feet, &amp;c.{4}<br>
 
    (2) Divining by means of omens and signs{5}.<br>
 
    (3) Auguries drawn from thunderbolts and other celestial portents{6}.<br>
 
 <p><small>{1. Nemittakâ, 'interpreters of signs and omens.' See the note on nimitta<i>m</i> in the next paragraph. Compare Milinda 299; Gât. IV, 124.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Nippesikâ, 'scarers away' (? of ghosts, or bad omens). But the Commentary and Sanna give no help, and the word has only been found in this list.</p>
 
 <p>3. All the five words in this list recur at A. III, 111, but the context there is as undecisive as it is here, and the Commentary (fol. <i>di</i> of the Tumour MS. at the India Office), though slightly different, gives no better help.</p>
 
 <p>4. A<u>n</u>ga<i>m</i>, literally 'limbs.' Buddhaghosa distinguishes this from lakkha<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> (No. 5 in this list), and from anga-vi<i>gg</i>â (No. 16). It is not found, in this sense, anywhere in the texts.</p>
 
 <p>5. Nimitta<i>m</i>, literally 'marks,' or 'signs.' Buddhaghosa tells a story in illustration. King Pa<i>nd</i>u, they say (Pâ<i>nd</i>i in the Sanna), took three pearls in his closed hand, and asked a diviner what he had in it. The latter looked this way and that for a sign; and seeing a fly which had been caught by a house-lizard (the Sanna says 'by a dog,' perhaps the meaning is simply 'in sugar') getting free (muttâ), said at once 'pearls' (also muttâ in Pâli). 'How many?' says the king. The diviner, hearing a dog bark thrice, answered 'three.' Compare Mil. 178, and the note to the last section on nemittikâ and the story at Mahâva<i>m</i>sa 82.</p>
 
 <p>6. Uppâdo, 'the portents of the great ones, thunderbolts falling, and so on,' says Buddhaghosa. The Great Ones here mean, I think, the spirits or gods presiding over the sun, moon, and planets (see the note on § 26). The word corresponds to the Sanskrit Utpâta, though the d is vouched for by overwhelming authority. But this is only another instance of a change not infrequent (as Ed. Müller has shown, Pâli Grammar, p. 37); and the one or two cases where Burmese scribes have (wrongly) corrected to uppâta is another instance to be added to those referred to in the Introduction to Sum. I of their habit of putting an easier reading where the more difficult one is really right. Childers should therefore have kept this word separate from the other uppâdo. Comp. <i>G</i>ât. I, 374.}</p>

    (14) Sacrificing by spewing mustard seeds, &amp;c., into the fire out of one's mouth{7}.<br>
 
    (15) Drawing blood from one's right knee as a sacrifice to the gods{8}.<br>
 
 <p><small>{1. Supina<i>m</i>. On the theory of dreams compare Mil., pp. 297-301. At <i>G</i>ât. I, 374 the word is masculine. Perhaps charms to avert bad dreams (Ath.-veda VI, 46; XVI, 5 and 6) are included in this 'low art.' <i>G</i>ât. No. 77 mocks at the dream interpreters.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Lakkha<i>n</i>a<i>m</i>. The commentator on this word as used in the very same connection at <i>G</i>ât. I, 374 adds that it means also the knowledge of good and bad marks on such persons and things as are mentioned here in our next paragraph. Buddhaghosa confines its meaning to that given above. This contradiction is another confirmation of the opinion expressed by me in 1880 in 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. lxiii foll., that Childers was wrong in ascribing the <i>G</i>âtaka Commentary to Buddhaghosa. The word occurs in Buddhaghosa's sense at D. I, 114, 120 = A. I, 163, &amp;c.; <i>G</i>ât. I, 56.</p>
 
 <p>3. Musikâ<i>kkh</i>inna<i>m</i>. The allied superstition of thinking it unlucky to wear clothes gnawed by mice is laughed out of court in the Mangala Gâtaka, No. 87.</p>
 
 <p>4. Aggi-homa<i>m</i>. Telling people that a sacrifice, if offered in a fire of such and such a wood, will have such and such a result.</p>
 
 <p>5. Dabbi-homa<i>m</i>. Telling people that an oblation of such and such grains, butter, or so on, poured into the fire from such and such a sort of spoon, will have such and such a result.</p>
 
 <p>6. See Hillebrandt, 'Neu und Vollmondsopfer,' pp. 31, 171, and 'Ritual-literatur' in Bühler's 'Grundriss,' pp. 71, 72, 114, 176. The nine homas here objected to may also be compared with the seven at Ath.-veda VIII, 9, 18.</p>
 
 <p>7. No instance of this can be traced in the books of the Brahmans.</p>
 
 <p>8. Compare the passage in Hillebrandt, in Bühler's 'Grundriss,' p. 176, on the use of blood for sorcery. In one passage, Rig-vidh. III, 18, 3, it is one's own blood that is to be used. But the specific interpretation given here by Buddhaghosa cannot be paralleled from the Brahmanical books.}</p>

 <p><small>{1. Anga-vi<i>gg</i>â. Buddhaghosa thus separates this from the a<u>n</u>ga<i>m</i> of No. 1. In both the passages <i>G</i>ât. II, 200, 250 the knowledge is simply that of judging from a man's appearance that he is rough or bad, and it is the good man in the story (in the second case the Bodisat himself) who is the anga-vi<i>gg</i>â-pâ<i>th</i>ako. So at <i>G</i>ât. V, 458 it is by anga-vi<i>gg</i>â that the Bodisat prophesies that a man will be cruel.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Vatthu-vi<i>gg</i>â. Childers (Dict., p. 559) has 'pool' instead of 'house,' having misread sara for ghara (s and gh are nearly alike in Sinhalese). The craft is further explained by Buddhaghosa in his comment on the Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta I, 26. Its success depended on the belief that the sites were haunted by spirits. See further below, § 27.</p>
 
 <p>3. Khatta-vi<i>gg</i>â. The Burmese MSS. correct the rare khatta into the familiar khetta. Khetta-vi<i>gg</i>â indeed occurs at Ud. III, 9, and may just possibly there (in connection with writing, arithmetic, tables, &amp;c.) be correct in the meaning of 'land-survering, mensuration.' Buddhaghosa, though his explanation is corrupt, evidently understands the phrase in a sense similar to that of khatta-dhamma at <i>G</i>ât. V, 489, 490; Mil. 164 (see also 178); and his gloss nîti-sattham is probably nearer the mark than <i>S</i>a<u>n</u>kara's (on <i>Kh</i>ând. Up. VII, I, 2), which is dhanur-veda. It is the craft of government, then lying in great part in adhering to custom.</p>
 
 <p>The Sutta only follows the Upanishad in looking at all these crafts as minor matters, but it goes beyond it in looking upon them as a 'low' way, for a Brahman, of gaining a livelihood.</p>
 
 <p>4. Siva-vi<i>gg</i>â. It is clear that siva is used euphemistically, and we may here have an early reference to what afterwards developed into the cult of the god <i>S</i>iva. Buddhaghosa gives an alternative explanation as knowledge of the cries of jackals.</p>
 
 <p>5. Bhûta-vi<i>gg</i>â. Also in the <i>Kh</i>ândogya list (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</p>
 
 <p>6. Bhûri-vi<i>gg</i>â. It is the same as bhûri-kamma<i>m</i>, explained in the same way by Buddhaghosa on § 27 below.</p>
 
 <p>7. Ahi-vi<i>gg</i>â. One method is described at <i>G</i>ât. IV, 457, 8. Perhaps such charms against snake bite as Ath.-v. V, 13; VI, 12, 56; VII, 88, are included.}</p>

 <p>3. Understanding their language.</p>

 <p>7. The whole of this 'low art' as applied to gems has been collected in a series of manuals now edited by L. Finot in his 'Lapidaires Indiens,' Paris, 1896.</p>
 
 <p>8. The art in these four cases is to determine whether the marks on them show they will bring good (or bad) luck to the houses in which they dwell.</p>
 
 <p>9. The art in these five cases is to say whether it is unclean or not to eat them.</p>

 <p><small>{1. Throughout these paragraphs the plural is used. This cannot be honorific, as the few great kings of that time are always spoken of in the singular. Yet all the previous translators, except Burnouf, translate by the singular--'the king will march out,' &amp;c. It is evident that we have to understand 'chiefs,' and not the 'king': and that not absolute monarchies, but republican institutions of a more or less aristocratic type, were in the mind of the composer of the paragraph.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Nakkhatta, translated by Gogerly and Neumann a 'planet.' Buddhaghosa explains it by 'Mars and so on.' This may apply to planets, but also to stars in general, and I know no other passage where the meaning of the word is confined to planets. Burnouf has 'constellation,' but what can the eclipse of a constellation mean?</p>
 
 <p>3. Patha-gamana and uppatha-gamana. Prof. Kielhorn says (in a note he has been kind enough to send me on this section): 'What the author means by these words I do not know. But uppatha-gamana would be literally "aberration, the going away from one's proper path"; and patha-gamana therefore should be "following one's proper course." I am sure the two words could not mean conjunction and opposition; nor, I think, ascension and declension. It is curious that Buddhaghosa has not explained them.'}</p>

 <p>2. Disâ-dâho. 'Thunder and lightning,' according to Neumann; 'fiery corruscations in the atmosphere,' according to Gogerly, whom Burnouf follows. But Buddhaghosa's words are only explicable of a jungle fire. Compare <i>G</i>ât. I, 212, 213, 374.</p>
 
 <p>3. Burnouf takes these four words to refer to four occurrences. Gogerly and Neumann take them as only two. Buddhaghosa seems to imply four.</p>
 
 <p>4. Muddâ. There has been great diversity in the various guesses made at the meaning in this connection of muddâ, which usually means 'seal' or 'seal-ring.' Gogerly has 'conveyancing,' and so also Childers; Burnouf takes this word and the next as one compound in the sense of foretelling the future 'by calculating diagrams'; and Neumann has 'Verwaltungsdienste,' administrative services. Buddhaghosa is very curt. He says only hattha-mudda ganana. Hattha-muddâ is found elsewhere only at <i>G</i>ât. III, 528, where hattha-mudda<i>m</i> karoti means 'to beckon,' and at Vin. V, 163, where it is said of the polite member of the Order that he makes no sign with his hand, nor beckons. (On hattha-vikâra compare Mil. I, 207, 547 = Vin. I, 157 = Vin. II, 2I6.) Both these passages are much later than our text, and the sense of beckoning is here impossible. But muddâ is mentioned as a craft at Vin. IV, 7 (where it is called honourable), at M. I, 85, and several times in the Milinda (pp. 3, 59, 78, 178 of the Pâli text), and muddiko as the person who practises that craft at D. I, 51 and Vin. IV, 8. The Sinhalese comment on this (quoted in my translation of the Milinda, I, 91) shows that the art there was simply arithmetic, using the joints or knuckles or the fingers as an aid to memory. And this is no doubt the meaning in our paragraph.}</p>

 <p><small>{1. Gananâ. Buddhaghosa's comment on this is a<i>kkh</i>iddakâ-ga<i>n</i>anâ, in contradistinction to the last. It is evidently calculation not broken up by using the fingers, mental arithmetic pure and simple. The accountant who uses this method is called ga<i>n</i>ako (D. I, 51; Vin. IV, 8). Buddhaghosa's comment on the latter passage is given by Minayeff at Pat. 84, but with a wrong reading, akkhi<i>mt</i>aka.</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Sa<i>m</i>khâ<i>n</i>am, literally 'counting up.' He who has the faculty of doing this can, on looking at a tree, say how many leaves it has, says Buddhaghosa. But the first words of his comment are doubtful. He may perhaps mean calculating masses by means of the rosary. Burnouf skips this word, and Neumann has simply 'counting.'</p>
 
 <p>3. Kâveyya<i>m</i>. The word recurs, in a bad sense, at A. I, 72 = III, 107, and also at S. I, 110 in the phrase kâveyya-matto, 'drunk with prophecy, inspired.' Buddhaghosa enumerates, in the words of A. II, 230, four kinds of poetry, and explains them in nearly the same words as found in the Manoratha Pûranî on that passage. None of the four refer to sacrificial hymns. Impromptu rhyming, ballad singing, and the composition of poems are meant.</p>

 <p>3. Sa<i>m</i>vadana<i>m</i>. Childers calls this a magic art, following Burnouf who calls it sorcery. Buddhaghosa explains it as astrology. The fact is all these expressions are technical terms for acts of astrology or sorcery, they none of them occur elsewhere either in Pâli or Sanskrit, and the tradition preserved by Buddhaghosa may be at fault in those cases in which the use of the word had not survived to later times. The general sense may be sufficiently clear, but for absolute certainty of interpretation we must wait till examples are found in Indian books of the actual use of the words, not in mere lists, hut in a connection which shows the meaning. Ath.-v. III, 30 is a charm to secure concord in a family, compare VII, 52; and there are several charms in the Atharva-veda for success in gambling.</p>

 <p>5. It would be useless to seek in the Atharva-veda, which (with the one exception mentioned in the notes to the next section) gives only the charms which are supposed to bring benefits, for instances of these malevolent practices. But we have here direct evidence that black magic, as was indeed inevitable, was as fully trusted in the sixth century B.C. in the valley of the Ganges as white. We need not be surprised that the malevolent charms are not recorded.}</p>

 <p><small>{1. Âdâsa-pañ<i>h</i>o. Buddhaghosa says they made a god appear in the mirror and answer questions put. It is a later conception to discard the god, and make the mirror itself give pictures of the hidden events. The mirror is of metal (Par. Dîp. 235).</small></p>
 
 <p>2. Kumârî-pañ<i>h</i>o. Through a girl of good family and repute.</p>
 
 <p>3. Deva-pañ<i>h</i>o. Also obtained through a girl, but this time a deva-dâsî or temple prostitute. It is instructive to find, even under the patriarchal regime of the sixth century B. C., that men thought they could best have communications from the gods through the medium of a woman.</p>
 
 <p>4. Âdi<i>kk</i>upa<i>tth</i>ânam. Such sun-worship is ridiculed in the <i>G</i>âtaka of the same name, No. 173.</p>
 
 <p>5. Buddhaghosa explains the Great One as Mahâ Brahmâ. This seems to me very doubtful. It is at least odd to find Brahmâ introduced in this connection. We may grant that the Buddhists might have put sun-worship into a list of sorceries, but there was no ceremonial cult of Brahma and little or none of Brahmâ. And however much the new gospel might hold the spetulations of the dominant theosophy in contempt, that would scarcely explain their being ranked as privates in this regiment. Burnouf avoids this by rendering the phrase generally 'serving the great,' and Neumann has 'practising sorcery.' Neither of these guesses seems happy. Mahat in composition is elsewhere always mahâ in Pâli, and we possibly have here a sandhi for mahatî-upa<i>tth</i>âna<i>m</i>, in the sense of worship of the Great Mother, the Earth, with covert allusion to mahî. This would give excellent sense, as the worship of the Mother Earth was closely associated in the popular mind with witchcraft. A god or goddess is certainly meant, and one so associated would be best in place here. It is perhaps worthy of note that in the oldest portion of the Taittirîya Upanishad, Sun, Moon, Earth, and <i>S</i>rî occur together in a set of mystic groups, and Sun, Moon, Brahma, and food are all identified by a word-play with Mahas (Sîk<i>s</i>â-vallî 4-7).</p>

 <p><small>{1. The Buddhist view of Nos. 11-25 must not be mistaken. It is sufficiently clear from the numerous examples in the Vinaya (see especially 'Vinaya Texts,' II, pp. 41-144), and from the high praise accorded to <i>G</i>îvaka and other physicians, that the objection was to recluses and Brahmans practising medicine as a means of livelihood. They might do so gratis for themselves or for their coreligionists, and laymen might do so for gain.</small></p>
 
 <p>The use of pa<i>t</i>imokkha in No. 25 is curious. It is when, for instance, a purgative is first given and then a tonic to counteract the other, to set free from its effect. Compare <i>G</i>ât. V, 25.</p>

As in our colloquial expression a 'viewy man,' di<i>tth</i>i almost always, and anudi<i>tth</i>i in all the seven passages where it occurs, have a connotation of contempt--a mere view. an offhand ill-considered opinion, a delusion.

It is true that these--Khattiyas, Brahmans, Vessas, and Suddas--were not castes, but four divisions of the people, each consisting of many subdivisions (by customs as to connubium and commensality) which afterwards hardened into castes.

 <p>sooner or later, this world-system begins to re-evolve. When this happens the Palace of Brahmâ appears, but it is empty. And some being or other, either because his span of years has passed or his merit is exhausted, falls from that World of Radiance, and comes to life in the Palace of Brahmâ. And there also he lives made of mind, feeding on joy, radiating light from himself, traversing the air, continuing in glory; and thus does he remain for a long long period of time.</p>
 
 <p>   4. 'Now there arises in him, from his dwelling there so long alone, a dissatisfaction and a longing: "O! would that other beings might come to join me in this place!" And just then, either because their span of years had passed or their merit was exhausted, other beings fall from the World of Radiance, and appear in the Palace of Brahmâ as companions to him, and in all respects like him. <a name="text%20p.%2018">[18]</a></p>

Mr. Crow evidently considered himself the Mahâ Brahmâ of the period.</small></p>

And it might well be, brethren, that some being on his falling from that state, should come hither. And having come hither he might go forth from the household life into the homeless state, And having thus become a recluse he, by reason of ardour of exertion of application of earnestness of careful thought, reaches up to such rapture of heart that, rapt in heart, he calls to mind his last dwelling-place, but not the previous ones. He says to himself: "That illustrious Brahmâ, the Great Brahmâ, the Supreme One, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days, the Father of all that are and are to be, he by whom we were created, he is stedfast immutable eternal, of a nature that knows no change, and he will remain so for ever and ever.

A man, having gone without food for seven days even, may restore his strength by the use of clear broth and so on. But the gods can't play tricks with themselves; and it they lose their heads and forget their meal-times, they die--pass away from that state. The poor gods!

In the sense of 'consider' (from <i>gh</i>âyati, to think) the word has only been found at S. N., p. 143.

Not perceiving that, and depending on the analogy of birds, who fly away from one tree only to alight on another, they conclude that the mind, when this individuality is broken up, goes (as a unity) elsewhere.}</small></p>

 <p>   10. 'In the first place, brethren, some recluse or Brahman puts forth the following opinion, the following view: "Since, Sir, this soul has form, is built up of the four elements, and is the offspring of father and mother, it is cut off, destroyed, on the dissolution of the body; and does not continue after death; and then, Sir, the soul is completely annihilated."

 <p>and have experienced it. And since this soul, on the dissolution of the body, is cut off and destroyed, does not continue after death, then is it, Sir, that the soul is completely annihilated."

 <p>   12. 'To him another says: "There is, Sir, such a soul as you describe. That I do not deny. But the whole soul, Sir, is not then completely annihilated.

 <p>   13. 'To him another says: "There is, Sir, such a soul as you describe. That I do not deny. But the whole soul, Sir, is not then completely annihilated. For there is a further soul, which by passing beyond ideas of form, by the dying out of ideas of resistance, by paying no heed to ideas of difference, conscious that space is infinite, reaches up to the plane of the infinity of space{1}.

 <p>2. Compare the 6th Vimokha.</p>
 
 <p>3. Though it is not explicitly so stated, this last of these seven theorisers is no doubt to be considered as believing in all the sorts of soul held by the others, so that he believes in seven. One may compare the five souls each more subtle than the last, made respectively of anna, prâ<i>n</i>a, manas, vi<i>gñ</i>â<i>n</i>a, and ânanda (food, breath, mind, consciousness, and joy), described in the Taittirîya Upanishad II, 1-5. The Buddhist modification of these theories omits the souls, and treats instead of various states of mind (produced by stages of meditation), the attainment of which, during this life, leads to rebirth in corresponding worlds, or planes of existence, named after those stages of meditations. But the oldest Pi<i>t</i>aka texts say very little about it, and the history of Buddhist speculation on the matter has yet to be formulated.</p>
 
 <p>Centuries afterwards we find a somewhat analogous conception in the gradually ascending series of seven, each more subtle than the last (Sthûla-<i>s</i>arira, li<u>n</u>ga-<i>s</i>arîra, indriya, manas, aha<u>n</u>kara, buddhi, and âtman), set out in the Sâ<u>n</u>khya texts, and the later Vedânta has a similar series. There is sufficient truth in the idea or the series of seven set out in our text to explain the persistence of the general idea in all the Indian systems, but the details and the application are strikingly different.</p>
 
 <p>The text shows that the four Arûpa Vimokhas of the Buddhist theory were regarded by the early Buddhists as derived from closely allied speculations, older than Buddhism, and expressed in almost identical phraseology.}</p>
