 S<small>HE</small>, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this or that rebirth, entered the Order when Sikhi was Buddha. And one day, while yet a novice, she was walking in procession with Bhikkhunīs, doing homage at a shrine, when an Arahant Therī in front of her hastily spat in the court of the shrine. Coming after her, but not having noticed the Therī's action, she said in reproof: 'What prostitute has been spitting in this place?'
 </p>
 
 <p>
 As a Bhikkhunī, observing the Precepts, she felt repugnance for rebirth by parentage, and set her mind intently on spontaneous re-generation. So in her last birth she came into being spontaneously at Vesālī, in the King's gardens, at the foot of a mango-tree. The gardener found her, and brought her to the city. She was known as the Mango-guardian's girl. And such was her beauty, grace, and charm that many young Princes strove with each other to possess her, till, in order to end their strife, and because the power of karma impelled them, they agreed to appoint her courtezan. Later on, out of faith in the Master, she built a Vihāra <a href="pos18.htm#120-1"><sup>337</sup></a> in her own gardens, and handed it over to him and the Order. And when she had heard her own son, the Elder Vimala-Kondañña, preach the Norm, she worked for insight, and studying the law of impermanence as illustrated in her own ageing body, she uttered the following verses:

 And inasmuch as the Therī, by the visible signs of impermanence in her own person, discerned impermanence in all phenomena of the three planes, and bearing that in mind, brought into relief the signs of Ill and of No-soul, she, making clear her insight in her Path-progress, attained Arahantship.

 She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, was born, ninety-one æons ago, in the time of Vipassi Buddha, in a clansman's family. One day she saw the Exalted One seeking alms in the city of Bandhumatī, and filling his bowl with sweet cakes, she worshipped low at his feet in joy and gladness. And when, after many rebirths in heaven and on earth in consequence thereof, she had accumulated the conditions requisite for emancipation, she was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at Vesālī, in the house of a very prosperous brahmin, and named Rohiṇī. <a href="pos18.htm#125-1"><sup>345</sup></a>  Come to years of discretion, she went, while the Master was staying at Vesālī, to the Vihāra, and heard the doctrine. She became a 'Stream-entrant,' and teaching her parents the doctrine, and they accepting it, she gained their leave to enter the Order. Studying for insight, she not
 long after attained Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and meaning.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 And reflecting on a discussion she had had with her father while she had yet only entered the Stream, she uttered the substance of it as verses of exultation:

 She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, till she had accumulated the sources of good, and matured the conditions for emancipation, was, in this Buddha-age, reborn in the Vankahāra country, at a certain village of trappers, as the daughter of the chief trapper, and named Cāpā. <a href="pos18.htm#129-1"><sup>351</sup></a> And at that time Upaka, an ascetic, <a href="pos18.htm#129-2"><sup>352</sup></a> met the Master as he was going to Benares, there to set rolling from his Bo-tree throne <a href="pos18.htm#129-3"><sup>353</sup></a> the Wheel of the Norm, and asked him: 'You seem, my friend, in perfect health! Clear and pure is your complexion. Wherefore have you, friend, left the world? or who may your teacher be? or whose doctrine do you believe in?' And he was thus answered:
 </p><blockquote>
 'All have I overcome. All things I know,<br>
 'Mid all things undefiled. Renouncing all,  <br>
 In death of Craving wholly free. My own  <br>
 The Deeper View. Whom should I name to thee?  <br>
 For me no teacher lives. I stand alone  <br>
 On earth, in heav'n rival to me there's none. <br>
  <br>
 Now go I on seeking Benares town,  <br>
 To start the Wheel, the gospel of the Norm,  <br>
 To rouse and guide the nations blind and lost,  <br>
 Striking Salvation's drum, Ambrosia's alarm.'
 </blockquote>
 
 
 <p>
 The ascetic, discerning the omniscience and great mission of the Master, was comforted in mind, and replied: 'Friend, may these things be! Thou art worthy <a href="pos18.htm#130-1"><sup>354</sup></a> to be a conqueror, world without end!' Then, taking a by-road, he came to the Vankahāra country, and abode near the hamlet of the trappers, where the head trapper supplied his wants. One day the latter, setting off on a long hunt with sons and brothers, bade his daughter not neglect 'the Arahant' <a href="pos18.htm#130-2"><sup>355</sup></a> in his absence. Now, she was of great beauty; and Upaka, seeking alms at her home, and captivated by her beauty, could not eat, but took his food home, and laid down fasting, vowing he would die should he not win Cāpā. After seven days the father returned, and, on inquiring for his 'Arahant,' heard he had not come again after the first day. The trapper sought him, and Upaka, moaning, and rolling over, confessed his plight. The trapper asked if he knew any craft, and he answered, 'No;' but offered to fetch their game and sell it. The trapper consented, and, giving him a coat, brought him to his own home, and gave him his daughter. In due time she had a son, whom they called Subhadda. <a href="pos18.htm#130-3"><sup>356</sup></a> Cāpā, when the baby cried, sang to him: 'Upaka's boy, ascetic's boy, game-dealer's boy, don't cry, don't cry!' mocking her husband. And he said at length: 'Do not thou, Cāpā, fancy I have none to protect me. <a href="pos18.htm#130-4"><sup>357</sup></a> I have a friend, even a conqueror eternal, and to him I will go.' She saw that he was vexed, and teased him again and again in the same way, till one day, in anger, he got ready to go. She said much, but vainly, to prevent him, and he
 set out <i>westward</i>. And the Exalted One was then at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, and announced this to the brethren: 'He who to-day shall come asking, "Where is the Conqueror eternal?" send him to me.' And Upaka arrived, and, standing in the midst of the Vihāra, asked: 'Where is the Conqueror eternal?' So they brought him, and when he saw the Exalted One, he said: 'Dost know me, Exalted One?' 'Yea, I know. But thou, where hast thou spent the time?' 'In the Vankahāra country, lord.' 'Upaka, thou art now an old man; canst thou bear the religious life?' 'I will enter thereon, lord.' The Master bade a certain Bhikkhu, 'Come, do thou, Bhikkhu, ordain him.' And he thereafter exercising and training himself, was soon established in the Fruition of the Path-of-No-Return, and thereupon died, being reborn in the Aviha heavens. <a href="pos18.htm#131-1"><sup>358</sup></a> At the moment of that rebirth he attained Arahantship.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Seven have thus attained it, as it has been said.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 But Cāpā, sick at heart over his departure, delivered her boy to his grandfather, and, following in the way Upaka had gone, renounced the world at Sāvatthī, and attained Arahantship. And uniting Upaka's verses with her own, she thus exulted:

 <p>
 She too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, was reborn thirty-one æons ago, when Vessabhu was Buddha, in a clansman's family. One day she ministered to the Master with alms, and worshipped him, and he perceived her believing heart, and thanked her. After celestial and other happy rebirths, her knowledge having come to maturity, she was, in this Buddha-age, reborn at Benares as the daughter of Sujāta, a brahmin. Because of her perfect form they called her Sundarī (Beauty). When she grew up, her younger brother died. Her father, overmastered by grief, and going to and fro, met the Therī Vāsiṭṭhī <a href="pos18.htm#135-1"><sup>362</sup></a> When she asked him what afflicted him, he answered as in the first two verses. Wishing to allay his grief, she spoke the next two verses, and told him of her own griefless state. The brahmin asked her: 'How, lady, did you become free from grief (<i>a-sokā</i>)?' The Therī told him of the Three Jewels, the Refuges. 'Where,' he asked, 'is the Master?' 'He is now at Mithilā.' So the brahmin drove in his carriage to Mithilā and sought audience of the Master. To him the Master taught the Norm; and he believed, and entered the Order, attaining Arahantship on the third day, after strenuous effort in establishing insight.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 But the charioteer drove his chariot back to Benares, and told the brahminee what had taken place. When Sundarī heard of it, she asked her mother, saying: 'Mother, I too would leave the world.' The mother said: 'All the wealth in this house belongs to you. You are the heiress of this family. Take up your heritage and enjoy it. Go not forth.' But Sundarī said: 'Wealth is no use to me. Mother, I would leave the world;' and, bringing the mother to consent, she abandoned her great possessions like so much spittle, and entered the Order (at Benares). And studying and striving because of the promise in her and the maturity of her knowledge, she attained Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and meaning.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Dwelling thereafter in the ease of fruition and the bliss
 of Nibbana, she thought: 'I will utter a Lion's Roar <a href="pos18.htm#136-1"><sup>363</sup></a> before the Master.' And asking permission of her teacher, she left Benares, accompanied by a great following of Bhikkhunīs, and in due course came to Sāvatthī, did obeisance to the Master, and stood on one side. Welcomed by him, she declared her A<small>ÑÑĀ</small> by extolling her relation to him as the 'daughter of his mouth,' and so on. Thereupon all her kinsfolk, beginning with her mother, and their attendants, renounced the world. She, reflecting on her attainment, and using her father's utterances in her own Psalm, exulted as follows:

 She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy, so that she had progressively planted the root of good and accumulated the conditions of emancipation, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at Rājagaha as the daughter of a certain goldsmith. From the beauty of her person she was called Subhā. Come to years of discretion, she went one day, while the Master was at Rājagaha, and belief in him had come to her, and did obeisance, seating herself on one side. The Master, seeing the maturity of her moral faculties, and in accordance with her wish, taught her the Norm enshrined in the Four Truths. She was thereby established in the fruition of Stream-entry, which is in countless ways adorned. Later she realized the disadvantages of domestic life, and entered the Order under the Great Pajāpatī the Gotamid, devoting herself to the higher Paths. From time to time her relations invited her to return to the world, urging its charms. To them thus come one day, she set forth the danger in house-life and in the world, preaching the Norm in the twenty-four verses below, and dismissed them cured of their desire. She then strove for insight, purifying her faculties, till at length she won Arahantship. As Arahant she spoke thus:

 All these I left, and sought the Sisterhood, <br>
 Turning my back upon no mean estate. (340)</a><br><br><a name="341">
 Amiss were't now that I, who in full faith <br>
 Renounced that world, who well discerned the Truth, <br>
 Who, laying down what gold and silver bring, <br>
 Cherish no worldly wishes whatsoe'er, <br>
 Should, all undoing, come to you again! (341)</a><br><a name="342">
 Silver and gold avail not to awake, </a><a href="pos18.htm#143-1"><sup>377</sup></a> <br>
 Or soothe. Unmeet for consecrated lives, <a href="pos18.htm#143-2"><sup>378</sup></a> <br>
 They are not Ariyan–not noble–wealth. (342)<br><a name="343">
 Whereby greed is aroused and wantonness, <br>
 Infatuation and all fleshly lusts, <br>
 Whence cometh fear for loss and many a care: <br>
 Here is no ground for lasting steadfastness. (343)</a><br><a name="344">
 Here men, heedless and maddened with desires, <br>
 Corrupt in mind, by one another let <br>
 And hindered, strive in general enmity. (344)</a><br><a name="345">
 Death, bonds, and torture, ruin, grief; and woe <br>
 Await the slaves of sense, and dreadful doom. (345)</a><br><a name="346">
 Why herewithal, my kinsmen–nay, my foes– <br>
 Why yoke me in your minds with sense-desires?<br>
 Know me as one who saw, and therefore fled, <br>
 The perils rising from the life of sense. (346)</a><br><a name="347">
 Not gold nor money can avail to purge <br>
 The poison of the deadly Āsavas. <br>
 Ruthless and murderous are sense-desires; <br>
 Foemen of cruel spear and prison-bonds. (347)</a><br><a name="348">
 Why herewithal, my kinsmen–nay, my foes– <br>
 Why yoke me in your minds with sense-desires? <br>
 Know me as her who fled the life of sense, <br>
 Shorn of her hair, wrapt in her yellow robe. (348)</a><br><a name="349">
 The food from hand to mouth, </a><a href="pos18.htm#144-1"><sup>379</sup></a> glean'd here and there, <br>
 The patchwork robe–these things are meet for me, <br>
 The base and groundwork of the homeless life. <a href="pos18.htm#144-2"><sup>380</sup></a> (349)<br><br><a name="350">
 Great sages </a><a href="pos18.htm#144-3"><sup>381</sup></a> spue forth all desires of sense, <br>
 Whether they be in heaven or on earth; <br>
 At peace they dwell, for they freeholders are, <br>
 For they have won unfluctuating bliss. (350)<br><a name="351">
 Ne'er let me follow after worldly lusts, <br>
 Wherein no refuge is; for they are foes, <br>
 And murderers, and cruel blazing fires. </a><a href="pos18.htm#144-4"><sup>382</sup></a> (351)<br><a name="352">
 Oh! but an incubus is here, the haunt <br>
 Of dread and fear of death, a thorny brake, <br>
 A greedy maw it is, a path impassable, <br>
 Mouth of a pit wherein we lose our wits, (352)</a><br><a name="353">
 A horrid shape of doom impending–such <br>
 Are worldly lusts; uplifted heads of snakes.<br>
 Therein they that be fools find their delight– <br>
 The blinded, general, average, sensual man. (353)</a><br><br><a name="354">
 For all the many souls, who thus befooled <br>
 Err ignorant in the marsh of worldly lusts, <br>
 Heed not that which can limit birth and death. (354)</a><br><br><a name="355">
 Because of worldly lusts mankind is drawn <br>
 By woeful way to many a direful doom– <br>
 Where ev'ry step doth work its penalty.</a> <a href="pos18.htm#145-1"><sup>383</sup></a> (355)<br><br><a name="356">
 Breeders of enmity are worldly lusts, <br>
 Engendering remorse and vicious taints. <br>
 Flesh baits, to bind us to the world and death. (356)</a><br><br><a name="357">
 Leading to madness, to hysteria, <br>
 To ferment of the mind, are worldly lusts, <br>
 Fell traps by Māra laid to ruin men. (357)</a><br><br><a name="358">
 Endless the direful fruit of worldly lusts, <br>
 Surcharged with poison, sowing many ills, <br>
 Scanty and brief its sweetness, stirring strife, <br>
 And withering the brightness of our days. (358)</a><br><br><a name="359">
 For me who thus have chosen, ne'er will I <br>
 Into the world's disasters come again, <br>
 For in Nibbana is my joy alway. (359)</a><br><br><a name="360">
 So, fighting a [good] fight with worldly lusts, <br>
 I wait in hope for the Cool Blessedness, <br>
 Abiding earnest in endeavour, till <br>
 Nought doth survive that fetters me to them. (360)</a><br><br><a name="361">
 T<small>HIS</small> is my Way, the Way that leads past grief, <br>

 When, on the eighth day after her ordination, she won Arahantship, attaining fruition, seated beneath a tree, the Exalted One uttered these three verses (<a href="pos18.htm#362">362</a>-364) in her praises, pointing her out to the Brethren. And the last verse was added by them who recited (the canon at the Council), to celebrate Sakka's adoration.
