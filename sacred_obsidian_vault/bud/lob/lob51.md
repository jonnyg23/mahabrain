 <p>IN the city of Atavi there ruled a king who was very fond of hunting. One day, he saw an enormous deer and started in pursuit. The deer was fleet of foot, and in the heat of the chase, the king lost sight of the other hunters. Finally, the prey escaped, and weary and discouraged, the king sat down under a tree. He fell asleep.</p>  
 <p>It happened that a wicked God named Alavaka lived in the tree. He liked to feed on human flesh, and he killed and devoured all who came near him. He saw the king; he rejoiced, and the poor hunter was about to be dealt a severe blow when a noise fortunately awoke him. He realized that his life was threatened; he made an attempt to rise, but the God took him by the throat and held him down. Then the king tried to plead with him.</p>  
 <p>"Spare me, my lord!" said he. "By your terrifying appearance, I know you to be one of the Gods that eat human flesh. Oh, deign to be kind to me. You will have no cause to regret your mercy. I shall reward you with magnificent gifts."</p>  
 <p>"What care I for gifts!" replied Alavaka. "It</p>  
 <p><a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="green">p. 248</font></a></p>  
 <p>is your flesh I want; it will appease my hunger."</p>  
 <p>"My lord," replied the king, "if you let me return to Atavi, I shall send you a man every day to satisfy your hunger."</p>  
 <p>"When you get back to your home, you will forget this promise."</p>  
 <p>"No," said the king, "I never forget a promise. Besides, if I should once fail to make this daily offering, you have only to come to my palace and tell me of your grievance, and, immediately, without resisting, I shall follow you, and you may devour me."</p>  
 <p>The God allowed himself to be persuaded, and the king returned to the city of Atavi. But he kept thinking of his cruel promise; there was no way he could evade it, and henceforth he would have to he a hard and ruthless master.</p>  
 <p>He sent for his minister and told him what had happened. The minister considered for a moment, then said to the king:</p>  
 <p>"My lord, in the prison of Atavi there are criminals who have been condemned to death. We can send them to the God. When he sees that you are keeping faith with him, perhaps he will relieve you of your promise."</p>  
 <p>The king approved of the suggestion. Guards were sent to the prison, and to those whose days were numbered they said:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="green">p. 249</font></a></p>  
 <p>"Not far from the city there is a tree inhabited by a God who is very fond of rice. Whoever leaves a plate of rice for him at the foot of the tree will be granted a full pardon."</p>  
 <p>Whereupon, each day, one of these men, carrying a plate of rice, joyously set out for the tree, never to return.</p>  
 <p>Presently, there were no men condemned to death left in prison. The minister ordered the judges to be extremely severe and to acquit no one accused of murder except on irrefutable proof of his innocence, but it was in vain; some new way had to be found for appeasing the hunger of the God. Then they began to sacrifice the thieves.</p>  
 <p>In spite of all their efforts to apprehend the guilty, the prison was again empty, and the king and his minister were compelled to look for victims among the worthy inhabitants of the city. Old people were carried off and forcibly led to the tree, and if the guards were not fleet-footed, the God would sometimes devour them and the victims as well.</p>  
 <p>A vague uneasiness possessed the city of Atavi. The old people were seen to disappear; no one knew what became of them. And, each day, the king's remorse grew more poignant. But he lacked the courage to sacrifice his life to the welfare of his people. He thought:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="green">p. 250</font></a></p>  
 <p>"Will no one come to my assistance? There lives in Cravasti, and sometimes in Rajagriha, I have been told, a man of great power, a Buddha, whose prodigies are loudly praised. They say he is fond of travelling. Why, then, does he not come into my kingdom?"</p>  
 <p>By his power of divination, the Buddha knew of the king's desire. He flew through the air and came to Alavaka's tree. There, he sat down.</p>  
 <p>The God saw him. He started walking toward him, but, suddenly, he became powerless. His knees trembled. Fury seized him.</p>  
 <p>"Who are you?" he asked, fiercely.</p>  
 <p>"A being far more powerful than yourself," replied the Buddha.</p>  
 <p>Alavaka was in a terrible rage. He would have liked to torture this man who was sitting on the ground in front of him, this man whom he could not reach; he would have liked to torture him to death. The Buddha never lost his composure.</p>  
 <p>Alavaka finally managed to control himself. He thought that cunning would perhaps succeed where strength had failed, and in a pleasant voice he said:</p>  
 <p>"I see you are a wise man, my Lord; it is always a pleasure for me to interrogate men of wisdom. I ask them four questions. If they can answer, they are free to go wherever they please; if they can not answer, they remain my prisoners,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="green">p. 251</font></a></p>  
 <p>and I devour them when I feel so disposed."</p>  
 <p>"Ask me the four questions," said the Buddha.</p>  
 <p>"I must warn you," said Alavaka, "that no one has ever answered them. You will find scattered around the bones of those I interrogated in the past."</p>  
 <p>"Ask me the four questions," repeated the Buddha.</p>  
 <p>"Well then," said Alavaka, "how can man avoid the river of passions? How can he cross the sea of existences and find safe harbor? How can he escape the tempests of evil? How can he be left untouched by the storm of desires?"</p>  
 <p>In a quiet voice, the Buddha replied:</p>  
 <p>"Man avoids the river of passions if he believes in the Buddha, in the law and in the community; he crosses the sea of existences and finds safe harbor if he understands works of holiness; he will escape the tempests of evil if he performs works of holiness; he will be left untouched by the storm of desires if he knows the sacred path that leads to deliverance."</p>  
 <p>When Alavaka heard the Master's answers, he fell at his feet and worshipped him, and he promised to change his savage ways. Then, together, they went to Atavi, to the palace of the king.</p>  
 <p>"King," said the God, "I release you from your pledge."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="green">p. 252</font></a></p>  
 <p>The king was happier than he had ever been before. When he knew who had saved him, he cried:</p>  
 <p>"I believe in you, my Lord, who have saved me and saved my people; I believe in you, and I shall dedicate my life to proclaiming your glory, the glory of the law and the glory of the community."</p>
