 <p></p><hr> <h2 align="CENTER">1. RATANASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>For all beings salvation is only to be found in Buddha, Dhamma, and Sa<u>n</u>gha.--Text and translation in Childers' Khuddaka Pâ<i>th</i>a, p. 6.</blockquote> 
 <p>   <a></a>1. Whatever spirits have come together here, either belonging to the earth or living in the air, let all spirits be happy, and then listen attentively to what is said. (221)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>2. Therefore, O spirits, do ye all pay attention, show kindness to the human race who both day and night bring their offerings; therefore protect them strenuously. (222)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>3. Whatever wealth there be here or in the other world, or whatever excellent jewel in the heavens, it is certainly not equal to Tathâgata. This excellent jewel (is found) in Buddha, by this truth may there be salvation. (223)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>4. The destruction (of passion), the freedom from passion, the excellent immortality which Sakyamuni attained (being) composed,--there is nothing equal to that Dhamma. This excellent jewel (is found) in the Dhamma, by this truth may there be salvation. (224)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>5. The purity which the best of Buddhas praised, the meditation which they call uninterrupted, there is no meditation like this. This excellent jewel (is</p> 
 <p><a>p. 38</a></p> 
 <p>found) in the Dhamma, by this truth may there be salvation. (225)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>6. The eight persons that are praised by the righteous<sup>[1]</sup>, and make these four pairs, they are worthy of offerings, (being) Sugata's disciples; what is given to these will bear great fruit. This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly (sa<u>n</u>gha), by this truth may there be salvation. (226)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>7. Those who have applied themselves studiously with a firm mind and free from desire to the commandments of Gotama, have obtained the highest gain, having merged into immortality, and enjoying happiness after getting it for nothing. This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly, by this truth may there be salvation. (227)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>8. As a post in the front of a city gate is firm in the earth and cannot be shaken by the four winds, like that I declare the righteous man to be who, having penetrated the noble truths, sees (them clearly). This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly, by this truth may there be salvation. (228)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>9. Those who understand the noble truths well taught by the profoundly wise (i.e. Buddha), though they be greatly distracted, will not (have to) take the eighth birth. This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly, by this truth may there be salvation. (229)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>10. On his (attaining the) bliss of (the right) view three things (dhammas) are left behind (by him): conceit and doubt and whatever he has got of virtue and (holy) works. He is released also from the four hells, and he is incapable of committing the six</p>

 <p><a>p. 39</a></p> 
 <p>deadly sins. This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly, by this truth may there be salvation. (230)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>11. Even if he commit a sinful deed by his body, or in word or in thought, he is incapable of concealing it, (for) to conceal is said to be impossible for one that has seen the state (of Nibbâna). This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly, by this truth may there be salvation. (231)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>12. As in a clump of trees with their tops in bloom in the first heat of the hot month, so (Buddha) taught the excellent Dhamma leading to Nibbâna to the greatest benefit (for all). This excellent jewel (is found) in Buddha, by this truth may there be salvation. (232)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>13. The excellent one who knows what is excellent, who gives what is excellent, and who brings what is excellent, the incomparable one taught the excellent Dhamma. This excellent jewel (is found) in Buddha, by this truth may there be salvation. (233)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>14. The old is destroyed, the new has not arisen, those whose minds are disgusted with a future existence, the wise who have destroyed their seeds (of existence, and) whose desires do not increase, go out like this lamp. This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly, by this truth may there be salvation. (234)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>15. Whatever spirits have come together here, either belonging to the earth or living in the air, let us worship the perfect (tathâgata) Buddha, revered by gods and men; may there be salvation. (235)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>16. Whatever spirits have come together here, either belonging to the earth or living in the air, let us worship the perfect (tathâgata) Dhamma, revered by gods and men; may there be salvatlon. (236)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>17. Whatever spirits have come together here,</p> 
 <p><a>p. 40</a></p> 
 <p>either belonging to the earth or living in the air, let us worship the perfect (tathâgata) Sa<u>n</u>gha, revered by gods and men; may there be salvation. (237)</p>

 <p>   <a></a>2. 'He who eats what has been well prepared, well dressed, what is pure and excellent, given by others, he who enjoys food made of rice, eats, O Kassapa, Âmagandha (what defiles one). (239)</p>

 <p>   <a></a>5. 'Those persons who in this world are unrestrained in (enjoying) sensual pleasures, greedy of sweet things, associated with what is impure, sceptics (natthikadi<i>tth</i>i), unjust, difficult to follow;--this is Âmagandha, but not the eating of flesh. (242)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>6. 'Those who are rough, harsh, backbiting, treacherous, merciless, arrogant, and (who being) illiberal do not give anything to any one;--this is Âmagandha, but not the eating of flesh. (243)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>7. 'Anger, intoxication, obstinacy, bigotry, deceit, envy, grandiloquence, pride and conceit, intimacy with the unjust;--this is Âmagandha, but not the eating of flesh. (244)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>8. 'Those who in this world are wicked, and such as do not pay their debts, are slanderers, false in their dealings, counterfeiters, those who in this world being the lowest of men commit sin;--this is Âmagandha, but not the eating of flesh. (245)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>9. 'Those persons who in this world are unrestrained (in their behaviour) towards living creatures, who are bent upon injuring after taking others' (goods), wicked, cruel, harsh, disrespectful;--this is Âmagandha, but not the eating of flesh. (246)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>10. 'Those creatures who are greedy of these (living beings, who are) hostile, offending; always bent upon (evil) and therefore, when dead, go to darkness and fall with their heads downwards into hell;--this is Âmagandha, but not the eating of flesh. (247)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>11. 'Neither the flesh of fish, nor fasting, nor nakedness, nor tonsure, nor matted hair, nor dirt, nor rough skins, nor the worshipping of the fire, nor the many immortal penances in the world, nor hymns, nor oblations, nor sacrifice, nor observance of the</p>

 <p>   <a></a>13. Thus Bhagavat preached this subject again and again, (and the Brâhma<i>n</i>a) who was accomplished in the hymns (of the Vedas) understood it; the Muni who is free from defilement, independent, and difficult to follow, made it clear in various stanzas. (250)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>14. Having heard Buddha's well-spoken words, which are free from defilement and send away all pain, he worshipped Tathâgata's (feet) in humility, and took orders at once. (251)</p>

 <p></p><hr> <h2 align="CENTER">5. SÛ<i>K</i>ILOMASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>The Yakkha Sû<i>k</i>iloma threatens to harm Buddha, if he cannot answer his questions. Buddha answers that all passions proceed from the body.</blockquote> 
 <p>   So it was heard by me:</p> 
 <p>   At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Gayâ (seated) on a stone seat in the realm of the Yakkha Sû<i>k</i>iloma. And at that time the Yakkha Khara and the Yakkha Sû<i>k</i>iloma passed by, not far from Bhagavat. And then the Yakkha Khara said this to the Yakkha Sû<i>k</i>iloma: 'Is this man a Sama<i>n</i>a?'</p> 
 <p>   Sû<i>k</i>iloma answered: 'He is no Sama<i>n</i>a, he is a Sama<i>n</i>aka (a wretched Sama<i>n</i>a); however I will ascertain whether he is a Sama<i>n</i>a or a Sama<i>n</i>aka.'</p> 
 <p>   Then the Yakkha Sû<i>k</i>iloma went up to Bhagavat, and having gone up to him, he brushed against Bhagavat's body. Then Bhagavat took away his body. Then the Yakkha Sû<i>k</i>iloma said this to Bhagavat: 'O Sama<i>n</i>a, art thou afraid of me?'</p> 
 <p>   Bhagavat answered: 'No, friend, I am not afraid of thee, but thy touching me is sinful.'</p> 
 <p>   Sû<i>k</i>iloma said: 'I will ask thee a question, O Sama<i>n</i>a; if thou canst not answer it I will either scatter thy thoughts or cleave thy heart, or take thee by the feet and throw thee over to the other shore of the Ga<u>n</u>gâ.'</p> 
 <p>   Bhagavat answered: 'I do not see, O friend, neither in this world together with the world of the Devas, Mâras, Brahmans, nor amongst the generation of Sama<i>n</i>a and Brâhma<i>n</i>as, gods and men, the one who can either scatter my thoughts or cleave my heart, or take me by the feet and throw me over</p> 
 <p><a>p. 46</a></p> 
 <p>to the other shore of the Ga<u>n</u>gâ. However ask, O friend, what thou pleasest.' Then the Yakkha Sû<i>k</i>iloma addressed Bhagavat in a stanza:</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>1. ' What origin have passion and hatred, disgust, delight, and horror? wherefrom do they arise? whence arising do doubts vex the mind, as boys vex a crow?' (269)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>2. Buddha said: 'Passion and hatred have their origin from this (body), disgust, delight, and horror arise from this body; arising from this (body) doubts vex the mind, as boys vex a crow. (270)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>3. 'They originate in desire, they arise in self, like the shoots of the banyan tree; far and wide they are connected, with sensual pleasures, like the mâluvâ creeper spread in the wood. (271)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>4. 'Those who know whence it (sin) arises, drive it away. Listen, O Yakkha! They cross over this stream that is difficult to cross, and has not been crossed before, with a view to not being born again.' (272)</p>

 <p>   <a></a>1. A just life, a religious life, this they call the best gem, if any one has gone forth from house-life to a houseless life. (273)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>2. But if he be harsh-spoken, and like a beast delighting in injuring (others), then the life of such a one is very wicked, and he increases his own pollution. (274)</p> 
 <p><a>p. 47</a></p> 
 <p>   <a></a>3. A Bhikkhu who delights in quarrelling and is shrouded in folly, does not understand the Dhamma that is preached and taught by Buddha. (275)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>4. Injuring his own cultivated mind, and led by ignorance, he does not understand that sin is the way leading to hell. (276)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>5. Having gone to calamity, from womb to womb, from darkness to darkness, such a Bhikkhu verily, after passing away, goes to pain. (277)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>6. As when there is a pit of excrement (that has become) full during a number of years,--he who should be such a one full of sin is difficult to purify. (278)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>7. Whom you know to be such a one, O Bhikkhus, (a man) dependent on a house, having sinful desires, sinful thoughts, and being with sinful deeds and objects, (279)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>8. Him do avoid, being all in concord; blow him away as sweepings, put him away as rubbish. (280)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>9. Then remove as chaff those that are no Sama<i>n</i>as, (but only) think themselves, blowing away those that have sinful desires and those with sinful deeds and objects. (281)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>10. Be pure and live together with the pure, being thoughtful; then agreeing (and) wise you will put an end to pain. (282)</p>

 <p>   So it was heard by me:</p> 
 <p>   At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Sâvatthî, in <i>G</i>etavana, in the park of Anâthapi<i>nd</i>ika. Then many wealthy Brâhma<i>n</i>as of Kosala, decrepit, elderly, old, advanced in age, or arrived at extreme old age, went to Bhagavat, and having gone to him they talked pleasantly with him, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable talk with him, they sat down apart. Sitting down apart these wealthy Brâhma<i>n</i>as said this to Bhagavat: 'O venerable Gotama, are the Brâhma<i>n</i>as now-a-days seen (engaged) in the Brâhmanical customs (dhamma) of the ancient Brâhma<i>n</i>as?'</p> 
 <p>   Bhagavat answered: 'The Brâhma<i>n</i>as now-a-days, O Brâhma<i>n</i>as, are not seen (engaged) in the Brâhmanical customs of the ancient Brâhma<i>n</i>as.'</p> 
 <p>   The Brâhma<i>n</i>as said: 'Let the venerable Gotama tell us the Brâhmanical customs of the ancient Brâhma<i>n</i>as, if it is not inconvenient to the venerable Gotama.'</p> 
 <p>   Bhagavat answered: 'Then listen, O Brâhma<i>n</i>as, pay great attention, I will speak.'</p> 
 <p>   'Yes,' so saying the wealthy Brâhma<i>n</i>as listened to Bhagavat. Bhagavat said this:</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>1. The old sages (isayo) were self-restrained, penitent; having abandoned the objects of the five senses, they studied their own welfare. (283)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>2. There were no cattle for the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, nor gold, nor corn, (but) the riches and corn of meditation were for them, and theey kept watch over the best treasure. (284)</p> 
 <p><a>p. 49</a></p> 
 <p>   <a></a>3. What was prepared for them and placed as food at the door, they thought was to be given to those that seek for what has been prepared by faith. (285)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>4. With garments variously coloured, with beds and abodes, prosperous people from the provinces and the whole country worshipped those Brâhma<i>n</i>as. (286)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>5. Inviolable were the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, invincible, protected by the Dhamma, no one opposed them (while standing) at the doors of the houses anywhere. (287)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>6. For forty-eight years they practised juvenile chastity, the Brâhma<i>n</i>as formerly went in search of science and exemplary conduct. (288)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>7. The Brâhma<i>n</i>as did not marry (a woman belonging to) another (caste), nor did they buy a wife; they chose living together in mutual love after having come together. (289)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>8. Excepting from the time about the cessation of the menstruation else the Brâhma<i>n</i>as did not indulge in sexual intercourse<sup>[1]</sup>. (290)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>9. They praised chastity and virtue, rectitude, mildness, penance, tenderness, compassion, and patience. (291)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>10. He who was the best of them, a strong Brâhma<i>n</i>a, did not (even) in sleep indulge in sexual intercourse. (292)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>11. Imitating his practices some wise men in this world praised chastity and patience. (293)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>12. Having asked for rice, beds, garments, butter. and oil, and gathered them justly, they made sacrifices</p> 
 <p>[1. A<i>ññ</i>atra tamhâ samayâ<br>      Utuverama<i>n</i>im pati<br>      Antarâ methuna<i>m</i> dhamma<i>m</i><br>      Nâsu ga<i>kkh</i>anti brâhma<i>n</i>â.]</p>

 <p>out of them, and when the sacrifice came on, they did not kill cows. (294)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>13. Like unto a mother, a father, a brother, and other relatives the cows are our best friends, in which medicines are produced. (295)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>14. They give food, and they give strength, they likewise give (a good) complexion and happiness; knowing the real state of this, they did not kill cows. (296)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>15. They were graceful, large, handsome, renowned, Brâhma<i>n</i>as by nature, zealous for their several works; as long as they lived in the world, this race prospered. (297)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>16. But there was a change in them: after gradually seeing the king's prosperity and adorned women, (298)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>17. Well-made chariots drawn by noble horses, carpets in variegated colours, palaces and houses, divided into compartments and measured out, (299)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>18. The great human wealth, attended with a number of cows, and combined with a flock of beautiful women, the Brâhma<i>n</i>as became covetous. (300)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>19. They then, in this matter, having composed hymns, went to Okkâka, and said: 'Thou hast much wealth and corn, sacrifice thy great property, sacrifice thy great wealth.' (301)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>20. And then the king, the lord of chariots, instructed by the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, brought about assamedha, purisamedha, sammâpâsa, and vâ<i>k</i>âpeyya without any hinderance, and having offered these sacrifices he gave the Brâhma<i>n</i>as wealth: (302)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>21. Cows, beds, garments, and adorned women, and well-made chariots, drawn by noble horses, carpets in variegated colours, (303)</p> 
 <p><a>p. 51</a></p> 
 <p>   <a></a>22. Beautiful palaces, well divided into compartments; and having filled these with different (sorts of) corn, he gave this wealth to the Brâhma<i>n</i>as. (304)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>23. And they having thus received wealth wished for a store, and the desire of those who had given way to (their) wishes increased still more; they then, in this matter, having composed hymns, went again to Okkâka, and said: (305)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>24. 'As water, earth, gold, wealth, and corn, even so are there cows for men, for this is a requisite for living beings; sacrifice thy great property, sacrifice thy wealth.' (306)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>25. And then the king, the lord of chariots, instructed by the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, caused many hundred thousand cows to be slain in offerings. (307)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>26. The cows, that are like goats, do not hurt any one with their feet or with either of their horns, they are tender, and yield vessels (of milk),--seizing them by the horns the king caused them to be slain with a weapon. (308)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>27. Then the gods, the forefathers, Inda, the Asuras, and the Rakkhasas cried out: 'This is injustice,' because of the weapon falling on the cows. (309)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>28. There were formerly three diseases: desire, hunger, and decay, but from the slaying of cattle there came ninety-eight. (310)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>29. This injustice of (using) violence that has come down (to us), was old; innocent (cows) are slain, the sacrificing (priests) have fallen off from the Dhamma. (311)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>30. So this old and mean Dhamma is blamed by the wise; where people see such a one, they blame the sacrificing priest. (312)</p> 
 <p><a>p. 52</a></p> 
 <p>   <a></a>31. So Dhamma being lost, the Suddas and the Vessikas disagreed, the Khattiyas disagreed in manifold ways, the wife despised her husband. (313)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>32. The Khattiyas and the Brâhma<i>n</i>as and those others who had been protected by their castes, after doing away with their disputes on descent, fell into the power of sensual pleasures. (314)</p> 
 <p>   This having been said, those wealthy Brâhma<i>n</i>as said to Bhagavat as follows:</p> 
 <p>   'It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! As one raises what has been overthrown, or reveals what has been hidden, or tells the way to him who has gone astray, or holds out an oil lamp in the dark that those who have eyes may see the objects, even so by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways the Dhamma has been illustrated; we take refuge in the venerable Gotama, in the Dhamma, and in the Assembly of Bhikkhus; may the venerable Gotama receive us as followers (upâsaka), who from this day for life have taken refuge (in him).'</p>

 <p>   <a></a>1. A man should worship him from whom he learns the Dhamma, as the gods (worship) Inda; the learned man being worshipped and pleased with him, makes the (highest) Dhamma manifest. (315)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>2. Having heard and considered that (Dhamma), the wise man practising the Dhamma that is in</p>

 <p>   <a></a>3. He who serves a low (teacher), a fool who has not understood the meaning, and who is envious, goes to death, not having overcome doubt, and not having understood the Dhamma. (317)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>4. As a man, after descending into a river, a turgid water with a rapid current, is borne along following the current,--how will he be able to put others across? (318)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>5. Even so how will a man, not having understood the Dhamma, and not attending to the explanation of the learned and not knowing it himself, not having overcome doubt, be able to make others understand it? (319)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>6. As one, having gone on board a strong ship, provided with oars and rudder, carries across in it many others, knowing the way to do it, and being expert and thoughtful, (320)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>7. So also he who is accomplished, of a cultivated mind, learned, intrepid, makes others endowed with attention and assiduity understand it, knowing (it himself). (321)</p> 
 <p>   <a></a>8. Therefore indeed one should cultivate (the society of) a good man, who is intelligent and learned; he who leads a regular life, having understood what is good and penetrated the Dhamma, will obtain happiness. (322)</p>
