 <h3 align="CENTER">God the Savior</h3>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="1.">1.</a></font></span>
 <p>The theology of the whole Christian world is founded on the worship of three Gods. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2.">2.</a></font></span>
 <p>God is one in essence and Person. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3.">3.</a></font></span>
 <p>In Him is a Trinity, and this must not be distinguished into Persons. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="4.">4.</a></font></span>
 <p>The Divine attributes constitute His essence. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5.">5.</a></font></span>
 <p>These are many, and also succeeding. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6.">6.</a></font></span>
 <p>The succeeding Divine attributes are creation and preservation, redemption and salvation, reformation and regeneration. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7.">7.</a></font></span>
 <p>These are Divine, but that they are not as God is in Himself. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="8.">8.</a></font></span>
 <p>The one God willed to become a natural Man, and thus a full Man, for many reasons, the primary of which was the redemption of angels and men. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9.">9.</a></font></span>
 <p>Passages from Scripture showing that there is one God. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="10.">10.</a></font></span>
 <p>He is the Redeemer and Savior. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="11.">11.</a></font></span>
 <p>He came into the world. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="12.">12.</a></font></span>
 <p>As to His Human, He called Himself Jesus Christ. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="13.">13.</a></font></span>
 <p>Jehovah Himself came into the world and became the Savior and Redeemer. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="14.">14.</a></font></span>
 <p>The one God is not only the Creator, but also the Redeemer and Regenerator. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="15.">15.</a></font></span>
 <p>As to the Divine truth, He descended and took upon Himself the Human, is confirmed in John, Chap. 1. Also, that He was from eternity, also from His nativity, Luke 1. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="16.">16.</a></font></span>
 <p>Passages from the sacred Scripture showing that He is the truth and the light; also, that He is the Word and that He fulfilled the whole of it. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="17.">17.</a></font></span>
 <p>All things were made by him. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="18.">18.</a></font></span>
 <p>In the spiritual sense, Divine truth is called the Son of God. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="19.">19.</a></font></span>
 <p>Divine truth is meant by Messiah, Christ, King, the Anointed, and David. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="20.">20.</a></font></span>
 <p>Divine truth is meant by angel and by one sent. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="21.">21.</a></font></span>
 <p>Divine truth is meant by glory. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="22.">22.</a></font></span>
 <p>In no other way could all things in the heavens and in the hells have been reduced into order. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="23.">23.</a></font></span>
 <p>In no other way could He destroy the old church and institute a new church. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="24.">24.</a></font></span>
 <p>In no other way could He admit temptations into Himself, and suffer. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="25.">25.</a></font></span>
 <p>In no other way could He be in the state of exinanition and pray to God the Father as though absent. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="26.">26.</a></font></span>
 <p>In no other way could He become Redemption and Justice from His own power. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="27.">27.</a></font></span>
 <p>Thus, in no other way could He unite the Human to the Divine and the reverse, and thus add the Human in time to the Divine from eternity. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="28.">28.</a></font></span>
 <p>In no other way could He be and become one with the Father. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="29.">29.</a></font></span>
 <p>All things which are in the Divine are together in the Human. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="30.">30.</a></font></span>
 <p>The Lord glorified His Human in the order in which He makes man spiritual, or an angel. Concerning the two states of man's regeneration. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="31.">31.</a></font></span>
 <p>Thus He made His Human Divine. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="32.">32.</a></font></span>
 <p>Thus He became the First and the Last, thus the all in all. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="33.">33.</a></font></span>
 <p>The Divine operation is from firsts through lasts, and because, in the church, lasts had failed, therefore, He made Himself the Last. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="34.">34.</a></font></span>
 <p>Man cannot be conjoined with God except by means of a visible and accessible Human. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="35.">35.</a></font></span>
 <p>Every male is born, as to his spiritual origin, from truth as a seed. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="36.">36.</a></font></span>
 <p>The reason why men have not hitherto perceived this, and why consequently there have been so many opinions about the human nature of Christ, is because men have had no distinct understanding concerning the nature of good and truth and of their marriage, nor concerning the nature of the will and the understanding, nor of the soul and the body. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="37.">37.</a></font></span>
 <p>The virgin also, of whom He was born, signifies the church as to the affection of truth. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="38.">38.</a></font></span>
 <p>It was necessary for Him to be born of a virgin in legitimate marriage with Joseph. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="39.">39.</a></font></span>
 <p>Christ alone is man from eternity and natural man in time. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="40.">40.</a></font></span>
 <p>In Him everything is Divine from the Divine in itself. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="41.">41.</a></font></span>
 <p>He alone is to be approached, that there may be salvation. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="42.">42.</a></font></span>
 <p>He must be approached immediately, and if He is approached mediately, communication is intercepted. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="43.">43.</a></font></span>
 <p>Here may be adduced those passages, which treat of the "great affliction," and the things which follow. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="44.">44.</a></font></span>
 <p>To worship three Gods is to worship none. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="45.">45.</a></font></span>
 <p>No one comes to God or is conjoined to Him, unless the Human be approached; otherwise God is not accessible. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="46.">46.</a></font></span>
 <p>Because God the Father is the Redeemer as to the Human. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="47.">47.</a></font></span>
 <p>In order that there may be conjunction, there must be a visible God, thus one accessible and fixed; this is not so apparent to Christians, but it is to all others. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="48.">48.</a></font></span>
 <p>The Divine truth suffered.  </p>
