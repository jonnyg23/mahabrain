B. He has thereby made the Human Divine; 10 8  (H.B. 9) thus heaven and the church are His, and they are in Divine truths from Him; 10, 12 9  (H.B. 10) thus also there are affections for truth, and in these are the societies of heaven. 12 10  (H.B. 11) Of the church where the Word is: it should depart from the affections of the natural man; 11 11  (H.B. 12) thus will it be the church of the Lord, 11 12-14  (H.B. 13-15) and thus it will have cognitions of truth and good, with subservient knowledges (scientiae); 11 15  (H.B. 16) so there will be conjunction with the Lord in heaven. 11, 16 16  (H.B. 17) It will possess primary truths. 11, 16 17  (H.B. 18) The whole church will serve the Lord. 11, 16 </p>

 <p>Psalm 49 title, 1-4    (H.B. 1-5) Let there be attention to the following: 2 5, 6    (H.B. 6, 7) Respecting those who are merely natural, and boast of knowledges [scientifica] and their own intelligence. 2 7-9    (H.B. 8-10) No salvation comes from that source. 2 10-13    (H.B. 11-14) However much they may boast of such things, they perish, 2, 15 14    (H.B. 15) and come into hell. 2, 15 15    (H.B. 16) Salvation is solely in the Lord. 17 16-20    (H.B. 17-21) Knowledge [scientia] and one's own intelligence does not save after death. 2 </p>

 <p>Psalm 50 title, 1-6    (H.B. 1-6) The Lord will come for judgment to those with whom is the church. 1, 15 7-13    The Lord does not desire sacrifices and external worship. 2 14, 15    He desires confession of the heart. 2 16-20    External worship is of no avail, so long as evils are committed. 2 [21,] 22    They do evils, and therefore evil befalls them. 2 </p>
