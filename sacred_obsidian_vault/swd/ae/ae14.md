 <p>And shall overcome them and kill them, signifies the consequent destruction of every good and truth of the church. This is evident from the signification of "to overcome and kill the two witnesses," as being to destroy the things signified by "the two witnesses," which are the good of love and charity and the truth of doctrine and faith. That these will be destroyed by the affections of the natural man separated from the affections of the spiritual man, which are evil cupidities of every kind arising from infernal loves, is signified by "the beast that cometh up out of the abyss;" and that it was foretold that this would come to pass at the end of the church, when the Last Judgment takes place, has been said above. "To kill" signifies in the Word to kill spiritually, which means here to destroy the good of love and the truth of doctrine, as may be seen above (n. 315). </p>

 <p>Verse 8. And their bodies shall be upon the street of the great city, signifies their extinction by the evils and falsities of doctrine. This is evident from the signification of "bodies" as being that the good of love and the truth of doctrine signified by "the two witnesses" have been extinguished; for "to be killed" signifies to be extinguished, here spiritually, because it refers to those who have wholly destroyed these things in themselves. In like manner the Lord is said "to have been slain" and "to be dead," to signify that the Divine proceeding from Him, which is Divine good and Divine truth, has been rejected, that is, the Lord has been slain and is dead with those by whom that has been rejected (see above, n. 83). This is evident also from the signification of "the street of the great city," as being the truth and good of doctrine, and in the contrary sense the falsity and evil of doctrine; for "street" signifies truth leading, and in the contrary sense falsity leading (of which presently); and "city" signifies doctrine (of which above, n. 223). It is said "great city," because "great" is predicated of good, and in the contrary sense of evil, as "many" is predicated of truth, and in the contrary sense of falsity (see above, n. 223, 336, 337). This now makes clear that "the bodies of the two witnesses upon the street of the great city" signifies the extinction of the good of love and charity and of the truth of doctrine and faith by the falsities and evils of doctrine. As the evils and falsities of doctrine are signified, it is next said "which great city is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt," "Sodom" signifying the evils of the love, and "Egypt" the falsities therefrom, each pertaining to doctrine, by which the church at its end is destroyed (concerning which in the following articles). [2] "Street" signifies the truth of doctrine, and in the contrary sense the falsity of doctrine, because in the spiritual sense a "way" signifies truth leading to good, and in the contrary sense falsity leading to evil (see above, n. 97); and streets are ways in a city, and as a "city" signifies doctrine, so a "street" signifies the truth and the falsity of doctrine. Moreover, in the spiritual world there are cities, and streets in them, as in the cities of the world; and what each one is in respect to the affection of truth and intelligence therefrom is known there merely from the place where he dwells and from the streets in which he walks. Those who are in a clear perception of truth dwell in the southern quarter of the city and also walk there; those who are in a clear affection of the good of love dwell in the eastern quarter and also walk there; those who are in an obscure affection of the good of love dwell in the western quarter and also walk there; and those who are in an obscure perception of truth dwell in the northern quarter and also walk there. But in the cities where those live who are in the persuasion of falsity from evil the reverse is true. This makes clear why it is that a "street" signifies truth or falsity leading. [3] That "streets" have this signification can be seen from the following passages. In Jeremiah:      Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see, I pray, and know, and seek in the open places thereof if ye can find a man that doeth judgment, that seeketh truth; then will I pardon her (Jer. 5:1). Because "the streets of Jerusalem and the open places thereof" signify the truths of doctrine, according to the states of affection and perception of those who are of the church, and because "Jerusalem" signifies the church in respect to doctrine it is said, "Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see and know, and seek in the open places thereof;" and because "judgment" is predicated of truths, since all judgment comes from laws and precepts, which are truths, and because "truth" signifies the truth of doctrine and of faith it is said, "if ye can find a man that doeth judgment and that seeketh truth."  The "open places" mean particularly the corners of the city, thus the quarters where the dwelling places are; and as each one in the cities in the spiritual world has his dwelling place in accordance with his affection of good and his perception of truth, clear or obscure, therefore "open places" signify truths and goods according to each one's affection and perception. [4] In Isaiah:      Judgment hath been rejected backward, and justice hath stood afar off; for truth hath stumbled in the street, and rectitude cannot enter (Isa. 59:14). "Judgment and justice" signify in the Word truth and good; that these no longer exist is signified by "judgment hath been rejected backward, and justice has stood afar off;" that they have wandered away from the truths of doctrine, and consequently there is no truth in the life, which is the good of life, is signified by "truth hath stumbled in the street, and rectitude cannot enter," for all good of life is acquired by means of the truths of doctrine, for it is by them that a man learns how he ought to live. Because "street" signifies where truth leads, it is said "truth hath stumbled in the street." [5] In Nahum:      The chariots raged in the street, they ran to and fro in the open places (Nah. 2:4). Because "chariots" signify the doctrinals of truth, and "streets" and "open places" what is in accord with each one's affection and perception, as above, it is said "the chariots raged in the streets, they ran to and fro in the open places," "to rage" signifying to call falsities truths, and "to run to and fro" signifying to wander off. [6] In the book of Judges:      In the days of Jael the ways ceased, they that go in footpaths went in crooked paths, they ceased, the open places ceased in Israel (Judg. 5:6, 7). This is in the Song of Deborah and Barak, which treats of the desolation of truth in the church, and afterwards of its restoration; the desolation is described by "the ways ceased, they that go in footpaths went in crooked paths, they ceased, the open places ceased in Israel;" "ways and paths" having the same signification as "streets and open places," namely, truths of doctrine leading, and "to go in crooked ways" signifies to wander away from truths. [7] In Isaiah:      The city of emptiness shall be broken down, every house shall be shut that no one may enter; a cry over the wine in the streets; every joy shall be mixed, the gladness of the earth shall be banished (Isa. 24:10, 11). "The city of emptiness" signifies doctrine in which there is falsity and no truth; "house" signifies the good of the will and thus of the life; thence is evident what is signified by "the city of emptiness shall be broken down, every house shall be shut that no one may enter;" "a cry over the wine in the streets" signifies lamentation on account of the lack of truth and the mingling of truth with falsity, "wine" signifying the truth of the church from the Word; therefore it is said "in the streets," because "street" too signifies truth, and where truth is sought. "Joy and gladness" are mentioned, because "joy" is predicated of the delight that is from the affection of good, and "gladness" of the delight that is from the affection of truth; that these delights will cease is signified by "every joy shall be mixed, the gladness of the earth shall be banished," the earth signifying the church. [8] In Jeremiah:      How is the city of glory forsaken, the city of my joy! Therefore her young men shall fall in the streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off (Jer. 49:25, 26; 50:30). "The city of glory" signifies the doctrine of Divine truth, and "the city of joy" signifies the delight from the affection of good and truth therein; "young men" signify those who are made intelligent by means of truths; and that the understanding of truth would perish is signified by "the young men shall fall in the streets;" "men of war" signify truths combating against falsities; that there will be no defense of truth against falsities is signified by "all the men of war shall be cut off." [9] In Ezekiel:      You have multiplied your slain in this city, so that you have filled the streets thereof with the slain (Ezek. 11:6). The "slain" mean in the Word those who are destroyed by falsities; for the "sword," by which they are slain, signifies falsity destroying truth; "city" signifies here, as above, the doctrine of truth; thence appears what is signified by "the slain in the city;" "to fill the streets with the slain" signifies to lay waste the truth by falsities. [10] In Lamentations:      They that did eat delicacies are laid waste in the streets; and they that were brought up in crimson have embraced dunghills. The form of the Nazirites is darker than blackness, they are not recognized in the streets. They have wandered about blind in the streets, they are polluted with blood. They have hunted our steps so that we cannot go in the streets (Lam. 4:5, 8, 14, 18). Here, too, "streets" signify the truths of doctrine leading to the good of life, or truths according to which one must live. This treats of the church where the Word is, and its devastation in respect to truths; therefore "they that did eat delicacies are laid waste in the streets" signifies that those who have imbibed genuine truths from the Word have no longer any truths, "delicacies" meaning genuine truths from the Word; "they that were brought up in crimson have embraced dunghills" signifies that those who had imbibed genuine goods from the Word have nothing but the falsities of evil, "crimson" signifying the genuine good of the Word, in particular the celestial love of truth, and "dunghills" signifying the falsities of evil; "the form of the Nazirites is darker than blackness, they are not recognized in the streets," signifies that Divine truth is in such obscurity that it is apparent to no one; "the Nazirites" represent the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and therefore signify Divine truth from the Lord; "they have wandered about blind in the streets, they are polluted with blood," signifies that the truths of the Word are no longer seen because they have been falsified, "the blind" signifying those who do not see truths. "They have hunted our steps, so that we cannot go in the streets," signifies leading astray, so that it is not known how to live, "to hunt the steps" signifying to lead astray by falsities, and "to go" signifying to live, therefore "to go in the streets" signifies to live according to truths. [11] In Zephaniah:      I will cut off the nations, their corners shall be laid waste; I will make desolate their streets, that none may pass through; their cities shall be laid waste, that there may be no man nor inhabitant (Zeph. 3:6). The "nations that shall be cut off," signify the goods of the church; the "corners that shall be laid waste" signify the truths and goods of the church in the whole complex (that this is the signification of "corners" see above, n. 417); the "streets that shall be made desolate, that no one may pass through," signify the truths of doctrine; for the "cities that shall be laid waste, that there may be no man nor inhabitant," signify doctrinals, "man" and "inhabitants" meaning in the Word in the spiritual sense all who are in truths and goods, thus in an abstract sense, truths and goods. [12] In Zechariah:      I will return to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, whence Jerusalem shall be called the city of truth. There shall yet old men and women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and the streets shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof (Zech. 8:3-5). This is said of the Lord's coming, and of the New Church to be established by Him; "Zion" means the church in respect to the good of love, and "Jerusalem" the church in respect to the truths of doctrine, therefore Jerusalem is called "the city of truth;" "the old men and women who shall dwell in the streets of Jerusalem" mean those that are intelligent and wise through the truths of doctrine; "the boys and girls playing in the streets, of whom the streets of the city shall be full," signify the affections of truth and good and their delights, in which those shall abound who live in the truths of doctrine. [13] In Jeremiah:      According to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to shame, altars to burn incense to Baal (Jer. 11:13). "According to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah," signifies that there were as many falsities as doctrinals, "cities" signifying doctrinals, and "gods" falsities of religion; "according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to shame" signifies that there were as many kinds of worship as there were falsities of doctrine, "streets" here signifying the falsities of doctrine, and "altars" worship; worship from falsities is what is meant, because the altars meant were altars of incense, for it is said, "altars to burn incense to Baal," and "incense" signifies spiritual good, which in its essence is truth from good, and in the contrary sense falsity from evil.  (That this is the signification of "incense" and its "altar," see above, n. 324, 491, 492, 567.) [14] In the same:      Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The sons gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire, the women knead dough to make cakes to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out drink-offerings to other gods; I will make to cease in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness (Jer. 7:17, 18, 34). What these words signify in the spiritual sense may be seen fully explained above (n. 555); also that "the cities of Judah" signify the doctrinals of the church, and "the streets of Jerusalem" its truths of doctrine. [15] In the same:      Have ye forgotten the evils which they did in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? (Jer. 44:9) "The land of Judah" signifies the church in respect to good, but here in respect to evil; and "the streets of Jerusalem" signify the truths of doctrine, but here its falsities of doctrine. [16] In Ezekiel:      With the hoofs of his horses Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon shall trample down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people with the sword, and he shall bring down the pillars of strength to the earth; they shall make a spoil of thy wealth (Ezek. 26:11, 12). "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon" signifies the profanation of truth and its consequent destruction; "to trample down all thy streets with the hoofs of his horses" signifies that all the truths of the church will be destroyed by the fallacies of the sensual man; "he shall slay the people with the sword" signifies that truths will be destroyed by falsities; that thus also all worship from truths will be destroyed is signified by "he shall bring down the pillars of strength to the earth," for "pillars" signify holy worship from truths, and because all power is of truth from good they are called "pillars of strength;" that knowledges of truth will also be destroyed is signified by "they shall make a spoil of thy wealth." (That "wealth" and "riches" mean the knowledges of truth, see above, n. 236.) [17] In the same:      Thou hast built thee an eminent place and hast made thee an exalted place in every street, upon every head of the way thou hast made thee thy eminent place, and thou hast made thy beauty abominable (Ezek. 16:24, 25, 31). "Eminent place" and "exalted place" with the ancients signified heaven; from this came the practice of sacrificing upon high mountains, or in place of these upon places built up high, therefore worship from evils and from the falsities of doctrine is signified by "making an eminent and an exalted place in every street, and upon every head of the way;" and as that worship became idolatrous it is said that "they made their beauty abominable," "beauty" meaning truth and intelligence therefrom; for everyone in the spiritual world is beautiful according to truths from good, and intelligence therefrom. [18] In Amos:      Lamentations shall be in all the streets, and they shall say in all the open places, Alas, alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning (Amos 5:16). "Lamentations shall be in all the streets, and they shall say in all the open places, Alas, alas!" signifies grief because truth and good are everywhere laid waste; "and they shall call the husbandman to mourning" signifies the grief of the men of the church on this account, "husbandman" signifying the man of the church, because a "field" signifies the church in respect to the implantation of truth. [19] In David:      Our garners are full, affording food on food; our flocks are thousands and ten thousands in our streets; our oxen are laden, there is no breach nor fleeing away, nor outcry in our open places (Ps. 144:13, 14). "Garners which are full of food" signify the doctrinals from the Word, thus the Word itself, wherein are all truths of doctrine which furnish instruction and spiritual nourishment; "flocks are thousands and ten thousands in the streets" signifies spiritual goods and truths, "thousands of flocks" goods, and "ten thousands" truths; "oxen laden" signify natural goods and their affections; "no breach" signifies their coherence; "no fleeing away" signifies no loss of any of these; "no outcry in the open places" signifies no lamentation anywhere over the lack of these. [20] In Job:      God, who giveth rain upon the faces of the earth, and who sendeth waters upon the faces of the streets (Job 5:10). "To give rain upon the faces of the earth" signifies the influx of Divine truth into all things with those who are of the church; and "to send waters upon the faces of the streets" signifies Divine influx into the truths of doctrine, that man may be rendered spiritual thereby. [21] In Isaiah:      In its streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth, upon its roofs and in its streets he shall howl, flowing down in weeping (Isa. 15:3). This is said of the city Ar in the land of Moab, which signifies the doctrine of those who are in truths from the natural man; grief over their falsities of doctrine, from the first to the last, is signified by "they have girded themselves with sackcloth, upon its roofs and in its streets he shall howl," "roofs" meaning interior things, and "streets" exterior things with such. In Jeremiah:      Upon all the roofs of Moab and in its streets, lamentation everywhere (Jer. 48:38). The signification here is similar, as above. [22] In Daniel:      Know and perceive that from the going forth of the Word even to the restoration and building of Jerusalem, even to Messiah the prince; after sixty and two weeks it shall be restored and built, street and ditch, but in straitness of times (Dan. 9:25). He who knows not the spiritual sense of the Word may think that by "Jerusalem" here Jerusalem is meant, and that it is to be restored and built; also that "the street and ditch" which it is said will be restored and built mean a street and ditch of that city; but "Jerusalem" means the church that is to be established by the Lord, and "street and ditch" mean the truth of doctrine; "street" truth, and "ditch" doctrine. What is there signified by the number of weeks is not to be explained in this place. [23] This makes evident that "the street of the New Jerusalem" has a like signification in the following passages in Revelation:      The twelve gates were twelve pearls and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass (Rev. 21:21). And afterwards:      He showed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb; in the midst of the street thereof and of the river on either side was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits (Rev. 22:1, 2). But these passages will be explained hereafter. [24] In Isaiah:      Thy sons have fainted, they lay at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net (Isa. 51:20). This, too, is said of Jerusalem, that is, the church vastated in respect to doctrine, "sons" meaning those who are in the truths of doctrine; "to faint and to lie at the head of all the streets" signifies to be deprived of all truth, "head or beginning of the streets" signifying entrance to truth, thus all truth. [25] In Lamentations:      The infant and the suckling faint in the streets of the city. Lift up thy hands to the Lord respecting the souls of thine infants, who have fainted from famine at the head of all the streets (Lam. 2:11, 19). "Infant and suckling" signify innocence, and also the goods and truths that are first born and made alive by knowledges from the Word with men who are regenerating, and which, being the first, are faultless and blameless; entire lack of these is signified by "they have fainted in the streets of the city, and at the head of all the streets;" it is said "from famine," because "famine" signifies loss, lack, and ignorance of knowledges, and at the same time desire for them (see above, n. 386). [26] In Nahum:      Her infants were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets, and over her honorable ones they cast a lot, and all her great ones were bound with chains (Nah. 3:10). Here also "infants" mean the truths that are firstborn and vivified, and "to be dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets" signifies to be scattered and to perish; "honorable ones" signify the goods of love; "to cast a lot over them" signifies dispersion of these; "great ones" signify the truths of good; and "to be bound with chains" signifies to be tied by falsities so that truth cannot come forth. This is said of "the city of bloods" which signifies the doctrine in which the truths of the Word are falsified. [27] In Jeremiah:      Death cometh up through our windows, it cometh into our palaces, to cut off the infant from the street, the young men from the open places (Jer. 9:21). "Death" means here spiritual death, which takes place when falsity is believed to be truth and truth to be falsity, and the life is in accordance therewith; "windows" signify the thoughts from the understanding, "palaces" the interior and thus the more sublime things of the human mind; this makes clear what is signified by "death cometh up through the windows and cometh into our palaces;" "infant" signifies here as above the truths that are firstborn through knowledges from the Word; "young men" signify truths acquired, from which comes intelligence; and "streets and open places" signify the truths of doctrine and the truths of life which lead to intelligence and wisdom; this makes clear what is signified by "cutting off the infant from the street, the young men from the open places." [28] In the same:      I am full of the anger of Jehovah, I am weary with holding in; pour out upon the infant in the street, and upon the assembly of young men; for even the man with the woman shall be taken, the old man with him that is full of days (Jer. 6:11). Here "the infant in the street" and "the young men" have a similar signification as above; "man [vir] and woman" signify truth conjoined to good and intelligence therefrom; and "old man" and "one full of days" signify wisdom. [29] As "street" signifies the truth of doctrine leading, and in the contrary sense falsity, "the clay of the streets," "the mire," and "dung" signify the falsity of the love of evil, in the following passages. In Isaiah:      Their carcass has become as the dung of the streets (Isa. 5:25).      He shall make him to be trodden down like the clay of the streets (Isa. 10:6). In Micah:      She shall be trodden down like the mire of the streets (Mic. 7:10). In David:      I will beat them small as the dust before the faces of the wind, I will spread them out as the mire of the streets (Ps. 18:42). All this, too, is from the appearances in the spiritual world; in the cities there in which falsities from evil reign the streets appear full of dung, mire and clay. This makes evident what is signified by:      The Lord's commanding the seventy whom He sent out to preach the Gospel, Into whatever city ye enter and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say, Even the dust of your city that cleaveth unto us do we shake off from us <a name="fr_297"></a><a href="#fn_297"><font size="1">652-1</font></a> (Luke 10:10, 11). [30] Because "the streets of a city" signify the truths of doctrine, according to which one should live, it was customary to teach and to pray in the streets. Thus in the second book of Samuel:      Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice (2 Sam. 1:20).  In Matthew:      When thou doest alms sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the open places that they may have glory of men. And when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets where they may be seen of men (Matt. 6:2, 5). And in Luke:      Then shall ye begin to say, We did eat before Thee and drink, and Thou didst teach in our streets; but He shall say, I tell you I know you not whence ye are (Luke 13:26, 27). [31] Furthermore, from the signification of "street," as meaning the truth of doctrine, it is also evident why the Lord said in the parable that:      The master of the house commanded his servants to go out quickly into the streets and open places of the city and bring in the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind (Luke 14:21). "The poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind," do not mean such in a natural sense, but such in a spiritual sense, that is, such as had not the Word, and were therefore in ignorance of truth and in lack of good, but still desired truths by means of which they might obtain good; such were the Gentiles with whom the church of the Lord was afterwards established. [32] Because "the street of a city" signified either truth or falsity teaching and leading, therefore:      The angels that came to Sodom said that they would lodge all night in the street (Gen. 19:2). And for the same reason it was commanded that:      If the sons of Israel observed that those in any city served other gods they should smite the inhabitants of the city with the sword, utterly destroying the city, and they should bring all the spoil of it into the midst of the street, and burn the city and all the spoil with fire (Deut. 13:14, 16, 17). "Other gods" signify the falsities of worship, "the sword" the destruction of falsities by truths; "spoil" the falsification of truth; and "fire" the punishment of the love of evil and its destruction. [33] From these passages cited from the Word it can be seen what is signified by "the bodies of the two witnesses were cast forth upon the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt," and afterwards that "they were not suffered to be placed in sepulchers;" for it was a custom with the Jewish and Israelitish nation to cast out the slain that were enemies into the ways and streets, and not to bury them, as a sign of their hatred of such; but still this represented that by such enemies infernal evils and falsities that could not be raised again to life were meant, that is, those who were in infernal evils and falsities. [34] This is evident in Jeremiah:      The prophets prophesy, saying, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; by sword and by famine shall these prophets be consumed, and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem, and there shall be no one to bury them (Jer. 14:15, 16). A "prophet" means the doctrine of truth, here the doctrine of falsity, because they prophesied falsities; and as "streets" signified where falsities are, it is said that "they were to be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem." </p>
 
 
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="653.">653.</a></font></span>
 <p>Which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, signifies through the evils of the love of self and the falsities therefrom. This is evident from the signification of "Sodom," as being the love of self and evils of every kind therefrom (of which presently); also from the signification of "Egypt," as being the natural man separated from the spiritual, and falsity of evil of every kind therefrom (of which also presently). Evidently "Sodom and Egypt" mean Jerusalem, and thus the church, in which the goods of love are adulterated and the truths of doctrine are falsified, for it is next said "where also our Lord was crucified;" for the evils of the love of self and the falsities of doctrine are what crucify the Lord, therefore He was crucified by the Jews, because they were in those evils and falsities; but of this more hereafter. [2] First let it be shown here that "Sodom" signifies in the Word the love of self, and thence every evil; for evils of every kind flow forth from the love of self; since he who loves himself only loves what is his own [proprium], and therefore immerses all things of his will and his understanding in what is his own [proprium], even so that it is impossible for him to be elevated from it to heaven and to the Lord; consequently he sees nothing from the light of heaven, but solely from the light of the world, which light, separated from the light of heaven, is mere darkness in spiritual things, which are the things of heaven and the church; and for this reason also the more a man loves himself the more he despises, yea, denies spiritual things. In consequence also of this the internal spiritual mind, by which man is in the light of heaven, is closed up, and this causes the man to be merely natural, and the merely natural man is inclined to evils of every kind. For the evils into which man is born have their seat in the natural man, and these are removed from him only to the extent in which his interior mind, which receives the light of heaven, is opened; moreover, what is man's own [proprium] has its seat in the natural man, and what is man's own [proprium] is nothing but evil. [3] That "Sodom" therefore signifies the love of self, and thus evils of every kind, can be seen from the passages in the Word where "Sodom" is mentioned; as in the following. In Ezekiel:      Thy elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters dwelling at thy left hand; but thy younger sister, dwelling at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters; thou hast corrupted thyself more than they in all thy ways; Sodom thy sister hath not done, she and her daughters, as thou hast done and thy daughters. Behold, this was the iniquity of Sodom, pride, satiety of bread, and tranquillity of quiet was hers and her daughters, and she strengthened not the hand of the afflicted and needy; therefore they became lofty, and committed abomination before Me (Ezek. 16:46-50). This treats of the abominations of Jerusalem, which were chiefly that they adulterated the goods and truths of the Word and of the church; "Samaria," where the Israelites were, signifies the spiritual church, in which spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor, is the essential; but "Jerusalem," where the Jews were, signifies the celestial church, in which celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, is the essential. For there are two kingdoms into which heaven and thence the church is divided, the spiritual kingdom and the celestial kingdom (respecting these kingdoms see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 20-28). These kingdoms were represented by the Israelites whose metropolis was Samaria, and by the Jews whose metropolis was Jerusalem. [4] Spiritual good, which is the good of charity toward the neighbor, is the opposite of infernal evil, which is the evil of the love of the world; and celestial good is the opposite of diabolical evil, which is the evil of the love of self. From the love of self flow forth evils of all kinds, and much worse than those from love of the world (see the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 65-83). This is why more direful and abominable things are related of Jerusalem than of Samaria; and this is why Jerusalem is not only called "Sodom," but it is said that she did worse things than Sodom, as it is here said "Sodom hath not done as thou hast done and thy daughters." That the evil of the love of self was the evil of Sodom, is thus declared, "This was the iniquity of Sodom, pride, satiety of bread, tranquillity of quiet, and she strengthened not the hand of the afflicted and needy," "pride" meaning the love of self, "satiety of bread," the contempt of all good and truth of heaven and the church, even to loathing of them, "tranquillity of quiet," security and no anxiety on account of any evil; and "not strengthening the hands of the afflicted and needy" signifies unmercifulness. Because the love of self was the love of Sodom it is said that her daughters "became lofty and committed abomination before Jehovah," the "daughters" that became lofty signifying the cupidities of that love, and the "abomination before Jehovah" signifying every evil against the Divine Itself. [5] Because the "Chaldeans" signify the profanation and adulteration of the truth of doctrine from the Word, and "the inhabitants of Babylon" the profanation and adulteration of the good of love, therefore the overthrow of these is also compared to the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah. In Jeremiah:      A sword against the Chaldeans, and against the inhabitants of Babylon, according to God's overthrowing Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring cities thereof, not a man shall dwell there, nor shall a son of man sojourn therein (Jer. 50:35, 40).  And in Isaiah:      So shall Babylon, the ornament of kingdoms, the splendor of the magnificence of the Chaldeans, be as God's overthrowing Sodom and Gomorrah (Isa. 13:19). "Sodom" signifies the evil of the love of self, and "Gomorrah" the falsity of that love; and as the love of self does not acknowledge any truth of the church, it is said, "not a man shall dwell there, nor shall a son of man sojourn therein," "man" signifying intelligence, and "son of man," the truth of the church. [6] Because "Edom" signifies the natural man, who is in falsities from the love of self, and therefore adulterates the goods of the church, her vastation is compared to the overthrowing of Sodom and Gomorrah. In Jeremiah:      Edom shall be a desolation, as the overthrowing of Sodom and Gomorrah, no man [vir] shall dwell there, neither shall a son of man sojourn therein (Jer. 49:17, 18). In Zephaniah:      Moab shall be as Sodom, and the sons of Ammon as Gomorrah, a place abandoned to nettles, and a pit of salt, a waste forever (Zeph. 2:9). "Moab," as has been said, means the natural man, who from the love of self adulterates the goods of the church, and "the sons of Ammon" mean those who falsify the truths of the church; and as thence is the devastation of all good and truth it is said, "a place abandoned to nettles, and a pit of salt, a waste forever;" the devastation of all good is signified by "a place of nettles," and the devastation of all truth, by "a pit of salt;" like things are signified by "Sodom and Gomorrah." [7] Because "Judah" signifies celestial love, which is love to the Lord, from which is all good, and in the contrary sense diabolical love, which is the love of self, from which is all evil, the devastation of the church, which is signified by "Judah and Jerusalem," is also compared to the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah. In Isaiah:      Jerusalem hath stumbled, and Judah hath fallen; the hardening of their faces doth witness against them, and their sin is as Sodom's (Isa. 3:8, 9). Hear the word of Jehovah, ye princes of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah (Isa. 1:10). "The Word of Jehovah" means Divine good, and "the law of God" Divine truth, for where good is treated of the name "Jehovah" is used, but where truth is treated of the name "God" is used; and as Divine good, to those who are in the love of self, is evil, it is said "their sin is as Sodom's," and "hear the Word of Jehovah, ye princes of Sodom;" and as Divine truth to those who are in the evil of the love of self is falsity, it is said, "give ear to the law of God, ye people of Gomorrah." [8] In Moses:      Their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and their grapes are of the field of Gomorrah, grapes of gall, their clusters are of bitterness (Deut. 32:32). This is said of the direful falsities that exist with the posterity of Jacob, springing from the evils of the love of self. But this is explained above (n. 519). In Lamentations:      They that did eat delicacies are laid waste in the streets, they that were brought up in crimson have embraced dunghills; the iniquity of My people is become greater than the sin of Sodom, that was overturned as in a moment (Lam. 4:5, 6). This is said of those who are of the Lord's celestial kingdom and church when they are changed into the opposite, for it is celestial love that is turned into the love of self, which is a diabolical love; of those who have been so changed the above is said. What is signified by "eating delicacies," "brought up in crimson," "laid waste in the streets," and "embracing dung-hills," has been explained in the article above (n. 652). It is said that their iniquity "is become greater than the sin of Sodom," because they had the Word, from which they could know the truths and goods of heaven and the church, or of doctrine and life, and adulterated them, and this the inhabitants of Sodom could not do; for he who knows the will of the Lord and does it not, sins more than he who does not know it. Moreover, all those with whom the love of self is dominant despise the holy things of heaven and the church, and deny the Divine of the Lord; and to confirm the evils flowing forth from that love they either adulterate the Word or reject it as a writing that is holy only from having been so accepted. Those, therefore, who do this from the love of self are compared to Sodom and Gomorrah. [9] That those who are taught by the Lord respecting the truths and goods of the church, and yet reject and deny them, do worse than those in Sodom, is evident from the Lord's words respecting Capernaum, in Matthew:      Thou Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down unto hell; for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee it would have remained until this day; I say unto thee <a name="fr_298"></a><a href="#fn_298"><font size="1">653-1</font></a> that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee <a name="fr_299"></a><a href="#fn_299"><font size="1">653-2</font></a> (Matt. 11:23, 24).      For the Lord after He left Nazareth abode in Capernaum (Matt. 4:13).      And there did miracles (Matt. 8:5-14; John 4:46 to the end). Like things were said by the Lord of the cities in which the disciples preached His coming or the Gospel and were not received. As in these words in Matthew:      Whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words, when ye go forth out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet; verily I say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city (Matt. 10:14, 15; Mark 6:11; Luke 10:10-12). For no one rejects the holy things of the church and denies the Divine of the Lord more interiorly than those do who are in the love of self; those who are in the love of the world and in the evils therefrom may reject the holy things of the church, but not so interiorly, that is, from the confirmation of the heart. [10] Like things are said of the prophets and the people who adulterate the truths and goods of the Word to confirm evils and falsities. In Jeremiah:      In the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible stubbornness, in adulterating and walking in a lie, while they have strengthened the hands of the evil that no man doth return from his wickedness; they are become to Me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah (Jer. 23:14). By "prophets" here those are meant who teach the truths and goods of doctrine, and in an abstract sense, which is the genuine spiritual sense, doctrine from the Word is meant, thus also the Word in respect to doctrine, therefore "a horrible stubbornness" signifies confirmation of heart against the truths and goods of the Word; "to adulterate and walk in a lie" signifies to pervert the goods and truths of the Word; "to adulterate" signifies to pervert the goods of the Word by evils and falsities, a "lie" means falsity, and "to walk in a lie" means to live in falsities. "To strengthen the hands of the evil" signifies to confirm evils and thence their power over goods; and "no man doth return from his wickedness" signifies to persist in the evils and falsities of doctrine; therefore it is said "they are become as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah," "as Sodom" signifying to be in evils springing from the love of self, and "the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah" signifying an evil life from the falsities of doctrine. [11] The evil that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah is described as follows in Moses:      That they wished to offer violence to the angels, and were therefore smitten with blindness, so that they could not find the door where the angels were; and that therefore Jehovah caused brimstone and fire to rain upon Sodom and Gomorrah, and overthrew those cities and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which sprang up from the ground (Gen. 19:1-28). "Their wishing to offer violence to the angels" means to Divine good and Divine truth, for these are signified by "angels;" the "blindness" with which they were smitten so that they could not find the door signified the complete rejection and denial of the Divine and of the holy things of heaven and the church, even so far as to be unable to see and acknowledge anything of heaven or the church, which is signified by "not finding the door" where the angels were; "brimstone" signifies the lust of destroying the goods and truths of the church by falsities, and "fire" signifies the love of self and every evil that destroys, here the destruction of goods and truths. [12] That "Sodom and Gomorrah" mean all evils and falsities flowing forth from the love of self has been told me from heaven; for when they who are in evils from that love perish, which occurred at the time of the last judgment, there was an appearance of brimstone and fire raining down from heaven; this I also witnessed. That this would occur at the time of the Last Judgment was also predicted by the Lord in Luke:      Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot, on the day that he went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all; after the same manner shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed (Luke 17:28-30). [13] Because those who from the love of self confirm themselves by means of falsities in evils against the truths and goods of heaven and the church, completely root out with themselves every truth of doctrine and of the Word and every good of spiritual and celestial love, there takes place in them a total vastation, which is thus described in Moses:      The whole land shall be brimstone and salt, a burning; it shall not be sown, neither shall it spring forth, nor shall any herb come up thereon, according to the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, of Admah and Zeboiim (Deut. 29:23). "Brimstone" signifies the vastation of all good by lusts from evils; "salt" signifies the vastation of all truth by falsities from those lusts; "the burning of the whole land" signifies the devastation of the church by the love of self; "it shall not be sown, neither spring forth, nor shall any herb come up thereon," signifies that there will be no capacity whatever to receive the truth of the church, "herb" signifying the truth of the church when it first springs forth. And because such is the devastation of good and truth from the love of self it is said, "like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, of Admah and Zeboiim," "Admah and Zeboiim" signifying the knowledges of evil and falsity. That such things are to occur at the time of the Last Judgment is what is signified by "in the day when the Son of man is revealed." </p>

 <p>That "Egypt" here signifies the natural man separated from the spiritual, and thence falsities flowing forth from the evils of the love of self, consequently from the pride of self-intelligence, shall now be explained. For when the natural of man is separated from his spiritual, which is effected chiefly by the love of self, then from the evils of that love falsities flow forth, for every falsity is from an evil, for the falsity is the protector of the evil, and the evil of the will takes form in the understanding by means of the ideas of the thought, and these ideas are called falsities. And as the falsities that flow forth from the evils of the love of self have in them pride, for man then thinks from what is his own [proprium], therefore "Egypt" here signifies also the pride of self-intelligence. [2] But as "Egypt" signifies the natural man in both senses, that is, both when it is conjoined to the spiritual man and when it is separated from it, thus both in a good sense and in a bad sense, so the various things belonging to the natural man, which have reference in general to cognitions and knowledges, are signified by "Egypt." For the truths and falsities of the natural man are called cognitions and knowledges; but when the truths themselves have acquired life, which is effected by a life of faith, which is charity, they belong to his spiritual man. These with their affections and pleasantnesses do not appear to man's manifest sense and sight, as the cognitions and knowledges of the natural man do, for the reason that so long as a man lives in the world he thinks naturally and speaks naturally, and this a man sensibly feels and perceives by a kind of sight that belongs to his understanding. But his spiritual thought, which is conjoined to the affection of truth or of falsity, is not apparent until man has put off the natural body and put on the spiritual body, which takes place after his death, or his departure from this world and his entrance into the spiritual world; then he thinks spiritually and speaks spiritually, and not naturally as before. This takes place with every man, whether he be merely natural or also spiritual; and even with the merely natural man after death thought is spiritual, but gross and without the understanding of truth or the affection of good; for it consists of correspondent ideas, which appear to be material, and yet they are not material. But the Lord willing, more shall be said elsewhere of the spiritual thought and the speech therefrom of men in the spiritual world who are merely natural. [3] "Egypt" signifies in the Word the natural man in both senses, good and bad, consequently everything that properly belongs to the natural man, because in Egypt knowledges [scientiae] were cultivated, especially the knowledge of correspondences and representations, at the time when churches were representative. But because they made for themselves images according to correspondences, and because when from being internal they became altogether external they began to worship them with holy rites and thereby made them their idols, therefore they turned the representatives of things spiritual and celestial into things idolatrous and also into things magical, therefore in the Word "Egypt" came to signify in a bad sense, which is the contrary of the former sense, the false knowledge [scientificum] of the natural man, and also what is idolatrous and magical. [4] That such is the signification of "Egypt" can be seen from very many passages in the Word; but before we proceed to confirm this it should be known that in every man there is both an internal that sees from the light of heaven, and that is called the internal-spiritual man or the internal-spiritual mind, and an external that sees from the light of the world, and that is called the external-natural man or the external-natural mind. With every man of the church the internal must be conjoined to the external, or the internal-spiritual man to the external-natural man; and when these are conjoined the spiritual man, because it is in the light of heaven, has dominion over the natural man which is in the light of the world, and rules it as a master rules a servant, and teaches it as a teacher teaches a pupil. It is from this conjunction that a man is a man of the church and an angel. But when the natural man is not conjoined to the spiritual and subject to it, as is especially the case when the spiritual man is closed up (and it is closed up with those who deny the Divine things of the Word and of the church, for they then see nothing from the light of heaven), then the natural man is blind in respect to spiritual things, and by his rational perverts all the truths of the church, and by his ideas of them turns them with himself into falsities. This subject, namely, the conjunction of the spiritual man with the natural, and the separation of the natural man from the spiritual, is treated of in many places in the Word, especially where it treats of Egypt, since "Egypt" signifies the natural man both when conjoined to the spiritual man and when separated from it. And when the natural man separated from the spiritual is treated of there is condemnation and rejection of Egypt. [5] Because "Egypt" signifies in a broad sense the natural man, it also signifies true knowledge [scientificum] and false knowledge, for the truths and falsities that are in the natural man are called knowledges [scientifica]. And because true and false knowledges are signified by "Egypt," faith also is signified by it, since faith is of truth and truth is of faith; for this reason also faith conjoined to charity is signified by "Egypt" in a good sense, and faith separated from charity in an evil sense; for faith is conjoined to charity when the spiritual man is conjoined to the natural, and then "Egypt" signifies true knowledges; but faith is separated from charity when the natural man is separated from the spiritual, and then "Egypt" signifies false knowledge. For when the natural man is separated from the spiritual, man has no truths, and if he draws truths from the Word or from the doctrine of the church, yet he falsifies them by the ideas of his thought; therefore with such a man of the church every truth becomes a falsity. [6] Thus much on the signification of "Egypt" in the Word. In the first place, it shall be shown from the Word that "Egypt" signifies the natural man conjoined to the spiritual, or knowledge made living by the influx of spiritual light, or what is similar, faith conjoined to charity, which is in itself faith. Afterwards it shall be shown that "Egypt" signifies in the contrary sense the natural man separated from the spiritual, or knowledge not made living by any influx of spiritual life, or what is similar, faith separated from charity, which in itself is not faith. That "Egypt" signifies the natural man conjoined to the spiritual, also knowledge made alive by the influx of spiritual light, which in itself is true knowledge or the truth of the natural man, and what is similar, faith conjoined to charity, which in itself is faith, can be seen from the following passages. [7] In Isaiah:      In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak with the lip of Canaan, and that swear to Jehovah of Hosts; every one of them shall be called the city of Cheres. In that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Jehovah beside the border thereof. They shall cry unto Jehovah because of oppressions, and He shall send them a Savior and Prince. Then shall Jehovah become known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day, and shall offer the sacrifice and meal-offering. So Jehovah shall smite Egypt, smiting and healing; therefore they shall turn themselves to Jehovah, and He shall be entreated of them and shall heal them. In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt into Assyria, that Assyria may come into Egypt and Egypt into Assyria, and the Egyptians may serve with Assyria; in that day Israel shall be a third to Egypt and to Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the land that Jehovah of Hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt My people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel Mine inheritance (Isa. 19:18-25). Here "Egypt" stands for the natural man conjoined to the spiritual, thus for the nations and peoples that were outside of the church; and as these were not in truths they were natural men, but when they heard the Gospel they acknowledged the Lord, and when they had been instructed thereby in the truths of doctrine they received faith. The Lord's coming is meant by "in that day," which is here five times mentioned. "In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak with the lip of Canaan" signifies that there shall be with them many doctrinals that are in accord with the truths of the doctrine of the church itself, "five" meaning many, "cities" doctrinals, "the land of Egypt" a church of such nations, and "the lip of Canaan" the truths of doctrine of the church; "every one of them shall be called the city of Cheres" signifies the doctrine of the good of charity in every one, "city" signifying doctrine, and "Cheres," which in the Hebrew means the sun and its beams, signifying the good of charity and faith therefrom. [8] "In that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Jehovah at the border thereof" signifies the worship of the Lord at that time from the goods of charity and from the truths of faith therefrom in all things of the natural man; "an altar to Jehovah" signifying worship from the good of charity, "pillar" the worship from truths of faith, "in the midst of the land of Egypt" everywhere and in all things of the natural man, and "border" true knowledge. [9] "They shall cry unto Jehovah because of oppressions, and He shall send them a Savior and Prince" signifies their grief because of a lack of spiritual truth and of spiritual good therefrom, and the coming of the Lord, from whom they will receive these; "to cry" signifying grief, "oppressions" signifying the lack of spiritual truth and of spiritual good therefrom, and "Savior and Prince" the Lord, who is called "Savior" from the good of love, and "Prince" from the truths of faith; "then Jehovah shall become known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day" signifies the acknowledgment of the Lord and of His Divine; "and shall offer a sacrifice and meal offering" signifies the worship of the Lord according to His precepts from the Word, thus from the truths of doctrine and from the good of love; "so Jehovah shall smite Egypt, smiting and healing; therefore they shall turn themselves to Jehovah, and He shall be entreated of them and shall heal them" signifies temptations and thus conversion, and being healed of falsities by truths. [10] "In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt into Assyria, that Assyria may come into Egypt and Egypt into Assyria" signifies that then the rational shall be opened to them by true knowledges, so that man may look at knowledges that belong to the natural man rationally, and thus intelligently, "Egypt" meaning the knowledge of the natural man, and "Assyria" the rational; "in that day Israel shall be a third to Egypt and to Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the land" signifies influx into both from spiritual light; "Israel" meaning the spiritual man which has light from heaven, "Egypt," the natural man which has light from the world, and "Assyria," the rational man which is between, and which receives light from the spiritual and transmits it to the natural, which it enlightens; "that Jehovah shall bless" signifies influx from the Lord; "saying, Blessed be Egypt My people" signifies the natural man enlightened; "and Assyria the work of My hands" signifies the rational man that is rational not from self but from the Lord; "and Israel Mine inheritance" signifies the spiritual man, which is called "an inheritance" because everything spiritual is of the Lord, for it is His Divine proceeding, from which is heaven and the church. Without the spiritual sense who could understand these prophecies? [11] In Micah:      This is the day in which they shall come unto thee even from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and thus from Egypt even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain (Mic. 7:12). This is said of the establishment of the church by the Lord with the Gentiles, and these words describe the extension of that church from one end to the other. One end of the land of Canaan was the river Euphrates and the other was the river of Egypt. The extension of truth from one end to the other is signified by "from sea to sea," and the extension of good from one end to the other by "from mountain to mountain." [12] That the land of Canaan, which signifies the church, extended from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, the river of Assyria, appears in Moses:      In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed I will give this land, from the river of Egypt even to the great river, the river Euphrates (Gen. 15:18). And in the first book of Kings:      Solomon was ruler over all kingdoms from the river Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, and even to the lands of Egypt (1 Kings 4:21). For the church, which in itself is spiritual, has its boundaries in the natural man, that is, in its rational and knowing faculties, for the rational is in the interior natural man, for it is its understanding; in it also is the knowing faculty; and the rational is born by means of knowledges, for in these it sees its conclusions as in a mirror, and confirms itself by them, but yet from the spiritual; without this man has no rational, nor has he any true knowing faculty, but in place of the rational he has an ability to reason, and in place of a true knowing faculty he has a false knowing faculty; so these two constitute the boundaries of the spiritual church, which is signified by "the land of Canaan." [13] In Ezekiel:      Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude, Whom art thou like in thy greatness? Behold Asshur, a cedar in Lebanon, beautiful in branch and with shady boughs, and lofty in stature, and its top was among the interwoven boughs; the waters made it grow, the deep made it exalted, so that with its rivers it went about the plant and sent out conduits unto all the trees of the field, whence its stature became lofty, and its branches became long, because of the many waters which it sent out. In its branches all the birds of the heavens built their nests, and under its branches every beast of the field has brought forth, and in its shade dwelt all great nations; it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches, for its root was by many waters. The cedars in the garden of God have not hidden it; the fir trees were not equal to its branches, nor was any tree in the garden of God equal to it in its beauty; they have made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches, and all the trees of Eden which are in the garden of God envied it (Ezek. 31:2-9). It is because "Pharaoh king of Egypt" signifies the understanding of the natural man, which is born and formed out of true knowledges rationally seen, that he is here called "Asshur," which signified the rational, and is described by a cedar and its height, and the length and multitude of its branches, and this is because the "cedar" signifies in the Word the rational. (But most of this passage may be seen explained above, n. 650.)  Because the rational is such in respect to the intellectual, and the natural is such in respect to true knowledges it is said that "the cedars in the garden of God did not hide it, and the fir trees were not equal to its branches, nor was any tree in the garden of God equal to it in beauty;" "the garden of God" signifying the intelligence which the man of the church has who is in genuine truths, "the cedar," his rational which is from a spiritual origin, "the fir tree," the perceptive faculty of the natural man, "beauty," the affection of truth and the consequent intelligence; "they have made it beautiful by the multitude of branches" signifies the abundance of true knowledges rationally perceived; "all the trees of Eden which are in the garden of God envied it" signifies perceptions of truth from celestial good, whence is wisdom, "trees" where the celestial man is treated of signifying perceptions, and where the spiritual man is treated of cognitions, and "Eden in the garden of God" signifying the wisdom which is from the good of love. That Pharaoh and Egypt are here meant and described by "Asshur" and the "cedar" can be seen also from the last verse of this chapter, where it is said, "This is Pharaoh and all his multitude." As all the intelligence and wisdom of the spiritual man closes into the natural mind, and there renders itself visible, so in the passage above cited Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is compared to "a cedar in the garden of God," since "Pharaoh" signifies the intellectual which is in the natural man, born and formed out of true knowledges; consequently it is the land of Egypt that is meant by "the garden of God," like as in Moses:      Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the plain of Jordan, that the whole of it was well watered like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt in coming to Zoar (Gen. 13:10). [14] The natural man in respect to its understanding, as described above in Ezekiel, is also described by Sennacherib, the chief captain of the king of Assyria, but by his blasphemies, as follows:      By the hand of thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, where I will cut down the stature of the cedars thereof, the choice of the fir trees thereof, and I will come to the lodging place of his end, the wood of his cultivated field. I have digged and drunk strange waters, and I will dry up with the sole of my footsteps all the rivers of Egypt (2 Kings 19:23, 24). Similar things are signified here as in the passage cited above, namely, the rational things of the men of the church formed out of true knowledges, and enlightened from the Divine spiritual, and yet the king of Assyria (signifying here a perverted rational) wished to destroy these, for he made war upon Hezekiah, king of Judah; but because he blasphemed these, and threatened to destroy all things of the church from first to last, which church is formed with man in his rational and his natural from the spiritual, therefore in that night a hundred and eighty-five thousand were smitten in his camp by the angel of Jehovah (verse 35). Here the "multitude of chariots" of the king of Assyria signifies the falsities of doctrine; "the height of the mountains, the sides of Lebanon," which he wished to ascend, signify all the goods and truths of the church, which he wished to destroy; "the stature of the cedars and the choice of the fir trees" which he wished to cut down signify rational and natural truths in respect to perception; "the wood of the cultivated field" signifies knowledges; "the rivers of Egypt which he would dry up with the sole of his footsteps" signify the knowledge of the natural man from a spiritual origin, which he would annihilate and blot out by means of his sensual, "the sole of the footsteps" of the king of Assyria meaning the sensual and reasoning therefrom, which is from mere fallacies, and "the rivers of Egypt" meaning the intelligence of the natural man from knowledges that are from a spiritual origin, when these are applied to confirm the truths of the church, which are spiritual. [15] Every man with whom the church is to be implanted must first be instructed in knowledges, for unless the natural man is instructed by means of knowledges, which are also various experiences from worldly things and associations, a man cannot become rational; and if he does not become rational he cannot become spiritual; for the rational of man is conjoined on one side to the spiritual, that is, to heaven, and on the other side to the natural, that is, to the world. For this reason, and because a church was to be instituted with the sons of Israel therefore the natural man with them was first to be instructed, that is, in truths naturally and also scientifically understood. And in order that this might be represented and signified it came to pass that Abraham, whose posterity was to represent the church, and who was himself the head of it:      Sojourned in Egypt with his wife, and abode there for a time (Gen. 12:10, et seq.); and afterwards:      Jacob with his sons, who were then called the sons of Israel, went down by command into Egypt, and dwelt in Goshen, which was the best of the lands of Egypt, and there remained a long time (Gen. 46, et seq.) This was done because man must be instructed in truths scientifically and naturally before he is instructed spiritually. [16] For every man by truths scientifically and naturally understood acquires for himself a rational into which the spiritual can flow in and operate; for through the rational which belongs to his understanding man receives the light of heaven, which is spiritual light, and through the rational enlightened by the spiritual he surveys cognitions and knowledges, selecting from them such as are in accord with the genuine truths and goods of heaven and the church, which are spiritual, and rejecting those that are not; thus it is that man lays the foundation of the church in himself. This is why it is said of Abraham and Jacob that it was because of the famine in the land of Canaan that they went down into Egypt to sojourn there; it was "because of the famine," since "famine" signifies a lack of the knowledges (cognitiones) of good and truth, together with a desire for them, and "to sojourn" in the Word signifies to be instructed. [17] This makes evident what is meant by these words in David:      Thou hast caused a vine to go forth out of Egypt, thou hast driven out the nations and planted it, thou hast cleared a place before it, and hast caused its roots to be inrooted so that it filled the land; thou hast sent out its shoots unto the sea and its branches to the river (Ps. 80:8, 9, 11). "A vine out of Egypt" signifies the church, which was represented by the sons of Israel; "to drive out the nations" signifies to drive out the evils of the natural man, which are driven out by means of truths; "to plant it, to clear a place before it, and to cause its roots to be inrooted" signifies instruction according to order, that is, first to imbue with cognitions and knowledges, then to be as in the wilderness and be tempted, and afterwards to be brought into the land of Canaan, that is, into the church; these things are signified in their order by "Thou hast planted it, thou hast cleared a place before it, thou hast caused its roots to be inrooted, so that it filled the earth;" "to send out its shoots unto the sea" signifies the increase of intelligence and the extension even to the ultimates of the good and truth of the church; and "to send out branches unto the river" signifies unto the rational. (That the "river," namely, the Euphrates, signifies the rational, see above, n. 569.) [18] In Hosea:      When Israel was a child then I loved him, and called My son out of Egypt (Hos. 11:1). "Israel" signifies in the spiritual sense the church, and in the highest sense the Lord, who as He is the all of heaven is also the all of the church. And as the sons of Israel were to represent the church, and it was according to Divine order that they should first be instructed in such things as would be serviceable to the rational and through this to the spiritual, they first sojourned in Egypt, and afterwards were led into the wilderness that they might undergo temptations, and that through these the natural man might be subdued; for man does not become rational until empty and false knowledges [scientifica] are removed, and the natural man is thus purified, which is effected mainly by temptations. [19] Because "Israel" in the highest sense means the Lord, the Lord Himself when He was an infant was carried down into Egypt, according to these words in Matthew:      An angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, take the child and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I tell thee. And he arose and took the child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, Out of Egypt have I called My son (Matt. 2:13-15). This, again, signifies the first instruction of the Lord, for the Lord was instructed like another man, but by virtue of His Divine He received all things more intelligently and wisely than others. But this departure into Egypt was merely a representation of instruction; for as all the representatives of the Jewish and Israelitish church looked to Him, so He also represented them in Himself and completely observed them, thus fulfilling all things of the law. Since representatives were the ultimates of heaven and the church, and all prior things, which are things rational, spiritual, and celestial, enter into ultimates and are in them, so through these the Lord was in ultimates; and as all strength is in ultimates, so it was from firsts through ultimates that He subjugated all the hells, and reduced to order all things in the heavens. This is why the whole life of the Lord in the world was representative, even also all things related in the Gospels respecting His passion, which represented the quality of the church then in its contrariety to the Divine and to all the goods and truths of heaven and the church. [20] This makes evident what is meant by "Egypt," where the church to be established by the Lord is treated of in the following passages. In Isaiah: Thus said Jehovah, The labor of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall pass over unto Thee, and they shall be Thine; they shall go after Thee, in bonds shall they pass over; so they shall bow themselves down towards Thee, they shall pray towards Thee; only in Thee is God, and there is no God beside (Isa. 45:14). This is said of the Lord, of whom this whole chapter treats. "The labor of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush and of the Sabeans" signifies the delight of natural love from the acquisition of the knowledges of truth and good; the knowledges themselves are signified by the "Sabeans," who are called "men of stature" from good, for "stature" (length) signifies good and its quality, and "breadth" truth and its quality; that such will come to the church and acknowledge and worship the Lord is signified by "they shall pass over unto Thee, they shall be Thine, they shall bow themselves down towards Thee;" that the natural man with them will serve the spiritual, and thus the Lord, is signified by "in bonds shall they pass over," for those are said "to come in bonds" in whom the cupidities pertaining to the natural man are restrained; that they will acknowledge the Lord alone to be God is meant by "they shall pray towards Him; only in Him is God, and there is no God beside." [21] In David:      Those that are fat shall come out of Egypt, Cush shall hasten her hands unto God; sing to God, O ye kingdoms of the earth, sing psalms unto the Lord (Ps. 68:31, 32). "Those that are fat out of Egypt" signify the Gentiles who are in the affection of knowing truths, and "Cush" signifies those who imbibe truths from the delight of the natural man; that "Cush" has this signification can be seen from other passages in the Word where Cush is mentioned (as in Gen. 2:13; Zeph. 3:5, 9, 10; Dan. 11:43); that the nations will receive the truths and goods of heaven and the church from the Lord is signified by "the kingdoms of the earth shall sing to God and shall sing psalms unto the Lord." [22] In Hosea:      With honor shall they come, as a bird out of Egypt and as a dove from the land of Assyria, and I will make them to dwell upon their houses (Hos. 11:11). This, too, is said of the Lord as about to establish a church with the Gentiles; it is said "as a bird out of Egypt," because a "bird" signifies thoughts from true knowledges; and it is said "as a dove from the land of Assyria," because a "dove" signifies rational good from spiritual good, "Assyria" signifying the rational itself; "to make them to dwell upon their houses" signifies the interiors of a mind formed by truths from good, and thus those who are safe from the infestation of the falsities of evil. [23] In Isaiah:      It shall come to pass in that day that Jehovah shall beat out from the ear of grain of the river even unto the brook of Egypt; and ye shall be collected one to another, O sons of Israel; moreover it shall come to pass in that day that the great horn shall sound, and the perishing in the land of Assyria shall come, and the outcasts from <a name="fr_300"></a><a href="#fn_300"><font size="1">654-1</font></a> the land of Egypt, and shall bow down to Jehovah in the mountain of holiness, in Jerusalem (Isa. 27:12, 13). "In that day" signifies the coming of the Lord; "from the ear of grain of the river even unto the brook of Egypt, which Jehovah shall beat out," signifies all rational truth and true knowledge that will be serviceable to the spiritual; it is said the "ear of grain" because that is what contains the grain, which signifies the truth and good that is serviceable to the spiritual man for nourishment. To be called by the Lord to the church is signified by "in that day the great horn shall sound;" that those will come to the church who would otherwise have perished through reasonings from knowledges applied to confirm falsities is signified by "the perishing in the land of Assyria shall come, and the outcasts from the land of Egypt;" that they will worship the Lord, and that out of them a church will arise, is signified by "they shall bow down to Jehovah in the mountain of holiness, in Jerusalem," "the mountain of holiness" signifying the church in respect to the good of life, and "Jerusalem" the church in respect to the truth of doctrine. These things are said of the sons of Israel who were made captives in Assyria and in Egypt; but "the sons of Israel" here and elsewhere mean the Gentiles who were to constitute the church, and "their captivity" in Assyria and in Egypt signifies the spiritual captivity  which a man is in from the falsities of religion. [24] In Zechariah:      I will bring them back out of the land of Egypt, and I will gather them together out of Assyria, and I will lead them to the land of Gilead and Lebanon. He shall pass through the sea of distress, but he shall smite the waves in the sea, and the pride of Asshur shall be cast down, and the staff of Egypt depart away (Zech. 10:10, 11). This, too, treats of the restoration of the church by the Lord. "To bring back out of the land of Egypt, and to gather together out of Assyria" has a similar signification as above in Isaiah where the explanation is given; "the land of Gilead and Lebanon" signifies the goods and truths of the church in the natural man; "he shall pass through the sea of distress, but shall smite the waves in the sea, and the pride of Asshur shall be cast down, and the staff of Egypt depart away" signifies that the evils and falsities of the natural man and the reasonings from knowledges [scientifica] that confirm them shall be dispersed; "to pass through the sea of distress" signifying temptations, the "waves" falsities and evils, "the pride of Asshur" signifies reasonings from the pride of self-intelligence, and "the staff of Egypt" knowledge confirming. [25] In Ezekiel:      At the end of forty years I will gather Egypt together from the peoples whither they were scattered, and I will bring them back into the land of Pathros, upon the land of their traffic, that they may be there a lowly kingdom, that thou lift not thyself up anymore over the nations; and I will diminish them that they have not dominion among the nations (Ezek. 29:13-16).  "Egypt" here signifies the church with those who are in a moral life from natural light, the temptations that such must endure that the natural man may not rule over the spiritual is signified by "forty years;" the knowledges by which they have confirmed falsities are signified by "Egypt" which Jehovah "will gather together from the peoples whither they were scattered;" their enlightenment by the knowledges of truth is signified by "I will bring them back upon the land of Pathros," which is called "the land of their traffic" from the knowledges that such will acquire for themselves, for "to traffic" signifies to acquire and communicate knowledges; that the knowledges [scientifica] of the natural man shall not be puffed up, and in their elation do evil to the truths and goods of the church and rule over them, is signified by "they shall be a lowly kingdom, that thou lift not thyself up anymore over the nations, and I will diminish them that they may not have dominion over the nations;" the "nations" first mentioned signify the truths of the church, and the "nations" last mentioned its goods. [26] In Zechariah:      Everyone remaining of all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the king, Jehovah of Hosts, and to celebrate the feast of tabernacles; whoso goeth not up, upon them there shall be no rain; and if the family of Egypt go not up and come not, neither be with them, there shall be the plague with which Jehovah will smite the nations (Zech. 14:16-18). This also treats of the Lord's coming, and of the establishment of a church by Him. "The king, Jehovah of Hosts," whom they shall worship, means the Lord; "the feast of tabernacles" signifies the implantation of good by means of truths; that those who do not come to His church will have no influx of truth and good from the Lord is signified by "whoso goeth not up, upon them there shall be no rain;" that such as are in natural light from mere knowledges [scientifica], and in whom good cannot be implanted by means of truths, will be in evils and falsities of every kind, is signified by "if the family of Egypt go not up there shall be the plague with which Jehovah will smite the nations." [27] In Isaiah:      I am Jehovah thy God, the Holy one of Israel, thy Savior; I have given Egypt as thy expiation, Cush and Seba in place of thee; I will give a man in place of thee, and a people for thy soul (Isa. 43:3, 4). This, again, is said of the Lord and the redemption of those who acknowledge Him and from affection receive truths from Him; redemption is meant by "expiation" and "in place of thee" and "for thy soul;" the natural affection of knowing truths that is from spiritual affection is signified by "Egypt," "Cush," and "Seba;" a "man" signifies their intelligence therefrom, and a "people" a church from them. [28] Since "Egypt" signifies the natural man, and all the intelligence of the spiritual man has its limit and foundation in the natural man and in his cognitions and knowledges, so without these man is not intelligent and wise and not even rational, for the spiritual man must act as one with the natural man, as cause with effect, and it acts as one by correspondences; this is why in ancient times, when there was a representative church also in Egypt:      The king of Egypt, or Pharaoh, was called the son of the wise, and the son of the kings of olden time (Isa. 19:11); also Egypt was called the cornerstone of the tribes (verse 13), for the "tribes" signify all the truths and goods of the church in the complex, and the "cornerstone" signifies their foundation. [29] Therefore also it is said of Solomon, by whom the Lord in relation to His celestial kingdom and His spiritual kingdom was represented,      That his wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the sons of the East and all the wisdom of the Egyptians (1 Kings 4:30),  "the sons of the East" meaning all who at that time were in the knowledges [cognitiones] of truth and good, and through these were made wise, and the "Egyptians" all who were learned in knowledges [scientiae], especially in the knowledge of correspondences, and were consequently intelligent. This is why the knowledges [scientiae] of the Egyptians are called "the hidden things of gold and silver" and "desirable things" in Daniel:      The king of the north shall put forth his hands over the lands, and the land of Egypt shall not escape, for he shall rule over the hidden things of gold and silver, and over all the desirable things of Egypt (Dan. 11:42, 43). [30] For this reason again the sons of Israel, when they went out of Egypt, were commanded:      To borrow of the Egyptians vessels of gold and vessels of silver, and raiment, which they took away out of Egypt (Exod. 12:35, 36). "Vessels of gold and silver" and "raiment" signify the knowledges and cognitions of truth and good which were taken away from Egypt, because the Egyptians applied them to confirm evils and falsities, and turned them into things idolatrous and magical; consequently when the Egyptians were deprived of them and thus became merely natural they were shortly afterwards drowned in the Sea Suph. This represented the lot of those who abuse knowledges [scientiae] to confirm evils and falsities; for after death they are deprived of all knowledge [cognitio] of truth and good, and when these have been taken away they are cast down into hell, and this was represented by the drowning of the Egyptians in the Sea Suph. [31] Because Egypt signifies knowledge [scientia], from which man has intelligence, where Tyre is treated of it is said that:      Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, which was to thee for a sign (Ezek. 27:7). "Tyre" signifies the knowledges of truth, and "fine linen with broidered work from Egypt" signifies knowledge [scientificum] from spiritual truth, "broidered work" meaning knowledge, and "fine linen" spiritual truth; a "sail" and a "sign" signify manifestation, for spiritual truths are made manifest by means of knowledges [scientiae], for it is through these that they appear to the sight and perception of the natural man. [32] Because all knowledges [scientifica] that are serviceable to the spiritual man for the confirming of truths are from the Lord, that is, all application of them to confirm the truths and goods of heaven and the church so:      Joseph was carried down into Egypt, and was there made ruler over the whole land (Gen. 41). For "Joseph" in the highest sense means the Lord in relation to the Divine spiritual, and thence also the truth of doctrine, which is based upon the knowledges [scientifica] of the natural man (as has been said above, n. 448); and as the natural man, or the natural of man, must be subordinate to the spiritual, that it may be serviceable in confirming and executing the decisions of the spiritual man, therefore Joseph, that this dominion might be represented, was made ruler over Egypt, and under his direction Egypt had crops or corn in abundance, so that the neighboring countries were supplied therefrom, even the land of Canaan itself. [33] Because Solomon represented the Lord in relation to both the celestial and the spiritual kingdoms, and as all who are of both these kingdoms are in intelligence and wisdom through the knowledges [cognitiones] of truth and good and knowledges [scientifica] that confirm these, therefore:      Solomon took the daughter of Pharaoh to wife, and brought her into the city of David (1 Kings 3:1);      And afterwards he built for the daughter of Pharaoh a house beside the porch (1 Kings 7:8); By this also was represented that knowledge [scientia], upon which all intelligence and wisdom is based, is signified by "Egypt" in a good sense. And as every man of the church has a spiritual, a rational, and a natural, therefore Solomon built three houses, the house of God or the temple to stand for the spiritual, the house of the forest of Lebanon for the rational (for a "cedar" and thence "Lebanon" signifies the rational), and the house of the daughter of Pharaoh for the natural. These arcana are not apparent in the historical sense of the Word, but still they lie concealed in its spiritual sense. [34] Thus far the signification of "Egypt" in a good sense has been explained; now it follows that also the signification of "Egypt" in an evil or contrary sense shall be explained. In that sense "Egypt" signifies the natural man separated from the spiritual, or true knowledge [verum scientificum] separated from spiritual good, which in itself is falsity; or what is the same, faith separated from charity, which in itself is not faith. For man is born natural, and at first acquires knowledges [scientifica] from his teacher and parent, as also from the reading of books, and at the same time from his life in the world; and unless man becomes spiritual, that is, is born anew, the knowledges [scientifica] that he has acquired he applies to justify the appetites and pleasures of the natural man, in a word, its loves, which are all contrary to Divine order; and this natural man is what is signified by "Egypt" in the contrary sense, as can be seen from the following passages. [35] In Ezekiel:      Because Pharaoh is lofty in stature, and hath set his top among the interwoven boughs, and his heart is exalted in his loftiness, I will give him into the hand of the strong one of the nations; according to his wickedness I have driven him out, therefore strangers shall cut him off, the violent of the nations, and they shall cast him down; upon the mountains and the valleys are his branches fallen; whence all peoples of the earth have gone down from his shadow and have deserted him; upon his ruin every bird of the heavens shall dwell, and every wild beast of the field shall be upon his branches; all shall be delivered up to death, unto the lower earth, in the midst of the sons of man, unto them that go down into the pit. In the day when he shall go down into hell I will cover the abyss for him, and I will restrain the rivers thereof, that the great waters may be held back; and I will make Lebanon black for him, and all the trees of the field shall faint for him. To whom art thou thus become like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? when thou shalt be brought down with the trees of Eden into the lower earth, and shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh, and all his multitude (Ezek. 31:10-18). "Pharaoh" has a similar signification as "Egypt," namely, the natural man in respect to knowledge [scientia] and intelligence therefrom. The pride of self-intelligence from knowledge is meant by "he is lofty in stature, and hath set his top among the interwoven boughs, and his heart is exalted in his loftiness;" "the interwoven boughs" signify the knowledges [scientifica] of the natural man. That knowledges were applied to justify the cupidities of evil and falsity is signified by "I will give him into the hand of the strong one of the nations," "the strong one of the nations" signifying the falsity of evil. That the falsities of evil will destroy him is signified by "strangers shall cut him off, the violent of the nations shall cast him down." [36] That all true knowledges and rational truths were scattered by evils and falsities is signified by "upon the mountains and the valleys are his branches fallen;" that all truths of the church were driven away is signified by "all the peoples of the earth have gone down from his shadow and have deserted him;" that the thoughts and affections of falsity have taken their place is signified by "upon his ruin every bird of the heavens shall dwell, and every wild beast of the field shall be upon his branches;" that all things have become damned and infernal is signified by "all shall be delivered up to death, unto the lower earth, in the midst of the sons of man, unto them that go down into the pit," "sons of man" meaning those who are in self-intelligence, and "pit" meaning where those are who are in the falsities of doctrine; preventing the entrance of any true knowledges or rational truths is signified by "I will cover the abyss for him, and I will restrain the rivers thereof;" also of spiritual truths is signified by "that the great waters may be held back;" that he shall have no rational is signified by "I will make Lebanon black for him." [37] That he shall have no knowledges of truth pertaining to the church is signified by "all the trees of the field shall faint for him;" that he shall no longer have any understanding of truth or any perception of the knowledges of good, because of the pride of self-intelligence, is signified by "to whom art thou become like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden?" because the knowledges of good have been wholly perverted by the application to evil is signified by "when thou shalt be brought down with the trees of Eden into the lower earth," the "trees of Eden" meaning the knowledges of good from the Word, which the natural man has perverted and falsified; that they shall be among those in hell who, by a faith separated from a life of charity have extinguished in themselves all truth, is signified by "when thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword," "slain by the sword" meaning in the Word those who have extinguished truths in themselves by means of falsities. That all these things are said of the natural man deprived of light from the spiritual man is signified by "this is Pharaoh and all his multitude," "Pharaoh" meaning the natural man, and "his multitude" all knowledges therein. [38] In the same:      Son of man, prophesy and say, Howl ye! alas the day! a day of cloud, it shall be the time of the nations, in which a sword shall come into Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be overthrown; and they that uphold Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her strength shall come down, from the tower of Seveneh they shall fall in it by the sword; then shall they be desolate in the midst of the lands that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are desolate; that they may know that I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt that all her helpers may be broken. I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, he and his people with him, the violent of the nations, who shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw out their sword against Egypt, to fill the land with the slain. Then will I make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil ones, and I will make the land a waste and the fullness thereof, by the hand of strangers; there shall no more be a prince out of the land of Egypt. I will set a fire in Egypt, and I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and I will disperse them into the lands (Ezek. 30:1 to end). This is an abstract of this chapter; it is a lamentation over the vastation of the church by falsities that favor the evils from the natural man; for all evils and all falsities therefrom that pervert and destroy the truths and goods of the church flow forth from the natural man separated from the spiritual. Lamentation over that vastation is signified by "howl ye! alas the day! a day of cloud, it shall be the time of the nations," "a day of cloud" meaning the state of the church from truths not understood, consequently from falsities; "the time of the nations" the state of the church from evils; that falsity will destroy the entire natural man and all things therein by application to evils, is signified by "a sword shall come into Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be overthrown." [39] That there will be no confirmations and corroborations of truth by the knowledges of the natural man is signified by "they that uphold Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her strength shall come down," that falsities will destroy the understanding of truth is signified by "from the tower of Seveneh they shall fall in it by the sword;" that all things of the church and all things of the doctrine of the church will perish is signified by "then shall they be desolate in the midst of the lands that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are desolate;" the evil cupidities from the natural man are signified by the "fire" that Jehovah will set in Egypt; that there will no longer be any confirmations of truth from the natural man is signified by "that all her helpers may be broken;" that the cupidities of the love of self and the falsities therefrom will devastate is signified by "the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, he and his people." [40] That thus the church will be devastated by the falsities of evil that will do violence to the goods of charity and the truths of faith is signified by "the violent of the nations shall be brought in to destroy the land, and shall draw their sword against Egypt, to fill the land with the slain;" that thus truth is not understood is signified by "I will make the rivers dry;" since instead of good there is evil, and instead of truth falsity in the church, is signified by "I will sell the land into the hand of evil ones, and I will make the land a waste and the fullness thereof by the hand of strangers;" that there will be no truth as head, and consequently no truth of life from the Lord, is signified by "there shall no more be a prince out of the land of Egypt;" that nothing but evils from the love of self will occupy the natural man is signified by "I will set a fire in Egypt, and I will scatter Egypt among the nations;" that thus all things of the church will be dissipated is signified by "I will disperse them into the lands." [41] In Isaiah:      The prophecy of the beasts of the south, In a land of distress and of anguish; the young lion and the old lion are before them, the viper and the fiery flying serpent; they carry their wealth upon the shoulder of asses, and their treasures upon the back of camels, unto a people that they shall not profit; and Egypt, a vanity and emptiness, shall be their help (Isa. 30:6, 7).  "Beasts of the south" signify the cupidities that are from the natural man extinguishing the light which the man of the church should have from the Word; "a land of distress and of anguish" signifies a church where there will be no good of charity nor truth of faith; "the young lion and the old lion" that are before them signify the power of the falsity that destroys the truth and good of the church; "the viper and fiery flying serpent" signify the sensual craftily and subtly reasoning; "they carry their wealth upon the shoulder of asses, and their treasures upon the back of camels" signifies the knowledges of the sensual and natural man, from which they draw all conclusions, "wealth" and "treasures" meaning the knowledges [cognitiones] of truth and good from the Word, but here false knowledges [scientifica] because from self-intelligence; "asses" mean the things of the sensual man, and "camels" the things of the natural; "Egypt, which is a vanity and emptiness," signifies both the sensual and the natural, which regarded in themselves are without good and without truths. [42] In the same:      Woe to them that go down into Egypt for help, and stay on horses, and trust in the chariot because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very mighty, but they have no respect unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek after Jehovah. For Egypt is man and not God, and his horses are flesh and not spirit (Isa. 31:1, 3). This describes the state of those who wish to be wise in the things of heaven and the church from themselves, thus from self-intelligence and not from the Lord; and as such are merely natural, and thus take everything from the fallacies of the senses, and from knowledges wrongly applied, and pervert and falsify the truths and goods of the church, therefore it is said of them, "Woe to them that go down into Egypt for help, and have no respect unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek after Jehovah;" fanciful things from the fallacies of the senses are signified by "the horses of Egypt" on which they stay; the falsities of doctrine confirmed by knowledges in great abundance are signified by "they trust in the chariot because they are many;" and reasonings therefrom with which they assault truths are signified by the "horsemen" in whom they trust because they are very mighty; that the natural man has no understanding of Divine things from himself is signified by "Egypt is man and not God;" that his intelligence is from what is his own, in which there is no life, is signified by "his horses are flesh and not spirit," "the horses of Egypt" meaning fanciful things, which in themselves are dead because they are fallacies; "flesh" means what is man's own, and "spirit" life from the Lord. 654h. [43] In Jeremiah:      Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon smote. Who is this that cometh up like a stream, whose waters are tossed like the rivers? Egypt cometh up like a stream, and his waters are tossed like rivers; for he saith, I will come up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and those that dwell in it. Go up ye horses, and rage ye chariots, and go forth ye mighty ones. The sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall be made drunk with their blood. Go up to Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt; in vain hast thou multiplied medicines, there is no cure for thee (Jer. 46:2, 7-11, and also 14-26). It is clear from these particulars, when viewed in the spiritual sense, that "Egypt" here signifies the natural man with its knowledges [scientifica] when it is separated from the spiritual, which is effected by the pride of self-intelligence, which destroys the truths and goods of the church by reasonings from knowledges [scientifica]. For "the army of the king of Egypt which was by the river Euphrates" signifies knowledges [scientifica] falsely applied and reasonings from them; "which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon smote" signifies the destruction of these by the pride of self-intelligence; "Who is this that cometh up like a stream, whose waters are tossed like the rivers?" signifies self-intelligence and its falsities endeavoring to destroy the truths of the church; "Egypt cometh up like a stream, and his waters are tossed like rivers" signifies the natural man reasoning from himself, or from what is his own [proprium], against the truths of the church; "for he said, I will come up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and those that dwell in it," signifies the effort and desire to destroy the church and the truths and goods of its doctrine; "go up ye horses, and rage ye chariots, and go forth ye mighty ones," signifies by fanciful things from fallacies, and by the falsities of doctrine confirmed by knowledges [scientifica] which makes them appear to themselves to be strong. [44] "The sword shall devour and shall be satiate, and shall be made drunk with their blood," signifies the entire destruction of the natural man by falsities and falsifications of truth; "go up to Gilead, and take balm, O daughter of Egypt," signifies the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, and reasoning and protection therefrom; for "Gilead" signifies reasoning from the sense of the letter of the Word by which falsities are confirmed, since Gilead was not far from the Euphrates, and wax, balm, and myrrh were from it, and it became the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh and the half tribe of Gad (Gen. 31:21; 37:25; Num. 32:29; Josh. 13:25). Thence "Gilead" signifies, besides other things, reasonings from the sense of the letter of the Word; "balm" signifies the application to falsity and thence the confirmation of falsity, and "the daughter of Egypt" the affection of falsity which belongs to such a church. "In vain hast thou multiplied medicines, there is no cure for thee," signifies that such things, however great their abundance, afford no help, since truths themselves are thereby falsified. [45] In Moses:      The Egyptians pursued the sons of Israel, and came after them, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots and his horsemen, into the midst of the sea. But Jehovah looking forth unto the camp of the Egyptians, discomfited them, and took off the wheel of their chariots; and the waters returned and covered the chariots and horsemen, with the whole army of Pharaoh (Exod. 14:23-25, 28; 15:19, 21). "The horses of Pharaoh" signify fanciful things, since they are fallacies, which are knowledges from a perverted understanding applied to confirm falsities; "his chariots" signify the doctrinals of falsity, and "horsemen" the reasonings therefrom; "the wheel of the chariots" signifies the ability to reason. (But these things are explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 8208-8219, 8332-8335, 8343.) [46] Because of this signification of "the horses of Egypt" it was commanded through Moses, that:      If the people desire a king, a king should be set over them whom Jehovah God should choose out of the midst of the sons of Israel; a man that is an alien who is not thy brother shall not be set over them. Only he shall not multiply to himself horses, nor shall he bring back the people into Egypt that he may multiply horses; for Jehovah hath said to you, You shall not return by this way anymore; neither shall he multiply to himself wives, that his heart turn not away; neither shall he multiply exceedingly to himself silver and gold (Deut. 17:15-17). What these directions to a king signify no one can see who does not know what is signified in the spiritual sense by a "king," by the "sons of Israel," by "Egypt and its horses," also by "wives," and by "silver and gold." A "king" signifies truth from good; "Egypt" the natural man; "his horses" knowledges; "wives" the affections of truth and good; and "silver and gold" the truths and goods of the church, and in the contrary sense its falsities and evils; and as a "king" signifies truth from good, and the "sons of Israel" the church from those who are in truths from good, it is said that "if the people desire, a king shall be set over them whom Jehovah God shall choose out of the midst of the sons of Israel; a man that is an alien who is not thy brother shall not be set over them," "a man that is an alien who is not a brother" signifying a religious principle not agreeing, as also falsity in which there is no good. [47] As "Egypt" signifies the natural man, and "horses" false knowledges, which are fanciful, therefore it is said "only he shall not multiply to himself horses, nor shall he bring back the people into Egypt that he may multiply horses." As "wives" signify the affections of truth and good, which become the affections of evil and falsity when one man has several wives, it is said "neither shall he multiply to himself wives that his heart turn not away." And as "silver and gold" signify the truths and goods of the church, but here falsities and evils, when they are regarded only from the natural man, it is said, "neither shall he multiply exceedingly to himself silver and gold." But to come nearer to the point, these words prescribe that truth shall not rule over good, as is done when the natural man rules over the spiritual; that this must not be done is signified by "he shall not bring back the people into Egypt that he may thereby multiply horses, nor take many wives," for "wife and husband" signify the affection of good corresponding to the affection of truth, which correspondence exists in the marriage of a man with one wife, but not with many. Other like things are prescribed in the law of the king (1 Sam. 8:10-18). Because Solomon not only procured for himself horses from Egypt, but also multiplied wives, and heaped up silver and gold, he became an idolater, and after his death the kingdom was divided. [48] In Isaiah:      The prophecy concerning Egypt: Jehovah rideth upon a light cloud, and cometh into Egypt; therefore the idols of Egypt shall be in commotion before Him, and the heart of the Egyptian shall melt in the midst of him. I will shut up Egypt in the hand of a hard lord, and a strong king shall rule over them. Then the waters shall fail in the sea, and the river shall dry up and become dry, and the streams shall recede, and the rivers of Egypt shall be dried up, the reed and the flag shall wither. Therefore the fishers shall moan, and all they that cast the hook into the streams shall mourn, and they that spread the net upon the faces of the waters shall languish. Moreover, they that make the flax of silks, and the weavers of curtains, shall be ashamed. How say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of the kings of olden time? Where now are thy wise men? Let them tell; come now, and they shall know what Jehovah hath counseled respecting Egypt. The princes of Zoan have become fools, the princes of Noph are carried away, and they have seduced Egypt, the cornerstone of her tribes; there shall be no work for Egypt that may make head or tail, branch or rush (Isa. 19:1-17). From all this also regarded in its spiritual sense it can be seen that "Egypt" signifies the natural of man separated from his spiritual; and man becomes merely natural when in his life he has regard to himself and to the world and not to the Lord; thence he is in the pride of self-intelligence, which is common with the learned, and this perverts the rational in them, and closes up the spiritual mind. That it may be known that the natural man is signified by "Egypt," self-intelligence by "its river," and falsities by "the waters of the river of Egypt," I will explain in series the summary of this chapter here cited. "Jehovah rideth upon a light cloud, and cometh into Egypt," signifies the visitation of the natural man from Divine truth spiritual-natural, for visitation is examination into the quality of a man, and examination takes place by means of Divine truth; a "light cloud" signifies Divine truth spiritual-natural, from which it becomes evident what is the quality of a man in respect to his natural; "therefore the idols of Egypt shall be in commotion before Him, and the heart of the Egyptian shall melt in the midst of him," signifies a collection and crowd of falsities in the natural man from which is its worship, and its terror because of visitation. [49] "I will shut up Egypt in the hand of a hard lord, and a strong king shall rule over them," signifies that the evil of falsity and the falsity of evil will reign therein, "a hard lord" meaning the evil of falsity, and "a strong king" the falsity of evil; "then the waters shall fail in the sea, and the river shall dry up and become dry," signifies that there will be no truths in the natural man, nor any intelligence therefrom; "and the streams shall recede and the rivers of Egypt shall be dried up" signifies that it will turn itself from truths to falsities, and as intelligence will be, in consequence, without truths from the light of the spiritual man, it will become dead; "the reed and the flag shall wither," signifies that all perception of truth and good from the sense of the letter of the Word, which the sensual man would otherwise have, will vanish; "therefore the fishers shall moan and all they that cast the hook into the stream shall mourn, and they that spread the net upon the faces of the waters shall languish," signifies that those who teach and instruct will labor in vain to reform the natural man by truths from the Word, "fishers" and "they that spread the net upon the faces of the waters" signifying those that teach and instruct natural men from the Word, in particular from the sense of its letter; "fish" signifies the cognitions therefrom, and "to mourn and to languish" signifies to labor. [50] "They that make the flax of silks, and the weavers of curtains, shall be ashamed," signifies those who teach spiritual truths in a natural manner, "the flax of silks" meaning spiritual truth, "curtains" natural truths from a spiritual origin, and "to make" and "to weave" these meaning to teach; "how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of the kings of olden time? Where now are thy wise men?" signifies that the wisdom and intelligence of the natural man from the spiritual have perished, for the natural man is formed to receive intelligence and wisdom from the spiritual man, and this takes place when they both act as one, like cause and effect; "the princes of Zoan have become fools, the princes of Noph are carried away," signifies that the truths of wisdom and intelligence from spiritual light in the natural man are turned into the falsities of insanity; Zoan and Noph were in the land of Egypt, and signified the enlightenment of the natural man from spiritual light; "and they have seduced Egypt, the cornerstone of the tribes" signifies that the natural man has been perverted, on which, nevertheless, all the truths and the goods of the church have their foundation; "there shall be no work for Egypt that may make head and tail, branch and rush" signifies that they no longer have any intelligence or knowledge of truth, consequently no truth either spiritual or natural. [51] In Ezekiel:      Son of man, set thy faces against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt; speak and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovih, Behold I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great whale, that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself; therefore I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales; and I will abandon thee in the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers; upon the faces of the field thou shalt fall, thou shalt not be gathered nor brought together; I have given thee for food to the wild beast of the land and to the bird of heaven, that all the inhabitants of Egypt may know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel; when they laid hold of thee by the hand thou wast broken and didst pierce every shoulder for them, and when they leaned upon thee thou wast broken, and didst make all their loins to be at a stand. Behold I will bring against thee the sword, and I will cut off from thee man and beast, that the land of Egypt may become a solitude and a waste; because he hath said, The river is mine, and I made it, therefore I am against thee and against thy rivers, and I will give the land of Egypt unto desolations, from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Cush, and her cities shall be a solitude forty years (Ezek. 29:2-12). This, too, is a description of the natural man deprived of all truth and good by conceit from knowledge and the consequent self-intelligence. Because "Pharaoh king of Egypt" signifies the knowledge of the natural man and self-intelligence therefrom, it is said, "Behold I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great whale that lieth in the midst of his rivers," "great whale" signifying the knowledge of the natural man in general, here false knowledge, and "river" signifying self-intelligence; "who saith, The river is mine, and I have made it myself," signifies intelligence from self and not from the Lord; thus the words involve the conceit of self-intelligence; "therefore I will put a hook in thy jaws" signifies false speaking, for which it will be chastised; "and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales" signifies the false knowledges of the lowest kind which are from the fallacies of the senses, "fish" meaning knowledges, and "scales" the fallacies of the senses, which are knowledges of the lowest kind. [52] "And I will abandon in the wilderness thee and all the fish of thy rivers," signifies to be stripped of truths and of all knowledges from which is intelligence; "upon the faces of the field thou shalt fall, thou shalt not be gathered nor brought together," signifies a religious principle without coherence and that cannot be re-established; "I have given thee for food to the wild beast of the land and to the bird of heaven" signifies to be consumed by the affections and thoughts of falsity; "that all the inhabitants of Egypt may know that I am Jehovah" signifies that it may be known and believed that all truth and good, even in the natural man, are from the Lord; "because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel" signifies confidence in the knowledges of the sensual man, which are fallacies with men of the church (that "a staff of reed" signifies such confidence, see above, n. 627); "when they laid hold of thee by the hand thou wast broken, and didst pierce every shoulder for them" signifies that through faith in these all the power of truth is destroyed; "and when they leaned upon thee thou wast broken, and didst make all their loins to be at a stand," signifies that through confidence in these the faculty to receive the good of love is destroyed. [53] "Behold I will bring against thee the sword, and I will cut off from thee man and beast," signifies that falsity will destroy all the understanding of truth and the affection of good in the natural man; "that the land of Egypt may become a solitude and a waste" signifies that in consequence the natural man is without any truth and good; "because he hath said, The river is mine, and I made it," signifies because of the conceit of self-intelligence; "and I will give the land of Egypt unto desolation from the tower of Seveneh unto the border of Cush" signifies the destruction of the church from first things to last in the natural man; "her cities shall be a solitude forty years" signifies doctrinals from mere falsities until there is no truth left, "forty years" signifying the entire period of vastation of the church, and also the entire duration of temptations. [54] In the second book of Kings:      Thou hast trusted thyself upon the staff of a bruised reed, upon Egypt, upon which if a man lean it entereth into his hand and pierceth it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him (2 Kings 18:21). "Staff of a reed" and "to lean upon it" have a similar signification as just above. Therefore Egypt is called in David:      The wild beast of the reed, the congregation of the strong, which scattereth the peoples (Ps. 68:30). "The wild beast of the reed" signifies the affection or cupidity of falsity from the knowledges [scientifica] of the sensual man, which are fallacies; these are called "the congregation of the strong," because they strongly persuade; and because these disperse the truths of the church it is said, "which scattereth the peoples." [55] In Hosea:      Ephraim shall be like a silly dove, without heart. They have called Egypt, they have gone away to Assyria; woe unto them, for they have wandered away from Me; devastation to them, for they have transgressed against Me; their princes shall fall by the sword, for the indignation of their tongue; this is their derision in the land of Egypt (Hos. 7:11, 13, 16). This treats of the pride of Israel, by which is signified the conceit of self-intelligence in such things as belong to the church. That "Egypt" signifies the natural man and its knowledge, is evident from this, that "Ephraim," who is much treated of in this prophet, signifies the understanding of the church and its truth of doctrine in the natural (that this is the signification of "Ephraim" see above, n. 440); so "Ephraim shall be like a silly dove, without heart," signifies that now there will be no understanding, because there is no truth and no affection of truth and good; "they have called Egypt and have gone away to Assyria" signifies their confiding in the knowledges of the natural man and in reasonings therefrom, which deceive; "woe unto them, for they have wandered away from Me," signifies aversion from the truths which are from the Word; "devastation to them, for they have transgressed against Me," signifies the loss of all truth because of their falling away; "their princes shall fall by the sword" signifies that the leading truths will be destroyed by falsities; "for the indignation of their tongue; this is their derision in the land of Egypt," signifies the vituperation of doctrine by the natural man, and contempt for it. [56] In the same:      Israel, thou hast gone a-whoring from thy God; they shall not dwell in the land of Jehovah, and Ephraim shall return unto Egypt, and they shall eat what is unclean in Assyria; lo, they are gone away because of devastation; Egypt shall gather them together, Moph shall bury them; as to the desirable things of their silver the thistle shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents (Hos. 9:1, 3, 6). The whole of this chapter treats of the understanding of the Word destroyed, which is here signified by "Ephraim." "Israel gone a-whoring from his God" signifies the truth of the Word falsified; "they shall not dwell in the land of Jehovah" signifies that they shall have no life of good, like that in heaven; "and Ephraim shall return unto Egypt" signifies the understanding of truth destroyed, whence they become natural; "and they shall eat what is unclean in Assyria" signifies the rational swarming with falsities of evil; "lo, they are gone away because of devastation," signifies a turning away from the Lord through the falsification of truth; "Egypt shall gather them together," signifies that they have become merely natural; "Moph shall bury them" signifies spiritual death through the application of the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word to the falsities of evil; "the desirable things of their silver" signify the knowledges of truth; "the thistle shall possess them" signifies that evil shall pervert them; "thorns shall be in their tents" signifies the falsity of evil in worship. [57] In the same:      Israel shall not return to Egypt, the Assyrian he is their <a name="fr_301"></a><a href="#fn_301"><font size="1">654-2</font></a> king (Hos. 11:5). "Israel shall not return to Egypt" signifies that when the man of the church has become spiritual he must not become natural; "the Assyrian he is their king" signifies that reasonings from falsities will then rule. The man of the church from being spiritual becomes natural when he separates faith from charity, that is, believes the Word but does not live according to its commands; so also when he claims to himself intelligence and does not attribute it to the Lord; from this is the conceit whereby man becomes natural. For man is first natural, afterwards he becomes rational, and lastly spiritual. When man is natural he is in Egypt, when he becomes rational, he is in Assyria, and when he becomes spiritual he is in the land of Canaan, thus in the church. [58] In the same:      Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind; every day he multiplieth falsehood and devastation; and they make a covenant with the Assyrian, and oil is conveyed down into Egypt (Hos. 12:1). "Ephraim" signifies the church in which the understanding of truth is destroyed; "to feed on wind" signifies to imbibe falsity; "the east wind which he followeth after" signifies the drying up and dispersion of truth; that "oil is conveyed down into Egypt" signifies that the good of love is perverted by the knowledges [scientifica] of the natural man. (But see further explanation of this above, n. 419.) [59] In Isaiah:      Woe to the refractory sons, that make counsel but not of Me, and that make a molten image but not by My spirit, that they may add sin to sin; that go to descend into Egypt, but have not asked at My mouth; and to confide in the shadow of Egypt. Therefore the strength of Pharaoh shall become to you a shame, and confidence in the shadow of Egypt a confusion (Isa. 30:1-3). "Woe to the refractory" signifies lamentation over the damnation of those who turn themselves away; "that make counsel but not of Me" signifies thoughts and conclusions respecting the things of heaven from self and not from the Lord; and "that make a molten image, but not by My spirit," signifies worship from infernal falsity and not from Divine truth; "that go to descend into Egypt, but have not asked at My mouth," signifies from the selfhood [proprium] of the natural man, and not from the Word; "and to confide in the shadow of Egypt" signifies confiding and having faith in such things as are suggested by the natural man, which has no heavenly light. "Therefore the strength of Pharaoh shall become a shame, and confidence in the shadow of Egypt a confusion," signifies no ability to resist evils from self-intelligence, nor from the knowledge [scientia] of the natural man, "shame and confusion" signifying the state of such, when they are reputed vile because of evils. [60] In Jeremiah:      Thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, at the time when He led thee in the way. What hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor; and what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river? Why goest thou off actively to change thy way? Thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt also as thou wast ashamed of Assyria (Jer. 2:17, 18, 36). This, too, treats of the man of the church who by the falsities of doctrine and the evils of life therefrom becomes external and merely natural. "Thou hast forsaken Jehovah at the time when He led thee in the way" signifies a turning away from being reformed by the Lord by means of truths that lead; "what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor?" signifies instruction solely from the natural man, from which there are mere falsities; "what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?" signifies reasonings from the natural man from which are the falsities of faith; "why goest thou off actively to change thy way?" signifies strong opposition to being so reformed as to become spiritual; "thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt also as thou wast ashamed of Assyria" signifies that it is a perverse and vile state to be led by the natural man and by reasonings therefrom, because this is to be led by falsities and evils from the selfhood [proprium].  [61] In Lamentation:      Our inheritance has been turned away unto strangers, our houses unto aliens. We have drunken our waters for silver; our wood cometh for a price. We have given the hand to Egypt, to Assyria, that we may be satisfied with bread. Servants rule over us, there is no one to set us free from their hands (Lam. 5:2, 4, 6, 8). "Our inheritance has been turned away unto strangers" signifies the truths of the church converted into falsities; "our houses unto aliens" signifies the goods of the church turned into evils; "we have drunken our waters for silver" signifies instruction only from ourselves, which is the source of mere falsities; "our wood cometh for a price" signifies instruction only from ourselves, which is the source of mere evils. Because man is instructed and reformed freely by the Lord, that is, "without silver and without price" (Isa. 55:1), therefore to drink "for silver" and to procure wood and gain warmth "for a price," signifies solely from ourselves; and as to be instructed solely from ourselves is to be instructed by the natural man and its knowledges [scientifica] and conclusions therefrom, therefore it is said "we have given the hand to Egypt, to Assyria, that we may be satisfied with bread," "Egypt" signifying the natural man, which is the source of falsities, and "Assyria" the natural man reasoning from falsities, whence are evils; and as the things belonging to the natural man are relatively things of service, since the natural man was created to serve the spiritual, therefore when the natural rules over the spiritual, servants have dominion, and this is what is meant by "servants rule over us, there is no one to set us free from their hands. [62] In Jeremiah:      If ye say, We will not dwell in this land, saying, No, but we will come into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, and shall not hear the sound of the trumpet and shall not hunger for bread, and there will we dwell. But if ye set your faces to enter into Egypt, and come to sojourn there, it shall be that the sword which ye fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and there ye shall die; and it shall be with all the men who set their faces to come into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, none of them shall be a residue nor escape; and ye shall be for a curse, an astonishment, and an execration and a reproach, and ye shall see this place no more (Jer. 42:13-18 et seq.). We frequently read, in both the historical and the prophetical parts of the Word, that the Israelitish people burned with a desire to return into Egypt, and that this was forbidden them, and they were threatened with plagues and punishments if they did so; but the reason for this has heretofore been known to no one. The reason was that the sons of Israel were to represent a church from its first rise to its end; and the church is first formed with man by knowledges and cognitions in the natural man, for by these the natural man is first cultivated; for every man is born natural, therefore the natural must first be cultivated in order that it may finally serve as a basis for man's intelligence and wisdom. Afterwards by means of knowledges and cognitions which are implanted in the natural man, an intellectual is formed, that man may become rational. But in order that a man from being rational may become spiritual he must needs endure temptations, for by these the rational is so subdued, as not to call forth from the natural such things as favor the lusts, and destroy the rational. Finally when man has in this way been made rational he then is made spiritual, for the rational is the medium between the spiritual and the natural, consequently the spiritual flows into the rational, and through this into the natural. [63] In a word, a man must first enrich the memory with knowledges [scientiae], afterwards by these his understanding must be cultivated, and finally the will. The memory belongs to the natural man, the understanding to the rational, and the will to the spiritual. This is the way of man's reformation and regeneration. This is why the sons of Israel were first led into Egypt, afterwards into the wilderness to undergo temptations, and finally into the land of Canaan, for as has been said, they were to represent the church from its first rise to its last end. Their abiding and sojourning in Egypt represented the instruction of the natural man; their wanderings forty years in the wilderness represented the temptations by which the rational man is formed; and the land of Canaan, into which they were finally brought, represented the church, which regarded in itself is spiritual. [64] But they who are not willing to be reformed and regenerated stop at the first stage, and remain natural; and this is why the sons of Israel, who were not willing, so often desired to return to Egypt (which desire of theirs is frequently mentioned in the book of Exodus); for they were natural, and were scarcely capable of becoming spiritual, and yet they were to represent those things that belong to the spiritual church; for this reason they were led into Egypt, and afterwards into the wilderness, and finally into the land of Canaan, thus representing the rise, progress, and final establishment of the church with man. This makes clear why the sons of Israel were so strongly forbidden to return into Egypt; for by so doing they would have represented that from being spiritual men they had become natural, and when a spiritual man becomes natural he no longer sees any truths and does not perceive any goods, but falls into falsities and evils of every kind. [65] But to return to the explanation of the above words. "If ye say, We will not dwell in this land, saying, No, but we will go into the land of Egypt," signifies the aversion from a spiritual state, in which they are who are of the church, and a longing for a natural state and for the things that pertain to the natural man; "where we shall see no war and shall not hear the sound of the trumpet, and shall not hunger for bread," signifies that there will then be no infestation from falsities and evils, and no temptations, "war" signifying infestation and combat by falsities and evils, and "not to hunger for bread" signifying not to desire good, which is the state of those who are in falsities and evils, and thus of those who are merely natural; such are not infested by evils and falsities because they are in them, and know nothing about truths and goods; "and there will we dwell" signifies a natural life. [66] "But if ye set your faces to enter into Egypt, and come to sojourn there," signifies if from their love they long for a natural life; "it shall be that the sword which ye fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt" signifies falsities destroying truths, "and the famine whereof ye were afraid shall cleave to you there in Egypt" signifies a lack of the knowledges of truth and good; "and there shall ye die" signifies the consequent desolation of the church and damnation; "and all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence," signifies the like as before, "pestilence" signifying the vastation of all good and truth; "none of them shall be a residue or escape" signifies that nothing whatever of truth and good will survive; "and ye shall be for a curse, an astonishment, an execration, and a reproach," signifies all things belonging to damnation; "and ye shall see this place no more" signifies that nothing of the church shall be in them any longer. [67] In Ezekiel:      There were two women, the daughters of one mother, who committed whoredom in Egypt; their names were Oholah the elder, which is Samaria, and Oholibah, which is Jerusalem. Oholah committed whoredom while subject to Me, and loved the Assyrians her neighbors, and bestowed her whoredoms upon the choice of all the sons of Asshur. Yet she forsook not her whoredoms from Egypt, for they lay with her in her youth. Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, the sons of Asshur. They disclosed her nakedness, they took her sons and her daughters, and her they finally slew with the sword. Her sister Oholibah saw, and corrupted her love more than she, and her whoredoms above the whoredoms of her sister; she doted upon the sons of Asshur. For she increased her whoredoms, when indeed she saw men painted upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans painted with vermilion, all having the semblance of captains, the likeness of the sons of Babylon, of the Chaldeans. And the sons of Babylon came to her to the bed of loves, and they defiled her with their whoredom. She multiplied her whoredoms when she remembered the days of her youth, in which she committed whoredom in the land of Egypt. She doted upon their concubines, because their flesh was the flesh of asses, and their issue the issue of horses. Thus didst thou commend the crime of thy youth, when thou didst adorn thy breasts from Egypt. Therefore, Oholibah, I will stir up thy lovers against thee, the sons of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, and all the Assyrians with them. They shall take thy sons and thy daughters, and thy posterity shall be devoured by fire. They shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall take away the jewels of thine adorning. Thus will I make thy crime to cease from thee, and thy whoredom from the land of Egypt, that thou lift not up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt anymore. Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and grief, with the cup of wasting and desolation (Ezek. 23:2-33, and further to the end). To make clear that "Egypt" signifies the natural man, here the natural separated from the spiritual, and "Asshur" the rational, here reasoning from things belonging to the natural man, I will give a summary explanation of the above. "There were two women, the daughters of one mother, who committed whoredom in Egypt," signifies the falsifications of truth and good, and as the sons of Jacob were merely natural men, they imbibed "the idolatries of the Egyptians," which signifies that they falsified all the truths of the church; "their names were Oholah the elder, which is Samaria, and Oholibah which is Jerusalem," signifies both the spiritual and the celestial church, which were represented by the posterity of Jacob, the Israelites who were in Samaria representing the spiritual church, and the Jews in Jerusalem the celestial church, both from the same mother, which is Divine truth. [68] "Oholah committed whoredom while subject to Me" signifies the falsification of Divine truth which is in the Word; "and loved the Assyrians her neighbors, and bestowed her whoredoms upon the choice of all the sons of Asshur," signifies confirmations by many reasonings; "yet she left not her whoredoms from Egypt, for they lay with her in her youth," signifies that they still followed after their idolatries; "therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, the sons of Asshur," signifies reasonings confirming idolatries; "they disclosed her nakedness, they took her sons and her daughters, and her they finally slew with the sword," signifies the deprivation of all truth and good and the consequent extinction of the church with them, "nakedness" meaning deprivation, "sons and daughters" truths and goods, and "Oholah" <a name="fr_302"></a><a href="#fn_302"><font size="1">654-3</font></a> the church; "her sister Oholibah saw, and corrupted her love more than she, and her whoredoms above the whoredoms of her sister," signifies the devastation of the celestial church represented by the Jewish nation in Jerusalem, which is said "to have corrupted her love more than her sister," when it perverted and adulterated the goods of the Word, and thence of doctrine; for it is a greater sin to corrupt or pervert the goods of the church than its truths. [69] "She doted upon the sons of Asshur" signifies that this was done by reasonings against truths and goods; "she increased her whoredoms, when she saw men painted upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans painted with vermilion" signifies fancies from the fallacies of the senses, which are of the sensual man, and arguings therefrom, from which are falsifications; "all having the semblance of captains, the likeness of the sons of Babylon, of the Chaldeans" signifies the appearance that they are pre-eminent truths, to be preferred above the others; "and the sons of Babylon came to her, and they defiled her with their whoredom" signifies the conjunction with the falsities of evil from the love of self; "she multiplied her whoredoms when she remembered the days of her youth, in which she committed whoredom in the land of Egypt," signifies the confirmation of their idolatries and of the falsities of evil which have been imbibed from the natural man, and thus increase of their falsifications; "she doted upon their concubines, because their flesh was the flesh of asses, and their issue the issue of horses," signifies the cupidities of love for these, because from their voluntary selfhood, and thence from their intellectual selfhood, "the flesh of asses" meaning the voluntary selfhood, and the "issue of horses" the intellectual selfhood therefrom which pervert all things. [70] "Thus didst thou favor the crime of thy youth, when thou didst adorn thy breasts from Egypt," signifies the love of falsity implanted from the earliest age, and enjoyment therefrom; "therefore, Oholibah, I will stir up thy lovers against thee, the sons of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, and the Assyrians with them," signifies the destruction of the church by evils from the love of self, and by falsities from the conceit of self-intelligence, in which there is a deadly hatred against the goods and truths of doctrine. "They shall take thy sons and thy daughters" signifies the truths and goods of the church, which they will destroy; "and thy posterity shall be devoured by fire" signifies that the remaining things therefrom will perish through earthly loves; "they shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall take away the jewels of thine adorning" signifies the deprivation of all intelligence and knowledge [scientia], which are the glory of the church; "thus will I make thy crime to cease from thee, and thy whoredom from the land of Egypt," signifies that thus truths can no longer be falsified; "that thou lift not up thine eyes upon them, nor remember Egypt anymore," signifies when there is no longer any understanding of truth or knowledge [scientia] of truth; "thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and grief" signifies insanity in things spiritual, and aversion to them; "with the cup of wasting and desolation" signifies the falsities of evil which wholly devastate and desolate all the goods and truths of the church. [71] In the same:      Thou hast committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt thy neighbors, great of flesh, and hast multiplied thy whoredom; and thou hast committed whoredom with the sons of Asshur, and there was no satiety to thee. And thou hast multiplied thy whoredom even to Chaldea, the land of thy traffic, and even then wast thou not satisfied (Ezek. 16:26, 28, 29). This is said of the abominations of Jerusalem, which signifies the church in respect to doctrine; and "whoredoms" signify the falsifications of the truth of doctrine and of the Word; therefore "thou hast committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt thy neighbors, great of flesh," signifies falsifications by the natural man, in which are all evils and falsities, "flesh" signifying what is man's own [proprium], which has its seat in the natural man, and in itself is nothing but evil and falsity therefrom; "and thou hast committed whoredom with the sons of Asshur" signifies falsifications by means of reasonings; "and there was no satiety to thee" signifies the cupidity for falsifying truths without limit; "and thou hast multiplied thy whoredoms even to Chaldea, the land of thy traffic," signifies the falsifications from the sensual man, where are mere fallacies, from which man wholly rejects and denies truths, and even blasphemes them; "the land of traffic" signifies where all falsities are procured, and the sensual is the fountain of all evils and all falsities therefrom. Moreover, man is born at first sensual, afterwards he becomes natural, then rational, and at length spiritual, and he who falsifies the truths of the church becomes again natural, and at length sensual. "And yet thou wast not satisfied" signifies an immense cupidity for destroying the truths of the church. [72] In Joel:      Egypt shall be a waste, and Edom a waste wilderness, because of the violence to the sons of Judah, whose innocent blood they have shed in their land (Joel 3:19). "Egypt shall be a waste" signifies that the natural man will be without truths, and thus in mere falsities; "and Edom a waste wilderness" signifies that the natural man will be without goods and thence in mere evils; "because of the violence to the sons of Judah, whose innocent blood they have shed," signifies because they have offered violence to the truths and goods of the Word, which they have perverted. [73] Like things are involved in the wars between the sons of Israel and the Egyptians; also in the wars between the sons of Israel and the Assyrians; as also between the Assyrians and Egyptians, as in 2 Kings 23:29 to the end; 24; Isa. 10:3-5; and also in the first book of Kings:      That under king Rehoboam the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the house of the king; and took the shields which Solomon had made, and many other things (1 Kings 14:25, 26). For in all the historical parts of the Word, as well as in its prophetical parts, there is a spiritual sense; since all the historical occurrences in the Word are representative of spiritual and celestial things that belong to heaven and the church, and the words there are significative; thus that "the king of Egypt took the treasures of the house of Jehovah and of the house of the king" and the rest, represented the devastation of the church in respect to the cognitions of good and truth through knowledges [scientifica] wrongly applied, which are in the natural man. [74] What the quality of the natural man is when it is subject to the spiritual, and what it is when it is separated from it, is fully described in Exodus in the internal sense. What the quality of the natural man is when it is subject to the spiritual and thus conjoined to it, is described in the story of Joseph, and of the sons of Israel called thither by Joseph and their dwelling in the land of Goshen, which was the best of the lands of Egypt. The story of Joseph describes the dominion of the Lord over the natural man, for "Joseph" means in the spiritual sense the Lord, and "Egypt" the natural man, and "the sons of Israel" the spiritual man. But afterwards what the quality of the natural man is when separated from the spiritual is described by Pharaoh's making the sons of Israel to serve grievously; and its subsequent vastation in respect to all the truths and goods of the church is described by the miracles wrought in Egypt, which were so many plagues; and its final destruction is described by the drowning of Pharaoh and all his host in the Sea Suph. [75] The miracles by which the vastation of the natural man separated from the spiritual is described in the spiritual sense, were these:      The staff of Aaron was turned into a serpent; the waters in the river were turned into blood, so that the fish died, and the river stank (Exod. 7);      From the rivers and pools frogs were brought up upon the land of Egypt; the dust of the earth was turned into lice; swarms of noxious flying insects were sent into the house of Pharaoh, of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt (Exod. 8);      Boils broke forth with blains upon man and upon beast; a rain of grievous hail mingled with fire rained upon the land of Egypt (Exod. 9);      Locusts were sent upon the land, which devoured the herb and all the fruit of the tree; a thick darkness came over all the land of Egypt (Exod. 10);      All the firstborn in the land of Egypt died (Exod. 11);      Finally when the sons of Israel had borrowed of them and thus spoiled them of their vessels of gold and silver, and raiment (which signify the knowledges of good and truth) (Exod. 12:35, 36);      The Egyptians were drowned in the Sea Suph (which signifies hell) (Exod. 14:28). All this describes how the natural man is vastated, which takes place when he casts away from himself all the truths and goods of the church, and imbibes falsities and evils, until there is no longer any truth or good of the church remaining. (But all these things as to the spiritual sense may be seen explained at length in the Arcana Coelestia, where Exodus is unfolded.) From this it can be seen what is signified by:      The plagues and diseases of Egypt (Deut. 7:15; 28:60); Also what by:      Being drowned by the river of Egypt (Amos 8:8; 9:5).  Also why it is that Egypt is called:      A land of bondage (Micah 6:4);      Likewise the land of Ham (Ps. 105:23);      And a furnace of iron (Deut. 4:20; 1 Kings 8:51).  All this has reference to Egypt, from which it manifestly appears that "Egypt" signifies the natural man in both senses. </p>

 <p>Where also our Lord was crucified, signifies by which, namely, by the evils and the falsities therefrom springing from infernal love, He was rejected and condemned. This is evident from this, that evils themselves and their falsities springing from infernal love are what reject and condemn the Lord. These evils and the falsities thence are signified by "Sodom and Egypt," therefore it is said of the city Jerusalem that it is thus "called spiritually," for "to be called spiritually Sodom and Egypt" signifies evil itself, and the falsity therefrom. [2] The hells are divided into two kingdoms, over against the two kingdoms in the heavens; the kingdom over against the celestial kingdom is at the back, and those who are in it are called genii; this kingdom is what is meant in the Word by "devil;" but the kingdom that is over against the spiritual kingdom is in front, and those who are in it are called evil spirits; this kingdom is what is meant in the Word by "Satan." These hells, or these two kingdoms into which the hells are divided, are meant by "Sodom and Egypt." Whether it is said evils and the falsities therefrom, or these hells, it is the same, since from these all evils and all falsities therefrom ascend. [3] That the Jews who were at Jerusalem crucified the Lord means that He was crucified by the evils and falsities therefrom which they loved; for all things recorded in the Word respecting the Lord's passion represented the perverted state of the church with that nation. For although they accounted the Word holy, yet by their traditions they perverted all things therein until there was no longer any Divine good or truth remaining with them, and when Divine good and Divine truth, which are in the Word, no longer remain, evils and falsities from infernal love succeed in their place, and these are what crucify the Lord. (That such things are signified by the Lord's passion may be seen above, n. 83, 195, 627. That the Lord is said "to be slain" signifies that he was rejected and denied, see above, n. 328; and that the Jews were such, see above, n. 122, 433, 619; and in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 248.) [4] As it is here said "where our Lord was crucified," it shall be told what "crucifixion" (or hanging upon wood) signified with the Jews. They had two modes of capital punishment, crucifixion and stoning; and "crucifixion" signified a condemnation and curse because of the destruction of good in the church, and "stoning" signified a condemnation and curse because of the destruction of truth in the church. "Crucifixion" signified a condemnation and curse because of the destruction of good in the church, for the reason that "wood," upon which they were hung, signified good, and in the contrary sense evil, both pertaining to the will; and "stoning" signified a condemnation and curse because of the destruction of truth in the church, for the reason that "the stone," with which they were stoned, signified truth, and in the contrary sense falsity, both pertaining to the understanding; for all things instituted with the Israelitish and Jewish nation were representative, and thence significative. (That "wood" signifies good, and in the contrary sense evil, and that a "stone" signifies truth, and in the contrary sense falsity, may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia, n. 643, 3720, 8354.) But as it has not been known heretofore why the Jews and Israelites had the punishment of the cross and the punishment of stoning, and it is important that it should be known, I will cite some confirmations from the Word to show that these two punishments were representative. [5] That "hanging upon wood" or "crucifixion" was inflicted because of the destruction of good in the church, and that it thus represented the evil of infernal love, whence arises a condemnation and curse, can be seen from the following passages. In Moses:      If there be a stubborn and rebellious son, obeying not the voice of his father or mother, all the men of the city shall stone him with stones that he may die. And if there be in a man a crime and judgment of death, and he be put to death, thou shalt hang him upon wood; his carcass shall not remain overnight upon the wood, but burying thou shalt bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is a curse of God, and thou shalt not defile thy land (Deut. 21:18, 20-23). "Not obeying the voice of father or mother" signifies in the spiritual sense to live contrary to the precepts and truths of the church, therefore the penalty for it was stoning; "the men of the city who were to stone him" signify those who are in the doctrine of the church, "city" signifying doctrine. "If there be in a man a crime, a judgment of death, thou shalt hang him upon wood" signifies if one has done evil against the good of the Word and of the church; because this was a capital crime he was to be hung upon wood, for in the Word "wood" signifies good, and in the contrary sense evil; "his carcass shall not remain overnight upon the wood, but thou shalt bury him the same day," signifies lest there be a representative of eternal damnation; "thou shalt not defile thy land" signifies that this would be a cause of offense to the church. [6] In Lamentations:      Our skins are become black like an oven because of the tempests of famine; they ravished the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah; their princes were hanged up by the hand, the faces of the elders are not honored, the young men they have led away to grind, and the boys stumble under the wood (Lam. 5:10-13). "Zion" means the celestial church, which is in the good of love to the Lord, which church the Jewish nation represented; "the virgins in the cities of Judah" signify the affections of truth from the good of love; "their princes were hanged up by the hand" signifies that truths from good were destroyed by falsities from evil; "the faces of the elders that were not honored" signify the goods of wisdom; "the young men who were led away to grind" signify the truths from good, "to grind" signifying to acquire falsities and to confirm them from the Word; "the boys stumble under the wood" signifies newborn goods perishing through evils. [7] A "baker" as also "bread" signifies the good of love, and a "butler" as also "wine," the truth of doctrine, therefore:      The baker was hanged on account of his crime against king Pharaoh (Gen. 40:19-22; 41:13). This may be seen explained in the Arcana Coelestia (n. 5139-5169). Because "Moab" means those who adulterate the goods of the church, and "Baal-peor" signifies the adulteration of good, it came to pass that:      All the chiefs of the people were hung up before the sun, because the people committed whoredom with the daughters of Moab and bowed themselves down to their gods, and joined themselves to Baal-peor (Num. 25:1-4). "To commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab" signifies to adulterate the goods of the church; and "to be hung up before the sun" signifies a condemnation and curse because of the destruction of the good of the church. [8] Because "Ai" signifies the knowledges of good, and in the contrary sense the confirmations of evil:      The king of Ai was hanged on wood, and afterwards thrown down at the entrance of the gate of the city, and the city itself was burned (Josh. 8:26-29). And because "the five kings of the Amorites" signified evils and falsities therefrom destroying the goods and truths of the church,      Those kings were hanged by Joshua, and afterwards cast into the cave of Makkedah (Josh. 10:26, 27); "the cave of Makkedah" signifying direful falsity from evil. [9] Again, "to be hung upon wood or to be crucified" signifies the punishment of evil that destroys the good of the church, in Matthew:      Jesus said, I send unto you prophets, wise men, and scribes; and some of them shall ye kill, crucify, and scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city (Matt. 23:34).  All things the Lord spoke He spoke from the Divine, but the Divine things from which he spoke fell into the ideas of natural thought and consequent expressions according to correspondences, like these here and elsewhere in the Gospels; and as all the words have a spiritual sense, so in that sense prophets, wise men, and scribes, are not here meant, but instead of them the truth and good of doctrine and of the Word; for spiritual thought and speech therefrom, like that of angels, is without the idea of person; so a "prophet" signifies the truth of doctrine, "wise men" the good of doctrine, and "scribes" the Word from which is doctrine; from this it follows that "to kill" has reference to the truth of the doctrine of the church, which is meant by a "prophet;" "to crucify" has reference to the good of doctrine, which is meant by "a wise man," and "to scourge" has reference to the Word, which is meant by a "scribe;" thus "to kill" signifies to extinguish, "to crucify" to destroy, and "to scourge" to pervert. That they will wander from one falsity of doctrine into another is signified by "persecuting them from city to city," "city" signifying doctrine. This is the spiritual sense of these words. [10] In the same:      Jesus said to the disciples that He must suffer at Jerusalem, and that the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn Him, and deliver Him up to the Gentiles to be mocked, to be scourged, and to be crucified; and the third day He shall rise again (Matt. 20:18, 19; Mark 10:32-34). The spiritual sense of these words is that Divine truth, in the church where mere falsities of doctrine and evils of life reign, shall be blasphemed, its truth shall be perverted, and its good destroyed. "The Son of man" signifies Divine truth, which is the Word, and "Jerusalem" signifies the church where mere falsities and evils reign; "the chief priests and scribes" signify the adulterations of good and the falsifications of truth, both from infernal love; "to condemn Him and deliver Him to the Gentiles" signifies to assign Divine truth and Divine good to hell and to deliver them to the evils and falsities that are from hell, the "Gentiles" signifying the evils that are from hell and that destroy the goods of the church; "to be mocked, to be scourged, and to be crucified," signifies to blaspheme, falsify and pervert the truth, and to adulterate and destroy the good of the church and of the Word (as above); "and the third day He shall rise again" signifies the complete glorification of the Lord's Human. [11] From this it can be seen what is signified in the spiritual sense by the Lord's crucifixion, also what is signified by the various mockings then connected with it, as that "they put a crown of thorns on His head," that "they smote Him with a reed," and also that "they spat in His face," with many other things related in the Gospels, this signifying that the Jewish nation treated Divine truth and good itself, which was the Lord, in a like heinous manner; for the Lord suffered the heinous state of that church to be represented in Himself; and this was also signified by:      His bearing their iniquities (Isa. 53:11). For it was a common thing for a prophet to take upon himself a representation of the heinous things of the church; thus the prophet Isaiah was commanded to go naked and barefoot three years, to represent the church as destitute of good and truth (Isa. 20:3, 4); the prophet Ezekiel, bound in cords, laid siege to a tile on which Jerusalem was depicted, and ate a cake of barley made with the dung of an ox, to represent that the truth and good of the church was thus besieged by falsities and polluted by evils (Ezek. 4:1-13); the prophet Hosea was commanded to take a harlot to himself for a woman, and children of whoredoms, to represent what the quality of the church was at that time (Hos. 1:1-11); with other like things. That this was "bearing the iniquities of the house of Israel" or the church is plainly declared in Ezekiel 4:5, 6. From this it can be seen that all things recorded concerning the passion of the Lord were representative of the state of the church at that time with the Jewish nation. [12] Thus much respecting the punishment of "hanging upon wood or crucifixion." This is not the place to confirm from the Word that the other punishment, which was "stoning," signified a condemnation and curse because of the destroyed truth of the church, but it can be seen from the passages where "stoning" is mentioned (as in Exod. 21:28-33; Lev. 24:10-17, 23; Num. 15:32-37; Deut. 13:10; 17:5-7; 22:20, 21, 24; Ezek. 16:39-41; 23:45-47; Matt. 23:37; Luke 13:34; 20:6; John 8:7; 10:31, 32; and elsewhere). </p>

 <p>Verses 9, 10. And they of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations shall see their bodies three days and a half and shall not suffer their bodies to be placed in sepulchers. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and shall be glad, and shall send gifts one to another, because those two prophets tormented them that dwell upon the earth. 9. "And they of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations shall see," signifies with all who are in the falsities and evils of religion, of doctrine, and of life (n. 657); "their bodies three days and a half," signifies the complete extinction of Divine truth and of Divine good (n. 658); "and shall not suffer their bodies to be placed in sepulchers," signifies the rejection and damnation of such (n. 659). 10. "And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and shall be glad," signifies the delights of infernal love with those who are opposed to the goods and truths of the church (n. 660); "and shall send gifts one to another," signifies their consociation (n. 661); "because those two prophets tormented them that dwell upon the earth," signifies the anxiety of heart in the devastated church on account of these (n. 662). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="657.">657.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 9. And they of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations shall see, signifies with all who are in the falsities and evils of religion, of doctrine, and of life. This is evident from the signification of "to see," as being to know, to perceive, and to understand; also from the signification of "peoples and tribes" as being those who are in the falsities of doctrine and religion; "peoples" in the Word mean all who are in truths or in falsities, whether they are of the church or of some religion out of the church (see n. 175, 331, 625); and "tribes" mean in the Word all who are in truths or in falsities of doctrine, for "tribes" signify all truths and falsities of doctrine (see above, n. 330, 430, 431, 454). From this it can be seen that "peoples and tribes" signify all who are in the truths or falsities of religion and of doctrine, here those who are in falsities, because it is said, "they shall see the bodies of the witnesses three days and a half, and shall not suffer them to be placed in sepulchers." This is evident also from the signification of "tongues and nations," as being those who are in the evils of doctrine and of life, for "tongues" signify the goods or evils of doctrine, and thence of religion (see above, n. 330, 455, 625); and "nations" signify the goods or evils of life (see also above, n. 175, 331, 625); from which it can be seen that "tongues and nations" signify all who are in the goods or the evils of doctrine and of life, here those who are in the evils, since it is said of them that "they shall see the bodies of the witnesses upon the street of the great city, and shall not suffer them to be placed in sepulchers." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="658.">658.</a></font></span>
 <p>Their bodies three days and a half, signifies the complete extinction of Divine truth and of Divine good. <a name="fr_303"></a><a href="#fn_303"><font size="1">658-1</font></a> This is evident from the signification of "bodies" (that is, of the "witnesses"), as being those who have extinguished with themselves all Divine truth and Divine good; for "the two witnesses," whom they killed, signify the goods of love and charity and the truths of doctrine and faith (see above, n. 228, 635); consequently "their bodies when killed" signify that these have been extinguished; but because the good of love and charity and the truth of doctrine and faith can be extinguished only with those who are in falsities of doctrine and in evils of life, these are meant, since others do not see that the goods of love and the truths of doctrine are extinguished; for everyone sees the things that are of the Lord, and thus of heaven and the church, according to what his state is, since from that he sees; consequently he can see no otherwise than in accord with what that is. Thus he who denies the Lord and His Divine in heaven and in the church sees them not, because he sees from the negative; therefore such a one does not see the witnesses alive, but their bodies as carcasses, that is, the goods of love and the truths of doctrine as no truths and goods, consequently as extinguished. The above is evident also from the signification of "three days and a half," as meaning what is complete, here complete extinction. [2] "Three and a half" means completeness, because "three" signifies an entire period or duration from beginning to end, consequently where the church is treated of, as here, "three and a half" signifies even to the end, and at the same time to a new beginning of it; therefore it is added "after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet," which signifies the beginning of a New Church after the end of the old. For at the end of the church all the good of love and the truth of doctrine is extinguished, but then there is a resuscitation, which is effected with those with whom a New Church is established by the Lord, and this is signified by "the spirit of life" that entered into them. "Three days and a half" signifies a complete or full state for this reason also, that this number has a similar signification as the number "seven," for it is half of it, and a number halved, or a number doubled, has a similar signification as the number that is halved or doubled; and the number "seven" signifies all, likewise what is full and complete, and is predicated of what is holy pertaining to heaven and the church. Respecting the signification of this number see above (n. 20, 24, 257, 300). That the greater numbers that are composed of smaller ones have a similar signification as the simple numbers from which they arise by multiplication, may be also seen above (n. 430); and that "three" signifies an entire period greater or less from beginning to end (above, n. 532). </p>
 
 
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="659.">659.</a></font></span>
 <p>And shall not suffer [their bodies] to be placed in sepulchers, signifies the rejection and damnation of such. This is evident from the signification of "not to be placed in sepulchers or not to be buried," as being eternal damnation; for "to be buried" signifies in the Word awakening into life and resurrection, because when a man dies and is buried he is awakened or rises again into eternal life. For after death a man continues to live equally as in the world, but he lays aside the earthly or material body, which served him for use in the natural world, and continues his life in a spiritual body. Burial, therefore, is only the rejection, as it were, of the exuviae that he carried about in the natural world. Burial signifies awakening into eternal life or resurrection, because the angels do not know what the death of a man is nor what his burial is, since with them there is no death and therefore no burial, but they perceive all things spiritually; when, therefore, the death of a man is mentioned in the Word, instead of death they perceive his passing over from one world into another; and where burial is mentioned they perceive his resurrection into life. It follows from this that "not to be buried" signifies resurrection not into life, but into damnation, which means spiritual death. Every man, indeed, after his departure out of the world is awakened and rises again, but some to life and some to damnation, and as "to be buried" signifies resurrection to life, so "not to be buried" signifies damnation, but here of those who reject the goods of love and the truths of doctrine, which are signified by "the two witnesses;" consequently "not to be placed in sepulchers" (or not to be buried) does not mean damnation except in the idea of those who condemn such goods and truths. Therefore what "sepulchers" signify in the Word, as also "to be buried" and "not to be buried," can be seen from the following passages. [2] That "sepulchers," because of the dead bodies and bones in them, signify things unclean, and thus things infernal, can be seen from many passages in the Word. As in Isaiah:      A people that provoke Me to anger continually before My faces; that burn incense upon bricks, that sit in sepulchers and lodge in waste places, that eat swine's flesh (Isa. 65:3, 4). "To provoke Jehovah to anger before His faces" signifies to sin against the truths and goods of the Word, and to fall away from the worship therein commanded, "the faces of Jehovah" meaning the things revealed in the Word; "to burn incense upon bricks" signifies worship from falsities of doctrine, "bricks" meaning the falsities of doctrine, and "to burn incense" meaning worship from them; "to sit in sepulchers" signifies to be in filthy loves; "to lodge in waste places" signifies to remain and to live in falsities, "waste places" meaning where there are no truths; "to eat swine's flesh" signifies to make infernal evils one's own. [3] In Moses:      Whosoever shall touch one upon the surface of the field that is slain by a sword, or a dead body, or the bone of a man, or a sepulcher, shall be unclean seven days, and afterwards he shall be purified (Num. 19:16, 18). "To touch" signifies in the Word to communicate; therefore that falsities and evils be not communicated and thus appropriated it was forbidden to touch things unclean, here "one slain by a sword," a "dead body," "the bone of a man," or a "sepulcher;" since "one slain by a sword" signifies one who has been destroyed by falsities, and has thence been condemned to hell; and a "dead body" signifies one who has been destroyed by evils; "the bone of a man" signifies infernal falsity, and a "sepulcher" infernal evil. [4] In Ezekiel:      Wail over the multitude of Egypt, and cast her down with them that go down into the pit. They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword. Asshur is there and all his assembly, his sepulchers are round about him, all the slain who have fallen by the sword, to whom sepulchers were given in the sides of the pit, and his assembly is round about his sepulcher. Elam and all his multitude is round about his sepulcher, all the uncircumcised slain by the sword (Ezek. 32:18, 20, 22-24). "The multitude of Egypt" signifies the knowledges [scientifica] of the natural man, which are dead because they do not come down and take form as effects, conclusions, and confirmations, from the truths of the spiritual man; "Asshur" signifies reasonings from such knowledges; therefore "Wail over the multitude of Egypt, and cast her down with them that go down into the pit," signifies grief because of the damnation of those who are in these knowledges, the "pit" signifying the hell where such dead knowledges have rule, that is, knowledges separated from truths, because employed to confirm falsities of doctrine and evils of life; "those slain by the sword," here as above, signify those who are condemned to the hells on account of falsities; "Asshur is there and all his assembly" signifies reasonings from those falsities; the "sepulchers" that are round about Asshur and in the sides of the pit, where Elam is, and "all the uncircumcised slain by the sword" signify the hells where these falsities are, that is, those who are in such falsities. [5] It is to be known that falsities and evils of every kind correspond to unclean and loathsome things in the natural world, and the more direful falsities and evils to things pertaining to dead bodies and to fetid excrementitious things, and the milder falsities and evils to things pertaining to swamps; consequently the dwelling-places in the hells of those who are in such falsities and evils appear like pits and sepulchers; and if you will believe it, such evil genii and spirits also have their abode in the sepulchers, privies, and swamps that are in our world, although they do not know it; this is so because they correspond, and the things that correspond conjoin. The same conclusion may be drawn from this, that to those who have been assassins and poisoners, and to those who have perceived delight in violating women, there is nothing more delightful than the odor of a corpse; and to those who have been eaten up with the love of ruling, and to those who have taken delight in adulteries, and no delight in marriages, there is nothing more delightful than the odor of excrement; and to those who have confirmed themselves in falsities, and have extinguished in themselves the affection of truth, there is nothing more delightful than the odor of a swamp and of urinous places. This is why the hells in which they dwell appear according to the corresponding delights, some like pits and some like sepulchers. [6] From this it appears why it was:      That those that were obsessed by demons were in sepulchers and came out therefrom (Matt. 8:28 seq.; Mark 5:2, 3, 5; Luke 8:27); namely, because those that were obsessed while they lived in the world were in falsities from evil, or in knowledges from the Word, which they made dead by employing them to confirm evils and also to destroy the genuine truths of the church, especially the truths respecting the Lord, the Word, and the life after death; these dead knowledges are called in the Word "traditions." This is why those that were obsessed by such, when they had become demons:      Were in sepulchers, and the demons themselves were afterwards cast out into swine, that cast themselves headlong into the sea (Matt. 8:31-33). They were "cast into swine" [because while they lived in the world they had been in sordid avarice], <a name="fr_304"></a><a href="#fn_304"><font size="1">659-1</font></a> and this is what "swine" correspond to and thence signify; they "cast themselves headlong into the sea" because the "sea" here signifies hell. [7] In David:      I have been reckoned with them that go down into the pit. I am become as a man that hath no strength; neglected among the dead, like the slain that lie in the sepulcher, whom Thou rememberest no more, and who are cut off from Thy hand. Thou hast laid me in the pit of the lower parts, in dark places, in the depths. Shall Thy mercy be declared in the sepulcher, Thy truth in destruction? (Ps. 88:4-6, 11) This treats of temptations, in the highest sense of the Lord's temptations; this describes of what nature these were, namely, that He seemed to Himself to be in hell among the damned, so fierce and enormous were the temptations the Lord endured; therefore "I have been reckoned with them that go down into the pit" signifies that He seemed to Himself to be in hell, "the pit" meaning hell; "I am become as a man that hath no strength" signifies that He then seemed to Himself to be without power, for temptations plunge a man into falsities and evils, in which there is no power; "neglected among the dead" signifies among those who have nothing of truth and good, and who are therefore rejected; "as the slain that lie down in the sepulcher" signifies like those who are in falsities from evil, "the slain" signifying those who perish by falsities, and "the sepulcher" hell, because those that are in hell are spiritually dead; "whom Thou rememberest no more, and who are cut off from Thy hand," signifies who are deprived of all truth and good; "Thou hast laid me in the pit of the lower parts" signifies in the places of hell where such are; "in dark places" signifies as it were in falsities; "in the depths" signifies as it were in evils. [8] There is now added a prayer from grief that he may be delivered from temptations, and for this among other reasons, "Shall Thy mercy be declared in the sepulcher, and Thy truth in destruction?" which signifies that in hell, where and from which are evils and falsities, Divine good and Divine truth cannot be proclaimed, "mercy" meaning the Divine good of the Divine love, and "truth" the Divine truth of the Divine wisdom, "sepulcher" meaning the hell where and from which are evils, and "destruction" the hell where and from which are falsities. From this it appears that "sepulcher" means hell, because they who are in hell are spiritually dead. [9] In Isaiah:      That He might give the wicked to their sepulcher, and the rich in their deaths (Isa. 53:9). This also is said of the Lord, of whom the whole of this chapter treats, but here of His victories over the hells. "The wicked given to the sepulcher" mean the evil who will be cast down into hell; here "sepulcher" plainly stands for hell, which is called a sepulcher because of the spiritually dead who are in it; "the rich given in their deaths" mean those of the church who are in falsities from evils, who are called "rich" by reason of the knowledges of truth and good which they have from the Word; falsities from evil are signified by "deaths," because those who are in them are spiritually dead. [10] Those who think evil about God and the neighbor but speak well, and those who think insanely about truths of faith and goods of love but speak sanely, such inwardly are sepulchers whited without, according to these words of the Lord:      Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye are like unto whited sepulchers, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of the bones of the dead and of all uncleanness (Matt. 23:27, 29; Luke 11:47, 48). [11] And in David:      There is nothing right in the mouth of anyone, their midst is perditions; their throat is an open sepulcher, they flatter with their tongue (Ps. 5:9). "In the mouth" signifies outwardly, the "midst" inwardly; that there is hell within is signified by "their throat is an open sepulcher;" and that outwardly there is hypocrisy and seeming sanity is signified by "they flatter with their tongue." These and other passages in the Word make evident what "sepulcher" signifies. [12] So when those who are in falsities from evil are treated of, by "their sepulcher" the hell from which and in which there is such falsity is meant; but when those who are in truths from good are treated of, "sepulcher" means the removal and rejection of falsity from evil, and "burial" means awakening and resurrection into life, as also regeneration. For with a man who is in truths from good, falsity from evil is removed and rejected into hell, and the man himself, in respect to his interiors, which belong to his spirit, rises again and enters into the life of truth from good, which is the spiritual life. In this sense "burial" is to be understood in the following passages. [13] In John:      Marvel not, for the hour cometh in which all that are in the sepulchers shall hear the voice of the Son of man, and shall come forth; they that have done goods unto the resurrection of life, but they that have done evils unto the resurrection of judgment (John 5:28, 29). This does not mean that those who are in sepulchers or tombs shall hear the voice of the Lord and come forth, for all after death, equally as in this world, live as men, with the difference only that after death they live in a spiritual body, and not in a material body; therefore "to go forth out of the sepulchers" signifies out of the material body; and this going forth first takes place with everyone immediately after death, and afterwards when the Last Judgment is wrought, for at that time the exteriors are removed and the interiors are opened with all with whom this had not previously been done; then those whose interiors are heavenly are raised up unto life, but those with whom the interiors are infernal are raised up unto death, and this is what is signified by "they that have done goods shall go forth unto the resurrection of life, but they that have done evils unto the resurrection of judgment." [14] That this is meant by "going forth out of the tombs or out of the sepulchers" is still more evidently manifest in Ezekiel:      Behold I will open your sepulchers and will cause you to come up out of your sepulchers, O My people, and will bring you upon the land of Israel, that ye may know that I am Jehovah, when I shall have opened your sepulchers and have caused you to come up out of your sepulchers, O My people, and have given My Spirit in you that ye may live, and have placed you upon your own land (Ezek. 37:12-14). This treats of the dry bones seen by the prophet upon the faces of the valley; upon these sinews appeared to be stretched and flesh came up, and skin covered them; and when the Spirit of God came into them they lived again and stood upon their feet. That by these bones the whole house of Israel was meant is openly declared in these words:      Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold they say, Our bones are dried up, our hope is perished; as for us we are cut off (Ezek. 37:11). This house was likened to "dry bones" because they were in falsities and evils, which have no life because of their non-correspondence with heaven in respect to sinews, flesh, and skin, for "bones" signify truths in the ultimate of order, upon which spiritual truths are based, and "dry bones" signify falsities from evil; this makes clear that "to open the sepulchers and to cause the people to come up out of the sepulchers" signifies to raise up out of falsities from evil, thus from the dead, and to impart truths from good, thus life, which life is "the Spirit of God," from which they lived again; this is what is meant, therefore, by "causing the people to come up out of the sepulchers." The church that is to be formed out of these is signified by "the land of Israel" upon which they shall be placed. [15] It is related in Matthew:      That after the passion of the Lord the tombs were opened, and many bodies of those that slept coming out of their tombs went into the holy city, and appeared to many (Matt. 27:52, 53). That "the tombs were opened, and many bodies of them that slept appeared," has a similar signification as above in Ezekiel, where it is said that "Jehovah was to open the sepulchers and cause them to come up out of the sepulchers," namely, the regeneration and resurrection of the faithful unto life; not that the bodies themselves that lay in the tombs rose again, but that there was this appearance, that regeneration and resurrection to life from the Lord might be signified. Furthermore, these same words mean those who in the Word are said "to be bound in the pit," whom the Lord delivered when He had finished the whole work of redemption. For many of the faithful could not be saved until the Lord had come into the world and subjugated the hells; in the meanwhile they were detained in the places called "pits" until the Lord came, but were delivered by the Lord immediately after His coming. These pits were represented also by the "tombs" that were opened, and those who were in them by those that "slept," who after the Lord's resurrection, as it is said, "appeared to many in the holy city;" "the holy city" was Zion and Jerusalem, but by them heaven is meant, to which they were raised up by the Lord, for both Zion and Jerusalem were profane rather than holy. This makes evident what that miracle and that appearance represented and signified. [16] Since "the land of Canaan" signifies both the church and heaven, and "burial" signifies resurrection into life, so:      Abraham bought of Ephron a field in which was the cave of Machpelah which was before Mamre (Gen. 23);      And there Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with their wives, were buried (Gen. 23; 25:9, 10; 35:29; 49; 50). The particulars related concerning that cave, namely, that it was "in the field of Ephron, which was before Mamre," and many others, were significative of resurrection unto life (as may be seen explained in the Arcana Coelestia). For this reason Joseph also commanded:      That his bones should be brought up into the land of Canaan (Gen. 50:24-26);      And this was done (Exod. 13:19; Josh. 24:32); and for the reason that "the land of Canaan," as has been said, signified the heavenly Canaan, which is heaven. Because of the representation of resurrection into heaven by burial:      David and the kings after him were buried in Zion (1 Kings 2:10; 11:43; 14:17, 18; 15:8, 24; 22:50; 2 Kings 8:24; 12:21; 14:20; 15:7, 38; 16:20). This was because "Zion" signified the celestial church and heaven, where the Lord is. [17] That "burial" signifies resurrection can also be seen from this, that the dead are frequently said to have been "gathered to their fathers," and "to their peoples;" "to their fathers" in Genesis:      Jehovah said to Abraham, Thou shalt come to thy fathers in peace, and shalt be buried in a good old age (Gen. 15:15). And in the second book of Kings:      Jehovah said of Josiah, king of Judah, Behold I gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy sepulcher in peace (2 Kings 22:20). Also "to their people" in Genesis:      Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his peoples (Gen. 25:8);      Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his peoples, an old man and full of days (Gen. 35:29);      Jacob expired and was gathered to his peoples (Gen. 49:33).  "To their fathers" and "to their peoples" mean to their own, that is, to their like in the other life, for everyone after death comes to his like with whom he is to live forever. It cannot mean that they were gathered to their fathers and to their peoples in the sepulcher, for it is also said of Abraham when he died, that he "was gathered to his fathers" and that he was "gathered to his peoples," yet he was buried in a new tomb, where none of his fathers or of his peoples were before him, except Sarah his wife. [18] In Job:      Thou shalt know that thy tent is peace, and thy children as the herb of the land, thou shalt come in old age unto the sepulcher like the coming up of a heap of corn in its season (Job 5:24-26). A "tent" signifies in the Word the holiness of worship and the good of love, because Divine worship in most ancient times was performed in tents; and because their worship was from the good of celestial love, a "tent" signifies also that good; and since there is genuine peace in celestial good therefore it is said, "Thou shalt know that thy tent is peace." Truths from that good and their increase are signified by "the children which shall be as the herb of the land," for "sons" and "children" and likewise "the herb of the land" signify truths from good; that when wisdom has been imbibed one shall come into heaven is signified by "thou shalt come in old age into the sepulcher," "old age" signifying wisdom, and "to come into the sepulcher" or "to be buried" signifying resurrection; and as this is the meaning it is added, "like the coming up of a heap of corn in its season." [19] From these few passages it may appear that "sepulchers," by reason of the dead bodies and inanimate bones therein, signify things infernal, but that "burial" signifies the rejection of these and consequently resurrection; for when a man rejects or puts off his material body he puts on a spiritual body, with which he rises again. For this reason the very death of man signifies in the spiritual sense the continuation of his life, but in an evil sense it signifies damnation, which is spiritual death. As in respect to man "burial" signifies resurrection and also regeneration, therefore in respect to the Lord it signified the glorification of His Human; for the Lord glorified, that is, made Divine, His entire Human, consequently on the third day He rose again with the Human glorified, that is, made Divine. Unless this had been done, no man could have risen again to life; for man has resurrection unto life solely from the Lord, and indeed from His having united the Divine with His Human, and from this union, or strictly speaking, glorification, man has salvation; this is involved in:      What the Lord said of the woman who poured balsamic ointment upon His head, that she did it unto His burial (Matt. 26:7, 12; Mark 14:8; John 12:7); for "anointing" signifies that glorification; because from it man has salvation it is said of this woman:      Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her (Matt. 26:13).  This, too, was represented by:      The man that was cast into the sepulcher of Elisha, who revived when he touched his bones (2 Kings 13:20, 21). For "Elisha" represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and this constitutes the life of heaven into which man is raised up. [20] Since "to be buried" and "burial" signify both resuscitation into life and regeneration; so "not to be buried" and "to be dragged out of the tombs" signifies no resurrection to heaven nor regeneration, but resurrection to hell, and accordingly damnation, as in the following passages. In Isaiah:      Thou art cast out of thy sepulcher like an abominable shoot, the vesture of those that are slain, of those thrust through with the sword, that go down to the stones of the pit, like a carcass trodden down; thou shalt not be united with them in the sepulcher, for thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people; the seed of the wicked shall not be named forever (Isa. 14:19, 20). This is said of the king of Babylon, by whom the profanation of Divine truth is signified; therefore "thou art cast out of thy sepulcher" signifies damnation to hell; "like an abominable shoot, the vesture of those that are slain, of those thrust through with the sword," signifies the falsification of truth and its profanation; "an abominable shoot" means truth falsified, and "the vesture of those that are slain, of those thrust through with the sword," means truth adulterated and utterly destroyed by direful falsities; "that go down to the stones of the pit, like a carcass trodden down," signifies to the hell where the falsities of evil are, "a carcass trodden down" signifying an infernal spirit, with whom everything is spiritually dead because of the total destruction of good; "thou shalt not be united with them in the sepulcher" signifies no consociation with those who rise again to life, for "to be in the sepulcher or to be buried" signifies that resurrection, and on the other hand, "to be cast out of the sepulcher" signifies damnation; "thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people," signifies that the church and those therein who are in truths from good have been destroyed by the falsities of evil; "the seed of the wicked shall not be named forever" signifies eternal dissociation and separation. [21] In Jeremiah:      Jehovah hath said concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that shall bear them, and concerning their fathers that shall beget them in this land, They shall die of grievous deaths, that they may not be lamented, neither buried; they shall be for dung upon the faces of the earth, or they shall be consumed by the sword or by famine, that their carcass may be for food to the birds of the heavens and to the beast of the earth (Jer. 16:3, 4). This is said of the church vastated in respect to all good and truth; "sons and daughters, and mothers and fathers" do not mean in the spiritual sense sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, but the truths and goods of the church both exterior and interior, "sons and daughters" meaning exterior truths and goods, "mothers and fathers" interior truths and goods; these are called "mothers and fathers" because they beget and bring forth the exterior; "they shall die of grievous deaths, that they may not be lamented, neither buried," signifies condemnation to hell because of direful falsities; "they shall be for dung upon the faces of the earth" signifies infernal filth which is the evil that defiles the good and truth of the church; "to be consumed by the sword or by famine" signifies to be destroyed by falsities and evils; "that their carcass may be for food to the birds of the heavens and to the beast of the earth" signifies consumed and to be yet further consumed by the cupidities of the love of falsity and evil. [22] In the same:      A tumult cometh even to the end of the earth, for Jehovah hath a controversy against the nations; He shall enter judgment with all flesh, He shall give the wicked to the sword; the slain of Jehovah shall be in that day from the end of the earth even unto the end of the earth, they shall not be lamented nor gathered nor buried, they shall be as dung upon the faces of the earth (Jer. 25:31, 33). This describes the devastation of the church at its end when the Last Judgment takes place. "A tumult even to the end of the earth, for Jehovah hath a controversy against the nations," signifies the dismay of all who are of the church when they are visited and their evils are disclosed, the "earth" meaning the church, "nations" those who are in evils, and in an abstract sense evils, and "the controversy of Jehovah" against them visitation and disclosure.  "He shall enter judgment with all flesh" signifies the universal judgment that takes place at the end of the church; "He shall give the wicked to the sword" signifies that the unfaithful will perish by their falsities; "the slain of Jehovah shall be in that day from the end of the earth even unto the end of the earth" signifies those who perish by falsities of every kind, the "slain of Jehovah" meaning those who perish by falsities, and "from the end of the earth even unto the end of the earth" meaning from first things to last of the church, thus falsities of every kind; "they shall not be lamented nor gathered nor buried" signifies that there will be no more any restoration and salvation, but condemnation, "lamentation" signifying grief because such is the state of man, and "no lamentation" signifying no grief because man is such that there is no restoration; "they shall be for dung upon the faces of the earth" signifies mere falsity and evil with no reception of life from heaven; for if a man receives no life through the truths of faith and the goods of charity he is wholly dead, since he is in mere falsities of evil and evils of falsity, and such are "a carcass and dung upon the faces of the earth." [23] In the same:      Against prophets that prophesy a lie in the name of Jehovah: The people to whom they prophesy shall be cast in the streets of Jerusalem, because of famine and the sword, and there shall be none to bury them, themselves, their wives, and their sons and their daughters (Jer. 14:15, 16). Here, too, "not to be buried" means not to rise again to life but to damnation (the rest may be seen explained above, n. 652). In the same:      In that time they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah and the bones of his princes, and the bones of his priests and the bones of his prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, from their sepulchers, and they shall spread them to the sun and the moon and all the host of the heavens, which they have loved and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought and to which they have bowed themselves down; they shall not be gathered nor be buried, they shall be as dung upon the faces of the land (Jer. 8:1, 2). "To bring out the bones from the sepulchers" signifies to separate from the peoples, that is from communion with those who are in heaven, to cast out among the damned without, as takes place when the evil enter the societies of the good, and afterwards when discovered are cast out; for those that are buried are said "to be gathered to their peoples" as above of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; therefore "to be brought out of the sepulchers" means to be cast out from them. All who are of the church as well as all things of the church are signified by the "kings, princes, priests, prophets, and inhabitants of Jerusalem," "kings" signifying the truths themselves of the church in the whole complex, "princes" the chief truths, "priests" the goods of doctrine, "prophets" the truths of doctrine, and "the inhabitants of Jerusalem" all things of the church depending thereon. [24] Here the "bones of those that are to be brought out" signify the falsities and evils which have nothing in common with truths and goods; "to spread them out to the sun, the moon, and all the host of the heavens," signifies to give them over to diabolic loves, and thus to evils and falsities which are from hell; for the "sun" signifies love in both senses, the "moon" faith in both senses derived from that love, and "the host of the heavens" falsities and evils of every kind; so here "to spread out the bones" to these means to wholly give them over to such things, that they may be nothing but loves and cupidities of evil and falsity; "which they have loved, which they have served, after which they have walked, which they have sought and to which they have bowed themselves down," signifies an exterior and interior affection and proneness for such things, and worship therefrom; "they shall not be gathered nor be buried" signifies that they are never to return to the societies of heaven, but will remain with those who are in hell; "they shall be as dung upon the faces of the land" signifies what is dead and unclean, such as is cast out and trodden down. From this may appear what is signified by the following:      That Josiah the king took the bones out of the sepulchers and burned them upon the altar (2 Kings 23:16);      That the dogs in the field ate Jezebel, and there was none to bury her (2 Kings 9:10);      That Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, <a name="fr_305"></a><a href="#fn_305"><font size="1">659-2</font></a> king of Judah, was buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem (Jer. 22:19). [25] "To be buried in Topheth," and "in the valley of Hinnom" has a like signification in Jeremiah:      Behold the days come that it shall no more be said Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter; and they shall bury in Topheth till there is no place, and the carcass of this people shall be for food to the bird of the heavens and to the beast of the earth, and none shall frighten them away (Jer. 7:32, 33); and in the same:      I will break this people and this city as the vessel of a potter is broken, which cannot be repaired anymore; and they shall bury in Topheth, because there will be no place for burying, and I will make this city as Topheth (Jer. 19:11, 12). "Topheth" and "the valley of Hinnom" signify the hells, "Topheth" the hell at the back, which is called "the devil," and the "valley of Hinnom" the hell in front, which is called "Satan;" for in the city of Jerusalem and outside of it all places corresponded to places in the spiritual world; for in that world the dwelling places are according to Divine order; in the middle are those who are in the greatest light or wisdom, in the borders those who are in the least, to the east and west those who are in love, to the south and north those who are in intelligence; such is the arrangement of the whole heaven, and such it is in every society there, such in every city, and likewise also in every house, and this because the lesser forms in the heavens are all likenesses of the greatest form; and as "Jerusalem" signified heaven and the church in respect to doctrine, therefore also the places there were representative according to their quarters and distances from the temple and from Zion. This is why "Topheth" and "the valley of Hinnom," being most unclean and abominably idolatrous places, represented and thence signified the hells. Thence it appears what "burying in Topheth" and "in the valley of Hinnom" signifies. </p>

 <p>Verse 10. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and shall be glad, signifies delights from infernal love with those who are opposed to the goods and truths of the church. This is evident from the signification of "they that dwell upon the earth," as being those who are in the church, here those therein who are in evils and in falsities therefrom, thus who are opposed to its goods and truths; also from the signification of "rejoicing and being glad," as being here the delight of infernal love; for all joy and all gladness is of love, since everyone rejoices and is glad when his love is favored, and when he pursues and obtains what he loves; in a word, all the joy of man proceeds from his love and all the sadness and grief of mind from antagonism to his love. [2] It is said "rejoice and be glad" because of the marriage of good and truth; for "joy" is predicated of good because it relates to love, for it belongs especially to the heart and will, and "gladness" is predicated of truth, because it relates to the love of truth, for it belongs especially to the mind and its thought; therefore we speak of "joy of heart" and "gladness of mind." Everywhere in the Word there are two expressions, one of which has reference to good and the other to truth, and this because it is the conjunction of good and truth that makes both heaven and the church; therefore both heaven and the church are compared to a marriage, for the reason that the Lord is called "Bridegroom" and "Husband," and heaven and the church are called "bride" and "wife." Everyone, therefore, who is not in that marriage is not an angel of heaven nor a man of the church; and the reason is that there is no good with anyone unless it is formed by truths, nor is there truth with anyone unless it is made living by good; for every truth is a form of good, and all good is the being [esse] of truth, and as one is not possible without the other it follows that there must needs be a marriage of good and truth with the man of the church as well as with an angel of heaven. Moreover, all intelligence and wisdom are from that marriage, for from it truths and goods are continually born, by which the understanding and will are formed. [3] This has been said that it may be known why "to rejoice" and "to be glad" are both mentioned, namely, because "to rejoice" is predicated of good and its love or affection, and "to be glad" is predicated of truth and its love or affection. This is the case in many other passages in the Word, as in the following:      The heavens shall be glad and the earth shall rejoice (Ps. 96:11).      Let all that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee (Ps. 40:16; 70:4).      The righteous shall be glad and exult before God, and shall rejoice in gladness (Ps. 68:3).      That we may rejoice all our days, make us glad according to the days in which Thou hast afflicted us (Ps. 90:14, 15).      Be glad in Jerusalem and exult in her, all ye that love her, rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn over her (Isa. 66:10).      Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom (Lam. 4:21).      Behold joy and gladness, slaying the ox (Isa. 22:13).      They shall obtain joy and gladness, sorrow and sighing shall flee away (Isa. 35:10; 51:11).      Joy and gladness shall be found in Zion, confession and the voice of singing (Isa. 51:3).      They shall make <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_306"><font size="1">660-1</font></a> me to hear joy and gladness (Ps. 51:8).      Joy and gladness are cut off from the house of our God (Joel 1:16).      The fast of the tenth month shall be to the house of Judah for joy and for gladness (Zech. 8:19).      The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride (Jer. 7:34; 25:10; 33:11). [4] In place of joy exultation is also mentioned, because exultation, like joy, is predicated of good, because it relates to love, to the heart, and to the will; as in the following passages:      Jacob shall exult, Israel shall be glad (Ps. 14:7; 53:6).      I exult and am glad in Thy kindness (Ps. 31:7).      Be glad in Jehovah, and exult, ye righteous (Ps. 32:11).      Mount Zion shall be glad, and the daughters of Judah shall exult (Ps. 48:11).      Let all that trust in Thee be glad, and let them that love Thy name exult in Thee (Ps. 5:11).      This is the day that Jehovah hath made, let us exult and be glad in it (Ps. 118:24).      Let us exult and be glad in His salvation (Isa. 25:9).      Be ye glad and exult forever in the things which I create (Isa. 65:18).      Exult and be glad that Jehovah hath magnified in doing (Joel 2:21).      Exult, ye sons of Zion, and be glad in Jehovah your God (Joel 2:23; Hab. 3:18).      Be glad and exult with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem (Zeph. 3:14).      Gladness and exultation are taken away from Carmel (Isa. 16:10; Jer. 48:33).      The angel said unto Zacharias, Thou shalt have gladness and exultation, and many shall rejoice at His birth (Luke 1:14).  In all these passages, "exultation" signifies delight from love and from the affection of good, and "gladness" signifies pleasure from the love and affection of truth. </p>

 <p>And shall send gifts one to another, signifies their consociation. This is evident from the signification of "to send gifts," as being to be consociated by love and friendship through good will; for gifts from such an affection and disposition bring together both the well-disposed as well as the ill-disposed; here those are meant who are opposed to the goods of love and the truths of doctrine, which are signified by "the two witnesses" who were killed and cast forth into the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt. It is to be known that to the ill-disposed and wicked nothing is more delightful than to destroy the goods of love and the truths of doctrine wherever they are, and to do evil to those with whom these are; for such burn with hatred against these; consequently from the hell where such are there continually breathes forth a deadly hatred against celestial love and spiritual faith, and therefore against heaven, and especially against the Lord Himself; and as often as they are permitted to do evil they are in the delight of their heart. Such is the brutal nature of those who are in hell.  This, therefore, is what is meant by "they shall rejoice over them and shall be glad." Moreover, the wicked enter into friendships and consociate themselves for doing harm to the well disposed; they are consociated by the delight of hatred, which is the delight of their love; this makes them appear as if friends in heart, when yet they are enemies. This, therefore, is the signification of "shall send gifts one to another." [2] Because gifts captivate the mind and consociate, it was a custom in ancient times to give gifts to the priest and the prophet, as also to the prince and the king, when they were approached (1 Sam. 9:7, 8); and it was also a statute:      That they should not appear empty (that is, without a gift) before Jehovah, but in their feasts everyone should bring a gift according as he had been blessed (Exod. 23:15; 34:20; Deut. 16:16, 17). So too:      The wise men from the east brought gifts to the Lord just born, gold, frankincense, and myrrh (Matt. 2:11); according to the prediction in David (Ps. 72:10). So again:      The oblations upon the altar, which were sacrifices, and also the meal offerings and drink-offerings, were called gifts (Isa. 18:7; 57:6; 66:20; Zeph. 3:10; Matt. 5:23, 24; and elsewhere); and this because external gifts signified internal or spiritual gifts, namely, such as go forth from the heart, and thence are of the affection and faith; and as by these conjunction is effected, in the spiritual sense "gifts" in reference to God signify conjunction, and in reference to men consociation. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="662.">662.</a></font></span>
 <p>Because those two prophets tormented them that dwell upon the earth, signifies anxiety of heart in the devastated church on account of these. This is evident from the signification of "the two witnesses," who are here called "two prophets," as being the goods and truths of doctrine; also from the signification of "tormenting," as being anxiety of heart; also from the signification of "them that dwell upon the earth," as being those who live in the church, here in the devastated church. Therefore these words signify the anxiety of heart from the goods of love and the truths of doctrine with those who are of the devastated church; for here the end of the church is treated of, when the loves of self and of the world, and their lusts and the evils and falsities of those lusts, have rule. Then men are tormented by the goods of love and the truths of doctrine, because inwardly or in their hearts they hate them, howsoever they may profess them with their lips; and when anything that is hated enters there is inward torment; and yet such a man of the church does not know, so long as he lives in the world, that he has so great hate for these two witnesses, and that he is inwardly tormented by them, for the reason that he does not know the state of his interior thought and affection, but only the state of his exterior thought and affection, which falls immediately into speech. But when he comes into the spiritual world his exterior thought and affection are laid asleep, and the interior are opened, and then he feels so great a repugnance from hatred against the goods of love and the truths of doctrine that he cannot endure hearing them. When, therefore, such a man enters any angelic society where spiritual love and faith rule he is grievously tormented, which is a sign of interior repugnance from hatred against love and faith. This makes clear what is signified by "those two prophets tormented them that dwell upon the earth." "Them that dwell upon the earth" mean those in the church who are in good in respect to life, but here those who are in evil, for such are interiorly tormented by the goods of love and the truths of doctrine. That "to dwell" signifies to live, and thus life, can be seen from passages in the Word, where "to dwell" is mentioned (Isa. 9:2; 13:20; 37:16; Jer. 2:6, 15; 51:13; Dan. 2:22; 4:9; Ezek. 31:6; Hos. 9:2, 3; Ps. 23:6; 27:4; 80:1; 101:7; Zeph. 3:6; and elsewhere). </p>

 <p>Verses 11, 12. And after the three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon them that beheld them. And they heard a great voice out of heaven saying unto them, Come up hither! And they went up into heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them. 11. "And after the three days and a half," signifies when it is finished, thus the end of the old church and the beginning of the New Church (n. 664); "the spirit of life from God entered into them," signifies enlightenment and the reception of the influx of Divine truth from the Lord with some for the beginning of the New Church (n. 665); "and they stood upon their feet," signifies a new life such as the regenerated man of the church has (n. 666); "and great fear fell upon them that beheld them," signifies a state of anxiety with those who did not receive and acknowledge (n. 667). 12. "And they heard a great voice out of heaven saying unto them," signifies the Lord's Divine providence (n. 668); "Come up hither," signifies separation and consequent protection (n. 669); "and they went up into heaven in the cloud," signifies separation in respect to things internal, and their protection (n. 670); "and their enemies beheld them," signifies knowledge and acknowledgment with those who are interiorly opposed to the goods and truths of the Word and of the church (n. 671). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="664.">664.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 11. And after the three days and a half, signifies when it is finished, thus the end of the old church and the beginning of the New Church. This is evident from the signification of "the three days and a half," as being fullness and completion as to the end of the old church, when there is the beginning of the New Church (see above, n. 658). It is said "after the three days and a half" because in the Word "days" signify states, here the last state of the church; for in the Word all times, as "hours," "days," "weeks," "months," "years," "ages," signify states, as here the last state of the church, when there is no longer any good of love or truth of faith left. Because "days" signify states, and the establishment of the Most Ancient Church is treated of in the first chapter of Genesis, and it becomes established successively from one state to another, it is there said:      That there was evening and there was morning the first day, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, and the sixth days, even to the seventh, when it was finished (Gen. 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31; 2:2); and the "days" there do not mean days, but the successive states of the regeneration of men at that time, and the consequent establishment of the church with them. So also elsewhere in the Word. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="665.">665.</a></font></span>
 <p>The spirit of life from God entered into them, signifies enlightenment and the reception of Divine truth from the Lord with some for the beginning of the New Church. This is evident from the signification of "the spirit of life from God," as being the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord (of which presently); also from the signification of "entering into them," namely, into the "witnesses" that were slain and cast forth, as being enlightenment and reception of influx, namely, of Divine truth, which is signified by "the spirit of life;" it means also with some for establishing the New Church, as is evident from the following verse, where it is said that "they went up into heaven in the cloud," thus it is meant with some, for "the two witnesses" signify the goods of love and the truths of doctrine, also they mean those with whom these goods and truths are, for all such are "witnesses." [2] When the end of the church is at hand then it is provided by the Lord that a New Church shall succeed, for without a church in which is the Word and in which the Lord is known, the world cannot subsist; for without the Word, and thence the knowledge and acknowledgment of the Lord, heaven cannot be conjoined to the human race, nor therefore can the Divine proceeding from the Lord flow in with new life; and without conjunction with heaven and through that with the Lord, man would not be a man, but a beast. This is why a New Church is always provided by the Lord when an old church comes to its end. Why the beginning only of the New Church and not yet its establishment is meant, shall be told in the explanation of the following verse. [3] That "the spirit of life from God" or "the Spirit of God," and "the Holy Spirit," mean the Divine proceeding from the Lord, which is called the Divine truth, from which is all wisdom and intelligence, has been said and shown above (n. 24, 183, 318). This Divine proceeding is what enlightens man and flows into him when he is being reformed and regenerated, thus when the church is commencing and being established with him, as can be plainly seen from the passages quoted above from the Word (n. 183), also from this in Ezekiel:      Jehovah said unto me, Prophesy about the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say unto the wind, Thus the Lord Jehovih hath said, Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe into these slain, that they may live. And when I had prophesied the spirit entered into them, and they revived and stood upon their feet, a very great army (Ezek. 37:9, 10). [4] This treats of "the dry bones" seen by the prophet upon the face of the valley, which signify the house of Israel, as is plainly declared in verse 11 of that chapter. "The house of Israel" signifies the church, and that house or church is here compared to "dry bones" because it had no good of love or truth of doctrine. The establishment of a New Church by the inbreathing of a new life, or by regeneration, is described by the "sinews, flesh, and skin," with which the bones were clothed and encompassed, and especially by the "spirit" that entered into them, and from which they lived; the "spirit" in them here signifies also the reception of the influx of Divine truth and consequent spiritual life. The prophet said to the wind, "Come from the four winds, O spirit," because "the four winds" signify the four quarters in the spiritual world, and the four quarters there signify the goods of love and the truths of doctrine in the whole complex. (On the signification of these see above, n. 417, 418, 419, 422, and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 141-150.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="666.">666.</a></font></span>
 <p>And they stood upon their feet, signifies a new life, such as the regenerate man of the church has. This is evident from the signification of "standing," as meaning to be and to live, and also to sustain (see above, n. 414); also from the signification of "feet," as being the natural, which is the ultimate of Divine order, and the base upon which prior or higher things rest, and upon which they subsist (see above, n. 69, 600, 606); so "to stand upon the feet" signifies life in fullness, because in the ultimate. A new life is signified because the "witnesses" who are here treated of were killed and lived again. "To stand upon the feet" here means such life as the regenerate man of the church has, because this is said of "the two witnesses," by whom all who are in the goods of love through the truths of doctrine are meant, who are such as have been regenerated; also because when the natural, which is signified by the "feet," has been regenerated, the whole man has life such as the regenerated man has. [2] This the Lord teaches in John:      Jesus said to Peter, He that hath bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is all clean (John 13:10). "To wash" signifies to be purified from evils and falsities, which is to be regenerated, therefore "he that hath bathed" signifies he that has been purified, that is, regenerated in respect to the spiritual, which is the good of love and the truth of doctrine; these must first be received in the memory and understanding, that is, must be known and acknowledged. "Needeth not save to wash his feet" signifies that the natural or external man must then be purified or regenerated, which is done by a life according to the precepts of love and faith, that is, according to the goods and truths of doctrine from the Word. As this is done the man himself is purified or regenerated; for to live according to the goods and truths of doctrine from the Word is to will them and thence to do them, which is the same as to be affected by them and to love them; for what comes to be of the will comes to be of the affection and love, and therefore of the man himself; for the will is the very man, since a man is his own love and his own affection. This is why it is said that then "the whole man is clean." [3] From this it is clear why "to stand upon the feet" means such life as a regenerate man has. Therefore of "the dry bones" seen by the prophet on the face of the valley, when they had been covered with sinews, flesh, and skin, it is said:      When I had prophesied about the spirit, the spirit entered into them, and they revived and stood upon their feet (Ezek. 37:10). Here also "to stand upon the feet" signifies a new life, such as the regenerate man has; for "the dry bones" to which the house of Israel is likened signify the state of the church with them, namely, that it had no goods of love or truths of doctrine; and "being clothed with sinews, flesh, and skin" signifies regeneration; and "the spirit that entered in" signifies a new life through the influx and reception of Divine truth; therefore it is then said that "they revived and stood upon their feet." [4] "To stand upon the feet" has the same signification elsewhere in the same prophet:      A voice speaking to me said, Son of man, stand upon thy feet that I may speak to thee; then the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and stood me upon my feet, and I heard him that spake to me (Ezek. 2:1, 2). And again:      I fell upon my face, but the spirit entered into me and raised me upon my feet (Ezek. 3:23, 24). This was done because "to stand upon the feet" signifies life itself when it is in its fullness; and life is in its fullness when the natural lives from the spiritual. For the ultimate of man's life is in his natural; this ultimate is like a base to man's interior and higher parts; for these close into the ultimate and subsist in it, consequently unless life is in the ultimate it is not full, and thus not perfect. Moreover, all things interior or higher exist together in the ultimate as in their simultaneous. For this reason such as the ultimate is such are the interior or higher parts, for these adapt themselves to the ultimate because it receives them. [5] "To stand upon the feet" has a similar signification in David:      Thou hast made my feet to stand in a broad place (Ps. 31:8). "A broad place" signifies the truth of doctrine from the Word, therefore "to make my feet to stand in a broad place" signifies to cause one to live according to Divine truths. Again, in the same:      He made me come up out of the pit of devastation, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock (Ps. 40:2). "The pit of devastation" signifies the falsity of doctrine, and "the miry clay" the evil of life; and "to set the feet upon a rock" has a similar signification as above, "to make the feet to stand in a broad place," for "rock" signifies the truth of doctrine from the Word, and in the highest sense, the Lord in relation to Divine truth. Thence it is clear what is signified in the spiritual sense by:      Jehovah will not suffer my <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_307"><font size="1">666-1</font></a> foot to totter (Ps. 121:3); namely, that he will not suffer the natural to go astray from truths; for so far as the natural goes astray, so far the interiors which belong to the understanding and will, also go astray. </p>
 
 
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="667.">667.</a></font></span>
 <p>And great fear fell upon them that beheld them, signifies a state of anxiety with those who did not receive and acknowledge. This is evident from the signification of "great fear," as being a state of anxiety, for "fear" signifies in the Word various changes of state of man's interiors, so here, a state of anxiety; also from the signification of "upon them that beheld them," as being in those who could not endure the presence of the witnesses, and who therefore killed them and cast them out, and who therefore had grief of mind and anxiety of heart when they saw them alive, consequently it means with those that have not received and acknowledged the good of love and the truth of doctrine. This describes the state of those who are opposed to the goods of love and the truths of doctrine, at the end of the old and the beginning of the New Church; such then come into anxiety from the presence of those who receive love to the Lord and faith in Him, of whom the New Church is constituted; but this takes place in the spiritual world, not in the natural world; for in the spiritual world there is a communication of affections; and spiritual affection, which belongs to love to the Lord and faith in Him, and which then has a beginning with some, smites the evil with such anxiety. This, therefore, is what is meant by "great fear fell upon them that beheld them." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="668.">668.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 12. And they heard a great voice out of heaven, saying unto them, signifies the Lord's Divine Providence. This is evident from the signification of "a great voice out of heaven," as being the Lord's Divine Providence. "A voice out of heaven" signifies all that proceeds from the Lord, which in general is called Divine truth, and with us in the world is called the Word; thus in particular every precept and command in the Word is meant; this is called "a voice out of heaven" because it descended and is continually descending from the Lord through heaven with those who read the Word from the spiritual affection of truth. The Lord's Divine Providence is here signified by "a voice out of heaven," because the subject treated of is the state of heaven and the state of the church at its end, when the Lord provides against any sudden change that would do harm to those who are to be separated, some of whom are to come into heaven and some to be cast into hell. Therefore it now follows that the two witnesses by command "went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them," and this that there might be a separation, lest the successive progress of affairs according to order might be disturbed by their presence with the evil and the consequent communication (of which above). This arcanum, however, cannot be described in a few words, but in what follows it will be elucidated as far as possible. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="669.">669.</a></font></span>
 <p>Come up hither, signifies separation and consequent protection. This is evident from the signification of "going up into heaven" when said of the witnesses, by whom the goods of love and the truths of doctrine are signified, as being to be separated from those that have no goods of love and truths of doctrine, thus to be separated from the evil. And as the reason for separation is that these, namely, the good of love and the truth of doctrine, may not be harmed by the evil, therefore "come up hither" signifies also protection. For if the good of love and the truth of doctrine were communicated to the evil they would receive them in an outward way, but would do them harm by inwardly denying and mocking them. Thence it would come to pass that the evil would be conjoined with the simple well-disposed, who are unable to perceive that the interiors of such are evil. These simple well-disposed constitute the lowest heaven; therefore if this separation were not effected, harm would be done to those who are in that heaven by their being conjoined with the externals of the evil (but on this see further in the small work on The Last Judgment, n. 70). This is what is involved in the command to the two witnesses "to go up into heaven," and by this also protection is signified. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="670.">670.</a></font></span>
 <p>And they went up into heaven in the cloud, signifies separation in respect to things internal, and their protection. This is evident from the signification of "going up into heaven," in reference to the two witnesses, as being separation from the evil, that is, from those who are in the falsities of doctrine from evils of life, and also protection (see preceding article, n. 669); also from the signification of "the cloud," as being the ultimate of Divine truth, or the external of the Word, which is called the sense of its letter (of which above, n. 36, 594). Many of the evil also are in this external, for all who lead an evil life think in themselves in opposition to the goods and truths of the Word, of doctrine, and of the church, although they may be in the externals of these, and for this reason, that from the life they are in the love of evil, and love draws to its own side the interiors of the mind, thus the thoughts of its spirit, consequently when such are left to think alone by themselves they wholly deny those things that they confess with their lips before the world. It is this external, which is also with the impious and the evil, that is here meant by "the cloud." For this reason, by "they went up into heaven in the cloud," separation in respect to internals is meant, but not in respect to externals. Separation in respect to internals is meant, and not in respect to externals, because the internals of the two witnesses were spiritual and celestial, while the internals of the evil were infernal and diabolical; and internals that are celestial and spiritual are actually in heaven; therefore they are said to have "gone up thither," in order that as to internals they might be separated from the evil, that their internals might not be harmed. [2] A few words shall be said to make known what in particular is involved in "the going up into heaven of the two witnesses that were slain and lived again." At the end of the church, when there is no faith because there is no charity, the interior things of the Word which are to serve the New Church for doctrine and life are disclosed. This was done by the Lord Himself, when the end of the Jewish Church was at hand; for the Lord Himself then came into the world and opened the interiors of the Word, especially those relating to Himself, love to Him and love towards the neighbor, and faith in Him, which before lay hidden in the interiors of the Word, since they were in its representatives, and thence in the particular things of the church and of worship. These truths, therefore, that were disclosed by the Lord were interior truths, and in themselves spiritual; and these afterwards served the New Church for doctrine and life, as has been said just above. These truths, however, were not immediately received, nor until after a considerable lapse of time, as is well known from ecclesiastical history; and for the reason that they could not be received until all things in the spiritual world had been reduced to order; for as the spiritual world is conjoined to the natural world with men, so unless that world had been first reduced to order, men in the natural world could not have understood or perceived the goods of love and the truths of doctrine; this is why so long a time intervened before the Christian Church was universally established in the European world; for all effects that exist in the natural world derive their origin from causes in the spiritual world, especially those that relate to the things of the church. These things have been said to make known what is signified in particular by the command to the two witnesses "to go up into heaven," namely, that no harm be done by the evil to the goods of love and the truths of doctrine that are disclosed in the last time of the church. [3] It was similar when the Most Ancient Church, which was before the flood, came to its end, for then the representatives of celestial things, which existed among the most ancient people, were gathered up into one body by those who were called "Enoch," and were preserved for the use of the New Church after the flood; and this was called a representative church, because its laws and statutes, and in general its worship, consisted of representatives, or of such things in the natural world as corresponded to spiritual things in the spiritual world. The like was done with these, that is, they were separated from the evil by being taken into heaven and thus protected, and this till the old church came to its end, when a New Church was to be established. This is described by these words in Genesis:      And Enoch walked with God and he was no more, for God took him (Gen. 5:24). That such is the signification of "Enoch, and his walking before God, and being taken by God" may be seen in Arcana Coelestia (n. 518-523), where this is explained. [4] The like is done at the present day. This church, which is called Christian, has at this day come to its end, therefore the arcana of heaven and the church have now been revealed by the Lord, to serve as the doctrine of life and faith for the New Church, which is meant by "the New Jerusalem" in Revelation. This doctrine, too, has been taken up into heaven lest harm be done to it by the evil before the establishment of the New Church. Such, therefore, is the signification of this respecting the two witnesses, that "they went up into heaven;" also of what follows in the next chapter, where it treats of "the woman about to bring forth a child," before whom stood the dragon:      That the child was caught up to God and to His throne (Rev. 12:5). What is there meant in particular by the "woman" and the "child" will be told in the explanation of the next chapter. From this it can now be seen what arcanum is involved in what is here said of the two witnesses that by command "they went up into heaven in the cloud." </p>

 <p>And their enemies beheld them, signifies the knowledge and acknowledgment with those who are interiorly opposed to the goods and truths of the Word and of the church. This is evident from the signification of "to behold," as being to understand, consequently to know and to acknowledge (of which above, n. 11, 37, 260, 354, 529); also from the signification of "enemies," as being those who are opposed to the goods of love and the truths of doctrine, consequently those who are in evils and falsities, for these are meant in the Word in its spiritual sense by "enemies and adversaries." Thence it is clear that "their enemies beheld them" signifies the knowledge and acknowledgment with those who are against "the two witnesses," that is, against the goods of love and the truths of doctrine. [2] The arcanum here involved is this: "Enemies" here mean those who are inwardly opposed to the goods of love and the truths of doctrine, but still not outwardly; for such with the mouth act like friends, but in heart they are enemies; therefore before the world they profess a belief in goods and truths, but in their spirit, in which they are when they meditate alone with themselves, they reject them. These are the "enemies who behold," for when such are in corporeal-natural thought, in which they are whenever they are in company with others, they see, that is, know and acknowledge, goods and truths. But when they are in their spiritual-natural thought, in which they are whenever they are alone and are thinking about matters of belief, they do not acknowledge. This is why it is said that "these two witnesses went up into heaven in the cloud;" for the "cloud" signifies the external of the Word, of the church, and of worship, which they see and from which they see. That the "cloud" here signifies this external may be seen in the article just above. [3] In a multitude of passages in the Word, "adversaries" and "enemies" are mentioned, and by them evils and falsities are meant, evils by "adversaries," and falsities by "enemies;" for the Word in its bosom is spiritual, therefore in that sense no other than spiritual adversaries and enemies can be meant by "adversaries and enemies." That this is so can be seen from the following passages. In David:      Jehovah, how are my adversaries multiplied, many are they that rise up against me, that say of my soul, There is no salvation for him in God (Ps. 3:1, 2). In the same:      Make wonderful Thy mercy, O Thou Savior of them that confide in Thee from them that rise up against me, <a name="fr_308"></a><a href="#fn_308"><font size="1">671-1</font></a> keep me by Thy right hand from the wicked who are against my soul, who compass me about (Ps. 17:7-9). In the same:      Give me not up to the desire of my adversaries, for witnesses of a lie are risen up against me, who puff out violence; unless I had believed to see good in the land of life (Ps. 27:12, 13). In the same-      Deliver me from my adversaries, O my God, set me on high from them that rise against me, deliver me from the workers of iniquity; behold they lie in wait for my soul (Ps. 59:1-3). In Isaiah:      The wicked man acteth perversely in the land of uprightness; but Jehovah, Thy hand is exalted, fire shall devour Thine enemies (Isa. 26:10, 11); besides many other passages in the prophetic Word, where "adversaries and enemies" are mentioned, and also in the historic Word, where "adversaries," "wars," and "battles" are treated of. For as "war" signifies spiritual war, which is between truths and falsities, and thence weapons of war, such as "spears," "bows," "arrows," and "swords," signify such things as belong to spiritual warfare, so also do "adversaries and enemies." (That "wars" in the Word have this signification, also weapons of war, such as "bows," "arrows," and "swords," has here and there been shown in the preceding pages.) </p>

 <p>Verse 13. And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and there were killed in the earthquake names of men seven thousand; and the rest became afraid, and gave glory to the God of heaven. 13. "And in that hour," signifies during that state (n. 673); "there was a great earthquake," signifies a notable change of state of the interiors with those who are of the church (n. 674); "and the tenth part of the city fell," signifies that no truths of doctrine any longer existed with those who remained (n. 675); "and there were killed in the earthquake names of men seven thousand," signifies that in that change of state all truths of good also perished with them, and thus all things of heaven and the church (n. 676); "and the rest became afraid," signifies the commotion of mind and turning away of those who were to some extent spiritual (n. 677); "and gave glory to the God of heaven," signifies that they acknowledged and worshipped the Lord (n. 678). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="673.">673.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 13. And in that hour, signifies during that state. This is evident from the signification of "hour," as being state, so here that state when "the two witnesses went up into heaven, and their enemies beheld them." "Hour" signifies state, because in the Word times and all expressions pertaining to time, like "hours," "days," "weeks," "months," "years," "ages," as also "morning," "noon," "evening," "night," likewise "spring," "summer," "autumn," and "winter," signify states of life. (That times have this signification has been illustrated and shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 162-169, where Time in Heaven is treated of; also above, n. 571, 610, 664; and that "hour" signifies any duration of state, greater or less, thus time and state, see above, n. 194; and that the number adjoined defines what is the quality of the state, n. 488.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="674.">674.</a></font></span>
 <p>There was a great earthquake, signifies a notable change of state of the interiors with those who are of the church. This is evident from the signification of "a great earthquake," as being a notable change of the state of the church; for the "earth" signifies the church, "quaking" change of state, and "great" what is notable. (That an "earthquake" signifies in the Word a change of state of the church, see above, n. 400, 499.) [2] The change of state in respect to the truths and goods of the church evidently sprang from causes that are described in the preceding verse, that is, because the two witnesses that had been killed and restored to life went up by command into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them. Thence it may be seen that the cause of this was the separation of the good from the evil, as has been shown in the preceding articles, where the going up of the two witnesses is explained. But this cannot be presented to the understanding unless it first be told how things are in the spiritual world; for the things described in this verse, namely, that "there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and there were killed in the earthquake names of men seven thousand, and the rest became afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven," are things that take place, and in fact have already taken place at the time when the Last Judgement was at hand, but in the spiritual world, and not in the natural world; for when the good there are to be separated from the evil, and the good are to be protected from being harmed by the evil, then the good are taken away from the societies and the evil are left, according to the Lord's words in Matthew:      Two [men] shall be in the field, one shall be taken, the other shall be left; two [women] shall be grinding, one shall be taken, the other shall be left (Matt. 24:40, 41). This may be seen explained in the Arcana Coelestia (n. 4334, 4335). When the good are taken away there occurs in the societies in which the good and evil had been together, a notable change in respect to the things that pertain to the church. [3] But the cause of this change shall be further disclosed. In the spiritual world there is a communication of all affections, and sometimes of thoughts; and within each society there is a general communication, extending itself from the middle of the society in every direction even to the boundaries, much as light spreads forth from a center to the circumferences. The variations and changes of the affections that arise from this communication and its extension spring from an influx of the affections from other societies, either above or at the sides, also from the newcomers that enter the society, and also from a few or many being taken away from the society. [4] The societies upon which the Last Judgment came consisted both of the good and of the evil, but of such evil as were interiorly but not exteriorly opposed to the goods of love and the truths of doctrine; for exteriorly these were able to act rightly and justly and to speak piously and truly, not however for the sake of the right, of justice, of piety, and of truth, but from habit acquired in the world, for the sake of fame, glory, honor, gain, and the various delights of the natural loves, also on account of the laws and their penalties. For this reason, although they were interiorly evil, yet they could be together with those who were both exteriorly and interiorly good. When, therefore, the good were to be separated from those who merely appeared good in external form, their external good vanished, and their internal evil appeared; for they were held in that external good by communication with those within the same society who were not only exteriorly but also interiorly good, as has been said above. So when external good was taken away from the evil their interiors were opened; and these were full of mere evil and filthy things, which made evident of what quality they were in themselves. Such, then, is what is meant in particular by "the two witnesses going up by command into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beholding them;" and here that "in that hour there was a great earthquake," namely, that when that state came a notable change took place in respect to those things that pertain to the church. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="675.">675.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the tenth part of the city fell, signifies that no truths of doctrine any longer existed with those who remained. This is evident from the signification of "ten," as being all persons and all things, also many persons and many things, and of "the tenth part," as being all and much (of which presently); also from the signification of "city," as being doctrine and also the truth of doctrine, for a doctrine, that it may be a doctrine of the church, must consist of truths from the Word (that a "city" signifies doctrine see above, n. 223). It is evident also from the signification of "to fall," as being to be separated, consequently to have no existence; to be separated and to have no existence is predicated of truths of doctrine when "to fall" is predicated of a city. [2] For every particular thing has allotted to it its analogous and proper expression, according to the correspondence of the subject in the natural sense with the subject in the spiritual sense; and here the subject in the natural sense is a city, while the subject in the spiritual sense is the truth of doctrine. That no truths existed with those that remained follows from what has been said in the preceding article, namely, that when the good are taken away from a society in which the good and the evil have been together, and are carried up into heaven, no truths of doctrine any longer remain with the evil, because they are then deprived of their communication with the good which enabled them as to the external to be as it were in truths, and thence to speak about truths from doctrine. [3] For in the spiritual world there is a communication of the affections and thence of the thoughts, and from such communication one is held by another, thus all in the same society mutually, in a like affection and accordingly in a like good; thus are the evil also held by the good. But these evil were such as were able in external form to put on an appearance of sanctity, of piety, of intelligence, of zeal for the church and its doctrine, also in the life an appearance of being just and sincere from the heart, and yet interiorly in themselves they possessed nothing of such good. Such were the evil, with whom there could no longer exist any truths of doctrine, after the good were taken away, who are meant by "the two witnesses" that went up by command into heaven. [4] It is to be known that there were in the spiritual world many societies formed of such, and that these societies taken together are meant by "the first heaven" which passed away (Rev. 21:1). (Respecting these societies or that heaven, many things are related in the small work on The Last Judgment.) In these societies were such evil persons as have been described, and the good associated with them; and so long as these were conjoined in one society the evil appeared in externals like the good; but when they had been separated, then the external good in them, which was only simulated and hypocritical, was separated, and their interiors were laid open, which were infernal, filled with mere evils and falsities therefrom. Such a separation and such a consequent state existed in the spiritual world a little before the Last Judgment; this, therefore, is the state that is here described; for the last time of the church, when the universal judgment is at hand, is here treated of. [5] That "ten" signifies all persons and all things, also many persons and many things, can be seen from the passages in the Word where that number occurs. As in Moses:      Jehovah hath commanded unto you His covenant which He covenanted <a name="fr_309"></a><a href="#fn_309"><font size="1">675-1</font></a> you to do, the ten words which He wrote upon two tables of stone (Deut. 4:13). And again:      Jehovah wrote upon the tables according to the former writing, the ten words which Jehovah spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire (Deut. 10:4).  There were "ten words" or "ten commandments" constituting the Decalogue, because "ten" signifies all things, therefore "the ten words" mean the law in its whole complex. [6] As "ten" signifies all persons:      The Lord compared the kingdom of the heavens to ten virgins having lamps with which to go forth to meet the bridegroom, of whom five were prudent and five foolish (Matt. 25:1, 2, et seq.). "The ten virgins" to whom the kingdom of the heavens is likened signify all who are of the church, for "ten" signifies all, and "virgins" the church; but "five" signifies some, or some part, for some of the church were prudent and some foolish. Such is the signification of the number "five" in the Word. "Lamps" signify the knowledges of truth and good, here from the Word, also the truths of doctrine and of faith; "oil" signifies the good of love and of charity; the "bridegroom" means the Lord, and the "wedding" means heaven and the church, which are called a "wedding" from the marriage of good and truth; and as where there is not this marriage there is neither heaven nor the church, therefore those are called "foolish" who know the truths of faith and have no good of love, while those who have the good of love are called "prudent;" for, as has been said, "lamps" here mean the truths of faith, and "oil" the good of love. "Virgins" signify the church, because "virgin" and "daughter" in the Word signify the affection of good and truth, and it is because of that affection that the church is a church. This is why "the virgin and daughter of Zion," "the virgin and daughter of Jerusalem," "the virgin and daughter of Israel" and "of Judah," are mentioned in so many passages, these everywhere meaning the church. [7] As "ten" signifies all as also many:      The Lord said of the nobleman who went into a far country, that he called his ten servants and gave them ten pounds [minas] to trade with; and after they had traded, one said that his pound had gained ten pounds; to him he said, Thou shalt have authority over ten cities; and the second said, Thy pound hath made five pounds; to him he said, Be thou over five cities; and of the third, who laid up his pound in a napkin, and did not trade, he said, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds (Luke 19:12-14, 16-20, 24). Here, too, the numbers "ten" and "five" are employed because "ten" signifies all persons and all things, and "five" some persons and some things. "The ten servants" whom the nobleman going into a far country called to him, mean all who are in the world, and in particular, all who are of the church; for the "nobleman" means the Lord, and "going into a far country" means the Lord's departure out of the world and His then seeming to be absent; "the ten pounds that he gave to the ten servants to trade with" signify all the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, with the ability to perceive them; for a "pound" [mina], which was silver and was money, signifies the knowledges of truth and the ability to perceive; and "to trade" signifies by means of these to acquire intelligence and wisdom; those who acquire much are meant by the servant who from a pound gained ten pounds; and those who acquire some are meant by him who from a pound gained five pounds; the "cities which are said to be given them" signify the truths of doctrine, and "to possess them" signifies intelligence and wisdom, and life and happiness therefrom. Thence it is clear what is signified by "ten cities" and by "five cities." As those who acquire nothing of intelligence are like the "foolish virgins" (of whom just above), and as these possess truths in the memory only and not in the life, after their departure from this world they are deprived of truths, while those who possess truths both in the memory and in the life enrich themselves in intelligence to eternity, so it is said that "they should take away the pound from him who gained nothing with it, and should give it to him who had ten pounds." [8] It is similar with those:      To whom talents were given, to one five, to another two, and to a third one; the first of whom from his five talents gained another five; and the second from two talents gained other two; and the third laid away his talent in the earth, of whom the Lord said, Take from him that hath not traded and gained, and give to him that hath ten talents, for unto everyone that hath shall be given that he may abound, and from him that hath not even that which he hath shall be taken away (Matt. 25:14-30). Here, too, "five" and "ten" also signify something and much; thus, that the first from some knowledges of truth and good acquired much wisdom. It is taken away from him who has acquired nothing of intelligence and is given to him who has much, because when man after death becomes a spirit he carries with him all things, and every single thing that he has drawn from the Word and from the doctrine of the church. But those who through these have acquired nothing of intelligence are interiorly evil, and therefore misuse the truths and goods of heaven and the church, which they possess in the memory only, in exercising dominion over the simple good who are in the lowest heaven, and in doing evil to them. This is why these truths and goods are taken away from them and are given to those who have many, since these do not misuse them, but from them perform uses. [9] Those who do not acquire spiritual intelligence in the world through the knowledges of truth and good from the Word are evil, as can be seen from this, that all are born into evils of every kind, and these evils are removed only by means of Divine truths from the Word, that is, by applying truths to uses, and thus receiving them in the life. So to those who have gained it is said:      Good and faithful servants, ye have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter ye into the joy of your Lord (verses 21, 23); and to him who had gained nothing:      Cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth (verse 30). [10] Because "ten" signifies all and much, therefore that number is used by the Lord also in other passages, where all and much must be understood. As in Luke:      Of the woman having ten drachmas, if she lose one, doth she not light a candle and sweep the house and seek carefully till she find it? (Luke 15:8) "Ten" here signifies much. This is said of a "woman," and that "she would light a candle and sweep the house" because of the spiritual sense in every particular of the Word. In that sense a "woman" signifies the church in respect to the affection of truth, thus also the affection of truth itself which belongs to the church; the "drachma" signifies truth; "to lose the drachma" signifies to lose one of the truths or the knowledges of truth; "to light a candle" signifies self-examination from affection; "to sweep the house" signifies to traverse the whole mind and to examine every particular where the truth lies hidden. This is the spiritual sense of these words. "A hundred" has the same signification as "ten," namely, much; therefore a similar parable speaks of:      A hundred sheep, if one is lost (Matt. 18:12, 13; Luke 15:3-7). [11] "Ten" signifies all and much also in the following passages. In Isaiah:      Many houses great and fair <a name="fr_310"></a><a href="#fn_310"><font size="1">675-2</font></a> shall become a waste without inhabitant; for ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath (Isa. 5:9, 10). This is said of the desolation of truth with those who are of the church. "Many houses which shall become a waste" signify the men of the church, and in particular, such in respect to truths from good; "great and fair," that is, houses, signifies the affection of good and the understanding of truth, for "great" is predicated of good and its affection, and "fair" is predicated of truth and its intelligence; "ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath" signifies that in all things of the church with man there is scarcely any truth from good, for a "bath" has also a similar signification as wine, namely, truth from good; therefore "ten acres of vineyard" signify all things of the church with man. [12] In Moses:      If ye will go contrary to Me I will break for you the staff of bread, that ten women may bake your bread in one oven, and I will bring back your bread by weight (Lev. 26:23, 26). "To break the staff of bread" signifies to deprive of spiritual food, and thus of spiritual nourishment, for "bread" means everything that nourishes the soul, and in particular the good of love; therefore "ten women shall bake your bread in one oven" signifies that in all things of the church with man there is so little of good and truth as to be scarcely anything; "ten women" signify all things of the church; "bread" signifies good and truth that nourish the soul; and "oven" signifies where spiritual food is prepared, thus the man with whom it is; "to bring back the bread by weight" signifies the lack and want of such things as spiritually nourish. [13] In Zechariah:      Many peoples and numerous nations shall come to seek Jehovah of Hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the faces of Jehovah. In those days ten men out of all the tongues of the nations shall take hold of the skirt of a man, a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you (Zech. 8:22, 23).  This is said of the calling together of the Gentiles and their admission to the church by the Lord; and "ten men out of all tongues" signify all from whatever religion, namely those "who come to seek Jehovah of Hosts in Jerusalem," that is, who wish to be admitted to the church and to confess the Lord, therefore "ten men" mean all such, and "the tongues of the nations" mean their religious principles. But this with the rest of the passage may be seen explained above (n. 433), where it is shown that "Jerusalem" does not mean Jerusalem, nor "Jew" any Jew. [14] In Amos:      Jehovah said, I hate the pride of Jacob and his palaces; therefore I will shut up the city and the fullness thereof; if there remain ten men in one house they shall die (Amos 6:8, 9).  "The pride of Jacob and his palaces which Jehovah hates," signify the love of falsity and belief in it with those who are of the church, "pride" meaning the love of falsity, and "palaces" the falsities themselves, which are called "palaces" because they belong to the proud, and because the falsities of such are embellished in external form so as to appear magnificent, although they are most vile, like huts full of rubbish and filth; "to shut up the city and the fullness thereof" signifies to condemn the doctrine, because it is full of the falsities of evil, and is possessed by them, "city" meaning doctrine, and "fullness" the falsities of evil; therefore "if there remain ten men in one house they shall die" signifies that all the truths of good with everyone shall perish, "ten men" meaning all truths, "house" man in respect to good, and "to die" to perish. [15] In Zechariah:      The prophet saw a flying roll, the length thereof twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits; this is the malediction that goeth forth over the faces of the whole land (Zech. 5:2, 3). "The flying roll," which meant "the malediction that goeth forth over the faces of the whole land," was twenty cubits in length and ten in breadth because "twenty" and "ten" signify all, here all good changed into evil and all truth into falsity; "twenty" is predicated of good and everything of it, and "ten" of truth and everything of it; moreover, "length" also signifies good, and "breadth" truth (see above, n. 355, 627, 629, and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 197). [16] As "ten" signifies all things and many things, so "ten times" signifies so many times and always, in the following passages. In Daniel:      Among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; <a name="fr_311"></a><a href="#fn_311"><font size="1">675-3</font></a> in every word of the wisdom of intelligence which the king sought of them, he found them ten times better than all the astrologers and diviners that were in all his kingdom (Dan. 1:19, 20). In Moses:      All the men who have seen My glory and My signs which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, and who have tempted Me these ten times, they shall not see the land (Num. 14:21-23). And in Job:      Ten times ye have dishonored Me, ye are not ashamed, ye harden yourselves (Job 19:3). "Ten times" in these passages signifies at all times or always, and so many times. [17] In Daniel and in Revelation horns are attributed to the beasts, to some ten, to some seven, and to some three, and the "horns" of these beasts signify the power of falsity against truth, and of evil against good, and "ten horns," the highest power. In Daniel:      The fourth beast coming up out of the sea had ten horns; as to the ten horns out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise (Dan. 7:7, 20, 24). "The ten horns" of the beast here signify the highest power of falsity against truth; "ten kings" signify falsities in the whole complex, and "kingdom" signifies that church perverted. In Revelation:      The dragon had seven heads and ten horns, and upon the heads seven diadems (Rev. 12:3). Again:      The beast coming up out of the sea had seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten diadems (Rev. 13:1). And again:      The woman sitting upon the scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, had seven heads and ten horns; the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings which have not yet received a kingdom; yet they shall receive power as kings one hour with the beast (Rev. 17:3, 7, 12). What is signified there in particular will be seen in the explanations further on. [18] As "ten" signifies all persons and all things, it follows that "the tenth part" signifies everything. It is from this that "tenths" and "tithings" derived their origin, and these signified that everything was holy and blessed when the tenth part of the threshing floor and of the wine press, or of the corn and wine, was given to the Levites; likewise for the Levites when the tenth part was again tithed and given to Aaron. Of these it is thus written in the Word:      Tithing thou shalt tithe all the increase of thy seed that is brought forth in the field year by year (Deut. 14:22).       Say unto the Levites, that the tenths must be given to them for an inheritance, and that they must offer up a heave offering of them to Jehovah, a tenth of the tenths, and this from the corn of the threshing floor and from the fullness of the wine vat; and the tenth of the tenth they must give to Aaron the priest (Num. 18:24-28). [19] That the "tenth" signified a blessing in all things, thus that everything was holy and blessed, is evident in Malachi:      Bring ye all the tithes to the house of treasure, that there may be food in My house; then prove ye Me in this, if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing until there be no room for more (Mal. 3:10). "To open the windows and pour out a blessing" signifies the inflowing Divine from which is intelligence and life eternal; the like as is signified by "rain" above (n. 644); and this also is properly meant by the "blessing" that would be given if the tithes were brought; so "tithes" here signify that everything was thus blest. That all things might be blest that Abraham took from his enemies, it is said:      That he gave to Melchizedek, who was king in Salem and at the same time priest to God Most High, tithes of all (Gen. 14:18, 19). Jacob likewise promised and vowed:      That if he returned in peace unto his father's house everything that Jehovah gave him tithing should be tithed (Gen. 28:21, 22). From these passages, as well as others, it can be seen what is signified in the Word by "ten" and "the tenth part." [20] The reason that "ten" signifies all things is derived from heaven itself; for heaven in the whole and every part answers to a man, and is therefore called the Greatest Man. All the forces of life of this Greatest Man or heaven close in the two hands and the two feet, and the hands close in ten fingers, and the feet in ten toes; for this reason, all things of man in respect to power and support are lastly gathered into ten fingers and toes, so these signify all things of man; moreover, ultimates signify in the Word all. </p>

 <p>And there were killed in the earthquake names of men seven thousand, signifies that in that change of state all truths of good with them perished, and thus all things of heaven and the church. This is evident from the signification of "to be killed," as being to be killed spiritually, which is to perish by evils and falsities (see above, n. 315, 547, 572, 589); also from the signification of "earthquake," as being a change of state of the interiors with those who are of the church (see above, n. 674); also from the signification of "the names of men," as being the truths of good and the consequent understanding of truth (of which presently); and from the signification of "seven thousand," as being all things of heaven and the church, for "seven" signifies all things, and is predicated of the holy things of heaven and the church (of the signification of this number see above, n. 257); and its signification is retained when it is multiplied by ten, or one hundred, or one thousand, for these numbers signify all things. From this it can be seen that "there were killed in the earthquake names of men seven thousand" signifies that in that change of state all truths of good perished, and thus all things of heaven and the church. [2] That "the names of men" signify the truths of good and the consequent understanding of truth can be seen from the signification of "name," as being the quality of a thing or state with man; and from the signification of "man," as being intelligence, thus also the understanding of truth. "Name" signifies the quality of a thing or state with man because in the spiritual world there are no names of persons as in the natural world. In the spiritual world all are named according to the quality of their life, thus with a difference within societies and out of them. Within the societies the quality of each one's state of life is constant, for each one there dwells in a quarter and also at a distance from the center according to the quality of his affection and of his intelligence; therefore his name is in accord with this quality. When, therefore, the name of anyone in a society is heard his quality is also recognized. This is why "name" signifies in the spiritual sense the quality of a thing and of a state of life. But outside of societies this naming according to one's state of life is not constant; for before a man-spirit enters into any society he passes through many states in order that he may put off the things that disagree with his ruling love and put on such as agree with it, and yet everyone is named according to the state in which he is, and also according to the idea and perception of what his state is. That names in the spiritual world are uttered spiritually may be seen above (n. 102); therefore "name" signifies in the Word what the state of the life is (n. 148). So, too, "the name of Jehovah" and "the name of the Lord" signify all things by which He is worshipped, thus all things of love and faith (n. 102, 135); and "man" signifies in the Word the spiritual affection of truth, and thence the understanding of truth (n. 280, 546). From this it is clear what "the names of men" signify. [3] Why the truths of good and thus the understanding from them were destroyed by the notable change of state which was signified by "a great earthquake" has been told in the preceding article, namely, that at the end of the church, when the Last Judgment is at hand, those who are spiritually good are taken away from those who are only naturally good; and when this is done, then also from the latter all truths of good and consequently all understanding of truth are also taken away; for with the natural, who are destitute of anything spiritual, truths and goods reside in their externals, but falsities and evils in their internals; therefore when the good with whom they had communication as to externals are taken away the externals also are taken away and the internals are disclosed, and these, as has been said, are filled with mere falsities of evil. This is why these words signify that all truths of good and all understanding of truth perished with those who remained. </p>

 <p>And the rest became afraid, signifies the disturbance of mind and turning away of those who were to some extent spiritual. This is evident from the signification of "the rest," as being those who had not been merely external and natural, but also to some extent internal and spiritual (of which presently); also from the signification of "to become afraid," as being to be disturbed in mind and to be turned away from those who have been merely natural, and thus in mere falsities and evils. [2] That "to become afraid" signifies such disturbance and turning away will be seen below. In the first place, let something be said about those who are meant by "the rest that became afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven," as being not merely natural, but also to some extent spiritual. For when from those who are merely natural the truths of good that resided in their externals are taken away, they are not disturbed by the influx of falsities and evils from hell, still less do they turn away; for their proper thought and will, which has been interiorly concealed with them, consists of mere falsities and evils therefrom and of evils and falsities therefrom; and when they are in these they are enraged against truths and goods, and thence are eager to destroy them. This is why the evil, when they are no longer in externals, are not afraid of evils and falsities, or even of hell, for these belong to their love, consequently to the delights of their life. But it is not so with those who are also spiritual; these are disturbed in mind and become afraid when they are infested by evils and falsities, which takes place when they are among the evil; for they fear the loss of their spiritual life, respecting which they are disturbed in mind and are alarmed, and supplicate the Lord for aid, and turn themselves away from the evil. [3] When societies in the spiritual world are purified, which takes place whenever those who are evil, especially hypocrites, have insinuated themselves into them, and mingled themselves with the good there (the signs of whose presence are an obscuration of the understanding, a loss of the perception of good, a dullness of the affection of truth, and the like), then influx is let in from hell, at which the evil rejoice, but the good are disturbed in mind, and turn themselves away; thus there is a separation, and those who become afraid and turn themselves away are preserved, while the rest are cast out. Thence it is clear why it is that it is said that some "became afraid," and why this signifies the disturbance of mind and turning away of those who are to some extent spiritual. [4] In the Word "to become afraid," "to be dismayed," and like expressions are often used in reference both to the good and to the evil, and "terror" and "dismay" signify a state of the mind disturbed and changed by an imminent or visible danger to the life; but this is one thing with the good and another with the evil; with the good it is a disturbance of mind and a change of state from imminent and visible danger to the soul, but with the evil it is from imminent and visible danger to the life of the body. This is because the good regard the life of the soul and not so much the life of the body as the chief and final thing, while the evil regard the life of the body and not so much the life of the soul as the chief and final thing; in fact, the evil do not in heart believe in that life, and such as do believe still love only the things that are of the body, such as the appetites and pleasures of various kinds. But with the good the reverse is true. [5] To make clear that "to become afraid," "to be dismayed," "to dread," and the like, signify to be disturbed in mind from a change of state of the interiors, I will cite some passages from the Word by way of confirmation. In David:      My heart is agitated in the midst of me, and the terrors of death have fallen upon me; fear and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath covered me (Ps. 55:4, 5). This is said of temptations, in which evils and falsities break in from hell and inspire terror in regard to damnation; for as has been said above, the good become afraid and tremble on account of imminent dangers to the soul, thus from the invasion of evils into the thoughts and intentions of the will. Thus there are various disturbances of mind that in particular are signified by "agitation of heart," "terrors of death," "fear," "trembling," and "horror," which are here mentioned according to the order of their succession. [6] In Isaiah:      The islands came <a name="fr_312"></a><a href="#fn_312"><font size="1">677-1</font></a> and feared, the ends of the earth were agitated, they drew near and came (Isa. 41:5). This is said of the Lord's coming; and "the islands and ends of the earth" mean the Gentiles that are remote from the truths of the church; and their "fear and agitation" signify disturbances of mind from fear of being destroyed. [7] In Ezekiel:      All hands are relaxed, and all knees go into waters, whence they shall gird themselves with sackcloth, terror shall cover them, and upon all faces there shall be shame; they shall cast their silver into the streets, and their gold shall be an abomination (Ezek. 7:17-19). This, too, treats of the Lord's coming, and these things are said of it; the various disturbances of the mind from grief on account of evils and from joy on account of goods are described by various expressions of fear and grief, as that "the hands are relaxed," "the knees go into waters," "terror shall cover them," and "upon all faces shall be shame," which signify not only various disturbances of mind and changes of state of the life, but also turnings from falsities and evils; for the falsities that they will reject are signified by the "silver that they shall cast into the streets," and the evils by "the gold that shall be an abomination;" "all knees shall go into waters" signifies grief on account of the loss of the good of love, and joy that it is now recovered, "knees" signifying the love of good, and "to go into waters" signifying to weep. [8] The holy tremor that seizes upon, agitates, and convulses the inner parts of the head, when the Divine flows in and fills them is called "fear," "terror," "dread," as can be seen from the following passages. In Luke:      When Zacharias saw the angel he was troubled, and fear fell upon him; the angel therefore said to him, Fear not, Zacharias (Luke 1:12, 13).      Likewise when the virgin Mary saw the angel (Luke 1:29, 30).      When the angel of the Lord stood by the shepherds, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, they were afraid with a great fear; but the angel said to them, Be not afraid; behold, I proclaim unto you good tidings of great joy, which is <a name="fr_313"></a><a href="#fn_313"><font size="1">677-2</font></a> to all the people (Luke 2:9, 10).      When Jesus was transfigured and was seen in glory, it is said that Peter, James, and John feared when they entered into the cloud (Luke 9:34).      And when they heard the voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, they fell upon their faces and feared exceedingly; but Jesus drawing near touched them, saying, Arise, be not afraid (Matt. 17:5-7; Mark 9:6).      When the Lord healed the palsied man, it is said that fear took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen wonderful things today (Luke 5:26).      And when the Lord raised to life the dead young man of Nain, it is said that fear took hold on all, and they praised God (Luke 7:16). So here in Revelation it is said that "they became afraid, and gave glory to the God of heaven." Furthermore:      When the women entered into the tomb they saw an angel sitting at the right side, clothed in a white robe; and they were terrified (Mark 16:5, 6).      And when the women departed from the tomb they were seized with fear, trembling, and amazement, and at the same time with great joy; and they told no one, for they were afraid; therefore Jesus said to them, Fear not; tell the brethren (Matt. 28:8, 10; Mark 16:8).      The two disciples going to Emmaus said to Jesus, Certain women terrified us (Luke 24:22). From these passages it can be concluded that "terror" and "alarm" mean in the Word various disturbances of mind arising from the influx of such things as cause amazement, connected also with joy. [9] Again, "terror" signifies in the spiritual sense terror on account of evils and falsities that are from hell, for these terrify the spiritual man, because they are the opposites of the goods and truths, which the spiritual man loves and the loss of which he fears. In this sense "terror" is mentioned in many passages of the Word. Thus in Isaiah:      About the time of evening behold terror; before the morning it is not (Isa. 17:14). "Evening" signifies the last time of the church, when there are mere evils and falsities; these are called "terror" because they are hell. But the "morning" signifies the first time of the church, when there are no evils and falsities, therefore it is said, "before the morning the terror is not." [10] In Jeremiah:      Fear thou not, my servant Jacob, and be not terrified, O Israel, for behold, I save thee from afar; Jacob shall be tranquil and quiet, none shall make him afraid (30:9, 10). And in Zephaniah:      The remnant of Israel shall feed and be at rest, none making them afraid (Zeph. 3:13). "Jacob" and "Israel" mean those in the church who are in goods and truths; and "none terrifying and making afraid" signifies that nothing of evil and falsity from hell shall infest them. It is similar in many other passages. But what is signified by "fearing God" in the spiritual sense will be told in the explanation of the eighteenth verse of this chapter. </p>

 <p>And gave glory to the God of heaven, signifies that they acknowledged and worshipped the Lord. This is evident from the signification of "giving glory" or of "glorifying," as being to acknowledge and worship (of which presently); also from the signification of "the God of heaven," as being the Lord. That the Lord is the God of heaven He Himself made clear when He was in the world and when He departed out of the world. When He was in the world He said in John:      The Father hath given all things into the hand of the Son (John 3:35).       The Father hath given to the Son power over all flesh (John 17:2). And in Matthew:      All things have been delivered unto Me by the Father (Matt. 11:27). And when He departed out of the world He said to the disciples:      All power hath been given unto Me in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). From this it is clear that the Lord is the God of heaven. [2] "To give glory" means to acknowledge and worship the Lord, because "to give glory" signifies that to Him alone glory belongs because He is the God of heaven and earth, and at the same time to acknowledge that all things of the church are from Him, thus all salvation and eternal life. From this it follows that "to give glory" and "to glorify," in reference to God, mean to worship and to adore Him. In reference to the Lord, "glory" properly signifies in the Word the Divine truth proceeding from Him, for the reason that this Divine truth is the light of heaven, and from that light angels and men have not only all their intelligence and wisdom, but also all their happiness, and besides this, all magnificence in the heavens, which is ineffable; these, therefore, are what are properly signified by "the glory of God;" and because Divine truth is glory it follows that "the glory of the Lord" means to enlighten angels and men, and to bestow intelligence and wisdom, and to bless with felicities and delights, and also to make magnificent all things in the heavens, and that this glory is not from the love of glory, but from love towards the human race. This is why the Lord says in John:      Herein is My Father glorified that ye may bear much fruit, and may become My disciples (John 15:8); again:      The words which Thou hast given Me I have given unto them, and I am glorified in them (John 17:8, 10). [3] That this is the glory of the Lord can be seen from this, that the light of heaven, from which is all wisdom, beauty, and magnificence in the heavens, proceeds from the Lord as a sun, and it is the Lord's Divine love that appears to the angels as a sun. From this it is clear that the light of heaven, which in its essence is Divine truth and Divine wisdom, is the Divine love proceeding; and as love desires nothing else than to give that which is its own to another, thus to fill others with blessedness, what will not the Divine love do? Nevertheless, the Lord cannot give His glory to anyone and fill him with wisdom and blessedness unless he acknowledges and worships the Lord, for it is by this that man conjoins himself to the Lord by love and faith; for in order that acknowledgment and worship may be acknowledgment and worship, it must be from love and faith; and without conjunction by means of these no good can flow in from the Lord, because it is not received. All this makes clear that "to give glory to the God of heaven" means to acknowledge and worship the Lord. [4] That "glory" signifies the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and that the Lord's glory with man is the reception of Divine truth, may be seen above (n. 33, 345). That the Lord's glorification is from the Lord Himself, and that with men and angels it is the reception and acknowledgment that every good and truth and everything of salvation and life is from the Lord, may also be seen above (n. 288). </p>

 <p>Verses 14, 15. The second woe is past; behold the third woe cometh quickly. And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world are become our Lord's and His Christ's, and He shall reign unto the ages of the ages. 14. "The second woe is past; behold the third woe cometh quickly," signifies a lamentation over the final vastation of the church now certainly at hand (n. 680). 15. "And the seventh angel sounded," signifies the influx of Divine truth through the heavens from the Lord, and the consequent final changes (n. 681); "and there were great voices in heaven" signifies enlightenment and joy in the higher heavens (n. 682); "saying, The kingdoms of the world are become our Lord's and His Christ's," signifies all things in the heavens and on earth subject to the Lord, when the evil have been separated from the good, and the Divine good and the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord are clearly received (n. 683, 684); "and He shall reign unto the ages of the ages," signifies His dominion by means of the Divine truth to eternity (n. 685). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="680.">680.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 14. The second woe is past; behold the third woe cometh quickly, signifies a lamentation over the final vastation of the church, now certainly at hand. This is evident from the signification of "woe" as being lamentation over various things, especially over such things as devastate the church (of which above, n. 531). And as "three" signifies what is complete, therefore the "third woe" signifies the final lamentation, when the devastation is full. That "three" signifies what is complete, and thus the end, may be seen above (n. 435, 506, 532). This is evident also from the signification of "coming quickly," as being certainly, at hand, and coming to pass; that "quickly" signifies certainty may be seen also above (n. 7, 216). What this third woe that was to come quickly involves, can be seen from what follows, namely, that it involves the final state of the church, when there is no longer any truth or good, and the state of separation at that time of the evil from the good, and of the good from the evil, and at length the Last Judgement, which is effected by a full separation, and then the casting down of the evil into hell, and the elevation of the good into heaven. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="681.">681.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 15. And the seventh angel sounded, signifies the influx of Divine truth through the heavens from the Lord, and the consequent final changes. This is evident from the signification of "sounding," in reference to an angel, as being the influx of Divine truth from the Lord, and a consequent change in the lower places, where the evil are (see above, n. 489, 502). This is the reason of this signification of "to sound," because "trumpet" and "horn" signify Divine truth about to be revealed or that has been revealed (see above, n. 55, 262). The "sounding of the seventh angel" means the final change caused by the influx of Divine truth from the Lord, because the number "seven" signifies what is full and final (see above, n. 20, 24, 257, 300, 486). As the changes in the lower places where the evil are, which are effected by a stronger or milder influx of Divine truth through the heavens from the Lord, thus by various kinds of influx, have been fully treated of above (n. 413, 418, 419, 426, 489, 493), it is unnecessary to say anything further about them. That the separation of the evil from the good, and the casting down of the evil into hell, and many other changes were effected by these various kinds of influx can be seen in the places indicated. From this now it is evident what is signified by "the seven angels sounding." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="682.">682.</a></font></span>
 <p>And there were great voices in the heavens, signifies enlightenment and joy in the higher heavens. This is evident from the signification of "great voices in the heavens," as being enlightenment, wisdom, and joy in the higher heavens; for "voices" have various significations in the Word, as Divine truth, revelation, the Word itself with us, also every precept and command of the Word; these are signified by "voices from heaven," but "voices in heaven" signify the enlightenment from which angels have wisdom and consequent joy; for when angels are in enlightenment they are also in wisdom, and they then have "great voices," by which they express the arcana of wisdom; and there is consequent joy, because the joy of angels is from wisdom; this, too, is why the voices are called "great," for "great" is predicated of the affection of good and truth, which is the source of joy in the heavens. The higher heavens are meant because through them and from them influxes descend into the lower parts, and by these the evil, who have been conjoined in externals to those in the lower heavens, are separated. So long as this conjunction continued there could be no enlightenment or joy, but so far as the separation was effected there was enlightenment and joy. Thence it is that the higher heavens are meant; since there is such a connection between higher things and lower things, in the spiritual world, that so far as lower things are in order, the higher are also. For lower things there are like the lower parts of a house and its foundations; so far, therefore, as these are unimpaired the higher parts are stable, secure, and complete, not swaying or tottering or gaping open. Or they are like the exterior things in man, as the organs of sight, taste, hearing, and touch, in that so far as these are unharmed their interiors see, taste, and hear clearly, and the touch is sensitive; for it is the interior things which sensate in the exterior, and the exterior sensate nothing of themselves. It is similar in the heavens; the higher heavens close into and rest upon the lower, and there is therefore between them an unbroken bond like that between things prior and posterior, or between causes and effects; if the effect does not altogether correspond to its cause, that is, if it does not have formed in itself everything that is in the effecting cause, which relates to the forces and the endeavor to act, the cause is weakened and acts imperfectly, for all things of the cause are inscribed on the effect, therefore it is the cause alone that acts, and no effect separate from a cause. It is similar with the heavens higher and lower; causes are in the higher heavens, and effects corresponding to the causes present themselves in the lower heavens. This has been said that it may be known why "great voices in heaven" signify enlightenment, which is the source of wisdom and joy in the higher heavens when the lower heavens are purified, that is, when the evil are separated from the good and removed. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="683.">683.</a></font></span>
 <p>Saying, The kingdoms of the world are become our Lord's and His Christ's, signifies all things in the heavens and on earth subject to the Lord, when the evil have been separated from the good, and that then the Divine good and Divine truth proceeding from the Lord are clearly received. This is evident from the signification of "the kingdoms of the world when they have become the Lord's," as being that the Divine proceeding from the Lord is received in love and faith (of which presently); also from the signification of "the Lord and His Christ," as being the Lord in relation to the Divine good of the Divine love, and in relation to the Divine truth proceeding from that love. That the Lord is called "Lord" from Divine good, and "Christ" from Divine truth, will be seen below. [2] That "the kingdom of the Lord" means the reception of Divine good and Divine truth, thus with those who receive, can be seen from this, that with the angels of heaven and with the men of the church the Lord reigns through that which proceeds from Him, which is commonly called Divine good and Divine truth, likewise justice and judgment, also love and faith. It is through these that the Lord reigns, consequently these are strictly the Lord's kingdom with those who receive them; for when these reign with angels and men then the Lord Himself reigns, for the things that proceed from Him are Himself. The Lord in heaven is no other than the Divine proceeding. [3] The Lord indeed not only rules those that receive Divine celestial and spiritual things from Him, but also those that do not receive, as all who are in hell; still it cannot be said that the Lord's kingdom is in hell, since those there are altogether unwilling to be ruled by the Divine that proceeds and according to the laws of its order; they even deny the Lord and turn themselves away from Him; yet the Lord does rule them, not like subjects and citizens of His kingdom, but like those who are refractory and rebellious, holding them in bonds that they may not do evil to one another, and especially to those who belong to His kingdom. [4] That the Lord's kingdom is that which proceeds from Him and is received can be seen from passages in the Word where "the kingdom of God" is mentioned, as in the Lord's Prayer:      Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done, as in heaven so also upon the earth (Matt. 6:10). "Kingdom" evidently means here the reception of Divine good and Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and in which the Lord is with the angels of heaven and the men of the church, for it is added, "Thy will be done, as in heaven so also upon the earth," and the will of God is done when these are received in heart and soul, that is, in love and faith. [5] And elsewhere:      Seek ye first the kingdom of the heavens <a name="fr_314"></a><a href="#fn_314"><font size="1">683-1</font></a> and His righteousness and all things shall be added to you (Matt. 6:33). "The kingdom of the heavens" means in the spiritual sense Divine truth, and "righteousness" Divine good, therefore it is said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of the heavens and His righteousness." But in the highest sense "the kingdom of the heavens" means the Lord, since He is the all of His kingdom, and in the same sense "righteousness" signifies the Lord's merit. And as a man who is ruled by the Lord desires and loves only such things as are of the Lord, he is, unknown to himself, forever led to felicities; and this is why it is said that "all things shall be added to him," meaning that all things that tend to his salvation shall come to pass according to his desire. [6] Since heaven is heaven from the reception of Divine truth from the Lord, likewise the church, so in a general sense heaven and the church are meant by "the kingdom of God" and "the kingdom of the heavens;" therefore those who receive Divine truth are called by the Lord "sons of the kingdom," in Matthew:      The field is the world, the seed are the sons of the kingdom, the tares are the sons of the evil one (Matt. 13:38).  It is evident that those who receive Divine truth are meant by "the sons of the kingdom," for it is said, "the seed are the sons of the kingdom, and the tares are the sons of the evil one," "seed" meaning Divine truth, and "tares" infernal falsity; such are called "sons" because in the spiritual sense of the Word "sons" signify truths, and in the contrary sense falsities (see above, n. 166). [7] Moreover, "the kingdom of God" signifies the church in respect to truths from good, and also heaven (as may be seen above, n. 48); and "the kingdom of God" with man signifies to be in truths from good from the Lord, thus in wisdom, and consequently in the power to resist falsities and evils, therefore "to reign" belongs to the Lord alone (see also above, n. 333). </p>
 
 
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="684.">684.</a></font></span>
 <p>It is said the "kingdoms of the world are become our Lord's and His Christ's," and this signifies that Divine good and Divine truth are received when the evil are separated from the good and are cast into hell; for then both the higher and the lower heavens can be in enlightenment and thus in the perception of good and truth; and this could not be effected so long as the evil were conjoined with the good, because the interiors of the angels, who are in the lower heavens, could not then be opened, but only the exteriors, and the Lord does not reign in spirits and men in externals separate from internals, but in internals, and from internals in externals; for this reason, until the interiors of the angels of the lowest heaven, which are spiritual and celestial, were opened, that heaven did not become the kingdom of the Lord as it did after the separation of the evil from them. [2] It is said that "the kingdoms of the world are become our Lord's and His Christ's," and "Lord" here has the same meaning as "Jehovah" in the Old Testament, and "Father" in the New, namely, the Lord in respect to the Divine Itself and in respect to Divine good; while "Christ" has the same meaning as "God" in the Old Testament, and "the Son of God" in the New, namely the Lord in respect to the Divine Human and also in respect to Divine truth, for "Christ" has a like meaning as "Anointed," "Messiah," and "King;" and "Anointed," "Messiah," and "King" mean the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and also in respect to the Divine Human when He was in the world, for the Lord in respect to His Human was then Divine truth. So "the Anointed of Jehovah" has a similar meaning, for the Divine Itself which is called "Jehovah" and "Father," and in its essence was the Divine good of Divine love, anointed the Divine Human, which is called "the Son of God," and which in its essence while it was in the world was Divine truth; for "anointing" signified that the Lord's Divine Human proceeded from His Divine Itself, and consequently the Divine truth from His Divine good. [3] From this it is clear that the Lord alone in relation to the Divine Human was essentially "the Anointed of Jehovah," while kings and priests were called "the anointed of Jehovah" representatively; for the "oil" with which the anointing was performed signified the Divine good of the Divine love. Now as it was Divine truth with the Lord that was anointed by the Divine good, so "Christ," and likewise "the Messiah" and "Anointed," and also "King," signifies Divine truth proceeding from the Divine good of the Lord's Divine love. That this is so can be seen from passages in the Word where "Christ," "Messiah," and "Anointed" are mentioned. [4] That "Christ" is the Messiah, or Anointed, is evident in John: Andrew findeth his brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah, which is, when interpreted, Christ (John 1:41). And in the same: The woman of Samaria said, I know that Messiah cometh, who is called Christ (John 4:25). This shows that the Lord is called "Christ" because He was the Messiah whose coming was foretold in the Word of the Old Testament; for the word for Anointed is "Christ" in the Greek, and "Messiah" in the Hebrew, and a king is one anointed. This is why the Lord is called "King of Israel," and "King of the Jews," which also He acknowledged before Pilate, wherefore it was inscribed upon the cross:      The king of the Jews (Matt. 27:11, 29, 37, 41; Luke 23:1-4, 35-40). Also in John:      Nathaniel said, Thou art the Son of God, the King of Israel (John 1:48). [5] As "Anointed," "Christ," "Messiah," and "King," are synonymous terms, so also "Son of God;" and each one of these names signifies in the spiritual sense Divine truth (that this is the signification of "king" may be seen above, n. 31, 553, 625); and "Son of God" also has the same meaning, because in the Word "sons" signify truths, and thus "the Son of God" signifies Divine truth. That "sons" signify truths may be seen above (n. 166). "Christ" and "Messiah" have a like signification. [6] That "Christ" signifies Divine truth is evident in Matthew:      Be not ye called Rabbi, one is your teacher, Christ (Matt. 23:8). "Rabbi" and "teacher" signify one that teaches truth, thus in an abstract sense the doctrine of truth, and in the highest sense Divine truth, which is Christ. That the Lord alone is Divine truth is meant by "Be not ye called Rabbi, one is your teacher, Christ." [7] In the same:      See that no one lead you astray; for many shall come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and shall lead many astray. If anyone shall say to you, Lo, here is the Christ, or there, believe it not; for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets (Matt. 24:4, 5, 23, 24; Mark 13:21-23). This must not be understood as meaning that there will arise those who will call themselves the Christ or Christs, but those who will falsify the Word, and declare that this or that is Divine truth when it is not; those who confirm falsities by the Word are meant by "false Christs," and those who hatch out falsities of doctrine by "false prophets." For these two chapters treat of the successive vastation of the church, thus of the falsification of the Word, and lastly of the profanation of truth thence. (But this may be seen further explained in the Arcana Coelestia, n. 3353-3356, and n. 3897-3901.) [8] And as "Son of God" also signifies Divine truth, as has just been said, He is sometimes called:      The Christ, the Son of God (as in Matt. 26:63; Mark 14:61; Luke 4:41; 22:66 to the end; John 6:69; 11:26, 27; 20:31). In a word, when the Lord was in the world He was called "Christ," "Messiah," "Anointed," and "King," because in Him alone was the Divine good of Divine love, from which Divine truth proceeds, and this was represented by "anointing;" for the "oil" with which anointing was performed signified the Divine good of Divine love, and the "king," who was anointed, represented Divine truth. This is why kings, when they had been anointed, represented the Lord, and were called "the anointed of Jehovah;" yet it was the Lord alone in relation to His Divine Human that was "the Anointed of Jehovah," since the Divine good of Divine love was in Him, and this was Jehovah and the Father from whom the Lord had the being [esse] of life. For it is well known that He was conceived of Jehovah, thus it was from the Divine good of Divine love, which was in Him from conception, that the Lord in relation to His Human was Divine truth so long as He was in the world. This shows that the Lord alone was "the Anointed of Jehovah" essentially, and that kings were called "the anointed of Jehovah" representatively. Thence now it is that the Lord in relation to His Divine Human was called "Messiah" and "Christ," that is, "Anointed." [9] This can also be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah:      The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon Me, therefore Jehovah hath anointed Me to proclaim good tidings unto the poor, He hath sent Me to bind up the broken in heart, to preach liberty to the captives, to the bound, to the blind, to proclaim the year of Jehovah's good pleasure, and the day of vengeance for our God, to comfort all that mourn (Isa. 61:1, 2). This is plainly said of the Lord. The meaning is that the Lord Jehovih anointed His Divine Human "to proclaim good tidings unto the poor, and sent it to bind up the broken in heart," and so on, for all this the Lord accomplished from His Human (but the particulars may be seen explained above, n. 183, 375 [5], 612). [10] In David:      Why have the nations become tumultuous, and why have the peoples meditated vanity? The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers took counsel together against Jehovah and against His Anointed. I have anointed My king upon Zion, the mountain of My holiness. I will declare the statute, Jehovah said unto me, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee; ask of Me and I will give the nations for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and ye perish in the way, for His anger will shortly burn forth; blessed are all they that put their trust in Him (Ps. 2:1, 2, 6-8, 12). Evidently "the Anointed of Jehovah" means here the Lord in relation to the Divine Human, for it is said, "Jehovah said unto Me, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee; kiss the Son lest ye perish; blessed are all they that put their trust in Him." In the sense of the letter this indeed is said of David, but in the Word "David" means the Lord in relation to Divine truth, or as a King (see above, n. 205). It is evident also that the Lord's coming and finally the Last Judgment by Him, and afterwards His sovereignty over all things of the world, are here treated of.  [11] The spiritual things that lie hidden and are signified in the particulars of this passage are as follows: "The nations have become tumultuous and the peoples have meditated vanity," signifies the state of the church and of the former heaven that was to pass away, "nations" meaning those who are in evils, and "peoples" those who are in falsities (see above, n. 175, 331, 625); "the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers took counsel together, against Jehovah and against His Anointed," signifies the falsities of the church and its evils, as being utterly opposed to the Divine good and the Divine truth, and thus to the Lord, "the kings of the earth" meaning the falsities of the church, and the "rulers" its evils, "Jehovah" meaning the Lord in relation to the Divine itself, thus in relation to Divine good, and the "Anointed" the Lord in relation to the Divine Human, thus as to Divine truth. [12] "I have anointed My king upon Zion, the mountain of My holiness," signifies the Lord's Human in relation to Divine truth proceeding from the Divine good of His Divine love, and thus His sovereignty over all things of heaven and the church, "Zion" and "the mountain of holiness" meaning heaven and the church; and thus all things of heaven and the church; "I will declare the statute" signifies an arcanum of the Divine providence and will; "Jehovah said unto Me, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee," signifies the Lord as the Anointed, Messiah, Christ, and King, thus in relation to His Human conceived and afterwards born of the Divine Itself, that is, Jehovah; "this day" signifies what is decreed from eternity and looks therefrom to the conjunction and union accomplished in time.  [13] "Ask of Me, and I will give the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession," signifies His kingdom and dominion over all things of heaven and the church, which shall be His; "kiss the Son" signifies conjunction with the Lord by love, "to kiss" signifying conjunction by love; "lest He be angry, and ye perish in the way," signifies lest evils assault you and you be condemned, for "to be angry" when predicated of the Lord, signifies the turning away of men from Him, thus their anger and not the Lord's; and evils are what turn away, and then are angry; "for His anger will shortly burn forth" signifies the Last Judgment, and the casting down of the evil into hell; "blessed are all they that trust in Him" signifies salvation by love to the Lord and faith in Him. [14] In the same:      Thou art fairer than the sons of men, grace is poured upon thy lips. Gird about thy sword upon the thigh, O Mighty One, in thy majesty and thy honor; and in thy honor mount, ride upon the word of truth and of meekness of righteousness, and thy right hand shall teach thee in wonderful things; thine arrows are sharp, the peoples shall fall under thee, enemies of the king from the heart. Thy throne, O God, is for an age and for eternity; a scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Thy kingdom; thou hast loved righteousness and hated evil; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of joy above thy fellows, with myrrh, aloes, and cassia, all thy garments. Kings' daughters are among thy precious ones; on thy right hand standeth the queen in the best gold of Ophir (Ps. 45:2-9). It is clear from all the particulars in this psalm that this is said of the Lord, and consequently that He it is of whom it is said "God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of joy, with myrrh, aloes, and cassia, and all thy garments." What this signifies can be seen from the series as follows, namely, that He has Divine wisdom and that from Him is the doctrine of Divine truth, is signified by "thou art fairer than the sons of men, grace is poured upon thy lips," "fair" signifies wisdom, "the sons of men" signify those who are intelligent in Divine truths, and "lips" signify doctrinals. [15] The Lord's omnipotence from Divine truth proceeding from Divine good, and the consequent destruction of falsities and evils and the subjugation of the hells, is signified by "gird about the sword upon the thigh, O Mighty One, in majesty and in honor, and in thy honor mount, ride upon the word of truth; thy right hand shall teach thee in wonderful things, thine arrows are sharp, the peoples shall fall under thee, enemies of the king from the heart;" "sword" signifies truth combating against falsity and destroying it; "chariot," like as "the word of truth," signifies the doctrine of truth; "to ride" signifies to instruct and combat; "right hand" signifies omnipotence; "arrows" signify truths combating; "peoples" those who are in the falsities of evil; and "enemies of the king" those who are opposed to truths, thus the hells. [16] That the kingdom and dominion would thus be His to eternity is signified by "Thy throne, O God, is for an age and for eternity; a scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Thy kingdom," "scepter of uprightness" meaning Divine truth which has power and sovereignty. That as He delivered the good from damnation by destroying the evil, therefore the Divine itself united itself to His Human, is signified by "thou hast loved righteousness and hated evil, therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of joy above thy fellows," "to love righteousness and to hate evil" signifying to deliver the good from damnation by destroying the evil, "to anoint with the oil of joy" signifying to unite Himself by victories in temptations, "God, thy God," signifying the reciprocal uniting of the Human with the Divine, and of the Divine with the Human. [17] Divine truths united to Divine goods are signified by "He hath anointed with myrrh, and aloes, and cassia all thy garments," "myrrh" signifying good of the lowest degree, "aloes" good of the second degree, and "cassia" good of the third degree, like as these three spices when mixed with olive oil, out of which the "oil of holiness" for anointing was made (Exod. 30:23, 24); and that "oil" signified the Divine good of the Divine love, and the "garments" that were anointed signified Divine truths. [18] That those who are of His kingdom have the spiritual affection of truth is signified by "kings' daughters are among thy precious ones," "kings' daughters" meaning the spiritual affections of truth, which are called "precious" when truths are genuine. That heaven and the church are under His protection and are conjoined to Him, because they are in love to Him from Him, is signified by "on thy right hand standeth the queen in the best gold of Ophir," "queen" signifying heaven and the church, "at the right hand" signifying under the Lord's protection from conjunction with Him, and "the best gold of Ophir" the good of love to the Lord. [19] In the same:      I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn to David My servant, even to eternity will I establish thy seed, and will build up thy throne to generation and generation. Thou hast spoken in vision to thy holy one, and hast said, I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one chosen out of the people; I have found David My servant, with the oil of My holiness have I anointed him, with whom My hand shall be established; Mine arm also shall strengthen him. I will beat in pieces his adversaries before him, and will strike down them that hate him. I will set his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers; he shall call me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation; I will also make him the firstborn, high above the kings of the earth; and My covenant shall be steadfast for him; and I will set his seed forever, and his throne as the days of the heavens. Once have I sworn by My holiness, I will not deal falsely with David, his seed shall be to eternity, and his throne as the sun before Me, it shall be established as the moon to eternity, a faithful witness in the clouds (Ps. 89:3, 4, 19-21, 23, 25-29, 35-37). That by "David" here David is not meant, but the Lord as to His kingship, which is the Divine spiritual, and is called the Divine truth, is very evident from what is here said of David, namely, that "his seed and throne shall be as the days of the heavens, and as the sun and the moon to eternity," that "he shall set the hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers," and that "he shall call Jehovah his Father, and shall be the firstborn, high above the kings of the earth," with other things that could not be said of David, his sons and his throne. That "David" in the Word means the Lord may be seen above (n. 205). [20] But to proceed to particulars. "I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn to David My servant," signifies the union of the Lord's Divine with the Human, "to make a covenant" signifying to be united, and "to swear" to confirm the union; "chosen" is predicated of good, and "servant" of truth. "Even to eternity will I establish thy seed, and will build up thy throne to generation and generation," signifies Divine truth, and heaven and the church from Him, "seed" meaning Divine truth and those who receive it, and "throne" heaven and the church. [21] "Thou hast spoken in vision to thy holy one" signifies a prophetic arcanum respecting the Lord; "I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one chosen out of the people," signifies Divine truth whereby Divine good operates all things, which is called "help upon one that is mighty," and elsewhere "the right hand of Jehovah;" Divine majesty and consequent power is signified by "the exalting of one chosen out of the people;" "I have found David My servant, with the oil of holiness have I anointed him," signifies the Lord in relation to the Divine Human and union with the Divine Itself, which union is called in the Word of the New Testament glorification, and is meant by "being anointed with the oil of holiness," for "the oil of holiness" signifies the Divine good of Divine love, and "to be anointed" signifies to be united to Divine truth, which was of the Lord's Human in the world. [22] "With whom My hand shall be established, Mine arm also shall strengthen him," signifies omnipotence therefrom, "hand" signifying the omnipotence of truth from good, and "arm" the omnipotence of good by means of truth; "I will beat in pieces his adversaries before him, and will strike down them that hate him," signifies combat with victory against falsities and evils, thus against the hells; "I will set His hand in the sea, and His right hand in the rivers," signifies the extension of His dominion and sovereignty over all things of heaven and the church, for "seas and rivers" mean the ultimates of heaven, and ultimates signify all things. [23] "He shall call Me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my Salvation," signifies the Divine Human which is the Son of God, who was conceived from Him, and afterwards born; and as the Lord's Human had therefrom Divine truth and Divine power He is also called "God" and "Rock of Salvation;" "I will also make him the firstborn, high above the kings of the earth," signifies that He is above every good and truth of heaven and the church, because goods and truths therein are from Him; "and My covenant shall be steadfast for him" signifies eternal union; "I will set his seed forever, and his throne as the days of the heavens," has the same signification here as above, "days of the heavens" meaning the states of the entire heaven, which are from His Divine. [24] "Once have I sworn by My holiness, I will not deal falsely with David," signifies eternal confirmation, because from the Divine, respecting the Lord and the union of His Human with the Divine Itself; "His seed shall be to eternity, and his throne as the sun before Me, it shall be established as the moon to eternity," has a like signification as above, where "seed" and "throne" are mentioned; it is said "as the sun and moon," because eternity in respect to Divine good is predicated of the "sun," and in respect to Divine truth of the "moon," for these are signified by "sun and moon;" "a faithful witness in the clouds" signifies the acknowledgment and confession from the Word of the Divine in the Lord's Human; that this is "a witness in the clouds" may be seen above (n. 10, 27, 228, 392, 649). [25] In the same:      O Jehovah, remember David, all his labor; who sware unto Jehovah, and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob, Surely I will not enter within the tent of my house, nor go up upon the couch of my bed, until I find out a place for Jehovah, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob. Lo, we have heard of Him in Ephrathah, we have found Him in the fields of the forest. We will go into His habitations, we will bow ourselves down at His footstool. Arise, O Jehovah, to Thy rest, Thou and the ark of Thy strength. Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let Thy saints shout for joy; for Thy servant David's sake turn not back the face of Thine anointed. In Zion will I make the horn of David to bud; I will set in order a lamp for Mine anointed; his adversaries will I clothe with shame, but upon himself shall his crown flourish (Ps. 132:1-3, 5-10, 17, 18). Here, too, "David" and "Anointed or Christ" do not mean David, but the Lord in relation to the Divine Human, for it is said that "His habitations," that is, of the Mighty One of Jacob, "are found in Ephrathah," which is Bethlehem, and that they "would bow themselves down at His footstool;" but that this is so will be more evident in the explanation of the particulars in their order. [26] "Who sware unto Jehovah, and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob," signifies irrevocable affirmation before the Lord, who is called "Jehovah" from the Divine in things first, and "Mighty One of Jacob" from the Divine in ultimates, in which is Divine power in its fullness; "surely I will not enter within the tent of my house, nor go upon the couch of my bed," signifies not to enter into and know the things that are of the church and its doctrine, "tent of the house" signifying the holy things of the church, and "the couch of a bed" its doctrine; "until I find out a place for Jehovah, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob," signifies until I shall know about the Lord's coming, and the arcana of the union of His Human with the Divine; these in the highest sense are "a place for Jehovah" and "habitations" of the Lord's Divine Human. [27] "Lo, we have heard of Him at Ephrathah, we have found Him in the fields of the forest," signifies both in the spiritual sense of the Word and in the natural, for "Ephrathah" and "Bethlehem" signify the spiritual-natural of the Word, and "fields of the forest" the natural of the Word, for there the Lord is found; "we will go into His habitations, we will bow ourselves down at His footstool," signifies that there He is found, for He is the Word; "His habitations" here mean the things of the spiritual sense of the Word, and thus the heavens, for these are in the spiritual sense of the Word, and "His footstool" means the things of the natural sense of the Word, and therefore the church, since in the church are Divine truths in their ultimates, which serve as a footstool for the spiritual things of the Word and of the heavens, thus for the Lord Himself who dwells therein. [28] "Arise, O Jehovah, to Thy rest, Thou and the ark of Thy strength," signifies the union of the Divine itself with the Human in the Lord, and consequent peace to all in heaven and in the church, "Jehovah's rest" meaning that union, and "the ark of His strength" heaven and the church; "let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let Thy saints shout for joy," signifies worship from love for those who are in celestial good, and worship from charity for those who are in spiritual good, "priests" meaning those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom, while those who are in His spiritual kingdom are called "saints." [29] "For Thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of Thine anointed" signifies that they may be enkindled by love and enlightened by the light of truth, when Divine truth has been united with Divine good in the Lord, thus the Divine Itself with the Human and the Human with the Divine, for "David" as a "servant" signifies the Lord's Human in relation to Divine truth, and "the anointed" signifies the same united to Divine good, and "his face" signifies Divine love and enlightenment therefrom; "in Zion will I make the horn of David to bud" signifies the power of Divine truth from Him in heaven and in the church; "I will set in order a lamp for Mine anointed" signifies enlightenment of Divine truth from the union of the Divine and Human in the Lord, "lamp" meaning Divine truth in respect to enlightenment. "His adversaries will I clothe with shame" signifies the subjugation of the hells and the dispersion of the evils thence; "but upon himself shall his crown flourish" signifies perpetual and eternal victory over them. [30] From the passages here cited from the Word it can be seen that the Lord is called "the Anointed," that is, the Messiah or the Christ, from the union of Divine good with Divine truth in His Human, for the Lord's Human from that union is meant by "the Anointed of Jehovah." [31] Likewise in the first book of Samuel:      Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth, and will give strength unto His King and exalt the horn of His Anointed (1 Sam. 2:10). This is a part of the prophetic song of Hannah, the mother of Samuel, before there was any king or anointed over Israel, therefore "King" and "Anointed" here mean the Lord, to whom "is given strength" and whose "horn is exalted" when the Divine is united to the Human, "strength" signifying the power of good over evil, and "horn" the power of truth over falsity, and truth is said "to be exalted" when it becomes interior, and in the same degree becomes more powerful. [32] "The anointed" has a similar meaning in Lamentations:      The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits, of whom we had said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations (Lam. 4:20). "The anointed of Jehovah" here means in the sense of the letter a king who was made captive, but in the spiritual sense it means the Lord, therefore it is said, "the breath of our nostrils," that is, the life of the perception of good and truth; "taken in the pits" signifies rejected by those who are in the falsities of evil, "pits" meaning the falsities of doctrine; "to live under his shadow" signifies to be under the Lord's protection against the falsities of evil, which are meant by "nations." [33] Since "the Anointed," "Messiah," or "Christ" signifies the Lord in relation to the Divine Human, thus in relation to Divine good united to Divine truth, so "anointing" signifies that union, respecting which the Lord says:      I am in the Father and the Father In Me; believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me (John 14:7-11); and elsewhere:      The Father and I are one; know ye and believe that I am in the Father and the Father in Me (John 10:30, 38). And because this was represented by the anointing of Aaron and his sons, therefore:      The holy things of the sons of Israel which belonged to Jehovah Himself were given to Aaron and His sons for the anointing (Num. 18:8). These holy things belonging to Jehovah which were given to Aaron and his sons are enumerated from verses 9 to 19 of that chapter. But see what has been said before, n. 375, respecting "anointings," namely, that the Lord alone, in relation to the Divine Human, was "the Anointed of Jehovah" because in Him was the Divine good of the Divine love, which was signified by "oil," and that all others anointed with oil were only representatives of Him. This has been said of "the Anointed of Jehovah," since "the Anointed of Jehovah" is the Christ, that it may be known that by "the Lord and His Christ" in this passage of Revelation two are not meant but one, that is, that they are one, as are "the Anointed of Jehovah" and "the Lord's Christ" in Luke 2:26. [34] Since the Lord is here treated of, to show why He was called "the Christ," that is, Messiah or Anointed, it is important to explain what is said of the Messiah in Daniel:      Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy city of holiness, to consummate the transgression, and to seal up sins, and to expiate iniquity, and to bring in the righteousness of the ages, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Holy of Holies. Know, therefore, and perceive that from the going forth of the Word even to the restoration and building of Jerusalem, even to Messiah the prince, shall be seven weeks. After sixty and two weeks it shall be restored and built with street and moat, but in straitness of times. But after sixty and two weeks the Messiah shall be cut off, yet not for Himself. Then the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary, so that its end shall be with an inundation, and even unto the end of the war desolations are determined. Yet He shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; but in the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and meal-offering to cease. At last upon the bird of abominations shall be desolation, and even to the consummation and decision it shall drop upon the devastation (Dan. 9:24-27). The meaning of these words has been investigated and explained by many of the learned, but in the literal sense only, and not as yet in the spiritual sense, for that sense has been hitherto unknown in the Christian world. In that sense these words have the following signification: "Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people" signifies the time and state of the church that then existed with the Jews, even to its end, "seven" and "seventy" signifying fullness from beginning to end, and "people" those who were then of the church; "and upon thy city of holiness" signifies the time and state of the end of the church in respect to the doctrine of truth from the Word, "city" signifying the doctrine of truth, and "the city of holiness" Divine truth, which is the Word. [35] "To consummate the transgression and to seal up the sins and to expiate iniquity" signifies when there are nothing but falsities and evils in the church, thus when iniquity is fulfilled and consummated; for until this is done the end does not come, for reasons given in the small work on The Last Judgment; for if the end should come before, the simple good, who are conjoined as to externals with those who imitate and hypocritically make a show of truths and goods in externals, would be destroyed; therefore it is added "to bring in the righteousness of the ages," which signifies to save those who are in the good of faith and charity; "and to seal up vision and prophecy" signifies to fulfill all things contained in the Word; "to anoint the Holy of Holies" signifies to unite the Divine itself with the Human in the Lord, for this is "the Holy of Holies." [36] "Know, therefore, and perceive from the going forth of the Word," signifies from the end of the Word of the Old Testament, since that was fulfilled in the Lord, for all things of the Word of the Old Testament treat in the highest sense of the Lord and of the glorification of His Human, and thus of His dominion over all things of heaven and the world; "even to the restoration and building of Jerusalem" signifies when a New Church was to be established, "Jerusalem" signifying that church, and "to build" to establish anew; "even to Messiah the Prince" signifies even to the Lord and Divine truth in Him and from Him, for the Lord is called "Messiah" from the Divine Human, and "Prince" from Divine truth; "seven weeks" signify a full time and state. [37] "After sixty and two weeks it shall be restored and built with street and moat" signifies the full time and state after His coming until the church with its truths and doctrine is established, "sixty" signifying a full time and state as to the implantation of truth, like as the number "three" or "six," and "two" signifying the same for the implantation of good, thus the "sixty and two" together signify the marriage of truth with a little good; "street" signifies the truth of doctrine, and "moat" doctrine. (What "street" signifies see above, n. 652; and "moat" or "pit," n. 537.) "But in straitness of times" signifies hardly and with difficulty, because with the Gentiles that have little perception of spiritual truth. [38] "But after the sixty and two weeks" signifies after a full time and state of the church now established in respect to truth and to good; "the Messiah shall be cut off" signifies that they fall away from the Lord, which took place chiefly with the Babylonians, by their transferring the Lord's Divine power to the popes, and thus by not acknowledging the Divine in His Human; "yet not for Himself" signifies that yet the power is His and the Divine is His. [39] "Then the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary" signifies that thus doctrine and the church will be destroyed by falsities, "city" signifying doctrine, "sanctuary" the church, and "the prince that shall come" the reigning falsity; "so that its end shall be with an inundation, and even unto the end of the war desolations are determined," signifies the falsification of truth, even until there is no combat between truth and falsity; "an inundation" signifying the falsification of truth, "war" the combat between truth and falsity, and "desolation" the last state of the church, when there is no longer any truth, but mere falsity. [40] "Yet He shall confirm a covenant for one week" signifies the time of the Reformation when the Word is again read and the Lord acknowledged, that is, the Divine in His Human; this acknowledgment, and conjunction therefrom with the Lord by means of the Word, is signified by "covenant," and the time of the Reformation by "one week;" "but in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the meal offering to cease" signifies that still interiorly with the Reformed there will be no truth and good in worship; "sacrifice" signifying worship from truths, and "meal offering" worship from goods, "the midst of the week" signifying not the midst of that time but the inmost of the state of the Reformed, for "midst" signifies inmost, and "week" a state of the church; there was no truth and good interiorly in worship after the Reformation, because they adopted faith as the essential of the church, and separated it from charity, and when faith is separated from charity then there is no truth or good in the inmost of worship, for the inmost of worship is the good of charity, and from that the truth of faith proceeds. [41] "At last upon the bird of abominations shall be desolation" signifies the extinction of all truth by the separation of faith from charity, "the bird of abominations" signifying faith alone, thus faith separated from charity, for "a bird" signifies thought respecting the truths of the Word and the understanding of them, and this becomes "a bird of abominations" when there is no spiritual affection of truth, which enlightens truth and teaches it, but only a natural affection, which is for the sake of reputation, glory, honor, and gain, and as this affection is infernal it is abominable, since from it there are mere falsities; "and even to the consummation and decision it shall drop upon the devastation" signifies its last state, when there is no longer anything of truth or of faith, and when the Last Judgment takes place. [42] That these last things in Daniel were predictions respecting the end of the Christian church is evident from the Lord's words in Matthew:      When ye shall see the abomination of desolation foretold by Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place, let him who readeth understand (Matt. 24:15). For that chapter treats of the consummation of the age, thus of the successive vastation of the Christian church, therefore the devastation of that church is meant by these words in Daniel. (But what they signify in the spiritual sense has been explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 3652.) From this it can now be seen what is signified by "the kingdoms of the world are become the Lord's and His Christ's," also what is signified by "the Lord's Christ" (or the Christ of the Lord), in Luke:      A promise was made to Simeon by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord (Luke 2:26). </p>

 <p>And he shall reign unto the ages of the ages, signifies His dominion by means of Divine truth to eternity. This is evident from the signification of "to reign," as being in reference to the Lord to have dominion by means of Divine truth (of which presently); also from the signification of "unto the ages of the ages," as being to eternity. "Unto the ages of the ages" means to eternity because the sense of the letter of the Word is natural, and to it the spiritual sense corresponds. The natural sense of the Word consists of such things as are in nature, which in general have reference to times and spaces and to places and persons, and "the ages of the ages" belong to times to which eternity corresponds in the spiritual sense. It is similar with "generation of generations," where the propagation of faith and charity in the church is treated of. [2] "To reign" signifies in reference to the Lord to have dominion by means of Divine truth, because dominion is predicated of good, and to reign of truth, for the Lord is called "Lord" [Dominus] from Divine good, and "king" from Divine truth. This is why here and there in the Word, both terms, dominion and kingdom, or to have dominion and to reign, are used, as in the following passages. In Micah:      Thou, O hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall come and shall return the former dominion, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem (Mic. 4:8). Because "the daughter of Zion" signifies the celestial church, the essential of which is the good of love, "dominion" is predicated of it, while "kingdom" is predicated of "the daughter of Jerusalem" because that signifies the spiritual church, the essential of which is the truth of doctrine. [3] In David:      Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all the ages, and thy dominion to every generation and generation (Ps. 145:13). In Daniel:      To the Son of man there was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom. His dominion is a dominion of an age, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed (Dan. 7:14). In the same-      The kingdom and the dominion and the majesty of kingdoms shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High (Dan. 7:27). In these passages "dominion" is predicated of good, because from good the Lord is called "Lord," and "kingdom" is predicated of truth, because from truth the Lord is called "King," as in Revelation:      He who sat upon the white horse had on His garment and on His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords (Rev. 19:16). "King of kings" is said to be the name "on the garment," and "Lord of lords" the name "on the thigh," for "garment" signifies truth, here Divine truth, since the Lord is meant, and "thigh" signifies good, here the Divine good of the Divine love. The like is true as applied to men, in David:      The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers consulted together (Ps. 2:2). From this it can be seen what is signified in particular by "reigning unto the ages of the ages." That "kingdom" signifies heaven and the church in respect to the truth of doctrine may be seen above (n. 48); therefore "to reign" belongs to the Lord alone, and when it is said of men it means to be in truths from good from the Lord, and to have power therefrom to resist the falsities from evil (n. 333). </p>

 <p>Verses 16, 17. And the twenty-four elders who sit before God upon their thrones fell upon their faces and worshipped God, saying, We give Thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who is, who was, and who is to come, because Thou hast taken Thy great power and entered upon the kingdom. 16. "And the twenty-four elders who sit before God upon their thrones," signifies the higher heavens in light and power from the Lord to separate the evil from the good before the day of the Last Judgment which is to come shortly (n. 687); "fell upon their faces and worshipped God," signifies the adoration of the Lord with them from a most humble heart (n. 688). 17. "Saying, We give Thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty," signifies the acknowledgment that all being, living, and ability are from the Lord (n. 689); "who is, and who was, and who is to come," signifies from Him who is the all in all things of heaven and the church from eternity to eternity (n. 690); "because Thou hast taken Thy great power and entered upon the kingdom," signifies the establishment of the new heaven and the New Church, when the former heaven and church are destroyed (n. 691). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="687.">687.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 16. And the twenty-four elders who sit before God upon their thrones, signifies the higher heavens in light and power from the Lord to separate the evil from the good before the day of the Last Judgment which is to come shortly. This is evident from the signification of "the twenty-four elders," as being the higher heaven (see above, n. 322, 362, 462); and also from the signification of "to sit upon thrones," that it is to be in the work of judging, for "thrones" signify the heavens, and "to sit upon thrones" signifies to judge. Since the angels of heaven do not judge, but the Lord alone, and since the Lord arranges those heavens by His influx and presence for effecting judgment therefrom upon those who have been gathered together below the heavens, therefore these words signify that the higher heavens are in light and power from the Lord, to separate the evil from the good before the day of the Last Judgment.  [2] That this is the internal sense of these words is evident from what follows in this chapter, also from what has been said above on this subject. From what follows in this chapter it is evident that the higher heavens are in light and power from the Lord, for this is why "they fell upon their faces and worshipped the Lord, and gave thanks that He had taken His great power and entered upon the kingdom," and afterwards "the temple was opened in heaven, and there was seen in the temple the ark of the covenant," this signifying the light there, and the former signifying the power there, from the Lord alone. It is also clear that it means to separate the evil from the good before the day of the Last Judgment, for it is said that "the nations were angered, and Thy anger is come, and the time of the dead to be judged;" and afterwards that "there were lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail," which signifies the separation of the evil from the good, and is a sign of the presence of the Last Judgment. As these are the things treated of, and as "the twenty-four elders sitting before God upon the thrones" mean the higher heavens arranged for effecting therefrom the Last Judgment, it follows that all this is what is involved in these words. [3] From what has been said above upon this subject, it is evident that the higher heavens before the Last Judgment were brought into a state of light and power, that there might be effected influx from them into the lower parts, whereby the evil might be separated from the good and the evil finally cast down into hell (see above, n. 411, 413, 418, 419, 426, 493, 497, 674, 675, 676). [4] That a "throne" signifies heaven in general, and in particular the heavens where the Lord's spiritual kingdom is, and in an abstract sense Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and that it is predicated of judgment, may also be seen above (n. 253, 297, 343, 460, 482), where it is also shown that although it is said that the twenty-four elders "sat upon thrones," likewise that "the apostles would sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel," and also that "angels would come with the Lord to judgment," yet it is the Lord alone who will judge, for "the twenty-four elders," "the twelve apostles," and the "angels," mean all the truths of the church, and in brief, the Divine truth from which is judgment. And as by these Divine truth is meant, and all Divine truth proceeds from the Lord, therefore judgment belongs to the Lord alone. Who cannot see that to judge myriads of myriads, each one according to the state of his love and faith both in his internal and in his external man, would be impossible for any angel, and would be possible only for the Lord from the Divine that is in Him and that proceeds from Him; also that to judge all in the heavens and in the earths belongs to infinite wisdom and infinite power, not the least part of which falls to finite beings such as the angels are, and such as the elders of Israel and the apostles of the Lord were? These taken together would not be able to judge even a single man or a single spirit. For he who is to judge must see every state of the man who is to be judged from infancy to the end of his life in the world, and afterward what the state of his life is to be to eternity. For in every view and in each and every particular of judgment, there must be what is eternal and infinite, and that is in the Divine alone, and from the Divine alone, because it is infinite and eternal. [5] The expressions "to walk before God," "to stand before God," and as here "to sit before God," are used in the Word; what "to stand before God" signifies may be seen above (n. 414); and what "to walk before God" signifies (n. 97). What "to sit before God" signifies, as here in reference to "the twenty-four elders," can be seen from passages in the Word where the expression "to sit" occurs. For in the spiritual world all things that pertain to man's movement or rest signify the things pertaining to his life, because they proceed from his life. Walking and journeying pertain to man's movements, and thence signify progression of life, or progression of the thought from an intention of the will; but standing and sitting pertain to man's rest, and thence signify the being [esse] of life, from which is its existence [existere]; thus they signify making to live. Therefore "to sit upon thrones," in reference to judgment, signifies to be in the function of judging, thence also to judge; from which comes the expression "to sit in judgment," which means to execute judgment. So "to sit upon a throne," when concerning a kingdom, signifies to be a king or to reign. [6] What further is signified by "to sit" in the spiritual sense, can be seen from the following passages. In David:      Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, and standeth not in the ways of sinners, and sitteth not in the seat of scoffers (Ps. 1:1). Here the expressions "to walk," "to stand," and "to sit," are used as following one another, for "to walk" pertains to the life of thought from intention, "to stand" to the life of the intention from the will, and "to sit" to the life of the will, thus it is life's being [esse]. Moreover, "counsel," of which "walking" is predicated, has respect to thought, "way," of which "standing" is predicated, has respect to the intention, and "to sit in a seat" has respect to the will, which is the being [esse] of man's life. [7] As Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is the very being [esse] of everyone's life, therefore He is said "to sit." In David:      Jehovah shall sit to eternity (Ps. 9:7). In the same:      Jehovah sitteth at the flood, and sitteth a King to eternity (Ps. 29:10). In the same:      God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon the throne of His holiness (Ps. 47:8). In Matthew:      When the Son of man shall come in His glory; and all His holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory (Matt. 25:31). "To sit upon the throne of His glory" signifies to be in His Divine truth, from which is judgment. So again in the same:      When the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:30). Since "angels," as well as "the twelve apostles" and "the twelve tribes of Israel," signify all the truths of the church, and in the highest sense, Divine truth, therefore "to sit upon thrones" means not that they themselves will sit, but the Lord as to Divine truth, from which is judgment; and "to judge the twelve tribes of Israel" signifies to judge all according to the truths of their church. From this it is clear that "to sit upon a throne," in reference to the Lord, signifies one who judges, thus to judge. It is called "a throne of glory," because "glory" signifies Divine truth (see above, n. 33, 288, 345, 678). [8] In the Gospels:      David said in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit Thou at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies the footstool of Thy feet (Luke 20:42, 43; Mark 12:36; Ps. 110:1). "The Lord said to my Lord" signifies the Divine Itself, which is called the Father, to the Divine Human, which is the Son; "Sit Thou at My right hand" signifies Divine power, or omnipotence through Divine truth; "until I make Thine enemies the footstool of Thy feet" signifies until the hells are overcome and subjugated, and the evil are cast into them, "enemies" being the hells, and thus the evil, and "footstool of the feet" signifies the lowest region under the heavens, beneath which are the hells; for while the Lord was in the world He was the Divine truth, which is omnipotent, and by means of which He conquered and subdued the hells. [9] In the same:      Jesus said, Henceforth shall ye see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven (Matt. 26:63, 64; Mark 14:61, 62; Luke 22:69). "To sit at the right hand of power" signifies the Lord's Divine omnipotence over the heavens and over the earths, after He had subjugated the hells and glorified His Human; "to come upon the clouds of heaven" signifies by means of Divine truth in the heavens; for after the Lord united His Human to the Divine Itself, then Divine truth proceeds from Him, and He Himself with angels and with men is in Divine truth, because He is in the Word, which is Divine truth, in which and from which is Divine omnipotence. [10] And again:      The Lord, after He had spoken with them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God (Mark 16:19). "To sit at the right hand of God" has a like signification, namely, His Divine omnipotence by means of Divine truth. From this it is evident that "to sit" means to be, and "to sit at the right hand" means to be omnipotent. As "to sit" signifies to be, so "to sit upon a throne" signifies to be a king and to reign (Exod. 11:5; Deut. 17:18; 1 Kings 1:13, 17, 20; Jer. 17:25; 22:2, 30; and elsewhere). Likewise:      To sit at the right hand and at the left (Matt. 20:21, 23; Mark 10:37, 40). [11] In Isaiah:      Come down and sit upon the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the earth, there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans. Sit thou in silence and enter into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for they shall no longer call thee the mistress of kingdoms. Hear this, thou voluptuous one, that sittest securely, saying, I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know bereavement (Isa. 47:1, 5, 8). This treats of the profanation of good and truth; for "daughter of Babylon" signifies the profanation of good, and "daughter of the Chaldeans" the profanation of truth; both for the reason that Divine goods and truths, which are in the Word and from the Word, are employed as means of gaining dominion; whence those who are "Babylonians and Chaldeans" regard themselves, that is, their own dominion, as ends, and the holy things of the church from the Word as means; thus they do not look to the Lord and His dominion, nor the neighbor and love towards the neighbor as the end. "Come down and sit upon the dust and on the earth" signifies to be in evils, and thence in damnation. "Sit thou in silence and enter into darkness" signifies to be in falsities, and thence in damnation. "To sit securely" signifies to be confident that their dominion will endure, and that they will not perish; "not to sit as a widow, and not to know bereavement," signifies to have no lack of followers, dependents, and worshipers; "there is no throne for thee, O daughter of the Chaldeans, they shall no longer call thee the mistress of kingdoms," signifies that they shall no longer have dominion, because of their overthrow and damnation in the day of the Last Judgment (of which this chapter also treats). [12] In the same:      Thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend into the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, and I will sit on the mount of meeting, on the sides of the north (Isa. 14:13).  This, too, is said of Babylon, which is here called "Lucifer," and of the lust of its profane love of ruling over all things of heaven. But what is meant in particular by "exalting the throne above the stars of God, and sitting on the mount of meeting and on the sides of the north," will be told in what follows, where Babylon will be treated of; here also "to sit" signifies to be, and has respect to dominion. [13] In Ezekiel:      All the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, they shall sit upon the earth (Ezek. 26:16). This is said of Tyre, which signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth, but here of the church vastated, in which these knowledges are then falsified; therefore "all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones" signifies that the knowledges of truth shall reign no more with the men of that church, for all sovereignty belongs to Divine truth; "to come down from thrones" signifies from governing, and thus to cease to rule, and "princes of the sea" mean the knowledges of truth, and those who are in them. "They shall sit upon the earth" signifies that they will be in falsifications, thus in falsities; "upon thrones" signifies to be in the truths of heaven, but "to sit upon the earth" signifies to be in falsities, since under the lands in the spiritual world are the hells, from which evils and falsities are continually exhaling. [14] "To sit" has a like signification in the following passages. In Luke:      Who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death (Luke 1:79).  In Isaiah:      To open the blind eyes, to lead him that is bound out of prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house (Isa. 42:7). In Jeremiah:      I sat not in the council of mockers, and I rejoiced; I sat solitary because of Thy hand, for thou hast filled me with indignation (Jer. 15:17). In David:      I have not sat with men of vanity, nor have I gone in with the hidden (Ps. 26:4). In Luke:      That day shall come as a snare upon all that sit upon the face of the whole earth (Luke 21:35). Since "to sit" signifies to be, and also to continue in one state and pertains to the will, it is said in David:      O Jehovah, Thou hast searched me and known me; Thou knowest my sitting and my rising, Thou understandest my thought afar off (Ps. 139:1, 2). "To know his sitting" has reference to the being [esse] of one's life, which is the will, "rising" has reference to intention therefrom; and as thought follows from the intention of the will it is added, "Thou understandest my thought afar off." [15] In Micah:      Then shall he stand and feed in the name <a name="fr_315"></a><a href="#fn_315"><font size="1">687-1</font></a> of Jehovah; and they shall sit, for now shall he increase unto the ends of the earth (Mic. 5:4). This is said of the Lord and of the doctrine of Divine truth from Him, which is meant by "Then shall he stand and feed in the name of Jehovah;" that men of the church will be in that doctrine is signified by "they shall sit;" and that the doctrine of Divine truth will endure to eternity is signified by "he shall increase unto the ends of the earth." [16] Likewise in Isaiah:      Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit, O Jerusalem; loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion (Isa. 52:2). This is said of the establishment of a New Church by the Lord; that church with its doctrine is here signified by "Jerusalem" and "the daughter of Zion;" to reject falsities and evils and to be in truths and goods is signified by "shaking herself from the dust, arising, and sitting," also by "loose the bands of the neck, O captive daughter of Zion," "bands of the neck" signifying falsities that prevent the entrance of truths. [17] That "to sit" is an expression significative of the being and permanence of state of a thing and of life, can be seen from those passages in the Word where the expressions "to sit before Jehovah," "to stand before Him," and "to sit <a name="fr_316"></a><a href="#fn_316"><font size="1">687-2</font></a> before Him" are used. "To sit before Jehovah" means to be with Him, thus to will and to act from Him; "to stand before Him" means to have regard for and to understand what He wills; and "to walk before Him" means to live according to His precepts, thus from Him. As such things are involved in "to sit," therefore the corresponding word in Hebrew means to remain and to dwell. [18] Because of this signification of "to sit":      An angel of the Lord was seen sitting upon the stone which he had rolled away from the entrance to the tomb (Matt. 28:2). also:      Angels were seen in the tomb, sitting one at the head, and the other at the feet (John 20:12; Mark 16:5). These things seen were representative of the Lord's glorification, and of introduction into heaven by Him; for the "stone" that was placed before the sepulcher, and that was rolled away by the angel, signifies Divine truth, thus the Word, which was closed up by the Jews, but opened by the Lord. (That "stone" signifies truth, and in the highest sense, Divine truth, may be seen above, n. 417, <a name="fr_317"></a><a href="#fn_317"><font size="1">687-3</font></a> and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 534.) And as a "sepulcher," and preeminently the sepulcher where the Lord was, signifies in the spiritual sense resurrection and also regeneration, and "angels" signify in the Word Divine truth, therefore angels were seen sitting one at the head and the other at the feet; "the angel at the head" signifying Divine truth in things first, and "the angel at the feet" Divine truth in ultimates, both proceeding from the Lord; and when Divine truth is received regeneration is effected, and there is resurrection. (That "to be buried," "burial," and "sepulcher," signify regeneration and resurrection, may be seen above, n. 659; and that "angels" signify in the highest sense the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and in a relative sense the recipients of Divine truth, and thus in an abstract sense, Divine truths from the Lord, see above, n. 130, 200, 302.) Again, the expression "they sat before Jehovah" is used when there was great joy; they were also said "to sit" when there was great mourning, and for the reason that "to sit" has reference to the being [esse] of man, which belongs to his will and love. (That they wept and sat before Jehovah see Judg. 20:26; 21:2.) </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="688.">688.</a></font></span>
 <p>Fell upon their faces and worshipped God, signifies the adoration of the Lord with them from a most humble heart. This is evident from the signification of "to fall upon the face," as being the deepest humiliation of heart, for it is a gesture of the body corresponding to humiliation of heart, thus a gesture that is representative of the humiliation of the whole man. Worship of God at such a time is what flows forth from such a heart, which varies according to the matter that engages the mind. [2] To fall upon the face before God is a gesture representative of deepest humiliation, because the face is the form of man's affections and thus of the interiors that pertain to his mind and disposition, for the affections shine forth in the face as in their type, and this is why the face is called an index and image of the mind. When, therefore, a man acknowledges that all things in him are turned away from God, and are consequently damned, and that thus he is neither able nor dares to look to God, who is essential Holiness, and if he should look to Him from such a self he would spiritually die, then from such thought and acknowledgment man falls upon the face to the earth; and because what is man's own [proprium] is thus removed, he is then filled by the Lord and so raised up as to be able to look to Him. [3] They are said to have "worshipped God," for the reason that "God" means in the Word the Divine proceeding which is called the Divine truth. And as this Divine is truth with the angels, for they are the recipients of it and it constitutes their wisdom, so in the Word angels are called "gods," and signify Divine truths. Moreover, in the Hebrew, God is called "Elohim," in the plural, therefore "God" means in the Word the Divine that is with the angels of heaven and the men of the church, which is the Divine proceeding. And as the higher heavens were now in enlightenment and power, because of the separation of the evil from the good in the lower parts, and because of the Last Judgment which was to come shortly, therefore they are said "to worship God," from which it is evident that the Lord was then with them; for from a more intense and powerful influx of the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord they had enlightenment and power. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="689.">689.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 17. Saying, we give Thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, signifies the acknowledgment that all being, living, and ability are from the Lord. This is evident from the signification of "saying and giving thanks," as being to acknowledge, since "to fall upon the face and to worship," and then "to give thanks," can have no other signification than to acknowledge, here the omnipotence of the Lord. Also from the signification of "the Lord God," as being the Lord in respect to Divine good and Divine truth; for where Divine good is meant in the Word the names "Lord" and "Jehovah" are used, and where Divine truth is meant the name "God" is used, therefore "the Lord God" and "Jehovah God" mean the Lord in respect to Divine good and Divine truth. Moreover, "Jehovah" in the Old Testament, is called "Lord" in the New. It is also evident from the signification of "Almighty," as being to be, to live, and to have ability of Himself, and also that the being, life, and ability of angels and men are from Him. (That this is meant by omnipotence, may be seen above, n. 43; also that Divine omnipotence means what is infinite, n. 286.) [2] In respect to Divine omnipotence: it does not involve any power to act contrary to order, but it involves all power to act according to order, for all order is from the Lord; from this it follows that no one has any power to act according to order except from Him from whom is order; and this shows that it is of the Divine omnipotence to lead man according to order, and this every moment from the beginning of his life even to eternity, and this it does according to the laws of order, which are innumerable, and the number of which cannot be expressed; and yet this can be done only so far as man suffers himself to be led, that is, so far as he is willing not to be led by himself; for so far as he wishes to be led by himself he is brought into opposition to order. Because it is of the Divine omnipotence to lead one who wishes to be led according to order, and thus to lead no one contrary to order, therefore it is not of the Divine omnipotence to lead anyone to heaven who wishes to lead himself, since it is a law of order that what a man does he shall do from reason and from freedom, because that which is received by the reason and done from freedom remains with man, and is appropriated to him as his own, but not that which is not received by the reason and done from freedom. Thence it is clear that it is not of the Divine omnipotence to save those who are not willing to be led according to order, for to be led according to order is to be led according to the laws of order, and the laws of order are the precepts of doctrine and life from the Word; it is therefore of the Divine omnipotence to lead a man who is willing to be led according to these every moment and continually to eternity. For every minute there are infinite things to be seen, to be removed, and to be insinuated, that man may be withheld from evils and held in goods, and this continually in connection according to order. It is also of the Divine omnipotence to protect men from the hells, so far as this can be done without injury to freedom and reason; for all the hells are as nothing against the Lord's Divine power; without this power of the Lord it is impossible for any man to be saved.

 <p>Who is, and who was, and who is to come, signifies from Him who is the all in all things of heaven and the church from eternity to eternity, as is evident from the explanation of the same words above (n. 23, 41, 42). </p>

 <p>Because Thou hast taken Thy great power and entered upon the kingdom, signifies the establishment of the new heaven and the New Church, when the former heaven and church are destroyed. This is evident from the signification of "to take His great power and to enter upon the kingdom," as being that when the former heaven and former church are destroyed the new heaven and the New Church will be established; this is what is meant by "taking great power and entering upon the kingdom," because the Lord then has omnipotence and the kingdom; for then His will is done, since the angels of heaven and the men of the church then suffer themselves to be led by Him, and He thus rules all according to order from Himself, by keeping them in Divine goods and truths, which proceed from Him, and withholding them from evils and falsities, which are from hell, and this cannot be done until the evil have been separated from the good and the evil have been cast down into hell, and a new heaven has been made from the good. This is brought into actuality by the Last Judgment, which is treated of in what follows. [2] That the Lord then has power and sovereignty can be illustrated by a comparison with the sun of the world; so long as the winter continues the sun has no power or sovereignty on the earth, because its heat is not received, for it is extinguished by the cold of the air and of the earth; but when spring is at hand the sun has power and sovereignty, for its heat is then received, and also its light, because it is joined with the heat, and from these the whole earth blossoms. It is similar with the Lord's power and sovereignty, which come when the evil have been separated from the good and cast down into hell; for the evil are colds like those of winter, and they extinguish the spiritual heat of the sun, which is love, and bring to naught the power and sovereignty of the Lord, although viewed in Himself He is perpetually in the like omnipotence, yet He is not so in subjects until the new heaven and the New Church come into existence. </p>

 <p>Verse 18. And the nations were angered; and Thy anger is come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give the reward to Thy <a name="fr_318"></a><a href="#fn_318"><font size="1">692-1</font></a> servants, the prophets and the saints, and to them that fear Thy name, the small and the great, and to destroy them that destroy the earth. 18. "And the nations were angered," signifies the contempt, enmity, and hatred of the evil against the Lord, and against the Divine things that are from Him, which are the holy things of heaven and the church (n. 693); "and Thy anger is come, and the time of the dead to be judged," signifies the Last Judgment upon those who inwardly possess with themselves nothing of good and truth (n. 694); "and to give reward to His servants, the prophets and the saints," signifies heaven to those who are in the truths of doctrine and in a life according to them (n. 695); "and to them that fear Thy name, the small and the great," signifies and to all of whatever religion who worship the Lord (n. 696); "and to destroy them that destroy the earth," signifies hell to those who destroy the church (n. 697). </p>

 <p>Verse 18. And the nations were angered, signifies the contempt, enmity, and hatred of the evil against the Lord and against the Divine things that are from Him, which are the holy things of heaven and the church. This is evident from the signification of "nations," as being those who are in the goods of the church, and in a contrary sense those who are in evils, here those who are in evils, since it is said that "they were angered." (That "nations" signify those who are in goods and those who are in evils, and in an abstract sense the goods and evils of the church, and that "peoples" signify those who are in truths and those who are in falsities, and in an abstract sense the truths and falsities of the church, may be seen above, n. 175, 331, 625.) Also from the signification of "to be angered," as being, in reference to the evil, who are signified by "nations," to be in contempt, enmity, and hatred against the Lord and against the Divine things that are from Him, which are the holy things of heaven and the church. [2] These and other like things are signified by "to be angered," because everyone burns with wrath and is angered when his love and the delight of his love are assaulted, this being the cause of all wrath and anger; also for the reason that the love of everyone is his life, consequently to hurt the love is to hurt the life, and this being hurt causes commotion of mind, and thence anger and wrath. It is similar with the good when their love is assaulted, but with the difference that they have, not wrath or anger, but zeal. This zeal indeed is called anger in the Word, but still it is not anger; it is called anger because it appears in external form like anger, but inwardly it is nothing but charity, goodness, and clemency; consequently zeal does not, like anger, continue after the one towards whom it was kindled repents and turns away from evil. Anger with the evil is different; for it inwardly conceals in itself hatred and revenge, which the evil love, therefore it persists and is rarely extinguished. This is why anger belongs to those who are in the loves of self and of the world, for they are in evils of every kind; while zeal belongs to those who are in love to the Lord and in love towards the neighbor. Therefore zeal looks to the salvation of man, but anger to his damnation; this also is in the purpose of the evil who are angered, but salvation is in the purpose of the good who are zealous. [3] "The nations were angered" signifies here the contempt, enmity, and hatred of the evil against the Lord and against the Divine things that are from Him, thus against the holy things of heaven and the church, because at the end of the church, a little before the Last Judgment, which is here treated of, there is a change of state with those who were in the former heaven and former earth, which is effected by the separation of the good from the evil; and when this has been effected the externals of the evil, by and from which they uttered what is true and did what is good from pretense and hypocrisy, are closed up, and the internals which in them are infernal are opened, and when these have been opened contempt, hostility, and hatred openly break forth with contumelies against the Lord and against the holy things of heaven and the church; for with them these things have lain stored up and covered over by the loves of self and the world; and these loves are such that they can do good and speak truths for the sake of self and of the world, because the holy things of heaven and the church serve them as means to ends, which are reputation, glory, honor, and gain, in a word, self and the world, and the means are loved for the sake of the ends. But since with such the end, which is of man's love and thus of his intention and will, is corporeal and worldly, and consequently infernal, therefore the goods and truths that belong to heaven and the church with them do not abide in their internals, but only in their externals, because in these are evils and falsities. The goods and truths of heaven penetrate into the internals only with such as make the holy things of heaven and the church their ends, that is, make them to be of their love, and thence of their intention and will; when these are made ends, then the spiritual mind is opened, and through this man is led by the Lord. But it is the exact opposite when the goods and truths of heaven and the church are not made ends, but means; for, as has just been said, ends belong to the ruling love of man, and when this is love of self it is also love of his own [proprium], and this regarded in itself is nothing but evil, and so far as man acts from it he acts from hell, and thus against the Divine. [4] Furthermore, it is to be known that in all evil there is anger against the Lord and against the holy things of the church. That this is so has been made clearly evident to me from the hells, in which all are in evils, and from which are all evils; for there when they merely hear the Lord named they become inflamed with vehement anger, not only against Him but also against all who confess Him. Thence it is that hell is the diametrical opposite of heaven, and is in the perpetual effort to destroy heaven, and to extinguish the Divine things therein, which are the goods of love and the truths of faith. This shows why evils are angry with goods, and falsities of evil with truths; this is why "anger" in the Word signifies evil in the whole complex. [5] It is similar in the following passages. In Luke:      Jesus said, Woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days; for there shall be great distress upon the land, and anger with the people (Luke 21:23). This is said of the consummation of the age, which is the last time of the church. That then good and truth cannot be received is signified by "Woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck." The rejection of good because of the evil that will then rule in the church, and of truth because of falsity, is signified by "for there shall be great distress upon the land, and anger with the people," "distress" here means the ruling evil, and "anger" the ruling falsity from evil, for at the end of the church the evil are distressed by good and angered by truth. [6] In Isaiah:      Only in Jehovah is righteousness and strength; unto Him shall they come, and all that were incensed against Him shall be ashamed (Isa. 45:24). "All that were incensed against Jehovah shall be ashamed" signifies that all who are in evils and falsities will desist from them, "to be incensed against Jehovah" signifying to be in falsities from evil. [7] In Moses:      Simeon and Levi are brethren; In their anger they slew a man, and in their good pleasure they hocked an ox; cursed be their anger for it is fierce, and their wrath for it is hard; I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel (Gen. 49:5-7). "Reuben, Simeon, and Levi" signify faith, charity, and the works of charity; but here "Reuben" signifies faith separated from charity, from which comes neither charity nor any work of charity; for these three cohere together; such as the faith is such is the charity, and such as the charity is such are the works of charity; thus they are inseparable, each one belongs to the other, and is as the other. Because Reuben, on account of his adultery with the handmaid, his father's concubine, was accursed, Simeon and Levi also were rejected; their rejection is signified by "I have divided them in Jacob and scattered them in Israel." Now because faith, which was represented by "Reuben," was not to be accepted as the first principle of the church, but spiritual good, which is truth in the understanding and will, therefore Joseph was accepted as the firstborn of the church in the place of Reuben, for "Joseph" represented spiritual good, which in its essence is truth in the understanding and will. Thence it may be clear what is signified by "the anger of Simeon and Levi that it was fierce, and their wrath that it was hard," namely, the turning away from good and truth, thus evil and falsity in the whole complex; for when charity departs from faith there is no more any good nor any truth. (But these things may be seen explained more copiously in the Arcana Coelestia, n. 6351-6361.) [8] In Matthew:      Jesus said, It was said to them of old, Whosoever shall kill shall be liable to the judgment; but I say unto you, Whosoever is angry with his brother without cause shall be liable to the judgment (Matt. 5:21, 22). "To be angry with his brother without cause" here also signifies enmity and hatred against good and truth; those also that have such enmity and such hatred do kill continually in mind, intention and will, and would kill actually if it were permitted, that is, if they were not hindered by the laws and the consequent fear of punishment and loss of life or of reputation, honor, or gain; for what a man cherishes in his mind, that he does when it is permissible. "He who is angry with his brother without cause is liable to the judgment," the same as he who kills, because "to be angry" signifies to think, to intend, and to will evil to another, and all evil of the will is in the life of man's spirit and returns after death, and this is why he is then "liable to the judgment," for what belongs to the intention and will is judged like deeds. But it is unnecessary to cite more passages to show what "anger" and "wrath" signify in the case of those who are in evil, for it is self-evident that every evil conceals in itself anger against good, since it wills to extinguish the good, and even to kill him in whom good is, if not as to the body, still they do as to the soul, and this certainly comes from anger and is accompanied by anger. </p>

 <p>And Thy anger is come, and the time of the dead to be judged, signifies the Last Judgment upon those who inwardly possess with themselves nothing of good and truth. This is evident from the signification of "anger" as being, in reference to the Lord, the Last Judgment (of which above, n. 413). This is evidently the signification of "anger" here, for it is added, "and the time of the dead to be judged." Also from the signification of "the dead," as being those who inwardly possess with themselves nothing of good and truth. Such are called "dead" because the essential life of man is his spiritual life, for it is through this that he is a man and is distinguished from beasts, which have only natural life. In man the natural life without the spiritual life is dead, since it has not in itself heaven, which is called "life" and "eternal life," but has hell, which is spiritually called "death." In the Word, the "dead" mean those who live a natural life only, and not at the same time a spiritual life (as may be seen above, n. 78); also "death," in reference to man, means a lack of the faculty of understanding truth and perceiving good (see above, n. 550); and this lack exists when the internal spiritual man has not been formed, for this is formed by means of truths from good. In that internal man the ability to understand truth and perceive good has its seat, for that man is in heaven and in its light, and he who is in the light of heaven is a living man. But when the natural man only has been formed, and not at the same time the spiritual, there is no faculty of understanding and perceiving the truths and goods of heaven and the church, because that man has no light from heaven. For this reason such a man is called "dead." That those who inwardly possess with themselves nothing of good and truth are here meant by "the dead who are to be judged," can be seen from what has been said before about the separation of the evil from the good before the Last Judgment, and that the evil, when they have been separated, come into their interiors, which swarm with mere evils and falsities; from which it is clear that inwardly they were dead, although in external form they appeared to be living. </p>

 <p>And to give reward to His <a name="fr_319"></a><a href="#fn_319"><font size="1">695-1</font></a> servants, the prophets and the saints, signifies heaven to those who are in the truths of doctrine and in a life according to them. This is evident from the signification of "giving reward," as being salvation, and thus heaven; also from the signification of "His servants the prophets," as being those who are in the truths of doctrine, for those are called "servants of the Lord" who are in truths, because truths are serviceable for bringing forth, confirming, and preserving good, and whatever serves good serves the Lord, since every good is from the Lord. Those are called "prophets" who teach doctrine, thus in an abstract sense they signify doctrine. (That those are called "servants of God" who are in truths see above, n. 6, 409; and "prophets" who teach doctrine, and in an abstract sense doctrines, n. 624.) The above is evident also from the signification of "saints" as being those who are in the truths of doctrine from the Word and in a life according to them (see above, n. 204). From this it is clear that "to give reward to His servants, the prophets and saints," signifies heaven to those who are in the truths of doctrine and in a life according to them. [2] That "reward" signifies salvation, and thus heaven, can be seen without amplification and explanation; but as few know what is properly meant by "reward" it shall be told. "Reward" means properly that delight, blessedness, and happiness that is in the love or affection of good and truth. This love or affection has in itself all joy of heart, which is called heavenly joy, and also heaven; and for the reason that the Lord is in that love or affection, and with the Lord is heaven; consequently such joy, or such delight, blessedness, and happiness, is what is properly meant by the "reward" that those will receive who do good and speak truth from the love or affection of good and truth, thus from the Lord, and in no wise from themselves; and as they do this from the Lord and not from themselves it is not a reward of merit but a reward of grace. This shows that whoever knows what heavenly joy is also knows what reward is. (What heavenly joy is in its essence can be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 395-414.) This, therefore, is what is meant by the "reward" that those have who are in truths from good. But the "reward" that those have who are in falsities from evil is joy or delight, good fortune, and happiness in the world, but hell after their departure out of the world. [3] From these few words the signification of "reward" in the following passages can be seen. In Isaiah:      Behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength; behold His reward is with Him, and the wages of His work are with <a name="fr_320"></a><a href="#fn_320"><font size="1">695-2</font></a> Him (Isa. 40:10). In the same:      Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy salvation cometh, and the wages of His work are with <a name="fr_321"></a><a href="#fn_321"><font size="1">695-3</font></a> Him (Isa. 62:11). And in Revelation:      Behold I come quickly, and My reward is with Me to give to each one as his work shall be (Rev. 22:12). "Behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength," and "Behold thy salvation cometh," and "Behold He cometh quickly," signify the first and second coming of the Lord. "His reward is with Him" signifies heaven and all things belonging to it, as above, since where the Lord is, there heaven is, for heaven is not heaven from the angels there, but from the Lord with the angels. That heaven will be received in the measure of the love and affection of good and truth from the Lord is meant by "the wages of His work are before Him," and by "He will give to each one as his work shall be." No other work is meant by the "work" for which heaven is given as a reward than work from the love or affection of good and truth, for from that must be every work with man from which is heaven. For a work derives its all from love or affection, just as the effect derives its all from the effecting cause, therefore such as the love or affection is, such is the work. Thence it may be clear what is meant by "the work according to which it shall be given to everyone," and what is meant by "the wages of work." [4] Likewise in Isaiah:      I Jehovah love judgment, I will give the reward of their work in truth, and will make with them a covenant of eternity (Isa. 61:8). The "judgment that Jehovah loves" signifies truth in faith, in affection, and in act, for man has judgment from truth, both when he thinks and desires truth, and when he speaks truth and acts according to it; and as this is what is signified by "judgment," therefore it is said "I will give the reward of their work in truth," that is, heaven according to the faith of truth and the affection of it in act; and as from this is conjunction with the Lord, from whom reward comes, therefore it is added, "I will make with them a covenant of eternity," "covenant" signifying in the Word conjunction by love, and "a covenant of eternity" conjunction by the love of good and truth, for that love conjoins, since it is of the Lord Himself and proceeds from Him. [5] That loving good and truth for the sake of good and truth is reward, for the reason that the Lord and heaven are in that love, can also be seen from the following passages. In Matthew:      Do not ye your alms before men; to be seen by them, for otherwise ye have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens. When thou doest alms sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men; verily I say to you they have their reward. But thou, when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth, that thine alms may be in secret; then thy Father who seeth in secret will reward thee openly. And when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men; verily I say unto you, they have their reward; but when thou prayest enter into thy chamber, and shutting thy door pray to thy Father who is in secret; then thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly (Matt. 6:1-6). "Alms" in the most general sense signifies every good that man wills and does, and "to pray" signifies in the same sense every truth that man thinks and speaks. Those who do these two things "to be seen," that is, that they may be manifest, do good and speak truth for the sake of self and the world, that is, for the sake of glory, which is the delight of self-love that the world affords. Because delight in glory is the reward of such it is said "they have their reward;" but this delight in glory, which in the world seems to them like heaven, is changed after death into hell. But those who do good and speak truth, not for the sake of self and the world but for the sake of good itself and truth itself, are meant by those who "do alms in secret," and who "pray in secret," for they act and pray from love or affection, thus from the Lord; this, therefore, is loving good and truth for the sake of good and truth; and of such it is said that "the Father in the heavens will reward them openly." Thus "reward" is to be in goods and truths from love or affection, which is the same as being in them from the Lord, since in these is heaven and every blessedness and happiness of heaven. [6] In Luke:      When thou makest a dinner or a supper call not the rich, lest haply they should call thee in turn; and a recompense be made to thee; but call the poor; then shalt thou be blessed, for they have not wherewith to recompense thee; for it shall be recompensed thee in the resurrection of the dead (Luke 14:12-14). "To make a dinner and a supper and to call to them" has a similar signification as giving to eat and drink, or bread and wine, namely, doing good to the neighbor, and teaching truth, and being thus consociated in love; so those who do this for the purpose of being recompensed do it not for the sake of good and truth, thus not from the Lord, but for the sake of self and the world, thus from hell; while those who do this not for the purpose of being recompensed, do it for its own sake, that is, for the sake of good and truth, and those who do it for the sake of good and truth do it from good and truth, thus from the Lord, from whom are good and truth with man. The heavenly blessedness that is in such deeds and thence from them is "reward" and is meant by "it shall be recompensed thee in the resurrection of the dead." [7] In the same:      Rather love your enemies, and do good and lend, hoping for nothing again; then shall your reward be much, and ye shall be sons of the Most High (Luke 6:35). This has a similar signification as the previous passage, namely, that good is not to be done for the sake of recompense, that is, for the sake of self and the world, thus not for the sake of reputation, glory, honor, and gain, but for the Lord's sake, that is, for the sake of good itself and truth itself which are with such from the Lord, thus in which the Lord is. "To love enemies and do good to them" means here, in the nearest sense, to love the Gentiles and do good to them, which is to be done by teaching them truth and leading them by it to good; for the Jewish nation called their own people brethren and friends, but the Gentiles they called adversaries and enemies. "To lend" signifies to communicate goods and truths of doctrine from the Word; "to hope for nothing again" signifies, not for the sake of anything of self and of the world, but for the sake of good and truth; "then shall your reward be much" signifies that then they shall have heaven with its blessedness and delights; "and ye shall be sons of the Most High" signifies because they do these things not from self but from the Lord; for he who does good and teaches truth from the Lord is the Lord's son, but not he who does good from self, which is what everyone does who looks to honor and gain as his end. [8] In Matthew:      He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] only in the name of a disciple, he shall not lose his reward (Matt. 10:41, 42). How these words of the Lord are to be understood no one can see except from their internal or spiritual sense; for who can know what is meant by "receiving a prophet's reward" and "a righteous man's reward," and by "receiving a prophet and a righteous man in the name of a prophet and a righteous man;" also what is meant by the "reward" that he will receive who "shall give to drink unto one of the little ones a cup of cold [water] only, in the name of a disciple"? Without the internal spiritual sense, who can see that these words mean that everyone shall receive heaven and its joy in the measure of his affection of truth and good, and in the measure of his obedience? [9] This meaning becomes evident when it is seen that "prophet" means the truth of doctrine, "righteous man" the good of love, and "disciple" the truth and good of the Word and of the church, and that "in their name" means for the sake of these, and according to their quality with those who do and teach them; also that "reward" means heaven, as has been said above, namely, that everyone has heaven in the measure of his affection of truth and good, and according to its quality and quantity; for on these affections all things of heaven are inscribed, since no one can have these affections except from the Lord, for it is the Divine proceeding from the Lord in which and from which is heaven. [10] "To give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] only in the name of a disciple" means to do good and teach truth from obedience, for "water" signifies the truth in affection, and "cold [water]" truth in obedience, for obedience alone is a natural, not a spiritual, affection, and is therefore comparatively cold; and a "disciple" in whose name or for whose sake it is "given to drink" signifies the truth and good of the Word and of the church. (That "a prophet" signifies the truth of doctrine can be seen above, n. 624; that "a righteous man" signifies the good of love, n. 204; that a "disciple" signifies the truth and good of the Word and of the church, n. 100, 122; and that "name" signifies the quality of a thing and <a name="fr_322"></a><a href="#fn_322"><font size="1">695-4</font></a> state, n. 102, 135, 148, 676.) [11] In Mark:      Whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in My name, because ye are Christ's, verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward (Mark 9:41). This also means that those shall receive the delight of heaven who from affection hear, receive, and teach the truth because truth and the affection of it are from the Lord, thus for the Lord's sake, and accordingly for the truth's sake, since "because ye are Christ's" signifies for the sake of Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. (That "Christ" means the Lord in regard to Divine truth, and thus Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, may be seen above, n. 684, 685.) [12] In Zechariah:      The foundation of the house of Jehovah of Hosts hath been laid, the temple, that it may be built; for before these days there was no reward of man, nor reward of beast, and to him that went out and to him that came in there was no peace from the adversary. Now the seed of peace, the vine shall give its fruit, and the land shall give its produce, and the heavens shall give their dew (Zech. 8:9, 10, 12). This was said of the New Church to be established by the Lord when the old had been laid waste; the New Church that is to be established is signified by "the house of Jehovah of Hosts" whose foundations have been laid, and by "the temple" that was to be built, "the house of Jehovah" signifying the church in respect to good, and "the temple" the church in respect to truth (see above, n. 220). That before this, no one had any spiritual affection of truth and good or any natural affection of truth and good is signified by "before these days there was no reward of man, nor reward of beast;" "man" signifying the spiritual affection of truth, and "beast" the natural affection of good, and "reward" heaven, which those have who are in the affections of truth and good. (That "man" signifies the spiritual affection of truth, and consequent intelligence, may be seen above, n. 280, 546, 547; and that "beast" signifies the natural affection, n. 650.) [13] "To him that went out and to him that came in there was no peace from the adversary" signifies that heretofore they had been infested by hell in every state of life; "to go out and come in" signifying the state of life from beginning to end, "there was no peace" signifying infestation by evils and falsities therefrom, and "adversary" signifying hell, the source of evils and falsities. "The seed of peace" signifies the truth of heaven and the church, which is from the Lord; this is called "the seed of peace" because it defends from the hells and gives security. "The vine shall give fruit and the land produce" signifies that the spiritual affection of truth shall bring forth the good of charity, and the natural affection of good and truth shall bring forth the works of charity; "vine" signifying the church in respect to the spiritual affection of truth, "land" the church in respect to the natural affection of truth, "fruit" the good of charity, and "produce" the works of that good. "The heavens shall give dew" signifies that these things are from influx through heaven from the Lord. [14] In John:      Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, that they are white already for harvest; and he that reapeth receiveth reward and gathereth fruit unto life eternal, that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together (John 4:35, 36). This, too, is said of a New Church from the Lord. That it is at hand is signified by "the fields that are white already for harvest;" those of that church who are in the spiritual affection of truth, and thence in heaven, are meant by "he that reapeth receiveth reward and gathereth fruit unto life eternal;" and the Lord Himself, from whom is that affection of truth, and heaven, is meant by "he that soweth may rejoice together with him that reapeth." [15] In Jeremiah:      Rachel weeping for her sons, she refuseth to be comforted for her sons because they are not. But refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears, for there is reward for thy labor, for they shall return from the land of the enemy; and there is hope for thy latter end, for thy sons shall return to their own border (Jer. 31:15-17; Matt. 2:18). This refers to the infant boys put to death in Bethlehem by command of Herod, as is evident from the passage cited in Matthew; but what this signifies has not heretofore been known. The signification is that when the Lord came into the world there was no spiritual truth remaining; for "Rachel" represented the internal spiritual church, and "Leah" the external natural church, "Bethlehem" the spiritual, and "the boys put to death" truth from that origin. That there was no spiritual truth any longer remaining is signified by "Rachel weeping for her sons, she refuseth to be comforted for her sons, because they are not." [16] That henceforth there will be no grief on that account, because the Lord has been born, from whom there will be a New Church that will be in truths from spiritual affection, is signified by "refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears, for there is reward for thy labor," "His reward" signifying heaven for those who will be of that church from the spiritual affection of truth, and "labor" signifying the Lord's combats against the hells and the subjugation of the hells that a New Church may be established. That the New Church will be established in the place of the one that perished is signified by "they shall return from the land of the enemy, and there is hope for the latter end," also by "thy sons shall return to their own border;" "to return from the land of the enemy" signifying to be brought out of hell; "hope for the latter end" signifying the end of the former church and the beginning of the new, and "the sons shall return to their own border" signifying that spiritual truths will exist with those who will be of that New Church. [17] In Isaiah:      I said, I have labored in vain, I have consumed my strength in emptiness and vanity; yet surely my judgment is with Jehovah, and the reward of my work with my God (Isa. 49:4). This, again, is said of the establishment of the New Church by the Lord. That it could not be established with the Jewish nation, because truths could not be received by that nation with any spiritual affection, is meant by "I said, I have labored in vain, I have consumed my strength in emptiness and vanity;" that still a spiritual church is being provided by the Lord, namely, among the Gentiles, is signified by "my judgment is with Jehovah, and the reward of my work is with my God;" "reward" here signifying the church that is in the spiritual affection of truth; and "labor and work" signifying the Lord's combat against the hells and their subjugation, by which the Lord restored the equilibrium between heaven and hell, in which man is able to receive truth and to become spiritual. (On this equilibrium see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 589-603, and in the small work Last Judgment, n. 33, 34, 73, 74.) [18] In David:      Behold, sons are a heritage of Jehovah, the fruit of the womb is a reward; as darts in the hand of the mighty so are the sons of youth; happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them, they shall not be ashamed when they shall speak with enemies in the gate (Ps. 127:3-5). What is here signified by "sons," "fruit of the womb," "darts," "quiver," and "enemies in the gate," may be seen above (n.  357); and that "reward" here also signifies the happiness that those have who are in heaven. [19] In the Gospels:      Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and say every evil word against you falsely for Christ's sake, rejoice and exult, for much is your reward in the heavens; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you (Matt. 5:11, 12; Luke 6:22, 23). This is said of those who fight and conquer in temptations induced by evils, that is, by hell; temptations are signified by "reviling," "persecuting," and "saying an evil word falsely for Christ's sake," for temptations are assaults and infestations of truth and good by falsities and evils; "Christ" means Divine truth from the Lord which is assaulted and on account of which they are infested. "Rejoice and exult, for much is your reward in the heavens," signifies heaven with its joy which those have who are in the spiritual affection of truth, for such only fight and conquer, since the Lord resists and conquers for the man in the combats of temptations, and He is in that affection; "for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you" signifies that previously the truths of doctrine with those who were in the spiritual affection of truth had in like manner been assaulted, for "prophets" in a sense abstracted from persons signify truths from the Word or from the Lord. From what has thus far been cited from the Word it can be seen that "reward" signifies heaven in respect to its blessedness, happiness, and delight, which those have who are in the spiritual affection of truth and good, and that the reward is that affection itself; for it is the same whether you say heaven or that affection, for heaven is in that affection and from it. [20] But those who speak truth and do good not from spiritual affection but from merely natural affection, and who think continually of heaven as a reward, were represented in the Israelitish church by "hired servants," respecting whom there were in that church many statutes, as:      That hired servants should not eat of the Passover (Exod. 12:43, 45);      That they should not eat of the holy things (Lev. 22:10);      That the wages of a hired servant should not abide with anyone during the night until the morning (Lev. 19:13);      That they should not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, either of thy brethren or of the sojourner that is in thy land and in thy gates; in his day thou shalt give him his hire, so that the sun may not go down upon it, lest he cry against thee unto Jehovah, and it be in thee a sin (Deut. 24:14, 15). In Malachi:      I will be against the oppressors of the hired servant in his wages, of the widow, and of the fatherless, and against them that turn aside the sojourner and fear not Me (Mal. 3:5); and elsewhere. Hired servants were forbidden to eat of the Passover and of things sanctified because they represented those that are natural and not spiritual, and the spiritual are of the church, but not so the natural. To look to heaven as a reward on account of the good that is done is natural, for the natural considers good to be from itself, thus heaven to be a reward; and this makes good meritorious. But it is otherwise with the spiritual, which acknowledges good as being not from itself but from the Lord, and thus heaven to be not from any merit but from mercy. Nevertheless, as those signified by "hired servants" still do good, although not from a spiritual affection but from a natural affection, which is obedience, and then think of heaven as a reward, they are mentioned with the "poor," the "needy," the "sojourners," the "fatherless," and the "widows," because they are in spiritual poverty; for genuine truths are obscure to them, because light from heaven does not flow in through their spiritual man into the natural; this is why they are classed with those mentioned above, and it is commanded that "their reward shall be given them before the going down of the sun." Moreover, such are in the lowest regions of the heavens, where they are servants, and are rewarded according to their works (see many things further in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 150-158). [21] But hired servants who do not think of reward in heaven but of reward in the world, thus who do good for the sake of gain, whether it be honors or wealth, thus who do good from the love of honor or wealth, thus, for the sake of self and the world, are infernal-natural. Such "hired servants" are meant in John:      I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd layeth down his soul for the sheep. But a hired servant seeth the wolf and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, because he is a hired servant (John 10:11-13).  And in Jeremiah:      A very fair she-calf is Egypt; destruction cometh out of the north; her hired servants are like fattened calves, for they also are turned, they flee together, they stood not, for the day of their calamity is come upon them (Jer. 46:20, 21); and elsewhere (Isa. 16:14; 21:16). [22] Because in the Word "reward" signifies heaven, which those have who are in the spiritual love of truth and good, so in the contrary sense "reward" signifies hell, which those have who are in the love of falsity and evil. Such is the signification of "reward" in David:      He shall clothe himself with cursing as with his garment and it entereth into the midst of him as waters, and as oil among his bones. This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, and of them that speak evil against my soul (Ps. 109:18, 20).  By this in the spiritual sense the Lord is meant, for where David speaks of himself in the Psalms, in that sense the Lord is meant, David as a king representing the Lord, and thus signifying Him in relation to the Divine-spiritual, which is the Lord's royalty. "The reward of the Lord's adversaries, and of them that speak evil against His soul," is described as a hell from the love of falsity and evil, by this, that "he shall clothe himself with cursing as with his garment" and "it hath entered into the midst of him as waters, and as oil among his bones," these two expressions describing hell as received in externals and in internals, "to clothe himself with cursing as with a garment" describing the hell that is received in externals, and "cursing entering into the midst of him as waters, and as oil among his bones," describing the hell that is received in internals. It is said "as waters," and "as oil," because "waters" signify the falsities of faith, and "oil" the evils of the love, so the two expressions mean the love or affection of falsity and evil, which is hell, as can be seen also from this, that love imbibes all things that are in harmony with it, just as a sponge imbibes water and oil; for the love of evil is nourished by falsities, and the love of falsity is nourished by evils, and love being such, it is said that "cursing enters into the midst of him as waters, and as oil among his bones." [23] Since in the contrary sense "reward" signifies hell in respect to the affection of falsity from evil, therefore the falsification of truth is here and there called in the Word "the reward of whoredom." As in Hosea:      Be not glad, O Israel, unto exultation like the nations, <a name="fr_323"></a><a href="#fn_323"><font size="1">695-5</font></a> for thou hast committed whoredom from under thy God; thou hast loved the reward of whoredom upon all corn-floors; the floor and the wine-vat shall not feed them <a name="fr_324"></a><a href="#fn_324"><font size="1">695-6</font></a> (Hos. 9:1, 2). "To commit whoredom from under God" signifies to falsify the truths of the Word, and to apply the holy things of the church to idolatries; "to love the reward of whoredom" signifies the delight of falsifying and of falsity and of idolatry from infernal love; "upon all corn-floors" signifies all things of the Word and of doctrine from the Word, for "corn," of which bread is made, signifies all things that nourish spiritually, and "floor" signifies where these are gathered together, that is, the Word; "the floor and the wine-vat shall not feed them" signifies not to draw from the Word the good things of charity and love, that is, the things that will nourish the soul, for the "floor" here means the Word in respect to the goods of charity and the "wine-vat" the Word in respect to goods of love, the "vat" here meaning oil, for which as well as for wine there were vats; "and the new wine shall dissemble unto her" signifies that neither shall there be any truth of good; for "new wine," the same as "wine," signifies truth from the good of charity and love. [24] In Micah:      All the graven images of Samaria shall be beaten in pieces, and all the rewards of her whoredom shall be burned up with fire, and all their idols will I lay waste; for she hath brought them together from the reward of whoredom, therefore to the reward of whoredom shall they return; for this I will lament and howl, I will go stripped and naked (Mic. 1:7, 8). "Samaria" means the spiritual church in respect to the truths of doctrine, here in respect to the falsities of doctrine; for their "graven images" signify things falsified, which are from self-intelligence; "the rewards of her whoredom that shall be burned up with fire" signify the falsifications of truth from a love of falsity from evil and the consequent infernal delight; and as that love is from hell it is said that "they shall be burned up with fire," "fire" signifying love in both senses; "and all their idols will I lay waste" signifies the falsities that must be destroyed; "for she hath brought them together from the reward of whoredom" signifies from the love of falsity that is from evil and from the consequent infernal delight; "therefore to the reward of whoredom shall they return" signifies that all things of that church will be truths falsified, because they are thence; "for this I will lament and howl" signifies the grief of the angels of heaven and of the men of the church in whom the church is, and thus with them with whom the Lord is; "I will go stripped and naked" signifies mourning because of the vastation of all truth and good. That "graven images" and "idols" signify doctrinals from self-intelligence favoring the loves of self and of the world and the principles derived therefrom, thus the falsities of doctrine, of religion, and of worship, may be seen above (n. 587, 654). [25] In Ezekiel:      Thou hast built thy eminent place at the head of every way, and thy exalted place in every street; and hast not been as a harlot to glory in reward; the adulterous woman received strangers instead of her husband; they give reward to all harlots, but thou hast given thy rewards to all thy lovers, and hast given them presents that they might come unto thee from every side in thy whoredoms. Thus the contrary is in thee from women in thy whoredoms, that they went not after thee to commit whoredom in giving a reward, and no reward has been given to thee, therefore thou hast been contrary (Ezek. 16:31-34). This chapter treats of the abominations of Jerusalem, that is, of the abominable things of the Jewish Church, in that it not only perverted and adulterated the goods of the Word, but also received falsities of religion and of worship from the idolatrous nations, and thereby adulterated the truths and goods of the Word, and confirmed these adulterations. What "building an eminent place at the head of every way, and making an exalted place in every street" signifies may be seen above (n. 652). That "adulteries and whoredoms" signify in the Word the adulterations and falsifications of the truth and good of the church may be seen above (n. 141, 511); therefore "not to have been as a harlot to glory in reward" signifies not to have so falsified the truths of the Word from the delight of affection; "the adulterous woman received strangers instead of her husband" signifies the truths and goods of the Word perverted by the falsities of other nations; "they give reward to all harlots, but thou hast given thy rewards to all thy lovers and hast given them presents," signifies that they loved the falsities of religion and of the worship of other nations; a "reward or gift of whoredom" meaning the love of falsifying by means of the falsities of others; "that they might come unto thee from every side in thy whoredoms" signifies that falsities were searched for from every direction, whereby truth was falsified; "thus the contrary is in thee from women in thy whoredoms, that they went not after thee to commit whoredom in giving a reward, and no reward has been given to thee, therefore thou hast been contrary," signifies the delight of the love and affection of falsifying the truths of their church by the falsities of other religions, and of confirming such falsities, "the reward or gift of whoredoms" meaning the delight of the love and affection towards the falsities of other religions. [26] From that which has been stated, what is meant spiritually by "reward" in both senses can now be seen; for that which affects with delight and joy is spiritual reward. For example, there are riches, possessions, honors, and gifts, by which a man is rewarded for well-doing; these are not "reward," spiritually understood, but the delights and joys which spring from these; much more is this true of the heavenly reward that the man of the church who lives well will have, which is the spiritual affection of truth, and intelligence and wisdom therefrom, which is the source of blessedness and happiness. Moreover, in heaven there is opulence and magnificence which results from the heavenly love as its correspondent, but yet in heaven it is not opulence and magnificence that are regarded as reward, but the spiritual from which they are. This, too, is what is meant by "the price of a work," and by "reward," which is in the Lord and from the Lord (Isa. 40:10; 61:8; 62:11; Luke 6:35; 14:12-14; and elsewhere). </p>

 <p>And to them that fear Thy name, the small and the great, signifies and to all of whatever religion who worship the Lord. This is evident from the signification of "fearing the name" of the Lord God, as being to worship the Lord (of which presently); also from the signification of "the small and the great," as being of whatever religion; for "the small" mean those who have but little knowledge of the truths and goods of the church, and "the great" those who know much, thus those who worship the Lord little and much; for in the measure that a man knows the truths of faith and lives according to them does he worship the Lord, for worship is not from man but from the truths from good that are with man, since these are from the Lord, and the Lord is in them. "They that fear Thy name, the small and the great," mean all of whatever religion who worship the Lord, because just before "the servants, the prophets and the saints," are mentioned, meaning all within the church who are in the truths of doctrine and in a life according to them; therefore "they that fear Thy name, the small and the great," mean all without the church who worship the Lord according to their religion, for those who are in the worship of the Lord, and live in any faith and charity, according to their religious principle, also fear God's name. In fact, this verse treats of the Last Judgment upon all, both the evil and the good; and the Last Judgment is executed upon all, both those within the church and those outside of it; and then all are saved who fear God and live in mutual love, in uprightness of heart and in sincerity from a religious principle, for all such, by an intuitive faith in God and by a life of charity, are consociated as to their souls with the angels of heaven, and are thus conjoined to the Lord and saved. For after death everyone comes to his own in the spiritual world, with whom he was closely consociated as to his spirit while he was living in the natural world. [2] "The small and the great" signify less or more, that is, those who worship the Lord less or more, thus who are less or more in truths from good, because the spiritual sense of the Word is abstracted from all regard to persons, contemplating the thing nakedly; and the expression "the small and the great" has regard to person, for it means men who worship God; for this reason instead of these less and more are meant in the spiritual sense, thus those who worship less or more from genuine truths and goods. It is similar with "the servants, the prophets and the saints," just above, by whom in the spiritual sense prophets and saints are not meant, but, apart from persons, the truths of doctrine and a life according to them. But while these are meant, all who are in the truths of doctrine and a life according to them are also included, for such truths and life are in subjects which are angels and men; but in such case to think of angels and men only is natural, while to think of the truths of doctrine and life, which make angels and men, is spiritual. Thence it may be clear how the spiritual sense in which the angels are, differs from the natural sense in which men are, namely, that in every particular that a man thinks there inheres something of person, space, time and matter, while angels think things abstractly from all these. Thence it is that the speech of angels is incomprehensible to man, because it is from the intuition of the thing, and thus from a wisdom abstracted from things that are proper to the natural world, and therefore comparatively undetermined to such things. [3] "To fear Thy name" signifies to worship the Lord, because "to fear" signifies to worship, and "Thy name" signifies the Lord. In a preceding verse it is said that the twenty-four elders gave thanks to the Lord God, "who is, and who was, and who is to come;" wherefore "to fear Thy name" means to worship the Lord. In the Word both of the Old and New Testaments, "the name of Jehovah," "the name of the Lord," "the name of God," and "the name of Jesus Christ" are mentioned, and "name" here means all things whereby He is worshipped, thus all things of love and faith, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself is meant, because where He is, there also are all things of love and faith. That such is the signification of "the name of Jehovah," "the Lord God," and "Jesus Christ," may be seen above (n. 102, 135, 224), and is also evident from these words of the Lord:      If two of you shall agree on earth In My name respecting anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them by My Father who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them (Matt. 18:19, 20). Here "to agree in the Lord's name" and "to be gathered together in His name" means not in mere name, but in those things that belong to the Lord, which are the truths of faith and the goods of love by which He is worshipped. [4] "To fear," in reference to the Lord, signifies to worship and reverence, because in worship and in all things of worship there is a holy and reverential fear, which is that the Lord is to be honored and in no way injured; for it is as with children towards parents and parents towards children, with wives towards husbands and husbands towards wives, also as with friends towards friends, in whom there is a fear of injuring and also respect; such a fear with respect is in all love and in all friendship, so that love and friendship without such a fear and respect is like food not salted, which is insipid. This is why "to fear the Lord" means to worship Him from such love. [5] It is said that "to fear Thy name" signifies to worship the Lord, and yet "those who fear Him" mean here all those who are outside of the church, to whom the Lord is unknown, because they do not have the Word; nevertheless, all such as in respect to God have an idea of the Human are still accepted by the Lord, for God under the Human form is the Lord; but all, whether within or without the church, who do not think of God as Man, when they come into their own spiritual life, which takes place after their departure out of this world, are not accepted by the Lord, because they have no determinate idea of God, but only an indeterminate idea, which is no idea at all, or if it be any is nevertheless dissipated. This is why all who come from the earths into the spiritual world are first explored, as to what idea of God they have had and have brought with them. If they have no idea of Him as Man they are sent to places of instruction, where they are taught that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that when they think of God they must think of the Lord, and that otherwise there can be no conjunction with God, and thus no consociation with angels. Then all who have lived a life of charity receive instruction and worship the Lord. But all those who say that they have had faith, but have not been in the life of faith, which is charity, do not accept instruction; consequently they are separated and sent away into places below the heavens, some into the hells, some into the earth that is called in the Word "the lower earth," where they suffer hard things. Still the Gentiles who have made the laws of religion laws of life receive the doctrine respecting the Lord more readily than Christians, and this especially because they had no other idea of God than that of the Divine Man. This has been said that it may be known why it is that "to fear Thy name" means to worship the Lord. [6] In many passages in the Word the expression "to fear Jehovah God" is used, and this means to worship Him; therefore it shall be told in a few words what worship in particular is meant by "fearing God." All worship of Jehovah God must be from the good of love by means of truths. Worship that is from the good of love alone is not worship, neither is worship that is from truths alone, without the good of love, worship; there must be both, since the good of love is the essential of worship, but good has its existence and form by means of truths, therefore all worship must be from good by means of truths. For this reason, in many passages in the Word where the expression "to fear Jehovah God" is used it is added, "to keep and to do His words and commandments;" consequently in these places "to fear" signifies worship by means of truths, and "to keep and do" signifies worship from the good of love, for doing is of the will, thus of the love and of good, but "fearing" is of the understanding, thus of faith and of truth, since every truth that is of faith belongs properly to the understanding, and every good that is of love belongs properly to the will. From this it can be seen that "the fear of Jehovah God" is predicated of worship by means of the truths of doctrine, which are also called truths of faith. Such worship is meant by "the fear of Jehovah God," because Divine truth causes fear in that it condemns the evil to hell; but Divine good does not, since so far as it is received through truths by man and angel it takes away condemnation. Thence it may be seen that so far as man is in the good of love there is fear of God; also that dread and terror disappear and become a holy fear attended with reverence so far as man is in the good of love and in truths therefrom, that is, so far as there is good in his truths. From this it follows that fear in worship varies with each one according to the state of his life; and also that the sanctity attended with reverence that there is in fear with those that are in good, varies also according to the reception of good in the will and according to the reception of truth in the understanding, that is, according to the reception of good in the heart and the reception of truth in the soul. [7] But what has now been said can be seen more clearly from the following passages in the Word. In Moses:      What doth Jehovah thy God ask of thee but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all His ways and to love Him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul? (Deut. 10:12, 20) The expressions "to fear Jehovah God," "to walk in His ways," "to love Him," and "to serve Him," are here used, and by all these worship by truths from good is described; worship by truths is meant by "fearing Jehovah God" and by "serving Him," and worship from good by "walking in His ways" and by "loving Him;" therefore it is also said "with the whole heart and with the whole soul," "heart" signifying the good of love and charity that belongs to the will, and "soul" the truth of doctrine and faith that belongs to the understanding; for "heart" corresponds to the good of love, and in man to his will, and "soul" corresponds to the truth of faith, and in man to his understanding, for soul [anima] means the breathing or respiration of man, which is also called his spirit. (That "soul" signifies in the Word the life of faith, and "heart" the life of love, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 2930, 9050, 9281.) [8] In the same:      Ye shall go after Jehovah your God and ye shall fear Him, that ye may keep His commandments and hear His voice and serve Him and cleave unto Him (Deut. 13:4). "To go after Jehovah God, to keep His commandments, and to cleave unto Him," signifies the good of life, thus the good of love from which is worship; and "to fear Jehovah God, to hear His voice, and to serve Him," signifies the truths of doctrine, thus the truths of faith by means of which is worship. As all worship of the Lord must be by means of truths from good, and not by means of truths without good, nor by means of good without truths, therefore in every particular of the Word there is a marriage of good and truth, as in the passages already cited, and also in the following. (On the marriage of good and truth, in the particulars of the Word, see above, n. 238 at the end, 288, 660.) [9] In the same:      Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God, Him shalt thou serve, and to Him shalt thou cleave, and in His name shalt thou swear (Deut. 10:20). Here also "to fear Jehovah God and to serve Him," has reference to the truths of worship, and "to cleave unto Jehovah God and to swear in His name" has reference to the good of worship; for "to cleave to" is a word of the good of love, since one who loves cleaves to; "to swear in the name of Jehovah" in like manner, since the doing of something is confirmed by it. "To serve" has reference to the truths of worship, because in the Word "servants" mean those who are in truths, and for the reason that truths serve good (see above, n. 6, 409). [10] In the same:      That thou mayest fear Jehovah thy God, to keep all his statutes and His commandments. Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God and Him shalt thou serve, and shalt swear in His name. Ye shall not go after other gods. Jehovah hath commanded us to do all these statutes to fear Jehovah our God (Deut. 6:2, 13, 14, 24).  Here, too, in like manner worship by means of truths from good, or by means of faith from love is described; "to fear Jehovah God and to serve Him" means worship by means of the truths of faith; and "to keep and do His statutes and commandments, and to swear in the name of Jehovah," means worship from the good of love; for to keep and do statutes and commandments is the good of life, which is the same as the good of love, since he lives that loves; "to swear in the name of Jehovah" has a like meaning, for "to swear" means to confirm by life. It has already been said above that "to fear Jehovah and to serve Him" means worship according to the truths of doctrine. For there are two things that constitute worship, namely, doctrine and life; doctrine without life does not constitute it, neither does life without doctrine. [11] The like is taught in the following passages. In Deuteronomy:      Assemble the people that they may hear, and that they may learn and fear Jehovah your God, and may observe to do all the words of the law (Deut. 31:12). In the same: If thou wilt not observe to do all the precepts of this law, to fear this glorious and venerable name, Jehovah thy God (Deut. 28:58). In the same: The king shall write for himself a copy of the law, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, whereby he may learn to fear Jehovah his God, to keep all the words of the law, and the statutes to do them (Deut. 17:18, 19). Thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him (Deut. 8:6). In the same:      Who will give that they may have a heart to fear Me, and to keep all My commandments all the days (Deut. 5:29). In these passages where is mentioned "fearing Jehovah God" there is adjoined "keeping and doing the commandments of the law," also "walking in His ways," for the reason, as has been said, that all internal spiritual worship of God, which consists in the good of life, must be according to the truths of doctrine, because these must teach. Worship according to the truths of doctrine is signified by "fearing Jehovah," and worship from the good of life by "keeping His commandments and walking in his ways," "to walk in the ways of Jehovah" meaning to live according to the truths of doctrine; and as worship according to the truths of doctrine is meant by "fearing Jehovah," therefore it is said that the fear of Jehovah must be learned from the law. But let it be known that "the fear of Jehovah" means the internal spiritual worship that must be in external natural worship, for internal spiritual worship is thinking and understanding truths, thus thinking in a reverent and holy way about God, which is "fearing Him," and external natural worship is doing truths, that is, keeping the commandments and words of the law. [12] In David:      Teach me Thy way, O Jehovah, teach it <a name="fr_325"></a><a href="#fn_325"><font size="1">696-1</font></a> in truth, unite my heart to the fear of Thy name (Ps. 86:11). "To teach the way" signifies to teach the truth according to which man must live; therefore it is said "teach it in truth." That the good of love must be conjoined with the truths of faith is signified by "unite my heart to the fear of Thy name," "heart" signifying the love, "fear" the holiness of faith, and these must be "united," that is, be together in worship. [13] In the same:      Blessed is everyone that feareth Jehovah, that walketh in His ways (Ps. 128:1). Here again, "to fear Jehovah" means to think in a reverent and holy way about God, and "to walk in His ways" means to live according to the Divine truths; it is by means of these two that there is worship. But in external worship, which is living according to Divine truths, there must be internal worship, which is fearing Jehovah; and this is why it is said that "he that feareth Jehovah walketh in His ways." In the same:      Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah, that delighteth exceedingly in His commandments (Ps. 112:1). The signification of this is similar as above; for "to delight exceedingly in Jehovah's commandments" is to love them, thus to will and to do them. [14] In Jeremiah:      They feared not, neither did they go in My law and in My statutes (Jer. 44:10). "Not fearing" stands for not thinking about God from the truths of the Word, thus not thinking in a holy and reverent way; "not to go in God's law and in His statutes," stands for not living according to them, "commandments" meaning the laws of internal worship, and "statutes" the laws of external worship. [15] In Malachi:      If I be a Father, where is My honor? If I be a Lord, where is the fear of Me? (Mal. 1:6) The terms "honor" and "fear" are used because "honor" is predicated of the worship from good, and "fear" of the worship by means of truths (that "honor" is predicated of good may be seen above, n. 288, 345); therefore "honor" is also predicated of Father, and "fear" of Lord, for Jehovah is called "Father" from Divine good, and "Lord" here from Divine truth. [16] In the same:      My covenant was with Levi of life and of peace, which I gave him with fear, and he feared Me (Mal. 2:5). "Levi" means here the Lord in relation to the Divine Human, and "the covenant of life and peace" signifies the union of His Divine with Himself, and "fear" and "to fear" signify holy truth, with which there is union. [17] In Isaiah: The spirit of Jehovah resteth upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and intelligence, the spirit of counsel and of might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah, whence his offering of incense shall be in the fear of Jehovah (Isa. 11:2, 3). This, too, is said of the Lord, and these words describe Divine truth, in which and from which is all wisdom and all intelligence. The Divine truth that was in the Lord when He was in the world, and that since the glorification of His Human proceeds from Him, is meant by "the spirit of Jehovah that rested upon Him;" that thence He has Divine wisdom and Divine power from that source is meant by "the spirit of wisdom and intelligence; and the spirit of council and of might;" that He has omniscience and essential holiness in worship from that source is meant by "the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah;" and as "fear" signifies the holiness of worship from Divine truth it is added "whence His offering of incense shall be in the fear of Jehovah," "to offer incense" signifying worship from the Divine spiritual, which is Divine truth. (That this is what "offering incense" signifies see above, n. 324, 491, 492, 494, 567.) It is said "the spirit of wisdom, intelligence, knowledge, and fear," for "spirit" means the Divine proceeding, "the spirit of wisdom" the celestial Divine, which is the Divine proceeding as received by the angels of the kingdom of the inmost or third heaven, "the spirit of intelligence" the spiritual Divine which is the Divine proceeding as received by the angels of the middle or second heaven, "the spirit of knowledge" the natural Divine, which is the Divine proceeding as received by the angels of the lowest or first heaven, and "the spirit of the fear of Jehovah" all holiness of worship from the celestial, spiritual, and natural Divine. [18] In Jeremiah:      I will give them one heart and one way, to fear Me all the days for good to them; and I will make with them the covenant of an age; and My fear will I give into their heart that they may not depart from with Me (Jer. 32:39, 40). "I will give them one heart and one way to fear Me" signifies one will and one understanding to worship the Lord, "heart" signifying the good of the will, "way" the truth of the understanding which leads, and "fear" holy worship therefrom. "I will make with them the covenant of an age, and My fear will I give into their heart," signifies conjunction through the good of love and through the truth of that good in worship, "covenant" meaning conjunction, and "fear in the heart" the holiness of worship from truth in the good of love; "that they may not depart from with Me" signifies for the sake of conjunction. Because conjunction with the Lord is effected by means of truths from good, and not by means of truth without good, nor by means of good without truths, both are here mentioned. [19] In David:      O house of Aaron trust ye in Jehovah, ye that fear Jehovah trust in Jehovah (Ps. 115:10, 11). "House of Aaron" signifies all who are in the good of love, and "those that fear Jehovah" signify all who are in truth from that good. In Revelation: The angel who had the eternal Gospel said, Fear ye God and give Him glory, worship Him (Rev. 14:7). "To fear God and to give Him glory" signifies to worship the Lord from holy truths; and "to worship Him" signifies from the good of love. In David:      Let all the earth fear Jehovah; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him. Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear Him, that wait for His mercy (Ps. 33:8, 18).       The good pleasure of Jehovah is in them that fear Him, in them that wait for His mercy (Ps. 147:11). Because "the fear of Jehovah" signifies the reception of Divine truth, and "mercy" the reception of Divine good, it is said that "the eye" and "the good pleasure of Jehovah are upon them that fear Him, that wait for His mercy." [20] In Isaiah:      The strong people shall honor Thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear Thee (Isa. 25:3). Here again, worship from good is signified by "to honor," for "honor" is predicated of the good of love; and worship from truths is signified by "fearing the Lord," as has been said above. "The strong people" signifies men of the church who are in truths from good, wherefrom is all power; "the city of the terrible nations" signifies those who are in truths of doctrine, and through these in the good of love; and as all spiritual power is therefrom they are called "terrible nations." These words, too, show clearly that there is a marriage of good and truth in every particular of the Word; for "to honor" is predicated of good, "to fear" of truth, both in worship; the term "people" is used of those who are in truths, and through these in good, but the term "nations" of those who are in good, and from good in truths; and as all power in the spiritual world is from the conjunction of good and truth, the people are called "strong," and the nations are called "terrible." [21] "The fear of Jehovah" signifies worship in which there is holiness through truths, in the following passages also. In Isaiah:      The heart of the people hath departed far from Me, and their fear toward Me hath become a commandment taught of men (Isa. 29:13). In the same      Who among you feareth Jehovah, heareth the voice of His servant? He that walketh in darkness, and hath no brightness, that trusteth In the name of Jehovah, and leaneth upon his God (Isa. 50:10). In Jeremiah:      They shall hear every good that I do unto them, that they may dread and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I am about to do unto them (Jer. 33:9). In David:      The angel of Jehovah encampeth about them that fear Him to deliver them. Fear Jehovah, ye His saints, for there is no want to them that fear Him (Ps. 34:7, 9). In the same:      Who have no changes, neither fear they God (Ps. 55:19). In the same:      The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do them [His commandments] (Ps. 111:10). Because "fear" has respect to Divine truth, from which is holiness in worship and wisdom and intelligence, therefore it is said, "the fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, a good understanding, that is intelligence, have all they that do them [His commandments]." In the same:      They that fear Jehovah shall praise Him, all the seed of Jacob shall honor Him, and all the seed of Israel shall fear Him (Ps. 22:23). In Luke:      The mercy of God is unto generation of generations to them that fear Him (Luke 1:50). [22] That "to fear Jehovah God" involves and thence signifies to have a sense of holiness and reverence and accordingly to worship with holiness and reverence, can be seen from these passages. In Moses:      Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and My sanctuary ye shall fear; ye shall reverence (Lev. 19:30; 26:2). In the same:      A work of Jehovah, how is that to be feared [reverenced] which I will do (Exod. 34:10). In the same:      And Jacob feared and said, How to be feared [reverenced] is this place; this is none other than the house of God, and the gate of heaven (Gen. 28:17). That in reference to the Divine and the holiness of heaven and the church, "to fear" signifies to revere and to hold in reverence, is evident from these passages, also from this, that the same word in the Hebrew that means "to fear" means also to revere and to venerate. This is evident, too, from those words in Luke:      There was a judge in a certain city who feared not God and reverenced not man. And he said within himself, Although I fear not God and reverence not man . . . (Luke 18:2, 4). It is said "to fear God" and "to reverence man" because fearing means reverencing in a higher degree. [23] In Matthew:      Jesus said, Fear not them who are able to kill the body but are not able to kill the soul; rather fear Him who is able to destroy both body and soul in Gehenna (Matt. 10:28; Luke 12:4, 5, 7). Here, however, "to fear" signifies to have a fear of dying spiritually, thence a natural fear, which is fearfulness and dread; but spiritual fear is a holy fear that abides within every spiritual love variously according to the quality and quantity of the love. In such a fear is the spiritual man, and he knows that the Lord does not do evil to anyone, much less does He destroy anyone as to body and soul in Gehenna, but that He does good to all and desires to raise up everyone as to body and soul into heaven to Himself. This is why the fear of the spiritual man is a holy fear lest by the evil of life and the falsity of doctrine man should turn away, and thus do harm to that Divine love in himself. But natural fear is a fearfulness, dread, and terror of dangers and punishments, and thus of hell; this fear abides within every corporeal love, also variously according to the quality and quantity of the love. The natural man who has such fear does not know otherwise than that the Lord does evil to the evil, condemns them, casts them into hell, and punishes them, and on this account such persons are in fear and dread of the Lord. In this fear were most of the Jewish and Israelitish nation, because they were natural men; and this is why they are so often said in the Word "to be afraid of" and "to tremble before Jehovah," and also "to be in fear and trembling;" and for the same reason it is said of the sons of Israel that they were "sore afraid" when the Divine law or Divine truth was promulgated from Mount Sinai (Exod. 20:18-20; Deut. 5:23-25). [24] This fear is what is meant in part by:      The dread of Isaac by which Jacob sware to Laban (Gen. 31:42, 53); for "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," mean in the Word the Lord, "Abraham," the Lord in respect to the celestial Divine, "Isaac," in respect to the spiritual Divine, and "Jacob," in respect to the natural Divine; the spiritual Divine which "Isaac" signifies is the Divine truth, which terrifies the natural man, and as "Laban" was a natural man, so Jacob sware to him "by the dread or terror of Isaac." Nearly the same fear is meant in Isaiah:      Ye shall sanctify Jehovah of Hosts, for He is your fear and your dread (Isa. 8:13). Here the term "fear" has reference to the spiritual man, and "dread" to the natural man. That the spiritual man may not be in such fear as the natural man is in, it is said "Fear not." In Isaiah:      Jacob and Israel, Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, calling thee by thy name, thou art Mine (Isa. 43:1). In Luke:      Fear not, little flock; for it hath pleased your Father to give you the kingdom (Luke 12:32). And in Jeremiah:      Fear not, O Jacob, My servant, and be not dismayed, O Israel, for I will save thee from afar; Jacob shall be tranquil and quiet, none shall make him afraid (Jer. 30:9, 10). And in many other passages. Moreover, that "fear," "terror," "consternation," and the like, signify various commotions of the disposition and changes of state of the mind, may be seen above (n. 667, 677). </p>

 <p>And to destroy them that are destroying the earth, signifies hell to those who destroy the church. This is evident from the signification of "to destroy," as being, in reference to those that destroy the church, damnation and hell; for as "to give the reward to His servants, the prophets and the saints," signifies salvation and heaven to those who are in truths from good, that is, who constitute the church, so "to destroy" the earth signifies damnation and hell. Also from the signification of the "earth," as meaning the church (of which above, n. 29, 304, 413, 417); therefore "to destroy the earth" signifies to destroy the church. That in the Word the "earth" means the church has been shown frequently above, also in the Arcana Coelestia. There are many reasons why in the Word the "earth" signifies the church; that is, when no land in particular is mentioned, as the land of Egypt, of Edom, of Moab, of Assyria, of Chaldea, of Babylon, and others, the "earth" (or land) means the land of Canaan, and that land, to those who are in spiritual thought, does not suggest the idea of a land which is earthly, not heavenly, but the idea of the quality of the nation there in respect to the church. So again, when the church, or religion, or worship, is in one's thought, and from this lands are mentioned, the land is not thought of, but the quality of the nation of the land in respect to the church, religion, or worship. For this reason when a man in reading the Word mentions a land, the angels, who are spiritual, think of the church; and what the angels think is the spiritual sense of the Word; for the spiritual sense of the Word is for the angels, and also for those men who are spiritual. For the Word in the letter is natural, and yet inwardly or in its bosom it is spiritual; and whenever the natural is withdrawn the spiritual that is within or in its bosom is disclosed. [2] Moreover, there are lands in the spiritual world, that is, in the world where spirits and angels are, equally as in the natural world where men are, and these lands are altogether alike in external appearance; there are there plains, valleys, mountains, hills, and there are rivers, and seas, and also fields, meadows, forests, gardens, and paradises; and those lands are in appearance beautiful in exact accord with the state of the church with those who dwell upon them, and they undergo changes in accord with the changes of the church with the inhabitants; in a word, there is a full correspondence of the lands there with the reception of the good of love and the truth of faith with those who dwell there. It is for this reason also that "land" in the Word signifies the church, for in that world according to the quality of the land is the quality of the church there, and correspondence is what makes it be so. In that world the land itself makes one with the church, as a correspondent with its own thing to which it corresponds, just as an effect does with its effecting cause, as the eye with its sight, as speech with its understanding, as action with the will, as the expression of the face with the affection of the thought, in a word, as the instrumental with its principal, of which it is said that they make one thing; so in the spiritual world the quality of the land makes one with that of the church. From this it is clear why in the Word "land (or earth)" signifies the church, and "to destroy the earth" signifies here to destroy the church. [3] So also in the following passages. In Isaiah:      Is this the man that maketh the earth to tremble, that maketh the kingdoms to quake, that made the world a wilderness, and threw down the cities thereof? Thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people (Isa. 14:16, 17, 20.) This is said of Lucifer, by whom Babylon is here meant, as is evident from what here precedes and follows; and "the earth that he maketh to tremble and that he destroyed" signifies the church; the "kingdoms that he maketh to quake" signify the churches into which the general church is divided; the "world that he made a wilderness" signifies the church in general; the "cities that he threw down" signify its truths of doctrine; and the "people that he slew" signify the men of the church whose spiritual life he destroyed. [4] In Jeremiah:      Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, destroying the whole earth (Jer. 51:25). This, too, is said of Babylon, which is called a destroying mountain, because a "mountain" signifies the love of ruling, here over heaven and earth, which the goods and truths of the church are made to serve as means; therefore "to destroy the whole earth" signifies to destroy the church. [5] In Daniel:      The fourth beast coming up out of the sea shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down and break it in pieces (Dan. 7:23). This beast, too, signifies the love of ruling over the whole heaven and the whole earth, which love those have who are of Babylon (see above, n. 316, 556); therefore "to devour," "to tread down," and "to break in pieces the earth," signifies to destroy the church utterly. Who does not see that no beast is to come up out of the sea and devour and tread down and break in pieces the whole earth, but that it is some evil and diabolical love that will do thus to the church? In Moses:      There shall not be anymore a flood to destroy the earth (Gen. 9:11). Here again "the earth" also signifies the church that was destroyed by the antediluvians, but was not again to be destroyed. [6] In Isaiah:      Jehovah maketh the earth void and maketh it empty, and He shall overturn the faces thereof. In emptying the earth shall be emptied, and In spoiling it shall be spoiled; the habitable earth shall mourn, shall be confounded; the world shall languish, shall be confounded; the earth itself shall be profaned because they have transgressed the laws, overstepped the statute, made void the covenant of eternity, therefore a malediction shall devour the earth. The floodgates from on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth quake; in breaking the earth is broken, in moving the earth is moved, in staggering the earth shall stagger as a drunkard, and it shall be moved to and fro as a balance (Isa. 24:1, 3-6, 18-20). Anyone can see that "the earth" here does not mean the earth, but the church. This is said of the church, because the earths (or lands) in the spiritual world, upon which angels and spirits dwell, undergo such changes as are here described according to the changes of state of the church with those who dwell there; they are even moved accordingly. It is said that "Jehovah maketh the earth void and maketh it empty," also that "in emptying it shall be emptied, and in spoiling it shall be spoiled," because the lands there, when the church is laid waste with those who dwell upon them, altogether change their appearance; the paradises, flower gardens, lawns, and the like, with which they before flourished disappear, and things that are unpleasant, such as sandy and rocky places, and plains full of brambles and briars, and like things corresponding to the falsities and evils that have devastated the church, spring up in their place. The devastation of the church in respect to the good of love and charity is signified by "making the earth void," and its desolation in respect to the truths of doctrine and faith is signified by "making it empty and spoiling it," and the change itself by "overturning its faces." "The habitable earth shall mourn, shall be confounded, the world shall languish, shall be confounded, a malediction shall devour the earth," signifies that nothing shall there grow and flourish, but that it shall become barren and filled with useless things, on account of which the earth is said "to mourn, to languish, and to be devoured with a malediction." Because this takes place when those that dwell there have no longer any regard for the holy things of the church, it is said, "because they have transgressed the laws, overstepped the statute, made void the covenant of eternity." Because there the lands are sometimes overflowed, sometimes shaken, and also here and there gape and open towards the hell that lies below and that lifts itself up, and this takes place according to the quality and quantity of the falsities and evils that are loved, and the consequent falsification and denial of the goods and truths of the church, therefore it is said that "the floodgates from on high shall be opened, the foundations of the earth shall quake, the earth shall be broken, and shall stagger like a drunkard," and these things actually take place in the spiritual world, when the state of the church there is changed into a contrary state. From this it can be seen why "the earth" here and elsewhere in the Word, means the church. </p>

 <p>Verse 19. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His Covenant; and there were lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail. 19. "And the temple of God was opened in heaven," signifies the appearing of the new heaven and the New Church where there is worship of the Lord (n. 699); "and there was seen in His temple the ark of His Covenant," signifies Divine truth, by which there is conjunction with the Lord (n. 700, 701); "and there were lightnings, voices, and thunders," signifies that then in the lower parts, where the evil are, there were conflicts and disturbances of the thoughts and reasonings from evil and falsity respecting good and truth (n. 702); "and an earthquake," signifies a change of state in respect to the things of heaven and the church with them (n. 703); "and great hail," signifies infernal falsity destroying the truths and goods of the church (n. 704). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="699.">699.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 19. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, signifies the appearing of the new heaven and the New Church, where there is worship of the Lord. This is evident from the signification of "temple" as being heaven and the church, here the new heaven and the New Church; the appearing of these is signified by "the temple was opened." (That "temple" signifies in the highest sense the Lord in relation to His Divine Human and Divine truth proceeding from Him, and in a relative sense heaven and the church, may be seen above, n. 220, 391, 630.)  The "temple" signifies here the new heaven and the New Church where there is worship of the Lord, because this chapter treats of the changes of state that precede the Last Judgment, namely, the separation of the evil from the good, and their removal from the places where they had been previously. When this is done, the new heaven and the New Church appear to those who are in the higher heavens. These could not appear so long as the good were conjoined with the evil, because their interiors were closed that they might not be harmed by the evil with whom they had communication in respect to externals. But when the evil had been separated and removed, then the interiors with the good, which were in themselves heavenly, were opened, and when these had been opened, heaven and the church lay open; for so far as the interiors which are heavenly and celestial are opened, what heaven is in relation to the church with those who have heaven and the church in them, becomes manifest. [2] From self-intelligence no one can know that these things are so, for they are arcana of heaven, that must be learned from revelation. For who can know how the Last Judgment was accomplished, or what changes in the spiritual world preceded it and what followed it? But that these things might be known they have been manifested to me, wherefore it is permitted me to describe them here from revelation. It is said, the new heaven and the New Church, where there is worship of the Lord, because in the new heaven and the New Church the Lord alone is worshipped; for there the Divine is not distinguished into three persons, but into a Trine in one person. (Respecting this Trinity see what has been said in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 250-310). This also is what is meant in Revelation where the New Jerusalem is treated of:      I saw heaven <a name="fr_326"></a><a href="#fn_326"><font size="1">699-1</font></a> and no temple therein, for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof (Rev. 21:22). "The Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb" mean the Lord in relation to the Divine Itself and the Divine Human. It is here said that no temple was seen, because "temple" signifies in the highest sense, the Lord in relation to Divine truth and worship (see above, n. 220, 391, 630), also because "the New Jerusalem" means the church in respect to doctrine, or the doctrine of the New Jerusalem. Nevertheless there are temples in heaven, in which the Lord is preached and Divine truth is taught. </p>
 
 
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="700.">700.</a></font></span>
 <p>And there was seen in his temple the ark of His Covenant, signifies Divine truth, by which there is conjunction with the Lord. This is evident from the signification of "the ark of the Covenant," as being Divine truth proceeding from the Lord (of which presently). "The ark of the Covenant" was seen, because "the temple" appeared, and the ark was in the midst of the temple at Jerusalem, and in it were placed the two tables of the law, which signify in a universal sense Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, thus the Lord Himself, who is Divine truth in the heavens; for which reason the Lord is called the Word, in John 1:1, 2, 14. This is the signification of "the ark," because the Tent of meeting represented the three heavens, its court the lowest or first heaven; the tent itself as far as the veil, wherein were the tables for the loaves, the altar of incense, and the lampstand, represented the middle or second heaven; and the ark, which was within the veil, upon which was the mercy-seat with the cherubim, represented the inmost or third heaven; and the law itself which was in the ark, represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth or the Word; and because there is conjunction with the Lord by means of the Word, that ark was called "the ark of the Covenant," "covenant" signifying conjunction. (That the tent or tabernacle represented the form of heaven, and, together with the court, represented the three heavens, and that the holy of holies, which was the inmost, where the ark was, within which were the tables of the law, represented the third or inmost heaven, and that the law or testimony represented the Lord Himself, may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia, n. 3478, 9457, 9481, 9485. And that in the highest sense "the tabernacle," the same as "the temple," signifies the Lord, and in a relative sense heaven and the church, and thence the holiness of worship, n. 9457, 9481, 10242, 10245, 10304, 10545. That in the Word "covenant" signifies conjunction, and that all things of the church, both internal and external, are signs of the covenant, and that they are called covenant because conjunction is effected by means of them, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 2037, 6804, 8767, 8778, 9396, 9416, 10632. Consequently that the law promulgated on Mount Sinai was called a "covenant," and the ark containing the law "the ark of the Covenant," n. 6804, 9416.)  [2] That the ark with the covenant or testimony inclosed, signifies the Lord in respect to the celestial Divine which is Divine truth in the inmost or third heaven, can be seen from what is said of the ark in the Word. As in Moses:      They shall make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in the midst of them, according to all that I have shown thee, the form of the habitation. First, they shall make an ark of shittim wood; and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it; and thou shalt make for it a border of gold; four rings of gold for the staves. And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony that I will give thee. And thou shalt make a mercy-seat of pure gold; and thou shalt make two cherubim of gold, solid shalt thou make them out of the mercy-seat that the cherubim may spread out their wings, and cover the mercy-seat with their wings; and their faces shall be towards the mercy-seat. And thou shalt put the testimony into the ark; and there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the Testimony, of all things which I shall command thee unto the sons of Israel (Exod. 25:8-22).      Thou shalt make a veil of hyacinthine and purple, and scarlet double dyed, and fine twined linen, with cherubim. Thou shalt put it upon four pillars of shittim overlaid with gold; and thou shalt place the veil under the clasps; and thou shalt bring in thither within the veil the ark of the Testimony; so that the veil shall divide unto you between the holy place and the holy of holies; and thou shalt put the veil before the ark in the holy of holies (Exod. 26:31-34). It was said above that the tent where there were the ark, the lampstand, the table for the loaves, and the altar for incense, together with the court, represented the three heavens, and that the place within the veil where the ark was that contained the law or testimony, represented the third heaven. That place represented that heaven, because the law was there, and the "law" means the Lord in relation to Divine truth or the Word, for this in a broad sense is what that "law" signifies, and it is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord that forms the heavens. This is received in the greatest purity by the angels of the third heaven, because they are in conjunction with the Lord through love to Him, since all angels in that heaven are in love to the Lord; consequently they see Divine truth in themselves, like something implanted, although it flows in continually from the Lord. For this reason that heaven more than the other heavens which are below it, is said to be in the Lord, because it is in the Divine that proceeds from Him. [3] It was that heaven that was represented by the ark that contained the law, that is, the Lord. This is why the ark was overlaid with gold within and without, and the mercy-seat was over the ark, and over the mercy-seat and out of it were the two cherubim which were of pure gold; for gold signifies from correspondence the good of love, in which are the angels of the third heaven. The "mercy-seat" signified the hearing and reception of all things of the worship that is from the good of love from the Lord; and the "cherubim" signified the Lord's providence and guard that He be not approached except through the good of love. That heaven with its angels is a guard against anything being elevated to the Lord Himself except what proceeds from the good of love to Him and from Him. For all worship of God passes through the heavens even to the Lord, and is purified in the way, until it is elevated to the third heaven, and there it reaches <a name="fr_327"></a><a href="#fn_327"><font size="1">700-1</font></a> the Lord and is received by Him; everything else, being impure, is removed on the way. This is why cherubim of gold were placed over the mercy-seat, which was over the ark; also why that place was called a sanctuary, and also the holy of holies, and was divided from the outer part of the tabernacle by the veil. [4] That the tent with the court represented the three heavens is evident also from this, that all things instituted among the sons of Israel were representatives of heavenly things; for the church itself was a representative church; thus especially the tabernacle with the altar was the most holy thing of worship; for worship was celebrated upon the altar by burnt-offerings and sacrifices, and in the tabernacle by incense offerings, and by the lamps that were lighted every day, and by the loaves that were placed in order daily upon the table. All these represented all worship in heaven and in the church, and the tent itself with the ark represented the heavens themselves. For this reason that tabernacle was called "the dwelling place of Jehovah God," as heaven itself is called. That the heavens were represented by the tabernacle is evident also from this, that the form of it was shown to Moses by the Lord upon Mount Sinai, and what is shown in form by the Lord must represent either heaven or the things belonging to heaven. That the form of the tabernacle was shown to Moses upon Mount Sinai, can be seen from what was said to Moses:      Let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell In the midst of them, according to all that I have shown thee, the form of the habitation. [And afterwards:] See and make them in their form which thou wast made to see in the mount (Exod. 25:8, 9, 40). That is why it is called "a sanctuary," and it is said "that I may dwell in the midst of them." In respect to the ark in particular, that is, what it signifies, also "the mercy-seat over it," and "the cherubim over the mercy-seat," as also "the border of gold round about the ark," and also "the four rings for the staves," also "the veil," "the clasps," and the other things, all this may be seen explained in the Arcana Coelestia (n. 9484- 9577, 9670-9680). [5] The holiness itself of the whole tabernacle was from the testimony, that is, from the two tables of stone on which the law was written, because "the law" signified the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and thus in relation to the Word, for that is Divine truth. That the Lord is the Word is evident from what is said in John:      The Word was with God, and God was the Word, and the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (John 1:1, 2, 14). That the law, which is called both "the testimony" and "the covenant," was placed in the ark, likewise the book written by Moses, can be seen from these words in Moses:      Thou shalt put into the ark the testimony that I shall give thee (Exod. 25:16; 40:20).      I put the tables of the law in the ark that I had made, that they might be there, even as Jehovah commanded me (Deut. 10:5). And of the book of the law written by Moses:      When Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law upon the book, even when he had finished them, Moses commanded the Levites that bare the ark to take the book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the Covenant, that it might be there for a witness (Deut. 31:24-26). This shows that there was nothing inside of the ark except the two tables of stone on which the law was written, and that the book of Moses was by the side of it. That there was nothing in the ark except the two tables of the covenant is evident from the first book of Kings:      There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, the covenant which Jehovah made with the sons of Israel (1 Kings 8:9). That the book of Moses which was laid by the side of the ark was afterwards taken out and preserved in the temple is shown by the fact:      That Hilkiah the high priest found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah and gave it to Shaphan, who told it unto the king, and read it before the king (2 Kings 22:8-11). [6] That the ark represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and consequently signified Divine truth from the Lord, thus the Word, is shown by the fact that from it the Lord spoke with Moses, for it is said:      Thou shalt put the testimony into the ark; and there I will meet thee, and I will speak with thee from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the Testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the sons of Israel (Exod. 25:21, 22); and elsewhere:      When Moses went into the Tent of meeting to speak with Him he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from above the mercy-seat that was upon the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim; thus He spake unto him (Num. 7:89). The Lord spoke to Moses therefrom because the law was there, and that law signifies in a broad sense the Lord in relation to the Word, and from the Word the Lord speaks with man; it was "from above the mercy-seat between the two cherubim," because "the mercy-seat" signifies the removal of falsities that are from evil loves, and at the same time reception and hearing, and "the cherubim" signify a guard that there be no approach except through the good of love. [7] Because the Lord in heaven and in the church is Divine truth or the Word, which is meant by the law inclosed in the ark, and because the Lord is present in the law or the Word, so where the ark was, there was Jehovah or the Lord, as can be seen from these words in Moses:      Moses said to Jehovah, <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">700-2</font></a> Leave us not, I pray; forasmuch as thou knowest how we must encamp in the wilderness, therefore thou wilt be to us instead of eyes; and it shall be when thou shalt go with us, yea, it shall be that the good that Jehovah shall do unto us, the same good we will do unto thee. And they journeyed from the mount of Jehovah a way of three days, and the ark of the Covenant of Jehovah journeyed before them a way of three days to search out a resting place for them; and the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day, when they journeyed from the camp. When the ark journeyed Moses said, Arise, O Jehovah, let Thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate Thee flee from before Thy faces; and when it rested he said, Return, O Jehovah, to the myriads of the thousands of Israel (Num. 10:31-36). It is clear from these particulars that Jehovah or the Lord is here meant by "the ark" because of His presence in the law that was in the ark, thus because of His presence in the Word. Since the Lord is here meant by the law, and thus by the ark, "Moses said, Arise, O Jehovah, that Thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate Thee flee from before Thy faces; and when it rested he said, Return, O Jehovah, to the myriads of the thousands of Israel." But still more interior things are involved in these words, namely, that the Lord by His Divine truth leads men and defends them against falsities and evils, which are from hell, especially in temptations, which are signified in particular by the journeyings of the sons of Israel in the wilderness forty years. That the Lord leads men continually by His Divine truth is signified by "the ark of the Covenant of Jehovah journeyed before them a way of three days to search out a resting place for them," "the ark of Jehovah" meaning the Lord in relation to Divine truth, "journeying a way of three days" meaning His auspices and leading from beginning to end, and "searching out" signifying salvation, which is the end. [8] Moreover, protection from falsities and evils which are from hell is signified by "the cloud of Jehovah over them by day," as well as by the words of Moses when the ark journeyed, "Arise, O Jehovah, let Thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate Thee flee from before Thy faces;" "the cloud of Jehovah by day" signifies also protection by Divine truth in ultimates, such as the Word is in the sense of the letter, for by such truth the Lord can be approached even by the evil, and by it He defends the interior things of the Word, which are celestial and spiritual. (That this sense of the Word is signified by a "cloud" may be seen above, n. 594.) "Enemies" and "them that hate" signify falsities and evils that are from hell, "enemies" falsities, and "them that hate" evils, thus they signify the hells in respect to falsities and evils. Truths from good, which are implanted in man after temptations, are signified by "when the ark rested Moses said, Return, O Jehovah, to the myriads of the thousands of Israel;" "the resting of the ark" signifies the state after temptations, when evils and falsities have been removed; "to return" signifies the Lord's presence at that time, for in temptations the Lord appears to be absent; "the myriads of the thousands of Israel" signify the truths from good implanted, which constitute the church. (That "myriads" are predicated of truths, and "thousands" of goods, see above, n. 336.) [9] There is a like significance in these words in David:      Lo, we have heard of Him in Ephrathah, we have found Him in the fields of the forest; we will come into His habitations, we will bow ourselves down at His footstool. Arise, O Jehovah, to Thy resting place, Thou and the ark of Thy strength. Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness and let Thy saints shout for joy (Ps. 132:6-9). Evidently this Psalm treats of the Lord, who is here meant by "David," as can be seen from its being said, "We have found Him in Ephrathah and in the fields of the forest," also that "they bowed themselves down at His footstool;" "Ephrathah" meaning Bethlehem where the Lord was born, and signifying the Word in respect to its natural sense, while "Bethlehem" signifies the Word in respect to its spiritual sense; and there He chose to be born because the Lord is the Word; "the fields of the forest" signify the things of the natural sense of the Word, thus of the sense of the letter; while "His habitations" signify the spiritual sense of the Word, also heaven, since heaven is in that sense. The "footstool" to which they shall bow themselves down signifies the natural sense of the Word, and thence also the church on earth, since the church is in that sense. (That the "footstool" of the Lord means the church on earth, see above, n. 606.) [10] The "resting place" to which Jehovah should arise signifies the union of the Divine and the Human in the Lord, and His conjunction with heaven and the church; and because the Lord, and also those who are in heaven and in the church, have rest and peace when He has subjugated the hells and has brought all things there and in the heavens into order, it is said, "Arise, Thou and the ark of Thy strength," "Thou" meaning the Lord Himself, and "the ark of Thy strength" Divine truth proceeding from Him, for through this the Lord has Divine power. The "priests who shall be clothed with righteousness" and the "saints who shall shout for joy," have a similar signification as "the thousands and myriads of Israel," "priests" meaning those who are in good, and "saints" those who are in truths, thus in an abstract sense the goods and truths of heaven and the church. (That "priests" in an abstract sense signify the goods of the church may be seen above, n. 31 at the end, and that "saints" in that sense signify the truths of the church, n. 204, 325.) More about this Psalm may be seen above (n. 684). [11] Because the ark, from the law that was in it, signified the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and the Lord has omnipotence from Divine good through Divine truth, therefore by means of the ark miracles were wrought. Thus by means of it the waters of Jordan were divided, so that the sons of Israel passed over on dry ground; the wall of the city of Jericho was overthrown; Dagon, the god of the Ashdodites, fell down before it; the Ashdodites, the Gittites, the Ekronites, and the Bethshemites, were smitten with plagues on account of it; Uzzah died because he touched it; Obed-edom, into whose house it was brought, was blessed. As these historical facts involve arcana that can be opened only by the spiritual sense I also will explain them, that it may be known what the ark signifies in a strict sense and in a broad sense. First, respecting the division of the waters of Jordan that the sons of Israel might pass through on dry ground, in Joshua:      Joshua and all the sons of Israel came to Jordan; and at the end of three days Joshua commanded, saying, When ye shall see the ark of the Covenant of Jehovah, and the priests, the Levites, bearing it, ye shall journey from your place and shall go after it; yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits; ye shall not draw near unto it. And the priests lifted up the ark of the Covenant and went before the people. And Joshua said, When ye shall come to the brink of the waters of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan. And he said unto the people, Behold, the ark of the Covenant of the Lord of the whole earth passing over before you into Jordan; and take ye twelve men of the tribes of Israel; and when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of Jehovah the Lord of the whole earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan, the waters of Jordan shall be cut off, even the waters that come down from above shall stand in one heap. And it came to pass when the priests came unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brink of the waters, and Jordan was full, as it was wont to be all the days of harvest, the waters that came down from above stood in one heap, stretching out very far from the city Adam; and those that came down upon the sea of the plain, the sea of salt, were completely cut off, so that the people could pass over towards Jericho. And the priests stood on the dry ground in the midst of Jordan; and all the people passed over on dry ground. Afterwards Jehovah said unto Joshua, Take to you twelve men, one of a tribe; and lift up out of the midst of Jordan, from where the priests' feet stood, twelve stones, which ye shall bring over with you, and leave in the place where ye pass the night. And the sons of Israel did so; and they lifted up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, according to the numbers of the tribes of Israel, and they carried them over unto the place where they passed the night. Then after that all the people had finished passing over, the ark of Jehovah passed over, and the priests. And it came to pass when the priests were come up and the soles of their feet were plucked out, the waters of Jordan returned into their place. And the twelve stones which they took out of Jordan did Joshua set up in Gilgal (Josh. 3:1-17; 4:1-20). All the historicals of the Word, as well as its prophetical parts, contain a spiritual sense that treats, not of the sons of Israel and of nations and peoples, but of the church and its establishment and progress, for this is the spiritual of the Word, while the history is the natural that contains the spiritual. Therefore also all the miracles described in the Word, as the miracles done in Egypt and afterwards in the land of Canaan, involve such things as belong to heaven and the church, and for this reason also these miracles are Divine. [12] The miracle described above signifies the introduction of the faithful into the church, and through the church into heaven. "The sons of Israel" mean here in the spiritual sense the faithful, who after enduring temptations, which are signified by their wanderings in the wilderness, are brought into the church; for "the land of Canaan," into which the sons of Israel were brought, signifies the church, and "Jordan" signifies the first entrance into it; and "the waters of Jordan" signify truths that introduce into it, which are such as those of the literal sense of the Word, for those are what first introduce. But here "Jordan" and its waters signify the falsities of evil which conduct towards hell, since the land of Canaan was then filled with idolatrous nations, which signify evils and falsities of every kind, which constitute hell; for this reason these were to be driven out, that there might be a place for establishing the church. Because "the waters of Jordan" then signified the falsities of evil, they were parted and removed, to give a passage to the sons of Israel, who were to represent the church. [13] Now as the Lord alone removes and scatters the falsities of evil that are from hell, and by His Divine truths introduces the faithful into the church and into heaven, and as the ark and the law inclosed in it represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, it was commanded that the ark should go before the people and thus lead them. This is why it came to pass that as soon as the priests bearing the ark dipped their feet in the waters of Jordan those waters were divided and went down, and the people passed over on dry land, and after this was done the waters returned. Then these same waters signified truths that introduce; for Jordan was the first boundary of the land of Canaan, and that land, when the sons of Israel had entered into it, represented the church, and that river introduction into it. [14] As the waters of Jordan signified truths that introduce they were commanded to take up out of the midst of it twelve stones, and carry them over to the first place where they passed the night, and this because "stones" signify truths, and "twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of Israel" signified the truths of the church. Joshua set up those stones in Gilgal to the east of Jericho, because "Gilgal" signified the doctrine of natural truth, which is serviceable for introduction into the church. From these few things it is clear what things of heaven and the church were represented by this miracle, also that the "ark," because of the law in it, signified the Lord in relation to Divine truth, therefore it is called "the ark of the Covenant of the Lord of the whole earth," as meaning conjunction with the Lord through Divine truth, since conjunction, which is signified by "covenant," is effected through Divine truth, and that is what constitutes heaven and the church, which are signified in particular by "the whole earth;" in fact, through Divine truth all things were made and created, according to the Lord's words (in John 1:1-3, 10; and in David, Ps. 33:6), "the Word" there meaning Divine truth. [15] The second miracle done by means of the ark was the overthrow of the wall of Jericho, which is thus described in Joshua:      The city of Jericho was shut up; and Jehovah said unto Joshua, I have given into thy hand Jericho and the king thereof, and the mighty in valor. Ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, once a day for six days. And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of jubilee before the ark; but the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall sound with the trumpets, and then the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city shall fall down from beneath itself; and the people shall go up. Then Joshua made them go round the city once the first day, as it had been said; after which circuit they returned into the camp, and passed the night in the camp; in like manner the day after. And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of jubilee before the ark of Jehovah went on, going, and sounded the trumpets, before whom went the men of war, and the rear marching after the ark, going and sounding the trumpets. And so they did six days; and the seventh day they compassed the city seven times; and the seventh time the people shouted. And when the people heard this, then the wall of the city fell down beneath itself, and the people went up into the city, and gave to the curse all things which were in the city, from man even to woman, and from the boy to the old man. And they burned up the city with fire, and all things that were in it; only the silver and gold, and the vessels of brass and iron they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah. And Joshua adjured them, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah that shall rise up and build this city; with his firstborn he shall lay the foundations of it, and with the youngest he shall set up its folding doors (Josh. 6:1-26). No one can know the Divine meaning contained in this miracle, unless he knows what is signified by "the city of Jericho" in the land of Canaan, which was burned up, by "its wall" which fell, by the "inhabitants" who were given to the curse, by "the gold and silver, and the vessels of brass and iron," that were put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah, also by "sounding the trumpets and shouting," and by "compassing it six days, and seven times on the seventh day." The "city of Jericho" signifies instruction in the knowledges of good and truth, by which man is introduced into the church; for Jericho was a city not far from the Jordan, and that river signified introduction into the church (as has been said above). For all places in the land of Canaan were significative of things celestial and spiritual belonging to the church, and this from the most ancient times; and as the sons of Israel were to represent the church, and among them the Word was written, in which those places were to be mentioned signifying such things as are of heaven and the church, therefore the sons of Israel were introduced into it, and their introduction was signified by "the river Jordan," and their instruction by "Jericho." And as "Jericho" signified instruction it signified also the good of life, because unless one is in the good of life he cannot be instructed in the truths of doctrine. But when the land of Canaan was held by idolatrous nations the signification of the places and cities in that land was changed into the opposite, Jericho then signifying the profanation of truth and good. From this it follows that the "city" itself signified the doctrine of falsity and evil, which perverted and profaned the truths and goods of the church, its "wall" signifying falsities of evil defending that doctrine, and the "inhabitants" those who are profane; and as all profaneness is from infernal love after the acknowledgment of truth and good, therefore the city was burned with fire, the inhabitants given to the curse, and its wall fell down, "fire" signifying infernal love, "curse" a total blotting out, and "the falling down of the wall" exposure to every evil and falsity. [16] The sounding of the trumpets by the priests signified the proclamation of Divine truth from Divine good; the shouting and acclamation of the people signified consent and confirmation; compassing the city signified a survey of falsity and evil and their dispersion by the influx of Divine truth from the Lord; this influx was signified by carrying the ark about it. The priests were seven in number, and the city was compassed seven days, and seven times on the seventh day, to signify what is holy, and the holy proclamation of Divine truth, "seven" signifying holiness, and in the contrary sense profaneness, and as there was holiness on the one part and profaneness on the other, there were seven priests with seven trumpets, and the city was compassed seven times. [17] The gold, the silver, and the vessels of brass and iron, were put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah, because these signified the knowledges of spiritual and natural truth and good, "gold and silver" the knowledges of spiritual truth and good, and "the vessels of brass and iron" knowledges of natural truth and good, which with those who profane are changed into direful falsities and evils; but as they continue to be knowledges, although applied to evils, they are serviceable to use with the good by application to what is good, and therefore these things were put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah. This also is what is meant by the "pounds" [minae] that were taken away from the evil and given to the good; likewise by the "unrighteous mammon;" also by "the gold, silver, and raiment," that the sons of Israel took away from the Egyptians and afterwards devoted to the tabernacle; and also by "the gold and silver" that David gathered from the spoils of enemies, and left to Solomon for building the temple. [18] That he who rebuilt Jericho would be cursed, and that "he would lay the foundation of it with his firstborn, and set up its folding-doors with his youngest," signified the profanation of Divine truth from its first to its last, if instruction in it should be represented elsewhere than in Jerusalem, by which the church was signified in respect to the doctrine of truth and good, and in respect to instruction from the Word. That this profanation took place under King Ahab by Hiel the Bethelite is recorded in 1 Kings 16:34; and Ahab is said to have done evil in the eyes of Jehovah above all the kings of Israel (verses 30, 33). From this miracle done by means of the ark it can be seen that the ark, because of the law in it, represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and thence signified the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. [19] The third miracle, that Dagon, the god of the Ashdodites, fell down before the ark, and the Ashdodites, Gittites, Ekronites, and Bethshemites were smitten with plagues because of it, is thus described in the first book of Samuel:      Israel went out against the Philistines to war. And Israel was beaten before the Philistines about four thousand men. Therefore the elders said, Let us take unto us out of Shiloh the ark of the Covenant of Jehovah, and let it come into the midst of us, and deliver us out of the hand of the enemy. And they brought from thence the ark of the Covenant of Jehovah of Hosts sitting above the cherubim, and with the ark the two sons of Eli. And it came to pass when the ark came to the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout; the Philistines heard, and knew that the ark of Jehovah was come to the camp, and they feared for themselves, saying, God is come to the camp; woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hands of these mighty gods? These are the gods that smote the Egyptians with every plague. But be strong and be men, O ye Philistines, that ye may not serve the Hebrews. And the Philistines fought, and Israel was beaten with a great slaughter, about thirty thousand footmen; and the ark of God was taken, and both the sons of Eli died. And the Philistines took the ark, and brought it down to Ashdod, into the house of Dagon, and they set it beside Dagon. When they of Ashdod rose in the morning, behold, Dagon lay upon his faces on the earth before the ark of Jehovah; and they put back Dagon again. But when they arose in the morning, Dagon lay upon his faces on the earth before the ark, and both the head of Dagon and the two palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold. And the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and He smote them with emerods, Ashdod and the borders thereof. Then the men of Ashdod said, The ark of Israel shall not abide with us. Therefore the lords of the Philistines said, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over unto Gath. And they carried it over unto Gath. But the hand of Jehovah was against the city, and smote the men of the city from the least to the greatest, and emerods brake out upon them. So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But the Ekronites cried out that they should be slain. And the men that died not were smitten with emerods. Therefore the lords said that they would send back the ark into its place. When the ark had remained in the field of the Philistines seven months, the Philistines called the priests and diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah; how shall we send it back to its place? And they said, Send it not empty, but send it back with a guilt-offering, then shall ye be healed, namely, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, five emerods of gold and five mice of gold, for one plague is upon you all and upon your lords; ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice, that have laid waste the land; and make a new cart, and two milch kine upon which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring back their calves from them to the house, and put the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the vessels of gold put into a coffer at the side thereof; and see if it goeth up the way of the border to Bethshemesh. And they did so. Then the kine went straightway upon the way to Bethshemesh in the one highway, and they lowed; and the lords of the Philistines went after them. And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone. Then they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine for a burnt-offering to Jehovah. And the Levites set down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer in which were the vessels of gold, upon that great stone; and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed sacrifices to Jehovah. But the Bethshemites were smitten because they saw the ark of Jehovah, about fifty thousand and seventy men. But the men of Kiriath-jearim caused the ark of Jehovah to come up, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in Gibeah, and it remained there twenty years. Then Samuel said, If with the whole heart ye will return to Jehovah, put ye away the gods of the alien and Ashtaroth, and prepare your heart towards Jehovah, and serve Him only, then will He deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines (1 Sam. 4:1-11; 5:1-12; 6:1-21; 7:1-3). What is signified by all this-that the ark was taken by the Philistines, and the Philistines were smitten with emerods on account of the ark in Ashdod, Gath, and Ekron, also that mice laid waste their land, and that so many died there and in Bethshemesh-cannot be known unless it is known what the Philistines, and in particular the Ashdodites, Gittites, Ekronites, and Bethshemites, represented and thence signified; also what is signified by "emerods" and by "mice," and by "the golden images" of these, and besides by the "new cart" and "the milch kine." Evidently these are representatives of such things as belong to the church, for otherwise why should the Philistines have been smitten with such plagues, and the ark have been so brought back? [20] The Philistines represented, and thence signified, those who make no account of the good of love and charity, and thus no account of the good of life; placing everything of religion in knowledge and cognition; therefore they were like those at the present day who make faith alone, that is, faith separated from charity, the essential of the church and the essential of salvation. This is why they were called "the uncircumcised," for to be uncircumcised signifies to be destitute of spiritual love, thus of good; and because they had reference to those within the church they were not spiritual, but merely natural, since he who makes no account of the good of charity and of life becomes merely natural, and even sensual, loving only worldly things, and is unable to understand any truths spiritually, and the truths he apprehends naturally he either falsifies or defiles. Such are they who are meant in the Word by the "Philistines." Thence it is evident why the Philistines so frequently fought with the sons of Israel, and that sometimes the Philistines conquered, and sometimes the sons of Israel. The Philistines conquered when the sons of Israel departed from the statutes and precepts in not doing them; but when the sons of Israel lived according to these they conquered. To live according to the precepts and statutes was their good of love and good of life. At this time the sons of Israel were conquered by the Philistines because they had departed from the worship of Jehovah to the worship of other gods, especially to the worship of Ashtaroth, as can be seen from what Samuel said to them (1 Sam. 7:3). For the same reason also the ark had been taken by the Philistines. [21] When it is known that the Philistines represented and thence signified those who make no account of the good of love, charity, and life, it can be known why because of the ark they were smitten with emerods and died in consequence; also why mice laid waste the land; for "emerods" signify truth defiled by such evil of life as is with those who are destitute of good; since "blood" signifies truth, and the corrupted blood from emerods truth defiled; and the hinder part, where the emerods were, signifies natural love, which with those not spiritual is the love of the world, while "mice" signify the falsities of the sensual man, which eat up and consume all things of the church, as mice lay waste fields and crops, and also the vegetables underground. Such were their plagues, because they were such, since those who are without good defile truths and also lay waste all things of the church. This was done on account of the ark, because the "ark" signified the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord, and this cannot be genuine truth but with those who are in the good of love, and thence in the good of life; and when Divine truth flows in with those who are not in good it produces effects that correspond to their falsities of doctrine and evils of life, just as in the spiritual world, when Divine truth flows into such, the defilement of truth and devastation of good are manifested in a likeness of emerods and mice. [22] Dagon the god of the Ashdodites, because of the nearness and presence of the ark, was cast down to the earth, and afterwards his head and the palms of his hands were cast upon the threshold of his temple, because "Dagon" signified their religion, which was wholly without intelligence and without power, because it was without spiritual good, "head" signifying intelligence, and "palms of the hands" power. It is similar in the spiritual world, when Divine truth inflows out of heaven with such persons, for they then appear as if they were without a head and without palms of the hands because they are without intelligence or power. [23] By the advice of their priests and diviners they made golden images of the emerods and mice, and set them at the side of the ark upon a new cart, to which they tied two milch kine on which no yoke had come, because "gold" signifies the good of love, which heals and purifies from falsities and evils, which are signified by the "emerods and mice," also because a "cart" signifies the doctrine of natural truth, and a "new cart" that doctrine untouched and unpolluted by the falsities of their evil, and the "milch kine" on which no yoke had come signify natural good not yet defiled by falsities, for to bear a yoke signifies to serve, here to serve falsities which defile good; and as such good agrees with the Divine truth, which was signified by the "ark," therefore these representatives were adapted and applied; and afterwards the Levites offered the kine as a burnt-offering, which they burned with the wood of the cart. [24] The ark with the gifts was put on a great stone, near which the kine stood still, because a "stone" signifies Divine truth in the ultimate of order. The priests and diviners of the Philistines recommended this to be done because a knowledge of correspondences and representations was a common knowledge at that time, since it was their theology, known to the priests and diviners, who were their wise men. But because men at that time had become for the most part merely natural, they regarded these things in an idolatrous way, worshiping the externals, and giving no thought to the internals that the externals represented. From this it can be seen what the particulars here cited from the book of Samuel signify in series, also that the "ark," because of the law in it, signifies Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. [25] Fourth, the two miracles wrought by means of the ark, the death of Uzzah and the blessing of Obed-edom, are thus described in the second book of Samuel:      David arose and went, and all the people that were with him, from Baal-Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called upon, the name of Jehovah of Hosts that sitteth upon the cherubim. And they caused the ark of God to be carried upon a new cart, and they brought it up out of the house of Abinadab, which was in Gibeah; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the cart. And David and all the house of Israel were playing before Jehovah, upon instruments of fir-wood of every kind, and upon harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with sistra, and with cymbals. And when they came to the threshing floor of Nachon, Uzzah put forth unto the ark and seized upon it, because the oxen stumbled; and the anger of Jehovah glowed against Uzzah, and God smote him for his error, so that he died there by the ark of God. And David was grieved at it, and David feared Jehovah that day, and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come unto me? And David would not remove the ark of Jehovah unto him in the city of David, but he turned it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. And the ark of Jehovah remained in his house three months, and Jehovah blessed Obed-edom and all his house; and it was told to King David; and David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy; and when they that bare the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling; and David danced with all his strength before Jehovah, girt with a linen ephod. And David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with a shout and with the sound of a trumpet; and they brought the ark of Jehovah into the city of David, which is Zion, and set it up in its place within the tent that David had stretched out for it (2 Sam. 6:1-17). These historical facts in the internal or spiritual sense involve many things that cannot come into view in the sense of the letter, which is the historical sense; as what is involved in the fact that the ark was brought from the house of Abinadab into the house of Obed-edom, and at length into the city of David, which is Zion; in the fact that when it was brought they played and sounded all kinds of musical instruments, and David himself danced; that the ark was brought upon a new cart, to which oxen were tied; also that Uzzah, the son of Abinadab, died, and Obed-edom with his house was blessed. All these things, although historical, have concealed in their bosom such things as pertain to heaven and the church, in like manner as the ark itself, which, on account of the law in it, represented the Lord as to the Divine truth; therefore it is called "the ark of God whose name is called upon, the name of Jehovah of hosts that sitteth upon the cherubim." That the ark was now brought out of the house of Abinadab, first into the house of Obed-edom and at length into the city of David, which is Zion, involves arcana that no one can know unless he knows what was signified by "Gibeah" and by "Baal-Judah" there, where Abinadab was, and by "Gath" where Obed-edom was, and finally by "Zion" where David was. All the regions and the cities in them in the land of Canaan were representative, as it is in the spiritual world with the regions there and their cities. In the spiritual world in every region and also in every city those who are in the good of love dwell toward the east and the west, those who are in a bright good of love toward the east, and those who are in an obscure good of love toward the west; while toward the south and the north there those dwell who are in the light of truth; those who are in a bright light of truth toward the south and those who are in an obscure light of truth toward the north. The like is true of the land of Canaan and its regions and the cities of those regions; in reference to their quarters these corresponded to the regions of the spiritual world and to the cities of those regions; but with this difference, that on earth it is impossible so to arrange men in their quarters in respect to the good of love and the light of truth, as the spirits and angels are arranged in the spiritual world; consequently in the land of Canaan and its cities the places themselves represented, and not the persons. That this was so can be seen from the partition of the land of Canaan into inheritances, which fell by lot to the tribes according to their representation of the church; also from the representation of the church itself by Jerusalem and Zion, Jerusalem representing the church in respect to the truth of doctrine and Zion the church in respect to the good of love. When, therefore, it is known what pertaining to heaven and the church is signified by "Gibeah," and by "Baal-Judah" there, where Abinadab was, and what by "Gath" where Obed-edom was, it can be known what is signified by bringing the ark from Abinadab to Obed-edom, and at length into Zion. [26] From the signification of these cities it can be seen that the transference of the ark represented the progress of the church with man, from its ultimate to its inmost, as from one heaven into another, even to the highest, which is the third heaven. "Baal-Judah," where Abinadab was, signified the ultimate of the church, which is called its natural, for this was represented by "Gibeah," where "Baal-Judah" was. But "Gath," where Obed-edom was, who was therefore called a Gittite, signified the spiritual of the church; and this signification it took on after the sons of Israel had taken from the Philistines the cities from Ekron even to Gath (1 Sam. 7:13-15); while "Zion," where David was, signified the inmost of the church, which is called its celestial. [27] From this it is evident that the transference of the ark signified the progress of the church with man from its ultimate to its inmost; and this because such progressions are effected by means of Divine truth, which was signified by the ark; for the man of the church progresses from the natural to the spiritual, and through that to the celestial, and this continually from the Lord by means of His Divine truth; the natural is the good of life, the spiritual is the good of charity toward the neighbor, and the celestial is the good of love to the Lord. As the goods of the three heavens have a like progression, so the ascent through them in their order is also represented. [28] Their playing and sounding all kinds of musical instruments, and David's dancing when the ark was brought up, represented the gladness and joy that result from the affection of truth and good from the Lord through the influx of Divine truth, which was signified by the "ark;" the instruments mentioned, on which they played in the first journey from the house of Abinadab to the house of Obed-edom, represented gladness of mind from a natural and spiritual affection of truth; and the dancing of David, also the shouting and sound of the trumpet represented joy of heart from the affection of spiritual and celestial good. Harmonies of musical sound are from the spiritual world, and signify the affections with their gladnesses and joys (as may be seen above, n. 323, 326). "Zion" signifies the third heaven, and thence the inmost of the church (see also above, n. 405). [29] "The ark" brought on a new cart to which oxen were tied represented and thence signified the doctrine of truth from the good of love, "cart" signifying the doctrine of truth, and "oxen" the good of love, both in the natural man; for Divine truth, which is signified by the "ark," rests and is founded upon the doctrine of natural truth which is from good; this is why the ark was set upon a cart before which were oxen. (That a "chariot" [or cart] signifies the doctrine of truth, see above, n. 355; that an "ox" signifies the natural good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2180, 2566.) [30] Uzzah the son of Abinadab died because he seized upon the ark with his hand, because "to touch with the hand" signifies communication, and communication with the Lord is effected through the good of love, and yet Uzzah was not anointed, as the priests and Levites were, to whom the representation of the good of love was given by anointing (that this was given by anointing, see n. 375). Moreover, the cherubim that were over the mercy-seat which was upon the ark, signified the guard that the Lord be not approached except through the good of love. That this was also done that David might not bring the ark into Zion before the progression which was being represented was finished (of which above) can be seen from this, that David grieved at the death of Uzzah, and feared to bring the ark into his city, which was Zion (verses 8-10). [31] Obed-edom was blessed, and his house, on account of the ark, because a blessing from the good things of the world signifies blessing from the good things of heaven, which proceed solely from the Lord by the reception of the Divine truth represented by the ark, and these good things those have who are in spiritual good, which Obed-edom in Gath represented, as has been said above. [32] Finally, bringing the ark into Zion and into the tent that David had stretched out for it, signified the ascent into the third heaven, and the conjunction of the Divine truth with the good of love, for "Zion" represented the inmost of the church, and thence the inmost of the heavens, which is the highest or third heaven, in which the angels are in the good of love to the Lord, and where there is a guard that the Lord be not approached except through the good of love, which guard was represented by the cherubim over the ark. [33] Bringing the ark into the inmost part of the temple built by Solomon has a like signification; this is thus described in the first book of Kings: Solomon prepared an adytum in the midst of the house, to set there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; and in the adytum he made two cherubim of wood of oil, and he set the cherubim in the midst of the inner house, so that their wings were spread forth to the wall on each side, and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house; and he overlaid the cherubim with gold. And Solomon brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion. And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests lifted up the ark, and brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the vessels of holiness that were in the tent; and Solomon and all the congregation with him before the ark. And the priests brought the ark of the covenant of Jehovah into its place, into the adytum of the house, into the holy of holies, even under the wings of the cherubim; for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof from above, and the heads of the staves were seen from the holy place, toward the faces of the adytum, but they were not seen without. And Solomon said, There have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which He made with our fathers when He brought them forth out of the land of Egypt (1 Kings 6:19, 23, 27, 28; 8:1-8, 21). As the ark in the tent of meeting represented the third heaven where the Lord is, and the tent itself without the veil the second heaven, and the court the first heaven, so was it with the temple; for the temple with its courts represented the three heavens, therefore there was nothing in the temple or outside of the temple within the courts, that did not represent something of heaven, and this for the reason that the Lord at that time was present in representatives; for the churches before the Lord's coming were representative churches, and finally such as the church was that was instituted with the sons of Israel. But when the Lord came into the world, the externals that represented were abolished, for it was the Lord Himself that the representatives of the church shadowed forth and signified; and as these were external things, and as it were veilings, within which was the Lord, so when He came these veilings were taken away, and He was manifested, with heaven and the church, in which the Lord is the all in all. The primary representatives of the Lord, and thence of heaven and the church, were the tent of meeting with the table, the lamp stand, the altar of incense, and the ark there, also the altar with the burnt offerings and sacrifices, and afterwards the temple; the temple having a similar representation as the tent of meeting, with the difference that the tent of meeting was a more holy representative of the Lord, of heaven, and of the church, than the temple. [34] From this it can be seen that the adytum in the temple, where, like as in the tent of meeting, the ark was, represented the Lord in relation to the Divine truth, and thence the third heaven, where angels are conjoined to the Lord by love to Him, and consequently have Divine truth inscribed on their hearts. But what was signified by "the cherubim" in the temple, and their "wings," and the "staves" which are also mentioned, shall be told in a few words. "The cherubim" signified a guard that the Lord be not approached except through the good of love, consequently they were made of the "wood of oil," which wood signified the good of love (see above, n. 375); "the wings of the cherubim" signify the spiritual Divine, which descends from the celestial Divine, in which is the third heaven, into the second heaven, and is there received; this is why the wings "touched one another in the midst of the house," and were thence "stretched forth to the wall on each side." But the "staves" by which the ark was carried, signified Divine power, the same as "arms." From this and what precedes the signification of "the ark of the Covenant" in the Word can be seen.  [35] By the "ark," moreover, the same as by "the continual sacrifice" in Daniel, which was to cease at the Lord's coming into the world, a representative of the church in general is meant, in Jeremiah:      I will give you shepherds according to My heart, that they may feed you with knowledge and intelligence; and it shall come to pass when ye shall be multiplied and bear fruit in the land, in those days they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah, neither shall it come up upon the heart, neither shall they make mention of it, neither shall they miss it, neither shall it be renewed anymore (Jer. 3:15, 16). This is said of the Lord's coming, and of the abolition of the representative rites of the Jewish Church at that time. That the interior things of the church that had been veiled over by external representative rites would then be manifested and there would then be interior or spiritual men, is signified by "shepherds would be given according to the heart of the Lord, and they shall feed them with knowledge and intelligence," "shepherds" meaning those who teach good and lead to it by means of truths; the multiplication of truth and fructification of good are signified by "Then it shall come to pass when ye shall be multiplied and bear fruit in the land in those days;" that there will then be conjunction with the Lord through the interiors of the Word and not through its exteriors, which merely represented and signified things interior, is signified by, "they shall say no more, The ark of the Covenant of Jehovah;" "the ark of the Covenant of Jehovah" here signifying the externals of worship that were then to be abolished, the same as "the continual sacrifice" that was to cease (see Dan. 8:13; 11:31; 12:11). That worship was to be no longer external but internal is signified by, "it shall not come up upon the heart, neither shall they make mention of it, neither shall they miss it, neither shall it be renewed anymore." From this, too, it can be seen that "the ark of the Covenant" seen by John in the temple of God, which is the vision here treated of, was an appearing of the Divine truth, by which there is a conjunction of the new heaven and the New Church with the Lord, and that this was so seen that the Word in the letter might be similar throughout, consisting of things that were externals of worship and represented internals; the like as above (Dan. 8:3, 4), where "the altar" and "incense offerings" were seen "before the throne;" for the Word in the letter consists of pure correspondences, such as existed in the representative churches, and were taken therefrom for use in the Word, and in these the interior things of heaven and the church, which are spiritual and celestial, are contained. </p>
