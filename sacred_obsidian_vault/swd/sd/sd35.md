 <p>CONCERNING PERSUASION. In order that I may know how and wherefore the Lord permits spirits to undergo sometimes such punishments and torments in the other life, I was let into a state so that a certain very friendly spirit might, as it were, be borne into the most grievous punishments, although it was others [who endured them]; and then I was held in that state [so as to see] [know] that if he did not undergo such punishments as were most grievous, he would never become good. In that state I was kept with a persuasion that it was impossible for him to have become good unless tempered. In that state I could not at all pity him, still less wish to yield him assistance; for good was then in my heart and was continually infused into my meditation [volvere]. Hence I may know how the Lord permits such even grievous punishments, because he turns everything into good, and intends nothing else but good, and what may be a means to his reformation. - 1748, September 19. </p>

 <p>THAT IN THE LEFT FOOT, UP TO THE KNEE, DWELL THOSE WHO [AS] NATURAL [SPIRITS] CORRESPOND TO CELESTIAL [SPIRITS]. In my left foot I felt a multitude of spirits: I believe I spoke a little with them, and told them that they seem to be in the foot, but that they were dispersed throughout the world [universum orbem terrarum], and yet are felt in the foot; and I was instructed that these are they who are natural good spirits, and correspond to celestial spirits, so that the celestial spirits adjoined to them could have spoken with me. - 1748, September 19. </p>

 <p>CONCERNING NUDITY OF THE HEAD. A certain one desired that his head should be laid bare [nudari]. This is usual with those from whom callosities [calli] are taken away, and [who] then become infantile. It is otherwise with some according to their interior constitution. But with him who wished it, when [his] head was laid bare, there appeared a bare, osseous [bony] head of the color of the human face; and spirits said that he was of such a nature interiorly that he could never forgive anyone who once seemed to him to do him harm, so that he retained vengeance till death; and in like manner the same [spirit] confessed that unless such excuse was made (intervened) [intervenerit] before the whole world, the honor of his reputation should be revenged; but I apperceive that not even then [would he have been appeased]. - 1748, September 19. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3204.">3204.</a></font></span>
 <p>THAT THEY HAVE READ [MY] WRITING FROM AFAR. When certain were removed, according to appearance, to a distance, yea to such a distance that they were but slightly heard, they then read [my] writing from thence by [with] their mouth [acting] in [apud] me, better than I [could]. Since they were thus able to see thence, from which it is apparent that distance is an imaginary thing. - 1748, September 19. </p>

 <p>CONCERNING SIRENS. There were many sirens with me who were afterwards represented by inverted bodies; so that as far as the head they were towards me, and the other part towards Gehenna; so they who suffer themselves to be enticed [pelliceri, I think] by them pass from their sweet [flatteries] to their posteriors, where was Gehenna. - 1748, September 19. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3206.">3206.</a></font></span>
 <p>CONCERNING GEHENNA. ((((Gehenna appears to those who rush [appellunt] thither, as a fire; and indeed that it is like a fire was granted [me] to know from the heat that flowed thence into my face. Spirits said, and lamented, that such offensive smell [foetor] exhales thence from burnt bones and hairs, as it were, so that they could not endure it. Something of it was also brought to me, but I felt little of it. The most deceitful are there, especially sirens, who by a species of piety enter the minds of others, and most deceitfully delude and seduce [mislead] [them], so that never can anyone resist unless the Lord protect him; companies [phalanges] of sirens flew out of thence, and were perceived through [per] the hairs and topmost [supremum] skin of my head, which they caused to quiver [tremiscenter movebant]. These are also such as esteem the conjugial [principle] as of no account, [being] in the greatest [summa] persuasion, that it is of no account, [and] so regard adulteries as proper. Again, there came a blast [afflabat] thence to the nostrils, like the offensive smell [foetor] of bones and hairs, together with heat. Such [spirits] greatly persecute the innocent, and entice them to lusts, harlotries, and finally to adulteries, under the pretext of propriety [honesti]. There also are those principally who were reputed in the world as leading a becoming life, [also] a few of the lower sort; and they there feel sweetness as if in their atmosphere, which is of such a nature; but afterwards it is changed into dreadful serpents, that bite and devour their breasts and genital members, as they report to me. I have heard them thence, when only a few serpents begin to arrive there [es tangere], [saying] that they care for nothing, because they prefer death to losing the pleasantness of that atmosphere: with such most disgraceful, lustful [venera] frenzy are they smitten. - 1748, September 19.)))) </p>

 <p>CONCERNING THE SIRENS OF GEHENNA. (((Certain of them were with me, and I was informed by them, that they are [not only] as it were hot, just as it seems to themselves, but are fiery, as is usual, in [their] frenzy. So also when they approach the celestial things of love, thus towards heaven, that they become cold, yea, as cold as snow and ice. They can [become] both fire and ice: thus [can undulate] from one extreme to the other, so that they are miserably tortured. - 1748, September 19.))) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3208.">3208.</a></font></span>
 <p>CONCERNING A HEAVENLY ARCANUM. It is a heavenly arcanum, that conjugial love may so enter into heaven according to appearance, as [to reach] the inmost with a perception of felicity. This according to appearance. That communication is also actually given, is because the life of the Lord inflows, through the inmost heaven, thus, in order, through consequents, into the conjugial love of those who are kept such by the Lord, amongst whom, it does not appear other than that it enters from them into heaven. - 1748, September 20. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3209.">3209.</a></font></span>
 <p>THAT THE INTELLECTUAL [PRINCIPLE] CAN APPREHEND, OR UNDERSTAND, THAT [THERE IS] AN INTERNAL [PRINCIPLE] OR [A PRINCIPLE] INTERIOR TO ITSELF, BUT CANNOT ENTER [IT]. I perceived this in spiritual idea, that the rational and intellectual [principle] can never enter those things which are interior to itself but yet can know and understand, that there are [such], also their quality. - 1748, September 20. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3210.">3210.</a></font></span>
 <p>THAT THE QUALITY OF A MAN IS SOMETIMES DISTINGUISHED FROM A SINGLE WORD. That all words are ideas, and one word signifies many things, is also [evident] by affinities: so that thus also may the quality of a spirit be detected. Sometimes, from the most general [things]: as when it was inquired concerning someone whether he was merciful: it was said that he was kairful, which signifies mercy. When [I had gone on] farther in the way, it came to my ears, [and] I heard [as] at a distance that he was merciful, further on [I heard] somewhat nearer, that he loved the sex, or women, which also the same word signifies, farther on, when nearer, he was pitch-black, from kiam, so that he was coal-black. - 1748, September 20. </p>

 <p>CONCERNING THE EXCREMENTITIOUS HELL. The excrementitious hell is under the seat, or the buttocks, where are many, to whom human excrement is given to eat. They are those men and women [qui vel quae] who in the life of the body had nothing else, as an end, but the various pleasures of the body. One was with me; she complained of her miserable fate: then there was an excrementitious smell [foetor]. Such are in privies. - 1748, September 20. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3212.">3212.</a></font></span>
 <p>CONCERNING A PALOESTRA. (((((It has been already mentioned [mention has already been made] concerning a paloestra, a little below, in front. It was again seen by me: they [do] nothing there but sport, dance, converse, and live in delights, ad Cereos and so forth. From these are [come] they who [quoe] are borne away to that excrementitious hell. - 1748, September 20.))))) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3213.">3213.</a></font></span>
 <p>CONCERNING THE RAINBOW HEAVEN. ((((It was granted to think concerning the vitreous humour of the eye, where is a pellucid substance, compounded from lesser forms, in the interior chamber of the eye: and then certain [spirits] to the right, on high, where I did not remember anyone had previously appeared, said that they saw a heaven than which was nothing fairer, to wit, a pearly, then a crystalline, then an adamantine aura: as if the universal aura consisted of such flashes of light [fulgurationibus]; then [they saw] an aura, full of the like: [this aura was] radiated in each least form, like most beautiful rainbows: then there was round about, the form of a very large rainbow, encircling [the sky] [and] most beautiful: then the same rainbow [was] as it were composed of those least [ones] or [was that] from which the leasts sprung [were originated], like most beautiful images. This is the heaven of the rainbow, or the rainbow [heaven] to which corresponds the vitreous humour of the eye. - 1748, September 20.)))) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3214.">3214.</a></font></span>
 <p>CONCERNING A DECEITFUL ASSASSIN [homicida] WHO HAS BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE. For some time, the deceitful assassin was at liberty in heaven, in the society of similar infernal [spirits], and being cast out to Gehenna, seemed to fly like a black body, or like an inanimate mass, and still, what astonished me, there exhaled thence so much subtle poison, that it excited the deceitful and more deceitful sirens, who so scattered [sprinkled] and practiced their deceits, that it cannot be described: for it would require a very long time to narrate that history. Hence was granted to learn the quality of the sirens: who also were with me afterwards. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3215.">3215.</a></font></span>
 <p>The same deceitful assassin, when it was said [loquutum est] concerning the life of spirits, that there is but one [unica] life, to wit [that] of the Lord, consequently [that] of love: and it was shown that all were merely organs of life, and the life of the Lord inflowed, and was varied according to the quality of the organs: also that love alone is life, and this was shown that man and spirit without loves and their cupidities enjoy no life, then the deceitful assassin appeared like an inanimate mass: thus did he represent himself out of deceit: and then perhaps spread [his] deceits around, like poisons; wherefore other spirits were indignant at him;  </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3216.">3216.</a></font></span>
 <p>and he was therefore cast, to a greater distance thence, deep down [profundius], on the left, and there lay as if deprived of life, so that he supposed all of life had been taken away from him: he still spoke a few words, but yet being raised up, said that he had then been, as he was in the world, or in the body. Hence it may be evident, what is the quality of a spirit, when remitted in such a state as was his when in the body. He, because of such a nature, said that he loves that life. Wherefore he was again sent thither, I believe, and such a life was left him, as was taken away, and there remains a little of life, with torment: such [a life] as I was once in: when in that state of life, he piteously begged to be liberated. I do not remember his words [ejus vocis]: but he made piteous lamentation. He was therefore presently remitted into another state of life, into which, when he returned, he again uttered his hatreds, so that he never forgave them. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3217.">3217.</a></font></span>
 <p>At length, when it was granted to speak concerning certain things written and published by me, concerning the devil [to wit], that he was created before the creation of the world, as a copula [link] between heavenly and corporeal things; which was also confirmed by this, that they could not have been written differently, inasmuch as the Christian world does not believe different; and that he was created a good angel, but afterwards fell and was cast from heaven; besides other things: then, inasmuch as these were the principles of the worshippers of nature, he snatched at these things so eagerly, that he said he had never possessed such a life: thus he [was] as it were let into [his] true life, for he was of such a character that he snatched at these things in the life of the body, and confirmed himself and persuaded himself [thereof]; and I could observe, that from him, poisons were diffused into spirits, by this, that they being as it were bound [ligati] by his efflux [effluvie] could hardly have thought otherwise. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3218.">3218.</a></font></span>
 <p>CONCERNING A TRITULATORY UNDULATION. I awoke, and above my head [appeared], as it were, a pillar [column], the size of my head, which acted like a perforating undulation; thus when it inflowed, like those who writhe themselves undulating somewhat grossly, by a sort of boring; it first, as it were, passed through the head, then, not so [plainly] to the feeling, [passed through] the body, but [plainly] through the sole of the left foot, where it bored through, thus boring like a pillar [columnatim], and this lasted quite a long time. It was inquired in mind or by speech who they were. It was said that they sought here for someone who was with me; this was also said to me; it was insinuated that these are they who in the life of the body scrutinize attentively the thoughts of others, but it is now insinuated that such are among the interior spirits who have a mind to destroy [exstinguant] the souls of others, but who make a different profession with the mouth. - 1748, September 21. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3219.">3219.</a></font></span>
 <p>CONCERNING THE ASSASSIN. The same assassin who previously became like a black mass, as it were inanimate, he was sent to Gehenna into the society of the infernals, but not into its middle, where are adulterous women, for these occupy the middle of Gehenna. It was permitted to perceive [sentire] [their] detestable lasciviousness by a certain sort of lascivious undulation. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3220.">3220.</a></font></span>
 <p>He or [that is] the assassin, inasmuch as he was not a woman, was driven to the right side of Gehenna, that he might there be submerged. I do not remember whether he was there submerged, but still to some distance thence the sun penetrated the earth, and thence towards the left where [are those] who are [deep] under the earth. It was then seen how [he flowed] into serpentine bendings around to left and right, above, and now [into] bends below. There were continually represented, as it were, serpentine bendings and various twistings; these spiral twistings [I will not attempt to describe], because some cannot be described. Hence he could also inflow, and hence speak, as I heard. He was there also reduced into such a state as he was in when he killed an infant with poison, which state was communicated to me by those who could communicate such things. It is now insinuated that it was a detestable deed, and the [a] deed of detestable [spirits], to lead anyone into such a state. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3221.">3221.</a></font></span>
 <p>The assassin is under the earth: he attempted to open a way for himself to glide out of thence: he proceeded towards Gehenna: they said if his head should emerge here, which continually appeared like a serpent, that then he would suffer irremediable harm [tum immedicabile esset]; but he proceeded again towards the left and spread out, as it were, a cavernous plane towards the right of considerable width, which nevertheless did not afterwards appear. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3222.">3222.</a></font></span>
 <p>At length the same assassin, after such twistings, whirled around, as it were, such continuous spiral twistings [circumgyrabat] continually, so that he made circumgyrations of spheres; but afterwards being wrapped around the body, face [and] feet, as it were, [with] a cloth, so that he said he was suffocated, he then being thus wrapped, emerged from that earth, near Gehenna, in front or somewhere else, I do not well remember. He was thus wrapped up and stood a little before Gehenna. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3223.">3223.</a></font></span>
 <p>While he thus stood, suddenly there flew from him a little spirit, like an infant, with a similar human body, which afterwards came towards the upper [regions] over my head, and spoke with me, and I did not then perceive aught but evil [therein]. I then spoke, concerning the same, with spirits, [asking] who he was, and where [was] the body left which appeared like a cast-off garment: whether in this remained any life, inasmuch as interiors were thus separated. It was said that that little one which [came] from him was his interior spirit with whom so much of the natural [principle] followed as could have been serviceable or obedient. Wherefore it was asked [looquatum] whether or no all the evil can thus exist and so enter heaven; but it was said that this was contrary to order, or the laws of order, for a man to lose exteriors: also that such appear indeed [as] angels of the interior heaven,  </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3224.">3224.</a></font></span>
 <p>but that they still retain such naturals as obey and are serviceable: thus regard the world of spirits as a body, just as the world of spirits considers the human body as their own. Thus [it is in] order, [so it is] now insinuated, that those things which appear left [behind], like clothing, be similarly renewed amongst [with] those who become interior angels, like as was once upon a time represented to me that garments [vestes] [are] left [relictoe] in the left eye [and are] there hidden; but that thence are called forth in order those things which are not obedient or serviceable, and are adjoined to the naturals from the heaven so that they may also be vastated as to these of the angels; hence [arises] fermentation and dismissal from the heaven so that they may also be vastated as to these things. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3225.">3225.</a></font></span>
 <p>Such things as are represented by garments or clothing are only representations of societies which remain in lowest and inferior things, and that which was represented by the little one, which [flew forth] thence, with his interiors, is the societies which are interior. Thus such things as were previously represented arise from changes of state of societies, and are thus presented before the eyes of the world of spirits. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3226.">3226.</a></font></span>
 <p>We then spoke concerning the left-off clothing, from which he seemed to speak, whether he could have lived apart from interiors, because it was, as it were, heard that he remains [therein], but inasmuch as this cannot be given that anyone may live only in the body or lowest nature, apart from the interior, it was said that it is the lowest society which still has clothing as a subject, and that then another succeeds in his place, who appears to them as if inwardly in the garment, for the subject appears as if in the center. Nevertheless, he who went forth from thence was not of such a character, but was, as I perceived, an upright [person]. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3227.">3227.</a></font></span>
 <p>It was also shown how the minds of others are held bound [chained] by the like; for when he is such in his persuasion as to regard nothing as evil, like they who [are] in Gehenna, then perishes all perception of those things which are opposed to the good and true, which are, as it were, destroyed [extincta], so that then the spirit also thinks himself to be of such a nature. The persuasion of one can thus bind another, and induce, as it were, that he should be similar. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3228.">3228.</a></font></span>
 <p>Afterwards that assassin, when he again became nearly such as he was before, and the little interior [spirit] joined to him, inasmuch as he was courageous [high-minded] in the life of the body, and had aspired to dignities perhaps the highest; he was told that he knew their punishment according to the laws of earth; that they who perpetrate such things were buried within such [a spot in a profane place]; and it was said to him if anyone had committed such [a crime], and he should judge him, what sort of judgment would he pass; he said that he would be one of the sternest [maxime serios] judges, and would so condemn him: wherefore he condemned himself. - 1748, September 21. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3229.">3229.</a></font></span>
 <p>CONCERNING THE RAINBOW. ((((There were represented to me species of rainbows which were often seen previously before the eyes, and now whilst in the midst of such a scene, [I saw] a sort of green, as it were, grassy [spot], and after that, as it were, an earth [tellurem]. [There was] a sun not visible but illuminating it, and at the same time diffused a light round about, so bright and beautiful, that it cannot be described. No comparison exists between that light, and our light of day or noon, also in that lucid circumference [were seen] most beautiful variations of color: in a lucid pearly plane [ground]: indefinite are the variations of this sort. - 1748, September 21.)))) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3230.">3230.</a></font></span>
 <p>THAT THE THOUGHTS MAY BE BROUGHT FORTH IN THE OTHER LIFE. I am informed from experience, that whatever good [anyone] has thought and spoken in the life of the body, that this can be brought forth: he is remitted into that state: then each and all things [pertaining] to him are opened, and then at the same time angels know whatever they had thought and spoken. Wherefore the memory of particulars is never obliterated in the other life: but what he has thought and spoken is not revealed unless the Lord permits and allows. - 1748, September 21. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3231.">3231.</a></font></span>
 <p>THAT THE LORD DOES GOOD TO [HIS] ENEMIES. I was overcome with sleep [somno eram soportus] in the afternoon, and with quite a sound [sleep]. When I awoke there were many around me asleep, [in somno] even spirits who wished to lay snares for me: these also overcome [gravita] with sleep were fast asleep [dormiebant]: so with all who came up with the purpose to injure me. When they awoke, they said that they have been asleep, and fled away one after another: one said that he had not wished to sleep; it was perceived that he wished to injure [me]. Hence I spoke with spirits [saying] that the Lord alone watches over all, even [his] enemies, and does them good. - 1748, September 21. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3232.">3232.</a></font></span>
 <p>Hence it was granted me to know that evil spirits are compelled to sleep with [apud] man, and so cause that man may sleep: yea, soundly [bene] although surrounded with evil spirits. Otherwise, should they also lay snares for man, as they desire [to do] to [for] everyone, they would then perceive, if not asleep, that they were spirits separated from man. That this may not happen, spirits ought to sleep. This was now disclosed to me. - 1748, September 21. When they do not know other than that they are man, they then do not injure: this would be [to injure] themselves; but when man sleeps, and they are awake, they then can know it. - 1748, September 21. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3233.">3233.</a></font></span>
 <p>CONCERNING THE SPIRITS OF MERCURY. (I have again, by means of [through] intermediate spirits, heard the spirits of Mercury, who spoke in volume [voluminatim] so rapidly, that scarce could [an intermediate] spirit have uttered it. There was, as it were, a volume of them speaking together. But it was not their speech, [but] only the thought of the interior sense or memory that flowed into the speech of the intermediate spirit, [and was so rapid]. It was similar with the perception of those things, which were thought after that. So promptly did they perceive them, that at once, and in a moment, they judged [decided] as to the quality, saying, "This is so; this is not so; this is the quality." So that their decision [judicium] was almost instantaneous; and, moreover, they were similar to what they were before. This is remarkable, that their thought was brought to me in such volumes, that the spirits quickly undulated above me like an atmosphere; also that the cogitative undulation did not flow [labereter] towards the left eye, although they were some distance to the right. - 1748, September 21.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3234.">3234.</a></font></span>
 <p>(From these things it may be concluded, that whatever spirits hear they retain much more readily than men, although they do not know they retain these things; for thus is formed the interior memory. Man being ignorant [thereof], and the purer the angels, the more readily and fully they retain, so that no idea may perish. It is evident from those who so readily decide concerning each and all things, this cannot happen unless they retain. - 1748, September 21. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3235.">3235.</a></font></span>
 <p>(When it was represented to them [that] perception is of the Lord, yea, by means of representations, then, immediately in an instant, as it were, they said, that it is not so; that he does not know that this is so: so that they were then distinctly aware what perception is, which our spirits do not know or understand, even in the grossest manner.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3236.">3236.</a></font></span>
 <p>(Still, however, spirits of this world [telluris] spoke with these, by angelic ideas, and said, much more readily than those [spirits of Mercury] what they did not know and what they knew; and very many things more rapidly than those [spirits of Mercury], so that I perceived those [spirits of Mercury] acknowledge, like as they also confessed, that therefore they were nothing as compared [with our spirits]; that [our spirits] knew things which they did not know; also, that [our spirits] knew at once what they knew: this so suddenly, by means of interior ideas, that they could not but have been amazed, as they now allege. Afterwards, they spoke in indignation; thus grosser spirits overcame, even the evil [ones].) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3237.">3237.</a></font></span>
 <p>(((They did not admit that they were represented as men, but as crystalline globules.))) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3238.">3238.</a></font></span>
 <p>(For some time, there was again conversation between them and the angels of the Lord, and it was said to them, in rapid moments, through ideas not understood by me, that they know and do not know what is [evil]; also, that there are indefinite things which they do not know, indefinites in every idea, and that they cannot know even generals to eternity. This also was shown them, even to acknowledgement [so as to be recognized]; furthermore, the angels spoke with them such things as they did [could] not perceive, save by changes of state; which things, they said they do not understand, but perceive by means of changes of state. It was then said to them that every change [the least], now [occurring], contains indefinites. At length, when they perceived this, they humbled themselves; their humiliation was represented to me by the letting down of their volume more and more, towards deeper [regions]; and that still the elevation could not be concealed, on account of the volume being hollowed, and elevated at the sides; thus also by means of a sort of reciprocal slight motion [motitationem]. It was also told them what it signifies, or what they think in their humiliation; thus they are halved; a half part of the volume [is] above my head; they are removed [relegabantur] towards their planet, upwards at the back. The other half remaining in humiliation; which was a proof [sign] that they who are such as could not humble themselves, were sent back home, that they might lean there). </p>

 <p>([Their] internal sense is such, that it delights only in the knowledges of things, and nothing beyond. Wherefore, also since there are interiors, which pertain to uses, they do not care [so much] for these; consequently not for ends, thus for the only end: hence also it comes that they are proud, and because proud [in fastu], therefore, the life of ends and uses cannot inflow into them, before that pride is taken away from them. This pride it is which has done most of those things which I have described; for they despised others in comparison with themselves. They who are in a state of humiliation have now acknowledged, with some weeping, that the Lord alone is their Lord; they then acknowledged that what they know scientifically, it is also given them to know intellectually: for they do not worship another [Lord]; but inasmuch as they esteem themselves above others, they do not care.) </p>

 <p>(Those spirits [were] around me, together with the spirits of our world [telluris], when they came into a grosser sphere to me; and at the same time they wondered that those things which I wrote, were so gross, inasmuch as no idea, as it were, was therein. But it was granted to reply, that the men of this world are of such a character, that they did not understand the tenth part, and a much less part of those things which were written; so that it can scarcely be written so grossly, as that [men can perceive] anything as they perceived [it]. I added, that they do not even know that an internal sense is given, but (suppose that it is the body which feels; therefore do not believe in a life after death, nor that the spirit exists [dari.] They then asked if such can become angels: it was said that they who spoke with them must have been such in the life of the body and yet are now so intelligent; and in the life of the body they know not the least of those things which they had said [to them] whereat they marveled. - 1748, September 21.) </p>

 <p>CONCERNING THE SPIRITS, SO CALLED, OF THE MOON. (Spirits came above my head: when they merely spoke they thundered [tonabant]: something of voice or speech was let down from the midst, as if something opened itself, as happens when lightnings are let out of the clouds. There appeared, as it were, a great multitude of spirits above me. I thought they belonged to some world [and were] not yet known; but the more simple and gross spirits of our world, continually ridiculed them; whereat I marveled; because they intercepted thoughts, no matter from whence [they were] and what spirits they might be. These spirits were then let down into the depths [in profundum], that they might not hinder: yet others could not restrain themselves from laughing at them, in nearly the same manner. </p>

 <p>Then were some seen by me obscurely, as it were infants; and one carried a certain one, who appeared to me distinctly so far as the face, with [mossa pa hufwudet]: he was at first supposed from the face [to be] an infant, but was examined and considered [to be] a manniken [homuncio] or a little man [dwarf]; because his face [was] not infantile, being somewhat long, but of small breadth, like that of at ill-proportioned man [invenusti] he was carried into my sight by another as small a [man] whom I did not see. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3242_1/2.">3242_1/2.</a></font></span>
 <p>He who was thus carried and seen, came to me, below the arm, on the left side, and spoke with me, and said that he was such a one, so small, and not knowing whence [he came]; but that still when he spoke his voice - then sounded just like the voice of those who [are] above the head: he also showed me how he spoke, that it was, as if from the abdomen, and that he thus belched out [egurgitaret] much speech with much sound, and there was a sort of egurgitation of sound, with the voice, which cannot so [easily] be described; and in order that he might show what belongs to such voice or sound of voice, that he might as it were thunder, like a great multitude of spirits, he also withdrew a little, still [was] near me, and spoke similarly: then I heard as it were the thunder of heaven along with his voice: and he again returned, and showed the nature of [his] voice, that it was from the abdomen, and [was] an eructation. Thus it was also perceived that they were swollen [inflated] [tumidi] and supposed themselves to be great, although they were so little. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3243.">3243.</a></font></span>
 <p>Also previously, when it was said by a certain one near heaven, concerning the former [ones, who thundered], that they were not so numerous, he recounted them, and at length [found] that they had only been about 20 or 23 [in number], when so great a multitude was heard. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3244.">3244.</a></font></span>
 <p>I spoke concerning what earth they were from, and it was granted me to perceive to some extent [after a manner] that they were from the Moon. It came into my thought [cogiatatem] that they [were] not similar to others because they have not such an atmosphere; and I am ignorant what atmosphere they have around them; but still that the human race was there, because there is nothing without an end: thus [so] nothing without the human race, to be a [the] bond between terrestrial and natural things, and celestial things: for otherwise, never can an earth, whether planet, or moon, or satellite, exist [duri]. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3245.">3245.</a></font></span>
 <p>Hence, I could now perceive, that it was such as the human race, but I did not know what province in the body they represented [had reference to]. Wherefore spirits of that earth, either these or others, came within me, and it hence was granted to perceive, that they had reference to the scutiform or xiphoid cartilage wherein the ribs are terminated in front, and which is the fulcrum of the muscles of the diaphragm, on the anterior side, and thus of the muscles of the abdomen also. It may be seen whether or no the linea alba passes to that cartilage, and hence [if this cartilage] is continued downward, so as to be the common fulcrum with the linea alba of the muscles of the abdomen. - 1748, September 22). </p>

 <p>CONCERNING A BEAUTIFUL BIRD. (There was beheld a sort of flamy principle, purple, variously red, with white. I saw this before my face, at a distance, and next [was seen] a band, to which this beautiful flamy [thing] adhered, first, to the back part of the band, then in the palm, by which be had held this flamy [something]. This lasted a short time. I supposed that it was a sort of flamy [principle] seen in their earth, by the spirits, of whom [I have] now [been writing]. The flamy principle licked his hand round about, and then was compressed into the hollow of the hand. [vala]. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3247.">3247.</a></font></span>
 <p>Shortly it was removed to a distance, where it was bright, but straitened - what was there I could not see. The hand receded thither also; then this flamy [principle] was changed by degrees into a beautiful bird of similar color, and the bird was also changed, as to colors even into a pearly species. It was then like a pearl [lapis margaritica]; also expanded its wings and [acted] like a living bird; and like a living bird flew thence to a little distance, in front, and returned: it also appeared once as a more obscure bird; [bird of a more obscure color], nearly like [steglisa]; but without colors, again like a beautiful bird, [and] so was raised up out of sight). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3248.">3248.</a></font></span>
 <p>I reasoned variously concerning the bird, [as to] what it signifies: but my reasoning ended in this, that it is not yet discovered what it signifies, only [that it signifies] the inhabitants of Mars, because I hear and perceive them, to deny it: still such representation cannot exist, apart from the society of angels, which it represents: for it is plain, that bird signifies thought. - 1748, September 22. </p>

 <p>CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE BIRD AND PERSUASION. (Afterwards, there was a certain one, who from below either through my feet, or through the region of the loins, I do not know [which], ascended inwardly in the body as high as the breast, and filled the body. At first he was of such a nature, as to induce the persuasion that he would carry away what was dearest to me, by what he caused me to think. Next, however, when he perceived that he could not do this, he persuaded [me] [introduced the persuasion] that he was the Lord, with persuasion [that it was so], because such is the case, when spirits do not speak from themselves but from the Lord. But still I did not believe that [he was] the Lord. He, while of such a nature, carried away the beautiful bird, which was then flying around me; so that he took away that which was dearest; for many then desired [it]; but he presently let the bird go free, from his hand). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3250.">3250.</a></font></span>
 <p>(Concerning which spirits it was afterwards said, that they are such as do not know other than that they are the same, and so can be embued with persuasion, together with affection; but what he signifies I do not yet know, only it is insinuated, that if the inhabitants of Mars did not remain in their state, which amongst us is called the state of integrity, that others would succeed from a new earth, who would be similar; for when one [race] perishes, another succeeds; for there can be nothing lacking, so the Lord provides. - 1748, September 22). </p>
