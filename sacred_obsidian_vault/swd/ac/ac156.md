 <p>At the end of the following chapter some account shall be given of the spirits and inhabitants of the planet Jupiter. </p>

 <p>Exodus 11       THE DOCTRINE OF CHARITY All things in the universe bear relation to Good and Truth. That which does not bear relation to good and truth is not in Divine order; and that which does not bear relation to both together, produces nothing. Good is that which produces, and truth is that by which it produces. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7753.">7753.</a></font></span>
 <p>These facts may illustrate how the case is with spiritual good and truth, which are called charity and faith; namely, that all things which belong to the church bear relation to these, and those which do not bear relation to them have nothing of the church in them; and also that which does not contain both within it produces no fruit, that is, no good of charity or of faith. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7754.">7754.</a></font></span>
 <p>For in order that anything may be produced, there must be two forces, one which is called active, the other which is called passive; the one without the other brings forth nothing. Such forces, or lives, are charity and faith in the man of the church. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7755.">7755.</a></font></span>
 <p>The first of the church is good, the second is truth; or the first of the church is charity, and the second is faith. For the truth of the doctrine of faith is for the sake of the good of life. That which is the end for the sake of which something else exists, this is the first. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7756.">7756.</a></font></span>
 <p>With the conjunction of the good which is of charity, and the truth which is of faith, in man, the case is this. The good which is of charity enters through the soul into man, but the truth which is of faith enters through the hearing; the former flows in immediately from the Lord, but the latter mediately through the Word. Hence the way by which the good of charity enters is called the internal way; and the way by which the truth of faith enters is called the external way. That which enters by the internal way is not perceived, because it is not plainly subject to sensation; whereas that which enters by the external way is perceived, because it is plainly subject to sensation. For this reason everything of the church is attributed to faith. It is otherwise with those who have been regenerated; with such the good that is of charity is plainly perceived. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7757.">7757.</a></font></span>
 <p>The conjunction of the good of charity with the truth of faith is effected in the interiors of man. The good itself which flows in from the Lord adopts truth there, and appropriates it to itself, and thereby causes the good with the man to be good, and the truth to be truth; or the charity to be charity, and the faith to be faith. Without this conjunction charity is not charity, but only natural goodness; neither is faith faith, but only the memory-knowledge of such things as are of faith, and in some cases a persuasion that a thing is so for the sake of earning gain or honor. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7758.">7758.</a></font></span>
 <p>When truth has been conjoined with good it is no longer called truth, but good; and so when faith has been conjoined with charity it is no longer called faith, but charity; the reason is that the man then wills and does the truth, and that which he wills and does is called good. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7759.">7759.</a></font></span>
 <p>With the conjunction of the good of charity with the truth of faith, the case, further, is this. This good obtains its quality from truth, and truth its essence from good. From this it follows that the quality of good is according to the truths with which it is conjoined; and therefore good becomes genuine if the truths with which it is conjoined are genuine. Genuine truths of faith are possible within the church, but not out of it, for within the church is the Word. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7760.">7760.</a></font></span>
 <p>Moreover, the good of charity receives its quality also from the abundance of the truths of faith; likewise from the connection of one truth with another; thus is formed spiritual good with man. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7761.">7761.</a></font></span>
 <p>A clear distinction must be made between spiritual good and natural good. As before said, spiritual good has its quality from the truths of faith, their abundance, and their connection; but natural good is born with the man, and also arises by accident, as by misfortunes, diseases, and the like. Natural good saves no one, but spiritual good saves all. The reason is that the good which is formed through the truths of faith is a plane into which heaven can flow, that is, the Lord through heaven, and lead man, and withhold him from evil, and afterward uplift him into heaven; but not so natural good; and therefore they who are in natural good can be as easily carried away by falsity as by truth, provided the falsity appears in the form of truth; and they can be as easily led by evil as by good, provided the evil is presented as good. They are like feathers in the wind. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7762.">7762.</a></font></span>
 <p>The confidence of trust which is said to be of faith and is called faith, is not spiritual confidence or trust, but natural. Spiritual confidence or trust has its essence and life from the good of love; but not from the truth of faith separate. The confidence of faith separate is dead; and therefore there cannot be true confidence with those who have led an evil life. Moreover, that confidence which depends on salvation through the Lord's merit, irrespective of what the life has been, is likewise not from truth.            EXODUS 11      1. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterward he will let you go from hence; when he lets everything go, driving he shall drive you out from hence.      2. Say now in the ears of the people, and let them ask a man from his companion, and a woman from her companion, vessels of silver and vessels of gold.      3. And Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the eyes of the people.      4. And Moses said, Thus said Jehovah, About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt.      5. And every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the millstones; and every firstborn of beast.      6. And there shall be a great cry in the whole land of Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it anymore.      7. And to all the sons of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, from man and even to beast; that ye may know that Jehovah doth separate between the Egyptians and Israel.      8. And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Get thee out, thou, and all the people that is at thy feet; and thereafter I will go out. And he went out from before Pharaoh in the wrath of anger.      9. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hear you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.      10. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and Jehovah made firm the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land. </p>

 <p>THE CONTENTS.      The subject treated of in this chapter in the internal sense is the damnation of faith separate from charity, which is signified by the firstborn of Egypt that were given up to death at midnight; and also the memory-knowledges of truth and good that were to be transferred to those who are of the spiritual church, which knowledges are signified by the vessels of silver and of gold that the sons of Israel were to ask from the Egyptians. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7764.">7764.</a></font></span>
 <p>THE INTERNAL SENSE.      Verses 1-3. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterward he will let you go from hence; when he lets everything go, driving he shall drive you out from hence. Say now in the ears of the people, and let them ask a man from his companion, and a woman from her companion, vessels of silver and vessels of gold. And Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the eyes of the people. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies instruction; "Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt," signifies the end of vastation, which is damnation; "afterward he will let you go from hence," signifies that then they will be left; "when he lets everything go, driving he shall drive you out from hence," signifies that they will leave them completely, and will hold them in aversion, and shun their presence; "say now in the ears of the people," signifies instruction and obedience; "and let them ask a man from his companion, and a woman from her companion, vessels of silver and vessels of gold," signifies that the memory-knowledges of truth and good taken away from the evil who have been of the church, will be bestowed upon the good who are of it; "and Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians," signifies the fear of those who are in evils on account of those who are of the spiritual church, by reason of the plagues; "moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt," signifies respect now for truth Divine; "in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the eyes of the people," signifies with those who were in subordination there. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7765.">7765.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Jehovah said unto Moses. This signifies instruction (see n. 7186, 7267, 7304, 7380). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7766.">7766.</a></font></span>
 <p>Yet one plague more will I bring upon, Pharaoh, and upon Egypt. That this signifies the end of vastation, which is damnation, is evident from the signification of "yet one plague more," as being the last of vastation. That by the plagues brought upon Egypt were signified successive states of vastation, is evident from the explication of what goes before; that the last is damnation, namely, of faith separate from charity, will be seen from what follows; for by the firstborn given up to death in Egypt is signified the damnation of this faith; by "death," the damnation itself; and by "the firstborn," faith. Faith is said to be damned when the things of faith are applied to support falsities and evils; and when they support these, they pass over to their side, and become a means of confirming them. This is the case with those who both in doctrine and in life separate faith from charity; but with these there is no faith; there is only the memory-knowledge of such things as are of faith, which knowledge is by them called faith. This is meant by faith damned. Moreover, the subjects themselves in whom the things of faith have been adjoined to falsities and evils, after vastations are in damnation. The damnation is made sensible by the putrid and offensive stench which exhales from them, more than from those who have not been possessed of the things of faith. This is the case in particular as in general; in general, if any evil spirit approaches a heavenly society where there is charity, the stench from him is plainly perceived; in like manner in particular where there had been such things as are of heaven, that is, such as are of faith, and in the same subject also such things as are of hell. From all this it is now evident that by "yet one plague more which shall be brought upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt" is signified the last of vastation, which is damnation; for by Pharaoh are represented those who have infested, and who are here being damned; and by "Egypt" is signified the natural mind (n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301, 6147, 6252). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7767.">7767.</a></font></span>
 <p>Afterward he will let you go from hence. That this signifies that then they will be left, is evident from the signification of "to let go," as being to leave (as frequently above). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7768.">7768.</a></font></span>
 <p>When he lets everything go, driving he shall drive you out from hence. That this signifies that they will leave them completely, and will hold them in aversion and shun their presence, is evident from the signification of "to let everything go," as being to leave completely; and from the signification of "driving he shall drive you out," as being to hold in aversion and shun those who are of the spiritual church whom they had infested; for he who holds in aversion the presence of anyone, also shuns his presence, and likewise drives him away from him. That they now hold in aversion and shun those who are of the spiritual church, is because the good and the truth which flow in, now torment them. The case herein is like that of painful ulcers which do not endure even the touch of warm water or a breath of air; or like that of an injured eye which cannot bear even the mild rays of the sun. The natural mind of such spirits is now such a sore; for after they have been vastated, that is, after the things that had been of faith have been rejected, they suffer at the least breath of good and truth, whence comes aversion. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7769.">7769.</a></font></span>
 <p>Say now in the ears of the people. That this signifies instruction and obedience, is evident from the signification of "saying," as here being instruction, for Jehovah now says what the sons of Israel were to do when they departed from Egypt. Obedience is signified by "saying in the ears," for the ears correspond to obedience, and consequently signify it (n. 2542, 3869, 4551, 4652-4660). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7770.">7770.</a></font></span>
 <p>And let them ask a man from his companion, and a woman from her companion, vessels of silver and vessels of gold. That this signifies that the memory-knowledges of truth and good, taken away from the evil who have been of the church, will be bestowed upon the good who are of it, is evident from the signification of "vessels of silver and vessels of gold," as being memory-knowledges of truth and good. (That "silver" denotes truth, and "gold" good, see n. 1551, 1552, 2954, 5658, 6112; and that "vessels" denote memory-knowledges, n. 3068, 3079.) Memory-knowledges are called vessels of truth and good, because they contain them. It is believed that the memory-knowledges of truth and good are the very truths and goods of faith; but they are not. It is the affections of truth and good that make faith, and these flow into memory-knowledges, as into their vessels. That to ask these things of the Egyptians denotes to take them away and adjudge them to themselves, is plain; hence in a previous chapter (3) it is said that they should "spoil the Egyptians" (verse 22); and in the chapter which follows (12), that they "spoiled them." Its being said that "a man should ask of his companion and a woman of her companion," is because "man" relates to truth, and "woman" to good, as they also signify them. [2] How the case herein is, see the explication at Exodus 3:22, n. 6914-6917, from which it can be seen that the very memory-knowledges of truth and good which have been possessed by those of the church who have known the arcana of faith and yet have lived a life of evil, are transferred to those who are of the spiritual church. (How this transfer is effected, see n. 6914.) These things are signified by the Lord's words in Matthew:      The Lord said unto him who went away and hid his talent in the earth, Take ye the talent from him, and give it to him that hath the ten talents. For unto everyone that hath shall be given, that he may have abundance; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away; and cast ye the useless servant into the outer darkness (Matt. 25:25, 28-30; and Luke 19:24-26).      Whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath (Matt. 13:12; and Mark 4:24-25). [3] The reason is that with the evil the knowledges of good and truth are applied to evil uses, and with the good the knowledges of good and truth are applied to good uses; the knowledges are the same, but the application to uses effects their quality with each person. The case herein is like that of worldly riches, which with one person are disposed for good uses, with another for evil uses; consequently riches are such with each person as are the uses unto which they are disposed. From this also it is evident that the same knowledges, like the same riches, which the evil had possessed, can be with the good and serve for good uses.  From all this it can now be seen what is represented by the command that the sons of Israel should ask from the Egyptians vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and should thus deprive and despoil them; such seizure or despoiling would never have been commanded by Jehovah unless it had represented such things in the spiritual world. [4] Similar to this is what is written in Isaiah:      At last the merchandise of Tyre, and her meretricious hire, shall be holiness to Jehovah; and it shall not be stored up nor kept back; but her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before Jehovah to eat, to sate themselves, and for the ancient one in covering himself (Isa. 23:18); speaking of Tyre, by which are signified the knowledges of good and truth (n. 1201); "merchandise" and "meretricious hire" denote knowledges applied to evil uses; that these should be given to the good who will apply them to good uses, is signified by "her merchandise being for them that dwell before Jehovah to eat to sate themselves, and for the ancient one in covering himself." [5] Also in Micah:      Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; that thou mayest break in pieces many peoples; and I have devoted their gain to Jehovah, and their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth (Micah 4:13); "to break in pieces many peoples" denotes to devastate them; the "gain which is devoted to Jehovah and to the Lord of the whole earth" denotes the knowledges of truth and good. That David sanctified to Jehovah the silver and the gold that he had taken from the nations which he had subdued, from the Syrians, from Moab, from the sons of Ammon, from the Philistines, from Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer (2 Sam. 8:11-12); and that Solomon put the sanctified things of his father among the treasures of the house of Jehovah (1 Kings 7:51) involve the like. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7771.">7771.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. That this signifies the fear of those who are in evils on account of those who are of the spiritual church by reason of the plagues, is evident from what was unfolded above (n. 6914), where are like words. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7772.">7772.</a></font></span>
 <p>Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt. That this signifies respect now for truth Divine, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being truth Divine (of which frequently above); from the signification of "very great," as being respect, here respect from fear, for the evil who are in hell have no other respect for the Divine than that of fear (that "very great" denotes respect, is manifest, for it is said "in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the eyes of the people"); and from the signification of "the land of Egypt," as being the natural mind (see n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301, 6147, 6252). From this it is evident that by "the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt," is signified respect for truth Divine in the mind, namely, in that of the infesters. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7773.">7773.</a></font></span>
 <p>In the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the eyes of the people. That this signifies, with those who were in subordination there, is evident from the signification of "servants" and of "people," as being those who are subordinate; for by Pharaoh are represented the chief ones who infested, under whom the rest were subordinate. That the subordinate are signified is because among the evil as well as among the good, that is, in hell as in heaven, there is a form of government, that is, there is rule, and there is subordination, without which society would have no coherence. But the subordinations in heaven are wholly different from the subordinations in hell. In heaven all are like equals, for one loves another as brother loves brother; nevertheless one sets another before himself in proportion as he excels in intelligence and wisdom. The very love of good and truth causes everyone, as it were of himself, to subordinate himself to those who are superior to him in the wisdom of good and the intelligence of truth. But the subordinations in hell are those of despotic authority, and consequently of severity; for he who commands rages fiercely against those who do not favor all his commands; for everyone regards another as his enemy, although outwardly as a friend, for the sake of banding together against the violence of others. This banding together is like that of robbers. They who are subordinate continually aspire to rule, and also frequently break forth in revolt, and then the conditions there are lamentable, for then there are severities and cruelties and this takes place by alternations. From all this it can be seen how the case is with subordinations in the other life.  </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7774.">7774.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verses 4-8. And Moses said, Thus said Jehovah, About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt. And every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the millstones; and every firstborn of beast. And there shall be a great cry in the whole land of Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it anymore. And to all the sons of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, from man and even to beast; that ye may know that Jehovah doth separate between the Egyptians and Israel. And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that is at thy feet; and thereafter I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in the wrath of anger. "And Moses said, Thus said Jehovah," signifies instruction; "About midnight," signifies when the devastation is total; "I will go out into the midst of Egypt," signifies the presence of the Divine then everywhere; "and every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die," signifies the damnation then of faith separate from charity; "from the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon his throne," signifies the falsified truths of faith which are in the first place; "even to the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the millstones," signifies the falsified truths of faith which are in the last place; "and every first-born of beast" signifies the adulterated goods of faith; "and there shall be a great cry in the whole land of Egypt," signifies interior lamentation; "such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it anymore" signifies that the state was such that there could not be any like it; "and to all the sons of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue," signifies that among those who were of the spiritual church there should not be the least of damnation and lamentation; "from man and even to beast," signifies neither as to truth nor as to good; "that ye may know that Jehovah doth separate between the Egyptians and Israel," signifies that it may be known what is the nature of the difference between those who are in evil and those who are in good; "and all these thy servants shall come down unto me," signifies those who are subordinate; "and bow down themselves to me," signifies respect from fear on account of truth Divine; "saying, Get thee out, and all the people that is at thy feet," signifies supplication that they may depart from those who are in truth from the Divine, from the highest to the lowest; "and thereafter I will go out," signifies that truth Divine will depart; "and he went out from before Pharaoh in the wrath of anger," signifies the rending asunder of the presence of truth Divine from those who are about to be damned. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7775.">7775.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Moses said, Thus said Jehovah. This signifies instruction (as above, n. 7765). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7776.">7776.</a></font></span>
 <p>About midnight. That this signifies when the devastation is total; is evident from the signification of "midnight," as being when the thick darkness is most dense, that is, when there is mere falsity; for "night" signifies a state of falsity (n. 2353, 6000), and the middle of it denotes the highest; thus "midnight" denotes total devastation. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7777.">7777.</a></font></span>
 <p>I will go out into the midst of Egypt. That this signifies the presence of the Divine then everywhere, is evident from the signification of "going out through the midst," when said of Jehovah, as being the presence of the Divine. When "the midst" is predicated of land it signifies everywhere; for "to go out through the midst of Egypt" denotes into every part. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7778.">7778.</a></font></span>
 <p>And every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die. That this signifies the damnation of faith separate from charity, is evident from the signification of "dying," as being damnation (see n. 5407, 6119); and from the signification of "firstborn," as being the faith of the church through which is charity (n. 352, 2435, 6344, 7035); but the "firstborn in the land of Egypt" denotes faith without charity (of which above, n. 7766). [2] As regards faith without charity, it is to be said further that faith without charity is not faith, but only the memory-knowledge of such things as are of faith; for the truths of faith look to charity as their ultimate end, and afterward proceed from charity as their first end. From this it is manifest that those things which are of faith have no existence with those who are not in charity, and yet it is known that the memory-knowledge of the truths of faith does exist with them. This memory-knowledge is that which they call faith. And when the memory-knowledges of the truth and good of faith are applied by them to confirm falsities and evils, then the truths and goods of faith no longer exist with them, because the truths and goods give assent to the falsities and evils which they serve, for then those very falsities and evils which they confirm are seen in them. [3] Those things which are of genuine faith look upward to heaven and to the Lord; but those which are of faith separate from charity look downward, and when they confirm evils and falsities they look toward hell. From this also it is evident that faith separate from charity is not faith. From all this it can be seen what is meant by the damnation of faith separate from charity, namely, that it is the damnation of the falsified truth and adulterated good of faith; for when good has been falsified it is no longer truth but falsity, and when good has been adulterated it is no longer good but evil; and faith itself is no longer the faith of truth and good, but of falsity and evil, no matter how it may appear and sound in the outward form.  And (what is a secret) the quality of everyone's faith is such as is the quality of his life. If therefore the life has been damned, so also has the faith; for it is the faith of falsity when the life is a life of evil. That this is so does not appear in the world, but it is clearly shown in the other life when the evil there are being deprived of the memory-knowledge of truth and good, for then the falsities from evils which had lain hidden within them, come forth.  [4] With some of the evil there is a persuasion that the truth of faith is truth, which persuasion is also supposed to be faith, but is not faith; for it is impressed from this end, that it may serve as a means of securing gain, honors, and reputation. So long as these truths serve as means, they are loved for the sake of the end, which is evil; but when they no longer so serve, they are left behind, nay, they are regarded as falsities. This persuasion is what is called "persuasive faith," and is what is meant by the words of the Lord in Matthew:      Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied by Thy name, and by Thy name have cast out demons, and in Thy name done many mighty works? But then will I confess unto them, I know you not; depart from Me ye that work iniquity (Matt. 7:22-23). The same faith is also meant by the "lamps without oil" with the five foolish virgins, who also said, "Lord, Lord, open to us. But He answering said, Verily I say to you, I know you not" (Matt. 25:11-12); by "lamps" are signified the truths of faith, and by "oil" the good of charity; thus by "lamps without oil," the truths of faith without the good of charity. </p>

 <p>From the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon his throne. That this signifies the falsified truths of faith which are in the first place, is evident from the signification of "the firstborn," as being faith (see n. 352, 2435, 6344, 7035); from the representation of Pharaoh, as being memory-knowledge in general perverting the truths of the church (n. 6015, 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692), thus "the firstborn of Pharaoh" denotes the faith of such, consequently the faith of the falsified truths of faith; and from the signification of "throne," as being the reign of truth, and in the opposite sense, the reign of falsity (see n. 5313). That the falsified truths of faith which are in the first place are meant by "the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon his throne" is evident from the fact that it is said "even to the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the millstones," by which are signified the falsified truths of faith which are in the last place; and moreover, the son of a king is what comes first, because a king is the head. [2] Falsified truths in the first place are those which are acknowledged as essentials, such as these: that faith saves howsoever a man has lived; that it saves man in the last hour of his life; and that he then is pure from sins; thus that sins are wiped away in a moment, like the uncleanness of the hands by water; which insist that there is faith without charity, and that in respect to man's salvation the life effects nothing, also that a man-devil can in a moment be made an angel of God. Such and the like are falsified truths in the first place. Those which are thence next derived are in the second place. Those which are remotely derived are in the last place. For the derivations of every truth are ample, and in a long series, some of which enter directly, some indirectly; those which only touch being the last. [3] That such and the like are falsified truths of faith, is very evident; for who does not know, if he thinks justly, that the life of faith causes a man to be spiritual, but not faith except insofar as it has been implanted in the life. The life of man is his love, and that which he loves he wills and intends, and that which he wills and intends, he does. This is the being of man, but not that which he knows and thinks and does not will. This being of man cannot in any wise be changed into another being by thinking about mediation and salvation; but by regeneration anew, which is being effected during a great part of his life; for he must be conceived, born, and grown up anew; and this is not effected by thinking and speaking, but by willing and acting.  [4] These things are said because by the "firstborn of Pharaoh," and the "firstborn of the Egyptians," is signified faith separated from charity, which has been shown in what precedes not to be faith, but the memory-knowledge of such things as are of faith. The firstborn of the Egyptians represented this faith because the Egyptians were versed in the knowledge of rituals of the church above the rest who constituted the representative church after the time of the flood (see n. 4749, 4964, 4966, 6004). At that time all rites were representative of the spiritual things which are in heaven. The Egyptians had more knowledge of these things than others, but in process of time they began to love the knowledges alone, and then, in like manner as is done at this day, to make everything of the church consist in the knowledge of such things as are of the church, and no longer in the life of charity. Thus they inverted the whole order of the church, which being inverted, the truths which are called truths of faith could not but be falsified; for the truths which are applied contrary to Divine order (as is the case when they are applied to evils, and among the Egyptians to magic) are no longer truths with them, but become falsities from the evils to which they are applied. [5] To illustrate this by the worship of a calf among the Egyptians. They knew what a calf represented, namely, the good of charity; so long as they knew this and thought this, when they saw calves, or when they prepared calves in feasts of charity such as the ancients held, and afterward when calves were applied in sacrifices, they then thought sanely and together with the angels in heaven, to whom a calf is the good of charity. But when they began to make calves of gold, and to place them in their temples and worship them, they then thought insanely and together with the infernals; and in this way they inverted a true representative into a false representative. </p>

 <p>Even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the millstones. That this signifies the falsified truths of faith which are in the last place, is evident from the signification of "firstborn," as being faith (of which just above, n. 7779), and because it denotes faith, it denotes truth in the complex, for truth is of faith because it is to be believed; and from the signification of "maidservant," as being the exterior affection of truth, or the affection of memory-knowledges (n. 1895, 2567, 3835, 3849). But a "maidservant behind the millstones" denotes the most external affection of memory-knowledges, for by "behind the millstones" is signified what is in the last place. It is said "behind the millstones" because a "millstone" is predicated of those things which are of faith; for by millstones grain is ground into flour, and is thus prepared for bread; and by "flour" is signified the truth from which is good, and by "bread" that very good which is thence derived. Thus "to sit at the millstones" is to learn and be imbued with such things as may be serviceable to faith, and through faith to charity. For this reason the ancients, when they described the first rudiments of the doctrine of faith, described them by "sitting at the millstones," and the things which were still more rudimentary by "sitting behind the millstones." Because of such a signification, the Lord, where He teaches about the last time of the church, says:      Two women shall be grinding at the mill, the one shall be taken and the other left (Matt. 24:41),  which would never have been said unless a "mill" had signified those things which are of faith. (What a "mill" and "grinding" mean in the internal sense, see n. 4335.) As to the truths of faith which are in the first place, and those which are in the last, be it known that those truths of faith which immediately proceed from the good of charity are what are in the first place, for they are goods in form; but the truths which are in the last place are naked truths; for when truths are successively derived, they recede at each step from good, and finally become naked truths. Such truths are signified by "maidservants behind the millstones." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7781.">7781.</a></font></span>
 <p>And every firstborn of beast. That this signifies the adulterated goods of faith, is evident from the signification of "firstborn," as being faith; and from the signification of "beast," as being the affections of good, and in the opposite sense the affections of evil (see n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 719, 776, 2179, 2180, 3519, 5198). That "beasts" have this signification is from the representatives in the other life (n. 3218). Therefore also such things were signified by them in sacrifices (n. 2180, 2805, 2807, 2830, 3519). As "beasts" had this signification, therefore by "the firstborn of beast" is signified the good of truth, in this case adulterated, because belonging to the Egyptians, who perverted all truths and goods by applications to evil uses. </p>

 <p>And there shall be a great cry in the whole land of Egypt. That this signifies interior lamentation, is evident from the signification of a "cry" (here made on account of the dead firstborn, in the internal sense on account of damnation), as being lamentation. That "a great cry" denotes interior lamentation, is because the greater the lamentation is, the more interior it is. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7783.">7783.</a></font></span>
 <p>Such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it anymore. That this signifies that the state was such that there could not be any like it, can be seen from what has been unfolded above (n. 7649, 7686). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7784.">7784.</a></font></span>
 <p>And to all the sons of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue. That this signifies that among those who are of the spiritual church there shall not be the least of damnation and lamentation, is evident from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (n. 6426, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223); and from the signification of "a dog not moving his tongue," as being that there shall not be the least of damnation and lamentation; for this statement is opposed to the "great cry which shall be in the land of Egypt," which denotes interior lamentation (n. 7782), and this on account of the damnation signified by the death of the firstborn. [2] By those who are of the spiritual church (that is, who are in the good of this church) not having the least of damnation, is not to be understood that they are devoid of all evil; but that they are withheld from evil in good by the Lord. That which is their own is nothing but what is evil and damned; but that which is the Lord's own and which they receive is good, consequently is devoid of all damnation. Thus it is meant that there is nothing of damnation with those who are in the Lord. [3] Its being said that "a dog shall not move his tongue" is on account of the signification of a "dog." A "dog" signifies the lowest of all, or those who are of small value in the church, likewise those who are outside of the church, also those who prate much about the things of the church and understand little; and in the opposite sense, those who are altogether outside of the faith of the church and treat with contumely the things of faith. That "dogs" signify those who are outside of the church, is evident in Matthew:      Jesus said unto the Greek woman, a Syrophoenician, It is not good to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs. But she said, Surely Lord; but even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table. Then Jesus answering said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith; be it unto thee as thou wilt; and her daughter <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">7784-1</font></a> was healed (Matt. 15:26-28; Mark 7:27-28); where by "children" are meant those who are within the church, and by "dogs" those who are outside of it. In like manner by the "dogs which licked the sores of Lazarus" (Luke 16:21); for by the "rich man" there, in the internal sense, is meant one who is within the church and consequently abounds spiritual riches, which are the knowledges of truth and good. "Dogs" denote those who are in the lowest place within the church, who prate much about the things of the church and understand little, and in the opposite sense, those who treat with contumely the things of faith, in these passages:      His watchmen are all blind, they do not know; they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; looking on, lying down, loving to sleep (Isa. 56:10).      They are noisy like a dog, they go round about in the city; for they belch with their mouth; swords are in their lips (Ps. 59:6-7, 14).      That thy foot may stamp in blood, the tongue of thy dogs . . . (Ps. 68:23).      Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before the swine, lest haply they trample them with their feet, and turn and rend you (Matt. 7:6). For this reason the vilest of all things, which was to be cast away, is signified by a "dead dog" (1 Sam. 24:14; 2 Sam. 9:8; 16:9). </p>

 <p>From man and even to beast. That this signifies neither as to truth nor as to good, is evident from the signification of "man," as being truth (see n. 3134); and from the signification of "beast," as being the affection of good, thus good (of which just above, n. 7781). </p>

 <p>That ye may know that Jehovah doth separate between the Egyptians and Israel. That this signifies that it may be known what is the difference between those who are in evil and those who are in good, is evident from the signification of "knowing," as being to be known; from the representation of the Egyptians, as being those who are in evil (by "the Egyptians" were before signified those who are in falsity, but now, after they have been vastated in respect to the truths of the church which they knew, they signify those who are in evil, for by the death of the firstborn is signified damnation, which is a state of evil); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (see above, n. 7784), thus those who are in good; for they who are of the spiritual church are led by means of faith to charity, thus by means of truth to good. </p>

 <p>And bow down themselves to me. That this signifies respect from fear on account of truth Divine, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being truth Divine (of which frequently above); from the signification of "bowing down themselves," as being humiliation; but here, because it is said of those who are in evil, it denotes respect from fear. It is said "respect from fear," because the evil have not any respect for truth Divine, not even for the Divine Itself, except that which they have from fear; for they who are in hell love themselves alone, and those who love themselves alone have no respect for anyone else, because they turn toward themselves all respect for others, even for the Divine Itself. Where love is, there is respect; where love is not, there is no respect except that which is from fear. For this reason the evil in the other life undergo punishments, until at last they do not venture to rise up against the good and infest them; for they are deterred from doing evil by no other means than the fear of punishments.  </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7789.">7789.</a></font></span>
 <p>Saying, Get thee out, and all the people that is at thy feet. That this signifies supplication that those may depart who are in truth from the Divine, from the highest to the lowest, is evident from the signification of "going out," as being to depart; from the representation of Moses, who is here meant by "thee," as being truth Divine; from the signification of "people," as being those who are in truth from the Divine; for by the sons of Israel, who are here "the people," are represented those who are of the spiritual church, thus who are in the truth of good and in the good of truth, here those who are in the truth from the Divine, because it is said "the people who are at thy feet," for by Moses is represented truth Divine; and from the signification of "at thy feet," as being those who are beneath, thus who are subordinate. For the "feet" signify lower because natural things, because the natural world is beneath the spiritual world (that the "feet" signify natural things see n. 2162, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952); and for this reason it is said, "the people who are at thy feet." From the highest to the lowest is also signified; by "Moses" the highest, because he represents truth Divine; by "the people at his feet," all and each of those who are in truth from the Divine. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7790.">7790.</a></font></span>
 <p>And thereafter I will go out. That this signifies that truth Divine will depart, is evident from the signification of "going out," as being to depart; and from the representation of Moses, as being truth Divine. These things signify that when those who have infested the upright are damned, all truth Divine departs from them; for they are then in the state of their evil, and evil rejects and extinguishes all truth Divine. Heretofore, previous to their damnation, they were indeed acquainted with the truths of faith; but nevertheless they had no truths in them; for truths were then in their mouth, but not in the heart; and therefore when they have been vastated as to these truths, evil remains, and then also the falsity of evil comes forth to view which had lain hidden within them; for although they had professed truths, they were nevertheless not in truths, but in falsities. Moreover, the very profession of truth did not descend from its own beginning, namely, from good; but from evil; for they had made it for the sake of gain, honors, and reputation, thus for the sake of themselves and the world. The truths which descend from such a beginning adhere on the surface, and therefore when they are being vastated the truths fall off like scales, and when they fall off, they leave places that are foul-smelling and putrid from the falsities which exhale from the evils there. Such is the lot of those who have known the truths of faith, and yet have lived contrary to them, according to the Lord's words in Luke:      That servant who knoweth his Lord's will, but maketh not himself ready, nor doeth his will, shall be beaten with many stripes; but he that knoweth not, though he do things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few (Luke 12:47-48). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7791.">7791.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he went out from before Pharaoh in the wrath of anger. That this signifies the rending asunder of the presence of truth Divine from those about to be damned, is evident from the signification of "going out," as being to depart, here to be rent asunder, because it is said "in the wrath of anger;" moreover, at the last when damnation takes place, there is a rending asunder; for when they begin to hold truth Divine in aversion, and also to fear it, and finally to feel horror at its presence, they rend themselves asunder from it; from the representation of Moses, as being truth Divine (of which frequently above); from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who had infested those who are of the spiritual church (of which also frequently above), but in the present case those who are about to be damned, for damnation is signified by the firstborn being given up to death (see n. 7778); and from the signification of "the wrath of anger," as being repugnance and aversion (see n. 3614, 5034, 5798), and when attributed to the Divine, as here to the Divine truth which is represented by Moses, it is not meant that the Divine turns itself away, but that they who are in evil turn themselves away (see n. 5798). "Wrath" is predicated of falsity, and "anger" of evil (n. 3614). </p>

 <p>Verses 9, 10. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hear you; that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and Jehovah made firm the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies information; "Pharaoh will not hear you," signifies no obedience; "that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt," signifies that they may be confirmed in the fact that they were in no faith, but in evil; "and Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh," signifies that these vastations, and the consequent confirmations that they were in evil, were effected by means of truth proceeding from the Divine; "and Jehovah made firm the heart of Pharaoh," signifies that they were determined; "and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land," signifies that they did not leave those who were of the spiritual church. </p>

 <p>Pharaoh will not hear you. That this signifies no obedience, is evident from the signification of "to hear," as being obedience (n. 2542, 3869, 4652-4660, 5017, 7216); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who have infested the upright in the other life, and who are now about to be damned. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7795.">7795.</a></font></span>
 <p>That My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. That this signifies that it may be confirmed that they had been in no faith, but in evil, is evident from the signification of the "wonders" and "signs" that were done in Egypt, as being vastations and consequent confirmations that they were evil (n. 7633); for these "wonders" signified so many degrees of the vastation of those who within the church had been in the memory-knowledge of such things as are of faith, and yet had lived evilly; and because these are they who infest the upright in the other life, it is their state now which is here signified (n. 7465). By these "wonders being multiplied" are signified the successive degrees of their states. The reason why there are so many degrees is in order that the evil may be confirmed in the fact that they are in evil; and also that the good may be enlightened concerning the state of those within the church who have lived evilly (n. 7633). Except for these reasons, the evil might be condemned and let down into hell without so many successive changes of states.  [2] That before the evil are condemned and let down into hell they undergo so many states is altogether unknown in the world. It is believed that man is at once either condemned or saved, and that this is effected without any process; but the case is otherwise. Justice reigns there, and no one is condemned until he himself knows, and is inwardly convinced, that he is in evil, and that it is utterly impossible for him to be in heaven. His own evils are also laid open to him, according to the words of the Lord in Luke:      There is nothing covered up, that shall not be revealed; or hidden, that shall not be known. Wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in the bed chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops (Luke 12:2-3; Matt. 10:26-27; Mark 4:22); and what is more, he is also warned to desist from evil; but when he cannot do this because of the dominion of evil, the power is then taken away from him of doing evil by falsifications of truth and pretenses of good, which is effected successively from one degree to another, and finally condemnation follows and the letting down into hell. This takes place when he comes into the evil of his life. [3] The evil of the life is evil of the will and of the thought thence derived; thus it is the man's inward quality and what would be his quality outwardly if he were not hindered by the laws, and likewise by fears of the loss of gain, of honor, of reputation, and of life. This is the life which follows every man after death, but not the outward life, except that which proceeds from the inward life; for in outward things a man pretends what is contrary; and therefore when a man after death is being vastated in respect to outward things, it then plainly appears what had been his quality both in will and in thought. To this state every evil person is reduced by means of degrees of vastation, for all vastation in the other life advances from outward to inward things. From all this it can be seen what is the nature of the justice in the other life, and what the nature of the process before an evil person is condemned. From this it is evident that by "My wonders being multiplied in the land of Egypt," is signified that the evil may be confirmed in the fact that they have been in no faith, but in evil. (That they who are in evil have no faith, see above, n. 7778.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7796.">7796.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh. That this signifies that these vastations, and the consequent confirmations that they were in evil, were effected by means of truth from the Divine, is evident from the representation of Moses and Aaron, as being truth Divine, Moses the truth which proceeds immediately from the Divine, and Aaron the truth which proceeds mediately (see n. 7010, 7089, 7382); and from the signification of the "wonders done in Egypt" or "before Pharaoh," as being so many vastations of those who had been of the church and had lived evilly. That the "wonders of Egypt" have this signification can be seen from the signification of the several wonders; that they are also confirmations that they are not in faith but in evil, see just above (n. 7795). It is said that "Moses and Aaron did these wonders," when yet they were not done by them, but by the Divine; but it is so said because by Moses and Aaron is represented truth Divine, and the wonders were wrought by the Divine by means of truth proceeding from Itself; for all things which are done by the Divine Itself are done by means of truth proceeding from Itself; the Divine Itself is the being [esse] of all things, whereas the truth proceeding from It is the derivative manifestation [existere] of all things; Good Itself, which is the Divine Esse, produces all things by means of its truth. It is said that vastations are effected by means of truth from the Divine, but it is to be understood that Divine truth is not the cause, for the Divine vastates no one; but the evil person vastates himself by rendering himself determined against truth Divine, extinguishing, rejecting, or perverting it; and by turning the good Divine which continually flows in, into evil. This evil then is that which vastates, and from this it is evident whence the cause is, namely, that the influx of good and of truth from the Divine is not the cause, for without the influx of these there is no life; but the cause is their conversion into evil and falsity, which is done by him who is in evil. </p>

 <p>And Jehovah made firm the heart of Pharaoh. That this signifies that they were determined, is evident from the signification of "making firm the heart," as being to be determined (see n. 7272, 7300, 7305.

 <p>ON THE SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE PLANET JUPITER.           Social interaction with the spirits and angels of the planet Jupiter has been granted me a longer time than with the spirits of the other planets, and therefore more particulars are to be related concerning their state, and that of the inhabitants of this planet. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7800.">7800.</a></font></span>
 <p>The planet Jupiter does not indeed appear to those who are in the other life; but the spirits who are from it. These appear in front, to the left, at some distance, and this constantly; there also the planet is in the idea of spirits and angels. The spirits of each planet are separate from those of other planets, and are near their own world. The reason why they are separated is that they are of a different disposition, and are in a different province in the Grand Man; and they who are of a different disposition appear remote from others according to the diversity. All separation and distinction of spirits and angels in respect to places and distances in the other life, appear in accordance with the diversities of dispositions and genius, for place corresponds to state (see n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387, 4321, 4882, 5605, 7381). </p>
