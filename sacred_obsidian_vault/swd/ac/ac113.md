 <p>And we told him according to the mouth of these words. That this signifies that he perceived them conformably, is evident from the signification of "telling," as being to perceive (see n. 3608), for in the spiritual world or in heaven they have no need to tell what they think, there being a communication of all thoughts (n. 5597), and therefore in the spiritual sense "telling" signifies perceiving; and from the signification of "according to these words," as being conformably; for they are the things he desired to perceive. </p>

 <p>Knowing could we know that he would say, Bring your brother down? That this signifies that we did not believe that he desired the truth of good to be conjoined with himself, is evident from the signification of "knowing could we know that he would say," as being not to believe; and from the representation of Benjamin, who is here the "brother," as being the truth of good (of which just above, n. 5600). That this was to be conjoined with him is signified by their "bringing him down," as is plain from what was said above (n. 5596). </p>

 <p>And Judah said unto Israel his father. That this signifies perception from the good of the church concerning these things, is evident from the signification of "saying" in the historicals of the Word, as being to perceive (of which often above); from the representation of Judah, as being the good of the church (see n. 5583); and from the representation of Israel, as being the internal spiritual church (n. 3305, 4286). From this it is plain that by "Judah's saying to Israel his father" is signified the perception of the church from its good. </p>

 <p>Send the boy with me. That this signifies that he should be adjoined to him, namely, to the good of the church which is represented by Judah, is evident from the signification of "sending with him," as being to be adjoined to him, and not to the others; for it is said in what follows "I will be surety for him, of my hand shalt thou require him;" and from the representation of Benjamin, who is here the "boy," as being interior truth (of which just above, n. 5600). This is called the "boy," because that which is interior is in the Word called relatively a "boy," for the reason that there is more innocence in the interior than in the exterior, and innocence is signified by an "infant," and also by a "boy" (n. 5236). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5605.">5605.</a></font></span>
 <p>And we will arise and go, and we will live, and not die. That this signifies spiritual life according to degrees, is evident from the signification of "arising," as being elevation to higher or interior things, consequently to the things of spiritual life (see n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171, 4103, 4881); from the signification of "going," as being to live (n. 3335, 3690, 4882, 5493), and as the words follow "and we will live," "going" signifies the first spiritual life; from the signification of "living," as being spiritual life, for no other life is meant in the internal sense of the Word; and from the signification of "not dying," as being no longer to be damned, that is, to be out of a state of damnation, for in the internal sense of the Word no other than spiritual death is meant, which is damnation. From this it is plain that by "we will arise and go, and we will live and not die" is signified life according to degrees; namely, introduction into life by "arising," the first of life by "going," life itself by "living," and being led out from the things of no life by "not dying."  [2] That "to go" in the internal sense is to live, seems strange to him who knows nothing about spiritual life; but it is like "journeying," which denotes the order of life and what is successive of life (n. 1293, 4375, 4554, 4585), and like "sojourning," which denotes to be instructed and to live accordingly (n. 1463, 2025, 3672). The reason why "going," "journeying," and "sojourning" have these significations might indeed be told, but the reason is of such a nature as could scarcely be accepted by those who are ignorant of the nature of movements in the other life. Movements and progressions there are nothing else-because from no other source-than changes of the state of life. These changes appear in externals exactly like progressions from place to place. That this is so can be confirmed by much experience in the other life; for I have walked there in spirit with them and among them, through many of their abodes, and this though in body I remained in the same place. I have also talked with them as to how this could be, and have been informed that it is the changes of the state of life that make progressions in the spiritual world. [3] This was also confirmed by the fact that by means of changes induced on their states, spirits can appear on high, and then in a moment beneath, or now far to the west, and in a moment to the east, and so on. But as before said this cannot but seem strange to him who knows nothing about life in the spiritual world; for there are no spaces or times there, but states of life instead. These states produce in externals a most living appearance of progressions and motions. The appearance is as living and real as that life itself is in us and therefore our own, when yet life flows in from the Lord, who is the fountain of all life (see n. 2021, 2658, 2706, 2886-2888, 3001, 3318, 3337-3338, 3484, 3619, 3741-3743, 4151, 4249, 4318-4320, 4417, 4523, 4524, 4882). As "going" and "moving" signify living, it was therefore said by the ancients, that "in God we move, live, and have our being" [Acts 17:28]; and by "moving" they meant the external of life, by "living" its internal, and by "being" its inmost. </p>

 <p>Both we. That this signifies the external of the church, is manifest from the representation of the ten sons of Jacob, who here are "we," as being the external of the church (see n. 5469). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5607.">5607.</a></font></span>
 <p>And thou. That this signifies its internal, is evident from the representation of Israel, who here is "thou," as being the internal of the church (see n. 4286, 4292, 4570). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5608.">5608.</a></font></span>
 <p>And also our little ones. That this signifies the things still more interior, is evident from the signification of "little ones," as being the things which are interior (see n. 5604). That more interior things are signified by "little children" and by "boys," is because innocence is signified by both, and innocence is what is inmost. In the heavens the inmost or third heaven consists of those who are in innocence, for they are in love to the Lord; and because the Lord is innocence itself, therefore they who are there, being in love to Him, are in innocence. These, although they are the wisest of all in the heavens, yet appear to others like little children. It is for this reason, and also because little children are in innocence, that by "little children" in the Word is signified innocence. [2] As the inmost of the heavens is innocence, therefore that which is interior with all in the heavens must be innocence. This is like successive things in relation to those which exist together, or like the things which are distinct from one another by degrees in relation to those which exist from them; for all that which exists simultaneously, springs from that which is successive. When the former exists from the latter, the parts place themselves in the same order as that in which they had before been distinguished by degrees; as, by way of illustration, end, cause, and effect are in succession and distinct from one another; and when they exist together they place themselves in the same order, the end as inmost, the cause next, and the effect last. The effect is coexisting, and is such that unless there is in it a cause, and in the cause an end, there is no effect, because if from the effect you remove the cause you destroy the effect, and still more if from the cause you remove the end; for from the end the cause has what makes it a cause, and from the cause the effect has what makes it an effect.  [3] So also it is in the spiritual world: just as the end, cause, and effect are distinct from one another, so in the spiritual world are love to the Lord, charity toward the neighbor, and the works of charity. When these three become one or exist together, the first must be in the second, and the second in the third. And also as in the works of charity: unless charity from affection or the heart is within them, they are not works of charity; and unless love to God is within charity, it is not charity. Therefore if you take away that which is interior, the exterior falls; for the exterior comes into existence and subsists from its interiors in order. So is it with innocence. This makes one with love to the Lord, and unless it is within charity it is not charity; consequently unless charity in which there is innocence is within the works of charity they are not works of charity. Hence it is that innocence must be within all who are in the heavens. [4] That this is so, and that innocence is signified by "little children," is evident in Mark: 	Jesus said to the disciples, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And taking them up in His arms, he put His hand upon them, and blessed them (Mark 10:14-16; Luke 18:15-17; Matt. 18:3). It is evident that by "little children" is here signified innocence, because with little children there is innocence, and because those who are innocent appear in heaven as little children. [5] No one can enter heaven unless he has somewhat of innocence (see n. 4797); and moreover little children suffer themselves to be governed by angels who are forms of innocence, and not as yet by what is their own, as is the case with adults who govern themselves by their own judgment and will. That little children suffer themselves to be governed by angels is evident from the Lord's words in Matthew: 	See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, that their angels in the heavens do always behold the face of My Father (Matt. 18:10); no one can "see the face" of God except from innocence. [6] In the following passages also innocence is signified by "infants" or "little children." In Matthew: 	Out of the mouth of babes and suckling, Thou hast perfected praise (Matt. 21:16; Ps. 8:2). Again, 	Thou hast hid these things from the wise and the intelligent, and hast revealed them unto babes (Matt. 11:25; Luke 10:21); for innocence, which is signified by "babes," is wisdom itself, because genuine innocence dwells in wisdom (n. 2305-2306, 4797). For this reason it is said, "out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise," and also that such things have been "revealed unto babes." [7] In Isaiah: 	The cow and the bear shall feed, their young ones shall lie down together, and the suckling shall play on the hole of the viper (Isa. 11:7-8); speaking of the Lord's kingdom, and specifically of the state of peace or innocence therein. A "suckling" denotes innocence; that nothing of evil can befall those who are in innocence is signified by a "suckling playing on the hole of a viper"; "vipers" are they who are most crafty. This chapter plainly relates to the Lord. In Joel: 	Sound the trumpet in Zion, gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the babes and those that suck the breasts (Joel 2:15-16); "elders" denotes the wise; "babes and those that suck the breasts," the innocent. [8] In the following passages also by "infants" is meant innocence, but in these that it was destroyed. In Jeremiah: 	Wherefore commit ye great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, so that I shall leave you no remains? (Jer. 44:7). Again: 	Lift up thy hands to Him upon the soul of thy little children, that faint for hunger in the head of all the streets (Lam. 2:19). In Ezekiel: 	Pass through Jerusalem, and smite, let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity, the old man, the young man, and the maiden, and the little child (Ezek. 9:5-6). In Micah: 	The women of My people ye drive out of everyone's house of delights, from the babes thereof they take away Mine honor forever (Micah 2:9). [9] As regards the innocence of little children however, it is only external and not internal; and because it is not internal it cannot be conjoined with any wisdom. But the innocence of the angels, especially those of the third heaven, is internal innocence, and thus conjoined with wisdom (n. 2305, 2306, 3494, 4563, 4797). Man is so created that when he grows old and becomes like a little child, the innocence of wisdom conjoins itself with the innocence of ignorance which he had in infancy, and so he passes into the other life as a true infant. </p>

 <p>And I wilt be surety for him. That this signifies that in the meantime it will be adjoined to itself, is evident from the signification of "being surety for" anyone, as being to be instead of him, as is plain from what now follows, especially from what Judah said to Joseph about his being surety (Gen. 44:32-33); and as to be surety for anyone denotes to be instead of him, it also denotes that while in the way it is adjoined to itself. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5610.">5610.</a></font></span>
 <p>Of my hand shalt thou require him. That this signifies that it shall not be torn away insofar as lies in its power, is evident from the signification of the "hand," as being power (see n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937, 5327, 5328, 5544), and that it denotes insofar as lies in its power, is because surety or guarantee goes no further (the internal sense here sets forth the truth and the nature of it); and from the signification of "requiring him from him," as being not to be torn away; for one who is required of another must be adjoined to him and not be torn from him. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5611.">5611.</a></font></span>
 <p>If I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee. That this signifies unless he is quite restored to the church, is evident from the signification of "bringing to him and setting before him," as being to completely restore; and from the representation of Israel, to whom he was to be restored, as being the church (see n. 3305, 4286, 5595). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5612.">5612.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I shall sin to thee all the days. That this signifies that the good of the church will no longer be, is evident from the representation of Judah, who says this of himself, as being the good of the church (see n. 5583, 5603); and from the signification of "sinning," as being disjunction (see n. 5229, 5474), thus that it will not be, for anything that is disjoined from another is not with it any longer; and from the signification of "all the days," as being forever, thus no longer. These things are said because the good of the church is impossible without the intermediate between the internal and the external which is represented by Benjamin; for both the good and the truth of the church flow from the internal through the intermediate into the external, and consequently in the degree that it is important to have the good of the church, in the same degree it is important to have the intermediate. It is for this reason that Judah makes himself surety for Benjamin. That the good of the church is not possible without the intermediate, is signified by these words of Judah, and that the truth of the church is not possible, by Reuben's words (n. 5542). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5613.">5613.</a></font></span>
 <p>For except we had lingered. That this signifies tarrying in a state of doubt, is evident from the signification of "lingering," as being a state of doubt; for as "going," "advancing," "journeying," and "sojourning" signify states of life (see n. 5605), so "lingering" signifies a state of doubt, because when the state of life is in a state of doubt, then the external is in a state of lingering. Moreover, this is to be seen in man himself; for when his mind hangs in any doubt, he halts and deliberates. The reason is that doubt makes the state of life hesitating and wavering, and consequently the outward progression, which is the effect. Hence it is plain that tarrying in a state of doubt is signified by "except we had lingered." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5614.">5614.</a></font></span>
 <p>Surely we had now returned these two times. That this signifies that there would have been spiritual life both exterior and interior, is evident from the signification of "going," as being to live (of which above, n. 5605); and therefore "returning" is living therefrom, for they went thither to procure corn, and by "corn" is signified the good of truth from which is spiritual life; and from the signification of "these two times," which, as it relates to life, denotes life exterior and interior, for by the "produce" they got the first time was signified life that is exterior or in the natural, for the reason that they were without an intermediate (as explained in the preceding chapter); while by the "corn" they get this time is signified interior life, because they were now with Benjamin, who is the intermediate, as explained in this and in the following chapter. Hence it is that by "surely we had now returned these two times," is signified spiritual life both exterior and interior. [2] That this is the signification cannot but seem strange, especially to one who knows nothing about what is spiritual; for it seems as if "returning these two times" has nothing in common with the spiritual life that is signified; but still this is the internal sense of the words. If you will believe it, the interior thought itself of the man who is in good apprehends this, because this thought is in the internal sense, although while in the body the man is deeply ignorant of it; for unknown to him the internal sense, that is, the spiritual sense, which is of the interior thought, falls into material and sensuous ideas that partake of time and space and of such things as are in the world, and therefore it does not appear that his interior thought is of such a nature; for his interior thought is like that of the angels, his spirit being in company with them.  [3] That the thought of the man who is in good is according to the internal sense, may be seen from the fact that when after death he comes into heaven, he at once without any information is in the internal sense, and this could not be unless as to his interior thought he had been in this sense while in the world. The reason of his being in this internal sense is that there is a correspondence between spiritual and natural things so complete that there is not the smallest thing that has not its correspondence; and therefore because the interior or rational mind of the man who is in good is in the spiritual world, and his exterior or natural mind in the natural world, it must needs be that both minds think (the interior mind spiritually, and the exterior naturally), and that the spiritual falls into the natural, and they act as a one by correspondence. [4] That man's interior mind, the ideas of thought of which are called intellectual and are said to be immaterial, does not think from the words of any language, nor consequently from natural forms, can be seen by him who is able to reflect on these things, for he can think in a moment what he can scarcely utter in an hour, and he does so by universals which comprise in them very many particulars. These ideas of thought are spiritual, and when the Word is being read are no other than as the internal sense is; although the man does not know this, because as before said these spiritual ideas, by influx into what is natural, present natural ideas, so that the spiritual ideas do not appear; insomuch that unless he has been instructed the man believes that there is no spiritual unless it is like the natural, and even that he does not think otherwise in spirit than as he speaks in the body. In such a manner does the natural cast a shade over the spiritual. </p>

 <p>Verses 11-14. And their father Israel said unto them, If therefore this be so, do this; take of the song of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little resin and a little honey, wax and stacte, terebinth <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_136"><font size="1">5615-1</font></a> nuts and almonds; and take double silver in your hand; and the silver that was returned in the mouth of your bags carry back in your hand; peradventure it was an error; and take your brother, and arise, and return unto the man; and God Shaddai give you mercies before the man, and send you your other brother and Benjamin. And I, as I have been bereaved I shall be bereaved. "And their father Israel said unto them," signifies perception from spiritual good; "If therefore this be so, do this," signifies if it cannot be done otherwise, so let it be done; "take of the song of the land in your vessels," signifies the choice things of the church in the truths of faith; "and carry down the man a present," signifies to obtain favor; "a little resin and a little honey," signifies the truths of good of the exterior natural, and its delight; "wax and stacte," signifies the truths of good of the interior natural; "terebinth nuts and almonds," signifies goods of life corresponding to these truths; "and take double silver in your hands," signifies truth received in the abilities; "and the silver that was returned in the mouth of your bags carry back in your hand," signifies that by truth gratuitously given in the exterior natural they were to submit themselves as far as possible; "peradventure it was an error," signifies lest he be adverse; "and take your brother," signifies that thus they would have the good of faith; "and arise, and return unto the man," signifies life from spiritual truth; "and God Shaddai," signifies consolation after hardships; "give you mercies before the man," signifies may spiritual truth receive you graciously; "and send you your other brother," signifies may it give the good of faith; "and Benjamin," signifies and also interior truth; "and I, as I have been bereaved I shall be bereaved," signifies that the church, before these things are done, will be as if deprived of its truths. </p>
 
 
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5616.">5616.</a></font></span>
 <p>And their father Israel said unto them. That this signifies perception from spiritual good, is evident from the signification of "saying" in the historicals of the Word, as being perception; and from the representation of Israel, as being spiritual good (of which above, n. 5595). He is called "father" because the truths that his sons represent are from this good as from a father. </p>

 <p>If therefore this be so, do this. That this signifies that if it cannot be done otherwise so let it be done, is evident without explication. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5618.">5618.</a></font></span>
 <p>Take of the song of the land in your vessels. That this signifies the choice things of the church in the truths of faith, is evident from the signification of the "song," as being the choice things (of which in what follows); and from the signification of the "land," as being the church (of which above, n. 5577); and from the signification of "vessels," as being the truths of faith (n. 3068, 3079, 3316, 3318). The word "song" is used because this word in the original tongue is derived from singing; hence the "song of the land" signifies productions hailed with songs and praises, consequently in the internal sense choice things. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5619.">5619.</a></font></span>
 <p>And carry down the man a present. That this signifies obtaining favor, is evident from the signification of "offering a present to the man," here to Joseph, who is called the "lord of the land," as being to obtain favor. It was customary in the Ancient representative Church, and thence in the Jewish, to give some present to judges, and at a later period to kings and priests, when they were approached; moreover, this was commanded. The reason was that the presents they gave them represented such things in man as ought to be offered to the Lord when He is approached, which are things that are from freedom, consequently from the man himself; for his freedom is what is from the heart, and what is from the heart is from the will, and what is from the will is from the affection which is of the love, and what is from the affection which is of the love is free, thus of the man himself (see n. 1947, 2870-2893, 3158). From this it is that a present should be given by man to the Lord on approaching Him. It was this present that was represented; for kings represented the Lord as to Divine truth (n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4581, 4966, 5044), and priests as to Divine good (n. 1728, 2015, 3670). That these presents were initiations, see n. 4262; and initiations are for obtaining favor. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5620.">5620.</a></font></span>
 <p>A little resin and a little honey. That this signifies the truths of good of the exterior natural and its delight, is evident from the signification of "resin," as being the truth of good or truth from good (see n. 4748). The reason why "resin" has this signification is that it ranks among unguents, and also among aromatics. "Aromatics" signify such things as are of truth from good, especially if they are of an unctuous nature, and so partake of oil; for "oil" signifies good (n. 886, 3728, 4582). That this resin was aromatic, may be seen in Gen. 37:25; and for this reason also the same word in the original means balsam. That it was like an ointment or thick oil, is evident. This then is the reason why by "resin" is signified the truth of good which is in the natural, here in the exterior, because "resin" is put first and joined with "honey," which is the delight therein. That "honey" denotes delight is because it is sweet, and everything sweet in the natural world corresponds to what is delightful and pleasant in the spiritual world. The reason why it is called its delight, that is, the delight of truth from good in the exterior natural, is that every truth and especially every truth of good has its own delight; but a delight from the affection of these, and from the derivative use. [2] That "honey" is delight is evident also from other passages in the Word, as in Isaiah: 	A virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call His name Immanuel [God with us]. Butter and honey shall He eat, that He may know to refuse the evil and choose the good (Isa. 7:14-15); speaking of the Lord; "butter" denotes the celestial; "honey," that which is from the celestial. [3] In the same: 	It shall come to pass for the multitude of milk that they shall yield, he shall eat butter; and butter and honey shall everyone eat that is left in the midst of the land (Isa. 7:22); speaking of the Lord's kingdom; "milk" denotes spiritual good; "butter," celestial good; and "honey," that which is from them, thus what is happy, pleasant, and delightful. [4] In Ezekiel: 	Thus wast thou adorned with gold and silver; and thy garments were of fine linen and silk and broidered work. Thou didst eat fine flour and honey and oil; so thou becamest beautiful very exceedingly, and thou didst prosper even unto a kingdom. With fine flour and oil and honey I fed thee; but thou didst set it before them for an odor of rest (Ezek. 16:13, 19); speaking of Jerusalem, by which is meant the spiritual church, the quality of which is described as it was with the ancients, and as it afterward became. Her being "adorned with gold and silver" denotes with celestial and spiritual good and truth; her "garments of fine linen, silk, and broidered work" denotes truths in the rational and in each natural; "fine flour" denotes the spiritual; "honey," its pleasantness; and "oil," its good. That such things as belong to heaven are signified by these particulars can be seen by anyone. [5] In the same: 	Judah and the land of Israel were thy traders, in wheat of Minnith, and pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm (Ezek. 27:17); speaking of Tyre, by which is signified the spiritual church such as it was in the beginning and such as it afterward became, but in respect to the knowledges of good and truth (n. 1201). "Honey" here also denotes the pleasantness and delight from the affections of knowing and learning celestial and spiritual goods and truths. [6] In Moses: 	Thou makest him ride on the high places of the earth, and he eats the produce of the fields. He maketh him suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flint of the rock (Deut. 32:13); here also treating of the Ancient spiritual Church; "to suck honey out of the rock" denotes delight from truths of memory-knowledge. [7] In David: 	I feed them with the fat of wheat, and with honey out of the rock I sate them (Ps. 81:16); "to sate with honey out of the rock" denotes to fill with delight from the truths of faith. [8] In Deuteronomy: 	Jehovah bringeth me unto a good land, a land of rivers of water, of fountains and of deeps that go out from the valley, and from the mountain; a land of wheat and barley, and of vine and of fig and of pomegranate; a land of oil olive and of honey (Deut. 8:7-8); speaking of the land of Canaan; in the internal sense, of the Lord's kingdom in the heavens. A "land of oil olive and of honey" denotes spiritual good and its pleasantness. [9] Hence also the land of Canaan was called: 	A land flowing with milk and honey (Num. 13:27; 14:8; Deut. 26:9, 15; 27:3; Jer. 11:5; 32:22; Ezek. 20:6). In the internal sense of these passages by the "land of Canaan" is meant, as before said, the Lord's kingdom; "flowing with milk" denotes an abundance of celestial spiritual things; and "with honey," an abundance of derivative happiness and delights. [10] In David: 	The judgments of Jehovah are truth, righteous are they together; more to be desired are they than gold and much fine gold, sweeter also than honey and the dropping of the honeycombs (Ps. 19:9-10); the "judgments of Jehovah" denote truth Divine; "sweeter than honey and the dropping of the honeycombs" denotes delights from good and pleasantnesses from truth. Again: 	Sweet are Thy words to my palate, sweeter than honey to my mouth (Ps. 119:103); where the meaning is similar. [11] The manna that Jacob's posterity had for bread in the wilderness is thus described in Moses: 	The manna was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like a cake kneaded with honey (Exod. 16:31); as the manna signified the truth Divine that descends through heaven from the Lord, it consequently signified the Lord Himself as to the Divine Human, as He Himself teaches in John 6:51, 58; for it is the Lord's Divine Human from which all truth Divine comes, yea, of which all truth Divine treats; and this being so, the manna is described in respect to delight and pleasantness by the taste, that it was "like a cake kneaded with honey." (That the taste denotes the delight of good and the pleasantness of truth may be seen above, n. 3502.) [12] As John the Baptist represented the Lord as to the Word, which is the Divine truth on earth, in like manner as Elijah (n. 2762, 5247), he was therefore the "Elijah who was to come" before the Lord (Mal. 4:5; Matt. 17:10-12; Mark 9:11-13; Luke 1:17); wherefore his clothing and food were significative, of which we read in Matthew: 	John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loin; and his meat was locusts and wild honey (Matt. 3:4; Mark 1:6). The "clothing of camel's hair" signified that the Word, such as is its literal sense as to truth (which sense is a clothing for the internal sense), is natural; for what is natural is signified by "hair," and also by "camels;" and the "meat being of locusts and wild honey" signified the Word such as is its literal sense as to good; the delight of this is signified by "wild honey." [13] The delight of truth Divine in respect to the external sense is also described by "honey" in Ezekiel: 	He said unto me, Son of man, feed thy belly and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. And when I ate it, it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness (Ezek. 3:3). And in John: 	The angel said unto me, Take the little book and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. So I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey; but when I had eaten it my belly was made bitter. Then he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings (Rev. 10:9-11). The "roll" in Ezekiel, and the "little book" in John, denote truth Divine. That in the external form this appears delightful, is signified by the flavor being "sweet as honey;" for truth Divine, like the Word, is delightful in the external form or in the literal sense because this admits of being unfolded by interpretations in everyone's favor. But not so the internal sense, which is therefore signified by the "bitter" taste; for this sense discloses man's interiors. The reason why the external sense is delightful, is as before said that the things in it can be unfolded favorably; for they are only general truths, and general truths are susceptible of this before they are qualified by particulars, and these by singulars. It is delightful also because it is natural, and what is spiritual conceals itself within. Moreover, it must be delightful in order that man may receive it, that is, be introduced into it, and not be deterred at the very threshold. [14] The "honeycomb and broiled fish" that the Lord ate with the disciples after His resurrection, also signified the external sense of the Word (the "fish" as to its truth and the "honeycomb" as to its pleasantness), in regard to which we read in Luke: 	Jesus said, Have ye here anything to eat? They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish, and of a honeycomb, and He took them and did eat before them (Luke 24:41-43). And because these things are signified, the Lord therefore said to them: 	These are the words which I spoke unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Me (Luke 24:44). It appears as if such things were not signified, because their having a piece of broiled fish and a honeycomb seems as if fortuitous; nevertheless it was of providence, and not only this, but also all other, even the least, of the things that occur in the Word. As such things were signified, therefore the Lord said of the Word that in it were written the things concerning Himself. Yet the things written of the Lord in the literal sense of the Old Testament are few; but those in its internal sense are all so written, for from this is the holiness of the Word. This is what is meant by His saying that "all things must be fulfilled which are written in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Him."  [15] From all this it may now be seen that by "honey" is signified the delight that is from good and truth, or from the affection of them, and that there is specifically signified external delight, thus the delight of the exterior natural. As this delight is of such a nature as to be from the world through the things of the senses, and thereby contains within it many things from the love of the world, the use of honey in the meat-offerings was therefore forbidden, as in Leviticus: 	No meat-offering which ye shall bring unto Jehovah shall be made with leaven; for there shall be no leaven, nor any honey, from what ye burn with fire to Jehovah (Lev. 2:11); where "honey" denotes such external delight, which, because it contains in it what partakes of the love of the world, was also like leaven, and was on this account forbidden. (What "leaven" or "leavened" means may be seen above, n. 2342.) </p>

 <p>Wax and stacte. That this signifies the truths of good of the interior natural, is evident from the signification of "wax," here aromatic wax, as being the truth of good (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "stacte," as also being truth from good (see n. 4748). Their being of the interior natural is because these spices are purer than resin and honey, and are therefore mentioned in the second place; for such particulars are enumerated in the Word in accordance with the order. By "wax" here is not meant common, but aromatic wax, such as storax. This wax is signified by the term used in the original language, and spice also by the same. Hence it is plain why this aromatic wax signifies the truth of good; for all spices, being sweet-scented, in the internal sense signify the truths which are from good. This may be seen from the fact that truths from good are perceived in heaven pleasantly, like sweet-scented things in the world; and therefore when the perceptions of the angels are turned into odors, as of the Lord's good pleasure often happens, they are then smelt as fragrances from spices and from flowers. This is the reason why frankincense and incense were compounded of materials of grateful odor, and were employed for a holy use; and also why aromatics were mixed with the anointing oil. One who does not know that such things derive their cause from things perceived in heaven, may be of the opinion that they were commanded merely to render outward worship grateful; but in that case there would be in them nothing of heaven, or nothing holy, and consequently such matters of worship would not have anything Divine in them. (See what has already been shown on this subject; that frankincense and incense, and also the fragrant substances used in the anointing oil, were representative of spiritual and celestial things, n. 4748; and that the spheres of faith and love are turned into grateful odors, and therefore grateful and sweet-scented and also spicy odors signify truths of faith which are from the good of love, n. 1514, 1517-1519, 4628.) </p>

 <p>Terebinth <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_137"><font size="1">5622-1</font></a> nuts and almonds. That this signifies goods of life corresponding to these truths, is evident from the signification of "terebinth nuts," as being goods of life corresponding to the truths of good of the exterior natural which are signified by "resin" (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "almonds," as being goods of life corresponding to the truths of good of the interior natural which are signified by "aromatic wax and stacte." That these "nuts" have this signification is because they are fruits, and "fruits" in the Word signify works; the fruits of useful trees good works, or what is the same, goods of the life, for in respect to use the goods of life are good works. That "terebinth nuts" signify goods of life corresponding to truths of good of the exterior natural, is because they are of a less noble tree; and things that are exterior are signified by such objects as are less noble. The reason is, that in themselves exterior things are grosser than interior; for they are generals composed of very many interior things. [2] That "almonds" signify goods of life corresponding to the truths of good of the interior natural, is because the almond is a nobler tree. This tree itself signifies in the spiritual sense a perception of interior truth which is from good, its "blossom" interior truth which is from good, and its "fruit" good of life thence derived. In this sense the "almond tree" is spoken of in Jeremiah: 	The word of Jehovah came to pass, saying, Jeremiah what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree. Then said Jehovah unto me, Thou hast well seen; for I wake over My word to do it (Jer. 1:11-12); a "rod" denotes power; "almond tree," the perception of interior truth; here, being predicated of Jehovah, it denotes waking over it; "word" denotes truth. [3] By the "almonds which budded from the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi," are also signified goods of charity or goods of life, of which we read in Moses: 	It came to pass on the morrow, when Moses entered into the tent of meeting, behold the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi had blossomed and brought forth blossom, so that the flower flowered, and bare almonds (Num. 17:8). This was a sign that this tribe was chosen for the priesthood; for by the "the tribe of Levi" was signified charity (see n. 3875, 3877, 4497, 4502, 4503), which is the essential of the spiritual church. </p>
 
 
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5623.">5623.</a></font></span>
 <p>And take double silver in your hands. That this signifies truth received in the abilities, is evident from the signification of "silver," as being truth (see n. 1551, 2954); and from the signification of "double," as being again in succession (see n. 1335), namely truth which was gratuitously bestowed on them, and which was to be bestowed on them again; and from the signification of "hands," as being abilities (n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937, 5327, 5328). Truth in the abilities means in the capacities for receiving it, thus according to the capacities. But the capacities or abilities for receiving truth are wholly according to good, because the Lord adjoins them to good; for when the Lord flows in with good He also flows in with capacity. Hence truth received in the abilities means according to goods. That the capacities for receiving truth are according to good is evident from much experience in the other life. They who are in good there have the capacity not only for perceiving truth, but also for receiving it, yet according to the amount and quality of the good in which they are. But they who are in evil have on the other hand no capacity for receiving truth. This comes from pleasure and consequent desire. They who are in good have pleasure in perfecting good by means of truth, because good takes its quality from truths; and therefore they desire truths. But they who are in evil have pleasure in evil, and in confirming it by falsities, and therefore they desire falsities; and because they desire falsities they are averse to truths. For this reason they have no capacity for receiving truths, for they reject or stifle or pervert them as soon as they reach the ear or occur to the thought. Besides, every man who is of sound mind has a capacity for receiving truths; but they extinguish this capacity who turn to evil, and they exalt it who turn to good. </p>

 <p>And the silver that was returned in the mouth of your bags carry back in your hand. That this signifies that by means of the truth given gratuitously in the exterior natural they were to submit themselves as far as possible, is evident from the signification of the "silver returned," as being truth given gratuitously (see n. 5530); from the signification of "in the mouth of their bags," as being in the threshold of the exterior natural (see n. 5497); and from the signification of "in the hand," as being in the ability (of which just above, see n. 5623), thus as far as possible. Their submitting themselves by means of this truth is signified by their "carrying it back;" for in the spiritual world to carry back truth to the Lord, from whom it has been received gratuitously, is to submit one's self by means of it. But the manner in which they submitted themselves by its means is plain from the conversation with the man who was over Joseph's house (verses 18-24). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5625.">5625.</a></font></span>
 <p>Peradventure it was an error. That this signifies lest he be adverse, is evident from the signification of an "error," as being what is adverse, for the error here meant is as if they had forgotten to pay the silver and so were taking it back, everyone in his own sack; for which reason he might possibly be adverse to them, as they also believed; for they were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house, and said, "Upon the word of the silver that was returned in our bags in the beginning are we brought, to roll down upon us, and to throw himself upon us, and to take us for servants, and our asses" (verse 18). Moreover "sin" signifies disjunction and aversion (n. 5229, 5474); and so does "error" if there is sin in it, but in a less degree; wherefore it is said "lest he be adverse." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5626.">5626.</a></font></span>
 <p>And take your brother. That this signifies that in this way they would have the good of faith, is evident from the representation of Simeon, who is here the "brother" whom they were to take, as being faith in the will (n. 3869-3872, 4497, 4502, 4503, 5482), thus the good of faith, because when the truth of faith passes into the will it becomes the good of faith; for the truth then passes into the man's life, and when it is there it is regarded not as something to be known, but as something to be done; consequently it changes its essence and becomes actual. Hence it is no longer called truth, but good. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5627.">5627.</a></font></span>
 <p>And arise, return unto the man. That this signifies life from spiritual truth, is evident from the signification of "arising," as being elevation to things interior, consequently to spiritual things (see n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171, 4103, 4881); from the signification of "returning," as being the consequent life (of which above, n. 5614); and from the representation of Joseph, when called "the man," as being spiritual truth (n. 5584). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5628.">5628.</a></font></span>
 <p>And God Shaddai. That this signifies consolation after hardships, is evident from the signification of "Shaddai," as being temptation and consolation after it (n. 1992, 4572); here therefore consolation after the hardships they had suffered in Egypt. That it is consolation after hardships is plain also from the words that follow in continuance-"give you mercies before the man." That "Shaddai" signifies temptation and consolation after it, is because the ancients designated the One Only God by various names, according to the various things that were from Him; and as they believed that temptations were from Him, they then called God "Shaddai," and by this name they did not mean another God, but the Only One in respect to temptations. But when the Ancient Church declined, they began to worship as many gods as there were names for the One Only God, and also of themselves added to them many more. This practice at last became so prevalent that every family had its own god, and they wholly distinguished him from the rest who were worshiped by other families.  [2] Terah's family, of which was Abraham, worshiped Shaddai for its god (see n. 1356, 1992, 2559, 3667); and hence not only Abraham, but Jacob also, acknowledged Shaddai as his god, even in the land of Canaan; and this was permitted them lest they should be forced from their own religiosity; for no one is forced from what he regards as holy. But as the ancients understood by "Shaddai" Jehovah Himself, or the Lord, who was so styled when they underwent temptations, therefore Jehovah or the Lord regained this name with Abraham, as is plain from Gen. 17:1, and also with Jacob, Gen. 35:11. The reason why not merely temptation, but consolation also, is signified by "Shaddai," is that consolation follows all spiritual temptations. This has been given me to know by experience in the other life; for when anyone there suffers hard things from evil spirits, through infestations, incitements to evils, and persuasions to falsities, after the evil spirits have been removed, he is received by angels, and is brought into a state of comfort by means of a delight conformable to his genius. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5629.">5629.</a></font></span>
 <p>Give you mercies before the man. That this signifies, may spiritual truth receive you graciously, is evident from the signification of "giving mercies," as being to receive graciously; and from the representation of Joseph, as being when called "the man," spiritual truth (as above, n. 5627). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5630.">5630.</a></font></span>
 <p>And send you your other brother. That this signifies, may it give the good of faith, is evident from the representation of Simeon, who is here the "other brother," as being the good of faith (as above, n. 5626). That "sending" denotes to give is because "sending" is used in reference to the person, and "giving" in reference to the thing signified by the person. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5631.">5631.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Benjamin. That this signifies, and also interior truth, is evident from the representation of Benjamin, as being interior truth (of which above, n. 5600). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5632.">5632.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I, as I had been bereaved, I shall be bereaved. That this signifies that before these things are done the church will be deprived of its truths, is evident from the representation of Israel, who says this of himself, as being the church (see n. 3305, 4286); and from the signification of "being bereaved" as being to be deprived of the truths of the church (see n. 5536). That this is so before these things are done is plain, for if there is no good of faith which is represented by Simeon (n. 5630), and no interior truth, which is the intermediate represented by Benjamin, the church has not any truth, except such as is on the lips merely, and not in the heart. </p>

 <p>Verses 15-17. And the men took this present, and they took double silver in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. And Joseph saw Benjamin with them, and he said to him that was over his house, Bring the men to the house, and slaying slay, and make ready; for the men shall eat with me at noon. And the man did as Joseph said; and the man brought the men to Joseph's house. "And the men took this present," signifies that truths had with them the means for obtaining favor; "and they took double silver in their hand," signifies also truth received in the ability; "and Benjamin," signifies and the intermediate also; "and rose up and went down to Egypt," signifies elevation to life to be gained by them from the interior things of memory-knowledges; "and stood before Joseph," signifies the presence of the celestial of the spiritual there; "and Joseph saw Benjamin with them," signifies the perception by the celestial of the spiritual of a spiritual intermediate with truths; "and he said to him that was over his house," signifies to that which is of the external church; "Bring the men to the house," signifies that the truths in the natural were to be introduced thither; "and slaying slay and make ready," signifies through the goods of the exterior natural; "for the men shall eat with me at noon," signifies that they will be conjoined when with the intermediate; "and the man did as Joseph said," signifies bringing it about; "and the man brought the men to Joseph's house," signifies first introduction into the good which is from the celestial of the spiritual. </p>

 <p>And the men took this present. That this signifies that truths had with them the means for obtaining favor, is evident from the signification of "men," as being truths (n. 3134); and from the signification of a "present," which was given on approaching kings and priests, as being something to obtain favor (n. 5619). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5635.">5635.</a></font></span>
 <p>And they took double silver in their hand. That this signifies also truth received in the ability, is evident from what was said above (n. 5623), where the same words occur. It may also be seen there what is meant by truth received in the ability. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5636.">5636.</a></font></span>

 <p>And rose up, and went down to Egypt. That this signifies elevation to life to be gained by them from the interior things of memory-knowledges is evident from the signification of "rising up," as being elevation to the things of spiritual life (see n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171, 4103, 4881); and from the signification of "going down," as being to life to be gained by them, for "going down" here involves the same as was meant before by the words, "Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, and we will live, and not die" (verse 8), by which is signified spiritual life according to degrees (n. 5605); and from the signification of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledges (n. 1164-1165, 1186, 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966), here the interior things of memory-knowledges, because the celestial of the spiritual which is represented by Joseph was there; wherefore it is presently said that they "stood before Joseph." The interior things of memory-knowledges are spiritual things in the natural mind, and spiritual things are there when the memory-knowledges there are enlightened by the light of heaven, and they are so enlightened when the man has faith in the doctrinal things that are from the Word, and he has this faith when he is in the good of charity; for then truths and thereby memory-knowledges are enlightened by the good of charity as by a flame. From this they have their spiritual light. Hence it may be seen what is meant by the interior things of memory-knowledges. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5638.">5638.</a></font></span>
 <p>And stood before Joseph. That this signifies the presence of the celestial of the spiritual there, is evident from the signification of "standing before" anyone, as being presence; and from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial of the spiritual (of which often before). That the celestial of the spiritual was present in both naturals was represented by Joseph's being made lord over all Egypt. This is what is meant by the presence of the celestial of the spiritual in the interior things of memory-knowledges; for these knowledges are in the natural (see n. 5316, 5324, 5326-5328, 5333, 5337, 5373). The truths represented by Jacob's ten sons are truths in the natural. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5639.">5639.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Joseph saw Benjamin with them. That this signifies the perception by the celestial of the spiritual of a spiritual intermediate with truths, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being to understand and perceive (see n. 2150, 2807, 3764, 4567, 4723, 5400); and from the representation of Jacob's ten sons (who are meant by "with them," that is, with whom Joseph saw Benjamin), as being truths in the natural (n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512); and from the representation of Benjamin, as being the intermediate (see n. 5411, 5413, 5443). That this is here called a spiritual intermediate is because the truths represented by Jacob's ten sons were now to be conjoined with the truth from the Divine which is "Joseph," and this conjunction is not effected without an intermediate which is spiritual; and therefore when this intermediate was perceived, it immediately follows that "Joseph said to him that was over his house, Bring the men to the house, and slaying slay, and make ready; for the men shall eat with me at noon," by which is signified that they would be introduced and conjoined because with the intermediate.  [2] What the spiritual is relatively to the natural must be further told in a few words, because most of those who are in the Christian world are so ignorant of what the spiritual is that when they hear the term they hesitate, and say to themselves that no one knows what it is. In its essence with man the spiritual is the very affection of good and truth for the sake of good and truth, and not for the sake of self, and also the affection of what is just and fair for the sake of what is just and fair, and not for the sake of self. When a man feels in himself delight and pleasantness, and still more if he feels happiness and blessedness, from these affections, this is the spiritual in him, which comes not from the natural, but from the spiritual world or from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord. This then is the spiritual, which when it reigns in a man, affects and as it were tinges all that he thinks, wills, and does, and causes the thoughts and the acts of his will to partake of the spiritual, until at last these also become spiritual in him, as when he passes out of the natural into the spiritual world. In a word, the affection of charity and faith, that is, of good and truth, and the delight and pleasantness, and still more the happiness and blessedness thence derived, which are felt inwardly in man and make him a man truly Christian, are the spiritual. [3] That most men in the Christian world are ignorant of what the spiritual is, is because they make faith and not charity the essential of the church. Consequently as those few who are concerned about faith think little if at all about charity or know what it is, therefore as there is no knowledge, there is no perception of the affection which is of charity; and he who is not in the affection of charity cannot possibly know what the spiritual is. Especially is this true at the present day, when scarcely anyone has any charity, because it is the last time of the church. But be it known that in a general sense the "spiritual" means the affection both of good and of truth, and therefore heaven is called the spiritual world, and the internal sense of the Word the spiritual sense; but specifically that which is of the affection of good is called the celestial, and that which is of the affection of truth is called the spiritual. </p>

 <p>And he said to him that was over his house. That this signifies to that which is of the external church, is evident from the representation of him that was over the house, as being the external church, when he who is in the house is the internal church (see n. 1795). And as in the internal sense the thing, and not the person, is regarded (see n. 5225, 5287, 5434), therefore by "him that was over the house" is signified that which is of the external church. </p>

That this signifies that the truths in the natural mind were to be introduced thither, is evident from the signification of "Jacob's sons," as being the truths of the church in the natural (see n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512). Their being introduced there is signified by "bringing the men to the house." </p>

 <p>And slaying slay and make ready. That this signifies through the goods of the exterior natural, is evident from the signification of "slaying," as involving that which is slain-an ox, a bullock, a he-goat, or other cattle-as being the goods of the natural (that an "ox" and a "bullock" are the goods of the natural may be seen above, n. 2180, 2566, 2781, 2830); here the goods of the exterior natural, because through these they were now first introduced to conjunction; for his "bringing the men to Joseph's house" signifies the first introduction into the good which is from the celestial of the spiritual (see below n. 5645). As the "bullock" and "ox" signified the goods of the natural, everything done in regard to them also signified this good, for the one involved the other. </p>

 <p>For the men shall eat with me at noon. That this signifies that they will be conjoined when with the intermediate, is evident from the signification of "eating with," as being to be communicated, conjoined and appropriated (n. 2187, 2343, 3168, 3513, 3596, 3832). And because they were with the spiritual intermediate, which is "Benjamin" (n. 5639), it is said "at noon;" for "noon" signifies a state of light, thus the spiritual state which comes through the intermediate (n. 1458, 3708). </p>

 <p>And the man did as Joseph said. That this signifies bringing it about, is evident without explication. </p>

 <p>And the man brought the men to Joseph's house. That this signifies the first introduction into the good which is from the celestial of the spiritual, is evident from the signification of "bringing," as being introduction (as above, n. 5641); from the signification of "Jacob's sons," as being the truths of the church in the natural (see n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5428, 5512); from the signification of a "house," as being good (n. 3652, 3720, 4982), and hence also the church (n. 3720), for the church is the church from good; and from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial of the spiritual (of which often above). From this it is plain that by "the man's bringing the men to Joseph's house" is signified that the truths in the natural were to be introduced into the good which is from the celestial of the spiritual. That the first introduction is what is signified, is because they now only ate with Joseph, and did not know him. By this is signified a general conjunction, which is the first introduction; for truth from the Divine then flows in generally, and is not discerned. But when the truth which flows in is observed, there is then a second conjunction, which is signified by Joseph's manifesting himself to his brethren, as related in a subsequent chapter (Gen. 45). </p>

 <p>Verses 18-23. And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, Over the word of the silver that was returned in our bags in the beginning are we brought; to roll down upon us, and to cast himself upon us, and to take us for servants, and our asses. And they came near to the man that was over Joseph's house, and they spoke unto him at the door of the house, and said, In me, my lord, in coming down we came down in the beginning to buy food; and it came to pass when we came to the inn and we opened our bags, and behold everyone's silver in the mouth of his bag, our silver in its weight; and we have brought it back in our hand. And other silver have we brought down in our hand to buy food; we know not who put our silver in our bags. And he said, Peace be to you, fear not; your God, and the God of your father, gave you a hidden gift in your bags; your silver came to me. And he brought Simeon out unto them. "And the men were afraid," signifies a drawing back; "because they were brought to Joseph's house," signifies because the truths that belonged to the natural were to be adjoined and subjected to the internal; "and they said, Over the word of the silver that was returned in our bags in the beginning are we brought," signifies because truth in the exterior natural appears to be given gratuitously, they were therefore to be in subjection; "to roll down upon us and to cast himself upon us," signifies that on this account they were to be reduced under absolute power; "and to take us for servants and our asses," signifies until whatever is in either natural be as nothing; "and they came near to the man that was over Joseph's house," signifies the doctrinals of the church; "and they spoke unto him at the door of the house," signifies taking counsel of them about introduction; "and said, In me, my lord," signifies a testifying; "in coming down we came down in the beginning to buy food," signifies a disposition to procure good for truths; "and it came to pass when we came to the inn and we opened our bags," signifies introspection into the exterior natural; "and behold everyone's silver in the mouth of his bag," signifies that it was clearly seen that truths had been given as it were gratuitously; "our silver in its weight," signifies truths according to each one's state; "and we have brought it back in our hand," signifies that what had been given gratuitously would be in submission as far as possible; "and other silver have we brought down in our hand to buy food," signifies that there is a disposition to procure good by means of truth from another source; "we know not who put our silver in our bags," signifies non-belief, from ignorance of the source of truth in the exterior natural; "and he said, Peace be to you, fear not," signifies that it is well, let them not despair; "your God, and the God of your father," signifies the Lord's Divine Human; "gave you a hidden gift in your bags," signifies that it was from Him without any prudence of theirs; "your silver came to me," signifies that it will seem as truth procured by them; "and he brought Simeon out unto them," signifies that he adjoined will to truths. </p>

 <p>And the men were afraid. That this signifies a drawing back, is evident from the signification of "being afraid," as here being a drawing back, namely, from conjunction with the internal. Fear arises from various causes, as from danger of loss of life, of gain, honor, and reputation, also of being brought into some servitude and thus losing freedom and with it the life's delight. This is the subject treated of in what now follows; for they were afraid lest they should be adjoined to the internal, and thereby lose their own, and with it their freedom, and with freedom the life's delight, because this depends on freedom. This is the reason why by "the men were afraid" is signified a drawing back lest they should be adjoined. Here in few words it must be told in advance how the case is with this conjunction, that is, the conjunction of the external or natural man with the internal or spiritual. The external or natural man reigns from life's earliest age, and knows not that there is an internal or spiritual man. When therefore the man is being reformed and from being natural or external is beginning to become spiritual or internal, the natural at first rebels, for it is taught that the natural man is to be subjugated, that is, that all its concupiscences together with the things that confirm them are to be rooted out. Hence when the natural man is left to itself, it thinks that in this way it would utterly perish; for it knows no otherwise than that the natural is everything, and it is wholly ignorant that in the spiritual there are things immeasurable and unutterable; and when the natural man so thinks, it draws back and is not willing to be subjected to the spiritual. This is what is here meant by their "fear." </p>

 <p>Because they were brought to Joseph's house. That this signifies because the truths that belong to the natural were to be adjoined and subjected to the internal, is evident from the signification of "being brought to Joseph's house," as being to be conjoined and subjected to the internal; for by Joseph is represented the internal, because he represents truth from the Divine, or the celestial of the spiritual (see n. 5307, 5331, 5332, 5417, 5469); and by a "house" is signified man's internal as well as his external (n. 3128, 3538, 4973, 5023), here the internal, as it is called "Joseph's house;" and by "being brought" (namely, to the internal) is signified to be adjoined, and therefore to be subjected. The reason is that when the natural is adjoined to the internal, it is then subjected to it; for the command which had before belonged to the natural man, then becomes the spiritual man's; of which command, of the Lord's Divine mercy more will be said in the following pages. [2] A few words must here be added in regard to the internal sense. The internal sense of the Word is especially for those who are in the other life. When those who are there are with a man who is reading the Word, they perceive it according to the internal sense, and not according to the external; for they understand no human words, but only the sense of the words, and this not according to the man's natural thoughts, but according to their thoughts which are spiritual. Into this spiritual sense the natural sense that is with the man is at once transmuted, just as one turns the language of another into his own which is different, doing it in an instant. So is the sense of natural human thought turned into spiritual, for spiritual language or speech is proper to the angels, and natural language or speech to men. That there is so sudden a change of as it were one language into the other, is because there is a correspondence of each and all things in the natural world with those in the spiritual world.  [3] Now as the internal sense of the Word is chiefly for those who are in the spiritual world, therefore such things are here mentioned in the internal sense as are for them, and as are pleasant and delightful to them. Yet the more interior such things are, the more remote are they from the apprehension of men to whom only those things which are of the world and the body are pleasant and delightful; and when this is the case, they hold in contempt the spiritual things that belong to the internal sense, and also loathe them. Let everyone explore within himself whether the things contained in the internal sense of the verses that now follow are worthless and distasteful to him, when yet they are what the angelic societies take the greatest delight in. From this it may be plain to one who reflects what a difference there is between the delights of men and the delights of angels, and also in what things the angels vest wisdom, and in what men vest it - that the angels vest wisdom in such things as man thinks worthless and holds in aversion, and that man vests wisdom in such things as the angels care nothing about, and many in such things as the angels reject and shun. </p>

 <p>And they said, Over the word of the silver that was returned in our bags in the beginning are we brought. That this signifies that because truth in the exterior natural appears to be given gratuitously, they were therefore to be in subjection, is evident from the signification of the "silver being returned," as being truth bestowed gratuitously, (see n. 5530, 5624); from the signification of a "bag," as being the threshold of the exterior natural (n. 5497); and from the signification of "being brought," as being to be adjoined or subjected (as shown just above, n. 5648).  [2] The case herein is this. As it was perceived that the truths of memory-knowledge in the exterior natural were given gratuitously, and would therefore be enticed to conjoin themselves with the internal, and thereby be in subjection to it, they would as just said be deprived of their freedom, and thereby of all the delight of life. That this is the case, namely, that it is perceived that truths of memory-knowledge are bestowed gratuitously, and this in the natural mind whether exterior or interior, is quite unknown to man. The reason is that he is in no such perception; for he does not at all know what is bestowed on him gratuitously, still less what is stored up in the exterior natural, and what in the interior. The reason why he has not this perception is usually because worldly and earthly things are dear to him, and not celestial and spiritual things; and therefore he does not believe in any influx through heaven from the Lord, thus not at all that anything is given him; when yet all the truth that he rationally infers from memory-knowledges, and supposes to be of his own ability, is such as is given him. Still less can man perceive whether it is placed in the exterior natural or in the interior, because he is ignorant that the natural is twofold, namely the outer which draws near to the external senses, and the inner which draws back from them and turns to the rational. [3] As man knows nothing about either the one or the other, he can therefore have no perception about such things; for the knowledge of a thing must come first in order that there may be a perception of it. Yet the angelic societies know and perceive these things well and clearly, not only what is bestowed on them gratuitously, but also where it is, as may be seen from the following experience. When any spirit who is in good, and hence in ability, comes into an angelic society, he comes at the same time into all the memory-knowledge and intelligence the society has, and in which he had not been before; and he then knows no otherwise than that he had known and understood it so before, and from himself. But when he reflects, he perceives that it is gratuitously bestowed on him through that angelic society by the Lord; and he also knows from the angelic society where it is, whether in the exterior or in the interior natural. For there are angelic societies that are in the exterior natural, and there are others that are in the interior natural. Yet the natural which belongs to them is not such a natural as man has; but it is a spiritual natural, which has become spiritual by having been conjoined and subjected to the spiritual.  [4] From all this it is evident that the things here related in the internal sense take place actually so in the other life, namely, that they perceive what is given them gratuitously, as well as where it is stored up, although man at this day knows nothing of such things. But in ancient times they who were of the church knew such things, being taught them by their memory-knowledges and by their doctrinals. They were interior men; but since those times men have become successively more external, insomuch that at this day they are in the body, thus in the outermost. A sign of this is that they do not even know what the spiritual and the internal are, nor believe in their existence. Nay, to such an outermost in the body have they gone away from interior things, that they do not even believe that there is a life after death, nor that there is a heaven or a hell. Nay, by receding from interior things they have gone to such an outermost, and have become so stupid in spiritual things, as to believe that man's life is like that of beasts, and therefore that man will die in like manner; and strange to say the learned believe so more than the simple, and anyone who believes differently is accounted by them a simpleton. </p>

 <p>To roll down upon us and to cast himself upon us. That this signifies that on this account they were to be reduced under absolute power, is evident from the signification of "rolling down upon" anyone, as being to present him as culpable; and from the signification of "casting one's self upon" anyone, as being to reduce him under power, here absolute power, for it follows "and to take us for servants, and our asses." The case herein is that before the natural man is conjoined with the spiritual, or the external with the internal, he is left to think whether he desires to get rid of the concupiscences arising from the love of self and of the world, together with the things by which he has defended them, and to yield the command to the spiritual or internal man. He is left to think this in order that he may be free to choose what he will. When the natural man apart from the spiritual thinks about this, he rejects it; for he loves his concupiscences because he loves himself and the world. Hence he becomes anxious, and supposes that if these were got rid of he would have no life left, for he vests everything in the natural or external man; or supposes that afterward he could do nothing of himself, and all that he would think, will, and do, would flow in through heaven, thus that he would not be his own master any longer. When the natural man on being left to himself is in this state, he draws back and resists. But when some light flows into his natural through heaven from the Lord, he begins to thinks differently, namely, that it is better for the spiritual man to have the supremacy, because thereby he can think and will what is good, and so can come into heaven, but not if the natural man were to rule. And when he reflects that all the angels in the universal heaven are of this character, and that they are consequently in unspeakable joy, he then fights with the natural man, and at last desires it to be subordinated to the spiritual man. In this state is the man placed who is to be regenerated, in order that he may be in freedom to turn whither he will; and so far as he turns to this in freedom, so far he is being regenerated. All this is treated of here in the internal sense. </p>
