 <p>That were with him in the custody of his lord's house. That this signifies which were rejected, is evident from the signification of "being given into custody," thus of "being in custody," as being to be in a state of rejection (of which also above, n. 5083). </p>

 <p>Saying, Wherefore are your faces evil today? That this signifies from what affection was this sadness, is evident from the signification of "faces," as being the interiors (see n. 358, 1999, 2434, 3527, 4066, 4796, 4797), thus the affections. For the interiors of man from which come the thoughts which are also interiors, are the affections; because as these are of his love, they are of his life. It is known that with those who are in innocence the affections are presented visibly in the face; and as the affections are so presented, so also are the thoughts in general, for these are the forms of the affections. Hence regarded in itself the face is nothing else than a representative image of the interiors. To the angels all faces appear thus, and not otherwise; for the angels do not see the faces of men in their material form, but in their spiritual form, that is, in the form which the affections and the derivative thoughts present. These are what make the very face of man, as may be known from the fact that when the face is deprived of them it is a mere dead thing, and that the face has life from them, and is pleasing according to them. The sadness of the affection, or "from what affection is it," is signified by his saying, "Wherefore are your faces evil today?" </p>

 <p>And they said unto him. That this signifies perception concerning these things, is evident from the signification of "saying" in the historic parts of the Word, as being perception (of which frequently above). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5104.">5104.</a></font></span>
 <p>We have dreamed a dream. That this signifies prediction, is evident from the signification of a "dream," as being foresight, and hence prediction (of which also above n. 5091). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5105.">5105.</a></font></span>
 <p>And there is no interpreter of it. That this signifies that no one knows what is in them, is evident from the signification of an "interpretation," as being an unfolding of what there is within (see n. 5093), thus of what is in them. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5106.">5106.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Joseph said unto them. That this signifies the celestial of the natural, is evident from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial of the natural (as above, n. 5086). </p>

 <p>Do not interpretations belong to God? That this signifies that the Divine is in these things, is evident from the signification of an "interpretation," when predicated of dreams, as being that which is in them (as just above, n. 5105). The Divine is signified by "God." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5108.">5108.</a></font></span>
 <p>Tell it me, I pray. That this signifies that it should be known, is evident from the signification of "tell it, I pray," as involving that it be known; as is plain from the following verses. </p>

 <p>Verses 9-13. And the prince of the butlers told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream behold a vine was before me; and in the vine were three shoots, and it was as though it budded, its blossom went up, and the clusters thereof ripened grapes. And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup upon the palm of Pharaoh. And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it; The three shoots three days are these. In yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and shall bring thee back upon thy station, and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. "And the prince of the butlers told his dream to Joseph," signifies that the celestial of the spiritual perceived the event concerning those things which were of the sensuous subject to the intellectual part, and which had hitherto been rejected; "and said to him," signifies revelation from perception; "In my dream," signifies prediction; "behold a vine was before me," signifies the intellectual part; "and in the vine were three shoots," signifies the derivations thence even to the last; "and it was as though it budded," signifies the influx by which the rebirth is effected; "its blossom went up," signifies the state near regeneration; "and the clusters thereof ripened grapes," signifies conjunction of spiritual truth with celestial good; "and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand," signifies the influx of the interior natural into the exterior, and the beginning of reception; "and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup," signifies reciprocal influx into the goods from a spiritual origin there; "and I gave the cup upon the palm of Pharaoh," signifies appropriation by the interior natural; "and Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it," signifies revelation from perception from the celestial in the natural as to what it had in itself; "the three shoots three days are these," signifies continuous derivations down to the last one; "in yet three days," signifies that there would then be a new state; "shall Pharaoh lift up thy head," signifies what is provided, and hence what is concluded; "and shall bring thee back upon thy station," signifies that the things which are of the sensuous subject to the intellectual part would be reduced into order, that they might be in the last place; "and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand," signifies that thereby they may serve the interior natural; "after the former manner," signifies in accordance with the law of order; "when thou wast his butler," signifies as is usual with sensuous things of this kind. </p>

 <p>And the prince of the butlers told his dream to Joseph. That this signifies that the celestial of the spiritual perceived the event concerning the things of the sensuous subject to the intellectual part and which had hitherto been rejected, is evident from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial of the spiritual (n. 4286, 4585, 4592, 4594, 4963); and from the signification of a "dream," as being foresight and hence the event (of which above, n. 5091, 5092, 5104), thus the event that was foreseen or perceived; and from the signification of the "prince of the butlers," as being the sensuous subject to the intellectual part in general (n. 5077, 5082). That it was rejected is meant by his being in custody (n. 5083, 5101). From these things it is plain that such is the internal sense of these words. Moreover that Joseph, by whom is represented the celestial of the spiritual, perceived the event, is evident from the verses that follow. [2] It is said, "the celestial of the spiritual," and thereby is meant the Lord; the same may also be said abstractedly of Him, because He is the celestial itself and the spiritual itself, that is, good itself and truth itself. As regards man, these cannot indeed be conceived of abstractedly from person, because what is natural is adjoined to everything of his thought; nevertheless, when we consider that everything in the Lord is Divine, and that the Divine is above all thought, and altogether incomprehensible even to the angels, consequently if we then abstract that which is comprehensible, there remains being and coming-forth itself, which is the celestial itself and the spiritual itself, that is, good itself and truth itself. [3] Nevertheless, as man is such that he can have no idea of thought whatever about abstract things unless he adjoins something natural which has entered from the world through the senses (for without some such natural thing his thought perishes as in an abyss and is dissipated), therefore lest what is Divine should perish in man when he is wholly immersed in bodily and earthly things, and with whomsoever it remained it should be defiled by an unclean idea, and together with what is Divine everything celestial and spiritual thence derived should also perish, it pleased Jehovah to present Himself such as He actually is, and such as He appears in heaven, namely, as a Divine Man. For everything of heaven conspires to the human form, as may be seen from what has been shown at the end of the chapters concerning the correspondence of all things of man with the Grand Man, which is heaven. This Divine, or this of Jehovah in heaven, is the Lord from eternity. The same the Lord took also upon Him when He glorified or made Divine the human in Himself, as is very evident from the form in which He appeared before Peter, James, and John, when He was transfigured (Matt. 17:1, 2); and also in which He at times appeared to the prophets. It is from this that everyone is able to think of the Divine Itself as of a Man, and at the same time of the Lord, in whom is all the Divine, and a perfect Trinity, for in the Lord the Divine Itself is the Father, this Divine in heaven is the Son, and the Divine thence proceeding is the Holy Spirit. That these are a one, as He Himself teaches, is hence manifest. </p>

 <p>And said to him. That this signifies revelation from perception, is evident from the signification of "saying" in the historic parts of the Word, as being perception (n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862, 3395, 3509), thus also revelation, for this is internal perception, and is from perception. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5112.">5112.</a></font></span>
 <p>In my dream. That this signifies prediction, is evident from the signification of a "dream," as being foresight and prediction therefrom (of which above, n. 5091, 5092, 5104). </p>

 <p>Behold, a vine was before me. That this signifies the intellectual part, is evident from the signification of a "vine," as being the intellectual part in the spiritual church, of which hereafter. As by the "butler" is signified the sensuous subject to the intellectual part, and as the influx of the intellectual into the sensuous subordinate thereto is here treated of, therefore in the dream there appeared a vine with shoots, blossom, clusters, and grapes, by which is described influx and the rebirth of this sensuous. As regards the intellectual of the spiritual church, be it known that where this church is described in the Word, its intellectual part is everywhere treated of, for the reason that it is the intellectual part which in the man of this church is regenerated and becomes a church.  [2] For there are in general two churches, the celestial and the spiritual. The celestial church is with the man who can be regenerated or become a church as to the will part; and the spiritual church is with the man who, as just said, can be regenerated only as to the intellectual part. The Most Ancient Church, which was before the flood, was celestial, because with those who belonged to it there was some wholeness in the will part; but the Ancient Church, which was after the flood, was spiritual, because with those who belonged to it there was not anything whole in the will part, but only in the intellectual part. For this reason where the spiritual church is treated of in the Word, its intellectual part is chiefly treated of (on which subject see above, n. 640, 641, 765, 863, 875, 895, 927, 928, 1023, 1043, 1044, 1555, 2124, 2256, 2669, 4328, 4493). That with those who are of the spiritual church it is the intellectual part that is regenerated, may be seen also from the fact that the man of this church has no perception of truth from good, as had they who were of the celestial church; but must first learn the truth which is of faith, and become imbued with what is intellectual, and thus from truth learn what is good; and after he has thus learned it, he is able to think it, and then to will it, and at last to do it; and then a new will is formed in him by the Lord in the intellectual part. By this new will the spiritual man is elevated by the Lord into heaven, evil still remaining in the will that is proper to him; which will is then miraculously separated, and this by a higher force, whereby he is withheld from evil and kept in good. [3] But the man of the celestial church was regenerated as to the will part, by being imbued from infancy with the good of charity; and when he had attained to a perception of this, he was led into the perception of love to the Lord, whereby all the truths of faith appeared to him in the intellect as in a mirror. The understanding and the will made in him a mind wholly one; for by the things in the understanding it was perceived what was in the will. In this consisted the wholeness of that first "man" by whom the celestial church is signified.  [4] That a "vine" is the intellectual part of the spiritual church is evident from many other passages in the Word; as in Jeremiah: 	What hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor? Or what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river? And yet I had planted thee a wholly noble vine, a seed of truth; how then art thou turned to Me into the degenerate shoots of a strange vine? (Jer. 2:18, 21); speaking of Israel, by whom is signified the spiritual church (n. 3654, 4286). "Egypt" and "the waters of Shihor" denote memory-knowledges which pervert (n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462); "Assyria" and "the waters of the river" denote reasoning from these knowledges against the good of life and the truth of faith (n. 119, 1186); a "noble vine" denotes the man of the spiritual church, who is called a "vine" from the intellectual part; the "degenerate shoots of a strange vine" denote the man of the perverted church. [5] In Ezekiel: 	A riddle and a parable concerning the house of Israel. A great eagle took of the seed of the land, and placed it in a field of sowing; it budded and became a luxuriant vine of low stature, so that its shoots looked back toward her, and the roots thereof were under her; so it became a vine that made shoots, and sent forth sprigs to the eagle. This vine applied its roots, and sent its shoots toward her, in a good field by many waters. It was planted that it might make a branch, that it might be for a vine of magnificence (Ezek. 17:2-3, 5-8); the "eagle" denotes the rational (n. 3901); the "seed of the land" denotes the truth of the church (n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 1940, 2848, 3038, 3310, 3373); its "becoming a luxuriant vine" and a "vine of magnificence" denotes becoming a spiritual church, which is called a "vine" from the wine thence produced, which signifies spiritual good or the good of charity from whence comes the truth of faith, implanted in the intellectual part. [6] In the same: 	Thy mother was like a vine, in thy likeness, planted by the waters; a fruitful one, and made full of branches by reason of many waters; whence she had rods of strength for the scepter of them that bear rule; and its stature lifted itself above among the tangled boughs, and appeared in its height in the multitude of shoots (Ezek. 19:10-11); also said of Israel, by whom is signified the spiritual church, which is compared to a "vine" for a reason like that mentioned just above. In this passage are described its derivations in the natural man even to the last, namely, to memory-knowledges from the senses, which are the "tangled boughs" (n. 2831). [7] In Hosea: 	I will be as the dew to Israel; his branches shall go, and his honor shall be as the olive's, and his odor as Lebanon's. They that dwell in his shadow shall return; they shall vivify the corn, and blossom as the vine; his memory shall be as the wine of Lebanon. O Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols? (Hos. 14:5-8); "Israel" denotes the spiritual church, whose blossoming is compared to a "vine," and its memory to the "wine of Lebanon," from the good of faith implanted in the intellectual part; "Ephraim" is the intellectual part in the spiritual church (n. 3969). [8] In Zechariah: 	The remains of the people; the seed of peace; the vine shall give her fruit, and the earth shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew (Zech. 8:11-12); the "remains of the people" denote truths stored up by the Lord in the interior man (see n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 660, 798, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284); the "seed of peace" denotes good there; the "vine," the intellectual part. [9] In Malachi: 	I will rebuke for you him that consumeth, that he corrupt not for you the fruit of the land; neither shall the vine be bereaved for you in the field (Mal. 3:11);  the "vine" denotes the intellectual part; the vine is said "not to be bereaved" when the intellectual part is not deprived of the truths and goods of faith; on the other hand it is said to be "empty" when there are falsities therein and consequent evils; as in Hosea: 	Israel is an empty vine, he maketh fruit like himself (Hos. 10:1). [10] In Moses: 	He shall bind his ass's colt unto the vine, and the son of his ass unto the choice vine, after he hath washed his clothing in wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes (Gen. 49:11); from the prophecy of Jacob, then Israel, about his twelve sons, here about Judah, by whom is represented the Lord (n. 3881). The "vine" here denotes the intellectual part in the spiritual church, and the "choice vine," the intellectual part in the celestial church. [11] In David: 	Jehovah, Thou hast made to come forth a vine out of Egypt; Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it. Thou didst cleanse before it, and didst cause its roots to be rooted so that it filled the land. The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, and the cedars of God with the boughs. Thou hast sent forth the shoots thereof even to the sea, and the little branches thereof to the Euphrates. The boar out of the forest trampleth it, and the wild beast of the field grazeth it down (Ps. 80:8-11, 13); the "vine out of Egypt" in the supreme sense denotes the Lord, the glorification of His Human being described by it and its shoots. In the internal sense the "vine" here is the spiritual church, and also the man of this church, such as he is when made new or regenerated by the Lord as to the intellectual and will parts. The "boar in the forest" is the falsity, and the "wild beast of the fields" the evil, which destroy the church as to faith in the Lord. [12] In Revelation: 	The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and vintaged the vine of the earth; and cast it into the great winepress of the anger of God; the winepress was trodden outside the city, and there came forth blood out of the winepress even to the horses' bridles (Rev. 14:19-20); "to vintage the vine of the earth" denotes to destroy the intellectual part in the church; and because this is signified by the "vine," it is also said that "there came forth blood out of the winepress even to the horses' bridles;" for by "horses" are signified intellectual things (n. 2761, 2762, 3217). In Isaiah: 	It shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines for a thousand of silver, shall be for briars and brambles (Isa. 7:23). Again: 	The inhabitants of the earth shall be burned, and man shall be left rare; the new wine shall mourn, the vine shall languish (Isa. 24:6-7). Again: 	They shall beat themselves upon the paps for the fields of unmixed wine, for the fruitful vine. Upon the land of My people come up thorn and briar (Isa. 32:12-13). In these passages the subject treated of is the vastation of the spiritual church as to the good and truth of faith, thus as to the intellectual part; for as before said the truth and good of faith are in the intellectual part of the man of this church. Everyone can see that by a "vine" here is not meant a vine, nor by the "earth" the earth; but that they mean something of the church. [13] As in the genuine sense a "vine" signifies the good of the intellectual part; and a "fig tree" the good of the natural man, or what is the same, that a "vine" signifies the good of the interior man, and a "fig tree" the good of the exterior man, therefore a "fig tree" is often mentioned in the Word at the same time as a "vine"; as in the following passages:      Consuming I will consume them; no grapes on the vine nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf is fallen (Jer. 8:13).      I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, which shall eat up thy vine and thy fig tree (Jer. 5:15, 17). In Hosea:      I will lay waste her vine and her fig tree (Hos. 2:12). In Joel:      A nation is come up upon My land, it hath reduced My vine into a waste, and My fig tree into froth, stripping it hath stripped it, and cast it forth, the shoots thereof are made white; the vine is withered, and the fig tree languisheth (Joel 1:6-7, 12).      Be not afraid, ye beasts of My fields; for the dwelling places of the wilderness are become grassy; because the tree hath made its fruit, and the fig tree and the vine shall yield their strength (Joel 2:22). In David:      He smote their vine and their fig tree, and brake the tree of their border (Ps. 105:33). In Habakkuk:      The fig tree shall not blossom, and no produce is in the vines (Hab. 3:17). In Micah:      Out of Zion shall go forth doctrine, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem; they shall sit everyone under his vine and under his fig tree, and none maketh afraid (Micah 4:2, 4). In Zechariah:      In that day shall ye call a man to his fellow, under the vine and under the fig tree (Zech. 3:10). In the first book of Kings:      In the time of Solomon there was peace from all the passes round about; and Judah and Israel dwelt in confidence, everyone under his vine and under his fig tree (1 Kings 4:24-25). That a "fig tree" is the good of the natural or exterior man, may be seen above (n. 217). [14] That a "vine" is the intellectual part made new or regenerated by good from truth and by truth from good is evident from the Lord's words to the disciples, after he had instituted the holy supper:      I say to you, I will not drink henceforth of this product of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom (Matt. 26:29); good from truth and truth from good, by which the intellectual part is made new, or man is made spiritual, are signified by the "product of the vine" and the appropriation thereof by "drinking." (That "to drink" is to appropriate, and that it is predicated of truth, may be seen above, n. 3168.) That this is not done fully except in the other life is signified by "until that day when I shall drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom." That by the "product of the vine" is not meant must or wine, but something heavenly of the Lord's kingdom is very manifest. [15] As the intellectual part in the spiritual man is made new and regenerated by truth which is from the Lord alone, therefore the Lord compares Himself to a "vine" and those who are implanted in the truth which is from Him, and consequently in Him, He compares to the "shoots" and the good therefrom to the "fruit" in John:      I am the true vine, and My Father is the vine dresser; every shoot in Me that beareth not fruit, He taketh away; but every shoot that beareth fruit, He pruneth it, that it may bear more fruit. Abide in Me, and I in you. As the shoot cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in Me. I am the vine, ye are the shoots; he that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing. This is My commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you (John 15:1-2, 4-5, 12). [16] As in the supreme sense a "vine" signifies the Lord as to Divine truth, and hence in the internal sense the man of the spiritual church, therefore a "vineyard" signifies the spiritual church itself (n. 1069, 3220). As the Nazirite represented the celestial man, who is regenerated through the good of love, and not through the truth of faith like the spiritual man, and who consequently is not regenerated as to the intellectual part, but as to the will part (as may be seen above), therefore the Nazirite was forbidden to eat anything which came forth from the vine, thus was not to drink wine (Num. 6:3, 4; Judges 13:14); from this also it is evident that by the "vine" is signified the intellectual part that belongs to the spiritual man, as already shown. [17] (That the Nazirite represented the celestial man may be seen above, n. 3301.) Hence also it may be seen that it cannot possibly be known why the Nazirite was forbidden whatever came forth from the vine (not to mention many other things regarding him), unless it is known what the "vine" signifies in its own sense, and also unless it is known that there is a celestial church and a spiritual church, and that the man of the celestial church is regenerated in a manner different from the man of the spiritual church-the former by means of seed implanted in the will part, the latter by means of seed implanted in the intellectual part. Such are the arcana stored up in the internal sense of the Word. </p>

 <p>And in the vine were three shoots. That this signifies the derivations thence even to the last, is evident from the signification of the "vine," as being the intellectual part (of which just above, n. 5113); and from the signification of "three," as being what is complete and continuous even to the end (n. 2788, 4495); and from the signification of "shoots," as being derivations. For as the "vine" is the intellectual part, the "shoots" are nothing else than derivations thence; and as "three" signifies what is continuous even to the end, or from the first even to the last, by "three shoots" are signified the derivations from the intellectual part down to the last, which is the sensuous; for the first in order is the intellectual part, and the last is the sensuous. The intellectual part in general is the sight of the internal man, which sees from the light of heaven, which is from the Lord, and all that it sees is spiritual and celestial. But the sensuous in general is of the external man, here the sensuous of the sight, because this corresponds and is subordinate to the intellectual; this sensuous sees from the light of the world, which is from the sun, and all that it sees is worldly, bodily, and earthly. [2] There are in man derivations from the intellectual part, which is in the light of heaven, down to the sensuous, which is in the light of the world; unless this were so, the sensuous could not have any human life. The sensuous of man has no life in consequence of seeing from the light of the world, for the light of the world has no life in it; but in consequence of seeing from the light of heaven, for this light has life in it. When this light falls with man into those things which are from the light of the world, it vivifies them and causes him to see objects intellectually, thus as a man; and from this, by knowledges born from things he has seen and heard in the world, thus from things that have entered through the senses, man has intelligence and wisdom, and from these has civil, moral, and spiritual life.  [3] As regards the derivations specially, in man they are of such a nature that they cannot be briefly set forth. They are steps or degrees as of a ladder between the intellectual part and the sensuous, but no one can apprehend these degrees unless he knows that they are most distinct from one another, so distinct that the interior can exist and subsist without the exterior, but not the exterior without the interior. For example: the spirit of man can subsist without the material body, and also actually does so subsist when by death it is separated from the body. The spirit of man is in an interior degree, and the body is in an exterior degree. It is similar with the spirit of man after death: if he is among the blessed, he is in the last degree among them when in the first heaven, in an interior degree when in the second, and in the inmost when in the third; and when he is in this, he is indeed at the same time in the rest, but these are quiescent in him, almost as the bodily part in man is quiescent in sleep, but with this difference, that with the angels the interiors are then in the highest wakefulness. Therefore there are as many distinct degrees in man as there are heavens, besides the last, which is the body with its sensuous things. [4] From this it may in some measure appear how the case is with the derivations from first to last, or from the intellectual part down to the sensuous. The life of man, which is from the Lord's Divine, passes through these degrees from the inmost down to the last or ultimate degree, and in each degree it is derived from what is prior, becoming more and more general, and in the ultimate degree most general. The derivations in the lower degrees are merely compositions, or rather combinations [conformationes], of the singulars and particulars of the higher degrees in succession, together with an addition from purer nature, and then from grosser nature, of such things as may serve for containing vessels; and if these vessels are decomposed, the singulars and particulars of the interior degrees, which had been combined therein, return to the degree next higher. And as with man there is a connection with the Divine, and his inmost is of such a nature that he can receive the Divine, and not only receive it, but also make it his own by acknowledgment and affection, thus by reciprocation, he therefore can never die, because he has thus been implanted in the Divine, and is therefore in what is eternal and infinite, not merely through the influx thence, but also through the reception of it. [5] From this it may be seen how unlearnedly and inanely those think about man who compare him to the brute animals, and believe that he will not live after death any more than they-not considering that with the brute animals there is no reception, nor through acknowledgment and affection any reciprocal appropriation, of the Divine, and consequent conjunction with it; and not considering that in consequence of the state of animals being of this nature, the recipient forms of their life cannot but be dissipated; for with them the influx passes through their organic forms down into the world, and there terminates and vanishes, and never returns. </p>

 <p>And it was as though it budded. That this signifies the influx by which the rebirth is effected, is evident from the signification of "budding," or producing leaves and afterward blossoms, as being the first of rebirth. The reason why influx is signified is that when man is being reborn, spiritual life flows into him, exactly as when a tree is budding its life flows in through the heat from the sun. He who is born a man is in the Word occasionally compared to the subjects of the vegetable kingdom, especially to trees; and this because the whole vegetable kingdom, as well as the animal kingdom, represents such things as are in man, and consequently such as are in the Lord's kingdom; for man is a heaven in the least form, as is evident from what has been shown at the end of the chapters concerning the correspondence of man with the Grand Man, or heaven. Hence also the ancients called man a microcosm; and they might also have called him a little heaven had they known more about the state of heaven. (That universal nature is a theater representative of the Lord's kingdom, may be seen above, n. 2758, 3483, 4939.) [2] But it is especially the man who is being born anew, that is, who is being regenerated by the Lord, who is called a heaven; for he is then implanted in the Divine good and truth which are from the Lord, and consequently in heaven. For the man who is being reborn begins like a tree from seed (and therefore the truth which is from good is signified by "seed" in the Word); and also like a tree he produces leaves, then blossoms, and finally fruit; for he produces such things as are of intelligence, which in the Word are signified by "leaves," then such things as are of wisdom, which are signified by "blossoms," and finally such things as are of life, that is, the goods of love and charity in act, which in the Word are signified by "fruits." Such is the representative likeness between the fruit-bearing tree and the man who is being regenerated, insomuch that if anything is known about spiritual good and truth, the nature of regeneration may be learned from a tree. From this it is evident that by the "vine" in this dream is representatively described the full process of the rebirth of man as to the sensuous subject to the intellectual part; first by the three shoots, then by the budding, next by the blossoms, afterward by the ripening of the clusters into grapes, and finally by their being pressed into Pharaoh's cup and given to him. [3] Moreover the dreams which flow in through heaven from the Lord, never appear otherwise than according to representatives. He therefore who does not know what this or that thing in nature represents, and especially he who is quite unaware that anything is representative, cannot but believe that these representatives are merely comparisons, such as everyone uses in common speech. They indeed are comparisons, but such as correspond, and are therefore actually presented to view in the world of spirits, when the angels in an interior heaven are conversing about the spiritual and celestial things of the Lord's kingdom. (In regard to dreams, see above, n. 1122, 1975, 1977, 1979-1981.) </p>

 <p>Its blossom went up. That this signifies the state near regeneration, is evident from the signification of the "blossom" that buds forth from the tree before the fruit, as being the state before regeneration. As just said (n. 5115), the budding and fruiting of a tree represent the rebirth of man-its becoming green from the leaves represents the first state; the blossoming the second, which is the next before regeneration; and the fruiting the third, which is the very state of the regenerate. It is from this that "leaves" signify the things of intelligence, or the truths of faith (n. 885), for these are the first things of the rebirth or regeneration; while "blossoms" signify the things of wisdom, or the goods of faith, because these immediately precede the rebirth or regeneration; and "fruits" signify those things which are of life, or the works of charity, because these follow and constitute the very state of the regenerate. [2] That such things exist in the vegetable kingdom is owing to the influx of the spiritual world. This, however, cannot be believed by those who attribute all things to nature, and nothing to the Divine; whereas they who attribute all things to the Divine, and nothing to nature, are permitted to see not only that everything is from the Divine, but also that everything has a correspondence, and is therefore representative; and finally they are permitted to see that universal nature is a theater representative of the Lord's kingdom; thus that the Divine is in every particular of nature, insomuch that nature is a representation of the eternal and the infinite-of the eternal from propagation even to eternity, of the infinite from the multiplication of seeds to infinity. Such endeavors could never have existed in everything in the vegetable kingdom unless the Divine continually flowed in; for from influx comes endeavor, from endeavor energy, and from energy effect. [3] They who attribute all things to nature say that such things were imparted to fruits and seeds at their first creation, and that from the energy thence received they are afterward impelled of themselves to such activities; but they do not consider that subsistence is a perpetual coming into existence, or what is similar, that propagation is perpetual creation; neither do they consider that the effect is the continuation of the cause, and that when the cause ceases, the effect also ceases, and consequently that without a continual influx of the cause, every effect instantly perishes; nor do they consider that what is unconnected with a first of all things, consequently with the Divine, is instantly annihilated, because the prior must be continually in the posterior in order that the posterior may exist.  [4] If they who attribute all things to nature and little or nothing to the Divine, considered these things, they too could acknowledge that each and all things in nature represent such things as are in the spiritual world, consequently such as are in the Lord's kingdom, where the Divine of the Lord is most nearly represented. For this reason it was said that the influx is from the spiritual world; but it is meant that the influx is through the spiritual world from the Lord's Divine. The reason why natural men do not consider such things is that they are not willing to acknowledge them; for they are in earthly and bodily things, and hence in a life of the love of self and of the world, and therefore are in inverted order relatively to those things which are of the spiritual world or of heaven, and from an inverted state it is impossible to see such things; for they see the things which are below as if they were above, and the things which are above as if they were below; and therefore when in the other life such persons are seen in the light of heaven, they appear with the head downward and the feet upward.  [5] Who among them is there that sees trees and other plants in blossom, and deems that this is as it were their gladness because they are now producing fruits or seeds? They see that blossoms precede, and that they last until they have in their bosoms the beginnings of the fruit or seed, and thereby convey into these beginnings their sap; and if they knew anything about the rebirth or regeneration of man (or rather, if they desired to know), they would from this likeness see in the flowers a representative of the state of man before regeneration, namely, that man then blossoms in like manner from the good of intelligence and wisdom, that is, is in interior gladness and beauty, because he is then in the effort to implant in the life the goods of intelligence and wisdom, that is, to produce fruits. That this state is of such a nature cannot even be known, because the nature of the interior gladness and beauty which are thus represented is utterly unknown to those who are solely in the gladness of the love of the world and the delights of the love of self. This gladness and these delights cause those which are interior to appear to such persons so utterly joyless and undelightful that they hold them in aversion; and the result of this is that they reject them as trivial, or of no value, and therefore deny them, and at the same time deny that what is spiritual and celestial is anything. From this comes the insanity of the present age, which is believed to be wisdom. </p>

 <p>And the clusters thereof ripened grapes. That this signifies the conjunction of spiritual truth with celestial good, is evident from the signification of "ripening," as being the progress of rebirth or regeneration even to the conjunction of truth with good, and thus conjunction; and from the signification of "clusters," as being the truth of spiritual good; and from the signification of "grapes," as being the good of celestial truth; here both of these in that sensuous which is represented by the butler. The conjunction of these in the sensuous is similar to the ripening of clusters into grapes; for in the rebirth, or regeneration, all truth tends to conjunction with good, truth not receiving life previously to such conjunction, consequently not being made fruitful. This is represented in the fruits of trees when they are ripening. In unripe fruits, which here are the "clusters," is represented the state when truth still predominates; but in the ripe fruits, which are the "grapes," is represented the state when good has the predominance, the predominance of good being represented also in the flavor and sweetness which are perceived in ripe grapes. But concerning the conjunction of truth with good in the sensuous which is subject to the intellectual part, further particulars cannot be given, for they are secrets too deep for apprehension, and it is necessary for knowledges about the state of the celestial of the spiritual, and about this sensuous, to come first, and also about the state of the natural in which this conjunction comes into existence. [2] That "grapes" signify the good of the spiritual man, thus charity, is evident from many passages in the Word; as in Isaiah:      My well beloved had a vineyard in a horn of the son of oil; he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes (Isa. 5:1-2, 4); where a "vineyard" denotes the spiritual church; his "looking that it should bring forth grapes" denotes the goods of charity; and its "bringing forth wild grapes" the evils of hatred and revenge. [3] Again:      Thus hath said Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it (Isa. 65:8); the "new wine in the cluster" denotes truth from good in the natural. [4] In Jeremiah:      Gathering I will gather them, saith Jehovah; no grapes in the vine, nor figs in the fig tree (Jer. 8:13); there being "no grapes in the vine" denotes that there is no interior or rational good, and "no figs in the fig tree" that there is no exterior or natural good; for a "vine" is the intellectual part (as shown just above, n. 5113); and when the conjunction of truth and good is therein, a "vine" is the rational, for the rational is thence. (That a "fig tree" is the good of the natural or exterior man may be seen above, n. 217.) [5] In Hosea:      I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig tree in its beginning (Hos. 9:10); "grapes in the wilderness" denote rational good not yet made spiritual; the "first-ripe in the fig tree" denotes natural good in like manner; "Israel" denotes the ancient spiritual church in its beginning ("fathers" in this and other passages not being the sons of Jacob, but those with whom the Ancient Church was first set up). [6] In Micah:      There is no cluster to eat; my soul desired the first-ripe. The holy is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men (Micah 12:1-2); the "cluster to eat" denotes the good of charity in its beginning; "the first-ripe" the truth of faith also at that time. [7] In Amos:      Behold the days come that the ploughman shall reach the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that draweth the seed; and the mountains shall drop new wine, and all the hills shall melt. And I will bring back the captivity of My people, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and shall settle and plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; and they shall make clusters, and eat the fruit of them (Amos 9:13-14); it treats here of the setting up of a spiritual church, which is thus described-the conjunction of spiritual good with its truth by the "ploughman reaching the reaper"; and the conjunction of spiritual truth with its good by the "treader of grapes reaching him that draweth the seed"; the goods of love and charity therefrom are signified by the "mountains dropping new wine and the hills melting"; "bringing back the captivity of the people" denotes deliverance from falsities; "building the waste cities" denotes rectifying the falsified doctrinals of truth; "inhabiting them and planting vineyards" denotes cultivating those things which are of the spiritual church; "drinking the wine thereof" appropriating the truths of that church which are of charity; and "making clusters and eating the fruit of them" appropriating the goods thence derived. Everyone can see that "building cities," "planting vineyards," "drinking wine," "making clusters," and "eating the fruit of them" are merely natural things, in which there would be nothing Divine unless they contained a spiritual sense. [8] In Moses:      He hath washed his clothing in wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes (Gen. 49:11); speaking of the Lord; "wine" denotes spiritual good from the Divine love; the "blood of grapes" celestial good therefrom. [9] Again:      Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with the fat of lambs and of rams the sons of Bashan, and of he-goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and the blood of the grape thou drinkest unmixed (Deut. 32:14); speaking of the Ancient Church, whose goods of love and charity are thus described, and each expression signifies some specific good: the "blood of the grape" spiritual celestial good, the Divine in heaven proceeding from the Lord being so called. Wine is called the "blood of grapes" because both expressions signify holy truth proceeding from the Lord; but "wine" is predicated of the spiritual church, and "blood" of the celestial church, and for this reason wine was enjoined in the Holy Supper. [10] Again:      Their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah; the grapes thereof are grapes of gall, they have clusters of bitternesses (Deut. 32:32); speaking of the Jewish Church, their "vine being of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah" denotes the intellectual part beset by falsities from infernal love; "the grapes thereof grapes of gall" and "their having clusters of bitternesses" denotes that it was similar with the will part therein. For as in a good sense a "grape" signifies charity, it is predicated of the will part, but of the will part within the intellectual part; and similarly in the opposite sense, because all truth is of the understanding and all good is of the will. [11] In Revelation:      The angel said, Put forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe (Rev. 14:18); "to gather the clusters of the earth" denotes to destroy all things of charity. [12] In Matthew:      By their fruits ye shall know them. Do they gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? (Matt. 7:16). And in Luke:      Every tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns they do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush do they gather the grape (Luke 6:44). As charity toward the neighbor is treated of in these passages, it is said that they should be "known by their fruits" which are the goods of charity; the internal goods of charity being "grapes" and the external "figs." [13] The law enacted in the Jewish Church:      When thou comest into thy companion's vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes according to thy soul, to thy fill; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel (Deut. 23:24); involves that everyone associating with others who are in a different doctrine and religion may learn and accept their goods of charity, but may not become imbued with them and conjoin them with his own truths. As a "vineyard" denotes the church, it denotes where there is doctrine or religion; "grapes" are the goods of charity; and a "vessel" is the truth of the church. </p>

 <p>And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand. That this signifies the influx of the interior natural into the exterior, and the beginning of reception, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the interior natural (of which above, n. 5080, 5095); and from the representation of the butler, as being the exterior natural (n. 5077, 5082); "in my hand" meaning with him; and from the signification of a "cup," as being that which contains, and also at the same time that which is contained (of which in what follows, n. 5120). Hence, and from the series of things in the internal sense, by "Pharaoh's cup was in my hand" is signified the influx of the interior natural into the exterior, and the beginning of reception therein. What the interior natural is, and what the exterior, has been stated above, namely, that the interior natural is that which communicates with the rational and into which the rational flows, and the exterior natural is that which communicates with the senses, or through them with the world, thus into which the world flows. As regards influx, it is continuous from the Lord through the rational into the interior natural, and through this into the exterior; but that which flows in is changed and turned according to the reception. With the unregenerate, goods are there turned into evils, and truths into falsities; but with the regenerate, goods and truths are there presented as in a mirror. For the natural is like a face representative of the spiritual things of the internal man; and this face becomes representative when the exteriors correspond to the interiors. From this it may in some measure appear what is meant by the influx of the interior natural into the exterior, and by the beginning of reception therein. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5119.">5119.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup. That this signifies reciprocal influx into the goods from a spiritual origin there, is evident from the signification of "grapes," as being the goods of charity (of which just above, n. 5117), thus goods from a spiritual origin, for all the goods of genuine charity are from this source; and from the signification of "pressing into Pharaoh's cup," as being reciprocal influx. By reciprocal influx it is not meant that the exterior natural flows into the interior, because this is impossible; for exterior things cannot possibly flow into interior things; or what is the same thing, lower or posterior things into higher and prior ones; but the rational calls forth the things which are in the interior natural, and by means of this the things which are in the exterior; not that the things themselves which are therein are called forth, but that which has been concluded or as it were extracted from them. Such is the nature of reciprocal influx. It appears as if the things which are in the world flow in through the senses toward the interiors, but this is a fallacy of sense; the influx is of interiors into exteriors, and by means of this influx, perception. On these subjects I have at times conversed with spirits; and it was shown by living experience that the interior man sees and perceives in the exterior what is done outside of this, and that the sensuous has life from no other source, or that from no other source is the faculty of sense, or sensation. But this fallacy is of such a nature, and so great, that it can by no means be dispelled by the natural man, and not even by the rational unless this is able to think abstractedly from what is sensuous. These things are said in order that it may be known what reciprocal influx is. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5120.">5120.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I gave the cup upon the palm of Pharaoh. That this signifies appropriation by the interior natural, is evident from the signification of "giving the cup" (thus wine to drink), as being to appropriate (that "drinking" is the appropriation of truth may be seen above, n. 3168); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the interior natural (n. 5080, 5095, 5118). As is evident from what goes before, the subject here treated of is the regeneration of that sensuous which is subject to the intellectual part of the interior man (which sensuous is signified by the "butler"), and consequently the influx of truth and good and their reception in the exterior natural; but as these things are far removed from the apprehension of those who have not any distinct idea about the rational and the natural, or about influx, no further explication is given. [2] Moreover, a "cup" is often mentioned in the Word, and by it in the genuine sense is signified spiritual truth, that is, the truth of faith which is from the good of charity-the same as by "wine;" and in the opposite sense is signified the falsity by which comes evil, and also falsity from evil. That a "cup" signifies the same as "wine" is because a cup is what contains, and wine is what is contained, and hence they constitute one thing, and therefore the one is meant by the other. [3] That such is the signification of "cup" in the Word, is plain from the following passages: 	Jehovah, Thou wilt set in order a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; Thou wilt make fat my head with oil; my cup will run over (Ps. 23:5); "to set in order a table and anoint the head with oil" denotes being gifted with the good of charity and love; "my cup will run over" denotes that the natural is thence filled with spiritual truth and good. Again: 	What shall I render unto Jehovah? I will take the cup of salvations, and call upon the name of Jehovah (Ps. 116:12-13); "to take the cup of salvations" denotes the appropriation of the goods of faith. [4] In Mark: 	Whosoever shall give you drink in a cup of water in My name, because ye are Christ's, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward (Mark  9:41); "to give drink in a cup of water in My name" denotes instructing in the truths of faith from a little charity. [5] In Matthew: 	Presently, taking the cup, and giving thanks, He gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is My blood, that of the New Testament (Matt. 26:27-28; Mark 14:23- 24; Luke 22:20). It is said the "cup" and not the "wine," because "wine" is predicated of the spiritual church, but "blood" of the celestial church, although both of these signify holy truth proceeding from the Lord; but in the spiritual church the holy of faith from charity toward the neighbor, and in the celestial church the holy of charity from love to the Lord. The spiritual church is distinguished from the celestial in this, that the former is in charity toward the neighbor, while the latter is in love to the Lord; and the Holy Supper was instituted to represent and signify the Lord's love toward the whole human race, and the reciprocal love of man toward Him.  [6] As by "cup" was signified that which contained, and by "wine" that which was contained, consequently by "cup" man's external, and by "wine" his internal, therefore the Lord said: 	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but the inner parts are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, and the outside will also become clean (Matt. 23:25-26; Luke 11:39); by a "cup" here also is meant in the internal sense the truth of faith, to cultivate which without its good is to "cleanse the outside of the cup," especially when the interiors are full of hypocrisy, deceit, hatred, revenge, and cruelty; for then the truth of faith is only in the external man, and nothing at all of it is in the internal; and to cultivate and to become imbued with the good of faith causes truths to be conjoined with good in the interior man, in which case even fallacies are accepted as truths, as is signified by "cleansing first the inside of the cup, and the outside will also become clean." [7] Likewise in Mark: 	Many other things there are which the Pharisees and the Jews have received to hold, as the baptizings of cups, and pots, brazen vessels, and couches. Forsaking the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the baptisms of pots and cups; and many other like things ye do. Ye renounce the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition (Mark 7:4, 8-9). [8] That by "cup" is signified in the opposite sense that falsity from which is evil, and also the falsity which is from evil, is evident from the following passages: 	Thus hath said Jehovah the God of Israel unto me, Take this cup of wine of anger from My hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it. And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them. Therefore I took the cup from Jehovah's hand, and made all the nations to drink unto whom Jehovah had sent me (Jer. 25:15-17, 28); the "cup of wine of anger" denotes the falsity by which is evil. The reason why the falsity by which is evil is signified, is that as wine intoxicates and makes insane, so does falsity, spiritual intoxication being nothing else than insanity brought on by reasonings about what is to be believed, when nothing is believed that is not apprehended; hence come falsities, and from falsities evils (n. 1072); and therefore it is said that "they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send." The "sword" is falsity fighting against truth (see n. 2799, 4499). [9] In the book of Lamentations: 	Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken and shalt be uncovered (Lam. 4:21); "to be drunken from the cup," denotes to be insane from falsities, and "to be uncovered, or naked, without shame," the evil thence derived (see n. 213, 214). [10] In Ezekiel: 	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore I will give her cup into thy hand. Thus hath said the Lord Jehovih, Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup, which is deep and wide; thou shalt be for laughter and mockery, large for holding; thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of devastation and desolation, the cup of thy sister Samaria, thou shalt both drink and press out, and thou shalt pulverize the potsherds thereof (Ezek. 23:31-34); said of Jerusalem, by which is signified what is spiritual of the celestial church. "Cup" here denotes falsity from evil; and because this vastates or destroys the church, it is called the "cup of devastation and desolation." In Isaiah: 	Awake, awake, rise up, O Jerusalem, who hast drunk from the hand of Jehovah the cup of His anger; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling (Isa. 51:17). In Habakkuk: 	Drink thou also that thy foreskin be uncovered; the cup of Jehovah's right hand shall come round unto thee, that shameful vomit be upon thy glory (Hab. 2:16). In David: 	In the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and He hath mixed with wine, He hath filled with the mixture, and hath poured out therefrom; but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall suck them out, and drink them (Ps. 75:8). [11] In these passages also a "cup" denotes insanity from falsities and the evils thence derived. It is called the "cup of the anger of Jehovah," and also "of the right hand of Jehovah," for the reason that the Jewish nation, like the common people, believed evils and the punishment of evils and falsities to come from no other source than Jehovah, when yet they are from the man himself, and from the infernal crew with him. It is often stated in this way from the appearance and consequent belief; but the internal sense teaches how it should be understood, and what should be believed (as may be seen above, n. 245, 592, 696, 1093, 1683, 1874, 1875, 2335, 2447, 3605, 3607, 3614). [12] As a "cup," like "wine," signifies in the opposite sense the falsities through which come evils, and also falsities from evils, a "cup" signifies temptation also, because this takes place when falsity fights against truth, and consequently evil against good. A "cup" is used to express and describe temptation in the following passage:      Jesus prayed, saying, If Thou wilt that this cup pass from Me! nevertheless not My will, but Thine, be done (Luke 22:42; Matt. 26:39, 42, 44; Mark 14:36); the "cup" here denotes temptation. Likewise in John: 	Jesus said to Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath; the cup which My Father hath given Me, shall I not drink it? (John 18:11). 	And also in Mark: 	Jesus said to James and John, Ye know not what ye ask; can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? And they said, We can. But Jesus said to them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized with shall ye be baptized (Mark 10:38-39; Matt. 20:22-23). From this it is evident that a "cup" is temptation, because temptation arises through evils combating by means of falsities against goods and truths; for baptism signifies regeneration, and because this is effected by means of spiritual combats, therefore by "baptism" is at the same time signified temptation. [13] In the directly opposite sense a "cup" signifies falsity from evil with those who are profane, that is, who inwardly are in what is contrary to charity, and outwardly counterfeit holiness; in which sense it is used in Jeremiah: 	Babylon hath been a golden cup in Jehovah's hand, making the whole earth drunken; all nations have drunk of her wine, therefore the nations are mad (Jer. 51:7); "Babylon" denotes those who are in external sanctity, and inwardly in what is profane (n. 1182, 1326); the falsity which they veil over with sanctity is the "golden cup;" "making the whole earth drunken" denotes that they lead those who are of the church (which is meant by the "earth") into errors and insanities. The profane things which they hide under external sanctity are that they strive after nothing else than to be the greatest and wealthiest of all, and to be worshiped as gods, possessors of heaven and earth, by thus having dominion over the souls and bodies of men, and this by means of the Divine and holy things of which they make pretense. Hence as to the external man they appear like angels, but as to the internal they are devils. [14] The like is said of Babylon in Revelation 	The woman was arrayed in crimson and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and filthiness of her whoredom (Rev. 17:4). Again: Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become a habitation of demons. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her whoredom, and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her. I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Render unto her as she rendered unto you, in the cup which she mingled, mingle to her double (Rev. 18:2-4, 6). Again: 	The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; remembrance of Babylon the great was made before God, to give to her the cup of the fury of God's anger (Rev. 16:19). Again: 	The third angel said with a great voice, If anyone worship the beast and his image, he shall drink of the wine of God's anger mingled unmixed in the cup of His anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone (Rev. 14:9-10). </p>

 <p>And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it. That this signifies revelation from perception from the celestial in the natural as to what it had in itself, is evident from the signification of "saying" in the historic parts of the Word, as being perception (n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862, 3395, 3509), here revelation from perception, because said of a dream and its interpretation - all revelation being either from speech with angels through whom the Lord speaks, or from perception (of which hereafter); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial in the natural (of which above, n. 5086, 5087, 5106); and from the signification of "interpretation," as being what it had in itself (of which also above, n. 5093, 5105, 5107). From this it is plain that by "Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it" is signified revelation from perception from the celestial in the natural as to what it had in itself. [2] In regard to revelations being either from perception, or from speech with angels through whom the Lord speaks, it is to be known that they who are in good and thence in truth, and especially they who are in the good of love to the Lord, have revelation from perception; whereas they who are not in good and thence in truth, can indeed have revelations, yet not from perception, but through a living voice heard within them, and thus through angels from the Lord. This revelation is external, but the former is internal. The angels, especially the celestial, have revelation from perception, as also had the men of the Most Ancient Church, and some too of the Ancient Church, but scarcely anyone at this day; whereas very many, even those who have not been in good, have had revelations from speech without perception, and also by means of visions or dreams. [3] Such were most of the revelations of the prophets in the Jewish Church; they heard a voice, they saw a vision, and they dreamed a dream; but as they had no perception, these were merely verbal or visual revelations without any perception of what they signified. For genuine perception comes through heaven from the Lord, and affects the intellect spiritually, and leads it perceptibly to think as the thing really is, together with internal assent, the source of which it knows not. It supposes that it is in itself, and that it flows from the connection of things; whereas it is a dictate through heaven from the Lord, flowing into the interiors of the thought, about such things as are above the natural and sensuous, that is, about such things as are of the spiritual world or of heaven. From what has now been said it may be seen what revelation from perception is. But the revelation from perception which the Lord had (who is here represented by Joseph, and which revelation is here treated of in the internal sense), was from the Divine in Himself, thus was from Himself. </p>

 <p>The three shoots three days are these. That this signifies continuous derivations down to the last or ultimate one, is evident from the signification of "three," as being one period and its continuation from beginning to end (n. 2788, 4495); from the signification of "shoots," as being derivations (n. 5114); and from the signification of "days," as being states (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850). From this it follows that by "the three shoots three days are these" is signified the state of the rebirth of this sensuous which is represented by the butler, from its first down to its ultimate; its successive derivations being signified by the "shoots."  [2] The states of the rebirth of each sensuous, and of each thing in the natural, and also in the rational, have their progressions from beginning to end; and when they come to the end they commence from a kind of new beginning, that is, from the end to which they had striven in the former state, to a further end; and so on; and at last the order is inverted, and then what was last becomes first, just as while man is being regenerated both as to the rational and as to the natural, the periods of the first state are from the truths which are of faith to the goods which are of charity; and then the truths of faith apparently act the first part, and the goods of charity the second, for the truths of faith look to the good of charity as their end. These periods continue even until the man has been regenerated. Afterward charity, which was the end, becomes the beginning, and from it new states commence, which proceed in both directions, namely, toward what is still more interior, and also toward what is exterior; toward the former being toward love to the Lord, and toward the latter being toward the truths of faith, and further toward natural truths, and also toward sensuous truths, which are then successively reduced to correspondence with the goods of charity and of love in the rational, and thus into heavenly order. [3] These are the things which are meant by continuous progressions and derivations down to the ultimate one. Such progressions and derivations with the man who is being regenerated are perpetual, from his infancy even to the last hour of his life in the world, and also afterward even to eternity; and yet he can never be so regenerated that he can in any way be said to be perfect; for there are things to be regenerated that are innumerable, nay, illimitable in number, both in the rational and in the natural, and everyone of them has shoots illimitable, that is, progressions and derivations toward interior things and toward exterior things. Man knows nothing at all of this; but the Lord knows all things and every single thing, and provides for them every moment. If He were to pause even for an instant, all the progressions would be disturbed; for what is prior looks to what follows in a continuous series, and produces series of consequences to eternity. From this it is plain that the Divine foresight and providence are in everything, even the very least; and that unless this were so, or if they were only universal, the human race would perish. </p>

 <p>In yet three days. That this signifies that there would then be a new state, is evident from the signification of "three," as being what is continuous even to the end, thus what is complete (n. 2788, 4495); and from the signification of "days," as being states (of which above, n. 5122). From this it is plain that by "three days" is signified a complete state; consequently, "in three days," or "after three days," denotes a new state (n. 4091); for after a complete state a new one begins. </p>

 <p>Shall Pharaoh lift up thy head. That this signifies what is provided, and therefore what is concluded, is evident from the signification of "lifting up the head," as being to conclude, and in the supreme sense to provide; for the Divine conclusion, and execution of a thing concluded, is providence. "To lift up the head" was a customary form of passing sentence among the ancients, when the bound, or those in prison were adjudged either to life or to death; when to life, this was expressed by "lifting up the head," as in the second book of Kings: 	Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he was made king, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of the prison house, and spake good to him, and set his throne above the thrones of the kings that were with him in Babylon (2 Kings 25:27-28). So in Jeremiah: 	Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the [first] year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of the prison house (Jer. 52:31). But when they were adjudged to death, it was expressed by "lifting up the head from off him," as in what follows concerning the baker: "In yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee" (verse 19).  [2] This form of sentence had its origin among the ancients who were in representatives, from the representation of those who were bound in prison or in a pit; and as by these were represented those who were in vastation under the lower earth (n. 4728, 4744, 5038), therefore by "lifting up their head" was signified their liberation, for they are then elevated or lifted up out of vastation to the heavenly societies (n. 2699, 2701, 2704). "To be lifted up" or "to be elevated" is to advance toward the interior things; for what is elevated or high is predicated of these (n. 2148, 4210); and because it is toward interior things it is toward heaven, for heaven is in the interior things. This was signified by "lifting up the head." But by "lifting the head from off" anyone was signified to adjudge him to death, because then those who were above those in the pit, or in vastation, were elevated to heaven, while the others were let down to lower depths. Because of this signification, therefore, this form of sentence was received in the Word. It is hence plain that by "lifting up the head" is signified what is concluded; and because what is concluded is signified, in the supreme sense is signified what is provided; for what the Divine concludes, this it provides. </p>

 <p>And shall bring thee back upon thy station. That this signifies that the things which are of the sensuous subject to the intellectual part would be reduced into order, that they might be in the last place, is evident from the representation of the butler, of whom these things are said, as being the sensuous subject to the intellectual part (n. 5077, 5082), consequently the things of this sensuous in the external natural, for the sensuous itself is not reduced into order, but those things which have entered through it into man's fantasy; and from the signification of "bringing back upon the station," as being to reduce into order; and because sensuous things (that is, those which have entered from the world through the external organs of sensation) are in the last place, and are in the last place when they minister and are subservient to interior things, therefore these are at the same time signified. Moreover, with the regenerate these sensuous things are in the last place; but with the unregenerate are in the first place (n. 5077, 5081, 5084, 5089, 5094). [2] Whether sensuous things are in the first or last place can easily be perceived by man if he pays attention. If he sanctions everything to which the sensuous prompts or which it craves, and disapproves of everything that the intellectual part dictates, then sensuous things are in the first place, and the man is governed by the appetites, and is wholly sensuous. Such a man is but little removed from the condition of irrational animals, for they are governed in the same way; nay, he is in a worse condition if he abuses the intellectual or rational faculty to confirm the evils and falsities to which sensuous things prompt and which they crave. But if he does not sanction them, but from within sees how they stray into falsities and incite to evils, and strives to chasten them and thus reduce them to compliance (that is, subject them to the intellectual and will parts which are of the interior man), then sensuous things are reduced into order, that they may be in the last place. When sensuous things are in the last place, a happy and blessed feeling flows from the interior man into the delights of these things, and increases them a thousandfold. The sensuous man does not believe that this is so, because he does not comprehend it; and as he is sensible of no other delight than sensuous delight, and thinks there is no higher delight, he regards as of no account the happy and blessed feeling which is within the delights of sensuous things; for whatever is unknown to anyone is believed not to be. </p>

 <p>And thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand. That this signifies that thereby they may serve the interior natural, is evident from the signification of "giving a cup to drink," as being to appropriate (n. 5120); that it is also to serve is plain; and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the interior natural (n. 5080, 5095, 5118). That there is an interior natural and also an exterior natural, and that the exterior natural is constituted of what enters immediately through the senses from the world into the natural mind, namely, into its memory and thence into the imagination, may be seen above (n. 5118).  [2] In order that it may be known what is the exterior and what the interior natural, which are of the exterior man; and hence what is the rational, which is of the interior man, this must be briefly told. A man from his infancy even to childhood is merely sensuous, for he then receives only earthly, bodily and worldly things through the senses of the body, and from these things his ideas and thoughts are then formed - the communication with the interior man not being as yet open, or only so far that he can comprehend and retain these worldly things. The innocence which he then has is only external, and not internal; for true innocence dwells in wisdom. By external innocence the Lord reduces into order what enters through the senses; and without an influx of innocence from the Lord in that first age, there would never be any foundation upon which the intellectual or rational faculty which is proper to man, could be built.  [3] From childhood to early youth communication is opened with the interior natural by learning what is becoming, what the civil laws require, and what is honorable, both by instructions from parents and teachers and by studies. And from youth to early manhood communication is opened between the natural and the rational by learning the truths and goods of civil and moral life, and especially the truths and goods of spiritual life, through the hearing and reading of the Word; but insofar as the youth then becomes imbued with goods by means of truths, that is, insofar as he does the truths which he learns, so far the rational is opened; whereas insofar as he does not become imbued with goods by means of truths, or insofar as he does not do truths, so far the rational is not opened, and yet the knowledges still remain in the natural, namely, in its memory, and thus as it were on the threshold outside the house. [4] Insofar, however, as he then and in subsequent years disregards goods and truths, and denies and acts contrary to them, that is, instead of them believes falsities and does evils, so far the rational is closed, and also the interior natural; nevertheless of the Lord's Divine providence so much of communication still remains as to enable him to apprehend goods and truths with some degree of understanding, yet not to make them his own unless he performs serious repentance and for a long while afterward struggles with falsities and evils. With those, however, who suffer themselves to be regenerated, the contrary comes to pass; for by degrees or successively the rational is opened in them, and to this the interior natural is made subordinate, and to this the exterior natural. This takes place especially in youth up to adult age, and progressively to the last years of their life, and afterward in heaven to eternity. From all this it may be known what is the interior and what the exterior natural in man. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5127.">5127.</a></font></span>
 <p>After the former manner. That this signifies in accordance with the law of order is evident from the signification of the "former manner," as being the law of order; for it is a law of order that exterior things should be subject to interior things, or what is the same, lower things to higher ones, and should serve them as servants; for exterior or lower things are nothing but servants, while interior or higher things are relatively lords. That such is the signification of the words "after the former manner" is because the butler as a servant had previously served Pharaoh as his lord, in accordance with the law of subordination; thus the sensuous represented by the butler had served the interior natural represented by Pharaoh, in accordance with the law of order.  [2] That it is the law of order that lower or exterior things should serve higher or interior things, is wholly unknown to the sensuous man; for one who is merely sensuous does not know what interior is, thus neither what is relatively exterior. He knows that he thinks and speaks, and that he wills and acts; and from this he supposes that to think and to will are interior, and that to speak and to act are exterior; but he does not know that to think from the senses only, and to act from the appetites, is of the external man, thus that his thinking and willing are solely of the exterior natural, and that this is still more the case when he thinks falsities and wills evils; and because in such persons the communication with interior things is closed, he therefore does not know what interior thought and will are. If he is told that interior thought is to think from truth, and that interior will is to act from good, he does not at all apprehend it; still less that the interior man is distinct from the exterior, and so distinct that the interior man can see as from a higher position what is going on in the exterior man, and that the interior man has the capacity and ability of chastening the exterior, and of not willing and thinking what the exterior man sees from phantasy, and desires from cupidity.  [3] These things he does not see so long as his external man has dominion and rules; but when he is out of this state, as when he is in some depression arising from misfortunes or illness, he can see and apprehend these things, because then the dominion of the external man ceases. For the faculty or ability of understanding is always preserved to man by the Lord, but is very obscure with those who are in falsities and evils, and is always clearer in proportion as falsities and evils are lulled to sleep. The Lord's Divine flows in continually with man and enlightens him, but where there are falsities and evils (that is, where there are things contrary to truths and goods), the Divine light is either reflected or suffocated or perverted, and only so much of it is received, as it were through chinks, as to give him the faculty of thinking and speaking from sensuous things, and also of thinking and speaking of spiritual things from forms of speech impressed on the natural or bodily memory. </p>

 <p>When thou wast his butler. That this signifies as is usual with sensuous things of this kind, is evident from the signification of a "butler," as being sensuous things, or that portion of them which is subject to the intellectual part (see n. 5077, 5082); its being "as is usual" with them is signified by "when thou wast." That sensuous things ought to be subject and subordinate to rational things has already been treated of in the preceding pages; and as this subjection and subordination is here treated of in the internal sense, it still remains to show how the case is in regard to it. [2] The man in whom sensuous things are in subjection is called rational, but the man in whom they are not in subjection is called sensuous; but whether a man is rational or sensuous can scarcely be discerned by others; but it can be discerned by himself if he explores his interiors, that is, his will and his thought. Whether a man is sensuous or rational cannot be known by others from his speech or from his actions; for the life of the thought which is in the speech, and the life of the will which is in the actions, do not appear to any bodily sense. Only the sound is heard and the gesture seen together with their affection, and it is not distinguished whether the affection is pretended or real; but in the other life this is distinctly perceived by those who are in good, both as to what is in the speech and what is in the actions; thus what is the quality of the life, and also from what source the life therein is derived. In this world also there are some signs from which it can in some measure be inferred whether sensuous things are subject to the rational, or the rational to sensuous things, or what is the same, whether a man is rational or merely sensuous. The signs are these. If it is observed that a man is in principles of falsity, and does not suffer himself to be enlightened, but entirely rejects truths, and without reason obstinately defends falsities, this is a sign that he is a sensuous man, and not a rational, the rational being closed in him, so that it does not admit the light of heaven.  [3] Still more sensuous are those who are in the persuasion of falsity, because the persuasion of falsity totally closes the rational. It is one thing to be in principles of falsity, and another to be in the persuasion of falsity. They who are in the persuasion of falsity have some light in their natural, but it is a light like that of winter. In the other life this light appears with them white like snow; but as soon as the heavenly light falls into it, it is darkened, and becomes dark like night in accordance with the degree and quality of the persuasion. This is also evident with them while they live in the world, for they cannot then see anything whatever of truth; nay, in consequence of the obscure or benighted influence of their falsity, truths to them are as things of naught, and they also ridicule them. To the simple such persons sometimes appear as if they were rational; for by means of that snowy wintry light they can through reasonings so dexterously confirm falsities, that these appear like truths. In such persuasion are many of the learned, more than the rest of mankind; for they have confirmed falsities in themselves by syllogistic and philosophical reasonings, and finally by many acquired knowledges. Among the ancients such men were called serpents of the tree of knowledge (see n. 195-197); but at this day they may be called interior sensuous men who have no rational.  [4] The principal sign whether a man is merely sensuous or is rational, is from his life; not such as appears in his speech and his works, but such as it is within these; for the life of the speech is from the thought, and the life of the works is from the will, and that of both is from the intention or end. Such therefore as is the intention or end within the speech and the works, such is the life; for speech without interior life is mere sound, and works without interior life are mere movements. This is the life which is meant when it is said that "the life remains after death." If a man is rational, he speaks from thinking well, and acts from willing well, that is, he speaks from faith and acts from charity; but if a man is not rational, he may then indeed begin to act, and also to speak, as a rational man; but still there is nothing of life from the rational in him; for a life of evil closes up every way or communication with the rational, and causes the man to be merely natural and sensuous. [5] There are two things which not only close up the way of communication, but even deprive a man of the capacity of ever becoming rational - deceit and profanation. Deceit is like a subtle poison which infects the interiors, and profanation mixes falsities with truths and evils with goods: through these two the rational wholly perishes. There are in every man gods and truths from the Lord stored up from infancy, which in the Word are called "remains" (see n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 661, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284); these remains are infected by deceit, and are mixed up by profanation (what profanation is may be seen above, n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 1328, 2051, 2426, 3398, 3402, 3489, 3898, 4289, 4601). From these signs it may in some measure be known who is a rational, and who a sensuous man.  [6] When sensuous things are subject to the rational, then the sensuous things from which man's first imagination is formed, are enlightened by the light which comes through heaven from the Lord, and are also disposed into order so as to receive the light and correspond. When they are in this state, sensuous things no longer stand in the way of truths being acknowledged and seen, those which disagree being instantly removed, and those which agree being accepted. Those which agree are then as it were in the center, and those which disagree are in the circumference; those which are in the center are as it were lifted up toward heaven, and those which are in the circumference as it were hang downward. Those which are in the center receive light through the rational, and when they are presented to view in the other life they are seen as little stars which gleam and shed light round about even to the circumference, with a gradual diminution. Into such a form are natural and sensuous things disposed when the rational has dominion, and sensuous things are in subjection. This takes place while the man is being regenerated, and thereby he is in a state of seeing and acknowledging truths in their full extent. But when the rational is subject to sensuous things, the contrary comes to pass; for falsities are in the middle, or in the center, and truths are in the circumference. The things which are in the center are in a certain light, but it is a fatuous light, or such as arises from a coal fire, into which flows a light on all sides from hell. This is the light which is called darkness, for as soon as any light from heaven flows into it, it is turned into darkness. </p>

 <p>Verses 14, 15. But remember me with thee when it is well with thee, and do mercy I pray with me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. For being carried off by theft I was carried away out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the pit. "But remember me with thee," signifies the reception of faith; "when it is well with thee," signifies when there is correspondence; "and do mercy I pray with me," signifies the reception of charity; "and make mention of me unto Pharaoh," signifies communication with the interior natural; "and bring me out of this house," signifies deliverance from evils; "for being carried off by theft I was carried away," signifies that heavenly things were alienated by evil; "out of the land of the Hebrews," signifies from the church; "and here also have I done nothing," signifies innocence; "that they should put me into the pit," signifies rejection among falsities. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5130.">5130.</a></font></span>
 <p>But remember me with thee. That this signifies the reception of faith, is evident from the representation of Joseph, who says these things of himself, as being the Lord as to the celestial in the natural (see n. 5086, 5087, 5106); and from the signification of "remember me with thee," as being the reception of faith; for to remember and to be mindful of the Lord is from no other source than faith; hence "remember me with thee," denotes that he may receive faith. The case in regard to faith is this: he who receives and has faith is continually mindful of the Lord, even when he is thinking or speaking of other things, and also when he is discharging his public, private, or domestic duties, although he is not aware that he is then mindful of the Lord; for the remembrance of the Lord by those who are in faith reigns universally with them, and what reigns universally is not perceived, except while the thought is directed to it. [2] This may be illustrated by various things with man. He who is in any love, whatever it may be, is continually thinking about whatever belongs to that love; and this although he is engaged in thought, in speech, or in action relative to other things. In the other life this is very evident from the spiritual spheres about everyone; for simply from these spheres it is known in what faith and in what love are all who are there, and this even though they are thinking and speaking of something entirely different (see n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504-1520, 2489, 4464); for that which reigns universally in anyone produces a sphere of the same, and displays his life before others. From this may be seen what is meant when it is said that we must be constantly thinking about the Lord, salvation, and the life after death. All who are in faith from charity do this, and therefore they do not think ill of the neighbor, and they have justice and equity in everything of their thought, speech, and action; for that which reigns universally flows into particulars and guides and governs them, because the Lord keeps the mind in such things as are of charity and the derivative faith and thus disposes everything in conformity therewith. The sphere of faith from charity is the sphere which reigns in heaven; for the Lord flows in with love, and through love with charity, consequently with the truths which are of faith; and from this they who are in heaven are said to be in the Lord.  [3] In what now follows the subject treated of is the rebirth of the sensuous subject to the intellectual part, and which is represented by the butler; and because its rebirth is treated of, the reception of faith is also treated of. For the sensuous, like the rational, is born again by means of faith, but by the faith into which charity flows. Unless charity flows into faith and gives it life, faith cannot reign universally; for what a man loves reigns, and not what he merely knows and holds in his memory. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5131.">5131.</a></font></span>
 <p>When it is well with thee. That this signifies when there is correspondence, is evident from the signification of its "being well with thee," when the rebirth or regeneration of the exterior natural or sensuous is treated of, as being correspondence; for it is not well with it until it corresponds. At the end of the different chapters it may be seen what correspondence is. There is a correspondence of sensuous with natural things, a correspondence of natural with spiritual things, a correspondence of spiritual with celestial things, and finally a correspondence of celestial things with the Divine of the Lord; thus there is a succession of correspondences from the Divine down to the ultimate natural.  [2] But as an idea of the nature of correspondences can with difficulty be formed by those who have never thought about them before, it may be well to say a few words on the subject. It is known from philosophy that the end is the first of the cause, and that the cause is the first of the effect. That the end, the cause, and the effect may follow in order, and act as a one, it is needful that the effect should correspond to the cause, and the cause to the end. But still the end does not appear as the cause, nor the cause as the effect; for in order that the end may produce the cause, it must take to itself administrant means from the region where the cause is, by which means the end may produce the cause; and in order that the cause may produce the effect, it also must take to itself administrant means from the region where the effect is, by which means the cause may produce the effect. These administrant means are what correspond; and because they correspond, the end can be in the cause and can actuate the cause, and the cause can be in the effect and can actuate the effect; consequently the end through the cause can actuate the effect. It is otherwise when there is no correspondence; for then the end has no cause in which it may be, still less an effect in which it may be, but is changed and varied in the cause, and finally in the effect, according to the form made by the administrant means.  [3] All things in general and in particular in man, nay, all things in general and in particular in nature, succeed one another as end, cause, and effect; and when they thus correspond to one another, they act as a one; for then the end is the all in all things of the cause, and through the cause is the all in all things of the effect. As for example, when heavenly love is the end, the will the cause, and action the effect, if there is correspondence, then heavenly love flows into the will, and the will into the action, and they so act as a one that by means of the correspondence the action is as it were the love; or as when the faith of charity is the end, thought the cause, and speech the effect, then if there is correspondence, faith from charity flows into the thought, and this into the speech, and they so act as a one, that by means of the correspondence the speech is as it were the end. In order however that the end, which is love and faith, may produce the cause, which is will and thought, it must take to itself administrant means in the rational mind that will correspond; for without administrant means that correspond, the end, which is love or faith, cannot be received, however much it may flow in from the Lord through heaven. From this it is plain that the interiors and the exteriors of man, that is, what is rational, natural, and sensuous in him must be brought into correspondence, in order that he may receive the Divine influx, and consequently that he may be born again; and that it is not well with him till then. This is the reason why here by "when it is well with thee" is signified correspondence. </p>

 <p>And do mercy I pray with me. That this signifies the reception of charity, is evident from the signification of "mercy," as being love (see n. 3063, 3073, 3120, 5042); here love toward the neighbor, or charity, because the reception of faith was spoken of above (n. 5130); for faith and charity will make a one in the sensuous when this is being reborn. That "mercy" signifies charity is because all who are in charity are in mercy, or in other words all who love the neighbor are merciful to him; and therefore acts of charity are described in the Word by works of mercy; as in Matthew: 	I was hungry and ye gave Me to eat; I was thirsty and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger and ye gathered Me; naked and ye clothed Me; I was sick and ye visited Me; I was in prison and ye came unto Me (Matt. 25:35-36); and in other places by benefiting the poor, the afflicted, the widows, and the fatherless.  [2] In its essence charity is to will well to the neighbor, to be affected with good, and to acknowledge good as the neighbor, consequently those who are in good, with a difference according to the degree of their good; and hence charity, because it is affected with good, is affected with mercy toward those who are in miseries. The good of charity has this within it because it descends from the Lord's love toward the whole human race, which love is mercy because all the human race is settled in miseries. Mercy sometimes shows itself in the evil, who are in no charity; but this is grief on account of what they themselves suffer, for it is shown toward their friends who make one with them, and when their friends suffer, they suffer. This mercy is not the mercy of charity, but is the mercy of friendship for the sake of self, which regarded in itself is unmercifulness; for it despises or hates all others besides itself, thus besides the friends who make one with it. </p>

 <p>And make mention of me unto Pharaoh. That this signifies communication with the interior natural, is evident from the signification of "making mention to" anyone as being to communicate; and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the interior natural (see n. 5080, 5095). By "communication with the interior natural" is meant conjunction by correspondence. The interior natural is that which receives ideas of truth and good from the rational, and stores them up for use, consequently which communicates immediately with the rational; but the exterior natural is that which receives images and thence ideas of things from the world through the senses. [2] These ideas, unless enlightened by those which are in the interior natural, present fallacies, which are called the fallacies of the senses. When man is in these fallacies, he believes nothing but what agrees with them, and what they confirm, as is the case if there is no correspondence; and there is no correspondence unless the man is imbued with charity, for charity is the uniting means, because in the good of it there is life from the Lord, which disposes truth into order, so that the form of charity, or charity in an image, may come into existence. This form appears visibly in the other life, and is the angelic form itself. Hence all the angels are forms of charity, the beauty of which is from the truths which are of faith, and the life of this beauty is from the good which is of charity. </p>

 <p>And bring me out of this house. That this signifies deliverance from evils, is evident from the signification of "bringing out," as being deliverance; and from the signification of a "house," as being good (see n. 710, 1708, 2048, 2233, 3128, 3652, 3720, 4982); and therefore in the opposite sense, evil. Hence it is plain that deliverance from evils is signified by the words, "bring me out of this house," and this also follows in its order from the things which precede. When faith is received in the exterior natural (which is here treated of, see n. 5130), correspondence is effected (n. 5131), and charity is received (n. 5132), and thus communication is effected with the interior natural (n. 5133), which is then delivered from the evils whereby the celestial represented by Joseph (n. 5086, 5087, 5106) was alienated; which alienation is signified by his being "carried off by theft," as presently follows. Moreover, when the natural is being regenerated by means of charity and faith, it is delivered from evils; for evils are then separated, and are cast out from the center where they were before, to the circumferences, whither the light of truth from good does not reach. In this way are evils separated in man, and yet are retained, for they cannot be entirely destroyed. But with the Lord, who made the natural in Himself Divine, evils and falsities were utterly cast out and destroyed; for the Divine can have nothing in common with evils and falsities, nor be terminated in them, as is the case with man; for the Divine is the very being of good and of truth, which is infinitely removed from what is evil and false. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5135.">5135.</a></font></span>
 <p>For in being carried off by theft I was carried away. That this signifies that celestial things were alienated by evil, is evident from the representation of Joseph, who says these things of himself, as being the celestial in the natural (n. 5086, 5087, 5106), consequently the celestial things therein; and from the signification of "being carried off by theft," as being to be alienated by evil; for "to steal" is to alienate, and "theft" is the evil which alienates, and also the evil which claims the celestial things that are in the natural. "Theft" signifies alienation in respect to the abode of which it takes possession, and from which it casts out goods and truths, and which it fills with evils and falsities; "theft" also signifies the claiming of what belongs to others when it attributes to itself and makes its own the goods and truths which are in that abode, and also when it applies them to evils and falsities. That it may be known what "theft" is in the spiritual sense, it is necessary to state how the case is with evils and falsities when they enter and take possession of the abode, and also when they claim the goods and truths which are there. [2] From infancy until childhood, and sometimes till early manhood, by instruction from his parents and teachers a man is imbued with goods and truths; for he then learns them with avidity, and believes them in simplicity. The state of innocence favors them and adapts them to the memory, but places them only at the first threshold; for the innocence of infancy and childhood is not internal innocence which affects the rational, but is external innocence which affects only the exterior natural (see n. 2306, 3183, 3494, 4563, 4797). But when the man grows older and begins to think from himself, and not as before from parents and teachers, he then takes up again and as it were ruminates the things which he had before learned and believed, and either confirms them, or doubts about them, or denies them. If he confirms them, it is a sign that he is in good; if he denies them, it is a sign that he is in evil; but if he doubts about them, it is a sign that in succeeding years he will accede either to the affirmative or to the negative. [3] The things which man as a little child in its first age learns eagerly or believes, and which he afterward either confirms, or doubts about, or denies, are especially these: that there is a God, and that He is one; that He has created all things; that He rewards those who do well, and punishes those who do evil; that there is a life after death, in which the evil go to hell and the good to heaven, thus that there is a hell and a heaven, and that the life after death is eternal; also that he ought to pray daily, and this with humility; that the Sabbath day is to be kept holy; that parents are to be honored; and that no one must commit adultery, murder, or theft; with other like things. These things man imbibes and is imbued with from early childhood; but when he begins to think from himself and to lead himself, if he confirms such things in himself, and adds to them things which are still more interior, and lives according to them, then it is well with him; but if he begins to infringe these things, and at last to deny them, however much for the sake of civil laws and for the sake of society he may live in externals according to them, he is then in evil. [4] This evil is what is signified by "theft," insofar as like a thief it takes possession of the abode in which good has been before, and insofar as with many it takes away the goods and truths which had been there before, and applies them to confirm evils and falsities. The Lord insofar as possible then removes from that abode the goods and truths of early childhood, and withdrawing them toward the interiors stores them up in the interior natural for use. These goods and truths stored up in the interior natural are signified in the Word by "remains" (see n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 660, 661, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284). But if evil steals the goods and truths there, and applies them to confirm evils and falsities, especially if it does this from deceit, then it consumes these remains; for it then mingles evils with goods and falsities with truths till they cannot be separated, and then it is all over with the man. [5] That such things are signified by "theft," may be seen from the mere application of "theft" to the things of spiritual life. In spiritual life there are no other riches than the knowledges of good and truth, and no other possessions and inheritances than the felicities of life arising from goods and their truths. As before said, to steal these things is "theft" in the spiritual sense; and therefore by "thefts," in the Word, nothing else is signified in the internal sense; as in Zechariah: 	I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, when behold a flying roll. Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth upon the faces of the whole earth; for everyone that stealeth hence, like it is innocent; and everyone that sweareth, like it is innocent. I have cast it forth that it may enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth by My name for lying; and it shall pass the night in his house, and shall consume it and the wood thereof and the stones thereof (Zech. 5:1, 3-4); the evil which takes away the remains of good is signified by "him that stealeth," and by the "house of the thief;" and the falsity which takes away the remains of truth is signified by "him that sweareth," and by the "house of him that sweareth for lying;" the "faces of the whole earth" denote the universal church; therefore it is said that "the curse shall consume the house and the wood thereof and the stones thereof." The "house" is the natural mind or man as to this mind (n. 3128, 3538, 4973, 5023); "wood" is the goods therein (n. 2784, 2812, 3720, 4943); and the "stones" are truths (n. 643, 1298, 3720). [6] Profanation and hence the taking away of good and truth are signified in the spiritual sense by the deed of Achan, who took of the accursed things a mantle of Shinar, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold, and hid them in the earth in the midst of his tent, and who therefore was stoned, and all the things were burned; as is related in Joshua: 	Jehovah said unto Joshua, Israel hath sinned, they have transgressed My covenant which I commanded them; and they have taken of the accursed thing, and have stolen, lied, and have put it among their vessels (Josh. 7:10-11, 21, 25); by "accursed things" were meant falsities and evils, which were in no wise to be mixed up with holy things; the "mantle of Shinar, shekels of silver, and wedge of gold" are in the spiritual sense species of falsity; "hiding them under the earth in the midst of the tent" signified a commixture with holy things. (That a "tent" denotes what is holy may be seen above, n. 414, 1102, 1566, 2145, 2152, 3312, 4128, 4391, 4599.) These things were signified by Israel's "stealing, lying, and putting it among their vessels;" for "vessels" are holy truths (see n. 3068, 3079, 3316, 3318). [7] In Jeremiah: 	I will bring the issue of Esau upon him, the time that I shall visit him. If grape gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grape gleanings? If thieves by night, would they not destroy a sufficiency? I will strip Esau, I will uncover his secret things, and he shall not be able to hide, his seed is devastated, and his brethren, and his neighbors, and he is not (Jer. 49:8-10); where "Esau" denotes the evil of the love of self to which falsities are adjoined (n. 3322). That this evil consumes the remains of good and truth is signified by "thieves in the night destroying a sufficiency;" and by "his seed, his brethren, and his neighbors being devastated, and he is not." "Seed" denotes the truths which are of faith from charity (n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 1940, 2848, 3038, 3310, 3373); "brethren" denote the goods which are of charity (n. 367, 2360, 2508, 2524, 3160, 3303, 3459, 3815, 4121, 4191); "neighbors" denote the adjoined and related truths and goods which belong to him. [8] Something similar is said of Esau in Obadiah: 	If thieves come to thee, if overthrowers by night (how wilt thou be cut off!) will they not steal till they have enough? If grape gatherers come to thee, will they not leave some clusters? (Obad. 5); "grape gatherers" denote falsities which are not from evil; by these falsities the goods and truths stored up by the Lord in man's interior natural (that is, remains) are not consumed, but by falsities derived from evils, which steal truths and goods and also by wrong applications employ them to confirm evils and falsities. [9] In Joel: 	A great people and mighty, they shall run like heroes; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march everyone in his ways; they shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run on the wall; they shall climb up into the houses; they shall enter in through the windows like a thief (Joel 2:2, 7, 9); a "great people and mighty" denotes falsities fighting against truths (n. 1259, 1260); and because they fight mightily in destroying truths, they are said to be "like heroes and men of war;" the "city" through which they are said to "run to and fro" denotes the doctrinals of truth (n. 402, 2268, 2449, 2712, 2943, 3216); the "houses into which they shall climb" denote the goods which they destroy (n. 710, 1708, 2048, 2233, 3128, 3652, 3720, 4982); the "windows through which they shall enter in" denote things intellectual and the derivative reasonings (n. 655, 658, 3391); hence they are compared to a "thief," because they take possession of the abode previously occupied by truths and goods. [10] In David: 	As thou hatest discipline, and castest My words behind thee; if thou seest a thief thou runnest with him, and thy part is with adulterers. Thou openest thy mouth for evil, and with thy tongue thou weavest deceit (Ps. 50:17-19); speaking of a wicked person, "to run with a thief" denotes to alienate truth from himself by means of falsity. [11] In Revelation: 	They repented not of their murders, nor of their enchantments, nor of their whoredoms, nor of their thefts (Rev. 9:21); "murders" denote evils which destroy goods; "enchantments," falsities therefrom which destroy truths; "whoredoms," truths falsified; "thefts" goods thus alienated. [12] In John: 	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not through the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, he is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in through the door is the shepherd of the sheep. I am the door; through Me if anyone enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and shall find pasture. The thief cometh not but to steal, and to murder, and to destroy (John 10:1-2, 9-10); here again a "thief" denotes the evil of merit; for he who takes away from the Lord what is His, and claims it for himself, is called a "thief." As this evil closes the way and prevents good and truth from the Lord from flowing in, it is said "to murder" and "to destroy." The same is signified by the commandment in the Decalogue: 	Thou shalt not steal (Deut. 5:19; see n. 4174). From all this it is evident what is signified by the laws enacted in the Jewish Church in regard to thefts (as in Exod. 21:16; 22:1-4; Deut. 24:7); for as all the laws in that church originated in the spiritual world, they correspond to the laws of order which are in heaven. </p>

 <p>Out of the land of the Hebrews. That this signifies from the church, namely, that celestial things were alienated from it through evil, is evident from the signification of the "land of the Hebrews," as being the church. The "land of the Hebrews" here, is the land of Canaan; for Joseph was taken away from there. The reason why the land of Canaan in the Word signifies the church, is that the church has been there from the most ancient time: first the Most Ancient Church, which was before the flood; next the Ancient Church, which was after the flood; afterward the Second Ancient Church, which was called the Hebrew Church; and at last the Jewish Church. And in order that the Jewish Church might be instituted there, Abram was commanded to betake himself thither out of Syria, and it was there promised him that this land should be given to his posterity for an inheritance. This is the reason why "land" or "earth" in the Word signifies the church, and the "whole earth," as sometimes occurs, the universal church; and also the "new heaven and new earth," a new church internal and external. [2] The reason why the church was continued there from the most ancient time, is that the man of the Most Ancient Church, who was celestial, was of such a character that in each and all things in the world and upon the earth he saw a representative of the Lord's kingdom; the objects of the world and the earth being to him the means of thinking about heavenly things. This was the origin of all the representatives and significatives that were afterward known in the Ancient Church, for they were collected by those who are meant by "Enoch," and were preserved for the use of posterity (n. 519, 521, 2896). From this it came to pass that every place, and also every mountain and river, in the land of Canaan, where the most ancient people dwelt, and likewise all the kingdoms round about, became representative; and as the Word could not be written except by representatives and significatives, even of places, therefore for the sake of this end the church was successively preserved in the land of Canaan; but after the coming of the Lord it was transferred elsewhere, because representatives were then abolished. [3] From the foregoing it is plain that by the land of Canaan, which is here called the "land of the Hebrews," is signified the church; but see what has been previously adduced on these subjects; namely, that the Most Ancient Church, which was before the flood, was in the land of Canaan (n. 567, 3686, 4447, 4454); that part of the Ancient Church, which was after the flood, was there (see n. 3686, 4447); also that a second Ancient Church, which was called the Hebrew Church, was there (n. 4516, 4517); that for the same reason Abram was commanded to go there, and that land was given to his posterity (n. 3686, 4447); that from this the land of Canaan represented the Lord's kingdom (n. 1607, 3038, 3481, 3705, 4240, 4447); and that it is for this reason that by "earth" or "land" in the Word is signified the church (see n. 566, 662, 1066, 1068, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355, 4447, 4535). </p>

 <p>And here also have I done nothing. That this signifies innocence, is evident without explication; for not to do anything evil is the part of innocence. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5138.">5138.</a></font></span>
 <p>That they should put me into the pit. That this signifies rejection among falsities, is evident from the signification of a "pit," as being falsity (see n. 4728, 4744, 5038). Evil has been treated of above-that celestial things were alienated by it (n. 5134, 5135); but here falsity is treated of, for where the one is mentioned in the Word, the other is mentioned also, that is to say, where evil is mentioned, falsity also is mentioned; because where good is treated of, there also truth is treated of, in order that there may be a marriage in everything of the Word. For the heavenly marriage is that of good and truth, but the infernal marriage is that of evil and falsity; because where there is evil, there is also falsity, joining itself to evil as a wife to her husband; and where there is good there is also truth, because truth conjoins itself with good as a wife with her husband. Hence the quality of the faith may be known from the life; for good is of the life and truth is of the faith, and conversely it is the same with evil and falsity. (That there is a marriage in everything of the Word may be seen above, n. 683, 793, 801, 2173, 2516, 2712, 4137e.) </p>

 <p>Verses 16-19. And the prince of the bakers saw that he had interpreted good, and he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and behold three baskets with holes in them upon my head; and in the uppermost basket there was of all food for Pharaoh, the work of the baker; and the birds did eat them out of the basket from upon my head. And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets three days are these. In yet three days shall Pharaoh lift off thy head from upon thee, and shall hang thee upon wood; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from upon thee. "And the prince of the bakers saw," signifies the perception of the sensuous that is subject to the will part; "that he had interpreted good," signifies what would happen; "and he said unto Joseph," signifies the perception of the celestial in the natural; "I also was in my dream," signifies prediction; "and behold three baskets," signifies the successives of things of the will; "with holes in them upon my head," signifies without termination anywhere in the middle; "and in the uppermost basket," signifies the inmost of the will part; "there was of all food for Pharaoh," signifies full of celestial good for the nourishment of the natural; "the work of the baker," signifies according to every use of the sensuous; "and the birds did eat them out of the basket from upon my head," signifies that falsity from evil consumed it; "and Joseph answered and said," signifies revelation from perception from the celestial in the natural; "This is the interpretation thereof," signifies what it had in it; "the three baskets," signifies the successives of the things of the will; "three days are these," signifies even to the last; "in yet three days," signifies that which is in the last; "shall Pharaoh lift off thy head from upon thee," signifies what is concluded from what is foreseen; "and shall hang thee upon wood," signifies rejection and damnation; "and the birds shall eat thy flesh from upon thee," signifies that the falsity from evil will consume what is of these sensuous things. </p>

 <p>And the prince of the bakers saw. That this signifies the perception of the sensuous that is subject to the will part, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being to understand and perceive (n. 2150, 2807, 3764, 4723); and from the signification of the "prince of the bakers," as being the sensuous in general subject to the will part, thus these sensuous things (n. 5078, 5082). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5141.">5141.</a></font></span>
 <p>That he had interpreted good. That this signifies what would happen, is evident from the signification of "interpreting," as being what it had in it, or what there was therein (of which above, n. 5093, 5105, 5107, 5121); thus also what would happen. That good would happen, is the perception from the sensuous, which perception is comparatively obscure. There actually do exist perception from the sensuous or exterior natural, perception from the interior natural, and perception from the rational; for when a man is in interior thought from affection, and withdraws his mind from sensuous things and from the body, he is in rational perception; for then the things which are beneath, or which belong to the external man, are quiescent, and the man is almost in his spirit. But when man is in exterior thought, from causes which exist in the world, then his perception is from the interior natural, and the rational indeed flows in, but not with any life of affection. But when man is in pleasures, and in the delights of the love of the world and also of the love of self, the perception is from the sensuous; for his life is then in externals or in the body, and admits no more from the interiors than may serve to moderate his outbursts into what is dishonorable and unbecoming. But the more external the perception is, the more obscure it is, because exterior things are comparatively general, for innumerable interior things appear as one in the exterior. </p>

 <p>And he said unto Joseph. That this signifies the perception of the celestial in the natural, is evident from the signification of "saying," in the historic parts of the Word, as being perception (often explained before); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial in the natural (see n. 5086, 5087, 5106). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5143.">5143.</a></font></span>
 <p>I also was in my dream. That this signifies prediction, is evident from the signification of a "dream," as being prediction concerning the event (see n. 5092, 5104, 5112). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="5144.">5144.</a></font></span>
 <p>And behold three baskets. That this signifies the successives of the things of the will, is evident from the signification of "three," as being what is complete and continuous even to the end (see n. 2788, 4495, 5114, 5122), thus what is successive; and from the signification of "baskets," as being things of the will. That "baskets" are things of the will is because they are vessels to hold food; and also because food signifies celestial and spiritual goods, and these are of the will; for all good pertains to the will, and all truth to the understanding. As soon as anything comes forth from the will, it is perceived as good. In what precedes, the sensuous subject to the intellectual part has been treated of, which was represented by the butler; what is now treated of is the sensuous subject to the will part, which is represented by the baker (see n. 5077, 5078, 5082).  [2] What is successive or continuous in intellectual things was represented by the vine, its three shoots, its blossoms, clusters, and grapes; and finally the truth which is of the intellect was represented by the cup (see n. 5120); but what is successive in the things of the will is represented by the three baskets on the head, in the uppermost of which there was of all food for Pharaoh, the work of the baker. By what is successive in the things of the will is meant what is successive from the inmosts of man down to his outermost, in which is the sensuous; for there are steps or degrees as of a ladder, from inmosts to outermosts (see n. 5114). Into the inmost there flows good from the Lord, and this through the rational into the interior natural, and thence into the exterior natural or sensuous, in a distinct succession, as by the steps of a ladder; and in each degree it is qualified according to the reception. But the further nature of this influx and its succession will be shown in the following pages. [3] "Baskets" signify the things of the will insofar as goods are therein, in other passages of the Word, as in Jeremiah: 	Jehovah showed me, when behold two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah; in one basket exceedingly good figs, like the figs that are first ripe; but in the other basket exceedingly bad figs, which could not be eaten for badness (Jer. 24:1-2); here "basket" is expressed in the original by a different word, which signifies the will part in the natural; the "figs" in the one basket are natural goods, while those in the other are natural evils. [4] In Moses: 	When thou art come into the land which Jehovah thy God will give thee, thou shalt take of the first ripe of all the fruit of the land, which thou shalt bring in from thy land, and thou shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which Jehovah shall choose. Then the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand, and set it before the altar of Jehovah thy God (Deut. 26:1-2, 4); here "basket" is expressed by still another word that signifies a new will part in the intellectual part; "the first ripe of the fruit of the earth" are the goods thence derived. [5] In the same: 	For the sanctifying of Aaron and his sons, Moses was to take unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened mingled with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil; of fine wheaten flour shalt thou make them. And thou shalt put them upon one basket, and bring them near in the basket. Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting (Exod. 29:2-3, 32); "basket" here is expressed by the same term as in the present chapter, signifying the will part in which are the goods signified by "bread," "cakes," "oil," "wafers," "flour," and "wheat;" by the will part is meant the containant; for goods from the Lord flow into the interior forms of man, as into their vessels, which forms, if disposed for reception, are the "baskets" in which these goods are contained. [6] Again: 	When a Nazirite was being inaugurated he was to take a basket of unleavened things of fine flour, cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, with their meat-offering, and their drink-offerings; a ram also he shall make a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah, besides the basket of unleavened things; and the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hand of the Nazirite, and the priest shall wave them with a waving before Jehovah (Num. 6:15, 17, 19-20); here also "basket" denotes the will part as the containant; the "cakes," the "wafers," the "oil," the "meat-offering," the "boiled shoulder of the ram," are celestial goods which were being represented; for the Nazirite represented the celestial man (n. 3301). [7] At that time such things as were used in worship were carried in baskets; as was also the kid of the goats by Gideon, which he brought forth to the angel under the oak (Judges 6:19); and this for the reason that baskets represented the containants, and the things in the baskets, the contents. </p>

 <p>With holes in them upon my head. That this signifies without termination anywhere in the middle, is evident from the signification of "with holes in them," as being open from highest to lowest, thus not closed, consequently without termination anywhere in the middle; and from the signification of the "head," as being the interiors, especially those of the will; for in the head are all substances and forms in their beginnings, and therefore all sensations tend thither and there present themselves, and all acts descend from it and take their origin. It is evident that the faculties of the mind, that is, of the understanding and the will, are there; and therefore by the "head" are signified the interiors. These baskets represented the things which are in the head.  [2] The sensuous things which are subject to the will part are now treated of, and by the "baskets with holes in them upon the head" is signified that the interiors were without termination anywhere in the middle, and for this reason these sensuous things were rejected and damned-as will be seen in what follows. But it may be well to state what is meant by being without termination anywhere in the middle. Man's interiors are distinguished into degrees, and in each degree the interiors are terminated, and by termination are separated from the degree next below; it is thus from the inmost to the outermost. The interior rational constitutes the first degree; in this are the celestial angels, or in this is the inmost or third heaven. The exterior rational makes the second degree; in this are the spiritual angels, or in this is the middle or second heaven. The interior natural makes the third degree; in this are good spirits, or the ultimate or first heaven. The exterior natural, or the sensuous, makes the fourth degree; and in this is man. These degrees in man are most distinct. [3] Thence it is that if he lives in good, a man is as to his interiors a heaven in the least form, or that his interiors correspond to the three heavens; and hence it is that if a man has lived a life of charity and love, he can be carried after death even into the third heaven. But that he may be of this character, it is necessary that all the degrees in him should be well terminated, and thus by means of terminations be distinct from one another; and when they are terminated, or by means of terminations are made distinct from one another, each degree is a plane in which the good which flows in from the Lord rests, and where it is received. Without these degrees as planes, good is not received, but flows through, as through a sieve or a basket that has holes in it, down to the sensuous, and then, being without any direction in the way, it is turned into a foulness which appears to those who are in it as good, namely, into the delight of the love of self and of the world, consequently into the delight of hatred, revenge, cruelty, adultery, and avarice, or into mere voluptuousness and luxury. This is the case if the things of man's will are without termination anywhere in the middle, or if they "have holes in them."  [4] It is quite possible to know whether there are these terminations and consequent planes; for the perceptions of good and truth, and of conscience, show this. With those who have perceptions of good and truth, as have the celestial angels, the terminations are from the first degree to the last; for without terminations of all the degrees, such perceptions are impossible. (In regard to these perceptions, see above, n. 125, 202, 495, 503, 511, 536, 597, 607, 784, 865, 895, 1121, 1383, 1384, 1387, 1919, 2144, 2145, 2171, 2515, 2831.) With those also who have conscience, as the spiritual angels have, there are terminations, but from the second degree or from the third to the last, the first degree being closed with these angels. It is said "from the second degree" or "from the third," because conscience is twofold, interior and exterior; interior conscience is that of spiritual good and truth, exterior conscience is that of what is just and equitable. Conscience itself is an interior plane in which the influx of the Divine good terminates. But they who have no conscience have not any interior plane to receive this influx; and with these persons good flows through down to the exterior natural or natural-sensuous; and as before said is there turned into foul delights. Sometimes these persons seem to feel a pain as of conscience, but it is not conscience; it is a pain arising from the loss of their delight, such as that of honor, gain, reputation, life, pleasures, or the friendship of people like themselves; and this is because the terminations are in delights like these. From all this it is evident what is signified in the spiritual sense by the baskets with holes in them.  [5] In the other life especially is it discerned whether the things of a man's will have or have not been terminated. With those in whom they have been terminated there is zeal for spiritual good and truth, or for what is just and equitable, for these persons have done what is good for the sake of good or for the sake of truth, and have acted justly for the sake of what is just or equitable, and not for the sake of gain, honor, and things like these. All those with whom the interiors of the will have been terminated are taken up into heaven, for the Divine that flows in can lead them, whereas all those with whom the interior things of the will have not been terminated, betake themselves into hell; for the Divine flows through, and is turned into what is infernal, just as when the heat of the sun falls upon foul excrements, and causes a noisome stench. Consequently all who have had conscience are saved; but they who have had no conscience cannot be saved. [6] The things of the will are said to have holes in them, or not to be terminated, when there is no affection of good and truth, or of what is just and equitable; and also when these things are regarded as comparatively worthless or as nothing, or are valued solely for the sake of securing gain or honor. The affections are what terminate and close, and are therefore called "bonds" - affections of good and truth "internal bonds," and affections of evil and falsity "external bonds" (n. 3835). Unless the affections of evil and falsity were bonds, the man would be insane (n. 4217); for insanities are nothing else than the loosenings of such bonds; thus they are non-terminations in such persons; but as in these persons there are no internal bonds, they are inwardly insane in respect to the thoughts and affections, while restrained from breaking out by external bonds, which are affections of gain and honor, and of reputation as a means of acquiring these, and the consequent fear of the law and of the loss of life. This was represented in the Jewish Church by the fact that every open vessel in the house of a dead person upon which there was no cloth cover was unclean (Num. 19:15). [7] Similar things are signified by "works full of holes" in Isaiah: 	They that make thread of silks, and they that weave works full of holes, shall blush; and the foundations thereof shall be broken in pieces, all they that make hire pools of the soul (Isa. 19:9-10); and by "holes" in Ezekiel: 	The spirit brought the prophet to the door of the court; where he saw, and behold a hole in the wall; and he said unto him, Come bore a hole through the wall; he therefore bored through the wall, and behold a door; then said he unto him, Go in and see the abominations that they do here. When he went in and saw, behold every figure of creeping thing and beast, an abomination, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the walls round about (Ezek. 8:7-10). </p>

 <p>And in the uppermost basket. That this signifies the inmost of the will part, is evident from the signification of a "basket" as being the will part (of which above, n. 5144); and from the signification of "the uppermost," as being the inmost (n. 2148, 3084, 4599). The reason why the "uppermost" denotes the inmost is that with man who is in space, interior things appear as higher things, and exterior things as lower ones; but when the idea of space is put off, as is the case in heaven and also in the interior thought of man, there is then put off the idea of what is high and what is low; for height and depth come from the idea of space. Nay, in the interior heaven there is no idea of things interior and exterior, because something of space adheres to this idea also; but there is the idea of more perfect or more imperfect state; for interior things are in a more perfect state than exterior ones, because interior things are nearer the Divine, and exterior things are more remote from it. This is the reason why what is uppermost signifies what is inmost.  [2] Nevertheless no one can apprehend what the interior is relatively to the exterior unless he knows how the case stands with degrees (in regard to which see above, n. 3691, 4154, 5114, 5145). Man has no other conception of what is interior and hence more perfect than as of what is purer in continual diminution; but the purer and the grosser are possible in one and the same degree, both according to the expansion and the contraction, and according to the determinations, and also according to the insertions of things homogeneous or heterogeneous. As such an idea prevails about the interior of man, it is quite impossible to avoid the notion that the exteriors are continuously coherent with the interiors, and thus act with them absolutely as a one. But if a genuine idea about degrees is formed, it is then possible to see how the interiors and the exteriors are distinct from one another, and that they are so distinct that the interiors can come into existence and subsist without the exteriors, but by no means the exteriors without the interiors. It is also then possible to see how the case stands with the correspondence of the interiors in the exteriors, and also how the exteriors can represent the interiors. This is the reason why the learned can treat hypothetically only of the interaction between the soul and the body; nay, this is also the reason why many of them believe life to be in the body, so that when the body dies, they believe that they will die as to the interiors also, on account of the coherence of these with the body, when yet it is only the exterior degree that dies, the interior then surviving and living. </p>

 <p>There was of all food for Pharaoh. That this signifies full of celestial good for the nourishment of the natural, is evident from the signification of "food," as being celestial good (of which presently); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the interior natural (see n. 5080, 5095), and also the natural in general; for when they correspond, the interior and exterior natural make a one; and as food is for nourishment, by the words "there was of all food for Pharaoh" is signified full of celestial good for the nourishment of the natural. It is said that this food was in the uppermost basket; and by this is signified that the inmost of the will part was full of celestial good. For good from the Lord flows in through man's inmost, and thence through degrees as by the steps of a ladder to the exteriors; for the inmost is relatively in the most perfect state, and therefore can receive good immediately from the Lord; but not so the lower things. If these were to receive good from the Lord immediately, they would either obscure it or pervert it, for they are relatively more imperfect. [2] As regards the influx of celestial good from the Lord, and its reception, be it known that man's will part receives good, and his intellectual receives truth, and that the intellectual can by no means receive truth so as to make it its own, unless at the same time the will part receives good; and conversely; for the one flows in this way into the other, and disposes it to receive. The things of the intellect may be compared to forms which are continually varying, and the things of the will to the harmonies that result from this variation; consequently truths may be compared to variations, and goods to the delights therefrom; and as this is eminently the case with truths and goods, it is evident that the one is impossible without the other, and also that the one cannot be produced except by means of the other.  [3] That "food" signifies celestial good, is because the food of the angels is nothing else than the goods of love and of charity, by which they are not only made alive, but are also refreshed. These goods in act, or the practice of them, serve especially for the refreshment of the angels, because they are their desires; and it is known that when the desires are realized in act, they afford refreshment and life. That such things yield nourishment to the spirit of man, while material food yields nourishment to his body, may also be seen from the fact that food without delights conduces but little to nourishment, but together with delights it nourishes. It is the delights that open the passages or ducts which receive the food and convey it into the blood; whereas things undelightful close them. With the angels these delights are the goods of love and of charity, and from this it can be inferred that they are spiritual foods which correspond to earthly foods. As goods are food, so truths are drink. [4] "Food" is mentioned in many places in the Word, and one who is not acquainted with the internal sense cannot know but that ordinary food is there meant, whereas it is spiritual food; as in Jeremiah: 	All the people groan, seeking bread; they have given their desirable things for food, to refresh the soul (Lam. 1:11). In Isaiah: 	Everyone that thirsteth, go ye to the waters, and he that hath no silver, go ye, buy, and eat; yea, go, buy wine and milk without silver and without price (Isa. 55:1). In Joel: 	The day of Jehovah is near, and as devastation from the Thunderer shall it come. Is not the food cut off before our eyes? gladness and joy from the house of our God? The grains have rotted under their clods; the garners are devastated, the barns are destroyed, because the corn is withered (Joel 1:15-17). In David: 	Our garners are full, bringing forth from food to food; our flocks are thousands and ten thousands in our streets. There is no cry in our streets; blessed is the people that is in such a case (Ps. 144:13-15). Again: 	All things wait for Thee, that Thou mayest give them their food in its time. Thou givest them, they gather; Thou openest Thy hand, they are sated with good (Ps. 104:27-28). [5] In these passages celestial and spiritual food is meant in the internal sense, while material food is meant in the sense of the letter. From this it is plain in what manner the interiors and exteriors of the Word, or those things therein which are of the spirit, and those which are of the letter, correspond to each other; so that while man understands these things according to the sense of the letter, the angels with him understand them according to the spiritual sense. The Word has been so written as to serve not only the human race, but also heaven; for which reason all the expressions therein are significative of heavenly things, and all the things are representative of them, and this even to the least jot. [6] That "food" in the spiritual sense is good, the Lord also plainly teaches in John: 	Labor not for the food that perisheth, but for the food that abideth into life eternal, which the Son of man shall give to you (John 6:27). Again: 	My flesh is truly food, and My blood is truly drink (John 6:55); where "flesh" is the Divine good (n. 3813); and "blood" is the Divine truth (n. 4735). And again: 	Jesus said to His disciples, I have food to eat that ye know not. The disciples said one to another, Hath any man brought Him aught to eat? Jesus saith to them, My food is that I do the will of Him that sent Me, and that I perfect His work (John 4:32-34); "to do the will of the Father, and to perfect His work," is the Divine good in act or exercise, which as before said in the genuine sense is "food." </p>

 <p>The work of the baker. That this signifies according to every use of the sensuous, is evident from the signification of "work," as being according to every use (of which hereafter); and from the signification of a "baker," as being the sensuous subject to the will part (see n. 5078, 5082). The reason why "work" denotes use is that it is predicated of the will part, or of the sensuous subject to the will part; and whatever is done by means of this, and can be called "work," must be use. All the works of charity are nothing else, for works of charity are works from the will that are uses. </p>

 <p>And the bird did eat them out of the basket from upon my head. That this signifies that falsity from evil consumed it, is evident from the signification of "the birds" as being intellectual things, and also thoughts, consequently the things thence derived; namely, in the genuine sense truths of every kind, and in the opposite sense falsities (see n. 40, 745, 776, 778, 866, 988, 3219); and from the signification of "eating," as being to consume (in the original tongue also, the word "eat" means to consume); and from the signification of a "basket," as being the will part (n. 5144, 5146), here evil from the will part, because the basket had holes in it (n. 5145). From this it follows that by the "bird eating out of the basket from upon the head" is signified that falsity from evil consumed.  [2] There is falsity from two origins-falsity of doctrine, and falsity of evil. Falsity of doctrine does not consume goods, for a man may be in falsity of doctrine, and yet in good, and therefore men of every doctrine, even Gentiles, are saved; but the falsity of evil is that which consumes goods. Evil in itself is opposite to good, yet by itself it does not consume goods, but by means of falsity, for falsity attacks the truths which belong to good, because truths are as it were outworks that encompass good. These outworks are assaulted by means of falsity, and when these are assaulted good is given to destruction. [3] One who does not know that "birds" signify things of the intellect, cannot know otherwise than that where "birds" are mentioned in the Word, either birds are meant, or else they are used by way of comparison, as in common speech. Except from the internal sense no one can know that by "birds" are meant things of the understanding such as thoughts, ideas, reasonings, principles, consequently truths or falsities; as in Luke: 	The kingdom of God is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew and became a great tree; so that the birds of the heaven dwelt in the branches of it (Luke 13:19); the "birds of the heaven" here denotes truths. [4] In Ezekiel: 	It shall go forth into a magnificent cedar; and under it shall dwell every bird of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell (Ezek. 17:23); "bird of every wing" denotes truths of every kind. And again: 	Asshur was a cedar in Lebanon. All the birds of the heavens made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches all the beasts of the field brought forth, and in his shadow dwelt all great nations (Ezek. 31:3, 6); "birds of the heavens" in like manner denote truths. [5] Again: 	Upon his ruin all the birds of the heavens shall dwell, and all the wild animals of the field shall be upon his branches (Ezek. 31:13); where "birds of the heavens" denote falsities. In Daniel: 	Nebuchadnezzar saw in a dream; behold a tree in the midst of the earth; the beast of the field had shadow under it, and the bird of the heaven dwelt in the branches thereof (Dan. 4:10, 12, 18); where again "birds of the heaven" denote falsities. [6] In Jeremiah: 	I beheld and lo there was no man, and all the birds of the heaven were fled (Jer. 4:25); "no man" denotes no good (n. 4287); the "birds of the heaven that were fled" denotes that truths were dispersed. Again: 	From the bird of the heavens, even to the beast, they are fled, they are gone (Jer. 9:10); where the meaning is similar. And in Matthew: 	The sower went forth to sow; and some seeds fell upon the hard way, and the birds came and devoured them (Matt. 13:3-4); where "birds" denote reasonings, and also falsities. The meaning is similar in many other passages. </p>

 <p>And Joseph answered and said. That this signifies revelation from perception, from the celestial in the natural, is evident from the signification of "answering and saying," as being revelation from perception (of which above, see n. 5121); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial in the natural (n. 5086, 5087, 5106). That here "Joseph" is the celestial in the natural, is because the subject here treated of is the natural. In regard to the celestial and the spiritual the case is this. The celestial itself and the spiritual itself which flow into heaven from the Divine of the Lord dwell principally in the interior rational; for there the forms are more perfect, and are accommodated to reception; nevertheless the celestial and spiritual from the Divine of the Lord flow into the exterior rational also, and likewise into the natural; and this both mediately and immediately-mediately through the interior rational, and immediately from the Lord's very Divine. That which flows in immediately disposes, and that which flows in mediately is disposed. This is the case in the exterior rational, and in the natural; and hence it is evident what is meant by the celestial in the natural. [2] The celestial is from the Divine good, and the spiritual is from the Divine truth, both of them being from the Lord; and when these are in the rational they are called the celestial and the spiritual in the rational; and when in the natural, the celestial and the spiritual in the natural. By the "rational" and the "natural" is meant the man himself, insofar as he is formed to receive the celestial and the spiritual; but by the "rational" is meant his internal, and by the "natural" his external. Through influx and according to the reception, a man is called celestial or spiritual-celestial if the Lord's Divine good is received in the will part, spiritual if it in received in the intellectual part. </p>
