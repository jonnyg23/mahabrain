 <p>Circumcising he shall be circumcised. That this signifies that they must wholly remove from themselves the loves of self and of the world, that is, that they must do this who are within the church and who are signified by him "that is born in the house," and by him "that is bought with silver," is evident from the representation of circumcision," as being purification from the loves of self and of the world (see above, n. 2039). It is here repeated that they are to be circumcised, and it is said, "circumcising he shall be circumcised," by which is expressed the necessity, that is, for their being wholly purified from those loves. And as those are signified who are within the church, the "sons that are strangers" are not mentioned here, because by them (as shown above, n. 2049) are signified those who are outside the church.  [2] From the repetition of what was said in the preceding verse concerning those born in the house and those bought with silver, everyone can see that there is a Divine arcanum which is not seen from the sense of the letter. The arcanum is, that purification from those filthy loves is necessary most of all within the church, and this for the reason that they who are within the church are able to render holy things themselves impure, which they who are outside the church-that is, the Gentiles cannot do; so that the danger of damnation is greater in the case of the former. Moreover those who are within the church are able to form principles of falsity contrary to the very truths of faith, and to become imbued with them; whereas those who are outside the church cannot do this, because they are ignorant of these truths. Thus the former can profane holy truths, but not the latter (concerning which more may be seen in Part First, n. 1059, 1327, 1328). </p>

 <p>That is born in thy house, and that is bought with thy silver. That this signifies those who are within the church, of both kinds-that is, the celestial, meant by "him that is born in the house," and the spiritual, meant by "him that is bought with silver," was shown above (n. 2048). </p>

 <p>My covenant shall be in your flesh. That this signifies the conjunction of the Lord with man in his impurity, is evident from the signification of a "covenant," as being conjunction (explained above); and from the signification of "flesh," as being what is man's own (also explained above, n. 2041: how impure what is man's own is was also stated there, and was shown in Part First, n. 141, 150, 154, 210, 215, 694, 731, 874-876, 987, 1047). As regards the words "my covenant in your flesh" denoting the conjunction of the Lord with man in his impurity, the case is this: With man there is no pure intellectual truth, that is, truth Divine; for the truths of faith appertaining to man are appearances of truth, to which fallacies of the senses adjoin themselves, and to these the falsities that belong to the cupidities of the love of self and of the world. Such are the truths appertaining to man. How impure these are may be seen from the fact that such things are adjoined to them.  [2] But still the Lord conjoins Himself with man in these impure truths, for He animates and vivifies them with innocence and charity, and thereby forms conscience. The truths of conscience are various, that is, they are according to each person's religion; and these truths, provided they are not contrary to the goods of faith, the Lord will not do violence to, because the man has been imbued with them, and has regarded them as holy. The Lord breaks no one, but bends him, as may be seen from the fact that in every dogma within the church there are some who are being gifted with conscience, which conscience is a better one in proportion as its truths approach more closely to the genuine truths of faith. As conscience is formed from truths of faith of this kind, it is evident that it has been formed in the intellectual part of man, for it is the intellectual part that receives these truths; and therefore the Lord has miraculously separated this part from the will part-an arcanum not previously known, and concerning which see Part First (n. 863, 875, 895, 927, 1023). That a "covenant in your flesh" also denotes what is significative, namely, of purification, is evident from what has been shown in respect to circumcision in n. 2039. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2054.">2054.</a></font></span>
 <p>For an eternal covenant. That this signifies conjunction, is evident from the signification of a "covenant," as being conjunction, explained before. As those are here treated of who are within the church, the "covenant" is again spoken of; and it is here called an eternal covenant, both because it is most especially necessary for those within the church to be "circumcised," that is, purified from the loves of self and of the world (as shown above, n. 2051); and also because with them there is the nearest conjunction of the Lord and His heaven, since this is effected by means of the goods and truths of faith. There is indeed a conjunction with those also who are outside of the church, but a more remote one, because they are not in the goods and truths of faith (as before said, n. 2049). The church, in the Lord's kingdom, is circumstanced as are the heart and lungs in man. Man's interior things are conjoined with his external things by means of the heart and lungs, and from these live all the surrounding viscera. Such also is the case with the human race: the conjunction of the Lord and His heaven is nearest with the church, but more remote with those who are outside of the church, who are circumstanced as are the organs that live by means of the heart and lungs. The celestial are like the heart, and the spiritual are like the lungs. Because of the necessity for the purification of both of these, they who are within the church are here treated of specifically, and the "covenant" is stated twice. </p>

 <p>Verse 14. And the uncircumcised male, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his peoples; he hath made vain My covenant. "The uncircumcised male," signifies one who is not in the truth of faith; "who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin," signifies who is in the love of self and of the world; "that soul shall be cut off from his peoples," signifies eternal death; "he hath made vain My covenant," signifies that he cannot be conjoined. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2056.">2056.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the uncircumcised male. That this signifies one who is not in the truth of faith, is evident from the signification of a "male," as being the truth of faith (see above, n. 2046); the "uncircumcised male" therefore here signifies one who is not in the truth of faith, and who is thereby in what is false. That is said to be "uncircumcised" which obstructs and defiles, as before said. When said of the "male," it is that which obstructs and defiles truth; and in like manner when it is said of any other subject, it signifies the darkening and contamination of that subject. Thus an "uncircumcised ear" is mentioned in Jeremiah:      Upon whom shall I speak and testify, and they will hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken; behold the Word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they do not desire it (Jer. 6:10); their "ear being uncircumcised" means that there was no hearkening, and that the Word was a reproach unto them.  [2] Moreover the verse before us treats of those who are within the church, and who are not only in falsity, but also in the impurity of the loves of self and of the world; for these things are said in continuation of what was said before. It is therefore said "the uncircumcised male, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin," and thus the meaning is falsity conjoined with impurity of life. How great a danger of eternal damnation these are incurring may be seen from what was said above (n. 2051). These words especially signify those within the church who profane the goods and truths of faith, of whom it is said, "that soul shall be cut off from his people;" for these can commit profanation, but not those who are outside the church (as has been shown in Part First, n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2057.">2057.</a></font></span>
 <p>Who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. That this signifies who is in the love of self, is evident from what was said above in regard to the signification of being "circumcised," and of the "foreskin" (n. 2039, 2049, at the end), also as to the signification of "flesh" (n. 2041). The "flesh of the foreskin" here signifies the love of self. Those within the church who are in falsity, and at the same time are in the love of self, are most especially those who profane holy things; but they who are in any other love whatever not so much, for the love of self is the most foul of all, because it is destructive of society, and thus of the human race, as before shown (n. 2045). That it is also diametrically opposed to mutual love, in which heaven consists, and thus is destructive of heavenly order itself, may be seen from the evil spirits and genii in the other life; and also from the hells, in which nothing reigns but the love of self; and because the love of self reigns there, so do all kinds of hatreds, revenges, and cruelties, because these are derived from it.  [2] Mutual love in heaven consists in the fact that they love the neighbor more than themselves, the effect of which is that the whole heaven represents as it were one man; for by means of mutual love all are so consociated by the Lord, and hence it is that the happinesses of all are communicated to each one, and those of each one to all. Consequently the heavenly form is such that everyone is as it were a kind of center, thus a center of communications, and consequently of happinesses, from all; and this in accordance with all the differences of mutual love, which are innumerable. And because those who are in that love perceive the highest happiness in being able to communicate to others that which flows into them, and this from the heart, the communication becomes perpetual and eternal; and on this account, as the Lord's kingdom increases, so the happiness of each angel increases. As the angels are in distinct societies and abodes, they do not think of this; but the Lord thus disposes all things both in general and in particular. Such is the kingdom of the Lord in the heavens.  [3] Nothing else endeavors to destroy this form and this order than the love of self, and therefore all in the other life who are in the love of self are more deeply infernal than others, for the love of self communicates nothing to others, but extinguishes and suffocates their delights and happinesses. Whatever delight flows into them from others, they receive to themselves, concentrate it within themselves, turn it into the filthiness of self, prevent its going any further, and thus destroy all that tends to unanimity and consociation. From this comes disunion, and consequently destruction. And as every such person desires to be served, courted, and adored by others, and loves no one but himself, hence comes dissociation, which is determined and puts itself forth into lamentable states, so that they perceive nothing to be more delightful than to torture others, in direful modes and by phantasies, from hatred, revenge, and cruelty. When such persons come to any society where mutual love resides, they are cast down of their own accord, like impure and dead weights in a pure and living aura, because all the influent delight is terminated in themselves; and because they exhale a foul idea of self, their delight is there turned into a cadaverous stench, by which they are made sensible of the hell of self, besides being seized with terrible anguish.  [4] From this we can see that it is the nature of the love of self to be destructive not only of the human race (as shown above, n. 2045), but also of heavenly order; and thus that there is nothing in it but impurity, filthiness, profaneness, and hell itself; however little this may appear to those who are in it. They are in the love of self who despise others in comparison with themselves, and hate those who do not favor, serve, and pay a kind of worship to them; and who find a cruel delight in revenge, and in depriving others of honor, reputation, wealth, and life. They who are in the love of self are in these evils; and they who are in these evils may know that they are in the love of self.  </p>

 <p>That soul shall be cut off from his peoples. That this signifies eternal death, is evident from the signification of "soul," as being life (n. 1000, 1040, 1742); and from the signification of "peoples," as being truths (see n. 1259, 1260). Thus "peoples" are they who live in truths, that is, angels; and for a "soul to be cut off" from these, is to be damned, or to perish in eternal death. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2059.">2059.</a></font></span>
 <p>He hath made vain My covenant. That this signifies that he cannot be conjoined, is evident from the signification of a "covenant," as being conjunction, explained before. Thus to "make the covenant vain," is to disjoin himself to such an extent that he cannot be conjoined. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2060.">2060.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 15. And God said unto Abraham, Sarai, thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, for Sarah is her name. "God said unto Abraham," signifies perception; "Sarai thy wife," signifies here as before truth conjoined with good; "thou shalt not call her name Sarai," signifies that He will put off the human; "for Sarah is her name," signifies that He will put on the Divine. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2061.">2061.</a></font></span>
 <p>God said unto Abraham. That this signifies perception, is evident from the signification of "God's saying," in the historical sense, as being in the internal sense to perceive (explained before, n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919). As another subject here begins to be treated of, namely, that signified by "Sarai" and "Sarah," and also that signified by the promise of a "son" from Sarah, and by Ishmael's becoming a "great nation," it is introduced by a new perception of the Lord, which is expressed by "God said unto Abraham," as in other places. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2062.">2062.</a></font></span>
 <p>Sarai thy wife. That hereby is signified truth conjoined with good, is evident from the signification of "Sarai," as being intellectual truth; and as "wife" is here added, the meaning is, this truth conjoined with good. (That "Sarai," and "Sarai the wife," signifies truth conjoined with good, has been shown before, n. 1468, 1901, and in several other places.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2063.">2063.</a></font></span>
 <p>Thou shalt not call her name Sarai, for Sarah is her name. That this signifies that He will put off the human, and will put on the Divine, is evident from what was said of Abraham above (verse 5), where occur the words, "thy name shall no more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham," by which in like manner there is signified that He will put off the human, and will put on the Divine (see n. 2009). For the letter H which was added to the name "Sarah," was taken from the name "Jehovah," so that Sarah, like Abraham, should represent the Lord's Divine; and that thus should be represented the Divine marriage of Good with Truth in the Lord-Abraham representing the Divine Good, and Sarah the Divine Truth-from which should be born the Divine Rational, which is Isaac.  [2] The Divine Good, which is Love, and which in regard to the whole human race is Mercy, was the Lord's Internal, that is, Jehovah, who is  itself: this is represented by Abraham. The truth that was to be conjoined with the Divine Good was represented by Sarai; and this truth when also made Divine is represented by Sarah; for the Lord advanced to union with Jehovah successively, as already said. The truth not yet Divine represented by Sarai, was such when it was not yet so united to good as to be truth from good. But when it was so united to good as to proceed from good, it was then Divine; and the truth itself was then also good, because it was the truth of good. The truth which tends to good in order that it may be united to good, is one thing; and that which is so united to good as to proceed wholly from good, is another. The truth which is tending to good still derives something from the human; but that which is wholly united to good has put off all that is human, and has put on the Divine.  [3] This may be illustrated as before, by what is similar with man. When a man is being regenerated, that is, when he is to be conjoined with the Lord, he proceeds to the conjunction by means of truth, that is, by means of the truths of faith; for no one can be regenerated except by means of the knowledges of faith, which are the truths by means of which he proceeds to conjunction. The Lord goes to meet these by means of good, that is, by means of charity, and adjusts and fits this in to the knowledges of faith, that is, to its truths; for all truths are recipient vessels of good, and therefore the more genuine the truths are, and the more they are multiplied, the more abundantly can good accept them as vessels, reduce them to order, and finally manifest itself; so that at last the truths do not appear, except insofar as good shines through them. In this way truth becomes the celestial spiritual.  As the Lord is present solely in the good which is of charity, the man is in this way conjoined with the Lord, and by means of good, that is, by means of charity, is gifted with conscience, from which he afterwards thinks what is true and does what is right; but this conscience is in accordance with the truths and right things into which the good or charity is adjusted and fitted. </p>

 <p>Verse 16. And I will bless her, and I will give thee a son from her also; and I will bless her, and she shall be for nations; kings of peoples shall be from her. "I will bless her," signifies the multiplication of truth; "and I will give thee a son from her also," signifies the rational; "and I will bless her," signifies its multiplication; "and she shall be for nations," signifies the goods thence derived; "kings of peoples shall be from her," signifies truths from the conjoined truths and goods, which are the "kings of peoples." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2065.">2065.</a></font></span>
 <p>I will bless her. That this signifies the multiplication of truth, is evident from the signification of "being blessed," which is to be enriched with all good and truth (see Part First, n. 981, 1096, 1420, 1422). As it is here said to Sarah that God would bless her, the enrichment or multiplication of truth is signified; for by Sarah, as before shown, is represented and signified the truth of good, which is intellectual truth; and this truth and its multiplication are here treated of. (What intellectual truth is may be seen above, n. 1904.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2066.">2066.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I will give thee a son from her also. That this signifies the rational, is evident from the signification of a "son," as being truth (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147); and as all that is rational begins from truth, the rational is here signified by a "son." The Lord's first rational was represented and signified by Ishmael, born of Hagar the handmaid treated of in the preceding chapter (16). The second rational, treated of here, is represented and signified by Isaac who was to be born from Sarah. The former, that is, the rational represented by Ishmael, was the rational that was afterwards expelled from the house; but this second rational, represented by Isaac, is that which remained in the house, because it was Divine. But concerning this rational, of the Lord's Divine mercy we shall speak in the following chapter, where Isaac is treated of.  </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2067.">2067.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I will bless her. That this signifies its multiplication, that is, the multiplication of the rational meant by the "son," is evident from the signification of being "blessed," which is to be enriched with all good and truth (as said just above). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2068.">2068.</a></font></span>
 <p>And she shall be for nations. That this signifies the goods thence derived, is evident from the signification of "nations," as being goods (see Part First, n. 1259, 1260, 1416, 1849). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2069.">2069.</a></font></span>
 <p>Kings of peoples shall be from her. That this signifies truths from the conjoined truths and goods, which are the "kings of peoples," is evident from the signification of "kings," as being in general all truths (see above, n. 2015); and from the signification of "peoples," as also being truths, and in general all things spiritual; for "kings" are predicated of peoples, and not of nations except when nations signify evils (see n. 1259, 1260). In the prophetic Word there is frequent mention of "kings" and "peoples;" but by these are never meant kings and peoples; for in the very Word itself, which is the internal sense, kings and peoples are not treated of at all, but the celestial and spiritual things which belong to the Lord's kingdom, thus goods and truths. The sense of the letter simply furnishes objective forms (as is done by human words) for causing its meaning to be understood.  [2] As it is here said of Sarah that "kings of peoples shall be from her," and as by "Sarah" is signified the Divine truth which the Lord had, it is evident that by "kings of peoples" are signified truths from the conjoined truths and goods, which are all truths of the internal church, or the interior truths of faith. These truths, being from the Lord, are called "kings" in various passages of the Word, and also "king's sons," as shown above (n. 2015).  [3] Everyone can see that some internal Divine thing lies hidden in the words that "kings of peoples shall be from her"- for in this verse Isaac is treated of, and in reference to him it is said, "I will bless her and she shall be for nations;" but of Sarah, that "kings and peoples shall be from her"-and also in nearly the same thing being said of Abraham (verse 6), in that "kings should come forth" from him; but it is not said of him as of Sarah, that "kings of peoples" should be from him. The arcanum that is herein lies too deeply hidden to be unfolded and described in a few words. From the representation and signification of Abraham as being the Divine Good, and from the representation and signification of Sarah as being the Divine Truth, the arcanum is in some measure evident to the effect that all celestial truth will go forth and will be from the Lord's Divine Good, meant by "Abraham;" and that all spiritual truth will go forth and will be from the Lord's Divine Truth, meant by "Sarah." Celestial truth is that which is with the celestial angels, and spiritual truth is that which is with the spiritual angels; or what is the same thing, celestial truth is that which was with the men of the Most Ancient Church, which was before the flood, and which was a celestial church; and spiritual truth is that which was with the men of the Ancient Church, which was after the flood, and which was a spiritual church. For angels, as well as men of the church, are distinguished into the celestial and the spiritual. The celestial are distinguished from the spiritual by love to the Lord; and the spiritual are distinguished from the celestial by love toward the neighbor.  [4] But concerning celestial truth and spiritual truth no more can be said until it is known what the distinction is between the celestial and the spiritual, or what is the same, between the celestial church and the spiritual church (concerning which see Part First, n. 202, 337, 1577; also what was the quality of the Most Ancient Church, and what that of the Ancient Church, n. 597, 607, 640, 765, 1114-1125, and in many other places; and that to have love to the Lord is celestial, and to have love toward the neighbor is spiritual, n. 2023).  [5] These considerations will suffice to open the arcanum that by the "kings" who should go forth from Abraham, spoken of in the sixth verse, are signified the celestial truths that inflow from the Lord's Divine Good; and that by the "kings of peoples" who should be from Sarah, spoken of in the present verse, are signified the spiritual truths that inflow from the Lord's Divine Truth. For the Lord's Divine good cannot inflow except with the celestial man, because it inflows into the will part, as it did in the case of the Most Ancient Church; but the Lord's Divine truth inflows with the spiritual man, because it inflows solely into his intellectual part, which in him has been separated from his will part (see n. 2053, at the end); or what is the same, celestial good inflows with the celestial man, and spiritual good with the spiritual man; and on this account the Lord appears to the celestial angels as a Sun, but to the spiritual as a Moon (see n. 1529, 1530). </p>

 <p>Verse 17. And Abraham fell upon his faces, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall there be born to a son of a hundred years? and shall Sarah that is a daughter of ninety years bear? "Abraham fell upon his faces," signifies adoration; "and laughed," signifies the affection of truth; "and said in his heart," signifies that He so thought; "shall there be born to a son of a hundred years?" signifies that the rational of the Lord's Human Essence should then be united to His Divine Essence; "and shall Sarah that is a daughter of ninety years bear?" signifies that truth conjoined with good will do this. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2071.">2071.</a></font></span>
 <p>Abraham fell upon his faces. That this signifies adoration, is evident from the signification of "falling upon the faces," as being to adore (see above, n. 1999). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2072.">2072.</a></font></span>
 <p>And laughed. That this signifies the affection of truth, may be seen from the origin and essence of laughter, for its origin is nothing but the affection of truth, or else the affection of what is false, from which come the gladness and merriment that in laughter display themselves in the face, which shows that the essence of laughter is nothing else. Laughter is indeed an external thing that belongs to the body because to the face; but in the Word interior things are expressed and signified by exterior things; just as all the interior affections of the mind are expressed and signified by means of the face, interior hearing and obedience being signified by the ear, interior sight or understanding by the eye, power and strength by the hand and arm, and so on, and in the same way the affection of truth by laughter.  [2] In man's rational there is truth, which is its chief characteristic, and there is also the affection of good, but this is in the very affection of truth as its soul. The affection of good which is in the rational does not display itself by means of laughter, but by means of a certain joy and consequent pleasurable delight which does not laugh; for in laughter there is usually something that is not so good. The reason why truth is the chief characteristic in man's rational, is that the rational is formed by means of the knowledges of truth, for by no other means can anyone ever become rational. The knowledges of good are truths, equally as much as are the knowledges of truth.  [3] That "laughter" here signifies the affection of truth, may be seen from its being related that Abraham laughed; and in like manner Sarah, both before Isaac was born, and afterwards; and also from Isaac's being named from "laughter," for the word "Isaac" means "laughter." That Abraham laughed when he heard about Isaac, is evident from this verse, for it is said that Abraham laughed when he heard about a son from Sarah. That Sarah also laughed before Isaac's birth, when she heard from Jehovah that she should bear a son, is told in the words, "When Sarah heard at the door of the tent, Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am grown old shall I have pleasure? and my lord old? And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, and I am become old? Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was, afraid. And He said, Nay, but thou didst laugh" (Gen. 18:12, 13, 15). And later, when Isaac had been born, "Abraham called the name of his son Isaac" (meaning "laughter"); and Sarah said, "God hath made laughter for me; everyone that heareth shall laugh with me" (Gen. 21:3, 6). Unless "laughing" and the name "Isaac," meaning "laughter," involved such things, these matters would never have been related. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2073.">2073.</a></font></span>
 <p>And said in his heart. That this signifies that he so thought, is evident without explication. </p>

 <p>Shall there be born to a son of a hundred years? That this signifies that the rational of the Lord's Human Essence should then be united to the Divine Essence, is evident from the signification of "a hundred" (concerning which see above, n. 1988). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2075.">2075.</a></font></span>
 <p>And shall Sarah that is a daughter of ninety years bear? That this signifies that truth conjoined with good will do this, is evident from the representation and signification of "Sarah," as being truth conjoined with good, that is, truth Divine; and from the signification of the number "ninety," or what is the same, of "nine." One cannot but wonder that the number "a hundred years," which was Abraham's age, signifies that the rational of the Lord's Human Essence should be united to His Divine Essence; and that the number "ninety years," which was Sarah's age, signifies that truth conjoined with good would do this. But as there is nothing in the Lord's Word which is not heavenly and Divine, so must it be with the very numbers contained in it. It was shown in Part First that in the Word all numbers whatever signify actual things, equally as do all the names (see n. 482, 487, 488, 493, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 893, 1988).  [2] Now that the number "nine" signifies conjunction, and still more the number "ninety," which is the product of the multiplication of nine into ten (for "ten" signifies the remains by which conjunction is effected, as is evident from what was said above, n. 1988, at the end), may also be seen from the representatives and significatives which now follow. It was commanded that on the tenth day of the seventh month there should be a day of expiations, and that this should be a Sabbath of a Sabbath; and on the ninth day of the seventh month at evening, from evening even to evening, they should celebrate a Sabbath (Lev. 23:27, 32).  [3] In the internal sense these things signify conjunction by means of remains-"nine" signifying conjunction, and "ten" signifying remains. That a Divine arcanum lies hidden in these numbers, is clearly evident from the months and the days of the year that were to be held holy; as that every seventh day there was a Sabbath; and that every seventh month, as just stated, there should be a Sabbath of a Sabbath; in like manner the seventh year; and also that on the seven times seventh year the jubilee should commence. The case is the same with all other numbers in the Word; as with "three," the signification of which is nearly the same as that of "seven;" and with "twelve," which signifies all things of faith; and with "ten," which signifies the same as "tenths," that is, remains (see n. 576); and so on. Thus in the passage here quoted from Leviticus, unless the number "ten" and the number "nine" involved arcana, it would by no means have been commanded that this Sabbath of a Sabbath should be on the tenth day of the seventh month, and that on the ninth of the month they should celebrate it. Such is the Word of the Lord in the internal sense, although in the historical sense nothing of the kind appears.  [4] In the same way it is related of Jerusalem that it was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar in the ninth year of Zedekiah, and that a breach was made in the eleventh year, on the ninth day of the month; concerning which we read as follows in the second book of Kings:      It came to pass in the ninth year of the reign of Zedekiah, in the tenth month, in the tenth of the month, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah; on the ninth of the month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land, and a breach was made in the city (2 Kings 25:1, 3-4). By the "ninth year" and the "tenth month," and by the "eleventh year" and the "ninth of the month," when the famine prevailed in the city and there was no bread for the people of the land, is signified in the internal sense that there was no longer any conjunction by means of the things of faith and of charity; "famine in the city and no bread for the people of the land," signifies that there was nothing of faith and nothing of charity left. This is the internal sense of these words, which does not at all appear in the letter; and such things shine forth from the historical portions of the Word still less than from the prophetical, because the histories so captivate the mind that it is scarcely believed that anything deeper lies hidden within; when yet all things are representative, and the words themselves are everywhere significative. These things are hard to believe, but still they are true (see n. 1769-1772). </p>

 <p>Verse 18. And Abraham said unto God, Would that Ishmael might live before Thee! "Abraham said unto God," signifies the Lord's perception from love; "Would that Ishmael might live before Thee," signifies that others who are rational from truth should not perish. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2077.">2077.</a></font></span>
 <p>Abraham said unto God. That this signifies the Lord's perception from love, is evident from the signification of "saying unto God," as being to perceive, which has often been explained before. That "Abraham" here signifies the Lord in such a state and at such an age, has been stated above (n. 1989). That the Lord said this from love, is evident, for the affection of love shines forth from the very words when it is said, "Would that Ishmael might live before Thee!" The Lord's affection or love was Divine, being toward the universal human race, which He willed to completely adjoin to Himself, and to save to eternity, by means of the union of His Human Essence with His Divine Essence (concerning which love, see Part First, n. 1735; and that from this love the Lord continually fought against the hells, n. 1690, 1789, 1812; also that in the union of His Human with His Divine, He regarded nothing but the conjunction of the Divine with the human race, n. 2034).  [2] Love such as the Lord had transcends all human understanding, and is in the highest degree incredible to those who do not know what the heavenly love is in which the angels are. To save a soul from hell, the angels would regard death as nothing, nay, if it were possible they would undergo hell for that soul. Hence it is the inmost of their joy to translate into heaven one who is rising from the dead. But they confess that this love is not one whit from themselves, but that all things of it both in general and in particular are from the Lord alone; nay, they manifest irritation if anyone thinks otherwise. </p>

 <p>Would that Ishmael might live before Thee! That this signifies that others who are rational from truth should not perish, is evident from the representation and consequent signification of "Ishmael," as being the rational (explained in the foregoing chapter, where Ishmael is treated of). There are two kinds of men within the church; the spiritual, and the celestial. The spiritual become rational from truth, but the celestial from good. What the distinction between them is may be seen above (n. 2069), and in many places in Part First. The spiritual, who become rational by means of truth, are here meant by "Ishmael;" for "Ishmael" denotes rational truth in its genuine sense, as before shown (n. 1893, 1950, 1951). When this rational truth is being adopted and desired by good, as here by the Lord who is meant by "Abraham," it signifies what is spiritual, thus the spiritual man, or what is the same, the spiritual church, the salvation of which was desired by the Lord from Divine love (see just above, n. 2077). This is expressed by the words, "would that Ishmael might live before Thee." </p>

 <p>Verse 19. And God said, Truly Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaac, and I will set up My covenant with him for an eternal covenant, to his seed after him. "God said," signifies an answer perceived; "truly Sarah thy wife," signifies the Divine truth conjoined with good; "shall bear thee a son," signifies that the rational is from this; "and thou shalt call his name Isaac," signifies the Divine rational; "and I will set up My covenant with him," signifies union; "for an eternal covenant," signifies an eternal union; "to his seed after him," signifies those who should have faith in the Lord. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2080.">2080.</a></font></span>
 <p>God said. That this signifies an answer perceived, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being to perceive (explained just above, n. 2077). And as in the preceding verse we read that "Abraham said," and this signified perception, and as here we read that "God said," or answered, it follows that this signifies an answer perceived, or an answer of perception. In all perception whatever there is both a propounding and a reply. The perception of both of these is here expressed in the historical sense by the words "Abraham said unto God," and "God said." (That "God said" denotes to perceive, may be seen above, n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919; and also in this chapter repeatedly.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2081.">2081.</a></font></span>
 <p>Truly Sarah thy wife. That this signifies Divine truth conjoined with good, is evident from the representation and the consequent signification of "Sarah," as being Divine truth conjoined with good, concerning which above (n. 2063). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2082.">2082.</a></font></span>
 <p>Shall bear thee a son. That this signifies that the rational will be from this conjunction of Divine truth with Divine good, is evident from the signification of a "son," as being truth, here rational truth (also spoken of above, n. 2066). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2083.">2083.</a></font></span>
 <p>And thou shalt call his name Isaac. That this signifies the Divine rational, is evident from the representation of Isaac, and also from the signification of his "name" in the internal sense. First, from the representation of Isaac: Abraham, as said in various places before, represents the Lord's internal man, but Isaac His rational man, and Jacob His natural man. The Lord's internal man was Jehovah Himself. His rational man, because conceived from the influx of His internal man into the affection of memory-knowledges in the external man (see n. 1896, 1902, 1910), was from the Divine thus conjoined with the Human. Hence the first rational, represented by Ishmael, was human; but it was made Divine by the Lord, and then is represented by Isaac. Secondly, from the signification of his "name:" Isaac was named from "laughter;" and as in the internal sense "laughter" signifies the affection of truth, which affection belongs to the rational, as was shown above (n. 2072), "laughter" here signifies the Divine rational.  [2] The Lord from His own power made Divine all that was human with Him; thus not only the rational, but also the interior and the exterior sensuous part, and thereby the body itself. He thus united the Human to the Divine. That not only the rational, but also the sensuous part, and thus the whole body also, was made Divine and Jehovah, has been already shown, and may be seen by everyone from the fact that He alone rose from the dead as to the body, and sits at the right hand of the Divine power both as to all the Divine and as to all the human. To sit at the right hand of the Divine power, signifies to have all sovereign power in heaven and in earth. </p>

 <p>And I will set up My covenant with him for an eternal covenant. That this signifies union, and in fact eternal union, is evident from the signification of a "covenant," as being conjunction; and when it is predicated of the Lord, as being the union of His Divine Essence with His Human Essence, and of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence. (That a "covenant" signifies these things has been shown before, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, and occasionally in this chapter.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2085.">2085.</a></font></span>
 <p>To his seed after him. That this signifies those who should have faith in the Lord, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being faith (explained before, n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 2034). Those are here signified by "seed" who have the faith of love, that is, who have love to the Lord; consequently the celestial, or those who are of the celestial church; for the seed from Isaac is treated of. But they who have the faith of charity, that is, who have charity toward the neighbor-consequently the spiritual, or those who are of the spiritual church-are signified by "Ishmael," who is treated of in the verse that now follows. (What the distinction is between the celestial and the spiritual, may be seen above, n. 2069, 2078; and also what the distinction is between having love to the Lord and having charity toward the neighbor, n. 2023.) </p>

 <p>Verse 20. And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold I will bless him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him very exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. "As for Ishmael, I have heard thee," signifies those who are rational from truth, that they are to be saved; "behold I will bless him," signifies that they would be imbued and gifted; "I will make him fruitful," signifies with the goods of faith; "and will multiply him," signifies with the truths thence derived; "very exceedingly," signifies beyond measure; "twelve princes shall he beget," signifies the primary precepts of the faith which is of charity; "and I will make him a great nation," signifies the fruition of goods and their increase. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2087.">2087.</a></font></span>
 <p>As for Ishmael, I have heard thee. That this signifies those who are rational from truth, that they are to be saved, is evident from the representation of Ishmael in this place, as being those who are rational from truth, or the spiritual (spoken of above, n. 2078); and that they are to be saved, is evident from the signification of "hearing thee," as may be seen without explication. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2088.">2088.</a></font></span>
 <p>Behold I will bless him; and will make him fruitful very exceedingly. That this signifies that they should be imbued and gifted with the goods of faith and with the derivative truths beyond measure, is evident from the signification of being "blessed," of being "fruitful," and of being "multiplied." To be "blessed" signifies to be gifted with all goods (as shown in Part First, n. 981, 1096, 1420, 1422). To be "fruitful" denotes the goods of faith with which they should be gifted; and to be "multiplied" denotes the truths thence derived (as also shown in Part First, n. 43, 55, 913, 983).  [2] Who the celestial are, and who the spiritual, it would be too tedious to describe here, and they have been described already (as may be seen n. 81, 597, 607, 765, 2069, 2078, and in many other places). In general, the celestial are those who have love to the Lord, and the spiritual those who have charity toward the neighbor. (What the distinction is between having love to the Lord, and having charity toward the neighbor, may be seen above, n. 2023.) The celestial are those who are in the affection of good from good; but the spiritual are those who are in the affection of good from truth. In the beginning all were celestial, because they were in love to the Lord; and hence they received perception, by which they perceived good, not from truth, but from the affection of good.  [3] But afterwards, when love to the Lord was no longer such as it had been, spiritual men followed, those men being called spiritual who were in love toward the neighbor, or in charity. But love toward the neighbor, or charity, was implanted by means of truth; and thereby they received conscience, and acted in accordance with it, not from the affection of good, but from the affection of truth. Charity, with the spiritual, appears like the affection of good; but it is the affection of truth. From this appearance, charity is still called good; but it is the good of their faith. These are they who are meant by the Lord in John: I am the door; by Me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture I am the good shepherd and I know Mine own, and am known of Mine; and other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd (John 10:9, 14, 16). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2089.">2089.</a></font></span>
 <p>Twelve princes shall he beget. That this signifies the primary precepts which are of charity, is evident from the signification of "twelve," as being all things of faith; and from the signification of "princes," as being primary things. "King" and "princes" are mentioned in various parts of the Word; but in the internal sense they never signify king or princes, but the primary things of the matter in connection with which they are mentioned. (That "kings" signify truths in one complex has been already shown, n. 2015; also that "princes" are the primaries of truth, which are precepts, n. 1482.) Hence the angels-in fact the spiritual angels-are called "principalities," because they are in truths. The term "princes" is predicated from the truths which are of charity; for, as before said (n. 1832), the spiritual, by means of the truths that appear to them as truths, receive charity from the Lord, and through this, conscience.  [2] That "twelve" signifies all the things of faith, has been hitherto unknown to the world; and yet whenever the number "twelve" occurs in the Word, whether in the historic or the prophetic part, it signifies nothing else. By the "twelve sons" of Jacob, and derivatively by the "twelve tribes" named from them, the same is signified; and also by the "twelve disciples" of the Lord. Each son of Jacob, and each of the twelve disciples, represented an essential and primary of faith. (What was represented by each son of Jacob, and so by each tribe, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be told in what follows, where the sons of Jacob are treated of, Gen. 29 and 30.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2090.">2090.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I will make him a great nation. That this signifies the fruition of goods and their increase, is evident from the signification of "nations," as being goods (explained in Part First, n. 1159, 1258-1260, 1416, 1849); and therefore to "make a great nation," here signifies both the fruition and the increase of goods. </p>

 <p>Verse 21. And My covenant will I set up with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the following year. "My covenant will I set up with Isaac," signifies union with the Divine rational; "whom Sarah shall bear unto thee," signifies the Divine truth conjoined with Good, from which it will come forth; "at this set time in the following year," signifies a state of union then. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2092.">2092.</a></font></span>
 <p>My covenant will I set up with Isaac. That this signifies union with the Divine rational, is evident from the signification of a "covenant," as being union (explained before); and from the representation of "Isaac," as being the Divine rational (spoken of above, n. 2083). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2093.">2093.</a></font></span>
 <p>Whom Sarah shall bear unto thee. That this signifies the Divine truth conjoined with the Divine good, from which it will come forth, is evident from the representation of "Sarah," as being the Divine truth (spoken of before, n. 2063, 2081); and from the representation of "Abraham," as being the Divine good (treated of, n. 2063, and in several other places).  [2] How the Lord's first rational was conceived and born, has been stated in the foregoing chapter, where "Ishmael" is treated of, by whom that rational was represented. But here, and also in the following chapter, that rational is treated of which was made Divine by the Lord, and this by the conjunction, as by marriage, of the Divine good with the Divine truth. The first rational cannot be conceived otherwise than by the influx of the internal man into the affection of memory-knowledges in the external man; nor can it be born otherwise than from the affection of memory-knowledges, which was represented by Hagar, Sarah's handmaid (as shown in the preceding chapter, n. 1896, 1902, 1910, etc.).  [3] But the second or Divine rational is not conceived and born in this way, but by means of the conjunction of the truth of the internal man with the good of the same, and the influx thence derived. With the Lord this was effected of His own proper power from the Divine itself, that is, from Jehovah. As has been repeatedly stated above, His internal man was Jehovah; and the good itself that was represented by Abraham belonged to His internal man, as also did the truth itself that was represented by Sarah, and therefore both were Divine. From this source therefore was the Lord's Divine rational conceived and born; and in fact from the influx of the good into the truth, and thus by means of the truth; for the chief characteristic of the rational is truth (as before said, n. 2072). On this account it is here said, "whom Sarah shall bear unto thee," which signifies Divine truth conjoined with Good, from which that Divine rational will come forth; and above (at verse 17) it was said that Sarah was a "daughter of ninety years," which signifies that the truth conjoined with good shall do this.  [4] With every man whatever because he has been created in the likeness and image of God, the like, but not the equal of this takes place, that is to say, his first rational is also conceived and born by means of the influx of his internal man into the life of the affection of memory-knowledges in his external man; but his second rational, from the influx of the good and truth from the Lord through his internal man. This second rational he receives from the Lord when he is being regenerated, for he then perceives in his rational what the good and the truth of faith are. In man the internal man is above his rational, and is the Lord's (see n. 1889, 1940). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2094.">2094.</a></font></span>
 <p>In the preceding chapter, and up to this point in the present one, the subject has been the conception and birth of the rational that appertained to the Lord; and how it was made Divine is also treated of in what follows. But some may suppose that to know these things does not conduce much to faith, provided it is known that the Lord's Human Essence was made Divine, and that the Lord is God as to both the Human Essence and the Divine Essence. But the case is this: They who in simplicity believe this to be so, do not need to know how it was effected, for knowing how it was effected is simply for the end that they may believe it to be so.  [2] But at the present day there are many who believe nothing unless they know from reason that it is so, as may be clearly seen from the fact that few believe in the Lord, although they confess Him with the lips because this is according to the doctrine of faith. Yet still they say to themselves and to one another that if they knew it could be so they would believe. The reason why they do not believe and yet say this, is that the Lord was born as are other men, and in the external form was like others. These persons cannot possibly receive any faith unless they first comprehend in some measure how it can be so, and this is why these things have been explained. They who believe the Word in simplicity have no need to know all these things, for they are already in the end to which the others just described cannot come except by a knowledge [cognitio] of such things.  [3] Moreover these are the things that are contained in the internal sense, and the internal sense is the Word of the Lord in the heavens, and is so perceived by those who are there. When a man is in the truth, that is, in the internal sense, he can make one as to thought with those in heaven, even though he may be in a relatively very general and obscure idea. The celestial in heaven, who are in faith itself, look at these things from good, and see that they are so; but the spiritual look at them from truth and are also confirmed, and thus perfected, by such things as are contained in the internal sense; but this by thousands of interior reasons which cannot flow perceptibly into man's idea. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2095.">2095.</a></font></span>
 <p>At this set time in the following year. That this signifies a state of union then, is evident from what has been said concerning the age of Abraham, in that he was a "son of a hundred years;" and concerning that of Sarah, in that she was a "daughter of ninety years," when Isaac was to be born; by which was signified that the rational of the Lord's Human Essence would then be united to His Divine Essence, and that truth conjoined with good would effect this (concerning which see above, n. 1988, 2074, 2075). So that the "following year" is a state of union. </p>

 <p>Verse 22. And He left off speaking with him; and God went up from over Abraham. "He left off speaking with him," signifies the end of this perception; "and God went up from over Abraham," signifies the Lord's entrance into the former state. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2097.">2097.</a></font></span>
 <p>He left off speaking with him. That this signifies the end of this perception, is evident from the signification of "speaking" and "saying," as being in the internal sense to perceive (concerning which several times before); and therefore to "leave off speaking" is to be no longer in such perception. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2098.">2098.</a></font></span>
 <p>And God went up from over Abraham. That this signifies the Lord's entrance into the former state, follows from what has been said, and therefore without explication. That during His life in the world the Lord had two states, one of humiliation, and the other of glorification, has been shown before (n. 1603, 2033); and as He had two states, it is evident that He had two states of perception. He was in a state of glorification, that is, of union of the Human with the Divine, when He perceived the things that are contained in the internal sense of this chapter up to this point; but that He was no longer in such perception is expressed by the words, "He left off speaking with him, and God went up from over Abraham." </p>

 <p>Verse 23. And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his silver, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God spoke with him. "Abraham took Ishmael his son," signifies those who are truly rational; "and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his silver, and every male among the men of Abraham's house," signifies here as before those who are within the church, with whom the truths of faith are being conjoined with goods; "and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin," signifies their purification and righteousness from the Lord; "in the selfsame day," signifies the state that has been spoken of; "as God spoke with him" signifies in accordance with the perception. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="2100.">2100.</a></font></span>
 <p>Abraham took Ishmael his son. That this signifies those who are truly rational, is evident from the signification of "Ishmael," as being those who are rational from truth, that is, the spiritual (see n. 2078, 2087, 2088). </p>
