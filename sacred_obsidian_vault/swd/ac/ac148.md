 <p>Behold I will smite all thy border with frogs. That this signifies reasonings from mere falsities, is evident from the signification of "frogs," as being reasonings; that they are from mere falsities is signified by their "creeping forth from the river," as presently follows (that the "river of Egypt" denotes falsity, see n. 6693, 7307), and because it is said that "all the border should be smitten with them." By these words is also signified that the reasonings shall not be from falsified truths, but from mere falsities, because reasonings from falsified truths are finally turned into blasphemies against truth and good; and moreover the truths themselves reject the falsification, because they cannot be together with falsities; and so long as they are, they fight with them, and at last loosen and separate themselves from them. Hence it is that after a man has falsified truths, he at last wholly denies them; otherwise falsities would have dominion over truths. From this it is that after the evil in the other life have been cast into hell, they are not allowed to reason from falsified truths, but from mere falsities. [2] That "frogs" denote reasonings from falsities, is evident in John:      I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, like frogs; for they are the spirits of demons, working signs to go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God Almighty (Rev. 16:13-14); that "frogs" denote reasonings from falsities against truths, is plain from the details of this passage, for it is said that "they went out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet;" also that "they went forth unto the kings of the earth, to gather them together unto war." The "kings of the earth" denote the truths of the church (that "kings" denote truths, and in the opposite sense falsities, see n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581, 4966, 5044, 5068, 6148; and that the "earth" denotes the church, n. 662, 1067, 1262, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355, 4447, 4535, 5577; also that "war" denotes spiritual combat, n. 2686, thus combat against the truths and goods of faith). From this it is plain that "frogs" denote reasonings from falsities against truths. [3] And in David:      He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish; He caused frogs to creep forth on their land, in the chambers of their kings (Ps. 105:29-30); it is said "in the chambers of their kings" because there is meant reasoning against truths from falsities; "the chambers of kings" denote interior truths, and in the opposite sense interior falsities. (That "kings" denote truths, and in the opposite sense falsities, see just above.) </p>

 <p>And the river shall make frogs to creep forth. That this signifies that there will be reasonings from these falsities, is evident from the signification of "the river of Egypt," as being falsity (see n. 6693, 7307); and from the signification of "frogs," as being reasonings (as above, n. 7351). That "frogs" denote reasonings is because they are in waters, where they make a chattering noise and croak, and are also among things unclean. What reasoning from mere falsities is, shall be illustrated by some examples. That man reasons from mere falsities who attributes all things to nature, and scarcely anything to the Divine; when yet all things are from the Divine, and nature is only the instrumental means by which the Divine works. He reasons from mere falsities who believes that man is like a beast, only more perfect, because he can think; and thus that man will die like a beast; by thus denying the conjunction of man with the Divine through the thought which is of faith, and the affection which is of love, and hence his resurrection and life eternal, such a man speaks from mere falsities. In like manner is he who believes that there is no hell. And also he who believes that all a man has is the delight of this world's life, and therefore he must enjoy this, because when he dies, he dies altogether. He reasons from mere falsities who believes that all things depend upon his own sagacity, and on fortune; and not on the Divine Providence, except such as is universal. And also he who believes that religion is good for nothing except to keep the simple in bonds. Especially do they reason from mere falsities who believe that the Word is not Divine. In short, all those reason from mere falsities who utterly deny truths Divine. </p>

 <p>And they shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber. That this signifies that they shall fill the mind, even to its interiors, is evident from the signification of a "house," as being the mind of man (see n. 3538, 4973, 5023); and from the signification of a "bedchamber" as being the interiors of the mind. That "bed-chambers" denote the interiors of the mind is because they are in the inner part of the house. By "chambers" are signified things interior, and by "bed-chambers" things still more interior, in the following passages:      Go, My people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut the door after thee; hide thyself as for a little moment, until the anger be overpast (Isa. 26:20).      He said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the sons of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his image (Ezek. 8:12).      Without shall the sword bereave, and terror from the chambers (Deut 32:25).      Elisha the prophet that is in Israel telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber (2 Kings 6:12). The ancients compared the mind of man to a house, and those things which are within man to chambers. The human mind is indeed like this; for the things therein are distinct, scarcely otherwise than as a house is divided into its chambers; those things which are in the middle are like the inmost parts; those which are at the sides are like the outer parts, these being compared to the courts; and those which while outside are connected with the inside parts, being compared to the porches. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7354.">7354.</a></font></span>
 <p>And upon thy bed. That this signifies to the inmosts, is evident from the signification of a "bed," as being that which is inmost; for when the bedchambers denote the interior things, the couch or bed which is therein denotes that which is inmost. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7355.">7355.</a></font></span>
 <p>And into the house of thy servants and of thy people. That this signifies all things that are in the natural, is evident from the signification of a "house," as being the mind of man, and as it is said of the Egyptians, and of the servants of Pharaoh, it denotes the natural mind (that a "house" denotes the mind, see just above, n. 7353); and from the signification of "the servants and people of Pharaoh," as being all things in the natural, the things there which serve for confirming falsities being called "servants." (That "people" is said of truths, and in the opposite sense of falsities, see n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 3581, 4619, 6451, 6465.) From this it is evident that by "into the house of the servants and of the people of Pharaoh" is signified into all things that are in the natural. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7356.">7356.</a></font></span>
 <p>And into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs. That this signifies into the delights of cupidities is evident from the signification of "ovens" as being exterior goods, because in them the bread is made ready, and exterior goods are those which are in the natural, and are commonly called delights; for when the interior goods which are of the loves and their affections flow into the natural, they are felt there as delights. These are signified by "ovens" in a good sense; but in the opposite sense, as here, by "ovens" are signified the delights of cupidities, that is, delights from the loves of hell, which are the loves of self and of the world. And from the signification of "kneading-troughs" as being also the delights of cupidities in the natural, but still more external, because kneading-troughs are vessels in which dough is prepared for bread. By reasonings entering into the delights of cupidities is meant that it would be the delight of their life to reason from falsities, and thus to deceive and seduce others. It is moreover one of the chief delights of the evil to spread falsities, to confirm them, to deride truths, and especially to seduce others. [2] That an "oven" denotes the delight of the affections which are of charity and faith, and in the opposite sense the delight of the cupidities which are of the love of self and the love of the world, is plain in Hosea:      They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; the stirrer ceaseth from kneading his dough; when they turn their mind like an oven in their lying in wait; their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as flames of fire. They were all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all the kings thereof fall (Hos. 7:4, 6-7); "an oven" denotes the delights of the cupidities which are of evils; "burning," "being hot," "flames of fire," denote the cupidities themselves. (That "fire" denotes the yearning of evil, see n. 1297, 1861, 2446, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, 7324e.) "They devour their judges, all their kings fall" denotes that goods and truths perish. Everyone can see that without an internal sense such as this, it cannot be known what is here meant by "all the adulterers are as an oven heated by the baker, all grow hot as an oven, they devour the judges, and their kings fall." [3] "Oven" is used in a good sense in Isaiah:      The saying of Jehovah whose hearth is in Zion, and His oven in Jerusalem (Isa. 31:9); where "Zion" denotes the celestial church, thus the good of love which is of this church; "Jerusalem," the spiritual church, thus the good of this love, which is the good of charity and of the derivative faith. In this passage "oven" denotes the interior delight of the affections of good and truth; and this because the bread which is baked in an oven signifies the good of celestial and spiritual love (that "bread" signifies this, see n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 5915). And as the signification of an "oven" comes from this, therefore the bread which was prepared in an oven for the sacrifices, and was called a "meat-offering," was distinguished from the meat-offering that was prepared in a pan, and from the meat-offering that was prepared in a cooking pot (see Lev. 2:4-5, 7); it was varieties of the good of love that were hereby signified. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7357.">7357.</a></font></span>
 <p>And on thee, and of thy people and on all thy servants shall the frogs come up. That this signifies that reasonings from falsities shall be in all things both in general and in particular is evident from what was said above (n. 7355); all and each of those who were in the land of Egypt are signified by "Pharaoh, his people, and his servants," thus falsities in general and in particular. That by "Pharaoh and the Egyptians" are signified falsities has been often shown above. Be it known that they who are in hell, and who have been deprived of the truths which they had known in the world, cannot do otherwise than speak falsities; and therefore when any such infernal speaks, as when they appear in the world of spirits, it is at once known that what he speaks is false. This is known to the upright in the other life from common experience. That they speak nothing but what is false, is clear also from the words of the Lord in John:      Ye are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father ye will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because the truth is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh from his own; because he is the speaker of a lie, and the father of it (John 8:44); for everyone speaks according to the affection of his love, and no one can speak contrary to it, except from dissimulation, hypocrisy, fraud, and deceit, as is the case with the evil when they speak truths. But these truths which they so speak, are nevertheless falsities with them. But on the other hand, they who are in truth from good cannot but speak truths. </p>

 <p>ON THE INHABITANTS AND SPIRITS OF THE PLANET MARS. Like all the rest of the planets, the planet Mars appears in the idea of spirits and angels constantly in its own place, and in fact to the left in front, at some distance in the plane of the breast, and thus outside the sphere in which are the spirits of our earth. The spirits of one earth are separated from the spirits of another earth, because the spirits of each earth have reference to some special province in the Grand Man, and thence are in another and diverse state; and diversity of state causes them to appear separate from one another, either to the right or to the left, at a greater or a less distance. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7359.">7359.</a></font></span>
 <p>Spirits from thence came to me, and applied themselves to my left temple, and there breathed on me with their speech, but I did not understand it. It was soft in its flow, nor do I remember ever to have perceived a softer, it being like the softest aura. It breathed first upon the left temple, and the left ear from above; and the breathing extended thence to the left eye, and by little and little to the right, and then flowed downward, especially from the left eye, to the lips; and when it was at the lips, it entered through the mouth, and by a way within the mouth, in fact by the Eustachian tube, into the brain. When the breathing came thither, I then understood their speech, and it was given me to talk with them. While they were talking with me I observed that my lips moved, and my tongue also a little, because of the correspondence of interior speech with exterior. Exterior speech is that of articulate sound falling toward the external membrane of the ear, and thence by means of little organs, membranes, and fibers, which are within the ear, being conveyed to the brain. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7360.">7360.</a></font></span>
 <p>From all this it was given me to know that the speech of the inhabitants of Mars is different from the speech of the inhabitants of our earth. That is to say, it was not sonorous, but almost silent, insinuating itself into the interior hearing and sight by a shorter way. And being of this nature, it was fuller and more perfect, fuller of the ideas of thought, thus approaching more nearly the speech of spirits and angels. Moreover, the very affection of the speech is represented with them in the face, and its thought in the eyes; for with them, thought and speech, and also affection and face, act as a one. They regard it as wicked to think one thing and speak another, and to will one thing and show another in the face. They do not know what hypocrisy is, or what fraudulent deceit and dissimulation are. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7361.">7361.</a></font></span>
 <p>That such also was the speech of the most ancient people on this earth, has been given to me to know by conversation with some of them (see n. 607, 608). To make the matter clearer, I may again relate what has been given to me to know from experience about the speech of the most ancient of this earth; as follows. "There was shown me by a certain influx which I cannot describe, what was the nature of the speech of those who were of the Most Ancient Church, namely, that it was not articulate, like the vocal speech of our time, but tacit; and was produced not by external but by internal respiration. It was also granted me to notice the nature of their internal respiration, that it advanced from the navel toward the heart, and so through the lips, without sound, when they spoke; and that it did not enter into the ear of another by an external way, and strike upon what is called the drum of the ear; but by a certain internal way, and in fact by a way there which is now called the Eustachian tube.  [2] It was shown me that by such speech they could much more fully express the sentiments of the mind and the ideas of thought, than can possibly be done by articulate sounds or sonorous words, which likewise are directed by the respiration, but external; for there is no vocal word, nor anything in a vocal word, which is not directed by applications of the respiration. But with them this is done much more perfectly, because by internal respiration, which, being more interior, is also more perfect, and more applicable and conformable to the very ideas of thought. Moreover, they express themselves by slight movements of the lips, and corresponding changes of the face; for as they had been celestial men, whatever they thought shone forth from their faces and eyes, which were varied conformably; the face as to form and life, the eyes as to light. They could not possibly put on an expression of countenance that was not in agreement with what they were thinking. Simulation, and still more deceit, were to them a monstrous crime (n. 1118). As their speech was of this nature, and they had internal respiration, they could be in company with angels. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7362.">7362.</a></font></span>
 <p>The respiration of the spirits of the planet Mars has also been communicated to me (that spirits and angels breathe, see n. 3884-3894); and it was perceived that their respiration was interior, proceeding from the region of the chest toward the navel, and thence rolling itself upward through the breast, with an imperceptible breathing toward the mouth. From these and other proofs of experience it was made evident to me that they were of a celestial genius, and thus not unlike those who were of the Most Ancient Church on this earth. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7363.">7363.</a></font></span>
 <p>They spoke with me about the life of the inhabitants in their earth, in that they are not under commands, but are distinguished into larger and smaller societies, and that they there associate with themselves such as agree with them in disposition. This they know at once from the face and speech, in which they are rarely deceived, and then they are forthwith friends. But they feel no aversion to others, for they have no aversion, still less hatred. They also said that their consociations are delightful, and that they converse together about what is being done in the societies, especially what is being done in heaven; for many of them have open communication with the angels in heaven. This is easy to believe, as they are of such a nature and so associated, that their societies, taken together through that earth, represent a general angelic society. The societies there are all various, but the Lord conjoins them all by the heavenly form, so as to be a one; for a one is made of various particulars suitably arranged into a form. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7364.">7364.</a></font></span>
 <p>Those in their societies who begin to think wrongly, and thence to will wrongly, are separated, and left to themselves alone, whence they lead a most wretched life out of all society, in rocks or other places, for they are no longer cared for by the rest. Certain societies endeavor to drive such persons to repentance by various methods; but when this fails, they separate themselves from them. In this way they take care lest the lust of dominion and of gain should creep in, that is, lest any from the lust of dominion should subject to themselves the society in which they are, and then others; and lest any from the lust of gain should despoil others of their goods. Everyone on that earth lives content with his goods, and everyone content with his honor in being called just and a lover of his neighbor. This delight and tranquillity of mind would perish, unless those who think and will evilly were cast out, and unless they prudently and severely met the first beginnings of the love of self and the love of the world with those into whom they enter; for it was these loves which out of societies made empires and kingdoms, within which there are few who do not desire to domineer, and to possess all the property of others; there being few who do what is just and equitable from justice and equity, and still fewer who do what is good from charity, and what is true from faith, and not rather from fear of the law, of injury, of life, or of the loss of gain, honor, and reputation on account of these. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7365.">7365.</a></font></span>
 <p>The subject of the inhabitants and spirits of the planet Mars will be continued at the end of the following chapter. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7366.">7366.</a></font></span>
 <p>Exodus 8 THE DOCTRINE OF CHARITY It was said above that the loves of self and of the world make hell with man; and now the quality of these loves is to be told, in order that a man may know whether he is in them, and consequently whether hell or heaven is in him; for in man himself is either hell or heaven. That the kingdom of God is within man, the Lord teaches in Luke 17:21; consequently hell also is within him. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7367.">7367.</a></font></span>
 <p>The love of self reigns with a man, that is, he is in the love of self, when in what he thinks and does, he does not regard his neighbor, thus not the public, still less the Lord, but only himself and those who belong to him; consequently when he does all things for the sake of himself and those who belong to him; and if for the sake of the public and his neighbor, it is merely for the sake of the appearance. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7368.">7368.</a></font></span>
 <p>It is said "for the sake of himself and those who belong to him," because he together with these, and these together with him, make a one; just as when anyone does anything for the sake of his wife, of his children, grandchildren, sons-in-law, or daughters-in-law, he does it for the sake of himself, because they are his. In like manner one who does anything for the sake of relatives and of friends who favor his love and thereby conjoin themselves with him; for by such conjunction they make one with him, that is, regard themselves in him, and him in themselves. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7369.">7369.</a></font></span>
 <p>Insofar as a man is in the love of self, so far he removes himself from the love of the neighbor; consequently insofar as a man is in the love of self, so far he removes himself from heaven, for in heaven there is the love of the neighbor. From this it also follows that insofar as man is in the love of self, so far he is in hell, for in hell there is the love of self. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7370.">7370.</a></font></span>
 <p>That man is in the love of self who despises his neighbor in comparison with himself, who regards him as his enemy if he does not favor and reverence him; he is still more in the love of self who therefore hates and persecutes his neighbor; and he still more who therefore burns with revenge against him and desires his destruction. Such persons at last love to rage against their neighbor; and the same, if they are also adulterers, become cruel. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7371.">7371.</a></font></span>
 <p>The delight which these men perceive in such things is the delight of the love of self. This delight in a man is infernal delight. Everything that is according to love is delightful; and therefore the quality of the love can be known from the delight. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7372.">7372.</a></font></span>
 <p>From what has now been described (n. 7370), as a test, it is known who are in the love of self. It matters not how they appear in the outward form, whether pretentious or unassuming; for such they are in the interior man; and the interior man is at this day hidden by most people, and the exterior is trained to make a show of love of the public and the neighbor, thus for contrary things; and this also for the sake of self and for the sake of the world. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7373.">7373.</a></font></span>
 <p>But the love of the world reigns with a man, that is, a man is in the love of the world, when in what he thinks and does he regards and intends nothing but his own advantage, not caring whether this involves harm to his neighbor and to the public. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7374.">7374.</a></font></span>
 <p>Those are in the love of the world who desire to possess themselves of the goods of others by artful devices, and still more those who do this by cunning and deceit. They who are in this love envy others their goods, and covet them; and insofar as they do not fear the laws, they take them away, even by robbery. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7375.">7375.</a></font></span>
 <p>These two loves increase insofar as the reins are given them, and insofar as the man is borne along into them; and at last they increase beyond measure, so that they desire to govern not only all things in their own kingdom, but also what is beyond, even to the ends of the earth; nay, these loves when unbridled ascend even to the God of the universe, that is, to such a height that they who are in them wish to climb to the throne of God, and to be worshiped instead of God Himself, according to what is written in Isaiah concerning Lucifer, by whom are meant those who are in these loves, and are called "Babel":      Thou saidst in thine heart, I will ascend into the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the cloud, and become like the Most High. Yet thou shalt be cast down to hell (Isa. 14:13-15). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7376.">7376.</a></font></span>
 <p>From all this it can now be seen that these two loves are the origins of all evils, for they are diametrically opposed to love toward the neighbor, and to love to the Lord; thus diametrically opposed to heaven, where love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor reign. Consequently it is these loves, namely, the love of self and the love of the world, that make hell with man, for these two loves reign in hell. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7377.">7377.</a></font></span>
 <p>But they are not in these loves who aspire to honors not for the sake of themselves, but for the sake of their country; and who aspire to wealth not for the sake of wealth, but for the sake of the necessaries of life, both for themselves and for their families, also for the sake of the good use on account of which the wealth delights them. With such persons honors and riches are means of imparting benefits.            EXODUS 8      1. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.      2. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.      3. And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments, and caused frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.      4. And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Supplicate ye unto Jehovah that He remove the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Jehovah.      5. And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Have thou honor over me, till when shall I supplicate for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to cut off the frogs from thee, and from thy houses? Only in the river shall they be left.      6. And he said, Unto the morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like Jehovah our God.      7. And the frogs shall be removed from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; only in the river shall they be left.      8. And Moses and Aaron went out from before Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto Jehovah upon the word of the frogs which He had laid on Pharaoh.      9. And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.      10. And they gathered them together in heaps and heaps; and the land stank.      11. And Pharaoh saw that there was breathing, and he made heavy his heart, and heard them not, as Jehovah had spoken.      12. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, and it shall become lice in all the land of Egypt.      13. And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the land, and there was louse on man and on beast; all the dust of the land became louse in all the land of Egypt.      14. And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, and they could not; and there was louse on man and on beast.      15. And the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God; and Pharaoh's heart was made firm, and he heard them not, as Jehovah had spoken.      16. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he goeth forth unto the waters; and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let My people go, that they may serve Me.      17. For if thou let not My people go, behold I send against thee, and against thy servants, and against thy people, and into thy houses, the noisome fly; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with the noisome fly, and also the land whereon they are.      18. And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, upon which My people stand, that no noisome fly be there; to the end that thou mayest know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the land.      19. And I will set redemption between My people and thy people; unto the morrow shall this sign be.      20. And Jehovah did so; and there came the grievous noisome fly into the house of Pharaoh, and into the house of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt; the land was destroyed from before the noisome fly.      21. And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.      22. And Moses said, It is not meet to do so, for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God; lo, we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians unto their eyes, and will they not stone us?      23. We will go a way of three days into the wilderness, and will sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as He hath said unto us.      24. And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, and ye shall sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away; supplicate for me.      25. And Moses said, Behold I go forth from thee, and I will supplicate unto Jehovah that He may remove the noisome fly from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only let not Pharaoh mock anymore in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah.      26. And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and he supplicated unto Jehovah.      27. And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and He removed the noisome fly from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there was not one left.      28. And Pharaoh made heavy his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go. </p>

 <p>THE CONTENTS.      In this chapter, in the internal sense, the subject is continued of the vastation of those who are in falsities, and who infest the upright in the other life. The first two degrees of vastation were described in the preceding chapter, also the third degree in part, which was that they reasoned only from mere falsities. Reasonings from mere falsities are signified by "the frogs;" which subject is continued in this chapter; and then the fourth and fifth degrees of the vastation of those who are in falsities and infest the upright in the other life are treated of. The fourth degree is that they were in evils which destroyed every good with them, also whatever they had from natural good; these are signified by the lice from the dust of the land. The fifth degree is that they were in falsities from these evils, whereby every truth would be destroyed; these are signified by the noisome fly. </p>

 <p>THE INTERNAL SENSE Verses 1-10. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments, and caused frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Supplicate ye unto Jehovah, that He remove the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Jehovah. And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Have thou honor over me, till when shall I supplicate for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to cut off the frogs from thee, and from thy houses? Only in the river shall they be left. And he said, Unto the morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like Jehovah our God. And the frogs shall be removed from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; only in the river shall they be left. And Moses and Aaron went out from before Pharaoh and Moses cried unto Jehovah upon the word of the frogs which He had laid on Pharaoh. And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields. And they gathered them together in heaps and heaps; and the land stank. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies instruction; "Say unto Aaron," signifies the influx of the internal law into the external law; "Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod," signifies the power of internal truth through external truth; "over the streams, over the rivers, and over the pools," signifies against falsities; "and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt," signifies reasonings from mere falsities; "and Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt," signifies the effect of the power of internal truth through external truth against falsities; "and the frogs came up," signifies reasonings from mere falsities; "and covered the land of Egypt," signifies that the natural mind was made such; "and the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments," signifies the abuse of Divine order, whence there was the like in the outward form; "and caused frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt," signifies in respect to reasonings from the natural mind; "and Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron," signifies the presence of the law Divine; "and said, Supplicate ye unto Jehovah," signifies humiliation from weariness; "that He remove the frogs from me, and from my people," signifies that they should not be driven to reasoning from mere falsities; "and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Jehovah," signifies that they would then leave those who were of the spiritual church so that they may worship their God; "and Moses said unto Pharaoh," signifies the answer; "Have thou honor upon me," signifies that the law Divine ought to be trusted; "till when shall I supplicate for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people," signifies intercession for those who are in falsities and infest; "to cut off the frogs from thee, and from thy houses," signifies that the reasonings may cease; "only in the river shall they be left," signifies that they should remain with falsities where these are; "and he said, Unto the morrow," signifies forever; "and he said, Be it according to thy word," signifies confirmation thence; "that thou mayest know that there is none like Jehovah our God," signifies that there is one God, and none besides Him; "and the frogs shall be removed from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people," signifies that they should not be driven to reason from mere falsities; "only in the river shall they be left," signifies that they should remain with falsities where these are; "and Moses and Aaron went out from before Pharaoh," signifies separation from those who had reasoned from mere falsities; "and Moses cried unto Jehovah upon the word of the frogs which He had laid on Pharaoh," signifies intercession; "and Jehovah did according to the word of Moses," signifies that it was so done according to the word of the Lord; "and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields," signifies that reasonings from mere falsities ceased with them everywhere in the natural; "and they gathered them together in heaps and heaps," signifies that these reasoning falsities were arranged in bundles in the natural; "and the land stank," signifies what was foul and loathsome therefrom. </p>

 <p>And Jehovah said unto Moses. That this signifies instruction is evident from the signification of "saying" as being instruction (see n. 7186, 7304). The signification in the historical parts of the Word of "to say" appears from the things which follow it, for it enfolds these within it. That it here signifies instruction, is because what was further to be done is "said by Jehovah." Moreover, Moses represents the law Divine, by which instruction from Jehovah is given. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7381.">7381.</a></font></span>
 <p>Say unto Aaron. That this signifies the influx of the internal law into the external law, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being the law Divine (see n. 6723, 6752); and from the representation of Aaron, as being the doctrine of good and truth (n. 6998, 7089); the doctrine of good and truth which Aaron represents is nothing else than the external law coming forth from the internal law, that is, through the internal law from the Divine; and from the signification of "saying," as being influx (n. 6152, 6291, 7291). That "to say" here denotes influx is because Moses was to say to Aaron, and Moses is the internal law, and Aaron the external, and influx from the Divine takes place through the internal into the external. The internal law is the truth Divine itself such as it is in heaven, and the external law is the truth Divine such as it is on earth; thus the internal law is truth accommodated to angels, and the external law is truth accommodated to men. [2] As the internal law which Moses represents is truth accommodated to angels, and the external law which Aaron represents is truth accommodated to men, I may here say something about them. Truth accommodated to angels is for the most part incomprehensible to men, as is evident from the fact that things are seen and said in heaven such as eye has never seen, nor ear has ever heard. The reason is that the things said among the angels are spiritual things which have been abstracted from natural things, and consequently are remote from the ideas and expressions of human speech; for man has formed his ideas from the things in nature, and indeed in grosser nature, that is, from those which he has seen in the world and upon the earth, and has touched by sense, which things are material. The ideas of interior thought with man, although they are above material things, nevertheless terminate in material things, and where they terminate, there they appear to be, and from this he perceives that which he is thinking. Hence it is evident how the case is with that truth of faith, and what is its quality, which falls into the thought of man, and is called the external law, and is represented by Aaron.  [3] To illustrate this by an example: man cannot possibly think without the idea of time and space, which idea adheres to almost everything which he thinks; if idea from time and space were taken away from man, he would not know what he is thinking; and scarcely whether he is thinking. But in the ideas of the angels there is nothing from time and space, but instead of these there are states, and this because the natural world is distinguished from the spiritual world by time and space. The reason why there are time and space in the natural world, and instead of these there are states in the spiritual world, is that in the natural world the sun seems by apparent revolutions to make days and years, and to divide the days into four times, night, morning, noon, and evening; and the years also into four times, winter, spring, summer, and autumn; and also to do this by means of variations of light and shade, and of heat and cold. From this come the ideas of time and of its variations. The ideas of space arise from measuring by times, and therefore where the one is, there is the other. [4] But in the spiritual world, the sun of heaven, whence come spiritual light and spiritual heat, does not make apparent rotations and revolutions, and thus induce ideas of time and space. The light which is from that sun is truth Divine; and the heat which is from that sun is good Divine. From these arise with the angels ideas of states; states of intelligence and faith from truth Divine; and states of wisdom and love from good Divine. To the variations of these states with the angels correspond the states of light and shade in the world, and also states of heat and cold, which are from the sun when it makes times and measures spaces. From this example it may to a certain extent appear what is the quality of that internal truth, or truth accommodated to angels, which is called the "internal law;" and also what is the quality of that external truth, or truth accommodated to men, which is called the "external law;" also whence it is that the things which the angels speak among themselves are to man incomprehensible, and also unutterable. </p>

 <p>Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod. That this signifies the power of internal truth through external truth, is evident from the signification of "hand," as being spiritual power, which is that of internal truth; and from the representation of a rod, as being natural power, which is that of external truth (see n. 6947, 6948). (That all power in the spiritual world belongs to truth, see n. 3091, 3387, 4931, 6344, 6423, 6948.) As Moses represents the internal law, which is the same as internal truth, and Aaron represents the external law, which is the same as external truth, and as internal truth flows into external and gives it power (n. 7381), therefore by the word of Moses to Aaron, "Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod," is signified the power of internal truth through external truth. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7383.">7383.</a></font></span>
 <p>Over the streams, over the rivers, and over the pools. That this signifies against falsities, is evident from the signification of "the streams and rivers of Egypt," as being doctrinal things of falsity (see n. 7323); and from the signification of "pools," as being memory-knowledges serviceable to them (see n. 7324); thus it is falsities that are here signified by "streams," "rivers," and "pools." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7384.">7384.</a></font></span>
 <p>And cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. That this signifies reasonings from mere falsities, is evident from what has been already shown (n. 7351, 7352). Frogs also correspond to reasonings from falsities, for each and all things in the natural world have a correspondence with those which are in the spiritual world; and this because the natural comes forth through the spiritual. Therefore universal nature is a theater representative of the spiritual world (n. 2758, 3483, 4939). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7385.">7385.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt. That this signifies the effect of the power of internal truth through external truth against falsities, is evident from the representation of Aaron, as being the doctrine of truth and good, thus external truth (see n. 6998, 7009, 7089); from the signification of "hand," as being power (n. 878, 4931-4937), here the power of internal truth through external (as above, n. 7382); and from the signification of "the waters of Egypt," as being falsities (n. 6693, 7307). The effect is signified by "stretching out the hand and the frogs coming up." From all this it is evident that by "Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt," is signified the effect of the power of internal truth through external truth against falsities. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7386.">7386.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the frog came up. That this signifies reasonings from mere falsities, is evident from what was said above (n. 7384). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7387.">7387.</a></font></span>
 <p>And covered the land of Egypt. That this signifies that the natural mind was made such, is evident from the signification of "covering," which, being said of the natural mind, denotes that it was filled with falsities and reasonings therefrom, thus that it was made such; and from the signification of "the land of Egypt," as being the natural mind (see n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7388.">7388.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments. That this signifies the abuse of Divine order, whence there was the like in the outward form, may be seen above (n. 7296, 7297, 7337), where are the like words. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7389.">7389.</a></font></span>
 <p>And caused frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. That this signifies in respect to reasonings from the natural mind, is evident from the signification of "frogs," as being reasonings from mere falsities (see n. 7351, 7352, 7384); and from the signification of "the land of Egypt," as being the natural mind (of which just above, n. 7387). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7390.">7390.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron. That this signifies the presence of the law Divine, is evident from the signification of "calling," as being presence (see n. 6177), that "to call" denotes presence is because to call is to desire to speak with someone, and to communicate what the speaker is thinking, and in the other life it is from a law of order that he is presented to view with whom anyone desires to speak and to communicate what he thinks; from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who are in falsities and infest (of which frequently above); from the representation of Moses, as being the internal law; and from the representation of Aaron, as being the external law (n. 7381). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7391.">7391.</a></font></span>
 <p>And said, Supplicate ye unto Jehovah. That this signifies humiliation from weariness, is evident from the signification of "to supplicate unto Jehovah," as being humiliation; for he who supplicates is in humiliation, and likewise he who requests another to supplicate for him. The reason why "to supplicate" denotes humiliation is that the angels do not attend to the supplication, but to the humiliation in which the man is when he is supplicating; for supplication without humiliation is only a vocal sound which does not come to the hearing and perception of the angels. That weariness is the cause, namely, the weariness of reasoning from mere falsities, will be seen in what now follows. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7392.">7392.</a></font></span>
 <p>That He remove the frogs from me, and from my people. That this signifies that they might not be driven to reasonings from mere falsities, is evident from the signification of "removing," as being not to be driven, for the cause of the supplication was weariness arising from being driven to reason from mere falsities; from the signification of "frogs," as being reasonings from mere falsities (see n. 7351, 7352); and from the representation of Pharaoh and also of the Egyptians, as being those who are in falsities and infest (of which frequently above).  [2] As regards the weariness which is the cause of the supplication or humiliation of those who infest, be it known that this is undelightful to them, for they cannot do mischief by reasonings from mere falsities, because the upright-here those who are of the Lord's spiritual church whom they were infesting-laugh at mere falsities, which are negations of truth; but they could do mischief by means of the falsities from the fallacies and appearances by which truths are falsified (which falsified truths are signified by the blood into which the waters of Egypt were turned, n. 7317, 7326), because fallacies and appearances seduce, for they are like a shade and veil to truths. And because they cannot do mischief by means of reasonings from mere falsities, that is, from utter negations of truth, it is undelightful to them, and therefore they deprecate it; for nothing delights the infernals except doing mischief in every possible way; doing mischief being the very delight of their life, insomuch that it is their very life; and therefore when they are not allowed to do mischief, they are in weariness. This is the reason why Pharaoh prayed for deliverance from the evil of the frogs, but not from the evil of the blood, of which above; nor from the evil of the lice, of which below; for by the evil of the frogs is signified infestation by means of reasonings from mere falsities, by which reasonings they cannot do mischief; whereas by the evil of the blood is signified infestation by means of falsities from fallacies and appearances, which infestation is delightful to them, because they can do mischief by its means; and by the evil of the lice are signified evils, which are delightful to them because they are evils. [3] In the other life all those perceive delight in doing mischief who in the world do not impart benefits to the neighbor for the sake of the neighbor, nor to their country for the sake of their country, nor to the church for the sake of the church, but for the sake of themselves; thus who do not do truth and good for the sake of truth and good. That they have delight in doing mischief does not show itself in the world, because the external man hides it; but in the other life when the outward things are being taken away and the man is left to his inward things, then this delight comes forth and manifests itself. From this it is that they are in hell, for all who are there love to do mischief, whereas all who are in heaven love to impart benefits. </p>

 <p>And I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Jehovah. That this signifies that they would then leave those who were of the spiritual church so that they may worship their God, is evident from the signification of "letting go," as being to release (see n. 7312, 7349, 7350); from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (n. 6426, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223); and from the signification of "sacrificing to Jehovah," as being to worship their God. That sacrifices signified all worship in general, see n. 6905; thus here they signify to worship. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7394.">7394.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Moses said unto Pharaoh. That this signifies the answer, is evident from the signification of "saying," because it is to Pharaoh who has just spoken, as being an answer (as also above, n. 7103). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7395.">7395.</a></font></span>
 <p>Have thou honor upon me. That this signifies that truth Divine ought to be trusted, is evident from the signification of "having honor," as being to trust; and from the representation of Moses, as being the law Divine (see n. 6723, 6752), consequently truth Divine (n. 6771, 7014, 7382). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7396.">7396.</a></font></span>
 <p>Till when shall I supplicate for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people? That this signifies intercession for those who are in falsities and infest, is evident from the signification of "supplicating" because for another, as being intercession; and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who are in falsities and infest (n. 7107, 7110, 7126, 7142, 7317); and as when his servants and his people are also added, these are represented by Pharaoh, then all and each are meant, for "servants" denote those who are of a lower sort and minister, and "people" denote the individuals. Empires and kingdoms are represented in heaven as a man, and the societies therein as the members of that man; but the king as the head. This representation has its ground in the fact that the universal heaven represents one man, and the societies therein his members, and this according to their functions. This shows how beautiful and delightful would be the representation of an empire, kingdom, and society in heaven, if they in like manner were conjoined among themselves by charity and faith. Moreover, wherever possible the Lord joins societies together in this way, for the Divine truth itself which proceeds from the Lord introduces this order wherever it is received, and this is the source of this order in heaven. It exists also on earth, but the societies which constitute it are scattered through the whole world, and are those who are in love to Him and in charity toward the neighbor. But these scattered societies have been gathered together by the Lord in order that they also, like the societies in heaven, may represent one man.  These societies are not only within the church, but also outside of it, and taken together are called the Lord's Church scattered and gathered from the good in the universal world, which is also called a communion. This communion, that is, this church, is the Lord's kingdom on earth conjoined with the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, and thus is conjoined with the Lord Himself. </p>

 <p>To cut off the frogs from thee, and from thy houses. That this signifies that the reasonings may cease, is evident from the signification of "frogs," as being reasonings from mere falsities (see n. 7351, 7352, 7384); from the signification of "to cut off," as being to cease, for "cutting off" is said of the frogs, but "ceasing" of the reasonings; from the representation of Pharaoh, from whom the frogs were to be cut off, as being those who are in falsities and infest (see just above, n. 7396); and from the signification of "houses," as being the things of the natural mind. That a "house" denotes the natural mind, see n. 4973, 5023, 7353; hence "houses" in the plural denote the things therein. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7398.">7398.</a></font></span>
 <p>Only in the river shall they be left. That this signifies that they should remain with the falsities where these are, is evident from the signification of "river," here the river of Egypt, as being falsity (see n. 6693, 7307); and from the signification of "being left," as being to remain. With this the case is that whatever enters with man, remains with him, especially what is received from affection. It is believed that the things which enter have been completely obliterated and cast out when the man no longer remembers them; but they have not been obliterated or cast out, but they stick fast either in the interior memory, or in the exterior, among things which have become familiar. For the things which become familiar, are as it were natural, which flow of their own accord, and are not excited by a conscious recalling from the memory; like man's speech, the words of which flow spontaneously from thought, as also do the gestures and actions, and even the steps; and also the thought. These enter successively from infancy, and in time become familiar, and then flow spontaneously. From these as well as from other similar facts, it is evident that all things which enter with man, remain, and that the things which have become habitual, that is, familiar, are no longer noticed as being in the man, although they are in him. Such is the case with the falsities and evils that enter with man, and also with the truths and goods. Such are the things that form him and determine his quality. (That all things which a man has seen, heard, thought, spoken, and done, have been inscribed on him, (see n. 2474-2489.) From all this it is now evident how it is to be understood that the reasonings would remain with the falsities where these are; for after falsities are being removed, they are allotted their places elsewhere in the natural, and together with the falsities the endeavor and cupidity of reasoning; but not as before in the midst directly under the mind's view. Hence it is that, as related in what follows, the frogs were gathered together in heaps, and the land stank by reason of them, whereby is signified that these reasoning falsities were arranged in bundles in the natural, and there was what was foul and loathsome therefrom (see below, n. 7408, 7409). </p>

 <p>And he said, Unto the morrow. That this signifies forever, is evident from the signification of "unto the morrow," as being forever, and to eternity (see n. 3998). </p>

 <p>And He said, Be it according to thy word. That this signifies confirmation thence, is evident without explication. </p>
