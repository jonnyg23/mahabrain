 <p>They who know nothing of the internal sense of the Word cannot believe otherwise than that the Israelitish and Jewish nation was chosen above every other nation, and hence was more excellent than all the rest, as also they themselves believed. And wonderful to say, this is believed not only by that nation itself, but also by Christians, in spite of the fact that the latter know that that nation is in filthy loves, in sordid avarice, in hatred, and in conceit; and that they also make light of, and even hold in aversion, the internal things which are of charity and faith, and which are of the Lord. The reason why Christians also believe that that nation was chosen above others, is that they believe that the election and salvation of man is from mercy, no matter how he lives, and thus that the wicked can be received into heaven equally with the pious and the upright; not considering that election is universal, namely, of all who live in good, and that the mercy of the Lord is toward every man who abstains from evil and is willing to live in good, and thus who suffers himself to be led of the Lord and to be regenerated, which is effected by the unbroken course of his life. [2] Hence also it is that most persons in the Christian world also believe that that nation will again be chosen, and will then be brought back into the land of Canaan, and this also according to the sense of the letter, as in many passages (Isa. 10:20-22; 11:11, 12; 29 at the end; 43:5, 6; 49:6-26; 46:8; 60:4; 61:3-10; 62; Jer. 3:14-19; 15:4, 14; 16:13, 15; 23:7, 8; 24:9, 10; 25:29; 29:14, 18; 30:3, 8-11; 31:8-10, 17; 33:16, 20, 26; Ezek. 5:10, 12, 15; 16:60; 20:41; 22:15, 16; 34:12, 13; 37:21, 22; 38:12; 39:23, 27, 28; Dan. 7:27; 12:7; Hosea 3:4, 5; Joel 2:32; 3; Amos 9:8, 9; and in Micah 5:7, 8). From these and also from other passages, even Christians believe that that nation will again be chosen and will be brought into the land of Canaan, although they know that that nation is waiting for a Messiah who will bring them in, and although they know that this expectation is vain, and that the kingdom of the Messiah or Christ is not of this world, and thus that the land of Canaan, into which the Messiah will bring men, is heaven. [3] Neither do they consider that in the Word there is a spiritual sense, and that in this sense by "Israel" is not meant Israel, nor by "Jacob" Jacob, nor by "Judah" Judah; but that by these men are meant what they represent. Neither do they consider the history of that nation, showing what its quality was in the wilderness, and afterward in the land of Canaan, that at heart it was idolatrous; and what the prophets say of it, and of its spiritual whoredom and abominations. This quality is described in the song in Moses, in these words:      I will hide My faces from them, I will see what their posterity will be; for they are a generation of perversions, sons in whom is no faithfulness. I said, I will cast them out into the furthest corners; I will make the memory of men to cease from man; unless their foes should say, Our hand is high, and Jehovah hath not done all this. For they are a nation lost in counsels, and there is no intelligence in them. Their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, clusters of bitterness are theirs. Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel gall of asps. Is not this hidden with Me, sealed up in My treasuries? Vengeance is Mine, and recompense, in time their foot shall slide; for the day of their destruction is near, and the things that are to come upon them make haste (Deut. 32:20, 26-28, 32-35). That Jehovah dictated this song to Moses may be seen in the previous chapter (Deut. 31:19, 21). Of that nation the Lord also says in John:      Ye are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father ye will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth (John 8:44); besides in many other passages.  [4] That although they know these things, Christians nevertheless believe that that nation will at last be converted to the Lord, and will then be brought into the land where they were before, is because, as already said, they do not know the internal sense of the Word; and because they suppose that the life of man effects nothing, and that evil, even when rooted in by repeated acts, is no hindrance to a man's becoming spiritual, and being regenerated, and thus accepted by the Lord, through faith, even that of one short hour; also that admission into heaven is of mercy alone, and that this mercy is toward a single nation, and not so toward all in the universe who receive the mercy of the Lord. They who think thus do not know that it is quite contrary to the Divine that some should be born as the elect to salvation and heaven, and some as the nonelect to damnation and hell. To think so about the Divine would be horrible, because such conduct would be the height of unmercifulness, when yet the Divine is mercy itself. From all this it can now be seen that the Israelitish and Jewish nation was not chosen, and still less that it will be chosen; and also that there was not anything of the church with it, nor could be, but only the representative of a church; and that the reason why it has been preserved even to this day, has been for the sake of the Word of the Old Testament (n. 3479). </p>

 <p>Verses 27-31. And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Go to meet Moses, into the wilderness. And he went and met him in the mountain of God, and kissed him. And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah, wherewith He had sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him. And Moses went, and Aaron, and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel; and Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs before the eyes of the people. And the people believed; and they heard that Jehovah had visited the sons of Israel, and that He had seen their affliction, and they bent themselves, and bowed themselves down. "And Jehovah said unto Aaron," signifies the truth of doctrine, and perception therein from the Divine; "Go to meet Moses," signifies that it should be conjoined with the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine; "into the wilderness," signifies where previously it is not so; "and he went, and met him in the mountain of God," signifies conjunction in the good of love therein; "and kissed him," signifies the affection of conjunction; "and Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah," signifies the influx of the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine of the Lord into the truth which proceeds mediately, and instruction in the details of doctrine; "wherewith He had sent him," signifies which proceed; "and all the signs which He had commanded him," signifies enlightenment and from this at the same time confirmation; "and Moses went, and Aaron," signifies the life of the conjunction of both; "and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel," signifies the chief things of wisdom pertaining to the spiritual church; "and Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken unto Moses," signifies doctrine thence from the Divine; "and did the signs before the eyes of the people," signifies confirmation to apprehension; "and the people believed, and they heard," signifies faith and hope; "that Jehovah had visited the sons of Israel," signifies that those who are of the spiritual church would be liberated and saved by the coming of the Lord; "and that He had seen their affliction," signifies after temptations so great; "and they bent themselves and bowed themselves down," signifies humiliation. </p>

 <p>And Jehovah said unto Aaron. That this signifies the truth of doctrine, and perception therein from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being perception (of which frequently above), hence "Jehovah said," denotes perception from the Divine and from the representation of Aaron, as being the doctrine of truth and good (see n. 6998, 7009), thus its truth. For all doctrine is of truth, because doctrine treats of truth and the good thence derived, which is called the doctrine of faith; and of good and the truth thence derived, which is called the doctrine of charity; but both are of truth. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7054.">7054.</a></font></span>
 <p>Go to meet Moses. That this signifies that it should be conjoined with the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "going to meet," as being to be conjoined; and from the representation of Moses, as being the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine (see above, n. 7010). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7055.">7055.</a></font></span>
 <p>Into the wilderness. That this signifies where previously it is not so, namely, conjunction, is evident from the signification of "wilderness," as being where as yet there is little vitality (see n. 1927), thus where there is no good and the derivative truth (n. 4736), for thence is vitality; here, where there is no conjunction of the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine with the truth proceeding immediately. That conjunction was to be effected there, is signified by "Aaron went to meet Moses in the wilderness." As to this conjunction, be it known that there may be with a man truth proceeding mediately from the Divine, and yet it may not be conjoined with the truth which proceeds immediately from the Divine. [2] But as this matter is secret, it shall be illustrated by examples. With those who think and teach according to the doctrine of their church confirmed in themselves, and do not know whether they are truths from any other ground than the fact that they are from the doctrine of the church, and that they have been delivered by learned and enlightened men, there can be truth proceeding mediately from the Divine; but still it is not conjoined with the truth that proceeds immediately from the Divine; for if it were conjoined, they would then have the affection of knowing truth for the sake of truth, and especially for the sake of life, whence they would also be endowed with a perception whether the doctrinal things of their church are truths before they confirm them in themselves; and would see in each whether the things confirming are in agreement with the truth itself. [3] Take as another example the prophets, through whom the Word was written. They wrote as the spirit from the Divine dictated, for the very words which they wrote were uttered in their ears. With them there was truth proceeding mediately from the Divine, that is, through heaven, but not for this reason the truth which proceeded immediately from the Divine; because they had no perception of what all the details signified in the internal sense. For when these two kinds of truth have been conjoined, then, as already said, there is perception. Such conjunction rarely exists with man, but it does so with all who are in heaven, especially with those who are in the inmost or third heaven; nor does it exist with a man unless he has been so far regenerated as to be capable of being elevated from the sensuous even toward his rational, and thus of being set in the light of heaven, where angels are. There is indeed with every man Divine influx both immediate and mediate (see n. 6063, 7004), but not conjunction, except with those who have perception of truth from good; for they with whom immediate Divine influx has been conjoined with mediate suffer themselves to be led by the Lord; but they with whom these influxes have not been conjoined, lead themselves, and this they love. From all this it can now be seen what is here meant by the "wilderness"-that it denotes where there is no conjunction. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7056.">7056.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he went, and met him in the mountain of God. That this signifies conjunction in the good of love there, is evident from the signification of "meeting," or "coming to meet," as being conjunction (of which just above, n. 7054); and from the signification of "the mountain of God," as being the good of Divine love (see n. 6829). The case herein is this. The conjunction of the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine with the truth which proceeds mediately, is not possible except in good, for good is the very soil. Truths are seeds, which do not grow elsewhere than in good as in their soil. Moreover, good is the very soul of truth; from this, truth comes forth, in order to be truth, and from this it lives.  [2] The truth which proceeds immediately from the Divine is called truth, but in itself it is good, because it proceeds from the Divine good; but it is the good to which all truth Divine has been united. It is called truth because in heaven it appears as light, but it is a light like that in spring, to which has been united the warmth that vivifies all things of the earth. From all this it can also be seen that the conjunction of the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine with the truth which proceeds immediately, is not possible except in good, consequently not unless the man is affected with truth for the sake of truth, especially for the sake of good, thus for the sake of life, for then the man is in good. [3] From the following considerations it may be further known how the case is with the conjunction in question. The truth proceeding immediately from the Divine enters into the will of man, this is its way; but the truth which proceeds mediately from the Divine enters into the understanding of man; and therefore conjunction cannot be effected unless the will and the understanding act as a one, that is, unless the will wills good, and the understanding confirms it by truth. When therefore there is conjunction, then the Lord appears as present, and His presence is perceived; but when there is no conjunction, then the Lord is as it were absent; yet His absence is not perceived, unless it is known from some perception what His presence is. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7057.">7057.</a></font></span>
 <p>And kissed him. That this signifies the affection of conjunction, is evident from the signification of "kissing," as being conjunction from affection (see n. 3573, 3574, 4353, 5929, 6260). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7058.">7058.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah. That this signifies the influx of the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine of the Lord into the truth which proceeds mediately, and instruction in the details of doctrine, is evident from the signification of "telling," as being influx (see n. 5966); from the representation of Moses, as being the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine of the Lord (see n. 7010, 7054); from the representation of Aaron, as being the truth proceeding mediately from the Divine of the Lord (see n. 7009); and from the signification of "all the words of Jehovah," as being the details of doctrine. Instruction is signified by "Moses told the words to Aaron," for instruction from the Divine is effected by means of influx, which influx is signified by "telling." From all this it is evident that by "Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah" is signified the influx of the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine of the Lord into the truth which proceeds mediately, and instruction in the details of doctrine. [2] There is instruction in the details of doctrine, when the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine of the Lord is conjoined with the truth which proceeds mediately, for then there is perception (of which above, n. 7055). There is this conjunction especially among the angels who are in the third or inmost heaven, and are called celestial. These angels have an exquisite perception of the truth of both kinds, and from this of the Lord's presence. The reason is that they are in good more than others, for they have the good of innocence; consequently they are nearest to the Lord, and in an intensely bright and as it were flaming light, for they see the Lord as a sun, the rays of whose light are such from the nearness. [3] It is said truth proceeding immediately from the Divine of the Lord, although in the internal sense the subject here treated of is the Lord when He was in the world, and when He called upon His Father as separate from Himself. But how the case herein is, has been occasionally told before, namely, that the Divine Itself, or Jehovah, was in Him, for He was conceived of Jehovah; and therefore He also calls Him His "Father," and Himself His "Son." But the Lord was then in the human that was infirm by heredity from the mother, and insofar as He was in this, so far Jehovah or the Divine Itself which was in Him appeared to be absent; but insofar as the Lord was in the Human glorified, or made Divine, so far Jehovah or the Divine Itself was present, and in the very Human. From this then it can be known how it is to be understood that the truth which had proceeded immediately from the Divine was from the Divine of the Lord. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7059.">7059.</a></font></span>
 <p>Wherewith he had sent him. That this signifies which proceed, namely, the details of doctrine, is evident from the signification of "being sent," as being to proceed (n. 2397, 4710). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7060.">7060.</a></font></span>
 <p>And all the signs which He had commanded him. That this signifies enlightenment, and from this at the same time confirmation, is evident from the signification of "signs," as being enlightenment and the confirmation of truths (see n. 7012). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7061.">7061.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Moses went, and Aaron. That this signifies the life of the conjunction of both, namely, of the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine of the Lord, and the truth which proceeds mediately, is evident from the signification of "going," as being life (see n. 3335, 3690, 4882, 5493); from the representation of Moses, as being the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine (n. 7010, 7054); and from the representation of Aaron, as being the truth proceeding mediately from the Lord (n. 7009). From this then, because they went together, there is signified the life of the conjunction of both. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7062.">7062.</a></font></span>
 <p>And gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel. That this signifies the chief things of wisdom pertaining to the spiritual church, is evident from the signification of "elders," as being the chief things of wisdom, thus those which agree with good (see n. 6524); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being the spiritual church (see n. 6426, 6637). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7063.">7063.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken unto Moses. That this signifies doctrine thence from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "speaking," when said of the doctrine which is represented by Aaron, as being utterance and preaching (see n. 6987, 6999); from the representation of Aaron, as being the truth proceeding mediately from the Divine of the Lord, thus the doctrine of truth and good (n. 6998, 7009); and from the signification of "the words which Jehovah spoke to Moses," as being from the Divine, that is, through the truth which proceeds immediately from the Divine of the Lord, which truth is represented by Moses (n. 7010, 7054).  </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7064.">7064.</a></font></span>
 <p>And did the signs before the eyes of the people. That this signifies confirmation to apprehension, is evident from the signification of "signs," as being the confirmation of truths, and thus knowledge (see n. 6870); and from the signification of "eyes," as being the things that are of the internal sight or understanding (n. 2701, 3820, 4403-4421, 4523-4534); thus "before the eyes" denotes to the understanding or apprehension. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7065.">7065.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the people believed; and they heard. That this signifies faith and hope, is evident from the signification of "believing," as being to believe in the spiritual sense, thus faith (see n. 6956, 6970); and from the signification of "hearing," as being to obey, and also to perceive (n. 5017), here to have hope; for when he who is in faith and obedience perceives confirmations, he has hope, for hope is thence derived. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7066.">7066.</a></font></span>
 <p>That Jehovah had visited the sons of Israel. That this signifies that those of the spiritual church would be liberated and saved by the coming of the Lord, is evident from the signification of visiting," as being liberation by the coming of the Lord into the world (see n. 6895), thus also salvation (that they who were of the spiritual church were adopted and saved by the coming of the Lord into the world, see n. 6854, 6914, 7035); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being the spiritual church (n. 6426, 6637). (That "Jehovah" in the Word denotes the Lord, see n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 3023, 3035, 5663, 6281, 6303, 6905.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7067.">7067.</a></font></span>
 <p>And that He had seen their affliction. That this signifies after temptations so great, is evident from the signification of "affliction," as being temptation (see n. 5356); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (n. 6426, 6637). As to the "affliction," or infestation by falsities, thus the temptations of those who were of the spiritual church before the Lord's coming, see n. 6854, 6914, 7037. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7068.">7068.</a></font></span>
 <p>And they bent themselves and bowed themselves down. That this signifies humiliation, is evident from the signification of "bending themselves and bowing themselves down," as being the effect of humiliation (see n. 2153, 6266); but that "bending themselves" denotes exterior humiliation, and is that of those who are in truth; and that "bowing themselves down" denotes interior humiliation, and is that of those who are in good, may be seen above (n. 5682). That this is so, has often been made plain from those who are in truth and those who are in good; they who are in truth are as it were rigid, and stand erect as if they were hard; and when they ought to humble themselves before the Divine, they only bend the body a little; but those who are in good are as it were soft, and when they humble themselves before the Divine, they bow themselves down to the earth. For truth without good is quite rigid, and when it looks to good as the end, this rigidity begins to soften; but good is in itself soft, and the truth which is being instilled, as it becomes good there, also grows soft. The reason is that truth cannot be ordered in the heavenly form except by good; hence it is in itself hard; for the heavenly form is most free and makes no resistance; and from this the good with which truth has been rightly ordered is like it; and as above said is soft. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7069.">7069.</a></font></span>
 <p>CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE SPIRITS OF THE PLANET MERCURY.           The nature of the genius of the spirits from the planet Mercury may still further appear from what follows. Be it known that all spirits whatever have been men, for the human race is the seminary of heaven; also that the spirits themselves are exactly such as they had been during their life in the world, for everyone's life follows him. This being so, the genius of the men of every earth can be known from the genius of the spirits who are from it. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7070.">7070.</a></font></span>
 <p>As the spirits from Mercury bear relation in the Grand Man to the memory of things abstracted from what is material (see n. 6808), therefore when anyone speaks with them about earthly, bodily, and merely worldly things, they are quite unwilling to hear; and when forced to hear about them they at once change them into other things, and for the most part into contrary ones, in order to escape from them. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7071.">7071.</a></font></span>
 <p>In order that I might know for certain that such is their genius, I was allowed to represent to them meadows, fallow grounds, gardens, woods, and rivers; but they at once changed them, darkening the meadows and fallow grounds, and by representations filling them with snakes; the rivers they made black, so that the water no longer appeared limpid. Then I asked them why they did so, they said that they are unwilling to think about such things, but only about real ones, which are the knowledges of such things as are abstracted from what is earthly, especially about such as arise in the heavens. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7072.">7072.</a></font></span>
 <p>Afterward I represented to them birds of different sizes, large and small, such as exist on our earth; for in the other life such may be represented as it were to the life, the very speech of spirits and angels being full of representations. When they saw those represented birds, they at first desired to change them, but afterward were delighted with them, and acquiesced. The reason was that birds signify the knowledges of things, of which fact the perception then flowed in; and therefore they abstained from changing them, and so turning them from the ideas of their memory. Afterward I was allowed to represent before them a most pleasing garden full of lights and oil-lamps. This arrested their attention, because lights together with oil-lamps signify truths which shine from good. From this it was evident that their attention could be fixed on material things, provided there was at the same time instilled the signification of them in the spiritual sense; for the things of the spiritual sense are abstracted from material things, but are represented in them. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7073.">7073.</a></font></span>
 <p>I also spoke with them about sheep and lambs; but they would not hear about such things, because these were perceived by them as earthly. The reason of this was that they did not understand what innocence is, which lambs signify, which I observed from the fact that when I said that lambs do not appear represented in heaven as lambs, but that when they are mentioned, innocence is perceived in place of them, they then said that they do not know what innocence is, but that they know it by name only. The reason is that they are affected solely by knowledges, and not by uses, which are the ends of knowledges (see n. 6815); thus not being affected by the ends of knowledges, they cannot know from internal perception what innocence is.  </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7074.">7074.</a></font></span>
 <p>Some of the spirits of the earth Mercury were sent by others to me in order to hear what was going on with me; to whom one of the spirits of our earth said that they might tell their companions not to speak anything but the truth, and not in their usual way to present to those questioning them things opposite; for if anyone of the spirits of our earth were to do so, he would be punished. But the company from which those spirits had been sent out, which was at a distance, then answered that if they were to be punished on that account, all would be punished, because, from constant use, they cannot do otherwise. They said that when they speak with the men of their own earth, they act in the same way, and this with no intention to deceive them, but in order to inspire a longing for knowledge; for when they present things opposite, and in a certain way hide the real things, the desire of knowing is excited, and in this way the memory is enriched by the study devoted to the exploration of the things in question. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7075.">7075.</a></font></span>
 <p>At another time I also spoke with them about the same thing, and because I knew that they spoke with the men of their earth, I asked how they instruct its inhabitants. They said that they do not instruct them how the matter stands, but still they instill some perception of it, in order that the desire to know may thereby be fed, and may increase, which desire would perish if they answered all questions. They added that they present opposites for the additional reason that the truth may afterward the better appear; for all truth appears relatively to its opposites. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7076.">7076.</a></font></span>
 <p>It is their custom not to tell another what they know, yet still to desire to know from all whatever they know; but they communicate all things to their own society, insomuch that what one knows, all know, and what all know, each one therein knows. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7077.">7077.</a></font></span>
 <p>As the spirits of Mercury are of this character, and moreover abound in knowledges, they are in a kind of conceit (see n. 6813), supposing that they know so many things that it is scarcely possible to know more. But they have been told by the spirits of our earth that they do not know many things, but only a few, and that the things which they do not know are relatively infinite; and that the things which they do not know relatively to those which they do know are like the waters of the greatest ocean as compared with those of a tiny spring. In order that they might know that such is the case it was granted that a certain angelic spirit should speak with them, and should tell them in general what they do know and what they do not know; and that there are infinite things which they do not know; and also that to eternity they cannot know even the generals of things. He spoke by means of angelic ideas much more readily than they, and as he disclosed what they know, and what they do not know, they were struck with amazement. I afterward saw another angel speaking with them, who appeared at some elevation to the right; he enumerated very many things which they do not know; and afterward spoke with them by means of changes of state, which they said they do not understand. He then told them that every change of state contains infinite things, and so also does every least thing of it. [2] When they heard this, as they had been in conceit on account of knowledges, they began to humble themselves. The humiliation was represented by the sinking of their roll downward, for that company then appeared like a roll, in front toward the left at a distance, in the plane of the region below the navel; but the roll appeared as it were hollowed out in the middle, and elevated at the sides; a reciprocal movement was also observed therein. They were also told what this signified, namely, what they were thinking in their humiliation, and that they who appeared elevated at the sides were not as yet in any humiliation. And I saw that the roll was separated, and that they who were not in humiliation were relegated toward their own globe; the rest remaining. As the spirits of the planet Mercury shun the spirits of our earth, on account of the material things in which the latter are, and as they had asked whether such can become angels (n. 6929), they now received the reply, that the angel who had spoken with them was from this earth. </p>

 <p>Be it known that the spirits of other earths do not appear within the sphere where the spirits of our earth are, but outside of it, some at greater, some at less distance, and also in different quarters. The reason is that the spirits of one earth are not of the same genius and life as those of another; also that they constitute different provinces in the Grand Man. The unlikeness of the state of life causes this appearance. But in the inmost heaven they do not appear separated from one another. The spirits of Mercury, however, do not appear in a fixed quarter, nor at a fixed distance, but appear now in front, now to the left, and now a little to the back. The reason is that they are allowed to wander through the universe to acquire knowledges, and thereby to enrich the memory. Their planet is presented to spirits at the back, as is also the sun of the world, when they are thinking about it, for nothing whatever of it appears. The reason why it is presented at the back is that to those who are in the other life the sun of the world is in complete obscurity, and is thick darkness; but the sun of heaven, or the Lord, appears in front before the right eye, because from this sun they have all their light; for the right eye not only corresponds to the intellectual sight insofar as it is illumined by truth, but also insofar as it is illumined by good (n. 4410). In this way does the Lord look at man from good, and illumine him through good. </p>

 <p>Exodus 5      THE DOCTRINE OF CHARITY In what precedes it has been told what the neighbor is: it is now to be told what the charity or love is which there must be toward the neighbor. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7081.">7081.</a></font></span>
 <p>The very life of man is his love; and such as his love is, such is his life; nay, such is the whole man. But it is the ruling or reigning love, that is, the love of that which he has as the end, which makes the man. This love has subordinate to itself many particular and singular loves, which are derivations, and appear under a different shape; but still the ruling love is in each one of them, and directs them, and through them, as through mediate ends, looks to and aims at its end, which is the first and last of them all; and this both directly and indirectly. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7082.">7082.</a></font></span>
 <p>There are two things in the natural world which make the life there, namely, heat and light; and there are two things in the spiritual world which make the life there, namely, love and faith. Heat in the natural world corresponds to love in the spiritual world, and light in the natural world corresponds to faith in the spiritual world. Hence it is that when spiritual heat or fire is mentioned, love is meant; and when spiritual light is mentioned, faith is meant. Moreover, love is actually the vital heat of man, for it is known that man grows warm from love; and faith is actually the light of man, for it can be known that man is illumined from faith. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7083.">7083.</a></font></span>
 <p>The heat and light in the natural world arise from the sun of the world; but spiritual heat and light, or love and faith, arise from the sun of heaven. The sun of heaven is the Lord; the heat which comes from Him as a sun is love, and the light which comes from Him as a sun is faith. That the Lord is light is evident from these words in John:      Jesus said, I am the light of the world, he that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life (John 8:12); and that the Lord is a sun is evident in Matthew:      When Jesus was transfigured, His face shone as the sun, and His garments became white as the light (Matt. 17:2). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7084.">7084.</a></font></span>
 <p>From this correspondence it can also be known how the case is with faith and with love. Faith without love is like light without heat, as is the light of winter; and faith with love is like light with heat, as is the light of spring. That in the light of spring each and all things grow and flower, is known; and also that in the light of winter all things become torpid and die. It is similar with faith and love. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7085.">7085.</a></font></span>
 <p>Now as love is the source of man's life, and as the whole man is such as is his love, and also as love is spiritual conjunction, it follows that all in the other life are consociated according to the loves; for everyone's life, that is, his love, follows him. They who are in love toward the neighbor, and in love to God, are consociate in heaven; but they who are in the love of self and the love of the world are consociate in hell; for the love of self is opposite to love to God, and the love of the world is opposite to love toward the neighbor. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7086.">7086.</a></font></span>
 <p>It is said "love to God," and there is meant love to the Lord, because in Him is the Trinity, and He is the Lord of heaven, for He has "all power in heaven and on earth" (Matt. 28:18).            EXODUS 5      1. And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, Let My people go, that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.      2. And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, whose voice I should hear, to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and also I will not let Israel go.      3. And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us; let us go, we pray, a way of three days into the wilderness, and let us sacrifice to Jehovah our God; lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.      4. And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, draw away the people from their works? Go ye unto your burdens.      5. And Pharaoh said, Behold the people of the land are now many, and ye have made them cease from their burdens.      6. And Pharaoh commanded in that day the taskmasters in the people, and their officers, saying,       7. Ye shall no more give the people straw to make bricks, as yesterday, and the day before yesterday; let them go and gather straw for themselves.      8. And the tale of the bricks which they made yesterday and the day before yesterday, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not take away from it; for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.      9. Let the service be made heavier upon the men, and let them do it; and let them not regard the words of a lie.      10. And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus said Pharaoh, I will by no means give you straw.      11. Go ye yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it; for nothing whatever shall be taken away from your service.      12. And the people scattered into all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.      13. And the taskmasters were urgent, saying, Complete ye your works, the work of a day in its day, as when there was straw.      14. And the officers of the sons of Israel were beaten, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, saying, Wherefore do ye not complete your task in making brick, as yesterday and the day before yesterday, also yesterday, also today?      15. And the officers of the sons of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore doest thou so to thy servants?      16. There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make ye bricks; and behold thy servants are beaten; and thy people have sinned.      17. And he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.      18. And now go ye, serve ye, and straw shall not be given you, and the tale of bricks shall ye give.      19. And the officers of the sons of Israel saw that they were in evil when it was said, Ye shall not take away from your bricks on a day in its day.      20. And they met Moses and Aaron standing to meet them as they went forth from Pharaoh.      21. And they said unto them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge, because ye have made our odor to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword into their hand to slay us.      22. And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Lord, wherefore hast Thou done evilly to this people? Why is this that Thou hast sent me?      23. For since I came unto Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he hath done evilly to this people; and liberating Thou hast not liberated Thy people. </p>

 <p>THE CONTENTS.      In this chapter in the internal sense the subject of the infestation by falsities of those who are of the spiritual church is continued. First those who were infesting are treated of-that they paid no attention whatever to the Divine exhortation; and next that afterward they infested still more, by injecting fallacies and fictitious falsities, which those who belonged to the spiritual church could not shake off; and as in this condition they could not remove from themselves those who were infesting, they lamented before the Divine. </p>

 <p>THE INTERNAL SENSE.      Verses 1-4. And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, Let My people go, that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness. And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah whose voice I should hear, to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and also I will not let Israel go. And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us; let us go we pray, a way of three days into the wilderness, and let us sacrifice to Jehovah our God; lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, draw away the people from their works? Go ye unto your burdens. "And afterward Moses and Aaron came," signifies the Divine law and doctrine thence derived; "and said unto Pharaoh," signifies exhortation thence to those who are against the truths of the church; "Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel," signifies that it was from the Divine Human of the Lord; "Let My people go," signifies that they should desist from infesting them; "that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness," signifies that from a glad mind they may worship the Lord in the obscurity of faith in which they are; "and Pharaoh said," signifies contrary thought; "who is Jehovah, whose voice I should hear?" signifies concerning the Lord, to whose exhortation they should hearken; "to let Israel go," signifies that they should desist; "I know not Jehovah," signifies that they care not for the Lord; "and also I will not let Israel go," signifies that neither will they desist from infesting; "and they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us," signifies that the God Himself of the church has commanded; "let us go we pray a way of three days into the wilderness," signifies that they must be in a state quite removed from falsities, although in the obscurity of faith; "and let us sacrifice to Jehovah our God," signifies that they may worship the Lord; "lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword," signifies to avoid damnation of evil and falsity; "and the king of Egypt said unto them," signifies the answer from those who are in falsities; "wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, draw away the people from their works?" signifies that their Divine law and doctrine will not release them from sufferings; "go ye unto your burdens," signifies that they must live in combats. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7089.">7089.</a></font></span>
 <p>And afterward Moses and Aaron came. That this signifies the Divine law and the doctrine thence derived, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being the Lord as to the Divine law (see n. 6752); and from the representation of Aaron, as being the doctrine of good and truth (n. 6998). By the Divine law which Moses represents is meant the Word such as it is in its internal sense, thus such as it is in the heavens; but by doctrine is meant the Word such as it is in its literal sense, thus as it is on the earth; how much these differ, can be seen from what has been thus far unfolded in respect to the internal sense of the Word. Take as an illustration the ten commandments, which specifically are called the "Law." The literal sense of these is that parents are to be honored, that murder is not to be committed, nor adultery, nor theft, and so on; but the internal sense is that the Lord is to be worshiped; that hatred must not be felt; that truth must not be falsified; and that we must not claim for ourselves that which belongs to the Lord. So are these four commandments of the Decalogue understood in heaven, and the rest also in their own way. For in the heavens they know no other Father than the Lord; therefore by that parents are to be honored, they understand that the Lord is to be worshiped: neither do they know in the heavens what killing is, for they live to eternity; but instead of killing they understand feeling hatred, and injuring the spiritual life of anyone; neither do they know in the heavens what it is to commit adultery, and therefore instead thereof they perceive that which corresponds, namely, not to falsify truth; and instead of stealing they perceive not to take anything away from the Lord, and claim it to themselves, as for instance good and truth. [2] Such is this law, and the whole Word too, in the heavens; thus such it is in the internal sense; nay, it is still deeper, for most things that are thought and said in the heavens do not fall into words of human speech, because in the heavens is a spiritual world and not a natural; and the things of the spiritual world transcend those of the natural world, as immaterial things transcend those which are material. Yet as material things correspond to immaterial, the latter can be set forth by means of material things, thus by natural speech, but not by spiritual speech. For spiritual speech is not a speech of material words, but of spiritual words, which are ideas modified into words in the spiritual aura, and represented by variegations of heavenly light, which light in itself is nothing but Divine intelligence and wisdom proceeding from the Lord. From all this it can be seen what is meant in its genuine sense by the Divine law which Moses represents, and what by the doctrine thence derived, which Aaron represents. </p>

 <p>And they said unto Pharaoh. That this signifies exhortation to those who are against the truths of the church, is evident from the signification of "saying," because it was by Moses and Aaron from Divine command, as being exhortation (see n. 7033); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being memory-knowledge that is against the truths of the church (n. 6651, 6673, 6683), thus those who are of such a character. Here and in what follows are treated of those of the spiritual church who were saved by the coming of the Lord into the world, and who before His coming were detained in the lower earth, and there agitated by falsities, that is, by the infernals who are in falsities from evil. That earth is beneath the soles of the feet, surrounded by the hells; in front by those who have falsified truths and adulterated goods; on the right by those who pervert Divine order, and from this study to acquire to themselves power; at the back by evil genii, who from the love of self have secretly plotted evil against the neighbor; deep under these are they who have utterly spurned the Divine, and have worshiped nature, and consequently have put away from them everything spiritual. With such are they surrounded who are in the lower earth, where before the coming of the Lord they who were of the spiritual church were reserved, and were there infested; nevertheless they were protected by the Lord, and were carried up into heaven with the Lord when He rose again (about this see what has been said and shown above, n. 6854, 6855, 6914, 6945, 7035). [2] The lower earth, where were reserved those who were of the spiritual church till the Lord's coming, is sometimes mentioned in the Word, as in Isaiah:      Sing, ye heavens, for Jehovah hath done it; shout ye lower parts of the earth; resound with singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein; because Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and hath rendered Himself glorious in Israel (Isa. 44:23); speaking of those who are in the lower earth, that they were saved by the Lord; "Jacob" and "Israel" are the spiritual church, "Jacob" the external church, "Israel" the internal (see n. 3305, 4286, 6426). In Ezekiel:      I will make thee come down with them that descend into the pit, to the people of eternity, and I will make thee dwell in the earth of lower things, in the desolations (Ezek. 26:20). Again:      To the earth of lower things, in the midst of the sons of man, to them that go down to the pit; whence all the trees of Eden shall be comforted in the lower earth, the choice and the chief of Lebanon, all that drink water (Ezek. 31:14, 16); here the "lower earth" is where were those who had been of the spiritual church. [3] At this day also, they who are of the church and have filled their ideas with worldly and also with earthly things, and have caused the truths of faith to be joined to such things, are let down to the lower earth, and are also in combats there; and this until these worldly and earthly things have been separated from the truths of faith, and such things have been implanted as will prevent their being further joined together. When this is over, they are lifted up from thence into heaven; for until such things have been removed, they cannot possibly be with the angels, because these worldly and earthly things are darkness and defilements, which do not accord with the light and purity of heaven. These worldly and earthly things cannot be separated and removed except by means of combats against falsities. These combats take place in this way: they who are in the lower earth are infested by the fallacies and derivative falsities which are sent forth from the infernals round about, but are refuted by the Lord through heaven; and at the same time truths are instilled, and these truths appear as if they were in those who are in the combats.  [4] Hence it is that the spiritual church is to be called "militant." But at this day it is rarely a militant church with anyone in the world, for while the man of the church lives in the world he cannot endure combat, because of the crowd of evil ones in the midst of whom he is; and because of the flesh in which he is, which is weak. In the other life a man can be kept firmly in the bonds of conscience, but not so in the world; for if in the world he is brought into anything of despair, as those are wont to be who are in combats, he forthwith bursts these bonds; and if he bursts them, he then yields; and if he so yields, it is all over with his salvation. Hence it is that few within the church at this day are admitted by the Lord into combats for truths against falsities. These combats are spiritual temptations. (See also what has been before shown concerning the lower earth and vastations there, n. 4728, 4940-4951, 6854.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7091.">7091.</a></font></span>
 <p>Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel. That this signifies from the Divine Human of the Lord, namely, exhortation to those who are against the truths of the church, is evident from the fact that by "Jehovah the God of Israel" is meant the Lord as to the Divine Human. (That in the Word the Lord is "Jehovah," see n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 3023, 3035, 5041, 5663, 6281, 6303, 6905.) He is called "the God of Israel," because by "Israel" is signified the Lord's spiritual kingdom (n. 6426, 6637), and because the Lord by His coming into the world saved those who were of that kingdom or church (n. 6854, 6914, 7035). The reason why "the God of Israel" is the Lord as to the Divine Human, is that they who are of that church have natural ideas about everything spiritual and heavenly, and also about the Divine; and therefore unless they thought of the Divine as of a natural man, they could not be conjoined with the Divine by anything of affection; for if they thought of the Divine not as of a natural man, they would either have no ideas, or extravagant ones, about the Divine, and would thereby defile the Divine.  Hence it is that by "the God of Israel" is meant the Lord as to the Divine Human, and indeed as to the Divine natural. (That by "Israel" and "Jacob" in the supreme sense is meant the Lord as to the Divine natural; by "Israel," as to the internal Divine natural; and by "Jacob," as to the external Divine natural, see n. 4570; also that they who are of the spiritual church were and are saved by the Divine Human of the Lord, n. 2833, 2834; and also that the man of the spiritual church, who is "Israel," is interior natural, n. 4286, 4402.) [2] From all this then it is evident why the Lord in the Word is called "Jehovah the God of Israel," and "Jehovah the Holy One of Israel." Everyone can know that the Divine must be so named in agreement with something holy not apparent in the sense of the letter. That the Lord as to the Divine natural is meant by "the God of Israel" is plain from many passages in the Word; manifestly from the following:      That Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy elders of Israel saw the God of Israel, under whose feet was as it were a work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the substance of heaven for cleanness (Exod. 24:9-10). [3] That it was the Lord and not Jehovah who is called the "Father" is evident from the Lord's words in John:      No one hath ever seen God (John 1:18). Ye have neither ever heard His voice, nor seen His shape (John 5:37). In Isaiah:      I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I am Jehovah, who have called thee by thy name, the God of Israel (Isa. 45:3). In Ezekiel:      Over the head of the cherubs was as it were the appearance of a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne; and over the likeness of a throne a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above; and he had the appearance of fire and a rainbow, and of brightness round about (Ezek. 1:26-28).  These are called "the glory of Jehovah," and "of the God of Israel," in the same (Ezek. 1:28; 8:4; 9:3; 10:19, 20), and also where the new temple is described (Ezek. 43:2; 44:2); as also in many other passages (Isa. 17:6; 21:10, 17; 24:15; 41:17; Ps. 41:13; 59:5; 68:8, 35; 69:6; 72:18, and elsewhere). So also He is called "the Holy One of Israel" (Isa. 1:4; 5:19; 10:20; 17:7; 30:11, 12, 15; 49:7; 60:9, 14; Ezek. 39:7). [4] That the "God of Israel" and the "Holy One of Israel" are the Lord as to the Divine Human is also evident from the fact that He is called the "REDEEMER," the "SAVIOR," the "MAKER"-the Redeemer, in Isaiah:      Our Redeemer, Jehovah Zebaoth; His name the Holy One of Israel (Isa. 47:4; also Isa. 41:14; 43:14; 48:17; 54:5); also the SAVIOR (Isa. 43:3); and the MAKER (Isa. 45:11). From all this it is also evident that by "Jehovah" in the Word of the Old Testament, no other is meant than the Lord, for He is called JEHOVAH GOD and the HOLY ONE of Israel, the REDEEMER, the SAVIOR, the MAKER-"Jehovah the Redeemer and Savior" in Isaiah:     That all flesh may know that I Jehovah am thy Savior, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob (Isa. 49:26).      That thou mayest know that I Jehovah am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob (Isa. 60:16; as also Isa. 43:14; 44:6, 24; 54:8; 63:16; Ps. 19:14). [5] That the Lord saved Israel, that is, those who are of the spiritual church, is said in Isaiah:      I will make mention of the mercies of Jehovah, the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah hath recompensed to us; abundant in goodness to the house of Israel. He said, Surely they are My people; sons who do not lie; and therefore He became their Savior; in all their distress He had distress; and the angel of His faces liberated them; because of His love, and His indulgence, He redeemed them; and He took them up, and carried them all the days of eternity (Isa. 63:7-9). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7092.">7092.</a></font></span>
 <p>Let My people go. That this signifies that they should desist from infesting them is evident from the signification of "letting go," when said to Pharaoh, by whom is represented the falsity which infests the truths of the church, as being to desist from infestation; and from the representation of the sons of Israel, who are here "My people," as being those who are of the spiritual church (see n. 6426, 6637). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7093.">7093.</a></font></span>
 <p>That they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness. That this signifies that from a glad mind they may worship the Lord in the obscurity of faith in which they are, is evident from the signification of "holding a feast," as being worship from a glad mind (of which presently), that it is the Lord to whom they were to hold the feast, and who is here meant by "Me," or by "Jehovah," may be seen above, n. 7091; and from the signification of a "wilderness," as being the obscurity of faith (n. 2708, 7055). (That they who are of the spiritual church are relatively in obscurity of faith, see n. 2708, 2715, 2716, 2718, 2831, 2849, 2935, 2937, 3241, 3246, 3833, 6289, 6500, 6945.) [2] The reason why "holding a feast" signifies worship from a glad mind, is that the feast was to be held at a way of three days from Egypt, thus in a state of no infestation by falsities, that is, in a state of liberty; for he who is being liberated from falsities and from the distress in which he then is, from a glad mind gives thanks to God; thus "holds a feast." Moreover, the feasts which were instituted with that people, and which were three every year, are likewise said to have been instituted in memory of their liberation from slavery in Egypt; that is, in the spiritual sense, in memory of liberation from infestation by falsities, through the Lord's coming into the world. Therefore it was also commanded that on those occasions they should be glad, as is manifest in Moses in regard to the feast of tabernacles:      In the feast of tabernacles, they shall take on the first day the fruit of the tree of honor, spathes <a name="fr_151"></a><a href="#fn_151"><font size="1">7093-1</font></a> of palm-trees, and a branch of a dense tree, and willows of the torrent; and ye shall be glad before Jehovah your God seven days (Lev. 23:40); [3] by "the fruit of the tree of honor, spathes of palm-trees, a branch of a dense tree, and willows of the torrent," is signified joy from good and truth from man's inmost to his external. The good of love, which is inmost, is signified by the "fruit of the tree of honor;" the good of faith by the "spathes of palm trees;" the truth of memory-knowledge, by the "branch of a dense tree;" and sensuous truth, which is most external, by the "willows of the torrent." These things could not have been ordered to be taken without a reason from the spiritual world, which reason cannot possibly appear to anyone except from the internal sense. [4] That they were to be glad in the feast of weeks is also evident in Moses:      Thou shalt make the feast of weeks to Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt be glad before Jehovah thy God, thou and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite who is in thy gates (Deut. 16:10-11); by these words also, in the internal sense, is signified gladness from good and truth from the inmost to the external. [5] That there was to be gladness in the feasts, and thus that "to hold a feast" is to worship from a glad mind, is also plain from the following passages. In Isaiah:      Ye shall have a song as in the nights when a feast is hallowed (Isa. 30:29). In Nahum:      Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! Keep thy feasts, O Judah, render thy vows; for Belial shall no longer pass through thee; he is wholly cut off (Nah. 1:15). In Zechariah:      The fasts shall be to the house of Judah for joy and for gladness, and for good feasts; only love ye truth and peace (Zech. 8:19). In Hosea:      I will cause all her joy to cease, her feast, her new moon (Hos. 2:11). And in Amos:      I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into a lament (Amos 8:10). [6] That "to hold a feast" denotes worship from a glad mind, because they had been liberated from servitude in Egypt, that is, in the spiritual sense, because they had been liberated from infestation by falsities, is manifest from the feast of the passover. This was commanded to be celebrated yearly on the day when they went forth out of Egypt, and this on account of the liberation of the sons of Israel from servitude, that is, on account of the liberation of those who are of the spiritual church from falsities, thus from damnation; and as the Lord liberated them by His coming, and lifted them up with Him into heaven when He rose again, therefore this was also done at the passover. This is likewise signified by the Lord's words in John:      Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all unto Me (John 12:31-32). </p>

 <p>And Pharaoh said. That this signifies contrary thought, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being to think (see n. 3395); that it denotes contrary thought by those who infest, who are represented by Pharaoh, is plain from what now follows, for Pharaoh did not at all desist, but still more oppressed the sons of Israel. </p>

 <p>Who is Jehovah, whose voice I should hear? That this signifies concerning the Lord, to whose exhortation they should hearken (that is, that the contrary thought should do so), is evident from the signification of "voice," as here being exhortation, because meaning what Moses and Aaron said to Pharaoh (see n. 7090); and from the signification of "to hear," as being to obey (n. 2542, 3869, 5017); thus "to hear a voice" denotes to obey or hearken to exhortation. That it is the Lord to whose exhortation he was unwilling to hearken, is because by "Jehovah" in the Word no other than the Lord is meant, as may be seen above (n. 7091). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7096.">7096.</a></font></span>
 <p>To let Israel go. That this signifies that they should desist, is evident from the signification of "letting go," as being to desist (see n. 7092), namely, from infesting those of the spiritual church, who here are "Israel." (That the "sons of Israel" denote those who are of the spiritual church, see n. 6426.) </p>

 <p>I know not Jehovah. That this signifies that they do not care for the Lord, is evident from the signification of "not knowing," as being not to care, for he who does not care, says that he does not know. (That by "Jehovah" is meant the Lord, see n. 7091.) As to Pharaoh's saying that "he did not know Jehovah," the case is this. The Egyptians from ancient time knew Jehovah, because in Egypt also there had been the Ancient Church, as can be plainly seen from the fact that they had among them the representatives and significatives of that church. The hieroglyphics of the Egyptians are nothing else; for by these were signified spiritual things, and they also knew that they actually corresponded; and as they began to employ such things in their sacred worship, and to worship them, and at last also to turn them into magic, and in this way to be associated with the devilish crew in hell, they therefore utterly destroyed the Ancient Church among them. Hence it is that by the "Egyptians" in the Word are signified the memory-knowledges of the church perverted, and also falsities contrary to the truths of the church. [2] When Divine worship had been thus perverted in Egypt, then also they were no longer allowed to worship Jehovah, and finally not even to know that Jehovah was the God of the Ancient Church, and this in order that they might not profane the name of Jehovah. That the name of Jehovah was known at that time also, and this before it was again told to the posterity of Abraham through Moses in Mount Horeb, is very plain from the fact that Balaam, who was of Syria, not only knew Jehovah, but also adored Him, and likewise sacrificed to Him (Num. 22, 23, 24). From all this it can be known why Pharaoh said "Who is Jehovah, whose voice I should hear to let the people go? I know not Jehovah."  [3] But as by Pharaoh are represented those in the hells who are in falsities, and who infest those of the spiritual church, therefore it must be told how the case is with these. They who are in the hells, and infest those who are of the spiritual church, are for the most part from such as have said that faith alone saves, and yet have lived a life contrary to faith; and as after the death of the body the life remains, thus the evil which they have thought, plotted, and done, therefore they either apply those things which they have said to be of faith to defend the evils of their life, or they altogether reject them. But lest they should abuse the truths of faith, they are deprived of them, and when they are deprived of them, they seize upon falsities, which are quite contrary to the truths of faith, and afterward by means of falsities infest those who are in truths. This is then the delight of their life. Moreover, some of them, in order to acquire power, learn magical arts. This is done by those who by various arts which they devised in the world have deceived the neighbor, and in consequence of their success have afterward attributed all things to their own prudence. [4] They who have become such, acknowledge the Father the Creator of the universe, but not the Lord. Of the Lord they say as Pharaoh here says of Jehovah, "Who is Jehovah? I know not Jehovah." Nay, as the universal sphere of heaven is full of the acknowledgment and love of the Lord, so is the universal sphere of the hells full of the denial of the Lord and of hatred against Him; neither can they endure that He should be named. The infernals are such that they do not desist on account of exhortations and threats, so great is the delight of their life in infesting the upright, and turning them from the acknowledgment of the Lord, and from faith in Him. This very delight of their life is increased by exhortations to desist, for this leads them to believe that it will shortly be all over with those whom they are infesting. These then are they who are specifically meant by "Pharaoh and the Egyptians." </p>

 <p>And also I will not let Israel go. That this signifies that neither will they desist from infesting, is evident from what has been said above (n. 7092, 7096). </p>

 <p>And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us. That this signifies that the God Himself of the church has commanded, is evident from the signification of "the Hebrews," as being those who are of the church (see n. 6675, 6684, 6738); and from the signification of "meeting," as being to command (n. 6903). </p>

 <p>Let us go we pray a way of three days into the wilderness. That this signifies that they must be in a state quite removed from falsity, although in the obscurity of faith, see n. 6904, where are the like words. </p>
