 <p>And he will see thee. That this signifies perception, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being to understand and perceive (see n. 2150, 2807, 3764, 3863, 4567, 4723). </p>

 <p>And he will be glad in his heart. That this signifies the affection of love, is evident from the signification of "being glad in heart," as being the pleasantness and delight from the affection which is of love; for all gladness proceeds from the affection of love. That the affection of love is said of the doctrine of good and truth, and not of those who are in the doctrine, is from angelic speech, for so the angels speak, because they are unwilling to speak of persons, because speech about persons would avert the ideas from a universal view of things, thus from the comprehension of innumerable things together. For this reason they attribute to doctrine what is pleasant and enjoyable, also affection and the like. These things also are in doctrine when the man applies it to himself, because in doctrine there is truth Divine proceeding from the Lord, and in truth Divine proceeding from the Lord there is love, thus what is pleasant and enjoyable. </p>

 <p>And thou shalt speak unto him. That this signifies influx, is evident from the signification of "speaking," as being influx (see n. 2951, 5481, 5743, 5797).  </p>

 <p>And shalt put the words in his mouth. That this signifies that what he utters will proceed from the Divine Human, is evident from the representation of Moses, who was to put words in Aaron's mouth, as being the Lord as to the Divine truth which proceeds from His Divine Human (of which above); and from the signification of "mouth," as being voice and utterance (see n. 6987). Thus "to put in the mouth" denotes to give to utter; but when said of the Lord, it denotes to proceed, because the Word which is uttered by a spirit or angel, proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human. Aaron, moreover, represents the doctrine of good and truth, which is uttered. The case herein is this.  [2] From the Lord proceeds Divine truth immediately and mediately; that which proceeds immediately is above all the understanding of angels; but that which proceeds mediately is adapted to the angels in the heavens and also to men, for it passes through heaven and thereby puts on the angelic and the human quality; but into this truth also the Lord flows immediately, and thus leads angels and men both mediately and immediately (n. 6058). For each and all things are from the First being, and the order has been so instituted that the First being may be present in the derivatives both mediately and immediately, thus alike in the ultimate of order and in its first; for the Divine truth itself is the one only substantial, the derivatives being nothing but successive forms thence derived. From this also it is plain that the Divine flows immediately also into each and all things, because all things have been created from the Divine truth, the Divine truth being the one only essential (n. 6880), thus that from which all things are. The Divine truth is what is called "the Word" in John:      In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word; all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made (John 1:1-2). By such influx the Lord leads man not only by providence in the universal, but also in every singular, nay, in the veriest singulars of all. For these reasons it is said that the things which are uttered proceed from the Divine Human.  [3] That there is an immediate influx of the Lord where there is also a mediate, thus in the last of order equally as in the first of order, has been told me from heaven, and a living perception of it has been given; also that what is effected by mediate influx, that is, through heaven and the angels there, is relatively very little; and further, that the Lord leads heaven by means of immediate influx, and at the same time by means of it keeps all things there in their connection and order. </p>

 <p>And I will be with thy mouth. That this signifies that truth Divine will proceed through the Divine Human from the Divine Itself, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being the Lord as to truth Divine (of which above); and from the signification of "being with his mouth," as being to be in the truth Divine which proceeds from the Divine Human. The Divine Itself, which is called the "Father," is meant by "I," or Jehovah. Hence it is evident that by "I will be with thy mouth" is signified that truth Divine proceeds through the Divine Human from the Divine Itself; which is the same as that the holy of the spirit proceeds from the Son, and the Son from the Father, according to the doctrine of the church; which however is to be understood in this way: that this Trine is in the Lord and is one in Him. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7006.">7006.</a></font></span>
 <p>And with his mouth. That this signifies thus with the things thence derived, is evident from the representation of Aaron, as being the doctrine of good and truth (see n. 6998); and from the signification of "being with his mouth," as being the Divine with this doctrine, and in it; and as this doctrine is from the Divine truth which proceeds immediately from the Divine Human (of which just above, n. 7005), therefore by "being with his mouth" is signified with the things thence derived. (That the doctrine of good and of truth proceeds mediately and immediately from the Divine Human of the Lord, see above, n. 7004.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7007.">7007.</a></font></span>
 <p>And will teach you what ye shall do. That this signifies thus the Divine in each and all things which shall be done, is evident from the signification of "teaching," as being to flow in, and when as here said of the Divine, as being to proceed (see above, n. 6993); and from the signification of "what ye shall do," as being what shall be done. That it denotes in each and all things, is because it is said of the Divine. Something shall here be said about the Divine being in each and all things that take place with man. That such is the case appears to man to be far from the truth, because he thinks, "If the Divine were in each and all things that take place, evils would not happen, neither would anyone suffer damnation;" also that the justice of a cause would always triumph; that the upright would be happier in the world than the wicked; with many like things; and as they see the contrary, they do not believe that the Divine is in each and all things. Hence it is that they attribute to themselves and their own sagacity the singulars, and to the Divine only the universal government; and all other things they call fortune and chance, which they conceive to be blind things of nature.  [2] But man so thinks because he does not know the secrets of heaven, which are that the Lord leaves to everyone his own freedom; for unless man is in freedom, he can never be reformed. Compulsion does not reform, because it inroots nothing, for that which is compulsory is not of man's will; but that which is free is of his will. Nevertheless good and truth, in order to be man's as his own, must be inrooted in his will, for that which is outside the will is not the man's. And as for this reason everyone is left to his freedom, man is allowed to think evil, and to do evil, insofar as external fears do not restrain. And also for the same reason, in this world the wicked man is apparently glad and in his glory more than the upright; but the glorying and gladness of the wicked are external, or of the body, which in the other life are turned into infernal unhappiness; whereas the glorying and gladness of the upright are internal, or of the spirit, and remain and become heavenly happiness. [3] Moreover, in eminence and opulence there is worldly, but not eternal happiness; and therefore both the wicked and the upright have it, or if the latter do not have it, it is that they may not be turned away from good by such things; and as men make the Divine blessing to consist in worldly goods and happinesses, when they see the contrary their weakness drives them into errors with respect to the Divine Providence. They also come to conclusions from the present things which they see, without considering that the Divine Providence looks to what is eternal, especially that all things may be in order in heaven, and also in hell; thus that heaven may constantly bear relation to a Man, and that hell may be in the opposite, whence comes equilibrium; and that this cannot possibly exist except by means of the Divine Providence in the veriest singulars of all, thus unless the Divine continually guides and bends man's freedom.  [4] In regard to the other points, see what has been already said and shown about the Divine Providence, namely: That the providence of the Lord cannot be universal unless it is in the veriest singulars (n. 1919, 4329, 5122, 5894, 6481-6486, 6490): That the providence of the Lord has regard to what is eternal (n. 5264, 6491): That evil is foreseen by the Lord, and good is provided (n. 5155, 5195, 6489): That the Lord turns into good the evil which He foresees (n. 6574): That contingent things are of providence (n. 5508, 6493, 6494): That man's own prudence is like a few specks of dust in the atmosphere, and Providence like the whole atmosphere (n. 6485): That many fallacies attack the Divine Providence in singulars (n. 6481). </p>

 <p>And he shall speak for thee unto the people. That this signifies that he will be doctrine to the spiritual church, is evident from the representation of Aaron, of whom it is said that "he shall speak for Moses to the people," as being the doctrine of good and truth (see n. 6998); from the signification of "speaking," as being confession and preaching (n. 6999); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, who are here the "people," as being the spiritual church (n. 6426). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7009.">7009.</a></font></span>
 <p>And it shall be that he shall be to thee for a mouth. That this signifies the truth of doctrine, which also proceeds mediately from the Lord, is evident from the representation of Aaron, who was to be "to Moses for a mouth," as being doctrine (see n. 6998); and from the signification of "being to Moses for a mouth," as being his utterance or preaching (n. 6987). It is said the truth of doctrine which also proceeds mediately from the Lord, because the truth of doctrine, which is represented by Aaron, is such as is heard and perceived by angels and men. This truth is what proceeds mediately from the Lord; but the truth which is represented by Moses, is that which proceeds from the Lord immediately, and is not heard or perceived by men, nor even by angels (n. 6982, 6985, 6996, 7004). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7010.">7010.</a></font></span>
 <p>And thou shalt be to him for God. That this signifies the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord immediately, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being the Lord as to Divine truth (see n. 6752). That it denotes the Divine truth which proceeds immediately from the Lord, is signified by that he was "to Aaron for God;" for by "God" in the Word is meant the Lord as to Divine truth, and by "Jehovah," the Lord as to Divine good. That in the Word the Lord is called "God" where truth is treated of, but "Jehovah" where good is treated of, see n. 2586, 2769, 2807, 2822, 3921, 4402: That the angels are called "gods" from the truths in which they are from the Lord (n. 4402): And that in the opposite sense the "gods of the nations" denote falsities (n. 4402, 4544). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7011.">7011.</a></font></span>
 <p>And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod. That this signifies Divine power herein, is evident from the signification of "rod," as being power (see n. 4013, 4015, 4876, 4936), and in fact when it is in the hand; for by "hand" is signified spiritual power, and by "rod" natural power. As the natural has no power except from the spiritual, so a rod has no power unless it is in the hand; and therefore it is said that "he should take it in his hand." (That the "hand," when predicated of the Lord denotes the power proceeding from His Divine rational, and a "rod" the power proceeding from His Divine natural, may be seen above, n. 6947.) It is said "the Divine power therein," namely, in truths (of which above), because power is predicated of truth (n. 3091, 6344, 6423, 6948). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7012.">7012.</a></font></span>
 <p>Wherewith thou shalt do the signs. That this signifies the consequent enlightenment and confirmation of truths, is evident from the signification of a "sign," as being the confirmation of truths (see n. 6870); that it also denotes enlightenment, is because the confirmation of truths is effected by means of enlightenment from the Lord when a man studies the Word with the end of knowing truths. As regards enlightenment and the consequent confirmation of truths, be it known that they who are in externals without an internal (as were the Jews and the Israelites) cannot be enlightened; thus neither can they be confirmed in truths, whereas when they who are in externals and at the same time in internals read the Word, they are enlightened, and in their enlightenment see truths, in which they are afterward more and more confirmed; and, wonderful to say, everyone has such enlightenment as is his affection of truth; and such affection of truth as is his good of life. Hence also it is that they who are in no affection of truth for the sake of truth, but for the sake of their own advantage, are not at all enlightened when they read the Word, but are only confirmed in doctrinal things, no matter of what kind, whether false, as heresies are, or entirely contrary to truths, as are the Jewish ones; for they do not seek the kingdom of the Lord, but the world; not faith, but fame; thus not heavenly riches, but only earthly; and if perchance they are seized with a desire of knowing truths from the Word, falsities present themselves instead of truths, and at last there is denial of all things. These things have been said in order that it may be known what enlightenment is, and the consequent confirmation of truth. </p>

 <p>Verses 18-20. And Moses went, and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray, and return into my brethren who are in Egypt, and I shall see whether they yet live. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. And Jehovah said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; because all the men seeking thy soul are dead. And Moses took his wife and his sons, and made them ride upon the ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt; and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. "And Moses went, and returned," signifies continuation of the former life; "to Jethro his father-in-law," signifies in simple good; "and said to him, Let me go I pray, and return unto my brethren who are in Egypt," signifies elevation to more interior and more spiritual life in the natural; "and I shall see whether they yet live," signifies the perception of that life; "and Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace," signifies assent and a devout wish; "and Jehovah said unto Moses in Midian," signifies enlightenment and confirmation from the Divine in this state; "Go, return into Egypt," signifies spiritual life in the natural; "because all the men seeking thy soul are dead," signifies the removal of the falsities that are endeavoring to destroy the life of truth and good; "and Moses took his wife," signifies good adjoined; "and his sons," signifies truths thence derived; "and made them ride upon the ass," signifies which would be of service to new intelligence; "and he returned into the land of Egypt," signifies in the natural mind; "and Moses took the rod of God in his hand," signifies that these things were from Divine power. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7014.">7014.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Moses went, and returned. That this signifies continuation of the former life, is evident from the signification of "going," as being life (see n. 4882, 5493, 5605); from the signification of "returning," or "going back," as being to live where he lived before; and from the representation of Moses, as being the Lord as to the law or truth from the Divine (n. 6771, 6827). When Moses was in Mount Horeb with Jehovah seen in a flame, he then represented the Lord as to Divine truth; but now with Jethro his father-in-law, who is the good of the church which is in the truth of simple good, he represents the Lord as to truth from the Divine. Here and elsewhere in the Word, in the internal sense, are described all the states of the Lord's life in the world, how He then made His Human Divine. That the states were successive, can be seen from the fact that the Lord when an infant was like an infant, and that He afterward grew in intelligence and wisdom, and continually instilled into these the Divine love, even until He became the Divine love, that is, the Divine being or Jehovah, as to His Human also. And as the Lord in this way successively put on the Divine, He therefore first made Himself truth from the Divine, afterward Divine truth, and at last the Divine good. These were the steps of the glorification of the Lord which are described here and elsewhere in the internal sense of the Word. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7015.">7015.</a></font></span>
 <p>Unto Jethro his father-in-law. That this signifies in simple good, namely, continuation of life, is evident from the representation of Jethro, who being the priest of Midian denotes the good of the church which is in the truth of simple good (see n. 6827); this good is meant by "simple good;" and from the signification of "father-in-law," as being that from which comes the conjunction of good and truth (n. 6827). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7016.">7016.</a></font></span>
 <p>And said to him, Let me go, I pray, and return unto my brethren who are in Egypt. That this signifies elevation to more interior and more spiritual life in the natural, is evident from the signification of "going and returning," as being what is successive of life, and here the successive of life is elevation to interior and more spiritual life, thus nearer to the Divine, for when "going and returning" are said of the Lord, who is represented by Moses, there is meant elevation to the Divine being or Jehovah who is in Him, and from whom He is; from the representation of the sons of Israel, who are here the "brethren," as being the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and thence the spiritual church (see n. 6426, 6637); and from the signification of "Egypt" as being the natural (n. 6147, 6252). Hence it is plain that by "let me go and return unto my brethren who are in Egypt," is signified elevation to more interior and more spiritual life in the natural. For as the dwelling of Moses in Midian signified life with those who are in the truth of simple good, thus in simple good (see n. 7015), so now dwelling with the sons of Israel signifies life with those who are in the truth and good of the spiritual church, which life is more interior and spiritual than the former. (That the good and truth of this church are in the natural, see n. 4286, 4402.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7017.">7017.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I shall see whether they yet live. That this signifies the perception of that life, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being to understand and perceive (see n. 2325, 2807, 3764, 3863, 4403-4421, 4567, 4723, 5400); and from the signification of "living," as being spiritual life (n. 5407). By the perception of that life is meant the perception which precedes; for when anyone proposes anything to himself, he perceives it as present, because he puts his mind into the state of that thing; and from this there are longings and consequent delight as if the thing were present. Thus the mediate ends conjoin themselves with the ultimate end, and make as it were one end. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7018.">7018.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. That this signifies assent and a devout wish, is evident from the signification of "Jethro said to Moses," as being the answer; that it denotes assent, and also a devout wish, is signified by "Go in peace." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7019.">7019.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Jehovah said unto Moses in Midian. That this signifies enlightenment and confirmation from the Divine in this state, is evident from the fact that Jehovah said to Moses that he should return to Egypt, when yet this had previously been commanded Moses by Jehovah (chapter 3:10, and above in this chapter, verse 12), and when, in consequence of this command, Moses had already prepared himself for the way. From this it can be seen that by this command are signified enlightenment and confirmation from the Divine. That the enlightenment and confirmation were in this state, namely, in a state of the truth of simple good, is signified by its being said by Jehovah to Moses in Midian. (That "Midian" denotes the truth of simple good, see n. 3242, 4756, 4788, 6773.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7020.">7020.</a></font></span>
 <p>Go, return into Egypt. That this signifies spiritual life in the natural, is evident from the signification of "going and returning," as being more interior and spiritual life (of which above, n. 7016); and from the signification of "Egypt," as being the natural (n. 6147, 6252). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7021.">7021.</a></font></span>
 <p>Because all the men seeking thy soul are dead. That this signifies the removal of the falsities that are endeavoring to destroy the life of truth and good, is evident from the signification of "being dead," as being that they are removed, for they who are dead have also been removed; from the signification of the "Egyptians," who here are "the men," as being those who are in falsities (see n. 6692); and from the signification of "those seeking the soul," as being those who are endeavoring to destroy the life. And as spiritual life is the life of the truth that is of faith, and of the good that is of charity, it is therefore said "the life of truth and good." From this it is evident that by "all the men seeking thy soul are dead" is signified the removal of the falsities that are endeavoring to destroy the life of truth and good. By "soul" in the Word is meant every living thing, and it is attributed also to animals, but "soul" is properly predicated of man, and when of man, the term is used in various senses. Man himself is called a "soul," because his life in general is so called, also specifically his intellectual life, or understanding, and likewise his voluntary life, or will. [2] But in the spiritual sense by "soul" is meant the life of the truth which is of faith, and of the good which is of charity, and in general the man himself as to his spirit which lives after death, in which sense it is used in these passages:      Be not afraid of those who are able to kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul (Matt. 10:28).      What doth it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what price shall a man give sufficient for the redemption of his soul? (Matt. 16:26).      The Son of man is not come to destroy men's souls, but to save them (Luke 9:56).      Ye have profaned Me among My people, to slay the souls that ought not to die, and to make the souls to live that ought not to live (Ezek. 13:19). In these passages the "soul" denotes the spiritual life of man, which life is that of his spirit after death. "To kill the soul," "to lose the soul," "to destroy the soul," denote to die spiritually, that is, to be damned. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7022.">7022.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Moses took his wife. That this signifies good adjoined, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being the Lord as to the law, or truth, from the Divine (of which above); and from the signification of "wife," as being good adjoined (see n. 4510, 4823). In the internal sense, and also in the supreme sense in which the Lord is treated of, by the wife of Moses is represented good conjoined with truth, because in each and all things in the spiritual world and in the natural, there is a likeness of a marriage. There is a likeness of a marriage where there is what is active and what is passive; and there must be the active and at the same time the passive where anything has to come into existence; for without the conjunction of these two nothing can possibly be produced. That there is in all things a likeness of a marriage, is because all things bear relation to good and truth, thus to the heavenly marriage, which is that of good and truth; and the heavenly marriage bears relation to the Divine marriage, which is that of Divine good and Divine truth. And because as before said nothing can come into existence and be produced unless there is an active and a passive, thus unless there is a likeness of a marriage, it is very evident that the truth which is of faith without the good which is of charity cannot produce anything, nor the good which is of charity without the truth which is of faith; but that there must be a conjunction of both to produce fruits, and to make the life of heaven in man. That in all things there is a likeness of a marriage, see n. 1432, 2173, 2176, 5194; and that in every detail of the Word there is the marriage of good and truth, see n. 683, 793, 801, 2516, 2712, 4138, 5138, 6343; consequently in every detail of the Word there is heaven, for heaven is this marriage itself; and as in every detail of the Word there is heaven, in every detail of the Word there is the Lord, because the Lord is the all in all things of heaven. From all this it can be seen why the wife of Moses represents good conjoined with truth, even in the supreme sense, in which the Lord is treated of; in like manner as does Sarah the wife of Abraham (n. 2063, 2065, 2172, 2173, 2198); and also Rebecca the wife of Isaac (n. 3012, 3013, 3077). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7023.">7023.</a></font></span>
 <p>And his sons. That this signifies the truths thence derived, is evident from the signification of "sons," as being truths (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373); it is said "thence derived," because from the marriage just spoken of.  </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7024.">7024.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he made them ride upon the ass. That this signifies the things that would be of service to new intelligence, is evident from the signification of "riding," as being the things of the intellect, here of new intelligence, which must be of life among those who are in the spiritual church (see n. 7016); that these things are signified by "riding" is because a "horse" signifies the intellectual (of which see n. 2761, 2762, 3217, 5321, 6534); and from the signification of an "ass," as being the truth that is of service, here to new intelligence (n. 2781, 5741), and also as being memory-knowledge (n. 5492). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7025.">7025.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he returned unto the land of Egypt. That this signifies in the natural mind, is evident from the signification of "the land of Egypt," as being the natural mind (see n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7026.">7026.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. That this signifies that these things were from Divine power, is evident from the signification of "rod," as being power (n. 4013, 4015, 4876, 4936) thus "the rod of God" denotes Divine power. (That "rod" denotes the power of the natural, and "hand" the power of the spiritual, and that the natural has power from the spiritual, thus that by "rod" is signified power when it is in the hand, see n. 7011.) That a "rod" denotes power, originates from the representatives in the other life, for in that life they who practice magical arts appear with rods, which also serve them for powers. Hence also the Egyptian magicians had rods, whereby they performed what appeared like miracles; and from this the ancients in their writings everywhere assign rods to magicians. From all this it can be seen that a rod is a representative of power, and that it is also a real correspondence, for power is actually exercised by means of rods; but with magicians this is an abuse of correspondence, neither is it of avail except within the hells where they are, and it avails there because illusions and phantasies reign there. And because there is a real correspondence of a rod with power, Moses was commanded to take a rod in his hand, and by it to do signs; and for the same reason also kings have a scepter, which is a short rod, and by it is signified royal power. The correspondence of a rod and of power, is from the fact that a rod or staff supports the hand and arm, thus at the same time the body, and in the Grand Man the hand and arm correspond to power (n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937, 5327, 5328, 5544, 6947, 7011). </p>

 <p>Verses 21-23. And Jehovah said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see all the wonders which I have put in thy hand, and thou shalt do them before Pharaoh; and I will harden his heart, and he will not send away the people. And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, My son, My firstborn, is Israel, and I say unto thee, Send My son away, that he may serve Me; and if thou refuse to send him away, behold I will slay thy son, thy firstborn. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies perception from the Divine; "When thou goest to return into Egypt," signifies spiritual life in the natural; "see all the wonders which I have put in thy hand," signifies means of power from the spiritual then; "and thou shalt do them before Pharaoh," signifies against infesting falsities; "and I will harden his heart, and he will not send away the people," signifies obstinacy, and thus not yet liberation; "and thou shalt say unto Pharaoh," signifies exhortation; "Thus said Jehovah," signifies from the Divine; "My son, My firstborn, is Israel," signifies that they who are in spiritual truth and good have been adopted; "and I say unto thee," signifies command; "Send My son away," signifies that they should abstain from infesting the truths of the church; "that he may serve Me," signifies elevation into heaven in order to perform uses therefrom; "and if thou refuse to send him away," signifies obstinacy even to the last; "behold I will slay thy son, thy firstborn," signifies the extinction of faith without charity, and the consequent devastation of truth with them. </p>

 <p>And Jehovah said unto Moses. That this signifies perception from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "saying," in the historicals of the Word, as being perception (of which frequently above); that it denotes from the Divine, is signified by "Jehovah said." The reason why it is again said, "Jehovah said unto Moses," is that a new perception is signified (see n. 2061, 2238, 2260, 2506, 2515, 2552). </p>

 <p>When thou goest to return into Egypt. That this signifies spiritual life in the natural, is evident from the signification of "going and returning," as being elevation to a more interior and spiritual life; and from the signification of "Egypt," as being the natural (of which above, n. 7016). </p>

 <p>See all the wonders which I have put in thy hand. That this signifies means of power from the spiritual then, is evident from the signification of "wonders" or "miracles," as being means of Divine power (see n. 6910); and from the signification of "hand," as being spiritual power (n. 7011). From this it is evident that by "see all the wonders which I have put in thy hand" are signified means of power from the spiritual.  </p>

 <p>And thou shalt do them before Pharaoh. That this signifies against the infesting falsities, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh as being falsity infesting the truths of the church (see n. 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692). That "thou shalt do them before Pharaoh" denotes against these falsities, is because it follows in a series from the things that precede; for there by "See all the wonders which I have put in thy hand" is signified the means of power from the spiritual, thus against the infesting falsities; and in the internal sense those things follow in a series to which the words of the sense of the letter are applied. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7032.">7032.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I will harden his heart, and he will not send away the people. That this signifies obstinacy, and thus not yet liberation, is evident from the signification of "hardening," as being obstinacy, and from the signification of the "heart," as being the will (see n. 2930, 3888), thus by these words is signified obstinacy from the will, consequently from the delight of doing evil, because that which is of the will is delightful, and this is from the love; and from the signification of "not sending away the people," as being from obstinacy not to be willing to set at liberty, thus not yet liberation. It is said here and in what follows that "Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh." This is so said from the appearance, and from the common notion of the Divine as doing all things; but this is to be understood in the same way as when evil, anger, fury, devastation, and other like things are attributed to Jehovah or the Lord (see n. 2447, 6071, 6991, 6997). [2] As regards the obstinacy of those who are in falsities and the derivative evils, and in evils and the derivative falsities, be it known that the obstinacy is such as cannot be described; for they never desist except through grievous punishments and the consequent fears; exhortations and threats are of no avail whatever, because the delight of their life is to do evil. They contracted this delight during their life in the world, especially from the fact that they loved themselves only and not the neighbor, thus being in no Christian charity. As people of this kind do not suffer themselves to be led by the Lord, they act from their own proper will, which is evil by heredity, and also by actual life; and they who act from their own will, do evil from love; for that which is of the will is of the love; and from this they have the delight of doing evil, and so far as they are in this delight, so far they are in obstinacy.  [3] That this is so does not appear in the world, because in the world they are withheld by the love of self and the love of the world, for they fear the loss of reputation, and of the consequent gain and honor, if they were to do evil openly. Moreover, the laws and the fear of the loss of life restrain them; but if these did not stand in the way, they would rush to destroy all who do not favor them, and would plunder them of all their property, and would mercilessly kill anyone. Such is man interiorly, that is, such is man as to his spirit, however much in this world he may appear different. This can be very plainly seen from them in the other life, for then the externals are taken away from those who have been such in the world, and they are left to their will, thus to their loves; and when they are left to these, they perceive nothing more delightful than to do evil, which also they do with such obstinacy that, as before said, they never desist except through punishments, and afterward by repeated sinkings down into hell. From all this it can be seen what a man is who is in no charity toward the neighbor; and also that everyone's life awaits him; not the civil life which was external and apparent in the world, but the spiritual life which was internal and did not appear in the world. </p>

 <p>And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh. That this signifies exhortation, is evident from the signification of "saying," when done by Divine command, as being exhortation; and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being falsity infesting the truths of the church, thus those who are in falsity and who infest (see n. 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692). </p>

 <p>Thus saith Jehovah. That this signifies from the Divine, that is, exhortation, is evident from what has been already said, and also from what follows. </p>

 <p>My son, My firstborn, is Israel. That this signifies that they who are in spiritual truth and good have been adopted, is evident from the signification of "son," when said by Jehovah, or the Lord, of those who are of the spiritual church, as being to be adopted (of which presently); from the signification of "firstborn," as being the faith of charity, which is of the spiritual church (see n. 367, 2435, 3325, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930); and from the representation of Israel, as being the spiritual church (n. 6637). That " My son, My firstborn, Israel," or those who are in spiritual truth and good, that is, who are of the spiritual church, have been adopted, and thus acknowledged as sons, is because the Lord by His coming into the world saved them (n. 6854, 6914); hence also, and likewise by virtue of faith in the Lord, they are called the "firstborn son." These are also meant by the Lord in John:      And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, and one Shepherd (John 10:16). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7036.">7036.</a></font></span>

 <p>Send My son away. That this signifies that they should abstain from infesting the truths of the church, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the falsity infesting the truths of the church (see n. 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692); from the signification of "sending away," as being a command to abstain; and from the signification of "son," as being those who are in spiritual truth and good, and have been adopted (of which just above, n. 7035). Hence it is plain that by "Send My son away" is signified that they should abstain from infesting those who are in the truths of the church. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7038.">7038.</a></font></span>
 <p>That they may serve Me. That this signifies elevation into heaven in order to perform uses therefrom, is evident from the signification of "serving Jehovah," or the Lord, as being to perform uses; and as this is said of those of the spiritual church who have been saved by the coming of the Lord, and who before His coming were in the lower earth, and were afterward elevated into heaven (n. 6854, 6914), and thereby came into a state of performing uses, therefore by "that they may serve Me" is signified elevation into heaven in order to perform uses therefrom. That "to serve the Lord" denotes to perform uses, is because true worship consists in the performance of uses, thus in the exercises of charity. He who believes that serving the Lord consists solely in frequenting a place of worship, in hearing preaching there, and in praying, and that this is sufficient, is much mistaken. The very worship of the Lord consists in performing uses; and during man's life in the world uses consist in everyone's discharging aright his duty in his station, thus from the heart being of service to his country, to societies, and to the neighbor, in dealing sincerely with his fellow, and in performing kind offices with prudence in accordance with each person's character. These uses are chiefly the works of charity, and are those whereby the Lord is chiefly worshiped. Frequenting a place of worship, hearing sermons, and saying prayers, are also necessary; but without the above uses they avail nothing, because they are not of the life, but teach what the life must be. The angels in heaven have all happiness from uses, and according to uses, so that to them uses are heaven.  [2] That happiness is from Divine order according to uses, can be seen from the things in man which correspond to those which are in the Grand Man; as those from the external senses, namely, from sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, which as has been shown at the end of many chapters, are correspondent. These senses therefore have delights exactly in accordance with the uses which they perform; the most delightful is the sense of conjugial love, on account of its greatest use, because from this comes the propagation of the human race, and from the human race, heaven; the delight of taste follows next, because it serves for the nourishment and thereby for the health of the body, in accordance with which is the sound action of the mind; the delight of smell is less, because it merely serves for recreation: and thus also for health; the delight of hearing and that of sight are in the last place, because they merely take up those things which will be of service to uses, and wait upon the intellectual part, and not so much the will part. [3] From these and other like facts it becomes plain that it is uses according to which happiness is given in heaven by the Lord; and that it is uses through which the Lord is mainly worshiped. From this it is that John lay on the Lord's breast at table, and that the Lord loved him more than the rest; but this was not for his own sake, but because he represented the exercises of charity, that is, uses. (That John represented these, see the preface to Gen. 18 and 22, and n. 3934.) 7038a. And if thou refuse to send him away. That this signifies obstinacy even to the last, is evident from the signification of "refusing to send him away," as being not to liberate in consequence of obstinacy (as above, n. 7032). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7039.">7039.</a></font></span>
 <p>Behold I will slay thy son, thy firstborn. That this signifies the extinction of faith without charity, and the consequent devastation of truth with them, is evident from the signification of "slaying," as being extinction; and from the signification of "son, the firstborn," namely, of Pharaoh and the Egyptians, as being faith without charity (see n. 3325). For by Pharaoh and the Egyptians are represented the memory-knowledges which are of the church (n. 4749, 4964, 4966, 6004), thus which are of faith, for these are of the church. But because they turned these memory-knowledges into magic (n. 6692), and from this their works were evil, and devoid of any charity, therefore by their "firstborn" are signified such things as are of the memory-knowledge of faith, thus faith without charity. That these are signified by the "firstborn of Egypt," is evident from the signification of the "firstborn of Israel," as being the faith of charity (of which above n. 7035). [2] It is said "faith without charity," but by "faith" is here meant the memory-knowledge of such things as are of faith, for there is no faith where there is no charity. With those who are not in charity the things of faith are merely things of memory, and are in the memory under no other form than is any other memory-knowledge; and there is not there even the memory-knowledge of truth which is of faith, because it is defiled with ideas of falsity, and also serves as a means to defend falsities. As this is the case with faith without charity, it is therefore extinguished with the evil in the other life, and they are completely devastated as to truth, in order to prevent truths from being made into means for their evils, and thus lest hell should in some way have dominion in them over such things as are of heaven, and lest they should thereby hang between heaven and hell. This extinction and this devastation of truth are what is signified by the firstborn in Egypt being slain. That the Egyptians afterward perished in the sea Suph represented the subsequent state of damnation or the spiritual death of such persons, for as soon as the things of faith or of truth are taken away from them (which had been like wings that lifted them up), they soon sink down like weights into hell. </p>

 <p>Verses 24-26. And it came to pass in the way, in the inn, that Jehovah met him, and sought to kill him. And Zipporah took a stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and made it touch his feet; and she said, Because a bridegroom of bloods art thou to me. And He ceased from him. Then she said, A bridegroom of bloods as to circumcisions. "And it came to pass in the way, in the inn," signifies that the posterity of Jacob were in externals without an internal; "that Jehovah met him," signifies opposition; "and sought to kill him," signifies that a representative church could not be instituted with that posterity; "and Zipporah took a stone," signifies the quality shown by the representative church by means of truth; "and cut off the foreskin of her son," signifies the removal of filthy loves, and thereby the laying bare of the internal; "and made it touch his feet," signifies that the quality of the natural was then shown; "and she said, Because a bridegroom of bloods art thou to me," signifies that it was full of all violence and hostility against truth and good; "and He ceased from him," signifies that it was permitted that they should represent; "then she said, A bridegroom of bloods as to circumcisions," signifies that although the internal was full of violence and hostility against truth and good, still circumcision was to be received as a sign representative of purification from filthy loves. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7041.">7041.</a></font></span>
 <p>And it came to pass in the way, in the inn. That this signifies that the posterity of Jacob were in externals without an internal, is evident from the representation of Moses here. In what precedes, and in what follows, the subject treated of in the internal sense is the spiritual church, which is meant by the "sons of Israel;" but in these three verses it is that this church was to have been instituted among the posterity of Jacob, but that it could not be instituted among them because they were in externals without an internal. For this reason Moses here does not represent the law or the Word, but that nation or posterity from Jacob of which he was to be the leader; thus he also represents the worship of that nation, for everywhere in the Word a leader or judge, and also a king, represents the nation and people of which he is the leader, judge, or king, because he is its head (see n. 4789). This is the reason why Moses is not here named, and yet by its coming to pass in the way, in the inn, he is meant, and that Jehovah then met him, and sought to kill him, when yet He had before so expressly commanded that he should go and return to Egypt. By "being in the way" is signified what is instituted; and by the "inn" is signified the external natural or sensuous (n. 5495). And because as before said the subject treated of is the church to be instituted among that posterity, therefore that is signified which belonged to that nation, namely, an external without an internal, thus also an external natural or sensuous, but separated. (That the sensuous separated from the internal is full of fallacies and the consequent falsities, and that it is against the truths and goods of faith, see n. 6948, 6949.) [2] Before the things which follow are unfolded, see what has been already shown concerning that posterity, namely, that with them there was the representative of a church, but not a church (see n. 4281, 4288, 6304); that Divine worship among them was merely external separate from internal, and that to this worship they were driven by external means (n. 4281, 4433, 4844, 4847, 4865, 4899, 4903); that they were not chosen, but that they obstinately insisted upon being a church (n. 4290, 4293); that they were of such a nature that they could represent holy things, although they were in bodily and worldly loves (n. 4293, 4307); that that nation was such from its first origins (n. 4314, 4316, 4317); and many other things which have been shown concerning that nation (see n. 4444, 4459, 4503, 4750, 4815, 4818, 4820, 4825, 4832, 4837, 4868, 4874, 4911, 4913, 5057, 6877). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7042.">7042.</a></font></span>
 <p>That Jehovah met him. That this signifies opposition, is evident from the signification of "meeting," as being opposition, namely, to the possibility of any church being instituted with that nation. That it denotes opposition against the Divine, is signified by "Jehovah met him." From the sense of the letter it appears as if Jehovah or the Divine set Himself in opposition, because it is said that "Jehovah met him;" but the internal sense is that the opposition was against the Divine. For the Divine never opposes itself to anyone, but it is the man, or the nation, which opposes itself to the Divine; and when it opposes itself, as it cannot endure the Divine, it appears as if there were resistance by the Divine. How the case herein is can be seen from those who come into the other life, and desire to come into heaven, and yet are not such as to be capable of being there. When they are permitted to attempt what they desire, even when they are in the way and near to the entrance into heaven, they appear to themselves as monsters, and begin to be in anguish and torment, because they cannot endure the truth and good which are there; and they believe that heaven and the Divine have opposed themselves to them; when yet it is they who bring this upon themselves, because they are in what is the opposite. From this also it can be seen that the Divine does not oppose itself to anyone, but that it is the man who opposes himself to the Divine. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7043.">7043.</a></font></span>
 <p>And sought to kill him. That this signifies that a representative church could not be instituted with that posterity, is evident from the signification of "seeking to kill," as being not to receive (see n. 3387, 3395); here therefore not to receive or choose that nation, in order that a representative church might be instituted with it. That in these three verses that nation is constantly meant by "Moses," who was about to be its leader and head, may be seen above (n. 7041); and that that nation was not chosen, but that it obstinately insisted upon being a church (n. 4290, 4293); and also that no church, but only the representative of a church, was instituted with it (n. 4281, 4288, 6304); and that those things which are of the church, and are holy, can be represented even by the evil, because representation does not regard the person but the thing (n. 3670, 4208, 4281). The same is meant in the internal sense by its being said that Jehovah willed wholly to destroy that nation, and in its stead to raise up another nation from Moses (Num. 14:12); and also that Jehovah repented of bringing in that nation, and of having brought them into the land of Canaan. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7044.">7044.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Zipporah took a stone. That this signifies the quality shown by the representative church by means of truth, is here evident from the representation of Zipporah, as being the representative church; and from the signification of a "stone," as being the truth of faith. That circumcision was performed with knives of stone, signified that purification from filthy loves was effected by means of the truths of faith (n. 2039, 2046, 2799); for circumcision was representative of purification from these loves (n. 2799). The reason why purification is effected by means of the truths of faith, is that these teach what is good, and also what is evil, and thus what ought to be done, and what ought not to be done; and when man knows these truths, and wills to act according to them, he is then led by the Lord, and is purified by His Divine means. As the truths of faith teach what is evil and what is good, it is evident that by "Zipporah took a stone" is signified the quality shown by means of truth. That Zipporah represents the representative church is evident from what follows in these verses. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7045.">7045.</a></font></span>
 <p>And cut off the foreskin of her son. That this signifies the removal of filthy loves, and thereby the laying bare of the internal, is evident from the signification of "cutting off," as being to remove; from the signification of "the foreskin," as being earthly and bodily love, which defiles spiritual and celestial love (see n. 3412, 4462); and from the signification of "son," as being the truth of the representative church. That a "son" denotes truth may be seen above (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373); and that it denotes the truth of that church, is because Zipporah represents that church, and calls him her "son," and by him shows the quality of that nation, and hence the quality of its worship. That by the "foreskin" are signified filthy loves, is because the loins with the genitals correspond to conjugial love (n. 5050-5062); and because they correspond to conjugial love, they correspond to all celestial and spiritual love (n. 686, 4277, 4280, 5054); and therefore the foreskin corresponds to the most external loves, which are called bodily and earthly. If these loves are devoid of internal loves, which are called spiritual and celestial, they are filthy, as was the case with that nation, which was in externals without an internal. It is said "without an internal," and by this is meant no acknowledgment of truth, and no affection of good, thus no faith, and no charity, for these are of the internal man, and from them proceed the activities of charity, which are external goods. This internal, which is devoid of faith and charity, and yet is full of evils and falsities, is called by the Lord "empty" (Matt. 12:43-45); hence it is said, "an external without an internal." Now as by the "foreskin" are signified loves the most external, therefore when they are removed, as is signified by Zipporah's cutting off the foreskin, the quality of these loves appears, thus the laying bare of the internal. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7046.">7046.</a></font></span>
 <p>And made it touch his feet. That this signifies that the quality of the natural was then shown, is evident from the signification of "making it touch," as being to show, for a thing is shown by the touch; and from the signification of the "feet," as being the natural (see n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952). By the quality of the natural being shown, is meant the quality of that nation interiorly, which appears when the exterior is removed. The interior with man in the world cannot appear until the exterior has been removed; because with the evil the exterior acts quite differently from what the interior wills and thinks; for the man feigns what is honorable, what is just, and also Christian good or charity; and this in order that it may be believed that he is such inwardly. He is compelled so to act by fears of the loss of gain, of reputation, and of honor, and fears of the penalties of the law and of the loss of life. But when these fears have been removed, and he acts from his interior, then like a madman he plunders another's property, and breathes the destruction and death even of his fellow-citizens, as is the case in civil wars. That the interiors are such is still more manifest from the evil in the other life, for the externals are then taken away from them, and the internals are laid bare (see n. 7039), and then it is discovered that many who in the world have appeared as angels, are devils.  [2] This great disagreement between the interiors and exteriors is an indication that the state of man has been utterly perverted; for such a disagreement has no existence with a man who is in what is sincere, just, and good; he speaks as he thinks, and thinks as he speaks. But it is far otherwise with those who are not in what is sincere, not in what is just, and not in what is good; with these the interiors disagree with the exteriors. That the Jewish nation was of this character is described by the Lord in Matthew in these words:      Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of robbery and intemperance. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside may be clean also. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye make yourselves like unto whited sepulchers, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity (Matt. 23:25-28). </p>

 <p>And she said, For a bridegroom of bloods art thou to me. That this signifies that it was full of all violence and hostility against truth and good, is evident from the signification of "bridegroom," as here being a representative of the church, or its external, when the representative church itself is the "bride" (that in these three verses Moses represents that nation, and the representative of a church among them, see n. 7041; and that Zipporah represents the representative church, n. 7044). As Zipporah represents this church, and Moses its external, therefore Zipporah does not call him her "husband," or "man," but her "bridegroom," for a bride and a bridegroom can represent what is diverse, but not a man, or husband, and a wife, because the conjugial makes a one. And from the signification of "blood," as being violence done to charity, (n. 374, 1005), and as being truth falsified and profaned (n. 4735, 6978), thus hostility against truth and good. </p>

 <p>And He ceased from him. That this signifies that it was permitted that they should represent, is evident from the signification of "ceasing from him," namely, from killing him, as being permission that they should represent; for that "Jehovah sought to kill him," signified that a representative church could not be instituted with that nation (see n. 7043); and therefore when it is now said that "He ceased from him," it signifies that it was permitted that they should represent, that is, that there should be instituted with that nation the representative of a church, but not a church. That it is one thing to represent a church, and another to be a church, is evident from the fact that even the evil can represent a church, but none except the good can be a church; for to represent a church is merely external (n. 3670, 4208, 4281). </p>

 <p>Then she said, A bridegroom of bloods as to circumcisions. That this signifies that although the internal was full of violence and hostility against truth and good, still circumcision was to be received as a sign representative of purification from filthy loves, is evident from the signification of a "bridegroom of blood," as being what is full of all violence and hostility against truth and good (of which above, n. 7047); and from the signification of "circumcision," as being a sign representative of purification from filthy loves (see n. 2039, 2632, 3412, 3413, 4462, 4486, 4493). This is said by Zipporah, because it was now permitted that nation to represent the church, which is signified by "ceasing from killing him" (n. 7048). Circumcision was made a sign representative of purification, because by "cutting off the foreskin" was signified the removal of filthy loves, and thereby the laying bare of the internal (n. 7045); and therefore when the internal is not at all attended to, as was the case with that nation, which was in externals without an internal, there then remains the signification of circumcision or the cutting off of the foreskin, namely, the removal of filthy loves, thus purification, for which reason it could serve as a representative sign. </p>

 <p>That in these three verses there are secrets which cannot possibly be known without the internal sense, is evident from the details in them; for who would know what is signified by Jehovah, after He had commanded Moses to go to Egypt, presently, when he was in the way, meeting him, and seeking to kill him? Who would know what is signified by Zipporah, when she had cut off the foreskin of her son, making it touch his feet, and saying to Moses that he was a bridegroom of bloods to her, and also afterward by her saying that he was a bridegroom of bloods as to circumcisions? Who does not see that secrets have been stored up in these things, and that these secrets cannot possibly be disclosed except from the internal sense? </p>
