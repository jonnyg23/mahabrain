 <p>In the breastplate of judgment. That this signifies a representative of heaven in respect to Divine truth shining forth from the Divine good of the Lord, is evident from the signification of "the breastplate of judgment," as being Divine truth shining forth from the Divine good of the Lord (see n. 9857); and as being a representative of heaven (n. 9879, 9882). </p>

 <p>Upon his heart. That this signifies from the Divine love to eternity, is evident from the signification of "the heart," as being the good of love (see n. 3313, 3635, 3883-3896, 7542, 9050); consequently, when said of the Lord, who is here represented by Aaron, it denotes the Divine love. Consequently "to carry upon the heart" denotes to preserve to eternity from the Divine love. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9903.">9903.</a></font></span>
 <p>When he goeth in unto the holiness. That this signifies in all worship, is evident from the signification of "going in unto the holiness," as being worship; for all Aaron's ministration at the altar and in the Tent of meeting was called "holiness," and this ministration was worship. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9904.">9904.</a></font></span>
 <p>For a remembrance before Jehovah continually. That this signifies from mercy to eternity, is evident from the signification of "remembrance," when said of the Divine, as being to preserve or deliver, from mercy (n. 9849); and from the signification of "continually," as being to eternity. </p>

 <p>And thou shalt put unto the breastplate of judgment the Urim and Thummim. That this signifies the shining forth of Divine truth from the Lord in ultimates, is evident from the signification of "the breastplate of judgment," as being Divine truth shining forth from the Divine good of the Lord (see n. 9857); and from the signification of "the Urim and Thummim," as being light and the shining forth therefrom. That "the Urim and Thummim" denote light shining forth, is because through the stones in the breastplate the light of heaven shone forth with variety according to the answers that were being given through them. For this reason they were of different colors. For the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good appears before the angels as light, and from it is all the light of heaven. The colors derived from it, which are modifications of this light with the angels, are variegations of intelligence and wisdom with them; for all wisdom and intelligence are from this Divine truth or light. From this it can be seen that by the shining forth of various colors from this light, Divine truths, which are answers, are presented to view in the heavens. In like manner there was a shining forth through the Urim and Thummim, when inquiry was made of the Divine. But be it known that when the shining forth appeared, then at the same time an answer to the subject of inquiry was given in an audible voice. This was done through angels, to whom this answer was revealed by the Lord by means of such a shining forth; for, as before said, Divine truths which are answers appear in this manner in the heavens. [2] (That the light of heaven is the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good, see n. 1053, 1521-1533, 1619-1632, 2776, 3094, 3138, 3167, 3190, 3195, 3222, 3223, 3337, 3339, 3341, 3636, 3643, 3862, 3993, 4060, 4180, 4302, 4408, 4414, 4415, 4419, 4527, 4598, 5400, 6032, 6313, 6315, 6608, 6907, 7174, 8644, 8707, 8861, 9399, 9407, 9570, 9571; and that colors appear in the heavens, and that they are modifications of this light with the angels, thus are variegations of intelligence and wisdom with them, n. 3993, 4530, 4677, 4742, 4922, 9466, 9467, 9865.)  [3] That this is the case, is also evident from the signification of "the Urim and Thummim;" for "Urim" means a shining fire; and "Thummim," the shining forth therefrom; the "shining fire" denotes the Divine truth from the Divine good of the Lord's Divine love, and the "shining forth" denotes this same truth in ultimates, thus in the effect. But be it known that in the Hebrew tongue "Thummim" means "integrity;" but in the angelic tongue a "shining forth." It is said "in the angelic tongue" because the angels converse with one another from the very essence of the subject perceived inwardly within themselves, thus according to its quality. From this the speech flows forth into a conformable sound that is audible to the angels only. The shining forth of the Divine truth is, in sound, "Thummim," whence comes its name. The like is perceived by the angels when thum is read in the Hebrew tongue, by which is signified what is entire, or integrity. It is from this that by "integrity," <a name="fr_216"></a><a href="#fn_216"><font size="1">9905-1</font></a> in the internal sense of the Word, is signified Divine truth in the effect, which is a life according to the Divine commandments (as can be seen from many passages in the Word; as Josh. 24:14; Judges 9:16, 19; Ps. 25:21; 37:37; 84:11; 101:2; 119:1). [4] From this also it is that the Urim and Thummim are called "the judgment of the sons of Israel," also "the breastplate of judgment," and likewise "the judgment of Urim;" for "judgment" signifies Divine truth in doctrine and in life, as may be seen above (n. 9857). From all this it can now be seen that through the Urim and Thummim, that is to say, through the shining forth of the light of heaven, the breastplate revealed Divine truths in the natural sphere, thus in ultimates. There is also a similar shining forth inwardly with those who are in truths from good, which dictates, and as it were gives answers, when truth is sought from the affection of the heart, and when it is loved as good. That there is such a shining forth, whereby Divine truth is revealed from heaven in the natural man, with those who are enlightened from the Word, is not perceived in the world, for the reason that it is not known that any light from heaven enlightens man's understanding. But that such is the case has been given me to perceive, and also to see. Be it known further that this shining forth appears in ultimates, because all things that belong to light from the Divine descend even to the ultimate bounds; and because they descend to these, they also shine forth there, and from thence. This then is the reason why the breastplate was put upon the ephod, and above its girdle; for the ephod represented Divine truth in ultimates (n. 9824); and its girdle represented a general bond, that all things might be held in connection (n. 9828, 9837). Therefore it is said, "and they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod, that it may be upon the girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate withdraw not from upon the ephod" (verse 28 of this chapter). The reason why the names of the sons of Israel were also engraved on it, was that the twelve tribes likewise represented all things of Divine good and truth in the heavens, consequently heaven together with all the societies there; and that they represented various things according to the order in which they are mentioned in the Word (see n. 3858, 3862, 3926, 3939, 4060, 4603, 6335, 6337, 6397, 6640, 7836, 7891, 7973, 7996, 7997). </p>

 <p>And they shall be upon Aaron's heart. That this signifies from the Divine good of the Lord's Divine love, may be seen above (n. 9902). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9907.">9907.</a></font></span>
 <p>When he goeth in before Jehovah. That this signifies in all worship, is evident from the signification of "going in before Jehovah," or what is the same thing, "to the holiness," as being worship (see above, n. 9903). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9908.">9908.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Aaron shall carry the judgment of the sons of Israel. That this signifies the Divine truth of heaven and of the church, is evident from the signification of "judgment," as being Divine truth in doctrine and in life (see n. 9857). As it was the Urim and Thummim which are here called "judgment," it is the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord, and that shines forth in ultimates, which is here meant by "judgment," for the Urim and Thummim have this signification (n. 9905). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9909.">9909.</a></font></span>
 <p>Upon his heart before Jehovah continually. That this signifies perpetually shining forth from good, is evident from the signification of "the heart," as being the good of love (see n. 3313, 3635, 3883-3896, 7542, 9050); and from the signification of "continually," as being perpetually. The reason why it means shining forth, is that the breastplate was upon the heart, and by "the breastplate" is signified Divine truth shining forth from the Lord's Divine good (n. 9823). </p>

 <p>Verses 31-35. And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue. And there shall be a mouth of the head of it in the midst thereof; there shall be a lip for the mouth of it round about, the work of the weaver, as the mouth of a coat of mail it shall be, that it be not rent. And upon the skirts of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of crimson, and of scarlet double-dyed, upon the skirts thereof round about; and bells of gold in the midst of them round about; a bell of gold and a pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about. And it shall be upon Aaron to minister; and the voice thereof shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holiness before Jehovah, and when he goeth out; that he die not. "And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod," signifies Divine truth in the internal form in the spiritual kingdom; "all of blue," signifies by means of influx from the good of the celestial kingdom; "and there shall be a mouth of the head of it in the midst thereof," signifies the method of the influx from what is above; "there shall be a lip for the mouth of it round about," signifies bounded and closed on every side; "the work of the weaver," signifies from the celestial; "as the mouth of a coat of mail it shall be, that it be not rent," signifies thus strong and safe from injury; "and upon the skirts of it thou shalt make," signifies in the extremes where is what is natural; "pomegranates," signifies memory-knowledges of good; "of blue, and of crimson, and of scarlet double-dyed," signifies from the good of charity and of faith; "upon the skirts thereof round about," signifies in the extremes where the natural is, on every side; "and bells of gold" signifies all things of doctrine and of worship from good passing over to those who are of the church; "in the midst of them round about," signifies from what is within the memory-knowledges of good on every side; "a bell of gold and a pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about," signifies thus everywhere; "and it shall be upon Aaron," signifies a representative of the Lord; "to minister," signifies when engaged in worship and in evangelization; "and the voice thereof shall be heard," signifies the influx of truth with those who are in the heavens and who are on earth; "when he goeth in unto the holiness before Jehovah, and when he goeth out," signifies in every state of good and truth in worship; "that he die not," signifies that the representative does not perish, and therewith the conjunction with the heavens. </p>

 <p>And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod. That this signifies Divine truth in the internal form in the spiritual kingdom, is evident from the signification of "the robe," as being the spiritual kingdom in general, and specifically Divine truth there in the internal form (see n. 9825). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9912.">9912.</a></font></span>
 <p>All of blue. That this signifies by means of influx from the good of the celestial kingdom, is evident from the signification of "blue" [hyacinthinum], as being the celestial love of truth (see n. 9466), which is the good of mutual love; and the good of mutual love is the external good of the celestial kingdom; for the goods in the heavens proceed in order from the inmosts to the extremes, and they inflow in the same order as they proceed; for to proceed is to flow in. (In what order goods proceed, see n. 9873.) It is this external good of the celestial kingdom that flows into the internal good of the spiritual kingdom, which is signified by "the robe." From this comes-forth the good of the spiritual kingdom, which is the good of charity toward the neighbor. This is the reason why the robe was all of blue. With regard to the influx of goods, the case is this. There is no good which is good unless it has within it an interior good from which it is; the interior good from which it is makes its essence; whence it is that this interior good exists in the good which follows, almost as the soul exists in its body. It is this following good of which it is said that it proceeds from another good, which is more interior. That the good of charity toward the neighbor proceeds from the good of mutual love, which is a prior or interior good, has been shown several times. The good of mutual love is the external good of innocence, and unless the good of charity has within it the good of innocence, it is not the good of charity (n. 2526, 2780, 3183, 4797, 6765, 7840, 9262), consequently not unless it has within it the good of mutual love. This is the reason why the robe was to be all of blue; for "blue" denotes the good of mutual love, or what is the same thing, the external good of innocence; and "the robe" denotes Divine truth in the internal form in the spiritual kingdom, which is the same thing as the good of charity (n. 9825). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9913.">9913.</a></font></span>
 <p>And there shall be a mouth of the head of it in the midst thereof. That this signifies the method of the influx from what is above, is evident from the signification of "the mouth of the head of the robe in the midst thereof," as being where there is influx from what is above; or what is the same thing, from what is within, thus from the celestial kingdom into the spiritual kingdom. That the external good of the celestial kingdom flows into the internal good of the spiritual kingdom, may be seen just above (n. 9912).  That "the mouth of the head of the robe in the midst thereof" has this signification, is because by "the robe" is signified the spiritual kingdom, and specifically its internal (n. 9825); and by "the neck," where was the mouth of the head of the robe, is signified the influx, communication, and conjunction of celestial with spiritual things (n. 3542, 5320, 5328); for the head with man corresponds to the Lord's celestial kingdom, and the body to His spiritual kingdom; consequently the intervening neck, which is encompassed and clothed by the mouth of the head of the robe, corresponds to the intermediation or influx of the celestial kingdom into the spiritual kingdom.  [2] That such things are signified by "the mouth of the head of the robe in the midst thereof," may seem like an absurdity, especially to those who know nothing of heaven, and of the spirits and angels there, consequently nothing of correspondence. That there is a correspondence of all things in man with all things in the heavens has been shown at the end of many chapters (see the places cited in n. 9280); and also that in general the head corresponds to celestial things, the body to spiritual things, and the feet to natural things (n. 4938, 4939). From this it is plain that by virtue of its correspondence, the neck signifies the influx, communication, and conjunction of celestial with spiritual things. Consequently "the mouth of the head of the robe," which was made to encompass the neck, signifies the method of this influx; for by Aaron's garments were represented in general the things that belong to the Lord's spiritual kingdom (n. 9814). From this it is evident that by the description of its mouth or circuit is described the influx itself. Be it known moreover, that angels and spirits appear clothed in garments; and that each of their garments is representative; as is well known to all who are in the heavens. It is from this that each of Aaron's garments also was representative of such things as are in the heavens; for the Word that is from the Lord has been so written that there is conjunction by its means. That the man of the church does not know this, in spite of his having such a Word, is because he turns his interiors toward the world, insomuch that he cannot be raised toward heaven, and be instructed (n. 9706, 9707, 9709). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9914.">9914.</a></font></span>
 <p>And there shall be a lip for the mouth of it round about. That this signifies that it is bounded and closed on every side, is evident from the signification of "a lip," or border, round about the mouth or upper opening of the robe, as being that which is bounded and closed on every side; for this "lip," or border, which was round about, bounded and closed the robe. By this and what presently follows is described the method of the influx of celestial good into spiritual good. That this influx takes place by a method like that with man of the influx of forces from the head through the neck, is evident from what was said in the foregoing article about correspondence. [2] What the nature of this influx is, shall also be briefly told. All the first things, that belong to the head, that is, to the cerebrum and cerebellum, are gathered together there into little bundles of fibers, and into little nerves, and after being gathered together they are passed down through the neck into the body, and are there diffused in all directions, and move the organs in complete compliance with the will, which begins in the brains. Similar also is the downflow and inflow of powers and forces from the celestial kingdom (which is the head in the Grand Man, that is, in heaven) into the spiritual kingdom (which is like the body there). This influx is also what is meant and described by "the mouth of the head of the robe in the midst," and its bounding termination by "the lip round about." It is for this reason that by "the lip of its mouth" is signified what is bounded and closed on every side. The bounding itself is now described. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9915.">9915.</a></font></span>
 <p>The work of the weaver. That this signifies from the celestial, is evident from the signification of "the work of the weaver," as being from the celestial. By "work" is signified that which is done, or which comes-forth, thus that which is from something else; and "the weaver" denotes one who causes the thing to be, or to come-forth; thus he denotes the celestial, because the spiritual comes-forth from and through the celestial. (That the good of the celestial kingdom flows into the good of the spiritual kingdom, and causes this good to come forth, was shown above, n. 9913, 9914.) Whether we say "the good of the celestial kingdom," or "the celestial," it is the same thing; for the celestial is the good of the celestial kingdom. The case is similar with "the good of the spiritual kingdom," and "the spiritual." What the good of the celestial kingdom or the celestial is, and what the good of the spiritual kingdom or the spiritual is may be seen from the passages cited in n. 9277.) [2] There are three things in the heavens which follow on in order; namely, the celestial, the spiritual, and the natural; the celestial makes the inmost heaven, the spiritual the middle heaven, and the natural which proceeds from the spiritual makes the ultimate heaven. These same three things are in man, and in him they follow on in the same order as in the heavens; for a regenerated man is a heaven in the least form, corresponding to the Grand Man (n. 9279). But the faculties which receive these three things are called the will, the understanding, and the memory-knowledge by virtue of which is the thought or imagination of the external or natural man. The will receives the celestial, or good; the intellectual receives the spiritual, or truth from this good; and the memory-knowledge which makes the understanding of the natural man, brings the two former to a close. These three are signified in the Word by "the embroiderer," "the thinker," <a name="fr_217"></a><a href="#fn_217"><font size="1">9915-1</font></a> and "the weaver." (That "the embroiderer," or "the embroidered work" denotes memory-knowledge, see n. 9688; also that "the thinker," or that which is thought, denotes the understanding, n. 9598, 9688.) Thus "the weaver" denotes the will. The reason why "the weaver" denotes the will is that the will flows into the understanding, and weaves it, insomuch that the things which are in the understanding are woven fabrics from the will; for that which the will wills, it forms so as to appear to the sight in the understanding. This sight is thought, consequently by "the thinker" is signified the understanding. [3] As by Aaron's garments was represented the spiritual kingdom joined to the celestial kingdom (n. 9814); and as the celestial kingdom corresponds to the will in man, and the spiritual kingdom to the understanding in him (n. 9835), therefore in application to garments mention is made of "the work of the embroiderer," of "the thinker," and of "the weaver," and by these are signified things which are from the faculty of memory-knowledge, from the understanding, and from the will; or what is the same, from the natural, the spiritual, and the celestial. [4] That such things are signified, can be seen by all who believe that the Word is Divine, and that it therefore contains within it things that belong to the Lord, to heaven, and to the church; for these things are Divine. Apart from these, what purpose would be served by Jehovah Himself declaring of what, and by what work, the garments of Aaron should be made? and which of them should be the work of the embroiderer, which the work of the thinker, and which the work of the weaver? All these particulars are distinctly mentioned in what follows in the book of Exodus in these words:      Them hath He filled with wisdom of heart, to do all the work of the workman, and of the thinker, and of the embroiderer; in blue, and in crimson, and in scarlet double-dyed; and of the weaver, even of them that do all work, and of those who think thoughts (Exod. 35:35). "The workman" here denotes Divine celestial good, from which is the will of the regenerated man (n. 9846); his "work" is mentioned in the first place, because it is immediately from the Divine; and from celestial good all things are mediately born and proceed. </p>

 <p>As the mouth of a coat of mail it shall be, that it be not rent. That this signifies thus strong and safe from injury, is evident from the signification of "a coat of mail," as being what is strongly woven together; wherefore it is said, "that it be not rent," that is, that it be safe from injury. Something thus woven together is signified by this term in the original tongue. An idea of what is thus woven together can be had from correspondence; for in the internal sense there is here treated of the influx of celestial good into spiritual good. It is this influx which is signified by "the mouth of the head of the robe," and is described by "the work of the weaver," and "of a coat of mail;" and to this influx from the heavens corresponds in man the influx of life from the head through the neck into the body (n. 9913, 9914). And because to this influx corresponds the woven fabric of the neck which is of strong sinews; and lower down a kind of interwoven circle of bones; through both of which the influx is rendered safe from all injury, therefore, as before said, an idea can be had of the several expressions in this verse, namely, of what is signified by "the mouth of the head of the robe in the midst," by "the lip which is round about" it, by "the work of the weaver," and by "the mouth of the coat of mail" which it had, lest it should be rent. Be it known that all the representatives in nature bear relation to the human form, and have their signification according to this relation (n. 9496); and that all clothing derives its signification from that part of the body which it covers (n. 9827); consequently so also does this upper part of the robe which encompasses and covers the neck. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9917.">9917.</a></font></span>
 <p>And upon the skirts of it thou shalt make. That this signifies in the extremes where is what is natural, is evident from the signification of "the skirts of the robe," as being the extremes where is what is natural. For by "the robe" is specifically signified Divine truth in the spiritual kingdom in its internal form, and in general the spiritual kingdom (see n. 9825); and by "the skirts" which are round about below, are signified the extremes of this kingdom; and the extremes of the spiritual kingdom are natural. For the goods and truths in the heavens follow on in this order: in the highest or inmost heavens are celestial goods and truths; in the middle heavens are spiritual goods and truths; and in the ultimate heavens are natural goods and truths (concerning which succession in the heavens and with man, see what was said above, n. 9915). And because the memory-knowledges of truth and good are in the external or natural man, therefore also pomegranates were placed in the skirts, for by "pomegranates" are signified the memory-knowledges of good; and also among the pomegranates were bells of gold, because by "bells" are signified such things as are from memory-knowledges. [2] That "the skirts of the robe" denote the extremes where is what is natural, is evident from the passages of the Word where "skirts" are mentioned, as in Isaiah:      I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His skirts filled the temple (Isa. 6:1). By "the throne upon which the Lord was sitting" is signified heaven, and specifically the spiritual heaven (n. 5313, 8625); by "skirts" here are signified Divine truths in the ultimates or extremes, such as are the truths of the Word in the sense of the letter; which are said to "fill the temple" when they fill the church. The like is signified by "the skirts filling the temple" as by "the smoke and cloud filling the tabernacle," and also the temple, as repeatedly mentioned in the Word. (That by "smoke" is there signified Divine truth in ultimates, such as is the sense of the letter of the Word, see n. 8916, 8918; as also by a "cloud," n. 4060, 4391, 5922, 6343.) [3] That a woman laboring with an issue of blood was made whole when she touched the skirt of the Lord's garment (Matt. 9:20, 22), and in general that as many as touched the skirt of His garment were made whole (Matt. 14:36; Mark 6:56), signified that health went forth from the Divine extremes or ultimates; for that there are strength and power in the ultimates of good and truth which are from the Divine may be seen above (n. 9836); and also that answers are given there (n. 9905). In Matthew:      Jesus said of the Scribes and Pharisees that they do all their works to be seen of men, that they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the skirts of their robes (Matt. 23:5). It is here very evident that "the skirts of the robe" denote the external things which stand forth to view, and that "enlarging" them denotes to do works outwardly, so that they may appear, or be seen. [4] In Jeremiah:      Jerusalem hath sinned a sin, her uncleanness was in her skirts (Lam. 1:8, 9). "Uncleanness in the skirts" denotes in the deeds and words, thus in the extremes; for the extremes or outermost things derive their essence from the interior ones; and therefore when the interiors are unclean, the extremes also are unclean, although the uncleannesses may not appear before men; for the reason that men look at the outward form, and therefore do not see the interiors. Nevertheless these uncleannesses that are in the interiors appear before the angels, and in the other life are also uncovered with everyone, because external things are there taken away; consequently it becomes manifest what has been the quality of the works in their essence. [5] In Nahum:      I will uncover thy skirts upon thy faces, and I will show the nations thy nakedness (Nah. 3:5). "To uncover the skirts upon the faces" denotes to remove external things so that internal ones may appear; for in various ways the external things of the natural man hide the internal things, which are hypocrisies, deceits, lies, hatreds, revenges, adulteries, and other like things; and therefore when the external things are taken away, the internal ones appear in their uncleanness and filthiness. [6] In Jeremiah:      If thou say in thine heart, Wherefore have these things covered me up? For the multitude of thine iniquity have thy skirts been unveiled, thy heels have suffered violence. I will lay bare thy skirts upon thy faces, that thy disgraces may be seen, even thine adulteries (Jer. 13:22, 26, 27); speaking of the abominations of Jerusalem; "to unveil the skirts, and lay them bare" denotes to take away the external things which cover, so that the interiors may be seen; for a man learns to counterfeit what is good, honorable, and sincere, for the sake of reputation, honor, and gain, when yet he has evils and falsities of various kinds hidden within. As by "skirts" are signified external things, therefore mention is also made of "heels," because "the heels" denote the lowest things of the natural (n. 259, 4938, 4940-4951). From all this it can now be seen that by "the skirts of the robe" are signified goods and truths in the ultimates or extremes, which are in the natural world. </p>

 <p>Pomegranates. That hereby are signified memory-knowledges of good, is evident from the signification of "pomegranates," as being the memory-knowledges of good (see n. 9552). That pomegranates were put upon the skirts of the robe, was because "the skirts" signified the ultimates or extremes of heaven and the church, and the ultimates or extremes of the church are memory-knowledges, as is evident from what was said above (n. 9915, 9917), about the successive order of goods and truths in the heavens and with man. The memory-knowledges of good and truth which are signified by "the pomegranates," are doctrinal things from the Word, which are memory-knowledges insofar as they are in the memory which is in the external or natural man. But when they enter into the memory which is in the internal or spiritual man, as is the case when the man lives according to them, then doctrinal things as to truth become of faith, and doctrinal things as to good become of charity, and are called spiritual. When this is done, they almost vanish out of the external or natural memory, and appear as it were innate, because they are then implanted in the man's life, like all those things which through daily use have become as it were of his nature. From this it is evident what memory-knowledges are, and what purpose they serve; consequently what purpose the doctrinal things of the church serve so long as they are kept solely in the memory; for so long as they are kept in the memory only, they have a place beneath intelligence and wisdom; and they do not ascend, or enter into the life, until they become of faith and charity in the internal man. </p>

 <p>Of blue, and of crimson, and of scarlet double-dyed. That this signifies from the good of charity and of faith, is evident from the signification of these things in n. 9687, 9833. The reason why fine linen was not interwoven, as in the ephod, is that the tunic, which was the inmost garment, was of fine linen; and this for the reason that "fine linen" signifies truth from a celestial origin (n. 5319, 9469), which is spiritual good itself proceeding from celestial good. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9920.">9920.</a></font></span>
 <p>Upon the skirts thereof, round about. That this signifies in the extremes where there is what is natural, on every side, is evident from the signification of "the skirts," as being the extremes where there is what is natural (see above, n. 9917); and from the signification of "round about," as being on every side; for where "the skirts" signify the extremes, the whole circumference which consists of the skirts, signifies the whole extreme, consequently, everywhere, or on every side. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9921.">9921.</a></font></span>
 <p>And bells of gold. That this signifies all things of doctrine and of worship from good passing over to those who are of the church, is evident from the signification of "bells," as being all things of doctrine and of worship passing over to those who are of the church (of which below); that they are from good is signified by their being of gold, for "gold" signifies good (see n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 8932, 9490, 9510, 9874, 9881, 9884). That "the bells" denote all things of doctrine and of worship passing over to those who are of the church, is because by means of the bells the people heard and perceived the presence of Aaron in his ministration, for by "the people" are signified those who are of the church, and by "Aaron's ministry" are signified all things of doctrine and of worship; and therefore it is said in what follows:      And they shall be upon Aaron to minister; and the voice thereof shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holiness before Jehovah, and when be cometh out (Exod. 28:35); from which it is plain what is signified by "the bells." The reason why these bells were put in the skirts, was that the holy things of doctrine are in the extremes, and the hearing and perception are there, and are from thence (see n. 9824, 9905). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9922.">9922.</a></font></span>
 <p>In the midst of them round about. That this signifies from what is within the memory-knowledges of good on every side, is evident from the signification of "in the midst," as being that which is within (see n. 1074, 2940, 2973, 5897); thus "in the midst," when said of the hearing and perception of doctrine and of worship, which are signified by "the bells," denotes from what is within; from the signification of "the pomegranates," in the midst of which were the bells, as being the memory-knowledges of good (n. 9918); and from the signification of "round about," as being on every side (as above, n. 9920). The reason why the bells were placed in the midst of the pomegranates, was that the memory-knowledges which are signified by "the pomegranates," are recipients, and are as it were vessels, of truth and good (n. 1469, 1496, 3068, 5373, 5489, 7770); and the doctrine and worship which are signified by "the bells," must be from the good and truth which are within the memory-knowledges, as in their vessels; if the doctrine and the worship are not from good and truth, but only from memory- knowledges, they have nothing of life. It is said that the doctrine and worship must be from the good and truth which are within the memory-knowledges; but not from the memory-knowledges apart from the good and truth.  [2] But as few can apprehend how the case herein is, it shall be unfolded to the apprehension insofar as this can be done. All things of the external or natural memory are called "memory-knowledges;" for there is an external memory, which is the memory of things in the natural world; and there is an internal memory, which is the memory of things in the spiritual world (n. 2469-2494, 2831, 5212, 9394, 9723, 9841). The things which have been inscribed on the internal memory are not called memory-knowledges, because they are things of the man's life; but they are called truths of faith and goods of love. These are the things which must be within memory-knowledges. For there is in man an external, which is called the external man; and an internal, which is called the internal man. The internal must be in the external, as the soul is in its body; thus the things which are in the internal man must be in those which are in the external man, for then there is a soul or life in the latter. Wherefore if there are no internal things, that is, things of the internal man, in the external things, there is no soul, and consequently no life, in them. And as the good of love and of faith is internal, it follows that this good must be in the external things, thus in the memory-knowledges; for as before said, the memory-knowledges are recipients and as it were vessels of internal things. Consequently the doctrine and the worship must be from what is within the recipients or vessels, and they are not in recipients and vessels which are empty or void of what is internal. From all this it is evident how it is to be understood that all things of doctrine and of worship must be from the interior things of the memory-knowledges of good, which is signified by the bells of gold being in the midst of the pomegranates.  [3] Be it known further that there are memory-knowledges of good, and memory-knowledges of truth; and that the truths in them are again vessels recipient of good, for the truths of faith are vessels of the good of love. For the illustration of this subject see what has been already said and shown about memory-knowledges, namely: That memory-knowledges are things of the memory in the natural man (n. 3293, 3309, 3310, 4967, 5212, 5774, 5874, 5886, 5889, 5934): That the internal man is opened by means of memory-knowledges (n. 1495, 1548, 1563, 1895, 1940, 3085, 3086, 5276, 5871, 5874, 5901): That memory-knowledges are means for growing wise, and also means for becoming insane (n. 4156, 4760, 8628, 8629): That memory-knowledges are vessels of truth, and truths are vessels of good (n. 1469, 1496, 3068, 3079, 3318, 5489, 5881, 6023, 6071, 6077, 6750, 7770, 8005, 9394, 9724): That memory-knowledges are of service to the internal man (n. 1486, 1616, 2576, 3019, 3020, 3665, 5201, 5213, 6052, 6068, 6084, 9394): That when memory-knowledges, which are things of the external memory, become of the life, they vanish out of the external memory; but remain inscribed on the internal memory (n. 9394, 9723, 9841): That the man who is in the truths of faith from the good of charity, can be raised above memory-knowledges (n. 6383, 6384): That this is called being raised above the things of the senses (n. 5089, 5094, 6183, 6313, 6315, 9730): That when a man dies he carries with him into the other life the memory-knowledges, that is, the things of the external memory; but that they are then quiescent; and in what manner (n. 2475-2486, 6931). </p>

 <p>A bell of gold and a pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about. That this signifies thus everywhere and wholly, namely, that the doctrine and the worship must be from what is within the memory-knowledges, is evident from what has been shown just above concerning the bells and the pomegranates. The repetition involves that it must be thus everywhere. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9924.">9924.</a></font></span>
 <p>And it shall be upon Aaron. That this signifies a representative of the Lord, is evident from the representation of Aaron, as being a representative of the Lord in respect to the good of love (see n. 9806, 9809); here in respect to those things which concern evangelization and worship; because such things are signified by "the bells in the midst of the pomegranates," and by "the voice to be heard therefrom when Aaron went in unto the holiness." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9925.">9925.</a></font></span>
 <p>To minister. That this signifies when engaged in worship and in evangelization, is evident from the signification of "ministering," when said of Aaron, by whom is represented the Lord, as being worship and evangelization. By "worship" is signified everything that is representative of worship from the good of love and the truths of faith; for the worship that is from these is truly worship, whereas worship without these is like a shell without a kernel, and like a body without a soul. And yet such was the worship with the Jewish and Israelitish nation, for this worship merely represented internal things, which, as has been said, are of love and faith. Nevertheless the Lord provided that such worship should be perceived in the heavens, and that thus by means of it there should be effected the conjunction of heaven with man; not indeed through internal things, but through correspondences with external things (on which subject see the places cited in n. 9320, 9380). This is the worship that is signified by "the ministry of Aaron." [2] That evangelization is also signified is because by evangelization are meant all things in the Word which treat of the Lord, and all things in worship which represented Him. For evangelization is annunciation about the Lord, His coming, and the things that are from Him which belong to salvation and eternal life. And as all things of the Word in its inmost sense treat solely of the Lord, and all things of worship represented Him, therefore the whole Word is the Evangel, in like manner all worship that was done according to the things commanded in the Word. And because the priests presided over the worship, and likewise taught, therefore by their "ministry" were signified worship and evangelization. </p>

 <p>And the voice thereof shall be heard. That this signifies the influx of truth with those who are in the heavens and who are on earth, is evident from the signification of "being heard," as being reception and perception (see n. 5017, 5471, 5475, 7216, 8361, 9311), consequently also influx, because the things which are received and perceived must flow in; and from the signification of "the voice," when said of Aaron, by whom is represented the Lord, as being Divine truth (see n. 8813); for "the voice" denotes the annunciation of this truth, and because it denotes its annunciation, it exists with those who are in the heavens and on earth. For Divine truth fills all things of heaven, and makes all things of the church. Such an annunciation was represented by the voice from the bells of gold, when Aaron went in unto the holiness before Jehovah, and when he came out, as is said in what now follows in this verse. [2] That in the Word a "voice" signifies the Divine truth which is heard and perceived in the heavens and on earth, is evident from the following passages. In David:      The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters; the voice of Jehovah is in power; the voice of Jehovah is with honor; the voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; the voice of Jehovah cleaveth as a flame of fire; the voice of Jehovah maketh the wilderness to tremble; the voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to calve; but in His temple everyone saith, Glory (Ps. 29:3-9). In this psalm Divine truth is treated of, in that it destroys falsities and evils; this Divine truth is "the voice of Jehovah;" but the "glory" which is spoken of denotes the Divine truth in heaven and in the church. (That "glory" denotes the Divine truth, see n. 9429; and that the "temple" denotes heaven and the church, n. 3720.) [3] In John:      To Him who is the Shepherd of the sheep the doorkeeper openeth; and the sheep hear His voice. The sheep follow Him, because they know His voice. A stranger they follow not, because they know not the voice of strangers. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also   I must bring, and they shall hear My voice. But ye are not of My sheep, for My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me (John 10:2-5, 16, 26, 27). That the "voice" here denotes the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, thus the Word, is very evident; "the voice of strangers" denotes falsity. [4] In Isaiah:      The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, for the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed. The voice saith, Cry. O Zion, that tellest good tidings, get thee up upon the high mountain! O Jerusalem, that tellest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength! lift it up. Behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength (Isa. 40:3, 5, 6, 9, 10; also John 1:23). "The voice" here denotes annunciation from the Word about the coming of the Lord, thus it also denotes the Divine truth which the Word announces; "the wilderness" denotes the state of the church at that time, which was as it were in the wilderness because the Word was no longer understood; "the glory which shall be revealed" denotes the Word as to its interiors. (That this is meant by "glory," may be seen above, n. 9429.) That "Jehovah, for whom a way was to be prepared," and "the Lord Jehovih, who should come in strength," denote the Lord, is plain, for this is clearly stated. [5] In Isaiah:      The voice of thy watchmen; they shall lift up the voice when they shall see eye to eye that Jehovah will return to Zion (Isa. 52:8); "the watchmen" denote those who search the Scriptures concerning the coming of the Lord, their "voice" denotes the Word, which is the Divine truth that is the source. In Jeremiah:      The Maker of the earth by His understanding hath stretched out the heavens. At the voice which He uttereth there is a multitude of waters in the heavens (Jer. 5:12, 13; 51:6). "The voice" here denotes Divine truth; "waters" denote truths which are in the heavens and from the heavens. (That "waters" in the Word denote truths, see n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, 9323.) [6] So also in the following passages:      The voice of the Son of man was like the sound of many waters (Rev.1:15).      I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters (Rev. 14:2).      The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters, Jehovah is upon great waters (Ps. 29:3). Jehovah hath uttered His voice before His army, for without number is he that doeth His word (Joel 2:11). In this passage also "voice" denotes Divine truth, and likewise the Word which they do. Again:      Jehovah shall utter His voice from Jerusalem, so that the heavens and the earth shall shake (Joel 3:16).      Sing psalms unto the Lord, ye kingdoms of the earth, to Him that rideth upon the heaven of heaven of old; lo, He shall utter in a voice a voice of strength (Ps. 68:32, 33).      I say unto you, The hour cometh when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live (John 5:25). That "the voice" in this passage denotes Divine truth, consequently the Word of the Lord, is manifest. [7] In Ezekiel:      The spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great earthquake, saying, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah. And I heard the voice of the wings of the living creatures, and the voice of the wheels, even the voice of a great earthquake (Ezek. 3:12-13).      The voice of the wings of the cherubs was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Shaddai when He speaketh (Ezek. 10:5). Here also "the voice" denotes Divine truth; for "the cherubs" signify the providence and guard of the Lord that there be no approach to Himself and to heaven except through the good of love (n. 9277, 9509); "the voice of the wings," and "the voice of the wheels," denote spiritual truths.  [8] In the present verse, in which Aaron is treated of, it is the sound or ringing from the bells which is called a "voice." In other passages of the Word also sounds and blarings from trumpets, and sounds and peals from thunders, are called "voices;" and thereby in like manner are signified Divine truths (see n. 7573). Moreover, the sounds of musical instruments of various kinds have also a like signification; but those which give out a stridulous and a discrete sound signify Divine spiritual truths; while those which give out a continuous sound signify Divine celestial truths (n. 418-420, 4138, 8337). From this it is evident that by the sounds or "voices" of the bells are signified Divine spiritual truths; for the garments of Aaron, and specifically the robe, in the skirts of which were the bells, round about, represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom or heaven (n. 9814, 9825). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9927.">9927.</a></font></span>
 <p>When he goeth in unto the holiness before Jehovah, and when he goeth out. That this signifies in every state of good and truth in worship, is evident from the signification of "going in unto the holiness," and of "going in before Jehovah," as being worship (of which above, n. 9903, 9907). That it is the state of good and truth in worship which is signified, is because all things of worship with the Israelitish and Jewish nation were representative of internal worship; and internal worship is from good and truth; that is, from the affection of good and from the faith of truth. That it is every state of these which is signified, is because it is said, "when he goeth in, and when he goeth out," and by "going in and going out" are signified all the things of the state. For whatever belongs to motion, as "walking," "going," "advancing," signifies a state of life. (That "walking" has this signification, see n. 519, 1794, 3335, 4882, 5493, 5605, 8417, 8420; in like manner "advancing," and "journeying," n. 8103, 8181, 8397, 8557; and that motions and progressions in the other life signify states, n. 1273-1277, 1376-1381, 2873, 3356, 9440.) From this it is evident that "going in and going out" denote everything of the state or thing that is being treated of; and as the subject here treated of is worship from good and truth, it is every state of good and truth in worship that is signified by "going in and going out." [2] This signification of "going in and going out" is from the representatives in the other life; for there they go, walk, advance, go in and out, just as in the world; but all these acts are done according to the state of the life of their thoughts and affections (as may be seen in the places above cited). That these acts also originate from their thoughts and affections, and are correspondences, and thus real appearances, they do not notice. From this it is evident that all things of motion signify those which belong to the state of life; consequently that "going in and going out" signify every state of life, thus the state of the thing that is being treated of, from beginning to end. It is from this that among the ancients it was a customary form of speaking to say that they knew a person's coming in and his going out, or his entrance and his departure, when they meant that they knew every state of his life. And as this form of speaking originates from the correspondences in the other life, as has been already said, therefore in the Word also a like expression is made use of, and where this is done the like is signified; as in the following passages. In the first book of Samuel:      Achish called David, and said unto him, Thou art upright, and good in mine eyes is thy going out and thy coming in with me in the camp; for I have not found evil in thee (1 Sam. 29:6). "Good in the eyes is thy going out and thy coming in" denotes that every state of his life was well-pleasing to him. [3] In the second book of Samuel:      Thou knowest Abner, that he came to persuade thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest (2 Sam. 3:25). "To know the going out and the coming in" denotes to know all the thoughts and all the acts of the life; and therefore it is also said, "and to know all that thou doest." In the second book of Kings:      I know thy sitting down, and thy going out and thy coming in, and that thou hast set thyself in motion against Me (2 Kings 19:27; Isa. 37:28); where Sennacherib the king of Assyria is spoken of; "knowing his going out and his coming in" denotes all things of his counsel. In David:      Jehovah shall keep thee from all evil, He shall keep thy soul. Jehovah shall keep thy going out and thy coming in, from this time forth and even for evermore (Ps. 121:7, 8). "To keep the going out and the coming in" denotes everything of the life according to the state of good and truth. [4] In Moses:      Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the assembly, who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, that the assembly of Jehovah be not as a flock that hath no shepherd (Num. 27:16, 17). "Who may go out before them, and who may come in before them," denotes one who may lead them; thus one whom they may look to and follow in every state of life. In John:      He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. I am the shepherd of the sheep; by Me if anyone enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and shall find pasture (John 10:1, 2, 9). "To enter in" (that is, into heaven), denotes into the good of love and faith, for this good makes heaven; and therefore "to go in and to go out," denotes to be led by the Lord in respect to every state of life; consequently it denotes to think and will what is good from freedom, that is, from love and faith which are from the Lord, for these make freedom.  [5] In Luke:      Jesus sent the twelve disciples to preach the kingdom of God. And He said unto them, Into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence go out (Luke 9:2-4). "To enter into a house," "to abide there," and "to go out thence," denote to enjoy heavenly consociation with those who receive the Lord in faith and love; for in heaven those who are together in one society are also in one "house," and they come in and go out there, because they are in a like good; but those who are in an unlike good cannot do so; and if they do enter in, they do not enter by the doors, but by some other way. He who does not know that such things are signified, cannot know what is involved in the words, that "into whatsoever house they should enter, they should there abide, and thence go out." [6] In Ezekiel:      When the prince shall go in, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go out by the way thereof. When the people of the land shall go in before Jehovah in the appointed feasts, he that goeth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that goeth in by the way of the south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate; he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he had gone in, but shall go straight before him. But when the prince goeth in in the midst of them, they shall go in; and when they shall go out, they shall go out (Ezek. 46:8-10). In the internal sense a new heaven and a new church are here treated of; and by "the prince" is signified the truth of faith from the good of love. In what manner this truth enters in with angels in the heavens and with men of the church on earth, and how it afterward progresses toward the interiors when it has entered in by an external way, and toward the exteriors when it has entered by an internal way, is described by the going in and going out of the prince and of the people of the land. "The south" denotes the state of the truth of faith in the internal man; and "the north," its state in the external man; "the going in and going out" denote the state of life as to good and truth, thus as to worship. [7] From all this it can be known clearly enough that "to go in and go out" denote such things as belong to the state of life from good and truth; for otherwise what could it matter that the prince should go in by one way, or by another way? and also the people of the land? For by "the house" or temple there mentioned, into which there was entrance, and out of which there was going out, is signified heaven and the church (see n. 3720); by "the prince" is signified the truth of faith (n. 5044); by "the people of the land," those who are in heaven, or who are of the church (n. 2928); by "the way," that which leads to truth (n. 627, 2333); by a "gate," doctrine (n. 2851, 3187); by "the south," where truth is in light (n. 9642), thus truth in the internal man; and by "the north," where truth is in obscurity (n. 3708), thus truth in the external man. </p>

 <p>That he die not. That this signifies that the representative does not perish, and therewith the conjunction with the heavens, is evident from the signification of "dying," when said of Aaron and his office, as being the ceasing of the representatives, and consequently of conjunction with the heavens; for by Aaron was represented the Lord, and by his office the whole work of salvation, and on the part of man, worship. That this worship was representative, and that by means of representative worship there was conjunction with the heavens, has been abundantly shown. (See the places cited in n. 9320; also what was the representative of a church with the Israelitish and Jewish nation, n. 9280, 9457, 9481, 9576, 9577; and that the conjunction of the Lord and of heaven with man at that time was by means of representatives, n. 9481.) From this also it was that when Aaron was performing holy things he was clothed with garments that represented heavenly things; and that if he had done otherwise he would have died; especially if he had gone in to perform holy things without the knowledge of the people; for with the people there was the representative of a church, and with Aaron the representative of the Lord, from whom and toward whom is everything of worship. </p>

 <p>Verses 36-38. And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and engrave upon it with the engraving of a signet, Holiness to Jehovah. And thou shalt put it upon a thread of blue, and it shall be upon the miter; over against the faces of the miter shall it be. And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, and Aaron shall bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the sons of Israel shall sanctify, in respect to all the gifts of their holy things; and it shall be upon his forehead continually, to make them well-pleasing before Jehovah. "And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold," signifies enlightenment from the Lord's Divine good; "and engrave upon it with the engraving of a signet," signifies what is perpetual and impressed on hearts according to the heavenly sphere; "Holiness to Jehovah," signifies the Divine Human of the Lord, and from this all celestial and spiritual good; "and thou shalt put it upon a thread of blue," signifies influx into the truth of celestial love; "and it shall be upon the miter," signifies from infinite wisdom; "over against the faces of the miter it shall be," signifies to eternity; "and it shall be upon Aaron's forehead," signifies from the Lord's Divine love; "and Aaron shall bear the iniquity of the holy things," signifies the consequent removal of falsities and evils with those who are in good; "which the sons of Israel shall sanctify, in respect to all the gifts of their holy things," signifies acts of worship representative of removal from sins; "and it shall be upon Aaron's forehead continually," signifies a representative of the Lord's love to eternity; "to make them well-pleasing before Jehovah," signifies the Divine of the Lord in them. </p>

 <p>And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold. That this signifies enlightenment from the Lord's Divine good, is evident from the signification of "a plate," as being enlightenment; and from the signification of "gold," as being the good of love, here the Lord's Divine good, because there was inscribed upon it, "Holiness to Jehovah." (That "gold" denotes the good of love, see n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 8932, 9490, 9510, 9874, 9881.) That "the plate" denotes enlightenment, was from its brightness, for it was resplendent from gold upon Aaron's forehead, and all brightness signifies enlightenment such as is in the heavens from the Lord as the Sun. Enlightenment in the heavens is wisdom and intelligence from the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord from that Sun, for this enlightens their interiors. Their interiors correspond to the understanding with man, which is enlightened by the Lord when the truth and good of the church and heaven are perceived; for the understanding is the recipient subject; because without a subject there is no reception. That this "plate" denotes enlightenment from the Lord's Divine good, is because upon it was inscribed "Holiness to Jehovah," and it was placed upon the front of the miter, which was upon Aaron's head. The "holiness" which is from Jehovah denotes the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good (n. 6788, 8302, 8330, 9229, 9680, 9820). In order that this plate might represent the shining forth, that is, the enlightenment, from which come wisdom and intelligence, it was bound on the forefront of the miter. [2] As by "the plate" was signified enlightenment from the Lord's Divine good, it was also called "the plate of the crown of holiness," and likewise "the crown of holiness;" for a crown is a representative of Divine good, and "holiness" denotes the Divine truth thence proceeding, as was said above. That it was called "the plate of the crown of holiness," is plain in what follows in this book of Exodus:      Lastly they made the plate of the crown of holiness of pure gold, and wrote upon it with the writing of the engravings of a signet, Holiness to Jehovah (Exod. 39:30). That it was also called "the crown of holiness," is evident from another passage in Exodus:      Thou shalt set the miter upon his head, and put the crown of holiness upon the miter (Exod. 29:6).      He set the miter upon his head; and upon the miter, opposite the faces of it, did he set the plate of gold, the crown of holiness (Lev. 8:9). [3] That a crown represented Divine good from which is Divine truth, is evident from the crowns of kings; for kings represented the Lord in respect to Divine truth (see n. 2015, 2069, 3009, 4581, 4966, 5044, 5068, 6148); wherefore they had a crown on the head, and a scepter in the hand; for government from Divine good was represented by a crown, and government from Divine truth by a scepter. [4] That a "crown" has this signification is evident from the following passages. In David:      I will make a horn to bud unto David; I will set in order a lamp for Mine anointed. His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon Himself shall His crown flourish (Ps. 132:17, 18); "David" here denotes the Lord (n. 1888), like the "anointed" (n. 3008, 3009); his "horn" denotes power (n. 2832, 9081); "a lamp" denotes the Divine truth from which is intelligence (n. 9548, 9783); the "crown" denotes the Divine good from which is wisdom, and from which is also His government; the crown, which denotes wisdom, is said "to flourish" because in respect to the Human He acquired wisdom in the world by means of combats against and victories over the hells (n. 9548, 9783), which are the "enemies that shall be clothed with shame." [5] Again:      Thou art angry with Thine anointed, Thou hast condemned His crown even to the earth (Ps. 89:38, 39); where also "the anointed" denotes the Lord; "anger" denotes a state of temptations which existed when He was in combats with the hells; the lamentation at that time is described by "anger" and "condemnation;" as for instance the last lamentations of the Lord on the cross, that He was "forsaken;" for the cross was the last of the temptations, that is, of the combats with the hells; and after this last temptation He put on Divine good, and in this way united His Divine Human to the Divine Itself that was in Him.  [6] In Isaiah:      In that day shall Jehovah Zebaoth be for a crown of adornment, and for a diadem of comeliness, to the remains of His people (Isa. 28:5); where "a crown of adornment" denotes the wisdom which is of good from the Divine; "a diadem of comeliness," the intelligence of truth from this good; this is predicated of Divine things with the people; the "people" here denote the church, because it was there. [7] In the same:      For Zion's sake I will not be silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation burn as a lamp; and thou shalt be a crown of comeliness in the hand of Jehovah, and a miter of the kingdom in the hand of thy God (Isa. 62:1, 3). By "Zion" and "Jerusalem" is meant the church, by "Zion" the celestial church, and by "Jerusalem" the spiritual church thence derived; "a crown of comeliness" denotes the wisdom which is of good, and "a miter of the kingdom," the intelligence which is of truth; and as by "a crown" is signified the wisdom which is of good, therefore it is said to be "in the hand of Jehovah;" and as by "a miter" is signified the intelligence which is of truth, therefore it is said to be "in the hand of God;" for where good is treated of, the name "Jehovah" is used, and where truth is treated of, the name "God" (n. 2586, 2769, 6905). [8] In Jeremiah:      Say thou to the king and to the mistress, Renounce yourselves, sit down; for the adornment of your head is come down, even the crown of your comeliness (Jer. 13:18); where "the crown of comeliness" denotes the wisdom which is of good from Divine truth, for "comeliness" denotes the Divine truth of the church (n. 9815). In the same:      The joy of our heart hath ceased; our dance is turned into mourning; the crown of our head is fallen (Lam. 5:15, 16). "The crown of the head" denotes the wisdom which those who are of the church have from Divine truth, by virtue of which they are more excellent than the rest of the peoples, and hence have a kind of government. [9] In Ezekiel:      He put a jewel upon thy nose, and earrings in thine ears, and a crown of adornment upon thine head (Ezek. 16:12). The subject here treated of is the setting up of the church; "a jewel upon the nose" denotes the perception of good; "earrings in the ears" denote the perception of truth, and obedience; "a crown upon the head" denotes the wisdom thence derived. In Job:      He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken away the crown of my head (Job 19:9); where "glory" denotes the intelligence which is of Divine truth (n. 9429); "the crown of the head" denotes the wisdom thence derived. [10] In Revelation:      Upon the thrones I saw four and twenty elders, clothed in white garments; who had upon their heads golden crowns. They fell down before Him that was sitting upon the throne, and worshiped Him that liveth forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne (Rev. 4:4, 10). The "four and twenty elders" signify all those who are in good from truths, and in the abstract sense all goods from truths (n. 6524, 9404); the "thrones" denote truths from the Divine (n. 5313, 6397, 8625, 9039); the "golden crowns on their heads" are representatives of wisdom from the Divine, and because this is from the Divine, therefore they cast them before Him that was sitting upon the throne.  [11] As the good of wisdom is acquired by means of temptation combats, which are carried on by means of the truths of faith, therefore crowns were assigned to those who fought against evils and falsities and overcame; and for this reason also the crowns of martyrdom were badges of command from the Lord over evils. That "crowns" denote the rewards of victory over evils, and that for this reason they denote the goods of wisdom, because these are the rewards, is also evident from Revelation:      I saw, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon it had a bow; and there was given unto him a crown; and he went forth conquering, and to conquer (Rev. 6:2). The "white horse and he that sat upon it" signify the Lord as to the Word (n. 2760-2762); "a bow" denotes the doctrine of truth, by means of which the combat is waged (n. 2686, 2709); from this it is evident that the "crown," because said of the Lord, denotes the Divine good, which is the reward of victory. [12] And in another passage:      Afterward I saw, and behold a white cloud; and upon the cloud one sitting like unto the Son of man, having upon his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle (Rev. 14:14). "A white cloud" denotes the literal sense of the Word (n. 4060, 4391, 5922, 6343, 6752, 8781); "the Son of man" denotes the Divine truth which is from the Lord (n. 9807); "a golden crown," the Divine good from which is the Divine truth; "a sharp sickle" denotes the dispersing of evil and falsity. And again:      Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life (Rev. 2:10).      Behold I come quickly; hold fast that which thou hast, that no one take thy crown (Rev. 3:11). The "crown" denotes good from truths, thus wisdom; for this belongs to the good of love from the truths of faith. From all this it can now be seen what is signified by a "crown," and what by "the crown of holiness," which was the plate of gold on which was engraved "Holiness to Jehovah." </p>

 <p>And grave upon it with the engraving of a signet. That this signifies what is perpetual and impressed on hearts according to the heavenly sphere, is evident from the signification of "to engrave," as being to impress on the memory (see n. 9841, 9842), thus also on the heart; for that which is impressed on the interior memory, which belongs to the life, is said to be "impressed on the heart," and as this remains to eternity, it also signifies what is perpetual; and from the signification of "the engraving of a signet," as being the heavenly sphere (n. 9846). The reason why it is said to be "impressed on hearts according to the heavenly sphere," is that the things which have been impressed on the memory, especially on the interior memory, which is the book of life (see n. 2474), have been impressed according to the heavenly sphere; for a man who is in the good of love from the truths of faith resembles heaven, and moreover, is a heaven in the least form (see the places cited in n. 9279, 9632); thus in him there is the heavenly form; for all the societies in heaven have been set in order in accordance with the heavenly form, because all the affections of good and the consequent thoughts of truth flow in accordance with this form (n. 9877). (That when a man is in heavenly love all the memory-knowledges are arranged in the heavenly form, and that love so arranges them, see n. 6690.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9932.">9932.</a></font></span>
 <p>Holiness to Jehovah. That this signifies the Divine Human of the Lord, and from this all celestial and spiritual good, is evident from the signification of "holiness," as being the Divine that proceeds from the Lord, thus as being the Lord Himself in respect to the Divine Human, from which is everything Divine in the heavens. It is from this that celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord from the Lord; and spiritual good, which is the good of love toward the neighbor from the Lord, are holy. For the Lord alone is holy, and that which proceeds from Him is the only holiness in the heavens and on earth (see n. 9229, 9680, 9820). (That the holiness proceeding from the Lord is called "the Holy Spirit," see n. 9818; and that angels, prophets, and apostles, are called "holy" from their reception of Divine truth from the Lord, n. 9820; and also that "the sanctuary" denotes heaven from the Divine there, n. 8330, 9479.) It is said, "Holiness to Jehovah," because "Jehovah" in the Word denotes the Lord (see the places cited in n. 9373). The reason why "Holiness to Jehovah" was engraved on the plate of gold, and placed upon the miter upon Aaron's forehead, was that in this way it was in the view of all the people, consequently there was holiness in their minds while they were in worship, and this holiness corresponded to the holiness that is in the universal heaven, which is the Divine Human of the Lord; for as before said this makes heaven. That which is in the general view of all the people, and which thereby reigns universally in their minds, enters into everything of thought and of affection, and consequently into everything of worship, and affects it (n. 6159, 6571, 7648, 8067, 8865); and therefore when this very great holiness was constantly before their eyes, and from this reigned universally in their minds, it made holy all things of worship. </p>

 <p>And thou shalt put it upon a thread of blue. That this signifies influx into the truth of celestial love, is evident from the signification of "blue," as being the truth of celestial love (of which below). Influx into this truth is signified by the plate on which was engraved "Holiness to Jehovah" being put upon a thread of blue, for in this way it hung from it and was bound to it, and in the spiritual sense by "being bound to," and "hanging," is signified to inflow, because all conjunction whatever is effected by means of influx. That the influx is into the truth of celestial love about the Lord's Divine Human, which is signified by "Holiness to Jehovah," is because in that sphere of heaven where is the truth of celestial love, no other Divine is perceived than the Divine Human of the Lord.  [2] For the case herein is as follows. There are three heavens, which have been distinguished from one another by means of the degrees of good. In the inmost heaven is the good of celestial love, which is the good of love to the Lord; in the second or middle heaven is the good of spiritual love, which is the good of charity toward the neighbor; in the first or ultimate heaven is the good of natural love, from spiritual and from celestial love, which is the good of faith and obedience. In each heaven there is an internal and an external. As just said, the internal in the inmost heaven is the good of love to the Lord, and the external there is the good of mutual love, which belongs to the love of good for the sake of good. This good is what is meant by the truth of celestial love, which is signified by "the thread of blue." In the sphere where is this truth, the Lord's Human is perceived as being the Divine Itself in the heavens, and therefore as soon as an angel is raised into this sphere, he comes into this light also. This perception flows in from the Lord, because the Divine Human of the Lord makes heaven. This is the influx which is here signified. (That "blue" denotes the celestial love of truth, or what is the same thing, the truth of celestial love, see n. 9466, 9687, 9833.) </p>

 <p>And it shall be upon the miter. That this signifies from infinite wisdom, is evident from the signification of "the miter," as being intelligence (see n. 9827); and when said with reference to the Lord, who was represented by Aaron, the "miter" denotes Divine or infinite wisdom. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9935.">9935.</a></font></span>
 <p>Over against the faces of the miter shall it be. That hereby is signified to eternity, is evident from the signification of "over against the faces of the miter," when said of the Lord, who is represented by Aaron, as being to eternity (see n. 9888). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9936.">9936.</a></font></span>
 <p>And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead. That this signifies from the Lord's Divine love, is evident from the representation of Aaron, as being the Lord as to Divine good, which is the good of His Divine love (see n. 9806); and from the signification of "the forehead," when it refers to the Lord, as being His Divine love; for by "the face of the Lord," or what is the same, by "the face of Jehovah," are signified all things of the Divine love; such as mercy, peace, good, wisdom (n. 222, 223, 5585, 6848, 6849, 9306, 9545, 9546). That "the face of Jehovah" or "the face of the Lord" has this signification, is because by "the face" in general are signified the interior things of man, which are his affections and the consequent thoughts, thus the things that belong to his love and faith (see the places cited in n. 9546). The reason why these things are signified by "the face," is that they shine forth from the face as it were in their type or effigy; wherefore also the face is called the effigy of the mind. Hence it is that by "the face," when said of Jehovah or the Lord, are signified the things which are of His Divine love. That by "the forehead" is specifically signified the Divine love itself, is because the interiors have been allotted their provinces in the face; those which are of love being in the province of the forehead; those which are of wisdom and intelligence being in the province of the eyes; those which are of perception being in the province of the nostrils; and those which are of utterance being in the province of the mouth. From this it is evident why "the forehead," when said of the Lord, who is represented by Aaron, signifies the Divine love. [2] As the forehead with man corresponds to his love, therefore they who are in celestial love (that is, in love to the Lord from the Lord) are said to have "a mark on their foreheads," by which is signified that they are under the Lord's protection, because they are in His love, as in the following passages:      Jehovah said, Go through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that groan and sigh for all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof; and smite; let not your eye spare; but come not near against any man upon whom is the mark (Ezek. 9:4-6).      Behold the Lamb standing on the Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having the name of His Father written on their foreheads (Rev. 14:1).      They shall see the faces of God and of the Lamb, and His name shall be on their foreheads (Rev. 22:4).      It was said that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, nor any tree; but only the men that have not the mark of God on their foreheads (Rev. 9:4). [3] "Having the mark," or seal, "of God," and "the name of God," "on their foreheads," denotes to be in safety from the infestation of evils which are from hell, because they are in the Lord through love; "the grass and the green thing," which were not to be hurt, denote the memory-truth through which is the truth of faith (n. 7571, 7691); "the tree," which also was not to be hurt, denotes the perception of truth from good (n. 103, 2163, 2722, 2972, 4552, 7692). [4] In Moses:      Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God from all thine heart, and from all thy soul, and from all thy strengths. Thou shalt bind these words for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes (Deut. 6:5, 8). "To be for frontlets" denotes for a sign of love to Jehovah God; it is said "between the eyes," because "the eyes" signify the intelligence and wisdom which are from this love, and wisdom from this love is to have God continually before the eyes. That this is the meaning is evident, because love to Jehovah God is treated of. It is said that they should "love Him from all the heart, from all the soul, and from all the strengths," by which is signified with all that is in man. "From the heart" denotes from the will in which is the good of love (n. 7542, 9050, 9300, 9495); "from the soul" denotes from the understanding in which is the truth of faith, thus from faith (n. 9050), which two are of the internal man; "from all the strengths" denotes from the things that belong to the understanding and the will in the external man. The strengths and power of the love of both the external and the internal man are signified by "the hands" (n. 4931-4937, 7518); and therefore it is said that "these words shall be bound for a sign upon the hand." [5] As by virtue of its correspondence "the forehead" signifies heavenly love with the good; so with the evil it signifies infernal love, which is opposite to heavenly love. The forehead of the latter is called a "brazen forehead" in Isaiah 48:4; and a "hardened forehead" in Ezekiel 3:7, 8; and of those who are in infernal love it is said that "they had the mark of the beast upon their foreheads" (Rev. 13:16; 14:9; 20:4); and also "the name of Babylon upon their foreheads" (Rev. 17:5). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9937.">9937.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Aaron shall bear the iniquity of the holy things. That this signifies the consequent removal of falsities and evils with those who are in good from the Lord, is evident from the representation of Aaron, as being the Lord in respect to the good of love (see n. 9806); and from the representation of the priesthood which Aaron administered, as being the whole office which the Lord discharges as the Savior (n. 9809); from the signification of "bearing iniquity," as being the removal of falsities and evils with those who are in good (of which below); and from the signification of "the holy things," as being the gifts which they brought to Jehovah or the Lord in order that their sins might be expiated, which gifts were burnt-offerings, sacrifices, and meat-offerings. That these things are meant by "the holy things," is clear, for it is said, "which the sons of Israel shall sanctify in respect to all the gifts of their holy things." That "bearing iniquity" denotes to remove falsities and evils, or sins, with those who are in good, is because it is said of the Lord, for the Lord was represented by Aaron, and the whole work of salvation was represented by the office, or priesthood, of Aaron. That it is said of the Lord that He "bore sins" for the human race, has been known in the church; but still it is not known what is meant by "bearing iniquities and sins." It is believed by some that it denotes that He took on Himself the sins of the human race, and suffered Himself to be condemned even to the death of the cross; and that because the condemnation for sins was cast on Him, mortals were thus freed from damnation; and also that the damnation was taken away by the Lord through the fulfilling of the law, because the law would have condemned everyone who did not fulfil it. [2] But these things are not meant by "bearing iniquity," because every man's deeds remain with him after death, and according to the quality of these he is then judged either to life or to death. Their quality is from his love and his faith, for love and faith make the life of a deed; and therefore they cannot be taken away by transfer to another who would bear them. From this it is evident that something else is meant by "bearing iniquities;" but what is meant can be seen from the bearing itself of iniquities or sins by the Lord. For the Lord bears them when He fights for man against the hells, because man cannot fight against these from himself; but the Lord alone does this, and indeed continually for every man, but with a difference according to his reception of the Divine good and Divine truth.  [3] When the Lord was in the world, He fought against all the hells, and completely subjugated them. From this He also became righteousness. Thus He redeemed from damnation those who receive the Divine good and truth from Him. Unless this had been done by the Lord, no man could have been saved; for insofar as the Lord does not remove them, the hells are constantly with man, and have dominion over him; and He removes them in proportion as the man desists from evils. He who once conquers the hells, conquers them to eternity; and in order that this might be done by the Lord, He made His Human Divine. He, therefore, who alone fights for man against the hells (or what is the same thing, against evils and falsities, for these are from the hells) is said "to bear sins," for He alone supports this burden. That by "bearing sins" is also signified the removal of evils and falsities from those who are in good, is because this is the consequence; for insofar as the hells are removed from man, so far evils and falsities are removed, because as before said both of these are from the hells. Evils and falsities are "sins" and "iniquities." How the case herein is can be seen from what was shown above (n. 9715, 9809), where the Lord's merit and righteousness, and also the subjugation of the hells by Him are treated of. [4] The reason why it is said of Aaron that he should "bear iniquities," was that he represented the Lord, and his priesthood represented the Lord's whole work of salvation (n. 9806, 9809); and the main work of salvation is to redeem and deliver man from the hells, and thus to remove evils and falsities. It is said to remove evils and falsities, because deliverance from sins (that is, the forgiveness of them) is nothing else than their removal; for they remain with the man; but insofar as the good of love and the truth of faith are implanted, so far the evil and falsity are removed. The case herein is like that with heaven and hell. Heaven does not abolish hell; but removes from itself those who are there. For it is the good and truth from the Lord which make heaven; and these are what effect this removal. The case is similar with man, who of himself is a hell; but when he is being regenerated, he becomes a heaven, and insofar as he becomes a heaven, so far hell is removed. It is a common opinion that evils, that is, sins, are not removed in this way; but are absolutely separated. But such persons are not aware that from himself the whole man is nothing but evil, and that insofar as he is kept in good by the Lord, the evils which belong to him appear as if they were rooted out; for when a man is kept in good, he is withheld from evil. Nevertheless no one can be withheld from evil and kept in good unless he is in the good of faith and of charity from the Lord; that is, only insofar as he suffers himself to be regenerated by the Lord. For as before said, heaven is implanted in man by regeneration, and thereby the hell which is with him is removed.  [5] From all this it can be seen again that "bearing iniquities," when said of the Lord, denotes to continually fight for man against the hells, thus continually to remove them; for there is a perpetual removing, not only while man is in the world, but also in the other life to eternity. It is impossible for any man to remove evils in this way; for from himself man cannot remove the least of evil, still less the hells, and least of all to eternity. (But see what has been shown on this subject before, namely, that the evils with man are not absolutely separated; but are removed insofar as he is in this good from the Lord, n. 8393, 9014, 9333-9336, 9444-9454.) (That while He was in the World the Lord conquered the hells by means of the combats of temptations, and thereby disposed all things into order; and also that He did this from Divine love, in order to save the human race; and that thus He also made His Human Divine, may be seen in the places cited in n. 9528e; and also that in temptations, which are spiritual combats against the evils which are from hell, the Lord fights for man, n. 1692, 6574, 8159, 8172, 8175, 8176, 8273, 8969.) How the Lord while in the world bore the iniquities of the human race, that is, fought with the hells and subjugated them, and thus acquired for Himself the Divine power of removing these things with all who are in good, and thus became merit and righteousness, is described in Isaiah 59:16-20; 63:1-9, as has been already explained (n. 9715, 9809). [6] When these things are understood, it can be known what is signified by all that is said in the fifty-third chapter of the same prophet concerning the Lord, in which from beginning to end the state of His temptations is treated of; thus the state in which He was while He fought with the hells, for temptations are nothing else than combats with these. This state is thus described:      He bore our sicknesses, and carried our griefs; He was pierced for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities; Jehovah made to fall on Him the iniquity of us all; and thus He gave the wicked to their sepulcher; the will of Jehovah shall prosper by His hand; He shall see from the labor of His soul and be sated; and by His wisdom shall justify many, because He hath borne their iniquities, and thus hath carried the sin of many (Isa. 53:4-5). He is also called there "the Arm of Jehovah," by which is signified Divine power (n. 4932, 7205). That by "bearing sicknesses," "sorrows," and "iniquities," and by "being pierced and bruised by them," is signified a state of temptations, is evident; for in such a state there are griefs of soul, distresses, and despairs, which in this way cause anguish. Such things are induced by the hells, for in temptations they assault the very love of him against whom they fight; the love of everyone being the inmost of his life. The Lord's love was the love of saving the human race, which love was the Esse of His life, for this love was the Divine in Him. In Isaiah also, where the subject treated of is the combats of the Lord, this is described in these words:      He said, Surely they are My people, therefore He became their Savior. In all their distress He was distressed; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and He took them up, and carried them all the days of eternity (Isa. 63:8, 9). [7] That while He was in the world the Lord endured such temptations, is only briefly described in the Gospels, but at great length in the prophets, and especially in the Psalms of David. In the Gospels it is only said that He was led into the wilderness, and was afterward tempted by the devil, and that He was there forty days, and was with the beasts (Mark 1:12, 13; Matt. 4:1). But that from His earliest childhood even to the end of His life in the world He was in temptations, that is, in combats with the hells, He did not reveal, in accordance with these words in Isaiah:      He was oppressed, and was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth; He is led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, He opened not His mouth (Isa. 53:7). His last temptation was in Gethsemane (Matt. 26; Mark 14), and then came the passion of the cross; that He thereby fully subjugated the hells, He Himself teaches in John:      Father, rescue Me from this hour. But for this sake came I into this hour. Father, glorify Thy name. Then came there a voice out of heaven, saying, I have glorified it and will glorify it. Then said Jesus, Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out (John 12:27, 28, 31). "The prince of the world" is the devil, thus all hell; "to glorify" denotes to make the human Divine. The reason why mention is made only of the temptation after forty days in the wilderness, is that "forty days" signify and involve temptations to the full, thus the temptations of many years (n. 8098, 9437); "the wilderness" signifies hell, and "the beasts with which He fought there" signify the diabolical crew.  [8] The removal of sins with those who are in good, that is, those who have practiced repentance, was represented in the Jewish Church by the he-goat called "Asasel," upon the head of which Aaron was to lay his hands, and to confess the iniquities of the sons of Israel, and all their transgressions in respect to all their sins, and was then to send it into the wilderness, and that in this way the he-goat should bear upon him all their iniquities into a land of separation (Lev. 16:21, 22). By Aaron is here represented the Lord; by "the he-goat" is signified faith; by "the wilderness," and "the land of separation," hell; and by "bearing thither the iniquities of the sons of Israel" is signified to remove them, and cast them into hell. No one can know that such things were represented, except from the internal sense; for everyone can see that the iniquities of a whole congregation could not be borne into the wilderness by any he-goat; for what had the he-goat in common with iniquities? But as at that time all representatives signified such things as belong to the Lord, to heaven and to the church, so also did these. The internal sense therefore teaches what these things involve, namely, that it is the truth of faith by means of which man is regenerated, consequently by means of which sins are removed; and because the faith of truth is from the Lord, it is the Lord Himself who effects this; according to what was said and shown in the preface to Genesis 22, and also in n. 3332, 3876, 3877, 4738. (That Aaron represents the Lord, see n. 9806, 9810; also that a "he-goat of the goats" denotes the truth of faith, n. 4169, 4769.) That "the wilderness" denotes hell, is because the camp in which were the sons of Israel signified heaven (n. 4236); and therefore the wilderness is called a "land of separation," or of "cutting off." Thus by "bearing iniquities into that land," that is into the wilderness, is signified to cast evils and falsities into hell, from which they are; and they are cast thither when they are removed so as not to appear, which is effected when a man is withheld from them by being kept in good by the Lord, according to what was said above. [9] The like that was signified by the casting out of sins into the wilderness is signified by "casting them forth into the depths of the sea," as in Micah:      He will have compassion upon us; He will suppress our iniquities; and He will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea (Micah 7:19). "The depth of the sea" also denotes hell. [10] From all this it is now evident that by "Aaron bearing the iniquities of the holy things," is signified the removal of sins by the Lord from those who are in good; and that their removal is continually being effected by the Lord; and that this is meant by "bearing iniquities." So also in another passage in Moses:      Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons with thee shall hear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. The sons of Israel shall no more come nigh the Tent of meeting, to bear sin, by dying. But the Levite shall do the work of the Tent, and they shall bear their iniquity (Num. 18:1, 22, 23). The like is meant by "bearing," in Isaiah:      Attend unto Me O house of Israel that have been carried from the womb. Even to old age I am the same, and even to hoar hairs will I carry; I have made, and I will carry; yea, I will bear, and will rescue (Isa. 46:3, 4). [11] That "bearing iniquity" denotes to expiate, thus to remove sins, is evident in Moses:      Moses was indignant with Eleazar and with Ithamar because the he-goat of the sacrifice of sin had been burnt, saying, Wherefore did ye not eat it in the place of holiness, seeing that Jehovah hath given it you to bear the iniquities of the congregation, to expiate them before Jehovah (Lev. 10:16, 17)? (That "expiation" means a cleansing from evils, thus removal from sins, see n. 9506; and that Aaron was enjoined to expiate the people, and to pardon their sins, Leviticus 4:26, 31, 35; 5:6, 10, 13, 16, 18; 9:7; 15:15, 30.) That "to bear sins," when not said of the priesthood, denotes to be damned, thus to die, see Leviticus 5:1, 17; 7:18; 17:16; 19:8; 20:17, 19, 20; 22:9; 24:15; Numbers 9:13; 18:22; Ezekiel 18:19, 20; 23:49. </p>

 <p>Which the sons of Israel shall sanctify in respect to all the gifts of their holy things. That this signifies acts of worship representative of removal from sins, is evident from the signification of "gifts" or "offerings," which among the Israelitish and Jewish nation were chiefly burnt-offerings, sacrifices, and meat-offerings, as being the interior things of worship, for these were what they represented. The interior things of worship are those which are of love and faith, and from this forgivenesses of sins, that is, removals from them, because sins are removed through faith and love from the Lord. For insofar as the good of love and of faith enters, or what is the same thing, so far as heaven enters, so far sins are removed, that is, so far hell is removed, both that which is within man, and that which is without him. From this it is evident what is meant by "the gifts which they sanctified," that is, offered. The gifts were called "holy," and presenting or offering them was called "sanctifying" them, because they represented holy things; for they were offered for expiations, thus for removals from sins, which are effected through faith and love to the Lord from the Lord.  [2] They were called "gifts and offerings made to Jehovah," although Jehovah, that is, the Lord, does not accept any gifts or offerings, but gives to everyone freely. Nevertheless He wills that these things should come from man as from himself, provided he acknowledges that they are not from himself, but from the Lord. For the Lord imparts the affection of doing good from love, and the affection of speaking truth from faith; but the affection itself flows in from the Lord, and it appears as if it were in the man, thus from the man; for whatever a man does from the affection which is of love, he does from his life, because love is the life of everyone. From this it is evident that what are called "gifts and offerings made to the Lord" by man are in their essence gifts and offerings made to man by the Lord; and their being called "gifts and offerings" is from the appearance. All who are wise in heart see this appearance; but not so the simple; and yet the gifts and offerings of the latter are grateful, insofar as they are offered from ignorance in which is innocence. Innocence is the good of love to God, and dwells in ignorance, especially with the wise in heart; for they who are wise in heart know and perceive that there is nothing of wisdom in themselves from themselves; but that everything of wisdom is from the Lord, that is, everything of the good of love, and everything of the truth of faith; thus that even with the wise innocence dwells in ignorance. From this it is evident that the acknowledgment of this fact, and especially the perception of it, is the innocence of wisdom.  [3] The gifts that were offered in the Jewish Church, and which were chiefly burnt-offerings, sacrifices, and meat-offerings, were also called "expiations from sins," because they were offered for the sake of the forgivenesses of them, that is, removals from them. Those who belonged to that church also believed that their sins were accordingly forgiven; nay, that they were entirely taken away; for it is said that after they had offered these things they would be "forgiven" (see Lev. 4:26, 31, 35; 5:6, 10, 13, 16, 18; 9:7, 15, 30). But they did not know that these offerings represented interior things, thus such things as are done by man from the love and faith that are from the Lord; and that these are the things which expiate, that is, remove sins, and that after they have been removed they appear as if they were quite removed or taken away, as has been shown above in this and in the preceding articles. For that nation was in representative worship, thus in external worship without internal, by means of which there was at that time a conjunction of heaven with man. (See the places cited in n. 9320e, 9380.) </p>

 <p>And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead continually. That this signifies a representative of the Lord's love to eternity, is evident from the signification of "the forehead," as being love (see n. 9936); from the representation of Aaron, as being the Lord (n. 9806); and from the signification of "continually," as being to eternity. That "continually" denotes to eternity, is because all things that belong to time, when said of the Lord, signify eternal things; therefore also "continually." For "continually," "daily," and "always," are predicated of time. From this also it is that "yesterday," and "today," when said of the Lord, likewise signify that which is eternal (n. 2838). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9940.">9940.</a></font></span>
 <p>To make them well-pleasing before Jehovah. That this signifies what is Divine of the Lord in them, is evident from the signification of "well-pleasing," when said of Jehovah, that is, the Lord, as being from His Divine, for that which is well- pleasing to the Lord is that which is from Him with man, spirit, or angel; for it is then in another, in whom it is looked at, and thus is well-pleasing. The things which are from the Lord are either nearer to, or more remote from Him; and they are said to be "from His will," "from good pleasure," "from leave," and "from permission." The things which are from will are most nearly from Him; those which are from good pleasure are somewhat more remotely from Him; those which are from leave still more remotely; and those which are from permission are most remotely from Him. These are the degrees of the influx and reception of the Divine. But each degree contains innumerable things which are distinct from those which are in any other degree; and these innumerable things are arcana of heaven, a few only of which fall into the human understanding. For instance, to take only those things which take place from permission, which, although they are in the last place, nevertheless on account of the numberless arcana therein cause a man to fall into confusion when he looks at them from the happenings of things in nature, and from appearances, and still more when from the fallacies of the senses. Yet the arcana of permission are comparatively few as compared with those of the higher degrees, which are the things that take place from leave, from good pleasure, and from will. </p>

 <p>Verses 39, 40. And thou shalt checker the tunic of fine linen, and thou shalt make a miter of fine linen, and a belt thou shalt make with the work of the embroiderer. And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make tunics, and thou shalt make for them belts; and tiaras shalt thou make for them, for glory and for comeliness. "And thou shalt checker the tunic of fine linen," signifies the inmost things of the spiritual kingdom that proceed from the truths of celestial love; "and thou shalt make a miter of fine linen," signifies the wisdom there; "and a belt," signifies a bond, and separation from the external things of this kingdom; "thou shalt make with the work of the embroiderer," signifies by means of the knowledges of good and truth; "and for Aaron's sons," signifies the Divine truths that proceed from the Lord's Divine good in the heavens; "thou shalt make tunics," signifies the things which are of faith there; "and thou shalt make for them belts," signifies a holding together in connection; "and tiaras shalt thou make for them," signifies the intelligence there; "for glory and for comeliness," signifies the truth of the spiritual church. </p>

 <p>And thou shalt checker the tunic of fine linen. That this signifies the inmost things of the spiritual kingdom that proceed from the truths of celestial love, is evident from the signification of Aaron's garments in general, as being the spiritual kingdom joined to the celestial kingdom (see n. 9814), and as the tunic was the inmost of these garments, therefore by it are signified the inmost things of this kingdom (that "Aaron's tunic" denotes the Divine truth in the spiritual kingdom that proceeds immediately from the Divine celestial, see n. 9826); and from the signification of "fine linen," as being truth from a celestial origin (see n. 9469). Of this tunic it is said that it was to be checkered, and by what is checkered is meant the work of a weaver, and by "the work of a weaver" is signified that which is from the celestial (n. 9915); the word by which "checkering" is expressed in the original tongue, means also "weaving." [2] That this tunic was woven, or from the work of the weaver, is evident from what follows in the book of Exodus:      They made tunics of fine linen, the work of the weaver, for Aaron and his sons (Exod. 39:27). That it was checkered, that is, woven, of fine linen, was for the reason that there might be represented that which proceeds immediately from the celestial, which is relatively as it were continuous; for the things which proceed from the celestial are like those which with man proceed from his will; for all things with man that belong to the understanding proceed from his will. Those things which proceed interiorly from the will are as it were continuous relatively to those which proceed exteriorly; and therefore among those things which proceed interiorly from the will there is especially the affection of truth; for all the affection of love in the understanding flows in from the man's will. The case is similar in the heavens, where the celestial kingdom corresponds to the will of man, and the spiritual kingdom to his understanding (see n. 9835); and because the garments of Aaron represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom joined to His celestial kingdom (n. 9814), therefore the tunic represented that which is inmost there, thus that which proceeds most closely from the celestial kingdom, for the tunic was the inmost garment. From this it is evident why the tunic was woven or checkered, and why it was of fine linen; for by "that which is woven" is signified that which is from the will, or from the celestial (n. 9915), and by "fine linen" is signified the truth which is from celestial love (n. 9469). [3] The spiritual which is from the celestial is also signified in other parts of the Word by "tunics," as by "the tunics of skin" which Jehovah God is said to have made for the man and his wife after they had eaten of the tree of knowledge (Gen. 3:20, 21). That by these "tunics" is signified truth from a celestial origin, cannot be known unless these things are unfolded according to the internal sense; and therefore this shall be unfolded. By the man and his wife is there meant the celestial church, by the man himself as a husband is meant this church as to good, and by his wife this church as to truth. This truth and that good were the truth and good of the celestial church. But when this church had fallen, which took place by means of reasonings from memory-knowledges about truths Divine, and which is signified in the internal sense by the persuasion of the serpent, this first state after the fall of that celestial church is what is there described, and its truth is described by "the tunics of skin."  [4] Be it known that by the creation of heaven and earth in the first chapter of Genesis, in the internal sense, is meant and described the new creation, or regeneration, of the man of the church at that time, thus the setting up of a celestial church; and that by the paradise are meant and described the wisdom and intelligence of that church, and by eating of the tree of knowledge its fall in consequence of reasoning from memory-knowledges about Divine things. That such is the meaning may be seen from what has been shown on this subject in the explications at those chapters. For all the things contained in the first chapters of Genesis are made up historical things, in the internal sense of which, as before said, are Divine things concerning the new creation or regeneration of the man of the celestial church. This method of writing was customary in the most ancient times, not only among those who were of the church, but also among those who were outside the church, as among the Arabians, Syrians, and Greeks, as is evident from the books of those times, both sacred and profane. [5] In imitation of these books, because derived from them, the Song of Songs was written by Solomon; for this book is not a holy book, because it does not contain within it heavenly and Divine things in a series, as do the holy books. The book of Job also is a book of the Ancient Church. Mention is also made of holy books of the Ancient Church which are now lost, as in Moses (Num. 21:14, 15, 27, and following verses). The historical parts of these books were called "the Wars of Jehovah," and their prophetical parts were called "the Enunciations" (see n. 2686, 2897). That in the historical parts of the books called "the Wars of Jehovah," the style was of this nature, is clear from what has been taken from them and quoted by Moses. In this way their historical things approached a certain prophetic style, of such a nature that the things might be retained in the memory by little children and also by the simple. That the books named above were holy, is evident from what is quoted in verses 28, 29, and 30 of the same chapter, when compared with what is found in Jeremiah 48:45, 46, where there are similar expressions. That among people outside the church such a style was very much used at that time, and was almost the only style, is clear from the fables of those writers who were outside the church, in which they wrapped up moral things, or such as belong to the affections and life. [6] In the historical things that were not made up, but were true, such as are those in the books of Moses after the first chapters of Genesis, and likewise in the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings, "tunics" also signified spiritual truth, and the good of truth, that proceed from celestial truth and good. (Be it known that spiritual truth and good are such as are the truth and good of the angels in the middle or second heaven; but that celestial truth and good are such as are the truth and good of the angels in the third or inmost heaven, see the places cited in n. 9277.) It is recorded in the books of Moses that Israel the father gave to Joseph his son a tunic of various colors, and that on account of this his brethren were indignant, and afterward stripped it off and dipped it in blood and sent it so to their father (Gen. 37:3, 23, 31-33). These were true historicals, and as these in like manner contained within them, or in the internal sense, holy things of heaven and the church, thus Divine things, therefore by that "tunic of various colors" was signified the state of good and truth which Joseph represented, which was a state of spiritual truth and good that proceed from the celestial (see n. 3971, 4286, 4592, 4963, 5249, 5307, 5584, 5869, 5877, 6417, 6526, 9671). For all the sons of Jacob represented in their order such things as belong to heaven and the church (n. 3858, 3926, 4060, 4603, 6335, 6337, 6397, 6640, 7836, 7891, 7996); but in this case they represented the opposite things. [7] As all things contained in the books of the Word, both the historical and prophetical, are representative and significative of Divine celestial and spiritual things, therefore the affection of this truth is described by the "king's daughter," and the truth itself by her "garments," in David:      The king's daughter is among Thy precious ones; at Thy right hand doth stand the queen in the best gold of Ophir. The daughter of Tyre shall bring an offering; the rich of the people shall entreat Thy faces. The king's daughter is all glorious within; thy <a name="fr_218"></a><a href="#fn_218"><font size="1">9942-1</font></a> clothing (thy tunic) is of weavings (or checkering) of gold. She shall be brought to the king in broidered work (Ps. 45:9, 12-14). (That a "daughter" in general signifies the affection of spiritual truth and good, thus also the church, see n. 2362, 3024, 3963, 9055e; and that a "king," when said of the Lord, signifies Divine truth, n. 2015, 2069, 3009, 4581, 4966, 5068, 6148.) From this it is evident that all those things which are related in this psalm about the king's daughter signify such things as belong to the affection of truth and good from the Lord in the church. Its being said that "the daughter of Tyre shall bring an offering," signifies the knowledges of good and truth (that "Tyre" signifies these, see n. 1201); in like manner "the rich of the people," for by "riches" in the spiritual sense nothing else is meant than the knowledges of good and truth (n. 1694, 4508). From this it is evident what is signified by "the king's daughter being glorious within," and that "her clothing was of the weavings of gold;" for by her "clothing" is meant a tunic, as is evident from the signification of this word in the original tongue, where it signifies the garment next the body. That it means a tunic is evident in John 19:23, 24, where the Lord's tunic is described, which in David (Ps. 22:18) is called, by the same word, "clothing." So in the second book of Samuel (13:18), it is said that the king's daughters were clad in tunics of divers colors (of which below). By "the weavings of gold" in David the like is meant as by "the checkerings of the tunic of Aaron," the same word being used in the original tongue. (What is meant by the "broidered work" in which she was to be brought to the king, see n. 9688.) [8] As such things were represented by the king's daughter and by her garment, or tunic, therefore a king's daughters were at that time clothed in this manner, as is evident in the second book of Samuel:      There was upon Tamar a tunic of divers colors; for with such wraps were the king's daughters clothed (2 Sam. 13:18). [9] Now as spiritual goods and truths were represented by tunics, it can be seen what is signified by "Aaron's tunic," also what by "the tunics of his sons," which are spoken of in the following verse of the present chapter, where it is said that "for Aaron's sons they should make tunics, belts, and tiaras, for glory and for comeliness." And as their tunics represented these holy things, it was said that Nadab and Abihu the sons of Aaron, who were burnt by fire from heaven, because they offered incense from strange fire, were brought forth outside the camp in their tunics (Lev. 10:1-5); for by "strange fire" is signified love from some other source than what is celestial, for in the Word "holy fire" denotes celestial or Divine love (n. 6832, 6834, 6849, 7324, 9434). Consequently the spiritual goods and truths signified by their "tunics" were defiled, and therefore they were brought forth outside the camp in their tunics. [10] The like is also signified by "tunic" in Micah:      My people holds as an enemy by reason of a garment; ye strip the tunic from off them that pass by securely (Micah 2:8); in this passage "tunic" is expressed in the original tongue by another word, which, however, signifies spiritual truth and good; "stripping the tunic from off them that pass by securely" denotes to deprive of their spiritual truths those who live in simple good; "to hold anyone as an enemy by reason of a garment" denotes to do evil to them on account of the truth which they think, when yet no one is to be injured on account of what he believes to be true, provided he is in good (n. 1798, 1799, 1834, 1844). [11] From all this it can now be seen what is signified by a "tunic" in Matthew:      Jesus said, Swear not at all; neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by Jerusalem, nor by the head. Let your discourse be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay. Whatsoever is beyond these is from evil. If any man would drag thee to the law, and take away thy tunic, let him have thy cloak also (Matt. 5:34-37, 40). he who does not know what is the state of the angels in the Lord's celestial kingdom, cannot possibly know what these words of the Lord involve; for the subject here treated of is the state of good and truth with those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom, with whom all truth is imprinted on the heart. For from the good of love to the Lord they know all truth, insomuch that they never reason about it, as is done in the spiritual kingdom; and therefore when truths are being spoken of, they only say, Yea, yea, or Nay, nay; and they do not even mention faith there. (Concerning their state see the places cited in n. 9277.) From this then it is evident what is signified by the injunction "swear not at all;" for by "swearing" is signified to confirm truths (n. 3375, 9166), which is done in the spiritual kingdom by means of the rational, and memory-knowledges from the Word. By "dragging to the law, and desiring to take away the tunic," is meant to debate about truths, and to wish to persuade that they are not true; a "tunic" denotes truth from what is celestial; for the celestial leave to everyone his truth without further reasoning. [12] By a "tunic" is signified the truth from what is celestial in another passage also in Matthew:      Jesus sent the twelve to preach the kingdom of the heavens, saying that they should not possess gold, nor silver, nor brass in their girdles; nor a scrip for the journey; neither two tunics, nor shoes, nor staves (Matt. 10:5, 7, 9, 10). By these words was represented that those who are in goods and truths from the Lord possess nothing of good and truth from themselves, but that they have all truth and good from the Lord. For by the twelve disciples were represented all who are in goods and truths from the Lord, and in the abstract sense all goods of love and truths of faith from the Lord (n. 3488, 3858, 6397). Goods and truths from self, and not from the Lord, are signified by "possessing gold, silver, and brass in the girdles," and by a "scrip;" but truths and goods from the Lord are signified by "a tunic, shoe, and staff;" by "the tunic," interior truth, or truth from the celestial; by "the shoe," exterior truth, or truth in the natural (n. 1748, 6844); and by "the staff," the power of truth (n. 4876, 4936, 6947, 7011, 7026). But by "two tunics," "two pairs of shoes," and "two staves," are signified truths and their powers from both the Lord and self. That they were allowed to have one tunic, one pair of shoes, and one staff, is evident in Mark 6:8, 9, and in Luke 9:2, 3. [13] When it is known from these examples what is signified by a "tunic," it is manifest what is signified by "the Lord's tunic," of which we read in John:      They took the garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part, and the tunic; and the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout. They said, Let us not divide it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the Scripture might be fulfilled which saith, They divided My garments among them, and upon My tunic did they cast a lot. These things the soldiers did (John 19:23, 24; also Ps. 22:18). Who cannot see, if he thinks from reason at all enlightened, that these proceedings signified Divine things, and that otherwise they would not have been foretold by David? But what they signify cannot be known without the internal sense, thus without knowledge therefrom as to what is signified by "garments;" by "casting lots" upon, or "dividing" them; by a "tunic;" and by its being "without seam," that is, woven throughout; and by "soldiers." From the internal sense it is plain that by "garments" are signified truths, and by "the Lord's garments," Divine truths; by "casting a lot," and "dividing" them is meant to pull these truths asunder and disperse them (n. 9093); by the "tunic" is signified Divine spiritual truth from the Divine celestial, the like as by "Aaron's tunic," because Aaron represented the Lord; so also by its being "without seam," and "woven from the top throughout," the like is signified as by the "checkered," or woven, "work," in Aaron's tunic. That the tunic was not divided signified that the Divine spiritual truth which proceeds most nearly from Divine celestial truth could not be dispersed, because this truth is the internal truth of the Word, such as is with the angels in heaven.  [14] Its being said that "the soldiers did this," signifies that it was done by those who should fight for truths, thus by the Jews themselves, with whom was the Word, and who nevertheless were of such a nature that they dispersed it. For they had the Word, and yet they were not willing to know from it that the Lord was the Messiah and the Son of God who was to come, nor anything internal of the Word, but only what is external; which they also wrested to their loves, which were the loves of self and of the world, thus to favor the lusts which spring from these loves. These things were signified by "the dividing of the Lord's garments;" for whatever they did to the Lord represented the state of Divine truth and Divine good among them at that time; thus that they treated Divine truths in the same way as they treated Him. (That the Lord while in the world was the Divine truth itself, see the places cited in n. 9199, 9315.) </p>

 <p>And thou shalt make a miter of fine linen. That this signifies the wisdom there, is evident from the signification of "a miter," as being intelligence, and when said of the Lord, who is here represented by Aaron, as being wisdom (see n. 9827); and from the signification of "fine linen," as being truth from a celestial origin (n. 9469); for the wisdom which is here signified by "the miter" comes from this truth. For all wisdom and intelligence are from the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good. There are no other wisdom and intelligence that really are such, because there are none from any other source. Intelligence is to know and understand truths Divine, and afterward to have faith in them; and wisdom is to will and love these truths, and from this to live according to them. </p>

 <p>And a belt. That this signifies a bond, and separation from the external things of this kingdom, is evident from the signification of "a belt," as being the external bond that holds together all things of love and faith in their connection and form, so that they look to one end (see n. 9341, 9828, 9837). That it also signifies separation from the external things, is because in this way it gathers up and holds together the internal things, and that which gathers up and holds together the internal things, also separates them from the external things. The internal things of the spiritual kingdom are signified by "the tunic," because this was the inmost clothing, and its external things are signified by "the robe," and "the ephod," because these were the outer garments. (That by the garments of Aaron was represented the spiritual kingdom, see n. 9814; by the ephod its external, n. 9824; by the robe its interior, n. 9825; and by the tunic the inmost, n. 9826.) </p>

 <p>Thou shalt make with the work of the embroiderer. That this signifies by means of the knowledges of good and truth, is evident from the signification of "the work of the embroiderer," as being that which is from memory-knowledges (see n. 9688). It is said "by means of the knowledges of good and truth," because by these knowledges are meant interior memory-knowledges such as are those of the church concerning faith and love. That these memory-knowledges are here signified by "the work of the embroiderer," is because by "the belt" of the tunic, which was of the work of the embroiderer, is signified the inmost bond of the spiritual kingdom (of which just above); and because all things in the spiritual world are held together in connection by means of knowledges, and the affections thence derived. </p>

 <p>And for Aaron's sons. That this signifies the Divine truths that proceed from the Lord's Divine good in the heavens, is evident from the representation of the sons of Aaron, as being the Divine truths that proceed from the Lord's Divine good (see n. 9807). That "in the heavens" is signified, is because what is Divine of the Lord in the heavens is that which is represented by the priesthood of Aaron and his sons; Divine good in the heavens by the priesthood of Aaron, and Divine truth from Divine good there by the priesthood of his sons. It is said "in the heavens," because the Lord Himself is above the heavens, for He is the Sun of heaven; and yet His presence is in the heavens, and is as if He Himself were there. He Himself in the heavens, that is, His Divine good and His Divine truth there, can be represented; but not His Divine which is above the heavens, for the reason that the latter cannot fall into human minds, and not even into angelic minds, because it is infinite; but the Divine in the heavens which is from it, is accommodated to reception. </p>

 <p>Thou shalt make tunics. That this signifies the things which are of faith there, is evident from the signification of a "tunic," when said of Aaron, as being Divine truth inmostly in the spiritual kingdom, thus that which proceeds immediately from the celestial (see n. 9826, 9942); but when it is said of Aaron's sons, the "tunic" denotes that which is of faith, for it denotes that which proceeds from the spiritual which is from the celestial. This proceeding is what is called "the faith of truth." </p>

 <p>And thou shalt make for them belts. That this signifies a holding together in connection, is evident from the signification of "belts," as being external bonds which hold together in connection the truths and goods of faith and love (see n. 9341, 9828, 9837, 9944). </p>

 <p>And tiaras shalt thou make for them. That this signifies the intelligence there, is evident from the signification of a "miter," and in general of a covering for the head, as being intelligence and wisdom (see n. 9827); consequently also a "tiara;" for the covering of the head for the sons of Aaron was called a "tiara." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="9950.">9950.</a></font></span>
 <p>For glory and for comeliness. That this signifies the truth of the spiritual church, is evident from the signification of "for glory and for comeliness," as being to present, in an internal and an external form, Divine truth such as it is in the spiritual kingdom joined to the celestial kingdom (see above, n. 9815); but here it denotes the truth of the spiritual church which is thence derived; for by Aaron is represented Divine good in the heavens, and by his sons the Divine truth thence derived. Moreover, the Divine good there is as a father, and the Divine Truth from it is as a son; and because this is so, by "father" in the Word is signified good, and by "sons" truths. And indeed truths are born from goods when the man is being born anew, that is, when he is being regenerated. </p>
