 <p>Lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. That this signifies to avoid the damnation of evil and falsity, is evident from the signification of "lest He fall upon us," as being lest they should incur damnation; from the signification of "pestilence," as being the damnation of evil (of which below); and from the signification of "the sword," as being the vastation of truth, and also the punishment of falsity (see n. 2799), thus also damnation, for the punishment of falsity when truth is devastated, is damnation. [2] Mention is made in the Word of four kinds of vastations and punishments; namely, the Sword, Famine, the Evil Beast, and Pestilence; and by the "sword" is signified the vastation of truth and the punishment of falsity; by "famine," the vastation of good and the punishment of evil; by the "evil beast," the punishment of the evil from falsity; by "pestilence," the punishment of the evil not from falsity but from evil. And as punishment is signified, damnation is also signified, for this is the punishment of those who persevere in evil. Of these four kinds of punishments it is thus written in Ezekiel:      When I send upon Jerusalem My four evil judgments, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast (Ezek. 14:21). Again:      I will send upon you famine, and the evil beast, and will make thee bereaved; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; especially will I bring the sword upon thee (Ezek. 5:17). [3] That by "pestilence" is signified the punishment of evil, and its damnation, is evident from the following passages. In Ezekiel:      They who are in the waste places shall die by the sword, and he who is upon the faces of the field I will give to the wild beast to devour him, and they who are in the strongholds and caverns shall die with the pestilence (Ezek. 33:27); "to die by the sword in waste places" denotes to be in the vastation of truth, and thence in the damnation of falsity; "he who is upon the faces of the field being given to the wild beast to devour" denotes the damnation of those who are in evil from falsity; "they who are in strongholds and caverns dying with the pestilence" denotes the damnation of evil which fortifies itself by falsity. [4] Again:      The sword is without, and the pestilence and famine within; he that is in the field shall die by the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him (Ezek. 7:15); the "sword" here denotes the vastation of truth and the damnation of falsity; "famine and pestilence," the vastation of good and the damnation of evil. The sword is said to be "without," and famine and pestilence "within," because the vastation of truth is without, but the vastation of good within; but when a man lives in accordance with falsity, damnation is signified by "him who is in the field dying by the sword;" and when he lives in evil which is defended by falsity, damnation is signified by "famine and pestilence devouring him who is in the city." [5] In Leviticus:      I will bring upon you a sword avenging the vengeance of the covenant; where, if ye shall be gathered together into your cities, I will send the pestilence into the midst of you, and I will deliver you into the hand of the enemy, when I shall break the staff of your bread (Lev. 26:25-26); where in like manner the "sword" denotes the vastation of truth and the damnation of falsity; the "pestilence" the damnation of evil; the vastation of good, which is signified by "famine," is described by "breaking the staff of their bread;" by "the cities into which they were to be gathered together," in like manner as above, are signified the falsities by which they defend evils (that "cities" are truths, thus in the opposite sense falsities, see n. 402, 2268, 2712, 2943, 3216, 4492, 4493). [6] In Ezekiel:      In that thou hast defiled My sanctuary with all thine abominations, a third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee; a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and a third part I will scatter to every wind, and will draw out a sword after them (Ezek. 5:11-12); where "famine" denotes the damnation of evil; "sword," the damnation of falsity; "to scatter to every wind, and to draw out the sword after them" denotes to dissipate truths and seize on falsities. [7] In Jeremiah:      If they shall offer burnt-offering or meat-offering, I will not approve them; but I will consume them with sword, and with famine, and with pestilence (Jer. 14:12). Again:      I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they shall die of a great pestilence; afterward I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and those who are left in this city from the pestilence, and from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth out and falleth away to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his soul shall be unto him for a spoil (Jer. 21:6-7, 9). Again:      I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, till they be consumed from upon the earth (Jer. 24:10); where also by the "sword" is signified the vastation of truth, by the "famine" the vastation of good, by the "pestilence" damnation. The like is signified by "the sword, the famine, and the pestilence" in the following passages, Jer. 27:8; 29:17, 18; 32:24, 36; 34:17; 38:2; 42:17, 22; 44:13; Ezek. 12:16. [8] As these three follow in their order, therefore these three were proposed to David by the prophet Gad, namely, whether there should come seven years of famine; or he should flee three months before his enemies; or whether there should be three days' pestilence in the land (2 Sam. 24:13); "to flee before his enemies" stands for "the sword." In Amos:      I have sent among you the pestilence in the way of Egypt; I have slain your young men with the sword, with the captivity of your horses (Amos 4:10); "the pestilence in the way of Egypt" denotes the vastation of good by means of falsities, which are "the way of Egypt;" "I have slain your young men with the sword, with the captivity of the horses," denotes the vastation of truth. (By "young men" are signified truths, and by "horses" things of the intellect, see n. 2761, 2762, 3217, 5321, 6534.) [9] In Ezekiel:      Pestilence and blood shall pass through thee (Ezek. 5:17). Again:      I will send unto her pestilence and blood in her streets (Ezek. 28:23); where "pestilence" denotes adulterated good; and "blood," falsified truth. (That "blood" denotes falsified truth, see n. 4735, 6978). [10] In David:      Thou shalt not be afraid for the dread of night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day; for the pestilence that creepeth in thick darkness, nor for the death that wasteth at noonday (Ps. 91:5-6). Here the "dread of night" denotes the falsity which is in secret; the "arrow that flieth by day," the falsity which is in the open; the "pestilence that creepeth in thick darkness," the evil which is in secret; the "death that wasteth at noonday," the evil which is in the open. That "pestilence" denotes evil and the damnation of evil, is plain from death's being spoken of also, which is here distinguished from the pestilence merely by its being said of death that "it wasteth at noonday," and of the pestilence that "it creepeth in thick darkness." Again:      He directed the way of His anger; He forbade not their soul from death, and closed their life with the pestilence (Ps. 78:50); speaking of the Egyptians; the "pestilence" denotes every kind of evil and its damnation. </p>

 <p>And the king of Egypt said unto them. That this signifies the answer from those who are in falsities, is evident from the signification of "saying," when by Pharaoh to Moses and Aaron, as being contrary thought (as above, n. 7094); thus the thought which is for the answer; and from the representation of Pharaoh, or the king of Egypt, as being false memory-knowledge (n. 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692), thus those who are in falsities.  </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7104.">7104.</a></font></span>
 <p>Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, draw away the people from their works? That this signifies that their Divine law and doctrine will not release them from sufferings, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being the Lord as to the Divine law (see n. 6723, 6752); from the representation of Aaron, as being the Lord as to the doctrine thence derived (n. 6998, 7009); from the signification of "drawing away," as being to release; and from the signification of "works," as being sufferings; for the works were labors, and also burdens (as follows), thus sufferings from combats, which are signified by "works" and "burdens" in the internal sense. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7105.">7105.</a></font></span>
 <p>Go ye unto your burdens. That this signifies that they must live in combats, is evident from the signification of "going," as being to live (see n. 3335, 4882, 5493, 5605); and from the signification of "burdens," as being infestations by falsities (n. 6757), thus combats against them. </p>

 <p>Verses 5-9. And Pharaoh said, Behold the people of the land are now many, and ye have made them cease from their burdens. And Pharaoh commanded in that day the taskmasters in the people, and their officers, saying, Ye shall no more give the people straw to make bricks, as yesterday and the day before yesterday; let them go and gather straw for themselves. And the tale of the bricks which they made yesterday and the day before yesterday, ye shall lay upon, them; ye shall not take away from it; for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. Let the service be made heavier upon the men, and let them do it; and let them not regard the words of a lie. "And Pharaoh said," signifies the will of those who infest the truths of the church; "Behold the people of the land are now many," signifies the multitude of those who are of the spiritual church; "and ye have made them cease from their burdens," signifies that they have not infested enough; "and Pharaoh commanded in that day," signifies the cupidity of infesting the truths of the church while in that state; "the taskmasters in the people, and their officers, saying," signifies those who most closely infest and most closely receive; "Ye shall no more give the people straw," signifies the lowest memory-knowledges which are the most general of all; "to make bricks," signifies for the things fictitious and false that will be injected; "as yesterday and the day before yesterday," signifies not as in the former state "let them go and gather straw for themselves," signifies that they should procure for themselves these lowest memory-knowledges; "and the tale of bricks, which they made yesterday and the day before yesterday, ye shall lay upon them," signifies that the things fictitious and false must be injected in abundance as before; "ye shall not take away from it," signifies without diminution; "for they are idle," signifies that they are not assaulted enough; "therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God," signifies that consequently they have so much thought about such worship; "let the service be made heavier upon the men," signifies that the assault should be increased; "and let them do it," signifies to obtain the effect; "and let them not regard the words of a lie," signifies lest they turn to truths. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7107.">7107.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Pharaoh said. That this signifies the will of those who infest the truths of the church, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being will (of which in what follows); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who infest the truths of the church (see n. 6651, 6679, 6683), thus who infest those who are of the spiritual church, for these are said to be in the truths of the church. That "saying" signifies to will, or the will, is because it involves the things which follow it; for when anyone wills anything, he utters it. As "he saith" involves the things which follow, it consequently signifies various things, as command (n. 7036); exhortation (n. 5012, 7033, 7090); communication (n. 3060, 4131, 6228); thought (n. 7094); properly, perception (n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2862, 3509, 5687). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7108.">7108.</a></font></span>
 <p>Behold the people of the land are now many. That this signifies the multitude of those who are of the spiritual church, is evident from the signification of "the people of the land," as being those who are of the spiritual church (see n. 2928) for by "people" are signified those who are in the truths of faith (n. 1259, 1260, 3581), and by "land" is signified the church (n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355, 4447, 4535, 4577). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7109.">7109.</a></font></span>
 <p>And ye have made them cease from their burdens. That this signifies that they have not infested enough, is evident from the signification of "burdens," as being infestations by falsities and the consequent combats (see n. 6757, 7104, 7105); hence "to make them cease from their burdens" denotes that they have not infested enough. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7110.">7110.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Pharaoh commanded in that day. That this signifies the cupidity of infesting the truths of the church while in that state, is evident from the signification of "commanding," as being a mandate, and as in a mandate of the evil there is the cupidity of doing evil (for this is the source of the mandate that comes from them), therefore here by "he commanded" is also signified cupidity from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who infest the truths of the church (see n. 6651, 6679, 6683); and from the signification of "day," as being state (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7111.">7111.</a></font></span>
 <p>The taskmasters in the people, and their officers, saying. That this signifies those who most closely infest, and those who most closely receive, is evident from the signification of "taskmasters," as being those who compel to serve (see n. 6852), and as this is effected by means of infestations, by "taskmasters" are also signified those who infest, but who most closely infest (of whom below); and from the signification of "officers," as being those who most closely receive; for the officers were of the sons of Israel, and the taskmasters were of the Egyptians, as is evident from what follows. Thus in the internal sense the "officers" are they who most closely receive, and the "taskmasters" those who most closely infest.  [2] Who these are can be known from those in the other life who infest and inject falsities and evils, and from those who receive and communicate them. They who infest and inject falsities and evils are the hells, but in order that they may effect their purpose, they send forth from themselves emissaries, through whom they act. These appear not far from those who are being infested; and this is done in order that the thoughts and intentions of many may be concentrated, for otherwise they would be dispersed. These emissaries appear in certain fixed places of their own in the world of spirits, and from the very places where they appear it can be known from what hell they are; some appear above the head at various altitudes and in various directions; some near the head to the right or to the left, and also behind it; some below the head in various situations relatively to the body, in planes from the head down to the soles of the feet. They flow in with such things as are ejected from hell, and the spirit or the man does not perceive or know otherwise than that the things which flow in are in himself; that is, that he himself thinks and intends them. These emissaries are called "subjects" (of whom see what was shown above, from experience, n. 4403, 5856, 5983-5989). As these infest the most closely, they are signified by the "taskmasters;" but they who receive from them and communicate are the "officers," and are intermediate spirits; for as before said the officers were of the sons of Israel, but the taskmasters were of the Egyptians. [3] Those were called "officers" among the Israelitish and Jewish people, who said what was to be done, and who gave commandment; wherefore they also sat in the gates with the judges and elders, and spoke to the people the sentences of judgment, and also the things commanded by the leader, as can be seen from the following passages in Moses:      Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, according to thy tribes, who shall judge the people with the judgment of justice (Deut. 16:18).      When they shall go forth to war, the priest shall speak to the people, and shall admonish them not to be afraid; afterward the officers shall say that he who has built a house shall return, and also the fearful (Deut. 20:3, 5, 8). In Joshua:      Joshua commanded the officers to say to the people that they should prepare provision for the journey, before they passed over Jordan (Josh. 1:10-11).      At the end of three days it came to pass, when the officers passed through the midst of the camp, they gave commandment that when they saw the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, they should also go forward (Josh. 3:2-3). That the officers were governors of the people, distinct from their princes, see Deut. 1:15; also that they were distinct from the elders, Deut. 31:28; and from the judges, Joshua 8:33. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7112.">7112.</a></font></span>
 <p>Ye shall no more give the people straw. That this signifies the lowest memory-knowledges and the most general of all, is evident from the signification of "chaff" or "straw," as being truths of memory-knowledge (see n. 3114), and indeed memory-knowledges the lowest and most general of all, for the lowest food in a spiritual sense is straw or chaff, because it is the food of beasts. Those knowledges are called lowest which are full of fallacies of the senses, which the evil abuse to pervert goods and truths, and thus to defend evils and falsities; for on account of fallacies these knowledges can be turned in favor of principles of falsity and of cupidities of evil. Moreover such knowledges are the most general of all, and unless they are filled with truths less general and more particular, they may be of service to falsities and evils, but in proportion as they are filled with truths, they are of less service to them. Such are the knowledges whereby they who in the world have professed faith alone, and yet have lived a life of evil, infest the upright in the other life; but as these knowledges are dispelled by the angels, it is now said that they should not give straw to make brick, that is, that they did not add these to the fictitious and false things that would be injected. Such is the internal sense of these words, which indeed appears remote from the sense of the letter; but be it known that there is nothing in the natural world which does not correspond to something in the spiritual world; and the angels with a man understand all things spiritually which the man understands naturally; they do not know what straw is, nor bricks; such things were known to them when they were in the world, but were forgotten when they came into heaven, because there they put on spiritual things. Hence it is that when the angels perceive the ideas of such things with a man, they turn them into corresponding spiritual things. That "straw" or "grass" denotes the lowest memory-knowledge, and that "bricks" denote things fictitious and false, can be seen from many considerations; for all herbage and straw have no other signification; but seeds, barley, wheat, and the like denote interior truths and goods; and stones not artificial denote truths. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7113.">7113.</a></font></span>
 <p>To make bricks. That this signifies to make things fictitious and false that will be injected, is evident from the signification of "making bricks," as being to invent falsities (see n. 1296, 6669). In the historic sense of the letter it is said that the sons of Israel made bricks, and thus as it were that they invented falsities; but in the internal sense it is signified that the infernals who are in falsities injected them And since - as before said - such things appear to pertain to those who receive them, the sense of the letter is according to the appearance, which, however, is explained by the internal sense. (That there are very many such things in the sense of the letter, see n. 5094, 6400, 6948.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7114.">7114.</a></font></span>
 <p>As yesterday and the day before yesterday. That this signifies not as in the former state, is evident from the signification of "yesterday and the day before yesterday," as being what is past (see n. 6983); and as all times signify states (n. 2625, 2788, 2837, 3254, 3356, 4814, 4882, 4901, 4916), therefore "yesterday and the day before yesterday" signifies the former state. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7115.">7115.</a></font></span>
 <p>Let them go and gather straw for themselves. That this signifies that they should procure for themselves these lowest memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "gathering" as being to procure; and from the signification of "straw," as being the lowest memory-knowledges (of which just above, n. 7112). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7116.">7116.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the tale of the bricks which they made yesterday and the day before yesterday, ye shall lay upon them. That this signifies that things fictitious and false must be injected in abundance as in the former state, is clear from the signification of "the tale," as being abundance, here the same abundance; from the signification of "bricks," as being things fictitious and false (of which just above, n. 7113); from the signification of "yesterday and the day before yesterday," as being the former state (of which also just above, n. 7114); and from the signification of "laying upon them," as being to inject, because it is said of things fictitious and false. From all this it is evident that by "laying upon them the tale of the bricks which they made yesterday and the day before yesterday" is signified that things fictitious and false were to be injected in the same abundance as in the former state. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7117.">7117.</a></font></span>
 <p>Ye shall not take away from it. That this signifies without diminution, is evident without explication. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7118.">7118.</a></font></span>
 <p>For they are idle. That this signifies that they are not assaulted enough, is evident from the signification of "being idle," as being not to be sufficiently infested by falsities, thus not to be assaulted enough. How the case herein is can also be known from those who are being infested by falsities in the other life. They who infest, as far as possible hinder the upright whom they infest from thinking about the Lord; as soon as any thought of the Lord openly occurs, they at once take it away, which they know how to do in a skillful manner. But as with those who are being infested, thought about the Lord is nevertheless universal, thus too interior to be in plain view (for it flows in through heaven), therefore as soon as they cease to be infested, they come into thought about the Lord, for that which flows in from heaven and reigns universally, reveals itself in every free state. From all this it is evident what is the internal sense of the words "for they are idle, therefore they cry, saying Let us go and sacrifice to our God." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7119.">7119.</a></font></span>
 <p>Therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice unto our God. That this signifies that consequently they have so much thought about such worship, is evident from the signification of "crying," as here being thought; for by "saying" and "speaking" is signified thought (see n. 2271, 2287, 7094), and therefore also by "crying," but by "crying" is signified strong thought and with full intention of doing, hence it is said "so much thought;" and from the signification of "sacrificing to their God," as being the worship of the Lord (n. 6905, 7101). But because Pharaoh said that he did not know Jehovah (n. 7095, 7097), and because the Egyptians were averse to sacrifices (n. 1343), and because Moses said that they would go a way of three days into the wilderness (n. 6904, 7100), therefore it is said, "such worship." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7120.">7120.</a></font></span>
 <p>Let the service be made heavier upon the men. That this signifies that the assault should be increased, is evident from the signification of "making heavier," as being to be increased; from the signification of "service," when said by those who infest by means of falsities, as being the intention to subjugate (n. 6666, 6670, 6671), thus assault, for they intend to subjugate by means of this assault; and from the signification of "the men," as being those who are of the spiritual church. There are two words in the original language which signify man; the one is "Adam," and the other "Enosh." By the man called "Adam" is meant the man of the celestial church; but by the man called "Enosh" is meant the man of the spiritual church. Here "the men" are expressed by "Enosh," because the subject treated of is those who are of the spiritual church. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7121.">7121.</a></font></span>
 <p>And let them do it. That this signifies to obtain the effect, is evident without explication. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7122.">7122.</a></font></span>
 <p>And let them not regard the words of a lie. That this signifies lest they turn to truths, is evident from the signification of "regarding," as being to turn one's self; and from the signification of "the words of a lie," when said by those who are in falsities, as being truths; for they who are in falsities call truths falsities, thus "the words of a lie;" and falsities they call truths, for they are in what is opposite.      In these verses, in the internal sense, there has now been described the infestation by falsities of the upright in the other life; and there has also been set forth the way in which they are infested. Such infestation is permitted to the end that falsities may be removed, and truths be instilled, which cannot possibly be done without infestation; for after death there clings to a man, and there is in his memories, everything of his thought in the world, of his intention, of his will, of his speech, and of his action, for nothing is obliterated. That these things have been impressed on his memories, especially on the interior memory, which is properly the memory of his spirit, see n. 2469, 2470, 2474, 2475. And this being so, it must needs be that there cling to him things foul and filthy, and also evil and false, from his life in the world; and which cause the truths which the man has also learned, and the goods which he has imbued, to be hidden. For truths and goods cannot come forth among such things; and therefore before truths and goods can appear, and the man be thus associated with those who are in heaven, it is necessary that these evils and falsities be uncovered, so that he may see them and know them, and thus learn what is true and what is good. This cannot possibly be done without combat with the evils and falsities in himself; which combat takes place actually, the evil spirits exciting falsities and evils, and the angels excusing if the end has been good, and instilling truths. This is perceived as if it were in himself, as is the case with temptation in man, which is felt no otherwise than as being in him, when yet it is the combat of angels with evil spirits outside of him (see n. 3927, 4249, 4307, 5036, 6657). That this is so has been granted me to know with certainty from much experience. These things have been said in order that it may be known why infestation by falsities takes place with those who are of the spiritual church, which infestation has been treated of in the above verses, and is treated of also in those which follow.  </p>

 <p>Verses 10-13. And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus said Pharaoh, I will by no means give you straw. Go ye yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it; for nothing whatever shall be taken away from your service. And the people scattered into all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. And the taskmasters were urgent, saying, Complete ye your works, the work of a day in its day, as when there was straw. "And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers," signifies the sending forth and presence of those who most closely infest, and of those who most closely receive; "and they spoke to the people, saying," signifies perception; "Thus said Pharaoh," signifies about the infestations; "I will by no means give you straw," signifies no longer thence the most general memory-knowledges; "Go ye yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it," signifies that they should procure these for themselves elsewhere, wherever they could; "for nothing whatever shall be taken away from your service," signifies injections of falsities without diminution; "and the people scattered into all the land of Egypt," signifies that they overspread the natural mind on every side; "to gather stubble for straw," signifies to find some truth of memory-knowledge; "and the taskmasters were urgent," signifies that they who most closely infested were insistent; "saying, Complete ye your works, the work of a day in its day," signifies that they should serve falsities so called in every state; "as when there was straw," signifies just as they served their truths so called. </p>

 <p>And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers. That this signifies the sending forth and presence of those who most closely infest, and of those who most closely receive, is evident from the signification of "going out," as being a sending forth, because they who are signified by "taskmasters" are sent forth in order to serve as a means of communication, as can be seen from what was said above (n. 7111); moreover, that "to go out" denotes to present oneself before another in a form accommodated to him, see n. 5337; therefore it also denotes presence; from the signification of "taskmasters," as being those who most closely infest; and from the signification of "officers," as being those who most closely receive and communicate the infestations (n. 7111). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7125.">7125.</a></font></span>
 <p>And they spoke to the people, saying. That this signifies perception, is evident from the signification of "saying," in the historicals of the Word, as being perception (see n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2862, 3509, 5687). </p>

 <p>Thus said Pharaoh. That this signifies about the infestations, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who infest such as are of the spiritual church (see what has been said above), thus it denotes infestation. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7127.">7127.</a></font></span>
 <p>I will by no means give you straw. That this signifies no longer thence the most general memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "by no means giving," as being no longer to furnish; and from the signification of "straw," as being the most general memory-knowledges of all (see n. 7112). How the case herein is has already been told. But it must be told further, that in the other life those who have been of the church, and have persuaded themselves that faith alone saves, yet have not lived the life of faith, but a life of evil, especially put straw (that is, the most general memory-knowledges of all) before the upright whom they are infesting. These men are of the same character there as they had been in the world; they are acquainted with confirming arguments in favor of faith alone, by which they say that man is saved no matter how he had lived; but these confirming arguments are nothing but reasonings that agree with the given proposition; for everything, even what is most false, can be confirmed by reasonings, and can also be presented to the simple as true, by means of the arts of eloquence and of inference. [2] For this purpose they especially employ such things from the Word as are the most general of all, and which without the internal sense of the word can be drawn to favor any opinion whatever. Such are the things which they put before those who are of the spiritual church; and by means of which they infest them; although they are nothing but chaff or straw for making bricks, for they exclude the most essential thing of all, namely, charity.  They indeed say that works of charity are the fruits of faith, but still they make these works of no account, and persuade their hearers that man is saved by faith alone no matter what his life has been, even in life's last moments; thus by faith without its fruits, consequently without the life of faith and charity. [3] So long as such things are put before the upright in the other life, these wield fighting arguments, and are able to defend themselves, for they see that reasonings are fallacious when the essential, which is charity, is thus excluded, and also when they see that no regard is paid to the life. From everything in the other life, both in general and in particular, they see these things as in clear day. Such then is what is meant by the memory-knowledges the lowest and most general of all, which are signified by "straw." They who have persuaded themselves that faith alone saves, and yet have lived a life of evil, are in hell at a considerable depth toward the right, a little in front; and I have heard them from thence infesting the upright with reasonings; but these, being led of the Lord by the angels, rejected the reasonings as being empty, and they also exposed the fallacies which were in the confirmations and arguments from the general things of the Word. </p>

 <p>Go ye yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it. That this signifies that they should procure these for themselves elsewhere, wherever they could, is evident from the signification of "getting wherever they could find," as being to procure for themselves elsewhere, wherever they could; and from the signification of "straw," as being memory-knowledges, the lowest and most general of all (n. 7112, 7127). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7129.">7129.</a></font></span>
 <p>For nothing whatever shall be taken away from your service. That this signifies injections of falsities without diminution, is evident from the signification of "nothing whatever being taken away," as being without diminution; and from the signification of "service," as being an assault by falsities (see above, n. 7120), thus also infestation. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7130.">7130.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the people scattered into all the land of Egypt. That this signifies that they overspread the natural mind on every side, is evident from the signification of "scattering themselves," as being to overspread; and from the signification of the "land of Egypt," as being the natural mind (n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301). There are two minds in man; one is the natural, and the other the rational mind; the natural mind is the mind of the external man, but the rational mind is the mind of the internal man. The things of the natural mind are called memory-knowledges, but those of the rational mind are called intellectual reasons; they are also distinguished from each other by the fact that the things of the natural mind are for the most part in the light of the world, which is called the light of nature; whereas the things of the rational mind are in the light of heaven, which light is spiritual light. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7131.">7131.</a></font></span>
 <p>To gather stubble for straw. That this signifies to find some truth of memory-knowledge, <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">7131-1</font></a> is evident from the signification of "stubble for straw," as being the truth of memory-knowledge, for "stubble" denotes such truth as is accommodated to the memory-knowledge that is signified by "straw." That "stubble" denotes such truth is because it is the stalk in the top of which is the seed, and by "seeds" in the word are signified truths and goods; thus by the stalk which is beneath them is signified the general vessel of truth, consequently the truth of memory-knowledge; for the memory-knowledges of faith and charity are indeed truths, but general truths, thus are the recipient vessels of particular and singular truths, as can also be seen by everyone. For example: it is a truth of memory-knowledge that charity toward the neighbor is the essential of the church; also that faith cannot be except where charity is; and likewise that truth and good can be conjoined, but not truth and evil, nor good and falsity; besides many similar truths, which are truths of memory-knowledge. That these can be enriched with innumerable things, can be seen from the fact that volumes can be written about them, and yet the singular truths, which are the interior things of faith, can never be described, for these can only be seen in the light of heaven, and do not fall into natural words. These truths are like charity, which is spiritual affection, and which for the most part cannot be expressed by words, except its most general things, namely, those which put on a natural dress, and which can be compared with such things as are in the world. These things have been said in order that it may be known what general memory-knowledges are. </p>

 <p>And the taskmasters were urgent. That this signifies that they who most closely infest were insistent, is evident from the signification of "taskmasters," as being those who most closely infest (see n. 7111); and from the signification of "urging," as being to insist. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7133.">7133.</a></font></span>
 <p>Saying, Complete ye your works, the work of a day in its day. That this signifies that they should serve falsities so called in every state, is evident from the signification of "completing your works," as being to serve falsities; for by "making bricks" are signified things fictitious and false that are injected (see n. 7113), and as these are the works which they were to complete, it signifies that they should serve these; it is said "falsities so called," because the evil do not acknowledge the falsities which they speak as being falsities, but as being truths; and from the signification of "the work of a day in its day," as being in every state (that a "day" denotes state, see n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7134.">7134.</a></font></span>
 <p>As when there was straw. That this signifies just as they served their truths so called, is evident from the signification of "straw;" as being general memory-knowledge, which is the vessel of truth (see n. 7112, 7131). It is said "truths so called," because these words are spoken by the evil, who do not acknowledge truths to be truths. </p>

 <p>Verses 14-18. And the officers of the sons of Israel were beaten, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, saying, Wherefore do ye not complete your task in making brick, as yesterday and the day before yesterday, also yesterday, also today? And the officers of the sons of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore doest thou so to thy servants? There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make ye bricks; and behold thy servants are beaten; and thy people have sinned. And he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore ye say, Let us go, let us sacrifice to Jehovah. And now go, serve ye, and straw shall not be given you, and the tale of bricks shall ye give. "And the officers of the sons of Israel were beaten," signifies that they who most closely received and communicated the infestations were injured by the injected falsities; "whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them," signifies those who were injected by the infesters; "saying, Wherefore do ye not complete your task in making bricks?" signifies that they do not receive and communicate the injections of falsities as had been enjoined; "as yesterday and the day before yesterday," signifies as in the former state; "also yesterday also today," signifies the state that will be therefrom; "and the officers of the sons of Israel came," signifies those who most closely received and communicated; "and cried unto Pharaoh," signifies indignation testified before those who were infesting; "saying, wherefore doest thou thus to thy servants?" signifies that thus they could not perform the duty enjoined; "there is no straw given to thy servants," signifies that memory-knowledges containing truth are no longer furnished; "and they say to us, Make ye bricks," signifies that they must nevertheless endure the injected falsities; "and behold thy servants are beaten," signifies that in this way the falsities inflict injury; "and thy people have sinned," signifies that thus they are guilty in having done evil; "and he said," signifies the answer; "Ye are idle, ye are idle," signifies that they have not been sufficiently assaulted; "therefore ye say, Let us go, let us sacrifice to Jehovah," signifies that from this comes the thought about such worship; "and now go, serve ye," signifies continuation of the infestation; "and straw shall not be given you," signifies without such memory-knowledges; "and the tale of bricks ye shall give," signifies the falsities which were to be injected in abundance. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7136.">7136.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the officers of the sons of Israel were beaten. That this signifies that they who most closely received and communicated the infestations were injured by the injected falsities, is evident from the signification of "being beaten," as being to be injured by falsities, because by the taskmasters, by whom are signified the infesters, for in the spiritual sense "to be beaten" is not to be beaten, but to be injured in respect to truth and good, that is, in respect to the things of spiritual life; just as "to die" in the spiritual sense is not to die, but to be deprived of truth and good, and to be in falsity and evil, and therefore damned; from the signification of "the officers," as being those who most closely receive and communicate the infestations (see n. 7111); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (n. 6426, 6637), with whom they who are signified by the "officers" were in communication. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7137.">7137.</a></font></span>
 <p>Whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them. That this signifies those who were injected by the infesters, is evident from the signification of "being set over them," as being to be injected, because done by injection (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "taskmasters," as being those who infest (see n. 7111). How this is cannot be known except from experience with such in the other life. It was said above that by "taskmasters" are signified those who most closely infest, and by "officers" those who most closely receive and communicate (n. 7111); they who thus receive and communicate are simple, upright spirits, who are of especial service for such a use; these spirits, by means of arts known only in the other life, are injected by the infesters toward the society with which they thus procure for themselves communication; and this is effected by those who infest and are signified by the "taskmasters;" thus the hells have communication on their side, and they who are being infested on theirs. That this is the case, I have seen a hundred times, if not a thousand, and have also experienced. From all this it is evident that what is signified by these words in the internal sense cannot be known except from experience concerning such things in the other life. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7138.">7138.</a></font></span>
 <p>Saying, Wherefore do ye not complete your task in making bricks? That this signifies that they do not receive and communicate the injections of falsities as had been enjoined, is evident from the signification of the "officers" to whom these things are said, as being those who most closely receive and communicate (see n. 7111); from the signification of "completing the task," as being to do as had been enjoined; and from the signification of "making bricks," as being to receive things fictitious and false (n. 7113). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7139.">7139.</a></font></span>
 <p>As yesterday and the day before yesterday. That this signifies as in the former state, is evident from the signification of "yesterday and the day before" as being a former state (see n. 6983, 7114). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7140.">7140.</a></font></span>
 <p>Also yesterday, also today. That this signifies the state that will be therefrom, is evident from the signification of "yesterday," as being the former state (as just above); and from the signification of "today," as being what is perpetual (see n. 2838, 3998, 4304, 6165), consequently what is everlasting, and thus that will be as before. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7141.">7141.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the officers of the sons of Israel came. That this signifies those who most closely received and communicated, is evident from the signification of "the officers of the sons of Israel," as being those who most closely receive and communicate the infestations (of which just above, n. 7136). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7142.">7142.</a></font></span>
 <p>And cried unto Pharaoh. That this signifies indignation testified before those who were infesting, is evident from the signification of "crying," as here being to attest indignation, namely, because they had been beaten, that is, injured by the injected falsities; and because straw was not given to make brick, that is, that they were receiving and injecting only things fictitious and false; and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who infest (see n. 6651, 6679, 6683, 7126). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7143.">7143.</a></font></span>
 <p>Saying, Wherefore doest thou this to thy servants? That this signifies that thus they could not perform the duty enjoined, is evident from the signification of a "servant," as being one who ministers, and performs a duty; he is called a "servant" because he is of service, as occasionally occurs in the Word. That he is called a "servant" who obeys, see n. 1713; and that to "serve" denotes study, n. 3824, 3846; and as what now follows involves that they could not endure that service, it is plain that by "wherefore doest thou thus to thy servants?" is signified that thus they could not perform the duty enjoined. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7144.">7144.</a></font></span>
 <p>There is no straw given to thy servants. That this signifies that memory-knowledges containing truth are no longer furnished, is evident from the signification of " straw," as being memory-knowledges the most general of all (see n. 7112), which, being like vessels that can be filled with truths (n. 4345, 4383, 5208, 7131), are called memory-knowledges, the containers of truth; from the signification of "not being given," as being not to be furnished; and from the signification of "servants," as being those who minister and perform a duty (of which just above, n. 7143). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7145.">7145.</a></font></span>
 <p>And they say to us, Make ye bricks. That this signifies that they must nevertheless endure the injected falsities, is evident from the signification of "making bricks," as being to receive things fictitious and false which are injected by the evil (n. 7113), here to endure them. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7146.">7146.</a></font></span>
 <p>And behold thy servants are beaten. That this signifies that in this way the falsities inflict injury, is evident from the signification of "being beaten," as being to be injured by falsities (see n. 7136). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7147.">7147.</a></font></span>
 <p>And thy people have sinned. That this signifies that thus they are guilty in that they have done evil, is evident from the signification of "sinning," as being to become guilty of evil, and in this case that they would deserve to be punished. How the case is in general with what is contained in this and the preceding verse must be told. They who are in the lower earth are infested by falsities and evils injected from the hells round about, in order that evils and falsities may be removed, and truths and goods be instilled, and that in this way they may be brought into a state in which they can be raised up into heaven (see n. 7090, 7122). But near the end they are more severely infested than before; for then truths are taken from them, and mere falsities are permitted to infest them, and this even to despair; for it is of Divine order that the last of infestation and of temptation should be despair (see n. 1787, 2694, 5279, 5280). This was done by Pharaoh in order that this state of those who are of the spiritual church might be represented by the sons of Israel, and this when the infestations were near to the end, that is, when the people were to be liberated and conducted into the land of Canaan. Be it known that infestations are effected in this manner, namely, that falsities and evils from the hells are injected into the thoughts, and also truths and goods from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord; this is done because a man and a spirit do not think from themselves, but all things flow in, which although it is quite foreign to our feeling, and therefore seems to be incredible, is nevertheless most true (on this matter see what has already been adduced and shown from experience, n. 2886, 4151, 4249, 5846, 5854, 6189-6215, 6307-6327, 6466-6495, 6598-6626). From all this it can be known how it is to be understood that infestations are effected by means of the injection of falsities, and that this is increased even to despair. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7148.">7148.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he said. That this signifies the answer, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being answer (n. 7103). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7149.">7149.</a></font></span>
 <p>Ye are idle, ye are idle. That this signifies that they have not been sufficiently assaulted, is evident from the signification of "being idle," as being not to be sufficiently assaulted, namely, by falsities (see n. 7118). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="7150.">7150.</a></font></span>
 <p>Therefore ye say, Let us go, let us sacrifice to Jehovah. That this signifies that from this comes the thought about such worship, is evident from what was said above (n. 7119), where are the like words. </p>
