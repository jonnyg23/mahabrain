 <p>For hiring I have hired thee with my son's dudaim. That this signifies that it was thus promised from forethought is evident from the signification of "hiring to hire" as being that which is promised; as is also evident from what goes before. That it is from foresight, is because all the conjunction of truth with good, and of good with truth, in man, is effected from foresight; that is, from the Lord's Providence. For the subject here treated of is the conjunction of good with truth, and of truth with good, and thus the good that is appropriated to man. For good is not good in man until it has been conjoined with truth. And as all good comes from the Lord, that is, all the appropriation of good through its conjunction with truth, it is therefore here said, "from foresight." The Lord's Providence is especially concerned with this conjunction. By means of it man becomes man, and is distinguished from the brute animals; and he becomes man insofar as he receives of it; that is, insofar as he permits the Lord to effect it. This therefore is the good that is with man; and no other good that is spiritual and that remains to eternity, is possible.  [2] Moreover the goods of the external man, which so long as the man lives in the world are the delights of life, are good only insofar as they partake inwardly of this good. For example, the good of riches. Insofar as riches have spiritual good within them, that is, insofar as they have as their end the good of the neighbor, the good of our country or the public good, and the good of the church, so far they are good. But they who conclude that the spiritual good of which we are speaking is not possible in a condition of worldly opulence, and who therefore persuade themselves that to make room for heaven they must divest themselves of such things, are much mistaken.  For if they renounce their wealth, or deprive themselves of it, they can then do good to no one, nor can themselves live in the world except in misery and thus can no longer have as their end the good of the neighbor, and the good of their country, nor even the good of the church, but themselves only, that they may be saved, and become greater than others in the heavens. Moreover, when they divest themselves of worldly goods, they expose themselves to contempt, because they make themselves of low estimation in the sight of others, and consequently useless for performing services and discharging duties. But when they have the good of others as their end, they then have also as an end, or as means, a state of being in the capability of effecting this end. [3] The case herein is precisely as it is with the nutrition of a man, which has as its end that he may have a sound mind in a sound body. If a man deprives his body of its nourishment, he deprives himself also of the condition needed for his end; and therefore he who is a spiritual man does not despise nourishment, nor even its pleasures; and yet he does not hold them as his end, but only as a means that is of service to his end. From this as an example we can judge of all other things. </p>

 <p>And he lay with her that night. That this signifies conjunction, is evident without explication. The reason why the foregoing matters have been unfolded in the internal sense merely as to the significations of the words, is that they are of such a nature that they cannot be comprehended unless they are set forth in one series. For the subject treated of is the conjunction of truth with good and of good with truth, which conjunction is the conjugial as understood in the spiritual sense; that is, the conjunction which makes the heavenly marriage with man and in the church. The arcana of this heavenly marriage are described in the above verses, and are there revealed as follows. As before shown the heavenly marriage is that of good with truth and of truth with good, yet is not between good and truth of one and the same degree, but between good and truth of a lower and of a higher degree, that is, not between the good of the external man and the truth of the same, but between the good of the external man and the truth of the internal; or what is the same, not between the good of the natural man and its truth, but between the good of the natural man and the truth of the spiritual man. This conjunction is that which makes the marriage. [2] It is the same in the internal or spiritual man; the heavenly marriage there is not between the good and the truth in that man; but between the good of the spiritual man and the truth of the celestial man; for the celestial man is relatively in a higher degree. Nor is there a heavenly marriage between the good and the truth in the celestial man; but between the good of the celestial man and the truth Divine which proceeds from the Lord. From this it is also evident that the Divine marriage itself of the Lord is not between the good Divine and the truth Divine in His Divine Human, but between the good of the Divine Human and the Divine Itself, that is, between the Son and the Father; for the good of the Lord's Divine Human is that which is called in the Word the "Son of God," and the Divine Itself is called the "Father."  [3] These are the arcana contained in the internal sense in what is said concerning the dudaim. Everyone can see that there must be some arcanum therein, for to relate that Reuben found dudaim in the field, and that Rachel longed for them, and in return for them promised that their man should lie with Leah; and that Leah went to meet Jacob when he came from the field in the evening, and said that she had hired him with the dudaim-these things would be too trivial to make any part of the history in the Word, unless there was something Divine hidden within them. But what Divine thing is meant no one can know unless he knows what is signified by the sons of Jacob and by the tribes named from them; and unless he also knows the series of the subject in the internal sense; and moreover unless he knows what the heavenly marriage is, for this is what is treated of, namely, that it is the conjunction of the good in the external man with the affection of truth in the internal man.  [4] But in order to the better understanding of this arcanum, I may illustrate it further. The truths of the external man are the memory-knowledges and doctrinal things that the man first learned from his parents, and also from his teachers, then from books, and finally by his own study. The good of the external man is the pleasure and delight that he perceives in these things. The memory-knowledges, which are truths, and the delights, which are good, are conjoined together; but they do not make in him the heavenly marriage, for with those who are in the love of self and of the world, and thence in evil and falsity, the memory-knowledges, and even the doctrinal things, are conjoined with delights; but it is with the delights of these loves, for with these even truths can be conjoined. And yet such persons are out of the heavenly marriage. But when the pleasure or the delight that is the good of the external or natural man is from spiritual love, that is, from love toward the neighbor, toward our country or the state, toward the church and the Lord's kingdom, and still more when it is from celestial love, which is love to the Lord; and when these flow in from the internal or spiritual man into the delight of the external or natural man and make it; then this conjunction with the memory-knowledges and doctrinal things of the external or natural man constitutes with him the heavenly marriage. This is not possible with the evil, but only with the good, that is, with those who have these things as their end. (But see how the case is with the influx of the internal or spiritual man into the external or natural man, n. 3286, 3288, 3314, 3321.) [5] As soon as these things have become known, it is possible to know what is signified by each of the things that have been explained above in regard merely to the internal sense of the words-as that Reuben (who is the truth of faith, which is the first of regeneration) found dudaim; that he brought them to his mother Leah (who is the affection of external truth); that Rachel (who is the affection of interior truth) longed for them, and that they were given her; that Leah therefore lay with her man Jacob (who is the good of truth in the natural man) also, in what follows, that there were born to Jacob by Leah the sons Issachar and Zebulun, by whom are signified and represented the things of conjugial love, and thus of the heavenly marriage; and then that Joseph was born, by whom is signified and represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom, which is the marriage itself that is treated of. </p>

 <p>Verses 17, 18. And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived and bare Jacob a fifth son. And Leah said, God hath given me my reward, because I gave my handmaid to my man; and she called his name Issachar. "And God hearkened unto Leah," signifies the Divine love; "and she conceived and bare Jacob a fifth son," signifies reception and acknowledgment; "and Leah said, God hath given me my reward, because I gave my handmaid to my man," signifies in the supreme sense the Divine good of truth and truth of good; in the internal sense, celestial conjugial love; and in the external sense, mutual love; "and she called his name Issachar," signifies its quality. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3954.">3954.</a></font></span>
 <p>And God hearkened unto Leah. That this signifies the Divine love, is evident from the signification of "hearkening" to anyone, when predicated of God or the Lord, as being the Divine love; for hearkening to anyone is doing what he prays for and desires. As this is from Divine good, and Divine good comes from the Divine love, by "hearkening" to anyone is signified in the supreme sense the Divine love. For with the internal sense of the Word the case is that when the sense of the letter ascends toward heaven, and thus enters into the sphere where the thought is from the Lord and concerning the Lord and what belongs to the Lord, it is at last so perceived by the angels; for the internal sense is the Word to the angels, whereto the sense of the letter serves as a plane or means of thinking. For the sense of the letter cannot come to the angels, because it treats in most places of worldly, earthly, and corporeal things, of which the angels cannot think, because they are in spiritual and celestial things, and thus far above what is earthly. For this reason a Word has been given that can serve man and at the same time the angels. In this the Word differs from every other writing. </p>

 <p>And she conceived and bare Jacob a fifth son. That this signifies reception and acknowledgment, is evident from the signification of "conceiving," as being reception; and of "bearing," as being acknowledgment (concerning which, n. 3860, 3868, 3905, 3911, 3919). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3956.">3956.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Leah said, God hath given me my reward, because I gave my handmaid to my man. That this signifies in the supreme sense the Divine good of truth and truth of good; in the internal sense, celestial conjugial love; and in the external sense, mutual love, may be seen from the signification of "reward." "Reward" is frequently mentioned in the Word, but few know what it there signifies. It is known in the churches that by the goods which man does he can merit nothing, for they are not his, but the Lord's; and that meriting or merit looks to man, and thus conjoins itself with the love of self, and with the thought of pre-eminence over others, and consequently with contempt for others. For this reason works done for the sake of reward are not good in themselves, because they do not spring from the genuine fountain; that is, from charity toward the neighbor. Charity toward the neighbor has within it the desire that it should be as well with him as with ourselves; and with the angels, that it should be better with him than with themselves. Such also is the affection of charity; and therefore it is averse to all self-merit, and consequently to all the doing of good that looks to reward. To those who are in charity, the reward consists in being able to show kindness, and in being allowed to do so, and in the kindness being accepted. This is the delight, nay, bliss itself that is enjoyed by those who are in the affection of charity. From this it is evident what that "reward" is that is mentioned in the Word, namely, the delight and bliss of the affection of charity; or what is the same, the delight and bliss of mutual love (n. 3816); for the affection of charity, and mutual love, are the same thing. (See n. 1110, 1111, 1774, 1835, 1877, 2027, 2273, 2340, 2373, 2400.) From all this it is evident that by "reward" in the external sense is here signified mutual love. [2] That in a sense still higher, or in the internal sense, by "reward" is signified celestial conjugial love, may be seen from the things that have been said above concerning the heavenly marriage (n. 2618, 2739, 2741, 2803, 3024, 3132, 3952), namely, that it is the conjunction of good and truth; and that mutual love is from this conjunction, or from this marriage (n. 2737, 2738). It is evident from this that "reward" in the internal sense is celestial conjugial love.  [3] That in the supreme sense "reward" is the Divine good of truth and truth of good, is evident from the fact that the heavenly marriage is thence derived; for this union is in the Lord, and proceeds from Him; and when it inflows into heaven, it makes the conjugial of good and truth, and thereby mutual love. From what has now been said and from what goes before, it is evident what is signified in the internal sense by these words of Leah: "God hath given me my reward, because I gave my handmaid to my man;" for by the "handmaid" is signified an affirmative means that serves for the conjunction of the external and the internal man (n. 3913, 3917, 3931). Thus before those things which are signified by the sons of the handmaids are affirmed and acknowledged, there cannot come forth any conjunction of good and truth, and thus not any mutual love; for these affirmations necessarily come first. This is what is meant by these words now before us. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3957.">3957.</a></font></span>
 <p>And she called his name Issachar. That this signifies its quality, is evident from the signification of "calling a name," as being the quality (see n. 3923, 3935); for Issachar was named from "reward," and hence the name involves what has been said above concerning reward, and at the same time what is signified by the rest of Leah's words. As by "Issachar" is meant "reward;" and as in the external sense "reward" is mutual love; and in the internal sense, the conjunction of good and truth, it may be well to state that very few at the present day in the Christian world know that "reward" has this meaning, for the reason that they do not know what mutual love is, and still less that good must be conjoined with truth in order that man may be in the heavenly marriage. I have been permitted to speak on this subject with very many in the other life who were from the Christian world, and with the more learned also; but wonderful to say, scarcely anyone of those with whom I have been permitted to speak knew anything about it, when yet they might of themselves have known much about such things if they had only been willing to use their reason. But as they had not been solicitous about the life after death, but only about life in the world, such things had no interest for them. [2] The things which they might have known of themselves had they chosen to use their reason, are the following: First, that when man is divested of his body, he comes into the full exercise of a much more enlightened understanding than when living in the body, for the reason that while he is in the body, corporeal and worldly things occupy his thoughts, which induce obscurity; but when he is divested of the body, such things do not interfere, and it is with him as with those who are in interior thought by abstraction of the mind from the things of the outward senses. From this they might know that the state after death is much more clear-sighted and enlightened than the state before death; and that when a man dies, he passes comparatively from shade into light, because he passes from the things of the world to those of heaven, and from the things of the body to those of the spirit. But wonderful to say, although they are able to understand all this, they nevertheless think the contrary, namely, that the state of life in the body is relatively clear, and that the state of life after being divested of the body is relatively obscure.  [3] The Second thing that they may know if they will use their reason, is that the life which man has procured for himself in the world follows him; that is, he is in such a life after death. For they may know that without dying altogether no one can put off the life which he has acquired from infancy; and that this life cannot be changed into another in a moment, still less into an opposite one. For example: he who has acquired a life of deceit, and has found in this the delight of his life, cannot put off the life of deceit, but is still in that life after death. He who is in the love of self, and thereby in hatred and revenge against those who do not serve him, and those who are in other such evils, remains in them after the life of the body; for these are the things which they love, and which constitute the delights of their life, and consequently their veriest life; and therefore such things cannot be taken away from them without at the same time extinguishing all their life. And so in other cases.  [4] The Third thing which a man may know of himself, is that when he passes into the other life he leaves many things behind which have no place there, such as cares for food, for clothing, for a place of abode, and also for gaining money and wealth, as well as for being exalted to dignities, all of which are so much thought of by man in the life of the body; but in the other life are succeeded by others that are not of this earthly kingdom. [5] Therefore the Fourth thing a man can know is that he who in the world has thought solely of such worldly things, so that he has been wholly possessed by them, and has acquired delight of life in them alone, is not fitted to be among those whose delight is to think about heavenly things, that is, about the things of heaven.  [6] From this follows also a Fifth thing; namely, that when the externals of the body and the world are taken away, the man is then such as he has been inwardly; that is, he so thinks and so wills. If his thoughts have inwardly been deceits, machinations, aspiration for dignities, for gains, and for fame thereby; if they have been hatreds and revenges and the like, it can be seen that he will still think such things, thus the things that belong to hell, however much he might for the sake of the before-mentioned ends have concealed his thoughts from men, and thus appeared outwardly to be worthy, while leading others to believe that he had not such things at heart. That all such externals, or simulations of worth, are also taken away in the other life, may likewise be known from the fact that outward things are put off together with the body, and are no longer of any use. From this everyone may conclude for himself what kind of a man he will then appear to the angels.  [7] The Sixth thing that may be known is that heaven, or the Lord through heaven, is continually working and inflowing with good and truth; and that if there is not then in men-in their interior man which lives after the death of the body-some recipient of good and truth, as a ground or plane, the good and truth that flow in cannot be received; and for this reason man while living in the body ought to be solicitous to procure such a plane within himself; but this cannot be procured except by thinking what is good toward the neighbor, and by willing what is good to him, and therefore doing what is good to him, and thus by acquiring the delight of life in such things. This plane is acquired by means of charity toward the neighbor, that is, by means of mutual love; and is what is called conscience. Into this plane the good and truth from the Lord can inflow, and be received therein; but not where there is no charity, and consequently no conscience; for there the inflowing good and truth pass through, and are turned into evil and falsity.  [8] The Seventh thing that a man can know of himself, is that love to God and love toward the neighbor are what make man to be man, distinct from brute animals; and that they constitute heavenly life, or heaven; while their opposites constitute infernal life, or hell. But the reason why a man does not know these things is that he does not desire to know them, because he lives the opposite life, and also because he does not believe in the life after death; and likewise because he has taken up with principles of faith, but none of charity; and consequently believes in accordance with the doctrinal teachings of many, that if there is a life after death, he can be saved by faith, no matter how he has lived, even if his faith is received in his dying hour. </p>

 <p>Verses 19, 20. And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob. And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my man dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons; and she called his name Zebulun. "And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob," signifies reception and acknowledgment; "and Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my man dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons," signifies in the supreme sense the Divine Itself of the Lord and His Divine Human; in the internal sense, the heavenly marriage; and in the external sense, conjugial love; "and she called his name Zebulun," signifies the quality. </p>

 <p>And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob. That this signifies the reception and acknowledgment of truth, is evident from the signification of "conceiving," as being to receive; and of "bringing forth," as being to acknowledge (see n. 3955); and from the signification of a "son," as being truth (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3960.">3960.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry, now will my man dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons. That this signifies in the supreme sense the Divine Itself of the Lord and His Divine Human; in the internal sense, the heavenly marriage; and in the external sense, conjugial love, is evident from the signification of "dwelling with," and also from the rest of the words Leah then spoke. The reason why "dwelling with," or "cohabitation," is in the supreme sense the Divine Itself of the Lord and His Divine Human, is that the Divine Itself, called the "Father," is in the Divine Human, called the "Son of God," mutually and alternately, according to the words of the Lord Himself in John:      Jesus saith, Philip, he that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father. Believe Me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (John 14:9-11; 10:38). That this union is the Divine marriage itself, may be seen above (n. 3211, 3952). Yet this union is not cohabitation, but is expressed by "cohabitation" in the sense of the letter; for things which are one are presented as two in the sense of the letter, as the Father and the Son; and even as three, as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; and this for many reasons, concerning which of the Lord's Divine mercy elsewhere. [2] That "dwelling together," or "cohabitation," in the internal sense is the heavenly marriage, is from the same cause; for this marriage comes forth from the Divine marriage, which is the union of the Father and the Son, or of the Divine Itself of the Lord with His Divine Human. The heavenly marriage is that which is called the Lord's kingdom, and also heaven; and this because it comes forth from the Divine marriage, which is the Lord. This then is what is signified in the internal sense by "cohabitation," and hence it is that heaven likewise is called the "habitation of God," as in Isaiah:      Look down from the heavens, and behold from the habitation of Thy holiness and of Thy adornment where is Thy zeal and Thy mighty acts? the yearning of Thy bowels, and Thy compassions toward me, have restrained themselves (Isa. 63:15); the "habitation of holiness" denotes the celestial kingdom; and the "habitation of adornment," the spiritual kingdom. "Habitation" in this passage comes from the same word as that from which "dwelling together" and "Zebulun" are derived in the passage under consideration.  [3] The reason why "dwelling together" or "cohabitation" in the external sense is conjugial love, is that all genuine conjugial love comes forth from no other source than the heavenly marriage, which is that of good and truth; and this from the Divine marriage, which is the Lord as to His Divine Itself and His Divine Human. (See what has been said before on these subjects; as that the heavenly marriage is from the Divine good which is in the Lord and the Divine truth which is from Him, n. 2508, 2618, 2803, 3132; that from it is conjugial love, n. 2728, 2729; that they who are in genuine conjugial love dwell together in the inmosts of their life, n. 2732; and thus in the love of good and truth, for these are the inmosts of their life; that conjugial love is the fundamental love of all the loves, see n. 2737-2739; that there is a marriage of good and truth in heaven, in the church, in everyone in it, and in everything in nature, n. 718, 747, 917, 1432, 2173, 2516, 2712, 2758; that this marriage is in everything in the Word, n. 683, 793, 801, 2516, 2712; and that thus in the supreme sense the Lord Himself is therein; that by "Jesus Christ" is signified the Divine marriage, n. 3004.) [4] These are the things signified not only by "dwelling together," or by the words, "now will my man dwell with me," but also by those which go before-"God hath endowed me with a good dowry;" by the former, however, the truth of good is signified; and by the latter, the good of truth; both together making the heavenly marriage. And as this is the conclusion, it is said: "because I have borne him six sons;" for "six" here signify the same as "twelve," namely, all things of faith and love; the half of a number and its double having the same signification in the Word, when the subject is similar. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3961.">3961.</a></font></span>
 <p>And she called his name Zebulun. That this signifies its quality, is evident from the signification of "calling a name," as denoting the quality (concerning which above). He was named "Zebulun" from "dwelling together," and hence the name involves what has been said above about "dwelling together" (n. 3960); and at the same time what is signified by the rest of Leah's words. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3962.">3962.</a></font></span>
 <p>Verse 21. And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah. "And afterwards she bare a daughter," signifies the affection of all these general truths; and also the church of faith in which there is good; "and called her name Dinah," signifies its quality. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3963.">3963.</a></font></span>
 <p>And afterwards she bare a daughter. That this signifies the affection of all these general truths; and also the church of faith in which there is good, is evident from the signification of a "daughter," as being affection, and also the church (see n. 2362); but the affection of what, and what kind of church, appears from what is added-as the celestial church when "Zion" is added, which is called the "daughter of Zion," and the spiritual church when "Jerusalem" is added, which is called the "daughter of Jerusalem;" and so in other cases. Here, where nothing is added, the church of faith in which there is good is signified by "daughter;" for up to this point the general truths of faith within which there is good have been described, and their reception and acknowledgment; these truths being signified by the "ten sons" of Jacob; and as immediately after them a daughter is said to have been born, it is evident from the series that this means the church in which are all these truths.  [2] Whether we speak of the church of faith in which there is good, or of the spiritual church, it is the same; and also if we speak of the affection of all, that is, of all these general truths; for the church exists from the affection of truth in which there is good, and the affection of good from which is truth; but not from the affection of truth in which there is not good, nor from the affection of good from which is not truth. They who say that they are of the church, being in the affection of truth and not in the good of truth, that is, who do not live according to truths, are much mistaken. These are outside the church, although within its congregation; for they are in the affection of evil, with which truth cannot be conjoined. Their affection of truth is not from the Lord, but from themselves; for they have regard to themselves, to the intent that by the knowledges of truth they may gain reputation, and thereby honors and wealth; but they have no regard to the church, nor to the Lord's kingdom, and still less to the Lord. But they who are in the affection of good from which there is not truth, are not of the church, although within its congregation; for they are in natural and not spiritual good, and suffer themselves to be led into every kind of evil and falsity, if only the appearance of good is induced upon the evil, and the appearance of truth upon the falsity (see n. 3470, 3471, 3518). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3964.">3964.</a></font></span>
 <p>And called her name Dinah. That this signifies its quality, is evident from the signification of a "name" and of "calling a name," as being the quality (concerning which above). The quality which Dinah represents and signifies is all that which is of the church of faith in which there is good, as described just above. The same is also evident from the derivation of her name, for in the original language "Dinah" means "judgment." (That "judgment" in the Word is predicated of the truth of faith, may be seen above, n. 2235; and that "judging" in the internal sense is the holy of faith, and in the external sense the good of life, n. 3921.) These things belong to the church. </p>

 <p>Verses 22-24. And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. And she conceived, and bare a son, and said, God hath gathered my reproach. And she called his name Joseph, saying, Let Jehovah add to me another son. "And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her," signifies foresight and providence; "and opened her womb," signifies the capacity to receive and acknowledge; "and she conceived, and bare a son," signifies reception and acknowledgment; "and said, God hath gathered my reproach; and she called his name Joseph, saying, Let Jehovah add to me another son," signifies in the supreme sense the Lord as to the Divine spiritual; in the internal sense, the spiritual kingdom, or the good of faith; and in the external sense, salvation, also fructification and multiplication. </p>

 <p>And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her. That this signifies foresight and providence, is evident from the signification of "remembering," when as here predicated of God, as being foresight, for "remembering" is looking toward anyone; and that in the supreme sense "to see" is foresight may be seen above (n. 3863); and from the signification of "hearkening to" anyone, when predicated of God, as being providence (n. 3869). </p>

 <p>And opened her womb. That this signifies the capacity to receive and acknowledge, is evident from the signification of "opening the womb," as being to give capacity to conceive and bring forth; thus in the internal sense the capacity to receive and acknowledge, namely, the goods of truth and the truths of good. That "conceiving and bringing forth" denote reception and acknowledgment, has been repeatedly shown above. </p>

 <p>And said, God hath gathered my reproach. And she called his name Joseph, saying, Let Jehovah add to me another son. That this signifies in the supreme sense the Lord as to the Divine spiritual; in the internal sense, the spiritual kingdom, or the good of faith; and in the external sense, salvation, also fructification and multiplication, is evident from the representation of Joseph in the Word (concerning which below); and from the signification of "God hath gathered my reproach," and also of "Let Jehovah add to me another son;" for he was named "Joseph" from "gathering" and "adding." "God hath gathered my reproach," signifies that Rachel was now no longer barren, and thus was not "dead," as she said of herself to Jacob (verse 1, n. 3908). For by Rachel is represented the affection of interior truth, or the interior man as to truth (n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819). The interior man is as it were dead as to truth and good, if the exterior or natural man does not correspond to it in respect to goods and truths (see n. 3493, 3620, 3623).  [2] These must be conjoined with each other, so as to be not two, but together one man. This conjunction cannot come forth until the natural or external man has been prepared, that is, until it has received and acknowledged the general truths signified by the ten sons of Jacob by Leah and the handmaids; and until the good of the natural man has been conjoined with the truths therein, which conjunction is signified by the last son of Jacob by Leah, namely, by Zebulun, who was so called from "dwelling together" (n. 3960, 3961). After this conjunction has been effected, the interior man and the exterior enter into the heavenly marriage, spoken of above (n. 3952). The reason why they do not enter into it before, is a great secret; for it is the good of the interior man which then conjoins itself with the good of the exterior, and by means of this with the truth therein; and likewise the good of the interior man by means of the affection of the truth therein, conjoins itself with the good of the exterior man, and also with the truth therein; thus immediately and mediately (concerning which immediate and mediate conjunction see above, n. 3314, 3573, 3616). As the interior man is then first conjoined with the exterior, and as before this conjunction has been effected the interior man is as it were null, and thus is as it were dead (as stated above), it is therefore said, "God hath gathered my reproach." This then is what is signified by the "reproach" which God is said to have "gathered," that is, to have taken away, or from which He is said to have delivered her.  [3] But by the words which follow: "Let Jehovah add to me another son," from which Joseph was named, another arcanum is signified, which is this. By Joseph there is represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom, thus the spiritual man; for this kingdom is in every spiritual man. There are two things that constitute the spiritual man, namely, charity and faith; or what is the same, good and truth. The charity from which is faith, or the good from which is truth, is that which is represented by Joseph; and the faith in which is charity, or the truth in which is good, is that which is signified by "another son," and is represented by Benjamin-concerning whom in Gen. 35:16-18. Thus "Joseph" is the celestial spiritual man; and "Benjamin" the spiritual celestial. What is the difference between these two may be seen from what has been very frequently said before concerning the good from which is truth, and the truth in which is good. This then is what is signified by Rachel's other words: "Let Jehovah add to me another son." But these arcana cannot be seen except by those who are in the charity of faith; for these are as to their interiors in the light of heaven, in which light there is also intelligence. But they cannot be seen by those who are only in the light of the world, for in this light there is not intelligence, except insofar as the light of heaven is within it. To the angels, who are in the light of heaven, these are among the most common things. [4] From all this we can now see that by these words, "God hath gathered my reproach," and "Let Jehovah add to me another son," in the supreme sense is signified the Lord as to the Divine spiritual; and in the internal sense, the Lord's spiritual kingdom, or the good of faith; for this is the spiritual in that kingdom. But that in the external sense by these words is signified salvation, also fructification and multiplication, is because this follows (see n. 3971). The Lord's spiritual kingdom, as already repeatedly stated and shown, consists of those who are in charity and thereby in faith. It is distinct from the Lord's celestial kingdom, for this contains those who are in love to the Lord, and thereby in charity. These constitute the third or inmost heaven; but those who are spiritual constitute the second or interior heaven. [5] The reason why "God" is first mentioned-"God hath gathered my reproach," and then "Jehovah"-"Let Jehovah add to me another son" is that the former name regards the ascent from truth to good, but the latter the descent from good to truth; for the spiritual man is in the good of faith (that is, in good from which there is truth); but before he becomes spiritual he is in the truth of faith (that is, in truth in which there is good); for "God" is used when the subject is truth; but "Jehovah" when it is good (n. 2586, 2807, 2822, 3921). [6] That by Joseph is represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom, or the spiritual man, and thus the good of faith, may also be seen from the passages in the Word where he is mentioned; as in the prophecy of Jacob, then Israel:      Joseph is the son of a fruitful one, the son of a fruitful one by a fountain, of a daughter, she marcheth upon the wall; the archers shall sorely grieve him and shall shoot at him, and shall hate him; but he shall abide in the strength of his bow; and the arms of his hands shall be made strong by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob; from thence is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel; by the God of thy father, and He shall help thee, and with Shaddai, and He shall bless thee with blessings of heaven from above, with blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb; the blessings of thy father shall prevail over the blessings of my progenitors even to the desire of the everlasting hills; they shall be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of the Nazarite of his brethren (Gen. 49:22-26). In these prophetic words there is contained in the supreme sense a description of the Lord's Divine spiritual; and in the internal sense, of His spiritual kingdom. What each particular involves shall of the Lord's Divine mercy be stated in the explication of that chapter. [7] So in the prophecy of Moses:      To Joseph he said, Blessed of Jehovah be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that lieth beneath; and for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, and for the precious things of the increase of the months; and for the firstfruits of the mountains of the east, and for the precious things of the everlasting hills; and for the precious things of the earth and the fullness thereof; and the good will of him that dwelt in the bush; they shall come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of the Nazarite of his brethren (Deut. 33:13-17). [8] As Israel represented the Lord's spiritual church (see n. 3305, 3654), therefore Jacob, then Israel, before his death said to Joseph:      Thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon. The angel who hath redeemed me from all evil bless the lads, that my name may be named upon them, and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the land (Gen. 48:5, 16). For there are two things that constitute the spiritual church-the understanding and the will, of which the understanding is represented by Ephraim, and the will by Manasseh. From this it is evident why Joseph's two sons were adopted by Jacob, then Israel, and were acknowledged as his own. "Ephraim" is also frequently mentioned in the Word, especially the prophetic Word, and by him is there signified the intellectual of truth and good, which belongs to the spiritual church. [9] In Ezekiel:      Jehovah said, Son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah and for the sons of Israel his companions and take another stick and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel his companions; and join them for thee one to another, into one stick, that they both may become one in thy <a name="fr_115"></a><a href="#fn_115"><font size="1">3969-1</font></a> hand. Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Behold, <a name="fr_116"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1">3969-2</font></a> I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim and the tribes of Israel his companions, and I will put them with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in My hand. And I will make them one nation in the land, in the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to them all, and they shall be no more two nations, and they shall no more be divided into two kingdoms again (Ezek. 37:16-17, 19, 22). The Lord's celestial and spiritual kingdoms are here treated of. The celestial kingdom is "Judah" (n. 3654, 3881, 3921 at the end); the spiritual kingdom is "Joseph;" and it is said that these kingdoms shall not be two, but one. They were also made into one by the coming of the Lord into the world.  [10] (That the spiritual were saved by the Lord's coming, may be seen above, n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834.) It is the spiritual of whom the Lord speaks in John:      And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, and one Shepherd (John 10:16). This is what is signified by the "two sticks, of Judah and Joseph, which shall be joined together into one, and shall be one in the Lord's hand." For the celestial constitute the third heaven, which is the inmost; but the spiritual the second heaven, which is the interior; and they are there one, because the one flows into the other (that is, the celestial into the spiritual), the spiritual kingdom being as a plane to the celestial, and in this way they have been firmly coestablished. For the Divine celestial in the third or inmost heaven is love to the Lord; and the celestial spiritual there is charity. This charity is the chief thing in the second or interior heaven, where the spiritual are. This shows what is the nature of the influx, and also of the coestablishment by means of the influx. "Wood" signifies good, both the good of love to the Lord, and the good of charity toward the neighbor (n. 2784, 2812, 3720). For this reason it was commanded that Judah and Joseph should be "written upon sticks of wood," which should "become one." [11] So in Zechariah:      I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will cause them to dwell, for I have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had not left them; for I Jehovah am their God, and I will answer them (Zech. 10:6); here again the subject is the two kingdoms, the celestial and the spiritual (the celestial being "Judah," and the spiritual "Joseph"), and the salvation of the spiritual. [12] In Amos:      Thus said Jehovah unto the house of Israel, Seek ye Me, and ye shall live. Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live, lest He break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it. Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate; it may be that Jehovah God Zebaoth will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph (Amos 5:4, 6, 15); where also the spiritual are signified by "Joseph;" the "house of Israel" is the spiritual church (n. 3305, 3654); "Joseph" is the good of this church, and it is therefore said, "Jehovah said unto the house of Israel, Seek ye Me, and ye shall live, lest He break out like fire in the house of Joseph." [13] In David:      Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that sittest upon the cherubim, shine forth. Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up Thy might, and come and save us (Ps. 80:1-3); here also in like manner "Joseph" is the spiritual man; "Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh" are the three constituents of that church. [14] Again:      Lift up the song and give the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery; blow the trumpet in the new moon, in the festival, on the day of our feast; for this is a statute for Israel, a judgment to the God of Jacob; he appointed it to Joseph for a testimony, when he went out against the land of Egypt; I heard a language that I knew not (Ps. 81:2-5); that "Joseph" here is the spiritual church, or the spiritual man, is manifest from every word and expression; for in the Word there are terms that express spiritual things, and others that express celestial things, and this with uniformity throughout. In this passage there are words that express spiritual things; as "song," "timbrel," the "harp with the psaltery," "blowing the trumpet in the new moon, in the festival on the day of our feast." From this also it is manifest that the subject is the spiritual church, which is "Joseph." [15] In Ezekiel:      Thus said the Lord Jehovih, This shall be the border whereby ye shall inherit the land, according to the twelve tribes of Israel; the lines shall be to Joseph (Ezek. 47:13); where the subject is the Lord's spiritual kingdom; and it is therefore said, "the lines shall be to Joseph." The Lord's Divine Spiritual is that which is also called His "royalty;" for the Lord's "royalty" is His Divine truth; and His "priesthood" is His Divine good (n. 2015, 3009, 3670). The Lord's royalty itself is that which is represented by Joseph, in his being made king in the land of Egypt, which representation shall of the Lord's Divine mercy be treated of in its place. [16] As regards the Lord's Divine Spiritual, or the Divine truth, which in the supreme sense is represented by Joseph, it is not in the Lord, but is from the Lord; for the Lord is nothing but Divine good; but the Divine truth proceeds from the Divine good. To speak comparatively, this is like the sun and its light; the light is not in the sun, but proceeds from it; or it is like a fire, the light of which is not in the fire, but proceeds from the fire. The Divine good itself is also compared in the Word to the "sun," and to "fire," and is likewise called the "sun" and "fire." The Lord's celestial kingdom lives from the good which proceeds from the Lord; but His spiritual kingdom from the truth thence derived; and therefore in the other life the Lord appears to the celestial as a sun; but to the spiritual as a moon (n. 1053, 1521, 1529-1531, 3636, 3643). Both heat and light proceed from the sun, the heat being-to speak comparatively-the good of love, which is also called celestial and spiritual heat; and the light, the truth thence derived, which is also called spiritual light (n. 3636, 3643). But within the celestial heat and spiritual light that in the other life proceed from the Lord as a sun, there are the good of love and the truth of faith, thus wisdom and intelligence (n. 1521-1523, 1542, 1619-1632, 2776, 3138, 3190, 3195, 3222, 3223, 3339, 3485, 3636, 3643, 3862); for all that which proceeds from the Lord is living.  [17] From this we can see what the Divine Spiritual is; and whence comes the spiritual kingdom, and the celestial kingdom; and that the spiritual kingdom is the good of faith, that is, charity, which flows in from the Lord immediately, and also mediately through the celestial kingdom. The Divine Spiritual that proceeds from the Lord is called in the Word the "spirit of truth," and is holy truth; not being of any spirit, but of the Lord through a spirit sent by Him; as may be seen from the words of the Lord Himself in John:      When He, the Spirit of Truth, shall come, He will guide you into all the truth; for He shall not speak from Himself; but what things soever He shall hear, these shall He speak; and He shall declare unto you the things that are to come. He shall glorify Me; for He shall take of Mine, and shall declare it unto you (John 16:13-14). </p>

 <p>Verses 25, 26. And it came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, and I will go to my place, and to my land. Give me my females, and my children, for whom I have served thee, and I will go; for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee. "And it came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph," signifies the acknowledgment of the spiritual represented by Joseph; "that Jacob said unto Laban," signifies the good of natural truth to the collateral good from a Divine origin, by means of which there is a conjunction of the interiors; "send me away, and I will go to my place, and to my land," signifies that there was then a longing of the natural represented by Jacob, for a state of conjunction with the Divine of the rational; "give me my females," signifies that the affections of truth belonged to the natural; "and my children," signifies that so did the truths thence derived; "for whom I have served thee," signifies from His own power; "and I will go," signifies conjunction with the Divine rational; "for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee," signifies labor and study by His own power. </p>

 <p>And it came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph. That this signifies the acknowledgment of the spiritual represented by Joseph, is evident from the signification of "bearing," as being to acknowledge (see n. 3905, 3911, 3915, 3919); from the representation of Rachel, as being the affection of interior truth (n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the spiritual kingdom, thus the spiritual man (n. 3969), and consequently the Spiritual; for the Spiritual, being from the Lord, is that which makes the spiritual man, and also the spiritual kingdom. In what is related of Jacob's sons by the handmaids and Leah, the reception and acknowledgment of general truths has been treated of, and at last their conjunction with the interior man, and thus man's regeneration even till he is made spiritual; "Joseph" being this spiritual man. In what now immediately follows, the fructification and multiplication of truth and good are treated of, which are signified by the "flock" that Jacob procured for himself by means of the flock of Laban; for after there has been effected the conjunction of the interior man with the external, or of the spiritual man with the natural, there takes place a fructification of good and a multiplication of truth; for this conjunction is the heavenly marriage in man, and these are born from it. From this also it is that fructification and multiplication are signified by "Joseph" in the external sense (n. 3965, 3969). ("Fructification" is said of good; and "multiplication" of truth, n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847.) </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3972.">3972.</a></font></span>
 <p>That Jacob said unto Laban. That this signifies the good of natural truth to the collateral good from a Divine origin, by which there is a conjunction of the interiors, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as being the good of natural truth (see n. 3659, 3669, 3677, 3775, 3829); and from the representation of Laban, as being collateral good from a Divine origin (n. 3612, 3665, 3778). That the conjunction of the interiors is effected through this good, has been repeatedly explained before (n. 3665, 3690, and elsewhere). This good is signified by the "flock of Laban," through which Jacob procured for himself his own flock (concerning which in what follows). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3973.">3973.</a></font></span>
 <p>Send me away, and I will go to my place, and to my land. That this signifies that there was then a longing of the natural represented by Jacob for a state of conjunction with the Divine of the rational, is evident from the representation of Jacob, who speaks these words, as being the good of natural truth (n. 3972); from the signification of "place," as being state (n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387); and from the signification of "land" here, as being the Divine of the rational; for by "my land" is meant his father Isaac and his mother Rebekah, as it was to them he desired to be sent and to go. (That "Isaac" is the Divine rational as to good, may be seen above, n. 2083, 2630, 3012, 3194, 3210; and also that "Rebekah" is Divine truth conjoined with the Divine good of the rational, n. 3012, 3013, 3077.) That a longing for conjunction is signified, is evident from the affection contained in the words. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3974.">3974.</a></font></span>
 <p>Give me my females. That this signifies that the affections of truth belonged to the natural; and that "and my children" signifies that so did the truths thence derived, is evident from the signification of "females," or "women," as being the affections of truth; his "woman Leah," the affection of external truth; and "Rachel," the affection of interior truth (concerning which frequently above); and from the signification of "children," as being the derivative truths; for by "sons" are signified truths (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373); and by the "children" that were born from the females, the derivative truths. It was a statute among the ancients that the females given to servants should be the masters with whom they served, and also the children born of them; as is evident in Moses:      If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve, and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. If his master give him a woman and she shall bear him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out with his body (Exod. 21:2, 4).      As this was a statute in the Ancient Church also, and was thus known to Laban, he therefore claimed for himself both the females and the children of Jacob, as is plain in the following chapter:      Laban said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flock is my flock, and all that thou seest, it is mine (Exod. 31:43); and because Jacob knew this, he said to Laban, "Give me my females and my children." But that statute, as stated by Moses in the place cited, represented the right of the internal or rational man that it has acquired over the goods and truths of the external or natural man; for by a manservant was represented the truth of the natural such as it is in the beginning, before genuine truths are being insinuated. The truth acquired in the beginning is not truth, but appears as truth, and yet as before shown it serves as a means for introducing genuine truths and goods; and therefore when goods and truths have been insinuated by it, or by its service, it is dismissed, and the genuine goods and truths thus procured are retained. It was for the sake of this representation that this law concerning the servants was delivered.  [2] But as regards Jacob, he was not a bought servant, but was from a more distinguished family than Laban. He bought for himself by his own service the daughters of Laban, and thus also the children born of them; for these were his wages. Laban's thought in regard to them therefore was not in accordance with the truth. Moreover, by a "Hebrew servant" was signified truth that serves for introducing genuine goods and truths, and by his "woman" the affection of natural good. With Jacob it was otherwise. By him is represented the good of natural truth; and by his "females" the affection of truth. Neither is that represented by Laban which is represented by the "master" in the law cited respecting a Hebrew servant, namely, the rational; but collateral good (see n. 3612, 3665, 3778); which is such that it is not genuine good, but appears to be genuine, and is of service for introducing truths (n. 3665, 3690), which therefore were Jacob's. [3] These things here advanced are indeed such as to fall into the comprehension of extremely few; because very few know what the truth and good of the natural are, and that they are distinct from the truth and good of the rational. Still less is it known that goods and truths not genuine, and which yet appear to be genuine, may serve for introducing genuine goods and truths, especially in the beginning of regeneration. Nevertheless as these are the things contained in the internal sense of these words, and in the internal sense also of those which follow respecting Laban's flock, from which Jacob procured a flock for himself, they are not to be passed over in silence. There may be some who will comprehend them. They who are in the desire of knowing such things, that is, who are in the affection of spiritual good and truth, are enlightened in regard to such matters. </p>

 <p>For whom I have served thee. That this signifies from His own power, is evident from the signification of "serving," as being labor and study (n. 3824, 3846), and which when predicated of the Lord, signifies His own power; for from His own power the Lord procured for Himself Divine goods and Divine truths, and made His Human Divine (see n. 1616, 1749, 1755, 1921, 2025, 2026, 2083, 2500, 2523, 2632, 2816, 3382). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3976.">3976.</a></font></span>
 <p>And I will go. That this signifies conjunction with the Divine rational, is evident from the signification of "going;" that is, to his place and to his land (n. 3973); by which is signified a longing for conjunction with the Divine of the rational. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3977.">3977.</a></font></span>
 <p>For thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee. That this signifies labor and study by His own power, may be seen from what has been said and adduced just above (n. 3975); thus without further explication. What these things involve further, is manifest from what has been said above (n. 3974), and also from what follows. </p>

 <p>Verses 27-30. And Laban said unto him, If I pray I have found grace in thine eyes, I have tested it, and Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake; and he said, Signify to me thy reward, and I will give it. And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy substance has been with me; for it was little that thou hadst before me, and it hath burst forth into a multitude, and Jehovah hath blessed thee at my foot; and now when shall I also be doing for mine own house? "And Laban said unto him," signifies perception from the good which is signified by "Laban;" "If I pray I have found grace in thine eyes," signifies a strong inclination; "I have tested it, and Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake," signifies from the Divine, for the sake of the good of the natural, to which it was to be of service; "and he said, Signify to me thy reward, and I will give it," signifies that it would of itself give that which was desired; "and he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee," signifies that it knew its mind [animus] and its power; "and how thy substance has been with me," signifies that this also was from the Divine; "for it was little that thou hadst before me," signifies that its good was barren before it was conjoined; "and it hath burst forth into a multitude," signifies fruitfulness thereafter; "and Jehovah hath blessed thee at my foot," signifies that it was from the Divine which the natural had; "and now when shall I also be doing for mine own house?" signifies that now its own good shall be made fruitful therefrom. </p>

 <p>And Laban said unto him. That this signifies perception from the good signified by "Laban," is evident from the signification of "saying," as being perception (see n. 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862, 3395, 3509); and from the representation of Laban, as being collateral good from the Divine (n. 3612, 3665, 3778). That perception from this good is signified by the words "Laban said unto him," is because by persons in the Word are not signified persons, but actual things; in the supreme sense the Divine things that are in the Lord; and in the internal sense, such things in man as are being treated of; thus by two persons, two things in the same individual. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3980.">3980.</a></font></span>
 <p>If I pray I have found grace in thine eyes. That this signifies a strong inclination, is evident from the signification of "finding grace in the eyes" of anyone as being a strong inclination. Strong inclination is predicated of the good which is signified by "Laban," when it desires to be present. He who reflects, or is able to reflect, upon the affections of good and truth in himself, and also upon their delight and pleasure, will notice a strong inclination for the one in preference to the other; but without reflection these and the like things do not appear. </p>

 <p>I have tested it, and Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake. That this signifies that it was from the Divine, for the sake of the good of the natural, to which it was to be of service, is evident from the signification of "testing that Jehovah hath blessed," as being to know for certain that it is from the Divine. That it was for the sake of the good of the natural, to which it was to be of service, is signified by "for thy sake;" for "Jacob" is the good of natural truth (n. 3659, 3669, 3677, 3775, 3829); and "Laban" is the collateral good which serves (as before shown passim; see also n. 3982, 3986). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3982.">3982.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he said, Signify to me thy reward, and I will give it. That this signifies that it would of itself give that which was desired, may be seen without explication. What has been said thus far is of such a nature as cannot be unfolded to the understanding in a clear manner, not only because the mind cannot be turned away in a moment from the historicals about Laban and Jacob to the spiritual things that are treated of in the internal sense (for the historical meaning always adheres and fills the idea, and yet must become null in order that what is not historical may be comprehended in a series and connection), but also because it is necessary to have a clear notion of the goods represented by both Laban and Jacob; and it must be remembered that the good represented by Laban is of such a nature as to be useful merely to introduce genuine goods and truths; and that when it has performed this useful service it is left behind. The quality of this good has already been described. It is like what is immature in unripe fruits, by means of which the juice is introduced; and when it has served this purpose it is afterwards absorbed, and the fruit ripens by means of other fibers, and at last by those of the genuine juice. [2] It is known that a man learns many things in infancy and childhood for the sole use that by them as means he may learn those which are more useful; and successively by these such as are still more useful, until at last he learns those of eternal life; and when he learns these, the former are almost blotted out. In like manner when a man is being born anew by the Lord, he is led by various affections of good and truth which are not affections of genuine good and truth, but are of use merely to enable us to apprehend these, and then to enable us to become imbued with them; and when this has been done the previous affections are forgotten and left behind, because they had served merely as means. The case is the same with the collateral good signified by "Laban," in respect to the good of truth signified by "Jacob," as well as by the "flock" of each (concerning which hereafter).  [3] These are the arcana contained in these words and in those which follow; but they are delivered in an historical form in order that the Word may be read with delight, even by children and by simple-minded persons, to the end that when they are in holy delight from the historical sense, the angels who are with them may be in the holiness of the internal sense; for this sense is adapted to the intelligence of the angels, while the external sense is adapted to that of men. By this means there is a consociation of man with the angels, of which the man knows nothing at all, but only perceives a kind of delight from it that is attended with a holy feeling. </p>

 <p>And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee. That this signifies that it had known its mind [animus], and its power, may be seen from the series of things in the internal sense. That to know anyone's quality is to know his mind, is manifest. And that knowing anyone's quality in his service, or "how I have served," is to know his power, may be seen from the signification here of "serving," as being one's own power (see n. 3975, 3977); for by Jacob is represented the Lord's Divine natural as to the good of truth, which has power. From this it follows that "how thy substance <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">3983-1</font></a> has been with me" signifies that this also was from the Divine. </p>
 
 
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3984.">3984.</a></font></span>
 <p>For it was little that thou hadst before me. That this signifies that its good was barren unless it was conjoined, may also be seen from the series in the internal sense. For the quality of the good represented by Laban, before it had been conjoined with the good of truth, which is "Jacob," is described as having been of little use, that is, barren. But how the case is with these things, will appear from what now follows. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3985.">3985.</a></font></span>
 <p>And it hath burst forth into a multitude. That this signifies fruitfulness thereafter, is evident from the signification of "bursting forth into a multitude," as being fruitfulness; that is, after it had been conjoined. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3986.">3986.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Jehovah hath blessed thee at my foot. That this signifies that it was from the Divine which the natural had, is evident from the signification of "Jehovah blessing," as being to endow with good (see n. 3406); and that this is conjunction (n. 3504, 3514, 3530, 3565, 3584); thus "Jehovah blessing" signifies to be endowed with Divine good through conjunction; here, with the good of the natural, which is represented by Jacob. It is the natural that is signified by the "foot." That the "foot" is the natural may be seen above (n. 2162, 3147, 3761), and the same will appear from the correspondence of the Grand Man with everything in man, as shown at the end of the chapters. From this it is evident that by "Jehovah hath blessed thee at my foot," is signified from the Divine which the natural had. [2] The arcanum which lies concealed within these words and in those which immediately precede, is known to few, if any, and is therefore to be revealed. The goods that are in men, as well within the church as without it, are absolutely various, so various that the good of one man is never precisely like that of another. The varieties come forth from the truths with which the goods are conjoined; for all good has its quality from truths, and truths have their essential from goods. Varieties come forth also from the affections of everyone's love; which are enrooted in and appropriated to a man by his life. Even in the man who is within the church there are few genuine truths, and still fewer in the man who is without the church; so that the affections of genuine truth are rare among men.  [3] Nevertheless they who are in the good of life, that is, who live in love to the Lord and in charity toward the neighbor, are saved. That these can be saved is because the Divine of the Lord is in the good of love to God and in the good of charity toward the neighbor; and where the Divine is within, there all things are disposed into order, so that they can be conjoined with the genuine goods and genuine truths that are in the heavens. That this is the case may be seen from the societies that constitute heaven, which are innumerable, and all of which in both general and particular are various in respect to good and truth, and yet all taken together form One Heaven; being circumstanced as are the members and organs of the human body, which, although everywhere various, nevertheless constitute one man. For a one that is formed of many is never constituted of units of exactly the same pattern; but of varying things harmoniously conjoined. Everyone is composed of various things harmoniously conjoined; and the case is the same with the goods and truths in the spiritual world, which, although various, so that they are never precisely the same with one as with another, nevertheless make a one from the Divine through love and charity. For love and charity are spiritual conjunction; and their variety is heavenly harmony, which makes such concord that they are a one in the Divine, that is, in the Lord. [4] Moreover the good of love to God and the good of charity toward the neighbor, however various may be the truths and the affections of truth, are nevertheless receptive of genuine truth and good; for they are so to speak not hard and resisting, but are as it were soft and yielding, suffering themselves to be led by the Lord, and thus to be bent to good, and through good to Him. Very different is the case with those who are in the love of self and of the world. These do not suffer themselves to be led and bent by the Lord and to the Lord, but resist stiffly, for they desire to lead themselves; and this is still more the case when they are in principles of falsity that have been confirmed. So long as they are of this character they do not admit the Divine.  [5] From all this it is now evident what is signified in the internal sense by the words which Jacob spoke to Laban; for by "Laban" is signified such good as is not genuine, because genuine truths have not been implanted in it; but yet it is of such a nature that these can be conjoined with it, and that the Divine can be in it. Such good is wont to exist in young children before they have received genuine truths; and also in the simple within the church, who know few truths of faith, and yet live in charity; and such good also exists among the upright Gentiles, who are in holy worship of their gods. By means of such good, genuine truths and goods can be introduced, as may be seen from what has been said about little children and the simple within the church (n. 3690); and about the upright Gentiles outside of the church (n. 2598-2603). </p>

 <p>And now when shall I also be doing for mine own house? That this signifies that now its own good shall be made fruitful therefrom, is evident from the signification of a "house," as being good (see n. 2233, 2234, 3128, 3652); and here of "my house," as being the good signified by "Jacob." That "to do for this house" signifies that the good therefrom is to be made fruitful, is manifest from the subject being the fructification of good and the multiplication of truth; for by "Joseph," the last born, this fructification is signified (n. 3965, 3969, 3971); and by the "flock" that Jacob procured for himself by means of Laban's flock, as now follows, this signification is described. That good is not fructified nor truth multiplied until the conjunction of the external man with the internal has been effected, may be seen from the fact that it is of the interior man to will good to another, and thereby to think good; but of the external man to do good, and thereby to teach good.  Unless doing good is conjoined with willing good, and teaching good with thinking good, there is no good in the man; for the evil can will evil and do good, and also think evil and teach good, as everybody can know. Hypocrites and profane persons are in this study and art more than others, so much so indeed that they can palm themselves off as angels of light, when yet they are devils within; from all which it is evident that good can be made fruitful with no one, unless doing good is conjoined with willing good, and teaching good with thinking good; that is, unless the external man is conjoined with the internal. </p>

 <p>Verses 31-33. And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me anything; if thou wilt do this word for me, I will return, and feed and keep thy flock. I will pass through all thy flock this day, removing from thence every small cattle that is speckled and spotted, and every black one among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and these shall be my reward. And my righteousness shall answer for me on the morrow, because thou comest upon my reward before thee; every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the lambs, stolen is this by me. "And he said, What shall I give thee?" signifies knowledge; "and Jacob said," signifies reply; "thou shalt not give me anything, if thou wilt do this word for me," signifies that it should be brought on the part of the good which is from truth; "I will return, and feed and keep thy flock," signifies that the good signified by Laban is to be applied to use; "I will pass through all thy flock this day," signifies that He perceives the quality of all the good; removing from thence every small cattle that is speckled and spotted," signifies that all the good that is His will be separated wherewith there is mingled evil (signified by the "speckled"), and falsity (signified by the "spotted"); "and every black one among the lambs," signifies an own that is innocent, which belongs to the good signified by "Laban;" "and the spotted and speckled among the goats," signifies that then all the good of truth in which falsity and evil are mingled shall be His; "and this shall be my reward," signifies that it was from Himself; "and my righteousness shall answer for me," signifies the Divine holiness which He had; "on the morrow," signifies to eternity; "because thou comest upon my reward before thee," signifies what is His own; "every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats," signifies what is not from the good signified by "Laban" mingled with evil and falsity in the goods of truth; "and black among the lambs," signifies the first state of innocence; "stolen is this by me," signifies that it was not His. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3989.">3989.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he said, What shall I give thee? That this signifies knowledge, may be seen from its being an entreaty and inquiry in order to know what and how much he wished to have for his hire or reward. "And Jacob said" signifies reply, is evident without explication. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3990.">3990.</a></font></span>
 <p>Thou shalt not give me anything, if thou wilt do this word for me. That this signifies that it should be brought on the part of the good which is from truth, is evident from the signification of "not giving anything," as being not to be brought by the good represented by Laban; but by the good represented by Jacob, which is the good of truth (n. 3669, 3677, 3829). But that which was to be brought is described in what follows. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3991.">3991.</a></font></span>
 <p>I will return, and feed and keep thy flock. That this signifies that the good represented by Laban is to be applied to use, namely, to introduce genuine goods and truths, as shown above, is evident from the signification of a "flock," here that of Laban, as being the good represented by him. "To return and feed and keep his flock," is to apply this good to use, as is evident also from what follows; for by that flock Jacob acquired his own, because it served him as a means, and thus for use. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3992.">3992.</a></font></span>
 <p>I will pass through all thy flock this day. That this signifies that He perceives the quality of all the good, is evident from the signification of a "flock," as being good (see n. 343, 3518); and from the signification of "passing through it all," as being to know and perceive its quality. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3993.">3993.</a></font></span>
 <p>Removing from thence every small cattle that is speckled and spotted. That this signifies that all the good and truth that is His will be separated wherewith there is mingled evil (signified by the "speckled"), and falsity (signified by the "spotted"), is evident from the signification of "removing," as being to separate; and from the signification of a "flock" (here one of goats and lambs), as being goods and truths (see n. 1824, 3519). That there are arcana in these and the following verses of this chapter, may be seen from many of the things being such as would not be worthy of mention in the Divine Word, unless there were within them things more arcane than appear in the letter; as that Jacob asked for his reward or hire the speckled and spotted among the goats, and the black among the lambs; that he then placed in the gutters rods of hazel and plane-tree with the bark peeled off to the white before the flocks of Laban when they grew warm, and that as regards the lambs, he set the face of the flock toward the variegated and the black in Laban's flock; and that he thus became rich, not by a good but by an evil art. In these things there does not appear anything Divine, whereas all things of the Word both in general and in particular, down to the smallest jot, are Divine. Moreover to know all this is not of the slightest avail for salvation; and yet the Word, being Divine, contains within it nothing that is not conducive to salvation and eternal life.  [2] From all this, and the like things elsewhere, everyone may conclude that some arcanum is contained within, and that each one of the particulars, notwithstanding its being of such a character in the letter, yields things more Divine within. But what they yield within cannot possibly appear to anyone, except from the internal sense; that is, unless he knows how these things are perceived by the angels, who are in the spiritual sense while man is in the historic natural sense. And how remote these two senses appear from each other, although most closely conjoined, may be clearly seen from the particulars already explained and from all the rest. The arcanum itself contained in this and the following verses of this chapter, can indeed be known in some degree from what has been already said concerning Laban and Jacob, namely, that "Laban" is such good as can serve to introduce genuine goods and truths, and that "Jacob" is the good of truth. But as few persons know what the natural is that corresponds to spiritual good, and still fewer what spiritual good is, and that there must be a correspondence between them; and as still fewer know that a kind of good which only appears to be good is the means of introducing genuine goods and truths, the arcana that treat of these things cannot be easily explained to the apprehension, for they fall into the shade of the understanding, and it is as if one were speaking in a foreign language, so that however clearly the matter may be set forth, the hearer does not understand. Nevertheless it is to be set forth, because that which the Word stores up in its internal sense is now to be opened. [3] In the supreme sense the subject here treated of is the Lord, how He made His natural Divine; and in the representative sense the natural in man, how the Lord regenerates it, and reduces it to correspondence with the man that is within; that is, with him who will live after the death of the body, and is then called the spirit of the man, which when released from the body takes with it all that belongs to the outward man, except the bones and the flesh. Unless the correspondence of the internal man with the external has been effected in time, or in the life of the body, it is not effected afterwards. The conjunction of the two by the Lord by means of regeneration is here treated of in the internal sense.  [4] The general truths that man must receive and acknowledge before he can be regenerated have been treated of heretofore-being signified by the ten sons of Jacob and Leah and the handmaids-and, after the man has received and acknowledged these truths, the conjunction of the external man with the interior, or of the natural with the spiritual signified by "Joseph" is treated of. And now in accordance with the order the subject treated of is the fructification of good and the multiplication of truth, which come forth for the first time when this conjunction has been effected, and precisely so far as it is effected. This is what is signified by the "flock" that Jacob acquired by means of the flock of Laban. By "flock" here is signified good and truth, as elsewhere frequently in the Word; and by the "flock of Laban," the good represented by Laban, the nature of which has been already stated. The "flock of Jacob" signifies the genuine good and truth procured by means of the good represented by Laban, and there is here described the manner in which these genuine goods and truths are acquired. [5] But this cannot by any means be comprehended unless it is known what is signified in the internal sense by "speckled," by "spotted," by "black," and by "white," which therefore must now be explained in the first instance. That which is speckled and spotted is that which is composed of black and white; and in general "black" signifies evil, and specifically what is man's own, because this is nothing but evil. But "dark" signifies falsity, and specifically the principles of falsity. "White" in the internal sense signifies truth, properly the Lord's righteousness and merit, and derivatively the Lord's righteousness and merit in man. This white is called "bright white," because it shines from the light that is from the Lord. But in the opposite sense "white" signifies man's own righteousness, or his own merit; for truth without good is attended with such self-merit, because when anyone does good, not from the good of truth, he always desires to be recompensed, because he does it for the sake of himself; whereas when anyone does truth from good, this good is then enlightened by the light that is from the Lord. This shows what is signified by "spotted," namely, the truth with which falsity is mingled; and what by "speckled," namely, the good with which evil is mingled.  [6] Actual colors are seen in the other life, so beautiful and resplendent that they cannot be described (see n. 1053, 1624); and they are from the variegation of light and shade in white and black. But although the light there appears as light before the eyes, it is not like the light in this world. The light in heaven has within it intelligence and wisdom; for Divine intelligence and wisdom from the Lord are there presented as light, and also illumine the universal heaven (n. 2776, 3138, 3167, 3190, 3195, 3222, 3223, 3225, 3339-3341, 3485, 3636, 3643, 3862). And in like manner although the shade in the other life appears as shade, it is yet not like the shade in this world; for the shade there is absence of the light, and accordingly is lack of intelligence and wisdom. As therefore the white and black there come forth from a light that has intelligence and wisdom within it, and from a shade that is lack of intelligence and wisdom, it is evident that by "white" and "black" are signified such things as have been stated above. Consequently as colors are modifications of light and shade in whites and blacks, as in planes, it is the variegations thus produced that are called colors (n. 1042, 1043, 1053). [7] From all this we can now see that that which is "speckled," that is, that which is marked and dotted all over with black and white points, signifies the good with which evil is mingled; and also that that which is "spotted" signifies the truth with which falsity is mingled. These are the things that were taken from the good of Laban in order to serve for introducing genuine goods and truths. But how these can serve this purpose is an arcanum which can indeed be presented clearly before those who are in the light of heaven, because as before said within this light there is intelligence; but it cannot be clearly presented before those who are in the light of the world, unless their light of the world has been enlightened by the light of heaven, as is the case with those who have been regenerated; for every regenerate person sees goods and truths in his natural light from the light of heaven, because the light of heaven produces his intellectual sight, and the light of the world his natural sight.  [8] A few words shall be added to further explain how the case herein is. In man there is no pure good, that is, good with which evil is not mingled; nor pure truth, with which falsity is not mingled. For man's will is nothing but evil, from which there continually flows falsity into his understanding; because, as is well known, man receives by inheritance the evil successively accumulated by his progenitors, and from this he produces evil in an actual form, and makes it his own, and adds thereto more evil of himself. But the evils with man are of various kinds; there are evils with which goods cannot be mingled, and there are evils with which they can be mingled; and it is the same with the falsities. Unless this were so, no man could possibly be regenerated. The evils and falsities with which goods and truths cannot be mingled are such as are contrary to love to God and love toward the neighbor; namely, hatreds, revenges, cruelties, and a consequent contempt for others in comparison with one's self; and also the consequent persuasions of falsity. But the evils and falsities with which goods and truths can be mingled are those which are not contrary to love to God and love toward the neighbor. [9] For example: If anyone loves himself more than others, and from this love studies to excel others in moral and civic life, in memory-knowledges and doctrinal things, and to be exalted to dignities and wealth in pre-eminence to others, and yet acknowledges and adores God, performs kind offices to his neighbor from the heart, and does what is just and fair from conscience; the evil of this love of self is one with which good and truth can be mingled; for it is an evil that is man's own, and that is born hereditarily; and to take it away from him suddenly would be to extinguish the fire of his first life. But the man who loves himself above others, and from this love despises others in comparison with himself, and hates those who do not honor and as it were adore him, and therefore feels a consequent delight of hatred in revenge and cruelty-the evil of such a love as this is one with which good and truth cannot be mingled, for they are contraries. [10] To take another example: If anyone believes himself to be pure from sins, and thus washed clean, as one who is washed from filth by much water; when such a man has once performed repentance and has done the imposed penance, or after confession has heard such a declaration from his confessor, or after he has partaken of the Holy Supper-if he then lives a new life, in the affection of good and truth, this falsity is one with which good can be mingled. But if he lives a carnal and worldly life, as before, the falsity is then one with which good cannot be mingled. [11] Again: The man who believes that a man is saved by believing well, and not by willing well; and yet wills well and in consequence does well-this falsity is one to which good and truth can be adjoined; but not so if he does not will well and therefore do well. In like manner if anyone is ignorant that man rises again after death, and consequently does not believe in the resurrection; or if he is aware of it, but still doubts, and almost denies it, and yet lives in truth and good-with this falsity also good and truth can be mingled; but if he lives in falsity and evil, truth and good cannot be mingled with this falsity, because they are contraries; and the falsity destroys the truth, and the evil destroys the good. [12] Again: The simulation and cunning that have what is good as their end, whether it is that of the neighbor, or that of our country, or of the church, are prudence; and the evils that are mixed up with them can be mingled with good, from and for the sake of the end. But the simulation and cunning that have evil as their end, are not prudence, but are craft and deceit, with which good can by no means be conjoined; for deceit, which is an end of evil, induces what is infernal upon all things in man both in general and in particular, places evil in the middle, and rejects good to the circumference; which order is infernal order itself. And it is the same in numberless other cases.  [13] That there are evils and falsities to which goods and truths can be adjoined, may be seen from the mere fact that there are so many diverse dogmas and doctrines, many of which are altogether heretical, and yet in each there are those who are saved; and also that the Lord's church exists even among the Gentiles who are out of the church; and although they are in falsities, nevertheless those are saved who live a life of charity (n. 2589-2604); which could by no means be the case unless there were evils with which goods, and falsities with which truths, can be mingled. For the evils with which goods and the falsities with which truths can be mingled, are wonderfully disposed into order by the Lord; for they are not conjoined together, still less united into a one; but are adjoined and applied to one another, and this in such manner that the goods together with the truths are in the middle and as it were in the center, and by degrees toward the circumferences or circuits are such evils and falsities. Thus the latter are lighted up by the former, and are variegated like things white and black by light from the middle or center. This is heavenly order. These are the things that are signified in the internal sense by the "speckled" and the "spotted." </p>

 <p>And every black one among the lambs. That this signifies an own that is innocent that belongs to the good signified by "Laban," is evident from the signification of "black," as being what is man's own (concerning which just above, n. 3993); and from the signification of a "lamb," as being innocence (concerning which below). As regards an own that is innocent, signified by the "black among the lambs," the case is this. In all good there must be innocence in order that it may be good. Charity without innocence is not charity; and still less is love to the Lord possible without innocence. For this reason innocence is the very essential of love and charity, consequently of good. An own that is innocent is to know, acknowledge, and believe, not with the mouth but with the heart, that nothing but evil is from one's self, and that all good is from the Lord; and therefore that what is man's own is nothing but blackness; that is to say, not only the own of his will, which is evil, but also the own of his understanding, which is falsity. When man is in this confession and belief from the heart, the Lord flows in with good and truth, and insinuates into him a heavenly own, which is white and lustrous. No one can ever be in true humility unless he is in this acknowledgment and belief from the heart; for he is then in annihilation of self, nay, in the loathing of self, and thus in absence from self; and in this manner he is then in a state capable of receiving the Divine of the Lord. It is by this means that the Lord flows in with good into a humble and contrite heart. [2] Such is the own that is innocent, which is here signified by the "black among the lambs" that Jacob chose for himself; but the white among the lambs is the self-merit that is placed in goods. (That "white" is merit has been shown above, n. 3993.) This Jacob did not choose, because it is contrary to innocence; for he who places self-merit in goods, acknowledges and believes that all good is from himself; because in the goods he does he has regard to himself, and not to the Lord, and accordingly demands recompense on account of his merit. Such a one therefore despises others in comparison with himself, and even condemns them, and consequently in the same proportion recedes from heavenly order, that is, from good and truth. From all this it is now evident that charity toward the neighbor and love to the Lord are impossible unless there is innocence within them; consequently that no one can come into heaven unless there is something of innocence in him; according to the Lord's words:      Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein (Mark 10:15; Luke 18:17); by a "little child" here and elsewhere in the Word is signified innocence. (See what has been said before on this subject, namely, That infancy is not innocence, but that innocence dwells in wisdom, n. 2305, 3494: What the innocence of infancy is, and what the innocence of wisdom, n. 2306, 3183: also, What man's own is when vivified by the Lord with innocence and charity, n. 154: That innocence causes good to be good, n. 2526, 2780.) [3] That "lambs" signify innocence may be seen from many passages in the Word, of which the following may be adduced in confirmation. In Isaiah:      The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them (Isa. 11:6); where the subject treated of is the Lord's kingdom, and the state of peace and innocence therein. The "wolf" denotes those who are against innocence; and the "lamb," those who are in innocence. Again in the same Prophet:      The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and dust shall be the serpent's bread. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all the mountain of My holiness (Isa. 65:25); where the "wolf" as above denotes those who are against innocence; and the "lamb," those who are in innocence. As the "wolf" and the "lamb" are opposites, the Lord also said to the seventy whom He sent forth:      Behold I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves (Luke 10:3). In Moses:      He maketh him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with the fat of lambs and of rams, the sons of Bashan (Deut. 32:13-14); here in the internal sense the celestial things of the Ancient Church are treated of, and the "fat of lambs" denotes the charity of innocence.  [4] In the original language "lambs" are expressed by various names, by which are signified the different degrees of innocence; for as before said, in all good there must be innocence to make it good; consequently there must be the same in truth. "Lambs" are here expressed by the same word that is used for "sheep" (as in Lev. 1:10; 3:7; 5:6; 17:3; 22:19; Num. 18:17); and it is the innocence of the faith of charity that is signified. Elsewhere they are expressed by other words, as in Isaiah:      Send ye the lamb of the ruler of the land from the rock toward the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion (Isa. 16:1). By still another word in the same prophet: The Lord Jehovih cometh in strength, and his arm shall rule for him; he shall feed his flock like a shepherd, he shall gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that give suck (Isa. 40:10-11); where to "gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom," denotes those who are in charity in which there is innocence. [5] In John:      When Jesus showed Himself to the disciples, He said to Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me more than these? He saith unto Him, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed My lambs. He saith to him a second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? He saith unto Him, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed My sheep (John 21:15-16). "By Peter" here and elsewhere is signified faith (see the preface to Genesis 18, and the preface to chapter 22, and n. 3750); and as faith is not faith unless it is from charity toward the neighbor, and thus from love to the Lord; and as charity and love are not charity and love unless they are from innocence, for this reason the Lord first asks Peter whether he loves Him, that is, whether there is love in the faith, and then says, "Feed My lambs," that is, those who are in innocence. And then, after the same question, He says, "Feed My sheep," that is, those who are in charity. [6] As the Lord is the innocence itself which is in His kingdom, the all of innocence being from Him, He is called the "Lamb"; as in John:      The next day John the Baptist seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world (John 1:29, 36). And in the Revelation:      These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them; for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they that are with Him are called, and chosen (Rev. 17:14, and elsewhere, in Rev. 5:6; 6:1, 16; 7:9, 14, 17; 12:11; 13:8; 14:1, 4; 19:7, 9; 21:22-23, 26-27; 22:1, 3). That in the supreme sense the paschal lamb is the Lord is well known; for the passover signified the Lord's glorification, that is, the putting on of the Divine in respect to the Human; and in the representative sense it signifies man's regeneration; and the paschal lamb signifies that which is the essential of regeneration, namely, innocence; for no one can be regenerated except by means of the charity in which there is innocence. [7] As innocence is the primary thing in the Lord's kingdom, and is the celestial itself there, and as the sacrifices and burnt-offerings represented the spiritual and celestial things of the Lord's kingdom, therefore the very essential of the Lord's kingdom, which is innocence, was represented by lambs. For this reason a perpetual or daily burnt-offering was made of lambs, one in the morning, and another in the evening (Exod. 29:37-39; Num. 28:3, 4), and a double one on the sabbath days (Num. 28:9, 10), and of still more lambs on stated festivals (Lev. 23:12; Num. 28:11, 17, 19, 27; 29). The reason why a woman who had given birth, after the days of her cleansing were accomplished, was to offer a lamb for a burnt-offering, and the young of a pigeon or a turtle-dove (Lev. 12:6), was that the effect of conjugial love might be signified (for that conjugial love is innocence may be seen above, n. 2736); and also because innocence is signified by "infants." </p>

 <p>And the spotted and speckled among the goats. <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">3995-1</font></a> That this signifies that then all the good of truth in which falsity and evil are mingled shall be His, is evident from the signification of "spotted," as being falsity; and from the signification of "speckled," as being evil; as shown above (n. 3993); and from the signification of "she-goats," as being the good of truth, or the charity of faith (n. 3519). That all this will be His, is also signified by what follows, "and it shall be my reward."  [2] A few words as to what the good of truth is, or the charity of faith. When a man is being regenerated the truth which is of faith apparently comes first, and the good which is of charity apparently follows; but when the man has been regenerated, then the good which is of charity manifestly takes the precedence, and the truth which is of faith manifestly follows. (That the former is the appearance, and the latter the real truth, may be seen above, n. 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576, 3603, 3616, 3701.) For when a man is being regenerated, he does what is good from the truth he has learned, because from truth he learns what is good; nevertheless it is the good within that effects this. For good flows in from the Lord by an internal way, that is, by the way of the soul; but truth flows in by an external way, or by the way of the senses, which is that of the body. The truth that enters by the latter way is adopted by the good that is within, and is conjoined with it, and this even until the man has been regenerated. A revolution then takes place, and truth is done from good. From this it is evident what the good of truth is, and what the truth of good. This is the reason why so many now say that the goods of charity are the fruits of faith; for so it appears in the beginning of regeneration, and from the appearance they draw this conclusion. Nor do they know otherwise, because there are few who are being regenerated, and no one can know this except the man who has been regenerated, that is, who is in the affection of good, or in charity. From the affection of good, or from charity, this can be clearly seen, and also perceived; but they who have not been regenerated do not even know what the affection of good, or charity, is; but reason about it as about something that is foreign to them, or outside of them; for which reason they call charity the fruit of faith, when yet faith is from charity. However, it is not very important for the simple to know which is prior and which posterior, provided they live in charity; for charity is the life of faith. [3] By "cattle" here are meant not only lambs, but also sheep, kids, she-goats, rams, and he-goats, although only lambs and she-goats are mentioned; and this because by "lambs" is signified innocence; and by "she-goats," the charity of faith; for these are the things here treated of in the internal sense. For this reason "spotted" is expressed in the original language by a word that also means "lambs" (as in Isa. 40:10, 11); and "speckled" by a word that also means a "herdman" (as in 2 Kings 3:4; Amos 1:1). </p>

 <p>And this shall be my reward. That this signifies that it was from Himself, is evident from the signification of "reward," as being what was his, that is, Jacob's, on account of his service; and that these things signify from His own power, or what is the same, from Himself, may be seen above (n. 3975, 3977, 3982). </p>

 <p>And my righteousness shall answer for me. That this signifies the Divine holiness the Lord had, is evident from the signification of "righteousness," as being predicated of good (n. 612, 2235); but when, as here, it is predicated of the Lord, it signifies the Divine holiness; for all spiritual and celestial good proceeds from the Divine holy of the Lord. </p>

 <p>On the morrow. That this signifies to eternity, is evident from the signification of the "morrow." When "yesterday," "today," or "tomorrow" is mentioned in the Word, eternity is signified in the supreme sense; "yesterday" signifying from eternity; "today," eternity; and "tomorrow," to eternity. (That "today" signifies eternity, see above, n. 2838.) For the times mentioned in the Word signify states; as "ages," "years," "months," "weeks," "days," and "hours," as has often been shown. With the Lord however there are no states; but everything is eternal and infinite. This shows that by "tomorrow" is signified to eternity. </p>

 <p>Because thou comest upon my reward before thee. That this signifies what is His own, is evident from the signification of "reward," when predicated of the Lord, as being what is His own; that is, acquired by His own power (concerning which above, n. 3975, 3977, 3982, 3996). </p>

 <p>Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats. That this signifies what is not from the good meant by "Laban," mingled with evil and falsity in the goods of truth, is evident from what was said above (n. 3993, 3995), where similar words occur. </p>
