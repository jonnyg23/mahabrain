 <p>And lifted up his voice and wept. That this signifies the ardor of love, is evident from the signification of "lifting up the voice and weeping," as being the ardor of love; for weeping belongs to sorrow, and also to love, and is the highest degree of each of them. </p>

 <p>Verses 12, 13. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father. And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob, his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house; and he told Laban all these words. "And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother," signifies the affinity of the good which is "Jacob" and of the good which is " Laban;" "and that he was Rebekah's son," signifies the conjunction of these affinities; "and she ran and told her father," signifies acknowledgment by means of interior truths; "and it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son," signifies the acknowledgment of the related good; "that he ran to meet him," signifies agreement; "and embraced him," signifies affection; "and kissed him," signifies initiation; "and brought him to his house," signifies to conjunction; "and he told Laban all these words," signifies from truths. </p>

 <p>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother. That this signifies the affinity of the good which is "Jacob" and of the good which is "Laban," is evident from the signification of "telling," as being to make known; and from the representation of Jacob, as being good (concerning which see above); and from the representation of Rachel to whom this was made known, as being the affection of interior truth (n. 3793); and from the signification of "brother," who here is Jacob, as being good (n. 367, 2360, 3303, 3459); and from the signification of "father," who here is Laban, as also being good (n. 3703). From all this and also from the series it is evident that by "Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother," is signified the affinity of the good which is "Jacob" and of the good which is "Laban." But to set forth this affinity itself, and the consequent conjunction of the two through the affection of interior truth (which is "Rachel") would be to make the subject more obscure, because few know what the good of the natural is, and that this is distinct from the, good of the rational; or what is the collateral good of a common stock; or again what is the affection of interior truth. He who by his own investigation has not acquired for himself some idea concerning these things, receives but a faint idea, if any, from description; for a man receives only so much from others as he either has of his own, or acquires for himself by looking into the matter in himself; all the rest passes away. Suffice it to know that there are innumerable affinities of good and truth, and that the heavenly societies are in accordance therewith (see n. 685, 917, 2739, 3612).  [2] The reason why Jacob calls himself the "brother" of Laban, when yet he was his sister's son, is that all are brethren from good; and for the same reason Laban in his turn calls Jacob "brother" (verse 15). It is good which makes blood relationship, and which conjoins; for good is of love, and love is spiritual conjunction. This is the reason why in the ancient churches all those who were in good were called brethren, and even in the Jewish Church but inasmuch as this church esteemed all others vile, and supposed themselves alone to be the chosen, they called only those brethren who were born Jews, and all others they called either companions or strangers. The primitive Christian Church also called all brethren who were in good, but afterwards only those who were within their own congregation. But the name "brother" vanished away from among Christians, together with good, and when truth succeeded in the place of good, or faith in the place of charity, then they could no longer from good call one another brethren, but neighbors. This also is the effect of the doctrine of faith without the life of charity, in that brotherhood with one of lower station than themselves seems to be beneath them; for with such persons brotherhood does not derive its origin from the Lord, and consequently from good; but from self, and consequently from honor and gain. 3803a. And that he was Rebekah's son. That this signifies the conjunction of these affinities, is evident without explication; for Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and the sister of Laban, was she from whom was the conjunction. </p>

 <p>And she ran and told her father. That this signifies acknowledgment by means of interior truths, is evident from the signification of "running and telling," as being the affection of making known, in the present case from acknowledgment; and from the signification of her "father," as being the good which is signified by "Laban." That the acknowledgment was by means of interior truths, is represented by Rachel, who signifies the affection of interior truth. From this it results that by these words is signified acknowledgment by means of interior truths. The case herein is this: The good which Jacob represents (which is the good of the natural), like all good in general, is known and acknowledged as to its existence, but not as to its quality, except by means of truths; for good receives its quality from truths, and thus by means of truths is known and acknowledged. Good does not become the good which is called the good of charity until truths are implanted in it, and such as are the truths that are implanted in it, such good does it become. [2] For this reason the good of one person, although it may appear precisely similar to that of another, is yet not the same; and with all persons whatsoever in the universe the good of one is different from that of another. It is the same with human faces, in which for the most part the affections are portrayed, and throughout the whole human race none are exactly alike. Truths themselves constitute as it were the face of beauty, the good of which is from the form of truth, but it is good that affects. Such are all angelic forms, and such would man be if from interior life he were in love to the Lord, and in charity toward his neighbor. He was created into such forms, because into the likeness and image of God; and such forms as to their spirits are they who are regenerated, however they may appear as to the body. From this it is evident what is meant by good being acknowledged by means of interior truths. </p>

 <p>And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son. That this signifies the acknowledgment of the related good, is evident in like manner from what results from the signification of these words in the internal sense; it is reciprocal acknowledgment which is thus described. It is evident that the subject here treated of is the good's choice, which choice precedes the marriage of good and truth. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3806.">3806.</a></font></span>
 <p>He ran to meet him. That this signifies agreement, is evident from the signification of "to run to meet," as being agreement, for it looks to conjunction; concerning which below. It is well known that agreement or similitude conjoins. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3807.">3807.</a></font></span>
 <p>And embraced him. That this signifies affection, is evident from the signification of "embracing," as being affection; for interior affection falls into this gesture, every affection having gestures in the body which correspond to it. That affection in general is expressed by embracing, is well known. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3808.">3808.</a></font></span>
 <p>And kissed him. That this signifies initiation, is evident from the signification of "kissing," as being conjunction from affection (see n. 3573, 3574, 3800), here, initiation into this conjunction, for initiation is precedent to conjunction. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3809.">3809.</a></font></span>
 <p>And brought him to his house. That this signifies to conjunction, is evident from the signification of "bringing to a house," as being to himself; for in the internal sense man himself is called a "house" (n. 3128, 3142, 3538); and this from good, which properly is a "house" (n. 2233, 2234, 3652, 3720). In the present case therefore the signification is to the good which is represented by Laban; so that by "bringing to his house" is here signified conjunction. There is here fully described in the internal sense the process of the conjunction of natural good which is "Jacob," with collateral good which is "Laban." The following five things constitute this process; namely, mutual acknowledgment, agreement, affection, initiation, and conjunction. Mutual acknowledgment was signified by Rachel running and telling her father, and by Laban hearing the report of Jacob his sister's son (n. 3804, 3805); agreement was signified by Laban running to meet him (n. 3806); affection by Laban embracing him (n. 3807); initiation by his kissing him (n. 3808); and conjunction by his bringing him to his house, as here stated. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3810.">3810.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he told Laban all these words. That this signifies from truths, that is, that the acknowledgment, agreement, affection, initiation, and conjunction were therefrom, is evident from the series, and also from the words as explained according to the internal sense, whereof this is the conclusion. (See what was said just above, n. 3804.) </p>

 <p>Verses 14, 15. And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he dwelt with him a month of days. And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me, what shall be thy reward? "And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh," signifies conjoined in respect to truths and to goods; "and he dwelt with him a month of days," signifies a new state of life; "and Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother," signifies because they have blood relationship from good; "shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me what shall be thy reward," signifies that there must be a means of conjunction. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3812.">3812.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. That this signifies conjoined in respect to truths and to goods, is evident from the signification of the words, "thou art my bone and my flesh," as being conjunction. The ancients had this form of speaking concerning those who were of one house, or of one family, or in some relationship-"my bone and my flesh" (see n. 157); and hence by these words is signified conjunction. The reason why it signifies as to truths and as to goods, is that all spiritual conjunction is effected by these, and all natural conjunction has relation to the same. Moreover, by "bone and flesh" is signified what is man's own; by "bone," the own of his understanding, and by "flesh" the own of his will; thus by "bone" is signified what is his own in respect to truth, for this is of the understanding; and by "flesh" is signified what is his own in respect to good, for this is of the will (n. 148, 149).  [2] As regards man's own in general it is of two kinds, one infernal and the other heavenly; that which is infernal is received by man from hell, and that which is heavenly from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord; for all evil, as well as all the derivative falsity, flows in from hell; and all good, and the derivative truth, from the Lord. This is known to men from the doctrine of faith, but scarcely one in ten thousand believes it. For this reason man appropriates to himself or makes his own the evil which flows in from hell, and the good which flows in from the Lord does not affect him, consequently is not imputed to him. The reason why man does not believe that evil flows in from hell, and good from the Lord, is that he is in the love of self, which love carries this with it, insomuch that it is exceedingly indignant when it is said that everything inflows. This therefore is the reason why all that is man's own is nothing but evil (see n. 210, 215, 694, 731, 874-876, 987, 1023, 1044, 1047). But that man believes that evil is from hell and good from the Lord comes from the fact that he is not in the love of self, but in love toward his neighbor and in love to the Lord, for this love is attended with such a belief. Thus it is that man receives from the Lord a heavenly own (concerning which see above n. 155, 164, 731, 1023, 1044, 1937, 1947, 2882, 2883, 2891). [3] In both senses this own is signified by "bone and flesh;" and consequently by "bones" in the Word is signified truth, and in the opposite sense falsity, and by "flesh" good, and in the opposite sense evil. That this is the signification of "bones," may be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah:      Jehovah shall lead thee continually, and shall satisfy thy soul in droughts, and shall make strong thy bones; that thou mayest be like a watered garden (Isa. 58:11); where "making strong the bones" signifies to make alive the own of the understanding, that is, to enlighten it with intelligence; whence it is said, "that thou mayest be like a watered garden." (That a "garden" signifies intelligence, may be seen above, n. 100, 108, 1588.) Again:      Then ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the grass (Isa. 66:14); where by "bones flourishing like the grass," the like is signified as above. [4] In Jeremiah:      Her Nazirites were whiter than snow, they were fairer than milk; their bones were more ruddy than gems, a sapphire was their polishing; their form is darker than blackness, they are not known in the streets; their skin cleaveth to their bone, it is withered, it is become like wood (Lam. 4:7-8); the "Nazirite" denotes the celestial man (n. 3301); "whiter than snow and fairer than milk" denotes to be in celestial truth; and because this truth is from the love of good, it is said that "their bones were more ruddy than gems." ("Whiteness" and "fairness" are predicated of truth, n. 3301; "ruddiness," of good, n. 3300; "gems," of truths which are from good, n. 114.) By "their skin cleaving to their bone" is described a changed state as to the celestial things of love, namely, that there was no flesh on the bones, that is, no longer any good; for then all truth becomes like skin which cleaves to the bone; it is "withered and become like wood." [5] In Ezekiel:     Utter a parable against the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovih, Set on the caldron, set it on, and also pour waters into it; gathering the pieces thereof into it, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones; taking the choice of the flock; and let there be also a hearth of bones under it; let the bones also be boiled in the midst of it (Ezek. 24:3-5, 10); where a "caldron" signifies violence offered to good and truth, wherefore it is called a "city of bloods" (verse 6); the "pieces, the good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder gathered into it" are flesh, by which are meant goods; the "choice bones" with which the caldron was filled denote truths a "hearth of bones," the affection of truth; the "bones being boiled in the midst of it," violence offered to truths. Everyone can see that Divine arcana are stored within this parable; and also that these arcana can in no wise be known unless it is known what is signified in the internal sense by a "caldron" or "pot," by "pieces," by "thigh and shoulder," by "choice bones," by a "hearth of bones," and by "boiling." In Micah:      Is it for you to know judgment, who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones; who have eaten the flesh of My people, and have flayed their skin from off them; and have broken their bones, and have divided them as into the pot, and as flesh in the midst of the caldron? (Micah 3:1-3); where the signification is the same. [6] In Ezekiel:      He brought me out in the spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley, which was full of bones. And He said unto me, Shall these bones live? He said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones hear the word of Jehovah; thus saith the Lord Jehovih unto these bones, Behold I will cause breath to enter into you that ye may live; I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come up upon you, and will cover you with skin, and put breath in you that ye may live. I prophesied, and the bones came together, bone to its bone; and I held and lo there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; and there was no breath in them and breath came into them, and they revived, and stood upon their feet (Ezek. 37:1, 3-8, 10). The subject here treated of in general is the setting up again of the church among the Gentiles; and in particular, the regeneration of man: "dry bones" denote the own of the understanding, which is inanimate before it receives the life of good from the lord, but is thereby animated or made alive; the "flesh which the Lord causes to come up upon the bones" is the own of the will, which is called the heavenly or celestial own, and thus signifies good; "breath" is the Lord's life, and when this inflows into that good of the man which he seems to himself to will and do from his own, the good is then vivified, and from the good the truth, and out of the dry bones there is made a man. [7] In David:      All My bones are unloosed, My heart is become like wax, I can number all My bones. They have parted My garments among them, and upon My vesture have they cast a lot (Ps. 22:14, 17-18); where the subject is the Lord's temptations as to Divine truths, which were the Lord's own, and hence are called "My bones;" and as to Divine good, which was the Lord's own, and hence is called "My heart." (That the "heart" signifies good, may be seen above, n. 3313, 3635.) And because "bones" signify these truths, the numbering of which denotes to desire to dissipate them through reasonings and falsities, therefore there immediately follow the words, "they parted My garments, and cast a lot upon My vesture;" for "garments" also signify truths, but exterior ones (n. 297, 1073, 2576); "dividing them and casting a lot upon the vesture," involves the like-as also in Matthew 27:35. Again:      My soul exulteth in Jehovah; it shall be glad in His salvation. All my bones shall say, Who is like unto Thee? (Ps. 35:9-10); where it is evident that in the spiritual sense "bones" denote the own of the understanding. Again:      Thou shalt cause me to hear joy and gladness; the bones which Thou hast bruised shall exult (Ps. 51:8); where the "exulting of the bones which were bruised" signifies re-creation through truths after temptations. [8] As "bone" signified the own of the understanding, that is, the own as to truth, and in the supreme sense the Divine truth which was the Lord's own, it was for this reason ordained as a statute of the passover that they should not break a bone of the paschal lamb; concerning which we read in Moses:      In one house shall it be eaten; thou shall not carry forth of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof (Exod. 12:46). And in another place:      They shall not leave of it until the morning, nor break a bone thereof (Num. 9:12); "not to break a bone," in the supreme sense signifies not to do violence to truth Divine; and in the representative sense, not to do violence to the truth of any good whatever; for the quality of good and the form of good are from truths, and truth is the support of good, as bones are of flesh. [9] That the Word, which is Divine truth itself, vivifies the dead, was represented by the man reviving and standing upon his feet who, when cast into the sepulcher of Elisha, touched his bones (2 Kings 13:21). (That Elisha represented the Lord as to truth Divine, or the Word, may be seen above, n. 2762.) That in the opposite sense "bones" signify the falsity which is from man's own, is manifest from the following passages. In Jeremiah:      In that time they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their sepulchers; and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the army of the heavens, which they had loved, and which they had served (Jer. 8:1-2). In Ezekiel:      I will lay the carcasses of the sons of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones round about your altars (Ezek. 6:5). In Moses:      God who brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and shall destroy their arrows (Num. 24:8). In the second book of Kings:      Josiah the king brake in pieces the pillars, and cut down the groves, and filled their place with the bones of man; he took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them upon the altar that he might defile it; he sacrificed all the priests of the high places who were there, upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them (2 Kings 23:14, 16, 20). In Moses:      The soul that hath touched upon the surface of the field one that is slain with the sword, or one dead, or the bone of a man, or a sepulcher, shall be unclean seven days (Num. 19:16, 18). [10] As "bones" signify falsities, and "sepulchers" the evils in which they are, and as hypocrisy is evil appearing outwardly as good, but is inwardly defiled with things false and profane, therefore the Lord says in Matthew:      Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for ye make yourselves like unto whited sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness; even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity (Matt. 23:27-28). From these passages it is now evident that by "bones" is signified the own of the understanding, both as to truth and as to falsity. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3813.">3813.</a></font></span>
 <p>As regards "flesh," in the supreme sense it signifies the own of the Lord's Divine Human, which is Divine good, and in the relative sense it signifies the own of man's will made alive by the own of the Divine Human, that is, by His Divine good. This own is what is called the heavenly own, which in itself is the Lord's alone appropriated to those who are in good, and thence in truth. Such an own have the angels who are in the heavens, and men who as to their interiors or as to the spirit are in the Lord's kingdom. But in the opposite sense, "flesh" signifies the own of man's will, which in itself is nothing but evil, and not being vivified by the Lord is called "dead," and thus the man himself is said to be dead. [2] That in the supreme sense "flesh" is the own of the Lord's Divine Human, thus His Divine good, is evident from the Lord's words in John:      Jesus said, I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if anyone eat of this bread he shall live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world. The Jews therefore strove one with another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you; he that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day; for My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed; he that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him. This is the bread which came down from heaven (John 6:51-56, 58); that here "flesh" is the own of the Lord's Divine Human, thus the Divine good, is very evident; and this is what in the Holy Supper is called the "body." That in the Holy Supper the "body" or "flesh" signifies the Divine good; and the "blood" the Divine truth, may be seen above (n. 1798, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3735); and because "bread and wine" signify the same as "flesh and blood," namely, "bread," the Lord's Divine good, and "wine," His Divine truth, therefore the latter were enjoined instead of the former. This is the reason why the Lord said, "I am the living bread; the bread which I shall give is My flesh; he that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, abideth in Me, and I in him; this is the bread which came down from heaven." (That "to eat" signifies to be communicated, to be conjoined, and to be appropriated, see above, n. 2187, 2343, 3168, 3513, 3596.) [3] The same was represented in the Jewish Church by the ordinance that Aaron, his sons, and they who sacrificed, and others who were clean, might eat the flesh of the sacrifices, and that this was holy (Exod. 12:7-9; 29:30-34; Lev. 7:15-21; 8:31; Deut. 12:27; 16:4). If therefore an unclean person ate of that flesh, he was to be cut off from his people (Lev. 7:21). (That these sacrifices were called "bread," may be seen above, n. 2165.) That "flesh" was called the "flesh of holiness" (Jer. 11:15; Haggai 2:12), and the "flesh of the offering which was on the tables in the Lord's kingdom," see Ezek. 40:43, where the new temple is described, by which there is evidently signified the worship of the Lord in His kingdom.  [4] That in the relative sense "flesh" signifies the own of man's will made alive by the Lord's Divine good, is evident also from the following passages. In Ezekiel:      I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit in the midst of you; and I will remove the heart of stone out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh (Ezek. 11:19; 36:26); where the "heart of stone out of their flesh" denotes the will and the own not vivified; and the "heart of flesh," the will and the own vivified. (That the "heart" is a representative of the good of the will, may be seen above, n. 2930, 3313, 3635.) In David:      O God Thou art my God; in the morning I seek Thee; my-soul thirsteth for Thee, my flesh longeth for Thee in a dry land; and I am weary without waters (Ps. 63:1). Again:      My soul longeth for the courts of Jehovah; my heart and my flesh cry out for joy unto the living God (Ps. 84:2). [5] In Job:      I have known my Redeemer, He liveth, and at the last He shall rise upon the dust; and afterwards these things shall be encompassed with my skin, and from my flesh I shall see God; whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold; and not another (Job 19:25-27); to be "encompassed with skin" denotes with the natural, such as man has with him after death (n. 3539); "from the flesh to see God" denotes the own vivified; therefore he says, "whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another." As it was known to the churches that flesh signified man's own, and as the book of Job is a book of the Ancient Church (see n. 3540), he therefore spoke concerning these things from what is significative, as concerning many other things, in accordance with the custom of that time; so that those who deduce from this passage that the dead body itself shall be collected from the four winds, and shall rise again, are not acquainted with the internal sense of the Word. They who know the internal sense, know that they shall come into the other life with a body, but a purer one; for in the other life there are purer bodies; for they see each other, converse together, and enjoy every sense as in the present body, but in a more exquisite degree. The body which man carries about here on earth is for uses on earth, and therefore consists of bones and flesh; and the body which the spirit carries about in the other life is designed for uses in that life, and does not consist of bones and flesh, but of things which correspond to them (n. 3726). [6] That in the opposite sense "flesh" signifies the own of man's will, which in itself is nothing but evil, is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah:      They shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm (Isa. 9:20).      I will feed their oppressors with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with new wine (Isa. 49:26). In Jeremiah:      I will feed them with the flesh of their sons, and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat everyone the flesh of his companion (Jer. 19:9). In Zechariah:      Let those who are left eat everyone the flesh of another (Zech. 11:9). In Moses:      I will chastise you seven <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">3813-1</font></a> times for your sins; and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons; and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat (Lev. 26:28-29). The own of man's will, that is, the nature of man, is thus described, for this is nothing else than evil and the derivative falsity; thus is hatred against truths and goods, which is signified by "eating the flesh of his arm, the flesh of sons and daughters, and the flesh of a companion." [7] In John:      I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God, that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of them that sit thereon, and the flesh of all both free and bond, both small and great (Rev. 19:17-18; Ezek. 39:17-20); that here by the "flesh of kings, of captains, of mighty men, of horses and of those that sit upon them, of all, both free and bond," are not signified such things as these, must be evident to everyone; thus that by "flesh" are signified other things which have hitherto been unknown. That evils which are from falsities, and evils from which are falsities, both from the own of man's will, are signified, is manifest from the several expressions. [8] As in the internal sense the falsity which results from the own of man's understanding is "blood"; and as the evil which results from the own of his will is "flesh," therefore the Lord speaks as follows concerning the man who is to be regenerated:      As many as received, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe in His name; who were born, not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (John 1:12-13). Hence it is that by "flesh" in general is meant every man (see n. 574, 1050); for whether you say man, or man's own, it is the same thing. [9] That by "flesh" in the supreme sense is signified the Lord's Divine Human is manifest from the passage above quoted, and also from this in John:      The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we held His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father (John 1:14). From this "flesh" all flesh is vivified, that is to say, every man is vivified from the Lord's Divine Human by the appropriation of His love, which appropriation is signified by "eating the flesh of the Son of man" (John 6:51-58), and by "eating the bread" in the Holy Supper; for the "bread" is the "body" or "flesh" (Matt. 26:26, 27). </p>

 <p>And he dwelt with him a month of days. That this signifies a new state of life, is evident from the signification of "dwelling," as being life (see n. 1293, 3384, 3613); and from the signification of a "month of days," as being a new state. (That all "times" denote states, see above, n. 1274, 1382, 2625, 2788, 2837, 3254, 3356, 3404; and therefore so do "years," "months," and "days;" but the quality of the states signified is evident from the numbers affixed.) But when a "year," "month," or "day" is mentioned in the singular number, it signifies an entire state; thus the end of the preceding and the beginning of the subsequent state, as has been shown above throughout the explications. Here therefore by a "month" is signified the end of the preceding and the beginning of the subsequent state, thus a new state, as also in other parts of the Word. As in Isaiah:      At last it shall come to pass from month to its month, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to bow themselves down before Me, saith Jehovah (Isa. 66:23). In John:      He showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, going forth from the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and of the river, on this side and on that, was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit every month (Rev. 22:1-2); "yielding its fruit every month" signifies a state ever new, in regard to the reception of good, and the practice thence resulting. [2] In Moses:      Number the sons of Levi by their fathers' house and by their families, every male from a month old and upward thou shalt number them. Number every firstborn male of the sons of Israel, from the son of a month and upward, and take the number of their names (Num. 3:15, 40); it was because the end of a preceding and the beginning of a subsequent state (that is, a new state), was signified by a "month," that it was commanded that their numbering should be "from the son of a month and upward." Again:      If thou seest among the captives a woman beautiful in form, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife, she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall sit in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a month of days, and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and shalt know her; and she shall be unto thee for a wife (Deut. 21:11, 13); where a "month of days" plainly denotes the end of a preceding, and the beginning of a subsequent or new state. </p>

 <p>And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother. That this signifies because they have blood relationship from good, is evident from the representation of Laban, as being the collateral good of a common stock; and from the representation of Jacob, as being the good of the natural (concerning which see above); and from the signification of "brother," as being good (n. 3803); here consanguineous good, because it is said by Laban to Jacob, consequently by good to good. Moreover, all blood relationship derives its origin from good, for good is of love. The nearest degree of love in the descending line is called blood relationship, and is understood in the proper sense by "brother." That in the spiritual world, or in heaven, no other consanguinities and affinities exist than those of love to the Lord and of love toward the neighbor, or what is the same, of good, has been made manifest to me by the fact that all the societies which constitute heaven, and which are innumerable, are perfectly distinguished from one another, in accordance with the degrees and differences of love, and thence of the derivative faith (see n. 685, 917, 2739, 3612); and also from the fact that they recognize each other, not from any relationship that had existed in the life of the body; but solely from good and the derivative truth. A father does not recognize a son or a daughter, nor a brother a brother or sister, nor even a husband a wife, unless they have been in similar good. They indeed meet when they first come into the other life, but are soon dissociated; for good itself, or love and charity, determines and assigns everyone to his own society. The blood relationship commences in the society in which each person is; and from this proceed the other relationships, even to the circumferences. </p>

 <p>Shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me, what shall be thy reward? That this signifies that there must be a means of conjunction, is evident from the signification of "serving for nought," as being without any obligation; and from the signification of "reward" as being a means of conjunction. "Reward" is occasionally mentioned in the Word, and in the internal sense signifies nothing else than a means of conjunction. The reason is that the angels are utterly unwilling to hear anything about a reward, as being on account of anything in them; nay, they are utterly averse to the idea of reward for any good or good action; for they know that with everyone that which is his own is nothing but evil, and that therefore whatever they do from their own would be attended with that which is contrary to reward; and that all good is from the Lord, and flows in, and this solely from mercy; thus that that is not from themselves for which they would think of reward. In fact good itself becomes not good when reward for it is thought of, for then a selfish end instantly adjoins itself, and insofar as this is the case, it induces a denial that the good is from the Lord, and from mercy; consequently so far it removes the influx, and of course so far removes from itself heaven and the bliss which are in good and its affection. The affection of good (that is, love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor) has bliss and happiness within it; these being within the affection and love itself. To do anything from affection and its bliss and to do it at the same time for the sake of reward, are things diametrically opposed to each other. Hence it is that when "reward" is mentioned in the Word, the angels do not perceive anything of reward, but that which is bestowed gratis and of mercy by the Lord.  [2] Nevertheless reward is of service as a means of conjunction with those who have not yet been initiated; for they who are not as yet initiated in good and its affections (that is, who are not yet fully regenerated) cannot do otherwise than think about reward, because the good which they do, they do not from the affection of good, but from the affection of bliss and happiness for the sake of self; and at the same time from the fear of hell. But when a man is being regenerated, this is inverted and becomes the affection of good, and then he no longer looks to reward. [3] This may be illustrated by what passes in civic life: he who loves his country, and has such an affection toward it as to find a pleasure in promoting its good from good will, would lament if this should be denied him, and would entreat that there might be granted the opportunity to do good to it; for this is the object of his affection, consequently the source of his pleasure and bliss. Such a one is also honored, and is exalted to posts of dignity; for to him these are means of serving his country, although they are called rewards. But those who have no affection for their country, but only an affection of self and the world, are moved to take action for the sake of honors and wealth, which also they regard as the ends. Such persons set themselves before their country (that is, their own good before the common good), and are relatively sordid; and yet they more than all others are desirous to make it appear that they do what they do from a sincere love. But when they think privately about it, they deny that anyone does this, and marvel that anyone can. They who are such in the life of the body with regard to their country, or the public good, are such also in the other life with regard to the Lord's kingdom, for everyone's affection or love follows him, because affection or love is the life of everyone. </p>

 <p>Verses 16, 17. And Laban had two daughters, the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. And Leah's eyes were weak, and Rachel was beautiful in form and beautiful in look. "And Laban had two daughters," signifies the affections of truth from the good which is from a common stock; "the name of the elder was Leah," signifies the affection of external truth with its quality; "and the name of the younger was Rachel," signifies the affection of internal truth with its quality; "and Leah's eyes were weak," signifies that the affection of external truth is such in regard to the understanding of it; "and Rachel was beautiful in form and beautiful in look," signifies that the affection of internal truth is such in regard to what is spiritual. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3818.">3818.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Laban had two daughters. That this signifies the affections of truth from the good which is from a common stock, is evident from the representation of Laban, as being the good of a common stock, but collaterally descended (see n. 3612, 3665, 3778); and from the signification of "daughters," as being affections (n. 2362), in the present case the affections of truth from the good which is "Laban" (n. 3793). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3819.">3819.</a></font></span>
 <p>The name of the elder was Leah. That this signifies the affection of external truth with its quality; and that the name of the younger was Rachel signifies the affection of internal truth with its quality, is evident from the representation of Leah, as being the affection of external truth; and of Rachel, as being the affection of internal truth (see n. 3793); and from the signification of "name," as being quality (n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3006). Leah is called the "elder" because external truth is first learned, and Rachel is called the "younger" because internal truth is learned afterwards, or what is the same, man is first affected with external truths, and afterwards with internal ones; for external truths are the planes of internal ones, being generals into which singulars <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">3819-1</font></a> are insinuated; for without a general idea of a thing man comprehends nothing that is singular. This is the reason why in the literal sense of the Word there are general, but in the internal sense singular, truths. The former are those called external truths; but the latter internal ones; and as truths without affection are not truths, because of no life, therefore when mention is made of external and internal truths, the affections of them are understood. </p>
 
 
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3820.">3820.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Leah's eyes were weak. That this signifies that the affection of external truth is such in regard to the understanding of it is evident from the representation of Leah as being the affection of external truth (see n. 3793); from the signification of "eyes" as being the understanding (n. 2701); and from the signification of "weak" as being relatively such. That the affections of external truth are weak in regard to the understanding; or what is the same, that they who are in them are so, may be seen from external, that is, general, ideas that are not yet illustrated by singulars, in that they are infirm and wavering, and are as it were carried away by every breath of wind, or in other words, suffer themselves to be drawn over to every opinion; whereas when the same have been illustrated by singulars, they become firm and steadfast, for from these they have the things both essential and formal which are signified by the "beautiful form and beautiful look of Rachel," by whom are represented the affections of interior truth. [2] What is meant by external truths and their affections, and by internal truths and their affections, and by the former being relatively weak-eyed, and the latter beautiful in form and look, may be illustrated by an example. They who are in external truths know the mere general truth that good is to be done to the poor; and they do not know how to discern who are truly poor, and still less that by the "poor" in the Word are meant those who are spiritually so. In consequence of this, they do good alike to the evil and the good, not being aware that doing good to the evil is doing evil to the good, for thus there is given the evil the means of doing evil to the good; and therefore they who are in such simple zeal are subject to the greatest infestations from the cunning and deceitful. They on the contrary who are in internal truths know who are the poor, and discriminate among them, and do good to everyone according to his quality. [3] To take another example: they who are in external truths know the mere general truth that they ought to love their neighbor; and they believe that everyone is the neighbor in the same degree, and thus that everyone is to be embraced with the same love, and so they suffer themselves to be led astray. But they who are in internal truths know in what degree everyone is the neighbor, and that each person is so in a different degree. Consequently they know innumerable things of which those who are in external truths are ignorant; and therefore they do not suffer themselves to be led away by the mere name of neighbor, nor to do evil from the persuasion of good which the name induces. [4] To take yet another example: they who are in external truths alone, suppose that in the other life the learned will shine like the stars; and that all who have labored in the Lord's vineyard will receive a reward above others. But they who are in internal truths know that by the "learned," the "wise," and the "intelligent," are signified those who are in good, whether they be in any human wisdom and intelligence or not, and that these shall shine as the stars; and that they who labor in the Lord's vineyard receive a reward each in accordance with the affection of good and truth from which he labors; and that they who labor for the sake of themselves and the world, that is, for the sake of self-exaltation and opulence, have their reward in the life of the body; but in the other life have their lot with the wicked (Matt. 7:22, 23). Hence it is manifest how weak in understanding are they who are only in external truths; and that internal truths are what give to these essence and form, and also give quality to the good with them. Nevertheless they who during their life in this world are in external truths and at the same time in simple good, in the other life receive internal truths and the consequent wisdom; for from simple good they are in a state and capacity of reception. </p>

 <p>And Rachel was beautiful in form and beautiful in look. That this signifies that the affection of interior truth is such in regard to what is spiritual, is evident from what has just now been said above. By "form" is signified essence; and by "look" the derivative beauty. </p>

 <p>Verses 18-20. And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. And Laban said, It is better that I should give her to thee than give her to another man; abide with me. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they were in his eyes as a few days for the love he had to her. "And Jacob loved Rachel," signifies the love of good toward internal truth; "and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter," signifies study, and at the same time a holy state, in order to be conjoined with internal truth; "and Laban said, It is better that I should give her to thee than give her to another man; abide with me," signifies a means of conjunction through interior truth with that good; "and Jacob served seven years for Rachel," signifies the accomplishment; "and they were in his eyes as a few days, for the love he had to her," signifies a state of love. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3823.">3823.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Jacob loved Rachel. That this signifies the love of good toward internal truth, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as being the good of the natural (see n. 3599, 3659, 3775); and from the representation of Rachel, as being the affection of internal truth (n. 3793, 3819); in the present case internal truth about to be conjoined with the good of the natural, with a view to which conjunction there was love. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3824.">3824.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. That this signifies study, and at the same time a holy state, in order to be conjoined with internal truth, is evident from the signification of "serving," as being study; and from the signification of "seven," as being that which is holy (see n. 395, 433, 716, 881); and from the signification of "years," as being states (n. 487, 488, 493, 893); that this was in order to conjunction is evident. Hence it is manifest that by "I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter," signifies study, and at the same time a holy state in order to be conjoined with internal truth. Internal truths are said to be conjoined with the natural when they are learned, acknowledged, and believed. In the natural of man, that is, in the memory of this man, there are truths both external and internal, and they are there in the form of memorized doctrinal things; but they have not been conjoined until the man is affected with them for the sake of the use of life, that is, until they are loved for the sake of life; for then good is coupled with them, whereby they are conjoined with the rational, consequently with the internal man. In this way there is an influx of life into them from the Lord. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3825.">3825.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Laban said, It is better that I should give her to thee than give her to another man; abide with me. That this signifies a means of conjunction through interior truth with that good, is evident from the signification of "reward," in regard to which the reply and affirmation are made in these words, as being a means of conjunction (see n. 3816). That "Rachel," who is here meant by "her," is interior truth; and that "Jacob," who is here meant by "thee," is good, has been shown above. In regard to the conjunction of the good which is "Jacob," with the good which is "Laban," by means of interior truth which is "Rachel," this is an arcanum which cannot easily be described to the apprehension; for in the first place there must be a clear idea of each good, and also of the affection of interior truth. Moreover, the understanding of every subject is according to the ideas; being none if there is no idea; obscure if the idea is obscure; perverted if the idea is perverted; and clear if the idea is clear. It is also according to the affections, by which the idea, even if clear, is varied. We shall merely state that in every man who is being regenerated the good of his natural, such as is here represented by Jacob, is conjoined first with good such as is here represented by Laban, through the affection of interior truth which is here represented by Rachel, and afterwards with the good of the rational and the truth thereof, which are Isaac and Rebekah. By means of this first conjunction, a man is in a state capable of receiving the internal or spiritual truths which are the means of the conjunction of the natural with the rational; that is, of the external man with the internal. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3826.">3826.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Jacob served for Rachel seven years. That this signifies the accomplishment, is evident from the signification of these words, as being study and at the same time a holy state in order to be conjoined with internal truth (see n. 3824). That here they signify the accomplishment of this thing, is evident. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3827.">3827.</a></font></span>
 <p>And they were in his eyes as a few days, for the love he had to her. That this signifies a state of love, namely, that it was free from tedium, is evident from the signification of "to be in his eyes," as being to so appear; and from the signification of "days," as being states (see n. 893, 2788, 3462, 3785). Hence, "as a few days for the love he had to her," denotes a state of love. When man is in a state of love, or of celestial affection, he is in an angelic state, that is to say, as if not in time, provided there is no impatience in the affection; for impatience is a corporeal affection, and insofar as man is in it, so far he is in time; but insofar as man is not in it, so far he is not in time. This appears in a kind of image from all the delights and gladnesses that belong to affection or love, in that when man is in them, he takes no note of time, for he is then in the internal man. By the affection of genuine love man is withdrawn from bodily and worldly things, for his mind is elevated toward heaven, and thus is withdrawn from the things of time. The reason why time appears to be something is that we reflect upon things that do not belong to the affection or love, thus which are tedious. From this we can see what is signified by the seven years being in his eyes as a few days for the love he had to her. </p>

 <p>Verses 21-24. And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my woman, for my days are fulfilled, and I will come to her. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him, and he came to her. And Laban gave her Zilpah his handmaid, unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid. "And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my woman," signifies that from general good there was now conjunction with the affection of interior truth; "for my days are fulfilled, and I will come to her," signifies that now was the state in question; "and Laban gathered together all the men of the place," signifies all the truths of that state; "and made a feast," signifies initiation; "and it came to pass in the evening," signifies the state as yet obscure; "that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him, and he came to her," signifies that as yet there was conjunction only with the affection of external truth; "and Laban gave her Zilpah his handmaid, unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid," signifies the external affections or external bonds which are subservient means. </p>

 <p>And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my woman. <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">3829-1</font></a> That this signifies that from general good there was now conjunction with the affection of interior truth, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as being the good of the natural (concerning which see above); in the present case general good, because the things of the natural are relatively general, there being innumerable things which flow from the internal man into the natural or external man which appear in this latter as one general thing, and still more so before the particulars of the generals have been received, as in the present case. For this reason the good which is represented by Jacob is now called general good. That conjunction with the affection of interior truth is signified, is manifest, for Rachel, who is here called "my woman," represents the affection of interior truth, as before shown. </p>

That by "my days are fulfilled, that I may come to her," is signified that this was now the state in question, is manifest without explication. </p>

 <p>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place. That this signifies all the truths of that state, is evident from the signification of "men" [viri] as being truths (n. 3134); and from the signification of "place," as being state (n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3832.">3832.</a></font></span>
 <p>And made a feast. That this signifies initiation, is evident from the signification of a "feast," as being appropriation and conjunction (see n. 3596); in the present case initiation, because initiation precedes conjunction, and likewise pledges and attests it. The feasts made in old times among those who were in significatives and representatives, signified nothing else than initiation into the mutual love which is of charity. The nuptial feasts also signified initiation into conjugial love; and the holy feasts, initiation into spiritual and celestial love; and this because feasting, or eating and drinking, signified appropriation and conjunction (as shown above, n. 3734). Because of this signification the Lord also said with the same meaning:      Many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 8:11). And in another place, to His disciples:      That ye may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom (Luke 22:30). And when He instituted the Holy Supper, He said:      I say unto you, that I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom (Matt. 26:29). Everyone may see that by "sitting down, eating and drinking in the Lord's kingdom," is not signified sitting down, eating, and drinking; but something which exists in that kingdom, and is the appropriation of the good of love and the truth of faith; thus it signifies that which is called spiritual and celestial food. It is also manifest from the above words that there is an internal sense in all that the Lord spoke, and that without understanding this it cannot be known what it is to sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to eat and drink in the Lord's kingdom at His table, and to drink with them of the fruit of that vine in the kingdom of His Father; nay, neither can it be known what is meant by eating bread and drinking wine in the Holy Supper. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3833.">3833.</a></font></span>
 <p>And it came to pass in the evening. That this signifies the state as yet obscure, is evident from the signification of "evening," as being an obscure state (see n. 3056). Among the ancients, who were in congruent rituals, the feasts that were made in the evening, that is, the suppers, signified nothing else than the state of initiation which precedes conjunction, which state relatively to the state of conjunction is obscure. For during man's initiation into truth and thence into good, all that he learns is obscure to him; but when good is being conjoined with him, and he regards truth therefrom, it then becomes clear to him, and this successively more and more; for now he is no longer in doubt as to whether a thing exists, or whether it is so; but he knows that it exists, and that it is so. [2] When man is in this state, he then begins to know innumerable things, for he now proceeds from the good and truth which he believes and perceives as from a center to the circumferences; and in proportion as he proceeds, in the same proportion he sees the things which are round about, and successively more and more widely, for he is constantly pushing out and widening the boundaries. Thenceforth also he commences from every subject in the space within the boundaries; and from these as from new centers he throws out new circumferences, and so on. In this way the light of truth from good increases immeasurably, and becomes like a continuous lucidity, for the man is then in the light of heaven, which is from the Lord. But with those who are in doubt and in discussion as to whether a thing exists, and whether it is so, these innumerable, nay, illimitable things do not appear one whit; to them all things in both general and particular are utterly obscure, and are scarcely regarded as one really existing thing, but rather as one thing the existence of which is doubtful. In such a state is human wisdom and intelligence at this day, when he is deemed wise who can reason with ingenuity as to whether a thing exists; and he is deemed still wiser who can reason that it does not exist.  [3] For example take the proposition that there is an internal sense of the Word, which is called mystical: until this is believed, it is impossible for men to know the least of the innumerable things which are in the internal sense, and which are so many as to fill the whole heaven with an infinite variety. Another example is that the man who reasons concerning the Divine Providence, as to whether it is only universal, and not in the singulars, cannot possibly know the innumerable arcana of Providence, which are as many in number as are the contingencies of everyone's life from first to last, and from the creation of the world to its end; nay, even to eternity. Again: he who reasons as to whether it is possible for anyone to be in good, seeing that the will of man is radically depraved, can never know all the arcana relating to regeneration, nor even that a new will is implanted by the Lord, nor the arcana relating to this implantation; and so with everything else. From this it may be known in what obscurity such persons are, and that they do not even see, much less touch, the first threshold of wisdom. </p>

 <p>That he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him, and he came to her. That this signifies that as yet there was conjunction only with the affection of external truth, is evident from the representation of Leah, as being the affection of external truth (see n. 3793, 3819). That "to bring her to him" signifies conjunction such as that which is conjugial, is manifest. The case herein is this: The man who is in the affection of internal truth, that is, in the desire to know the interior arcana of the Lord's kingdom, has not at first these arcana conjoined with him, even although he knows them, and at times acknowledges, and as it were believes them, for as yet there are present with him worldly and corporeal affections, which cause him to indeed receive and as it were believe these arcana; but insofar as these affections are present, so far the interior truths in question cannot be conjoined. It is only the affection of truth from good, and the affection of good, that applies these arcana to itself; and insofar as man is in these affections, so far interior truths are conjoined with him, for truths are the vessels that receive good. [2] The Lord also provides that celestial and spiritual truths (such as are all interior truths) should not be conjoined with any other affections than genuine ones. For this reason the general affection of truth from good precedes, and the truths that are insinuated therein are nothing but general truths. The states of truth are altogether in accordance with the states of good, that is, the states of faith with the states of charity. For example: it is possible for the wicked to know that the Lord rules the universal heaven, and also that heaven is mutual love and love to the Lord; also that by such love those who are there have conjunction with the Lord, and wisdom, and likewise happiness; nay, it is possible for them to be in the persuasion that it is so; and yet the truth of faith may not be conjoined with them, and still less the good of love. From the life it is known whether these have been conjoined, just as a tree is known by its fruit. The case in respect to this is like that of grapes in which there are no stones, and which, when buried in earth however fertile, dissolve into mere mold; or like that of an ignis fatuus in the night, which is dissipated as soon as the sun rises. But of the Lord's Divine mercy more on this subject hereafter. </p>

 <p>And Laban gave her Zilpah his handmaid, unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid. That this signifies the external affections, or external bonds, which are subservient means, is evident from the signification of a "handmaid," as being the external affections (see n. 1895, 2567). That "Laban gave her" signifies that they are from the collateral good of a common stock, for this is the origin of such affections. They are called external bonds, because all affections are bonds (n. 1077, 1080, 1835, 1944), for nothing holds man in bonds except his affection. The affection of each man does not indeed appear to him as a bond, yet still it is so called because it rules him, and keeps him bound to it. Internal affections, however, are called internal bonds, the affections of truth and of good being called the bonds of conscience. To these correspond external bonds or external affections, for every internal has a corresponding external. As the man who is being regenerated is introduced to internal things by means of external ones, and as this state of introduction is here treated of, therefore it is here said that Laban's handmaid was given to his daughter Leah for a handmaid, by which is signified that such affections were given as serve as the means of introduction. That these affections were the most external ones, such as are those called the affections of the body, is evident from the fact that Leah represents the affections of external truth. But on this subject also, of the Lord's Divine mercy more elsewhere. </p>

 <p>Verses 25, 26. And it came to pass in the morning that behold it was Leah; and he said unto Laban, What is this that thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? And why hast thou defrauded me? And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn. "And it came to pass in the morning," signifies enlightenment in that state; "that behold it was Leah," signifies that there was conjunction with external truth; "and he said unto Laban, What is this that thou hast done unto me?" signifies indignation; "did not I serve with thee for Rachel?" signifies that there had been study for the affection of internal truth; "and why hast thou defrauded me?" signifies greater indignation; "and Laban said, It is not so done in our place," signifies that the state is not such; "to give the younger before the firstborn," signifies that the affection of interior truth should precede the affection of external truth. </p>

 <p>And it came to pass in the morning. That this signifies enlightenment in that state, is evident from the signification of "morning," as being enlightenment (see n. 3458, 3723); and as all times signify states (n. 2625, 2788, 2837, 3356), so also does "morning-tide" or "morning." The enlightenment has reference to what presently follows, namely, that he acknowledged that there was conjunction with external truth only. </p>

 <p>That behold it was Leah. That this signifies that there was conjunction with external truth, is evident from the representation of Leah, as being the affection of external truth (see n. 3793, 3819). That these words signify conjunction with this affection is evident, because it was Leah who was given for a woman, instead of Rachel. What this involves is evident from what has been already said concerning conjunction with external truths previous to conjunction with internal truths (n. 3834), and from what will be said below (see n. 3843). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3839.">3839.</a></font></span>
 <p>And he said unto Laban, What is this that thou hast done unto me? That this signifies indignation, is evident from the affection in these words, and in those which follow. It is evident that it is an affection of indignation which according to the historical series falls into these words. There are two things which constitute the internal sense of the Word, namely, affections and actual things; the affections that lie hidden in the expressions of the Word are not manifest to man, but are stored up in its inmost recesses; nor can they be made manifest to him, because during his life in the body he is in worldly and corporeal affections, which have nothing in common with the affections in the internal sense of the Word; these latter being affections of spiritual and celestial love, which man is the less capable of perceiving because there are few who are in them, and these few are mostly simple persons, who are not able to reflect upon their affections, while all the rest do not even know what genuine affection is. These spiritual and celestial affections are contained in charity toward the neighbor, and in love to God. Those who are not in them believe that they are not anything, when yet they fill the whole heaven, and this with unspeakable variety. Such affections together with their varieties are what are stored up in the internal sense of the Word, and are there, not only in each series, but also in each expression, nay, in each syllable, and they shine forth before the angels when the Word is being read by those who are in simple good and who are at the same time in innocence; and this, as before said, with unlimited variety.  [2] There are principally two kinds of affections which shine forth from the Word before the angels, namely, affections of truth and affections of good-affections of truth before the spiritual angels, and affections of good before the celestial angels. Affections of good, which are of love to the Lord, are altogether unutterable to man, and are therefore incomprehensible; but affections of truth, which are of mutual love, may in some measure be comprehended as to what is most general, yet only by those who are in genuine mutual love, and this not from any internal perception, but from such as is obscure. [3] For example, in regard to the affection of indignation, which is here treated of-whoever does not know what the affection of charity is, in consequence of not being in it, can have no other idea than of such indignation as a man has when anything evil is done to him, which is the indignation of anger. The angels however have no such indignation, but an indignation altogether different, which is not of anger, but of zeal, in which there is nothing of evil, and which is as far removed from hatred or revenge, or from the spirit of returning evil for evil, as heaven is from hell; for it springs from good. But as before said the nature of this indignation cannot be expressed by any words. [4] The case is similar in regard to the other affections which are from good and truth, and which are of good and truth, as is also evident from the fact that the angels are solely in ends, and in the uses of ends (n. 1317, 1645, 3645). Ends are nothing else than loves or affections (n. 1317, 1568, 1571, 1909, 3425, 3796); for what a man loves, that he regards as an end. And this being the case, the angels are in the affections of the things that are in the Word; and this with all variety, according to the kinds of affections in which the angels are. From this it is sufficiently evident how holy the Word is; for in the Divine love, that is, in the love which is from the Divine, there is holiness, and therefore in the things contained in the Word. </p>

 <p>Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? That this signifies that there had been study for the affection of internal truth, is evident from the representation of Rachel, as being the affection of internal truth (see n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819); and from the signification of "serving," as being study (n. 3824). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3841.">3841.</a></font></span>

 <p>And Laban said, It is not so done in our place. That this signifies that the state is not such, is evident from the signification of "place," as being state (see n. 1273-1275, 1377, 2025, 2837, 3356, 3387). From this it is evident that the expression "it is not so done in our place," signifies that the state is not such. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3843.">3843.</a></font></span>
 <p>To give the younger before the firstborn. That this signifies that the affection of interior truth should precede the affection of external truth, is evident from the representation of Rachel, who is here the "younger," as being the affection of interior truth (see n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819); and from the representation of Leah, who is here the "firstborn," as being the affection of external truth (n. 3793, 3819). From this it is evident that "to give the younger before the firstborn" signifies that the affection of interior truth should precede the affection of external truth. How the case herein is was briefly explained above (n. 3834); and may be further seen from the following. He who knows not the state of man, may believe that there is conjunction with truths not only external but also internal when he is acquainted with both kinds, or has both in his memory. Nevertheless there is no conjunction until the man lives according to them, for the life shows the conjunction.  [2] Truth is in this respect like everything else that is implanted in man from childhood, namely, that it does not become his own until he acts according to it, and this from affection, in which case his will becomes imbued with it, and it is then no longer brought into act from memory-knowledge or doctrine, but from a certain delight that is unknown to him; and as it were from his disposition or nature; for everyone acquires for himself such a nature by frequent use or habit, and this from the things which he has learned. Therefore conjunction with truths cannot take place with a man until those things which he has learned by means of doctrines have been insinuated from the external man into the interior man. When they are in the interior man, the man no longer acts from the memory, but from his own nature, until at last the things thus insinuated flow spontaneously into act, being inscribed on the man's interior memory; and that which comes forth from this, appears as if it were innate. This may be seen from the languages a man has learned in childhood, and also from the faculty of reasoning, and likewise from conscience. Hence it is manifest that truths of doctrine, even those which are interior, are not conjoined with a man until they are of the life. But concerning these matters, of the Lord's Divine mercy more shall be said elsewhere. </p>

 <p>Verses 27-30. Fulfill this week, and we will give thee her also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled this week, and he gave him Rachel his daughter for a woman. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be to her for a handmaid. And he came also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. "Fulfill this week," signifies a succession of the study; "and we will give thee her also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years," signifies that then there would be a full state of study; "and Jacob did so, and fulfilled this week," signifies the effect of this; "and he gave him Rachel his daughter for a woman," signifies now the conjunction of good with the affection of interior truth; "and Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be to her for a handmaid," signifies the exterior affections which are the bonds or subservient means; "and he came also unto Rachel," signifies conjunction with the affection of internal truth; "and he loved also Rachel more than Leah," signifies the love of internal truth more than of external truth; "and served with him yet seven other years," signifies holy study. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3845.">3845.</a></font></span>
 <p>Fulfill this week. That this signifies a further succession of study, is evident from the signification of "fulfilling," as here being to serve or fulfill by serving, thus study (see n. 3824); and from the signification of a "week," as being a state and also an entire period (n. 728, 2044); in the present case therefore a subsequent state and period, consequently what is successive. In regard to the signification of a "week," this is the same as with the signification of a "month" (n. 3814), namely, that when it is mentioned in the singular number, it signifies the end of a former and the beginning of a subsequent state, thus a new state, to "fulfill" which is to proceed from the beginning to the end. The reason why a "week," like all times specifically, signifies a state and also a period, is that all states have also their periods, that is; their beginning, successive progress, and end; yet in the other life these are not perceived as times, but as states and their revolutions. It is here very evident what the ancients understood by a week, namely, in a proper sense, every period that was distinguished into seven, whether it was of days, or of years, or of ages; thus whether it was great or small. That here it is a period of seven years is manifest; and as with the ancients seven signified that which is holy (n. 84-87, 395, 433, 716, 881), a "week" signified a holy period, and also the holiness of a period. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3846.">3846.</a></font></span>
 <p>And we will give thee her also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. That this signifies that then there would be a full state of study, is evident from the signification of "service" and of "serving," as being study (see n. 3824); and from the signification of "seven years," as being the same as a "week," namely, a state and an entire period, as above (n. 3845); thus a full state, which is also holy (n. 3824). This expression, "we will give thee her also," signifies that then there would be conjunction with the affection of internal truth. The reason why in the internal sense "serving" is study, is that the labor of the external man is study in the internal man. Hence study is called a labor of the mind. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3847.">3847.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Jacob did so, and fulfilled this week. That this signifies the effect of this, is evident from the signification of "fulfilling a week," as being a succession of the study (see above, n. 3845); and that the effect of this is here meant, is manifest. </p>

 <p>And he gave him Rachel his daughter for a woman. That this signifies now the conjunction of good with the affection of interior truth, is evident from the representation of Jacob as being the good of the natural, as already shown; and from the representation of Rachel as being the affection of interior truth, as also before shown: that "giving her for a woman" signifies conjunction, is manifest.  As all the conjunction of good with truth at first apparently proceeds from exteriors to interiors in order, and at last to inmosts, therefore it is here said the affection of interior truth, for the affection itself which is of truth, flows in from good. The conjunction of good with the affection of internal truth takes place for the first time when the good of the natural is being conjoined with rational truth, and through this with rational good. This conjunction is represented by Jacob after the birth of his twelve sons, when he returned to the house of his mother and father, concerning which hereafter. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="3849.">3849.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be to her for a handmaid. That this signifies the exterior affections, which are the bonds or subservient means, is evident from what was said above (n. 3835). The reason why by "Bilhah" the handmaid of Rachel are signified exterior affections; and by "Zilpah" the handmaid of Leah, external affections, is that by Rachel is represented the affection of internal truth, and by Leah the affection of external truth. Exterior affections are natural affections which are subservient to internal ones. The reason why these exterior affections are means serviceable to the conjunction of truth with good, is that nothing which is of doctrine, and indeed nothing which is of memory-knowledge, can enter into man, save by means of affections; for in affections there is life, but not in the truths of doctrine and of memory-knowledge without affections. That this is the case is very plain; for a man cannot even think, nor so much as utter a syllable, without affection. He who pays attention to the matter will perceive that a voice without affection is like the voice of an automaton, and thus is but a lifeless sound; and that in proportion to the amount and the quality of the affection therein, such is the amount and the quality of the life in it. This shows what truths are without good; and that the affection is in the truths from the good. [2] He who pays attention may also know, from the nature of man's understanding, that it is no understanding unless the will is in it; the life of the understanding being from the will. This again shows what truths without good are, namely, that they are no truths at all; and that truths derive their life from good; for truths belong to man's intellectual part, and good to his will part. From all this anyone can judge what faith (which is of truth) is without charity, which is of good; and that the truths of faith without the good of charity are dead; for as before said the amount and the quality of the affection in truths, determine the amount and the quality of the life in them. But that truths nevertheless appear animated, even when there is no good of charity, is from the affections of the love of self and the love of the world, which have no life, except that which in the spiritual sense is called death, that is, infernal life. It is said affection, and thereby is meant that which is continuous of love. <a name="fr_109"></a><a href="#fn_109"><font size="1">3849-1</font></a>  [3] From all this we can see that affections are means subservient to the conjunction of truth with good; and that affections are what introduce truths, and also dispose them into order-genuine affections, which are of love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor, into heavenly order; but evil affections, which are of the love of self and the love of the world, into infernal order; that is, into the opposite of heavenly order. [4] The most external affections are those of the body, and are called appetites and pleasures; the next interior affections are those of the natural mind, and are called natural affections; but the internal affections are those of the rational mind, and are called spiritual affections. To these last-spiritual affections of the mind-doctrinal truths are introduced by means of exterior and most external, or natural and bodily affections. Hence these affections are subservient means, and are signified by the handmaids given by Laban to Rachel and to Leah. Their being called "Laban's" handmaids, signifies that they derived their origin from the good which is represented by Laban, which good has been described above. For the truths that are first learned cannot be at first insinuated by means of any other affections than these; genuine affections come in course of time, but not until the man acts from good. </p>

 <p>And he came also unto Rachel. That this signifies conjunction with the affection of internal truth, is evident from the signification of "coming to," as being to be conjoined; and from the representation of Rachel, as being the affection of internal truth; concerning which above. </p>
