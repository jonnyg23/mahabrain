 <p>Verses 11, 12. And Joseph made his father and his brethren dwell, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. And Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father's house, with bread, according to the mouth of the babe. "And Joseph made his father and his brethren dwell," signifies the life of spiritual good and of the truths of the church from the internal celestial; "and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land," signifies in the inmost of the natural mind where memory-knowledges are; "in the land of Rameses," signifies the inmost of the mind and its quality; "as Pharaoh had commanded," signifies with the consent of the natural where memory-knowledges are; "and Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father's house, with bread," signifies that from the internal celestial there was a continuous influx of good into spiritual good and the truths of the church in the natural, whence was their life; "according to the mouth of the babe," signifies each according to the quality of the good of innocence. </p>

 <p>And Joseph made his father and his brethren dwell. That this signifies the life of spiritual good and of the truths of the church from the internal celestial, is evident from the signification of "to dwell," as being life (n. 1293, 3384, 3613, 4451, 6051); from the representation of Israel, who is here the "father," as being spiritual good from the natural (n. 5801, 5803, 5807, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833); from the representation of his sons, who are here the "brethren," as being the truths of the church in the natural (n. 5414, 5879, 5951); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal celestial (n. 5869, 5877). From all which it is evident that by the words "Joseph made his father and his brethren dwell" is signified the life of spiritual good and of the truths of the church from the internal celestial. </p>

 <p>And gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land. That this signifies in the inmost of the natural mind where memory-knowledges are, is evident from the signification of a "possession," as being the residence of the spiritual life (see n. 2658); from the signification of the "land of Egypt," as being the natural mind where memory-knowledges are (n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301); and from the signification of "the best of the land," as being the inmost (of which above, see n. 6084). Hence it is plain that by the words "and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land" is signified the residence of spiritual life in the inmost of the natural mind where memory-knowledges are. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6104.">6104.</a></font></span>
 <p>In the land of Rameses. That this signifies the inmost of the mind and its quality, is evident from the fact that all the names in the Word, both of persons and of places, signify things (see n. 1888, 3422, 4298, 4442, 5095, 5225); and as the "land of Goshen" denotes the inmost of the natural mind (n. 5910, 6028, 6031, 6068), therefore "Rameses," which was the best tract of land in the land of Goshen, denotes the inmost of what is spiritual in the natural mind. But the nature of this inmost can scarcely be comprehended by man, for it contains innumerable and also ineffable things, which can only be seen in the light of heaven, thus by angels; as is the case with the rest of the names, of both places and persons, which occur in the word. </p>

 <p>As Pharaoh had commanded. That this signifies with the consent of the natural where memory-knowledges are, is evident from the signification of "commanding," as being influx (see n. 5486, 5732), but here consent, because the natural which is represented by Pharaoh has all that belongs to it by influx from the internal; and therefore that which the natural commands, does indeed appear like a command from it, but it is really from the internal; thus it is consent. Relatively to the internal, man's natural is almost like his speech relatively to his thought; for it appears as if the speech of man commands or gives orders, but it is the thought. </p>

 <p>And Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father's house, with bread. That this signifies that from the internal celestial there was a continuous influx of good into spiritual good and the truths of the church in the natural, whence was their life, is evident from the signification of "sustaining with bread," as being the influx of good; for "to sustain" here denotes to continually flow in, whence man has spiritual life, and "bread" is the good of love (see n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 5915); from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal celestial (n. 5869, 5877); from the representation of Israel, who is here the "father," as being spiritual good from the natural; from the representation of his sons, who are here the "brethren," as being the truths of the church in the natural (of which above, n. 6102); and from the signification of "all his father's house," as being all in one complex that is of spiritual good and from this good. Hence it is plain that by "Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father's house, with bread," is signified the continuous influx of the good of love from the internal celestial into spiritual good and the truths of the church in the natural, and into all things that are of spiritual good and from it. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6107.">6107.</a></font></span>
 <p>According to the mouth of the babe. That this signifies each according to the quality of the good of innocence, is evident from the signification of "according to the mouth," as being each, and according to quality; and from the signification of "babe," as being the good of innocence (see n. 430, 2126, 3183, 5608). In regard to influx from the internal celestial into spiritual good and into the truths of the church in the natural according to the quality of the good of innocence, the case is this. Innocence is that from the inmost which qualifies all the good of charity and of love. For the Lord flows in through innocence into charity, and in proportion to the innocence, such is the reception of charity; for innocence is the very essential of charity (n. 2780, 3111, 3183, 3994, 4797, 6013). The nature of innocence may be seen as in a mirror from little children, in that they love their parents and trust in them alone, having no care but to please them; and accordingly they have food and clothing not merely for their needs, but also for their delight; and as they love their parents, they do with the delight of affection whatever is agreeable to them, thus not only what they command, but also what they suppose them to wish to command, and moreover have no self-regard whatever; not to mention many other characteristics of infancy. But be it known that the innocence of little children is not innocence, but only its semblance. Real innocence dwells solely in wisdom (n. 2305, 2306, 3494, 4797), and wisdom consists in bearing oneself toward the Lord, from the good of love and of faith, as do little children toward their parents in the way just stated. </p>

 <p>Verses 13-26. And there was no bread in all the land, because the famine was very grievous, and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan labored by reason of the famine. And Joseph gathered together all the silver that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the produce which they bought; and Joseph brought the silver into Pharaoh's house. And when the silver was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all Egypt came unto Joseph, saying, Give us bread; for why should we die beside thee because the silver faileth? And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if silver fail. And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread [in exchange] for the horses, and for the cattle of the flock, and for the cattle of the herd, and for the asses; and he provided them with bread [in exchange] for all their cattle in this year. And when this year was ended, they came unto him in the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord how that the silver is spent; and the cattle of the beast is to my lord; there is naught left before my lord, besides our body, and our ground: wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our ground? buy us and our ground for bread, and we shall live, and our ground, servants to Pharaoh; and give seed, that we may live, and not die, and the ground be not laid waste. And Joseph bought all the ground of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold everyone his field, because the famine grew strong upon them; and the land was Pharaoh's. And as for the people, he removed it to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof. Only the ground of the priests bought he not; because a portion was appointed for the priests by Pharaoh, and they ate their appointed portion which Pharaoh had given them; wherefore they sold not their ground. And Joseph said unto the people, Behold I have bought you this day and your ground for Pharaoh; lo here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the ground. And it shall be in the ingatherings that ye shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be for you, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them in your houses, and for food for your babes. And they said, Thou hast made us live; let us find grace in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants. And Joseph made it a statute even unto this day, concerning the ground of Egypt, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the ground of the priests, only theirs, was not Pharaoh's. "And there was no bread in all the land," signifies that good no longer appeared; "because  the famine was very grievous," signifies desolation; "and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan labored by reason of the famine," signifies that this was in the natural and within the church; "and Joseph gathered together all the silver," signifies all true and adaptable memory-knowledge; "that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan," signifies that was in the natural and in the church; "for the produce which they bought," signifies that thereby they were sustained; "and Joseph brought the silver into Pharaoh's house," signifies that it was all brought into relation to what is general in the natural; "and when the silver was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan," signifies that on account of the desolation, true and adaptable memory-knowledge was no longer to be seen in the natural and within the church; "all Egypt came unto Joseph," signifies application to the internal; "saying, Give us bread," signifies an entreaty concerning the sustenance of the spiritual life; "for why should we die beside thee because silver faileth?" signifies that otherwise by reason of the lack of truth there would be spiritual death; "and Joseph said," signifies the internal from which is the answer; "Give your cattle, and I will give you [in exchange] for your cattle," signifies that they should bring forward the goods of truth, and they would be sustained; "if silver fail," signifies if truth is no longer visible to them; "and they brought their cattle unto Joseph," signifies the goods of truth, that they were brought forward; "and Joseph gave them bread," signifies sustenance in respect to the spiritual life; "[in exchange] for the horses," signifies memory-knowledges from the intellectual; "and for the cattle of the flock, and for the cattle of the herd," signifies interior and exterior goods of truth; "and for the asses," signifies things of service; "and he provided them with bread [in exchange] for all their cattle," signifies sustenance through the influx of good from the internal; "in this year," signifies the period of this state; "and when this year was ended," signifies desolation after the period of this state; "they came unto him in the second year," signifies the beginning of the following state; "and said to him, We will not hide from my lord," signifies a perception that it was known to the internal; "how that the silver is spent," signifies truth not visible on account of the desolation; "and the cattle of the beast is to my lord," signifies the good of truth in like manner; "there is nought left before my lord, besides our body and our ground," signifies that the receptacles of good and truth were completely desolated; "wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our ground?" signifies that if they should be desolated there would no longer be spiritual life under the internal; "buy us and our ground for bread," signifies the appropriation of both receptacles, that they may be sustained with good; "and we shall live, and our ground, servants to Pharaoh," signifies total submission; "and give seed," signifies in this way an influx of the good of charity and of the truth of faith; "that we may live and not die," signifies spiritual life from this source, and no longer any fear of damnation; "and the ground be not laid waste," signifies that the mind must be cultivated with the memory-knowledges of the church; "and Joseph bought all the ground of Egypt for Pharaoh," signifies that the internal appropriated to itself the whole natural mind where memory-knowledges are, and placed it under general auspices; "for the Egyptians sold every one his field," signifies the renunciation and subjection of all things which are of service to the church; "because the famine grew strong upon them," signifies because there was desolation even to despair; "and the land was Pharaoh's," signifies that all things were subjected to the natural that was under the auspices of the internal; "and as for the people he removed it to the cities," signifies that truths of memory-knowledge were referred to doctrinal things; "from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof," signifies extension through the whole natural where memory-knowledges are; "only the ground of the priests bought he not," signifies that the internal procured for itself from the natural capacities to receive good, because these are from itself; "because a portion was appointed for the priests by Pharaoh," signifies that it was set in order by the natural that was under the auspices of the internal; "and they ate their appointed portion which Pharaoh had given them," signifies that goods did not appropriate to themselves more than was according to the setting in order; "wherefore they sold not their ground," signifies that for this reason they had no need to renounce and submit them; "and Joseph said unto the people," signifies the influx of the internal into the truths of memory-knowledge; "Behold I have bought you this day and your ground for Pharaoh," signifies that it procured these for itself, and made them subject to the general in the natural that was under the auspices of the internal; "lo here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the ground," signifies the good of charity and the truth of faith that were to be implanted; "and it shall be in the ingatherings," signifies the fruits thence derived; "that ye shall give a fifth to Pharaoh," signifies remains, that these are for the general in the natural that is under the auspices of the internal; "and four parts shall be for you," signifies those things which were not yet remains; "for seed of the field," signifies for the nourishment of the mind; "and for your food, and for them in your houses," signifies that thereby the good of truth may be in each and all things; "and for food for your babes," signifies in those things which are of innocence; "and they said, Thou hast made us live," signifies spiritual life in no other manner and from no other source; "let us find grace in the eyes of my lord," signifies the will that in this way they be made subject, and humiliation; "and we will be Pharaoh's servants," signifies that they renounce their own, and submit to the natural that is under the auspices of the internal; "and Joseph made it a statute," signifies what is concluded from consent; "even unto this day," signifies eternally; "concerning the ground of Egypt, that Pharaoh should have the fifth," signifies remains, as before; "only the ground of the priests, only theirs, was not Pharaoh's," signifies capacities to receive good, that these are immediately from the internal. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6109.">6109.</a></font></span>
 <p>And there was no bread in all the land. That this signifies that good no longer appeared, is evident from the signification of "bread," as being the good of love and of charity (of which just above, n. 6106); and from the signification of there "being none in all the land," as being that it no longer appeared. In what now follows, the internal celestial is treated of, that it reduced all things in the natural into order under a general principle, to the end that there might be effected a conjunction of memory-knowledges with the truths of the church, and through these truths with spiritual good, and through this good with the internal celestial. But as the reduction of memory-knowledges into order under a general principle cannot be effected otherwise than through vastations of good and desolations of truth, and, soon afterward, through the giving of sustenance; therefore in what now follows, all these things are treated of in the internal sense. But for many reasons these things rarely take place with a man during his life in this world; whereas in the other life they take place with all who are being regenerated. And as they do not take place with man in this world, it is no wonder if they appear to him as things unknown, and seem to him like secret things never before heard of. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6110.">6110.</a></font></span>
 <p>Because the famine was very grievous. That this signifies desolation, is evident from the signification of "famine," as being a lack of good and of knowledges (see n. 1460, 3364, 5277, 5279, 5281, 5300, 5579, 5893); thus a "very grievous famine" denotes desolation (n. 5360, 5376, 5415, 5576). With regard to desolation, be it known that truths and goods and the knowledges thereof make the spiritual life of those who are in heaven, for these are the celestial and spiritual foods with which they are nourished. These foods are given them daily by the Lord. When it is morning with them, goods are supplied; when it is noon, truths are supplied; but when it is evening, goods and truths are lacking, and this even unto twilight and the return of morning. The angels are then kept in a state of appetite, which is of such a nature that they long for these things more than those who are hungry on earth long for food. This state is signified by "famine," and it is a kind of desolation, but not such as exists with those who are in the lower earth (n. 698, 699, 1106-1113). [2] Scarcely anyone in this world can believe that the angelic heaven has such an appetite for truths and goods and the knowledges of these; for they who are intent on nothing else than gain and glory and indulgence in pleasures, will wonder that such things are a matter of life to the angels, and will say, "What are knowledges of good and of truth to me? what have these to do with life? The things which give life and the delight of life are riches, honors, and pleasures." But be it known to them that the life which is from these things is the life of the body, and not the life of the soul, and that the former life perishes with the body, but the latter remains to eternity; and that they consult their own evil who during their abode in this world think nothing about the spiritual life. [3] As further regards desolation, it is for the sake of inducing appetite, for goods and truths are received in accordance with this; and when the desires excited by appetite are obtained, they cause satisfaction and happiness. Wherefore in the other life they who are in desolation are soon afterward refreshed, and attain their desires. By means of such alternations are all made perfect. It is worthy of note that the alternations of the day in the natural world-morning, midday, evening, night, and again morning-perfectly represent the alternations in the spiritual world, with only this difference: that the alternations of the spiritual world flow into the understanding and the will, and sustain those things which are of the life; while the alternations in the natural world flow into those things which are of the body, and sustain them. [4] What is still more worthy of note is that the shades of evening and the darkness of night do not come from the Lord, but from things that belong to angels, spirits, and men. For the Lord as a Sun is continually shining and flowing in, but evils and falsities from what is one's own, being in men, spirits, and angels, turn and convert them from the Lord, and thus lead them into the shades of evening, and those who are evil into the darkness of night; in like manner as the sun of our world is continually shining and inflowing, but the earth by its rotation turns itself away from it, and brings itself into shade and darkness. [5] The reason why these alternations take place in the natural world is that the natural world comes forth from the spiritual world, and therefore also subsists from it; and hence it is that universal nature is a theater representative of the Lord's kingdom (see n. 3483, 4939). The reason why these alternations exist in the spiritual world is that all who are in heaven may be continually perfected. From this there are such alternations also in the natural world, for otherwise all things therein would perish with drought. [6] Yet be it known that in heaven there is no night, but only evening, which is succeeded by the twilight that precedes the morning. But in hell there is night. There are alternations there also, but these are opposite to the alternations in heaven; for in hell morning is the heat of cupidities, noon is the itching of falsities, evening is anxiety, and night is torment. Yet through all these alternations the night dominates, and it is only the variations of shade and of the darkness of night that present these alternations. [7] Be it further known that in the spiritual world the alternations with one person are not like those with another; and also that the alternations there are not distinguished into stated times, because it is the variations of state that present them to view; for in place of times in the natural world there are states in the spiritual world (n. 1274, 1382, 2625, 2788, 2837, 3254, 3356, 4814, 4882, 4901, 4916). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6111.">6111.</a></font></span>
 <p>And the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan labored by reason of the famine. That this signifies that this was in the natural where memory-knowledges are, and within the church, is evident from the signification of the "land of Egypt," as being the natural mind where memory-knowledges are (n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301); from the signification of the "land of Canaan," as being the church (of which above, see n. 6067); and from the signification of "famine," as being desolation (as just above, n. 6110). Hence it is evident that by the words "the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan labored by reason of the famine" is signified that there was desolation in the natural where memory-knowledges are, and within the church. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6112.">6112.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Joseph gathered together all the silver. That this signifies all true and adaptable memory-knowledge, is evident from the signification of "gathering together," as being to bring together into a one; from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal celestial (of which often above); and from the signification of "silver," as being truth (see n. 1551, 2954, 5658), but here true and adaptable memory-knowledge, for it is said of the silver in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, as presently follows. Hence it is that by "Joseph gathered together all the silver" is signified that the internal celestial brought together into a one all the true and adaptable memory-knowledge. A memory-knowledge is said to be true and adaptable that has not been darkened by fallacies, which, so long as they cannot be dispelled, render the memory-knowledge unadaptable; and so also is a memory-knowledge which has not become perverted by applications to falsities and to evils by others or by oneself, for when these have once been impressed on any memory-knowledge, they remain. Therefore all memory-knowledge that is free from such vitiations, is true and adaptable memory-knowledge. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6113.">6113.</a></font></span>
 <p>That was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan. That this signifies that was in the natural and in the church, is evident from the signification of the "land of Egypt," as being the natural where memory-knowledges are (of which above, n. 6111); and from the signification of the "land of Canaan," as being the church (of which also above, n. 6067). By the church is here meant that which is of the church with man, for man is a church when he is in good and truth, and an assemblage of such men makes the church in general. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6114.">6114.</a></font></span>
 <p>For the produce which they bought. That this signifies that thereby they were sustained, is evident from the signification of "produce," as being the truth of the church (n. 5402); and from the signification of "buying," as being to appropriate (see n. 4397, 5374, 5397, 5406, 5410, 5426). Thus the signification is, to be sustained, for the subject treated of is the spiritual food which is signified by "produce," which food when appropriated sustains the spiritual life. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6115.">6115.</a></font></span>
 <p>And Joseph brought the silver into Pharaoh's house. That this signifies that it was all brought into relation to what is general in the natural, is evident from the signification of "bringing into," as being to bring into relation and to introduce; from the signification of "silver," as being true and adaptable memory-knowledge (see n. 6112); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the natural in general (see n. 5160, 5799, 6015); thus the "house of Pharaoh" is what is general in the natural, because it is everything therein in the complex. [2] In regard to true and adaptable memory-knowledges being brought into relation to what is general, be it known that in order to be anything, all memory-knowledges and also all truths whatsoever, must be brought into relation to their generals, and must be placed and contained in and under a general, as otherwise they are at once dissipated. For in order that memory-knowledges and truths may be anything, they must be brought into a form in which they shall mutually regard each other, which cannot be effected unless they are consociated under a general; and therefore it is this general which holds them together in form, and causes that each constituent therein may have its own quality. The general itself, together with other generals, must also be brought into relation under things more general; and the more general things again, under the most general; for otherwise the general things, and likewise the more general things, would be dissipated. [3] The most general universal, by virtue of which all things are held together, is the Lord Himself, and that which holds together is the Divine truth proceeding from Him. The more general things are the general societies in the spiritual world, into which the Divine truth flows and distinguishes them in kind from one another. The general things are the societies less general under each more general society. The more general societies are those to which the members, organs, and viscera in man correspond, which by a wonderful connection are in such a form that they mutually regard each other, and thus mutually hold each other together, and also present themselves as a one. In man, the most general universal, which holds the single things together, is the soul; thus also it is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, for this is continually flowing in and causing the soul to be such as it is. [4] The Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is what is called the "Word through which all things were created" (John 1:1-3), or through which all things have come into existence, consequently through which all things subsist. That all things in the universal natural world are under a general, and each thing under its own general; and that otherwise they cannot subsist, will be plainly discerned by him who is willing to pay attention to the things in nature. </p>

 <p>And when the silver was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan. That this signifies that on account of the desolation, true and adaptable memory-knowledge was no longer to be seen in the natural and within the church, is evident from the signification of "being all spent," as being to be no longer visible; from the signification of "silver," as being true and adaptable memory-knowledge (of which above, n. 6112); from the signification of the "land of Egypt," as being the natural where memory-knowledges are (of which above, n. 6111); and from the signification of the "land of Canaan," as being the church (of which also above, n. 6067). That it was on account of the desolation, is evident from what goes before (n. 6110). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6117.">6117.</a></font></span>
 <p>And all Egypt came unto Joseph. That this signifies application to the internal, is evident from the signification of "coming unto him," as being to be applied; from the signification of "Egypt," as being knowledge (of which above); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal (of which also above). That all the memory-knowledge in the natural was under the auspices of the internal, is signified by Joseph's being ruler over all the land of Egypt. But the conjunction of the truths of the church with the memory-knowledges in the natural is what is now described in the internal sense. </p>

 <p>Saying, Give us bread. That this signifies an entreaty concerning the support of the spiritual life, is evident from the signification of "giving," when predicated of bread, as being to sustain; and from the signification of "bread," as being spiritual life. For by "bread" is specifically signified the good of love and of charity, but in general spiritual life, for in this case by "bread" is meant all food (as shown above, see n. 2165); and when all food in general is meant, spiritual life is meant, for in the spiritual sense food in general is all the good of love and also all the truth of faith, and these two are what make spiritual life. </p>

 <p>For why should we die beside thee because the silver faileth? That this signifies that otherwise by reason of the lack of truth there would be spiritual death, is evident from the signification of "dying," as being spiritual death (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "silver failing," as being a lack of truth (that "silver" denotes true and adaptable memory-knowledge may be seen above, n. 6112). In regard to the fact that there is spiritual death when there is a lack of truth, the case is this. Spiritual life consists in activities according to truths, consequently in uses; for they who are in spiritual life have an appetite and a longing for truths with a view to life, that is, that they may live according to them, thus with a view to uses. So far therefore as they are able to receive truths in accordance with which uses may be done, so far they are in spiritual life, because so far they are in the light of intelligence and of wisdom. When therefore truths fail, as is the case when a state of shade comes, which is signified in the Word by "evening" (n. 6110), the spiritual life labors; for such things present themselves as belong to shade, that is, to spiritual death; for in this case they are not as before kept in the light, but are in part let back into their own; and hence there arises from the shade an image of spiritual death, that is, of damnation. [2] That by "death" is signified spiritual death, or damnation, is evident from very many passages in the Word, of which it will suffice to adduce the following. In Isaiah:      In righteousness He shall judge the poor, and reprove with rectitude the wretched of the earth. But He shall smite the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips shall He cause the wicked to die (Isa. 11:4);  speaking of the Lord. The "rod of His mouth," and the "breath of His lips," denote the Divine truth from which is judgment; "to die" denotes to be damned. Again:      He will swallow up death eternally; and the Lord Jehovih will wipe away the tear from upon all faces (Isa. 25:8). Again:      The dead shall not live; the Rephaim shall not rise; because Thou hast visited, Thou hast extinguished them (Isa. 26:14). Again:      Thy dead shall live, my carcass, they shall arise (Isa. 26:19). Again:      Ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell have we made a vision; your covenant with death shall be abolished, and your vision with hell shall not stand (Isa. 28:15, 18). [3] In Jeremiah:      Ye wait for the light, but He turns it into the shadow of death, He makes it thick darkness (Jer. 13:16). In Ezekiel:      Ye have profaned Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to make the souls live that should not live (Ezek. 13:19).  In Hosea:      I will redeem them from the hand of hell; from death I will deliver them; O death, I will be thy pests; O hell, I will be thy destruction (Hos. 13:14). In David:      Thou liftest me up from the gates of death (Ps. 9:13). Again:      Enlighten mine eyes, lest perchance I sleep death (Ps. 13:3). Again:      The cords of death compassed me, and the cords of hell (Ps. 18:4, 5). Again:      They shall be set as a flock in hell; death shall pasture them (Ps. 49:14). In John:      I have the keys of hell and of death (Rev. 1:18). Again:      He that overcometh shall not be hurt in the second death (Rev. 2:11). [4] Again:      I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, but thou art dead. Be thou watchful, and establish the things that remain, which are ready to die (Rev. 3:1, 2). In Matthew:      The people that sitteth in darkness saw a great light; and to them that sit in the region and shadow of death, to them light hath arisen (Matt. 4:16). In John:      He that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, shall have eternal life, and shall not come into judgment, but hath passed from death unto life (John 5:24). Again:      I go away, and ye shall seek Me, but ye shall die in your sin. I said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins; for unless ye believe that I am, ye shall die in your sins. If anyone shall keep My word, he shall never see death (John 8:21, 24, 51, 52). As "death" signified damnation, the people of the representative church were forbidden to touch the dead, and if they touched they were unclean, and were to be cleansed (Ezek. 44:25; Lev. 15:31; 21:1, 2; 22:8; Num. 6:6-12; 19:11 to the end). </p>

 <p>Give your cattle; and I will give you [in exchange] for your cattle. That this signifies that they should bring forward the goods of truth and they would be sustained, is evident from the signification of "cattle," as being the goods of truth (n. 6016, 6045); and from the signification of "giving [in exchange] for them," namely, bread, as being the sustenance of the spiritual life (of which above, see n. 6118). </p>

 <p>If silver fail. That this signifies if truth is no longer visible to them, is evident from the signification of "silver failing," as being a lack of truth, thus that truth is no longer visible (of which above, n. 6116, 6119). Truth is said to be not visible, because in a state of desolation truth appears as if it had fled away. Yet it is present, for all the truth and good which have at any time been given by the Lord to man, spirit, and angel, remain, and nothing of them is taken away; but in a state of desolation they are obscured by what is their own, so as not to appear; but when a state of light returns, they become present and visible. From this it is plain what is meant by truth not being visible. </p>

 <p>And they brought their cattle unto Joseph. That this signifies the goods of truth, that they were brought forward, is evident from the signification of "bringing," as being to be brought forward; and from the signification of "cattle," as being the goods of truth (see n. 6016, 6045). </p>

 <p>[In exchange] for the horses. That this signifies memory-knowledges from the intellectual, is evident from the signification of "horses," as being things intellectual (n. 2760-2762, 3217, 5321); and because they are predicated of Egypt, by which are signified memory-knowledges, "horses" here denote memory-knowledges from the intellectual. It is here necessary to state what these memory-knowledges from the intellectual are. Man has an intellectual, and he has a will, and this not only in his internal man, but also in his external. The intellectual in a man grows and increases from his infancy to his maturity, and consists in viewing things from what belongs to experience and to memory-knowledge; and also in viewing causes from effects; and in viewing consequences in connection with their causes. Thus the intellectual consists in the comprehension and perception of such things as are of civic and moral life. It comes into existence from the influx of light from heaven; and therefore every man can be perfected in respect to the intellectual. The intellectual is given to everyone according to his application, according to his life, and according to his nature; nor is it lacking in anyone, provided he is of sound mind. It is given to man to the end that he may be in freedom and in choice, that is, in the freedom of choosing good or evil. Unless man has such an intellectual as has been described, he cannot do this of himself, thus neither could anything be appropriated to him. [2] Be it known further, that it is man's intellectual which receives what is spiritual, so as to be a recipient of spiritual truth and good. For nothing of good, that is, of charity, and nothing of truth, that is, of faith, can be insinuated into anyone who has not an intellectual, but they are insinuated according to his intellectual; and therefore also man is not regenerated by the Lord until in adult age and possessed of an intellectual, before which period the good of love and truth of faith fall as seed into ground that is quite barren. But when a man has been regenerated, his intellectual performs the use of seeing and perceiving what is good, and thereby what is true; for the intellectual carries over those things which are of the light of heaven into those which are of the light of nature, whereby the former appear in the latter as do the interior affections of man in a face free from pretence; and as the intellectual performs this use, therefore in the Word, in many passages where the spiritual of the church is treated of, its intellectual also is treated of, as of the Lord's Divine mercy shall be shown elsewhere. [3] From all this it is now evident what is meant by memory-knowledges from the intellectual, namely, that they are memory-knowledges which confirm those things that a man intellectually apprehends and perceives, whether these are evil or good. These memory-knowledges are signified in the Word by "horses from Egypt;" as in Isaiah:      Woe to them that go down into Egypt for help, and lean on horses; and trust on the chariot, because they are many, and upon the horsemen, because they are very strong; and they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, and seek not Jehovah. For Egypt is man, and not God; and his horses flesh, and not spirit (Isa. 31:1, 3); where "horses from Egypt" denote memory-knowledges from a perverted intellectual. [4] In Ezekiel:      He rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that it might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth this? (Ezek. 17:15); where also "horses from Egypt" denote memory-knowledges from a perverted intellectual, which are consulted in matters of faith, while the Word, that is, the Lord, is not believed except from these; thus it is not believed at all, for denial reigns in a perverted intellectual. [5] That such memory-knowledges were destroyed is represented by the horses and chariots of Pharaoh being drowned in the sea Suph; and because these knowledges are signified by "horses," and false doctrinal things by "chariots," therefore "horses and chariots" are so often mentioned in the Word (see Exod. 14:17, 18, 23, 26, 28; and thereafter in the Song of Moses and Miriam):      The horse of Pharaoh went in, and also his chariot, and also his horsemen, into the sea; but Jehovah caused the waters of the sea to return upon them. Sing ye to Jehovah, for exalting He hath exalted Himself; the horse and his rider hath He cast into the sea (Exod. 15:19, 21). [6] Similar memory-knowledges are also signified by what was prescribed in Moses for the king over Israel:      If they desire a king, a king from the midst of the brethren shall be set over them; only he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor bring back the people into Egypt in order that he may multiply horses (Deut. 17:15, 16); a king represented the Lord as to Divine truth (n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581, 4789, 4966, 5044, 5068), thus as to intelligence, for this when genuine is from Divine truth. That intelligence ought to be procured by means of the Word, which is Divine truth, and not by means of memory-knowledges from one's own intellectual, is signified by the injunction that the king "should not multiply horses, and should not bring back the people into Egypt in order that he may multiply horses." </p>

 <p>And for the cattle of the flock, and for the cattle of the herd. That this signifies the interior and exterior goods of truth, is evident from the signification of "flock," as being interior goods, and from the signification of "herd," as being exterior goods (see n. 5913); and as it is the goods of truth that are signified, it is said "cattle of the flock, and cattle of the herd," "cattle" being the good of truth (see n. 6016, 6045, 6049). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6127.">6127.</a></font></span>

 <p>And he provided them with bread [in exchange] for all their cattle. That this signifies sustenance through the influx of good from the internal, is evident from the signification of "providing with bread," or giving them bread, as being the sustenance of the spiritual life (of which above, n. 6118); from the signification of "cattle," as being the good of truth (of which just above, n. 6126); and from the representation of Joseph who provided them, as being the internal (as also above). That it was through the influx of good from the internal, follows, because all the sustenance of spiritual life in the natural is effected by means of influx from the internal, that is, from the Lord through the internal. As mention is so frequently made of influx, and perhaps few know what is meant by influx, it is necessary to state what it is. The nature of influx may be seen from a comparison with such things as inflow in nature, as from the influx of heat from the sun into all things of the earth, whence comes vegetative life; and from the influx of light into the same, whence comes what is helpful to vegetative life, and besides is the source of the consequent colors and beauties; in like manner from the influx of heat into the surface of our bodies, and also of light into the eye; in like manner from the influx of sound into the ear; and so on. From this it may be comprehended what is the influx of life from the Lord, who is the Sun of heaven, from whom comes the heat which is love, and the spiritual light which is faith. Moreover the influx itself is plainly felt; for heavenly heat, which is love, causes the vital heat which is in man; and heavenly light, which is faith, causes the intellectual light which is in man; but these are varied according to the reception. </p>

 <p>And said to him, We will not hide from my lord. That this signifies that it was known to the internal, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being perception (of which above, n. 6063); from the representation of Joseph, who is here the "lord," as being the internal (of which also above); and from the signification of "not hiding it from him," as being to be known. That in the internal sense "not to hide" denotes to be known, is because everything that comes forth and takes place in the natural is known to the internal, for the natural has from the internal all that belongs to itself, and therefore nothing can be concealed from the internal. Nevertheless in the external sense, and especially in the historical sense, the present form of speech is made use of; just as when the Lord speaks to a man He first questions him concerning the matter in hand, although it is fully known to Him; as for instance when the angel of Jehovah spake unto Hagar (Gen. 16:7, 8); unto Abraham (Gen. 18:9); and unto Moses (Exod. 4:2); and indeed in no other way would the external feel satisfied, for unless it utters a thing, it believes that it is not known. </p>

 <p>And the cattle of the beast is to my lord. That this signifies the good of truth in like manner, is evident from the signification of the "cattle of the beast," or of the "cattle of the flock and of the herd," as being the interior and exterior good of truth (of which above, n. 6126). That this in like manner was no longer visible on account of the desolation, is plain from what was said just above concerning the silver (n. 6133). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6135.">6135.</a></font></span>
 <p>There is naught left before my lord besides our body and our ground. That this signifies that the receptacles of good and truth were completely desolated, is evident from the signification of "body," as being a receptacle of good (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "ground," as being a receptacle of truth. That "ground" denotes a receptacle of truth is because it receives seeds, and by the seeds that are sown in it are specifically signified those things which are of faith from charity, thus which are of truth from good (see n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 1940, 2848, 3038, 3310, 3373); hence "ground" denotes a receptacle of truth, as may be seen from what has before been said and shown concerning "ground" (n. 566, 1068, 3671). That these receptacles were desolated is signified by there being "naught left before my lord besides." [2] In the genuine sense "body" signifies the good which is of love, and "ground" the truth which is of faith; but when the truths and goods of truth which are signified by "silver" and "cattle" are no longer visible on account of the desolation, then by "body" is signified only a receptacle of good, and by "ground" only a receptacle of truth. That in the genuine sense "body" signifies the good which is of love, is because the body, or the whole man which is meant by the "body," is a receptacle of life from the Lord, thus a receptacle of good; for the good of love makes the life itself in man, because the vital heat, which is love, is the vital heat itself; and unless this heat is in a man, he is a dead thing. Therefore it is that by the "body" in the internal sense is meant the good of love. And even if a man has no heavenly love, but only infernal love, still the inmost of his life is from heavenly love, for this love continually flows in from the Lord and effects in him vital heat in its beginning; but in its progress it is perverted by the man, whence comes infernal love, from which there is an unclean heat. [3] That in the genuine sense "body" is the good of love, is very evident from the angels, for when they become present, love so pours out of them that you would believe them to be nothing but love, and this from their whole body, which also appears bright and shining from the light which is from the love; for the good of love is like a flame which emits from itself light, which is the truth of faith thence derived. This being the character of the angels in heaven, what must not the Lord Himself be, from whom the angels have everything of love, and whose Divine Love appears as a Sun from which the universal heaven has its light, and all who are therein have their heavenly heat, that is, their love, thus their life. It is the Lord's Divine Human which so appears, and from which all these things are. From this it is evident what is meant by the Lord's "body," namely, the Divine love, in like manner as by His "flesh" (see n. 3813). Moreover the Lord's very body when glorified, that is, made Divine, is nothing else. What else must we think about the Divine, which is infinite? [4] From all this it may be known that by the "body" in the Holy Supper nothing else is meant than the Lord's Divine love toward the universal human race, concerning which it is thus written in the Gospels:      Jesus taking the bread, and blessing, brake and gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My body (Matt. 26:26; Mark 14:22; Luke 22:19); "this is My body," He said of the bread, because by the "bread" also is signified the Divine love (n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 4735, 5915). [5] The Divine love is also signified by the Lord's "body" in John:      Jesus said, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. But He spake of the temple of His body (John 2:19, 21); the "temple of His body" is the Divine truth from the Divine good (that the "temple" is the Lord as to Divine truth, see above, n. 3720). And because His "body" in the supreme sense is the Divine good of the Lord's Divine love, therefore all who are in heaven are said to be "in the Lord's body." [6] That the Lord's "body" is the Divine good, is evident also from these words in Daniel:      I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz; his body also was like the tarshish, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet like the shining of burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude (Dan. 10:5, 6);  by the "gold of Uphaz with which the loins were girded," by the "appearance of lightning which was on his face," by the "torches of fire which his eyes presented," and by the "shining of brass which was of his arms and his feet," are signified the goods of love; that "gold" is the good of love, may be seen above (n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658), and also "fire" (n. 934, 4906, 5215), and because "fire" so also "lightning;" and that "brass" is the good of love and of charity in the natural (n. 425, 1551); by the "tarshish," like to which the rest of the body appeared, namely-the middle of the body between the head and the loins, is signified the good of charity and of faith, for the tarshish is a flashing precious stone. </p>

 <p>Wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our ground? That this signifies that if they should be desolated there would no longer be spiritual life under the internal, is evident from the signification of "before thine eyes," as being under the internal; for by Joseph, to whom these words were spoken, is represented the internal; from the signification of "both we and our ground," as being the receptacles of good and truth (as just above, n. 6135), thus the receptacles of spiritual life. These receptacles are said to "die" when there is not within anything of spiritual life; for by "dying" is signified desolation, that is, the privation of good and truth, which good and truth make spiritual life. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6137.">6137.</a></font></span>
 <p>Buy us and our ground for bread. That this signifies the appropriation of both receptacles that they may be sustained with good, is evident from the signification of "buying," as being appropriation (see n. 4397, 5374, 5397, 5406, 5410, 5426); from the signification of "us and our ground," as being the receptacles of good and truth (as above, n. 6135, 6136), thus both receptacles; and from the signification of, "for bread," as being sustenance from good. That "bread" is the good both of love and of faith, is because by it is meant also all food in general (n. 6118). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6138.">6138.</a></font></span>
 <p>And we shall live, and our ground, servants to Pharaoh. That this signifies total submission, is evident from the signification of "we and our ground," as being the receptacles of good and of truth (as just above, see n. 6135-6137); and from the signification of "servants," as being to be without freedom from man's own (see n. 5760, 5763), thus total submission. By receptacles are meant the very forms of men; for men are nothing else than forms receptive of life from the Lord, and these forms are such by inheritance and by actual life that they refuse to admit the spiritual life which is from the Lord. But when these receptacles have been so far renounced that they no longer have any freedom from the man's own, there is total submission. A man who is being regenerated is at last so far reduced by repeated alternations of desolation and sustenance that he no longer wills to be his own, but the Lord's; and when he has become the Lord's he comes into a state of such a nature that when he is left to self he grieves and is seized with anxiety; and when he is delivered from this state of self he returns into his happiness and bliss. In such a state are all the angels. [2] In order that He may make a man blessed and happy, the Lord wills a total submission, that is, that he be not partly his own and partly the Lord's, for then there are two lords, which no one can serve at the same time (Matt. 6:24). Total submission is also meant by the Lord's words in Matthew:      He that loveth father and mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he that loveth son and daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me (Matt. 10:37); where by "father and mother" are signified in general those things which are man's own from inheritance, and by "son and daughter" those things which are his own from actual life. Man's own is also signified by "soul" in John:      He that loveth his soul shall lose it; but he that hateth his soul in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. If anyone will minister to Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there shall also My servant be (John 12:25, 26). Total submission is also signified by the Lord's words in Matthew:      Another disciple said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. But Jesus said to him, Follow Me; and let the dead bury their dead (Matt. 8:21, 22). [3] That submission must be total is very evident from the first commandment of the church:      Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from all thy heart, and from all thy soul, and from all thy mind, and from all thy forces; this is the first commandment (Mark 12:30).  Thus because love to the Lord does not come from man, but from the Lord Himself, therefore all the heart, all the soul, all the mind, and all the forces, which are recipients, must be the Lord's, consequently submission must be total. Such is the submission which is here signified by the words "we shall live, and our ground, servants to Pharaoh," for by Pharaoh is represented the natural in general which is under the auspices of the internal celestial, in the supreme sense under the auspices of the Lord, who in this sense is "Joseph." </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6139.">6139.</a></font></span>
 <p>And give seed. That this signifies in this way an influx of the good of charity and of the truth of faith, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being the good of charity and the truth of faith (see n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 1940, 2848, 3038, 3310, 3373). That "to give" these is influx, is evident, because they come into man by influx from the Lord. </p>

 <p>That we may live, and not die. That this signifies spiritual life from this source and no longer any fear of damnation, is evident from the signification of "living," as being spiritual life (see n. 5890); and from the signification of "dying," as being damnation (n. 6119), here the fear of damnation; because in a state of desolation, when a man is being regenerated, there is no damnation, but fear of damnation. </p>

 <p>And the ground be not laid waste. That this signifies that the mind must be cultivated with the memory-knowledges of the church, is evident from the signification of the "ground," as being the receptacle of truth (see n. 6135-6137)-the receptacle itself being the mind, here the natural mind, because it is the ground of Egypt that is spoken of; and from the signification of "being laid waste," as being to be without truth that is visible; in the present case, without the memory-knowledges of the church, for by the "Egyptians" are signified the memory-knowledges of the church (n. 4749, 4964, 4966, 6004), which also are the truths of the natural. That the "land of Egypt" is the natural mind where memory-knowledges are, may be seen above (n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301); wherefore the "ground of Egypt" signifies this mind specifically. Therefore by "the ground not being laid waste" is signified that the mind must be cultivated with memory-knowledges. </p>

 <p>And Joseph bought all the ground of Egypt for Pharaoh. That this signifies that the internal appropriated to itself the whole natural mind where memory-knowledges are, and placed it under general auspices, is evident from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal (of which often above); from the signification of "buying," as being to appropriate to oneself (see n. 4397, 5374, 5406, 5410, 5426); from the signification of the "ground of Egypt," as being the natural mind where memory-knowledges are (as just above, n. 6141); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the natural in general (n. 5160, 5799, 6015). Thus that it was "for Pharaoh" denotes to place under general auspices in the natural. </p>

 <p>For the Egyptians sold everyone his field. That this signifies the renunciation and subjection of all things that are of service to the church, is evident from the signification of "selling," as being to alienate so as to be no longer one's own (see n. 4098, 4752, 4758, 5886), thus to renounce and to subject; and from the signification of "field," as being the doctrine of the church, and in a general sense, the church (n. 368, 2971, 3310, 3766). From this it is plain that by "the Egyptians sold everyone his field," is signified the renunciation and subjugation of all things that are of service to the church. </p>

 <p>Because the famine grew strong upon them. That this signifies because there was desolation even to despair, is evident from the signification of "famine," as being desolation in respect to those things which are of the church (n. 5415, 5576); and when the famine is said "to grow strong," it denotes despair (n. 5279), for the last of desolation is despair. There are many reasons why despair is the last of desolation and of temptation (see n. 5279, 5280), of which only these following may be adduced. Despair causes those who feel it to acknowledge in an effectual and feeling manner that there is nothing of truth and good from themselves, and that from themselves they are condemned; but that they are delivered from condemnation by the Lord; and that salvation flows in by means of truth and good. Despair also causes them to feel the happiness of life which is from the Lord; for when they come out of that state, they are like those who have been condemned to death, and are set free from prison. Moreover by means of desolations and temptations, states contrary to heavenly life are felt, the result of which is the implantation of a sense and perception of the satisfaction and happiness of heavenly life; for a sense and perception of what is satisfying and happy is impossible without comparison with the opposites. To the end therefore that full comparisons may be made, desolations and temptations are brought to their utmost, that is, to despair. </p>

 <p>And the land was Pharaoh's. That this signifies that all things were subjected to the natural that was under the auspices of the internal, is evident from the signification of "the land was Pharaoh's," as being the appropriation and subjection of all things which are signified by the "land;" and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the natural in general (see n. 5160, 5799, 6015), into which were brought the memory-knowledges which are signified by "Egypt" (n. 6115). That it is under the auspices of the internal, is because the whole natural, both in general and in part, as being under the auspices of the internal, is signified by Joseph's being ruler over all the land of Egypt, and also by his being set over Pharaoh's house (Gen. 41:40-43), as we read:      Joseph said unto his brethren, God hath set me for a father to Pharaoh, and for a lord to all his house, and I rule in all the land of Egypt (Gen. 45:3, 8). This is the reason why it is said of the natural that it is under the auspices of the internal. </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6146.">6146.</a></font></span>
 <p>And as for the people, he removed it to the cities. That this signifies that the truths of memory-knowledge were brought into relation to doctrinal things, is evident from the signification of the "people," as being truths (see n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 3581), here truths of memory-knowledge because they are predicated of the people of Egypt; and from the signification of "cities," as being doctrinal things (n. 402, 2449, 3216, 4492, 4493). Therefore "to remove the people to the cities," is to bring the truths of memory-knowledge into relation to doctrinal things. This follows from what goes before, namely, from this, that truths were brought into relation to what is general in the natural (n. 6115); for doctrinal things are the generals to which truths are brought into relation; because the doctrine of the church is divided into its heads, and each head is a general of the church. For this reason also the people was removed to the cities by Joseph, that thereby might be represented the relation of truths to generals, thus to doctrinal things. </p>

 <p>From one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof. That this signifies extension through the whole natural where memory-knowledges are, is evident from the meaning of the expression, "from one end of the border to the other end thereof," as being extension through the whole; and from the signification of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledge in the natural (of which often above), thus the natural where memory-knowledges are. For the natural is what contains, and memory-knowledges are what are contained. Thus by "Egypt" is signified both what contains and what is contained, that is, both the natural and the memory-knowledge. Wherefore also by "Pharaoh the king of Egypt," is signified the natural in general (n. 5160, 5799), and also memory-knowledge in general (n. 6015); and by the "land of Egypt," the natural mind (n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301). </p>

 <p>Only the ground of the priests bought he not. That this signifies that the internal procured for itself from the natural, capacities to receive good, because these are from itself, is evident from the representation of Joseph, of whom these things are said, as being the internal (of which above); from the signification of the "ground," as being the receptacle of truth (of which also above, n. 6135-6137), here the capacity to receive good, for capacity is receptibility, and this must be within it, in order that a receptacle may be a receptacle. This capacity comes from good, that is, through good from the Lord; for unless the good of love flowed in from the Lord, no man would have the capacity to receive either truth or good. It is the influx of good of love from the Lord which causes all things within man to be disposed for reception. That the capacity to receive good is from the natural, is signified by the ground being in Egypt, for by "Egypt" is signified the natural in respect to memory-knowledges (n. 6142). The internal sense as given above is further evident from the signification of "priests," as being good (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "not buying," as being not to appropriate to himself these capacities as he had appropriated to himself truths and the goods of truth with their receptacles (which was done by means of desolations and sustainings), for the reason that these capacities were from himself, that is, from the internal. Thus it is that by these words, "Only the ground of the priests bought he not" is signified that the internal procured for itself from the natural, capacities to receive good, because these are from itself. [2] The case herein is this. The capacities in man to receive truth and good are immediately from the Lord, nor does man render any aid in the procuring of them. For man is always kept in the capacity to receive good and truth, and from this capacity he has understanding and will; but a man's not receiving them is the result of his turning to evil: the capacity does indeed then remain, but the approach to the thought and feeling of them is closed against him; and therefore the capacity to see truth and feel good perishes in proportion as a man turns himself to evil and confirms himself therein in life and faith. That man contributes nothing whatever to the capacity to receive truth and good, is known from the doctrine of the church, that nothing of the truth of faith and nothing of the good of charity comes from man, but that all comes from the Lord. Nevertheless a man can destroy this capacity in himself. From this it may now be seen how it is to be understood that the internal procured for itself from the natural, capacities to receive good, because these are from itself. It is said "from the natural," because the influx of good from the Lord is effected by the Lord through the internal into the natural. When a capacity to receive has been acquired in the natural, then there is influx, for then there is reception (as may be seen above, n. 5828). [3] In regard to goods being signified by "priests," be it known that there are two things which proceed from the Lord, namely, good and truth. The Divine good was represented by priests, and the Divine truth by kings. Hence it is that by "priests" are signified goods, and by "kings" truths. (Concerning the priesthood and royalty which are predicated of the Lord, see n. 1728, 2015, 3670.) In the Ancient Representative Church the priesthood and the royalty were joined together in one person, because the good and truth which proceed from the Lord are united, and in heaven with the angels are also joined together. [4] The person in whom these two things in the Ancient Church were joined together was called "Melchizedek," or "King of Righteousness," as may be seen from the Melchizedek who came to Abraham, of whom it is thus written:      Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; and he was priest to God Most High; and he blessed Abraham (Gen. 14:18, 19). That he represented the Lord as to both is manifest from the fact that he was king and at the same time priest, and that he was allowed to bless Abraham and to offer him bread and wine, which at that time also were symbols of the good of love and the truth of faith. That Melchizedek represented the Lord as to both is further manifest from David:      Jehovah hath sworn and He will not repent, Thou art a priest eternally after the manner of Melchizedek (Ps. 110:4);  which was said of the Lord; "after the manner of Melchizedek" means that he was both king and priest, that is, in the supreme sense, that from Him proceed the Divine good and the Divine truth together. [5] Moreover as a representative church was instituted with the posterity of Jacob, therefore in one person conjointly was represented the Divine good and the Divine truth which proceed united from the Lord. But on account of the wars and of the idolatry of that people, these two offices were at first divided, and they who ruled over the people were called "leaders," and afterward "judges;" while they who officiated in holy things were called "priests," and were of the seed of Aaron, and Levites. Yet afterward these two offices were joined together in one person, as in Eli and in Samuel. But because the people were of such a character that a representative church could not be instituted among them, but only the representative of a church, by reason of the idolatrous disposition which prevailed among them, therefore it was permitted that the two offices should be separated, and that the Lord as to Divine truth should be represented by kings, and as to Divine good by priests. That this was done at the will of the people, and not of the Lord's good pleasure, is manifest from the word of Jehovah unto Samuel:      Obey the voice of the people in all that they shall say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them; and thou shalt show them the king's right (1 Sam. 8:7 to the end; 12:19, 20). [6] The reason why these two offices were not to be separated, was that the Divine truth separated from the Divine good condemns everyone; whereas the Divine truth united to the Divine good saves. For from the Divine truth man is condemned to hell, but by the Divine good he is taken out therefrom, and is elevated into heaven. Salvation is of mercy, thus from the Divine good; but damnation is when man refuses mercy, and thus rejects from himself the Divine good; wherefore he is left to judgment from truth. (That kings represented the Divine truth may be seen, n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581, 4966, 5044, 5068.) [7] That priests represented the Lord as to Divine good, and that from this they signify good, may be seen from all those things in the internal sense which were instituted with respect to the priesthood when Aaron was chosen, and afterward the Levites; as that the high priest alone should enter into the Holy of holies and there minister; that the holy things of Jehovah should be for the priest (Lev. 23:20; 27:21); that they should not have a portion and inheritance in the land, but that Jehovah should be their portion and inheritance (Num. 18:20; Deut. 10:9; 18:1); that the Levites were given to Jehovah instead of the firstborn, and that by Jehovah they were given to Aaron (Num. 3:9, 12, 13, 40, to the end; 8:16-19); that the high priest with the Levites should be in the midst of the camp when they pitched and when they set forward (Num. 1:50-54; 2:17; 3:23-38; 4:1 to the end); that no one of the seed of Aaron in whom was any blemish should come near to offer burnt-offerings and sacrifices (Lev. 21:17-21); besides many other things (see Lev. 21:9-13, and elsewhere). [8] All these things represented in the supreme sense the Divine good of the Lord, and thus in the relative sense the good which is of love and of charity. But the garments of Aaron, which were called the "garments of holiness," represented the Divine truth from the Divine good; concerning which garments of the Lord's Divine mercy more shall be said in the explications of what is written in Exodus. [9] As truth is signified by "kings," and good by "priests," therefore in the Word "kings and priests" are frequently mentioned together; as in Revelation:      Jesus Christ hath made us kings and priests to God and His Father (Rev. 1:5, 6; 5:10); "kings" are said to be "made" from the truth which is of faith, and "priests" from the good which is of charity. Thus with those who are in the Lord truth and good are joined together, as they are in heaven (as was said above), and this is meant by "being made kings and priests." [10] In Jeremiah:      It shall come to pass in that day that the heart of the king and of the princes shall perish; and the priests shall be amazed; and the prophets shall wonder (Jer. 4:9). Again:      The house of Israel are ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets (Jer. 2:26). Again:      The kings of Judah, the princes, the priests, and the prophets, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem (Jer. 8:1). In these passages "kings" denote truths; "princes," primary truths (n. 1482, 2089, 5044); "priests," goods; and "prophets," those who teach (n. 2534). [11] Be it known further that the fact of Joseph's not buying the ground of the priests was a representative that all capacity to receive truth and good is from the Lord, is evident from a similar law concerning the fields of the Levites in Moses:      The field of the suburbs of the cities of the Levites may not be sold; for it is their eternal possession (Lev. 25:34);  by this is meant in the internal sense that no man ought to claim for himself anything of the good of the church, which is the good of love and of charity, because this is from the Lord alone. </p>

 <p>Because a portion was appointed for the priests by Pharaoh. That this signifies that therefore it was set in order by the natural that was under the auspices of the internal, is evident from the signification of an "appointed portion," as being what is set in order; and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the natural in general (see n. 5160, 5799, 6015). And because this setting in order in the natural comes from the internal, it is added that it was under the auspices of the internal, which was also represented by Joseph's being lord over all Egypt, and also over Pharaoh's house (as may be seen above, n. 6145). </p>
 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="6150.">6150.</a></font></span>
 <p>And they ate their appointed portion which Pharaoh had given them. That this signifies that goods did not appropriate to themselves more than according to the setting in order, is evident from the signification of "eating," as being to appropriate to oneself (see n. 3168, 3513, 3596, 3832, 4745); and from the signification of "their appointed portion," as being that which is set in order (see n. 6149). Thus by "eating their appointed portion" is signified that goods did not appropriate to themselves more than according to the setting in order. That it was from the natural which is represented by Pharaoh, that is, in the natural under the auspices of the internal, may also be seen just above (n. 6149). </p>
