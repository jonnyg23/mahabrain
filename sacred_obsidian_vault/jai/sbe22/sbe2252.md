 <p>When a monk or a nun on a begging-tour perceives that many hungry animals have met and come together in search of food, e. g. those of the chicken-kind or those of the pig-kind, or that crows</p>  
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="green">p. 103</font></a></p>  
 <p>have met and come together, where an offering is thrown on the ground, they should, in case there be a byway, avoid them and not go on straight. (1)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not stand leaning against the door-post of the householder's abode, or his sink or spitting-pot, nor in sight of, or opposite to his bathroom or privy; nor should they contemplate a loophole or a mended spot or a fissure (of the house) or the bathing-house, showing in that direction with an arm or pointing with a finger, bowing up and down. (2)</p>  
 <p>Nor should they beg, pointing with a finger at the householder, or moving him with a finger, or threatening him with a finger, or scratching him with a finger, or praising him, or using coarse language. (3)</p>  
 <p>If he sees somebody eating, e<i>g</i>. the householder or his wife, &amp;c., he should after consideration say: 'O long-lived one! (or, O sister!) will you give me some of that food?' After these words the other might wash or wipe his hand or pot or spoon or plate with cold or hot water <a name="fr_354"></a><a href="#fn_348"><font size="1">1</font></a>. He should after consideration say: 'O long-lived one! (or, O sister!) do not wash or wipe your hand or pot or spoon or plate! If you want to give me something, give it as it is!' After these words the other might give him a share, having washed or wiped his hand, &amp;c., with cold or hot water. But he should not accept anything out of such a hand, &amp;c., which has been before treated thus; for it is impure and unacceptable. (4)</p>  
 <p>It is also to be known that food, &amp;c., is impure</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="green">p. 104</font></a></p>  
 <p>and unacceptable, which is given with a wet hand, though the hand be not purposely wetted. (5)</p>  
 <p>The same rule holds good with regard to a moistened hand, &amp;c., and a dusty hand, &amp;c., and a hand which is soiled with clay, dew, orpiment, vermilion, realgar, collyrium, white chalk, alum, rice-flour, kukkusa, ground drugs. (6)</p>  
 <p>It is also to be known that he may accept such food, &amp;c., which is given with a soiled hand, &amp;c., to one similarly soiled (i.e. with what one is to receive), or to one unsoiled, with hand similarly soiled; for such food, &amp;c., is pure and acceptable. (7)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept flattened grains, grains containing much chaff, &amp;c. (see II, 1, 1, § 5), which a layman, for the sake of the mendicant, has ground <a name="fr_355"></a><a href="#fn_349"><font size="1">1</font></a>, grinds, or will grind, has winnowed, winnows, or will winnow on a rock or a piece of clay containing life, &amp;c. (see II, 1, 5, § 2, all down to) cobwebs; for such large, parched grains, &amp;c., are impure and unacceptable. (8)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept fossil salt or sea salt which a householder, for the sake of the mendicant, has ground or pounded, grinds or pounds, will grind or pound on a rock or a piece of clay containing life, &amp;c.; for such-like fossil salt or sea salt is impure and unacceptable. (9)</p>  
 <p>A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>accept food, &amp;c., which is prepared over the fire; for such food is impure and unacceptable. The Kevalin says: This is the reason: A layman will kill the fire-bodies, by wetting or moistening, wiping or rubbing, throwing up or turning down the food, &amp;c., for the sake of the mendicant. Hence it has been declared to the mendicants: This is the statement, this is the reason, this is the order, that they should not accept food, &amp;c., which has been prepared over the fire, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>This certainly is the whole duty, &amp;c.</p>  
 <p>Thus I say. (10)</p>

 <p><a name="fn_349"></a><a href="sbe2252.htm#fr_355">104:1</a> The subject asa<i>m</i><i>g</i>ae, the uncontrolled one, i.e. layman, stands in the singular, but the verb in the plural. The same irregularity occurs in the next paragraph. The commentator accounts for it simply by saying: ekava<i>k</i>anâdhikâre pi <i>kh</i>ândasatvât tadvyatyayena bahuva<i>k</i>ana<i>m</i> drash<i>t</i>avyam, pûrvatra vâ <i>g</i>âtâv ekava<i>k</i>anam.</p>
