                  Six Universal Entities (Substances or Dravyas)
                  ==============================================

      Structural View Of The Universe
      --------------------------------
      Jain Philosophy does not give credence to the theory that the God
      is a creator, survivor, or destroyer of the universe.  On the
      contrary, it asserts that the universe has always existed and will
      always exist in exact adherence to the laws of the cosmos.  There
      is nothing but infinity both in the past and in the future.

      The world of reality or universe consists of two classes of
      objects:

            Living beings (conscious, chetan, jiva) and
            Non-living objects (unconscious, achetan, ajiva)

      Non-living objects are further classified into five categories
              matter             (Pudgal)
              space              (Akas)
              medium of motion   (Dharmastikay)
              medium of rest     (Adharmastikay)
              time               (Kaal or Samay)

      The five nonliving entities together with the living beings,
      totaling six are aspects of reality in Jainism. They are also known
      as six universal entities, substances or dravyas.

      These six entities of the universe however do undergo countless changes,
      but nothing is lost or destroyed.  Everything is recycled in
      another form.


      The Concept of Reality or Entity or Substance (Dravya):
      ------------------------------------------------------
      A reality is defined to have an existence (Sat).

      Each reality or entity continuously undergoes countless changes
      known as origination and destruction.  This is known as Paryaya of
      a substance.

      In the midst of changes its qualities remain unchanged which is
      called permanence.  This is also known as Gunas of the substance.

      Hence every entity (substance or object) in the universe has three
      aspects:

              Origination  -  Utpada   (continuous changes)
              Destruction  -  Vyaya    (continuous changes)
              Permanence   -  Dhrauvya (permanent)

      Both attributes (Gunas) and modes (Paryayas) are inseparable from
      an entity.

      The same principle can be explained differently as follows:

         An entity is permanent (nitya) from the stand point of its
         attributes or qualities (Guna).  This is known as substancial
         stand point (dravyarthik naya).

         An entity is transient (anitya) from the stand point of its
         forms or modifications (Paryaya).  This is known as modal
         stand point (Paryayarthik Naya).

      A natural description of reality takes into consideration these
      three aspects:

            - permanence in the midst of change
            - identity in the midst of diversity
            - unity in the midst of multiplicity

      The modifications that an entity undergoes refer to the various
      shapes and forms into which a substance is transformed, either
      naturally or artificially.

      Examples:

         A living being through the process of growth, undergoes various
         changes, such as childhood, youth, and old age.  These changes
         are the natural modifications of the living being.

              Childhood, youth, and old age are transient forms (Paryaya)
              of a living being. The soul of a living being is permanent
              (Dravya).

         Clay is molded by a potter into various shapes. Gold is
         crafted by a goldsmith into various ornaments.  These changes
         are artificial modifications of the nonliving being.

            - ornaments and clay shapes are transient (paryaya)
            - gold and clay are permanent (dravya)

      While undergoing various modifications, either natural or
      artificial, the basic substance remains unchanged and is permanent,
      while the forms change and are transient.


      The six universal substances:
      -----------------------------
      As explained above Jainism believes that the universe is made from
      the combination of the six universal substances.  All of the six
      substances are indestructible, imperishable, immortal, eternal and
      continuously go through countless changes.

            Soul/Consciousness  - Jiva     (Living being)
            Matter              - Pudgala  (Nonliving being)
            Medium of motion    - Dharma   (Nonliving being)
            Medium of rest      - Adharma  (Nonliving being)
            Space               - Akasa    (Nonliving being)
            Time                - Kaal     (Nonliving being)


      Soul (Jiva):
      ------------
      Its essential characteristic is consciousness.  This is the only
      knowing substance.  It possesses perfect knowledge, perfect vision,
      perfect power, and perfect bliss.  It also possesses the property
      of contraction and expansion like that of light.  They are of
      innumerable numbers.  Living being can not be created or can not be
      destroyed. The total number of living beings remain same in the
      entire universe at all the time.

      There are two types of Souls (Living beings):

      Free (Mukta) Soul
      -----------------
      Free soul is defined as a pure consciousness, a soul that has
      completely exhausted all of its karma.  It is a liberated soul. It
      is also known as Siddha. All siddhas are defined as Gods in
      Jainism.

      Liberated souls or Gods do not possess a body.

      They possess perfect knowledge, vision, power, and bliss.

      They live in Moksha, which is located on the top of Lokakas.

      They never return again into the cycle of life, death, pain, and
      pleasure.

      There are an innumerable number of liberated souls.

      All Tirthankaras and other Keval-jnanis become siddhas at the end
      of their life (death).


      Worldly (Samsari) Soul
      ----------------------
      It possesses a body (plants, naraki, tiryanch, human, or angel) and
      wanders into the cycle of life and death.

      It is covered with karma particles.

      It possesses limited knowledge, vision, power, and bliss.

      It suffers from birth, death, pain, and pleasure.

      There are a innumerable number of worldly souls.

      It is the doer of all kinds of karmas (actions), and enjoyer of the
      fruit of the karmas.

      It is capable of becoming free from worldly life.

      Worldly souls are divided according to the number of senses they
      possess.

      There are total five senses a living being may possess.
         touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing.

           One sense (Ekendria)
              - possesses one sense - touch only
              - it cannot move own its own accord
              - they are subdivided into five categories

            Soul possesses earth as its body       - Prithvikaya
            Soul possesses water as its body       - Apakaya
            Soul possesses fire as its body        - Agnikaya
            Soul possesses air as its body         - Vayukaya
            Soul possesses vegetable as its body   - Vanaspatikaya

          Two senses (Be-indriya)
            A living being possesses two senses - touch and taste
            ex. worms, leeches.

          Three senses (Tre-indriya)
            A living being possesses three senses - touch, taste, and
            smell ex.  ants, lice.

          Four senses (Chau-indriya)
            A living being possesses four senses - touch, taste, smell,
            and sight ex. flies, bees.

          Five senses (Panch-indriya)
            A living being possesses five senses - touch, taste, smell,
            sight, and hearing ex. animals, birds, human, heavenly, and
            hellish beings, etc.

          A soul with one to four senses does not a possess mind.
          A soul with five senses may possess a mind.

      Matter (Pudgala)
      ----------------
         It is matter or body.
         It has senses (touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing).
         They are of infinite number
         It possesses color
         It does not have consciousness or knowledge.
         The smallest particle of matter is known as Parmanu (atom).
         A paramanu occupies only one pradesa (unit of space)

       There are four divisions of matter:

         Skandha (whole-matter):
           Any object which has a mass of matter can be called skandha.
           ex. stick, stone, knife, a particle of sand

         Skandha-desa (portion of matter):
           Desa means a part, portion, or division.  An undetached
           portion of skandha is called skandha-desa When a part of the
           skandha (skandha-desa) is separated from the whole, it also
           becomes another skandha.  A hand of a statue when undetached
           is known as a skandha-desa but when separated from the statue
           is known as Skandha.

         Skandha-pradesa (smallest particle of matter):
            The smallest undetached portion of skandha, which cannot be
            further divided is called skandha-pradesa.

         Paramanu or Anu (atom):
            When the smallest portion of the matter is separated from its
            skandha, it is called paramanu or anu.  Parmanu matter can
            not be further sub-divided, cut, or pierced.


         Karmic Matter (Karma Pudgala):
         -------------------------------
            Karma is one of the categories of matter.  It is known as
            karmic matter (karma pudgala).  Karma particles are of very
            fine matter not perceptible to the senses.  The entire
            universe is filled with such karmic matter.

            Every living being is covered by karmic matter from the
            beginning of time.  It is the karmic matter that keeps the
            soul away from realization of its true nature or liberation.


      Medium of Motion (Dharma)
      ----------------------------
         Medium of motion helps in the movement of soul and matter.
               ex. water provides medium for fish to move
         It does not possess senses, color, or body.
         It does not have a consciousness or knowledge.
         It exists in Lokakas.

      Medium of Rest (Adharma)
      ---------------------------
         Medium of rest helps to rest soul and matter.
                ex. People rest in the shade of a tree
         It does not possess  senses, color, or body.
         It does not have consciousness or knowledge.
         It exists in Lokakas.

      Space (Akasa)
      -------------
         Space provides room to soul, matter, dharma, adharma, and time.
         It pervades everywhere (infinite).
         It is the support of everything and thus it is self supported.
         It has no form, color, taste, smell, and touch.
         It does not perform any action (inactive), however it does
            give accommodation to soul and matter of their actions.
         It is one and whole.
         Where medium of motion and rest substances exist, it is called
         Lokakas.
         The remaining space is empty and is called Alokakas.


      Time (Kaal)
      ------------
            There are two views exist in Jainism with regards to time.

            One view:     Time is an imaginary thing, it has no real
                          existence.

            Another view: Time has a real existence consisting of
                          innumerable time atoms.

            The changes in living being and non-living being substances
            are measured in the units of time.  However time is not the
            cause of the changes to living being and non-living
            substances.

            The smallest indivisible portion of time is called Samaya.

            Combination of samayas are: moment, second, minute, hour,
                                        day, month, year, etc.

            innumerable samayas  =  one avali
                                     (time required to blink a eye)
            16,777,216 avalis    =  one muhurt  (48 minutes)
            30 muhurts           =  one day
            15 days              =  one fortnight
             2 fortnights        =  one month
            12 months            =  one year
            innumerable years    =  one palyopama
            1,000,000,000,000,000 palyopamas  =  one sagaropama
