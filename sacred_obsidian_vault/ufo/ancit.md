 ANCIENT CITY FOUND, IRRADIATED FROM ATOMIC BLAST  
 
      Radiation still so intense, the area is highly dangerous. 
      A heavy layer of radioactive ash in Rajasthan, India, covers a three 
 square mile area, ten miles west of Jodhpur.  Scientists are investigating the 
 site, where a housing development was  being built. 
      For some time it has been established that there is a very high rate of 
 birth defects and cancer in the area under construction.  The levels of 
 radiation there have registered so high on investigators' gauges that the 
 Indian government has now cordoned off the region. 
      Scientists have unearthed an ancient city where evidence shows an atomic 
 blast dating back thousands of years, from 8,000 to 12,000 years, destroyed 
 most of the buildings and probably a half-million people. 
      One researcher estimates that the nuclear bomb used was about the size of 
 the ones dropped on Japan in 1945. 
      The Mahabharata clearly describes a catastrophic blast that rocked the 
 continent.
 
      "A single projectile charged with all the power in the Universe... An 
 incandescent column of smoke and flame as bright as 10,000 suns, rose in all 
 its splendour...it was an unknown weapon, an iron thunderbolt, a gigantic 
 messenger of death which reduced to ashes an entire race. 
      "The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable.  Their hair and 
 nails fell out, pottery broke without any apparent cause, and the birds turned 
 white.
      "After a few hours, all foodstuffs were infected.  To escape from this 
 fire, the soldiers threw themselves into the river."  
 
 
 A HISTORIAN COMMENTS  
 
      Historian Kisari Mohan Ganguli says that Indian sacred writings  are full 
 of such descriptions, which sound like an atomic blast  as experienced in 
 Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  He says references  mention fighting sky chariots and 
 final weapons.  An ancient battle is described in the Drona Parva, a section 
 of the Mahabharata.
      "The passage tells of combat where explosions of final weapons decimate 
 entire armies, causing crowds of warriors with steeds and elephants and 
 weapons to be carried away as if they were dry leaves of trees," says Ganguli.
      "Instead of mushroom clouds, the writer describes a perpendicular 
 explosion with its billowing smoke clouds as consecutive openings of giant 
 parasols.  There are comments about the contamination of food and people's 
 hair falling out."
 
 
 ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION PROVIDES INFORMATION  
 
      Archeologist Francis Taylor says that etchings in some nearby temples he 
 has managed to translate suggest that they prayed to be spared from the great 
 light that was coming to lay ruin to the city.
 
      "It's so mind-boggling to imagine that some civilization had nuclear 
 technology before we did.
      "The radioactive ash adds credibility to the ancient Indian records that 
 describe atomic warfare."
 
      Construction has halted while the five member team conducts the 
 investigation.  The foreman of the project is Lee Hundley, who pioneered the 
 investigation after the high level of radiation was discovered.
