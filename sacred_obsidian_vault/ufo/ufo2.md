                           UFO's and the End of the World
                            commentary by Jerry W. Decker
 
        Amid recent world  events,  many  people we know and come in contact
        with have voiced concern that the  end  times  might  be  upon us as
        predicted in the biblical chapter of Revelations.
 
        The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq with the subsequent  increase  in oil
        prices brought on  armed responses from the majority of world powers
        directed at Iraq and the actions of Saddam Hussein.
 
        These armed responses have included  trade embargos and is likely to
        lead to a  condition  of war, not yet decided at the  time  of  this
        writing.
 
        In a recent meeting with Cheyenne Turner of Mufon/Dallas, she kindly
        gave KeelyNet copies  of  newsclippings regarding a very strange UFO
        related incident involving Gulf Breeze.
 
        The documents include  a memorandum  from  VISIT  (Vehicle  Internal
        Systems Investigative Team) at PO BOX 890327, Houston, TX 77289-0327
        announcing a meeting on August 23, 1990.
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
        The VISIT program was to discuss the following :
 
            1)  Discussion  of  the  MUFON  1990 Conference  (held  in  Gulf
                           Breeze, Florida)
 
            2)  More interesting Gulf Breeze info (the debunkers exposed)
 
            3)  The  strange  case  of  the  AWOL  soldiers  (with  attached
                           newsclippings)
 
        Six soldiers walk away from sensitive intelligence positions in West
        Germany and show up half way around  the  world in tiny Gulf Breeze,
        Florida.
 
        How could this  happen?   What  was their mission?   These  articles
        raise more questions   than   they  answer.   We  will  discuss  the
        following questions and more at the next VISIT meeting.
 
          *  They were with the 701st Military  Intelligence  Brigade.  Each
             held top secret clearances, but were allowed to walk away from
 
                                       Page 1
 
 
 
 
 
             their posts  and  were  discharged without a court martial.  Is
             this the new policy of the military?
 
          *  A  sargeant,  along  with  two  specialists  and  three  pfc's,
             comprise a squad.  Did they have a charter OTHER  then what has
             been advertised?
 
          *  Is the crazy religious story a cover?
 
          *  Why  did  Police  Chief  Brown  receive  a  phone call from the
             Pentagon only five minutes after  his  inquiry about Michael J.
             Hueckstaedt?  Why  was he told not to question  anyone  in  the
             group?
 
          *  Why did Heuckstaedt say to the arresting officer
 
                    "you don't know what you are doing.  If you
                     take me in you have signed my death warrant."?
 
          *  Who did they plan to kill?  What was the real reason?
 
          *  How  does  psychic Anna Foster figure into what is happening in
             Gulf Breeze?
 
          *  What will happen to the Gulf  Breeze police officer responsible
             for exposing the activity?
 
          *  Will the six return to Gulf Breeze to finish the  job  now that
             they have been officially "discharged"?

                        SIX ARRESTED FOR DESERTING U.S. ARMY
 
        Six US Army soldiers were taken into custody by military authorities
        for being AWOL   and  transported  to  Fort  Benning,  Georgia  last
        Saturday.
 
        The six were  apprehended after one  of  the  soldiers,  Michael  J.
        Hueckstaedt was stopped  by Gulf Breeze Police Officer  Don  Stevens
        for a broken tail light.
 
        Hueckstaedt had no  identification and a computer check found him to
        be one of  six soldiers wanted for  being  Absent  Without  Official
        Leave (AWOL).  Four of the soldiers were found at Anna Foster's home
        on McClure Drive in Gulf Breeze and one (a female)  was staying at a
        campsite at Fort Pickens.
 
        When police went  to  the Foster home Saturday morning, the soldiers
        had several duffel bags, suitcases  and briefcases, and about $4,000
        in cash.

         *****   The six belong to a group called "The End of the World"
                 and claim they came to this area for the "Rapture"
                 which they believe will take place HERE in October.  ****
 
        The soldiers have  been  sought  by authorities since July 9th, when
        they were found missing from their  military  intelligence  unit  in
        West Germany.
 
        Gulf Breeze Police Chief Jerry Brown said that no arrests were made,
        and they were turned over to the CIA and FBI before  going  to  Fort
        Benning.
 
                 Michael J.Hueckstaedt, 19, is from Farson, Wyoming
 
                            The five other soldiers are :
 
                    William N. Setterberg, 20, of Pittsburgh, PA
                     Kenneth G. Beason, 26, of Middlesboro, Tenn
                       Vance A. Davis, 25, of Wichita, Kansas
                      Kris P. Perlock, 20, of Hudson, Wisconsin
                      and Annette Eccleston, 22 of Connecticut.

                  6 AWOL SOLDIERS SAY THEY AIMED TO KILL ANTICHRIST
 
        Gulf Breeze -  Six  soldiers,  reported  by  an  unofficial military
        newspaper to be on a mission to kill  the  Antichrist,  were charged
        Thursday with desertion  from  their  intelligence   unit   in  West
        Germany, Pentagon spokesman said.
 
        A friend also  told  another  newspaper  that  one  of  the soldiers
        arrested in this Florida Panhandle city, a hotbed for UFO sightings,
        was interested in unidentified flying objects and wanted to attend a
        UFO convention in nearby Pensacola.
 
        The religious beliefs  of  the  soldiers,   described  as  Christian
        fundamentalists, are not  part  of  the  Army's investigation,  said
        Major Joe Padilla, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon.
 
        "It's pretty cut  and  dried.  It's getting drier each day," Padilla
        said.  "We are not allowed to look  into religious groups by statute
        so we don't."
 
        The five men  and  a  woman,  all  members  of  the  701st  Military
        Intelligence Brigade at  Augsburg,  West  Germany  are being held at
        Fort Benning, Ga.   They were arrested  Friday  and  Saturday  after
        police stopped one of them for a traffic violation.
 
        They were charged with desertion RATHER THAN THE LESSER  OFFENSE  of
        being absent without  leave  because  they  held top-secret security
        clearances, said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.
 
        Padilla said it will be up to the  soldier's  commanding  officer to
        decide whether to hold a court-martial or take lesser administrative
        action.

        A counter-intelligience investigation is being conducted as a matter
        of routine because  the  six, all analysts assigned to intercepting,
        identifying and exploiting  foreign   communications,   had  handled
        classified material, military spokesmen say.
 
        "There still appears to be no independent evidence  of any espionage
        or security related problem here," Williams said Thursday.
 
        A member of  their  unit  told the newspaper "Stars and Stripes" the
        six were out to FIND AND DESTROY  THE  ANTICHRIST,  the  figure  the
        Bible says will  challenge  Christ.  He spoke on the  condition  his
        name would not be disclosed.
 
        Padilla, an Army  spokesman  at the Pentagon, Wednesday retracted an
        earlier statement that the six were members of a group known as "The
        End of the World."
 
        But "Stars and Stripes" quoted the soldier from the Augsburg unit as
        saying that the cult has ADDITIONAL MEMBERS IN THE AREA.
 
        "There are others who are upset because they didn't get invited," to
        go along on the search for the AntiChrist,  the newspaper quoted the
        soldier as saying.
 
        Beason (one of  the  group)  was interested in science  fiction  and
        UFO's and very  gullible,  Stan  Johnson  told  the  Pensacola  News
        Journal for a  story  published  Thursday.   Johnson,  a  Morristown
        photographer, said in a telephone interview that he picked up Beason
        and Hueckstaedt July  6th at the McGee-Tyson Airport  in  Knoxville,
        Tenn.
 
        "He was one of those people who believed anything someone would tell
        him," Johnson said  of  Beason.   "The idea that he was arrested, or
        that he was hanging around with cult-like  grouped  didn't  surprise
        me.  He kind of live in a science fiction fantasy world sometimes."
 
        Beason told Johnson he was going to Pensacola for a UFO convention.
 
        The Mutual UFO  Network  (MUFON) held its 21st annual  symposium  in
        Pensacola, attracted there  by  the  numerous  sightings reported in
        Gulf Breeze, July 6-8, but officials  of  the organization said they
        couldn't say whether Beason or Hueckstaedt attended.
 
        Gulf Breeze Police  Chief  Jerry Brown discounted that  possibility,
        saying the soldiers did not arrive in the area until July 9th.
 
        Beason told a  similar  story  to his sister and her husband, Caroly
        and Charles Reed, when he spent the  night,  July 7 at their home in
        Talbott, Tenn., the Knoxville News-Sentinel reported Thursday.
 
        The Reeds said  Beason  had  met  a  woman named Anna  when  he  was
        stationed in Pensacola,  and  she got him involved with a group that
        believed the government was covering up alien visits to Earth.  Part
        of the group's mission was to reveal that cover-up.
 
        Some of MUFON's members have accused the government of such a cover-
        up but the organization has not made such a policy statement itself,
        said Don Ware of Fort Walton Beach,  the  group's  Eastern  Regional
        Director.

                        UFO SOLDIERS WON'T FACE COURT-MARTIAL
 
        Six U.S. soldiers  who  went  AWOL  from  intelligence posts in West
        Germany and were arrested at a Florida  beach  known for UFO reports
        won't be court-martialed.  But many other questions remain.
 
        Were the six - five men and a woman - acting on "psychic input" from
        biblical figures and preparing for the world's end,  as  a friend of
        one suggested?
 
        Did they plan  to  move  to  the  West  and live "like a survivalist
        group," as a police captain said he was told by two in the group?
        Or was there another explanation of  the events that began unfolding
        when the six,  who  held  top-secret security clearances,  left  the
        701st Military Intelligence Brigade in Augsberg, West Germany, early
        this month?
 
        "Don't judge them  yet.   They  have  a right to defend themselves,"
        said Anna Foster, at whose Gulf Breeze,  Florida,  home  four of the
        six were arrested  July  14.   Foster,  a  civilian   described   by
        authorities as a psychic, is not charged in the case.
 
        The Army offered  the  six  "non-judicial  punishment" - no trial by
        court-martial - after an investigation  by the Army Intelligence and
        Security Command found no evidence of espionage.
 
        At Fort Knox, KY., where the six were being held, Major  Ron  Mazzia
        said they could  receive  reductions  in  pay  or rank, or both, and
        could be fined.  Specific terms will  be  determined  by  an officer
        acting as a sentencing judge.
 
        Having lost their security clearances, the six might  be discharged,
        Mazzia said.
 
        They were reported  missing  in West Germany on July 9th.  On Friday
        the 13th, Pfc. Michael Hueckstaedt  was  stopped  in Gulf Breeze for
        driving a van with non-working taillights.  A computer  check  found
        him to be absent without leave.
 
        Army information and a search of the van revealed the whereabouts of
        the five other soldiers.

                               Saturday, July 28, 1990
 
                        6 DISCHARGED IN MYSTERIOUS AWOL STINT
 
        Fort Knox, KY  - The Army on Friday discharged six soldiers who left
        their intelligence unit in Europe  and  went to a Florida town known
        for frequent sightings of UFO's.
 
        The soldiers were  reported  missing  July 9th from  Augsburg,  West
        Germany, and were arrested a few days later in Gulf Breeze, FL.
 
 
                                       Page 5
 
 
 
 
 
        An investigation found  no  evidence  the  soldiers  from  the 701st
        Military Intelligence Brigade had  been involved in espionage during
        the time they were AWOL, said Major Ron Mazzia, a spokesman for Fort
        Knox, where the soldiers were detained.
 
        Stan Johnson of Bybee, Tenn., a friend of one of the soldiers, Spec.
        Kenneth G. Beason, 26, said Beason told him they had been "chosen by
        DIVINE INTERVENTION to help prepare for the end of  the world, which
        was supposed to occur in about EIGHT YEARS FROM NOW."
 
        Johnson added that,  "when  the  second  coming  of Christ occurred,
        Jesus Christ was going to ARRIVE IN A SPACESHIP."
 
        Gulf Breeze, where Beasom and others in the group received
        training, has had many reports of UFO sightings.  A symposium of the
        Mutual UFO Network, concluded there July 8th, police said.
