                         EXAMINING THE EARTHLIGHT THEORY...
                         An investigation into a mini-flap.
 
                                    by Greg Long.
 
           By now  we've all heard of "earth lights." Paul Devereux of Great
        Britian coined the term in 1982 when  he  published EARTH LIGHTS. In
        that book, Devereux developed the idea that UFOs are  a byproduct of
        natural processes in the earth.
 
           Micheal Persinger  of  Canada  had  already  been saying the same
        thing for years in a continous outpouring  of  papers  in  which  he
        developed his Tectonic Strain Theory of UFOs.
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        Vangard Notes...
 
             Michael Persinger is the researcher working with  pulsating and
             targeted magnetic fields in the brain.  He and his team created
             a "helmet"  using nails wrapped with many turns of wire to form
             cylindrical solenoids.  These  were  then  mounted in a sort of
             football helmet to allow them to hang over different  parts  of
             the brain.
 
             When connected  to  a computer as a "printer", various patterns
             can be output to magnetically stimulate the brain with specific
             and repeatable patterns.
 
             One of the most fascinating results  of the experiment involved
             the use of subjects with their eyes closed.   While  a  certain
             pattern was   projected   or  "printed"  to  the  solenoids,  a
             flashlight was  aimed toward  the  subject's  eyes  and  slowly
             lowered.  (a loose description follows)
 
             Asked to describe what they saw, EVERY SUBJECT  said  the  same
             thing,
 
                 "I see  a  UFO  coming  down, it is landing.  Now there are
                  small grey people coming  out  of it towards me.  They are
                  taking me into the ship.  Now they are doing  somekind  of
                  physical exploration.   I  am  now  being  taken  from the
                  ship."
 
             As the flashlight beam is lifted up, the subject's say that the
             UFO is now ascending and moving away.

             Dennis Stacy   investigated  Persinger's  work  in  Canada  and
             reported on it in a December  issue  of OMNI.  I believe it was
             88'.
 
             We also  have  papers regarding other experiments  in  inducing
             feelings or  actions  in  the body using magnetic, electric and
             sonic fields.  These are being  placed  on KeelyNet as time and
             funds allow, with as much technical data as we can provide.
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
           Unfortunately, despite Devereux and Persinger's  passion  for the
        concept of a  UFO/earth  stress  link,  neither  researcher  has yet
        proven the case that UFOs are purely a natural phenomenon.
 
           Rock has been crushed in the laboratory,  eliciting extraordinary
        brief pulses of  light,  but  the result of that experiment--in  the
        words of Brian  Brady, who developed the experiment--the crushing of
        rock cannot account for "discrete" light forms seen at high altitude
        (read : spherical UFOs at high altitude).
 
           In fact,  Brady's experiment  even  does  away  with  the  famous
        "piezo-electric effect" as  a  source of UFOs; in  terms  of  energy
        output, piezo-electricity is simply too weak to account for anything
        more than momentary, diffuse glows of light.
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        Vangard Notes...
 
             If you want to demonstrate this effect for yourself Wintergreen
             Life Saver  candies will generate this piezo-electric glow when
             you crunch them between your  teeth.   Turn  out  the light and
             chew one or more while watching the glow from  your  mouth in a
             mirror.
 
             As a  matter  of  fact,  when  this effect was first discovered
             about these candies, many people working in hospitals percieved
             them as a very real danger.   The  concern  was  that people in
             oxygen tents  might  chew  one  and the resultant  spark  might
             ignite and explode the oxygen in the enclosed tent.
 
             A scientific  study  was done on this phenomenon and the effect
             had no ignition effect whatsoever.
 
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
           More importantly, how can a mysterious,  elusive and unidentified
        physical mechanism create  STRUCTURED  objects? This  is  the  great
        failing of the  "earth-lights"  theory; it attempts to solve the UFO
        mystery by ignoring the actual content of the UFO report.
 
           Any unexplained  object seen in  an  earthquake-prone  region--no
        matter how artificial in appearance or "intelligent"  in its actions
        -suddenly becomes a  byproduct  of ionization, plasmas or some other
        little-understood electrical process.
 
           In 1981 I began an investigation  into  UFO  sightings  that  had
        occured over 20   years  in  a  single  area,  the   Yakima   Indian
        Reservation in south-central Washington state.
 
                                       Page 2
 
 
 
 
 
           In the early 1980s, the MUFON UFO Journal published several of my
        papers based on  my  preliminary  findings.  Now  the J. Allen Hynek
        Center for UFO Studies has published my complete findings as a book:
        EXAMINING THE EARTHLIGHT THEORY: The Yakima UFO Microcosm.
 
           EXAMINING THE  EARTHLIGHT THEORY  looks  microscopically  at  the
        Tectonic Strain Theory of UFOs. I use the Yakima  data  (nearly  200
        reports from a   variety   of   witnesses,   plus   numerous   color
        photographs) to test the viability  of  the  Tectonic  Strain Theory
        which Persinger believes explains the Yakima sightings.
 
           The Yakima data form a "microcosm," a fascinating, self-contained
        world of strange  reports,  which  include  a range  of  unexplained
        occurences--orange balls of   light,   CE3's,  possible  abductions,
        Bigfoot sightings, daylight objects, subterrrean sounds and more.
 
           Nearly every part of the Reservation  experienced  some  type  of
        unexplained event over  a 20 year period, making the  Yakima  Indian
        Reservation an excellent  "laboratory"  for  detailed examination of
        UFO phenomena.
 
           Earthquake faults mark the ridges  of the Reservation; it lies at
        the foot of the volcanic Cascade Range; and fire  lookouts  were  in
        place on top of three mountains to observe and record strange lights
        year after year...the  right  conditions for data collection, plenty
        of UFOs and more than enough meticulous  documentation  to  whet the
        appetite of a curious scientist in serach of an explanation.
 
           EXAMINING THE EARTHLIGHT THEORY takes the reader  on a historical
        journey, following the sightings to their most recent occurence. All
        data of this  unique  mini-flap  are used to thoroughly evaluate the
        basic components of  the  Tectonic   Strain  Theory.  EXAMINING  THE
        EARTHLIGHT THEORY is an experience in detective work,  where all the
        facts of the  Yakima  micrcosm  are weighed, sifted and evaluated in
        the systematic pursuit  of  a  solution   to   the  mystery  of  the
        microcosm.
