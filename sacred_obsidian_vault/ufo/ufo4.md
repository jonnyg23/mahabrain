        --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
             At the  end  of  the nineteenth century, the most distinguished
        scientists and engineers  declared  that  no  known  combination  of
        materials and locomotion could be assembled into a  practical flying
        machine.  Fifty years  later  another  generation  of  distinguished
        scientists and engineers  declared   that   it  was  technologically
        infeasible for a  rocket ship to reach the moon.  Nevertheless,  men
        were getting off  the  ground  and  out  into space even while these
        words were uttered.
 
             In the last half of the twentieth  century,  when technology is
        advancing faster than   reports  can  reach  the   public,   it   is
        fashionable to hold  the  pronouncements  of  yesterday's experts to
        ridicule.  But there is something  anomalous  about  the consistency
        with which eminent  authorities  fail  to  recognize   technological
        advances even while they are being made.  You must bear in mind that
        these men are  not  given  to making public pronouncements in haste;
        their conclusions are  reached  after  exhaustive  calculations  and
        proofs, and they are better informed about their subject than anyone
        else alive.  But by and large, revolutionary advances  in technology
        do not contribute  to  the advantage of established experts, so they
        tend to believe that the challenge cannot possibly be realized.
 
             The UFO  phenomenon  is  a   perversity   in   the   annals  of
        revolutionary engineering.  On the one hand, public authorities deny
        the existence of  flying  saucers and prove their  existence  to  be
        impossible.  This is  just  as  we  should  expect  from established
        experts.  But on the other hand,  people  who  believe  that  flying
        saucers exist have produced findings that only tend to prove that
        UFOs are technologically  infeasible  by  any known  combination  of
        materials and locomotion.
 
             There is  reason  to suspect that the people who believe in the
        existence of UFOs do not want to discover  the technology because it
        is not in the true believer's self interest that a flying saucer be
 
                                       Page 1
 
 
 
 
 
        within the capability of human engineering.  The true believer wants
        to believe that  UFOs  are  of extraterrestrial origin because he is
        seeking some kind of relief from debt  and taxes by an alliance with
        superhuman powers.
 
             If anyone with mechanical ability really wanted  to  know how a
        saucer flies, he  would  study  the  testimonies to learn the flight
        characteristics of this craft, and  then  ask,  "How  can we do this
        saucer thing?"  This is probably what Werner Von Braun  said when he
        decided that it  was  in his self-interest to launch man into space:
        "How can we get this bird off the ground, and keep it off?"
 
             Well, what is a flying saucer?  It is a disc-shaped craft about
        thirty feet in diameter with a dome  in the center accommodating the
        crew and, presumably, the operating machinery.  And  it  flies.   So
        let us begin  by  building  a disc-shaped airfoil, mount the cockpit
        and the engine under a central canopy,  and  see  if  we can make it
        fly.  As a  matter  of fact, during World War II the  United  States
        actually constructed a number of experimental aircraft conforming to
        these specifications, and  photographs  of  the  craft are published
        from time to time in popular magazines about science and flight.  It
        is highly likely  that some of the  UFO  reports  before  1950  were
        sightings of these test flights.  See how easy it is when you 'want'
        to find answers to a mystery?
 
             The mythical saucer also flies at incredible speeds.  Well, the
        speeds believed possible  depend  upon  the time and  place  of  the
        observer.  As stated earlier, a hundred years ago, twenty-five miles
        per hour was  legally  prohibited in the belief that such a terrific
        velocity would endanger human life.  So replace the propeller of the
        experimental disc airfoil with a modern  aerojet  engine.  Is mach 3
        fast enough for believers?
 
             But the true saucer not only flies, it also hovers.   You  mean
        like a Hovercraft?   One  professional engineer translated Ezekiel's
        description of heavenly ships as a helicopter-cum-hovercraft.
 
             But what of the anomalous electromagnetic  effects  manifest in
        the space surrounding   a   flying  saucer?   Well,   Nikola   Tesla
        demonstrated a prototype of an electronic device that was eventually
        developed into the  electron  microscope,  the television screen, an
        aerospace engine called the Ion  Drive.   Since  World  War  II, the
        engineering of the Ion Drive has been advanced as the most promising
        solution to the propulsion of interplanetary spaceships.   The drive
        operates by charging   atomic  particles  and  directing  them  with
        electro-magnetic force as a jet to  the  rear,  generating a forward
        thrust in reaction.   The advantage of the Ion Drive  over  chemical
        rockets is that  a spaceship can sweep in the ions it needs from its
        flight path, like  an aerojet sucks  in  air  through  its  engines.
        Therefore, the ship  must carry only the fuel it needs  to  generate
        the power for its chargers; there is no need to carry dead weight in
        the form of  rocket  exhaust.   There  is  another  advantage  to be
        derived from ion rocketry: The top  speed  of  a  reaction engine is
        limited by the  ejection velocity of its exhaust.   An  ion  jet  is
        close to the  speed  of  light.   If  space  travel  is  ever  to be
        practical, transport will have to  achieve  a  large fraction of the
        speed of light.
 
             In 1972 the French journal Science et Avenir reported Franco-
 
                                       Page 2
 
 
 
 
 
        American research into  a  method  of ionizing the airstream flowing
        over the wings to eliminate sonic  boom,  a serious objection to the
        commercial success of  the  Concorde.  Four years  later  a  picture
        appeared in an  American  tabloid  of  a  model aircraft showing the
        current state of development.  The  photograph  shows  a disc-shaped
        craft, but not so thin as a saucer; it looks more like a flying
        curling stone.  In silent flight, the ionized air flowing around the
        craft glows as  a proper ufo should.  The last word  comes  from  an
        engineering professor at   the   local   university;  he  has  begun
        construction of a flying saucer in his backyard.
 
             To the true believer, the flying  saucer  has no jet.  It seems
        to fly by some kind of antigravity.  As antigravity  is not known to
        exist in physical  theory  or  experimental fact in popular science,
        the saucer is  clearly alien and beyond  human  comprehension.   But
        antigravity depends upon what you conceive gravity  to  be,  doesn't
        it?
 
             For all  practical purposes, you do not have to understand what
        Newton and Einstien mean by gravity.   Gravity  is  an  acceleration
        downward, to the center of the earth.  Therefore, antigravity  is an
        acceleration upward.  As  far as practical engineering is concerned,
        any means to achieve a gain in altitude  is  an  antigravity engine.
        An airplane; a balloon; a rocket; a stepladder; all  are antigravity
        engines.  See how easy it is to invent an antigravity engine?
 
             There are three basic kinds of locomotive engines.  The primary
        principle is traction.  The foot and the wheel are traction engines.
        The traction engines  depend  upon  friction  against  a surrounding
        medium to generate movement, and locomotion  can proceed only as far
        and as speedily  as  the  surrounding  friction will  provide.   The
        second principle is  displacement.   The  balloon  and the submarine
        rise by displacing a denser medium;  they descend by displacing less
        that their weight.   The  tertiary  drive is the rocket  engine.   A
        rocket is driven  by  reaction  from the mass of material it ejects.
        Although a rocket  is  most  efficient   when   not   impeded  by  a
        surrounding medium, it must carry not only it's fuel  but  also  the
        mass it must  eject.   As  a  consequence, the rocket is impractical
        where powerful acceleration is required  for  extended  drives.   In
        chemical rocketry, ten minutes is a long burn for powered flight.
        What is needed  for  practical antigravity locomotion  is  a  fourth
        principle which does   not  depend  upon  a  surrounding  medium  or
        ejection of mass.
 
             You must take notice that none  of the principles of locomotion
        required any new discovery.  they have all been around for thousands
        of years, and  engineering  only  implemented  the   principle  with
        increasing efficiency.  A  fourth  principle  of locomotion has also
        been around for  thousands  of  years:   It  is  centrifugal  force.
        Centrifugal force is  the principle of the military  sling  and  the
        medieval catapult.
 
             Everyone knows that centrifugal force can overcome gravity.  If
        directed upward, centrifugal   force   can   be  used  to  drive  an
        antigravity engine.  The problem engineers have been unable to solve
        is that centrifugal force is generated  in  all  directions  on  the
        plane of the  centrifuge.   It won't provide locomotion  unless  the
        force can be  concentrated  in  one  direction.  The solution of the
        sling, of releasing the wheeling at the instant the centrifugal
 
                                       Page 3
 
 
 
 
 
        force is directed  along  the  ballistic  trajectory,  has  all  the
        inefficiencies of a cannon.  The  difficulty  of  the problem is not
        real, however.  There  is  a  mental  block preventing  people  from
        perceiving a centrifuge as anything other than a flywheel.
 
             A bicycle wheel is a flywheel.  If you remove the rim and tire,
        leaving only the  spokes  sticking  out of the hub, you still have a
        flywheel.  In fact, spokes alone make a more efficient flywheel than
        the complete wheel; this is because  momentum  only  goes up only in
        proportion to mass but with the square of speed.  Spokes are made of
        drawn steel with  extreme  tensile  strength,  so spokes  alone  can
        generate the highest  level  of centrifugal force long after the rim
        and tire have  disintegrated.   But   spokes  alone  still  generate
        centrifugal force equally  in  all  directions  from  the  plane  of
        rotation.  All you  have  to  do to concentrate centrifugal force in
        one direction is remove all the  spokes  but  one.   That  one spoke
        still functions as a flywheel, even though it is  not  a  wheel  any
        longer.
 
             See how  easy  it is once you accept an attitude of solving one
        problem at a time as you come to it?   You  can even add a weight to
        the end of the spoke to increase the centrifugal force.
 
             But our   centrifuge   still  generates  a  centrifugal   force
        acceleration in all  directions  around  the  plane of rotation even
        though it doesn't generate acceleration equally in all directions at
        the same time.  All we have managed  to do is make the whole ball of
        wire wobble around the common center of mass between  the  axle  and
        free end of the spoke.  To solve this problem, now that we have come
        to it, we need merely to  accelerate the spoke through a few degrees
        of arc and  then  let  it  complete  the cycle of revolution without
        power.  As long as it is accelerated  during  the  same  arc at each
        cycle, the locomotive   will   lurch   in   one  direction,   albeit
        intermittently.  But don't forget that the piston engine also drives
        intermittently.  The regular centrifugal pulses can be evened out by
        mounting several centrifuges  on  the same axle so that a pulse from
        another flywheel takes over as soon  as  one  pulse of power is past
        it's arc.
 
             The next problem facing us is that the momentum imparted to the
        centrifugal spoke is  carries  it all around the cycle  with  little
        loss of velocity.   The  amount  of  concentrated  centrifugal force
        carrying the engine  in the desired  direction  is  too  low  to  be
        practical.  Momentum is  half  the  product  of mass  multiplied  by
        velocity squared.  Therefore,  what  we  need  is a spoke that has a
        tremendous velocity with minimal mass.   They don't make spokes like
        that for bicycle wheels.  A search through the engineers' catalog
        however, turns up just the kind of centrifuge we need.   An electron
        has no mass  at  rest  (you  cannot find a smaller minimum mass than
        that); all it's mass is inherent  in  its  velocity.  So we build an
        electron raceway in  the  shape  of  a  doughnut  in  which  we  can
        accelerate an electron  to  a  speed close to that of light.  As the
        speed of light  is  approached,   the   energy  of  acceleration  is
        converted to a  momentum approaching infinity.  s  it  happens,  an
        electron accelerator answering   our   need  was  developed  by  the
        University of California during the  last years of World War II.  It
        is called a betatron, and the doughnut is small enough to be carried
        comfortably in a man's hands.

             We can visualize the operation of the Mark I from what is known
        about particle accelerators.   To  begin with, high energy electrons
        ionize the air surrounding them.   This causes the betatrons to glow
        like an annular neon tube.
 
             Therefore, around the rim of the saucer a ring  of  lights will
        glow like a  string  of  shining beads at night.  The power required
        for flight will ionize enough of the surrounding atmosphere to short
        out all electrical wiring in the  vicinity  unless  it  is specially
        shielded.  In theory, the top speed of the Mark I  is  close  to the
        speed of light;  in  practice  there  are  many  more problems to be
        solved before relativistic speeds can be approached.
 
             The peculiar  property  of  microwaves   heating  all  material
        containing the water molecule means that any animal  luckless enough
        to be nearby  may  be cooked from the inside out; vegetation will be
        scorched where a saucer lands; and  any  rocks  containing  water of
        crystallization will be blasted.  Every housewife with  a  microwave
        knows all this;  only  hard-headed  scientists  and soft-headed true
        believers are completely dumbfounded.   The UFOnauts would be cooked
        by their own  engines,  too,  if they left the flight  deck  without
        shielding.  This probably  explains  why  a  pair  of UFOnauts, in a
        widely published photograph,  wear   reflective  plastic  jumpsuits.
        Mounting the betatrons outboard on a disc is an efficient way to get
        them away from the crew's compartment, and the plating  of  the hull
        shields the interior.   At high accelerations, increasing amounts of
        power are transformed into radiation,  making  the centrifugal drive
        inefficient in strong  gravitational  fields.   The  most  practical
        employment of this   engineering  is  for  large  spacecraft,  never
        intended to land.   The  flying  saucers  we  see  are  very  likely
        scouting craft sent  from mother ships moored in orbit.   For  brief
        periods of operation,  the  heavy fuel consumption of the Mark I can
        be tolerated, along with radiation  leakage  -  especially  when the
        planet being scouted is not your own.
 
             When you  compare  the  known  operating features  of  particle
        centrifuges with the eyewitness testimony, it is fairly evident that
        any expert claiming  flying  saucers  to be utterly beyond any human
        explanation is not doing his homework,  and  he should be reexamined
        for his professional license.
 
             For dramatic purpose, I have classified the development  of the
        flying saucer through five stages:
 
             Mark I    - Electronic centrifuges mounted around a fixed disc,
                        outboard.
             Mark II  - Electronic centrifuges  mounted  outboard  around  a
                        rotating disc.
             Mark III  -  Electronic centrifuges mounted outboard  around  a
                        rotating disc,  period  of cycles tuned to harmonize
                        with ley lines, for jet assist.
             Mark IV  - Particle centrifuge tuned to modify time coordinates
                        by faster than light travel.
             Mark V    -  No centrifuge.   Solid  state  coils  and  crystal
                        harmonics transforms  ambient  field   directly  for
                        dematerialization and      rematerialization      at
                        destinations in time and space.
 
             Now that the UFO phenomenon has been demystified and reduced to
 
                                       Page 5
 
 
 
 
 
        human ken, we  can  proceed  to prove the theory.  If your resources
        are like those of the PLO, you can  go  ahead  and  build  your  own
        flying saucer without any further information from  me,  but  I have
        nothing to work with except the junk I can find around the house.
 
             I found  an  old  electric motor that had burned out, but still
        had a few turns left in it.  I drilled  a  hole  through the driving
        axle so that  an eight inch bar would slide freely  through  it.   I
        mounted the motor  on  a  chassis so that the bar would rotate on an
        eccentric cam.  In this way in end of the bar was always extended in
        the same direction while the other  end  was always pressed into the
        driving axle.  As  both ends had the same angular  velocity  at  all
        times, the end  extending  out  from  the  axle  would always have a
        higher angular momentum.   This   resulted  in  a  concentration  of
        centrifugal acceleration in one direction.  when  I  plugged  the in
        the motor, the  sight  of my brainchild lurching ahead - unsteadily,
        but in a constant direction, - gave  me  a  bigger  thrill  than  my
        baptism of sex - lasted longer, too.  But not much  longer.  In less
        than twenty seconds the burned-out motor gasped its last and died in
        a puff of smoke; the test run was broadcast on radio microphone but
        the spectacle was lost without television.  Because my prototype did
        not survive long  enough  to  run in two directions I had to declare
        the test inconclusive because of mechanical breakdown.  So, what the
        hell, the Wright brothers didn't  get  far  off the ground the first
        time they tried either.  Now that I know the critter  will  move, it
        is worthwhile to  put  a  few  bucks  in  to  a new motor, install a
        clutch, and gear the transmission  down.   One  problem at a time is
        the way it goes.
 
             A rectified centrifuge small enough to hold  in  one  hand  and
        powered by solar  cells,  based  on my design, could be manufactured
        for about fifty dollars (depending  on  production  and  competitive
        bids).  Installed on  Skylab,  it would be sufficient  to  keep  the
        craft in orbit  indefinitely.   A larger Hyperspace Drive (as I call
        this particular design)  will   provide   a   small   but   constant
        acceleration for interplanetary  spacecraft  that  would  accumulate
        practical velocities over runs of several days.
 
             It is  rumored  that  a  gentleman by the name of Dean invented
        another kind of antigravity engine  sometime  during  the past fifty
        years, but I  have  been  unable to track down any more  information
        except that its   design   consists  of  wheels  within  wheels.   A
        gentleman in Florida, Hans, Schnebel,  sent  me  a  description of a
        machine he built and tested that is similar in principle to the Dean
        drive.  Essentially, a large rotating disk has a smaller rotating
        disc on one  side  of  the main driving axle.  The  two  wheels  are
        geared together so  that  a weight mounted on the rim of the smaller
        wheel is always at the outside of  the  larger wheel during the same
        length of arc of each revolution, and always next to  the  main axle
        during the opposite  arc.   What happens is that the velocity of the
        weight is amplified by harmonic coincidence  with  the  large  rotor
        during one half of its period of revolution, and diminished during
        the other half  cycle.   This  concentrates  momentum  in  the  same
        quarter continually, to  rectify  the  centrifuge.   The  result  is
        identical to my Hyperspace Drive, @ut hasthe beauty of continuously
        rotating motion.  Now, if the Dean  drive  is  made with a huge main
        rotor, - like about thirty feet in diameter - there  is  enough room
        to mount a series of smaller wheels around the rim, set in gimbals

        for attitude control,  an  Mr.  Dean  himself  has himself a model T
        Flying Saucer requiring no license from the AEC.
 
             In 1975, Professor Eric Laithwaite,  Head  of the Department of
        Electrical Engineering at  the  Imperial  College   of  Science  and
        Technology in London,   England,   invented   another   approach  to
        harnessing the centrifugal  force   of   a  gyroscope  to  power  an
        antigravity engine - well, he almost invented it,  but  he  did  not
        have the sense to hold onto success when he grasped it.  Professor
        Laithwaite is world-renowned  for his most creative solutions to the
        problems of magnetic-levitation-propulsion systems, and the fruit of
        his brain is  operating today in  Germany  and  Japan,  his  railway
        trains float in the air while traveling at over three  hundred miles
        per hour.  If  anyone  can  present  the  world  with  a proven anti
        gravity engine, it must be the professor.
 
             Laithwaite satisfied  himself   that   the  precessional  force
        causing a gyroscope  to wobble had no reaction.   This  is  a  clear
        violation of Newton's  Third Law of Motion as 'generally conceived'.
        Laithwaite figured that  if  he   could   engage   the  precessional
        acceleration while the  gyroscope  wobbled  in  one   direction  and
        release the precession while it wobble in other directions, he would
        be able to demonstrate to a forum of colleagues and critics at the
        college a rectified  centrifuge  that worked as a proper antigravity
        engine.  His insight was sound but  he  did  not  work it out right.
        All he succeeded in demonstrating was a 'separation  between  action
        and reaction,' and  his  engine did nothing but oscillate violently.
        Unfortunately, neither Laithwaite  or his critics were looking for a
        temporal separation between action and reaction, so  the loophole he
        proved in Newton's  Third Law was not noticed.  Everyone was looking
        for action without  reaction,  so   no  one  saw  anything  at  all.
        Innumerable other inventors  have  constructed  engines  essentially
        identical to Laithwaite's, including a young high school dropout who
        lives across the street from me.
 
             Another invention  described  is  U.S. Patent disclosure number
        3,653,269, granted to Richard Foster, a retired chemical engineer in
        Louisiana.  Foster mounted his gyroscopes  around the rim of a large
        rotor disc, like a two cylinder flying saucer.  Every time the rotor
        turns a half cycle, the precessional twist of the gyros  in reaction
        generates a powerful  force.   During  the  half cycle when Foster's
        gyros were twisting in the other direction,  his  clutch grabbed and
        transmitted the power to the driving wheels.  During  the other half
        cycle, the gyros twisted freely.  Foster claims his machine traveled
        four miles per hour until it flew to pieces from centrifugal forces.
        After examining the  patents,  I agreed that it looked like it would
        work, and it  certainly would fly  to  pieces  because  the  bearing
        mounts were not  nearly  strong  enough  to  contain   the  powerful
        twisting forces his  machine  generated.   Foster's design, however,
        cannot be included among antigravity  engines  because  it would not
        operate off the  ground.   He  never  claimed it would,  and  Foster
        always described his  invention  truthfully  as nothing more than an
        implementation of the fourth principle of locomotion.
 
             What Laithwaite needed was another  rotary  component, like the
        Dean drive, geared to his engine's oscillations so  that  they would
        always be turned  to drive in the same direction.  As it happens, an
        Italian by the name of Todeschini recently secured a patent on this
 
 
                                       Page 7
 
 
 
 
 
        idea, and his working model is said to be attracting the interest of
        European engineers.
 
             When the  final  rectifying  device  is  added to the essential
        Laithwaite design, all the moving  parts  generate  the vectors of a
        vortex, and the  velocity  generated  is  the axial  thrust  of  the
        vortex.  Therefore I call inventions based on this design the Vortex
        Drive.
 
             By replacing the Hyperspace modules of the Mark I Flying Saucer
        with Vortex modules,  still  retaining the essential betatron as the
        centrifuge, performance is improved for the Mark II.  To begin with,
        drive is generated only when the  main  rotor  is  revolving, so the
        saucer can be  parked with the motor running.  This  eliminates  the
        agonizing doubt we all suffered when the Lunar Landers were about to
        blast off to  rejoin  the  command  capsule:  Will the engine start?
        This would explain why the ring of lights around the rim of a saucer
        is said to  begin  to revolve immediately  prior  to  lift  off.   A
        precessional drive affords  a  wider  range  of  control,   and  the
        responses are more  stable  than  a direct centrifuge.  But the most
        interesting improvement is the result  of  the  'structure'  of  the
        electromagnetic field generated by the Vortex drive.   By amplifying
        and diminishing certain  vectors  harmonically,  the Mark III flying
        saucer can ride  the  electromagnetic   current   of   the   Earth's
        electromagnetic field like the jet stream.  And this is just what we
        see UFO's doing,  don't  we,  as  they  are reported  running  their
        regular flight corridors   during   the   biennial  tourist  season.
        Professor Laithwaite got all this  together when he conceived of his
        antigravity engine as  a  practical  application of  his  theory  of
        "rivers of energy  running  through space"; he just could not get it
        off the drawing board the first time.
 
             The flying saucer consumes  fuel  at  a  rate  that  cannot  be
        supplied by all the wells in Arabia.  Therefore we  have  to  assume
        that UFO engineers  must  have  developed  a practical atomic fusion
        reactor.  But once the Mark III is  perfected,  another  fuel supply
        becomes attainable, and no other is so practical for  flying saucer.
        The Moray Valve  converts  the Mark III into a Mark IV Flying Saucer
        by extending its operational capabilities  through 'time' as well as
        space.  The Moray  Valve,  you  see,  functions  by   changing   the
        direction of flow of energy in the Sun's gravitational field.  It is
        the velocity of energy that determines motion, and motion determines
        the flow of  time.   We  shall  continue  the  engineering of flying
        saucers in the following essays.
 
             My investigation  into antigravity  engineering  brought  me  a
        technical report while  this  typescript  was  in preparation.   Dr.
        Mason Rose, President   of   the  University  for  Social  Research,
        published a paper describing the  discoveries  of  Dr.  Paul  Alfred
        Biefeld, astronomer and  physicist at the California  Institute  for
        Advanced Studies, and   his  assistant,  Townsend  Brown.   In  1923
        Biefeld discovered that a heavily charged electrical condensor moved
        toward its positive pole when suspended  in  a  gravitational field.
        He assigned Brown  to  study  the effect as a research  project.   A
        series of experiments showed Brown that the most efficient shape for
        a field propelled condensor was a disc with a central dome.  In 1926
        Townsend published his   paper   describing   all  the  construction
        features and flight characteristics  of  a flying saucer, conforming
        to the testimony of the first flight witnessed over Mount Rainer
 
                                       Page 8
 
 
 
 
 
        twenty-one years later  and  corroborated  by thousands of witnesses
        since. (The Biefeld-Brown Effect explains  why  a Mark III rides the
        electromagnetic jet stream.)
 
             We may speculate that flying saucers spotted from  time to time
        may not only  include  visitors  from  other  planets  and travelers
        through time, but also fledglings from an unknown number of cuckoo's
        nests in secret experimental plants  all  over the world.  The space
        program at Cape Canaveral may be nothing more than  a  supercolossal
        theatre orchestrated by  Cecil B. Demille to reassure Americans that
        they are still 'numero uno' after  Russia  beat  our  atomic  ace by
        putting Sputnik into  orbit.   We  need  not doubt that  the  Apollo
        spaceships got to  the Moon, but we may wonder if Neil Armstrong was
        the first man to land there.  The  real  space program may have been
        conducted in secret as a spin-off from the Manhattan  Project  since
        the end of  World War II, and Apollo 13 may have been picked up by a
        sag wagon to make sure our team scored  a  home  run every time they
        went to bat.   The  exploration  of  space  is  the  most  dangerous
        enterprise ever taken on by a living species.  Don't you ever wonder
        why the Russians  are  losing  men  in  space  like  a  safari being
        decimated in headhunter country, while  nothing  ever happens to our
        boys except accidents during ground training?
