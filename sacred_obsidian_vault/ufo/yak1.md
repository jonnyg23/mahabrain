 FORWARD
 
      The Yakima UFO Field project was undertaken by me in August of
 1972 at the request of Dr. J. Allen Hynek.  The study has
 continued to this day.
 
      The original reports were not widely circulated by Dr. Hynek
 at my request.  However, a number of articles and at least one book
 related to the Toppenish Study have been published over the years.
 This electronic distribution is my attempt to make the original
 documents of the study available to anyone who is interested.
 
      This distribution contains the text of three papers:  The first
 was submitted in November of 1972.  Two follow-up reports, in 1974
 and 1975, summarize developments and report statistics following
 the conclusion of the initial field study.  The original
 typewritten documents were scanned and converted to electronic media
 files with OCR software.  Otherwise, they appear essentially as they
 did in their original form.
 
      December of 1995 marks twenty-three years since the Toppenish
 Field Study was undertaken.  Bill Vogel and Allen Hynek have died.
 Many of the other people who contributed to it have moved on to new
 jobs, retired or died.  This publication is dedicated to Bill Vogel
 and others who helped to bring the Yakima manifestation to our
 attention.

 INTRODUCTION
 
      This report presents findings made during a field study period
 extending from August 20, 1972 to August 31, 1972, near Toppenish,
 Washington U.S.A.
 
      It is intended as a preliminary report, since investigation is
 still in progress.  The report begins with a description of the
 study area.  The following section presents a short history of UFO
 activity in the region.  The next section deals with the objectives
 of the study, the investigative approach employed and instruments
 used.  Detailed reports of each observation of apparent UFO
 activity made by this investigator comprise the fourth section of
 the report.
 
      The final section of this report includes some preliminary
 assessments concerning the effectiveness of the study and some
 suggestions for improving equipment for present and future
 investigations.  Care has been taken to report all unusual
 observations as accurately as possible and to refrain from
 analysis.
 
      Appendix A summarizes additional observations by other
 individuals during the year of 1972, prior to the initiation of the
 field study described in this report.
 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY AREA
 
      The area involved in this study consists of a rectangular
 section, about forty miles wide and seventy miles long (2,800 sq.
 miles), located in south central Washington state.  Almost all of
 the area is a part of the reservation of the Yakima Indian Nation.
 Approximately two-thirds of the reservation is closed to the public
 and special authorization is required to enter the area.
 
      Eastern borders of the study area are marked by the towns of
 Parker, Wapato, Toppenish, Granger and Mabton.  The western border
 is formed by the eastern slopes of the Cascade mountain Range, with
 Mount Adams (elevation 12,307 ft.) the dominating feature of the
 skyline.  The northern border of the area is marked by Ahtanum
 Ridge (4,5OO ft.).  Bickleton Ridge and the Simcoe Mountains (max.
 elevation 5,500 ft.) from the southern border.  Figure I is a map
 of the study area.
 
      The eastern quarter (144,325 acres) of the region is used for
 agricultural purposes; the principal crops being sugar beets, hops,
 mint, asparagus, corn, peas, grain, alfalfa, cherries, peaches,
 apples and grapes.  This quarter is flat valley farmland.  The
 remaining portion of the eastern half or the valley is used for
 rangeland and consists mainly of dry, rolling hills.
 
      The western half of the study area is made up of heavily
 forested terrain, much of it primitive and inaccessible to normal
 ground transportation.  Timber from this region is a major source
 of income for the area.  Railroad tracks of the Burlington Northern
 Line run along the eastern border of the reservation.  U.S. Highway
 97 is the only major freeway in the area and, along with primary
 power transmission lines of the Bonneville Power Administration,
 cuts through the southeastern corner of the reservation.
 
      Secondary roads, many of them dirt or gravel, crisscross the
 reservation.  The town of White Swan, twenty miles due west of
 Toppenish, is the most western population center in the area and
 has about 300 inhabitants.  The closest areas of industrial
 significance are the nuclear research facilities at Hanford, 28
 statute miles to the northeast, and the Yakima Firing Range, 14
 statute miles to the north of Toppenish.
 
      Geology of the study area is interesting:  Marine fossils
 found in the area indicate that the entire valley might once have
 been a huge lake or inland sea.  Volcanic activity is still very
 much in evidence, especially in the vicinities of Mt. Adams and
 neighboring Mt. Rainier.
 
 
 HISTORY OF UFO PHENOMENA IN THE STUDY AREA
 
      Activity recognizable as classical UFO phenomena has been
 present in the Toppenish area for more than eight years.  There is
 even some evidence to suggest that UFO reports are a part of Yakima
 Indian legends.  A detectable increase in activity has taken place
 in the last three years.  Reports have recently been made by law
 enforcement personnel from the Washington Stare Patrol, County
 Sheriff and reservation Law and Order department.  Formerly, fire
 lookouts had been the primary source of reports.  A majority of
 observations are made at night and consist mostly of the typical
 "nocturnal light" (NL) phenomenon described by Hynek(1).  Primary
 characteristics of this particular phenomenon include:
           1.  Generally bright light, larger than a point source.
 
           2.  Colors reported cover the entire spectrum, but most
                usually are yellow-orange.
 
           3.  Kinematics are not attributable to balloons,
               aircraft or other natural objects and often give
               the appearance of intelligent action.
 
      The NL in the Toppenish study area have generally conformed to
 the above description.  The Toppenish manifestation does seem to
 differ slightly in that it is frequently observed on or near the
 ground.  Predominant colors range from brownish-orange to pure
 white.  Investigation of prior NL activity in the study area
 revealed that a few daytime observations have been made.  These
 daylight sightings are very rare and have ranged from "fuzzy"
 appearing "blobs" to well-defined, metallic colored,
 disk shaped objects of the classical "flying saucer" variety.
 There was also one ten year old report of a physical impression
 made in the ground by an UFO.
 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY OBJECTIVES AND METHODS
 
      Preparations for the Toppenish project began in April of 1972,
 following a survey of the extent of activity in the area by Dr. J.
 A. Hynek.  It was determined at this time that the activity was of
 sufficient quality and regularity to justify placement of an
 observer equipped with instruments in the area during a period of
 expected peak activity.  The Yakima Tribal council and the Yakima
 Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, along with the Agency Forestry
 Division gave their full cooperation to the project and plans were
 made to conduct a field study during the month of August (a period
 of prior high sighting probability).
 
      A primary objective of the study was to determine the
 feasibility of "staking-out" a scientific observer in an area of
 high sighting probability, with the purpose in mind of obtaining
 hard data concerning UFO phenomena.
 
      First priority was assigned to obtaining photographs,
 including spectrographs and position data.  It was felt that this
 information would be of greatest use as scientific information and
 the easiest to acquire, given the transient nature of the
 phenomenon under study.  Another priority was the acquisition of
 data relating to any magnetic effects which might arise from UFO
 activity.
 
      The investigative approach used involved setting-up portable
 observation points at selected locations in the study area for
 several days at a time.  This technique allowed the observer to
 become acquainted with normal activity in a given location and
 prepare him to detect any abnormal activity which might occur.  No
 concerted effort was made to "chase" the phenomenon around the
 reservation.  Instead, it was allowed to come to the observer.  The
 temporary observation points and instruments were manned during the
 times of greatest sighting probability, i.e., between sunset and
 sunrise.
 
      Additional time, during the day, was spent gathering
 background data, such as previous sighting reports, geographical
 and other supportive information.  Accent was placed on flexibility
 of method, because of the large area to be covered and the
 elusiveness of the phenomenon under investigation.  The
 investigator's presence was purposely made as unobtrusive as
 possible to avoid interference with routine business on the
 reservation.
 
      Observation points were established at six points in the study
 area.  Three of these locations were adjacent to Satus, Signal Peak
 and Sopelia fire lookouts (Slide Nos. l, 2 and 3, respectively).
 The remaining observation points were positioned in the valley near
 White Swan.  All of the observation points are numbered on the map
 of Figure I.  (Satus, Signal Peak and Sopelia lookouts are numbered
 5, 4 and 6, respectively.)
 
      The Tribal Forestry Division radio system was available for
 communication between the investigator and fire lookouts.  It was
 intended that such a communication link might provide a means of
 triangulating the position of a NL, should a sighting occur.  All
 transmissions were coded because of previous reports of apparent NL
 responses to radio messages concerning them.  When Possible, radio
 transmissions were avoided to keep from disturbing personnel who
 monitor the 110 unit radio network on a twenty-four hour basis
 during the fire season.
 
      All observation points were accessible by means of roads.
 However, a sturdy car was required to traverse them.  The fire
 lookout locations afforded  excellent visibility to the
 investigator and were free from  interfering lights.  Valley
 observation points were often subject to interfering lights and
 haze, but afforded the best views of ridges where much of the NL
 activity had been previously reported.
 
      The instruments used included two single lens reflex (SLR)
 cameras, a 16mm motion picture camera, a 35mm range finder camera,
 a compass spin detector, recording magnetometer, standard time
 receiver and tape recorder.  Other instruments for measuring
 nuclear radiation, infrared radiation, ultrasonic sound and
 frequency references were available, but not normally deployed.
 
      One of the SLR cameras was fitted with a 500mm, f8
 catadioptric design lens.  This camera/lens combination had a 5
 degree field of view and served as the primary instrument for recording
 visible light data (Slide No. 4).
 
      The motion picture camera was normally fitted with an 18-86mm,
 f2.7 zoom lens, but could be operated with the same 500mm lens used
 on the still camera. The second SLR camera was equipped with a 55mm
 lens and replica grating to permit recording of spectral data.
 (Slide No. 5, right).  These three cameras used Kodak High speed
 Ektachrome, Type B (EFB) film.
 
      EFB film was selected because of its high exposure index, good
 resolution characteristics and reasonable exposure latitude.  It
 was also found that the "B" emulsion gave the best color balance
 under night exposure conditions.
 
      The range finder camera (Slide No. 5, left) was loaded with
 black and white Kodak High Speed infrared film and equipped with a
 Wrattan 89B filter.  This camera could record radiation in the
 near-infrared spectrum (wavelengths 750 to 900 nanometers).
 
      The standard time receiver picked-up National Bureau of
 standards time signals and served as a time reference for
 measurements.  An electronic compass spin detector was also
 deployed during the observation periods.  Signals from both devices
 were fed into the tape recorder, along with the observer's
 commentary.  The latter instruments are shown in a typical field
 set-up in Slide No. 6.
 
      An automatic recording magnetometer, designed and built by the
 San Diego section of the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization
 (APRO), was also used during the field study period.  This device
 required some initial setup, but afterwards was capable of
 unattended operation.  Its primary features were high sensitivity
 to changes in magnetic flux, wide frequency response (to 1000 Hz)
 and the ability to detect rotational force vectors of possible
 paramagnetic nature.
 
 
 OBSERVATIONS OF NL ACTIVITY MADE DURING THE STUDY PERIOD
 
      A number of observations of apparent NL activity were made by
 this investigator during the field study period.  Many of them were
 recorded on film.  This section catalogs the sightings
 chronologically.  Slides which are applicable to the particular
 observation are referenced by number.  All time is recorded in
 Greenwich Mean Time, 24 hour format.  All dates are given at
 location.  Headings from observation points are magnetic (add 20
 degrees for true headings).
 
 OBSERVATION I
 Date: 8-20-72
 Observer Location:  Point 1 (Figure I)
 Activity Location:  Point A (Figure I)
 
      One luminous, round light was observed at 0415 on a bearing of
 240 degrees  from the observer.  It was joined by another similar
 light at 0437.  They were at an elevation of 10-20  and well below
 the ridge of the hills.  Their apparent location was north of Hunt
 Creek and west of the Job corps camp, at an estimated distance of 19
 statute miles.  Topography of the area is rugged, dry hills.
 
      Sky at the time of the first observation was Partially
 overcast in cumulus, with openings to the south and overhead.  The
 moon was high in the sky and intermittently visible through the
 overcast.  Temperature was about 65 degrees F and surface wind was
 from the NW at between 0 and 5 mph during the observation period.
 
      The two objects were apparently round, with a reddish-orange
 glow and no clearly defined outline.  The diffuse glow was evenly
 distributed over the surface of each object and no discontinuities
 were visible.  The light flickered noticeably, in much the same way
 as a flare might look when subjected to a strong wind.  The object
 would appear and disappear as if being switched "on" and "off".
 Color hue and saturation appeared to remain constant as the light
 flickered, but perceived size appeared to change.
 
      Movement of the objects was erratic and discontinuous.  They
 appeared to move independently, circling and changing places in
 relation to one another.
 
      The lights operated below the ridge of the hill at all times
 during the observation.  They were last seen at approximately 0510.
 Intensities gradually diminished and time between "on" cycles
 became longer until they were no longer visible.
 
      Four slides were obtained during the observation period.  The
 camera was stationary during the whole sequence.  Slide Nos. 7-10
 were taken at 0437:48, 0438:16, 0439:35 and 0432:46, respectively.
 Exposure was ฌ second through the 500mm, f8 lens.  The film (EFB)
 was processed for its normal, ASA 125 rating.  Slide No. 11 is an
 enlargement of Slide No. 8.  Note the presence of two objects on
 this slide.
 
      The unusual kinematics and physical appearance of these
 objects strongly indicates that they did not arise from mundane
 causes, such as car or motorcycle lights.
 
 
 OBSERVATION II
 Date : 8-21-72
 Observer Location:  Point 2 (Figure I)
 Activity Location:  Points B and C (Figure I)
 
      Equipment was set up in a field west of the intersection of
 Wesley and Branch Roads, northwest of White Swan.  This location
 was chosen in an attempt to get closer to the activity observed on
 the previous night.  At 0405, what appeared to be automobile tail
 lights were seen moving on a heading of 20 degrees from the observation
 point (Point 8 of Figure I).  No headlights were visible.
 
      The red lights appeared to be near the base of the hill, at an
 estimated distance of 5ซ miles.   (Note: There is a road in this area.)
 The tail lights stopped moving and, shortly thereafter, two
 luminous, amber "balls" came rapidly down from near the top of
 Ahthanum Ridge, circled around each other and approached the red
 lights.  All of the lights next went out, suddenly and
 simultaneously.  The whole observation lasted less than two minutes
 and no sounds were heard.
 
      At 0512, two "vehicles" with red lights were observed moving
 rapidly up and down the hill side, approximately 10 degrees to the
 left of the first observation.
 
      Their distance was again about 5 miles from the observer.
 Each "vehicle" had what appeared to be an amber headlight which
 swept rapidly back and forth over the ground ahead of its path.
 The actual source of the "headlight" was never seen, regardless of
 whether the object was going up or down the hill.  Only
 the beam cast on the ground by this "headlight" and the red light
 were visible.  The objects appeared to move independently of each
 other and traversed the distance from near the base of the hill to
 the top of the ridge (approximately 900 ft. of elevation), at an
 angle of 60 degrees to horizontal in less than ten seconds.
 
      Again, no sound was heard.  The objects disappeared from view
 about ten minutes later.  Weather was almost completely overcast
 with cumulus clouds,  Openings in the overcast could be seen to the
 northwest and southwest.  A thunderstorm was building to the
 southeast.
 
      Another object appeared on a bearing of 270 degrees at 0619
 (Point C on Figure I).  It was a large brownish-orange ball,
 apparently positioned above Rattlesnake Ridge.  It might have been
 taken for a planet except for the fact that it was under the overcast.
 It appeared to flicker slightly and remained stationary.
 
      The object disappeared in the observer's field of vision, as
 if it were a light being turned-off.  Estimated time for this
 observation was five minutes.
 
 
 OBSERVATION III
 Date :  8-22-72
 Observation Location:  Point 3 (Figure I)
 Activity Location:  Point D (Figure I)
 
      A luminous orange ball, similar to the one observed on 8-20-72
 was seen at 0352 on a bearing of 250 degrees from the observation Point,
 This object appeared to be stationary and was near the base of the
 hill.  It blinked on and off several times.  Slide No. 12 was
 taken with a ฌ second exposure through the 500mm, f8 lens.  Again,
 EFB film was used and processed for normal ASA.  The top of the
 ridge is shown and a mercury vapor street lamp appears at the lower
 left of the frame.  The unknown object is to the right.  Slide No.
 13 is an enlargement of the mercury vapor light and object.
 (Note:  Chromatic aberration in this slide is a result of the copy
 process.)
 
      The light was closer in color to white than orange.  It was
 difficult to determine whether the object in this case was a
 motorcycle headlamp or "genuine" NL.  The source appears to be too
 bright and large for a motorcycle headlamp.
 
 
 OBSERVATION IV
 Date:  8-24-72
 Observer Location:  Point 5 (Figure I)  Satus Fire Lookout
 Activity Location:  Point E (Figure I) Piscoe Meadow
 
      At 0510, the investigator and fire lookout spotted one (?)
 bright white light moving very rapidly through a wooded area
 southeast of Piscoe Meadow (bearing approximately 358 degrees true).
 Distance to the sighting area was about 18 miles.
 
      The light moved so fast that it gave the impression of a
 streak.  It would appear stationary for a moment, then, almost
 instantaneously, appear some distance away (typically 10 degrees
 of arc through 7x50 binoculars).  After another brief pause, it
 would dart back in the opposite direction.  When stationary, the
 object appeared through the binoculars as an intense pinpoint of
 white light.
 
      The sky was clear and the moon was rising, but there was
 considerable haze in the valley.  All car lights observed this
 evening had an orange cast.  The observation lasted about one
 minute and no photographs were obtained.
 
      A radio message from an observer in the valley was received at
 0730.  He asked the fire lookout if the investigator was "up and
 around."  The lookout's reply was affirmative and the transmission
 was terminated.
 
      The following day it was learned that the observer in the
 valley had spotted a tan or light orange, slow moving light from
 the freeway near the town of Parker (18 miles NE of the lookout).
 It moved slowly down the valley to the town of White Swan, turned
 and appeared to move directly over the Satus lookout.  It next
 turned and headed east, where it disappeared behind Toppenish
 Mountain.
 
      The person in the valley assumed that the observer at the fire
 lookout could not have missed the object and he did not want to
 make any direct mention of the object over the radio.
 
      Nothing was seen from the observation point at Satus lookout
 before or after the radio message.  There was no reasonable way the
 light could have been missed by the investigator and the fire
 lookout.  Yet, nothing was seen.  The observer in the valley is
 known to be extremely reliable and there is no reason to doubt his
 word.  This "non-observation" rates very high on the strangeness
 scale.
 
 
 OBSERVATION V
 Date:  8-26-72
 Observer Location:  Point 5 (Figure I) Satus Fire Lookout
 Activity Location:  Point F (Figure I) near Dry creek
 
      Intermittent lights were observed along the ridge southeast of
 Satus Lookout for much of the night.  They seemed to appear and
 disappear at random and were thought to have been lights from cars
 or campers.  sky was clear with bright moonlight.  Haze was
 moderate in the lower elevations.
 
      A 2.5 minute time exposure was taken of the area between 0845
 and 0847 with the 500mm, f8 lens and EFB film.  Slide No. 14 is the
 result.  The two(?) lights appearing on the slide were not seen
 during exposure.  Note that the microwave antenna on the relay
 station also appears dimly in the left hand foreground of the
 picture.  Slide No. 15 is an enlargement of No. 14.
 
      The closest ridge from the point where the slide was taken is
 about 5ซ miles away.  Knowing the distance to the ridge and angle
 of view of the lens (5 degree), it should be possible to determine
 whether or not the light source was a car.  Further analysis of
 this slide is needed.
 
 
 OBSERVATION VI
 Date:  8-31-72
 Observer Location:  Point 1 (Figure I)
 Activity Location:  Point C (Figure I) At first observation
 
      A luminous ball, identical in color and kinematics to that
 observed on 8-20-72 was seen at 0518 on a bearing of 240 degrees
 from the observation point.  The object moved through an arc of
 about 10 to 15  in three minutes.  It appeared to follow the hills,
 about ll miles away, and was situated vertically about half of the way
 between the base and top of Ahtanum Ridge.
 
      Slide No. 16 is a 60 second time exposure made through the
 500mm, f8 lens.  Slide No. 17 is an enlargement of No. 16.  Note
 how the object appears to move in "spurts" or flicker (there were
 no known obstructions between the object and camera during the
 exposure).
 
      The object was seen briefly again by this investigator at
 0739.  It was apparently on or near the side of the hill, directly
 below and in line with a microwave tower 8ซ miles due north of the
 observation point (Point G).  The object was clearly visible
 through binoculars and appeared as a sharply defined,
 brownish-orange disc.  It gave the impression of being flat and the
 ground near it could be seen illuminated by the glow.  The object
 disappeared by "turning-off" before the camera could be trained on
 it.  The foregoing observations could not be accounted for in
 normal terms.  One additional observer verified the sighting.
 
 
 SUMMARY
 
      The primary objective of demonstrating the feasibility of the
 "stake-out" technique of UFO field investigation appears to have
 been met during the study period.  Nocturnal light activity was
 observed and recorded on film.  Unfortunately, the closest activity
 was at a distance of about eight miles.
 
      The long working distance did not permit the acquisition of
 any physical data other than a few slides.  However, given the
 technical and position data available, it should be possible to
 arrive at a reasonable estimate of the size, light output and form
 of the objects observed.  It is in this area that primary effort is
 needed.
 
      This investigator is satisfied that genuine NL activity has
 been and is still taking place on a more or less regular basis in
 the Toppenish area.  However, there was nothing in the nocturnal
 light observations made during the study which would suggest
 conclusively that the source of the activity is extra terrestrial.
 On the other hand, something very unusual is taking place.  The
 problem warrants continued very careful and objective examination.
 
      A few words should be said concerning the measurements -- or
 lack of measurements -- made during the study period:  One camera
 was responsible for all of the "hard" data obtained,  The only
 other camera capable of working at the distances involved was the
 16mm camera/500mm lens combination.  It was discovered early,
 however, that the motion picture camera could not be aimed
 with the very dim light available.  The reason is that the reflex
 viewing system in the camera, utilizing a half-silvered prism, did
 not transmit enough light to the viewfinder.  (The camera has since
 been fitted with an auxiliary viewfinder.)
 
      All of the NL activity was too far away to permit
 spectrograms, because of the relatively short focal length lenses
 required by the replica grating.  Additional work is being done on
 spectrograph instrumentation which will allow working longer
 distances.
 
      The use of the tape recorder for commentary and time logging
 was invaluable in determining the times at which photographs were
 made and recalling details of observations.  A great deal of
 information would have been lost without the time and recording
 equipment.
 
      There were no abnormal magnetic disturbances sensed by
 instruments at any time during the study period.  The compass spin
 detector was deployed most of the time during observation periods
 and no anomalous compass deflections were sensed.  The recording
 magnetometer was used less than the compass spin detector, because
 of its extreme sensitivity to normal magnetic disturbances.  The
 instrument appears to have potential, however, and a separate
 report dealing with the instrument will be forthcoming.
 
      In conclusion, a great deal in the line of hard, practical
 experience has been gained from this study.  It was learned what
 things would work - what would not.  Hopefully, the mistakes made
 during this initial study period can be avoided in the next.
 
      At any rate, study of the activity in the Toppenish area will
 continue indefinitely until some explanation for the phenomena
 there is obtained.
 
      All material collected during the study period, including the
 original slides, is available for inspection by any qualified
 investigator.  Questions, suggestions and comments will be
 welcomed.

 APPENDIX A
 SUMMARY OF REPORTS FOR THE PORTION OF 1972 PRIOR TO THE FIELD STUDY
 
 
 1.   Date: June 7, 1972 -- Between 9:30 and 12:30 am local time
      Activity location: South fork of Toppenish Canyon (7 miles
      from the observer)
 
      Summary:
         Spherical shaped object going up and down,
         bouncing.  Had a bluish "metal-flake blue") sheen and was at
         least 30 to 40 feet across.  Disappeared with big flash of
         light arcing into air.  Weather was towering cumulus with 7%
         cloud cover.  Wind from SW at  5 mph (2:00 pm reading).
         Visibility was 12 miles.  Cloud-to-cloud lightning observed
         after 2 pm.  Note: Pet dog reacted strangely, as if its ears
         were hurting, for approximately one hour on the evening
         following the observation.  Nothing was visible on the latter
         occasion.
 
 
 2.   Date: June 29, 1972 -- 10:20 pm local time
      Activity location: Red Butte
 
      Summary:
         Object sat for about 10 minutes.  "Kind of pear-
         shaped" with fairly  sharp outline.  About four minutes before
         it moved, yellow, red and green lights were observed.  The
         object was sitting motionless and then shot straight up to a
         high altitude.  Object next shot straight east.  Sharp angular
         motion and very high speed.  Weather was clear, with variable
         westerly wind.  Visibility was 17 miles.
 
 
 3.   Date: July 31, 1972 -- 9:05 pm local time
      Activity location: South slope of Shinando Canyon
 
      Summary:
         Baseball sized, very white light floating along just
         below tree top level.  No noise as object moved slowly from
         west to east.  Observer was above the tree tops in the canyon
         and above the object.  Distance to the object was less than
         one-half mile.
 
 
 4.   Date: August 2, 1972 -- 9:10 pm local time
      Activity location: Yego Pasture
 
      Summary:
         Big "blob" with no definite shape.  Observed for
         ten minutes before it shot straight up, made an
         instantaneous turn and shot north,  Weather clear, NE wind.
         Humidity 35 and lower, with 15 mile visibility,
 
 
 5.   Date: August 3, 1972 -- between 10:00 and 11:15 pm
      Activity location:  NE of fire lookout (Satus)
 
      Summary:
         Big, white, bright "thing", something like a cloud
         came and went.  It would appear dim, then become brighter
         and brighter, and then. "like something melting fast",
         disappear.  Angle of elevation was 300 and object was fairly
         close to lookout.  Bright streaks or rays came from the object
         and lighted up the interior of the lookout, making things
         inside visible,  The sky was dark above and below the object.
         Size of the object was estimated to be as large as the lookout
         (about 12x12x8 feet).  No moon was visible.
 
 
 6.   Date:  August 11, 1972 -- 12:30 pm local time
      Activity location:  1000 to 2000 feet above observer
 
      Summary:
         Hemispherical object with multicolored, stippled
         streamers observed below cloud cover.  Observed less than a
         minute and disappeared almost instantaneously into clouds.
 
 
 7.   Date:  August 15, 1972 -- 11:00 pm
      Activity location:  T9, R19, Sec 22  26' (approximately)
 
      Summary:
         Three bright lights on top of butte.  Described as
         pure white and very intense balls.  Observed for two hours.
