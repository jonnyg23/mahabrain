                          and Other Strange Occurrences of
                                      The Past

        The Indian Epics,  especially the MAHABHARATA, pick up the thread of
        the tale of devastation and destruction. Atlantis, rather displeased
        at its humiliating  defeat,  deceived   that  they  were  no  longer
        interested in subjugating  the Rama Empire (An Indian  Empire),  and
        decided instead to annihilate the major cities using weapons of mass
        destruction. Sanskrit scholars  could  not comprehend what was being
        described in the Epics until the dropping  of the first atomic bombs
        on Japan. There are AUTHENTIC VERSES from the Indian Epics:
 
           "Gurkha, flying a swift and powerful vimana (fast aircraft)
           hurled a single projectile (rocket) charged with the power
           of the Universe (nuclear device). An incandescent column of
           smoke and flame, as bright as ten thousand suns, rose with
           all its splendor.
 
           It was an unknown weapon, an iron thunderbolt, a gigantic
           messenger of death, which reduced to ashes the entire race
           of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas.
 
           The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable.
           Hair and nails fell out; Pottery broke without apparent cause,
           and the birds turned white.
 
           ...After a few hours all foodstuffs were infected...
           ...to escape from this fire the soldiers threw
           themselves in streams to wash themselves and their
           equipment."
                                                컴 The Mahabharata
 
        Indeed, this story is said to be nearly 24,000 years old! If this is
        true than we are not the most advanced. As the Bible says "There is
        nothing new under   the   sun."  Evidence  for  Atlantis   is   well
        documented.
 
        If the above was not enough to convince your let me take you in

        deeper into this nuclear war:
 
           "(It was a weapon) so powerful that it could destroy the earth
            in an instant 컴 A great soaring sound in smoke and flames 컴
            And on its sits death..."
                                                컴 The Ramayana
 
           "Dense arrows of flame, like a great shower, issued
            forth upon creation, encompassing the enemy...
            A thick gloom swiftly settled upon the Pandava hosts.
            All points of the compass were lost in darkness.
            Fierce wind began to blow upward, showering dust and gravel.
 
           Birds croaked madly... the very elements seemed disturbed.
           The earth  shook,  scorched  by the terrible violent heat of this
           weapon.
           Elephants burst into flame and ran to and fro in a frenzy...
           over a vast area, other animals crumpled to the ground and died.
           From all  points  of  the compass  the  arrows  of  flame  rained
           continuously and fiercely.
                                                컴 The Mahabharata
 
        The Ramayana and  the  Mahabharata seem like science  fiction.   Not
        only did aircraft exist such as Vimanas and Vailxi (as the Atlantian
        craft are called),  they  had  nuclear  weapons. There seems to be a
        fear of educating the worlds people  about  the  distant past.  Even
        empires and leaders of China's past to Christians  to  Arab  peoples
        would destroy history  in  such  a way that records of there amazing
        cultures and events are nearly all  wiped  out. Indian Epics however
        are still with us intact. Records of South American  history all but
        gone.  Fear, and  other  factors have removed most of history before
        5,000 years. Some only 1,000 years  ago. In the America's just 300 -
        500 years all  most all lost! Today, perhaps some  UFO  records  are
        going the way of fears gate! However, again a few stories live on.
 
        In another amazing  Indian  text  the  Agastrya  Samhita  gives  the
        precise directions for constructing electrical batteries:
 
                "Place a well-cleaned copper plate in an earthenware vessel.
                Cover it first by copper  sulfate  and  then  moist sawdust.
                After that put a mercury-amalgamated-zinc sheet on top of
                an energy known by the twin name of Mitra-Varuna. Water will
                be split  by  this current into Pranavayu and  Udanavayu.  A
                chain of one hundred jars is said to give a very active
                and effective force."
                                                컴 Agastya Samhita
                                                   (Indian Princes' Library)
 
        By the way,  MITRA-VARUNA is now called cathode-anode, and Pranavayu
        and Udanavayu are to us oxygen and hydrogen. This document again
        demonstrates the presence of electricity  in  the  East,  long, long
        ago.  In the  not  so distant past strange events  are  recorded  in
        Europe's past.
 
        At Mount Cassino in Italy there is a large and heavy stone which was
        traditionally lifted by   Saint   Benedict  (A.D.  448-548)  by  the
        neutralization of gravity.  This stone  was intended for the wall of
        the monastery being  built at that time. The stonemasons  could  not
        budge it. However, Saint Benedict made the sign of the cross on the
 
                                       Page 2
 
 
 
 
 
        block, and while  the  seven  men  who  could  not lift it looked in
        amazement, he raised it alone without  any effort.  If this is true,
        than its evidence of God's hand at work!
 
        Even stranger is this: King Ferdinand I was a host  to Saint Francis
        of Paula (1416-1505)  in  Naples.  Through  a  half-opened  door  he
        witnessed the monk in meditation,  floating  high above the floor of
        his room.
 
        Again in the fairly long ago past in China Emperor Cheng Tang (1766
        B.C.), ordered Ki-Kung-shi  to  construct  a  flying   chariot.  The
        primeval aviation constructor  completed  the  job  and  tested  the
        aircraft. In flight, reaching the  province  of Honan. Subsequently,
        (from fear) the vessel was destroyed by imperial edict as Cheng Tang
        feared the secret of its mechanism might fall into the wrong hands.
        If one looks at the past he can foresee and even change the future.
        Will we be  faithful  to  God  as  the  saints and lift  objects  or
        ourselves by Gods  power?  Will we ever come to full out Nuclear War
        as the people of Atlantis and Rama 24,000 years ago?
 
        Will we build  Flying Chariots (Flying  Saucers)  and  destroy  them
        because we fear into what hands they will fall?  What will man do to
        destroy his past, present or future?  I leave that  question  up  to
        you!!!
