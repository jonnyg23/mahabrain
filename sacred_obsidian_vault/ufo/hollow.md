 The kingdom of this inner society is called Agharta with the
 main-city of Shamballa. Those places referenced in the image above,
 lie inward and have also an inward sky with clouds.
 The Central Sun is inside of Earth.

 Mato Grosso  (Brazil)
 Iguassu Falls
 Mount Epomeo (Italy)
 Pyramid of Giza (Egypt)
 King Solomos Mines
 Dero Caves
 
 The most strange hint is given, that the Center of Gravity is not
 the center of Earth, but also a sub-sphere or a layer quite 200 miles
 below of the surface we live.
 
 It follows some excerpts and views of the Hollow Earth:
 
 In The Inner Earth
 
 On February 19, 1947, Admiral Richard
 E. Byrd left Base Camp Artic and flew
 northward.
 
 What happened on that flight?
 
 For years rumors have persisted that on
 his historic flight to the North Pole, Admiral
 Byrd flew heyond the Pole into an
 opening leading inside the Earth. Here he
 met with advaneed heings who had a sobering
 message for him to deliver to Mankind an the
 Surface World.
 
 Upon Byld's return to Washington, on
 Marrh 11, 1947 he was interviewed intently
 by top security forces and a medical
 team. He was placed under strict control
 and ordered to remain silent on the behalf
 of humanity. Being a militaly man, he felt
 he had to comply.
 
 Here, from Admiral Byrd's secret log
 and diary, is the message meant to have
 been heard 45 years ago!
 
 Excerpt of The Hollow Earth (no ISBN):
 
     "During his Arctic flight of 1,700 miles BEYOND the North Pole
 he reported by radio that he saw below him, not ice and snow, but
 land areas consisting of mountains, forests, green vegetation, lakes
 and rivers, and in the underbrush saw a strange animal resembling
 the mammoth...."
 
     "In January, 1956, Admiral Byrd led another expedition to the
 Antarctic and there penetrated for 2,300 miles BEYOND  the South
 Pole.  The radio announcement at this time (January 13, 1956) said:
 "On January 13, members of the United stated expedition penetrated a
 land extent of 2,300 miles BEYOND the Pole.  The Flight was made by
 Rear Admiral George Dufek of the United States Navy Air Unit."
 Byrd said on March 13, 1956, "The present expedition has opened up a
 vast new land."
 
     Admiral Byrd said in February, 1947 before his North Pole flight,
 "I'd like to see that land beyond the Pole.  That area beyond the
 Pole is the center of the great unknown."
 
 ...
 
 Excerpt of A Flight to the Land Beyond the North Pole:
 
 "I bid you welcome to our domain, Admiral." I see a man
 with delicate features and with the etching of years upon his
 face. He is seated at a long table. He motions me to sit down
 in one of the chairs. After I am seated, he places his fingertips
 together and smiles. He speaks softly again, and conveys the
 following. "We have let you enter here because you are of noble
 character and well-known on the Surface World, Admiral."
 
 "Surface World," I half-gasp under my breath! "Yes," the
 Master replies with a smile, "you are in the domain of the Arianni,
 the Inner World of the Earth. We shall not long delay
 your mission, and you will be safely escorted back to the surface
 and for a distance beyond. But now. Admiral, I shall tell
 you why you have been summoned here. Our interest rightly
 begins just after your race exploded the first atomic bombs
 over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. It was at that alarming
 time we sent our flying machines, the 'Flugelrads,' to your
 surface world to investigate what your race had done.
 "That is, of course, past history now, my dear Admiral, but
 I must continue on. You see, we have never interfered before
 in your race's wars, and barbarity, but now we must, for you
 have leamed to tamper with a certain power that is not for
 man, namely, that of atomic energy. Our emissaries have already
 delivered messages to the powers of your world, and
 yet they do not heed. Now you have been chosen to be witness
 here that our world does exist. You see, our culture and
 science is many thousands of years beyond your race, Admiral."
 I interrupted, "But what does this have to do with me,
 Sir?"
 
 The master's eyes seemed to penetrate deeply into my
 mind, and after studying me for a few moments he replied,
 "Your race has now reached the point of no return, for there
 are those among you who would destroy your very world
 rather than relinquish their power as they
 know it..."
 
 I nodded, and the Master continued. "In
 1945 and afterward, we tried to contact
 I your race, but our efforts were met with
 hostility. Our Flugelrads were fired upon,
 yes, even pursued with malice and animosity
 by your fighter planes. So, now, I say to
 you, my son, there is a great storm gathering
 in your world, a black fury that will not
 spend itself for many years. There will be
 no answer in your armies, there will be no
 safety in your science. It may rage on until
 every flower of your culture is trampled
 and all human things are leveled in vast
 chaos.
 
 "Your recent war was only a prelude of
 what is yet to come for your race. We here
 see it more clearly with each hour...do you
 say I am mistaken?"
 
 "No," I answer," it happened once before, the Dark Ages
 came and they lasted for more than five hundred years."
 "Yes, my son," replied the Master, "the Dark Ages that
 will come now for your race will cover the Earth like a pall,
 but I believe that some of your race will live through the
 storm, beyond that, I cannot say. We see at a great distance a
 new world stirring from the ruins of your race, seeking its lost
 and legendary treasures, and they will be here, my son, safe in
 our keeping. When that time arrives, we shall come forward
 again to help revive your culture and your race.
 
 "Perhaps, by then, you will have learned the futility of war
 and its strife...and after that time, certain of your culture and
 science will be returned for your race to begin anew. You, my
 son, are to return to the Surface World with this message..."
 
 With those closing words, our meeting seemed at an end. I
 stood for a moment as in a dream...but, yet, I knew this was
 reality, and for some strange reason I bowed slightly, either
 out of respect or humility, I do not know which.
 
 Suddenly, I was again aware that the two beautiful hosts
 who had brought me here were again at my side. "This way,
 Admiral," motioned one. I turned once more before leaving
 and looked back toward the Master. A gentle smile was
 etched on his delicate ancient face. "Farewell, my son," he
 spoke, then he gestured with a lovely, slender hand a motion
 of peace and our meeting was truly ended.
 
 Quickly, we walked back through the great door of the
 Master's chamber and once again entered into the elevator.
 The door slid silently downward and we were at once going
 upward. One of my hosts' spoke again, "We must now make
 haste, Admiral, as the Master desires to delay you no longer
 on your schedule timetable and you must return with his mes-
 sage to your race."

 Secrets of the Subterranean Cities
 
 World Ascension Network
 
    Recently, America watched Stephen Spielberg's TV pilot, a
 remake  of  Verne' s "Journey to the Center of the Earth." A
 maverick team of scientists  aboard  their  melt-proof  ship
 enter  the  inner  Earth  through  a  bubbling volcano. When
 things cool off, they find themselves exploring a  vast  and
 sunny  inner  landscape . . . a  magical and inviting world with
 ample room to fly.
 
 	Their  adventure  resembles  the  real life account of a
 Norwegian sailor named Olaf Jansen. His story, set in the  1800s,
 is  told  in Willis Emerson's biography entitled "The
 Smoky God." Olaf's little sloop  drifted  so  far  north  by
 storm  that  he  actually  sailed  into a polar entrance and
 lived for two years with one of the colonies of the  Agartha
 Network,  called  "Shamballa  the  Lesser." He describes his
 hosts as those "of the central seat of  government  for  the
 inner continent . . . measuring a full 12 feet in
 height . . . extending courtesies and showing
 kindness . . . laughing  heartily  when  they  had  to improvise
 chairs for my father and I to  sit  in."  Olaf  tells  of  a
 "smoky"  inner  sun, a world comprised of three-fourths land
 and one-fourth water.
 
 The Agartha Network
 
 	Think  of  Shamballa the Lesser as the United Nations of
 over 100 subterranean cities that form the Agartha  Network.
 It  is,  indeed, the seat of government for the inner world.
 While Shamballa  the  Lesser  is  an  inner  continent,  its
 satellite  colonies  are smaller enclosed ecosystems located
 just  beneath  the  Earth' s  crust  or   discreetly  within
 mountains.  All  cities  in the Agartha Network are physical
 and are of the Light, meaning that they are tradition of the
 great  mystery  schools of the surface, honoring such beings
 as Jesus/Sananda,  Buddha,  Isis  and  Osiris . . . all  of  the
 Ascended  Masters  that  we of the surface know and love, in
 addition to spiritual teachers of  their  own  long-standing
 heritage.
 
 	Why  did  they  choose to live underground? Consider the
 magnitude of the geological Earth changes  that  have  swept
 the  surface  over  the  past  100,000  years.  Consider the
 lengthy   Atlantean-Lemurian   war    and    the   power  of
 thermonuclear  weaponry  that  eventually sank and destroyed
 these two highly advanced  civilizations.  The  Sahara,  the
 Gobi,  the  Australian  Outback and the deserts of the U.S .
 are but a few examples of the devastation that resulted. The
 sub-cities  were  created  as  refuges for the people and as
 safe havens for sacred records, teachings  and  technologies
 that were cherished by these ancient cultures.
 
 Capitol Cities
 
    POSID: Primary Atlantean  outpost,  located  beneath  the
 Mato   Grosso   plains  region  of  Brazil.  Population: 1.3
 million.
 
    SHONSHE: Refuge of the Uighur culture, a  branch  of  the
 Lemurians  who chose to form their own colonies 50,000 years
 ago.  Entrance  is   guarded   by  a   Himalayan   lamasery.
 Population: 3/4 million.
 
    RAMA:  Remnant of the surface city of Rama, India located
 near Jaipur. Inhabitants are known for their  classic  Hindu
 features. Population: 1 million.
 
    SHINGWA:   Remnant   of  the  northern  migration  of the
 Uighurs. Located on the border of Mongolia and China. with a
 small   secondary  city  in  Mt.  Lassen,  California. Telos
 translated means "communication  with  Spirit."  Population:
 1.5 million.
 
 Spotlight on Telos
 
 	How can over a million people make their home inside Mt.
 Shasta?   While   we're   stretching  our  imaginations, our
 neighbors,   the   Japanese,   have   already    blueprinted
 underground  cities in answer to their surface area problem.
 Sub-city habitation has, for  thousands  of  years,  been  a
 natural  vehicle for human evolution. Now, here is a peek at
 a well-thought-out ecosystem.
 
 	The dimensions of this domed city are approximately  1.5
 miles  wide by 2 miles deep. Telos is comprised of 5 levels.
 
 LEVEL 1: This top  level  is  the  center  of  commerce,
 education  and  administration. The pyramid-shaped temple is
 the  central  structure  and  has a   capacity   of  50,000.
 Surrounding it are government buildings, the equivalent of a
 courthouse that promotes  an  enlightened  judicial  system,
 halls of records, arts and entertainment facilities, a hotel
 for visiting foreign emissaries, a palace which  houses  the
 "Ra  and  Rana Mu" (the reigning King and Queen of the royal
 Lemurian lineage who are Ascended Masters), a communications
 tower,  a  spaceport,  schools, food and clothing dispatches
 and most residences.
 
 LEVEL 2: A manufacturing center  as
 well  as  a  residential level. Houses are circular in shape
 and dust-free because of it. Like  surface  living,  housing
 for  singles, couples and extended families is the norm.
 
 LEVEL 3:  Hydroponic  gardens.  Highly  advanced  hydroponic
 technology  feeds  the  entire  city, with some to spare for
 intercity commerce.  All  crops  yield  larger  and  tastier
 fruits,  veggies and soy products that make for a varied and
 fun diet  for  Telosians.  Now  completely  vegetarian,  the
 Agartha  Cities  have taken meat substitutes to new heights.
 
 LEVEL 4: More hydroponic gardens, more manufacturing and
 some  natural park areas.
 
 LEVEL 5: The nature level. Set
 about a mile beneath surface ground level, this  area  is  a
 large natural environment. It serves as a habitat for a wide
 variety of animals, including  those  many  extinct  on  the
 surface.  All  species  have  been  bred  in  a  non-violent
 atmosphere, and those  that  might  be  carnivorous  on  the
 surface now enjoy soy steaks and human interaction. Here you
 can romp  with a  Saber-Toothed  Tiger  with  wild  abandon.
 Together  with  the  other  plant  levels,  enough oxygen is
 produced to sustain the biosphere.
 
    LANGUAGE:  While dialects vary from city to city, "Solara
 Maru," translated  as  the  "Solar  Language,"  is  commonly
 spoken.  This  is the root language for our sacred languages
 such  as  Sanskrit  and  Hebrew.
 
 GOVERNMENT: A  Council  of
 Twelve, six men and six women, together with the Ra and Rana
 Mu, do collective problem solving and serve  as  guides  and
 guardians  of  the  people. Positions of royalty such as are
 held by  the  Ra  and  Rana  Mu  are  regarded  as  ones  of
 responsibility  in  upholding  God'  s divine plan. The High
 Priest, an Ascended Master named Adama, is also an  official
 representative.
 
    COMPUTERS:  The  Agarthean  computer system is amino-acid
 based and serves a vast  array  of  functions.  All  of  the
 sub-cities   are   linked   by   this  highly  spiritualized
 information network.  The  system  monitors  inter-city  and
 galactic  communication,  while, simultaneously, serving the
 needs of the individual  at  home.  It  can,  for  instance,
 report  your body's vitamin or mineral deficiencies or, when
 necessary, convey pertinent  information  from  the  akashic
 records   for   personal  growth.
 
 MONEY:  Non-existent. All
 inhabitants' basic needs are taken  care  of.  Luxuries  are
 exchanged via a sophisticated barter system.
 
 TRANSPORTATION:
 Moving sidewalks, inter-level elevators and  electromagnetic
 sleds  resembling  our  snow  mobiles  within  the city. For
 travel  between  cities,  residents  take  "the   Tube,"  an
 electromagnetic  subway system capable of speeds up to 3,000
 m.p.h. Yes, Agartheans  are  well  versed  in  intergalactic
 etiquette  and  are members of the Confederation of Planets.
 Space travel has been perfected,  as  has  the  ability  for
 interdimensional    shifts    that    render    these  ships
 undetectable.
 
 ENTERTAINMENT: Theatre,  concerts  and a  wide
 variety  of the arts. Also, for you Trekkies, the Holodecks.
 Program your favorite movie or chapter in Earth history  and
 become  a  part  of it!
 
 CHILDBIRTH: A painless three months,
 not nine. A very sacred process whereby, upon conception,  a
 woman  will  go  to  the  temple for three days, immediately
 welcoming the  child  with  beautiful  music,  thoughts  and
 imagery.  Water  birthing  in the company of both parents is
 standard.
 
 HEIGHT:  Due  to  cultural  differences,  average
 heights  of  subterranean  citizens  vary. Generally 6'5" to
 7'5" in Telos, while nearly 12'  in  Shamballa  the  Lesser.
 
    AGE: Unlimited. Death by degeneration  is  simply  not  a
 reality  in  Telos.  Most  Agartheans  choose to look an age
 between 30 and 40 and stay there, while,  technically,  they
 may  be  thousands  of years old. By not believing in death,
 this society is not limited by it. Upon completing a desired
 experience,   one   can  disincarnate  at  will.
 
 ASCENSION: Absolutely, and much easier and  more  common  than  on  the
 surface. Ascension is the ultimate goal of temple training.
 
 	Why have they stayed underground all this time? In part,
 because  the Agartheans have learned the futility of war and
 violence and are patiently waiting for us to draw  the  same
 conclusion.   They   are  such  gentle  folk  that  even our
 judgemental thoughts are physically harmful to them. Secrecy
 has  been  their  protection.  Until now, the truth of their
 existence has been veiled by Spirit. When can we visit?  Our
 entrance  to  the  sub-cities  depends  on the purity of our
 intentions and our  capacity  to  think  positively. A  warm
 welcome  from both worlds is the ideal and must be expressed
 by more than just the lightworking community.
 
 	Currently, a few hundred brave subterraneans are working
 on the surface. In order to blend with the masses, they have
 undergone temporary cellular  change  so  that,  physically,
 they   don't   tower  above  the  rest  of  us.  They may be
 recognized by their gentle, sensitive  nature  and  somewhat
 mysterious  accent.  We  wish  to  introduce you to Princess
 Sharula Aurora Dux, the daughter of the Ra and  Rana  Mu  of
 Telos.  Sharula has been officially appointed Ambassador to
 the surface world by the Agartha Network. She is  267  years
 old  and looks 30. This article is courtesy of her firsthand
 experience.
 
 	The purpose of her Ambassadorship is to prepare the  way
 for  the merging of the two worlds . . . to bring the ideas, the
 information and the new archetypes that will help unite  our
 planet. Sharula has come to present a blueprint for peaceful
 change to those who will listen. The Agartheans have reached
 a  point where they cannot progress spiritually unless this
 merger takes place. In essence, we are one planet ascending,
 not  half  a planet. It is God 's will that we take the next
 step together.
 
 	The sooner we invite this unity, the  sooner  the  magic
 will  unfold.  The  Hierarchy  has made the emergence of the
 subterranean cities a priority project. They are  asking  us
 to do our part in welcoming our brethren. The timing depends
 very much upon  our  receptivity  and  our  graciousness.  A
 successful  merger  is  estimated  within  the next 10 to 20
 years.
 
 	Beloved, there is nothing  to  fear  and  everything  to
 gain. The gifts the Agartheans bring are many. The secret of
 immortality is your  birthright.  The  freedom  to  live  in
 abundance  is  also your birthright. You haven't lived until
 you've tasted a hydroponic tomato and had a  little  fun  on
 the Holodeck.
 
 Appendix:
 
 This concept of a Hollow Earth might sounds quite strange
 at the first view, but in context of OBE and
 Astral-Traveling it may get more understandable:
 
 Those inner lying planes (non-physical or semi-physical) hold also life-forms
 as astral-plane hold astral-entities with their own cities and forms.
 
 "Semi-physical" means, physical bodies slighly more subtle as we have, but
 able to live within matter.
 
 Short fragment of a discussion I found on alt.alien.visitors:
 
 StarWolf (roger.myhre@niva.no) 18 Mar 1995 wrote:
 
 Besides if the Earth was hollow, it would have been discovered long ago.
 For the last century several expeditions have been made to the south
 Pole, and none of them have reported any UFO activity, not any holes
 at the South Pole. And you can forget about the North Pole it floats
 on water, which are below the ice.
 
 Mark Hammons (m-hamm@vm1.spcs.umn.edu) 22 Mar 1995 replies:
 
 The earth is hollow in the fourth dimension.  The earth exists as a
 torus in that perspective. There are two "entrances," and these are
 reflected in the physical world as the north and south magnetic poles.
 Note that the physical north pole and the magnetic pole are not
 synonymous in site, but wander in relationship.
 
 Read Bentov's Stalking the Wild Pendulum for a nice easy explanation
 of this phenomenon, which has to do with the mechanics of human
 consciousness, rather than some material opening in the earth.
 
 Excerpt of UFO's, Close Encounter of Positive Kind
 given by Jananda:
 
      Question:   I don't know if this will fit in
 with the talk, but lately there has been a lot of
 news coming out about the inner Earth and
 about the people there and Admiral Bird in the
 early part of this century from Walberg, some
 facility openings at the poles, and that this
 government helps them.  I have been reading a
 lot of books about that lately. That information
 seems to be coming out.  Is there something I
 need to know about inner Earth beings?
 
      Answer:    There are beings living on this
 planet in the inner Earth.  They are not all
 physical.  Only a very few of them are physical.
 They are actually living in the fourth dimension.
 There are many beings living in the inner Earth.
 You don't see them.  We have a another whole
 world just around us here in another dimension.
 We have them.  So there are a lot of inner Earth
 people too.
