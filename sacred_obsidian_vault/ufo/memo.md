                         MEMORANDUM II
 
         An informant I call Beltway Throat (BT), who lives in the shadow of the
 power center of the world (Washington, D.C., in case you thought it was
 Sedona), reports on his recent interview with CHICKADEE of The Aviary, (the
 retired Naval Intelligence Commander C.B. Scott Jones, Ph.D.) Dr. Jones has
 provided BT with additional detail concerning events which The Aviary believe
 are upcoming.
         It seems that the predicted Extraterrestrial Landing on April 24, 1997
 is a precursor to a 1998 series of cataclysms. Furthermore, the 1997 Landing is
 the last chance for the Powers That Be (human governments) to allow their
 populations to know about extraterrestrial visitation; otherwise, the ETs will
 not be available to assist humankind in mitigating and surviving the 1998
 cataclysm series.
         BT says that the U.S. Power Structure is aware of the warnings about
 the 1998 cataclysm series.
         Massive human and planetary destruction is the default course; unless
 we (our governments) invite the ETs to appear openly on Earth, the ETs will not
 be able to prevent/mitigate the 1998 cataclysm series. The ETs want to be
 invited in a peaceful way. They are not going to forcefully impose themselves
 on us.
         BT was not detailed about the nature of the 1998 cataclysm series,
 except to say that it is composed of events partially of technological origin
 and partially of natural causes. When I suggested that the cataclysm series
 could include massive seismic upheavals, increased volcanism, global-warming
 weather extremes and enlarging ozone-hole radiation effects, BT did not dispute
 that view.
         Dr. Jones' opinion is reportedly that the resistance to admitting
 extraterrestrial visitation is significant in the Developed Countries, but that
 The Aviary worries especially about tyrants in Third World countries who would
 violently resist the threat to the status quo (theirs) presented by open
 acknowledgment of extraterrestrial presence.
         Commander Jones reportedly offered two scenarios of how The Aviary
 would deal with the alleged extraterrestrial landing on 04/27/97. Scenario One
 would have a coalition of Insiders (the "MJ-12" leadership, the Aviary, and Las
 Vegas billionaire Robert Bigelow's NIDS Institute) constitute an elite Contact
 Group, who would be self-appointed as Earth's representatives, and negotiate
 with the extraterrestrials during the Landing. (BT did not identify what NIDS
 stood for, and laughed when I humorously suggested NIDS stood for NSA
 Intelligence Disinformation School.) I strongly protested that such an elist
 approach would be repudiated by both humans and the extraterrestrials.
         BT said that Scenario Two would be that a "blue-ribbon panel" be set up
 as the Contact Team to negotiate between ETs and humans. I emphasized, in
 response, that such a blue-ribbon panel would need to be broadly representative
 of the peoples of Earth, and should be democratically selected with world-wide
 membership, such as the U.N. could do. BT sounded diffident that the U.N. would
 undertake such an effort.
         BT said that Dr. Jones shared the rumor that Christ was an ET, and that
 the returning ETs might present the Christ Consciousness figure to the
 christian world. Christians, in turn, might become so taken with the returning
 Christ event that they ignore taking direction from their governmental leaders,
 thus leading to social chaos. I pointed out to BT that the original Christ
 avoided getting involved in the secular government of his day, and advised
 people to "render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's",
 i.e., acknowledged that government had its place.
         Beltway Throat said that the rumor is that Bob Bigelow's NIDS Institute
 has a UFO artifact, and will be bringing that into public view as an
 attention-getting device, to make the public focus on the UFO/ET phenomenon.
 There is the possibility, in my opinion, that such a waving around of a piece
 of a UFO could manipulate people into giving the MJ-12/Aviary/Bigelow NIDS
 Institute undue power to negotiate with the Extraterrestrials.
         That is the Aviary's [dis-?]informational report for now. As always,
 use your own personal good judgment and discernment.
