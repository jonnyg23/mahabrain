 The following is a "working hypothesis" written by John Lear on
 December 29, 1987, and revised on January 14 and again in March.
 This revision is dated August 25, 1988.
 
 John Lear is a Lockheed L-1011 captain for a major US airline and
 has flown over 160 different types of aircraft in over 50
 different countries.  He holds 17 world speed records in the Lear
 Jet and is the only pilot ever to hold every airman certificate
 issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.  Mr. Lear has flown
 missions worldwide for the CIA and other government agencies. A
 former Nevada State Senator candidate, he is the son of William P.
 Lear, designer of the Lear Jet, the 8-track stereo and founder of
 Lear Seigler Corporation.  Lear became interested in UFO's in the
 summer of 1986 after talking with United States Air Force
 personnel who had witnessed a UFO landing at Bentwaters Air Force
 Base, near London, England, and three small aliens walking up to
 Wing Commander General Gordon Williams.

                         THE UFO COVERUP
                               by
                            John Lear
 
 The sun does not revolve around the earth.
 The United States government has been in business with little gray
 extraterrestrials for about 20 years.
 
 The first truth state here got Giordano Bruno burned at the stake
 in 1600 for daring to propose it was real.  The second truth has
 gotten far more people killed trying to state it publicly than
 will ever be known.
 
 But the truth must be told.  The fact that the earth revolves
 around the sun was successfully suppressed by the church for over
 200 years.  It eventually caused a major upheaval in the church,
 government and thought.  A realignment of social and traditional
 values.  That was in the 1800's.
 
 Now, about 400 years after the first truth was pronounced we must
 again face the shocking facts.  The "horrible truth" the
 government has been hiding from us for over 40 years.
 Unfortunately, the "horrible truth" is far more horrible than the
 government has imagined.
 
 In its effort to protect democracy our government sold us to the
 aliens.  And here is how it happened.  But before I begin I'd like
 to offer a word in the defense of those who bargained us away.
 They had the best of intentions.
 
 Germany may have recovered a flying saucer in 1939.  General James
 H. Doolittle went to Sweden in 1946 to investigate reports of
 "ghost rockets" (UFO's), thousands of which had been sighted over
 a seven month period.
 
 The "horrible truth" was known by only a very few persons; they
 were indeed ugly little creatures, shaped like praying mantises
 and were more advanced than us by perhaps a billion years.  Of the
 original group that were the first to learn the "horrible truth"
 several committed suicide, the most prominent of which was Defense
 Secretary James V. Forrestal, who jumped to his death from a 16th-
 story hospital window.  Secretary Forrestal's medical records are
 sealed to this day.
 
 President Truman quickly put a lid on the secret and turned the
 screws so tight that the general public still thinks that flying
 saucers are a joke.  Have I ever got a surprise for them.
 
 In 1947 President Truman established a group of 12 twelve top
 military and scientific personnel of their time.  They were known
 as MJ-12.  Although the group exists today, none of the original
 members are still alive.  The last one to die was Gordon Gray,
 former Secretary of the Army, in 1984.  As each member passed
 away, the group itself appointed a new member to fill the
 position.  There is some speculation that the group known as
 MJ-12 expanded to at least several more members.
 
 There were several more saucer crashes in the late 1940's: one in
 Roswell, Mew Mexico; one in Aztec, New Mexico; and one near
 Laredo, Texas, about 30 miles inside the Mexican border.
 
 Consider if you will the position of the United States government
 at that time.  They proudly thought of themselves as the most
 powerful nation on earth, having recently produced the atomic
 bomb, an achievement so stupendous that it would take Russia four
 years to catch up and only with the help of traitors to democracy.
 They had built a jet aircraft that had exceeded the speed of sound
 in flight.  They had built jet bombers with intercontinental range
 that could carry weapons of enormous destruction.  The post-war
 era had brought economic prosperity and the future seemed bright.
 Now imagine what it was like for those same leaders, all of whom
 had witnessed the panic of Orson Welle's radio broadcast of "The
 War of the Worlds" in 1938.  Thousands of Americans panicked at a
 realistically presented invasion of earth by beings from another
 planet.  Imagine their horror as they actually viewed the dead
 bodies of these frightening-looking little creatures with enormous
 eyes, reptilian skin and claw-like fingers.  Imagine their shock
 as they attempted to determine how these strange saucers were
 powered and could discover no part even remotely similar to
 components they were familiar with: no cylinders and pistons, no
 vacuum tubes or turbines or hydraulic actuators.  It is only when
 you fully understand the overwhelming helplessness the government
 was faced with in the late 40's that you can comprehend their
 perceived need for a total, thorough and sweeping cover-up to
 include the use of "deadly force."
 
 The cover-up was so successful that as late as 1985 a senior
 scientist with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Dr. Al Hibbs, would
 look at videotape of an enormous saucer and state for the record,
 "I'm not going to assign anything to that (UFO) phenomena without
 a lot more data."  Dr. Hibbs was looking at the naked emperor and
 saying, "He certainly looks naked, but that doesn't prove he is
 naked."
 
 In July of 1952 a panicked government watched helplessly as
 squadrons of "flying saucers" flew over Washington, D.C., and
 buzzed the White House, the Capitol Building and the Pentagon.  It
 took all the imagination and intimidation the government could
 muster to force that incident out of the memory of the public.
 
 Thousands of sightings occurred during the Korean War and several
 more saucers were retrieved by the Air Force.  Some were stored at
 Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, some were stored at Air Force
 Bases near the location of the crash sites.
 
 One saucer was so enormous and the logistical problems in
 transportation so enormous that it was buried at the crash site
 and remains there today.
 
 The stories are legendary on transporting crashed saucers over
 long distances, moving only at night, purchasing complete farms,
 slashing through forests, blocking major highways, sometimes
 driving two and three low-boys in tandem with an extraterrestrial
 load a hundred feet in diameter.
 
 On April 25, 1964, the first official communication between these
 aliens and the U.S. government took place at Hollomon Air Force
 Base in New Mexico.  Three saucers landed at a pre-arranged area
 and a meeting was held between the aliens and intelligence
 officers of the U.S. government.
 
 During the late 60's or early 70's MJ-12, representing the U.S.
 government, made a deal with these creatures called EBE's (extra-
 terrestrial biological entities, named by Detley Bronk, original
 MJ-12 member and sixth president of Johns Hopkins University).
 The "deal" was that in exchange for "technology" that they would
 provide to us we agreed to "ignore" the abductions that were going
 on and suppress information on the cattle mutilations.  The EBE's
 assured MJ-12 that the abductions (usually lasting about two
 hours) were merely the ongoing monitoring of developing
 civilizations.
 
 In fact, the purposes for the abductions turned out to be:
      (1)  Insertion of a 3mm spherical device through the nasal
           cavity of the abductee into the brain.  The device is
           used for the biological monitoring, tracking and control
           of the abductee.
      (2)  Implementation of post-hypnotic suggestion to carry out
           a specific activity during a specific time period, the
           actuation of which will occur within the next two to
           five years.
      (3)  Termination of some people so that they could function
           as sources of biological materials and substances.
      (4)  Termination of individuals who represent a threat to the
           continuation of their activity.
      (5)  Effect genetic engineering experiments.
      (6)  Impregnation of human females and early termination of
           pregnancies to secure the crossbred infant.
 
 The U.S. government was not initially aware of the far-reaching
 consequences of their "deal."  They were led to believe that the
 abductions were essentially benign and since they figured the
 abductions would probably go on anyway whether or not they agreed,
 they merely insisted that a current list of abductees be
 submitted, on a periodic basis, to MJ-12 and the National Security
 Council.  Does this sound incredible?  An actual list of abductees
 sent to the National Security Council?  Read on, because I have
 news for you.
 
 The EBE's have a genetic disorder in that their digestive system
 is atrophied and not functional.  Some speculate that they were
 involved in some type of accident or nuclear war, or that they are
 possibly on the back side of an evolutionary genetic curve.  In
 order to sustain themselves, they use an enzyme or hormonal
 secretion obtained from the tissue they extract from humans and
 animals.  (Note: Cows and humans are genetically similar.  In the
 event of a national disaster cow hemoglobin can be used by
 humans.)
 
 The secretions obtained are then mixed with hydrogen peroxide and
 applied on their skin by spreading or dipping parts of their
 bodies in the solution.  The body absorbs the solution and then
 excretes the waste back out through the skin.  The cattle
 mutilations, prevalent throughout the period 1973-1983 and
 publicly noted through newspaper and magazine stories and a
 documentary produced by Linda Howe for the Denver CBS affiliate
 KMGH, were for the collection of these tissues by the aliens.  The
 mutilations included genitals taken, rectums cored out to the
 colon, eyes, tongue and throat all surgically removed with extreme
 precision.  In some cases the incisions were made by cutting
 between the cells, a process we are not yet capable of performing
 the field.  In many of the mutilations there was no blood found at
 all in the carcasses, yet there was no vascular collapse of the
 internal organs.
 
 This has also been noted in human mutilations.  One of the first
 known mutilations was of Sgt. Jonathon P. Louette. His remains
 were discovered at the White Sands Missile Test Range in 1956,
 three days after an Air Force Major witnessed his abduction by a
 "disk-shaped" object at 0300 while on a search for missile debris
 downrange.  His genitals has been removed, rectum cored out in a
 surgically precise "plug" up to the colon, eyes removed and all
 blood removed, again, with no vascular collapse.  From some of the
 evidence it is apparent that this surgery is accomplished, in most
 cases, while the victim, animal or human, is still alive.
 
 The various parts of the body are taken to various underground
 laboratories, one of which is known to be near the small New
 Mexico town of Dulce.  This jointly occupied (CIA-alien) facility
 has been described as enormous, with huge tiles that "go on
 forever."  Witnesses have reported huge vats filled with an amber
 liquid with parts of human bodies being stirred inside.
 
 After the initial agreement, Groom Lake, one of this nation's most
 secret test centers, was closed for a period of about a year
 sometime between 1972 and 1974, and a huge underground facility
 was constructed for and with the help of the EBE's.  The
 bargained-for technology was set in place but could only be
 operated by the EBE's themselves.  Needless to say, the advanced
 technology could not be used against the EBE's.
 
 During the period 1979-1983 it became increasingly obvious to
 MJ-12 that things were not going as planned.  It became known that
 many more people (in the thousands) were being abducted than were
 listed on the official abduction reports.  In addition, it became
 obvious that some, not all, but some of the nation's missing
 children had been used for secretions and other parts required by
 the aliens.
 
 According to some, there was an altercation between the U.S.
 military and the aliens at the Dulce laboratory.  A special armed
 forces unit was called in to try and free a number of our people
 trapped in the facility who had become aware of what was really
 going on.  According to one source, 66 of the soldiers were killed
 in the effort.
 
 By 1983, MJ-12 must have been in stark terror at the mistake they
 had made in dealing with the EBE's.  They had subtly influenced
 (through Dr. Hynek, formerly with the Blue Book project, who had
 allegedly broken ties with the Air Force in the late 60's but who
 in reality continued to be their informant in his cover capacity
 as Director of the Center for UFO Studies) "Close Encounters of
 the Third Kind" and "E.T." (now admitted by some members of MJ-12
 to have been a "drastic mistake") to get the public used to "odd-
 looking" aliens that were compassionate, benevolent and very much
 our "space brothers."  MJ-12 had, in effect, "sold" the EBE's to
 the public, and were now faced with the fact that quite the
 opposite was true.  In addition, a plan had been formulated in
 1968 to make the public aware of the existence of aliens on earth
 over the next 20 years, to be culminated with several
 documentaries to be released during the 1985-1987 period.  These
 documentaries would explain the history and intentions of the
 EBE's.  The discovery of the "Grand Deception" put the entire
 plans, hopes and dreams of MJ-12 into utter confusion and panic.
 
 Meeting at the "Country Club," a remote lodge with private golf
 course, comfortable sleeping and working quarters and its own
 private airstrip built by and exclusively for the members of MJ-12,
 it was a factional fight of what to do now.  Part of MJ-12, which
 had now become military top-heavy, wanted to confess the whole
 scheme and the shambles it had become to the public, beg their
 forgiveness and ask for their support.  The other part (and
 majority) of MJ-12 argued that there was no way they could do
 that, that the situation was untenable and there was no use in
 exciting the public with the "horrible truth" and that the best
 plan was to continue the development of a weapon or "plan of
 containment" that could be used against the EBE's under the guise
 of "SDI," the so-called Strategic Defense Initiative, which has
 nothing whatever to do with a defense for inbound Russian nuclear
 missiles.  In fact, the real definition of purpose for SDI reads
 "the plotting, tracking and acquisition of articles in deep
 space."  As these words are being written, Dr. Edward Teller,
 "father" of the H-bomb is personally in the nuclear test tunnels
 of the Nevada Test Site, driving his workers and associates in the
 words of one, "like a man possessed."  And well he should be, for
 Dr. Teller is a member of MJ-12, along with Henry Kissinger,
 Admiral Bobby Inman, and General Lew Allen.
 
 Before the "Grand Deception" was discovered, in following the plan
 of metered release of information to the public, several
 documentaries and videotapes were made.  William Moore, a Burbank,
 California-based UFO researcher who wrote "The Roswell Incident,"
 a book published in 1980 that detailed the crash, recovery and
 subsequent cover-up of a UFO with four alien bodies, has a
 videotape of two newsmen interviewing a military officer
 associated with MJ-12.  This military officer answers questions
 relating to the history of MJ-12 and the cover-up, the recovery of
 a number of flying saucers, and the existence of a live alien (one
 of three living aliens captured and designated EBE-1, EBE-2 and
 EBE-3, being held in a facility designated as YY-II at Los Alamos,
 New Mexico.  The only other facility of this type, which is
 electromagnetically secure, is at Edwards Air Force Base in
 Mojave, California).  The officer names names as previously
 mentioned plus a few others:  Harold Brown, Richard Helms, General
 Vernon Walters and Dr. Theodore von Karman, as being members of
 MJ-12.
 
 
 The officer also relates the fact that the EBE's claim to have
 created Christ.  The EBE's have a type of recording device that
 has recorded all of earth's history and can display it in the form
 of a hologram.  This hologram can be filmed but because of the way
 holograms work, it does not come out very clear on film or
 videotape.  The crucifixion of Christ on the Mount of Olives has
 allegedly been put on film to show the public.  The EBE's claim to
 have created Christ, which, in view of the "Grand Deception,"
 could be an effort to disrupt traditional values for undetermined
 reasons.
 
 Another videotape allegedly in existence is an interview with an
 EBE.  Since EBE's communicate telepathically an Air Force colonel
 serves as an interpreter.  Just before the recent stock market
 crash, several newsmen, including Bill Moore, had been invited to
 Washington, D.C., to personally film the EBE in a similar type
 interview and distribute the film to the public.  Apparently,
 because of the market crash, it was felt that the timing was not
 propitious.  In any case, it certainly seems like an odd method to
 inform the pubic of extraterrestrials, but it would be in keeping
 with the actions of a panicked organization, who at this point
 didn't know which way to turn.
 
 Moore is also in possession of more Aquarius documents, a few
 pages of which leaked out several years ago, detailing the super-
 secret NSA project which had been denied by them until just
 recently.  In a letter to Senator John Glenn, NSA's Director of
 Policy, Julia B. Wetzel, wrote, "Apparently there is or was an Air
 Force project by that name [Aquarius] which dealt with UFO's.
 Coincidentally, there is also an NSA project by that name."  NSA's
 Project Aquarius deals specifically with "communications with
 aliens."  Within the Aquarius program was Project Snowbird, a
 project to test fly a recovered alien aircraft at Groome Lake,
 Nevada.  This project continues today at that location.  In the
 words of an individual who works at Groom Lake "our people are
 much better at taking things apart than they are at putting them
 back together."  Another saw a saucer being trucked into the
 Nevada Test Site in March of 1988.  Still another informant
 witnessed a saucer being buried at that location during the second
 week of August, 1988.
 
 If the government felt they were being forced to acknowledge the
 existence of aliens on earth because of the overwhelming evidence,
 such as the Hudson Valley sightings during the past four years,
 the Wytheville, Virginia, sightings in October and November of
 1987, the Gulf Breeze, Florida sightings in which documentary
 evidence in the form of stereoscopic photographs and videotape
 were taken between November of 1987 and May of 1988, the Lake
 Superior sightings of 1988 and the sightings in and around Las
 Vegas, Nevada and the Nevada Test Site, and taking into
 consideration the "Grand Deception" and obviously hostile intent
 of the EBE's, it might be expedient for MJ-12 to admit to the
 EBE's existence but conceal the information on the abductions and
 mutilations of humans and animals.
 
 The enormity of the problem must be driving more than a few "at
 the top" to drink.  But what about the rest of us?  Most of those
 reporting sightings are being viciously ridiculed by government-
 sponsored "debunkers" like Philip Klass, former avionics editor
 for "Aviation Week" and "Space Technology," NASA scientist James
 Oberg, and a host of others.  When the truth does emerge, if it
 ever does, how is this shabby, dishonest treatment of totally
 sane, normal and patriotic citizens going to be justified?
 
 Now you ask, "Why haven't I heard about any of this?"  Who do you
 think you would hear it from?  Dan Rather?  Tom Brokaw?  Sam
 Donaldson?  Wrong.  These people just read the news.  They don't
 find it.  They have ladies that call and interview witnesses and
 verify statements on stories coming over the wire.  It's not like
 Dan Rather would go down to Wytheville, Virginia, and dig into why
 there were 4000 reports of sightings in October and November of
 1987.  Better that Tom Brokaw or someone else should risk their
 credibility on this type of story.  Tom Brokaw?  He wants Sam
 Donaldson to risk his credibility.  No one... but no one is going
 to risk their reputation on such outlandish ideas regardless of
 how many people report sightings of 900-foot objects running them
 off the road.  In the case of the Wytheville, Virginia, sightings,
 dozens of vans with "NASA" lettered on the sides failed to
 interest newsmen.  And those that did ask questions were told that
 NASA was doing a weather survey.
 
 Well, then, you ask:  What about out scientists... what about Carl
 Sagan?  Isaac Asimov?  Arthur C. Clarke?  Wouldn't they have
 known?  If Carl Sagan knows, then he is committing a great fraud
 through the solicitation of memberships in the Planetary Society
 "to search for extraterrestrial intelligence."  Another charade
 into which the U.S. government dumps millions of dollars every
 year is the radiotelescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, operated by
 Cornell University with, guess who, Carl Sagan.  Cornell
 University is ostensibly searching for signals from outer space, a
 sign, maybe, that someone is out there.  It's hard to believe that
 relatively intelligent astronomers like Sagan could be so stupid.
 
 What about Isaac Asimov?  Surely the most prolific science fiction
 writer of all time would have guessed by now that there must be an
 enormous cover-up.
 
 One current hypothesis is that, from the available evidence, it
 appears that the EBE's are trying to regenerate their own species
 at our expense.  They have apparently suffered either some kind of
 nuclear holocaust or they may be on the back side of a bell-shaped
 evolutionary curve where in essence they are "devolving" instead
 of evolving.  In any case, according to reports of several
 autopsies of aliens that have leaked out, the EBE's have an
 atrophied digestive system and other physical problems.  This
 would account for their attempts to crossbreed with us as outlined
 in "Intruders" by Budd Hopkins, a detailed study of an
 Indianapolis woman who, over several years, produces seven
 crossbreed alien children, none of whom she was allowed to keep.
 Not that she wanted to.
 
 Whatever the answer these facts are indisputable.  The extent and
 number of persons reported missing every year is a closely guarded
 government secret.  (Since 1980, at least 20,000 children have
 been reported missing each year.)  Cattle mutilations (over 14,000
 since 1973) are regarded officially by the government as a "hoax."
 Human abductions by aliens are officially regarded by the
 government as a "hoax."  The latest polls show that 88% of all
 Americans believe that intelligent life on other planets is
 probable and that over 20 million Americans have seen what they
 believed to be a UFO.  But the U.S. government officially
 dismisses "flying saucers" as a "hoax."  What do you think?
 
 The best advice I can give you is next time you see a flying
 saucer and are awed by its obvious display of technology and
 gorgeous lights of pure color:
 
                            RUN LIKE HELL!
