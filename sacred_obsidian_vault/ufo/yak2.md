 INTRODUCTION
 
      The following report is intended to update this
 investigator's first paper, Report on the Investigation of
 Nocturnal Light Phenomena at Toppenish, Washington: August, 1972.
 It contains a compilation and breakdown of reports of UFO
 sightings from the area during the calendar year of 1973.
 
      Investigation of the unusual activity in the vicinity of the
 Yakima Indian Reservation began in April of 1972 and continues to
 the present time. The goal of the study is to discover the source
 or sources of the sightings and accumulate a data base suitable
 for scientific appraisal of the problem.
 
      The section which follows summarizes sighting reports
 received for 1973. The reports compiled here appear to describe
 activity which, based on this investigator's experience with UFO
 phenomena in the Toppenish area and elsewhere, is not readily
 explained by known causes. They have been coarsely "filtered~
 from other reports which either do not contain sufficient
 information to classify them as unknown or those which contain
 strong suggestions of a known cause. The practice of omitting
 names of reporters, followed in the previous report, has been
 continued in this paper. The report concludes with analysis and
 comment on the 1973 reports and a discussion of the on-going
 project.
 
 
 SUMMARY OF REPORTS FOR 1973
 
 1.  Date: February 19, 1973 -- 1900 PST
     Activity Location: Hembre Mountain, near Toppenish Ridge
     Observer Location: Campbell Rd., north of Yost Rd.
 
     Summary:
     Bright white lights, on or above Hembre Mountain, near
     Toppenish Ridge which later turned bright red and flashed.
     Position of the lights did not change, but moved in a pattern
     which a circling airplane might make. (Note: It is unlikely that an
     airplane was the stimulus for this report, because of the darkness and
     rough terrain involved in the sighting area.)
 
 
 2.  Date: February 20, 1973 -- 1820 PST
     Activity Location: Lower third of slope of Toppenish Ridge, south
                       of the intersection of Yost and Shaker Church Roads.
     Observer Location: Branch Rd., between Brownstone and Harrah.
 
     Summary:
     Observer reported three or four flashing, bright red
     lights in the above location. He assumed they were emitted by
     fire vehicles operating in the area. A thorough check however
     indicated that no vehicles from any of the fire control agencies
     in the valley were in service at the time. A further check
     confirmed that no law enforcement emergency existed in the
     vicinity of the sighting.
 
     The lights moved back and forth in straight lines, as if
     traversing back and forth on a winding road. There is only one
     meandering dirt road in the area. At approximately 1845, an
     lndian Police mobile unit was dispatched to the sighting location
     and no activity of any kind was found. The lights were also no
     longer visible to the original observer.
 
     The lights observed the previous night (see Report 1.) were
     approximately 14 miles to the east of the above observation.
 
 
 3.  Date: March 13, 1973 -- 0711 PST
     Activity Location: Above Satus Fire lookout
     Observer Location: One mile east of White Swan on US 220
 
     Summary:
     The observer was proceeding east in a car along US 220
     from the town of White Swan. As she neared tho Tribal Community
     Center and White Swan Ranger Station, she noticed an object
     hovering over tho Satus fire lookout. (From the observer's
     position, Satus lookout was eight miles away and just a few
     degrees west of south.) There were no clouds in tho sky,
     visibility was excellent and the lookout was clearly visible in
     its position at Satus Peak on Toppenish Ridge.
 
     The observer stopped the car and continued to watch the
     object. Her first impression was that the object was a
     reflection from the microwave relay antenna dish near the
     lookout building, but soon determined that it was not. The object
     hovered quite low over the lookout for an estimated five to ten
     minutes. It then began to move slowly northward in jerks, much as
     an automobile will move when the clutch is released too quickly.
     The series of jerking movements lasted approximately 15 to 20
     seconds and the object then accelerated into a very high speed
     departure to due north, passing just west Or the observer and
     moving out of sight just west of the city of Yakima.
 
     The object was described as being almost identical to an old
     dinner bell with the handle on the top (See Slide #1.). The
     object was oriented as shown in tho sketch, with the "handle" at
     the top. The observer estimated the object to be larger than a
     small aircraft (such as a Piper Cub), but smaller than an
     airliner. The object was a metallic grey color, except for the
     bottom, or what could be called the mouth of the bell. The latter
     portion of the object gave-off a strange, florescent orange glow.
     The colors did not change as the object departed.
 
     The observer reported the sighting to Bill Vogel on March 16 --
     three days after the sighting.  Mr. Vogel took a detailed report
     at this time. This investigator verified details given in Mr.
     Vogel's report with the observer several weeks later. This
     investigator and Mr. Vogel know the observer personally and know
     her to be reliable. She is familiar with many of the
     manifestations of UFO activity on tho Yakima Reservation and is
     also aware of mundane conditions prevailing in the area. In
     short, she qualifies as a "trained observer" for the purposes of
     this study project.
 
     Satus Fire Lookout, as well as the whole of the north side of
     Toppenish Ridge, has been a focal point of reports of UFO
     activity for some time (See the 1972 report). This is, however,
     the most detailed daylight observation reported in the vicinity
     of the lookout.
 
 
 4.  Date: April 2, 1973 -- 2043 PST
     Activity Location: Toppenish, Wash.
     Observer Location: Same
 
     Summary:
     While lying in his room in bed, the observer, a ten year
     old boy, reported that he saw a yellow ball of light, about the
     size of a soccer ball or basketball, descend noiselessly from a
     NNW direction in front of his bedroom window and then shoot
     straight up into the air and disappear from view. The object was
     very bright and hurt his eyes. He was also frightened, but noted
     time of the incident (2043) from the electric clock next to his
     bed. The observation was estimated to last about ten seconds.
     The boy reported the incident to his father tho following day and
     also drew the picture reproduced in Slide #2.- The window through
     which the object was observed is on the northwest
     corner of the house, facing north.
 
     This investigator followed-up on the report about a week after
     the incident and determined that the boy appeared to be objective
     about details of tho report and was not inclined to embellish his
     account.
 
 
 5.  Date: April 3, 1973 -- 2345 PST
     Activity Location: In sky, south of Toppenish, Washington
     Observer Locations: Toppenish (two independent observers)
 
     Summary:
     A tan colored, luminous object at an estimated altitude
     of 4000 to 6000 ft. was observed moving from west to east,
     parallel to and slightly north of Toppenish Ridge. First
     impression of one observer was that the object was an aircraft.
     However, the tan color, absence of flashing running lights and
     lack of any sound appeared to rule-out the possibility of a
     conventional aircraft. Speed of the object was estimated to be
     under 200 mph.
 
 
 6.  Date: April 4, 1973 -- 0115 PST
     Activity Location: East of US 97, on LaRue Rd.
     Observer Location: Same
 
     Summary:
     The observer was in bed when he heard a high-pitched,
     whining sound. He looked out of the window and observed an object
     about 80 ft. long and 30 to 40 ft. wide passing directly over the
     house. The object was florescent or a slightly glowing,
     whitish-blue color, with darker blue-colored spots scattered over
     the surface. Altitude was estimated at 150 ft. The
     object moved from east to west and was observed until it
     disappeared over White Swan.
 
     Flight path of the object reported in (5.) above was only
     slightly north of the above location. This investigator was
     unsuccessful in contacting the witness directly for further
     details of the sighting.
 
 
 7.  Date: Week prior to April 4, 1973 -- evening hours
     Activity Location: Vicinity of White Swan, Wash.
     Observer Location: Unknown
 
     Summary:
     During a series of night time brush fires in the area,
     small white balls of light, about the size of tennis balls, or
     larger had been observed coming out of the dark, circling the
     fires several times and then moving back into the darkness.
 
 
 8.  Date: Jun 22, 1973 -- late afternoon
     Activity Location: Over Logy Creek
     Observer Location: Satus Fire Lookout
 
     Summary:
     Slide nos. 3 and 4 are full frame and magnified copies
     of one slide taken by an observer located at Satus Fire Lookout.
     Exact time of the exposure was not logged and the time was given
     only as "late afternoon". The witness reported that it was cloudy
     with complete coverage at the time of the sighting. A
     thunderstorm had been in the area earlier.
 
     Quoting from the observer: "I was looking out the window in
     the door, when I saw this "thing" come from behind a cloud.
     The bright red color was what caught my eye. My first thought was
     "what on earth is that?" At almost the same instant, I
     ran, got my camera, opened the door and quick-like took a
     picture. As I took the camera away from my eye, it, the object
     was heading behind another cloud. It was headed from SW to NE. It
     was kind of this (elliptical) shape as I remember, with this
     extra bright red glow or light or whatever. I can't exactly say,
     except it was brilliant red and large. Maybe I should have
     looked better, rather than thinking "I must get a picture". It
     was moving quite rapidly."
 
     Additional questioning revealed that the object was positioned
     SSE of the lookout, over Logy Creek at the time of the
     photograph. The distance from the camera would then have been
     approximately 9 1/2 miles. The lookout structure has two doors,
     co-located at the SE corner of the south side of the building.
     The inside door opens inward and is covered with glass panes. The
     outside door is a standard screen door which opens outward. The
     line in the upper right-hand quadrant of the picture is a guy
     wire used to hold the lookout on its foundations during high
     winds. The photograph was taken through the screen door.
 
     The camera used by the observer was a Kodak 35. This is a
     simple range-finder camera with an adjustable f3.5, 50mm lens.
     At the time of the exposure, the lens was set at f3.5 and the
     shutter speed was 1/25 second.  High-speed Ektachrome, daylight
     film was used and development was for the standard ASA rating of
     160.
 
     The photographer was an experienced fire lookout who has had a
     number of UFO sightings. The need for "hard" photographic data
     had been impressed upon her and other lookouts in the Reservation
     network during the field study made by this investigator in the
     summer of 1972. She therefore had the camera ready for the
     occasion of the above observation. It is probable that, If such
     preparations had not been made, the photograph would never have
     been taken. It is to her credit that she had the presence of mind
     to take the picture in the very short period of time in which the
     object was visible.
 
 
 9.  Date: July 20, 1973 -- evening hours
     Activity Location: between Sopelia and Satus Fire Lookouts
     Observer Locations: Sopelia and Satus Fire Lookouts
 
     Summary:
     Both fire lookouts observed a very fast moving light,
     travelling from southeast to northwest. The sighting was of very
     short duration. Lightning had been observed to the north of Satus
     Lookout earlier in the evening.
 
 
 10. Date: July 22-23 -- 2245 to 0100 PST
     Activity Location: Horse Heaven Hills
     Observer Location: Satus Fire Lookout (two observers)
 
     Summary:
     Three orange lights below the ridges of Horse Heaven
     Hills were observed at intervals during a two hour period. The
     lights would disappear at about the same time and re-appear 15 or
     20 minutes later at nearly the same time. While visible, they
     would flicker and move slightly. With the naked eye, the
     lights were separated by about 5๘ of azimuth.  No roads are
     in the area of the sighting.
 
     Distance from the observers was 18 miles. Given a 5๘ separation
     angle, the objects would have to have been about a mile apart. It
     would be difficult to attribute the nearly synchronous "on" and
     "off" characteristics of the lights to automobiles or
     motorcycles operating at such distances apart.
 
 
 11. Date: July 24, 1973 -- 2245 to 2400 PST
     Activity Location: Below and between Satus Fire Lookout and Mill
                        Creek Rd.
     Observer Location: Satus Fire Lookout
 
     Summary:
     A bright red object was seen moving in an area where
     there are no roads, below the lookout and between the lookout and
     Mill Creek Canyon. Photographs were attempted, but nothing was
     found on the film after development. It is possible that the
     object was too far away to photograph.
 
 
 12. Date: July 27, 1973 -- 0300 PST
     Activity Location: Granger, Washington
     Observer Location: 4 miles east of Granger
 
     Summary:
     Two observers were outside feeding cows at the Dolson
     Dairy (locally called the "Cow Palace"), located at the
     intersection Or East Zillah and North Liberty Roads, 4 miles east
     of Zillah, Washington. At approximately 0300, both observers
     spotted an object in the sky to the west, in front of the hills
     which lie behind the town of Granger. The object generally
     followed the line of hills, moving SE slowly and silently towards
     the town of Mabton.
 
     After watching the object for 15 to 20 minutes, one observer went
     inside to report the sighting. He dialed the telephone company
     operator and was referred to the Toppenish Police dispatcher.
     After describing the circumstances of the sighting to the police
     dispatcher, he again joined the other observer and continued to
     watch the object. Time was 0320 (verified by the police
     dispatcher).
 
     The Toppenish dispatcher called the Yakima County Sheriff's
     dispatcher. The sheriff's dispatcher said that the Yakima
     Firing Center had two helicopters somewhere on maneuvers at that
     time and that these craft might account for the sighting. The
     Toppenish dispatcher received a second report at 0338 (See 13.
     below). The dispatcher noted information concerning the second
     report and called the first observer back to ask if the object he
     was seeing was still visible. It was. The observer again went
     outside just in time to see the object disappear over the highest
     point, Snipes Mountain, SE of Granger. Co-workers at the dairy
     were not called until the object had disappeared from view.
     Estimated total observation time was 1/2 hour.
 
     Physical characteristics of the object were such that they could
     not have been those of a conventional aircraft: Movement was very
     slow and steady -- approximately 3-4 mph. No noise was heard and
     any kind of powered aircraft would have clearly audible at that
     distance and time of morning.
 
     The object appeared as a pair of lights moving in a definite,
     periodic pattern. The color of the light emitted by the object
     was reddish-orange. Because of the repetitive nature of the light
     pattern and the fixed relationship of the lights to one another,
     the observers felt that the lights must have been attached to a
     body or fuselage of some sort and spinning around this body. The
     structure would have been about the size of an F-27 airliner,
     according to the estimate of one observer.  Figure 1. shows
     schematically the pattern traced by the lights. The object was at
     an elevation of about 0๘ relative to the
     observers, since the observation point is on a hill overlooking
     Granger. The lights of Granger were also clearly visible under
     the object.
 
 
 13. Date: July 27, 1973 -- 0338 PST
     Activity Location: Zillah Cemetery, Zillah, Washington
     Observer Location: Same
 
     Summary:
     A deputy marshal was driving 1/4 mile east of the Zillah
     cemetery on the Zillah-Toppenish Road when he observed two side-
     by-side orange balls of light straight ahead of his
     patrol car, to the west. The lights were above and behind
     trees located in the cemetery, over the Yakima River which runs
     behind the cemetery. His attention was diverted momentarily from
     the lights while he shined the spotlight of his patrol car into
     the yard of a house on his right. He again looked back to the
     cemetery and saw that the lights were moving in his general
     direction.
 
     The marshal drove to the entrance of the Zillah cemetery,
     opened the gate and drove into the cemetery grounds. The
     entrance road heads in a SW direction and the observer
     watched the lights through the trees as he drove approximately
     600 ft. to a point where the drive is closest to the river. He
     stopped the car and called the Toppenish police dispatcher on the
     radio, telling her that he was observing a UFO. She informed him
     that the Yakima Firing Center had helicopters on maneuvers
     somewhere in the area.
 
     The deputy next turned-off the car engine and walked
     approximately 100 ft. to a point where the cemetery ends in a
     bluff overlooking the Yakima River. The lights continued
     very slowly, appearing to move directly towards him.
 
 
     The lights, estimated at about 2 ft. in diameter, moved
     smoothly and maintained a very rigid spacing, as if attached to
     each other, throughout the sighting. They remained oriented
     side-by-side and had sharp, well defined outlines.
 
     At a distance of about 1/4 mile from the deputy, the lights
     turned, still maintaining their rigid spacing, and headed south.
     After travelling approximately another 1/4 mile, the lights
     executed another turn and headed southeast. At this time,
     the deputy returned to his patrol car and called the Toppenish
     dispatcher again, saying in no uncertain terms that what he was
     observing was not a helicopter. The car engine had been off and
     he had heard absolutely no noise.
 
     During the entire observation, the lights seemed to generally
    follow the path of the river bed. Altitude was just over the
    trees along the river and nearly the same as the observer. The
    lights were observed until they disappeared from view
    behind hills southeast of the cemetery, towards the town of
    Granger.
 
    As in (12.) above, the deputy had the impression that some mass
    was in between the two lights, because of their rigid spacing. It
    was to dark to see anything other the lights, however.
 
 
 14. Date: August 25, 1973 -- 1930 and 1945 PST
     Activity Location: Mt. Adams Lake, west of Signal Peak
     Observer Location: Same
 
     Summary:
     Several members of a camping party observed a rapidly
     moving, fairly large white ball of light coming from the
     northwest and passing overhead at 1930. No sound was heard and
     altitude was estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 ft. At 1945, two
     smaller lights were seen coming over the top of Mt. Adams and
     moving to the northeast. The lights were staggered in position,
     with the front one an orange color and the rear one white.
     Altitude was estimated to be the same as for the light seen at
     1930. No noise was heard. Observers were familiar with the
     appearance of meteors and insisted that the lights were not
     meteors.
 
 
      Before proceeding further, some general comments should be
 made regarding apparent relationships between several of the
 above reports.  Report Nos. 1. and 2. are typical of one type of
 nocturnal light report which has been common since the study
 began in 1972. In this class, steady or flashing lights; usually
 red, orange or white in color, are observed to be present on or
 near the ground in areas where there is normally no vehicular
 traffic. Observations frequently last a 1/2 hour or more, but
 when police or fire units are dispatched to the area (assuming
 the area can be reached), nothing unusual is found. This type of
 incident has occurred too frequently to be coincidental. Over the
 last two years, nocturnal lights of the type described above have
 been seen repeatedly in areas along the north slope of Toppenish
 Ridge, between the towns of Toppenish and White Swan. This
 portion of Toppenish Ridge is easily observed from many points in
 the valley and one might conclude that this visual accessibility
 accounts for some of the concentration of sighting reports in
 this area. Report No. 3., the "dinner bell", also came from this
 area.
 
      Report Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7, dated between April 1 and 4,
 appear to reflect a peak of activity which was followed by a
 complete absence of reports until the fire lookout's photograph
 of June 22 (Report No. 8.). Activity appeared to hold at a
 steady, though low level until the end of July. Except for the
 report of August 25 (No. 14), no other observations were reported
 in 1973. Report No. 14 appears to be a maverick, because it
 occurred after the July peak and at a very remote point on the
 Reservation. It is not, however, unlike other nocturnal light
 reports of the type where large, high altitude lights; in tan,
 orange or white colors, with unusual flight patterns that have
 been seen in the area.
 
      Finally, Report Nos. 12 and 13 appear to have been separate,
 but coincident observations. This conclusion is based on the time
 sequence supported by the Toppenish Police dispatcher's log and
 witness testimony. Despite the similarities between both reports,
 it appears unlikely that the same object was involved in both
 sightings.
 
 
 ANALYSIS OF REPORTS FOR 1973
 
      A total of fourteen credible reports were received during
 the calendar year 1973. Eight of these reports were followed-up
 for additional information by this investigator. The observations
 ranged from distant nocturnal lights and night time close
 encounters of the type I (i.e. no interaction between the
 observer and object) to a couple of daylight sightings, one
 supported by a photograph. Tho following table summarizes the
 reports by type:
 
 Type of             No. of         Report
 Report               Type          Numbers
 --------------------------------------------------------
 Nocturnal lights      9            1,2,5,7,9,10,11,12,14
 Close Encounters I    3            4,6,13
 Daylight Objects      2            3,8
 
      All of the reports, except No. 7, were encoded for computer
 analysis using the recently developed APDF format. Under the APDF
 encoding rules, Report Nos. 3,8 and 13 were given Strangeness
 Indexes of 5, the highest value assignable. Of these four, Report
 Nos. 3, 8 and 13 were given average or above average credibility
 Indexes. The number of sighting reports from the Yakima
 Reservation area is still too small to pursue an in-depth
 statistical analysis, but an initial attempt has been made to
 identify some of the more gross behavior patterns of the UFO
 activity in the area.
 
      A bar graph representation of the number of reports versus
 the week of incidence in the year has been plotted for the
 fourteen reports. The result is shown in Figure 1. Notice the
 tendency for the reports to "clump" into groups. (For reference,
 it should be noted that activity, as indicated by sighting
 reports, following the 1972 field study, continued on a
 diminished level through the end of 1972.)
 
      A majority of the reports from the area have resulted from
 observations made after dark. The sample is still too small to
 quantify the trends, but data collected over the last two years
 suggests that most observations tend to occur between the hours
 of 1800 and 0100 local time.
 
      Concise weather data (Table I.) was available for the
 sighting area after June 1 of 1973. There was no particular
 correlation discernable between weather conditions and the
 occurrence of UFO activity. Past experience in the area also
 tends to discount such a connection. What previously appeared to
 be a peaking of activity during the summer months is possibly the
 result of the fact that more observers are present during the
 summer months to report the phenomena. This contention is
 supported by the fact that winter sightings have been more common
 since active report collection efforts have been made.
 
      The reports were analyzed in order to find some pattern in
 line of direction. A linear grid 40X70 miles, centered over the
 Yakima Indian Reservation, was constructed and observation
 locations were plotted. Arrows representing direction of travel
 (where available from reports, were next drawn on the plot. The
 resulting graph is shown in Figure 2. No consistent pattern
 appeared which related to direction of travel. However, there was
 a marked grouping of sighting locations over the grid. Sightings
 for 1973 tend to line up into two north-south corridors on the
 grid. The grouping to the right of the plot is centered near the
 towns of Toppenish, Zillah and Granger. The cluster near the
 center of the plot is on a rough line with Satus fire lookout and
 the town of White Swan. Figure 2 does not appear to reveal any
 relationship between the chronology of the reports and their
 locations.
 
 
 CONCLUSION
 
      As mentioned earlier, data concerning long term trends for
 the UFO activity in the Yakima Reservation area has not been
 accumulated in sufficient quantity or depth to permit a thorough
 analysis. However, several consistent patterns of behavior, valid
 at least for the short term, have begun to emerge These patterns
 include:
 
      1. A tendency for activity to occur in groups or "waves".
 
      2. Type of activity that is not limited to nocturnal lights,
         but includes other type of UFO phenomena.
 
      3. Activity that is characterized by an evasiveness which
         exceeds normal expectations of chance.
 
      Two lines of endeavor are being pursued in the continuing
 study. The first involves increased reliance on competent
 residents of the study area as sources of sighting reports.
 Trained local observers, familiar with the area appear to be a
 viable source of data and efforts will continue to be directed
 towards developing this resource.
 
      The second part of the approach to acquisition of data
 continues to be firsthand field work of the type done in 1972. In
 order to accomplish results with the limited time and resources
 available, emphasis has been placed on rapid communication of
 activity reports from observers in the study area and
 identification of periods of peak activity.
 
      One frustrating aspect of working with the study to date has
 been the lack of first-hand reports involving close encounters
 with UFO. There have been consistent rumors of such cases, but
 actual witnesses have not yet materialized. The reason is most
 likely a fear of ridicule on the part of such observers and steps
 have been taken to alleviate these fears. Close encounter
 observations; especially those involving physical interaction of
 the object with the observer.  Physical residue or photographs
 are frequently the ones which yield the most information.
 Accordingly, they are given the greatest attention in
 investigation of UFO phenomena.
 
      This investigator is very much indebted to the many people
 who have given their cooperation in this project. These people
 include:
           Mr. Bill Vogel and Branch of Forestry personnel
           The Yakima Nation Tribal Council
           The Bureau of Indian Affairs
           Toppenish Area Law Enforcement Agencies
 
 Many thanks to them for their support and valuable assistance.
