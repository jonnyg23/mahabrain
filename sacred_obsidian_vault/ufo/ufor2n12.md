  ARIZONA REPORTS KEEP
  POURING IN
 
       Researchers have been flooded with reports in
  the wake of last week's big UFO flap in Arizona.
       People claiming to have seen glowing orange
  spheres and triangular UFOs over Phoenix, Tempe,
  Prescott, Glendale and Tucson the evening of
  March 13, 1997 number in the thousands.
       On Monday, March 17, 1997, Channel 10 in
  Phoenix aired a videotape of a large cylindrical
  UFO with 8 lights.
       In Tucson, eyewitnesses reported four bright
  lights coming from the northwest and heading
  southeast.  (See the Prescott, Arizona Daily
  Courier for March 14, 1997  "UFO Sightings in
  PV, Other Areas.")
       In Glendale (population 96,988), orange globes
  hovered over a suburban neighborhood for two hours,
  from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.  People were "looking up at
  what they said were orange balls of light.  They were
  very scared...In fact, my 80-year-old father-in-law was
  shouting on the phone at one point.  My wife and I
  did what we could to calm him down and let him
  know what we had tried to tell him about UFOs over
  the years," Billy Dee of Wisconsin reported.
       On Tuesday, March 18, the Arizona Republic ran
  a story on the flap.  According to reporter Susie
  Steckner, the "first call came from former police
  officers who spotted" the UFOs "near Paulden, north
  of Prescott, in Yavapai County."
       "The bright orange-red lights formed the shape of
  a boomerang...with a larger grouping in the lead, followed
  by a single light."
       Shortly after 8 p.m., calls came flooding in from
  Prescott, Prescott Valley, Dewey, Chris Valley,
  Glendale and Phoenix.
       "Tim MacDonald, 11, was leaving his Cub Scout
  meeting in Phoenix when he saw the bizarre object.
  'It looked like a Stealth bomber,' he said, 'It was in a
  triangle shape and had three lights.  It was moving very
  slowly.  It was there for two or three minutes...When it
  disappeared, I thought it was a UFO.'" (See the Arizona
  Republic for March 18, 1997.)
       During its 5 p.m. newcast on March 17, Channel 12
  in Phoenix stated that the glowing orange spheres seen
  March 13 over the Gila River Indian Reservation south of
  the city were "military flares."  The announcer reportedly
  said, "The strange lights over Phoenix were explained
  as an anti-aircraft experiment in a military area 50 miles
  (80 kilometers) south of Phoenix."
       Lt. Col. Mike Hauser, USAF, a spokesman for Luke
  Air Force Base, told the Arizona Republic: "Everybody is
  telling us we have UFOs stashed all over the Air Force.
  I'm not taking issue with what people saw (but) lots of
  things can make lights."
       On Wednesday, March 19, videographer Tom King
  and a group of ufologists went to the state park at South
  Mountain, just south of Phoenix, hoping to catch more
  UFOs on tape.  But park rangers ordered the group off
  the mountain at 9:30 p.m.
       "To our surprise, we were hustled out of the park
  early," King reported.  "The park usually closes at 11 p.m.
  We were told to leave at 9:24.  The park rangers were
  storming up the peak and announced over the loudspeaker,
  'The park is closed.  Leave now.  The park is closed.
  Leave while you can.'"  (Many thanks to Bill Hamilton,
  Errol Bruce-Knapp, Tom King, Billy Dee and Steve
  Wilson, Jr. for this story.)
 
  GUNSHIPS CHASE THREE UFOs
  OVER WEST VIRGINIA
 
       On Tuesday, March 11, 1997, at 6:30 p.m., which
  was the second night of the UFO flap in Phoenix, three
  orange spheres appeared over the south bank of the
  Kanawha River, in the South Hills section of
  Charleston, West Virginia.
       Patricia J. Blake and her nine-year-old daughter
  were on Oakwood Road in South Hills when they
  sighted the objects.  "The first light was coming down
  towards the woods vertically," Mrs. Blake said, "It was
  very orange and had a long trail behind it.  Two other
  lights of the same description were also coming down,
  also with tails behind them.  The first one was now in
  the middle and seemed to slow down at one point."
       Mrs. Blake said the three UFOs were arrayed
  like this:
                               0          0
                                     0
 
       "Then all three appeared to stay in this position
  for a few minutes, the larger moving rather slowly to
  our right.  When we first saw them, they were maybe
  45 degrees above the horizon (and then) came down
  to a much lower angle, I would say 25 degrees."
       Mrs. Blake estimated that the UFOs hovered over
  a wooded area south of Route 61 and west of Route 119.
  "The lights darted to the west, somewhat southwest,
  hovered at the second site for 8 to 10 minutes," she
  added.  "It was still daylight and the sky was nearly
  cloudless."  The UFOs then sped away.
       At 6:45 p.m., four C-130 Air National Guard planes
  flew across the Kanawha River, heading southwest in
  the same direction as the orange UFOs.  Mrs. Blake
  said she believes the planes came from Yeager Field
  airport, northeast of Charleston.  (Email Interview)
 
  ORANGE GLOBES REPORTED
  OVER QUEBEC AND VERMONT
 
       In addition to Arizona and West Virginia, "orange
  sphere" UFOs were also seen over Quebec.  Since
  Friday, March 14, the ufological group CEIPI has
  interviewed 24 eyewitnesses.
       Most of the sightings took place over Breckenridge,
  a small town on the north shore of the Ottawa River
  near Aylemer (population 25,724), just west of
  Canada's capital city, Ottawa.
       On Friday, March 14, shortly before 8 p.m., a
  glowing orange light was seen over Breckenridge.
  Shortly after 8, a man in Gatineau, Quebec
  (population 73,479) eight miles (12 kilometers)
  north of Ottawa, saw "a definite orange light."
       At 8:45 p.m., another man "saw the same thing
  but a little more yellow" over the Parc de la Gatineau,
  along the Ottawa River.
       On Saturday, March 15, at 10:15 p.m., a total of
  10 eyewitnesses told CEIPI that they saw "an unknown
  object" hovering close to the ice on the Ottawa River.
  The UFO had six arrays of white light and appeared
  in the same place in the Parc de la Gatineau off
  Route 148 as the previous night.
       On Monday, March 17, at 9:50 p.m., another ten
  witnesses saw "a very brilliant and strong" aerial
  light glowing behind the mountain at Breckenridge.
       According to Jean Casault of CEIPI, the Aylmer
  police reportedly told his group that the lights were
  "military flares" being lit on the firing range at CFB
  Connaught, near Ottawa.
       Meanwhile, below the border, radio buff Tony
  O'Neill switched on his BC860XLT 100-channel
  12-band Uniden Bearcat scanner.  At 7:20 p.m. on
  Monday, March 17, he picked up an intriguing
  exchange between Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs)
  and six jetliner pilots.
       The pilots were talking to the ATCs in Albany,
  New York and Burlington, Vermont, he said.  "One
  pilot radioed 'A bright light approached us, went
  vertical and dropped into the horizon.'"
       The pilot asked both ATCs to confirm his
  position, and they did--the jetliner was 30 miles
  (48 kilometers) east of Burlington or 150 miles
  (240 kilometers) northeast of Albany.  That puts
  the UFO over the forest area just south of
  Hardwick, Vermont (population 1,476)
       Six pilots discussed the sighting with the
  towers, O'Neill said, describing the UFO as
  having "fire coming out of the back and left or
  made a contrail."  Controllers asked the pilots
  if they would be willing to file a report.  Some said
  yes and were given the phone number of the Federal
  Aviation Administration (FAA) center in Nashua, New
  Hampshire. (Email Interview)

  of CEIPI for this report.)
 
  ANOTHER MYSTERY OBJECT
  SEEN IN FLORIDA KEYS
 
       At 6:30 a.m. on January 24, 1997, Sherry Howell
  and her husband left Key West to drive back to their
  home in Florida.  As they drove north on Route 1, a
  thunderstorm crowded the western horizon over the
  Gulf of Mexico.  At 7:30 a.m., just north of Marathon
  (population 1,500), "we were crossing a bridge when
  I saw the first one," Sherry reported.  "Then I saw what
  seemed to be a cloud...it developed into an object like
  the first only much lower on the horizon and much
  closer to the highway."
       While her husband drove, Sherry snapped some
  photos of both objects.  "The (second) object was no
  more than a half-mile from us.  The other was much
  higher in the sky and so it was more difficult to estimate
  distance.  Both objects were silvery gray."
       She estimated that the more distant UFO was "the
  size of a man's thumbnail at arm's length" while the
  closer one was "larger than a bus."
       "The front of the larget object had a darker gray
  front," she said, "It reminded me of the front of a
  microwave (oven).  Neither object moved while we were
  observing them."
       Mrs. Howell sent her roll of film to a developer.
  But the finished photos showed only the dark overcast
  sky--not the objects.  (Email Interview)
 
  FAST FLYBY ON FRANCE'S
  MEDITERRANEAN SHORE
 
       On Monday, March 17, 1997, at 9:04 a.m., "a bright
  streak" appeared in the sky over Montpellier, a seaport
  city on the Mediterranean midway between Nimes and
  Narbonne.  The object was seen by commuters driving
  to work and by mothers dropping off their children at
  school.  Witnesses described the UFO as "moving
  very fast from the northeast to the southeast."
       The UFOs semi-circular flight path was confirmed
  by the pilot of an Air France jetliner, who spotted the
  object at 30,000 feet over Montpellier.  "The phenomenon
  disappeared very quickly."  (Many thanks to SOS OVNI
  for this report.)
 
  UFO ZAPS TEENAGED GIRL IN
  PUNTA ARENAS, CHILE
 
       On or about February 25, 1997, teenager Maria
  Amparo Galvez was walking home from school in her
  hometown of Puerto Arenas, at the southern tip of
  Chile, when a glowing UFO suddenly appeared.
       According to Carlos Munoz, an investigator for
  Agrupacion de Investigaciones Ovniologicas (AION),
  Maria ran away and "was hit in the back by many
  small balls of light--flashes that peppered her back."
       Maria remembers nothing else of the strange
  incident except "waking up at another location
  four hours later."
       On February 24, 1997, an odd "ring-shaped OVNI"
  (Spanish acronym for UFO) was seen hovering above
  Lago (Lake) de Rapel in the Andes.
       The following day, February 25, 1997, Fuerzas
  Aereas de Chile's (Chilean Air Force's) crack aerobatics
  team, Los Halcones, was performing at an air show in
  Pucon when a UFO slipped into the restricted airspace.
       "The object was ring-like," AION reported, "It looked
  like a ring of smoke but very bright.  It turned on its axis
  and left the area very slowly (about 60 mph), moving
  east.  The object was filmed by two different witnesses,
  one of them the air traffic controller at Pucon."

  TWO SAUCERS SIGHTED NEAR
  AIRPORT IN LIMA, PERU
 
       On Monday, March 17, 1997, at 11 p.m., people
  living in Boca Negra, a suburban town at the north end
  of Aeropuerto Internacional Jorge Chavez spotted two
  disc-shaped UFOs beyond the airport's runway, near
  the beach.  Boca Negra is 20 kilometers (12 miles)
  north of Lima, the capital of Peru.
       According to China's Xinhua news agency, about
  a dozen witnesses described the UFOs as "saucer-
  shaped craft...with multicolored lights flashing
  intermittently."  The UFOs hovered for several minutes
  and then flew away to the northeast.  (Many thanks
  to Erik S. for this story.)
 
  NEW SIGHTING IN NORTHEAST
  CORNER OF BRAZIL
 
       On February 22, 1997, at 4:58 p.m., Messias de
  Oliveira was walking through the Bairro de Nordexte
  in Aracagi, a town in Brazil's northeastern state of
  Joao Pessoa.  Aracagi is close to Guarabira, which
  has been the focus of a UFO flap that began on
  April 4, 1996.
       As she walked by the Compostagem bus stop,
  she saw "an oval-shaped light, extremely bright,
  rising into the air, giving the appearance of being
  hidden behind the bus station.  It gave off whitish
  smoke."  At first, Messias "thought it was a teardrop
  shaped fireworks display before realizing it was far
  stranger than that."  She thought, "It's going to fall,"
  but "the object continued to rise noiselessly into the
  air."  She was reportedly "shaken by the experience."

  T.A.S.K. AND THE SAUCER OF
  MADISON COUNTY
 
       On Wednesday, March 12, 1997, at 8 p.m., a huge
  "flying disc" estimated to be 100 feet (30 meters) in
  diameter, appeared over Mount Sterling, Ohio
  (population 1,623), a small town in Madison County
  22 miles (35 kilometers) southwest of Columbus.
       The saucer was seen by two couples, one at each
  end of the town.  They estimated that it floated 50
  feet (15 meters) off the ground and flew from east to
  west.  "It was over the town for four and a half minutes.
  There was no noise.  The departure path was to the
  west at a very quick speed."
       According to investigator Jim Donohue of Equinox,
  the eyewitnesses included a woman age 35, a girl
  age 14, a man in his early 70s and another man in
  his middle 50s.
       The same night, at 9:15 p.m., Ron Schaffner of
  Tri-States Advocates of Scientific Knowledge
  (T.A.S.K.) received a call from a farmer in Aberdeen
  (population 1,600), a town on the Ohio River.  The
  man reported "a formation of three to five lights"
  and the lights "appeared orange or white-red in color.
  Three lights in a row, then two on top."
       The same farm was visited by a smilar array of
  UFO lights the night of October 16, 1996.  The UFOs
  appeared near the zenith of the barn on Flaugher
  Hill Road in Aberdeen.  Three T.A.S.K. members,
  Kenneth Young, Terry Enders and Dale Farmer,
  interviewed the farmer back in October.  The group's
  investigation in Aberdeen continues.  (Many thanks
  to Kenneth Young, T.A.S.K. public relations
  director, for this story.)
 
  From the UFO Files...
 
  WHERE IS JOAN WILLIAMS?
 
       One of the strangest cases in the annals of the
  Lake Michigan Triangle took place 32 years ago
  this week.
       "She was Joan Williams, 39, a Chicago Heights
  (Illinois) schoolteacher who owned a Cessna 170B,
  N2522C.  She left Wings Airport, Chicago, at noon
  on a Saturday morning, March 20, 1965, carrying
  fuel sufficient for four hours, 30 minutes.  She was
  not on a flight plan.  She has not been seen since."
       "For some reason the case stimulated the
  interest of the Chicago newspapers.  It stayed in the
  headlines for weeks as officials searched vainly for
  some evidence of what happened.  Virtually everyone
  Miss Williams knew was contacted.  Her bank records
  and personal life were investigated thoroughly on the
  chance that the disappearance was intentional.  The
  lake (Lake Michigan) was combed for some scrap of
  wreckage that might solve the mystery."
       But the search was in vain.  Joan Williams's
  Cessna vanished from the FAA radar scope while
  the plane was airborne southwest of Ludington,
  Michigan.  She has not been seen since.
