 <p>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who "spake by the mouth of his holy <i>prophets</i>, which have been since the world began." (St. Luke 1:70).</p>  
 <p>The Prophets went before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; to give light to them that sat in darkness and in the shadow of death; to guide their feet into the <i>way of peace</i>.</p>  
 <p>There have always been prophets and there always will be prophets; they are with us today. Wordsworth said: "Mighty Prophet! Seer blest, On whom those truths do rest, Which we are toiling all our lives to find."</p>  
 <p>In Old Testament times there were orders or bands of prophets, called <i>schools of the prophets</i>. In New Testament times Christian prophets constituted an order ranking next to that of apostle. The Moslems had Mohammed, the Mormons had Joseph Smith and the Christian Scientists had Mary Baker Eddy. Those who are discerning the signs of God and are telling the people of what the future holds are still exercising the office of <i>Prophet</i>.</p>  
 <p>Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi were prophets along with others during the Old Testament days. Of course, Isaiah and Ezekiel seem to have had more direct contact with</p>  
 <p><a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 248</font></a></p>  
 <p>space intelligences than any of the others. Many of their writings are no longer available, such as "The Acts of Uzziah" written by Isaiah. (See II Chronicles 26:22).</p>  
 <p>Chapter Six of Isaiah was referred to in <i>Maldek And Malona</i>, showing us that this prophet was visited by space intelligences and thereby received his information for prophecy. Isaiah, himself, was a "Wanderer", a "Son of Light". To show that he knew of extraterrestrial visitation to Earth, he wrote:</p>  
 <p>"Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these <i>things</i>, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth." (Isaiah 40:26).</p>  
 <p>David had said: "He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names." (Psalms 147:4).</p>  
 <p>Isaiah wasn't referring to <i>things</i> or <i>stars</i> alone, and he didn't mean the light they gave off in the heavens. By "host" he meant the intelligences that were coming earthward from the heavenly bodies.</p>  
 <p>Isaiah's prophecy in Chapter Five could easily refer to the present time as well as it did the prophet's time. The vineyard and the wild grapes therein symbolizes our world of today and its people. In one of the new editions of the Bible, the following verses are omitted. Chapter Five ends with verse twenty-five. Why were these verses taken out after all these years?</p>  
 <p>"And he will lift up an ensign to the nations</p>  
 <p><a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 249</font></a></p>  
 <p>from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly: None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken: Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind: Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it. And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow (distress), and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof (when it is light, it shall be dark in the destructions thereof). (Isaiah 5:26-30).</p>  
 <p>The space friends have "wheels like whirlwinds", their "arrows (truth) are sharp", they "come with speed swiftly", and they shall "lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe".</p>  
 <p>Ezekiel had his encounter with space craft many years after Isaiah in 595 B.C. He gets off to a grand start in Chapter One giving us a perfect description of Flying Saucers, their landing, and their occupants getting out. Although the entire verses being transposed and generally mixed up, we can obtain a comprehensive view of the situation by careful reading and proper correlation. Remember that Ezekiel had no mechanical contrivances with which to make comparisons and he was therefore compelled to use</p>

 <p>the only things with which he was familiar--animals, birds, and horse-drawn chariots with <i>wheels</i>.</p>  
 <p>In this connection the Tetramorph of Greek art is interesting. (See <a href="#img_pl16">Plate XVI</a>). This symbolic drawing was taken from a Byzantine Mosaic in the Convent of Vatopedi on Mt. Athos. The principal figure is that of a Man, the three heads of the other creatures appearing from behind, and six large wings covered with eyes are arranged around the heads and across the body of the Man, whose feet rest on fiery <i>wheels</i> which are also winged (indicating flight). All the heads are invested with plain nimbi. The Tetramorph was the ancients' idea or conception of what Ezekiel saw that day in 595 B.C. by the River of Chebar. It is one of the world's earliest known drawings of Saucers.</p>  
 <p>The verses in Chapter One which make the most sense in the light of our modern knowledge of space-craft will be given in that order.</p>  
 <p>"And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding (catching) itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire." (Ezekiel 1:4).</p>  
 <p>Many of the spacecraft sighted within the last few years have displayed a very bright amber glow.</p>  
 <p>"And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. And their feet were straight feet (a straight foot); and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass." (Ezekiel 1:6-7).</p>  
 <p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 252</font></a></p>  
 <p>We shall see in a moment why they had four faces and four wings. The "straight foot" is, of course, the ball-bearing landing-gear-like devices on the bottom of some Saucers with their contact points.</p>  
 <p>"Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one <i>straight forward</i>. As for the likeness of their faces; they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side: they four also had the face of an eagle." (Ezekiel 1:9-10).</p>  
 <p>"And they went every one straight forward: <i>whither the spirit</i> was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went." (Ezekiel 1:12).</p>  
 <p>This could easily represent a fleet of four space craft or Saucers with their insignia shown on the sides, designating what portion of the heavens they come from. A man; a lion; an ox (bull); and an eagle. One represented the Constellation Aquarius (Man); one the Constellation Leo (Lion); one the Constellation Taurus (Ox or Bull); and one the Constellation Scorpio (Eagle). For the complete reconstruction of the ancient Scale of Four see Plate XVII. When reading this plate on the hidden meaning of the Four, the vertical columns should be considered as separate units, so that, when you read down in any of the four columns, you will discover all related material. Likewise, when you read across from left to right in the horizontal lines or sections, you will discover four items that are all related.</p>

 <p>Since Ezekiel could not conceive of a bird being able to fly in "any direction" without turning around, and since the Saucers did fly or go in any direction without turning, he naturally had to add wings to all four sides in order to remedy that defect, and also to protect himself and his writings from the uniformed populace. If there had been a Project "Whirlwind" (Saucer) in Ezekiel's time he would have been ridiculed indeed; and probably was by many.</p>  
 <p>Ezekiel didn't realize that the Saucers were separate from their respective occupants. He thought the men in the Saucers were the spirits of the wheels; to him the Saucers were living things!</p>  
 <p>"Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of <i>four living creatures</i>. And this was their appearance; they had the <i>likeness of a man</i>." (Ezekiel 1:5).</p>  
 <p>Now that the Saucers are on the ground perhaps we can find out more about them.</p>  
 <p>"Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces." (Ezekiel 1:15).</p>  
 <p>Two-faced men are bad enough, but Ezekiel would have had a difficult time, indeed, with four-faced men. However, the prophet did not mean that the living creatures had four faces, he meant the wheels had "four faces".</p>  
 <p>"The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of a beryl: <i>and they four had one likeness</i>: and their appearance and their work was as it were <i>a wheel in the middle of a wheel</i>." (Ezekiel 1:16).</p>  
 <p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 255</font></a></p>  
 <p>"As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings (strakes) were full of eyes round about them four. And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature (spirit of life) was in the wheels." (Ezekiel 1:18-20).</p>  
 <p>"And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the color of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above." (Ezekiel 1:22).</p>  
 <p>The firmament over the heads of the living creatures is, of course the dome, and the "eyes round about" were the portholes or observation openings of a Flying Disc or Saucer (Compare Adamski's photographs in "<i>Flying Saucers Have Landed</i>"). The word "rings" can also be translated "strakes" which is a shipbuilding term. It means one breadth of plates along the bottom or sides of a vessel reaching from stem to stern. Now the first word "rings" in verse eighteen cannot be translated "strakes," therefore it should read: "As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their strakes were full of eyes round about them four." It means that the counter-rotating rings of the underneath portion of the Saucer "were so high that they were dreadful",</p>  
 <p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 256</font></a></p>  
 <p>and the strakes or sides of the Saucer which were composed of one breadth "were full of eyes round about them four". This latter description means that all four Saucers had the porthole openings.</p>  
 <p>The phrase, "when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up", means that when the occupants of the Saucers were in their ships, they both (creatures and wheels) left the ground together.</p>  
 <p>The "firmament" or dome of the Saucers was like "the color of the terrible crystal". On top of each dome there is a light or lamp that sends forth a terrifically bright beam. This corresponds to the "polar vent" area of our own big "spaceship", the Earth. Usually this light is a "pulsating" light and changes colors. It would have appeared "terrible" to Ezekiel, indeed.</p>  
 <p>"And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings. And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain (the rainbow),</p>  
 <p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 257</font></a></p>  
 <p>so was the appearance of the brightness round about." (Ezekiel 1:25-28).</p>  
 <p>In the November, 1953 issue of <i>Mystic Magazine</i>, Orfeo M. Angelucci told his story of contact with space beings to Paul M. Vest. Here is part of what he said: "But even as the glowing red orb vanished two smaller discs came from it. These discs were a soft fluorescent green and shot toward me like shooting stars. They streaked down in front of my car and hovered about fifteen feet directly in front of me. I judged them to be about thirty inches each in diameter. Hanging silently in the air like iridescent bubbles, their green light fluctuated in pulsations. As I gazed at those two eerie balls of green fire I heard a masculine voice, strong, well-modulated and speaking perfect English. The voice apparently came from <i>between</i> the two green discs." Again, he said: "The glowing discs created a soft illumination, but I could see no person anywhere. The voice stated that the small green discs were instruments of transmission and reception comparable to nothing developed on Earth. Then the voice added that through the discs I was in direct communication with friends from another planet." Then Orfeo said: "The area between the discs began to glow with a soft green light which gradually formed itself into a kind of luminous screen as the discs themselves faded perceptibly. Within that luminous, three-dimensional screen there appeared images of the heads and shoulders of two persons, as though in a cinema close-up." He continued:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 258</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> "Those two figures struck me somehow as being the ultimate of human perfection. There was a nobility about them, their eyes were larger and much more expressive and they emanated a kind of radiance that gave me a sense of wonder." Orfeo said that he had the feeling while they studied him that they knew every thought that passed in his mind: "I seemed to be in telepathic communication with them, for thoughts, understandings, and new comprehensions flashed through my consciousness that would have required hours of conversation to transmit."</p>  
 <p>If Angelucci's experience had taken place in 595 B.C., he too, would have been a prophet like <a href="errata.htm#23">Ezekiel</a>. Instead he is a Prophet of the New Age now dawning on Earth.</p>  
 <p>Considering the strange experience of Angelucci, we can interpret Ezekiel 1:25-28, as follows:</p>  
 <p>A voice came from the dome of the hovering Saucer. Then, Ezekiel says that above the dome "was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone". Notice he doesn't say an actual throne, but "the <i>likeness</i> of a throne". Later he says "the <i>likeness</i> as the appearance of a man". Therefore, the throne and the man were not actually there--only their <i>likeness</i>. They were projected there, even as the man and woman were projected between the two green discs observed by Orfeo. Then, Ezekiel tells us that he saw the "appearance of fire", and that "it had brightness round about; as the appearance of the rainbow, so was the appearance</p>  
 <p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 259</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the brightness round about". Ezekiel was seeing the aura of the space visitor speaking to him from some sort of highly evolved television system. Where was this visitor? He is separate and distinct from the four living creatures, or occupants of the Saucers. Possibly he was as far away as the planet Saturn as we shall see presently.</p>  
 <p>The prophet says the throne appeared as "a sapphire stone". The ruby, or red corundum, is almost never called sapphire, but all other gem varieties are, as white, <i>green</i>, purple, and yellow sapphire. Therefore, a "sapphire stone" can be <i>green!</i> Besides, the color sapphire blue is <i>greenish-blue</i> in hue. Again this sounds very similar to Orfeo Angelucci's experience. In Ezekiel 1:16, we read: "The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of a <i>beryl</i>. "An emerald is a rich green variety of beryl; and the beryl is commonly green or bluish-green--aquamarine and emerald are varieties. Again the <i>green</i> color!</p>  
 <p>The gem sapphire is usually the birthstone of April and Taurus. And Taurus is ruled by Venus. This gem has been ascribed to Saturn, and to Venus. It was mentioned in <i>Revelation</i> as one of the foundations of the New Jerusalem. Moses and Aaron saw the God of Israel with a paved work of sapphire under his feet.</p>  
 <p>"And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness." (Exodus 24:10).</p>  
 <p><a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 260</font></a></p>  
 <p>The Book of Revelation also speaks of a similar happening and that will be discussed a little later on.</p>  
 <p>One legend about Aaron's rod says that it was made of <i>sapphire</i>. Sapphires are used against the evil eye and witchcraft of all kinds; the gem is said to exert good influence on its owners.</p>  
 <p>The beryl is designated the birthstone of October or Scorpio. Some Bible authorities claim it was one of the stones in the High Priest's breastplate and one of the foundation stones of the New Jerusalem. It was sometimes used to make <i>crystal balls!</i> Saucers or Crystal Bells of Beryl, indeed!</p>  
 <p>It is possible, therefore, that one of the Saucers of the four came from Venus, representing the Constellation of Taurus (Ox or Bull,), and the "voice of one that spake" could have been the voice of the Head (Kadar) of the Universal Tribunal on Saturn.</p>  
 <p>Then in Ezekiel 1:28, we read: "This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake."</p>  
 <p>"And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee. And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me unto my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me." (Ezekiel 2:1-2).</p>  
 <p>When the prophet says that "the spirit entered into" him when the voice "spake unto" him, he means that telepathic communication had been set up--the same thing again as the Angelucci experience!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 261</font></a></p>  
 <p>"And he said unto me, Son of Man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation (nations) that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day." (Ezekiel 2:3).</p>  
 <p>Here, Ezekiel is being sent unto the people as Isaiah was sent: "And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not." (Isaiah 6:9).</p>  
 <p>Isaiah and the Saucers were discussed in <i>Maldek and Malona</i>. Both prophets had encounters with extraterrestrial beings and then were told to go forth and give the message to the people. The very same thing is happening today in our twentieth century!</p>  
 <p>Ezekiel goes on to make many references to Flying Saucers. In Ezekiel 3.12-15, we read: "Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place. I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched (kissed) one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing. So that spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness (bitter), in the heat of my spirit, but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me. Then I came to them to the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar."</p>  
 <p>Ezekiel could truthfully say that he "rode a Flying Saucer". The "great rushing" was the characteristic <i>humming</i> of a space craft.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 262</font></a></p>  
 <p>In Chapter Ten, the prophet speaks of the vision of the Cherubim and the Wheels.</p>  
 <p>"Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a <i>sapphire</i> stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne." (Ezekiel 10:1).</p>  
 <p>Here we encounter the <i>greenish-blue</i> color again. And the prophet says, "<i>as it were</i> a sapphire stone." This means it appeared to be <i>like</i> a sapphire stone, but was not actually such a thing.</p>  
 <p>"And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone. And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel." (Ezekiel 10:9-10).</p>  
 <p>The cherubim here represent the occupants of the Saucers. So, Ezekiel had another contact with the four Saucers! One Saucer was by one occupant, and so on. Again they appeared <i>green</i>.</p>  
 <p>"As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel." (Ezekiel 10:13).</p>  
 <p>This can also be translated: "As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, wheel, or <i>galgal</i>."</p>  
 <p>Ezekiel says the cherubim "mounted up from the earth" in his sight, "and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above". (Ezekiel 10:19).</p>  
 <p>A Saucer increasing its speed and going through various color changes, all the time glowing brilliantly,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 263</font></a></p>  
 <p>would indeed appear as "the glory of the God of Israel".</p>  
 <p>"And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one <i>straight forward</i>." (Ezekiel 10:22).</p>  
 <p>In Chapter Eleven, we read: "Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the Lord's house." (Ezekiel 11:1).</p>  
 <p>"Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city." (Ezekiel 11:22-23).</p>  
 <p>The colorful, pulsating, glowing Saucers went straight up from the "midst of the city" and hovered over the mountain "on the east side of the city".</p>  
 <p>Pages and pages of interpretation could be written about Ezekiel's Saucer experiences, but enough has been given here to show the connection. Every verse seems to hold new, important information. For instance, Ezekiel 1:13: "As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coal of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning."</p>  
 <p>This sounds very similar to the experience of ex-Mayor Oskar Linke, of Gleimershausen, near Meiningen, Germany. Herr Linke and his eleven year-old</p>  
 <p><a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 264</font></a></p>  
 <p>stepdaughter, Gabriele, saw a Saucer that had landed and they observed two human figures near it clothed in a kind of <i>shimmering metallic substance</i>. Herr Linke said, "I noticed that one man appeared to be carrying a <i>lamp on his chest . . . the lamp flashed on and off regularly</i>."</p>  
 <p>In describing the "take off' of the Saucer, Linke made such statements as: "The color at first seemed green, then changed to red. At the same time I heard a slight hum. The whole object rose slowly. The rate of ascent now became much greater, and at the same time we heard a whistling sound, rather like the noise made by a falling bomb, but not nearly so loud. The object rose in a horizontal position, swerved away toward a nearby village and disappeared, still climbing over the hills and forests <a href="errata.htm#24">toward</a> Stockheim."</p>  
 <p>Ezekiel's living creatures appeared like "burning coals of fire." Linke's human figures appeared like "shimmering metallic substances". Ezekiel's living creatures had the appearance of lamps, and the fire went <i>up and down</i> among the living creatures. Linke's human figure had something which appeared to be a lamp on his chest, and the lamp flashed <i>on and off</i> regularly. Herr Linke and the prophet Ezekiel had an almost identical experience, even to the color of <i>green</i>, and the Saucer going "up from the midst" and being over the mountains and hills, and the "noise of a great rushing" and the "whistling sound".</p>  
 <p>Isaiah and Ezekiel are not the only ones mentioned</p>  
 <p><a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 265</font></a></p>  
 <p>in the Bible who had Saucer contact. Job 40:6, may refer to a contact: "Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the <i>whirlwind</i>, and said . . ." Saucers have <i>always</i> been with us, and the Bible itself is a record of early contacts. The Bible, because of many translations, mistakes made by scribes, and deliberate tampering by men, is not <i>perfect</i>, but it does give us fairly accurate historical reports, especially in the Old Testament.</p>  
 <p>"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim (Two hosts)." (Genesis 32:1-2).</p>  
 <p>"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. And Elisha saw it. (II Kings 2:11-12).</p>  
 <p>Elijah had completed his mission and was removed by a Saucer. Because of this Elijah was translated and Elisha was endowed. The latter took up the mantle of the former and carried on.</p>  
 <p>Elijah left Earth in "a chariot of fire" in 896 B.C., and for three years afterward, Elisha traveled about the country doing a great deal of good. He cured the sick, raised the dead, fed the hungry, and spread the word of God. There were subversives in those days too, and Elisha was in trouble with the King of Syria, and the king sent an army to capture the man of God.</p>  
 <p>"Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a></p>  
 <p>and a great (heavy) host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about. And when the servant (minister) of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do? And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, <i>the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. And when they came down to him</i>, Elisha prayed unto the Lord, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha." (II Kings 6:14-18).</p>  
 <p>Here is a positive statement that there is a marked difference between the chariots of the king and the "chariots of fire". These "fire chariots" <i>came down</i>--and they couldn't possibly come down unless they were first up. And Elisha didn't wait there until hundreds of "chariots of fire" rolled and rumbled down the mountain-side--they had been on the mountain, "the mountain was full of" them--but they "came down" to Elisha, gliding noiselessly as only Saucers can do.</p>  
 <p>The "heavenly host" or Saucer intelligences were watching over the men of God in ancient times, even as today. <i>The Prophets</i> received their information directly from space intelligences and relayed</p>  
 <p><a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a></p>  
 <p>it on--usually to <i>The Remnant</i>, for members of this group were the special charge of prophets.</p>  
 <p>Remember that <i>The Wanderers</i>, in a sense are "Sons of Light", but the term fits space intelligences in space craft in a more direct way. In the "Golden Scripts", we read:</p>  
 <p>"The Sons of Light array themselves at my bid-ding: they go forth in the world and make it beautiful." (G. S. 209:1).</p>  
 <p>"The Sons of Light are of the Host; they are a creation of the Father for a purpose; men call them angels; they are called Sons of Light by the Father's cohorts." (G. S. 209: 3-4).</p>  
 <p>In Chapter 209, verse 2, we read: "They are a goodly company indeed, but not the Goodly Company that findeth me through suffering." Here the Elder Brother is saying that the space intelligences in the Saucers are a part of the goodly company, but not the Goodly Company of "Wanderers" who go in and out of life on Earth to help their fellow man and thereby suffer.</p>  
 <p>"They are endowed with infallible powers in Matter, in that Matter obeyeth them; Matter is their servant: they have dominion over it. They know neither time nor space but transfer themselves from planet unto planet in the twinkling of an eye. They come and go upon the Father's business: great is their joy therein: they are pure in heart and beauteous of mien. They seek to do the Father's will, and in that they seek, they do find life wondrous." (G. S. 209: 6-9).</p>  
 <p><a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 268</font></a></p>  
 <p>"I tell you, be advised! Ye are as gods yourselves among men; the Sons of Light are your ministering servants." (G. S. 209:21).</p>  
 <p>"Do I speak unto you of mysteries? I say that ye shall know them in the Day of Understanding. Behold my <a href="errata.htm#25">ministers</a> who are Sons of Light manifesting, have orders of me that ye be protected in your thought and persons when it so cometh that ye advance my Plan." (G. S. 209:31-32).</p>  
 <p>"Hear my words and be wise! I speak as a teacher who is honored with wisdom." (G. S. 209:36).</p>  
 <p>On page twenty-five of <i>I Rode A Flying Saucer</i>, by George W. Van Tassel, there is a message dated May 17, 1952. In part, it reads: "My center has given me authority to describe vaguely this ship I command. In your dimensions my, what you would call 'flagship', is three-hundred feet thick, and fifteen-hundred feet in diameter. Our crew <i>seventy-two hundred</i>."</p>  
 <p>The fact that the crew numbered seventy-two hundred is very significant and if we go to our Bible, we discover why.</p>  
 <p>"And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's and smote off his ear. Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than <i>twelve legions of angels?</i> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 269</font></a></p>  
 <p>thus it must be?" (St. Matthew 26:51-54).</p>  
 <p>In designating the number of angels the Father would send if Jesus requested them, the Master used the then familiar Roman military unit, the legion. A legion varied from the time of the early re-public until the empire in the number of men composing it. The Emperor Marius made many changes in its basic structure. However, the legion Triarii consisted of six-hundred men; this was the third line of the Roman army. Therefore, twelve Triarii equalled <i>seventy-two hundred men</i>, the same number as the crew of the space 'flagship".</p>  
 <p>There is a cross-reference in the Bible to "twelve legions of angels" found in St. Matthew 26:53 which is quoted above. That cross-reference refers us back to II Kings 6:17, which has already been mentioned, but it will be quoted again for emphasis.</p>  
 <p>"I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round Elisha."</p>  
 <p>In going back to the year 4004 B.C., we find in Genesis 5:24, the following:</p>  
 <p>"And Enoch walked with God and he was not; for God took him." Again there is another cross-reference and it refers us to II Kings 2:11, which has already been quoted. There is mention of Enoch in Hebrews 11:5: "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased</p>  
 <p><a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 270</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> God."</p>  
 <p>Look at the Bible dates as they are recorded. In the first chapter of Genesis, first verse you will find the beginning of the story of the creation of the Earth. At the head of the center column reference is the date 4004 B.C. At the end of chapter three, after God had driven Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden, there is the date 4003 B.C., or, one year later than the beginning of Creation. In chapter five where the generations of Adam are listed, counting forward to the removal of Enoch, there is a lapse of nine-hundred eighty-five years, but the date at the head of the column is again 4004 B.C. How come?</p>  
 <p>Science has proven beyond a doubt that the Earth is millions of years old. Besides, there are in existence a number of documents dated much earlier than the alleged Bible date of creation. In the book, <i>Ancient Times, A History Of The Early World</i>, by James Henry Breasted, on page 45, chapter 61, we find reference to the Egyptian culture: "He decided to use the Moon no longer for dividing his year. He would have twelve months, and he would make his months all the same length, that is, thirty days each; then he would celebrate five feast days; a kind of holiday week that was five days long at the end of the year. This gave him a year of three-hundred sixty-five days. He was not enough of an astronomer to know that every four years he ought to have a leap year of three-hundred sixty-six days although he discovered this fact later. This convenient</p>  
 <p><a name="page_271"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 271</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Egyptian calendar was devised in 4241 B.C. and its introduction is the <i>earliest dated event in history</i>. Furthermore, this calendar is the very one which has descended to us, after more than six thousand years, unfortunately with awkward alterations in the length of the months, but for these alterations the Egyptians were not responsible."</p>  
 <p>The calendar we use today was devised two-hundred thirty-seven years <i>before</i> the Earth was created if we want to accept the Bible dates. However, Archbishop Ussher (1581-1656 A.D.) figured out much of the Bible chronology and dated certain events by it. The dates, therefore, are not actually <a href="errata.htm#26">scriptural</a>, but man-made. Certain Fundamental Christian groups believe the world was really created on October 23, 4004 B.C. The question that immediately comes up is: 'What was going on the day before, October 22nd? If the world hadn't been created yet, there couldn't have been an October, since that month was devised by man many years later!</p>  
 <p>"Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire." (Psalms 104:3-4). Again there is a cross-reference to II Kings 2:11.</p>  
 <p>"The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place." (Psalms 68:17).</p>  
 <p>There are cross-references here to II Kings 6:16-17, already quoted. Daniel 7:9-10; Hebrews 12:20-22;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 272</font></a></p>  
 <p><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> Deuteronomy 33 are also referred to.</p>  
 <p>"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head was like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him (and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set and the books were opened." (Daniel 7:9-10).</p>  
 <p>Daniel and all the other prophets saw great fiery objects come down from the heavens and they con-versed with tremendous numbers of <a href="errata.htm#27">celestial</a> beings who emerged from these objects--these beings instructed the prophets in the beauteous laws of love. More will be said about Daniel in <i>The Remnant</i>. A colossal program of aid, comfort and instruction was instituted with <i>The Prophets</i>. Of course, the Bible account is somewhat confused due to the many translations and alterations, and in some cases the deliberate attempt to cover up the truth in order to keep the mass of people "ignorant". However, people who know the truth are not dependent upon theological dogma or doctrine to "save them" or make them free: "Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free."</p>  
 <p>"For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart: And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake: But ye are come unto</p>  
 <p><a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a></p>  
 <p>mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels." (Hebrews 12:20-22).</p>  
 <p>"As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: So the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him." (Deuteronomy 32:11).</p>  
 <p>"And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. And he said, The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law (fire of law) for them." (Deuteronomy 33:1-2).</p>  
 <p>All the foregoing seems to point to a great company of angels, or heavenly host, who had descended to Earth to give Moses and his people specific information, and they warned Moses and the people not to come near as the force field surrounding the ships might injure them. This has happened in our time also, when space intelligences have warned individuals about getting too close to the ships while they are hovering. Adamski, Bethurum, and Fry experienced this. The ancient people could easily understand death or injury as a result of a stone, dart, or arrow wound; but they knew nothing of radiation, or rays, beams, or electro-magnetic energy.</p>  
 <p>"In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. For they</p>  
 <p><a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 274</font></a></p>  
 <p>were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself." (Exodus 19:1-4).</p>  
 <p>Now, only those verses which are pertinent to the subject will be quoted, since the intervening verses pertain to messages of instruction from the space beings (or the Lord, as the ancients believed) to the people, and the people's reply, with Moses acting as message bearer.</p>  
 <p>"And the Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and <i>believe thee forever</i>. And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord." (Exodus 19:9).</p>  
 <p>"And be ready against the third day: for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, <i>that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it</i>: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: There shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount." (Exodus 19:11-13).</p>  
 <p><a name="page_275"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 275</font></a></p>  
 <p>The space intelligences meant here that they would give a signal, a "trumpet" blast that "soundeth long", when it was safe for the people to come up to the mount.</p>  
 <p>"And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that were in the camp trembled." (Exodus 19:16).</p>  
 <p>"And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up." (Exodus 19:20).</p>  
 <p>Then the Lord told Moses to go down and warn the people so that they wouldn't "break through unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them perish".</p>  
 <p>"And God spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." (Exodus 20:1-2).</p>  
 <p>Then follows the Decalogue or Ten Commandments:</p>  
 <p></p><dir>1. Thou shalt have no other Gods before me.  
 <p>2. Thou shall not make unto thee any graven images.</p>  
 <p>3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.</p>  
 <p>4. Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy.</p>  
 <p>5. Honor thy father and thy mother.</p>  
 <p>6. Thou shalt not kill.</p>  
 <p>7. Thou shalt not commit adultery. <a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 276</font></a></p>  
 <p>8. Thou shalt not steal.</p>  
 <p>9. Thou shalt not bear false witness.</p>  
 <p>10. Thou shalt not covet.</p></dir>  
 <p>"And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking." (Exodus 20:18).</p>  
 <p>"When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, <i>the star</i>, which they saw in the east, <i>went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was</i>. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy." (St. Matthew 2:9-10).</p>  
 <p>"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, <i>the angel of the Lord came upon them</i>, and the <i>glory of the Lord shone round about them</i>: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord." (St. Luke 2:8-11).</p>  
 <p>"And <i>suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly host</i> praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." (St. Luke 2:13-14).</p>  
 <p>For many years astronomers have tried to justify the actions of the Star of Bethlehem. There are several theories, but no agreement has been reached as yet. The constellations and conjunctions back to that period have been checked and it is found</p>  
 <p><a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 277</font></a></p>  
 <p>that no such <i>natural</i> event took place. One well-known astronomer said: "In my opinion, the Star of Bethlehem was created especially for the event."</p>  
 <p>What manner of "star" was it that "went before them", and then "stood over", or hovered over, "where the young child was"? Saucer sightings by the thousands have proven that in the night skies, they do, indeed, look like bright and shining "stars". The "Spacecraft of Bethlehem" must have been an enormous ship specially designed and constructed for the event. (Van Tassel and Pelley also hold to this opinion).</p>  
 <p>Peace on earth, good will toward men, indeed! What have the people of Earth done with the great message of peace and good will which the Heavenly Host has brought them over the many centuries? And what are we doing with the messages they are still bringing to us? The answer is obvious: we have met peace and brotherly love with courts, prisons, want, firebombs and hellbombs, murders, lust, greed and fear. Oh, thou faithless generation!</p>  
 <p>In II Corinthians 12:2-4, Paul tells of being "caught up to the third heaven", and "caught up into paradise", where he "heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful (possible) for a man to utter". Paul's visions were his apostolic credentials.</p>  
 <p>St. John was an apostle, but he was also a prophet. The Revelation of St. John the Divine again brings in the Four Beasts and Saucers. Therefore, from Genesis to Revelation we have numerous accounts of space intelligences contacting, conversing with,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 278</font></a></p>  
 <p>and sometimes taking away, men of Earth.</p>  
 <p>Read the entire Chapter Four of Revelation. John says that a trumpet talked with him--he was "in the spirit"--"a throne was set in heaven".</p>  
 <p>"And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald." (Revelation 4:3).</p>  
 <p>In Ezekiel 1:16 the beryl was referred to! in Ezekiel 1:26, the sapphire was mentioned. Now, St. John had an experience almost identical with Ezekiel's, except the Jasper, the Sardine (Sardius), and the Emerald are used to describe the scene. All five of these stones, however, were included in the High Priest's breastplate. (See Exodus 28:17-20). A Sard or Sardine is a deep orange-red variety of chalcedony. The Sardius is either a ruby or a sard. Therefore, the color represented by these stones is <i>red</i>. The Jasper of the Bible was a dark-green or opalescent milky iridescence stone. Here is the <i>green</i> again! And the Emerald, of course, is green as everyone knows. Remember Orfeo said there was a glowing <i>red</i> orb, followed by two <i>green</i> discs? Remember Oskar Linke said that, "The color at first seemed <i>green</i>, then changed to <i>red</i>"? The <i>rainbow</i> is again mentioned as it was in Ezekiel 1:28.</p>  
 <p>Then St. John tells us that "round about the throne were four and twenty seats", and upon the seats he saw "four and twenty elders".</p>  
 <p>These twenty-four representatives could possibly constitute the Saturn Tribunal, with two members</p>  
 <p><a name="page_279"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 279</font></a></p>  
 <p>for each of the twelve planets.</p>  
 <p>John, now acting as a prophet, said: "Out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices . . . and there were <i>seven lamps of fire</i> burning before the throne . . . there was a sea of glass like unto crystal . . . round about the throne were <i>four beasts</i> full of eyes before and behind."</p>  
 <p>The seven lamps represent the Council of Seven Lights as mentioned previously. Once again, the Saucers are described.</p>  
 <p>"And the first beast was like a <i>lion</i>, and the second beast like a <i>calf</i>, and the third beast had a face as a <i>man</i>, and the fourth beast was like a flying <i>eagle</i>." (Revelation 4:7).</p>  
 <p>It should be mentioned here that the Constellation Scorpio is now thought of as a scorpion. However, from Abraham's time on up to more recent time, Scorpio was known as the "flying eagle".</p>  
 <p>When Ezekiel first mentioned the Four Beasts, the ancient Jewish initiates accused him of exposing to the profane the profundities of the secret doctrine. The cherubim constitute the mystical symbol of the fullness of wisdom and these creatures are the spiritual guardians of the four rivers of life flowing from the effulgency of the Creator. When the twelve tribes of Israel encamped in the wilderness, the banners of Reuben (the man), Judah (the lion), Ephrain (the bull), and Dan (the eagle) were placed at the four corners. In the Oedipus Judaicus, Sir W. Drummond reproduces a figure from Kircher which reveals the encampment of Israel to have been</p>  
 <p><a name="page_280"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 280</font></a></p>  
 <p>symbolic of the <i>order of the universe</i>. And, according to Iranous, there must be four Gospels of the New Testament just as there are four quarters of the world and four general winds. The church is supposed to have four pillars like the cherubim, from the midst of which the Word goes forth. The creatures of the lower senses are the four animal natures to be first overcome by man before he can enter into the sphere of light. In the Kabbalah, Adolph Franck writes: "All human faces may be traced, finally, to four primary types, to which they either draw near or from which they recede according to the rank held by the souls in their intellectual and moral order." In the Zohar it is written that the celestial throne of Ezekiel's vision signifies the <i>traditional</i> law, and the appearance of a man sitting upon the throne represents the <i>written</i> law. (Again, see Plate XVII <a href="#page_253">p. 253</a>).</p>  
 <p>There is no record today, or in Biblical times, where Saucers or Saucer beings ever deliberately injured anyone. Some people may say that the reference to "smote them with blindness" in II Kings 6:18, already referred to, means that harm or injury resulted from contact with space intelligences. However, if we read on we find that Elisha said: "Lord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw." (II Kings 6:20).</p>  
 <p>"And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them? And he answered, Thou shalt not</p>  
 <p><a name="page_281"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 281</font></a></p>  
 <p>smite them. Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master." (II Kings 6:21-22).</p>  
 <p>Therefore, the "blindness" was only temporary, for the men not only regained their sight, but they were well fed and sent on their way home.</p>  
 <p>The heavens are still full of "horses and chariots of fire"; they are here as it was promised. They are here to protect us, to guide us, to encourage us, to make us triumphant over life's circumstances on Earth. Let us be assured that we are part of a <i>living</i> Universe, not a dead universe. Beyond our sight there are other worlds more real than the one in which we live, worlds of Light and power. In those worlds God is King. Fear not, for they that are with us are more than they which are with the persons and things that oppose us.</p>  
 <p>And you who would tell the world of new things, do not be concerned whether that world hears or not, "for they are a rebellious house, yet they shall know that there hash been a <i>prophet</i> among them".</p>
