 Subject:  The Pyramid On Mars.                           May 4, 1996.
 
   Here is some information about Mars.

   Virginia:  Finally, would you comment on whether the pyramid
 reportedly found on the planet Mars was made by galactic humans:
 
   Wahta:  This was part of a great temple site that was a remnant
 a symbol and monument of the great Martian civilization which was in
 full existence until it was destroyed roughtly one million years ago.
 It was destroyed by these same dinoid groups from Maldek that we have
 just been describing!  This was when the dinoids swept out and
 attemped to destroy and reoccupy your entire solar system from
 Neptune to Mercury.  While attacking the galactic humans, they
 ravished Mars and Venus in suspeakable ways - destroying the people
 of many civilizations on your world as well.
 
   V:  So the temple represents a monument to whom?
 
   W:  It is a monument to the great sacred energies existing in all
 humans.  It is an imprint of the Galactic Federation's attempt to
 aid the Spiritual Hierarchy in the task of stewardship for your solar
 system.  It commenmorates those who resisted the great disaster
 caused by the dinoid wars - the wars perpetuated by the dinoids that
 came into your solar system and destroyed that human effort of solar
 and planetary guardianship in your region!
 
   V:  I want to thank you very much for your comments.  I am sure
 that we are continuing to learn and grow.  Have you thought of
 anything else you need to share before we depart today?
 
   W:  I would just like to mention two final points.  First, your
 planet history will soon be revealed to all it's people.  This
 history is quite different from even the wildest imaginings of most
 historians.  Second, your planet has, in its histories, a blueprint
 for Earth humans so that they may understand who they once were and
 what it is that they are soon to become.
