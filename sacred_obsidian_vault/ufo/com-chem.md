 UMass Astronomers Report Comets May Have Introduced Interstellar 
 Chemicals to Earth
 
 AMHERST, Mass. -- The brightest comet of 1996 -- Comet Hyakutake -- 
 may have shed some new light on a question that astronomers have 
 asked for centuries, "what is a comet made of?" Many scientists believe 
 that the volatile components of comets are the nearest things we know to 
 material untouched since the time of the formation of the Solar System, 
 and so provide a record of the conditions that prevailed in our primitive 
 solar nebula.
 
 Writing in the latest issue of the journal Nature (Oct. 3, 1996), University 
 of Massachusetts radio astronomer William Irvine and colleagues 
 suggest, based on recent observations of Comet Hyakutake, that comets 
 consist of the same material that made the stars themselves, and these 
 dramatic celestial objects may have been a source of some organic 
 materials on Earth. Irvine, along with UMass colleague Peter Schloerb 
 and UMass doctoral candidate Amy Lovell, help organize an 
 international team that used radio telescopes to observe Comet 
 Hyakutake when it blazed across the sky in the spring of 1996. Millions of 
 non-scientists also viewed Comet Hyakutake with only binoculars or the 
 unaided eye, as it made a spectacular pass near planet Earth.
 
 Comets are small celestial bodies that orbit the sun and thought to 
 consist mostly of dust particles and icy materials -- what some 
 astronomers informally refer to as "dirty snowballs."
 
 Irvine says that the observational evidence from viewing Hyakutake by 
 several powerful radio telescopes positioned around the world -- 
 including the 14 meter Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory 
 located near Amherst -- suggests that it contains some of the same 
 material found deep in interstellar space.
 
 "The detection of hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) in Comet Hyakutake 
 supports the idea that interstellar gases were incorporated into the 
 nucleus of this and other comets," says Irvine. Interestingly, the hydrogen 
 isocyanide was found in the same ratio to another molecule -- hydrogen 
 cyanide (HCN) -- as that observed in interstellar clouds.
 
 This measurement supports the idea that interstellar gases were 
 incorporated into the nucleus of this and other comets, perhaps as ices 
 frozen onto interstellar grains.
 
 Scientists know that material found in interstellar clouds -- such as 
 hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen -- form the basic chemistry of life 
 as we know it. Some astronomers have theorized that comets could have 
 been a delivery mechanism for pre-biological organic matter that 
 ultimately helped develop, or even triggered life on Earth.
 
 Irvine and Schloerb explain that organic molecules might have 
 congregated into comets in interstellar space billions of years ago. 
 Identifying the exotic gases and solid particles found in comets could tell 
 us much about the conditions under which the solar system, and 
 especially Earth, were formed.
 
 Irvine says that most astronomers believe the chemical and physical 
 processes that helped set the stage for the origin of life on earth occurred 
 over some ten billion years before the formation of the Earth.
 
 "Chemical and physical processes relevant to the origin of life have been 
 taking place ever since the beginning of the universe, roughly 15 billion 
 years ago," says Irvine. "It's interesting to note that with the exception of 
 phosphorus, the chemical elements of which we are made -- hydrogen, 
 carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur -- are among the most abundant in 
 the universe."
 
 Irvine says that largely as a result of extensive observations using radio 
 telescopes, a rich and complex chemistry is known to exist in dense 
 interstellar space.
 
 Does the presence of organic materials in comets make it likely that life 
 also formed in other parts of the universe? The answer isn't clear.
 
 Irvine believes that the nature of the Earth might have been much more 
 influenced by interstellar material than has been believed.
 
 "The basic building blocks of life are out there," Irvine says, "and at least 
 some of the organic matter in comets and meteorites has reached, and 
 continues to reach, the surface of the Earth relatively unaltered."
