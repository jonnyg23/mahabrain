 <p>The path of religion is neither in works nor words; there are no buildings thereon, but only desolation. Whoso becomes silent to pursue the path, his speech is life and sweetness; if he speaks, it will not be out of ignorance, and if he is silent, it will not be from sloth; when silent, he is not devising frivolity; when speaking, he scatters abroad no trifling talk.</p>
 <p>Those fools, the thieves and pickpockets, keep their knowledge to use in highway robbery. Thou seest, O Master, thou of many words, that thou hadst better have light in thy heart than words; when thou becomest silent, thou art most eloquent, but if thou speakest, thou art like a captain of war. '<i>Kun</i>,' consists of two letters, both voiceless; '<i>Hû</i>' consists of two letters, both silent. Doubt not concerning these words of mine; open thine eyes, pay heed for a little.</p>
 <p>There exists the dog, and the stone; the stove of the bath, and the slave; but thou art excellent, like a jewel inside a casket.

 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a></p>
 <p>pronounced their destruction, their name endures, indestructible as the spirit. The people of this generation, though amiable, are impudent as flies and wanton; in word they are all sweet as sugar, but when it comes to generosity, they tear men's hearts and burn their souls.</p>
 <p>When He had adorned thy soul within thee, He held up before thee the mirror of the light; till pride made thee quick to anger, and thou lookedst upon thyself with the evil eye.</p>
 <p>He has balanced day and night by the ruler of his justice, not by chance or at random.</p>
 <p>While Reason digs for the secret, thou hast reached thy goal on the plain of Love.</p>
 <p>The heart and soul of the seeker after God are concealed, but his tongue proclaims in truth, '<i>I am God</i>.'</p>
