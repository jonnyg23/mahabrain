 <p>The prince of believers  (puh) said:</p>  
 <p>1. Ruling shows the  interior of men.<br> 2. Authority is the gift of Allah on His land.<br> 3. The tool of ruling, is the wide chest. [Wide chest means to have patience].<br> 4. No ruling for him who is out of manners and runs after the play.<br> 5. No domination for him who does not bear his brothers.<br> 6. Justice is the virtue of the ruler.<br> 7. Justice is he ornament of the leadership.<br> 8. No injustice like the injustice of the ruler.<br> 9. The viceroys of injustice are the most devilish of this nation.<br> 10. The bad ministers are the helpers of the unjust ones and the brothers of the  sinners.<br> 11. Politics of passion is a good one.<br> 12. Nothing gained countries like justice.<br> 13. The rule is not complete for him who does not allow.<br> 14. Who wrongs a ruler, then he offered himself for humiliation.<br> 15. Who seeks the rule, should be patient for the bitterness of politics.<br> 16. Who rules with injustice, people shall wish for his death.<br> 17. Who takes pride in his rule, shall make his stupidity apparent.<br> 18. Who owned shall monopolize.<br> 19. Who was unjust in his ownership, he shall speed up his doom.<br> 20. Who fears your whip, shall wish for your death.<br> 21. Who entrusts your goodness, shall have the pity on your rule.<br> 22. It is but a few that the companions of the kings do last.<br> 23. In injustice, lies the doom of the people.<br> 24. Whose rule was unjust, his land shall be doomed.<br> 25. In justice, the fixation of the people.<br> 26. The fix of the people is justice.<br> 27. The most devilish of kings is he who opposes justice.<br> 28. The most devilish of viceroys, whom the innocent fears the most.<br> 29. A mighty lion that eats too much, is better than a viceroy that is ignorant  and unjust.<br> 30. The most devilish of princes, whose lust was a prince over him.<br> 31. The ornament of the king, justice.<br> 32. The time of the just is the best of times.<br> 33. The time of the unjust is the most devilish of times.<br> 34. The head of politics is to use passion.<br> 35. The best of politics, justice.<br> 36. It is a right upon the king to train himself before his soldiers.<br> 37. The love of rule, that is the head of adversities.<br> 38. The good justice, that is the system of the creations.<br> 39. The good politics, that is the straight path of the people.<br> 40. The good politics, shall make ruling last.<br> 41. The generosity of the viceroys with the money of the Muslims, that is unjust  and evil.<br> 42. The stability of lands is based on justice.<br> 43. The crown of the king is his justice.<br> 44. Your pride in ruling, is humility when isolated.<br> 45. The worst of friends are the kings.<br> 46. The worst of politics is injustice.<br> 47. By justice, the blesses are multiplied.<br> 48. By justice, the people are fixed.<br> 49. If you are made a viceroy, then be just.<br> 50. If the lower ones ruled, then the virtuous ones shall die.<br> 51. When the means conquer, the generous shall be wronged.<br> 52. If the time turned bad, at then, the mean ones shall rule.<br> 53. If the ruler made you closer, then glorify him more. [It is apparent that  this phrase concerns the just ruler, or it is in the way of avoiding the harm of  the ruler].</p>  
 <p>54. The beast of the  kings is the bad reputation.<br> 55. The beast of the leaders, the bad politics.<br> 56. The beast of ruling, the pride.<br> 57. The most dignified of princes, whose lust was not a prince over him.<br> 58. The most dignified of kings is he who owned himself and spread justice.<br> 59. The best of kings in manners is he who owns the people with his justice.<br> 60. The best of kings whose soul was more chaste.<br> 61. The most ugly thing (in life), the injustice of the viceroys.</p>
