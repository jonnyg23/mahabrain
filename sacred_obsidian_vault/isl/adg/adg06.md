 <p>The prince of believers (puh) said:</p>  
 <p>1. Do not speak to the people about  everything you hear, this is enough as a stupidity.<br> 2. Do not use the bad words even though answering is hard for you.<br> 3. No goodness lies in silence with wisdom, as there is no goodness in saying  with ignorance.<br> 4. Speak and you shall be known, for the person is hidden under his tongue.<br> 5. Do not say what you do not know, but do not say everything you know.<br> 6. If the mind is complete, speaking would be much lesser.<br> 7. The tongue is a lion, if set free it would kill.<br> 8. The heart of the stupid is in his mouth, and the tongue of the wise man is in  his heart.<br> 9. The tongue of the wise man is behind his heart, and the heart of the stupid  is behind his tongue.<br> 10. Being mute is better than lying.<br> 11. Speech has beasts for it.<br> 12. Blabbering too much shall make the guest bored and the boss dishonoured.<br> 13. Muting is better than the ill speech.<br> 14. Blabbering is a shame.<br> 15. The tongue of everyone shall speaks for his mind.<br> 16. The clue to the man's mind lies in the goodness of his speech.<br> 17. The silly one shall not be straight except by the bitter speech.<br> 18. Silence is a sign of kindness.<br> 19. The tongue is the translator of the mind.<br> 20. The clue to the mind of anyone lies in what goes on his tongue.<br> 21. The best companion for kindness, silence.<br> 22. No keeper is better than silence.<br> 23. The wise one is he who holds his tongue back.<br> 24. Do not lower someone until you make him speak.<br> 25. It is part of the man's wisdom to not speak with everything he knows.<br> 26. No keeper keeps more than silence does.<br> 27. Who holds his tongue, is safe from regretting.<br> 28. Who sets his tongue free, shows how silly he is.<br> 29. No worshipping is like being silent.<br> 30. Who gives bad talk in abundant, shall be blamed a lot.<br> 31. Do not speak with what you are afraid to be not believed.<br> 32. Who has a truthful speech, his clue shall be stronger.<br> 33. Do not accompany who has no mind.<br> 34. Who has the good speech, success lies in front of him.<br> 35. Who has the bad speech, his luck shall be bad.<br> 36. Who speaks a lot, shall be mistaken a lot.<br> 37. Who answers rapidly, shall not know the right thing.<br> 38. Who speaks a lot, people shall be bored with him.<br> 39. Who has the sweet tongue shall have brothers in abundant.<br> 40. For every level there is a speech.<br> 41. Who speaks a lot shall be mistaken.<br> 42. Who speaks in easy words shall be loved.<br> 43. Who speaks a lot, his mistakes are abundant.<br> 44. The truthful tongue for a man is more useful than money.<br> 45. Who speaks a lot shall fall down a lot.<br> 46. The speech of the man is the balance of his mind.<br> 47. Who checks his speech shall be mistaken a little.<br> 48. Who becomes silent is safe from being blamed.<br> 49. Who speaks a lot is not safe from falling.<br> 50. How many a blood that was shed by a mouth.<br> 51. How many a word that took away a favour.<br> 52. Who straightens his tongue, balanced his brain.<br> 53. Straighten your tongue and you shall be safe.<br> 54. Who speaks a little, his sins are less.<br> 55. He is a winner, the silent pious one.<br> 56. Who makes his tongue his own commander, killed himself.<br> 57. The virtue of the man is known from his saying.<br> 59. Who imprisons his tongue, is safe from regretting. [Wrong numbering in the  book itself, ignore it].<br> 60. The cover of bad things is silence.<br> 61. Blessedness for him, who is silent except for the mention of Allah.<br> 62. The silence of the ignorant is his veil.<br> 63. The law of the means to say the ugly speech.<br> 64. The mistake of the tongue would destroy the human being.<br> 65. The reason for safety is silence.<br> 66. May there be a word that stole away a favour.<br> 68. May there be a blabbering that might bring evil. [Wrong numbering in the  book itself, ignore it].<br> 69. May there be a saying that is harder than a fight.<br> 70. May there be a disturbance that was initiated by a saying.<br> 71. May there be a saying whose answer is to be silent.<br> 72. May there be a saying that silence is better than it.<br> 73. May there be a tongue that destroys the human.<br> 74. May there be a war that was started by a word.<br> 75. The clue of the mind of the man is his saying.<br> 76. The edge of the tongue is sharper than the edge of the sword.<br> 77. The beautiful saying is a sign of the good mind.<br> 78. May there be silence that is more eloquent than speech itself.<br> 79. May there be a speech that penetrates more than arrows do.<br> 80. To not answer the silly one, that is the best answer for him.<br> 81. The adversity of the human lies in his tongue.<br> 82. The speech of the man predicts his tongue's strength.<br> 83. If you want to speak, say the truth.<br> 84. If you talked, say the truth.<br> 85. May the mercy of Allah be upon him who said good and gains, or went silent  and been safe.<br> 86. If the quantity of speeches was low, then the right things done are  abundant.<br> 87. The throw that hits the target the most, the right saying.<br> 88. The silliest silly, is he who takes pride in the bad saying.<br> 89. The most tiresome time for a wise man is when he speaks to a silly man.<br> 90. The most low of wisdom is what stops on the tongue.<br> 91. The best silence is toward the mistakes.<br> 92. The worst of sayings is blabbering.<br> 93. Be aware of blabbering, for whose talk is abundant, his sins are abundant as  well.<br> 94. Be aware of the tongue, for it is an arrow that might astray.<br> 95. Avoid blabbering for the least thing it can bring is the blame.<br> 96. Hold on the silence, for the least good thing it can do is give safety.<br> 97. Hear and you will learn, and be silent and you will be safe.<br> 98. Treasure your tongue, like you do with your gold and papers.<br> 99. Lessen the talk and you are safe from the blame.<br> 100. Be silent in your time and your matter will be glorified.<br> 101. Hold on the silence and your thought will be enlightened.<br> 102. Be silent and you shall be safe.<br> 103. The wise man is he who tied his tongue except for the mention of Allah.<br>  </p>
