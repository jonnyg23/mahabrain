 <p align="left">The talk about imam  Ali (puh) is branched to many fields, for every field of virtues, he (puh) was  the first to indulge himself into it, and what such few pages would do to talk  about him and about his many virtues, and it is enough to be taken as a clue,  the speech of Ibn Abbaas, the rabbi of this nation with his knowledge, and it is  narrated that a man asked Ibn Abbaas and said: how many are the virtues of Ali  ben Abi Taalib, and I think they are 3,000... Then said Ibn Abbaas: It is closer  to 30,000 more than 3,000; and then he said: if trees were made into pens and  the sea into an ink and humans and djinns were writers and calculators, they  will never count the virtues of the prince of believers (puh).</p>  
 <p align="left">But for the wisdom  the says, what cannot be reached all, its partitions are not to be left, and who  missed the abundance should take what is left over, we are here seeking to show  some of the eloquence that the imam had, to be an introduction to read this  book, which contains pearls and wonderful things from the adages of the imam,  that stand as a clue for his long experience in this field.</p>  
 <p align="left">Eloquence:</p>  
 <p align="left">And before speaking  about the eloquence of the imam (puh), we must stop with eloquence and its  definition, in language and in general.<br> Ibn Mandhoor defines eloquence as to be the purity of language, and adds in his  speech about the eloquent man: the good speech is its purest, and reaches by the  phrase of the tongue, the interior of what is in the heart.<br> Sheikh Al-Torayhi expands what Ibn Mandhoor said, and makes a condition for the  eloquent speech on 3 terms: the correctness of the language, and a coincidence  to the desired meaning, and truthfulness in the soul.<br> In general, it is obvious that the eloquent speech is the purity of the talk and  its shortness, or what achieves the meaning in the closest way, and eloquence in  the speech includes all the types of speeches, from speeches and prose and  poetry and thoughts and sermons...etc.<br> And here we will encounter only the adages and the sermons, some of them which  came in form of a poetry or as a prose, for both of them are one, for poetry in  its shape and style, is not what charms the minds, but it is what it carries of  eternal meanings.<br> The wise saying, is born from the experience and meditating and conclusion, and  it is a phase that passed over the level of the childhood of the thought and its  youth to the level of its old age; on the other hand, the sermons coincide with  adages for they are the result of meditating and experimenting, but they are  special because they are specialized for inviting people for the after-life and  hating the finite life.</p>  
 <p align="left">Eloquence of the imam; Adages as an  Example<br> * <i><u>The facts that affected his adages:</u></i></p>  
 <p align="left">Maybe one of the most obvious things  that affected the adages of the imam, is the religion of Islam, and mainly the  book of Allah that was revealed, that is Quran. For Quran is the topmost in  eloquence and purity in language, and it is enough as a clue for this, how the  eloquent speakers of Arabs stood up surprised in front of the greatness of its  own eloquence, while they are the great owners of literature and the giants of  thought and eloquence.<br> Adding to that, the imam had a noble soul and did not accept to see the people  under humiliation. These characters are encouraged by Islam, thus the imam (puh)  went on starting from his own self and feeding his thought with the teachings of  Islam, he went on to build a unique community depending on unique ideas that he  (puh) explained in his adages and his speeches.<br> Types of adages and their subjects: the adages of imam Ali (puh) included the  different fields of life, like religion, community, manners, sermons and  politics.<br> And they are considered adages because they are general and applicable for every  place and time, and the clue for this is, is how they persisted with time, as a  live witness for how great is the imam.<br> Their characteristics and specialities: the adages of imam Ali (puh) are full  with meanings of style and alive with the spirit of sincerity and belief, and  alloyed in a block of stylized expression, so much that Abbaas Mahmood Al-Aqqaad  [a modern writer and author] said in his book Abqariyatul-Imam (The Ingenuity of  the Imam): They are (the adages) more eloquent in expression and has an  abundance in beauty of the speech.</p>  
 <p align="left">Testimonies About The Eloquence of  the Imam:</p>  
 <p align="left">- Abdul-Hameed Al-Kaatib  said: I memorized seventy speeches from the speeches of the bald man, and they  flooded me and flooded me again. [The bald man was a title used by the enemies  of imam Ali (puh) as to mock at him].</p>  
 <p align="left">- His eloquence even  attracted his fierce enemy, Mo'awiyah, when he said, when Mahnaf ben Abi-Mahnaf  said to him: I came to you from the sickest of people, and he answered him: Woe  to you! how come he is the sickest of people! by Allah no one spread the  eloquence for Quraish [the tribe of the prophet] except of him.<br> But after all the most truthful witness in all of that, is how these adages  persisted all the time, despite the many enemies of the imam, no one dared to  mention them with badness.</p>
