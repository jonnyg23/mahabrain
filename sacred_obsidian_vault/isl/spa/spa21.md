 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Either</span> the ḥinnā <a name="fr_387"></a><a href="#fn_387"><font size="1">*</font></a> hath been unto thy white hands applied,<br> Or they have been made red in the blood of thy lover.</p>  
 <p>I am unable, O dear one! to endure thy glance's fire;<br> For I am weak, and infirm, and powerless, altogether.</p>  
 <p>Those languid eyes of thine have many in misery plunged:<br> It would be well, my beloved! shouldst thou their tyranny restrain.</p>  
 <p>Thy stricken ones, without union with thee, revive not again,<br> Though Abū-Sinā <a name="fr_388"></a><a href="#fn_388"><font size="1">†</font></a> himself to prescribe for them should come.</p>  
 <p>Those sable locks of thine are like unto spring's lowering clouds;<br> And from them shineth out thy countenance, like the sun.</p>  
 <p>Thy fascinated ones are entangled in the noose of thy ringlets;<br> But the wise bird upon the net can no confidence place.</p>  
 <p>The equal to thy beauty is not in the wide world to be found;<br> Whilst my poor heart breaketh at the affluence thou enjoyest.</p>  
 <p>Thou art celebrated throughout the world for thy benevolence too;<br> Wherefore, then, givest thou not ear unto <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah's</span> complainings?</p>  
 <p>
 </p>

 <p><a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="green">p. 329</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">II.</h4>  
 <p>Separation from thee, O my friend! hath made me so disconsolate,<br> That naught in me remaineth, but misery and woe!</p>  
 <p>The ensanguined tears chase each other down my cheeks<br> My heart is rent to atoms, and my breast is all consumed.</p>  
 <p>The clear colour of my face dependeth upon thy existence;<br> And now, without thee, it is colourless, and tinged with blood.</p>  
 <p>I was unacquainted with the world's profits and losses—benefits and ills:<br> By the sight of thyself, without wine thou didst inebriate me.</p>  
 <p>Though I yearn and long for it, I cannot procure it in the world:<br> The rapturous sight of thee is become unattainable to me.</p>  
 <p>I become immersed therein: at times I sink; at times I rise again;<br> But out of the vortex of the ocean of thy love I cannot emerge.</p>  
 <p>The whole country unto me hath dark become without thee;<br> O thou, the bright sun among all saints and holy men!</p>  
 <p>Thou art a mighty river, in waves and billows rolling;<br> But no one drinketh one mouthful from the mighty stream.</p>  
 <p>My mind will not become comforted by any other person,<br> Than by thee only; O thou, of all poles now the pole <a name="fr_389"></a><a href="#fn_389"><font size="1">*</font></a> unto me!</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="green">p. 330</font></a></p>  
 <p>I was wont to say, that in life we always together should be;<br> For I was utterly ignorant regarding the dread torrent of death.</p>  
 <p>The extent of thy goodness, my beloved! was beyond computation;<br> For thou didst not, from the veil, thy countenance to any one show.</p>  
 <p>Thou wert the altar of the aspirations and exigencies of all!<br> For at the threshold of the Highest, acceptable were thy prayers.</p>  <h4 align="center">III.</h4>  
 <p>I would relate unto thee the wondrous works of the ravishers of the heart,<br> But I know naught concerning it—they abstract it from my breast.</p>  
 <p>I will bear whatever cruelty the beloved may heap upon me:<br> God forbid that any one recreant unto love should be found!</p>  
 <p>I obtain no relief, even though in her service my life I lay down;<br> For my heart still reproacheth me, that I have not done enough.</p>  
 <p>There is no such cool water, whereby my thirst shall be quenched;<br> And I shall thus wander, with breast on fire, till time shall end.</p>  
 <p>I shed floods of tears, but she showeth no sympathy towards me:<br> Let not any one, O God! a mistress have, so cruel and unkind!</p>  
 <p>This also, both high and low, great and small, will understand—<br> When doth any one, without being ailing, unto the physician go?</p>  
 <p>The afflictions of the sick they increase: there is no cure for them;<br> For there are no skilful physicians remaining: they have all left the land!</p>  
 <p>Happy are the whole and the healthy, that need not medicine;<br> For those, with this malady afflicted, obtain no ease to their pain.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="green">p. 331</font></a></p>  
 <p>"I have meted unto every one his destiny," so the Ḳur’ān saith:<br> Who then shall change the lot <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">He</span> unto <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span> assigned?</p>  <h4 align="center">IV.</h4>  
 <p>Shouldst thou become the possessor of the world's throne and sceptre,<br> Be not arrogant! for in the end thou wilt be plundered and despoiled.</p>  
 <p>All will be equally on a par, one with the other, after death,<br> Whether it be the beggar, the wealthy man, or the prince.</p>  
 <p>Since thy place, at last, is the dark earth beneath,<br> Manifest neither gladness nor predilection for the world's affairs.</p>  
 <p>It will become shattered to atoms by the stones of death,<br> To whatever degree thou mayest the body's glass vessel guard.</p>  
 <p>If thou considerest it thy duty, the necessities of the poor to relieve,<br> The Almighty will never let thee be under necessity unto any one.</p>  
 <p>When a friend presenteth himself, show thy bounty to the utmost;<br> Since there are merely these five days of existence for thee.</p>  
 <p>Adorn thy piety by good actions and praiseworthy deeds;<br> For a bride without adornment and jewels ’tis unusual to see.</p>  
 <p>The whole of this darkness shall be expelled from thine heart,<br> If thou lightest up within it, the lamp of love divine.</p>  
 <p>When are such things brought about by armies or by legions,<br> As are accomplished by the fervid enthusiasm of love?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="green">p. 332</font></a></p>  
 <p>If the lover be small in stature, but be great in heart,<br> Then of what use is Æāj's gigantic stature unto him? <a name="fr_390"></a><a href="#fn_390"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>Love hath brought dishonour, both in this world and the next,<br> Upon one Majnūn; <a name="fr_391"></a><a href="#fn_391"><font size="1">†</font></a> upon another Manṣūr, Ḥillāj's son. <a name="fr_392"></a><a href="#fn_392"><font size="1">‡</font></a></p>  
 <p>What would the sportsman in the forest know concerning it,<br> If the partridge did not acquaint him by so loudly calling?</p>  
 <p>The fame of Kasrā's <a name="fr_393"></a><a href="#fn_393"><font size="1">§</font></a> justice hath unto all time remained,<br> But tyranny's scar remaineth branded Ḥujāj's forehead upon. <a name="fr_394"></a><a href="#fn_394"><font size="1">§§</font></a></p>  
 <p>The unfinished and incomplete woof of the world's warp behold!<br> The weaver by no means soever can it to perfection bring!</p>  
 <p>If thou art a lover, of slander and aspersion have no fear!<br> But become thou the target of every one's arrow of reproach.</p>  
 <p>What are the sins of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span> in the eye of God,<br> When the ocean of His mercy in waves of beneficence rolleth?</p>  <h4 align="center">V.</h4>  
 <p>How much longer, O base one! for the world's love wilt thou wander?<br> Quaff of the inebriating cup of love divine, that both sugar and honey is!</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_333"><font size="1" color="green">p. 333</font></a></p>  
 <p>O thou, its seeker! about the, world to come, that is eternal, be concerned!<br> Place not thy affections on the transient world, tho’ all its dust were gold!</p>  
 <p>But the counsel of monitors taketh no effect whatever upon thee;<br> For like unto a breast-work round thine heart, is the love of the world!</p>  
 <p>Happy the inspired, who are filled with the remembrance of the beloved!<br> The general world are unacquainted with the raptures and bliss thereof!</p>  
 <p>The Perfect One's praise is the embellisher of the mouth, if thou art wise:<br> Come, polish the mirror of thine heart from the tarnishing dust thereon!</p>  
 <p>O, what rapture have those lovers that drink of the wine of love!<br> With the beloved, solely occupied, they are free from all griefs and woes!</p>  
 <p>Cast away, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span>! both life and goods for it;<br> But for a tittle of the perfect saint's pain and affliction pray!</p>  <h4 align="center">VI.</h4>  
 <p>Entertain not, O brother! great friendship towards the world:<br> Dost thou not, the raids of separation, on all sides perceive?</p>  
 <p>’Tis to depart and pass away: the world is not thy tarrying place:<br> Whether king or beggar, all will certainly to the grave go down!</p>  
 <p>Whether the prelate, or the priest, or the accomplished in learning,<br> Not one, by any contrivance, shall from death's debt escape!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="green">p. 334</font></a></p>  
 <p>They who are by sanctity inspired, pursue not mundane love;<br> With that of the Beloved One, there is no love to be compared!</p>  
 <p>Since thou showest such yearning after the world's greatness,<br> What is it after all? reflect well, and of thy dear friends think!</p>  
 <p>I was calmly reposing in my abode, along with my beloved,<br> When the horsemen of separation carried me hand-bound away!</p>  
 <p>All my loved ones, from time to time, have been taken from me:<br> The tablets of my heart have been blotted all over by grief!</p>  
 <p>I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span>, in bereavement's flame, consume;<br> Hence sighs and lamentations, irrepressibly, issue from my mouth!</p>  <h4 align="center">VII.</h4>  
 <p>Since He created thee for well-doing and virtuous actions,<br> It behoveth not, O man! that thou shouldst evil commit.</p>  
 <p>Unto the Creator, day and night, render due meed of praise:<br> Let it not be that thou for a moment fail in doing so!</p>  
 <p>Upon the throne of contentment sit, and a sovereign become;<br> And under what obligation wilt thou then, to lord or chieftain be?</p>  
 <p>The world's duration is but short: it will soon pass away!<br> If thou art anxious as to thy award hereafter, now is thy time!</p>  
 <p>Be prudent, and do not the world's transient pleasures pursue!<br> Let it not be that the prosperous be ruined by the adverse. <a name="fr_395"></a><a href="#fn_395"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>The torrent of death hath carried whole peoples away;<br> Then what stay canst thou make upon the face of the flood?</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_335"><font size="1" color="green">p. 335</font></a></p>  
 <p>Thou wilt be awakened, at last, by the herald's summons,<br> Notwithstanding thou mayest upon the softest couch repose!</p>  
 <p>In no way shalt thou be able the toils of death to escape,<br> Even shouldst thou with seventy thousand screens thyself surround!</p>  
 <p>Since sweet existence is ever melting like unto snow away,<br> How much longer, with harp and rebeck, wilt thou revel and rejoice?</p>  
 <p>Sometimes the green corn is cut down; sometimes the ripe:<br> What dependence canst thou place, then, upon youthfulness or age?</p>  
 <p>Fear, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span>! fear, fear for thyself!<br> There, what answer wilt thou make, if the Almighty question thee?</p>  
 <p>The hopes of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span> are upon <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thy</span> mercy placed:<br> If <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thou</span> rebukest him he hath not the power to reply!</p>  <h4 align="center">VIII.</h4>  
 <p>If thou takest into consideration the many favours of the Almighty,<br> When wilt thou be able, for even one of them, fitting thanks to return?</p>  
 <p>One of the favours <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">He</span> hath bestowed upon thee is Islām's true faith:<br> The other, that <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">He</span> hath placed thee the great Ḥumā's shadow <a name="fr_396"></a><a href="#fn_396"><font size="1">*</font></a> beneath.</p>  
 <p>Let it not happen, that in the end, thou shouldst lament about that,<br> For which, like the nightingale, thou constantly sacrificest thyself.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_336"><font size="1" color="green">p. 336</font></a></p>  
 <p>The world shall embrace thy feet and thy hands with affection,<br> If thou make thyself the dust of the feet of holy men.</p>  
 <p>Thou shalt, at that time, attain unto the object of thy wishes,<br> When thou shalt make thy life and goods an oblation unto them.</p>  
 <p>It behoveth thee to consider each respiration as the last;<br> For death many people hath homeless and desolate made.</p>  
 <p>Mankind come into the world, and soon from it depart:<br> How canst thou then place any hope upon this transient abode?</p>  
 <p>But I will eschew even the sovereignty of the world itself,<br> If <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thou</span> make <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span> a beggar, at his loved one's door.</p>  <h4 align="center">IX.</h4>  
 <p>If thou possessest the love and regard of the Almighty,<br> Thou wilt tear thyself away both from brother and from friend.</p>  
 <p>Like unto Majnūn, thou wilt begin in wilds to wander:<br> Thou wilt never take account of the thorns and brambles by the way.</p>  
 <p>Until thou castest not off entirely all thy superfluous flesh,<br> O contender in the race! thou wilt never reach the goal.</p>  
 <p>Day and night thou pursuest this transient world,<br> And hast, O foolish one! turned from the immortal away.</p>  
 <p>At last, He will take away from thee, by force, for ever,<br> This borrowed garment, <a name="fr_397"></a><a href="#fn_397"><font size="1">*</font></a> that is so very precious unto thee.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_337"><font size="1" color="green">p. 337</font></a></p>  
 <p>The beasts of the field, when grazing, eat not up every herb,<br> But thou turnest not away thy face from any one thing.</p>  
 <p>Until it shall be melted the saint-like teacher's crucible within,<br> Thou wilt not be able to separate this silver from its tin alloy.</p>  
 <p>Notwithstanding, before him, thou mayest the beloved praise;<br> Still, thou canst not manhood from the impotent hope.</p>  
 <p>I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span>, am immersed in the ocean of grief,<br> If thou, my master! wilt save me from this raging flood.</p>  <h4 align="center">X.</h4>  
 <p>Give ear, O brother! unto the request I make unto thee:—<br> Be not, by the contemptible deception of the world, led astray!</p>  
 <p>By its deceit, it maketh people despiteful unto each other:<br> It passeth around a golden cup with deadliest poison filled.</p>  
 <p>The millstones of fate, round the heads of mankind revolve;<br> And some time or other, the turn for thy head shall come.</p>  
 <p>By the severe bridle of fasting, curb the lusts of the flesh;<br> For with a halter thou wilt be unable, this steed to restrain.</p>  
 <p>The object of food is to keep body and soul together, and no more,<br> Although thou mayest have in thy possession all sorts of things.</p>  
 <p>To clothe the body is necessary, and it behoveth us so to do,<br> Though but two or three yards of blanket or of canvas it be.</p>  
 <p>Thy every breath is a pearl and coral of inestimable price:<br> Be careful, therefore, and guard every respiration well!</p>  
 <p>Let the whole of thy words be conformable with thy deeds;<br> And in no wise in vain and foolish conversation indulge!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="green">p. 338</font></a></p>  
 <p>Tell me what extent of torment thou wilt be able to bear;<br> And commit no more sin than may be equivalent thereunto.</p>  
 <p>By the rain of spring will become all saturated at last,<br> The paper dress in which thou mayest have clothed thyself.</p>  
 <p>Unto the money-changer, its exterior and interior will be known;<br> Notwithstanding thou shouldst, with gold, brass ever so enwrap.</p>  
 <p>The bead of this arrow will not come out from thy bones,<br> Until thy flesh shall have been by the sharp diamond incised. <a name="fr_398"></a><a href="#fn_398"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>It was because he made use of words of arrogance and pride,<br> That Satan himself was wholly from God's mercy debarred.</p>  
 <p>Without doubt, all good and all misfortune are from the Almighty:<br> Wherefore then unto doubt, givest thou a place in thine heart?</p>  
 <p>In thy ways indeed, thou art still more silly than children,<br> Even now that thy years are beyond forty and fifty passed.</p>  
 <p>Shouldst thou drink one mouthful from the cup of love,<br> Like unto <u>Kh</u>izr <a name="fr_399"></a><a href="#fn_399"><font size="1">†</font></a> and Mihtar Iliyās, <a name="fr_400"></a><a href="#fn_400"><font size="1">‡</font></a> thou wilt never die!</p>  
 <p>I am filled with terror and dismay, beyond all bounds;<br> For the Tempter waylayeth me before and on every side!</p>  
 <p>I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span>, am prostrate at thy threshold,<br> If thou, O my master! wilt but take me by the hand!</p>  <h4 align="center">XI.</h4>  
 <p>The love of the world hath made thee so insensate,<br> That thou hast wholly forgotten the duties of religion.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_339"><font size="1" color="green">p. 339</font></a></p>  
 <p>Like unto the cat, thou art ever upon the watch:<br> Thou art of no use soever to any one, save the rat.</p>  
 <p>Outwardly, thou hast clothed thyself in sanctity's dress,<br> O deceiver! thou vender of barley, but shower of wheat!</p>  
 <p>When the opportunity hath passed away, then wilt thou grieve;<br> And when the cup of death shall be given thee to quaff.</p>  
 <p>Thou hearest with thine ears the cries of the outcast;<br> And the cries at thy decease too, shall reach others’ ears.</p>  
 <p>Mankind <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">He</span> hath created to walk in righteousness’ ways:<br> Thou art not a beast; then not sinfully, but worthily act!</p>  
 <p>When thou leavest the body's house, take viaticum with thee;<br> For there, O beloved! are no means for obtaining it.</p>  
 <p>Thou art a pilgrim, and wilt depart: anxious therefore be:<br> Bind up thine effects, and reflect upon the long journey before!</p>  
 <p>The path in front the Tempter haunteth: go not alone!<br> Arise! search about thee! and thy companions select!</p>  
 <p>If one, even with every effort, cannot the goal attain;<br> No man can reach it without striving so to do.</p>  
 <p>Every morning and evening raise thy voice unto God!<br> Tears of blood shed in the depth of thy heart's emotion!</p>  
 <p>All other love, save one, is naught but deadly poison:<br> From the cupbearer's goblet, then, joyfully take one draught!</p>  
 <p>Groan and lament, but so that no one may hear thee!<br> Remember thy beloved in thine heart, but with silent lips!</p>  
 <p>The world is black, and maketh man's face so too at last;<br> But drink thou the wine of love, and red-faced become! <a name="fr_401"></a><a href="#fn_401"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_340"><font size="1" color="green">p. 340</font></a></p>  
 <p>Without anxiety, O <u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad! sleep not;<br> Since thou hast been by death's repeated warnings apprised!</p>  
 <p>I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span>, am of sins and offences full;<br> But, O hider of faults! I place my trust in Thee!</p>  <h4 align="center">XII.</h4>  
 <p>From all ills, shield Thou me, O God, my Protector!<br> For save Thee, there is none other, my Protector!</p>  
 <p>Unto Thee I have intrusted the affairs of both worlds:<br> Of all things, both of faith and country, Thou art the Protector!</p>  
 <p>The flesh and the devil, alas! waylay me everywhere:<br> I have no means of escape, save through Thee, O Protector!</p>  
 <p>Of the world's calamities and woes, I shall have no dread;<br> Since, everywhere, Thou art my shield from ill, O Protector!</p>  
 <p>When I draw near unto Thee, go Thou before, O my guide!<br> For on this road I have no other friend but Thee, O Protector!</p>  
 <p>Every morn I cry unto Thee: with Thee I for union yearn;<br> Then, one morn, accept the prayer of my heart, O Protector!</p>  
 <p>Upon sinful <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span> Thy love bestow,<br> That he may ever praise and call upon thy name, O Protector!</p>  <h4 align="center">XIII.</h4>  
 <p>Wherefore dost thou not follow righteousness, O my stony heart!<br> When thy beloved friends, one after the other, continually disappear?</p>  
 <p>O Thou! who hast bound so many loads upon thy back, and set out—<br> How wilt thou pass along the path in front, so narrow and confined?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_341"><font size="1" color="green">p. 341</font></a></p>  
 <p>Burn thyself and become ashes, if thou truly lovest the beloved:<br> Draw near, O suitor! learn thou from the moth true love!</p>  
 <p>Give up this world! leave it to the negligent and the remiss!<br> From heedlessness’ dark film, make thou the mirror bright!</p>  
 <p>The garment's hem of my patron saint, I have, with both hands seized:<br> In the conflict with the flesh and the devil I shall conquer perhaps.</p>  
 <p>As the breath of the charmer to the afflicted, such is a sight of thee:<br> I will become thy sacrifice, thou anchorite at the loved-one's door!</p>  
 <p>Let both my life and goods be an oblation, O mediator! unto thee;<br> But the face of the beloved, so beautiful, show thou unto me!</p>  
 <p>Rivers have overflowed, and distant lands have become flooded;<br> But, alas! of thirst I die, at the brink of a mighty stream!</p>  
 <p>Give not away, wholly, to sorrow, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span>!<br> For the Perfect One will confer honour upon the servants at His gate!</p>  <h4 align="center">XIV.</h4>  
 <p>Unto the whole and healthy, I am unable of my heart's state to speak;<br> And should I not tell it, I am unable its pain to endure.</p>  
 <p>To this degree I am become a reproach all people amongst,<br> That I am altogether unable out of my own house of sorrow to go.</p>  
 <p>From grief, on account of slander, I am fallen, with eyes closed;<br> For through shame, I am unable to look any one in the face.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="green">p. 342</font></a></p>  
 <p>My throat hath become so embittered by the cup of separation,<br> That I cannot taste aught of the sweetness of this world.</p>  
 <p>I cannot make my beloved acquainted with my condition;<br> For through fear of the kill-joy, I am unable my case to state.</p>  
 <p>I would leave the beloved, and depart to a far distant land;<br> But I am unable in any way the bonds of affection to break.</p>  
 <p>The tears of separation flow so continually down my cheeks,<br> That I cannot upon my eyeballs retain the image of my beloved.</p>  
 <p>Like the tulip, <a name="fr_402"></a><a href="#fn_402"><font size="1">*</font></a> the blood of my own vitals I am ever consuming;<br> For I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span>, am unable, openly, to speak.</p>  
 <p>But I am altogether a recreant and a speaker of falsehood;<br> Since, to the love of the beloved, I cannot my life devote.</p>  <h4 align="center">XV.</h4>  
 <p>I am a complainant against absence: a complainant am I!<br> For it separated me, weeping and wailing, my loved-one from!</p>  
 <p>My love is the immortal soul, and I the form containing it;<br> And from its soul, the separation of the body is bitter indeed!</p>  
 <p>My very vitals have become entirely consumed in the flames:<br> Alas! alas! O separation! what dost thou require of me?</p>  
 <p>I am not criminal, that I grieve and complain so much:<br> ’Tis that my heart is broken, and my breast with fire consumed!</p>  
 <p>If prosperity attend me in all other things, what shall I do with them?<br> For without thee, the whole world hath become desolate to me!</p>  
 <p>

 <p>The anguish of my heart, on thy account, every moment increaseth<br> Henceforth of remedy or cure I shall quite hopeless become!</p>  
 <p>The physicians neglected to make her acquainted with my case;<br> And, at the Last Day, I will seize them by the collars therefore!</p>  
 <p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span>! make thou resignation thy daily task:<br> Entertain no hope that, from this world, thou shalt constancy find!</p>  
 <p>Since according to my desire thou never tamest unto me,<br> Say, say, O relentless fate! in what I have offended thee!</p>  <h4 align="center">XVI.</h4>  
 <p>Show thou no yearnings for the greatness of this world;<br> For many tribes, at death's wail, have desolate become!</p>  
 <p>Those dear friends, who were like spring's flowers unto,<br> In the sultry heats of autumn, grew withered, and decayed.</p>  
 <p>They are all now prostrate fallen, the dank earth upon,<br> Who, with turbans placed so jauntily, rode their fiery steeds.</p>  
 <p>And they who were wont upon the couches of the fair to lie—<br> Of their deaths, many anniversaries have come and passed away.</p>  
 <p>Those youths and fair maidens are now buried in the dust,<br> Whose hands were still more soft than even velvet itself.</p>  
 <p>The excellent of their time have passed from the world away,<br> Around whom their disciples gathered their discourses to hear.</p>  
 <p>Upon what wound of mine will the physicians salve apply?<br> For, with the diamonds <a name="fr_403"></a><a href="#fn_403"><font size="1">*</font></a> of separation I am all covered with wounds.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_344"><font size="1" color="green">p. 344</font></a></p>  
 <p>When I call to mind the pleasant meetings of friends so dear,<br> I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span> weep, but not for any crime.</p>  <h4 align="center">XVII.</h4>  
 <p>The whole of my grief is love for thee, love, love for thee!<br> My heart is to atoms broken: it hath become blood, all blood!</p>  
 <p>My very vitals are become gorged with red, red blood,<br> Though clothed in garments outwardly white, all white!</p>  
 <p>Thou inflictest fresh wounds upon me, again and again,<br> Altho’ of my former ones unhealed are many, very many!</p>  
 <p>Thou hast not shown aught of kindness in life towards me:<br> Of what use shouldst thou do so, when I die, when I die!</p>  
 <p>Thou hast expelled me entirely from the garden, my love!<br> And the black crows, within it consume the ripe, ripe fruit!</p>  
 <p>Thy dark tresses have the whole land with fragrance filled:<br> Thy curls are as the musk-pods of Chin, all perfume, all perfume!</p>  
 <p>Those sleepy eyes of thine are lions, both fierce and ravenous;<br> For they bear away <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span> unto death, cruel death!</p>  <h4 align="center">XVIII.</h4>  
 <p>Since thou art the sovereign over the whole of the fair,<br> Inquire after the condition of the wretched and distressed!</p>  
 <p>Break not hearts! for they are rubies of Bada<u>kh</u><u>sh</u>ān<br> It is difficult to repair such broken things again!</p>  
 <p>My heart and soul are entirely bound up in love for thee;<br> Look then, these thine own heart-bound ones upon!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_345"><font size="1" color="green">p. 345</font></a></p>  
 <p>The flowers of the parterre have all revived thereby;<br> For the zephyr hath come from the nosegay of thy face.</p>  
 <p>When they beheld, with their eyes, thy stature and figure,<br> The waists of all the adorned ones crooked became.</p>  
 <p>They have deprived me altogether of sense and understanding—<br> Those gentle, tender words of thine, so pleasant and so sweet.</p>  
 <p>My head than the seventh heaven shall be higher exalted,<br> If thou makest me one of the sitters in thy court.</p>  
 <p>Like unto thee, there is none other of disposition so noble;<br> Didst thou, indeed, from the angels this nature acquire?</p>  
 <p>The heart of <u>Kh</u>wājah that thus speaketh, hath been carried away<br> By the wiles and persuasion of those closed-mouthed ones.</p>  
 <p>Life and goods, as an oblation to them, will I give;<br> For I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span>, am the disciple of the fair!</p>  <h4 align="center">XIX.</h4>  
 <p>They, who were enamoured of the red roses of the parterre,<br> Have now the nightingales of grief and sorrow become.</p>  
 <p>With cries and lamentations thou grievest for them;<br> Since the roses have all been scattered by autumn's dread blast.</p>  
 <p>They, who were then intoxicated with the flowers’ perfume,<br> Have now become requited by separation's dread pangs.</p>  
 <p>Their pastimes and their laughter were apart from the world:<br> The world's pleasures and joys became deadly poison to them.</p>  
 <p>As yet, they had not tasted of union's sweet fruit,<br> When loving friends became severed in sorrow and grief.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_346"><font size="1" color="green">p. 346</font></a></p>  
 <p>For a few short days, the bliss of conjunction they enjoyed;<br> But now years of separation have their portion become.</p>  
 <p>Should they now flee from destiny, they cannot escape;<br> Since grief is the portion of lovers from the beginning of time.</p>  
 <p>The physicians of the age, if they are cognizant of much,<br> How are they thus so ignorant of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad's</span> pangs?</p>  
 <p>With sighs and with groans, I will lament unceasingly;<br> For I ever long that the hour of my union were come!</p>  <h4 align="center">XX.</h4>  
 <p>Many youths and maidens have the dark dust's captives become,<br> The fair faces of whom are the source of the grief of our hearts!</p>  
 <p>Place not your hopes upon this transient world, for ’tis no permanent abode!<br> The whole of us, each in his own good time, shall follow after them!</p>  
 <p>They who were the great men of the land, and possessed the wealth thereof;<br> From the world have wholly disappeared, both name and trace of them.</p>  
 <p>They, before whom the poor were wont in humility to stand,<br> In the tomb, on their backs fallen, have now mouldered away.</p>  
 <p>For munificence and for justice their names still remain,<br> Though Hāt̤im Tā-yī <a name="fr_404"></a><a href="#fn_404"><font size="1">*</font></a>, and No<u>sh</u>erwān <a name="fr_405"></a><a href="#fn_405"><font size="1">†</font></a> have long from the world departed.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_347"><font size="1" color="green">p. 347</font></a></p>  
 <p>Neither by power, nor by entreaty is there any escape from death:<br> Happy the sanctified, who are occupied with eternal things!</p>  
 <p>My heart hath become rent to atoms by the diamond <a name="fr_406"></a><a href="#fn_406"><font size="1">*</font></a> of separation;<br> For, one after the other, all my dear friends have been severed from me.</p>  
 <p>All must hence depart: for what can <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad</span> hope,<br> When holy and venerated prophets have unto the dust gone down?</p>  <h4 align="center">XXI.</h4>  
 <p>Fruitlessly in the world thy lifetime thou hast passed,<br> Whether it extended unto sixty, or unto eighty years!</p>  
 <p>The fortunate have carried away advantage from it;<br> But thou, save evil, hast no other result acquired!</p>  
 <p>The friends of thy acquaintance have all gone from thee;<br> And still thou perceivest it not, O man, with open eyes asleep!</p>  
 <p>When grief and sorrow man afflict, he sleepeth not:<br> Art thou a beast, or a man of human parents born?</p>  
 <p>Thy fathers and grandfathers all hath death cut off;<br> And thou, above all others, wilt not alone escape!</p>  
 <p>Alive in the world not one will remain behind:<br> No one can have taken on himself thy obligations to fulfil!</p>  
 <p>Thy beard from age is white, and thy back is bent:<br> How much longer then canst thou expect erect to remain?</p>  
 <p>Thy sixty years have passed, and thou art old become;<br> Yet thou accountest thyself of the age of fourteen still!</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_348"><font size="1" color="green">p. 348</font></a></p>  
 <p>If thou art wise, turn devotee, and the world forsake;<br> For they who this life choose, are in both worlds free!</p>  
 <p>The veil of scepticism from thy face draw aside;<br> And unto the Master's will let thy assent be given!</p>  
 <p>Become thou the servant at the wine-sellers’ door,<br> That wine from the cup of love be given unto thee!</p>  
 <p>Thou One and Only God! unto righteousness direct me,<br> That, the straight path upon, I may come unto Thee!</p>  
 <p>If I have evil committed, a rude slave consider me;<br> And pardon me, according to Thine own peculiar way!</p>  
 <p>When man giveth aught to another, again he taketh it;<br> But Thou art God, and takest not back thy gifts again!</p>  
 <p>O Thou all-possessing Deity! the sinner <u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad free!<br> For the rich always grant liberty their aged slaves unto!</p>  
 <p>Thou art the hider of thy servant's sins, O Lord!<br> In mercy, of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad's</span> rend not Thou the veil!</p>
