 <p>To this degree is the heart affected by the love of Laylā,<br> That Majnūn, for aye, uttereth the praises of Laylā. <a name="fr_343"></a><a href="#fn_343"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>He repeated no other lesson whatever, in this world,<br> Save that, on the black mole, and the ringlets of Laylā.</p>  
 <p>This, unto him, is sleep, from pain and anguish free,<br> That he be occupied, day and night, with thoughts of Laylā.</p>  
 <p>If, by the sword of anguish, he to death's agonies be brought,<br> He grieveth not, so that it be in the presence of Laylā.</p>  
 <p>Lovers, that cry out, "Laylā! Laylā!" and mourn and bewail—<br> Kill the body, and make it immortal, by the name of Laylā.</p>  
 <p>He desireth grief out of excessive woe, but findeth it not:<br> The lover is ever happy, in grief and sorrow for Laylā.</p>  
 <p>The whole of his love-pangs will, in a moment, disappear,<br> When the long sought interview is brought about with Laylā.</p>  
 <p>Draw near, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aḥmad <u>Sh</u>āh</span>! learn thou love from Majnūn!<br> For he is famous, in the world, for his love of Laylā.</p>

 <p><a name="page_295"><font size="1" color="green">p. 295</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">II.</h4>  
 <p>Lay thine hand very gently upon me, O physician!<br> Behold my condition, and take pity upon me, my beloved!</p>  
 <p>My heart, for this reason, is wholly filled with anguish,<br> That, thro’ evil destiny, it beholdeth not its dear one near.</p>  
 <p>She is perfect and exquisite, in the excess of her beauty;<br> Hence my heart, distracted and disordered, raveth for her.</p>  
 <p>Tho’ the dear one, by her mouth, many favours conferreth;<br> Still, every one receiveth the portion, by destiny decreed.</p>  
 <p>Notwithstanding, when I make many supplications unto her,<br> She saith unto me, "Grieve not, poor soul! I am thine!"</p>  
 <p>But next day, when I approach her, then, O my friend!<br> She saith, "Who is it I wherefore hath the rude fellow come?"</p>  
 <p>Tho’ I would tear her from my heart, yet it will not be;<br> For she is, by nature, exceedingly generous, and noble withal.</p>  
 <p>The long sable locks hang her fair white face about—<br> She is gay and cheerful in disposition, and elegant in form.</p>  
 <p>Since God hath given unto the heart-ravisher the rose's beauty,<br> Wherefore should not the nightingale lover weep and bewail?</p>  
 <p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aḥmad <u>Sh</u>āh</span>! the parrot-like soul weepeth and is sad:<br> It hath come again, O destiny! from the country of its love.</p>  <h4 align="center">III.</h4>  
 <p>May God annihilate thee, thou fly of human nature!<br> For no one mouth will have been left unpolluted by thy kiss!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_296"><font size="1" color="green">p. 296</font></a></p>  
 <p>Every wound, that may be thy place of alighting upon,<br> Will for ever be afflicted with the irritation of thine eggs.</p>  
 <p>Thou deafenest the ears of the whole world, with thy din;<br> Still thy mouth becometh not mute of its unpleasant buzz.</p>  
 <p>The whole world, through thee, hath into mere carrion turned;<br> Yet sorrowfully, and in spite, wringest thou still thine hands. <a name="fr_344"></a><a href="#fn_344"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>O thoughtless man! follow not the nature of the fly!<br> These seeing eyes of thine from their ophthalmia cure!</p>  
 <p>Thou art the servant; then do thou the Almighty seek!<br> Existence, without God, consider utterly valueless and vain!</p>  
 <p>Take unto thee implicit faith; and scepticism's dark house,<br> Thereby shalt thou whiten with the whiteness of its lime.</p>  
 <p>Lowliness and humility are the height of perfection for thee:<br> The fiery nature of carnality, from pepper, take thou not!</p>  
 <p>Thine own original element thou wilt again obtain,<br> When the neck of thy pride thou shalt from the yoke set free.</p>  
 <p>Seize thou, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aḥmad <u>Sh</u>āh</span>! the good sword of courage;<br> And the Hindū temptations of the devil expel from thy breast!</p>  <h4 align="center">IV.</h4>  
 <p>Alas! alas! for the dreadful, rolling rock of bereavement;<br> That for aye committeth such ravages loving hearts upon!</p>  
 <p>It scattereth and separateth kind friends in all directions:<br> O my God! let the night of separation be always brief!</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="green">p. 297</font></a></p>  
 <p>Since it thus, so ruthlessly, its arrows dischargeth,<br> The abode of the lover only an empty cavern remaineth.</p>  
 <p>For his poor heart there will be no relief save weeping;<br> He, like a widow sigheth, with raiment wet with tears.</p>  
 <p>His grief for the beloved rendeth the garment of reserve:<br> The torrent of his tears furroweth the channels of his eyes.</p>  
 <p>Wherefore should not the afflicted heart weep flesh and blood,<br> When the tears of bereavement form a lake therein?</p>  
 <p>Since separation giveth not to the lover so much respite,<br> The blood of his heart gusheth forth in streams from his eyes.</p>  
 <p>He will have no hope of finding relief in any direction:<br> His very frame becometh a load of anguish to bear.</p>  
 <p>If woe shall afflict, and press upon thee, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aḥmad <u>Sh</u>āh</span>!<br> In all sincerity and love, flee thou thy God unto?</p>  <h4 align="center">V.</h4>  
 <p>Would that the crows were not assembled in the nightingale's bower!<br> That loving friends were ever assembled in the parterre of flowers!</p>  
 <p>When the rose, without the presence of the beloved, may be looked upon,<br> The eyesight will merely encounter a bed of thorns and brambles.</p>  
 <p>The garden bloometh in beauty from the face of the beloved;<br> Then, without her, let not the heart unto the parterre incline!</p>  
 <p>Those clouds which may not contain the water of beneficence,<br> Forbid that such clouds should the face of the sky overcast!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="green">p. 298</font></a></p>  
 <p>When the snaky curls fall all dishevelled round her face,<br> Save mine own head, I see none other suitable penance to pay.</p>  
 <p>Since the dark mole upon her cheek is destroyed thereby,<br> Forbid that the rain of tears should ever her face suffuse!</p>  
 <p>The countenance of the beloved one is like unto the rose:<br> Let not autumn affect it: be it ever fresh in the parterre!</p>  
 <p>The blast of autumn, that scattereth the leaves of the rose—<br> Would to heaven that blast into the flames could be cast!</p>  
 <p>The anguish of separation consumeth <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aḥmad <u>Sh</u>āh's</span> heart:<br> O then once more unite him, the company of his friends unto!</p>  <h4 align="center">VI.</h4>  
 <p>O heart-ravisher! there will be none other in the world like unto thee:<br> Draw aside thy veil, or thy lover will of sorrow and grief expire!</p>  
 <p>With breast consumed by passion, I ever follow in search of thee;<br> But thy abode is neither on earth, nor in the heavens to be found.</p>  
 <p>I will wander throughout the world, as a Santon or a Darwe<u>sh</u>;<br> Or I will saturate my garments with the flood of my tears.</p>  
 <p>O fragrant zephyr of the morn! news of her bring thou to me!<br> Make thou my heart to smile the parterre of flowers within!</p>  
 <p>When thus I weep and bewail, my object, in so doing, is this,<br> That my heart may a nightingale be in the rose-bower of thy face.</p>  
 <p>The heart, at the depredations of thy beauty, lamenteth,<br> Like as the nightingale's heart bewaileth when autumn arriveth.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="green">p. 299</font></a></p>  
 <p>In this world, the heart will not from spoliation be exempt;<br> Thou consumest hearts—a wondrous fire in thy nose jewel is.</p>  
 <p>The world's censures and reproaches he taketh not to heart:<br> The lover standeth in the plain, and raiseth his voice on high.</p>  
 <p>With all her tyranny and injustice, I would not abandon love,<br> Were I, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aḥmad <u>Sh</u>āh</span>, with the powers of endurance prepared.</p>  <h4 align="center">VII.</h4>  
 <p>Alas! alas! for sweet life, that passeth thus away!<br> That, like unto a stream, floweth past, and is gone!</p>  
 <p>Wherefore, then, is the heart not aware of its departure,<br> When life, alas! passeth thus so swiftly away?</p>  
 <p>Why, O my heart! hast thou thus from grief become?<br> When existence, like the breeze, bloweth for ever away!</p>  
 <p>Tho’ thou may’st erect mansions, in all symmetry and grace,<br> Filled with regret, alas! thou must leave them all behind! <a name="fr_345"></a><a href="#fn_345"><font size="1">*</font></a></p>  
 <p>Sorrow! sorrow! and for ever sorrow, O my heart!<br> That loving friends from each other are severed so soon!</p>  
 <p>Those dear ones are like unto spring's fragile flowers,<br> That in autumn's heats, alas! wither and fade away!</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_300"><font size="1" color="green">p. 300</font></a></p>  
 <p>This separation is as hell, and absence its heated stones, <a name="fr_346"></a><a href="#fn_346"><font size="1">*</font></a><br> That fall, alas! the poor devoted lover's head upon.</p>  
 <p>It behoveth us here the world to renounce, for ’tis inconstant:<br> Alas! it possesseth neither good nor advantage to carry away.</p>  
 <p>Had meeting ne’er taken place, separation we had not known:<br> Alas! ’tis from meeting that the very heart's blood floweth.</p>  
 <p>If friendship be thy aim, with bereavement make friends;<br> For, alas! it cometh upon thee from thine own hands’ deeds.</p>  
 <p>Friendship is like the rose; but its produce is the thorn:<br> The thorn becometh sharp, and, alas! to the quick it pierceth.</p>  
 <p>Why grievest thou, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aḥmad <u>Sh</u>āh</span>! for ’tis a period of joy?<br> The drum of meeting soundeth: alas! union's hour is near.</p>  <h4 align="center">VIII.</h4>  
 <p>O would that there were not, in the world, the pangs of absence!<br> That the heart in this ocean of separation were not o’erwhelm'd!</p>  
 <p>Let not the heart of the beloved be of love and constancy divested,<br> Though the pains of bereavement may have the lover despoiled!</p>  
 <p>Wherefore may not the heart of the lover be lacerated,<br> When every moment it is stricken by separation's sharp sword?</p>  
 <p>Afflictions, like unto black snakes, twist and twine thereon,<br> When the flood of bereavement goeth straight unto his heart.</p>  
 <p>Whole bands from this world depart, one following the other;<br> For the ocean of separation hath laid the whole universe waste.</p>  
 <p>From this heat the very mountains will, like water, melt,<br> Should the fiery glow of bereavement unto them attain.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="green">p. 301</font></a></p>  
 <p>The cypress-like in stature have been laid low, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aḥmad <u>Sh</u>āh</span>!<br> But let not thy body ever bend under absence's load.</p>  <h4 align="center">IX.</h4>  
 <p>Why weepest thou thus to-day again, O my heart?<br> Thou sighest and complainest ever, O my heart!</p>  
 <p>Like as the hart that loseth her fawn is distracted,<br> So thou showest thy alarm and inquietude, O my heart!</p>  
 <p>See also! thou acquirest not patience by exhortation:<br> Wailing and lamenting, thou rendest thy garment, O my heart!</p>  
 <p>Like as the Hindū widow advanceth impatiently to the pyre,<br> So thou turnest thy back to sweet existence, O my heart!</p>  
 <p>I do not comprehend all these complainings of thine:<br> What makest thee so soft and so sensitive, O my heart?</p>  
 <p>From the pangs of grief thou shalt then be again released,<br> When thou sacrificest thine own affections, O my heart!</p>  
 <p>Thou shalt take thy recreation in the court of the beloved,<br> If thou wilt resign thine own will and pleasure, O my heart!</p>  
 <p>The heart-ravishers are pert and capricious, and deceiving withal;<br> Then how long wilt thou sigh and weep for them, O my heart?</p>  
 <p>In the world the roses of spring are manifold in number,<br> If, like the nightingale, thou lamentest for them, O my heart!</p>  
 <p>The murky night will become unto thee the sunny day,<br> When, like the moth, thou sacrificest thyself, O my heart!</p>  
 <p>The rose-bud of desire thou shalt make to bloom thereby,<br> If thou make truth the rain-clouds of thy spring, O my heart!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_302"><font size="1" color="green">p. 302</font></a></p>  
 <p>The long night of autumn shall never be tardy in passing,<br> If thou on this path takest sincerity with thee, O my heart!</p>  
 <p>Thou shalt ever be gladdened with the sight of thy beloved,<br> When the dark mind thou the bright dawn makest, O my heart!</p>  
 <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aḥmad <u>Sh</u>āh</span>, O world! remembereth no other prayer—<br> In beholding the dear one's face, employ me, O my heart!</p>  <h4 align="center">X.</h4>  
 <p>What an hour of bliss it was, when we, in retirement, each other's society enjoyed!<br> The beauty of thy face was a bed of roses, and my heart a nightingale disporting therein.</p>  
 <p>With the wine of union it was intoxicated: of the marplot it was free from dread:<br> Compared with the excessive torments of separation, to it was bliss, the meeting of to-day.</p>  
 <p>That was an hour of joy and felicity, when the Ḥumā <a name="fr_347"></a><a href="#fn_347"><font size="1">*</font></a> of union o’ershadow’d its head:<br> Why then should not the heart its yearnings show, when with sorrow it was constantly filled?</p>  
 <p>On whom the beloved her glance directed, the entire world was delightful unto him:<br> Union with the dear one is God's gift: not that it was brought about by other means.</p>  
 <p>Indeed, with but one look towards the charmer, even Paradise itself was forgotten by me:<br> My beloved was one without simile or resemblance, and her beauty the rose's excelled.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="green">p. 303</font></a></p>  
 <p>There are many cypresses within the grove; but in stature my friend all, all of them surpassed:<br> I enjoyed the contemplation of my dear one; for she than nectar was sweeter, by far, to me.</p>  
 <p>When I would her loveliness behold, how could sun or moon with it compare?<br> For hot, long shall <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aḥmad <u>Sh</u>āh</span> extol her, when all the world was occupied with her praise?</p>  <h4 align="center">XI.</h4>  
 <p>I cry unto Thee, O God! for I am of my sins and wickedness ashamed;<br> But hopeless of Thy mercy, no one hath ever, from Thy threshold departed.</p>  
 <p>Thy goodness and clemency are boundless; and I am of my evil acts ashamed:<br> ’Tis hopeless that any good deeds of mine will avail; but Thy name I'll my refuge make.</p>  
 <p>When I my iniquities review, I say, O that I were but a mere blade of grass!<br> The lusts of the flesh and the Devil are so implanted within me, that, O God! I can nothing do.</p>  
 <p>Tho’ I strive to the utmost, there's no escape for me out of the Devil's evil well:<br> If it be possible the heart from evil to guard, how shall the eyes be protected?</p>  
 <p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aḥmad</span>! seek thou help from the Almighty, but not from pomp and grandeur's aid!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="green">p. 304</font></a></p>  <h4 align="center">XII.</h4>  
 <p>If I shall say anything of the beloved, what then shall I say?<br> Such is in my destiny, then of my fate, what shall I say?</p>  
 <p>Though the charmers are somewhat softened in heart,<br> Of fortune's crooked, wayward course, what shall I say?</p>  
 <p>I do not complain of the sable locks of the beloved;<br> But her eyes are blood-shedders: of the slaughtered, what shall I say?</p>  
 <p>I greatly longed to behold that sweet countenance of hers;<br> But it killeth the heart: of such a face, what shall I say?</p>  
 <p>They, who show no tenderness, are rivals unto themselves:<br> Thy beloved should be thy beloved: of a rival, what shall I say?</p>  
 <p>The morning's breeze, that causeth the rose to smile,<br> Is the zephyr itself; then of the morn, what shall I say?</p>  
 <p>The thorn which may be with the rose, is also the rose:<br> Since it belongeth to the rose, of the thorn, what shall I say?</p>  
 <p>The harsh words of the dear ones, tho’ a load, are still acceptable:<br> Since lovers are under a load of obligations, of the load, what shall I say?</p>  
 <p>If the rose be the heart's bower, it is the lamp of the nightingale's heart:<br> Since it is the lamp of his heart, of the lamp, what shall I say?</p>  
 <p>The despoiled crieth out, and distracteth others’ hearts too:<br> He remembereth the departed loved one: of the despoiled, what shall I say?</p>  
 <p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aḥmad <u>Sh</u>āh</span>! tho’ it be a stake, it is a bed of flowers also:<br> Since the stake of the beloved is a bower, of the stake, what shall I say?</p>
