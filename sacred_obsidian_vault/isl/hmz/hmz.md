 <p align="center"><font size="7">The Prayer of Abu <u>H</u>amzah Al-ÃžomÃ¡lÃ­</font></p>
 <hr>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">This is a humble translation for the prayer 
 (or Dua') as it is called in Arabic. The prayer is called by this name after the 
 man who narrated it from his master, imam Ali the son of Al-<u>H</u>usain (Zainul-`Ã�bidÃ­n), 
 the fourth imam according to the Shiite belief, and the son of the martyr of 
 Karbala, imam Al-<u>H</u>usain. Abu <u>H</u>amzah narrated that his master used 
 to pray with this prayer every night of Ramadhan.</font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The English translation of this prayer is not 
 what people might call "perfect" but the meanings are given in simple, every 
 day, English. </font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">This prayer is usually read on the nights of 
 Ramadhan, the month of fasting for muslims, along with other many daily prayers.<br>
 I hope by this translation, that I make contact with the minds of people in the 
 outer world, of some of the meanings that such texts carry in them. Meanings 
 that are almost rare to be found in our modern life with its steady pressure.</font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Of course reading the main text in its 
 original language would make more sense for those who understand Arabic 
 literature. There are some words that are repeated in English but they are in 
 fact several words in Arabic, in the original text. This is mainly because 
 Arabic has a wide spectrum of meanings for one word, or several words can 
 express the same meaning to some different degrees, and so on. However, the 
 general meaning of the passage or line is to be taken here, and thus, sometimes 
 the repetitive occurrences of words cannot be avoided.</font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">This prayer has some different versions which 
 only has a slight difference from the source used here in some words. Obviously 
 the difference occurred because of the nature of the Arabic script. The source 
 to this version is the book of "MifÃ¡tÃ­<u>h</u> Al-JinÃ¡n" written by Sheik `AbbÃ¡s 
 Al-QummÃ­.</font></p>

 <p align="left" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Following is the pronunciation 
 guide:<br>
 Ã�: long "a" like in "father".<br>
 Ã�: long "i" like double "E" sound in "been".<br>
 U: a short vowel like the double "O" in "book".<br>
 <u>H</u>: Hard fricative sound close to "H".</font></p>

 <p align="center"><u><font face="Arial" size="5">The Prayer</font></u></p>
 <p align="center"><font face="Arial">In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the 
 Merciful<br>
 Lord pray (bless) upon Mohammed, and the Household of Mohammed<br>
  </font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord do not chasten me with Your 
 punishment, and do not try me with Your tricks. From where shall I get the 
 goodness O God and it cannot be found except from You, and from where shall I be 
 safe except by You. Neither the one who did good dispensed with You, nor he who 
 did the mischief and dare to be against you and did not satisfy You had been out 
 of Your ability. O God, O God, O God (until you are out of breath), by You I've 
 known You and You've guided me to You, and called me to You, and if it was not 
 for You I would not have known who are You. Praise be to Allah whom I call and 
 He answers me, even though I would be slow when He calls for me, and praise be 
 to Allah whom I ask and He gives me, even though I would be hoarding up when He 
 asks me, and praise be to Allah whom I call whenever I want for my need and be 
 alone with Him for my secret, and by no mediator He fulfils my need. Praise be 
 to Allah whom I pray to alone and no one else, and if I did no one would grant 
 my necessity, and praise be to Allah whom I have hope in, and if I had hope in 
 someone else he would disappoint me, and praise be to Allah who brought me to 
 His care and dignified me, and never left me to the people who would humiliate 
 me, and praise be to Allah who made Himself beloved to me even though He 
 dispenses with me, and praise be to Allah who forgives me like if I have no sin. 
 Thus, my God is the best I have and the One worthy of my praise.</font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">My Lord I find the ways of requests towards 
 You  open, and the sources of hope with You are abundant, and asking for 
 help from Your favours is allowed, and the gates of praying to You for those who 
 are in need are open, and I know that You are, for those of hope, in the place 
 of answering, and for those who need to be rescued, You are in the place of 
 rescue, and (I know) that running after Your generosity and being satisfied with 
 Your command is a compensation from the prevention of those who hoard up, and 
 far more rich over what those of possessions have in their hands, and that who 
 travels to You is short in distance, and that You do not put a veil away from 
 Your creations, unless their deeds veil them away from You, and I have reached 
 You with my request, and went toward You with my necessity, and made my help 
 call for You, and by praying to You I made my invocation, for neither rights 
 upon You to be listening to me nor for Your forgiveness towards me, but for my 
 trust in Your generosity and taking refuge in Your true promise, and taking 
 refuge in believing in Your Oneness, and my absolute knowledge that You know 
 that I have no other god save but You, and no other god is there but You, alone, 
 with no companions. O my Lord You have said and Your saying is the truth and 
 Your promise is true "ask Allah of His bounty" "Lo! Allah is ever Merciful unto 
 you", and it is not one of Your characters O Master, that You command to be 
 asked and prevent the gift, and You are the Giver of the gifts over the people 
 of Your kingdom, and the Giver of love to them with Your passion.</font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord, You have grown me up in Your 
 favours and charity when I was little, and made my name famous when I have grown 
 up, thus O You who have grown me up in this life by His charity and His mercy 
 and His favours, and pointed to me toward His forgiveness and generosity in the 
 afterlife, my knowledge (of You) O Master is my guide to You, and my love for 
 You is my mediator to You, and I am sure of my guide by Your guide, and I take 
 refuge from my own mediator to Your own mediating.</font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">I pray to You O Master with a tongue that is 
 muted by its sin, O God, I speak to You with a heart that fell down by its 
 crime. I pray to You O God with fear, with desire, with hope and scared. If I 
 see my sins O Master I get shocked, and if I see Your generosity I become 
 greedy, thus if You forgave then truly You the best Merciful, and if You 
 punished then You are not unjust. My excuse O Allah to dare to ask You, although 
 I commit what does not please You, is Your generosity and hospitality, and my 
 help in my adversity with my shamelessness is Your passion and Your mercy, and I 
 have hoped that You do not disappoint me from my wish, thus grant my hope and 
 hear my pray, O You are the Best to pray to and the Best to hope for. Great is, 
 O Master, my hope and bad are my deeds, thus give me from Your forgiveness as 
 much as my hope and do not punish me for the worst of my deeds, for Your 
 generosity is far beyond punishing the sinners, and Your patience is far above 
 paying back for the negligent people, and I, O Master, take refuge by Your 
 grace, and escaping away from You unto You, and applying what You have promised 
 of forgiveness for those who have the good thought about You, and what am I O my 
 God and what is my danger?. Give me by Your grace and give charity over me from 
 Your forgiveness. O my God, veil me with Your veil, and forgive scolding me by 
 Your Face's generosity, for if someone else observed my sin other than You, then 
 I would not have done it, and if I was afraid of the punishment I would have 
 avoided it, not because You are the lowest to observe me and the lowest of those 
 who look at me, but because You are O my God the Best of coverers, and the 
 Wisest of rulers, and the most Generous of the generous ones. The Coverer of 
 imperfections, the Forgiver of sins, the Knower of the unknown. You veil the sin 
 by Your generosity, and delay the punishment by Your forgiveness, thus praise be 
 to You for Your forgiveness after Your knowledge, and for Your forgiveness after 
 Your Ability. And what makes me and dares me to refuse Your command Your 
 forgiveness towards me, and what makes me shameless is Your veil over me, and 
 what makes me hurry to Your taboos, my knowledge about Your great mercy, and 
 Your great forgiveness. O Forgiver, O Most Generous, O Living, O Ever Living, O 
 Forgiver of the sin, O Accepter of the repentance, O One of the great favours, O 
 One of the old charity. Where is Your beautiful veil, where is Your holy 
 forgiveness, where is Your close relief, where is Your rapid help, where is Your 
 wide mercy, where is Your generous giving, where are Your joyful gifts, where 
 are Your wonderful deeds, where is Your great grace, where is Your great favour, 
 where is Your old charity, where is Your generosity O Most Generous, by it 
 (them) and by Mohammed and the Household of Mohammed then rescue me, and by Your 
 mercy relieve me. O charity Giver, O beauty Maker, O favours Giver, O grace 
 Giver. I do not depend for being relieved from Your punishment on our deeds, but 
 on Your grace over us, because You are the One of Faith and the One of 
 forgiveness. You start with charity such favours, and forgive the sin with Your 
 generosity, thus we do not know what to thank, the wonderful things You make? Or 
 the ugly things (of us) that You hide? Or the great things that You have taken 
 care of? Or the many things that You have saved us from? O Beloved to whom loved 
 You, and the Joy to whom took refuge in You and had solitude with You. You are 
 the Giver and we are the sinners, thus O God, forgive the ugly things we have 
 with the beautiful things You have, and what type of ignorance that is not 
 included in Your generosity? Or what time is longer than Your patience? And what 
 is the value of our deeds beside Your favours? And how shall we consider our 
 deeds to be much beside Your generosity? Even how come it is short for the 
 sinners what was provided by Your wide mercy? O One of the wide forgiveness, O 
 One who expands His hands with mercy, and (I swear) by Your Holiness O Master, 
 if You scolded me then I would not leave Your door and I would not stop 
 flattering You, for what I have known about Your generosity and grace, and You 
 are the Donor for whatever You like. You torture anyone You like, with whatever 
 You like, and however You like, and have mercy upon anyone You like, with 
 whatever You like, and however You like, and You are never asked about Your 
 deeds, and never been fought over Your Ownership, and never been accompanied 
 with Your commands, and no opposition in Your Rule, and no one opposes Your 
 planning. The creation and the command is for You, blessed is Allah the God of 
 the worlds. </font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O God, this is the place of him who run unto 
 You and took refuge in Your generosity, and got used to Your charity and Your 
 favours, and You are the Generous that His forgiveness is never short, and His 
 grace is never low, and His mercy is never less, and we have been sure about 
 Your old forgiveness, and the great grace and the abundant mercy, thus would You 
 O God disappoint our thoughts or let down our hopes? No, O Most Generous, for 
 this is not we think of You and this is not our hope in You. O God verily we 
 have in You a long abundant hope, verily we have in You a great hope. We 
 rebelled against You and we hope that You veil us, and we prayed to You and we 
 hope that You answer us, this grant our hopes O our Master, for we knew what 
 should we do with our deeds, but Your knowledge about us, and our knowledge that 
 You will never send us away, all of that made us run to You although we do not 
 deserve Your mercy, but You are the One to have grace upon us, and upon the 
 sinners, from Your abundant grace, thus give us the favours that You are known 
 for, and have generosity upon us for we need it. O Forgiver by Your light we are 
 guided, and by Your grace we are satisfied, and within Your favours we spend the 
 day and night. Our sins are between Your hands, we ask for forgiveness from You 
 about them and we repent to You. You make Yourself beloved to us with Your 
 favours and we rebel against You with sins. Your Goodness is revealed upon us, 
 and our badness is going up to You, and yet still there is an generous angel 
 that arrives to You from us with the bad deeds, but that do not abandon You from 
 surrounding us with Your favours and have grace upon us with Your gifts. Thus, 
 glorified are You how forgiving and great and generous, a Starter and a 
 Resuscitator, glorified are Your Names and glorified is Your Praise and generous 
 are Your doings and deeds. You are my Lord of more favours and greater patience 
 than to measure me with my deeds and my sins, thus the mercy, the mercy, the 
 mercy, O Master, O Master, O Master.</font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O our Lord make us busy with Your mention, 
 and spare us from Your wrath, and save us from Your torture, and give us from 
 Your favours, and have grace upon us, and give us (the chance) for pilgrimage to 
 Your holy House and to visit the grave of Your prophet, may Your prayers and 
 Your mercy and Your Forgiveness and Your blesses be upon him and on his 
 Household, verily You are Close and Answerer, and make us do a deed in Your 
 obedience, and let us die under Your way and on the way of Your prophet, may 
 Allah pray upon him and on his Household.</font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O our Lord, forgive me and my parents and 
 have mercy upon them like they did grow me up when I was young, give them for 
 their charity a charity and for the sins give forgiveness. O our Lord, forgive 
 the believer-men and women, and the living and the dead, and continue in between 
 us and them with goodness. O our Lord, forgive for our living and our dead, and 
 our witness and our absent, our males and females, our young and old, our free 
 and slaves. Lied those who astray away from Allah and got lost so far away and 
 verily they had a great loss. O our Lord pray on Mohammed and the Household of 
 Mohammed, and make my end to goodness, and satisfy me with what made my mind 
 busy in this life and the afterlife, and never make over me someone who never 
 have mercy upon me, and make over me an everlasting veil, and do not take the 
 goodness that You gave me, and give me from Your grace an abundant and good 
 fortune. O our Lord, guard me with Your guard, and save me with Your saving, and 
 cover me with Your shield, and give me (the chance) for pilgrimage to Your holy 
 House, in this year and in every year, and (the chance) to visit the grave of 
 Your prophet and the imams may peace be upon them, and do not make me away from 
 these holy scenes and these honourable places. O our Lord, relent toward me so 
 that I will not sin (against You), and inspire me with the goodness and the 
 ability to do it, and (give me) Your fear at day and night times as long You 
 make me live, O God of the worlds.</font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O Our Lord, verily every time I say that I am 
 ready, and stood up to pray between Your hands and speak with You, You would 
 throw over me a sleepiness whenever I want to pray, and took away from me the 
 ability to speak to You whenever I want to speak with You, what is wrong with 
 me? Every time I say that myself is to good and I am closer to those of 
 repentance, suddenly a trouble shows and trips my feet, and blocked me from 
 serving You. O Master, maybe You have abandoned me from Your door? And away from 
 serving You, You have moved me? Or maybe You have seen me lowering Your rights 
 thus You abandoned me? Or maybe You have seen me away from You thus You left me? 
 Or maybe You have seen me a liar thus You have refused me? Or maybe You have 
 seen me not thankful for Your favours thus You have prohibited me? Or maybe You 
 have seen me away from the gatherings of the wise people thus You have 
 disappointed me?  Or maybe You have seen me an ignorant thus from Your 
 mercy You made me despaired? Or maybe You have seen me getting used to the 
 gatherings of the ignorant people thus You left me with them? Or maybe You did 
 not like to hear my prayer thus You made me away (from You)? Or maybe You have 
 rewarded me in return of my crime and mistake? Or maybe You have rewarded me for 
 my shameless behaviour toward You? Thus, if You have forgiven, O my God, You 
 already have forgiven for the sinners before me, because verily Your patience is 
 far above paying back for the negligent people, and I am taking refuge unto Your 
 grace and escaping from You unto You, and applying what You have promised of 
 forgiveness to those who have the good thought of You. My Lord, You are of the 
 widest grace and the greatest patience to measure me with my deeds, and punish 
 me for my mistakes, and what am I O Master and what is my danger? Give me with 
 Your grace O Master, and give me charity with Your forgiveness, and veil me all 
 over, and forgive scolding me with the grace of Your Face. O Master, I am the 
 little one that You have educated, and I am the ignorant that You have taught, 
 and I am the one who went astray that You have guided, and I am the low down one 
 that You have raised, and I am the scared one that You have made safe, and I am 
 the hungry one that You have satisfied, and I am the thirsty one that You have 
 quenched (his thirst), and I am the naked one that You have covered, and I am 
 the poor one that You have made rich, and I am the weak one that You have made 
 strong, and I am the humiliated one that You have glorified, and I am the sick 
 one that You have cured, and I am the one asking that You have gave unto, and I 
 am the sinner that You have veiled, and I am the one who did the mistake and You 
 have forgave, and I am the one who had few and You have made into numerous 
 numbers, and I am the one who had no one for ally and You have been victorious 
 to, and I am the one who was banished and You have taken care of. I am O God the 
 one that was not ashamed in front of You when I was alone, and did not watch You 
 among the people. I am the one of the great sins. I am the one who dared against 
 his Master. I am the one who disobeyed the Almighty of heavens. I am the one who 
 bribed for the disobedience of the Holy. I am the one who heard the good tidings 
 went out searching for it. I am the one whom You have gave time and have never 
 refrained, and You have veiled me and yet I was not ashamed, and worked with the 
 sins and got aggressive, and You have dropped me down from Your eyes (Your care) 
 and I did not care. Thus, by Your patience You gave me time, and by Your veil 
 You have veiled me, until like You have forgotten about me, and from the 
 punishments of the sins You have avoided me, until like You were ashamed of me. 
 O my Lord I did not disobey You when I did so and was disbelieving in Your 
 Divinity, and not neglecting Your command, and not trying Your punishment, and 
 not unconcerned about Your promises, but it was a mistake that came along, and 
 my soul drove me to it, and my lust overcame me and was helped by my misery, and 
 I was tricked by Your veil that was over me, thus I disobeyed You and went 
 against You by my own will, and thus from Your own punishment who is going to 
 rescue me? And from the hands of the opponents by tomorrow who is going to save 
 me? And by what rope (way) then I shall hold on if You have cut Your rope away 
 from me? Alas! what a shame (that I have) from what Your book had counted of my 
 deeds, which if not for my hope in Your generosity and abundant mercy, and if 
 not for Your command to me that I should not despair, I would have been 
 despaired when I remember it (now). O You are the Best to pray to and the Best 
 to hope for. O our Lord, by the way of Islam I beg You, and by the holiness of 
 Quran I will depend on You, and by my love for the prophet, the Ummi (from the 
 mother-town), the Qurashite (from the tribe of Quraish), the Hashimite (from the 
 clan of Hashim), the Tohamite (from Tohama), the Meccan, the Medinian (from 
 Medina), I hope for closeness to You, thus do not disturb my enjoyment with my 
 faith, and do not make my rewards as the rewards of someone who worshipped other 
 than You, for there are people who believed in You by their tongues to save 
 their blood and they have achieved what they desired, and we believed in You by 
 our tongues and hearts to forgive us, thus grant us what You have promised us, 
 and plant Your hope in our chests, and do not let our hearts go astray after You 
 have guided us, and give us from You such a mercy, verily You are the Giver. 
 Thus, by Your Glory, if You scolded me I shall never leave the steps of Your 
 door and never stopped flattering You, for what my heart was inspired with about 
 Your generosity and the abundance of Your mercy. To where shall go the slave 
 except to his Master? And where to shall the created take refuge unto except to 
 his Creator? My Lord, if You tied me with chains, and abandoned me from having 
 Your grace among the witnesses, and guided the eyes of the slaves to my 
 scandals, and ordered for me to be in hell, and blocked the way between the 
 faithful and me, then I shall not cut out the hope from You, and would not look 
 some where else for mercy, and Your love shall never go out from my heart. I do 
 not forget Your help for me and Your veils for me in this life. O Master let the 
 love of this life go out from my heart, and gather me with the Chosen (the 
 prophet) and his Household, the best of Your creations, and the last of 
 prophets, Mohammed, may Allah pray upon him and upon his Household, and move me 
 to the level of repentance for You, and help me to cry over myself, for verily I 
 have lost my life in hopes and procrastination, and I have become in the place 
 of losing faith in my goodness, thus who has a worse situation than mine, if I 
 was moved in this state into a grave that I did not prepare for my sleep, and 
 did not furnish it with the good deeds for my laying. Thus, why should not I 
 cry, I cry for the outing of my soul, I cry for the darkness of my grave, I cry 
 for the narrowness of my grave, I cry for the questions of Munkar and NakÃ­r [two 
 angels that ask the dead about their deeds] to me, I cry for me going out naked 
 from my grave and humiliated and carrying my burdens over my back, looking once 
 to the right and once to the left while the creations are busy with something 
 else other than me. Every man that day will have concern enough to make him 
 heedless (of others), On that day faces will be bright as dawn, Laughing, 
 rejoicing at good news; And other faces, on that day, with dust upon them, 
 Veiled in darkness, and humiliation. Master upon You shall be my help and 
 dependence, and my hope and my reliance, and upon Your mercy shall be my 
 holding. You guide whoever You want and guide by Your generosity whoever You 
 love. Thus, praise be to You for purifying my heart of polytheism, and praise be 
 to You for fixing my tongue, or shall I be praising You with this tiresome 
 tongue? Or by doing the best of deed shall I satisfy You? And what is the value 
 of my tongue beside praising You? And what is the value of my deeds beside Your 
 favours and charity?</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord, Your generosity widened my hope, 
 and Your praise accepted my deeds. My Master, to You goes my desire and to You 
 goes my fear, and to You goes my hope and I was guided to You by my hope, and 
 upon (for) You O my One my deeds shall be achieved, and for what You have my 
 desire went on, and to You goes my sincere hopes and fears, and by You my love 
 got satisfaction, and towards You I did expand my hand, and by the rope of 
 obedience to You I shall expand my fear (of You).</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Master, by Your mention did my heart 
 live, and by speaking to You I cooled down the pains of fear from me, thus O my 
 Master and my Hope and the end to my enquiry, separate between me and my sin 
 that keeps away from obeying You, for I ask You for the old hope in You, and the 
 great desires from You, of what You have assigned to Yourself of passion and 
 mercy, thus it is all for You alone and no one share it with You, and all the 
 creations are dependant upon You and are in Your fist, and everything is under 
 Your control, blessed You are O God of the Worlds.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord, have mercy upon me if my causes 
 were out, and my tongue was tired to answer You, and my mind went astray when 
 You ask me, thus O my Great Hope do not disappoint me when my necessity is 
 extreme, and do not turn me back for my ignorance, and do not abandon me for my 
 short patience. Give me for my poverty, and have mercy upon me for my weakness, 
 O Master upon You shall be my dependence and help, and my hope and my reliance, 
 and by Your mercy I shall hang on, and over Your space I shall settle down, and 
 by Your generosity I shall seek my needs, and by Your generosity O God I begin 
 my pray, and with You I seek my necessity, and by Your richness I fix my 
 necessity, and under the shade of Your forgiveness shall be my standing, and to 
 Your hospitability and generosity I shall raise my eye sight, and at Your good 
 deeds I shall stare, thus do not burn me in hell while You are my hope, and do 
 not make me settle in the bottom (of hell) and You are the joy of my eyes. O 
 Master do not despair me with Your charity and favour, for You are my trust, and 
 do not prohibit me from Your reward, for You know my poverty.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord, if my end was near, and my deeds 
 did not make me any closer to You, I shall then make confessing my sins the way 
 to get to You. O my Lord, if You have forgiven me then who shall be the first to 
 forgive me? And if You have tortured then who is more just than You are? Have 
 mercy in this life upon my strangeness, and at the time of death (have mercy 
 upon) my trouble, and in the grave my loneliness, and in the tomb my fear, and 
 when it is the time to be between your hand (have mercy upon me) for the 
 humiliation of my situation, and forgive for me my deeds that humans did not 
 know, and make eternal for me what You have gave me, and have mercy upon me when 
 I am dead on bed flipped by the hands of my beloved, and have grace upon me when 
 I am expanded on the wash basin (dead washing basin) while being flipped by my 
 good neighbouring, and have passion upon me when I am carried while my relatives 
 are catching the corners of my funeral, and have hospitality for me when I am 
 down for You alone in my pit, and have mercy for my strangeness in that new 
 house, so that I would not have joy except with You.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O Master, if You have relied me to myself 
 then I am doomed, and then O Master from whom shall I ask for help if You did 
 not help me? And whom shall I seek if I lost Your care in my sleep? And whom 
 shall I take refuge unto if You did not relieve my adversity? O Master, who is 
 for me and who shall have mercy upon me if You did not have mercy upon me? And 
 whose grace shall I seek if I was forbidden from Your grace at the day of my 
 necessity? And to where shall I escape from my sins if my life is over? O Master 
 do not torture me while I am begging You.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord, satisfy my hopes and calm down my 
 fears, for I seek Your forgiveness only for the abundance of my sins. O Master, 
 I ask You what I do not deserve, and You are the One for faithfulness and 
 forgiveness, thus forgive me, and make me wear from Your Sight a dress that 
 covers my sins, and forgive me about it and never to ask me to give back again, 
 for You are verily the One of the old favours and the great forgiveness and the 
 generous excuse. O my Lord, You are the One who give Your riches for those who 
 do not ask You, and for those who deny Your Divinity, thus O Master, what about 
 those who ask You? And believed that the creations are for You and the matter is 
 Yours, blessed You are and Exalted, O  God of the Worlds.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O Master, Your slave is at Your door step, 
 his poverty made him stand between Your hands, and knocking on the door of Your 
 charity with his prayer, so do not turn away Your Generous Face from me, and 
 accept what I say, for I prayed with this prayer and I am hoping that You do not 
 turn me away, for I know Your passion and mercy. O my Lord, You are the One not 
 tired of beggars and not short of desirables, You are as You say and above what 
 we say. O my Lord, I ask You for a beautiful patience and a close-by relief, and 
 a true saying and a great reward. I ask You O my God from all of the goodness, 
 what I have known of it and what I have not. O my Lord, I ask You for the 
 goodness that Your faithful slaves had asked You for, O You Best to be asked and 
 the most hospitable of those who gave, give me what I ask for in myself and my 
 family and my parents, and my children and my close ones and my brothers in You, 
 and enrich my living, and show my nobility, and fix all my situations, and make 
 me one of those who You have lengthened his life and made his deeds better and 
 completed Your favours over him, and blessed him and made him live a good life, 
 in an eternal happiness and with full generosity and the best of living, for 
 verily You do what You want and no one else does what he wants except of You.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord, make me one of a special mention 
 for You, and do not let anything I do (of worshipping), during the night time 
 and the ends of the day time, to be a show off nor to make a reputation nor 
 arrogantly nor thanklessly, and make me of those who are humble before You. O my 
 Lord, give me the abundance of favours, and the safety of home, and the 
 enjoyment in the family and the money and the children, and being in Your 
 favours, and the health in the body, and the strength in the body, and the 
 safety of the religion, and use me for Your obedience and the obedience of Your 
 prophet, Mohammed may Allah pray upon him and upon his Household, as long as You 
 let me live, and make me one of Your slaves that have the abundant favours in 
 every goodness that You had revealed and will reveal in the month of Ramadhan 
 and the night of Qadr, and whatever You will reveal in every year of a mercy 
 that You will spread, and a health that You will give off, and an adversity that 
 You will banish, and rewards that You will grant, and sins that You will 
 forgive, and bestow upon me the chance to do pilgrimage to Your Holy House, in 
 this year of mine and in every year, and bestow upon me an abundant favour from 
 Your wide grace, and banish away from me O Master the bad things, and justly 
 with my debts and my unjust (deeds), so that I would not be hurt by any of it, 
 and take away from me the hearing and the sighting of my enemies and those who 
 envy me, and those who are aggressive toward me and make me victorious over 
 them, and make enjoyment to my eyes and happiness to my heart, and make for me a 
 relief and a salvation from my trouble and adversity, and make everyone that 
 desires badness for me of all Your creations to be under my feet, and avoid me 
 from the evil of the devil and the evil of the rulers, and my bad deeds, and 
 purify me from all my sins, and spare me from the hell by Your forgiveness, and 
 let me enter the paradise by Your mercy, and let me marry the nymphs (of 
 paradise) by Your grace, and let me follow (the path of) Your loyal faithful 
 people, Mohammed and his faithful Household, the kind and the purified and the 
 good, may Your prayers be upon them and upon their bodies and their souls, and 
 the mercy of Allah and His blessings.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord and Master, by Your Glory and Your 
 Holiness, if You asked after my sins then I shall ask after Your forgiveness, 
 and if You asked after my wickedness then I shall ask after Your generosity, and 
 if You let me into hell then I shall tell the people of hell about my love for 
 You. O my Lord and Master, if You do not forgive except for Your loyal people 
 and those obeying You, then to whom shall go the sinners? And if You do not 
 dignity except of those who are loyal to You, then from whom shall the wicked 
 ask for help? O my Lord, if You let me into the hell then that will make Your 
 enemy happy, and if You let me into paradise then that will make Your prophet 
 happy, and I know, by Allah, that the happiness of Your prophet is more beloved 
 to Yourself than the happiness of Your enemy.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord, I ask You to fill my heart with 
 Your love and Your fear, and more believing in Your book and more faith in You, 
 and more repentance for You and more eagerness for You, O One of Holiness and 
 Generosity, make me love the day of meeting You, and love my meeting, and let 
 comfort and relief and dignity be for me at the day when I meet You. O my Lord, 
 let me follow the path of the faithful people who had gone, and let me be one of 
 the faithful of those who remained (alive), and take me on the path of the 
 faithful, and help me with myself by what You help the faithful with their 
 selves, and let the end of my deeds be the best of them, and let my reward to be 
 the paradise by Your mercy, and help me with the good things that You bestowed 
 upon me, and make me firm O God, and do not let me back into a bad thing that 
 You have saved me from O God of the worlds.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord, I ask You for a faith that has no 
 limits before meeting You, and let me live with it as long You let me live, and 
 let me die with it whenever You let me die, and resurrect me with it when You 
 resurrect me, and heal my heart from showing off and doubts and the bad 
 reputation in Your religion, so that all my deeds become sincerely for You 
 (only). O my Lord, give me an insight into Your religion, and more understanding 
 in Your judgement, and more knowledge from Your wisdom, and a double of Your 
 mercy, and a faith that keeps me away from Your taboos, and enlighten my face 
 with Your light, and let my wishes be for what You have, and let me day on Your 
 path, and on the creed of Your messenger, may Allah prays upon him and upon his 
 Household.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord, I take refuge unto You from 
 laziness and failure, and sadness and cowardice and hoarding, and ignorance and 
 harshness and misery, and poverty and necessity and every adversity, and the 
 lewd things whether open or concealed, and I take refuge unto You from a soul 
 that does not get satisfied, and an abdomen that does not get filled, and a 
 heart that does not get humble, and a prayer that does not get heard, and a deed 
 that is not useful. And I take refuge unto You O God, for my soul and my 
 religion and my fortune and everything that You have gave me, away from the 
 damned devil, verily You are the Hearer and the Knower.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord, no one protects me against You, 
 and I do not find a place to hide from You, so do not make myself for something 
 in Your torture, and do not turn me away to doom, and do not turn me away to a 
 painful torture. O my Lord, accept from me and raise my mention, and raise my 
 status and let down my sins, and do not mention me by my sin, and let the reward 
 of my sitting and my speech and the reward of my prayer, You satisfaction and 
 the paradise. O God, give me all what I have asked You, and increase for me from 
 Your grace for I am seeking You O God of the worlds.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord, You have revealed in Your book 
 that we should forgive those who had been unjust toward us, and we had been 
 unjust to ourselves, thus forgive us, for You are verily better to do this than 
 us, and You have ordered us that we should not banish a beggar from the steps of 
 our doors, and I became begging to You, so do not turn me away unless You have 
 answered my needs, and You have ordered us to be good to what our right hands 
 possesses, and we are Your slaves so spare our necks from the hell.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my destination in my trouble, and my help 
 in my adversity, to You I run and ask for help and take refuge unto, and I do 
 not take refuge unto someone else but You and I do not ask for relief except 
 from You, thus help me and relieve me, O You who accepts the little and forgive 
 the many, accept the little from me, and relieve me from the many things (I 
 did), for You are verily the Merciful and the Forgiver.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">O my Lord, I ask You for a faith that dwells 
 in my heart, and a true belief, so that I would know that nothing will happen to 
 me except of that which You have destined for me, and let me be satisfied with 
 the livelihood that You have divided for me, O the most Merciful of those of 
 Mercy.</font></p>
 
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial">and may Allah prays upon Mohammed and the 
 Household of Mohammed.</font></p>
