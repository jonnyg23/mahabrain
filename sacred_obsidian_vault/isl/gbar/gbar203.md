 <h3>203.</h3>
 
 <p>'"O city, hard-hearted and perverse of mind, I have sent to thee my servant, to the end that he may convert thee to thine heart, and thou mayest repent; but thou, O city of confusion, hast forgotten all that I did upon Egypt and upon Pharaoh for love of thee, O Israel. Many times weepest thou that my servant may heal thy body of sickness; and thou seekest to slay my servant because he seeketh to heal thy soul of sin.</p>
 
 <p>'"Shalt thou, then, alone remain unpunished by me? Shalt thou, then, live eternally? And shall thy pride deliver thee from my hands? Assuredly not. For I will bring princes with an army against thee, and they shall surround thee with might, and in such wise will I give thee over into their hands that thy pride shall fall down into hell.</p>
 
 <p>'"I will not pardon the old men or the widows, I will not pardon the children, but I will give you all to famine, the sword, and derision, and the temple whereon I have looked with mercy, I will make desolate with the city, insomuch that ye shall be for a fable, a derision, and a proverb among the nations. So is my wrath abiding upon thee, and mine indignation sleepeth not."'</p>
