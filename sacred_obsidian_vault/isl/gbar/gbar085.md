 <h3>85.</h3>
 
 <p>'When a man worketh ill or talketh ill, if one go to correct him, and hinder such work, what doth such an one?' said Jesus.</p>
 
 <p>The disciples answered: 'He doth well, because he serveth God, who always seeketh to hinder evil, even as the sun that always seeketh to chase away the darkness.'</p>
 
 <p>Said Jesus: 'And I tell you on the contrary that when one worketh well or speaketh well, whosoever seeketh to hinder him under pretext of aught that is not better, he serveth that devil, nay, he even becometh his companion. For the devil attendeth to nought else but to hinder every good thing.</p>
 
 <p>'But what shall I say unto you now? I will say unto you as said Solomon the prophet, holy one, and friend of God: 'Of a thousand whom ye know, one be your friend.'</p>
 
 <p>Then said Matthew: 'Then shall we not be able to love anyone.'</p>
 
 <p>Jesus answered: 'Verily I say unto you, that it is not lawful for you to hate anything save only sin: insomuch that ye cannot hate even Satan as creature of God, but rather as enemy of God. Know ye wherefore? I will tell you; because he is a creature of God, and all that God hath created is good and perfect. Accordingly, whoso hateth the creature hateth also the creator. But the friend is a singular thing, that is not easily found, but is easily lost. For the friend will not suffer contradiction against him whom he supremely loveth. Beware, be ye cautious, and choose not for friend one who loveth not him whom ye love. Know ye what friend meaneth? Friend meaneth naught but physician of the soul. And so, just as one rarely findeth a good physician who knoweth the sickness and understandeth to apply the medicines thereto, so also are friends rare who know the faults and understand how to guide unto good. But herein is an evil, that there are many who have friends that feign not to see the faults of their friend; others excuse them; others defend them under earthly pretext; and, what is worse, there are friends who invite and aid their friend to err, whose end shall be like unto their villainy. Beware that ye receive not such men for friends, for that in truth they are enemies and slayers of the soul.</p>
