 <h3>152.</h3>
 
 <p>Jesus having come to Jerusalem, and having entered one Sabbath day into the Temple, the soldiers drew nigh to tempt him and take him, and they said: 'Master, is it lawful to wage war?'</p>
 
 <p>Jesus answered: 'Our faith telleth us that our life is a continual warfare upon the earth.'</p>
 
 <p>Said the soldiers: 'So wouldst thou fain convert us to thy faith, and wouldst that we should forsake the multitude of gods (for Rome alone hath twenty-eight thousand gods that are seen) and should follow thy god who is one only and for that he cannot be seen, it is not known where he is, and perchance he is but vanity.'</p>
 
 <p>Jesus answered: 'If I had created you, as our God hath created you, I would seek to convert you.'</p>
 
 <p>They answered: 'Now how hath thy God created us, seeing it is not known where he is? Show us thy God, and we will become Jews.'</p>
 
 <p>Then said Jesus: 'If ye had eyes to see him I could show him to you, but since ye are blind, I cannot show you him.'</p>
 
 <p>The soldiers answered: 'Of a surety, the honour which this people payeth thee must have taken away thine understanding. For every one of us hath two eyes in his head, and thou sayest we are blind.'</p>
 
 <p>Jesus answered: 'The carnal eyes can only see things gross and external: ye therefore will only be able to see your gods of wood and silver and gold that cannot do anything. But we of Judah have spiritual eyes, which are the fear and the faith of our God, wherefore we can see our God in every place.'</p>
 
 <p>The soldiers answered: 'Beware how thou speakest, for if thou pour contempt on our gods we will give thee into the hand of Herod, who will take vengeance for our gods, who are omnipotent.'</p>
 
 <p>Jesus answered: 'If they are omnipotent as ye say, pardon me, for I will worship them.'</p>
 
 <p>The soldiers rejoiced at hearing this, and began to extol their idols. Then said Jesus: 'Herein is not need of words but of deeds; cause therefore that your Gods create one fly, and I will worship them.'</p>
 
 <p>The soldiers were dismayed at hearing this, and wist not what to say, wherefore Jesus said:</p>
 
 <p>'Assuredly, seeing they make not a single fly afresh, I will not for them forsake that God who hath created everything with a single word; whose name alone affrighteth armies.'</p>
 
 <p>The soldiers answered: 'Now let us see this; for we are fain to take thee,' and they were fain to stretch forth their hands against Jesus.</p>
 
 <p>Then said Jesus: 'Adonai Sabaoth!' Whereupon straight-way the soldiers were rolled out of the Temple as one rolleth casks of wood when they are washed to refill them with wine; insomuch that now their head and now their feet struck the ground, and that without anyone touching them.</p>
 
 <p>And they were so affrighted and fled in such wise that they were never more seen in Judaea.</p>
