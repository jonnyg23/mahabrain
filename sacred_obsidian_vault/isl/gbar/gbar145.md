 <h3>145.</h3>
 
 <p>'As God liveth, in the time of Elijah, friend and prophet of God, there were twelve mountains inhabited by seventeen thousand Pharisees; and so it was that in so great a number there was not found a single reprobate, but all were elect of God. But now, when Israel hath more than a hundred thousand Pharisees, may it please God that out of every thousand there be one elect!'</p>
 
 <p>The Pharisees answered in indignation: 'So then we are all reprobate, and thou holdest our religion in reprobation!'</p>
 
 <p>Jesus answered: 'I hold not in reprobation but in approbation the religion of true Pharisees, and for that I am ready to die. But come, let us see if ye be Pharisees. Elijah, the friend of God, at the prayer of his disciple Elisha, wrote a little book wherein he included all human wisdom with the law of God our Lord.'</p>
 
 <p>The Pharisees were confounded when they heard the name of the book of Elijah, because they knew that, through their traditions no one observed such doctrine. Wherefore they were fain to depart under pretext of business to be done.</p>
 
 <p>Then said Jesus: 'If ye were Pharisees ye would forsake all other business to attend to this; for the Pharisee seeketh God alone. Wherefore in confusion they tarried to listen to Jesus, who said again: '"Elijah, servant of God" (for so beginneth the little Book). "to all them that desire to walk with God their creator, writeth this. Whoso desireth to learn much, they (<i>sic</i>) fear God little, because he who feareth God is content to know only that which God willeth.</p>
 
 <p>"They that seek fair words seek not God, who doth naught but reprove our sins.</p>
 
 <p>"They that desire to seek God, let them shut fast the doors and windows of their house, for the master suffereth not himself to be found outside his house, [in a place] where he is not loved. Guard therefore your senses and guard your heart, because God is not found outside of us, in this world wherein he is hated.</p>
 
 <p>"They that wish to do good works, let them attend to their own selves, for it booteth not to gain the whole world and lose one's own soul.</p>
 
 <p>"They that wish to teach others, let them live better than others, because nothing can be learned from him who knoweth less than ourselves. How, then, shall the sinner amend his life when he heareth one worse than he teaching him?</p>
 
 <p>"They that seek God, let him (<i>sic</i>) flee the conversation of men; because Moses being alone upon mount Sinai found him and spake with God, as doth a friend who speaketh with a friend.</p>
 
 <p>"They that seek God, once only in thirty days shall they come forth where be men of the world; for in one day can be done works for two years in respect of the business of him that seeketh God.</p>
 
 <p>"When he walketh, let him not look save at his own feet.</p>
 
 <p>"When he speaketh, let him not speak save that which is necessary.</p>
 
 <p>"When they eat, let them rise from the table still hungry; thinking every day not to attain to the next; spending their time as one draweth his breath.</p>
 
 <p>"Let one garment, of the skin of beasts, suffice.</p>
 
 <p>"Let the lump of earth sleep on the naked earth; for every night let two hours of sleep suffice.</p>
 
 <p>"Let him hate no one save himself; condemn no one save himself.</p>
 
 <p>"In prayer, let them stand in such fear as if they were at the judgment to come.</p>
 
 <p>'Now do this in the service of God, with the law that God hath given you through Moses, for in such wise shall ye find God that in every time and placed ye shall feel that ye are in God and God in you."</p>
 
 <p>'This is the little book of Elijah, O Pharisees, wherefore again I say unto you that if ye were Pharisees ye would have had joy that I am entered in here, because God hath mercy upon sinners.'</p>
