  <center>The First Part <br>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</center>  
 <p>When Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) got into the morning of the day of Ashurah, he stood up and preached to his companions after the noon's prayer and thanked Allah and praised Him and said: verily Allah, sanctified He is and Exalted had destined you and I to be killed in this day, so be patient and fight. Then he ranked them for the war and they were seventy seven between knights and foot soldiers and some said they were more than that. So he made Zohayr ben Al-Qayn on the right hand and <u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir on the left hand and gave his banner to his brother Al-`Abbás (PUH) [the brother of Al-<u>H</u>usayn but from a different mother] and he remained (PUH) with his Household in the heart. They made the tents at their backs and he ordered to bring some wood and sticks to be put behind the tents in a trench that they have made there at some time at night and ordered to set fire to it so that to avoid attacks from the back and it was useful for them. <br>Then, `Umar ben Sa`d marched towards Al-<u>H</u>usayn ben `Ali (PUT) (with at least 30,000) and he put on the right hand `Amr ben Al-<u>H</u>ajjáj Al-Zobaydi, and on the left hand Shimr ben Ðil-Jawshan, and head of the knights was `Urwah ben Qays and the head over the foot soldiers was Shabth ben Rab`ee and the banner was with his slave Dorayd, and they all came besieging the tents and saw the fire in the trench, and then Shimr called: O <u>H</u>usayn, you hurried on to the fire before the judgement day? Al-<u>H</u>usayn then said: who is that, seems like it is Shimr, and they answered him yes!! He then replied: O son of the goat shepherdess you are better for being burnt with it. <br>Then Muslim ben `Awsajah wanted to shoot an arrow at him but Al-<u>H</u>usayn ordered him not to and said: I hate to start the battle, and when Al-<u>H</u>usayn looked at their crowds like the raging flood he raised his hands for praying and said: <br>Allahoma [O my Lord] Thou art my trust in every adversity, and my hope in every trial, and Thou art for me in every matter a trust and a support. How many adversity weakens the core and lessens the plans and in which the friend lets down and the enemy turns happy for it I would rely (for it) on Thee and complained about it to Thee for my desire to Thee among all of the others, and Thou hath made it easy for me. Thou art the Owner of every favor and the Owner of every reward and the end of every desire. Then he asked for his camel and he rode it and called with a loud voice and most of them heard it, and he said: O people listen to my speech and don't be in a hurry until I preach for you for what is your right upon me and until I apologise for my arrival to you, thus if you accepted my apology and believed in my speech and gave me my rights you shall be happier with that and then you would have no reasons against me, and if you didn't accept my apology and didn't give the rights then gather up with your partners and don't let your matter be a cloudy one over you and then tell me what did you decide, and my support is Allah who revealed the book and He cares for the faithful. <br>When the women heard that from him they shouted and cried out loud and their voices raised up, so he sent to them his brother Al-`Abbás and his son `Ali and said to them: make them go silent, by my life their cries shall be more, and when they went silent, he thanked Allah and praised Him and blessed Mo<u>h</u>ammed and his Household and said the peace over the angels and the prophets and said so many uncountable things, and no speaker before him or after him was heard with such eloquence: </p><center> 
 <p>He who brought the eloquent speech is a reporter <br>from them or otherwise he steals <br>They were made equals for the book of Allah <br>although it is silent and they are the book that speaks</p></center>  
 <p>Then he said: Thank be to Allah who created life and made it a home of vanishing and extinction, controling its people from one situation to another, and the proud is the one who was deceived by it and the wretched is the one who got swayed with it, so do not be deceived by this life because it cuts the hopes of those who take refuge in it and disappoint the greed of those who wish for it. I see you and you've gathered for something that Allah turned angry with you for it and turned His glorious Face away from you and revealed His wrath upon you and avoided you from His mercy. Thus, praised He is our God and evil is what bondmen are you. You've swore fealty and obedience and believed in the messanger Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH) and then you've crawled towards his descendants and his Household desiring their killing. Verily the devil had taken over you and made you forget to mention the name of Allah the Great, so woe to you and to what you are asking for. We are to Allah and we shall turn back to Him. These are people that disbelieved after their believing and a far removal for wrongdoing folk! Then he said: and then, retrace my ancestry and see who am I, and then turn back to yourselves and blame yourselves and see are you allowed to kill me and violate my own property. Am I not the son of the daughter of your own prophet and the son of his successor and his cousin and (the son of) the first one who believed in the messanger of Allah for what he had brought from his God, is not <u>H</u>amzah the master of martyrs is my father's uncle? Is not Ja`far Al-<u>T</u>ayyár who is in paradise with two wings is my uncle? Did you not hear what the prophet (PUH) said about me and my brother "these are the masters of youth of paradise," so if you believed me in what I am saying and it is the truth, by Allah then I didn't lie for a purpose since I knew that Allah hate liars, and if you didn't believe in me there are people among you whom if you asked shall tell you about this matter. Ask Jábir ben `Abdullah Al-An<u>s</u>ári and Abá Sa`eed Al-Khidri and Sahl ben Sa`d Al-Sá`idi and Zayd ben Arqam and Anas ben Málik and Al-Borá' ben `Ázib, they shall tell you that they heard such speech from the prophet (PUH) about me and my brother, shall not this avoid you from killing me? Then Shimr ben Ðil-Jawshan said to him: he is a true worshipper who understood what you are saying, and then <u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir replied back at him and said: by Allah I see you worship Allah for seventy folds and I testify that you are saying the truth, you don't know what he (Al-<u>H</u>usayn) is saying because Allah had blackened your heart. <br>Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to them: if you are in doubt about that, do you doubt that I am the son of the daughter of your prophet? By Allah there is no son of daughter of a prophet like me in between the east and west and no one in others other than you. Woe to you, are you after me for a victim that I've killed? Or a fortune of you that I've used? Or for a revenge for some injury that I've made? But no one answered him. <br>Then he called: O Shabth ben Rab`ee, O <u>H</u>ajjár ben Abjar, O Qays ben Al-Ash`ath, O Zayd ben Al-<u>H</u>árith, didn't you all write to me that the fruit had ripened and the fields turned green, and if you come you shall find soldiers that are made for you? <br>They said: we did not! He (PUH) said then: Sanctified is Allah! Yes by Allah you did, then he said: O people, if you hate me then let me leave to my safe place on the lands. <br>Then Qays ben Al-Ash`ath said to him: don't you come down under the rule of your cousin? [meaning Yazeed] They will show you only what you like and never hurt you, then Al-<u>H</u>usayn said to him: you are the brother of your own brother, do you want the hashimites to ask after more than the blood of Muslim ben `Aqeel, no by Allah, I shall not give you my hand like a humble and shall not run away like a slave. O bondmen of Allah, I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord lest ye stone me to death, I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every scorner who believeth not in a Day of Reckoning. Then he kneeled down his camel and ordered `Uqbah ben Sam`án to tie it: </p><center> 
 <p>I did not forget him when he preached to them <br>while they have no words to say <br>Calling am I not the son of the daughter of your prophet <br>and your refuge if the life went to astray <br>Did I make some innovations in the religion of the prophet <br>or was I in doubt of what its laws say <br>Did not the prophet advise for us by his will <br>and left among you the Household and the book's way <br>If you did not believe in the judgement day <br>then turn back to your ancestry if you were arabs I say <br>And they turned away puzzled and see nothing <br>for his preach except the spears and arrows replying the say</p></center>  
 <p>And then the crowds started to crawl towards him. Among them there was `Abdullah ben <u>H</u>awzah Al-Tamimi who shouted and said: is Al-<u>H</u>usayn among you? In the third [seems he shouted 3 times] the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn replied back and said: this is Al-<u>H</u>usayn what do you want? He said: O <u>H</u>usayn I bring you the tidings of hell, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn said: you lied, but I shall come forward before a forgiving and obeyed God, who are you? He said: Ibn <u>H</u>awzah, then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) raised his hands high until the whiteness of his armpit showed up and said: Allahoma [O my Lord] take him to the hell! Then Ibn <u>H</u>awzah turned angry and rode the horse towards him while there was a stream between them, but his leg got hanged on the stirrup and the horse toured him in that way until he fell down from the horse and his leg was amputated along with his ankle and his thigh and his other half remained hanged with the stirrup and the horse knocked his body with every tree and every stone until he died. Masrooq ben Wá'il Al-Hadhrami said: I was at the head of the horses that went to fight Al-<u>H</u>usayn for I was wishing for the head of Al-<u>H</u>usayn and thus I might catch a fortune from Ibn Ziyád [the viceroy of Yazeed over Kufa] and when I saw what happened to Ibn <u>H</u>awzah I realized that the Household had a great honor and a great place by Allah, and then I left the people and said (to myself): I shall not fight them and become in hell! <br>Then Zohayr ben Al-Qayn went out for them on a horse with his weapon and he said: O people of Kufa, this is a warning for you against the wrath of Allah. This is a warning that a muslim has the right of advice over his muslim brother, and we are with you still on one religion as long as the sword did not fall in between us, and you are deserving for the advice and when the sword falls down, thus the bondage will be cut and we shall be a nation and you shall be another nation. Allah had verily tested us with the Household of His prophet Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH) to see what we and you shall do about them. We are calling you to be victorious to them, and to let down the tyrant Yazeed and `Ubaydilláh ben Ziyád for you do not realize from them except of their bad rule, to take out your eyes and amputate your hands and legs and cut you into pieces and raise you up over the palms and kill people like you and the best of you who could read (Quran) like <u>H</u>ijr ben `Adiy and his companions and Háni ben `Urwah and his likes!! Then they cursed him and praised `Ubaydilláh ben Ziyád and prayed for him and said: we shall not leave until we kill your partner (Al-<u>H</u>usayn) and whoever was with him or we shall send him with his companions to `Ubaydilláh ben Ziyád in peace!! <br>Then Zohayr ben Al-Qayn said: O bondmen of Allah, the son of Fatima deserves loyalty and to be victorious for more than the son of Somayyah [Yazeed], and if you are not willing to be victorious for them then I shall take refuge by Allah not to kill them, so leave this man and Yazeed for by my life he (Yazeed) accepts your obedience without killing Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH). <br>Then Shimr shot an arrow at him and said: shut up, my Allah shut off your voice! You've bored us with your so much talking, then Zohayr said: O son of him who pisses on his heels I am not talking to you, you are but a beast! by Allah, I don't think you are able to acknowledge two phrases from the book of Allah (Quran) so be glad with the shame on the judgement day and the harsh punishment, then Shimr said: Allah shall kill you with your partner (Al-<u>H</u>usayn) after some time, then Zohayr said: are you scaring me with death? By Allah, dying with him is more beloved to me than being eternal with you, then he went towards the crowds and said in a loud voice: O bond men of Allah, don't let this harsh man his likes make you astray from your religion, by Allah, a nation that spread the blood of the Household of Mo<u>h</u>ammed and his descendants and killed their companions and those who protect their harem will never receive the intercession of Mo<u>h</u>ammed. <br>Then a man from the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn called him and said: Abá `Abdilláh (Al-<u>H</u>usayn) say to you: come back, for by my life, if the believer man of the Pharaoh's family advised his people and prayed much, then you've advised those people. [The believer man of the Pharaoh's family is a story mentioned in Quran about a faithful man who believed in Moses and was among the Pharaoh's family and maybe his minister] <br>Then Borayr ben Khodhayr asked for a permission from Al-<u>H</u>usayn to talk to the people and he allowed him, and he was a faithful old man and a reader of Quran and one of the sheiks of Kufa and was a noble man among the (tribe of) hamadanites. <br>So he stopped near them and called: O people, verily Allah sent Mo<u>h</u>ammed with good tidings and warnings and a caller for Allah by His permission and an enlightening light, and this is the water of Al-Forát (Euphrates) which is open to the black boars and dogs but blocked away from the son of the propht of Allah, is that the reward of Mo<u>h</u>ammed? They replied: O Borayr, you've talked too much so stop it, by Allah Al-<u>H</u>usayn shall get thirsty like those who were before him! <br>He said: O people, the heaviness of Mo<u>h</u>ammed is now over your backs, and these are his Household and descendants and his daughters and harem, so show what do you have and what do you want to do with them? <br>They said: we want to force them down to the prince `Ubaydilláh ben Ziyád so that he decides about them. He replied: don't you accept for them to return back to where they came from? Woe to you! O people of Kufa did you forget your letters and covenants that you've sent and made Allah a witness over them? Woe to you! did you invite the Household of your prophet and claimed that you would kill yourselves for them and when they arrive at you, you give them to Ibn Ziyád and blocked their way to Al-Forát? Evil is what you've done with the Household of your prophet! What happened to you? May Allah never make you drink on the judgement day, evil is the kind of people you are. Then some of them said: O man, we don't understand what you are saying, and he replied: thank be to Allah who increased in my insight among you, Allahoma [O my Lord] verily I make myself clear from the deeds of those people! Allahoma throw the arrows among them until they meet You and You angry with them. <br>Then the people started to shoot arrows at Borayr and he stepped back, and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn rode his horse and took the Quran and put over his head and stood in front of the crowds and shouted out loud: by Allah do you know me? They said: yes, you are the son of the daughter of the prophet and his grandson, then he said: by Allah, do you that my grandfather is the prophet of Allah? They said: yes. He said: by Allah, do you know that my father is `Ali ben Abi-<u>T</u>álib (PUH)? They said: yes, he said then: by Allah, do you know that my mother is Fatima the daughter of the prophet of Allah? They said: yes, then he said: by Allah, do you know that my grandmother is Khadeejah bent Khowaylid [the mother of Fatima who was a noble woman as well in Mecca] the first woman to become a muslim in this nation? They replied: yes, then he said: by Allah, do you know that <u>H</u>amzah the master of martyrs is my father's uncle? They replied: yes, then he said: by Allah, do you know that Ja`far Al-<u>T</u>ayyár in paradise is my uncle? They said: yes, then he said: by Allah, do you know that this is the sword of the prophet of Allah that I'm holding in my hand? They said: yes, then he said: by Allah, do you know that this is the turban of the prophet of Allah that I am wearing? They replied: yes, then he said: by Allah, do you know that `Ali [his father] was the first man in this nation to become a muslim and the most wise of all and the greatest with patience and he is the viceroy over every believer? They said: yes, then he said: then why are you running to kill me? And my father is the protector, and the banner shall be in the hands of my father in the day of judgement, they said: we knew all of that and we shall never leave you until you die out of thirst. <br>In a narration, that he (PUH) rode over his camel and went out to the crowds and asked them to listen by they denied to do so, until he said to them: woe to you, why don't you listen to me and I am calling you to the rightful path and whoever obeyed me shall be guided and whoever disobeyed me shall be doomed and all of you will disobey my orders and would never listen to me, and that is because your abdomens are full of the taboo and your hearts were blackened, woe to you don't you listen, and then the companions of `Umar ben Sa`d blamed each other and then they said: listen to him. <br>Then he (PUH) praised Allah and blessed Mo<u>h</u>ammed and the angels and the prophets and extended with his eloquent speech and then he said: woe to you O people when you called for us with urge and we came to you in a hurry, you've raised a sword upon us that was for us and kept a fire that we kept for our enemy and yours and thus you've became united with your enemies against your rulers for no justice that they might have spread among you nor for a hope that was made for you within them, except of the taboo in this life that they will give you and a low living that you've been greedy for, for nothing that we've done and no opinion was offered. Did you like the woes? You left us and the swords are raised and the self is feeling safe, and the opinion should be for the wise, but you went in a hurry for it and came to it like the butterflies, then woe to you O slaves of this nation and the strangers of the parties and haters of the (holy) book and falsifiers of the speeches, you gangs of sins and the breath of the devil and the turners of the Sunna and killers of the children of the prophets and the terminators of the Households of the viceroys and followers of the adulterers in their lineage, and you who hurt the believers and the screams of the scoffers, those who break the Quran into parts, and woe to them for what their souls commited and in the hell they shall be eternal. Woe to you! Do you nourish those? and let us down? Yes by Allah, it is an old habit of you (to betray)! and your lineages have grown with that and your descendants took it over, and your hearts grown stable with it and your chests were blackened, thus you've become the most evil fruit that ripened and an easy food for the aggressor, may Allah damned the betrayers who break the covenant after the agreement and you've made Allah a witness over you, by Allah yes you are (like that)! The bastard, the son of the bastard [meaning Ibn Ziyád] had chosen two, either to fight or to humiliate, and far it would be for us to be humiliated, for Allah fobids this for us as well as His prophet and the believers, and the kind ancestry (of us) and the purified laps (who bore us) and dignified noses and the free souls, all deny this for us and to like to follow the mean rather than die with dignity. <br>Verily, I've warned you. Verily, I shall go on with this family with the few numbers and the numbered enemies and without nourishers, and then he said those lines of poetry for Farwah ben Mosayk Al-Morádi: </p><center> 
 <p>If we are defeated, we are the victorious in advance <br>and if we are taken over we are not of defeats <br>Verily we are not satisfied with cowardice <br>but it is our deaths and the state of others <br>If the death is taken away from some people <br>verily then it will settle on some others <br>And that vanished the trees of my people <br>as it vanished as well the old centuries <br>Thus if the kings were eternal we shall be too <br>and if they remained alive we would have long lives <br>Then say to those malevolents, stay awake <br>verily the malevolents will face like we did face</p></center>  
 <p>Then by Allah, you shall not remain after this for long and once you ride the horses until it (the life) shall turn around with you like the stone handmill and turned around on you, this is a covenant that my father made to me as well as my grandfather (the prophet) made it to him, then gather up your partners and deicde, and don't let it a clouded matter for you, and tell me what did you decide. <br>Verily, I've depended on Allah, my God and your God, no single living creature unless He shall take it back, verily my God is on a straight path. Then he raised his hands and said: Allahoma, catch away from them the drops of the heavens, and send over them some years like the years of Joseph and make the kid of Thaqeef rule over them [meaning Al-Mokhtár who revenged for Al-<u>H</u>usayn] and make them drink from a bitter cup, who shall not leave one of them unless he would kill him with one type (of killing) and hit him with one type (of hitting) who shall take revenge for me and for my companions and my Household and my followers from them, for they tricked us and lied to us and let us down, and You are our Lord, we've depended on You, and to You shall end the destiny. <br>Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) called for `Umar ben Sa`d, and they called him to the meeting and he hated to come and meet him, and then he said: O `Umar, you will kill me and you claim that the bastard, the son of the bastard will give you the rule of Al-Ray and Jorján? [areas in Iran] By Allah, you shall be happy with that at all, it is a covenant that was made, do whatever you want to do, you shall not be happy in this life or the Hereafter, as if I see your head being on a stick that stands in Kufa and the kids shall play with it. Then, `Umar ben Sa`d turned his face away with anger and then he called his companions and said: what are you waiting for? Fight all together at once it is but only one bite. <br>When Al-<u>H</u>ur ben Yazeed Al-Riyá<u>h</u>ee [the man who blocked the way of Al-<u>H</u>usayn and delivered him into Karbala] saw that the crowds insisted on fighting A-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), he said to `Umar ben Sa`d: will you fight this man? He replied: yes by Allah, a fight in which at least the heads would fall down with the hands! He (Al-<u>H</u>ur) said then: aren't you satisfied with what he offered? He replied: if it was in my hands I would be (satisfied), but your prince [Ibn Ziyád] denied that. Then Al-<u>H</u>ur left him and he advanced in front of the crowds with a man from his tribe called Qorrah ben Qays, and he said (to him): O Qorrah, did you water your horse today? He replied: no I didn't, then he said: don't you want to water him? Qorrah said: by Allah, I thought he wanted to stay from the battle and the fight, and didn't want me to see that if he did, so I said to him: I didn't water my horse and I shall go to water it, and I left that place in which he was, and by Allah if he showed me what he desired then I would go out with him to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH). Then Al-<u>H</u>ur began to approach towards Al-<u>H</u>usayn a little by little, and then Al-Mohájir ben Aws said to him: what do you want O son of Yazeed? Do you want to fight? But he didn't answer and his body started to shake, and Al-Mohájir then said to him: your situation is doubtful, by Allah I've never saw you like that before and if I was asked who is the bravest among the people of Kufa I wouldn't choose anyone but you! So what is that that I see from you? Then Al-<u>H</u>ur: by Allah, verily I'm giving the options for myself to choose between paradise and te hell, and by Allah I shall not choose anything but the paradise, even if I was to be cut into pieces and burnt. <br>Then he struck his horse towards Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and put his hand over his head and said: Allahoma to You I go, have mercy upon me for I scared the hearts of Your viceroys and the children of Your own prophet (PUH), and then he said to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH): may I be a ransom for you O son of the prophet of Allah, I am the one who kept you away from turning back and marched with you all the way and made you settle in this land, and I don't think the crowds will answer your offer and never reach closer to you, by Allah if I knew they are planning to do this, I wouldn't have done what I've done already, and here I am I've came to you to repent to my Lord for what I did, and sacrficing myself for you until I die between your hands, so do you see any forgiving for me? Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said: yes, Allah shall forgive you so come down, but he replied: I am better for you on my horse rather than on my foot, and I shall fight them over my horse for some time and then at the end I shall come down, so then Al-<u>H</u>usayn to him: do whatever you see may Allah have mercy upon you. Then he stepped in front of Al-<u>H</u>usayn and said: O people of Kufa, did you invite this faithful man and when he arrived you tried to capture him, and you claimed that you are willing to kill yourselves to protect him and then stepped with aggression towards him to kill him, and imprisoned him and surrounded him from all the sides to keep him away from going on the wide lands of Allah, so he became like the hostage between your hands and has no power for himself and blocked his away with his women and children and his family from the water of Al-Forát which goes on and jews with christians and the magians drink from it as well as the black boars and the dogs roll in it, and here are they killed by the thirst, evil is what you've done to the Household of Mo<u>h</u>ammed after him, may Allah never make you drink when you become thirsty. Then some men shot arrows on him so he stepped back until he stood in front of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and then said to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH): if I was the first one to come out to fight you, then let me be the first one to get killed before your hands, may I be one of those who shall shake the hands with your grandfather Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH) tomorrow in the judgement day, so Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) gave him the permission, and he attacked the fellows of `Umar ben Sa`d while saying: </p><center>Verily I am Al-<u>H</u>ur the safe place of the guest <br>and I shall strike your necks with the sword <br>Defending the purest who stepped on Al-Khayf [spot in Mecca] <br>I shall strike you and see no lesser to this word</center>  
 <p>Then he fought severely until he killed around 40 men of them, and he was attacking with Zohayr ben Al-Qayn, thus whenever one man attacks and went deep inside them, the other would attack to rescue his partner. Then the foot soldiers attacked Al-<u>H</u>ur and surrounded him in great numbers until they killed him, and the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) carried his body until they put it between the hands of Al-<u>H</u>uysan (PUH) while his soul still not released and his blood was gushing out, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) rubbed the dust off his face and said: Bakhen Bakhen [expression to congratulate] for you O <u>H</u>ur, you are Al-<u>H</u>ur like your mother named you, you are free in this life and the Hereafter. [<u>H</u>ur means "the free man" or "free" in Arabic]. <br>Then `Umar ben Sa`d stepped towards the camp of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and put an arrow in his bow and shot at the camp and said: testify for me at the court of the prince that I am the first to shoot, and then the crowds started to shoot and the arrows arrived from the crowds like the rain and no single companion of Al-<u>H</u>usayn was spared, and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to his companions: stand up may the mercy of Allah befall upon you, to the death that is awaiting, for these arrows are the messages of the crowds to you. <br>There was among the fellows of Ibn Sa`d [`Umar] a man called Yazeed ben Al-Mohájir Al-Kindi and his title was Abul-Sha`thá', and when the crowds replied back at the offer of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) he went to his camp and fought between his hands while saying: </p><center> 
 <p>I am Yazeed and my father is Al-Mohájir <br>braver than a lion in his own lair <br>O my Lord I am a nourisher for Al-<u>H</u>usayn <br>and for Ibn Sa`d I shall leave forever</p></center>  
 <p>then he sat down before Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and shot 100 arrows and 5 hit the target, and every time he shot an arrow Al-<u>H</u>usayn used to say to him: Allahoma, make his shot in the target and let his reward be the paradise, so he killed 5 of the fellows of `Umar ben Sa`d with his arrows and he was the first to kill. <br>Then the crowds battled and fought for some time and when the dust was cleared out, they found 50 companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn dead, then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) held his beard with his hand and said: Allah got angry over the jews for they made up a son for Him, and got angry over the christians for they made Him the third of three, and got angry over the magians for worshipping the sun and the moon instead of Him, and got angry over some people that agreed to kill the son of the daughter of their prophet. By Allah, I shall not answer them for what they desire until I meet Allah the Exalted painted with my blood. <br>Then Yasár the slave of Ziyád showed up, and Sálim the slave of `Ubaydilláh ben Ziyád as well and they said: who shall combat, and then <u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir and Borayr ben Khodhayr stood up, but Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to them: sit down, and then `Abdulláh ben `Umayr Al-Kalbi stood up and took the permission from Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) to combat with them, and he was a tall man with wide shoulders, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) looked at him and said: verily I think he is a killer of people of his likes, and he gave him the permission (and he went out of Kufa at night with his wife Um-Wahab for Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) because when he saw the soldiers among the palm trees going to fight Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), he said then: by Allah I am cautious to fight the disbelievers and I hope that fighting those people that are going to fight the son of the daughter of their prophet is not any less in rewards from that fighting with the disbelievers, and he told his wife about it and she said: you are right, go out and let me go out with you). <br>Then when he went out, Yasár faced him and said to him: who are you? So he mentioned for him his lineage and ancestry [a habit of Arabs in combat to mention the ancestry of each side before fighting], then he said to him: I don't know you, let Zohayr ben Al-Qayn get out for me or let <u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir or Borayr ben Khodhayr, and then Ibn `Umayr [`Abdulláh] said: O son of the adulteress, are you afraid to face some people in a combat? No one goes out to combat with you unless he is better than you. Then he (`Abdulláh) went down on him with his sword and while he was busy with him (with Yasár), Sálim attacked him as well and his companions shouted out loud: the slave is attacking you, but he didn't care about it and then Sálim went down with his sword on him but he received it with his hand and his fingers were amputated and then Ibn `Umayr attacked him until he killed him so got back (to the camp) and he killed both of them while he was saying: </p><center>If you deny me then I tell you I am the son of Ibn Kalb <br>the lineage of my ancestry is with He who knows the ancestry <br>I am someone of bitterness and sharp (like a sword) <br>and not a coward at the time of the adversity <br>I am promising you O Um-Wahab <br>to stab them truely and beat them as well accordingly</center>  
 <p>Then Um-Wahab his wife took a pillar and went towards him and said to him: may my father and mother be a ransom for you, fight for the sake of the purified, the Household of Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH), and he wanted to get her back to the tent  but she didn't go along with him and started to hold his clothes and said: I shall not leave you until I die with you, and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn called her and said: may you be rewarded from the Household of your prophet with goodness, get back to the tent for women are not supposed to fight, and so she got back. <br>Then `Abdulláh ben `Umayr fought bitterly until he killed another two, and then he was killed by Háni ben Thobayt Al-<u>H</u>adhrami and Bakeer ben <u>H</u>ay Al-Tamimi. <br>Then `Umar ben Khálid Al-<u>S</u>aydáwi stood up to fight and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to him: advance, we shall be after you after some time, then he fought with his slave Sa`d and with Jábir ben Al-<u>H</u>árith Al-Salmáni and Majma` ben `Abdulláh Al-`Á'iði and all of them attacked the crowds of Kufa, and when they went deep inside them, they turned around them and blocked them away from their partners, and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) sent to them his brother Al-`Abbás and he saved them by his sword, and they were all injured, and on the way back the enemy approached them so they raised their swords with all the injuries they had and fought until they all got killed in one place. <br>Then when the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) looked at how much men they lost, men started to take permissions from Al-<u>H</u>usayn to protect him and defend the harem in groups, while they protect each other from the attacks of the enemy. Thus, two young men came to him and they are: Sayf ben Al-<u>H</u>árith ben Saree` and Málik ben `Abdulláh ben Saree` and they were cousins and brothers from the mother side, and they took the permission from him to fight before him, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) allowed them to, and they fought bitterly until they got killed. <br>And then the two Ghafáris [their tribe name is Al-Ghafári], and they are: `Abdulláh and `Abdul-Ra<u>h</u>mán the sons of `Urwah and they said to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH): peace upon you O Abá-`Abdilláh, we've come to fight before you and defend you, and he said: welcome, and then he asked them to get closer to him, and so they did while they were crying, and he said: what makes you cry O children of my brother? By Allah, I hope you shall be satisfied and happy after some time from now, and they said: may Allah make us a ransom for you, we are not crying for ourselves but we are crying for you, we see you surrounded by enemies and we cannot help you, so he said then: may Allah reward you O children of my brother for your sacrifice with goodness as best as it can be, then they stepped forward and said: peace upon you O son of the prophet of Allah, and then he said: and peace upon you (two) and the mercy of Allah and His blessings, and then they fought close by until they got killed. <br>Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) shouted out loud: aren't there any helper that would help us for the sake of Allah, aren't there any defender that would defend the house of the prophet of Allah, and the women and children heard him and started to scream out loud. <br>Then, Sa`d ben Al-<u>H</u>árth Al-An<u>s</u>ári Al-`Ajaláni and his brother Abul-<u>H</u>otoof heard the call of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and the screams of his children and they were with `Umar ben Sa`d, so they raised their swords with Al-<u>H</u>usayn against his enemies and started to fight until they killed some men and injured some others until they got killed together. <br>Then, the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn when they became less in number and their shortage of men began to show up, man after another started to show up and fight, and they killed so many of the kufans. <br>Then, `Amr ben Al-<u>H</u>ajjáj shouted at his companions and said: do you know who are you fighting? you are fighting the knights of the land and the people of the insight and people that don't care about death! No one would go out to fight with them unless he got killed although they are just a few, by Allah if you don't stone them you won't kill them. <br>Then, `Umar ben Sa`d said: the truth you've said! The opinion is what you've said, so send the orders to the crowd not a single a man shall fight with them for if you go on in singles for sure they will terminate you. <br>Then, `Amr ben Al-<u>H</u>ajjáj attacked the right wing of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) but they were stable against him and they kneeled down and raised the spears so the horses couldn't advance, and when the horses went to get back, the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn shot the arrows at them, so they killed some of them and injured some others. Then `Amr ben Al-<u>H</u>ajjáj attacked from the direction of Al-Forát and they fought for some time, and there where Muslim ben `Awsajah Al-Asdi fought, and attacked them Muslim ben `Abdilláh Al-Dhabábi and `Abdulláh Al-Bajali, and the heavy dust turned into the air from the fierce battle, and when it was cleared out they found Muslim ben `Awsajah on the ground with some life in him. So, Al-<u>H</u>usayn walked to him with <u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir Al-Asdi, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn said to him: may Allah have mercy upon you O Muslim! Some of them have paid their vow by death (in battle), and some of them still are waiting; and they have not altered in the least, and then <u>H</u>abeeb got closer to him and said: your death is hard for me! O Muslim be glad in paradise! Then Muslim said in a faint voice: may Allah bring the good tidings to you. Then <u>H</u>abeeb said to him: if I wasn't sure that I will be after you in few moments, I would like to ask you to recommend for me whatever you like, then Muslim replied: verily, I recommend this for you, and he pointed to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) so fight before him until you die. Then <u>H</u>abeeb said to him: verily I shall make you glad! Then he died may Allah be pleased with him. </p><center> 
 <p>They nourished you alive and also when they were dead <br>each partner recommend for the other to nourish you <br>Ibn `Awsajah recommended to <u>H</u>abeeb and said <br>fight before him until the fierce death comes after you</p></center>  
 <p>Then a maid for him (`Awsajah) shouted: Alas! my master! Alas! Ibn `Awsajah! Then the companions of Ibn Sa`d shouted in happiness: we've killed Muslim ben `Awsajah, and then Shabth ben Rab`ee said: may your mothers bereave you, verily you are killing yourselves by your own hands and humiliate yourselves for the others, are you glad that you killed Muslim ben `Awsajah? By the One that I've been muslim for, how many good deeds he had among the muslims, and I saw him at the day of Azerbaijan killing 6 disbelievers before the horses of the muslims are cured. <br>Then, Shimr ben Ðil-Jawshan attacked with his companions on the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), and Zohayr ben Al-Qayn attacked them back with 10 men from the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) so they made them stay away from the tents and they killed Abá `Aðrah Al-Dhabábi, one of the companions of Shimr, and then Shimr turned around on them so they killed some of them and the rest turned back to their positions, and Abu-Thomámah Al-<u>S</u>á'idi [or Al-<u>S</u>aydáwi] killed one of his cousins who was an enemy of his. <br>Then, the time of the noon's prayer arrived, and Abu-Thomámah Al-<u>S</u>aydáwi said to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH): O Abá `Abdilláh, myself for yourself to be a ransom, these got closer to you and by Allah you shall not be killed until I die before you and I like to meet Allah after praying this prayer. Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) raised his head into the sky and said: you've remembered the prayer time may Allah make you one of the prayers and the sanctifiers, yes this is the beginning of its time, and then he said: ask them to stop so that we can pray, and so they did. Then Al-<u>H</u>o<u>s</u>ayn ben Tameem said to them: it shall not be accepted [meaning the prayer shall not be accepted before Allah]. <br>Then <u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir said to him: you've claimed that the prayer is not accepted from the Household of the prophet (PUH) and their nourishers and shall be accepted from you O jackass? Then Al-<u>H</u>o<u>s</u>ayn attacked him and <u>H</u>abeeb attacked as well and he struck the face of his horse with the sword and Al-<u>H</u>o<u>s</u>ayn fell down, and shouted for help from his companions and so they did and they attacked <u>H</u>abeeb and he killed one man of them. <br>Then, Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to Zohayr ben Al-Qayn and Sa`eed ben `Abilláh Al-<u>H</u>anafi: stand in front of me to let me pray the noon's prayer, and so they did with half of the companions until he prayed the prayer of Fear, then one arrow reached Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and Sa`eed ben `Abdilláh stood to protect him against the arrows by his body and he remained like that while arrows kept on coming to him until he fell down on the ground and said: Allahoma, damn them like the damnations of `Ád and Thamood, Allahoma, tell Your prophet the peace from me and tell him what I saw of painful injuries, for verily I wanted Your reward for protecting the Household of Mo<u>h</u>ammed (and in some other narrations he said: Allahoma, nothing of what You desire is impossible for You, so tell Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH) how I nourished and protected Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and make me be with him in the eternity). Then he died, may Allah be pleased with him, and they found out 13 arrows planted in his body, adding to that the strikes of swords and spears. Then, Sowayd ben `Amr ben Abi-Mo<u>t</u>á` advanced and he was a noble and a faithful man of many prayers, and he said: </p><center> 
 <p>Defend Al-<u>H</u>usayn today and you shall meet Mo<u>h</u>ammed <br>and your lord `Ali, the man of the virtues <br>And <u>H</u>asan like the moon in its full shape <br>and your uncle the eager for flesh and the pious <br><u>H</u>amzah the lion of Allah verily called the lion <br>and the one with the one of two wings got place so glorious <br>in the paradise going there in the high places <br>[one of two wings is Jafar the uncle of Al-<u>H</u>usayn]</p></center>  
 <p>So he fought like the brave lion and had the great patience over the adversities until he fell down with the dead with so many injuries, and he remained like that without any movement until he heard them later on saying that Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) got killed so he carried himself hardly and got a knife out of his sandal and fought until he got killed, may Allah be pleased with him. <br>Then, Zohayr ben Al-Qayn got out saying: </p><center>Verily I am Zohayr and I am the son of Al-Qayn <br>I shall fight you with the sword to defend Al-<u>H</u>usayn <br>Verily Al-<u>H</u>usayn is one of the Grandsons [of the prophet] <br>from the Household of the virtuous and the most fine <br>Verily that is the prophet of Allah <br>and I shall strike you and see no harm within <br>O how I wish my soul would be splitting</center>  
 <p>Then he fought fiercly until he killed as some narrations go, 120 men, and then he was attacked by `Abdulláh Al-Tamimi and Mohájir ben Aws Al-Tamimi and they killed him. Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said when Zohayr got killed: may Allah not make you far away O Zohayr and may He damn your killer like He damned those who mutated into monkeys and boars. <br>Then, `Ábis ben Shabeeb Al-Shákiri came with Shawðab, the slave of Bani Shákir, and he said: O Shawðab what do you have in mind to do? He replied: what to do? I shall fight with you defending the son of the daughter of the prophet of Allah (PUH) until I get killed. He replied: this is my thought about you, so step before Abá `Abdilláh to recognize you like he did with the others, and to recognize you me myself for this is a day that we should ask for the rewards in by everything we can do, for there are no deeds after that, it is but the judgement after that. Then Shawðab stepped forward and said: peace upon you O Abá `Abdilláh and the may the mercy of Allah befall upon you and His blessings, I shall leave you with Allah. Then he fought until he got killed. <br>Then `Ábis stepped forward and said: O Abá `Abdilláh verily by Allah there is no one on the face of earth from far away or near by that can be more dear to myself than you, and if I could defend you against the unjust and being killed by something dearer than my soul and blood I would have done that, peace upon you O Abá `Abdilláh, and I make Allah a testifier for that I am on your path and the path of your father, then he went with his sword towards them directly and he had a mark on his forehead. Rabee` ben Tameem Al-<u>H</u>arithi said: when I saw him coming I knew him and I saw him many times in wars and he was one of the bravest people so I said (to the crowds): O people this is the lion of the lions the son of Shabeeb, the mighty, no one shall go out to combat with him, stone him, and so they did, and then `Ábis called: one man for one man, but the people avoided him for his bravery, and Ibn Sa`d [`Umar] then said: stone him severly, and they stoned him from all the sides, and when he saw that he dropped down his shield and his helmet and attacked the crowds and defeated them. The narrator said: by Allah, I saw him knocking out more than 200 from the crowds, and then they surrounded him from all sides and they killed him, then I saw his head at the hands of some men with their weapons, each of them say that he killed him, then Ibn Sa`d said: don't fight now, this man is not killed by one single man, so he resolved that issue among them. <br>Then <u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir Al-Asdi showed up and said: </p><center> 
 <p>I am <u>H</u>abeeb and my father is Mozháhir <br>a knight of the wars and the fire that burns <br>Verily you are great in numbers <br>but we have the higher hands <br>And you betray at the time of loyalty <br>and we are more loyal than you and have the patience <br>Verily, we are more faithful than you all and better</p></center>  
 <p>Then, he fought bitterly and he killed a man from (the tribe of) Bani Tameem that was called Bodayl ben <u>S</u>oraym, and another man from Tameem attacked him and stabbed him, so he wanted to get up, then he received a strike from Al-<u>H</u>o<u>s</u>ayn ben Tameem on his head with the sword and he fell down, and then the man of Tameem came down to him and beheaded him, and his death shocked Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and he said: by Allah I shall recognize myself and the protectors of my companions. Then Al-<u>H</u>o<u>s</u>ayn said to the man of Tameem: I am your partner in killing him (<u>H</u>abeeb), the man replied: no by Allah (you're not). He said: give me the head to hang it on the neck of my horse to let the people see that I'm your partner in killing him and then take it back for I don't have any benefit from whatever Ibn Ziyád would give you. So, he gave him the head and he toured among the people with it and then returned it back to him and when he returned to Kufa he hanged it on the neck of his horse. <br>Then a turkish slave for Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) that was called Aslam, and he was a Quran reader, he went out to fight while saying: </p><center> 
 <p>The sea is burning from my stabbing and hitting <br>and the air is full of my arrows and darts <br>When my sword is in my right hand raising up <br>The heart of the envious noble shall be torn in parts</p></center>  
 <p>Then he killed 70 men and fell down on the ground, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) then came to him and cried and then put his cheek on his cheek, and then Aslam opened his eyes and saw Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), then he smiled and his soul got out of his body. <br>Then, Borayr ben Khodhayr Al-Hamadáni got out and he was a faithful man and considered the best reader of Quran at his time and he was called "the master of readers" and he said: </p><center>I am Borayr and my father is Khodhayr <br>verily there is no blessings for him who has no goodness</center>  
 <p>Then he started to attack the crowds while saying: get closer to me you O killers of the believers, get closer to me O killers of the sons of those who were in Badr, get closer to me you O killers of the prophet's sons and his Household. Then, Yazeed ben Ma`qal got out for him and said: O Borayr how do you see what Allah has done with you? He replied: verily He made the goodness with me and the evil with you, then Yazeed said: you lied, and you were not a liar before this day, do you remember when I was walking with you among Bani Lawáðin and you were saying: `Uthmán was a squanderer over himself and Mo`áwiyah is astraying and made people astray, and the true leader of the guidance is `Ali ben Abi <u>T</u>álib, then Borayr said: I testify that this is my saying and this is my opinion, and then Yazeed said: I testify that you are an astraying man. Then Borayr said: come on and let's pray humbly and invoke the curse of Allah over the liar (between us), and so they did and then they made a combat and struck each other two times, thus Yazeed hit Borayr lightly and did not harm him but Borayr struck him hardly on his helmet and made the sword go through until it reached his brain, so he fell down and the sword remained in his head. Then Radhi ben Monqið Al-`Abdi attacked Borayr and hugged him and fought for some time, and then Borayr threw him to the ground and sat on his chest, and Ka`b ben Jábir Al-Azdi stabbed him on his back with his spear, so Borayr got down from Ibn Monqið after biting his nose and cutting it, and then `Afeef ben Zohayr ben Abi Al-Akhnas shouted at him (at Ka`b): this is Borayr ben Khodhayr the reader, the one who was reading Quran to us in Kufa mosque, but he (Ka`b) didn't look at him and struck him with the sword until he killed him, may Allah be pleased with him. <br>And when Ka`b ben Jábir returned back from the battle later on, his wife said to him: you've helped against the son of Fatima and killed Borayr the master of the readersm verily I shall never talk to you again, and then he said: </p><center> 
 <p>[here comes a long poem describing how he is proud in fighting Al-<u>H</u>usayn]</p></center>  
 <p>And then, Wahab ben <u>H</u>abbáb Al-Kalbi raised and he was a christian, but turned into Islam by the hands of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and he was with his mother and his wife, and his mother said: raise up O son and nourish the son of the daughter of the prophet of Allah (PUH), and he said: I shall do mother and not any less, so he raised up and said: </p><center> 
 <p>If you deny me then I am the son of Al-Kalbi <br>you shall see me and see my beating <br>And my attacks and fight in the war <br>after the revenge of my partners my revenge I shall be chasing <br>I shall push away the adversity in the face of the adversity <br>and my fighting in the war is verily not playing</p></center>  
 <p>Then he attacked until he killed some of them and got back to his wife and his mother, and he said: O mother, are you satisfied yet? She replied: I'm not satisfied unless you are killed defending Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), and his wife said: by Allah, don't frighten me with yourself, and his mother said: O son, neglect her saying and get back to fight before the son of the daughter of your prophet, and you shall receive the intercession of his grandfather at the day of the judgement. He got back and fought until his both hands were amputated!! Then his wife took a pillar and ran towards him and said: may my father and my mother be ransoms for you, defend the kind people the Household of the prophet of Allah (PUH), and he said to her: you were advising me to stop fighting and now you're here to fight with me, and then she said: O Wahab, don't blame me, verily the cries of Al-<u>H</u>usayn have broken my heart. He asked: what did you hear him say? She said: O Wahab I saw him sitting at the enterance of the tent while he was crying and saying: Alas! No nourisher!! Then Wahab cried a lot and said to her: get back to the women may Allah have mercy upon you, but she denied and then Wahab shouted: my lord Abá `Abdilláh, let her get back to the tent, and so the imam did. <br>Then the people gathered around him and killed him, and his mother walked to him, and some say it was his wife, and sat down beside him rubbing the blood off his body and say: congratulations for you got the paradise, and I ask Allah who gave you the paradise to let me go with you. <br>Then Shimr said to his slave Rostom, hit her head, and so he did, and she died in her place and she was the first woman to die from the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn. <br>Then `Amr ben Qorzhah Al-An<u>s</u>ári raised up and took the permission from Al-<u>H</u>usayn and he allowed him to go, so he went and said: </p><center> 
 <p>Verily the phalanx of Al-An<u>s</u>ári knew <br>that I shall protect the boundaries of honor <br>Strikes of a kid that doesn't run away <br>and for Al-<u>H</u>usayn shall be my life and home</p></center>  
 <p>So then he fought like someone waiting for the reward until he killed so many of them, and no single arrow would arrive at Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) that he wouldn't receive with his hand, or a sword that he wouldn't receive with his heart and so no harm reached Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) until he was thickened with injuries and then he looked at Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and said: O son of the prophet of Allah, did I fullfil? He replied: yes, you are in front of me in paradise, so tell the prophet of Allah (PUH) my greetings and tell him that I will be there soon too. Then he fought until he got killed, may Allah be pleased with him. He had a brother who was with `Umar ben Sa`d who said to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH): you've tricked my brother until you killed him? Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to him: Allah did not trick your brother but verily He guided him and made you astray, and he said: may Allah kill me if I didn't kill you or I shall die, so he attacked but his way was blocked by Náfi` ben Hilál who stabbed him and got him down, and then companions saved him. <br>Then a young man whose father got killed in the battle raised up and his mother was with him, and she said to him: get out O son and fight before the son of the prophet of Allah (PUH), and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said: this is a young man whose father got killed in the battle maybe his mother hates to see him out there, then the young man said: my mother is the one who ordered me to go out! So he got out and said: </p><center>my prince is <u>H</u>usayn and what a prince is he <br>the gladness of the heart of the omen and warner <br>`Ali and Fatima are his parents <br>do you know anyone to him like similar <br>He has a face like the sun of the noon <br>and he has a beard like the bright moon</center>  
 <p>And then he fought until he got killed and got beheaded and his head was thrown towards the camp of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), so his mother then carried his head and said: good deed you've done my son, O the gladness of my heart and the gladness of my eyes. Then she threw the head of her son towards a man and she got him killed, and she took the pillar of the tent and attacked them while saying: </p><center> 
 <p>I am an old woman for my lord and weak <br>empty and thin I am and unable <br>I shall strike you bitterly <br>defending the sons of Fatima the honorable</p></center>  
 <p>And she struck two men and killed them, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn  ordered to get her back and he prayed for her. <br>Then `Amr ben Khálid Al-<u>S</u>aydáwi raised up and said to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH): O Abá `Abdilláh, verily I am now to follow my partners and I hated to leave and see you alone and dead, so Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to him: advance, verily we shall follow you in some time. So he advanced and fought until he got killed. <br>Then, <u>H</u>anzhalah ben As`ad Al-Shibámi came before Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) to protect him against the arrows and the spears and the swords by his face and his neck. Then he called and said: O people, I am afraid for you a day like the day of the parties [day of parties a name of a battle that was between muslims and disbelievers], like the deeds of the people of Noah and `Ád and Thamood and those who came after them, and verily Allah doesn't wrong the bondmen. And, O people, I fear for you a Day of Summoning, when you run away and have nothing to protect you against Allah, O people don't kill Al-<u>H</u>usayn for verily Allah will destroy you by His punishment, and he shall be disappointed whoever spread the lies. Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to him: O son of As`ad may Allah have mercy upon you, verily they deserved the punishment when they answered your calls previously and raised up to curse you with your companions, how is it now and they killed your faithful companions. He replied: you are right, may I be a ransom for you, shouldn't we go to our Lord and follow our brothers? He (Al-<u>H</u>usayn) said: for sure, go to something better from this life and what is in it and to an eternal fortune. He then said: peace upon you O son of the prophet of Allah (PUH) and upon your Household and may we be together in heaven, and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn replied: Amen, Amen. So he went out to the crowds and fought bitterly until he got killed. <br>Then Náfi` ben Hilál Al-Jamli raised up and fought fiercely and he was shooting the crowds with poisoned arrows and his name was written on them and he was saying: </p><center> 
 <p>I shall throw it and their tops are marked <br>and the soul shall see no benefit from its fearing <br>Poisoned that goes within its heart <br>to fill the land from its spreading</p></center>  
 <p>And he kept on shooting at them until he had no more, and then he held his sword and took it out and said: </p><center> 
 <p>I am the kid of Al-Jamali from Yemen <br>verily the creed of <u>H</u>usayn and `Ali is my creed <br>If I got killed this day, this is my hope <br>and this is what I see and shall meet my deed</p></center>  
 <p>So they broke his two arms and he was taken a prisoner, and Shimr took him to Ibn Sa`d, and Ibn Sa`d said to him: woe to you!  O Náfi` what made you do that with yourself? He replied: my Lord knows better what I wanted, and the blood was going down on his beard and his face and then he said: I've killed 12 men from you adding to that those I've injured and if I had an arm left you wouldn't be able to capture me, then Shimr took his sword out to kill him and Náfi` said to him: by Allah if you were a muslim it would be so horriblefor you to meet Allah with our blood, so praise be to Allah that He made our deaths by the most devilish creatures of His creations, and then Shimr killed him. <br>Then, Jawn [not John] the slave of Abá Ðar Al-Ghifári raised up and he was a black slave, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to him: you have my permission to stay away, you've followed us for goodness so don't be troubled in our own way, so he said: O son of the prophet of Allah (PUH) I lick your dishes in the good times, and in adversity I shall let you down? Then by Allah my smell shall be disgusting! and my ancestry shall be the most devilish! And verily my color shall be black! So, breath on me from the paradise, thus my smell would be the nicest and my ancestry shall be the best! And my face shall be the whitest! No by Allah, I shall never leave you until this black blood get mixed with your own bloods, and then he raised up and said: </p><center> 
 <p>How do the disbelievers see the beats of the black <br>by the sword I beat defending the Household of Mo<u>h</u>ammed <br>I shall protect them by the tongue and by the hand <br>and seek the paradise later at the day of judgement</p></center>  
 <p>Then he battled until he got killed, and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) stood up and said: Allahoma, make his face white! And turn his smell into good! and make him with the faithful, and make him meet the Household of Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH). <br>Then one man after the other from the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) used to come to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and say: peace upon you O son of the prophet of Allah, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) would say: and peace upon you and we shall be behind you, and then say: Some of them have paid their vow by death (in battle), and some of them still are waiting. So, until all of them were killed and only Al-<u>H</u>usayn was left with his family only and they are the children of `Ali (PUH) and the sons of Ja`far (PUH) [the brother of imam `Ali], and the sons of `Aqeel (PUH) [the brother of imam `Ali], and the sons of imam Al-<u>H</u>asan (PUH) [the brother of imam Al-<u>H</u>usayn], and the sons of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), so they gathered together to pay farewell for each other, and decided to fight, and they were 17 men and some say there were more. <br>Then `Ali ben Al-<u>H</u>usayn Al-Akbar (PUH) raised up, and his mother was Laylá bent Abi-Morrah ben `Urwah ben Mas`ood, and her mother was Maymoonah bent Abi Sufyán ben <u>H</u>arb, and he was one with a bright face and people never see like him, and had the nicest manners and his age was 18 and some say it was 25, and he was married and was a target for poets, and some said about him </p><center> 
 <p>The eye never saw someone like him <br>who walks with bare foot and with sandals <br>I mean the son of Laylá the noble <br>I mean the son of the daughter of the great lineages <br>This life is nothing for his faithfulness <br>and never give the truth in change of the false</p></center>  
 <p>Then he asked for his father's permission to fight, and he gave him the permission and then looked at him a look of someone despaired of him, and then he closed his eyes and cried, and then raised his index finger to the sky and said: Allahoma, testify over them that they are fighting a young man who is the most like of the prophet in shape and manners and in speech, and whenever we liked to see Your prophet we would look at him. Allahoma, forbid them the blesses of the earth and separate them into bands and tear them severely, and make them torn into groups and never make the viceroys satisfied with them, for they called us to nourish us and then they've been aggressive towards us to fight us. <br>Then he shouted: O Ibn Sa`d, may Allah cut off your lineage and may He never bless you in your matters and may He appoint someone to kill you after me while you're on your bed, like the way you cut off my lineage and did not save my closeness from the prophet of Allah (PUH). <br>Then he raised his voice and said: Lo! Allah preferred Adam and Noah and the Family of Abraham and the Family of 'Imran above (all His) creatures. They were descendants one of another. Allah is Hearer, Knower. <br>Then `Ali attacked the crowds and he was saying: </p><center> 
 <p>I am `Ali ben Al-<u>H</u>usayn ben `Ali <br>we and the House of Allah are better for the prophet <br>by Allah the son of the bastard shall not rule us <br>and I shall strike with the sword defending my father <br>like the strikes of a hashimite, an `Alawite</p></center>  
 <p>Then he attacked them and then returned back to his father and said: O father, the thirst killed me and the heaviness of the iron made me exhausted, any way for a sip of water? Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) cried and said: Alas! any help! O son, from where should I get the water? Fight a little for you will see your grandfather Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH) in a while, and he shall make you drink from his abundant cup such a drink that you will never become thirsty at all. Then he started to fight one time after the other and the kufans were avoiding killing him, and then Morrah ben Monqið Al-`Abdi looked him and said: may the burdens of Arabs be over my back if he did what he is doing and passed me by and I wouldn't bereave his mother! Then he passed by attacking the crowds like he used to do and Morrah ben Monqið blocked his way and hit him and some say he stabbed him with a spear and killed him, and then he called: O father peace upon you, this is my grandfather saying peace upon you and asking you to come in a hurry (to us), and then the people surrounded him and cut him with their swords, and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) came until he stood over his body and said: may Allah kill the people who killed you O son, how dare are they against the Merciful and for attacking the Household of the prophet; verily life after you is nothing. Then Zaynab bent `Ali (PUH) [the sister of Al-<u>H</u>usayn] went out calling: Alas! my beloved! Alas! the son of my brother! She came and dropped herself down over him, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) came to her and took her hand and turned her back to the tent, and then called his sons and asked them to carry their brother from his place of death, until they put him in front of the tent that they were fighting in front of it. <br>Then, `Abdullah ben Muslim ben `Aqeel ben Abi <u>T</u>álib, and his mother was Roqayyah bent `Ali ben Abi <u>T</u>álib, he raised up and said: </p><center> 
 <p>Today I shall meet Muslim and he is my father <br>and some men that were killed before the prophet's religion <br>They are not some people that were some liars <br>but the best of people and the best of lineage <br>from Háshim the masters and people of the ancestry</p></center>  
 <p>So he killed some people in 3 campaigns, and then Zayd ben Warqá' shot an arrow at him and he received with his hand, and it got hanged to his forehead and he couldn't remove it from his forehead, and then he said: Allahoma, they let us down and humiliated us, so kill them like they killed us, and then he shot another arrow at him, and another man stabbed him with his spear in the heart, and so he died peace upon him. <br>Then Mo<u>h</u>ammed ben Muslim ben `Aqeel (PUH) raised up and fought until he got killed. He was killed by Abu-Jorhom Al-Azdi and Laqee<u>t</u> ben Yásir Al-Johani. <br>Then Mo<u>h</u>ammed ben Abi-Sa`eed ben `Aqeel (PUH) raised and fought until he got killed. He was killed by Laqee<u>t</u> ben Yásir Al-Johani by an arrow. <br>Then Ja`far ben `Aqeel (PUH) raised while saying: </p><center> 
 <p>I am the man from <u>T</u>álib <br>from people of Háshim and Ghálib <br>We are truely the masters of honor <br>and this is Al-<u>H</u>usayn the best of the best <br>From the Household of the faithful and the victorious</p></center>  
 <p>So he killed 15 knights and two men, and then he got killed by `Abdulláh ben `Urwah Al-Khath`imi. <br>Then `Abdul-Ra<u>h</u>mán ben `Aqeel (PUH) raised while saying: </p><center> 
 <p>My father is `Aqeel so know my place <br>in Háshim and Háshim are my brothers <br>Old men of truth and the masters of their likes <br>This is Al-<u>H</u>usayn like the greatest structures <br>And the master of the old men with the youth</p></center>  
 <p>So he killed 17 knights, and then `Uthmán ben Khálid Al-Johani with Bishr ben Saw<u>t</u> attacked him and killed him. <br>Then `Abdullah Al-Akbar ben `Aqeel (PUH) raised up and fought fiercely and then got killed by `Uthmán ben Khálid Al-Johani with Bishr ben Saw<u>t</u>. <br>Then Mo<u>h</u>ammed ben `Abdulláh ben Ja`far ben Abi <u>T</u>álib (PUH) and his mother was Al-Khaw<u>s</u>á' who was from the tribe of Tayyim Al-Lát ben Tha`labah, he raised up and said: </p><center> 
 <p>Verily I complain to Allah from the aggression <br>(I am) the killer of people that are blind in the war <br>They departed the meanings of the Quran <br>and the revealed laws and teachings <br>And showed the disbelieving and the agression</p></center>  
 <p>Then he fought until he killed 10 of them, then he was attacked by `Ámir ben Nahshal Al-Tamimi and got killed. <br>Then his brother `Awn ben `Abdulláh ben Ja`far (PUH) and his mother was Zaynab the daughter of the prince of the believers (PUH) raised up and said: </p><center> 
 <p>If you deny me verily I am the son of Ja`far <br>the martyr of the truth and in paradise he blossoms <br>He shall fly in it with a green wing <br>this is enough for pride at the day of judgement</p></center>  
 <p>Then he fought until he killed 3 knights and 18 men, and then was attacked by `Abdulláh ben Qo<u>t</u>bah and got killed. <br>Then Al-Qásim ben Al-<u>H</u>asan ben `Ali ben Abi <u>T</u>álib (PUT) raised up, and he was a young kid, and when Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) saw him raising up to fight, he hugged him and both of them cried until then fell into coma. Then he asked his uncle for a permission to fight, but he denied to do so, and the kid kept kissing his hands and his feet until he decided to give a permission for him, so he went out and his tears upon his cheeks and said: </p><center> 
 <p>If you deny me then I am the son of Al-<u>H</u>asan <br>the grandson of the prophet the chosen and the entrusted <br>This is <u>H</u>usayn like the prisoner who kept as a hostage <br>among people that shall not be watered by the clouds</p></center>  
 <p>And he fought bitterly, and he killed despite his young age 35 men. <u>H</u>ameed ben Muslim said: a kid went out towards us and his face was like the moon, and there was a sword in his hand, and wearing a shirt and a cloth on his loin and sandals in his feet, and the tie of one of his sandals was cut and I don't forget that it was the left, and then `Amr ben Sa`d ben Nofayl Al-Azdi said to me: the burdens of Arabs shall be on my back if I didn't bereave his uncle Al-<u>H</u>usayn when he passes me by doing this, and I said: sanctified is Allah, and what do you want by that? by Allah if he beat me I shall not raise my hand towards him! Leave him alone, those who surround him are enough, and he replied: by Allah I shall attack him. Then he attacked him and hit his head with the sword and killed him, and the kid fell down to the ground on over his face and shouted: O uncle! And Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) showed up like the hawk and attacked like the angry lion and hit `Amr ben Sa`d ben Nofayl with the sword and he received it with his elbow and it was amputated and screamed out loud that all the camp heard him, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) turned away from him and the kufans came to rescue him but the horses stepped over `Amr with their hooves until he died, and the dust cleared out and there was Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) standing over the head of the kid while he was striking with his legs while Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) was saying: Far be they those people who killed you, and those whose their opponent about you is your grandfather and your father.  Then he (PUH) said: it is hard for your uncle not to call him and he wouldn't respond or respond and no voice would help you, by Allah there are many of his killers and so few are his nourishers. Then he took him and put his chest over his chest and like I can see the legs of the kid touching the ground, and he took him until he put him down with his son `Ali Al-Akbar and the rest of the dead from his own family. Then he said: Allahoma make them few in numbers and kill them to their last and never leave single on of them, and when I asked about the kid they told me: this is Al-Qásim ben Al-<u>H</u>asan ben `Ali ben Abi <u>T</u>álib (PUH). <br>Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) shouted in that situation: O patience children of my brothers, O patience O people of my Household, by Allah you shall not see a humiliating day ever after this day. <br>Then Abu-Bakr ben Al-<u>H</u>asan ben `Ali ben Abi <u>T</u>álib (PUH) raised up and fought until he got killed. He was shot by an arrow by `Abdulláh ben `Uqbah Al-Ghanawi and some say <u>H</u>armalah ben Káhil. <br>Then the brothers of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) raised up desiring to die before him! The first to raise was: Abu-Bakr ben `Ali ben Abi <u>Tá</u>lib and his name was `Ubaydilláh and his mother was Laylá bent Mas`ood, from the tribe of Nahshal. So he advanced while saying: </p><center> 
 <p>My sheik is `Ali of the longest proud lineage <br>from Háshim he is, of the truth and the grace <br>This is <u>H</u>usayn the son of the prophet who was sent <br>and we shall protect him with the sharp swords <br>My life shall be ransom for him O what a brother of mine</p></center>  
 <p>Then he fought until he got killed by Zajr ben Badr Al-Nakh`ee. <br>Then his brother `Umar ben `Ali (PUH) raised after him while saying: </p><center> 
 <p>I shall beat you without any mercy <br>that bastard verily he disbelieved the prophet <br>O Zijr O Zijr come closer to `Umar <br>verily you'll meet today the hell of Saqar <br>[Saqar is one of the names of hell]</p></center>  
 <p>Then he attacked Zijr the killer of his brother and he killed him. Then he received the crowds and started to beat them with his sword bitterly while saying: </p><center> 
 <p>Go away O enemies of Allah go away from `Umar <br>go away from the lion that crushes and frawns <br>Shall strike you with the sword and never run away <br>and not in war like the coward that returns</p></center>  
 <p>So he kept fighting until he got killed, may the peace of Allah be upon him. <br>Then Mo<u>h</u>ammed Al-A<u>s</u>ghar ben `Ali ben Abi <u>T</u>álib (PUH) raised up, and he was shot by an arrow by a man from Tameem, from the children of Abán ben Dárim, so he killed him and brought his head. <br>Then `Abdulláh ben `Ali (PUH) raised up and his mother was Laylá bent Mas`ood from Nahshal, and he fought until he got killed. <br>Then when Al-`Abbás ben `Ali (PUH) saw the large number of deads among his family he said to his brothers by his father and mother and they are: `Abdulláh and Ja`far and `Uthmán and their mother was Um-Albaneen bent Khálid ben <u>H</u>ozám from the tribe of Kiláb, and her original name was Fatima, he said to them: O children of my mother, advance so I can see you in good for the sake of Allah and His prophet. <br>Then `Abdulláh ben `Ali (PUH) raised and he was 25 years old and was saying: </p><center> 
 <p>I am the son of him of the help and the virtues <br>that is `Ali the good, the one of the deeds <br>The sword of the prophet of Allah that is fierce <br>every day verily is showing his fierce deeds</p></center>  
 <p>Then he fought with Háni ben Thobayt Al-<u>H</u>adhrami and he got killed by Háni. <br>Then after him his brother Ja`far ben `Ali (PUH) raised up while saying: </p><center> 
 <p>I am Ja`far one of the high places <br>the son of `Ali the good man of the deeds <br>My ancestry by my uncle and my (motherly) uncle is the proudest</p></center>  
 <p>Then he was attacked by Háni ben Thobayt Al-<u>H</u>adhrami as well and he killed him and brought his head, and some say he was shot by Khiwallá on his head or in his eye. <br>Then his brother `Uthmán ben `Ali raised up and took the place of his brothers and he was 21 years old and he was saying: </p><center> 
 <p>Verily I am `Uthmán the one of the pride <br>my sheik is `Ali the one of the purified deeds <br>This is <u>H</u>usayn the kindest of the kindest <br>and the master of the great men and the humbles <br>After the prophet he is the viceroy and the nourisher</p></center>  
 <p>Then Khiwallá ben Yazeed Al-A<u>s</u>ba<u>h</u>i shot an arrow at his forehead and he fell down from his horse and then a man from the tribe of Abán ben Dárim came and killed him and beheaded him. <br>Then after them, their brother Al-`Abbás (PUH) raised up and he was the eldest and as 34 years old and his title was Abul-Fadhl, and was called also "The Water Bringer" and "The Moon of The Hashimites" and he was the owner of the banner of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), and he was handsome and pretty with a huge body, if he rode the horse, his legs would touch he ground, and he was the last one to stay with Al-<u>H</u>usayn, so he asked for a permission from his brother A-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) to fight, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to him: O my brother, you are owner of my banner, and Al-`Abbas (PUH) said: my chest is getting narrow and I want to take the revenge from those hypocrites, and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said: then, go and bring some water for these children. Then Al-`Abbás when to the crowds and warned them against the wrath of the Almighty but that was not useful! Then he got back to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) to tell him what happened, but he heard the children shout: the thirst! the thirst! So he took his horse and took the skin (for water) and reached Al-Forát, and then he was surrounded by 4 thousands and they started shooting arrows at him but he didn't care about their gatherings and was not afraid of their numbers and he said: </p><center> 
 <p>I am the who is known by the fierce shout <br>known as the son of `Ali, who is called <u>H</u>aydarah</p></center>  
 <p>And he turned them away from the banks and then he got into the water and took a sip in his hand to drink, but he remembered the thirst of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), so he dropped the water from his hand and said: </p><center> 
 <p>O my soul be lowered down after Al-<u>H</u>usayn <br>and after him you shall not ever be <br>This is Al-<u>H</u>usayn the drinker of the death <br>and you want to drink the cold water? <br>by Allah this is not the deeds of my creed <br>and not the deeds of a man of true belief</p></center>  
 <p>Then he filled the skin with water and headed to the camp and they blocked his way, so he started to beat them and say: </p><center> 
 <p>I am not afraid of death if death shows up <br>until I get buried by the sharpened swords <br>I am Al-`Abbás and I shall go with the water <br>and I am not afraid of the evil at battles <br>And my soul shall be a shield for the purified grandson of the prophet</p></center>  
 <p>Then he turned them away from his way, and Zayd ben Warqá' Al-Johani hided behind a palm tree, and struck him on his right hand and amputated it, so he took the sword with his left hand and attacked while saying: </p><center> 
 <p>By Allah if you cut my right <br>verily I shall protect my creed forever <br>And defend an imam truthful in belief <br>the son of the prophet, the purified and the entrusted</p></center>  
 <p>Then <u>H</u>akeem ben <u>T</u>ofayl hided behind a palm tree, and struck him on his left and amputated it, so he hugged the banner to his chest and said: </p><center> 
 <p>O my soul don't be afraid of the disbelievers <br>and be glad with the mercy of the Almighty <br>With the prophet, the chosen master <br>by their sinful manners they cut off my left <br>So my Lord make them feel the fire of hell</p></center>  
 <p>Then they gathered around him and the arrows arrived at him like the rain, and one arrow struck the skin and the water poured down, and another one struck his chest and another one struck his eye, and then a man struck him with a pillar on his head and he fell down to the ground while calling: peace upon you from me O Abá `Abdilláh, and some say that he said: peace upon you from me O Abá `Abdillah, help me O brother. <br>And then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) came to him and saw his both hands amputated and thickened with injuries, and then he bent over him and cried out loud and said: now verily my backbone had been broken and my tricks are not much to be done. <br>Then he attacked the enemies and struck them right and left and all of them escaped before him like the goat that escapes from the wolf, while he was saying: to where are you escaping and you killed my brother? where to you escape and you've killed my helper, until he turned the enemies away from Abul-Fadhl, and while Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) was sitting beside his brother Al-`Abbás, his (Al-`Abbás') soul got released and Al-<u>H</u>usayn left him at that place. <br>Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn stood up and went back to the camp with a broken back and sadness and crying, and cleaning his tears from his eyes with his sleeves, and then Sokaynah [his daughter] came to him and asked about her uncle (Al-`Abbás), and he told her that he got killed, and Zaynab heard him saying that so she shouted: Alas! my brother! Alas! `Abbás! Alas! how are we lost after you! And the women cried and Al-<u>H</u>usayn cried with them and said: Alas! how are we lost after you! And when Al-`Abbás got killed, Al-<u>H</u>usayn looked around and so no one that would nourish him, and he looked at his family and his companions and they were all butchered like the sheeps, while he was hearing the women and children cry out loud, and then he called out loud: any one that would nourish the Household of the prophet (PUH)? Any believer that would fear Allah for us? Any helper that likes to meet Allah by helping us? Any helper that likes what Allah has for him for helping us? And the voices of the women raised with crying. <br>Then he went to the enterance of the tent and said to Zaynab: give me my infant to pay him the farewell, and they brought him his son `Abdulláh, and his mother was Al-Rabáb bent Imri' Al-Qays Al-Kalbi, so he took him and put him in his lap and bent over him to kiss him, but <u>H</u>armalah ben Káhil Al-Asdi shot him with an arrow that got into his neck and killed him, and then he said to Zaynab: take him, and he took the blood with his hand and when it was full he threw the blood towards the sky [and some say no drop came down to earth] and said: (O Allah) make it easy for me what happened with him verily it is under the eyes of Allah, Allahoma don't let him be lower in value than Fa<u>s</u>eel [the breed of the camel of the prophet <u>S</u>álih. Check the prophets in islamic literature]. Then he carried him and put him with the dead people of his Household, and some say that he dug a grave for him by the edge of his sword and buried him there. <br>Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) advanced toward the crowds and raising his sword and despaired of life and called the people for a combat, and he killed everyone that met him, until he killed so many of them. Then he attacked the right wing and said: </p><center> 
 <p>To be killed is better than being ashamed <br>and the shame is better than going to hell <br>by Allah this and that are not my companions</p></center>  
 <p>Then he attacked the left wing and said: </p><center> 
 <p>I am Al-<u>H</u>usayn ben `Ali <br>I've sworn not to bend <br>I shall protect the children of my father <br>and go on with the way of the prophet</p></center>  
 <p>some narrators said: by Allah, we've never seen a bereaved man that lost all his children and his Household and his companion in his likes of bravery, by Allah I've never seen one like him before or after him, and when the men gather around him to attack he would strike them with his sword and make them tear away from his right and left like the goat that is attacked by the wolf! He was attacking them and their numbers completed the 30 thousands and all of them are defeated before like the locusts and then he would return to the center and say: verily there is no power except by Allah. <br>When Shimr saw that, he ordered the knights to be at the back of the foot soldiers and then ordered the archers to shoot at him and so they did until his shield became like a hedgehog, and then Shimr came with some fellows and blocked the way between him and his harem! Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) shouted: woe to you! O followers of Abu-Sufyán, if you have no religion and were not afraid of the judgement day then be free in this life and turn back to your ancestries if you were Arabs as you claim, then Shimr called him and said: what are you saying O son of Fatima? Then he replied: I say, I am fighting you and you are fighting me and the women have no guilt, so turn away your ignorant people and your tyrants and don't let them attack my harem as long I am alive. Then Shimr said: you've got that O son of Fatima, and then he shouted: stay away from the harem of the man and point at him directly, by my life he is a graceful man! So they pointed at him for fighting and Shimr was stirring up the people to fight Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), and they attacked him and he would attack them back and they turn away from his way, and he was asking for a drop of water but couldn't find any. <br>Then he attacked in the direction of Al-Forát, against `Amr ben Al-<u>H</u>ajjáj with 4 thousands men, and he exposed them away from the water, and got into the water with the horse, and when the horse started to drink, Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said: you are thirsty and I am thirsty and I shall not drink until you drink, and horse raised his head up like if he understood the talk! Then when Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) extended his arm to drink the water, a man called him and said: do you drink the water while your harem is exposed? Then he dropped the water and didn't drink and heading to the tent (to protect his harem), and then he (PUH) got back to fight the enemies of Allah and remained in the fight until he was injured with 72 injuries. Then he stood to take a rest and he was weak to continue fighting, and while he was standing, Abul-<u>H</u>otoof Al-Jo`fi threw a stone t him, and some say with an arrow, and it hit his forehead, so he took a cloth to clean the blood from his forehead, and while doing so a poisoned arrow with three heads arrived into his heart! Then he (PUH) said: by the name of Allah and by Allah, and on the way of the prophet of Allah, then he raised his head to the sky and said: O my Lord, verily You know that they are killing a man that has no likings on earth, and then he took the arrow and got him out from his back and the blood gushed out like the rain! The blood gushing made him exhausted so he sat on the ground and turning his neck around, and in that situation, Málik ben Al-Nisr Al-Kindi came to him and cursed him and hit his honorable head with the sword, and there was a cloak over his head, and the cloak got filled with blood, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH): may you never eat with your hand neither drink, and may Allah gather you with the wrong people, and then he threw the cloak away and put his hood. <br>And in that situation, `Abdulláh ben Al-<u>H</u>asan (PUH) got out and he was a lad of 11 years, and he went to his uncle Al-<u>H</u>usayn, and Zaynab then went after him to keep him away, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to her: O my sister keep him away, but the lad denied fiercely and came to his uncle Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and stood beside him and said: I shall not leave my uncle, then Ba<u>h</u>r ben Ka`b wanted to wind his sword to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and the lad said to him: woe to you! O son of the bad woman! you want to kill my uncle! Then Ba<u>h</u>r ben Ka`b struck him with the sword and he received it with his hand and it was amputated to the skin and remained hanged up, and the kid called: Alas! my uncle! or Alas! O my mother! And then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) took him and hugged him to his chest and said: O son of my brother be patient for the adversities that befell upon you and wait for the goodness, for verily Allah will make you follow your good fathers and the prophet of Allah (PUH) and `Ali (PUH) and <u>H</u>amzah and Ja`far and Al-<u>H</u>asan (PUT), and then <u>H</u>armalah ben Káhil threw at him an arrow and killed him in the lap of his uncle, and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) raised his hand and said: Allahoma forbid them the rains of the skies and forbid them the blessings of the earth, Allahoma if you made them live for a while then let them be separated severely and make them tear apart in bands, and never make their rulers be satisfied with them, for they have invited us to support us and then attacked us to kill us. <br>Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) remained on the ground for some time although they could have killed him, but every tribe was depending on the other and hated to do so. <br>Hilál ben Náfi` said: I was standing with the fellows of `Umar ben Sa`d when a caller shouted: O be happy prince, this is Shimr killed Al-<u>H</u>usayn, so I went out between the two rows and took a look at him and I've seen him protecting himself, and by Allah, I've never seen a man that got dipped in his blood that would be better than him, and no one with a face brighter than his, and I was busy looking at the halo of his face and the beauty of his shape and didn't think of killing him, and while he was in that situation he asked for water, and I heard a man saying: by Allah you shall not drink the water until you go to hell and drink from its fire, and I heard him reply: I shall go to hell and drink of its fire? No by Allah, I shall go to my grandfather the prophet of Allah (PUH) and shall live with him in his own home in a firmly established in the favour of a Mighty King, and I shall drink a water that is not dirty and I shall complain to him about you've done to me, and all of them got angry like if Allah never planted anything of mercy in their hearts. <br>Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) raised his hand to the sky and said: Allahoma, O You of the High Place, of the Mighty Power, of the Great Wisdom, not in need of the creatures, and high in His Pride, verily You are Able for whatever You desire, close in mercy, and true with the promise, and Graceful with His favors, and a Tester of goodness, close whenever You are called, and surrounding whatever You have created, and verily You accept the repenting for those who repent, and verily You are Able for what You desire, and verily You get whatever You want, Thankful if You have been praised, and You mention those who mention You, and I pray to You for my need, and ask You for my necessity, and go toward You when I am afraid and cry for my adversities, and I seek help from You when I am weak, and I depend on You when I am satisfied, Allahoma, judge between us and between those people for they have tricked us and let us down and betrayed us and killed us, and we are the Household of Your prophet, and the children of Your beloved Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH), the one who You have chosen him for the Message, and made him to receive the inspirations, so make for us, O Lord, a relief from our matter O You the most Merciful of all. Patience over what You have destined O Lord, no other god but You, O Helper of those who need the help. <br>Then Shimr shouted at the knights and the foot soldiers: woe to you! what do you wait from the man? Kill him may your mothers be bereaved, and so they attacked him from all the sides and Zor`ah ben Shorayk hit him on his left shoulder, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) hit Zor`ah and killed him. Then another man hit him on his holy shoulder with his sword and made him fall on his face, and he was sitting. Then he started to stand up and fall down, and then Sinán ben Anas Al-Nakh`ee stabbed him in his throat and took the spear out and stabbed him in his chest, and threw him with an arrow into his neck, so he then fell down and sat on the ground and took the arrow out from his neck and started to collect the blood with his hands and whenever they were full he would paint his head and his beard with it while saying: this is how shall I meet Allah, painted with blood and my rights have been taken. <br>Then `Umar ben Sa`d said to Sinán ben Anas: get down woe to you! go to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and make him rest, and then Sinán said to Khiwallá ben Yazeed: go and behead him, and Khiwallá went to do so but he got weakened and shocked, so Sinán said to him and some say Shimr said to him: may Allah disolve you arms, why are you shaking? Then Sinán got down and some say it was Shimr and he killed him and amputated his holy head while saying: I behead you and I know you are the master and the son of the prophet of Allah and the best of people from mother's and father's side, and then he gave the head to Khiwallá and said to him: take it to the prince `Umar ben Sa`d. <br>Then the crowds came to steal whatever he (PUH) had, thus his shirt was taken by Is-<u>h</u>áq ben Khawiyyah Al-Hadhrami, and his pants were taken by Ba<u>h</u>r ben Ka`b and his turban was taken by Al-Akhnas, and his shield was taken by `Umar ben Sa`d, and his clothes were taken by a brother of Is-<u>h</u>áq ben Khawiyyah, and his velvet was taken by Qays ben Al-Ash`ath ben Qays, and his cloak was taken by Málik ben Nisr, and his sword was taken by Al-Faláfis Al-Nahshali from the tribe of Dárim, and his sandals were taken by Al-Aswad ben Khálid, and his ring was taken by Bajdal ben Saleem Al-Kalbi who amputated the finger with the ring.
