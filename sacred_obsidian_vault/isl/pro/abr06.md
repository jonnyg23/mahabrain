 Ishmael (PUH) and His Mother Hagar to The Holy House<br>
 </small></small></small></a></big></big></big></small></small></small></big></big></big></big></big></big>
 <div style="text-align: left;">&lt;&gt;<big><small>It is mentioned that
 Abraham
 used to live in the deserts of the lands of Shem, then when he was
 given Ishmael (PUH) from Hagar, theit matter became so heavy on Sarah
 and she had been sad for this since she didn't have any children, so
 Abraham complaint about this to God, so then God inspired unto him and
 ordered him to move Ishmael and his mother away from her, so then he
 said: O God where to? and to what place? So He said: to My place. Then
 God got down Gabriel with Al-Burâq [Al-Burâq: in Islamic
 believes, it is a heavenly creature created of light and by which the
 prophet Muhammad (PUH) was able to travel to Jerusalem and then to
 heavens in one night. Tidings about this event are mentioned in the
 beginning of the chapter of Al-Isrâ', which means "The Night
 Journey"], so it carried them with Hagar to the place of God, and
 Abraham used to say whenever they pass by a place with trees palms ,
 used to say t Gabriel: O Gabriel in here? And he answeres him back: go
 ahead, until they reached Mecca and put them in the place of the House
 (Kaaba), so when they settled down in that place there were some trees
 there and so Hagar and the others sat in the shadow of one of them, and
 when Abraham wanted to leave Hagar said to him: O Abraham, are going to
 leave us in a place that has no one around nor water or plants? So then
 said Abraham: the One that ordered me to put you here will be enough
 for you, and then he left them, but before leaving that spot he turned
 his face towards them and said to God as it is mentioned in quran: </small></big><a name="014_037">Our Lord! Lo! I have settled some of my posterity in
 an uncultivable valley near unto Thy holy House, our Lord! that they
 may establish proper worship; so incline some hearts of men that they
 may yearn toward them, and provide Thou them with fruits in order that
 they may be thankful(Ibrahim:37). Then Hagar stayed with her son
 Ishmael (PUH), and when it was noon time, Ishmael became thirsty and
 asked for water from his mother, so then Hagar wandered in the valley
 and called: is there anyone in the valley? Then Ishmael disappeared,
 then she went over Al-Safâ [Mountain's name] and she saw a mirage
 in the valley and she thought it was water so she came down and
 approached it, so when she reached Al-Marwâ [the name of the
 passage in the valley] then Ishmael disappeared from her sight and then
 she saw a mirage in the position of Al-Safâ, and so on she did
 that for seven times, and on the seventh time and while she was on
 Al-Marwâ she looked to Ishmael (PUH) and water appeared under his
 feet, so she came back to him and gathered the sand around it because
 it was flowing and so she tightened the flow by gathering the sand
 around it and that is why it is called Zamzam [Arabic: Zam = tightened,
 strengthened. Literature]. The tribe of Jorhom at that time were
 settling in `Arafât [another mountain], so when the water
 appeared in Mecca and the birds and the rest of animals started to
 dwell around it they knew that there is some water and they followed
 them, until then they saw a woman and a boy settlled there under a tree
 and water appeared for both of them, so they said to Hagar: who are you
 and what is wrong with you and with this boy? So she said: I am the
 mother of the son of Abraham the friend of God and this is his son, so
 they said to her: do you allow us to be near you? So then she took the
 permission from Abraham because he used to visit them by any chance he
 had, so then Abraham allowed them and the tribe of Jorhom settled down
 near them, thus Hagar and Ishmael didn't stay alone, and on the third
 time when Abraham checked them and saw many people around them he
 turned to be so glad for this. Then Ishmael grew up and every member of
 Jorhom's tribe gave them some camels and they used to make a living by
 them, and then when Ishmael turned to be a man, God ordered Abraham to
 build the House, so he asked: O God in which spot? So He answered back:
 in the spot that I revealed the dome over Adam, and the dome remained
 there even at the time of the flood at the time of Noah (PUH) and when
 the whole earth was sunk down, God uplifted this dome and so she was
 called the Saved House because it was saved from sinking [Saved House,
 in Arabic: Al-Bayt Al-`Ateeq].<br>
