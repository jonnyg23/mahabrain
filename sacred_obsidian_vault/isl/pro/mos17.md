 <center><font size="+3">Moses Only Wanted to Get Them Into The Holy Lands</font></center>
 When the folks of Moses asked him to have fine living conditions and said
 to him that they cannot get patience toward one type of food and to pray
 to his Lord to get them plants of the earth..etc, then Moses said to them:
 Would ye exchange that which is higher for that which is lower? Go down
 to settled country, thus ye shall get that which ye demand(Al-Baqarah:61),
 so they said to him: O Moses! Lo! a giant people (dwell) therein and lo!
 we go not in till they go forth from thence. When they go forth from thence,
 then we will enter (not till then)(Al-Mâ'idah:22). What is understood
 of the interpretations and reliable narrations is that when Moses went
 out of Egypt with the Israelites he had no wish but to get them into the
 holy lands, and it is the lands of Shem where Isaac and Jacob were born
 and where Abraham and Isaac and Jacob were buried and Joseph was moved
 to it later on (PUT), and there was Jethro [please read previous notes]
 and the household of Jethro and his honorable family, and it includes Palestine
 and bounded apparently by Iraq and Hijâz and Egypt and the mediterranean
 and it had lot of towns and active cities, so Moses went to these lands
 with his folks away from Egypt that they did not see in it except of the
 humiliation and torture for all the time they lived there after the death
 of Joseph (PUH), and it lasted for four hundred years almost, from the
 time of Joseph and the travel from Palestine to it (Egypt) to the time
 of Moses. We've mentioned before that when they went into it with Jacob
 at the time of Joseph they were around seventy in number, and they went
 out with Moses and they are six hundred thousand warriors added to the
 women and children as well.
 <br>All that time they were under the rule of the pharaohs, and the pharaoh
 of Moses is Al-Waleed Abi-Mus`ab ben Mu`âwiyah ben Abi-Nameer ben
 Al-Hilwâs the giant and he is the forth of them as we mentioned before,
 and he was the most tyrant of them all, so Moses wanted to get them out
 of this damned land and release them for the adversities that came over
 them in that land of wrong people to their own lands and the land of their
 grandfather, Abraham, by the commandment of their Lord, and their Lord
 called it the holy land and described it like this and made it a holy place
 when He ordered His friend Abraham to travel there, before Abraham and
 Lot and their households do so from the land of Iraq, so it was blessed
 with his travelling to it and it was the land of their graves and the homeland
 for the prophets and most of the messangers after them, so the books of
 Abraham and the Torah of Moses and the Psalms of David and the Gospel of
 Jesus, all were revealed there, so may peace of God be upon our prophet
 and his Household and on their owners (the holy books) and His greets.
 There also was founded the second of direction of prayer, the honorable
 house of Al-Aqsâ mosque, so it is the most honorable spot that God
 had made just second after Mecca and the mosque of His prophet (PUH) in
 Medina.
 <br>So, Moses wanted to release them from the slavery for the pharaohs
 and wanted their dignity, so he got them out of it in safe and God did
 destroy their enemy, and when he wanted to move with them to some country
 in the lands of Shem they denied to do so and said: there are giant people
 and we will not go there until they go out of it and we are not able to
 fight against them, so when he started to give his sermons and reminded
 them of the miracles that God did to him and they knew that he is serious
 about going into that holy land and live there, they said to him then:
 So go thou and thy Lord and fight! We will sit here(Al-Mâ'idah:24).
 <br>It is mentioned that when they did not agree with Moses to fight the
 giants, he decided to leave them so when he wanted to do so they realized
 what benefit they have for him to be between them and how much did he take
 care of them and found out that his presence is a mercy for them and a
 protection, so they got scared and said: if Moses went out the punishment
 surely will be revealed upon us, so then they gathered around him and asked
 him to live with them and ask God to fogive them so then God inspired to
 him: I forgive them for not going into the lands and I forbid it for them
 for forty years and they shall astray in the lands as a punishment for
 them for their saying to you: So go thou and thy Lord and fight! We will
 sit here. What is apparent, the land that God ordered them to get into
 to forgive them for their sins and the one that they will not reach for
 forty years is the same one that they got out from (Egypt) and it was a
 judgement for all so all of them got into forgiveness and made astray,
 for this they did say that they used to get up in the beginning of the
 night to get into Egypt and start to read Torah and when they reach the
 gates of Egypt the earth would rotate and get them back to their previous
 place, and the distance between them and Egypt, their previous homeland
 where their homes used to be, four leagues, so they stayed with this situation
 for forty years, and this is what is known as The Wandering, and it is
 mentioned that Aaron died during that time and also Moses, and after this
 period of time of forty years, their children and grandchildren got into
 the lands of Shem.
 <br>It is mentioned also that when Moses reached with them the holy lands
 after their repentance, he said to them: go into, but they denied to do
 so, so they got astrayed in four leagues for forty years, and one league
 is three miles and one mile is four thousand cubits as measured by the
 arm, so the total is twelve miles, forty eight thousand cubits, and apparently
 it seems that it was as measured by the arm-length of the arms of people
 at that time, and this is the destiny that they got astrayed with until
 all had died except of Yosha` ben Nun (Joshua ben Nun) and Kâlib
 ben Yofannâ (Caleb ben Jephunneh) the husband of Mariam (Mary) the
 daughter of Amram and the sister of Moses and Aaron [notice that she is
 not Mary the mother of Jesus] for they did not refuse any command for Moses
 the prophet of God.
 <br>Joshua is the viceroy of Moses and the leader after him, and he has
 honorable situations and wars with his enemies until God opened with him
 the lands, and God guided the people by him and more to come later on by
 God's will.
 <br>We've mentioned for you that when the Israelites were commanded by
 Moses to enter the holy lands and when they denied to do so they got astrayed
 in the lands for forty years in four leagues, and when the night used to
 come over them they all gather to travel so they go and travel until they
 reach their desired destination then God orders the earth to rotate and
 they all get back to their previous homes that they left travelling, so
 they stayed like this for forty years, and their supplies during these
 forty years composed of the manna and the quails, and we've mentioned before
 that most of them died during the Wandering and only few survived, and
 some of the survivors were Joshua ben Nun and Caleb ben Jephunneh the husband
 of Mary bent Amram the sister of Moses and Aaron that God favoured them
 with the strong faith, and the heritage of the prophecy was transformed
 from Moses to his viceroy Joshua ben Nun, and some of them was the stone
 that was with Moses and used to strike it with his staff so twelve springs
 would arise from it and each tribe has its own spring.
 <br>Truth is that the Israelites did not believe in Moses completely, otherwise
 they would have been fighting their enemies with him and obeyed him, but
 only few did believe in him, and it is mentioned that a jew man came to
 the prince of believers (`Ali ben Abi Tâlib) (PUH) and said: O father
 of Al-Hasan, you did not have patience after the death of your prophet
 except for twenty five years and then you started to kill each other [the
 jew man here trying to mock], he (PUH) then answered: true, but your feet
 were not yet dry of the sea until you said O Moses, Make for us a god even
 as they have gods, then he (PUH) said: we did not argue about our prophet
 but we argued in differences after him, so the prophet of Islam (PUH) had
 his folks under his command even though they refused his viceroy and his
 minister `Ali ben Abi Tâlib (PUH), but as for the Israelites they
 did refuse their prophet but went along with his viceroy Joshua ben Nun.
 <br>As attributed to Ibn-`Abbâs that he said: the Israelites said
 to Moses after passing the sea: tell us O Moses, by what power and tools
 shall we reach the holy lands and there are families and women and sick
 people and elders with you? Moses then said: I do not know any other nation
 that God made for it the heritage of earth as much as it is for you and
 God will help you, so they said then: so pray to Him to feed us and let
 us drink something and shade us against the sun, so then God inspired to
 Moses: I ordered the sky to rain on them the manna and quails and I ordered
 the wind to cook the quails for them and I ordered the stones to blow up
 with water and ordered the clouds to make shade for them..etc, so when
 Moses said that to them they believed in him and walked with him to the
 holy lands which was Palestine, and we've mentioned before that they stopped
 advancing and denied to go there so they kept wandering on earth for forty
 years in one corner of Sinai's desert, and then they entered there after
 forty years and they did not go there except by their repentance and God's
 forgiveness, and in a speech for Al-`Askari (PUH) about God's saying: Go
 into this township and eat freely of that which is therein, and enter the
 gate prostrate, and say: "Repentance." We will forgive you your sins and
 will increase (reward) for the right-doers(Al-Baqarah:58), that the township
 is Arihâ (Jericho), part of the lands of Shem and Palestine, and
 "enter the gate prostrate" was for the holiness of Muhammad and his viceroy
 (PUT) for God made an example like them on the gate of the town and God
 ordered them to prostrate for their holiness and to renew their covenant
 about believing in them and to remember their old covenant as well, and
 as for "say Repentance" it means say that our prostration for God is for
 the greatness of the example of Muhammad and `Ali and for our believe in
 their leadership is for the repentance and forgiveness for our sins, and
 this is had been told in many speeches as well, But those who did wrong
 changed the word which had been told them for another saying, so they did
 not prostrate for God and did not say what they were ordered to say, but
 went into the town in another way other than what it was supposed for them
 and said: a red wheat to be carried on our back is better for us than what
 we are ordered to do and say, so God said: and We sent down upon the evil-doers
 wrath from heaven for their evil-doing(Al-Baqarah:59).
 <br>It is mentioned that the wrath that was revealed upon them was the
 plague, so that in one day one hundred and twenty thousand men died, and
 they say that the ones that died are known in God's knowledgement that
 they are not believers in Muhammad and `Ali and their Household, and it
 is probable that He commanded them to prostrate at the gate of Repentance
 for this reason as He commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam as
 well before, and in both situations it was a test for His servants and
 setting holiness for Adam and the end of prophets and his viceroy (PUT),
 and from the speech of Al-`Askari (PUH) about God's saying: And when Moses
 asked for water for his people(Al-Baqarah:60), is that he (Moses) asked
 for water from God to his people after being thirsty in their wandering,
 so they went on crying to Moses and said to him: thirst doomed us, so Moses
 said to his Lord: O Lord, by the rights of Muhammad the master of prophets,
 and by the rights of `Ali the master of viceroys, and by the rights of
 Fâtimah the lady of all women, and by the rights of Al-Hasan the
 master of leaders and by the rights of Al-Husain the best of martyrs and
 by the rights of their descendants and their viceroys the righteous leaders,
 water Your servants, then God inspired to him: O Moses, strike with your
 staff the stone, and so he did and twelve springs gushed out of it and
 each tribe of them had one spring for its ownself so no one would annoy
 the other with drinking from the springs..etc.
 <br>As it is attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH) in a narration about the
 Awaited viceroy may our souls be a ransom for him: when the last viceroy
 (Al-Mahdi PUH) appears in Mecca and desires to go to Kufa a caller would
 call: has any one drinks or food? Then he (PUH) will carry with him the
 stone of Moses and it is carried by no less than a camel so at every stop
 he will stop a spring will show up from it, and whoever was hungry will
 get satsified and whoever was thirsty will drink as much as he wants, and
 it will be for their supplies until he (PUH) reached Kufa, which is the
 honorable Najaf now.
