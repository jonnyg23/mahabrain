 <center><font size="+3">The Nine Continuous Miracles by Moses (PUH)</font></center>
 It is probable that when the wizards fell prostrating because they believed
 in God that made Moses able to banish all their magic, and when they said:
 We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses, then people believed in Moses,
 so then Haman said to the pharaoh: people started to believe in Moses so
 watch out for everyone that got into his religion and put him in jail,
 so the pharaoh then put in jail everyone that believed in him of the Israelites,
 so then Moses came to him and said: release the Israelites, but he did
 not answer him and did not care about his saying and did not do so, so
 then God revealed at that year the flood which corrupted their homes and
 made them go into the desert and live in tents out there, so then the pharaoh
 said to Moses: pray to your God to give us a relief from the flood and
 I shall release the Israelites and your friends, and so did Moses and the
 flood was ended. The pharaoh was about to release the Israelites but Haman
 said to him: if you released the Israelites then Moses had defeated you
 and banished your kingdom, so the pharaoh accepted that suggestion and
 did not release the Israelites, and when he did not do what he promised,
 God revelaed upon them in the following year the locusts which ate everything
 they owned of plants and trees until it got into their homes and ate their
 food and got into their beds and in everything and so it is said it even
 got into their throats and their ears and their backs and all their bodies
 because it was of varied sizes, and the pharaoh got so scared because of
 this and took refuge into Moses and said to him: pray to your God to relief
 us from the locusts to release the Israelites and your friends, and so
 Moses did and the locusts left their lands, and when he did not release
 the Israelites, God revealed in the third year the vermin and it corrupted
 their agriculture and annoyed them and they got stroke by famine, so the
 pharaoh said to Moses: if you released us from the vermin I would release
 the Israelites, and so Moses did and the vermin disappeared from their
 lands, but the pharaoh did not verify his promise, so then God then sent
 to them the frogs that got into their foods and their drink, and they say
 that the pharaoh got so scared because of this and they asked Moses to
 relief them from this adversity and if he did so they would believe in
 him and send with him the Israelites, so when God released of that adversity
 they refused to release the Israelites for they thought that they would
 be left alone humiliating God's creations.
 <br>When they denied releasing the Israelites, God turned their Nile to
 blood so that the coptic man would see him as blood and drink it as blood
 and the Israelite man would see it as water and drink it as water, and
 they got scared even more than before and they knew that this is because
 of Moses and these are miracles following each other and he founds them
 by the permission of God and ends them by the permission of God and they
 were sure of it and found no way out but to take refuge at him and to release
 the Israelites from the jails and stop torturing them, and so when Moses
 did and they drank pure water again they did not fullfil their promise
 for Moses, so then God revealed upon them the pollution and it was the
 red snow and they did not see him before, and lot of them died because
 of their fear and they knew that if they kept being stubborn they would
 be destroyed and doomed with the worst of conditions so then the pharaoh
 decided to answer them for their requests and release the Israelites and
 said to Moses: Pray for us unto thy Lord, because He hath a covenant with
 thee. If thou removest the terror from us we verily will trust thee and
 will let the Children of Israel go with thee(Al-A`râf:134), so when
 God removed the terror [terror or pollution, the English translation for
 this Arabic word is not uniform in all parts of the Quran, sometimes it
 was called "pollution" and in some places it was called "terror"], he released
 the Israelites, and when he released them they gathered around Moses and
 he (Moses) went with them out of Egypt and everyone that fled away from
 the pharaoh got back to him (Moses) and the condition of Moses went greater
 and all the Israelites gathered around him from far and near lands, and
 all the Israelites moved out of Egypt with their elders and their women
 and their children, their healthy people and their ill people as well,
 and they got out of it their cattles and whatever they could carry and
 their servants followed them and the money owner went out with his money
 as well, so they did not keep anything that could be carried unless they
 carried it and left only empty houses with things that could not be carried,
 and there were some of them that were special because they could carry
 weapons and fight and thus the matter of Moses grew greater and when the
 pharaoh knew about it he got anxious about it so then Haman said to him:
 I told you not to release the Israelites but you did not listen to me,
 and the pharaoh had nothing to do but to be scared and anxious, so then
 he ordered his armies to gather together and prepare to chase Moses and
 start a war with him, and so he went out seeking Moses, and the front of
 his army was made of six hundred thousand men and his march was made of
 a thousand thousand knight (million), and when the two teams saw each other
 from afar and Moses got closer to the sea and the pharaoh was closer to
 Moses, the folks of Moses said:  Lo! we are indeed caught, then Moses
 said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me and save
 me from the tricks of the pharaoh and his tyranny, they say that Moses
 walked with his people to the sea and their fighters counted as much as
 six hundred and twenty thousand warriors with spears in their hands, and
 there no one among them that was seventy years old nor twenty years old,
 and Moses was at the end and Aaron was on the front.
 <br>And in a speech as attributed to Al-Kâðim (PUH) that includes
 that God commanded Moses to take with him the tomb of Joseph (PUH) with
 him from Egypt to the lands of Shem where his fathers Abraham and Isaac
 and Jacob (PUT) lie, so he did and it was kept in a box made of marble
 on the bank of the Nile and so he took it with him and he then buried him
 in Hebron with his fathers (PUT).
 <br>Then Moses went through the sea by the commandment of God with his
 brother Aaron and with Yosha` ben Nun (Joshua ben Nun) and his people,
 and God commanded him to strike the sea with his staff, and when he did
 so the sea split into two and each part was as mountain vast, and twelve
 road was splitted for him and there were twelve tribes with him so each
 tribe went into a road, and the water got as high as a mountain on the
 road sides by God's will and the roads got dry as if there were no water
 at all before by God's will as well and the sun rose upon it, and when
 Moses got into one road with his tribe and the rest of the tribes went
 after him and the water level was higher than their heads like mountains
 and the tribe that was with Moses got scared because of the water level
 and because they could not see the rest of the tribes and thought that
 they were dead so they asked Moses about them and said: where are our brothers
 of the Israelites? He said to them: they are with you on other roads, but
 they did not believe so for their extreme sadness for the rest of the Israelites,
 so when Moses knew about their dark thoughts he asked God to show them
 the rest of them so then God ordered the waters to be like aqueducts so
 that they can see each other and even talk to each other, and so the water
 between them was as God ordered, so how wonderful is His patience for His
 servants and how beautiful is His passion, and it was like aqueducts between
 them so that they could see and talk to each other, and they say that the
 road through the sea was one league, three miles, twelve thousands cubits,
 so sanctification be to Him for His power and how beautiful are His gifts
 for His weak servant that is busy away from his own Master.
 <br>Then came the pharaoh with his soldiers and when he reached the sea
 he said to his folks: don't you know that your god had made roads for you
 through the sea, but none of his folks dared to get into the roads and
 the horses kept away for the great height of the water levels, so when
 the pharaoh saw their hesitation and their fear to get into the roads he
 went first and wanted to pass over, but an astrologer said to him: do not
 pass, and he tried to fobid him from going through, but the pharaoh insisted
 and did not accept his opinion while no one dared to get through. Then
 the pharaoh went with his horse and it was a mighty horse but it denied
 going forward to one of the twelve roads, so then they say that Gabriel
 (PUH) went forward while riding in front of the pharaoh so that when the
 pharaoh saw him he went after him and went through the sea and then his
 folks went after him, so when all were going through and the folks of Moses
 were all out of the sea into the land, God then commanded the wind to strike
 the sea and it collapsed over the pharaoh and his folks and none was saved,
 and the folks of Moses were in safe, and when the water came down like
 mountains over the pharaoh and his people and he knew that he will be destroyed
 he said then: I believe that there is no Allah save Him in Whom the Children
 of Israel believe, and I am of those who surrender (unto Him)(Younus:90),
 and they say that when the pharaoh said the sentence of believing, Gabriel
 then had some water with his hand and put it into his mouth and said to
 him: What! Now! When hitherto thou hast rebelled and been of the wrong-doers?
 But this day We save thee in thy body that thou mayst be a portent for
 those after thee (Younus:91-92), and as for the folks of the pharaoh they
 went deep into the sea and then into hell, and as for the pharaoh, God
 made his body remain on the shores so that people would see him and know
 him and to be as a sermon for people coming then after and so people do
 not doubt about his death and they are the ones that made him a god, so
 God showed them his dead body on the shores so that they would learn.
 <br>God said in the chapter of Al-A`râf: And we straitened Pharaoh's
 folk with famine and dearth of fruits, that peradventure they might heed.
 But whenever good befell them, they said: This is ours; and whenever evil
 smote them they ascribed it to the evil auspices of Moses and those with
 him. Surely their evil auspice was only with Allah. But most of them knew
 not. And they said: Whatever portent thou bringest wherewith to bewitch
 us, we shall not put faith in thee. So We sent against them the flood and
 the locusts and the vermin and the frogs and the blood - a succession of
 clear signs. But they were arrogant and became a guilty folk. And when
 the terror fell on them they cried: O Moses! Pray for us unto thy Lord,
 because He hath a covenant with thee. If thou removest the terror from
 us we verily will trust thee and will let the Children of Israel go with
 thee. But when We did remove from them the terror for a term which they
 must reach, behold! they broke their covenant..etc(Al-A`râf:130-135).
 In the chapter of Al-Isrâ': And verily We gave unto Moses nine tokens,
 clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty). Do but ask the Children of Israel
 how he came unto them, then Pharaoh said unto him: Lo! I deem thee one
 bewitched, O Moses..etc(Al-Isrâ':101). In Al-A`râf also: Therefore
 We took retribution from them; therefore We drowned them in the sea: because
 they denied Our revelations and were heedless of them. And We caused the
 folk who were despised to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the
 western parts thereof which We had blessed. And the fair word of thy Lord
 was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of their endurance; and
 We annihilated (all) that Pharaoh and his folk had done and that they had
 contrived(Al-A`râf:136-137). In the chapter of Younus also: And We
 brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh with his hosts
 pursued them in rebellion and transgression, till, when the (fate of) drowning
 overtook him, he exclaimed: I believe that there is no God save Him in
 Whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of those who surrender (unto
 Him). What! Now! When hitherto thou hast rebelled and been of the wrong-doers
 ? But this day We save thee in thy body that thou mayst be a portent for
 those after thee. Lo! most of mankind are heedless of Our portents(Younus:90-93).
 In the chapter of Al-Shu`arâ': And We inspired Moses, saying: Take
 away My slaves by night, for ye will be pursued. Then Pharaoh sent into
 the cities summoners, (Who said): Lo! these indeed are but a little troop,
 And lo! they are offenders against us. And lo! we are a ready host. Thus
 did We take them away from gardens and watersprings, And treasures and
 a fair estate. Thus (were those things taken from them) and We caused the
 Children of Israel to inherit them. And they overtook them at sunrise.
 And when the two hosts saw each other, those with Moses said: Lo! we are
 indeed caught. He said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will
 guide me. Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite the sea with thy staff.
 And it parted, and each part was as a mountain vast. Then brought We near
 the others to that place. And We saved Moses and those with him, every
 one; And We drowned the others(Al-Shu`arâ':52-66).
