 <div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><big>Some Sentences About
 Sarah The Wife of Abraham As Told By Historians<br>
 </big></big></big>
 <div style="text-align: left;">Some historians gave some pictures about
 Abraham and his wife Sarah and what happened between her and Hagar with
 her son Ishmael (PUT) and about the reasons for Hagar and her son
 Ishmael travelling to Fârân (Paran) as in Torah, and Paran
 is a name given to some locations of which Mecca's mounts are one of
 them, and lot of these are not suitable for such a high place of
 prophecy and unjust, and even can not be commited by a conscious man
 and some of them are not right at all, but it has lot of exaggeration
 as mentioned in the book of Genesis in Torah, and most of such pictures
 are taken from jews and it has such matters that they report to Sarah
 the wife of Abraham (PUH) but it opposes the dignity and nobleness, and
 there is no doubt that for Muslims, Sarah is considered one of the best
 of women, and she is attached to the degree of infallibility, and for
 the prophet and his Household (PUT) she occupies a high leve, and for
 them she is like Eve the mother of human beings and like Mary the
 daughter of Amram (PUT), so she is a lady of her time and faithful
 souls do not accept to report about her and other women untrue things.
 They mentioned that when Sarah saw the son of Hagar that she gave birth
 to from Abraham, she said then to Abraham: banish this maid and her son
 for this maid's son will not inherit with my son Isaac, and they said:
 then God said to Abraham: Whatever Sarah says do. They say also: So
 Abraham went in the early morning and took with him bread and water and
 gave them to Hagar then she put them on her shoulder and her son with
 her, then he banished her with her son and she went along in the
 deserts lost and did not know where to go. They said a lot of such
 tidings and legends, but what we can say for the press that printed
 such lies and what we can say for its owner, but no strength except by
 God, the Exalted.<br>
 Yes, in Al-Bukhâri [Hadith collection made by Al-Bukhâri
 after the prophet's death] as reported by Ibn `Abbâs that the
 prophet (PUH) said in a speech that minds can accept and souls can
 refuge in, and some of it is that Abraham braught her (Hagar) with her
 son Ishmael and he was still an infant and he (Abraham) placed them
 near by the House over the location of Zamzam, and at that time there
 were no one in Mecca nor water, so he just put them there and gave them
 dates and water, then Abraham went back from where he came then the
 mother of Ishmael followed him and said: O Abraham where are you going
 and leaving us in this valley with no one alive or anything? She said
 that many times but he did not look at her, then she asked: God ordered
 you to do this? He said: yes, then she said: then we are not lost. Then
 she got back and Abraham went along until he reached a position that
 they can't see him, he faced the House and prayed with these words and
 raised his hands up to heaven and said: <a name="014_037">Our Lord!
 Lo! I have settled some of my posterity in an uncultivable valley near
 unto Thy holy House..etc(Ibrâhim:37), then the mother of Ishmael
 started breast feeding for Ishmael and drink of that water until it was
 all finished and she got thirsty and also her son and then she looked
 at him and saw him crooked so she hated that view and went along and
 she found Al-Safâ so she went to the top and looked at the valley
 that she might find someone but she did not, so she went down into the
 valley with so much tiredness until she passed the valley and came to
 Al-Marwâ and she went on top of it looking for someone, but she
 did not find anyone, and so she did that for seven times. He
 (Al-Bukhâari) said: said Ibn `Abbâs: the prophet (PUH)
 said: that is why people now walk between them for seven times [during
 the pilgrimage] then went she went to Al-Marwâ she heard a sound
 and she said: Shh! She then paid attention and she heard it clearly
 then she said: You've been heard, do you have any aid? Then she found
 an angel searching in the location of Zamzam by his feet (or by his
 wing) until the water appeared, so she started gathering the water. He
 (Al-Bukhâri) </a><a name="014_037">said: said Ibn `Abbâs:
 the prophet (PUH) said: Mercy be upon the mother of Ishmael, if she did
 not take of the water then Zamzam would be a drying-out spring, then
 the angel said to her: do not be afraid of the place, here is the House
 of God which will be built by this boy and his father, and God will
 never make his people astray, and the speech about this matter is long
 and we've just taken what is in front of you, and it is close to
 rightness, and not so different from what Imamism suppose, notice and
 only God knows. In the same speech it is mentioned: Until Jorhom tribe
 came and lived with them for ages, and it is as an answer from God to
 Abraham, and so God made lot of people go to them like Jorhom and the
 Giants (?), and when Ishmael grew up and married from them and been an
 owner for lot of cattles and riches, then after that he built the House
 with his holy hands with his father Abraham (PUT), then the mother of
 Ishmael died (PUH) and he son buried her beside the Holy House and it
 is the place called now Hajar Ismâ`eel [meaning: The stone of
 Ishmael], and after his death he was buried also there beside his
 mother, and this is the most probable we could find by ways we've
 mentioned afore, and this is the most famous for them [I guess he means
 by "them" Sunni people] and it is the most suitable for their high
 level (Abraham and his Household), and only God knows what was hidden.<br>
