 <center><font size="+3">The Land of Sâlih's (PUH) People</font></center>
 
 <p>We've pointed out previously their living places although there is some
 controversy that had not been under discussion, so after tracing back we've
 found out that it lies between Shâm (modern Syria and surroundings)
 and Hijâz (in KSA) in a place called Al-Hijr. God said: Though ye
 hew out dwellings in the mountain, being skilful?(Al-Sho`arâ':149),
 and from Ibn-`Abbâs as reported in interpreting the meanings of this
 holy phrase: they used to build castles in every position and hew houses
 in the mountains to be their dwellings places in winter so it is better
 and warmer, and Þemud was in Wâdi Al-Qurâ [= Valley of
 Villages] between Medina and Shâm, and A'ad was in Yemen, and the
 ages of Þemud's people used to range between one thousand years and
 three hundred years. And in His saying: Ye choose castles in the plains(Al-A`râf:74),
 meaning that they used to build the castles in the plains, and it is said
 that they used to make it there to take a rest in them. Abdul-Wahâb
 Al-Najjâr [another person that has also a book about prophets] said
 in his stories: Their homes were in Al-Hijr and it is between Hijâz
 and Shâm in Wâdi Al-Qurâ and they are apparent still
 til this very day, and some of my friends visited it and got into the king's
 home and it was a house with some rooms and has a large hall and carved
 into stone, and the place of their dwellings is known today as Faj Al-Nâqah
 [= The Hole of The She-Camel].
 <br>Al-Mas'udi said: Their remains are still obvious in the way as you
 come back from Shâm, and Al-Hijr of Þemud is in the southern-east
 part of the land of Midian and it is near the bay of Aqabah. And in the
 speech of Sâlih (PUH) as been told by the Holy Book: And remember
 how He made you viceroys after A'ad and gave you station in the earth.
 Ye choose castles in the plains and hew the mountains into dwellings(Al-A`râf:74)
 and this is a point to denote the origin of Þemud and their time
 and that they are the remains of A'ad, and this is as said by some historians.
 The people of Hadramawt claim that the lands of Þemud were part of
 A'ad colonies, so Abdul-Wahâb Al-Najjâr said: This is closer
 to the logic and doesn't conflict with what was said before, and also he
 reported some speeches and tidings in this section from european orientalists
 and also copied from the book of Jorji Zedân (Al-`Arab Qabl Al-Islâm)
 [=Arabs before Islam] and also from so many others discussing Þemud
 and the origin of Þemud and their time, and he mentioned his point
 of view about all of that in a long speech that we don't need to mention
 here after stating the holy phrase that discusses their situation and after
 what was traced from the Prophet and his Household (PUT), and we've explained
 as much as possible for those who has an attentive ears and an awakened
 heart.
 <br>Then in the speech about the prophets and messengers and their situations
 with their people, Quran ordered them one by one by names and moves from
 one before to the one after, and it is a clue for their time and place
 order, as understood by logic, look into the chapters of Al-A`râf,
 Hud, Al-Anbiyâ', Al-Mu'minun, Al-Sho`arâ', Al-Qasas, Fossilat,
 and the others, you will see them mostly moving from one known story to
 another one the same as in the story of Noah to the story of Hud, and the
 story of Sâlih to the story of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (PUT). It
 is for sure that their prophecy is proved according to the time order that
 Quran provided as to mention Jacob after Isaac and he is after Abraham,
 and also Solomon after David, and Jesus after Moses, and it is after Abraham
 and after Noah and after Adam, and their end is the prophet Muhammad and
 his Household (PUT). [here comes some lines that I couldn't translate easily.
 They bear much philosophical terms I guess plus they add nothing to the
 subject].
 </p><p>Some scholars mentioned about this matter that deserves to be mentioned
 here which is comparing `Ali ben Abi Tâlib, the prince of believers
 (PUH), with the She-Camel of Sâlih, because there are some speeches
 (Hadiths) that had been proved and traced back to the prophet (PUH), and
 also it is mentioned a comparison between Al-Zahrâ' [meaning Fâtima,
 the daughter of the prophet] with her (the she-camel) for some reasons.
 As traced back from the prophet (PUH) that he said to `Ali (PUH): The most
 unblessed in this life is the one who killed the she-camel of Sâlih
 and the one who will strike you on the head O `Ali until the blood of your
 head dye your beard. For many times it is reported from him (PUH) [meaning
 `Ali ben Abi Tâlib] that he compared his killer with the killer of
 the she-camel of Sâlih, and it is mentioned that some historians
 wrote papers and explained in length the possible reasons for such comparison.
 Some scholars said: whoever meditates through it will see the similarities,
 and that is `Ali (PUH) was a miracle shown by God through the prophet Muhammad
 (PUH) and he said (`Ali PUH): And what miracle is greater than me?. Al-Fâdhil
 Al-Mo`tazali Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed [person's name] in his interpretations:
 The history of this life is known and checked for the time after the flood
 until this very day, and never reached us in this period of time any tidings
 about any man from Arabs, Persians, Turks, Indians, Romans or any others,
 that has such bravery or even being close to him (`Ali PUH) in any character
 of completeness.
 <br>The owner of the book called "Al-`Adasiyât" [?] mentioned that:
 Gabriel (PUH) said to the prophet (PUH): God sent `Ali with the prophets
 in secret, and sent him with you in public. His birth (`Ali PUH) was in
 the Holy Kaaba, which is the rock of God's shrine, as the she-camel got
 out from a rock and this had never happened for any prophet or a viceroy
 of a prophet, and he (PUH) used to give the wisdom and knowledge for people
 as the she-camel used to give the people, and the reason for his killing
 is the same as this for killing the she-camel if anyone did meditate in
 both cases, and it is a long story, and after his killing they killed his
 son, Al-Husain (PUH), as they (people of Sâlih) killed the weanling
 of the she-camel, and so on with such similarities, and this is all what
 we could mention in explaining the situation of Sâlih (PUH) with
 his people, and may God help us.
