 <center><font size="+3">Aaron as A Henchman as Moses Requested</font></center>
 Thr request of Moses to make his brother Aaron as a henchman for him because
 he was more eloquent in speech than him is something weird since before
 and then after, and it might be as a joke and a mysterious secret. They
 said many things about it, and it is weird because God is the One that
 sent him (as a prophet) and everything is under His control, so as He sent
 him as a prophet and taught him and made him able and made his stick do
 many amazing deeds, He, the Exalted, was able also to make him the most
 eloquent of all the creations, and as He wants and wishes, and if He wanted
 Moses to be the most eloquent in every tongue and language He would make
 him, as He gave him the miracles in lot of situations, for He does what
 He wants and does not do what He wants as well and He shall not be asked
 about His deeds but only them would be asked. God has a wisdom in everything
 He does that a servant may catch some of it or may catch nothing of it,
 some gave reasons for such a request from Moses to God, to make Aaron as
 his henchman and a messanger to the pharaoh, which is something considered
 as we appointed before, and that is because Moses had an accent in his
 language and that because when he was a child at the house of the pharaoh,
 he (the pharaoh) put him on his lap and he (Moses) cought his beard and
 the pharaoh got frustrated and wanted to kill him but his wife Âsiyyah
 bent Mozâhim made an excuse for this and said: he has no mind and
 not able to think, and suggested to test him by putting dates and live
 coals in front of him, and when they did so, he (Moses) took a live coal
 abd put it into his mouth and so it had an effect on his tongue, and for
 this Moses grew up with some difficulties in his speech, but some other
 said that when his mother put him in the ark and threw him into the waters
 and then been picked up by the household of the pharaoh, God forbade the
 midwives for him and he stayed for three days without breastfeeding until
 his mother came, so they made this as a reason for his speech problem.
 <br>They say also that Moses went out of Egypt a long time ago and he stayed
 in Midian for a long time so he forgot the Egyptian language which is the
 language of the coptic people and because there are no one that could speak
 to him with this language, but as for Aaron he was living among the Egyptians
 and so he had more knowledge in their language, and so on of such useless
 stories they said about this matter that must not be discussed or even
 looked at but only to know what had been said. Yes, Aaron being more eloquent
 in speech than Moses is something that quran mentioned as attributed to
 Moses, so God said: My brother Aaron is more eloquent than me in speech.
 Therefor send him with me as a helper to confirm me(Al-Qasas:34), and also
 quran pointed out that there was a problem with the speech of Moses for
 God's saying: And loose a knot from my tongue, That they may understand
 my saying(TaHa:27-28), and the pharaoh mocked at him because of his problem
 in speech by saying: I am surely better than this fellow, who is despicable
 and can hardly make (his meaning) plain!(Al-Zokhrof:52), and yes it might
 be that they barely understood him and they did not understand his language
 clearly as they do understand each other, for any reason, and we shall
 say: at any time or place did kings follow the truthful men? Needless to
 say those who called themselves as gods and everyone else are servants
 for them just as the pharaoh, and at any time did the Israelites feel safe
 with him while he was killing their children and captivate their women
 and see no dignity for any elder or chief? But as for Aaron he was, for
 the pharaoh, an innocent man that had no sins or crimes recorded against
 him and he spent a long time among them (the coptic people) without any
 problems and everyone used to hear to him when he speaks and his intercession
 was accepted, but as for Moses (PUH) he was grown up in the house of the
 pharaoh and he was beloved, but at the end they considered him a betrayer
 and so he had no dignity in their eyes, but for them he is the first enemy,
 and so how come they accept any sermon or hear for him while he is their
 enemy, and they knew for sure that he was the one that commited the crime
 when he fled away after discovering his deed, and he addmited: He said:
 My Lord! Lo! I killed a man among them and I fear that they will kill me(Al-Qasas:33),
 and also he said: And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they
 will kill me(Al-Shu`arâ':14), and so if this is his situation with
 them how come they will listen to him or even look at any condition of
 his conditions? The tyranny of the pharaoh and his pride, and he is the
 one who said: I (Pharaoh) am your Lord the Highest(Al-Nâzi`ât:24)
 and also he said:  I know not that ye have a god other than me(Al-Qasas:38),
 they keep listening to Moses far away and this tyrant would not understand
 the speech of Moses because of his tyranny, and does anyone hope that this
 tyrant would listen to the one who he had grown up in his house and then
 killed someone from his people? No and No, and for this reason Moses asked
 from his Lord to make Aaron a henchman for him to express for them what
 he wants because he can make them understand what they do not understand
 from Moses (PUH).
 <br>Some faithful sermons sayers said about Moses' saying: And loose a
 knot from my tongue, That they may understand my saying(TaHa:27-28) what
 has a general meaning of that he was speaking to his Lord saying that "I
 am shy to speak to You with my tongue that I do use to speak with others,
 thus my shyness had become a knot in my tongue so Loose it," and they said
 about his saying: Appoint for me a henchman from my folk, Aaron, my brother(TaHa:29-30),
 that he was asking God to appointment Aaron as his henchman to avoid speaking
 to them with a tongue that he spoke to God with. That might be of truth
 somewhat, although prophets used to speak to God and His enemies with the
 same tongue and it is better to reach the desired results and among them
 (the prophets) there are who is even of higher place than Moses and among
 His enemies there are who is worse than the pharaoh.
