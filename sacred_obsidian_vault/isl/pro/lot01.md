 Funny Stories</a></big></big></big><br>
 <div style="text-align: left;"><a name="029_029">The people of Sodom
 were people of evil and rudeness, and they had a judge that judges for
 them always wether they were right or wrong as it is said, so then
 Sarah the wife of Abraham sent a messenger to Sodom to see the
 conditions of Lot and his safety, and when he arrived there one man saw
 him and came to him and hit him on his head with a stone so his blood
 went out, then he hanged on him and said: this huge amount of blood if
 it was in your body any longer it would harm you so I wanted my fees!
 When the debate went for so long between them and the messenger of
 Sarah could not get rid of that man he called him for a judgement, so
 they went to the ruler of Sodom, and when he heard their story he
 judged for the the messenger to pay for the sodomite the fees, so when
 the messenger of Sarah, Elazar, saw such unjustice he took a stone and
 hit the judge on his head and made his blood go out and said to him:
 the fees that you must pay to me for hitting you, pay them back to the
 man that hit me and made my blood go out, then he left out back to
 where he came from to escape this village and its unjustice.<br>
 Abdul-Wahâb Al-Najjâr said in his stories: I was reading
 the poem of Al-Ma`arri [a poet's name]:<br>
 </a>
 <div style="text-align: center;"><a name="029_029"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who is the one that saw a judge<br>
 That did not judge as the way of Sodom<br>
 </span></a>&lt;&gt;<a name="029_029">and I did not understand what did
 he
 mean by that and did he mean by Sodom, until I read this story and then
 I understood what is meant by the poem. There are other stories
 attributed to them that would make the author and the reader so shy of
 it but we left it out because they are connected to funny legends. How
 awfully great what the people of Sodom did and it was not of benefit
 for them the residence of the prophet Lot among them and his guides and
 advices, and they did not care about his warnings although he promised
 them the benefits and goodness, and he carried out lot of their
 troubles, and he stayed with them for long time but no results could be
 gained from them, then he prayed to God to punish them, and God allowed
 to punish them as soon as possible. Then God sent His messengers to
 flip upside down their villages and to tell Abraham about that before
 it is done, and when they went to him they brought to him the tidings
 about his son Isaac, and Jacob after Isaac. When they went to Abraham,
 he thought them to be guests, so he made for them some food and got a
 fat sheep for this, and when he saw that their hands do not try to get
 some of the food he got into doubts about them and got scared from
 them, so they told him that they are messenger of God had been sent by
 Him to take revenge from the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, and they are
 the ones that are expressed as to be the people of Lot. Some historians
 said: I think that the dead sea which is known now as the sea of Lot
 and/or the lake of Lot was not there before this incident, but it
 appeared because of the earthquake that made the toppest of the land to
 the lowest and it became lower than the sea level by almost four
 hundred meters. Some news been told lately about fiding some traces
 that belong to the villages of the people of Lot on the edges of the
 dead sea. When Abraham knew that the people of Lot will be destroyed
 and that the angels are sent to do so, and he saw that they had young
 people, sick people and children that did not do any wrong and also in
 the land there is Lot and his household, he was affected for this
 matter, for he had a passionate heart, so he could not hold hisself and
 started arguing about that and the angels then answered him "we know
 who is there better" and told him that Lot and his family will get no
 harm and they will be saved, and the judgement of God will not return
 back. God said: </a><a name="011_074">And when the awe departed from
 Abraham, and the glad news reached him, he pleaded with Us on behalf of
 the folk of Lot.</a><a name="011_075"> Lo! Abraham was mild, imploring,
 penitent(Hud:74-75).<br>
 God said about the people of Lot in the chapter of Al-A`râf: </a><a name="007_080">And Lot! (Remember) when he said unto his folk: Will ye
 commit abomination such as no creature ever did before you ?</a><a name="007_081">
 Lo! ye come with lust unto men instead of women. Nay, but ye are wanton
 folk.</a><a name="007_082"> And the answer of his people was only that
 they said (one to another):
 Turn them out of your township. They are folk, forsooth, who keep pure.</a><a name="007_083">
 And We rescued him and his household, save his wife, who was of those
 who stayed behind.</a><a name="007_084"> And We rained a rain upon
 them. See now the nature of the consequence of
 evil-doers!(Al-A`râf:80-84) And we've mentioned before the
 ancestry of Lot and that he is the son of Haran ben Terah, the cousin
 of Abraham, and also been said that he is his maternal cousin and that
 Sarah the wife of the Abraham is his sister, and we've mentioned before
 that there is nothing wrong about that, and Lot is Abraham's cousin and
 also his maternal cousin and also a brother of Sarah the wife of
 Abraham (PUH), check back and meditate and only God knows.<br>
 The people Lot used to come with lust to men instead of women and so
 they cut off the child birth and make people avoid passing into their
 lands for this deed because they used to do it with strangers that pass
 through their lands, and they used to throw stones on strangers and the
 one that hit him then this strnager would be for him, so they take his
 money and commit sodomy with him or take three coins from him and leave
 his money alone, and they had a judge that allows all of that, and in
 their gatherings they used to do abominations without being shy, so God
 revelaed His anger upon them and His punishment, and it was the black
 stones or in some other tales the black water and it is a sign for
 God's anger and a gate to lands' destruction. Every type is mentioned
 and it might be that every type was done indeed, and so their lands
 were flipped upside down and then been rained by the black stones, as
 it is told in details in the chapter of Hud: </a><a name="011_077">And
 when Our messengers came unto Lot, he was distressed and knew not how
 to protect them. He said: This is a distressful day.</a><a name="011_078">
 And his people came unto him, running towards him - and before then
 they used to commit abominations - He said: O my people! Here are my
 daughters! They are purer for you. Beware of Allah, and degrade me not
 in (the person of) my guests. Is there not among you any upright man ?</a><a name="011_079">
 They said: Well thou knowest that we have no right to thy daughters,
 and well thou knowest what we want.</a><a name="011_080">He said: Would
 that I had strength to resist you or had some strong support (among
 you)!</a><a name="011_081">
 (The messengers) said: O Lot! Lo! we are messengers of thy Lord; they
 shall not reach thee. So travel with thy people in a part of the night,
 and let not one of you turn round - (all) save thy wife. Lo! that which
 smiteth them will smite her (also). Lo! their tryst is (for) the
 morning. Is not the morning nigh ?</a><a name="011_082">
 So when Our commandment came to pass We overthrew (that township) and
 rained upon it stones of clay, one after another,</a><a name="011_083">
 Marked with fire in the providence of thy Lord (for the destruction of
 the wicked). And they are never far from the wrong-doers(Hud:77-83),
 and lot of such tidings been brought by other holy phrases from other
 chapters with little differences, and we'd like to point that out as
 headlines, in the chapter of Al-Hijr: </a><a name="015_070">They said;
 Have we not forbidden you from (entertaining) anyone ?</a><a name="015_071">
 He said: Here are my daughters, if ye must be doing
 (so)(Al-Hijr:70-71), and in the chapter of Al-Shu`arâ': </a><a name="026_166">And leave the wives your Lord created for you ? Nay,
 but ye are froward folk(Al-Shu`arâ':166).<br>
