 <div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><big><a name="026_219">The
 Infallibility of God's Viceroys</a></big></big></big><br>
 <div style="text-align: left;"><a name="026_219">It is mentioned that
 after giving the glad tidings for the God's friend that he will become
 a viceroy and a messenger and a prophet, he wished that this would be
 also in his descendants and asked that from God, so The Wise said to
 him: </a><a name="002_124">My covenant includeth not
 wrong-doers(Al-Baqarah:124). As reported from Al-Sâdiq (PUH): God
 took Abraham as a slave before He takes him as a prophet, and took him
 as a prophet before He takes him as a messenger, and then took him as a
 messenger before He takes him as a Friend, and He took him as a friend
 before He makes him a leader, so He gathered for him all of that He
 said unto him: </a><a name="002_124">Lo! I have appointed thee a
 leader for mankind(Al-Baqarah:124). Then he said (PUH): and because it
 was so great as seen by Abraham (PUH) he said "</a><a name="002_124">And
 of my offspring"(Al-Baqarah:124), so then God answered him back by
 saying: </a><a name="002_124">My covenant includeth not
 wrong-doers(Al-Baqarah:124), and the complete holy phrase from the
 chapter of Al-Baqarah, God said: </a><a name="002_124">And (remember)
 when his Lord tried Abraham with (His)
 commands, and he fulfilled them, He said: Lo! I have appointed thee a
 leader for mankind. (Abraham) said: And of my offspring (will there be
 leaders) ? He said: My covenant includeth not
 wrong-doers(Al-Baqarah:124) and this holy phrase assures that giving
 the commandments of God is done only for the infallible and the
 purified  faithful people, and although this holy phrase points
 out that the wrong-doer and the disbeliever do not take such a high
 place (to take the covenant) even though if it was just a period of his
 life, but it is also understood from it that he and his ancestors must
 be purified and infallible as well, so whoever becomes and enemy for
 God for some time in his life can not be a prophet or a viceroy of a
 prophet, and from this we move to the point of saying that his fathers
 and ancestors are infallible and purified and faithful, and we don't
 say that a prophet or a messenger or someone that takes their place
 that he is born from a pagan ancestor or father or being born of a sin,
 or he would be cursed for this and would be mocked of that because it
 is a bad character, and God, the Exalted, does not allow bad characters
 for His messengers to His creation, or it would be said that a son of a
 pagan or a son of unknown father was sent to us, and they say that
 disbelieving is a devil, but does a devil give birth except for a
 devil? and what a colocynth would yield except a colocynth? and God is
 able to give to His creation only a purified leader from purified
 ancestors until the end of the chain to Adam that was created by His
 hands as a holy and a purified creature and guided him, so how come He
 allows that a messenger or a viceroy that was appointed by His
 appointment to be a son of a pagan or that he himself was pagan and an
 idol worshipper even if it was for some time, but highness is only for
 God </a><a name="063_008">and His messenger and for the believers. And
 if you are in a doubt of the rule of the mind about this matter for
 some soul sickness then we have, and thanks for God, what makes us
 confident and what makes us even more sure than before, from speeches
 and talks reported from the prophet (PUH) and his Household (PUT) as
 they report them from their grandfather the chosen prophet and the
 owner of the holy quran and it is the ultimate prove.<br>
 It is mentioned and reported from them (PUT) that the prophet (PUH)
 said: I've became to existance from purified ancestors and purified
 wombs..etc, in a long speech that was some of it and with the same
 meaning comes a lot from the infallible Household members. And in
 Ziyârat Wâriþ [a ritual or a calling famous with this
 name, it resembles a visit to the shrine of some holy viceroy not
 necessarily going to his shrine, might be close to the meaning of
 seeking a bless from a saint] for Al-Husain ben `Ali (PUT) and also
 others in the same way that are approved to be issued from infallible
 Imams, in those ritual it is announced that their fathers are purified,
 and the infallible Imam from Al-Husain descendants calls for the
 grandfather of Al-Husain (PUT) by saying: I testify that you were a
 light (halo) in the purified ancestry and the purified wombs, never
 touched by paganism and its uncleanliness and never wore its darkest
 garments...etc, and if you looked into the famous Ziyârat
 Al-Jami`ah [another ritual or visit]  which isensured to be issued
 by Al-Hâdi (PUH) and if you meditated in its text then you would
 surely recognize the meaning and know that their fathers are like them,
 purified. You got also Al-Sâheefah Al-Sajjâdiyah [a book's
 name which has many rituals and was founded by `Ali ben Al-Husain
 (PUH)] which will guide you through to the truth, so from their
 prayers, callings and their speeches you can get the absolute truth
 about this matter, and if you still got doubt about all of that then
 you have Nahj Al-Balaghah [book's name] which collects some of the
 speeches for the prince of believers (`Ali ben Abi-Tâlib) (PUH)
 you will get from it the truth as well, and it is that all of the
 ancestors of all the prophets and messengers are purified and also
 their viceroys as well, who are appointed by a commandment and not by
 voting [the author here points out to the main difference between the
 Shiite creed and the Sunnite creed, where Shiite believe in a viceroy
 after each prophet appointed by God, but the Sunnite believe that the
 prophet did not mention anything about a viceroy before his death and
 so the caliphate or the viceroy after his death should be taken by
 voting and this is what happened, neglecting the right of `Ali ben
 Abi-Tâlib (PUH) in being a viceroy and a caliphate after the
 death of the prophet (PUH)]<br>
 And for God's saying: </a><a name="009_028">The idolaters only are
 unclean(Al-Tawbah:28), then none of their ancestor can be one of them.
 For this Shiites agree that the father of Abraham (PUH) was a muslim,
 and so the tidings that oppose this is not something to take or work
 with. But the father of Abraham is Terah and Azar was his uncle, and
 the uncle can be called a father as mentioned before and he used to
 take care of him and he (Abraham) was in his (Azar) house as it is
 apparent from the holy phrases, and many clues were been given for this
 matter so we have no doubt about that, and may God help us.<br>
