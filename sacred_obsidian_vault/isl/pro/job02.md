 It is mentioned by Wahab and Ka`b Al-Ahbâr and others that are non-muslims
 that Job the prophet was a roman man and on his forehead it was written
 "The Patient for Adversities", and he is Job ben Mus ben Darih ben Esau
 ben Isaac ben Abraham (PUT) [please refer to the beginning of this chapter
 and compare the name], and his mother was a descendant of Lot ben Haran
 (PUH) and he lived in Al-Baþnah, a town in the lands of Shem, and
 he had there many fortunes of camels, cows, horses, sheeps, and he was
 a faithful man that kept refuse in God against the devil and his tricks,
 and he had three men the believed in him with him, a man from Yemen was
 called Aleefan (Eliphaz), and two men from his own lands. It is attributed
 to Wahab a long speech that contains the tricks of Satan with Job (PUH)
 with details, mentioning that he (Satan) tricked Job with his money and
 children and his body by a permission of God, and Job increased in his
 praising to God, and that was annoying for Satan, and he nagotiated with
 his devils about what to do with him and he was never bored nor tired to
 trick him and make him sin and Job knew all his trials and kept on being
 so cautious for him and his soldiers, and then Satan went to the friends
 of Job and his beloved trying to make them hate Job and keep away from
 his beliefs until they said to him sorrowful and painful words, and some
 of these talks is known by the answer of Job to them as it is mentioned
 when he said to them: thanks be to God for whenever He gave me and for
 whenever He took from me, naked I got out from the womb of my mother and
 naked I shall go back to the ground, and naked I shall face God at the
 end, so you should not be happy O man when God gives you and should be
 scared when He takes form you, for God is the Best that can handle you,
 and if He knew any good in you He would take your soul with the other souls
 so you would be rewarded and be a martyr, but He knew that you only have
 some evil so He avoided you from adversities. That was the talk of Job
 to Satan when he came to him in the shape of someone that wanted to advise
 and blame him for his patience, so then Satan came back to his fellows
 as been humiliated. Satan continued to call people to deny him until they
 all refused him except of his wife Rahmah, so his sincere folks refused
 him but without refusing his religion and they kept on blaming him and
 mocking at him until he said to them: you are more harder on me than my
 adversity is, then he turned away from them and said: O Lord, for what
 reason I've been created? Wish if I can know that sin I did and the deed
 that I did that made You turn away from me, if just You made me follow
 my fathers for death is beloved more by me, was not I as a home for the
 stranger, and a home for the poor, and a father for the wretch, and a carer
 for the widow? O my Lord am I but a humiliated servant, if I did good then
 You have the favour and if I did bad then my punishment is in Your hands,
 You've made me a subject for the adversities..etc. It is a long and a great
 and an amazing pray that he mentioned in it the details of the adversities
 and whatever he faced of consolations and problems, and all of that as
 a complaint against God with the presence of his folks with him, so the
 answer from God was to be to blame him extremely for what he did of complaining
 extremely, and some of the speech of God to him was: and wear your apron
 and stand as an almighty for there is no one that should stand against
 me except of an almighty like me and no one should stand against me unless
 he who make the barnacles in the mouth of the lion, and the lambs in the
 mouth of the griffons and the bridles in the mouth of the dragons..etc,
 and this last talk is attributed to God. Then He started to count His favours
 for His servants and His creations, who made His earth, who made His heavens,
 the seas, the trees, the angels, the human, the djinn, the source of creativity,
 the details of things, whatever is kept in the chests of men, the languages
 of animals on lands, sea or air, other than animals, the soul, the mind,
 the hearing, the sightness and so on of such favours that have no end,
 and then the situation of Job was the most dangerous of all, he lost his
 mind and been mute and deaf and blind and did not know what to say. Yes
 he said, and some of what he said was: wish if earth was torn apart and
 I went inside of it instead of saying something that makes my Lord mad
 at me, until he said: O Lord, You made me like an enemy to You and You
 used to present me with gifts, a word that slipt of my tongue and I will
 never do it again, and I've put my hand on my mouth and bit on my tongue
 and to the ground I've put my cheek, forgive me for what I've said and
 I will never do something You hate again. Then said God: O Job, I've known
 you before, and My mercy comes before My anger, and if you've mistaken,
 I've forgave your mistakes and I shall give you back your household and
 your money and the same as them to be an example for those who will come
 after you and be an example for people of adversities and those of patience.
 <br>Then God revealed on him His gifts in life and the after-life, and
 the greatest gift was His satisfaction towards him and the after-life,
 so then the Merciful called him and ordered him to kick the ground with
 his feet, this is a spring with a cold bath and for drink, and so he did
 and a spring appeared so he got into it and bathed so then God took away
 all what he had of adversities, then he got out and sat, and his wife tried
 to feel him in the bed but she did not find him then she said in a speech
 of a lover and said to him: O servant of God do you know the man of adversities
 that was here a while ago? He said to her: would you know him if you saw
 him? She said: yes, how come I wouldn't, so then he smiled and said: I
 am him, so she knew him from his smile and hugged him and she had the great
 happiness, and thanks be to God. Then we've pointed out that scholars differ
 in the time of his calls for his Lord and the period of his adversities
 and for what reason he said "Lo! adversity afflicteth me", and as attributed
 to the prophet (PUH) he said that the prophet Job (PUH) remained in his
 adversity for eighteen years and people around him from close relatives
 to far ones all refused him and kept away from him except for two men from
 his brothers and his wife Rahmah that never left him. It is mentioned that
 Job (PUH) remained ill for seven years and some months without money or
 children or friends excpet of his wife Rahmah that had patience with him
 at the time that he never forgot to praise God and thank Him, so then Satan
 screamed and gathered all his armies from all around the earth because
 of his anger for Job's patience, so they suggested for him to approach
 Job from the side of his wife Rahmah, so she came to him (Job) with something
 faulty because of the whispers of the damned so he (Job) said to her: the
 enemy of God came to you and breathed in you and you accepted him, woe
 to you, do you see all of that fortune and children and health that I was
 in before, who gave them to me? She said: God, he said then: for how long?
 She said: eighty years. The meaning was that he said to her that God tested
 us for seven years and some months so it is not just to enjoy the wealth
 for eighty years and never be patient for seven years and some months,
 then he swore that if God made him healthy again he would flog her for
 one hundred times and then he banished her from his place and he had no
 one to serve him and then he fell prostrating for God and said: Lo! adversity
 afflicteth me, and Thou art Most Merciful of all who show mercy(Al-Anbiyâ':83),
 and that was a reason for his relief and then his wife Rahmah regretted
 and got back to him and said: if he banished me to whom shall I leave him,
 shall I leave him die of fear or get lost and beasts would eat him? So
 then she got back with sadness and regret but she did not see him so she
 started crying for Job, and then she saw a handsome man with fine garments
 so she asked him about Job, so he said to her: what do you want O servant
 of God? She cried then and said: I wanted that man of adversities, the
 one that was left alone, I don't know wether he was lost or what did he
 do, so he said: would you know him if you saw him? She said then: he was
 the one of the God's creation that is mostly like you if he was well, he
 said then: I am Job..etc, and we've been talking a lot and repeated some
 and it is some of what we found.
 <br>This is the last thing we did like to mention about the conditions
 of the faithful man, the prophet Job, may peace be upon him and on the
 prophet (PUH) and his Household (PUT).
