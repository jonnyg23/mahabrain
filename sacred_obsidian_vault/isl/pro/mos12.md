 <center><font size="+3">The Pharaoh Wants to Kill Moses and The Believing
 Man From The Pharaoh Family Defending Him</font></center>
 When the wizards were defeated and they all believed in Moses and what
 he had come with and they all fell prostrating to God, most of the people
 from the Israelites did believe as well so the pharaoh captivated them
 and used them for hard works and heavy adversities fell upon them, then
 after years of the signs of dryness, flood, locusts, vermin, frogs, blood,
 and terror (or pollution), he (the pharaoh) released them for Moses, but
 the pharaoh did not believe in Moses but insisted on his ideas and his
 rebellious nature neglecting the signs that Moses brought to him, but his
 people seduced him to run after Moses blaming him to let Moses go with
 his people to corrupt the lands as they claimed, and stop working for them
 as they used to do, and they cut off worshipping the pharaoh, and he (the
 pharaoh) used to calm them down by promising that he will kill Moses and
 his people and enslave their women depending on the power of his solders
 and their numbers and proud of his power, so then the pharaoh and his assistors
 started with torturing and the Israelites complain to Moses for what they
 are facing, and Moses call them to have some patience toward this adversity
 and commanded them to take refuge in God against what is coming in their
 way and he used to promise them with victory and they said to him: we've
 been under torture before and after your arrival.
 <br>He (Moses) promised them that their enemy will be destroyed and their
 adversities will be over and that they will rule the lands that it was
 promised for them, then the pharaoh wanted to kill Moses for he was afraid
 that he would change their religion and corrupt in the lands as they claim,
 but Moses (PUH) took refuge in God, the One, against the evil of every
 one of pride that does not believe in the day of Reckoning. In the chapter
 of Al-A`raf: The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: (O King), wilt thou suffer
 Moses and his people to make mischief in the land, and flout thee and thy
 gods? He said: We will slay their sons and spare their women, for lo! we
 are in power over them. And Moses said unto his people: Seek help in Allah
 and endure. Lo! the earth is Allah's. He giveth it for an inheritance to
 whom He will. And lo! the sequel is for those who keep their duty (unto
 Him). They said: We suffered hurt before thou camest unto us, and since
 thou hast come unto us. He said: It may be that your Lord is going to destroy
 your adversary and make you viceroys in the earth, that He may see how
 ye behave(Al-A`râf:127-129). In the chapter of Ghâfir: And
 verily We sent Moses with Our revelations and a clear warrant. Unto Pharaoh
 and Haman and Korah, but they said: A lying sorcerer! And when he brought
 them the Truth from Our presence, they said: Slay the sons of those who
 believe with him, and spare their women. But the plot of disbelievers is
 in naught but error. And Pharaoh said: Suffer me to kill Moses, and let
 him cry unto his Lord. Lo! I fear that he will alter your religion or that
 he will cause confusion in the land. Moses said: Lo! I seek refuge in my
 Lord and your Lord from every scorner who believeth not in a Day of Reckoning(Ghâfir:23-27).
 <br>Then the pharaoh made a plot with his people to kill Moses and started
 to watch for opportunities to do so for he was afraid that people would
 say he was not able to face Moses for his miracles, and Moses turned to
 be powerful among his people and the believers also, and the pharaoh was
 afraid
 of him because all of that, especially the staff and its deeds, and he
 thinks that if Moses wanted to destroy the pharaoh and his people and every
 enemy for him (Moses) with that staff he would do it without a doubt, and
 for this he was afraid of Moses, otherwise, he was a tyrant man, and then
 supposing that he is much more stronger than Moses and can assassinate
 him by any way, he was more afraid of the great shame that is to be said
 that he killed Moses for he could not face him, and what is the guilt of
 Moses to come with miracles, so then he would be signed with shame among
 people, especially poor ones.
 <br>The the pharaoh gathered for him the wizards but Moses defeated them
 and they believed in him. Lot of people believed in Moses after that wizards
 believed in him, thus the pharaoh was afraid to kill him to avoid the response
 for he had no rights against Moses as they can see and killing Moses might
 cause them to change their religion as well and doubt about his holiness,
 and here there was a way for the believing man of the pharaoh family to
 protect Moses, and he was the maternal cousin of the pharaoh and some say
 that he was his paternal cousin, and he is Hazaqeel (Ezekiel) (PUH) [The
 man is supposed to be Egyptian, but the name is of Hebrew origin, but this
 is how it was mentioned, but it differs from Ezekiel the prophet for sure
 although the author mentioned "PUH" after his name] and they say that he
 hid his faith for six hundred years as Taqiyyah [Arabic: Taqiyyah = Preservation,
 Protection. This action was spread among Shiite people so wide to get along
 with other communities for the long history of adversities and hostilities
 against them. It is done by acting, wearing and behaving like the community
 that a man would live in to get along with people and hide his faith in
 something], and as attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH): the Taqiyyah is
 of my religion and the religion of my fathers, and there is no religion
 for the one that has no Taqiyyah, for Taqiyyah is the shield of God on
 earth, for the believing man of the pharaoh would be killed if he showed
 his faith, and it is attributed to the prophet (PUH) that he said: the
 righteous are three and Ezekiel the believing man of the pharaoh family
 is considered one of them..etc, so Ezekiel in this story was defedning
 Moses freely for he was not afraid of being charged, for the pharaoh and
 his people are plotting against Moses.
 <br>Since the right is shown to be beside Moses and nothing can beocme
 higher than him, Ezekiel stood up to protect Moses that God appreciated
 that for him, and he did well with that fearing no one, and without a doubt
 he is a believer in Moses and in the Lord of Moses, and he explained for
 them that it is not approperiate to kill him just because he said that
 my Lord is "Allah" because his claims do not deserve to be killed for,
 and he came with his obvious miracles that proves his truthfulness, and
 then Ezekiel avoided being discovered so he said: if he was a liar then
 no harm of his lies, and if he was true, then some of his promises would
 be fullfilled against you, and by saying this he is pulling them gradually
 toward believing and admitting his truthful calls and proving that they
 are wrong and to ask them not to be fundamentalists, but the pharaoh opposed
 him in opinion and said to some people that agree with him against him
 (Ezekiel), then he (the pharaoh) said: I do but show you what I think,
 and I do but guide you to wise policy(Ghâfir:29), and the believing
 man of the pharaoh family did not stop just by telling them his opinion
 but also called to God and warned them against God's will and what happened
 to the ancient nations and how God deals with those who disbelieve in His
 prophets, and He took revenge of Noah's people and drawned them and destroyed
 A`ad and Þamud, and explained to them what happened to the various
 nations because of their deeds and reminded them that the calls of Moses
 are not something new, and Joseph ben Jacob (PUH) came with such tidings
 and calls before and when he passed away to his Lord they said that God
 will never send another prophet while before him came his fathers Abraham,
 Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob, and all of them were prophets and all came with
 clues and miracles and some of them God had guided and some others were
 not to be guided at all, and nothing can be hid from God in earth or heaven,
 and He never neglect the good and bad deeds and rewards everyone according
 to his deeds, thus believers will be in paradise nad eternal luxury, [some
 lines come here with tricky order that I could not translate, but it has
 the meaning of: Ezekiel is calling them to happiness and faith and they
 are calling to sorrow and hell].
 <br>They started to plot against Ezekiel as they did with Moses and they
 felt that he was believing in the religion of Moses for his obvious defense
 for Moses but God protected him against their plotting, and his end was
 to happiness and the pharaoh's end with his people to hell.
 <br>In an interpretation for Al-`Askari (PUH) as attributed to his fathers
 as they reported to Al-Sâdiq (PUH) that he said: Ezekiel, the believing
 man of the pharaoh family, a believer in the Oneness of God and a believer
 in the prophecy of Moses, and in preferring Muhammad (PUH) to all prophets
 and preferring `Ali ben Abi-Tâlib (PUH) and the rest of the Imams
 (PUT) to all other viceroys and he was a disbeliever in the sacredness
 of the pharaoh and what his people believe in, so some betrayers betrayed
 him and told the pharaoh about him and said: Ezekiel calls against you
 and helps your enemies, so he said to them: he is my cousin and my viceroy
 over my kingdom so if he did as you said then he deserves the punishment
 for neglecting my favours towards him and if you were liars then you deserve
 the extreme punishment for interfering with him, so Ezekiel then brought
 and was said to him: you disbelieve in the pharaoh and neglect his favours,
 so Ezekiel said then: O king, did you ever witness my lying? He answered:
 no, he (Ezekiel) said then: ask them then who is their lord? They all said:
 the pharaoh, he said then: who is your creator? They said: the pharaoh,
 he said: who is the one that gives you life and make a living for you and
 protect you? They said: this pharaoh! Then said Ezekiel: O king then witness
 and all of the people in your presence that their Lord is my Lord and their
 Creator is my Creator and the One who makes life for them is the One that
 makes life for me as well, and I make you witness with all people around
 you that every other god but their God I do disbelieve in. He said all
 of that meaning God, the One, the Lord of the worlds.
 <br>It is said that then the pharaoh turned his face to the betrayers and
 said: O people that seek corruption in my kingdom and desire sedition between
 me and my cousin, you are the ones that desire my punishment for your desires
 to kill my cousin, and then he ordered to put wedges in their legs and
 their chests and ordered to brush their bodies with iron brushes, and this
 is about God's saying: So Allah warded off from him the evils which they
 plotted, while a dreadful doom encompassed Pharaoh's folk(Ghâfir:45),
 so their betraying for Ezekiel was a reason for their destruction.
 <br>The holy phrases from the chapter of Ghâfir: And a believing
 man of Pharaoh's family, who hid his faith, said: Would ye kill a man because
 he saith: My Lord is Allah, and hath brought you clear proofs from your
 Lord ? If he is lying, then his lie is upon him; and if he is truthful,
 then some of that wherewith he threateneth you will strike you. Lo! Allah
 guideth not one who is a prodigal, a liar. O my people! Yours is the kingdom
 to-day, ye being uppermost in the land. But who would save us from the
 wrath of Allah should it reach us ? Pharaoh said: I do but show you what
 I think, and I do but guide you to wise policy. And he who believed said:
 O my people! Lo! I fear for you a fate like that of the factions (of old);
 A plight like that of Noah's folk, and A'ad and Thamud, and those after
 them, and Allah willeth no injustice for (His) slaves(Ghâfir:28-31),
 until God mentioned what he did say: And verily Joseph brought you of old
 clear proofs, yet ye ceased not to be in doubt concerning what he brought
 you till, when he died, ye said: Allah will not send any messenger after
 him. Thus Allah deceiveth him who is a prodigal, a doubter(Ghâfir:34),
 and God then said: And he who believed said: O my people! Follow me. I
 will show you the way of right conduct(Ghâfir:38), and also: And
 ye will remember what I say unto you. I confide my cause unto Allah. Lo!
 Allah is Seer of (His) slaves. So Allah warded off from him the evils which
 they plotted, while a dreadful doom encompassed Pharaoh's folk, The Fire;
 they are exposed to it morning and evening; and on the day when the Hour
 upriseth (it is said): Cause Pharaoh's folk to enter the most awful doom(Ghâfir:44-46).
 In a narration attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH) about Ezekiel: by God,
 they turned him into pieces, but God warded off the evils of being a disbeliever.
 They said that he hid his faith until Moses appeared and defeated the wizards
 so he showed his faith with the wizards and so he was crucified with them.
 <br>Although Moses was so cautious toward the pharaoh and his tyranny he
 did not stop calling him to believe in God and work with the righteous
 religion seeking that if he believed then all people would do so as well
 because they all follow him, so his wish to make the pharaoh believe was
 to let all people believe as well, thus all in Egypt would believe in God,
 so his true gain is to make all people believe in God and His religion
 and work according to His laws, and Moses increased his calls towards the
 pharaoh to believe after that wizards believed in him neglecting the tyranny
 of the pharaoh, and Moses were calling and asking him to believe in God
 and release the Israelites.
 <br>The pharaoh did exaggerate in his response and saw that it is something
 so great for him to believe in Moses and follow his religion with such
 power and riches he had and all the people were his slaves, and Egypt with
 its Nile and its branches that run all over the lands pour into his riches,
 and so he was taken away with his material soul that sees no dignity except
 by riches so he said: I am surely better than this fellow, who is despicable
 and can hardly make (his meaning) plain!(Al-Zokhrof:52), and also said:
 Why, then, have armlets of gold not been set upon him, or angels sent along
 with him?(Al-Zokhrof:53), and the damned neglected what Moses brought with
 him which was greater than what he wished, and if Moses brought what he
 wished he would still say it is but magic, but he works with his forked
 tongue in front of the poor people and by these sayings his people did
 follow him for they used to follow him to wherever he wants and so they
 sold their after-life and their religion and their souls for the sake of
 the life of the pharaoh and so they lost the life and the after-life and
 this is the great loss, and that made him gather the people from every
 where and say to them: I (Pharaoh) am your Lord the Highest. God did tell
 his story in the chapter of Al-Zokhrof: And Pharaoh caused a proclamation
 to be made among his people saying: O my people! Is not mine the sovereignty
 of Egypt and these rivers flowing under me? Can ye not then discern? I
 am surely better than this fellow, who is despicable and can hardly make
 (his meaning) plain! Why, then, have armlets of gold not been set upon
 him, or angels sent along with him? Thus he persuaded his people to make
 light (of Moses), and they obeyed him. Lo! they were a wanton folk(Al-Zokhrof:51-54).
 And in the chapter of Al-Nâzi`ât: Then turned he away in haste,
 Then gathered he and summoned, And proclaimed: "I (Pharaoh) am your Lord
 the Highest." So Allah seized him (and made him) an example for the after
 (life) and for the former(Al-Nâzi`ât:22-25), and the former
 is when he said: I know not that ye have a god other than me, and the after
 (life) is when he said: I (Pharaoh) am your Lord the Highest. Thus, when
 pride conquered the pharaoh with tyranny and rebelled against the commandment
 of God and exaggerated in disbelieving Moses and kept on torturing the
 Israelites and humiliating them, God then ordered Moses to tell the pharaoh
 and his people that God will reveal His punishment upon them, and thus
 whenever an adversity comes over them they knew its reason and it is only
 because of the prays of Moses and he had promised them with that, so they
 had to come to Moses and promise him with believing in God to have a relief,
 and when God take off His punishment they would get back to tyranny, and
 so on until the great adversity fell upon them and that is by drawning
 the pharaoh and his people and destroying them, and that was the great
 happy tidings for the Israelites in this life for their victory and been
 safe and the destruction of their enemy.
 <br>The adversities that came over them after that Moses showed his miracles
 and clues are: the dry years, loss of plants, flood, locusts, vermin, frogs,
 blood and terror (or pollution), and before that the staff and the hand,
 and they are nine and Moses had lot of miracles before these previous miracles
 and after the death of the pharaoh and we will point out the strangest
 of them so just wait. Some concluded that these previously mentioned miracles
 are not the same as the miracles that Moses was sent with to the Israelites,
 and that by God's saying: Do but ask the Children of Israel how he came
 unto them(Al-Isrâ':101), and the miracles (or tokens) that are special
 for the Israelites are considered to be laws and regulations as it is mentioned
 that a jew asked the prophet (PUH) about these phrases (or tokens) so he
 (PUH) said: they are: do not believe in other god but the Lord, do not
 steal, do not commit adultery, do not kill the soul that God fobade unless
 by a right, do not take an innocent man to the ruler to kill him, do not
 commit magic and witchcraft, do not deal in usury, do not claim bad things
 on a faithful woman, do not escape from fighting, and for you jews in special
 do not transgress the Sabbath, so when the prophet (PUH) finished his talk
 the jew man stood up and took his hand and kissed it and said: I swear
 that you are a prophet.
 <br>Thus, the miracles or phrases that are special for the Israelites were
 as regulations and laws for all people of all creeds and religions that
 were before them or that will be after them until the doomsday which are
 fixed in all religions, and what we believe is that everything that Moses
 brought of regulations was for all sane persons of coptic people or the
 Israelites and others as well of djinn and human beings, because his regulations
 are for the public and it banishes what came before it, and for no doubt
 Moses is considered one of stout of heart among the messengers [messangers
 of stout hearts is an expression used to denote prophets or messangers
 that their message and religion was for all people and not only one tribe
 or nation, and they are five: Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad (PUT)],
 for he is a messanger in the first place from God to Egypt, to the pharaoh
 and Haman and Korah and to release the Israelites from the hands of the
 tyrant pharaoh, and in reality he is a messanger to all people that do
 understand at his time and so on until his religion is to be changed and
 banished by another prophet that God would send after him, and it had been
 banished with religions that came after by the religion of Islam by the
 hands of its prophet, the Hashimite, may peace be upon him and upon his
 Household and upon the rest of the messangers and prophets.
 <br>We say also that everyone had to ask for a miracle as a proof for what
 he came with, and the Israelite is like anyone else to ask for miracles
 and the regulations and laws for all, and as for the pharaoh and his tyranny
 he was faced with miracles such as the staff and others in public, and
 this is by God's saying: Go thou unto Pharaoh! Lo! he hath transgressed
 (the bounds)(TaHa:24), do not be confused. Look to the many doubts of the
 Israelites and they had like any other nation, the believer and the hypocrite,
 and when they went out of the sea after the destruction of their enemy,
 they saw some people worshipping an idol for them so then they said to
 Moses: O Moses! Make for us a god even as they have gods(Al-A`râf:138),
 and when Moses went away from them to get the commandments from God they
 rebelled against his viceroy, his brother Aaron, and followed As-Samiri
 (the Samarian) with the worshipping of the calf, and the Samarian was one
 of them, and Korah was also one of them, so notice, but they had been divided
 to many branches as well as nations before, and so all of that requires
 a miracle to be shown up for them, or even for some special people of them
 as well as it was done with others before, and they did take refuge in
 him because of their adversities only, but we do not deny that there are
 faithful believers that were waiting for him to appear as we've mentioned
 before, and they had to ask for miracle as well, and what was mentioned
 of holy phrases are all mentioned in the chapters of Al-A`râf, Al-Isrâ',
 TaHa, Al-Naml, Al-Qasas, Al-Zokhrof, Al-Qamar, Al-Nâzi`ât and
 so on and they are all give the brightest clues for the noble thinker and
 would make his darkness brighter and they are a refreshment for the heart,
 so how great are these miracles and holy phrases that leave no excuse.
