 <font size="6"><p align="CENTER">Sheikh of messengers, Nooh (Noah) PUH</p>
 </font><p>The speech now is about obtaining some of the conditions of the sheikh of messengers and the third in order and the great messenger after Adam and Enoch (PUT), he is Noah ben Lamech ben Methuselah ben Enoch ben Lud (or Jared as mentioned in Torah) ben Mahalaleel ben Cainan ben Enosh ben Seth ben Adam the father of human beings (PUT), as mentioned in histories and in Torah and God only knows. It is mentioned that his real name is 'Abdul-Ghaffâr (slave of the Forgiver) but named Noah because he used to cry over his condition [yanooh = to cry, Arabic], and it is said that his name is 'Abdul-Malik (slave of the King), and said it is 'Abdul-A'lâ (slave of the One of Height). It is said that Al-Sadooq said: all the tidings agree that his name contain the sense of slavery like 'Abdul-Ghaffâr, Malik, and Al-A'lâ, and he is the first prophet after Enoch, and they said he was a carpenter and was born in the same year that death betook Adam in and was sent (as a prophet) when he was four hundred years old and he used to call his people by day and night to work with the laws of his grandfather Enoch and whatever his fathers used to be on from laws and creeds, because the books that were revealed on his infallbiel fathers contained whatever people might need and what must be done and what must be believed in, for it was revealed on Adam twenty one books, and on Seth twenty nine books, and on Enoch thirty books, and the sum of all is eighty books, so Noah (PUH) used to work by them and call people to work by them but his calls didn't do anything but make them more far away from him. <br>
 He was highly disrespected by his people and even had been beaten so much. They used to beat him so much until he goes into a coma and whenever he is awake again he says: O Lord guide my people they do not know. And in some tidings it is said that they get angry at him and start to beat him until his ears get bleeding and he won't be able to realize what is done with him, then he was carried and thrown into his house or at the door of his house and he's in a coma. Then God inspired to him: No-one of thy folk will believe save him who hath believed already (Hud:36), so then he started calling for the destruction of his people and said: My Lord! Leave not one of the disbelievers in the land (Nooh:26), and in tales it is said that after calling for their destruction God made their men and women barren and so they stayed forty years they don't bear any children and their lands were barren also along these forty years and they lost their money and fortune and fell into disasters, then Noah said to them: Seek pardon of your Lord. Lo! He was ever Forgiving (Nooh:10) but they didn't believe and said: Forsake not your gods. Forsake not Wadd, nor Suwa', nor Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr (Nooh:23) and they extremely revolted against God and his prophet Noah (PUH) until God flooded them with their gods that they used to worship, and no one survived but the ones that were with Noah in the Ark, and after they've been in safe and been stable on the face of earth and gave birth for children and been many, they got back to what their fathers used to do with worshipping idols and named their idols after the names of idols the were in the time of Noah's people, and they are their fathers. So, yemenites (people of Yemen) Yaghuþ and Ya'uq and the people of Dawmat Al-Jandal (a place in Iraq) took an idol named Wadd, and Himyarites had an idol named Nasr, and Haðeel [seems some where in Saudi Arabia or Yemen] had an idol named Suwâ', and they kept on worshipping them until the presence of Islam. <br>
 Many differences occured in tales and tidings and opinions about his conditions and his age and that is because the difference of resources and references and many people count on what is mentioned in the Bible and Torah even though what is mentioned in them is still controversial and lot of muslims as wisemen and interpreters depend on them, and there are tidings and tales from the Household traced back to their grandfather the prophet that was sent as a guider from Gabriel from God the Exalted (PUT), and we have no problem in believing what was mentioned by them. <br>
 But the tales are from different sources and conflict with each other, some of them people do agree with and some of them are taken from Torah and other such resources, but the main purpose of all that is just to take a look on some of the conditions of this holy prophet and it is enough to take whatever was mentioned by the Holy Book (Quran) for his (Noah) great position and the rightness of his messeage and prophecy, so if something about his conditions was passed over to us by other ways, we shall take whatever is approperiate for his position and goes along with the law of justice and the infallibility of prophets, and refuse anything else that comes against these principles. One of these tales what is traced back to Al-Sâdiq (PUH) that Noah (PUH) lived two thousands and five hundred years, eight hundred and fifty years before he was sent as a prophet and one thousand but fifty years with his people calling them to his religion and two hundred years in making the Ark, and five hundred years after the flood and going down from the Ark, and so he made the lands and made his descendants live in the lands, and then after the angel of death (PUH) came to him while he was sitting in the sun and said to him: peace on you, so Noah (PUH) answered back and said: what do you need O angel of death?, he said: I came to you to take your soul, so he (Noah) said: let me sit in the shadow and he answered: yes, then Noah (PUH) moved and said: O angel of death, whatever passed me in this life was just like my movement from sun to shadow, go ahead and do your job, and so he did (PUH). <br>
 And from Ikmâl Al-Deen [seems a person's name] from Al-Sâdiq (PUH) from the prophet (PUH) that he said: Adam the father of all human beings (PUH) lived for nine hundreds and thirty years and Noah lived two thousands and four hundreds and fifty years and Abraham (PUH) lived for one hundred and seventy five years and Ismael ben Abraham lived for one hundred and twenty years and Isaac lived for one hundred and eighty years, and Jacob lived for one hundred and twenty years, and Joseph lived for one hundred and twenty years, and Moses lived for one hundred and twenty six years, and Aaron lived for one hundred and thirty three years, and David lived for one hundred years, forty years of them as a king, and Solomon ben David lived for seven hundreds and twelve years (PUT). <br>
 And from Al-Sayid Ibn Tâwoos: Adam (PUH) lived for one thousand and thirty years since the time of breathing in his soul until his death and he was buried in a cave in the mount of Abi-Qobays and his face towards the Holy Kaba, and Eve didn't live after him but only for one year and got sick then after for fifteen days and died and buried beside him, and we've come to mention this matter but we've come to mention it again to show the great difference and it is there because the long time period and the great number of tracers and handlers and most of the tracing is back to Torah and its covenants and books. <br>
 And it is not something to hide that there is a degree of difference between the Arabic, Samarian (?) and Greek translations for Torah and the Hebrew version, as mentioned in the book of "Iðhâr Al-Haq" for the Sheikh Rahmatullâh Afandi Al-Hindi. <br>
 And we've mentioned before that the truth is what is truely traced back to the Household. If it was like that then it is as nothing better than this, and if not then whatever is for sure and goes along with the Holy Book and doesn't oppose the laws mentioned before it is taken. And it is fine also to take whatever is traced back to the fellows (of the prophet) and the followers (fellows' fellow) and the followers of followers, but with respecting rules mentioned before. <br>
 From Al-Ikhtisâs [seems a book's name] for the sheikh Al-Mofeed from 'Omar ben Abân from people he assures, he said: There were five Syriac prophets: Adam, Seth, Enoch, Noah and Abraham, and the tongue of Adam was Arabic and it is the language of people in paradise, but when Adam did sin God exchanged it for him with Syriac. Then he said: and there were five hebrews: Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David and Jesus. And five from Arabs: Hud, Sâleh, Sho'ayb (Jethro), Ismael and Muhammad (PUT). And the life was owned by two believers and two disbelievers, the two believers were Ðol-Qarnayn [many other stories and tales point out that this person might be Alexander the great] and Solomon the king (PUH), and the two disbelievers were Nimrod ben Koshan (also Cush in Torah) ben Kan'ân (Canaan) and Bokhtanassar (Nebuchadnezzar). <br>
 from the book of Al-Qisas (The Tales) for Muhammad ben Jorair Al-Tabaree: God had a bless on Noah by letting him obey his commandments, and Noah had a tall of three hundreds and sixty arms [arms here are meant to be cubits], as measured by the arms of his own people at his time, and he used to wear the wool while Enoch before him used to wear hair, and Noah used to live on mountains and eat from the plants of earth. In another tidings that he was a carpenter, and then Gabriel (PUH) came to him with the message of God and he was four hundreds and sixty years old that time, so he asked him: why you are alone? he answered: because my people don't know God and so I've stayed away from them, so Gabriel said to him: fight against them, so Noah answered: I have no power to overcome them, and if they knew me they would kill me, so he said to him: and if you are given the power would you fight against them? so then he answered: O how eager I am to do so, then Noah said: who are you? Then Gabriel gave a shout, and the angels answered him back and shaked the earth and said to him: Here we are at your service O messenger of the Lord of Creations, so Noah stayed afraid, then Gabriel said to him: I am the partner of your fathers Adam and Enoch, and the Lord says peace to you, and I've come with the good news from Him, and this is the cloth of patience and the cloth of truth and the cloth of victory and the cloth of the message and the cloth of prophecy, and God had ordered you to marry 'Amoorah the daughter of Dhimrân ben Akhnookh, for she is the first to believe in you. So then Noah went to his people in the day 'Ashoorah ['Ashoorah is a name for the tenth day of Muharram, the first month in the lunar calendar] and holding a white stick in his hand, and the stick was telling him what his people are going to do. <br>
 Their bosses were seventy thousands of tyrants at their idols in their festivals, so then Noah called: No God save but the Lord, then the idols went shaking and the fire went down and they got scared and the tyrants said: who is that? Then Noah said: I am a slave of God and the son of His slave, He has sent me to you as a messenger, then 'Amoorah heard the speech of Noah and believed in him and her father Dhimrân ben Akhnookh blamed her for that and said to her: does the speech of Noah effect you in one day? and I'm afraid that the king knows about you and kill you, then said 'Amoorah: O father where is your brain and your clemency? Noah is but a lonely weak man that shouted and done to you whatever is done. Then her father threatened her but that yeilded no results, so they adviced him to imprison her and stop feeding her and so he did for a year and they hear her talking, then her father got her out of the prison after the year and she got a great halo and was in best condition, so they were amazed for her living for a year without food or drink, so they asked her about her situation and what happened to her so then she said that she called for the help of the Lord of Noah and Noah used to bring for her whatever she needed from drinks and food, and then after that Noah married her and she gave birth to Shem (PUH), and they mentioned that Noah got two wives, one of them is a disbeliever and she died and he carried with him his faithful wife in the Ark. </p>
