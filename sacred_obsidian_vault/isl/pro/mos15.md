 <center><font size="+3">Moses and His People Going Out From The Sea Into
 The Land</font></center>
 When Moses went out with his people from Egypt and the pharaoh followed
 them and harassed them with his soldiers, God ordered then Moses to strike
 the sea with his staff and so the sea was splitted for him with twelve
 roads as much as the number of the tribes of the Israelites and no more
 nor less than this number for every tribe has its own way, and then Moses
 with his people passed over and the pharaoh was destroyed with his people,
 so then Moses went out to the desert, and there were no towns or trees
 or food or even water, and when they spent many days there they got annoyed
 because of this situation, where they find themselves in a desert that
 has nothing except sands and sun and the extreme heat after they had been
 in a great land as Egypt with lot of people and there they were born and
 lived for many years and there they had everything they would like of living
 conditions and there they had possessions and some had a trade and others
 had crafts and others had plants and investments and productions and everyone
 had a job there and they used to it, and now they had been without a job
 and without something to eat so they felt the loneliness for leaving their
 homes and for what they used to see of buildings and now they are out of
 the favours they used to live in into the desert and this got so hard on
 them and sadness got into them and they felt humiliated so they had refuge
 in Moses and they were crying and weeping and they complained to him about
 what they feel, so Moses then began to calm them down and tell them sermons
 and telling them that God will make them rulers and give them more than
 what they did have before and will make them higher and rule the world
 only if they did have patience and fought against the enemy of God and
 obeyed His commands and followed His viceroy, so Moses calmed them down
 with his words and they relaxed and believed in his promise, and then they
 complained about the heat so he prayed to God and He sent the clouds to
 shade them all daytime then they complained about the hunger so then God
 revealed upon them the manna and quails, and the manna was a subject that
 fell upon them at night on some plants and make their taste so sweet with
 easiness to eat and digest as they said, and they said its name was (the
 plant) is Taranjabeen [this name might denote the Citron], and it used
 to fell upon the plants on that desert so they eat them later, and for
 the quails it was a bird that covered the earth with its numerous numbers
 so they used to take what they need from it and it has the finest taste
 among all birds' meats and it was flying towards them so then they take
 it and cook it, and its fine taste is proved by the holy phrase: Eat of
 the good things wherewith We have provided you(Al-Baqarah:57).
 <br>In the honorable speech (of the prophet PUH): when Moses passed with
 them into the land they landed in a desert and then they said to Moses:
 O Moses, you doomed us and picked us out of urban areas to a desert that
 has no shadows, no trees nor water, so then a cloud came at day time to
 make shade for them against the sun and at night the manna is revealed
 upon them so they eat it in the next morning and at night a cooked bird
 is revealed for them upon their tables, and when they eat and get satisfied
 they never look for something else. There was with Moses a stone that he
 used to put in the middle of the camp and then strike it with his staff
 so that twelve springs would show up from it thus each tribe has its own
 spring, and they were twelve tribes descended from Jacob (PUH), and the
 tribes [Arabic: tribe (Israelite tribe) = Sibt, might be equal to the English
 word Sept as well!] are children of the children like clans and tribes
 from the children of Ishmael ben Abraham (PUT), and the Quran used this
 term (Sibt, pl. Asbât) and its explanation will come later by God's
 will, so all children of Jacob are called "Sibt" and all children of Ishmael
 are called "Qabeelah" [in translations for Quran both words are translated
 as "tribe" but Arabic is rich with destinctive terms that would have only
 one translation in English and maybe only people with deep knowledge in
 the Arabic language can make destinctive translations], so the tribes at
 the time of Moses were twelve and they are the ones that went out with
 Moses.
 <br>It might be apparent that the ones that believed in Moses truely and
 been sincere with their Lord before going out (of Egypt) or when Moses
 called them to believe in God the One, the Lord of angels and souls, only
 few of them were afraid of the pharaoh, and the elders of the Israelites
 were using Taqiyyah (avoiding) with the pharaoh and the most of the Israelites
 were in doubt, so only few of those people did believe in Moses, and most
 of the Israelites were followers for the coptic people with the creed of
 the pharaoh, and the previous wonders, that God stroke the pharaoh and
 his people with, did not avoid them from being followers for that paganism
 that they lived long time with although they were not beloved and humiliated,
 for they faced lot of torture and humiliation with the Egyptians, and then
 a rescuer came from them and he is the messanger of God Moses and Moses
 faced many obstacles and threats just to rescue them, and he was called
 an insane and a wizard and he taught the pharaoh hard lessons with his
 miracles that points out to his truthfulness, and they (the Israelites)
 saw with their own eyes how the sea was splitted for them so that they
 passed over without being a bit wet or losing a thing, as one historian
 said, and he said also: they even tricked the women of the Egyptians and
 took their ornaments and jewels and they went out with all these jewels
 like a captivated man ran away with his chains, and when the pharaoh desired
 to pass with them to get them back into slavery, God closed the sea on
 them and all were destroyed, all of that happened in front of their eyes
 and Moses did not forget to remind them and explain to them that all the
 deeds that he did were all from God and by His commandments and He is their
 Lord and the Lord of their fathers and He is the One and the Alive that
 has no companions, and the wet sands were still sticking to their shoes
 but their paganism nature came over them, and their badness in their souls
 pushed them to ask Moses, after passing by some people that worship some
 idols, asked him to make a god for them as they have a god, and what do
 you imagine the answer of Moses to them? Are blaming and warning useful
 now after he did all that for them? Moses was not ignorant for their situation
 and their rocky minds and their silly ideas and the meanness that was planted
 in their souls as if they were drunk without thought: They are but as the
 cattle - nay, but they are farther astray(Al-Furqân:44), would he
 (Moses) be regretted for what he did and for all the deeds and troubles
 he beared and for the humiliation that he faced? No and No, for he is a
 messanger from God, the Exalted, and an advisor for his people, so patience
 is his ally, and mercy is his companion, and he did not leave anything
 that blisses God, and everything he faced was for them and their happiness
 and to gather them again, and he was in hope for their correct faith to
 win the honor of life and the after-life, so his answer to them was only
 to be patient for the sake of God: Then have patience even as the stout
 of heart among the messengers (of old) had patience(Al-Ahqâf:35),
 and what they deserve for their request to have a god other than their
 Lord is to be rebuked for their shamelessness and misunderstanding and
 for their injustice toward the One who destroyed their enemy and saved
 them from his wrath and made them the best among the nations, and a God
 with such miracles toward them and such favours for them should not be
 left to worship another except by those who are silly and been shameless
 and been stuck with the shame that shall never be removed, this is if there
 is such an imagination that there is another god to be worshipped other
 than Him, and maybe such a talk is to go along with those who are silly
 and do not believe in a doomsday and paradise or hell, and is there a wise
 man full of sense that would believe in the existance of someone that shares
 or opposes the Creator of the universe and the night and day abd the Creator
 of time and space, unless he was stupid and made his soul a toy for the
 devil, or of those that their hearts became dark and unhappiness was destined
 for them and been like deaf, dumb, blind, therefore they have no sense,
 may God guide us, the Merciful, for what blisses Him and to the goodness
 of this life and the after-life by His beloved the chosen and his Household
 the best of the creations, Amen.
