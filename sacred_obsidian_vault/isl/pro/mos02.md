 <center><font size="+3">Going Out of Egypt to Midian</font></center>
 When Moses turned to be a suspect in the matter of killing the Egyptian
 and the pharaoh was informed about it, he (the pharaoh) sent a group of
 me that he prepared for such matter, but the faithful man of the household
 of the pharaoh was faster than them and told Moses that they want him and
 advised him to rescue himself and leave the lands of Egypt to be in safe,
 and Moses checked that and found it was true, so then he went out of Egypt
 while he was afraid and watching, and he said: My Lord! Deliver me from
 the wrongdoing folk(Al-Qasas:21), so he went to Midian after that he knew
 that the people want to slay him, so God said in the chapter of Al-Qasas:
 And he entered the city at a time of carelessness of its folk, and he found
 therein two men fighting, one of his own caste, and the other of his enemies;
 and he who was of his caste asked him for help against him who was of his
 enemies. So Moses struck him with his fist and killed him..etc(Al-Qasas:15),
 the holy phrases contain what we've mentioned before, so check them. In
 some speeches it is mentioned that Moses stayed in the house of the pharaoh
 in luxury until he turned to a man, so then he went out of his house and
 went to a city and found there two men fighting, some of them speak as
 Moses do and the other as the pharaoh does, so then Moses came and poked
 their enemy and killed him, then he hided in the city and disappeared,
 and on the next day another man came and took hold of the man that speaks
 as Moses does and he asked Moses to help him, and then the Egyptian man
 took a look at Moses and said to him "Wouldst thou kill me as thou didst
 kill a person yesterday," so he (Moses) just released him and escaped,
 and then the treasurer of the pharaoh was a faithful man who believed in
 Moses and he kept his faith in secret for six hundred years, and he is
 the one that God said about: And a believing man of Pharaoh's family, who
 hid his faith..etc(Ghâfir:28).
 <br>As attributed to the prince of believers (PUH) that he reported to
 the prophet (PUH) that he said: when Joseph was about to die he gathered
 his followers and his household, then he praised God and then he spoke
 to them about some adversities that will happen to them which will cause
 men to be killed and the abdomens of pregnant women to be ripped open and
 children to be killed until truth is to be shown later by a descendant
 of Levi ben Jacob, and he is a tan long man and he told them his name and
 they kept it with them, and then the age of disappearance began and the
 adversities took over the Israelites and they kept on waiting for the man
 for four hundred years, and then they asked for the scholar that they used
 to take refuge in his speeches and feel comfortable with him but he hid
 for the great adversities and wrong-doing and they did write to him and
 said to him: at the time of adversities we used to feel comfortable to
 your speeches, so he came to them and took them out to some deserts and
 sat there talking to them about the man that will appear and save them
 and telling them about his name and his characters and telling them that
 his time is near and it was a night of full moon, and while they were sitting
 like that, Moses went out for them and at that time he was only a kid and
 went out from the house of the pharaoh as for picnic but in reality he
 was meaning to go to them and he walked on the side of the march, then
 he left the march and went to them on his mule and wearing a green robe,
 so when the scholar saw him he knew him by his name and his characters
 so he went to him and prostrated over his feet kissing them, and then he
 said: thank be to God to see you before I die, and when the followers saw
 that they knew that he is the man so they fell on the ground prostrating
 to thank God, and then he (Moses) did not say anything more than: hope
 that God will relief you soon, and then he disappeared, and then later
 on he went to Midian where Jethro was and he lived there for some time
 and so the second disappearance of him made greater adversities than the
 first, and it lasted for something around fifty years, and the adversities
 became even harder and his representative man, the scholar, also disappeared
 for he was also afraid of being killed, but then they sent a message to
 him saying that they have no patience for his disappearance, so he went
 out to some deserts and called them, so when they came he talked to them
 and calmed them down and told them that God had inspired to him that He
 will relief them after forty years, so they all said: thanks be to God
 for He gives every gift, everything good is from Him and only He can cast
 away evil, and then God started their relief and while they were waiting,
 Moses appeared to them riding his ass and he stood before them and greeted
 them, and the scholar came to him and said to him: what is your name? He
 said: Moses ben Amram ben Waheeb ben Levi ben Jacob, so then the scholar
 said: with what did you come? He answered: with the message from God, so
 he (the scholar) went to him and kissed his hand and then Moses sat among
 them and calmed them down and commanded them with his command and forbade
 them and advised for them and guided them, then he commanded them to get
 separated and wait for the relief by the destruction of their enemy, so
 the time period between this meeting and the relief by the death of the
 pharaoh was forty years.
 <br>It is attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH) that he said that when the
 pharaoh knew that his kingdom would be destroyed by the hands of Moses
 and he is one of the Israelites, he worked on seeking him so he ordered
 his authorities to rip open the abdomens of the pregnant women of the Israelites
 until he killed something around twenty thousand babies, but he could not
 kill Moses because God had saved him.
 <br>As attributed to Ibn-`Abbâs that he said that the Israelites
 when they got large in numbers in Egypt they turned to be aggressive and
 their good went along with their bad people so God got the Egyptians to
 torture them, so it is said that to get Moses, seventy thousand child was
 killed, and when the mother of Moses was to give birth of him and the midwife
 was someone that she trusted, and when the pain began she called her and
 she came, and when Moses fell down (from the womb) she was amazed by the
 light that were between his eyes and his love got into her.
 <br>And as reported from Al-Þa`labi in his book `Arâ'is Al-Majâlis,
 he mentioned a long story that he mentioned in it: when Al-Rayyân
 ben Al-Waleed died and he was the king of the Egypt at the time of Joseph
 (PUH) and he was the one to let Joseph hold the granaries and storage houses
 and believed in God, so when he died, Qâbus ben Mos`ab became the
 second king at the time of Joseph, so then Joseph called him to believe
 in God but he refused and became a tyrant, and God took over the soul of
 Joseph at his time, and his age became longer and his kingdom expanded,
 then after him, his brother, Abul-`Abbâs Al-Waleed ben Mos`ab ben
 Al-Rayyân, became the king and he was even more tyrant than his brother
 Qâbus.
 <br>Then the Israelites after the time of Joseph (PUH) got multiplied and
 spread all over Egypt and they were under the hands of the giants, and
 they did not change their religion and whatever their fathers, Jacob, Isaac
 and Abraham, used to believe in even at the time of the pharaoh of Moses,
 and he was one of the most tyrant of the pharaohs and he had the longest
 of age and he was also the worst in his treatment for the Israelites, and
 he used to torture them and enslave them, and he divided them into types,
 one type of them is to build, and another is to work with agriculture and
 another type is to take care of dirty jobs, and he got married with a woman
 from them called Âsiyyah bent Muzâhim [bent = daughter of]
 and she was the best of women and she believed in God by the help of Moses,
 and none believed in God in Egypt save but three people. So the pharaoh
 lived and they were under his control for four hundred years, and when
 God desired to relief them He sent Moses (PUH), that is because the pharaoh
 saw in his dreams that a fire came from Jerusalem and it got into the houses
 of the Egyptians and burnt them all but it did not reach the Israelites,
 so the pharaoh called the magicians and astrologers and asked them about
 his dream so they said to him that there will be a child that will be born
 among the Israelites and he will get you with your people of your lands
 and change things and the time of his birth will be in your time, so then
 the pharaoh ordered to kill every child born among the Israelites, and
 we've mentioned that before.
 <br>And from the speech of Al-Þa`labi he mentioned that the pharaoh
 used to kill the children that were born already among the Israelites and
 those who were born later on, and he used to torture the pregnant women
 to miscarriage the babies, and death also went so fast among the elders
 of the Israelites, so fear spread all over everyone and the people of Egypt
 got scared that such thing will be applied to them soon, so the tribes
 masters of the coptic people went to the pharaoh and said to him: death
 is over taking the Israelites and you are killing their children and their
 elders are dying and it is almost reaching us as well, so then the pharaoh
 ordered that their children shall be killed for one year and leave them
 the next year, so Aaron was born in the year that no children shall be
 killed, and Moses were born in the year after when children should be killed.
 So, Aaron was born obviously but for Moses he was kept in secret, and it
 was as we mentioned before, and God is the One that cares of everything
 and He knows everything.
