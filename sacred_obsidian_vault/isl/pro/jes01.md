 <center><font size="+3">The Pregnancy of Mary With Jesus And His Birth (PUT)</font></center>
 God said: And make mention of Mary in the Scripture, when she had withdrawn
 from her people to a chamber looking East, And had chosen seclusion from
 them. Then We sent unto her Our Spirit and it assumed for her the likeness
 of a perfect man. She said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from
 thee, if thou art God- fearing. He said: I am only a messenger of thy Lord,
 that I may bestow on thee a faultless son. She said: How can I have a son
 when no mortal hath touched me, neither have I been unchaste ? He said:
 So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me. And (it will be) that
 We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it
 is a thing ordained. And she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to
 a far place. And the pangs of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the
 palm-tree. She said: Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become
 a thing of naught, forgotten! Then (one) cried unto her from below her,
 saying: Grieve not! Thy Lord hath placed a rivulet beneath thee, And shake
 the trunk of the palm-tree toward thee, thou wilt cause ripe dates to fall
 upon thee. So eat and drink and be consoled(Mariam:16-26), and in the chapter
 of Âl-`Imrân: (And remember) when the angels said: O Mary!
 Lo! Allah giveth thee glad tidings of a word from him, whose name is the
 Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, illustrious in the world and the Hereafter,
 and one of those brought near (unto Allah). He will speak unto mankind
 in his cradle and in his manhood, and he is of the righteous. She said:
 My Lord! How can I have a child when no mortal hath touched me ? He said:
 So (it will be). Allah createth what He will. If He decreeth a thing, He
 saith unto it only: Be! and it is. And He will teach him the Scripture
 and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel, And will make him a messenger
 unto the Children of Israel(Âl-`Imrân:45-49). When Mary turned
 to be an adult, and the will of God desired to show up for the tyrant ignorant
 people, He inspired to the virgin Mary to go out of her home to the landscapes
 and she isolated herself away from the people and she used to do that because
 she is shy, and suddenly the angel Gabriel came down to her as a messanger
 from God, and he came down in the form of a good young man with a nice
 shape, and she saw him and she was alone, she got so afraid of him and
 thought that he wanted to harm her, so she asked for refuge in God and
 said to him: Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou
 art God-fearing, and when Gabriel sensed her fear, he calmed her down and
 told her that he is a messanger from God to give to her the tidings of
 a faithful son. Of course she was amazed for how she can have a son without
 being touched by a human being, and Gabriel calmed her down and told her
 that this is the will of God that nothing stops in the way of His will,
 and then he blew on her dress on the top of her chest, and the air went
 into her body and into her womb and so she got pregnant by the will of
 God. So God created a human being into her womb without letting her be
 touched by a human being, as He created Adam without a father and mother,
 and He is able to do anything. It is mentioned in the chapter of Âl-`Imrân
 that the tidings were brought to her by a group of angels, and that the
 child's name is the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, and he shall be illustrious
 in the world and the Hereafter, and one of those brought near, by his prophecy,
 by his message and by his miracles like curing the blind and the leper
 and resurrecting the dead people by the permission of God, and in the after-life
 he is given the high place and brought near by lifting him up to heavens
 and accompanied with angels and he shall be of great matter. We say there
 is no opposition, because Gabriel blew into her by the command of God and
 he brought to her the happy tidings and the angels told her about it before
 and after this event. Angels used to surround her and protected her against
 the enemies and calmed her down and God showed her some of His light, so
 there is no opposition between the two holy phrases, meditate and you shall
 be a winner. As God creates everything for a reason, as well He can create
 things altogether for no apparent reason, although what we had mentioned
 is an obvious reason and the angels brought to her the tidings that her
 son shall talk to the people while he is still a child and when he is old
 enough, and God will teach him the Torah and the wisdom and shall teach
 him all the revealed books before he is sent as a prophet with the Gospel
 which had nothing like it before and it is the clue for him that he is
 sent to the people as a prophet and it is the clue for his purity and his
 mother's purity, and he shall guide them to the perfect way after they
 were on that path for some time and then went astraying and allowed what
 was prohibited by God and prohibited what was allowed by God, and he only
 came to guide them and complete them with the finest of manners.
 <br>It is mentioned by Al-Baydhâwi that the pregnancy time of Jesus
 was seven months and some said it was only six months and some said it
 was eight months, and no one being born in the eighth month and lived except
 of him, and some said that her pregnancy time was only for one hour and
 as she got pregnant with him she gave birth for him, and the one that mentioned
 this last phrase is Abdul-Wahâb Al-Najjâr and he denied all
 of the other opinions, and we don't have in our hands what makes us able
 to be sure of it with clues but it is better to believe in the normal pregnancy
 as it is with others.
 <br>It is famous that she gave birth to Jesus (PUH) in the town of Bethlehem
 that is not so far away from Jerusalem, just few kilometers, and because
 it is so famous for christians and also muslims it is not a matter to argue
 about in recent days, and no one claims something else, and the apparent
 of the holy Quran also doesn't opposes this opinion: when she had withdrawn
 from her people to a chamber looking East(Mariam:16), and her people are
 in Jerusalem, and she went away from them when she felt that she will give
 birth soon, and she ran away from the people and so no one would see her
 at the time of her delivering and she is without a husband, for her pregnancy
 was strange and weird enough and the people didn't know all of that and
 thier souls are sick, and her pregnancy is something denied by them especially
 for a woman of her type, and they considered her one of the finest people
 and this is the truth, and for this God ordered her to keep away from them
 because she will not find someone to help her among them or to have mercy
 on her while she is giving birth to a child without a father, and God appointed
 for her the place of her delivering and it was beside the dry date-palm
 to show her how Merciful He is by making the palm green again and let it
 give date which would fall down to her, all of that as calming effects
 and as to strengthen her faith, for He resurrected a dead date-palm and
 she shaked it and it gave her falling dates, sanctification be to Him how
 wonerful He is, sanctification be to Him how Merciful He is upon His maid
 and His chosen one. So she started to ask about that dead date-palm until
 the passers by guided her to it as it was told by many tidings and narrations,
 and when she reached that palm she gave birth to Jesus, and when she looked
 at him she said: Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become a thing
 of naught, forgotten!(Mariam:23), and she said: what shall I say to the
 Israelites, and Jesus then called her: Grieve not! Thy Lord hath placed
 a rivulet beneath thee(Mariam:24), and it was a short river with a spring
 for her, and her child said to her: And shake the trunk of the palm-tree
 toward thee, thou wilt cause ripe dates to fall upon thee(Mariam:25).
 <br>It is mentioned that the palm was dead long time ago, and she expanded
 her arm and shaked it with her hand and it planted leaves and beared fruit
 and the dates dropped down from it so she calmed down to see God's mercy,
 and she came to it with desire to hide herself with it after she ran away
 from her home and to count on it, all of that was by the guidance of her
 Lord. In narrations told by the Household (PUT) it is said that her child,
 Jesus, said to her: cover me and do with me so and so, and so she did and
 did whatever he told her to do for he only says what God wants and He is
 the One that made him speak to her to fill her heart with joy and turn
 her sadness into happiness, and then her son Jesus said to her: So eat
 and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say: Lo! I have
 vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and may not speak this day to any mortal(Mariam:26).
 They missed her in her place and in her champer so they went out looking
 for her with Zacharias, and then she came carrying her son close to her
 chest, and when the faithful women of the Israelites saw her with Jesus
 in her arms, they went to her mercilessly and started to spit on her but
 she didn't talk to them until she went into her champer and settled down,
 and then the Israelites came to her and Zacharias with them and they said
 to her: They said: O Mary! Thou hast come with an amazing thing, O sister
 of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a harlot(Mariam:27-28),
 and they meant to mock at her by that, and they charged her with adultery,
 and Aaron at their time was a wicked man so they made a comparison between
 her and him, and some others said that Aaron was a faithful man at their
 time and they made a comparison between the two of them as to mock at her
 for her great deed, and then they said to her: from where you got this
 child? Then she pointed out to Jesus, and they said to her: How can we
 talk to one who is in the cradle, a young boy? And God made her son Jesus
 (PUH) talk and he said: Lo! I am the slave of Allah. He hath given me the
 Scripture and hath appointed me a Prophet, And hath made me blessed wheresoever
 I may be, and hath enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving so long as I
 remain alive, And (hath made me) dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath
 not made me arrogant, unblest. Peace on me the day I was born, and the
 day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!(Mariam:30-33).
 <br>It is apparent from some narrations that the palm tree that she gave
 birth to Jesus under was a dry palm tree as we mentioned before and no
 one of the people was near by it and she had no water to drink or to wash
 herself, and she was upset and thought many times about what they would
 say to her and what they would charge her with, but the Merciful the Knower
 calmed her down and founded for her the dates from the dry palm-tree after
 that it turned into green in the winter, and founded for her the running
 water in that deserted landscape, and He is the One who is able to show
 her innocence in front of those who call her with bad names without obtaining
 the truth, and He is the One to protect her and to prove her innocence,
 and if they meditated in heavens and earth and in whatever they contain
 of wonders they wouldn't be surprised to know that Jesus was created without
 a father, and even it is not as wonderous as the creation of the human
 being from a man and a woman by a contact and not as wonderous as the creation
 of the rest of the animals with the change in their conditions, all of
 that speaks about a fine Creator that is not to be reached by the minds
 of the people, and He said: And We made the son of Mary and his mother
 a portent(Al-Mu'minun:50), and our speech is either dedicated to one of
 the disbelievers or the hypocrites, and for this they are not to be blamed
 but we are the one to be blamed for wasting time with them, and if it was
 dedicated to someone that believes in God and His miracles, then the matter
 is easy with them, and if it was dedicated to someone that doesn't believes
 miracles but believes in God then we shall say: what do you deny from God's
 deeds and He is the One who founded Adam without a father and a mother,
 and the One created Adam is able to create Jesus without a father, and
 so God said: Lo! the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of
 Adam. He created him of dust, then He said unto him: Be! and he is(Âl-`Imrân:59),
 and it is narrated that the age of Mary when she gave birth to Jesus was
 thirteen years old, and she had period only twice before pregnancy, and
 only God knows.
 <br>It is mentioned that God sent Jesus (PUH) to the Israelites in special
 and his prophecy started in Jerusalem, and his successors were the twelve
 apostles that taught the people the regulations of his religion. It is
 mentioned in the argument between Al-Hasan (PUH) and the Roman king (Caesar),
 that he (Al-Hasan) said to him: Jesus was thirty three years old and then
 God raised him up to heaven and he shall come back down in Damascus, and
 he is the one that shall kill the False Christ..etc.
