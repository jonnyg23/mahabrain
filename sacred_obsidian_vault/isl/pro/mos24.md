 <center><font size="+3">Moses Choosing Seventy Men For God's Appointed Tryst</font></center>
 It is mentioned before the story of the calf and its worshippers from the
 folks of Moses while he went away in an appointment with God to get the
 Torah and he came back to them and the tablets were in his hands and when
 he saw that they were worshipping the calf, he threw the tablets and some
 of them got broken and when Moses came calm he took the tablets and blamed
 his brother Aaron and he wanted to kill the Samarian but the will of God
 decided that he (the Samarian) should stay alive, so he banished him out
 and exiled him and the speech about it was mentioned in details, as for
 those who followed the Samarian and they were seventy thousand from his
 people as some said, they all turned in penitence and they were part of
 a total of seven hundred thousand of the people of Moses from the Israelites.
 When he wanted to get back to the mountain of Sinai to worship God there,
 his people asked him to hear the speech of God as he does, and since it
 is not possible that all shall come with him he chose only seventy men
 of them and they were considered the best for he chose seventy thousand
 out of seven hundred thousand, and then he picked seven thousand out of
 them, and so on until it reached only seventy men of their most faithful
 men, so they went with him and he made them sit at the foot of the mountain
 and he went up over the mountain, so when God talked to him after he requested
 that God let them hear Him as he does, God then dedicated His speech towards
 them and they heard it from every direction, from top and bottom and right
 and left and front and back, and when they heard that they got confused
 and their minds went out of control and they did not believe that this
 voice they heard was truely for God except of those most faithful of them
 for they did not doubt about what happened and it is indeed the speech
 of
 God, and most of them did not believe that it was the voice of God indeed
 and even they went back to Moses asking him to show them God as they do
 see each other and talk to them and God is Exalted for such things, and
 they asked that so that no doubt remains in themselves but Moses denied
 that and blamed them and told them that God is not to be seen not in this
 life nor in the after-life but his words were useless for them and they
 said to him: God then is able to show us Himself for He is able to do anything
 He desires, and for this request the lightning seized them while they were
 gazing.
 <br>They say also that when they insisted with their request and did not
 accept the excuse of Moses, God showed some of His light to the mountain
 and it turned to ruins so they all turned shocked and dead, and then God
 resurrected them after the prays of Moses and his requests for forgiveness
 towards them, so God forgave them and resurrected them by His mercy and
 power, and God destined the mercy for the faithful, those who give the
 poor and do the prayings and believe in the miracles of God and never rebel
 or oppose the commandments of God and His prophet after being into the
 belief as it is the way of the truely faithful men of the folk of Moses,
 and they are those who will follow the prophet who can neither read or
 write, who is from Mecca, that comes after him (Moses), whom they will
 find described in the Torah and the Gospel, and he is described for them
 as: He will enjoin on them that which is right and forbid them that which
 is wrong. He will make lawful for them all good things and prohibit for
 them only the foul; and he will relieve them of their burden and the fetters
 that they used to wear(Al-A`râf:157).
 <br>What is understood from God's saying: He said: I smite with My punishment
 whom I will, and My mercy embraceth all things, therefore I shall ordain
 it for those who ward off (evil) and pay the poor-due, and those who believe
 Our revelations; Those who follow the messenger, the Prophet who can neither
 read nor write..etc(Al-A`râf:156-157), is that giving notice about
 Muhammad (PUH) and his Household and that was when talking to Moses before
 their appearance for more than one thousand and five hundred years, and
 God is blaming the people of Moses of the Israelites and showing them along
 with others that He has servants not like the people of Moses in their
 harshness and tyranny, but they are people of dignity that obey His commandments
 and believe in God and His revelations without complaining, and they are
 the believers in Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad (PUT) and they
 are His special and they are the people of faith and they are those who
 are tested by God for their faith, so they are their (the prophet and his
 Household) beloved and they are the people that are loyal to them and they
 are the saved group that hold into the straight path, and they are the
 ones that God will show them for every prophet and viceroy and all the
 angels in pride, and no deeds for any male or female is to be accepted
 except by the loyality to Muhammad and his Household (PUT).
 <br>This is the truth that is held by people of wisdom in every nation
 and this is what is believed by the scholars of the righteous people of
 muslims, so the prophecy of Muhammad and his message and his name with
 his Household, Al-Zahrâ' (Fatimâ) and Al-Murtadhâ (`Ali)
 and Shubbar (Al-Hasan) and Shubayr (Al-Husain) with their grandfather the
 prophet (PUH), all are mentioned and described and the loyality towards
 them is assigned in Torah inspirte of whatever changes occured to it, and
 what we had mentioned is already mentioned in some positions in Torah in
 Hebrew in the stories of Moses, notice it and you will find it. So on it
 is the situation with the rest of the books of prophets, for it had contained
 their names and telling about them and mentioning the land that the prophet
 (PUH) will be out from and travel out from it and the land of his end,
 this is some of what was mentioned by the faithful scholars, and more to
 come by God's will later on, and there is no strength except by Him, the
 Exalted, the High.
