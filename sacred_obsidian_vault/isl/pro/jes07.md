 <center><font size="+3">The Injeel (Gospel) is A Heavenly Revealed Book</font></center>
 It is the one that was revealed from God on the heart of His servant Jesus
 the son of Mary (PUH) as He revealed the Torah on Moses ben Amram before
 him and Quran on Muhammad the chosen (PUH) after him. In some bibles it
 is mentioned that the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, was prophecised when
 he became thirty years old and some historians along with some Quran interpreters
 agreed on that.
 <br>The Gospel is a book that contained guidance and light and called the
 Israelites to get back to God and worship Him, and prophecised for them
 about future events and brought to them the good tidings of the closeness
 of the time of the prophet (PUH) that God promised the Israelites that
 He will send him to the creations with a new set of laws and he will be
 like Moses ben Amram, an owner of a separate set of laws and regulations,
 and in it (the Gospel) there are describtions for him and for his followers.
 Now, where is the Gospel of the Messiah that was mentioned in Quran: He
 hath revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture with truth, confirming
 that which was (revealed) before it, even as He revealed the Torah and
 the Gospel(Al-`Imrân:3), and in the chapter of Al-Mâ'idah:
 And We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming
 that which was (revealed) before him in the Torah, and We bestowed on him
 the Gospel wherein is guidance and a light, confirming that which was (revealed)
 before it in the Torah - a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward
 off (evil). Let the People of the Gospel judge by that which Allah hath
 revealed therein. Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed:
 such are evil-livers(Al-Mâ'idah:46-47), and God said: If they had
 observed the Torah and the Gospel and that which was revealed unto them
 from their Lord, they would surely have been nourished from above them
 and from beneath their feet. Among them there are people who are moderate,
 but many of them are of evil conduct(Al-Mâ'idah:66), Say O People
 of the Scripture! Ye have naught (of guidance) till ye observe the Torah
 and the Gospel and that which was revealed unto you from your Lord(Al-Mâ'idah:68),
 and God said: Those who follow the messenger, the Prophet who can neither
 read nor write, whom they will find described in the Torah and the Gospel
 (which are) with them(Al-A`râf:157), and God said: Such is their
 likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel - like as sown corn
 that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and riseth firm upon
 its stalk(Al-Fat-h:29), and in the chapter of Al-Hadeed: Then We caused
 Our messengers to follow in their footsteps; and We caused Jesus, son of
 Mary, to follow, and gave him the Gospel..etc(Al-Hadeed:27), there are
 many holy phrases in the chapters of the Quran that tell that the Gospel
 is only one heavenly revealed book and no more.
 <br>Is it there then, the Gospel that the Messiah brought and gave it to
 his followers and ordered them to spread it? Yes there are the Gospels
 of Mattâ (Matthew) and Murqus (Mark) and Luqâ (Luke) and Yohannâ
 (John) and these are the gospels that are taken by the chrisitans in the
 Church and they work by them, and from them some of the sermons that was
 spoken by the Messiah reached the world, and these four gospels are selected
 from a large number of other gospels and they were chosen because most
 of the bishops agreed on them, and they tell his (the Messiah) stories
 and his speeches and sermons and his miracles that God showed upon his
 hands, and they include also advices for people to worship the One God
 and to obey His commandments and to the goodness of treatment among the
 people and to be humble and far away from pride and wrong, and also they
 order to do the best for the goodness and not to chase life and its ornamentations
 and to consider oneself as a guest or a passerby, and the traveller don't
 build castles, and he who gave himself to worship God how come shouldn't
 he depend on God and not satisfied with God and how come he shall fight
 God and complain about Him to His creations? And he should not spend his
 life thinking of his food and drink and his home and clothes while he claims
 that God is the One that takes care of him, and this is an example of what
 the Gospel contains of manners and morals, and it is apparent that nothing
 of it was written at the time of the Messiah but they were all written
 after him, and done by some of his followers and their followers as well,
 and they wrote many stories and whoever write one book he would call it
 a gospel until there were about one hundred gospels as some said.
 <br>The Church chose of them what doesn't oppose its desires and made it
 legal and closed its eyes in front of the differences among them, and they
 said that all the gospels have no discrete chain (of attributers) and there
 is no single one found with the handwriting of its own author, look at
 what was written by Rahmatullah Al-Hindi about the four gospels in the
 book of Izhâr Al-Haq:
 <center><b>The gospel that is attributed to Matthew now is the first of
 the gospels and the oldest one for them (christians), it was not of his
 work but even what he wrote has no traces now because as people of wisdom
 know, it was written in Hebrew and not in Arabic and it was lost and the
 one that is translated now is weakly attributed back to him, and the name
 of the translator was not known and it is said that Jerome which is one
 of their (christians) most virtuous men of old, and they mentioned in the
 book of Al-Fâriq Bayn Al-Makhlooq W'Al-Khâliq [The difference
 between the created and the Creator], some matters related to this subject
 and assure what we've mentioned with clues that proves we are right about
 what we've just mentioned, check back the book of the Tales of the Prophets
 for `Abdul-Wahâb Al-Najjâr page 400, the third edition.</b></center>
