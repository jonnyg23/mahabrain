 <center><font size="+3">People of The Cave and The Inscription (Seven Sleepers
 of Ephesus)</font></center>
 God said: Or deemest thou that the People of the Cave and the Inscription
 are a wonder among Our portents? When the young men fled for refuge to
 the Cave and said: Our Lord! Give us mercy from Thy presence, and shape
 for us right conduct in our plight(Al-Kahf:90-10), and then: And (it is
 said) they tarried in their Cave three hundred years and add nine(Al-Kahf:25).
 The most famous narration is that the people of the cave were seven and
 the eighth was there dog and they are from a roman city that was called
 Aqsus (Ephesus) and they had a good king but he died and they got weak
 and differ among themselves after that, and then a king from Persia that
 was called Daqyânus [Decius, Dacius] arrived with one hundred thousand
 soldiers and invaded Ephesus and made it as a capital for him and built
 a castle that got an area of a league by league and built in that castle
 a court that was one thousand cubit by one thousand cubit of area and all
 made of glass. The talk about that is long and no need to mention it here
 for no use of it but to take what is required for this matter, and some
 of what they said is that in the castle there were four thousand golden
 cylinders and one thousand lamps made of gold and connected with chains
 made of silver, and he made for himself a golden bed with its legs made
 of silver and spotted with jewels and to his left and right he made chairs
 made of gold and silver for the scholars and the priests and the rulers
 and workers and also he had servants and made them wear the silky clothes
 and made crowns for them and made them stand over his head with golden
 columns whenever he wanted to sit in his court, and he chose six servants
 as ministers for himself and made three of them to his right and three
 of them to his left and the names of them were: Tamlikhâ (Malcus),
 Mixelmina (Maximian), Martoolus (Martinian), Ninonus (John?), Sârinus
 (Saraphim) and Daryunus (Dionysius?), and he used to ask for their advice
 in most of his matters and they were so close to him, and he made them
 above all for certain characteristics that they had and no one did, and
 then there is a long story about the conditions of this king with amazing
 and weird matters showing how tyrant he was and how arrogant. It is told
 by the prince of believers (PUH) by the way of the prophet (PUH) as been
 told by the Archangel (Gabriel) (PUH) as said by God, and this narration
 was told by the way of Ibn `Abbâs and it was at the time of the first
 caliphate [first caliphate was Abu-Bakr] when a group of jewish rabbis
 came to him and asked him about the keys of heaven and what are they, and
 who warned his people and it wasn't of people nor djinn, and five things
 that walked upon the face of earth and weren't created in the wombs, and
 some other stuff. The narrator said: the principle knocked down his head
 and appointed the prince of believers, `Ali ben Abi-Tâlib (PUH) to
 answer the questions and he did answer them according to what was mentioned
 in their Torah, and after each answer he did ask them: isn't that mentioned
 in your Torah? and they said: yes it is as you mentioned exactly, and one
 of the questions was about the people of the cave and the inscription and
 about their king and their land and their names and what were their jobs
 and what was their end and how it was with them when they left their jobs
 and got out of their land, and the prince of believers (PUH) answered all
 of that with details until they got amazed for it was exactly as it was
 mentioned in their Torah, and some of it was: and when the king looked
 at what God gave him, he turned to be a tyrant and called himself a god
 instead of the true God, and called for that all of his nobles so whoever
 obeyed him he would give him gifts and whoever denied so he would kill
 him.
 <br>He made for them in each year a festival, and while it was their festival
 and the priests were on his right and the rulers to his left, they told
 him that the persians are invading and the sadness got him badly that the
 crown fell down from his head, and then Tamlikhâ (Malcus) looked
 at him and he was one of the three men to his right and then he said to
 himself: if Dacius was a god as he claims then he shouldn't be sad and
 wouldn't be afraid and wouldn't eat or drink and wouldn't sleep even, and
 those things are not deeds of a god, and those six ministers used to gather
 everyday in a place that belongs to one of them whenever Dacius didn't
 need them and at that time they were in Malcus's place having something
 to eat, and he said to them: O brothers, there is something in my heart
 that kept me away from drinking and eating, and they said to him then:
 and what is that? he then said to them: I've looked for long time into
 the sky and I asked who did build it and lift it up high without pillars
 and without something to hang it with, and who made a sun and moon to run
 in it and who did ornament it with stars, and then I looked to earth and
 thought about it for long time and I asked who did make it plane over the
 waters and who kept it with mountains and I thought for long time about
 myself and asked who did made me out of my mother's womb as a child and
 who did feed me and who did make me grow, those things have another maker
 other than the king Dacius. After he spoke these words, they fell down
 over his legs kissing them and said: by you God had guided us so then tell
 us what to do? Then Malcus got up and sell some fruit from his own garden
 by three thousand coins and he put them into a bag and they went up their
 horses and got out of the city, and when they were away for three miles,
 Malcus said to them: O brothers, the after-life came and the ornaments
 of life are gone, get off your horses and walk by your legs may God give
 you a relief, so then they got off and walked for seven leagues until a
 shepherd met them and they said to him: would you give us some milk or
 water, and then the shepherd said to them: I have what you like, but I
 see that your faces like those of kings and I think you are running away
 from Dacius, and he asked many times until they made him to promise, and
 they told him their story and he fell down on their legs kissing them and
 he told them that he felt in his heart what they felt in his heart, and
 then he got the sheeps back to their owners and he came back with a dog
 following him. Then the one asking the prince of believers (PUH) asked:
 O `Ali what was the name of the dog and what was his color? Then said the
 prince of believers (PUH): the dog was white with some black spots and
 his name was Qatmeer, and then the men feared that the dog would make them
 obvious for others by his barking and they threw stones on him and then
 God made the dog speak and he said to them: let me guard you against your
 enemies. Then they went along until they reached a cave that was called
 Al-Waseed, and inside the cave there were some trees and springs, so they
 ate from the fruit and drank some of the water and night came over and
 they remained in the cave and the dog at the cave's entry, and God then
 commanded the angel of death to take out their souls and commanded some
 angels to flip them to the left and right, and it is a long story and Quran
 mentioned in brief the main points of it.
 <br>In general, Dacius then checked them out and asked about them and he
 had been told that they escaped away, so he went after their traces until
 he reached the cave and he saw them lying like dead he built the door of
 the cave and blocked it and said: if I wanted to punish them more I would
 be able to punish them more than what they had punished themselves. Then
 they remained like that for three hundred and nine years as it was told
 by Quran, and then God resurrected them and they found the spring dry as
 well as the trees and they were amazed for that and hunger overtook them,
 and Malcus went then to bring some food for them and they were afraid that
 anyone else would be captured, so he wore the clothes of the shepherd so
 that no one would identify him, and when he reached the city he saw many
 things changed and saw many roads that he didn't see before and he saw
 a flag that was written on it "La Ilaha Illa Allah, 'Eesâ Rasool
 Allah" (No god but God, Jesus is the prophet of God). Then he went into
 the city and went to a baker and asked him about the city's name and he
 answered: Aqsus (Ephesus), then he asked about the king and he answered:
 his name is `Abdul-Rahmân, and then he paid for him one coin for
 the bread and the man was amazed for its weight and shape. Then they took
 Malcus and got him into the king's court and he told the king about his
 story and that his friends are in the cave and the people got amazed and
 started to kiss his hands and feet, and then they went to the cave and
 before reaching it, Malcus went into the front so that his folks won't
 get scared and think that their enemies reached them, and when he told
 them the story they said: O Malcus, want to make us an argument for the
 worlds? Then they chose that God would take their souls and so they prayed
 for that and He answered their prayers and He knocked down the entry of
 the cave against people, and then the faithful king came with group of
 people and built a mosque (temple, church) over that place.
 <br>Then said the prince of believers (PUH) to the rabbi that asked: does
 it coincide with what was mentioned in your Torah? and he answered: you
 didn't add a letter nor neglected a letter and I testify that no other
 god but God and that Muhammad is His servant and His prophet. That was
 the end of the narration as it was mentioned exactly for sometimes and
 by the general meaning for other times. Also, the prince of believers (PUH)
 did visit them with a group of people and a group of the prophet's folks
 and he did so by a command from the prophet (PUH) and he spoke to them
 and they spoke to him and he asked them and they did ask him and he told
 them the greets of the prophet (PUH) as it was told in some narrations
 that were told by trusted scholars, and Al-Þa`labi mentioned that
 in his interpretations and he mentioned as well miracles of the prophet
 (PUH) and of the prince of believers (PUH). And as attirbuted to Al-Sâdiq
 (PUH) that he said that the people of the cave kept their faith a secret
 and showed their disbelieving so their reward for showing the disbelieving
 was greater than keeping the faith as a secret.
 <br>As for the inscription, as attributed to `Ali ben Ibrahim that they
 were two boards of copper that was written on them the story of the men
 and what Dacius wanted from them and how was their end. Some said that
 Al-Raqeem (The Inscription) was the name of the valley that had that cave.
 Some said that it was the name of the village that they went out from.
 Some said that the people of Al-Raqeem (The Inscription) are those three
 people  that went into a cave and it was blocked by a stone and they
 were saved by saying the best of their deeds and those three are different
 from the men of Dacius with the shepherd that joined them. Quran didn't
 mention them but history and the narrations told by the Household pointed
 out for their existance. As attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH) that he
 said: three people went out wandering on the lands and while they were
 worshipping God in a cave in a mountain, suddenly there showed up a rock
 that fell down and blocked the cave, so some of them said: O servants of
 God, by God nothing will save you from this unless you mention what you
 did purely for the sake of God, and then everyone of them started to mention
 what they did purely for the sake of God, and when all of them said what
 they have, God then made a relief for them and the rock was removed from
 the cave's entry by the power of their faith, and it was another story,
 and thanks be to God the One who brings success.
