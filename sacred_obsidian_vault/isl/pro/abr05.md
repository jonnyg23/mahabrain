 Books of Abraham (PUH) and Some of What Was Revealed By God to Him<br>
 </a></big></big></big>
 <div style="text-align: left;"><big><small>God had revealed for Abraham
 twenty books as reported from the prophet (PUH), and he (the prophet)
 was asked about their contents so he said: they were all proverbs and
 it had: O you egoist king of many troubles, I did not send you to
 gather earth all together, but I sent you to answer the calls of the
 wronged, for I do answer his calls even if he was a disbeliever, and
 every man of thought unless he was sick, he got three hours a day, an
 hour for his God, and an hour to judge himself, and an hour to think
 about God's deeds to him, and one more hour for him to take what he
 likes by ways that God did allow,for this hour helps him to accomplish
 the other hours. The man of thought should live for three: to make a
 living, to get prepared for his after-life, or to get satisfied in ways
 that God allowed. Then a man asked the prophet (PUH): and what was
 there in the books of Moses (PUH)?, he (PUH) answered: they were all
 examples (lessons) and they contained: I am amazed for the one who is
 certain of death, how come he becomes happy? And for whoever is certain
 of hell and fire, how come he laughs? And whoever sees this life and
 its fluctuations how come he is certain of safety? And for whoever that
 believes in destiny how come he runs after wealth and riches? And for
 whoever that is certain of the judgement, why he doesn't work for that
 day?...etc.<br>
 <br>
 Some tidings about the interpretation of God's saying: </small></big><a name="006_075">Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and
 the earth(Al-An`âm:75) as reported from Al-Bâqir (PUH) a
 speech that </a>has the meaning of that God gave Abraham a strength in
 his sight to see what is beyond heavens so he saw the Throne and whats
 beyond it and saw the earth and what was beneath it, and so God did
 with his beloved the prophet (PUH) and the viceroys after him from his
 Household (PUH). In some other tidings that Abraham (PUH) saw an angel
 so he asked: who are you? He answered: I am the angel of death, so then
 Abraham said to him: can you show me in what shape do you take the soul
 of a faithful man? Then said the angel of death: turn your face to the
 other way, and so did Abraham and then he looked back again at him and
 he saw a young man with a nice shape and beautfil clothes and with good
 scent, then said Abraham: if the faithful man idn't see in his life
 except your shape then he had what he desires in this life, then he
 said to him: can you show me how your shape would be if you're going to
 take the soul of a disbeliever? So he answered: you won't bear it, but
 Abraham said: yes I d, and so the angel said: then turn your face away
 from me and so he did and looked back at him and then he saw a blackman
 with standing hair and an awful smell with black clothes and flames
 with smokes going out from his mouth and nose, so when Abraham saw this
 he went into a coma, and then he woke up and saw the angel back again
 to his original shape so he said to the angel: O angel of death if the
 disbeliever just saw your shape he would stop doing wrongdoings in his
 life.<br>
 It is reported from Al-Sâdiq (PUH) back from the prince of
 believers (PUH) that he said: when God wanted to take the soul of
 Abraham (PUH) He sent down the angel of death and he said to him: Peace
 upon you Abraham, he then answered: and peace upon you O angel of
 death, did you come to me as an inviter or to announce my death? So he
 answered: but as an announcer for your death O Abraham so answer the
 call, then he said: O angel of death did you see a friend that makes
 death to his friend? So then the angel of death got back until he stood
 between the hands of God, the Exalted and said: O God You heard the
 talk of Your friend Abraham, so then God did say: O angel of death go
 back to him and ask him: did you ever saw a lover than don't want to
 see his love? The great scholar Al-Sayid Ne`matullah Al-Jazâ'iri,
 the one who mentioned this story, said: inviter here is meant to be as
 for someone asking and giving the choices as if someone is inviting
 some guests, and a death announcer is meant to be as someone getting
 what he desires by force. So when Abraham (PUH) knew that he has the
 choice, he asked for life to worship God more.<br>
 We say yes, and such thing would be done by a man like Abraham (PUH)
 naturally, and it is possible that he had done such a thing as if he
 couldn't imagine the situation and got afraid of moving from one world
 to another and there is the grave and the loneliness and judgement, did
 you not think about the saying of our prophet (PUH) and his Household
 (PUT): Whenever a faithful increase in his faith, the more fearful he
 becomes for God? There are certain tidings and speeches of certain
 origin and all agreed on their contents that denotes that a believer is
 in between fear and hope from God as the hands of a balance. Every
 prophet is scared to the maximum of God and at the same time he has the
 maximum hope and faith in His mercy. In tidings it is mentioned that
 when Al-Bâqir (PUH) at the time of his death cried, and then his
 son, Al-Sâdiq (PUH), said to him: O father why are you crying? So
 he answered him: for two things, the first is for leaving the beloved
 and the second is for the greatness and holiness of this situation.
 Then the most apparent clue for this matter, look to the pray of
 Abi-Hamza Al-Þumâli, and it is the pray of `Ali ben
 Al-Husain (PUH). Whoever investigated the lives of prophets and
 viceroys and their followers he would be sure of what we've mentioned
 and I think that Abraham refused to move from this life to the
 after-life because the situation was so holy and great for him, and if
 he was to live all the age of life itself he would spend it as a
 worshipper and obeying God without a doubt.<br>
 Yes, Al-Husain ben `Ali (PUH) at the day of Karbala at the time of his
 death and when Al-Shemer ben Ði Al-Jawshan sat over his holy chest,
 he (PUH) was smiling and the halo filled his face, and he did not care
 about what they did to him beside raising the truth and showing the
 true and the false. Can you imagine how the angel of death faced him? I
 think he was crying as well. Shiites after his death kept saying as
 reported to him (PUH):<br>
 <div style="text-align: center;"><big>If the religion of Muhammad won't
 be fixed except by killing me<br>
 Then O swords come and take me<br>
 </big>
 <div style="text-align: left;"><big><big><big><a name="021_071"><small><small><small>Yes
 some tidings say that Abraham made a pilgrimage to the Holy House at
 the end of his life, and after the pilgrimage he went back to the lands
 of Shem, and then the angel of death came to him to take his soul but
 Abraham hated death, so the angel of death got back to his Lord and
 said: Abraham hated death, so God then said to him: let go of Abraham,
 he likes to worship me. Then he (Abraham) saw an old man eating and
 vomitting whatever he eats, so then Abraham hated life and loved death,
 then he went into his home and saw a man with a good shape that he
 never saw something like it before, so he asked him: who are you? He
 answered: I am the angel of death, so then he said: O Holy Lord! Who
 hates your closeness and visiting you and you are in such a shape? So
 he answered: O friend of God, if God wanted goodness for His slave, He
 sends me in this shape, and if He wants evil for His slave, He sends me
 in another shape, and so he took his soul in the lands of Shem where
 his tomb lies now.<br>
