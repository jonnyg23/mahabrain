 <center><font size="+3">Khâlid ben Sinân Al-`Absi</font></center>
 He was in the period of time between the Messiah and Muhammad ben `Abdullah
 (PUH), and he is Khâlid ben Sinân ben `Atab ben `Abs, and the
 prophet (PUH) mentioned him and said: he was a prophet that was lost by
 his people. They say that a fire showed up among the Arabs and they were
 amazed for it and it was moving, and they almost turned to magii, and then
 Khâlid ben Sinân took a stick and put it over the fire and
 said: the beginning of everyone of religion shall be ended to God, and
 then he said: I shall go inside it and it is burning and I shall go out
 of it without a harm, and so he did and extinguished it, and when it was
 the time of his death, he said to his brothers: if I died and buried, then
 shall come a group of wild asses and in front of it there will be an ass
 with a cut off leg and it shall knock my grave with its hoof, so when you
 see this then dig my grave and I shall come out for you and I shall tell
 you about the future and what shall happen, and when he died and they buried
 him, they saw what he said and when they wanted to dig him out and some
 of them hated that and said: we are afraid that other tribes shall talk
 about us for digging a grave of a dead man, so they left him, and his daughter
 then came to the prophet (PUH) and she heard him saying: Say: He is Allah,
 the One!(Al-Ikhlâs:1), and she said: my father used to say this,
 as it is narrated in Muruj Al-Ðahab for Al-Mas'udi. As attributed to
 Al-Sâdiq (PUH) that he said: while the prophet (PUH) was sitting,
 there came a woman and so he (PUH) welcomed her and let her sit beside
 him and then he said: the daughter of a prophet that was lost by his people,
 he is Khâlid ben Sinân who called them to worship God but they
 didn't believe in him, and there was a fire that was called fire of Al-Hadþân
 that used to come and eat some of them and it had a certain time to occur,
 so Khâlid said to them: if I turned away its harm, would you all
 believe in me? They said: yes, and then it came about and he received it
 with his own clothes and he kept it away, and then he followed it until
 it went inside its cave and he went inside with it and they sat at the
 step of the cave and they thought he will never go out and he said then:
 the tribe of `Abs claimed that I shall never go out, and then he said to
 them: shall you believe in me? and they answered: no! He then said: then
 I'm going to die in that day of so and so and when I die then bury me and
 then shall come a group of wild asses lead by a wild ass that is missing
 one leg and it shall stop over my grave, and if you saw that then dig my
 grave and ask me forever you want, and so when he died they buried him
 and then came the group of the wild asses and they wanted to dig his grave
 and then some of them said: you didn't believe in him when he was alive
 how shall then you believe in him after his death, and if you did so and
 dag his grave that would be a shame for you so leave him alone, and so
 they did.
 <br>In that period of time there were others that it was said that they
 are prophets and some said that they were faithful believers and one of
 them was Handhalah ben Safwân and he was a descendant of Ishmael
 ben Abraham (PUT) and God sent him to the dwellers of Ar-Rass [please check
 the chapter of Al-Furqân:38] and they were descendants of Ishmael
 ben Abraham (PUT) and they were made of two tribes, one was called Idmân
 and the other Yâmin and that was in Yemen, and Handhalah did what
 he was commanded with by God and they killed him and then they were invaded
 by Nebuchadnezzar, and they say that these holy phrases were revealed telling
 their story: And, when they felt Our might, behold them fleeing from it!
 (But it was said unto them): Flee not, but return to that (existence) which
 emasculated you and to your dwellings, that ye may be questioned. They
 cried: Alas for us! we were wrong-doers. And this their crying ceased not
 till We made them as reaped corn, extinct(Al-Anbiyâ':12-15).
 <br>Some of them also Habeeb Al-Najjâr, and he used to live in Antakya
 (Antoioch), and there was in it a tyrant king that used to worship the
 idols, so two of the Messiah's apostles went to him and they called him
 back to God and to work with His obedience so he put them in jail and beat
 them and then God supported them with a third man as it was mentioned in
 Quran in the chapter of Ya Sin, and people differed about the identity
 of the third one and lot of them thought that he is Peter who was one of
 the Messiah's apostles, and some said that he is Paul, and the other two
 were Tuma (Thomas) and Peter. Talking about them would be so long and of
 no use and we've pointed out about their story in God's saying: When We
 sent unto them twain, and they denied them both, so We reinforced them
 with a third(Ya Sin:14), and they had a great affair with the king for
 what they showed of miracles and they said that they used to cure the blind
 and the leper and resurrect the dead by the permission of God, and then
 Peter and Paul were crucified and put upside down in a roman city. As for
 Habeeb Al-Najjâr he was well-known for his sincerity and faithfulness
 for God and known for his work by the laws of the prophet and their books
 and he did many services that God shall thank him for, and in some interpretations
 and history books it is mentioned that he was a fighter for God and was
 trusted by all the believers, and talking about him would need special
 explaining.
 <br>In that same period also, there was Waþþâb Al-Sanâ,
 and he was from the tribe of `Abd-Qays, and he was a believer in the religion
 of the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, before the appearance of the prophet
 Muhammad (PUH), and also there was As`ad Abu-Karb Al-Himyary, and he was
 a believer and believed in the prophet (PUH) before he (the prophet) is
 sent, and he said about him:
 <center><b>I testify that Ahmad *** is a prophet from Allah the Creator</b>
 <br><b>and if my age is expanded to his time *** I shall be a minister
 for him and a cousin</b>
 <br><b>and shall force everyone on *** this earth to obey him from Arabs
 and foreigners</b></center>
 and he was the first one to cover the Holy House (Ka`bah).
 <br>There was also Qis ben Sâ`idah, and he was the son of Iyâd
 ben Nizâr ben Mu`ad ben `Adnân (PUH), and he was a wiseman
 and well-known among the Arabs and he was their physician, and he believed
 in the resurrection and he was the one that said: who lived died and who
 died shall come and everything coming shall be coming, and Arabs mentioned
 many proverbs telling his wisdom. It is mentioned that a group of people
 from the tribe of Iyâd came to the prophet (PUH) and he asked them
 about him and they said he is dead, so he (PUH) said: may the mercy of
 God be upon him. It is narrated by the prophet (PUH): it is like I am looking
 at him in the market of `Ukkâdh [a famous market for Arabs of ancient
 where poets used to compete] riding a red camel of his and he is saying:
 O people gather together and listen and understand, who lived died and
 who died shall come  and everything coming shall be coming, and then,
 in the skies there are news to be told and in the earth there are sermons
 to be taken, and stars that are revolving and seas that are boiling and
 an uplifted roof and a road that was made, and I swear by God truely, that
 there is a religion for God that is better than this one you are believing
 in, why do I see them going and never coming back? are they satisfied with
 their staying and settled down or they were left and slept? many roads
 and different deeds, and then he (the prophet PUH) said a poem:
 <center><b>In the old days *** we have sermons</b>
 <br><b>when I saw incomes *** for death that have no resources</b>
 <br><b>and I saw my people to them *** their first and last are going</b>
 <br><b>past is not to be back *** and none of the old shall remain</b>
 <br><b>then I knew that *** I shall be where the others were</b></center>
 Al-Mas'udi said in Muruj Al-Ðahab: then said the prophet of God (PUH):
 may God has mercy upon Qism how I wish that God resurrect him in a nation.
 And he (Qis) had many poems and sermons and tidings with the caesar of
 the romans about medicine and education and many topics of wisdom. To obtain
 his conditions and stories that would need a whole new book alone, may
 God have mercy upon him.
 <br>In that period also there was Zayd ben `Amr ben Nufail and he was the
 cousin of `Umar ben Al-Khattâb [the second caliphate for Sunni muslims]
 and this Zayd didn't worship the idols and used to mock at them, and then
 his uncle Al-Khattâb attacked him and used to harm him and he made
 the silly people of Mecca hurt him, so then he lived in a cave in Hirâ'
 and used to get into Mecca by secret and then he travelled to the lands
 of Canaan to look after the religion and then a king of the Ghassanides
 [Ghassanides: rulers of the lands of Ghassân who were under the rules
 of the romans and their main capital was in Damascus] poisoned him in Damascus.
 <br>Also in the time between the Messiah (PUH) and the prophet (PUH) there
 was Umayyah ben Abi Al-Silt Al-Þaqafi, and he was a poet and a wiseman
 and used to trade in the lands of Canaan and he read many books and he
 was sure that there will be a prophet that shell be sent from the Arabs,
 and used to say poems describing the skies and earth and the sun with the
 moon and the angels and mentioning the prophets and the resurrection and
 paradise with hell and sanctify God and some of what he said was:
 <center><b>Thanks be to God who has no companions *** who never said it
 then he wronged himself</b></center>
 and he described the people of paradise by saying:
 <center><b>No gossip and no bad in it *** and whatever they say is there
 for them</b></center>
 and he had many poems describing the doomsday and the judgement and its
 fears and the fear of God and he told about his belief and his faith about
 God and some of what he said about that:
 <center><b>Doomsday is a great day *** the young shall be old for long
 time</b>
 <br><b>Wish I was when it happened for me *** that I was on mountains taking
 care of sheeps</b>
 <br><b>Every living however long it was *** shall then some day of short
 go away</b></center>
 and so on with his beautiful describtions that points out how faithful
 he was and how good he was in fighting his own soul and his own devil,
 and Al-Mas'udi in Muruj Al-Ðahab talked about him for so long, check
 it out.
 <br>Some of them was also Waraqah ben Nofal ben Asad ben `Abdul-`Uzzâ
 ben Qusay and he was the cousin of Khadeejah bent Khuwaylid, the wife of
 the prophet (PUH) and he read the books and asked for the wisdom and left
 away the worshipping of idols and he brought the happy tidings to Khadeejah
 about the prophet (PUH) and that he shall be the prophet of this nation
 and he shall be hurt and disbelieved in, and he met with the prophet (PUH)
 and said to him: O son of my brother, be firm with what you are doing,
 I swear by who has the soul of Waraqah in His hand, you are the prophet
 of this nation and they shall hurt you and disbelieve you and drive you
 out and fight against you, but if I lived to that day I shall bring victory
 to God, and he praised the prophet (PUH) and said: he forigves and never
 answer back for a sin, and keep the anger whenever being cursed or mad
 at.
 <br>Some of them also was `Addâs, the servant of `Utbah ben Abi Rubay`ah
 and he was in Nineveh, and also Abu Qis Surmah ben Abi Anas from the tribe
 of Al-Najjâr, and he turned to be a priest and left the idols and
 he built a mosque (temple) that no poluted nor a woman with period would
 get into, and he said: I worship the God of Abraham, and when the prophet
 (PUH) went to Medina, he turned into Islam and he was a faithful muslim.
 Some of them also was Abu `Âmir Al-Awsi and he was the father of
 Abu-Handhalah, the one washed by the angels, and he turned into a priest
 before Islam, and when the prophet (PUH) came to Medina he had with him
 a long story as said by Al-Mas'udi, and then he went out with fifty servants
 of his and died among the christians in the lands of Canaan.
 <br>In that period also there was `Abdullah ben Jahsh Al-Asadi and he was
 from the tribe of Asad ben Khuzaymah, and with him was Um Habeebah the
 daughter of Abi Sufyân ben Harb before that the prophet (PUH) marries
 her, and he read many books and was inclined to christianity, and when
 the prophet (PUH) was sent, he immigrated to Abyssinia with others that
 immigrated to there with his wife Habeebah, and then he left Islam and
 turned into christianity and he died in Abyssinia, and there is a long
 story about him.
 <br>In that period of time also there was Buhayrah the priest, and he was
 a believer that followed the religion of the Messiah, Jesus the son of
 Mary (PUT), and the christians used to call him Jerjees and he was from
 the tribe of `Abd Al-Qays, and when the prophet (PUH) went out with his
 uncle Abi Tâlib to the lands of Canaan in a trade, and he was twelve
 years old that time, they passed by Buhyrah while he was in his home and
 he knew the prophet (PUH) by his describtions and by signs that he had
 in his book such as the cloud that used to make a shade for him wherever
 he sits, and when they approached him he got down to them and hosted them
 and made some food for them and he looked at the ring of prophecy between
 his (the prophet's) shoulders so then he put his hand on him and he believed
 in him, and then Buhayrah told his companions about his story and what
 shall he be and then asked his uncle Abu Tâlib to get back with him
 as soon as possible and to be aware from the people of the Scripture, and
 when the prophet (PUH) got back to Mecca from that trip, he told the people
 about what happened between him and the priest and about the signs of his
 prophecy. That was something of what was there in the time between the
 Messiah (PUH) and the prophet (PUH) and peace be upon all of the prophets.
 <br>In that time period there were lot of people and might be millions
 of them, but the purpose is to mention in general who was close to God
 or the prophets and we've mentioned just a few of them to point out that
 there were lot of believers and faithful people and to point out that God
 never leaves earth without goodness and so people won't have something
 to oppose God with but He has all the clues over all the people.
 <br>What we've mentioned is some of what we've found and some of what Al-Mas'udi
 copied and what we missed is even greater and the knowledgement of it is
 only known by Him, who knows His servants and His lands the best and He
 knows everything. This is in general the completeness of the talk about
 the conditions of the prophets and the messangers that were mentioned in
 Quran directly or by signs and some of them were not mentioned in Quran
 but they had great effects and the laws assured their existance as being
 the proves of God for all the people and they tell about Him so that people
 won't have any excuse, and God said: We never punish until we have sent
 a messenger(Al-Isrâ':15), and also said God: and there is not a nation
 but a warner hath passed among them(Fâtir:24). And all religions
 and all thinkers agreed upon this concept without any doubt.
 <br>Then the main poles of the prophets and their masters are: Adam, Noah,
 Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus and Muhammad (PUT). Those of Will of them
 are five and they are: Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad (PUT).
 The total of the prophets are numbered as one hundred and twenty four thousand,
 and the messangers of them were three hundred and thirteen messangers,
 some of them for the public and some of them were for privates. Some narrations
 mentioned some prophets without identifying them with a describtion or
 an ancestry or a name or even a surname and without mentioning their times
 or their places and we shall mention some of them and the details are known
 to God.
 <br>Some of them were mentioned by Al-Sayid Al-Jazâ'iri in his book
 about the tales of the prophets, and of that was something about the prophet
 of the magii, so we say and God is the Helper: it is mentioned that the
 prince of believers (PUH) was over the pulpit and he said: ask me before
 you lose me, and then stood up Al-Ash`aþ ben Qays Al-Kindi and said
 to him: O prince of believers, how do you take taxes from the magii and
 they have no scripture (book) [in Islam, only people of the Scriptures
 who believed in revealed religions like jews and christians used to pay
 taxes in exchange of protection] and no prophet was sent to them? He answered
 him: they had O Ash`aþ, and God revealed for them a book and a prophet
 and they had a king that got drunk one night and he called his daughter
 to his bed, and in the morning, his people heard about it and gathered
 at his door and they said to him: O king, you've poluted our religion and
 destroyed it so get out for us and let's apply the law over you, he then
 said to them: gather together and listen to me and I might have a way out
 of it, otherwise you shall do what you want, and so they gathered together
 and he said to them: did you know that God didn't create someone beloved
 to Him more than Adam and Eve? They said: you are right O king, then he
 said to them: didn't he (Adam) make his daughters to marry his sons and
 vice versa? They said: you are right, this is the religion and they agreed
 on it, so God then erased their wisdom from their chest and lifted the
 book away from them and they are the disbelievers and shall go into hell
 without judgement, and the hypocrites are even worse than them. Then said
 Al-Ash`aþ: by God I never heard an answer like this, and by God I
 shall never do it again.
 <br>Also it is in the tidings about the heretic who asked Al-Sâdiq
 (PUH) about the magii and whether God sent a prophet for them or not and
 the Imam said in his answer: no nation remained without a warner, and then
 he asked: tell me about the magii, were they closer to the rightness or
 Arabs were closer? He answered him: Arabs were closer to the rightness,
 because before Islam, Arabs were closer to the path of Abraham more than
 the magii, and the magii disbelieved in all the prophets and neglected
 their books and the clues in them and never applied something of what was
 mentioned in them, and the king of the magii in the early days killed three
 hundred prophets and the magii never wash themselves after polution while
 Arabs used to wash themselves after polution which was something from the
 laws of Abraham, and the magii used not to circumcise their children which
 was something of the laws of the prophets and the first one to do so was
 Abraham (PUH), and the magii didn't use to wash their dead people while
 Arabs did all of the previous, and the magii used to drop their dead people
 into the deserts while Arabs used to put them in graves, and the magii
 used to marry the mothers and the daughters and the sisters while that
 was prohibited for the Arabs, and the magii denied the Holy House and called
 it the house of Satan while Arabs used to have pilgrimage towards it and
 used to say it is the House of our Lord, and Arabs believed in Torah and
 the Gospel and used to nagotiate with the people of the Scriptures and
 deal with them and so Arabs in all situations were closer to the rightful
 religion more than the magii, and they (the magii) said about marrying
 the sisters and claimed that this was the way at the time of Adam so then
 what is their excuse for marrying the daughters and the mothers and that
 was prohibited by Adam, Noah, Moses and Jesus and the rest of the prophets
 and messangers, and in a narration attributed to the prophet (PUH) that
 he said that the magii had a prophet but they killed him and they had a
 book but they burned it and so on.
 <br>Some of the unknown prophets also was what was mentioned by the prince
 of believers (PUH) by the way of the prophet (PUH) that he said: a prophet
 that God sent to some people, remained among them for forty years but none
 did believe in him, and they had a festival and gathered in a church (temple)
 for them, so the prophet followed them and said to them: believe in God
 who created you and founded you and who has all of your matters, so they
 said to him: if you are truely a prophet then pray to God to reveal for
 us food according to the color of our clothes, and their clothes were yellow,
 so he brought a dry piece of wood and he prayed to God to feed them with
 what they asked, and God answered his pray and the wood turned green by
 the Will of God and bore fruit and that was the fruit of the apricot, so
 they ate and whoever was willing to believe in that prophet, his fruit
 would turn to be sweet and whoever willed not to believe, the fruit would
 turn out bitter.
 <br>And some of them were mentioned by Al-Ridhâ (PUH) when he said:
 God inspired to a prophet that when he wakes up in the morning, then he
 shall eat the first thing he see in his way and the second thing he shall
 meet he shall keep as a secret and the third thing he shall meet he should
 accept, and the fouth thing he shall meet he shouldn't dispair it, and
 for the fifth thing he should run away from. He said: and when it was the
 morning time, he saw a great black mountain so he stood and said: God ordered
 me to eat this, and he remained in his place baffled, and then he said:
 my Lord wouldn't order me with something I can't do, so he walked to it
 and with each step it got smaller and smaller and when he reached it, it
 was so small, so he took it and ate it and found out that it was the most
 tasteful thing he ever ate, and he went in his way and then saw a bowl
 made of gold and he said: God ordered me to keep it as a secret, so he
 dag a hole and buried it and went away and when he looked back he saw it
 again and then he said: I did what my Lord commanded me, and he went along.
 Then he saw a bird that was chased by a hawk and the bird revolved around
 him and he said: my Lord ordered me to accept him, so he opened his sleeve
 and the bird went inside, and the hawk said to him then: you took my prey
 and I was chasing it for days, and the prophet said then: my Lord ordered
 me not to put this one to dispair, so he slew the bird and cut off its
 thigh and threw it for the hawk and went away. Then in his way he saw a
 rotted meat with warms on it and he said: God ordered me to run away from
 this, and so he did. Then he went to sleep and in his dream he saw like
 someone saying to him: you did what you was ordered with so do you know
 what was it and what is the secret? and he answered: no, so he was told:
 as for the mountain, it is the anger, for if a man was angry he wouldn't
 see his level and wouldn't see himself or know it, but when he knows all
 of that and his anger is calmed down then the end of his matter would be
 like the tasteful thing you ate. As for the golden bowl, it is the good
 deed, for if a man tried to hide it and keep it as a secret God shall then
 show it to all to make it as an ornament for His servant with the rewards.
 As for the bird it is the man who comes to you with an advice so accept
 him and accept his advice, and as for the hawk it is the man that needs
 you for something so don't dispair him. As for the rotted meat, it is the
 slander so run away from it.
 <br>It is mentioned also that God inspired to one of the prophets of the
 Israelites: if you like to be with Me in the Holy Fields later on, then
 you should be in this life alone as a stranger and sad and away from the
 people like a lonely bird that sleeps alone at night time afraid of all
 other birds and only has joy with God. They say also that a prophet of
 the Israelites passed by a dead man who had some of his body under a wall
 and the other part was outside and it was eaten and torn apart by beasts
 and dogs, then he went along and got into a city and saw there a great
 man that was dead and put over a luxurious bed, so he said: O Lord, I testify
 that You are just and never wrong, and that was Your slave and never disbelieved
 in You and died in that way and this is Your slave that never believed
 in You and You made him die in that way? Then God answered him: O My servant,
 it is as you said, I am just and never wrong, that was My servant and he
 had a sin so I made him die in that way so when he meets Me he shall be
 pure of sins, and this is My slave that had done a good deed before so
 I made him die like this so that he would meet Me and he has no rights
 to be given from Me.
 <br>As attributed to Al-Ridhâ (PUH): God inspired to a prophet: if
 I was obeyed I shall be satisfied, and if I was satisfied I shall bless
 and My bless has no end, and if My commands were refused I shall be angry
 and if I am angry I shall damn, and My damnation would reach the seventh
 generation. It is also narrated that a prophet complained to God about
 his weakness, so he was told: cook meat with milk for they help the body,
 and a prophet complained to God about his weakness, so He ordered him to
 eat the mash, and a prophet complained to God about the absence of descendants,
 so He ordered him to eat eggs with meat, and a prophet complained to God
 about the harshness of the heart and the absence of tears, so God inspired
 to him to eat lentils, and so he did and his heart turned soft and his
 tears were easy to fall, and a prophet complained to God about the sadness
 so He ordered him to eat grapes, and they say that God never sent a prophet
 unless accompanied by the smell of the quince and it is mentioned that
 perfumes were included in the laws of the prophets. They say also that
 some people asked their prophet to pray to God to take off the death from
 them and so God did, and they reproduced and their homes were so narrow
 for them because of their large numbers and one man would have to feed
 his father and his grandfather and his mother and his grand grandfather
 with his son and his grandson and his grand grandson so they got busy and
 were not able to do some work, so they got back to their prophet and asked
 him to pray to God to let them back to their normal state and so he did.
 They say that once a man said to Al-Sâdiq (PUH): I hate to pray in
 their mosques (and it might not be the people of Scripture) so then Al-Sâdiq
 (PUH) said: don't hate so, because no single mosque was built unless it
 was over a grave of a prophet or a viceroy that was killed and that spot
 got some of his blood and so God loved to mention His name in that spot,
 so pray there and do your duties and whatever you missed (of prayers).
 <br>It is narrated that there are seventy prophets that are buried between
 Al-Rokn Al-Yamâni [a place in Mecca near by Kaaba] and the place
 of the Black Stone [a stone placed in Kaaba, check the story of Adam].
 And as narrated by [name not mentioned] (PUH): God inspired to a prophet
 at the time of one of the tyrants: go to this tyrant and say to him: God
 used you only to cut off the voices of the wronged for they didn't leave
 their darkness and they are disbelievers. They also say that God inspired
 to one of the prophets: there is a man named so and so, go and tell him
 that he has three fulfilled wishes and so he did, and when he told him
 he told his wife about it and she insisted on him to make one wish for
 herself and he accepted that, then she said to him: ask your God then to
 make me the prettiest woman in this time and so he prayed and her wish
 was fulfilled and her news spreaded and all the kings and the rich young
 people desired her and she then hated her husband and started to hurt him
 while he was trying to take care of her and it went so severe on him so
 he prayed to God to turn her into a dog and so she turned to a dog and
 then her children gathered together and cried and said: people are mocking
 at us because our mother is in the shape of a dog, and they asked their
 father to let their mother be in her original shape and so he did and she
 turned to her original shape, and so the three wishes were wasted. This,
 if you just meditated in what we've mentioned before, you would find the
 sermons in it and such thing are not so far away to be issued by people
 like them (the prophets) may peace be upon them and God is the Bringer
 of success and the Guider to the straight path.
 <p>This is the last thing we would like to mention about the conditions
 of the prophets that Quran mentioned them and some others except of the
 master of the prophets and the end of the messangers, the chosen one and
 the guider and the beloved of God the Lord of the worlds, so prays and
 peace shall be upon him and upon his Household, and we have the will to
 write about him by God's Will even though it may partly and also about
 his Household the purified and the chosen ones, may peace be upon them
 and him, and that if and only if God wanted us to do so and from Him comes
 the success and upon Him we shall depend.
