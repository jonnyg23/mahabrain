 <center><font size="+3">Worshipping The Calf</font></center>
 They say that when Moses went away from the Israelites to the appointment
 of his Lord to reveal the Torah and he made his brother Aaron a leader
 upon them and he promised them of a book from God, so he went along to
 what he promised and he appointed for them thirty days of absence so he
 went away and did not get back as he promised but he delayed that for forty
 complete days, and they said that Moses ran away and lied to us and they
 wanted to kill Aaron and did not accept any excuse from him, and then the
 Satan came to them in a shape of a man and said to them that Moses ran
 away from you and will never be back so gather your gold so that I shall
 make for you a god to worship, and the Samarian was one of the first people
 to cross the sea with Moses and he saw Gabriel (PUH) riding a creature
 that was like a horse and it was called Ramakah, and whenever it puts its
 hoof on the ground that spot would move, so the Samarian took a look at
 it and he was one of the best companions for Moses, so he took some of
 that sand that was under the hoof of Gabriel's riding creature to make
 it as a bless for him and he wrapped it and used to make pride of it over
 all the Israelites and it moving (the sand), so when the Satan came and
 made the calf for them out of gold he said to the Samarian: give me the
 sand that is with you, so he brought it to him and the Satan threw it inside
 the calf, and when the sand was thrown inside it turned out to be moving
 and had a sound and had hair on it, so when the Israelites saw him and
 heard its sounds they prostrated before it and they were seventy thousand
 of the Israelites, and then Aaron said to them: O folks it is a lie and
 your Lord is God so follow me and obey my command, but they said: we will
 keep on it until Moses is back.
 <br>Then they wanted to kill Aaron but he got out and stayed away from
 them until the appointment of forty days of Moses was over, and when it
 was the tenth day of Ðul-Hijjah, God revealed on Moses the tablets
 that contained what they need of regulations and laws and sermons, then
 God inspired to Moses (PUH): He said: Lo! We have tried thy folk in thine
 absence, and As-Samiri hath misled them(TaHa:85), so Moses then said: O
 Lord, the calf is made by the Samarian but what about the sounds? He, the
 Exalted, said then: from Me O Moses, when I saw them neglecting Me and
 worshipping a calf I decided to increase their ignorance, meaning as a
 test for them. Then Moses went back unto his folk, angry and sad. He said:
 O my people! Hath not your Lord promised you a fair promise? Did the time
 appointed then appear too long for you, or did ye wish that wrath from
 your Lord should come upon you, that ye broke tryst with me?(TaHa:86),
 then he threw the tablets from his hands into the ground and he took the
 beard of his brother Aaron and took his head pulling him towards himself
 and said to him: O Aaron! What held thee back when thou didst see them
 gone astray, That thou followedst me not? Hast thou then disobeyed my order?(TaHa:92-93),
 and then he (Aaron) answered: O son of my mother! Clutch not my beard nor
 my head! I feared lest thou shouldst say: Thou hast caused division among
 the Children of Israel, and hast not waited for my word(TaHa:94).
 <br>Then the Israelites said to him: We broke not tryst with thee of our
 own will(TaHa:87) (meaning not by our choice but the Samarian proposed
 so for us and if we were to be left with our own will we wouldn't do so),
 but we were laden with burdens of ornaments of the folk(TaHa:87), meaning
 their gold, and then we did put inside it the sand that the Samarian brought
 and he did make for them a calf with the sound of cows, so Moses then said
 to him: And what hast thou to say, O Samiri?(TaHa:95), he answered: I perceived
 what they perceive not, so I seized a handful from the footsteps of the
 messenger, and then threw it in. Thus my soul commended to me(TaHa:96),
 then Moses took the calf out and burned it with fire and threw it into
 the sea, and he banished the Samarian out of that land and warned him not
 to see him again or to make contact with any of the Israelites, and he
 said to him: Then go! and lo! in this life it is for thee to say: Touch
 me not!(TaHa:97), as long as you are alive and the same goes for those
 on your way and your descendants as well and it is the mark of difference
 between you and others, and they say that Moses wanted to kill the Samarian
 but God inspired to him not to kill him for he is a generous man, and they
 say his name was Musâ-Rakân [Musâ = Moses] and he was
 born out of the frame of marriage, and they say also that his descendants
 did not vanish and still there are some of them in Egypt and the lands
 of Shem and they worship the calf but they keep it as a secret among themselves
 and call themselves muslims, and their describtion in general is the same
 of that of the Samarian for at that time they did not touch anyone and
 no one touches them.
 <br>Then Moses spoke to him and said: Now look upon thy god of which thou
 hast remained a votary. Verily we will burn it and will scatter its dust
 over the sea, Your Lord is only Allah, than Whom there is no other lord(TaHa:97-98),
 and it is mentioned also that God ordered Moses to order the people not
 to stay with him or sit with him or eat with him to leave him alone, and
 it is said to him (the Samarian): do not touch us and we shall not touch
 you as long as you live, and they say that he went wandering in the wilderness
 with beasts and lions and never touch anyone and no one touched him and
 that was God's punishment for him in this life, and when he used to meet
 someone he would say: no touching! meaning do not touch me or be closer
 to me and that went along in his descendants as well, and it is said that
 their remains are still saying this upto this very day, and if someone
 else other than them would touch one of them then both would be sick with
 fever at the same time as it is said.
 <br>And As-Samiri (the Samarian) is named after Sâmir or Shâmir
 and it is the guradian as it was used at their time in both languages Hebrew
 and Arabic as it had been said and investigated about it, and Abdul-Wahâb
 Al-Najjâr said: if someone said that the man tricked the Israelites
 and took their gold and bought a calf as one of those worshipped in Egypt
 and brought it to them and then said to them whatever he had said and they
 did accept that from him and they thought that the calf is their god and
 the god of Moses and kept on worshipping it, all of that would not be far
 away from the meaning of Quran, then he said which is something I do believe
 in, the Samarian might had tricked them by taking their gold and throwing
 it into the fire to make them think that their gold was made into a calf
 and then he took all the gold for himself as any impostor would do, and
 he said also that I see that the story of the Samarian with Gabriel is
 not true and there were no Gabriel came down riding a horse-like creature
 nor the Samarian took some of the sands from under the hoof of that creature..etc,
 and all of that as you can see are just some imaginations and the truth
 is what was brought by the narrations of the Household of the path of truth,
 and it is testified by the Quran and its symbols with its interpretations
 that was brought by the Household (PUT): and the people of the house knows
 better what is inside, read with me may the mercy of God be upon you and
 complete whatever I left for you, God did say telling the story: 
 so I seized a handful from the footsteps of the messenger, and then threw
 it in. Thus my soul commended to me(TaHa:96), and it is mentioned before
 what was the meaning of this phrase, and they say that the punishment of
 the Samarian in this life was a physical punishment and that is he feels
 the pain whenever someone touches him and whenever he meets someone and
 he was afraid that he would be touches he would say: no touch! And in the
 after-life God will take care of him, and as for the ones who worshipped
 the calf from the Israelites their punishment was that God would not accept
 their repentance unless they kill each other.
 <br>As mentioned by `Ilm Al-Hudâ Al-Sayid Al-Murtadhâ about
 God's saying: and he seized his brother by the head, dragging him toward
 him..etc(Al-A`râf:50), he said: Aaron did not do something that deserves
 to do such a thing with him like seizing his head or his beard, and the
 apology of Moses then after is not a deed of silly people and not a deed
 of wisemen full of wisdom, and in general what brought such a conflict
 into the being is that in what God did say of Moses' deeds with his brother
 anything that points out to a sin done any of them, for Moses came with
 anger to his people for what they did after him and horrified by their
 deed although he did not stay away from them except of some days not a
 year nor some months but they did do the worst of things and the most silliest
 deed and the most shameful work, and they changed worshipping the Exalted
 One, with the worshipping of a created animal, so he took the head of his
 brother and pulled it towards him as when someone does when he is amazed
 for something horrible and might bite on his lips or on his finger or even
 pulls his own beard, and because Aaron is his partner in this matter and
 every good or bad would strike one of them would strike the other as well,
 for this he did with him what a man would do with himself and he (Aaron)
 is himself (Moses) and that is not an insult for Aaron and does not point
 out to a sin of Aaron and does not put down his dignity and does not affect
 the place of prophercy, and also traditions do change by time and by nations,
 and we might see something as a bad thing but for some people it is a pretty
 thing, so then Aaron said: Thou hast caused division among the Children
 of Israel..etc(TaHa:94) and in another location: Son of my mother! Lo!
 the folk did judge me weak and almost killed me(Al-A`râf:150), and
 that was an answer from him to deny this deed, meaning do not be angry
 or mad or sorry, and maybe all of that was said and done by an agreement
 between the two of them as to show the nation how great is their deed and
 make them scared.
 <br>Anyhow, it must be taken as it is although it sounds that it is not
 an approperiate thing to do as for what mentioned before and assured before
 that prophets are infallible, and it is said that when Moses got back to
 his people and they had worshipped the calf he said to them: O folks, you
 did a wrong deed to yourselves by worshipping the calf so repent towards
 your Lord and kill yourselves, so they said to him: how shall we kill ourselves?
 Then Moses said to them: go to Jerusalem and everyone of you holding a
 knife or an iron bar or a sword and when I come upon the rostrum of the
 Israelites then you shall be cautious and no one of you shall know the
 other and kill each other, and then they gathered and they were seventy
 thousand men of those who worshipped the calf and they went to Jerusalem
 and when Moses prayed with them and he went upon the rostrum, they started
 to kill each other until ten thousand men of them were killed and more
 were injured, and then Gabriel came down by God's commandment and said:
 O Moses stop the killing for God did forgive them, and so did Moses order
 them and told them that God did forgive them and God did say then: That
 will be best for you with your Creator and He will relent toward you. Lo!
 He is the Relenting, the Merciful(Al-Baqarah:54) [this previous story might
 not be accurate since it should have happened in Sinai during the Exodus
 after that God avoided the Israelites to get into the holy lands for forty
 years, this is what I, the translator, believe].
 <br>we've pointed out before that God lifted up the mountain beside them
 and made it like upon their heads and they thought that it will fall down
 on them and that was when Moses brought them the Torah and most of them
 denied accepting it for they had harsh hearts and so far away from being
 bounded by religious regulations, and because as it was said before that
 the Israelites had quite small souls for they got used to the humiliation
 under the Egyptians' rule, so they do not accept a law except by force,
 and for this their hearts were melted down into their chests and fear filled
 their souls when they were ordered to fight the giants and they are not
 good for wars or to be used, and when they were ordered to go to the holy
 lands they said to Moses: So go thou and thy Lord and fight! We will sit
 here(Al-Mâ'idah:24), and then Moses said complaining to God about
 the Israelites: My Lord! I have control of none but myself and my brother,
 so distinguish between us and the wrong-doing folk(Al-Mâ'idah:25)...so
 the mountain was raised upon the Israelites as we pointed out so that they
 thought it is falling on them, and Moses then ordered them to take the
 regulations that he brought to them with strength and stop complaining
 about it and to keep it with all their strength and to bear what they are
 given and to remember whatever was in these regulations of sayings and
 workings. If they did what is required of them then they will face the
 goodness and avoid the evil and the bad deeds, but they went away from
 the covenant after they had made it and so God did say in the chapter of
 Al-A`râf: And when We shook the Mount above them as it were a covering,
 and they supposed that it was going to fall upon them (and We said): Hold
 fast that which We have given you, and remember that which is therein,
 that ye may ward off (evil)(Al-A`râf:171) and then He said: Then,
 even after that, ye turned away, and if it had not been for the grace of
 Allah and His mercy ye had been among the losers(Al-Baqarah:64). [then
 comes some phrases explaining the meaning of the Arabic word mentioned
 about the action of the mount, but contributes nothing to the story]. Everyone
 knew that when they accepted what Moses brought and believed in it the
 mount was raised away from them, because looking at miracles makes the
 faith much stronger and moves the feelings inside oneself and for this
 he (Moses) talked to them when they saw such miracles and said: Hold fast
 that which We have given you..etc(Al-A`râf:171).
