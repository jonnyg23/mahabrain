 <div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><big><a name="014_037">Chapters
 and Phrases That Mentioned Abraham (PUH)</a></big></big></big><br>
 <div style="text-align: left;"><a name="014_037">Abraham (PUH) was
 mentioned in twenty five chapters in holy quran: Al-Baqarah,
 Âl-`Imrân, Al-Nisâ', Al-An`âm, Al-Tawbah, Hud,
 Yusuf, Ibrâhim, Al-Hijr, Al-Nahal, Mariam, Al-Anbiyâ',
 Al-Haj, Al-Shu`arâ', Al-`Ankabut, Al-Ahzâb,
 Al-Sâffât, Sâd, Al-Shurâ, Al-Zokhrof,
 Al-Ðâriyât, Al-Najm, Al-Hadeed, Al-Momtahanah,
 Al-A`lâ. In the chapter of Al-Baqarah, the Exalted says: </a><a name="002_127">And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the
 foundations of the House, (Abraham prayed): Our Lord! Accept from us
 (this duty). Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower.</a><a name="002_128">
 Our Lord! And make us submissive unto Thee and of our seed a nation
 submissive unto Thee, and show us our ways of worship, and relent
 toward us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Relenting, the
 Merciful(Al-Baqarah:127-128) In the chapter of Âl-`Imrân: </a><a name="003_096">Lo! the first Sanctuary appointed for mankind was that
 at Becca, a blessed place, a guidance to the
 peoples(Âl-`Imrân:96). In the chapter of Ibrâhim: </a><a name="014_035">And when Abraham said: My Lord! Make safe this
 territory, and preserve me and my sons from serving
 idols(Ibrâhim:35). In the chapter of Al-Haj:  </a><a name="022_026">And (remember) when We prepared for Abraham the place
 of the (holy) House, saying: Ascribe thou no thing as partner unto Me,
 and purify My House for those who make the round (thereof) and those
 who stand and those who bow and make prostration(Al-Haj:26), so follow
 (read)  and notice  (think).<br>
 We've pointed out that the story of Abraham (PUH) is connected to other
 stories like the story of Lot, and the story of his son Ishmael and the
 story of his son Isaac, and we've mentioned that Lot was his maternal
 cousin and also  his nephew and they were in the same time 
 sequence, and Lot believed in his uncle Abraham and so he was calling
 people to his religion. The Exalted said: </a><a name="029_026">And
 Lot believed him, and said: Lo! I am a fugitive unto my
 Lord(Al-`Ankabut:26). They say that Ishmael was born when Abraham was
 eighty six years old, and Abraham lived for one hundred and seventy
 five years, while Isaac was born  while Abraham was  one
 hundred years old and his mother is Sarah the maternal cousin of
 Abraham.<br>
 They say that Abraham (PUH) got another six children from other woman
 other than Sarah and Hagar, but quran did not mention apparently except
 ishmael and Isaac. Torah mentioned that Abraham married a woman called
 Keturah [Arabic: Qaturah] and she gave birth for six children for him,
 and it mentioned their names but there is no need to mention them now
 because it has no effects. In Muruj Al-Ðahab for Al-Mas`udi he
 said: After Sarah's death, Abraham married Qanturâ' [just another
 variation of the name] and he had six children from her and they are
 Marq, Nafas, Madan, Midian, Sinân and Sereh [Hebrew: Zimran,
 Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, Shuah].<br>
 Lot was mentioned in fourteen chapters in holy quran: Al-An`âm,
 Al-A`râf, Hud, Al-Hijr, AL-Anbiyâ', Al-Haj,
 Al-Shu`arâ', Al-Naml, Al-`Ankabut, Al-Sâffât,
 Sâd, Al-Qamar, Al-Tahreem. Isaac was mentioned in eight chapters:
 Al-Baqarah, Âl-`Imrân, Al-Nisâ', Al-An`âm,
 Ibrâhim, Mariam, Al-Anbiyâ', Sâd. Their stories are
 mentioned in quran either in details or in brief, sometimes mentioning
 only some of their matters, and in some others more than that, and most
 of the prophets and viceroys are mentioned in that way. They mentioned
 that Ishmael lived for one hundred and thirty seven years, and we've
 mentioned that he died in Mecca and been buried there in the place that
 is known as Hajar Isma`eel, that is the one located near by the Holy
 house, with his mother, and this is the most popular.<br>
 It is mentioned that Ishmael had twelve sons, and some of them are:
 Hadâr, Tayyim, Mibsâm, Dawmah, Qidmah and Qaydâr, and
 they are mentioned in Genesis in Torah [The full list of names in Torah
 is: Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad,
 Temah, Jetur, Naphish, Kedemah], and they mentioned that all of them
 started tribes of their own, and only God knows. Until now we did not
 find a specific way of how Abraham died and quran did not mention how,
 but Torah mentioned that. In summary, Abraham (PUH) lived for one
 hundred and seventy five years. In Muruj Al-Ðahab for Al-Mas`udi:
 Abraham died in the lands of Shem, and his age was at that time one
 hundred and ninty five years, and God revealed upon him ten books. When
 he died, his sons Isaac and Ishmael in the cave of Al-Makfeelah in the
 field of `Afroon ben Sarsar Al-Hashi, and there Sarah was buried before
 him, and it is the place of the monument of Al-Khaleel in Jirun and now
 it is called the city of Al-Khaleel (Hebron), and its old name was the
 village of Arbo` as it is mentioned in the tales of Abul-Wahâb
 Al-Najjâr.<br>
