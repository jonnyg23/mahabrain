 <font size="6"><p align="CENTER">Some of what was mentioned in the books of Enoch PUH</p>
 </font><p>From Ibn Tawoos he said: It was mentioned in the books of Enoch these sentences and they are: Like if death had come to you and your moaning and your sweating have increased, and your lips shrinked and your tongue became broken and your spittle became dry and whiteness became over your eyes blackness, and your mouth started to foam and your whole body started to shake, and you became to treat the death with its agony, its bitterness, and its shrieking, and you've been called and you can't hear anything, then your soul came out and you've became a dead body among your relatives. There is a lesson in you for others, so think in the meanings of death, whatever became upon others will become upon you no way out, and every life however it is long is short because whatever will come is close by at a certain time. So, meditate in the meanings of death you who die, and know you human being that death is harder than what becomes before it and easier than what becomes after it from troubles and disasters of the doomsday,..etc. And it was engraved on his ring: Patience is of faith, by God the victory will come. And it was engraved on the area that he wore: The festivals are in keeping the duties, and the laws are of the completeness of religion, and the completeness of religion is the completeness of manhood. And over the area that he wore at the time of praying over the dead: The happy one who looks at himself, intercession to his God, his good deeds. <br>
 They mentioned that he had sermons and morals, and every band took it out with its own tongue, and ran as useful proverbs and symbols, and from that was his saying that was traced back to him (PUH): No one will be able to thank God for His gifts as giving His creatures. And also: Whoever wanted to reach the wisdom and the good of deeds, so let him leave the tool of ignorance and the bad deeds. As you see the craftsman that knows all the crafts so when he wants to sew he took its own tool and leave the tool of carpentry, so the love of the life and the after-life do never come into one heart together. And also: The goodness of life is sorrow and its badness is a regret. Meaning that let go of good deeds in life is a sorrow and doing bad deeds is a regret. And also from him: If you called for God the Exalted make your determination clear and pure and also fasting and prayers, so do and never swear and you are liers and don't attack God with rights [meaning here swearing or promising with lies], and don't make liers swear for you and so you'll become partners for them in their sin, and avoid ill gains and follow your kings and your elders and make your mouths full of thanks to God, and the life of souls is wisdom and don't envy people for their luck for they will enjoy it for a little, and whoever exceeded satisfaction will never be satisfied, and so along of what was mentioned by Abdul-Wahâb Al-Najjâr in his stories. <br>
 It is mentioned from the book of "Tareekh Al-'Olamâ'" (History of wisemen) that a group of wisemen claimed that all the wisdoms that appeared before the Flood was traced back to Enoch that the hebrews call "Khanookh" the prophet the son of Jared ben Mahalaleel ben Cainan ben Enosh ben Seth ben Adam, and he is Edrees (Enoch) the prophet (PUH), and then they traced back to him matters and incidents and works that God did not suppose to him and most of them are like legends and what crazy people would do or silly ones that were slaves for life and ego took over them, and they never stop doing the bad deeds, and God forbid that His prophets commit such deeds, but they are assigned to the highest of matters and the best and wisest of conditions for mind and wisemen because they are the resources and they are the leaders of the creations and the guardians of the Creator over His religion and creed, the commanders of goodness and the prohibiters of badness, so they are the tongue and examples of truth and the looking eyes of reality and the hearing ear that express about God the Exalted and they don't speak out of their desires, but it is an inspiration that is inspired which One of mighty powers taught them. <br>
 It is mentioned from Enoch PUH the wise sayings and advices and calls and one of them his call that is read in the dawns of the month of fasting (Ramadhân) that contains forty names for God, as much as the days of Repentance (?), and it begins with: O praise be to You no God exists but You, O Lord of everything and its hire [seems a part of a famous praising]. And after mentioning the forty names comes the great call that has no other match, and it is imploring to God with His forty names, and asking for safety away from punishments of life and after-life, and it is without any doubt an infallible tongue and an inspired and closed one chosen by God for His commandments and for telling people about Him. [then comes a typical ending for the subject which I believe no need to mention here]. <br>
