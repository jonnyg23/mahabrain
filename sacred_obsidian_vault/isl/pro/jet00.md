 <br>Dear reader, notice that Jethro is an approximated name for this prophet.
 In the translation of the chapter of Moses you will find that the author
 of the book pointing out that Moses did not marry the daughter of Yiþrun
 or Yiþri, who was a faithful man or the chief of Midian, and apparently
 this name is just Jethro, the name that was mentioned in Torah. But since
 muslims believe that Moses married one of Shu`ayb's daughter, and since
 in Torah it is mentioned that Moses married the daughter of a man called
 Jethro, I decided to let Jethro as a representative name for Shu`ayb since
 it is more of Latin sense, but be careful not to mix things together, Jethro
 is still not meant to be the same person that Torah pointed out as for
 muslims do!

 <p><font size="+3">Shu`ayb (Jethro) The Prophet (PUH)</font></p></center>
 He is Shu`ayb (Jethro) ben Nowayt ben Ra`u'eel (Reuel) ben Murrah ben `Anqâ'
 ben Midian ben Abraham (PUH) [notice: unfortunately I couldn't find the
 ancestry of Jethro in Torah to check with the name listed above in Arabic,
 but for Nowayt it is close to the name Nahath mentioned in Torah as one
 of Reuel sons, but Reuel is a son for Esau and do not follow the chain
 mentioned here, but Nahath and Nowayt have some similarities as you can
 see], and his tongue was Arabic and was sent from the people of Midian
 as it is mentioned in Muruj Al-Ðahab, and `Atâ' [seems a person's
 name] said: He is Shu`ayb ben Nowayt ben Midian ben Abraham (PUH) and he
 was called the Speaker of Prophets for his billiant ways in debate with
 his people and his talent in proving his point against his people and disapprove
 their clues, and his people here is meant to be the people of Al-Aykah
 (the dwellers in the wood), and some say that he was sent twice, once to
 Midian and once to Al-Aykah (and it is a place near Midian with lot of
 waters and trees). It is mentioned that he was the first one to measure
 the balance with his hands so they were measruing with honesty but then
 they cheated in their measures so then they were taken by a great shake
 and left dead in their dwelling place, it is mentioned also that he sent
 some messangers from his side to the people, and one of his messangers
 was Shu'ayb ben Sâlih, he sent him to his (Shu`ayb ben Sâlih's)
 people but they killed him and threw him in a well, and it is possible
 that he was sent to the lands of Shem as it is shown by history and traces,
 and one of his messengers was Hassân ben Sinân Al-Awzaâ`ee,
 he was the messanger of Jethro to the lands of Africa so he went to them
 calling for faith in God and work to fullful His commandments, but they
 called him a liar and kept him a prisoner in a hole until he died, and
 another one was Al-Hâriþ ben Shu`yb Al-Ghassâni, and
 he was Jethro's messanger to Midian but they called him a liar and killed
 him as well. Jethro used to cry a lot, and as attributed to Anas ben Mâlik
 that he reported from the prophet (PUH) that he said: Jethro cried for
 God's love until he became blind, and then his sightness was brought back
 to him by God, then he cried again until he became blind and God brought
 his sightness again, and so on until the fourth time when God inspired
 to him: O Jethro, until what time you shall be crying? If it was for your
 fear of hell, then know that I protected you against it, and if it was
 for your love for paradise, then know that I made it for you, so then he
 said: O my Lord and Master, You know that I did not cry for the fear of
 Your hell nor for the love of Your paradise, but Your love is knotted in
 my heart and I can't keep patience to see You, then God inspired to him:
 if it was like that then I will send to you my speaker Moses ben Amram
 (PUH) to serve you, and this story could have many interpretations, maybe
 the most probable of all is that he meant "I will keep crying until I see
 you after my death."
 <br>What we understand from all of this is that Jethro was alone and had
 no one to believe in him and in his Lord and in the right path, except
 of hypocrites, so he was hated by everyone, and had no one to love except
 of God, like for someone that has only one child and loving him so much
 and afraid to lose him so he keeps on being sad. What is said by the prophet
 Jethro to God is exactly in the same meaning of what the prince of believers,
 `Ali ben Abi-Tâlib (PUH) said: I did not worship You for my fear
 of Your hell, nor for my love to Your paradise, but I found that You are
 the One that to be worshipped and so I did.
 <br>The chapters the mentioned the story of Jethro (Shu`ayb) are: Al-A`râf,
 Hud, Al-Shu`arâ', Al-`Ankabut, and others. God said: And unto Midian
 (We sent) their brother, Shu'eyb. He said: O my people! Serve Allah. Ye
 have no other Allah save Him. Lo! a clear proof hath come unto you from
 your Lord; so give full measure and full weight and wrong not mankind in
 their goods, and work not confusion in the earth after the fair ordering
 thereof. That will be better for you, if ye are believers.Lurk not on every
 road to threaten (wayfarers), and to turn away from Allah's path him who
 believeth in Him, and to seek to make it crooked. And remember, when ye
 were but few, how He did multiply you. And see the nature of the consequence
 for the corrupters!(Al-A`râf:85-86), and there are lot of others
 holy phrases and the contents are almost the same.
 <br>Midian was the name of his village and there lived his tribe and the
 father of the tribe was Midian the son of the Abraham (PUH) and so the
 village and the tribe were named after him, for this God did say "And unto
 Midian (We sent) their brother, Shu'eyb," meaning that We sent their brother
 Shu`ayb (Jethro) to Midian, and he was sent also to Al-Aykah (the wood
 dwellers) and they were also part of his people, and we've mentioned before
 that Al-Aykah is near by Midian and it is a place of lot of waters and
 trees, and so he came to them with what was revealed on his grandfather
 Abraham (PUH) from the Exalted One, he came to them with the fair laws
 of His religion with whatever it contains of regulations and worshipping
 and what is prohibited and what is allowed and what would bring them happiness
 in life and the after-life, so he ordered them to be fair in their measurements
 while weighing to give the right amount by themselves so they don't cheat
 in their dealings with others, and not to do mischiefs on earth after being
 fixed by others before them, by prophets and messangers and their viceroys
 with the faithful men, and not to follow the lusts and doing sins and not
 to allow what God forbade and forbid what God allowed just to follow the
 lusts. They used to sit on the roads and try to keep the people away from
 reaching him for they were afraid that they will leave the worshipping
 of the idols, and they used to mock at his way (of guiding) and warn and
 threaten everyone that believes in him and wanted to make the path of God
 to be crooked, and they did their best to ignore the calls of Jethro (PUH)
 and they used to say to him: O Shu'eyb! We understand not much of that
 thou tellest(Hud:91), and also they humbled him by saying: and lo! we do
 behold thee weak among us(Hud:91), and then they threatened him by saying:
 But for thy family, we should have stoned thee, for thou art not strong
 against us(Hud:91), but inspite of all of this he kept on calling for the
 faith of God until he embarrased his people by proving the falsehood of
 their beliefs and proved to them the righteousness of his path, for he
 was calling to what they hate of the faith and to be straight in their
 dealings and fair, so when they got annoyed by his clues against their
 religion, their tyrants gathered together and threatened him to banish
 him out of the village with his followers if they did not get back to their
 religion, but he answered them by saying: Even though we hate it? We should
 have invented a lie against Allah if we returned to your religion after
 Allah hath rescued us from it(Al-A`râf:88-89), but that would be
 if God wanted to keep us away from His closeness. God forbids to make the
 one who called for Him and who called to His path astray. So, their only
 way was to warn their people not to be tricked and join his religion telling
 them that they will be losers if they did so. The most important thing
 that they were denying about his religion is that he ordered not to worship
 what their fathers used to worship and not to do whatever they like in
 their money and in their measurements and dealings with others.
 <br>They mocked at his prayer that orders him with these commands as they
 claim and they said to him as to mock at him "thou art the mild, the guide
 to right behaviour." After all he kept on being patience and come to them
 from time to time and proving their falsehood until God ordered for them
 to be destroyed, and the earthquake seized them, and they were all destroyed
 as if they did not live there and Jethro with his followers were saved.
 Then God sent him to the people of Al-Aykah and it was close to Midian
 and there lived some God worshippers, and some said that it was in the
 deserts of Midian and Jethro was a foreigner for them and they used to
 do as the people of Midian used to do, so when he commanded them not to
 do so they said to him: Thou art but one of the bewitched; Thou art but
 a mortal like us, and lo! we deem thee of the liars(Al-Shu`arâ':185-186),
 for they thought that God do not send a human to human beings to guide
 them and they did not know that God makes His message where He desires.
 <br>They asked him for miracles and asked him to make pieces of the sky
 fall upon them to prove that he's truthful, and they did not ask him for
 guidance to the true path, and so they were taken by the punishment of
 the day of gloom, when God revealed upon them an extreme heat for seven
 days until their waters were boiled. Then God drove a cloud to them and
 they gathered under the shadow of that cloud to avoid the heat and then
 the cloud rained them with fire so all were burnt and died and God said
 about that day: Lo! it was the retribution of an awful day(Al-Shu`arâ':189).
 Some said that they were destroyed by an earthquake and some said that
 God revealed an extreme heat on them that took their breathes away, so
 then they went inside their homes but it got into their homes as well and
 no shadow nor water could avoid them that. Then God sent to them a nice
 breeze and they called each other to follow that breeze and when they were
 all out and gathered under the cloud, God made it rain fire on them and
 the earth shaked under their feet and they were burnt like locusts and
 turned to ashes, and this is the day of gloom. Some said that God sent
 to them one shout and they all turned to be dead.
 <br>It is mentioned that Jethro was sent to two tribes, one of them was
 destroyed by the earthquake and the other by the day of gloom, and there
 should be no contradictions between the tales since all tales point out
 to one thing in general which is their destruction by God for their rebellious
 nature against God and His prophet [2 lines come then but I did not get
 what the author meant!].
 <br>It is mentioned that after the destruction of his people, Jethro went
 back to his original place and the dwelling place of his tribe and that
 is Midian with his faithful followers and he lived there, and there he
 met Moses ben Amram (PUT), and it seems that it was a fertile land and
 their people used to live in luxury and they were traders and their land
 was a destination for many others, and its location might be in Palestine
 and whatever is mentioned about its location saying that it is between
 Hijâz and the lands of Shem does not oppose that idea (of being in
 Palestine), and we've mentioned before the speech of Al-Sâdiq (PUH)
 when he said that God sent only five prophets from Arabs and they were:
 Hud, Sâlih, Ishmael, Jethro and Muhammad (PUT), and in a speech for
 Al-Bâqir (PUH) he said: God inspired unto Jethro that He will punish
 one hundred thousand of his people, forty thousand of their tyrants and
 sixty thousand of their good ones, so he (Jethro) asked: and why the good
 people O Lord? Then God inspired unto him: for their easiness with the
 tyrants and they did not be angry along with My wrath, and as attributed
 to Ibn `Abbas he said that Jethro lived for two hundred and forty and two
 years, and some of its relative stories would come in advance in the chapter
 that discusses the conditions of Moses ben Amram, may peace be upon him
 and upon our prophet (PUT).
