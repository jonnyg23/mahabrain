 Some people may don't like what we are mentioning here even though with
 such clues, because in his point of view they were not important matters
 in a time like ours with lot of corruption in it for the abundance of parties
 and bad people and the ignorance of religion, or even for the disbelieving
 in it and mocking at the people of faith and the total dedication of souls
 to this life and its beauty and building up even though by the name of
 religion. For all of that it is hard for them to bear hearing such matters
 and writing it down or even to look at it. Notice. But we say to him that
 the speech that is with people of faith is right even though their greed
 to increase their faith had become lesser for they knew what did the callers
 for God bear of troubles, and what the prophets of God and His viceroys
 did and what hurtings did they face along with troubles for calling back
 to God and for the saving of humanity and for the happiness of the creation,
 and awakening the ignorants and stopping the tyrants.
 <br>Then the believer's faith is never complete without admitting the prophecy
 of every prophet and messenger sent from God to His creation even though
 he knows a little about them, and the best thing to be said in this location
 that they are  mentioned (PUT) in dear Quran, and emphasized on mentioning
 them many times and explained their stories and their conditions and all
 of that was just to think about it as it is mentioned in these holy phrases,
 so the believer think about its sermons and warns by its warnings and avoid
 the things that bring the torments and revenge and go along to the things
 that bring dignity to the believers in this life and the after-life, so
 explaining such matters going deep inside them is only for this purpose,
 and in fact it is just an explanation for the holy phrases of God and to
 interpret what the Holy Book symbolized.
 <br>With this wind we've become to mention before God bombards mountains
 and make it as a plain land without any curves in it or high places. It
 is said that it is called Al-`Aqeem (the wind) [Arabic: `Aqeem = barren]
 because it was barren with torment and without any mercy, like when men
 and women when they become barren with no children, so it is said: "Rajol
 `Aqeem" (Barren man) and Imra'ah `Aqeem (Barren woman), so barrenness is
 and adjective that describes males and females. And it is said: when the
 people of Hud (PUH) became tyrants and they are A'ad and his people and
 disbelieved and nothing works with them of sermons or the warnings of the
 prophet of God, Hud, God sent to them Al-`Aqeem wind (barren wind) so it
 grinded their castles and forts and cities until all became like sands,
 and it came over them for continuous seven nights and eight days, and you
 would see the people in them (the cities) as if they were trunks of palm
 trees, and it used to lift men and women up high and throw them back to
 fall on their heads, so the wind used to pick up men and women from down
 their feet and lift them up to the sky and destroy them, and it worked
 on mountains as well as it grinded their homes until they became like soft
 sand, and it is the one called Al-Ahqâf (and there is a chapter called
 for its name and it is the chapter of Al-Ahqâf), and we've came to
 mention that they used to cut of pillars from the mountains as tall as
 the mountain itself then they move it and make a stand of it and build
 castles upon it, and maybe for this reason it was called "Ðât
 Al-`Imâd" [Arabic: `Imâd = pillars] that nothing was created
 like it on the lands.
