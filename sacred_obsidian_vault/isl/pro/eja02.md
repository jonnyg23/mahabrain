 <center><font size="+3">Owners of The Ditch</font></center>
 God said: (Self-)destroyed were the owners of the ditch, Of the fuel-fed
 fire, When they sat by it, And were themselves the witnesses of what they
 did to the believers, They had naught against them save that they believed
 in Allah, the Mighty, the Owner of Praise..etc(Al-Buruj:4-8). In interpretations
 and narrations that are trusted, it is that God sent a prophet from Abyssinia 
 to call the people to the faith of God and to work with His laws and regulations
 according to the laws of the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary with what was
 there in the Gospel, and some of the people were pagans and some of them
 were jews, so this holy prophet started to call the people towards god,
 and he showed many miracles and so lot of people followed him and believed
 in him, and the king was a jew and most of the people were jews, so they
 met with him (the prophet) and fought against him (the prophet) and so
 many of his followers were killed and some others were captured, and then
 they made ditches for them into the ground and filled them with woods and
 sat the fire in them, and on the edges they put some witnesses to see how
 it's going to be and how the king's orders shall be done, and then they
 said to the people: whoever was along with the religion of the king and
 was a jew let him be away, and whoever followed this man let him drop himself
 into the fire and if anyone denied then push him by force, and so on until
 the number of those who were killed by the sword and fire reached twenty
 thousand. They say that then came a woman carrying a baby that was two
 months old only and she got scared of the fire and then the baby said to
 her: go ahead and don't be afraid and so she went into the fire with the
 baby. In another narration it is said that the baby was two months old
 and the woman wanted to throw herself into the fire but she had mercy upon
 her child and then God made him speak and he said to her: O mother, throw
 yourself and I into the fire for this is not so much for God.
 <br>They say about the interpretation of "(Self-)destroyed were the owners
 of the ditch", that it was because of the king of Abyssinia and it was
 Ða Nus, the last one to be a king from Himyar, and he turned to judaism
 and all of Himyar turned to judaism, and he was told that in Najrân
 in Yemen there were some people that still believe in christianity and
 their chief was `Abdullah ben Yâss, and they insisted that the king
 should march to them with his armies and make them get into judaism, and
 so he did and when he reached Najrân he gathered all the christians
 and he threatened them and warned them to leave christianity but they denied
 to do so and they chose to be killed instead of changing their religion
 and so he made ditches for them and sat the fire in them, and so some of
 them were thrown to the fire and some were killed by sword, and the numbers
 of the dead reached something around twenty one thousand men.
 <br>In a narration, the prince of belivers (PUH) was asked about the magii
 [fire worshippers] and their rules, and he answered: they were people that
 had a book, and once they had a king that got drunk one day and made an
 affair with his sister and his mother and when he got sober he regretted
 that, and he said to the people: this is allowed (by religion), and they
 denied that, so he started to kill them and made the ditches and threw
 them into them..etc. We say: we don't mind that many stories about this
 matter are available and the narration is true, because it is like a rule
 that runs among the wrong kings and they take from each other (the deeds),
 and Quran points out to the all because the reason for all of them is one
 and God sees His servants and He is the Knower.
