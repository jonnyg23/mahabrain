 <center><font size="+3">Jesus is One of Those of Will</font></center>
 In lot of tidings and many of them that were brought by men of confidence,
 it is mentioned that Those of Will of the prophets are Noah, Abraham, Moses,
 Jesus, and the last of the prophets and their master Muhammad (PUT), so
 their message is general and not especially made for one nation and it
 is dedicated to everyone of thought of Djinn and people, and it is something
 that should be out of doubt, especially concerning the laws of Moses, Jesus
 and Muhammad (PUT), and the main job for the prophets with the viceroys
 and the scholars that were at the time of each one of them was that to
 tell the laws of them each one according to his time, and he (a prophet)
 might be inspired with other matters other than those revealed for Those
 of Will and their viceroys, and the guidance comes from God and He is the
 only Guider. The fact that Noah was sent to his own people and Abraham
 to Nimrod, and Moses to the pharaoh, and Jesus to the Israelites, and Muhammad
 to the Arabs, this fact does not oppose the idea that their message and
 laws and their books were dedicated to all and even though the prophet
 was not to be seen, but there should be a media to transfer all of the
 teachings even if it was by one thousand transferer, and every general
 laws take over the previous general laws, and so the laws of Islam cancelled
 out all of the previous laws and it must be worked with until the end of
 time, and this is the truth as judged by the mind and those of minds as
 agreed upon by all of those who believed in the laws of Islam, and some
 of such talk was present in the introduction of this book, notice.
 <br>The narrations that points out that a prophet was sent especially for
 a nation or a city, are interpreted that it was desired that he would be
 sent personally as it is said that Abraham was a messanger to Nimrod and
 Moses is for the pharaoh and Jesus to the Israelites or to Palestine and
 in our prophet to the Arabs, and anyhow that does not oppose the idea that
 their messages were general and dedicated to all the creatures, and it
 is said that the Damned, the Satan, asked the angels about the father of
 Jesus the son of Mary and said: who is his father? The angels said: he
 is like Adam, then the Satan said: then I shall make four fifths of the
 people go astray by him, and it is mentioned that a jew asked the prophet
 (PUH) and said to him: you were assigned a prophet before you were created?
 he (PUH) answered: yes, and he said: and those who believe in you are assigned
 as well before they were created? he (PUH) answered: yes they are, then
 the jew said: then why you didn't speak with wisdom when you went out from
 the womb of your mother like Jesus the son of Mary did and you claim that
 you are a prophet even before creation? Then said the prophet (PUH): my
 cause was not like the cause of Jesus the son of Mary, God created him
 from a mother without a father as He created Adam without a mother or a
 father, and if Jesus went out from her womb and didn't speak with wisdom
 then his mother wouldn't have any excuse in front of the people because
 she brought him without a father and they would have stoned her as they
 usually do while she did no sin.
