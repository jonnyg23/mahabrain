 Out From Iraq To The Land of Shem</a></big></big></big><br>

 In tidings, when Abraham broke the idols and after throwing him
 into the fire and getting out of it with no harm, he (Nimrod) ordered
 for Abraham to be exiled out of the lands, and avoid him from taking
 his money and cattle, so then Abraham asked for judgement to be made
 according to their own laws and regulations. In general he argued with
 them by saying: if you want to take my money, then you should give me
 an exchange for my life that I spent in your lands, so then they went
 to the judge of Nimrod to make a judgement about this matter, and the
 judge decided that Abraham was right, so they released him and released
 his cattles and all of his money, so then Abraham and Lot got out in
 the direction of the land of Shem (Syria and the surroundings)
 approaching the position of the holy shrine in Jerusalem before it had
 been built by many following centuries, and he made a bed for his wife
 Sarah and closed it roughly for he was so jealous, and she was the
 daughter of his uncle Pethuel the brother of Terah ben Nahor, and she
 was the first to believe in him, and other things rather than this had
 been said as in Muruj Al-Ðahab for Al-Mas`udi, but it also
 mentioned as we said before that she is Abraham's maternal cousin and
 she was the sister of Lot ben Haran.<br>
 So he went along far away from his home to some where else like a
 stranger, he did not know anyone and no one invited him to his land, so
 he travelled until he was out of Nimrod's kingdom until he got into the
 kingdom of a coptic man called `Urârah [maybe the author used
 "coptic" here as a general name for egyptians, the coming story is
 similar to the one mentioned in the chapter of Genesis in Torah, but
 the name of the Pharaoh is not mentioned in Torah], then he passed by a
 tithe-gatherer that takes tithes from people passing by his lands, so
 he blocked the way of Abraham to take the tithes of his money and
 cattles, so the officer that was appointed from `Urârah said:
 open the tomb (or the palaquin which had his wife Sarah in it) to take
 the tithes of it, so then Abraham said: say whatever you think it is
 there and ask for whatever you want of gold and silver to give you the
 tithes of it and don't open it. But the tithe-gatherer denied that and
 insisted on opening the palaquin and he did, and Abraham became so
 angry because he was so jealous and afraid for his wife Sarah, and when
 the tithe-gatherer looked at Sarah, and she was pretty, he said: who is
 she? and what is her relation to you? So then Abraham said: she is my
 wife and my cousin. Then the officer said: I won't let you go until I
 tell the king about you and her. Then he sent a messenger to the king
 and told him everything happened, and when the tidings reached the king
 he ordered the palaquin to be brought to him with what it had, and so
 they took the palaquin and Abraham went with them and never left the
 palaquin, and when they reached the king, the king said: open the
 palaquin, then Abraham answered: my wife and my cousin is inside and I
 am ready to give everything I have for not opening it, but the king was
 not satisfied until they opened it. When they opened it and he looked
 into Sarah he couldn't hold himself and extended his hand trying to
 touch her, and Abraham then turned his face away for his jealousy and
 said: O God keep his hand away from my wife and my cousin, and so his
 hand didn't reach her and didn't get back to him (it is understood from
 this line that his hand was paralysed) Then said the king: your God did
 that to me? So said Abraham: yes, then he said: pray to him to get it
 back to me, and if it was back to me I will leave you alone. So then
 Abraham prayed to God and so his hand got back to him, but the king
 looked at her again and extended his hand to reach her and Abraham
 turned his face away and said: O God keep his hand away, and so his
 hand was paralysed and couldn't reach her, so then the king said to
 Abraham: your God is jealous and you are jealous as well so call your
 God to let my hand back to me, and if it was so I will not do it again.
 Then said Abraham: O God if he wastruthful let it back to him, and so
 it was, and when the king saw that Abraham grew so great for him and
 made him his guest and then said to him: go to wherever you want but I
 have a request, and that is to allow me to give her (Sarah) a pretty
 coptic maid that I have and she is intelligent and I want her to be as
 a servant for your wife, and so Abraham allowed that, and so the king
 gave her to Sarah, and she was Hagar the mother of Ishmael (PUH).<br>
 Then Abraham got out with all what he had and the king went out with
 him and walked behind Abraham for his greatness but Abraham refused
 this and didn't accept that the king would walk behind him and so he
 made him in the front and Abraham walked behind him and he said: my God
 ordered me to walk behind you and respect you for your highness and so
 then the coptic king said: I swear that your God is Clement and
 Generous, and you make your religion beloved by me, and then the king
 said farewells to him, and then Abraham went along until he reached the
 upper parts of Shem's lands and left Lot in the lower parts of them,
 and God did say about this: <a name="021_071">And We rescued him
 and Lot (and brought them) to the land which We have blessed for (all)
 peoples(Al-Anbiyâ':71) and it is the lands of Shem and Palestine
 because God had destined them to be the homelands for prophets and the
 lands of their tombs after Abraham (PUH), and then when Abraham
 recognized that he did not have any children from Sarah, he said to
 her: if you like, you can let me have Hagar as a wife, maybe God will
 give me a son from her and he would be as a son for us as well, so he
 paid the dowry for Sarah and took Hagar as a wife and she gave birth to
 Ishmael (PUH), and more to come about that later on.<br>
