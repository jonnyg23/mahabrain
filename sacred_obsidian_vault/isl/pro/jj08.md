 <font face="Times New Roman,Times">As attributed to `Ali ben Ibrâhim
 that he said: the distance between Joseph and his father took eighteen
 days to travel, and he was in a desert and the people went to Egypt to
 get some food, and Jacob with his children were in a desert that had some
 moqal (it is a type of plants that was used for fire at that time as it
 is known in the langiuage) [I could not find an exact translation for this
 plant's name so I typed it as it is], so the brothers of Joseph took of
 that moqal and carried it to Egypt to buy with it some food, and some said
 that their trade were some shoes, and Joseph used to take care of the selling
 by himself, and when they went to him he knew them but they did not know
 him, and he prepared them well and then said to them: who are you? They
 said: we are the children of Jacob, so he said to them: what is your father's
 craft? They said: he is a weak old man, he said: you have another brother?
 They said: we have a brother from our father but not our mothers, then
 he said: when you get back to me get him with you, and if you did not then
 no food to sell to you and never get closer, they said then: we will trick
 our father to take him, so then Joseph ordered for their stuff to be with
 them so when they see it they come back to him, and when they got back
 to their father they said: O our father! What (more) can we ask? Here is
 our merchandise returned to us, The measure is denied us, so send with
 us our brother Benjamin that we may obtain the measure, surely we will
 guard him well, then said Jacob: Can I entrust him to you save as I entrusted
 his brother to you aforetime? I will not send him with you till ye give
 me an undertaking in the name of God that ye will bring him back to me,
 unless ye are surrounded and can not protect him anymore, so they took
 him and went out and Jacob told them: do not go there from one gate but
 go in from several gates, and I can not protect you against God's will
 for He has the judgement, and when they went as their father ordered them
 nothing saved them but God, and it was for a purpose that Jacob kept in
 his soul and he was a wise man.</font>
 <br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is mentioned that when Benjamin
 went with them he did not use to sit with them or talk to them or even
 eat with them, and when they went to Joseph, he (Joseph) knew him just
 by looking, and he sat away from the rest, so then said Joseph: are you
 their brother? He said: yes, he asked then: why don't you sit with them?
 He said: for they went out with my brother from my own mother and father
 and came back claiming that the wolf devoured him so I promised myself
 not to sit with them ever as long as I am alive.He asked him then: did
 you get married and got some children? He answered: yes, three children,
 I called one of them "the wolf" and the second I called "the shirt" and
 the third I called "the blood", so then Joseph said to him: how did you
 choose these names? He answered: so I will not forget my brother, and so
 whenever I call one of my children I remember my own brother, and when
 the children of Jacob wanted to go out, Joseph said to his brother: I,
 even I, am thy brother, therefore sorrow not for what they did, then he
 said to him: I would like to keep you with me, so he said: my brothers
 will not let me for they promised my father to bring me back to him, so
 then he said: I have a trick, and then when he prepared them and gave them
 what they need, he (Joseph) said to some of his assistors: put this cup
 in the saddlebags of Benjamin, and the cup was made of gold and they put
 it in his saddlebag and no one could notice, and when they got up to travel
 back, Joseph ordered for them to be imprisoned and then ordered someone
 to call O camel-riders! Lo! ye are surely thieves! Then Joseph brothers
 said: what are you missing? They answered: We have lost the king's cup,
 and he who bringeth it shall have a camel-load, and I (said Joseph) am
 answerable for it, they said: By God, well ye know we came not to do evil
 in the land, and are no thieves, then Joseph said: And what shall be the
 penalty for it, if ye prove liars? They said: then the penalty of the one
 who got the cup is to be imprisoned, and then he started searching in their
 bags before the bag of his brother, and then he got it out from the bag
 of his brother, God said: Thus did We contrive for Joseph. He could not
 have taken his brother according to the king's law unless Allah willed(Yousof76),
 and also He said: And when he provided them with their provision, he put
 the drinking-cup in his brother's saddlebag..etc(Yousof:70), and in a speech
 attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH): it was a cup of gold and it was for
 Joseph and when they measure, they measure with it.</font>
 <br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Also attributed to Al-Bâqir
 (PUH) that he said: it was a bowl that was used to drink and to measure,
 and both speeches have the same meaning anyway.</font>
 <br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is mentioned that after this
 even the brothers of Joseph came to their brother Benjamin and said to
 him: you defamed us, when did you take this cup? Then he said: this cup
 was put in my bag by the one who put your merchandise back in your bags
 in the first time. About calling them thieves it is said that it was meant
 to be that they stole Joseph and betrayed their father about him, and they
 did not steal the cup and Joseph did not lie as well. When the cup was
 found in the bag of Benjamin they said: If he stealeth, a brother of his
 stole before, and they meant by that Joseph, for he was before his troubles'
 beginning with his aunt and his father wanted to take him back from her,
 so she made him wear a girdle and he did not know, and in their laws at
 that time the thief was to be owned by the one that was stolen from, so
 then his aunt claimed that her built was stolen by him (Joseph) and then
 she kept him with her for a while until he got out then with his brothers
 and they did what they did with him, and his aunt all of that for she used
 to love him so much, and for this matter they said: f he stealeth, a brother
 of his stole before, and they meant Joseph by that, and when Joseph heard
 that he kept it as a secret and said to them: Ye are in worse case, and
 Allah knoweth best (the truth of) that which ye allege(Yousof:77), and
 the meaning is that God knows better about the case of stealing for him
 and for his brother Benjamin and He knows they are innocents, but the one
 who stole is you and not Joseph and not Benjamin.</font>
 <br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They say that they gathered around
 Joseph and their skins dropping a yellow blood and they debated with Joseph
 about Benjamin and about the heavy promises they made for their father
 about Benjamin, and when the children of Jacob get angry, the hair of their
 body gets out of their clothes with a yellow blood, and in that situation
 they said to Joseph: O king his father is an old man so take one of us
 for we see you a good man, then Joseph said: God forbid that we should
 seize save him with whom we found our property, and when they got despaired
 and wanted to go back to their father, Judah said: did not you know that
 you made heavy promises for your father? You get back to your father but
 I will stay here until my father allows me to do so or until God make his
 judgement for me.</font>
 <br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">God said: Return unto your father
 and say: O our father! Lo! thy son hath stolen. We testify only to that
 which we know; we are not guardians of the Unseen(Yousof:34), and when
 they got back to Jacob and told him about the story he said: Nay, but your
 minds have beguiled you into something. (My course is) comely patience!
 It may be that Allah will bring them all unto me(Yousof:83) and he meant
 by that Joseph, Benjamin and Judah that stayed in Egypt, and then he went
 away from them and said: Alas, my grief for Joseph! And his eyes were whitened
 with the sorrow that he was suppressing(Yousof:83), and when they wanted
 to go back to their father, the king (Joseph) sent a messanger to Jacob
 telling him: This is your son I bought him with a cheap price and he is
 Joseph and I made him a slave, and this is your son Benjamin I took him
 and I found my cup with him so I made him a slave. Nothing harder could
 pass over Jacob more than this message, so he ordered the messanger to
 write down: By the name of God, the most Merciful, from Jacob, Israel of
 God ben Isaac ben Abraham the friend of God, I understood your message
 that says that you've bought my son and made him a slave, and the troubles
 are always waiting for the children of Adam, and my grandfather Abraham
 was thrown into the fire by Nimrod but he did not burn by anyhow, and for
 my father, God ordered my grandfather to slain him by his own hands and
 when he wanted to do so God gave a ransom for him, and I had a child that
 no one was beloved to me more than him and he went out with his brothers
 and they got back to me claiming that the wolf devoured him, and for this
 my back was bent and my eyes went white and blind because of crying, and
 he had a brother from his own mother that was my joy and he went out with
 his brothers to you to buy some food and they got back telling me that
 he stole the cup of the king and you've put him in prison and we are a
 family that known for honour and not a suitable thing to be called for
 stealing or doing evil-acts, and I ask you by the God of Abraham and Isaac
 and Jacob to release him back to me may you be closer to God by doing so.
 So, when the message reached Joseph, he put it over his face and cried
 loudly, then he looked at his brothers arriving with the message and he
 said to them:Know ye what ye did unto Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?
 They said: you are Joseph! Then he said: I am Joseph and this is my brother
 and God gifted us, then they said: God preferred you to us and we were
 wrong, then he said: Have no fear this day! May Allah forgive you..etc(`Yousof:92),
 the narrator said: they knew him by his smile for when they saw his teeth
 that were like pearls they remembered Joseph and some said that they knew
 him when he lifted the crown from his head.</font>
 <br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is mentioned that when the messanger
 went out from Jacob to the king (Joseph), Jacob raised his hands then to
 the sky and said: O best of Friends and Generous One, O God of Goodness,
 give me hope and end up my troubles, so then Gabriel (PUH) came down and
 said to him: O Jacob, Shall I teach you a pray that may God give you back
 your sight and your sons? He said: yes, he said then: then say: O One that
 no one knows how He is except of He, O One who blocked the air and pressed
 the earth over water and chose the best of names for Hisself, give me hope
 and end up my troubles, then the narrator said: and it was the next morning
 when the shirt came up and was thrown over his face and his became normal
 and his sons came back to him, and as attributed to Al-Mofadhal Al-Ja`fi
 he said: I said to Al-Sâdiq (PUH): tell me about the type of Joseph's
 shirt, he (PUH) answered: when Abraham (PUH) was to be thrown into the
 fire, Gabriel came down with a shirt from paradise and made him wear it,
 and so no fire or coldness affected him ever, so when Abraham then was
 about to die, he wrapped it in a piece of skin and hanged it on Isaac,
 and Isaac later on hanged it on Jacob, and when Jacob had Joseph as a child
 he hanged it on him, and when Joseph took it out of the skin, Jacob smelled
 the scent and said: Truly I am conscious of the breath of Joseph, though
 ye call me dotard(Yousof:94). Then the one asking and he is Al-Mofadhal
 Al-Ja`fi said to Al-Sâdiq (PUH): O may I be a ransom for you, who
 owned the shirt later on? He (PUH) answered: to his own people, and then
 he continued: every prophet that inherited a wisdom or anything else, are
 all at the end at the hand of Muhammad and his Household (PUT), and Jacob
 was at that time in Palestine, and when the caravan departed Egypt, Jacob
 smelled that scent of Joseph from the shirt that was brought from heavens.</font>
 <br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They say that Joseph said: the one
 who got my shirt with blood in the first time shall go now with my shirt,
 so then Judah said: I went with the blood-polluted shirt, so he said: then
 go with my shirt to my father and tell him I am alive and make him happy
 as you made him sad before, so he took the shirt and went out with bare-feet
 until he reached him (Jacob), and he had seven pieces of bread and the
 distance was eighty leagues and still he did not consume all his bread
 pieces, then Jacob travelled from the desert with his household after getting
 the shirt to him and being able to see, and they said to him: O our father!
 Ask forgiveness of our sins for us, and he said: I will. Some mentioned
 that he waited until the late night time to ask for forgiveness for their
 sins because it is a time when prays are answered, and when they reached
 Egypt, Joseph sat on the throne and put the crown over his head for he
 wanted his father to see him like that, and when his father went in, he
 did not stand up for him, and they fell prostrating so then Joseph said:
 O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream of old. My Lord hath
 made it true(Yousof:100). It is attributed to Al-Kâðim (PUH)
 that he said: the prostrating of Jacob and his sons was not for Joseph
 in his person, but was to obey God's commandment and as a greeting for
 Joseph as angels did prostrate for Adam before, for it was not for Adam
 but they obeyed God's commandment and as a greeting for Adam, so Jacob
 and his children prostrated to God as to thank God for gathering them together
 again, and Joseph said as it had been told by quran: O my Lord! Thou hast
 given me (something) of sovereignty and hast taught me (something) of the
 interpretation of events - Creator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art
 my Protecting Guardian in the world and the Hereafter. Make me to die muslim
 (unto Thee), and join me to the righteous(Yousof:101), and it is said that
 Joseph sent one hundred messangers (travellers) to bring his family, providing
 them with what they need for travelling, and when Jacob got closer to Joseph,
 Jacob started by greeting and said: O peace upon you grieves taker, and
 then they hugged and cried while Joseph kept on kissing the fingers of
 his father and can not stop crying because of his happiness and surprise,
 for the situation of Jacob when he met Joseph can not be described and
 nothing like it except going into paradise and hugging the nymphes of paradise
 by the viceroys of God and His beloved servants, may God make us one of
 them with the rest of the blievers by His prophet, the prophet of mercy
 and his Household (PUT).</font>
 <br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They say that they (Israelites)
 got into Egypt and they were seventy three, and then they went out at the
 time of Moses (PUH) and they were around six hundred thousand and five
 hundred and seventy men, and the time elapsed between Moses and Joseph
 was four hundred years, and after the arrival of Jacob to Egypt and after
 having some rest, he said to Joseph: tell me son, what did they do to you
 when they took you from me? He said: release me from doing so father, he
 then said: tell me some of it, then said Joseph: O father, when they put
 me in the well they said: take off your shirt, so I said to them: O brothers
 fear God and do not take off my things, then they showed a knife towards
 me and said: if you did not take off your shirt surely we will slay you,
 so I took off the shirt and they put me in the well naked, so then Jacob
 had a deep breath and fell down in a coma, and when he woke up again he
 said: O son, tell me, then Joseph said to him: O father I ask you by the
 God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob to release me from doing so, and so
 Jacob then released him from doing so. They say that Jacob lived for seventeen
 years after arriving to Egypt, and he was at that time one hundred and
 forty seven years old, and he asked to be buried beside his father and
 his grandfather after his death, so Joseph then ordered the physicians
 to mummify him and so they did and his body was carried to Palestine and
 was buried there as he asked, and Jacob was the leader and the kingdom
 was for Joseph, and when he died the leadership became for Joseph.</font>
 <br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then the brothers of Joseph, save
 but Benjamin, were honoured and respected for the presense of their father,
 and after the death of their father, they say that they fell at the feet
 of Joseph seeking repentance and forgiveness for they were afraid that
 he might be harsh on them after the death of their father, for they thought
 that he was nice to them only for their father presense, and they said
 to him: out father told us to ask you to forigve us for our sins toward
 you, and they presented themselves as slaves to him, so then Joseph cried,
 and when he calmed down he explained to them how their wrong-doing brought
 goodness to the people on earth and that God wanted all of that for a mercy
 towards His servants, and Joseph then lived for one hundred and ten years,
 and it is mentioned that when Joseph died in Egypt they buried him in the
 Nile in a box made of marble, and this is because that when he died people
 almost fought together to let his body buried in their places seeking his
 blesses, and so they buried him in the Nile to end up the fights and the
 Nile is common among all the people and everyone drinks from it and so
 the blesses would go to the all, and it stayed there until Moses carried
 it when he went out of Egypt and buried him with his fathers, Abraham and
 Isaac and Jacob in Palestine and their monuments are famous there.</font>
 <br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some archaeological historians said:
 I've visited Hebron and the monument of Abraham, and I saw there when I
 entered to the place of their graves and close to their graves, a monument
 called the monument of repentance, and some natives there say that this
 is the tomb of Joseph (PUH) and he is buried there in that cave, and some
 said that he is buried in Nabulus and he has a monument there and people
 visit it, and some said that they made sure as witnessed by some natives
 there that the grave of Joseph is there in Nabulus and not in Hebron, and
 this is what is mentioned in Torah as well, and only God knows.</font>
