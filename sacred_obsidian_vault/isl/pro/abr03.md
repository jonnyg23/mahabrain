 <div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><big><a name="006_080">Breaking
 The Idols and Throwing Abraham in The Fire<br>
 </a></big></big></big>
 <div style="text-align: left;">It is reported from the Household (PUT)
 that Nimrod and all the people of his kingdom went out in a festival
 and Abraham hated to go out with them, so Nimrod appointed him to guard
 the idols house. He offered the idols food and give it to one after
 another and say to him: eat and talk, and when he gets no answer, and
 he knows that he will not get an answer and how come a non-living thing
 would answer him, he breaks its arms and legs with an axe until all of
 them are broken, then he hanged the axe over the neck of the biggest
 idol and it was in the middle of the place, and then when the king got
 back with his people and saw what happened to their idols they said: <a name="021_059">Who hath done this to our gods ? Surely it must be some
 evil- doer(Al-Anbiyâ':59) Then they said: here is a boy that
 remembers them called Abraham and he is the son of Azar, so then they
 brought him with his father Azar, then Nimrod said to Azar: you
 betrayed me and kept this boy away, then Azar said: O my king, this is
 the deed of his mother and she said that she will defend for him, so
 then Nimrod called Abraham's mother and asked her: what made you hide
 this boy until he did what he did to our gods? So then she said: O
 king, this is because I care about your people, he said then: and how
 is that? She answered: because you used to kill the kids of your people
 and this deed will decrease the population so I thought for myself that
 if it was this boy he is seeking let him kill it and leave the people
 alone and if he is not the enemy of the king then he would stay for us
 so I see now I am right and you got him and he is yours so do whatever
 you want to do with him and stop killing other people's children. Then
 Nimrod looked at Abraham and asked: </a><a name="021_062">Is it thou
 who hast done this to our gods, O Abraham ?</a><a name="021_063">
 He said: But this, their chief hath done it. So question them, if they
 can speak(Al-Anbiyâ':62-63). It is reported from Al-Sâdiq
 (PUH): he (Abraham) said that their chief had done it and he did not
 lie because he said he had done it if only he can speak.<br>
 So then Nimrod asked his people what to do with him so they told him:
 burn him and make a victory for our gods if you want. Al-Sâdiq
 said: the king of Abraham and his folks were not wise for they said for
 Nimrod burn him, but the king of Moses and his folks were wise because
 when he (the king) asked his folks for what to do with Moses they told
 him to give him a chance with his brother and call every magician in
 the land, then Nimrod captivated Abraham and collected the woods and so
 when it was the day to throw him in the fire, Nimrod and his soldiers
 showed up and he built before that a building to see what will happen
 to Abraham when he is thrown in the fire and to see how the fire would
 burn him and the Satan came to them and showed them how to make the
 catapult because no one was able to approach the fire and they were
 buffled how to throw him into that great flame, and birds were burnt
 from a far because of it, so then they put Abraham onto the catapult
 and it is said that Azar came and slapped him and told him to get back
 to the religion but he did not care about it.<br>
 They mentioned that none of God's creation, except for the human
 beings, wouldn't ask God to save Abraham, so the earth said: O Lord,
 none on my back worships You except of him, would he be burnt! And
 angels said: O Lord, Your friend Abraham is getting burnt. So then, God
 did say: if he called for me, I will save him. And Gabriel said: O
 Lord, Your friend Abraham is getting burnt and You sent Your enemy to
 burn him. So then said God: Be silent, only a slave like you would say
 this because he is afraid of being late. and he is My slave, I can take
 him back whenever I want to, and if he called Me I would answer him. So
 then Abraham (PUH) called his Lord by the words that are in the chapter
 of Al-Ikhlâs: O Allah (God), O The One,  O The eternally
 besought of all, O One that </a><a name="112_003">begetteth not nor
 was begotten, O One that </a><a name="112_004">there is none
 comparable unto Him, save me from the fire by Your mercy. The narrator
 said: then Gabiel met with Abraham in the air and he was put in the
 catapult, and said to him: do you need me O Abraham? So then Abraham
 answered: for you no, but for the Lord of universe yes, so he (Gabriel)
 gave him a ring that has an engraving saying: No other god except for
 Allah, Muhammad is the prophet of Allah, Allah is before my back, Allah
 supports me, Allah got my life. Then when Abraham wore the ring, God
 commanded the fire "be coolness", so then Abraham's teeth started to
 shake and chatter because of the coolness, until He said unto it "and
 peace for Abraham"  and then Gabriel got down and sat beside him
 and talking to him as if they were in a green garden. It is mentioned
 also that Gabriel (PUH) brought a garment from paradise and he
 (Abraham) wore it and then they sat together talking. This garment is
 given by Abraham to Isaac, and Isaac gave it to Jacob, and Jacob gave
 it to Joseph and he made it in his neck and so it was with him (with
 Joseph) when he was thrown into the well and when he got into jail ,
 and it is the garment that Joseph sent to his father from Egypt and
 made him blind no more, and this is what has been told in the public
 and it is transformed and narrated in different ways. Then Nimrod
 looked at Abraham (PUH) and said: whoever had a god let him take a god
 as the one of Abraham, so then a great man that Nimrod had said: I made
 magic over the fire so it won't burn him, then immediately a column of
 fire grew and burnt him. Then Nimrod looked at Abraham while he was
 sitting in a green garden in the fire with an old man talking to him,
 so then he said to Azar: the God of your son loves your son so much.<br>
 They mentioned also that after God's commandment to the fire to be
 coolness and peace for Abraham, no fire worked on earth for three days,
 and it is reported from Al-Râzi that he said: scholars had
 different interpretations for the coolness of fire at that day in three
 ways, one of them is that God removed the heat that was in the fire and
 only the light in it remained, and the second way says that God created
 in the body of Abraham (PUH) a protection against fire, as God do to
 the keepers of hell, and the third way says that God created a veil
 between Abraham and the fire and so the fire was kept away.
 Investigators said that the first way is the most truthful since it is
 apparent from God's saying: </a><a name="021_069">O fire, be coolness
 and peace for Abraham(Al-Anbiyâ':69), it is apparent that fire
 itself had been cool and so there are no protection or a veil and this
 is the correct opinion, and as reported from the prophet (PUH) that
 when Abraham (PUH) was thrown into fire, Gabriel (PUH) came down with a
 garment from paradise and with a carpet, so he made him (Abraham) wear
 the garment and lat him sit on the carpet and sat together talking.<br>
 In interpretations they say that after throwing Abraham into the fire
 by Nimrod, and after he got out of it as if nothing happened to him,
 Nimrod said to him then: O Abraham, who is your god? He answered: my
 God is the One that gives life and take it. Then said Nimrod: I give
 life and take it, then Abraham said to him: how come you give life adn
 take it? Then Nimrod said: I bring two men that are to be executed, so
 I give mercy for one of them and release him and keep the other and
 kill him and so I gave life and took it. Then said Abraham to him: if
 you were truthful then give life again to the one you killed, then he
 said: leave this now, my God brings the sun from east, so bring it from
 west, and so Nimrod was amazed. God said: </a><a name="002_258">Bethink
 thee of him who had an argument with Abraham
 about his Lord, because Allah had given him the kingdom; how, when
 Abraham said: My Lord is He Who giveth life and causeth death, he
 answered: I give life and cause death. Abraham said: Lo! Allah causeth
 the sun to rise in the East, so do thou cause it to come up from the
 West. Thus was the disbeliever abashed. And Allah guideth not
 wrongdoing folk(Al-Baqarah:258). The speech in this holy phrase was
 directed to our prophet (PUH) for God's saying "Bethink thee of him who
 had an argument with Abraham..etc" And the prophet himself doesn't know
 what is hidden in the future or destiny and only God knows, so He tells
 him what happened between Abraham and the damned Nimrod, and the one
 that had an argument with Abraham was Nimrod, and he was the first man
 to be a tyrant and called himself a god, and it has been told that this
 argument took place after throwing Abraham into the fire and being out
 of it with no harm and guided by God, and Nimrod had such an argument
 because of his high place and because people followed him and God gave
 him the time, but he rebelled and refused because of the kingdom he had
 and given by God, and the kingdom here is considered to be the
 ornaments of life and a human being would rebel when he becomes a rich,
 and such kingdom can be given to a faithful or a disbeliever, and
 Solomon ben David (PUT) was given a kingdom and power that was nothing
 like them, and God never gave something similar to anyone else and he
 said: </a><a name="038_035">He said: My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on
 me sovereignty such as shall not belong to any after me(Sad:35), and so
 God gave him what shall not pass in the mind of anyone else and he is a
 prophet and a son of a prophet, and also He had given Nebuchadnezzar
 and the Pharaoh of Moses a kingdom and others a lot that were believers
 or disbelievers.<br>
 For the kingdom by means of owing people's order and judgement and
 getting the loyalty of people that God guided, such things are not
 given by God except for one who God knows that they call for rightness
 and guidance and it is not to be except for a prophet or a viceroy or
 anyone faithful that God had chosen for His religion, and they know by
 the guidance of God what do people need in their life for religion,
 life matters and for the after-life. They say that when Abraham said to
 Nimrod that God brings the sun from the east so bring it from the west,
 Nimrod got surprised and couldn't answer because of his surprise and he
 knew that Abraham got the rightful clue. Nimrod could have said to
 Abraham let your God bring it from the west but he was afraid from
 God's reply to Abraham as He saved Abraham before from the fire. When
 Nimrod saw the miracles he knew that if he suggested that (bringing the
 sun from the west) Abraham would do it without a doubt and would make
 people believe him and in that way Nimrod would be ashamed, and God
 guideth not the wrongdoing folks. As reported from Ibn-`Abbâs he
 said that God sent a mosquito to Nimrod and stung his lip, and when he
 tried to catch it it flied to his nose, and tried to get it out but
 then she got into his brain, so then God tortured him for forty nights
 then destroyed him.<br>
