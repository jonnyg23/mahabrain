 <center><font size="+3">The Ash`abite Imaginations of The Pharaoh</font></center>
 Ash`ab, and he is the one that was famous for his silly imaginations and
 his bad opinions, and one of his stories as it was mentioned that once
 he kept some children away from him by lying at them, and he told them
 there is a wedding some where and they give some money in that wedding
 for the children, so the children went away from him trying to reach that
 wedding for the money, so when they went away he followed them hoping that
 what he did say is true and get something from that money that is distributed
 in that wedding! When the pharaoh asked Moses and Aaron about their Lord
 by saying: who is your Lord O Moses? He said: the Lord of the earth and
 heavens and what is between them, so he thought from Moses' speech that
 their Lord is found some where in heaven because the Almighty that can
 be up never comes down, and he made his people think that he is able to
 fight him and kill him as well and that climbing to the sky is something
 that he can do, so he issued a command to his minister, Haman, to build
 for him a tower reaching the sky to see the Lord of Moses, and then mentioned
 his thought about the lies of Moses. When Haman built the tower and made
 it so tall so that the pharaoh can reach the Lord of Moses, a wind came
 and knock it down from its base so it was ruined and the idea of the the
 pharaoh did fail and he was never guided, then he commanded to make an
 ark and on all of its corners some tightened pillars, then he (Haman) brought
 lot of hungry eagles and tightened them by the legs to the pillars and
 hanged on each pillar some meat, then both of them (the pharaoh and Haman)
 went into the ark and it went flying high because of the eagles and their
 hunger and the meat upon the pillars, so they flew with the ark all daytime
 and the pharaoh were asking Haman from time to time about what was upon
 them and what was beneath them, until they reached so high and he (the
 pharaoh) thought that he would be dead, he then commanded to be back to
 earth so he (Haman) got the meat down for the eagles and they all came
 down to earth in safe, for a wisdom only God knows.
 <br>In the chapter of Al-Qasas: And Pharaoh said: O chiefs! I know not
 that ye have a god other than me, so kindle for me (a fire), O Haman, to
 bake the mud; and set up for me a lofty tower in order that I may survey
 the god of Moses; and lo! I deem him of the liars(Al-Qasas:38). Kindling
 the fire is supposed to make the bricks from the mud to build the tower
 with after burning it with fire, so that he (the pharaoh) can reach the
 Lord of Moses and solve the problem with Him by an agreement or by killing
 each other, and this is only because of his Ash`abite imaginations. In
 the chapter of Ghâfir: And Pharaoh said: O Haman! Build for me a
 tower that haply I may reach the roads, The roads of the heavens, and may
 look upon the god of Moses, though verily I think him a liar. Thus was
 the evil that he did made fairseeming unto Pharaoh, and he was debarred
 from the (right) way. The plot of Pharaoh ended but in ruin(Ghâfir:36-37).
 <br>So Moses insisted on the pharaoh to believe in God while he was among
 his own people and this is something that breaks off his picture and get
 his place among his people down and it opposes the tyranny of the pharaoh,
 the one who owns the necks and the power over all the land and worshipped
 by the people, and who can compete with him and he is the one that said
 "I (Pharaoh) am your Lord the Highest" and "I know not that ye have a god
 other than me," and for this God did say to his messanger Moses (PUH):
 Go, both of you, unto Pharaoh. Lo! he hath transgressed (the bounds), And
 speak unto him a gentle word, that peradventure he may heed or fear(TaHa:43-44).
 Moses then did not leave any gentle way unless he had used and no door
 of guidance he did not enter for make the pharaoh happy with his people,
 but they do not like people that give advices. Some interpreters say that
 Haman did build the tower for the pharaoh until he reached an end that
 he could not continue building and then the pharaoh went upon it and directed
 an arrow to the sky and the arrow came back with some blood so then the
 pharaoh said: I killed the god of Moses, but this narration is full of
 doubt and it is but lies, for the pharaoh knows clearly that he is lying
 about what he claimed to himself and most of his followers did know that
 but because of his power they could not say it frankly, as it is for all
 the people in every time and every place, except those that God did make
 them succeed and happy.
