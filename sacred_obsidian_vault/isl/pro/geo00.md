 <center><font size="+3">The Prophet Jerjees (Georgeous) (PUH)</font></center>
 As attributed to Ibn `Abbâs he said that God sent Jerjees (PUH) to
 a king in the lands of Canaan that was called Ðu-Ðânah who
 used to worship an idol, and he advised him and guided him to worship God
 and forbid him to worship the idols and said to him: the creations should
 not worship except of God and don't pray except to Him, so then the king
 said: from where are you? and he answered: from the Romans and live in
 Palestine, and then he ordered to capture him and then he ordered to brush
 his body with iron brushes until the meat of his body fell down and then
 sprankled the vinegar over him and rubbed his body with harsh tools and
 then ironed his body just to let him die by torture, but since he didn't
 die he then put long wedges in his head and made his brain go out like
 a liquid but he didn't die and then he put a large rock over his abdomen.
 When night came over an angel came down to him and said: O Jerjees, God
 says to you be patient and be glad and don't be afraid or God is with you
 and He shall make a relief for you and they shall kill you for four times
 and during all of that God shall remove the sense of pain from you and
 this is destined for you and He knows the ends. Then the king wiped him
 over his back and his abdomen and then got him back to the jail, and then
 the king wrote (a letter) to the magicians to send him the best of them
 so they sent him a magician who used everything he can of magic over him
 (Jerjees) but nothing did happen to him and then he brought a poison and
 made him drink it and Jerjees said: by the name of God that lies of the
 wicked and the magic of the magicians shall be astrayed by His truth, and
 nothing happened to him, and then said the magician: if I made the people
 of the earth to drink this poison then their powers would be gone and their
 eyes would go blind, and then said the magician to Jerjees (PUH): then
 you are the bright light and the shining lamp and the obvious truth and
 I testify that your God is true and everything else is false and I believed
 in Him and believed in His prophets and to Him I shall repent, and then
 the king killed him. Then he got Jerjees back to the jail and tortured
 him severely and he didn't die and then he torn him apart and threw him
 into a well and he died there. Then the king gathered with his folks for
 some food and drinks, and then the universe changed and it went dark and
 a black cloud came with lightning and thunder and the earth started to
 shake and they thought that this is their end, and God then ordered Michael
 (PUH) and he went to the head of the well and said: stand up O Jerjees
 by the permission of God and by His Will the One who created you, and then
 Jerjees stood up alive again and Michael got him out of the well and he
 said to him: be patient and be glad and then Jerjees went to the king and
 he said to him: God resurrected me and sent me to you to be a clue for
 you, and then stood the head officer and said: I believed in your God,
 the One who resurrected you after your death and I testify that He is the
 truth and everything else is false, and four thousand people followed him
 and all believed and followed Jerjees, and the king killed them all by
 the sword and then he ordered to bring a board made of copper and he fired
 under it until it went red and he made Jerjees to lie on it and then he
 ordered to bring lead and it was melted down and poured into his mouth
 and then he struck his eyes and his head with wedges and when he saw that
 this didn't kill him, he sat the fire under him until he died and ordered
 to throw his ashes to the wind.
 <br>In brief about what remained of his conditions is that God resurrected
 him by His Will and then sent him to the king while he was sitting with
 lot of his folks. Then one of the king's folks said: we have fourteen pulpits
 and food between our hands that is made of many plants some of them give
 fruit and some others don't, so ask your God to give each tree a life and
 to plant in each of them its own leaves and fruit and if He did that I
 shall believe in you, and then Jerjees put his knees on the floor and prayed
 to God and yet before leaving his place, every branch bore its fruit and
 when they saw that they had no way but to believe in him. When the king
 saw that he ordered to put him between two wedges and then a saw was put
 over his head and he was sawn into two halves and then he put them in a
 great cauldron and cooked his meat, and the earth went dark and God sent
 Isrâfeel (Raphael ?) and he shouted and made the people fall down
 over their faces and God resurrected him again and sent him again to the
 damned king and when people saw him they got amazed, and the king said:
 if I left this magician my people shall be doomed, and all of them then
 gathered together and wanted to kill him by the sword and then said Jerjees:
 don't be in a hurry to kill me, and then said: O Lord, if I died then idols
 shall be worshipped and I ask You to make my name among the people as an
 example of patience for those who reach You for every adversity and trouble,
 and then they knocked down his neck with the sword and he died, and they
 were out of town that time so after that they went inside it in a hurry
 and all of them were doomed.
 <br>Al-Mas'udi said: of those who were in the period of time after the
 Messiah, there was Jerjees (PUH) and he met some apostles and God sent
 him to a king in Mosul [in Iraq] and he called him to worship God but he
 killed him and God resurrected him and sent him back to him again and he
 killed him, and God resurrected him and in the third time he ordered that
 he shall be sawn and then burned and spreaded his ashes in Tigris and then
 God destroyed the king and all of his kingdom of those who followed him.
 This is as it was narrated by the people of Scripture who believed in Islam,
 and the truth is that God knows the truth.
