 <center><font size="+3">Place of Revelation of Torah</font></center>
 It is mentioned that the place of revelation of the tablets and books of
 Torah that contained the knowledgement of the first and last nations and
 the regulations of the religion of Moses was the mountain of Sinai, so
 there speaking to God did exist and there the Torah was revealed, and to
 that blessed spot he (Moses) did stay away from his people while he made
 his brother Aaron to take the leadership over them, and there he fasted
 for forty years and there he lived while he was fasting as a humiliating
 himself towards God and asking for the satisfaction of God, and there he
 did ask to see God as an answer to his chosen chieftains among all of his
 people and the answer of God was a reason to make it knocked down, and
 Moses fell down in a coma as God did say: My Lord! Show me (Thy Self),
 that I may gaze upon Thee(Al-A`râf:143), and then God inspired to
 him: you cannot but look at the mountain if you saw it knocked down in
 its place then you will see me, so God then removed the veil and look at
 the mountain so it was knocked down from the base as if it was never there.
 <br>In a narration reported to the Household of the chosen prophet (PUT)
 they said that the angels came down and opened the gates of heavens so
 then God inspired to them to take care of Moses, and it is (the mountain)
 that God lift up upon the Israelites as a torment to let them accept the
 Torah and that is by God's saying: And when We shook the Mount above them
 as it were a covering, and they supposed that it was going to fall upon
 them(Al-A`râf:171).
 <br>There are some narrations that we understand from them that the mountains
 that were knocked down were seven and they were moved to Hijâz and
 Yemen and of them were the mountain of Ohod and Warqân nearby Medina
 and Þawr and Þubair in Mecca and Hawâ in Yemen..etc,
 and we do not see any important benefits of discussing this in a long speech
 and what Quran mentioned is enough, and there are in many occasions and
 in what was mentioned by the Household in their prays to God, it is understood
 from them that there are holy places that God did talk to his servant Moses
 from other than the mountain of Sinai, and other places also that He showed
 His signs to His servants like Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Moses and
 others before and after them, and it is obvious in the pray of Al-Samât
 [a famous pray or ritual for Shiites], and there are places that God showed
 His signs for His servants in them but are almost unknown by the scholars
 and the scientists in our recent days, and some of them are known like
 the mosque of Al-Khayf in Minâ [in KSA], so he (`Ali ben Abi Tâlib
 PUH) said: O Lord and I shall ask You by Your Glory that You spoke with
 with Moses ben Amram in the holy places, upon the sense of Al-Karrubiyeen
 [Al-Karrubiyeen: people differ in the meaning of this word, but most of
 them said it is the name (plural) for the angels that carry up the Throne],
 upon the clouds of light, upon the ark, in the column of fire and in the
 mountain of Sinai and in the mountain of Hureeþ [Hureeþ is
 close to Horeb the one mentioned in Torah, but as it is interpreted by
 Torah it is just another name for the mountain of Sinai, but here the prince
 of believers (PUH) makes a difference between the two], in the holy valley,
 in the holy spot of the right side of the tree...and in the gushing out
 that You made wonders with in the sea of Suf [this name I could not translate
 to any other versions by means of Torah]...etc, until he (PUH) says: the
 one that You showed Yourself by for Moses in the mountain of Sinai...and
 for Abraham in the mosque of Al-Khayf...and for Isaac in the well of Shee`
 (Shebah) and for Jacob in the house of Eel (?)..etc, and by Your Glory
 that appeared for Moses on the Qubbat Al-Rummân (dome of pomegranates)
 [I belive the full story is mentioned in the Exodus], until he (PUH) says:
 and by Your light that made the mountain of Sinai knocked down...and by
 Your face's light that You showed to mountain and made it down and Moses
 fell senseless...and by Your signs in Sâ`eer (Seir), and Your presence
 in the mount of Fârân (Paran) in the holy hills...and at the
 end the Imam (PUH) says: my Lord by this pray, and by the rights of these
 names that no one knows their interpretations save but You...etc. Actually,
 God showed His prophet (PUH) about these names in general to let him know
 that they do exist and to ask by them for their holiness, and the prophet
 showed that to his viceroy and the other viceroys of Imams after him to
 ask the Lord by these names for their holiness and they (the viceroys)
 showed these names for the public of muslims to let them get the benefit
 as well and only God knows.
 <br>In some narrations it is told that Al-Ma'mun, the abbaside caliphate,
 asked Al-Ridhâ (PUH) about the meaning of God's saying: And when
 Moses came to Our appointed tryst and his Lord had spoken unto him, he
 said: My Lord! Show me (Thy Self), that I may gaze upon Thee(Al-A`râf:143),
 and the question was: how come that Moses the prophet of God and he did
 not know that God is not to be seen to ask for such question? Then Al-Ridhâ
 (PUH) said in his answer: Moses ben Amram (PUH) knew that God was not to
 be seen, but when He talked to him and made him closer to Him and he went
 back to his people telling them that God talked to him they did not believe
 in him and said: we will not believe in you unless we hear Him as well
 as you, and they were at that time seven hundred thousand, so he chose
 seventy thousand, and then chose from them seven thousand, and then he
 chose out of them seventy men to be with him when facing God, so he went
 out with them to the mountain of Sinai and stayed there with them, and
 then Moses went up to the mountain and asked God to talk to him and let
 them hear Him as well, so God talked to him and they heard His voice from
 everywhere around them for God did make it in the tree and made it spread
 all around them, so then they said to him (Moses): we will not believe
 that what we heard was God's voice unless we see God, so when they said
 this great saying God did send a thunder upon them and took them away for
 their wrong-doing and they were destroyed. Then Moses said: O Lord what
 shall I say for the Israelites when I get back to them and when they would
 say that I got them out and killed them for I was not truthful in what
 I claimed? Then God made them alive again and sent them with him, so they
 said to him: if you asked God to allow you to see Him He would surely accept
 and then you would tell us how He is so we shall know Him better, so then
 Moses said to them: O folks, God is not to be seen with the eyes but He
 is known for His miracles and signs, then they said to him: we shall not
 believe in you until you ask Him, so then Moses said: O Lord, You heard
 them and You know better how faithful they are, so then God inspired to
 him: O Moses ask Me what they did ask you for I shall not charge you for
 their ignorance, so then Moses said: O Lord, allow me to see You, so then
 He said: you will not be able to see Me but see the mountain if it was
 knocked down in its place you will see Me, so when God looked at the mountain
 it was knocked down and Moses fell down senseless in a coma, and when he
 woke up he said: Sanctification be to You, to You I made my repentance
 and I am the first of believers..etc, and in the book of Ihtijâj
 that of Al-Tabarsi it is mentioned that a man came to the prince of believers
 (PUH) and said to him: O prince of believers, tell me about God, did you
 see Him when you worshipped Him? He (PUH) answered: I am not someone that
 worships
 something that he did not see, so the man said: how did you see him O prince
 of believers? He (PUH) answsered: woe to you! The eyes did not see Him
 by means of sightness, but hearts see Him by means of the facts of the
 faith, known by clues and called by the signs, not to be measured by people
 and not to be felt with the usual senses, so the man left the place saying:
 God knows better where to put His message.
 <br>In Muruj Al-Ðahab for Al-Mas`udi in the part concerning the stories
 of Moses, after God had destroyed the pharaoh, He commanded Moses to get
 the Israelites out into the deserts (the Wandering) and they were six hundred
 thousand adults added to them non-adults, and the tablets that were revealed
 upon Moses at the mountain of Sinai were made of green emerald and the
 writings were made of gold, so then when he got down from the mountain
 he saw some people from the Israelites that were worshipping a calf that
 they made so he got shocked and the tablets fell down from his hand and
 got broken and then he gathered it all and put them into the ark and made
 it into the temple, and Aaron was a priest and the head of the temple,
 and God revealed all the Torah on Moses while he was in the Wandering (or
 Exodus), and God took back the soul of Aaron during the Wandering 
 and he was buried in the mountain of Marân in the direction of the
 mountain of Al-Shirâ' that lies after the mountain of Sinai, and
 his grave is famous there in a normal cave that produces horrible sounds
 at nights that make everyone scared...until he (the narrator) said: and
 God had revealed on Moses ten books so it was completed to one hundred
 books [maybe the narrator means the total books revealed since the days
 of Adam added to the books of Moses would complete one hundred books],
 then God revealed on him the Torah that contained the commands and what
 is allowed and what is not and regulations and that was in five books (the
 pentateuch) [then the author explains the meaning of a word in Arabic which
 is used for books of Torah in special, but for translation purposes it
 can not be put here. Book of Torah is called Sifr pl. Asfâr].
 <br>What is understood from Al-Mas`udi is that the tablets is something
 different from the books and they are different from Torah, and the tablets
 are what reached the prophet (PUH) and he commanded his viceroy the prince
 of believers to copy them and keep them and they are the Cipher that has
 the knowledgement of the first and last nations and we mentioned that a
 while ago, and the one hundred books are what God said about in His holy
 book: Lo! This is in the former scrolls. The Books of Abraham and Moses(Al-A`lâ:18-19),
 and the Torah is something else other than these and we had explained what
 was the Torah for, and everything including the prophecial heritages with
 it (the Torah) and other things are all kept in the hands of the last hidden
 viceroy the son of Al-`Askiri (PUH) may our souls be a ransom to him, so
 peace upon him and upon his infallible purified fathers, and mercy of God
 and His blessings.
