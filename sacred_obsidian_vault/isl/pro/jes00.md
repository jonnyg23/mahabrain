 <center><font size="+3">Jesus The Son of Mary (PUH)</font></center>
 Jesus is the one born with no father and he is an owner for one of the
 general laws and regulations and one of "Those of Will" [meaning his message
 was designed for all nations and not only one nation], and he is the owner
 of the sacred Gospel and his mother is virgin Mary, the purified and the
 daughter of Amram ben Mâþân, and he is a descendant of
 Solomon ben David (PUH). Amram, the father of Mary, was a great man and
 one of the nobels among the Israelites and one of the greatest scholars.
 His wife, Hannah the daughter of Qâfuðâ, got pregnant and
 God inspired to her husband Amram that He shall give him a child that cures
 the blind and the leper and resurrect the dead people by the permission
 of God, so Amram brought the good tidings for his wife, and so she vowed
 whatever in her womb for the House of God, and at that time whenever they
 vowed something they would make it for the Temple and a servant for the
 Temple, and then she said what the Quran said: My Lord! I have vowed unto
 Thee that which is in my belly as a consecrated (offering). Accept it from
 me(Âl-`Imrân:35), and when she gave birth she said: My Lord!
 Lo! I am delivered of a female - Allah knew best of what she was delivered
 - the male is not as the female; and lo! I have named her Mary, and lo!
 I crave Thy protection for her and for her offspring from Satan the outcast(Âl-`Imrân:36).
 <br>As attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH) that he said: if we told you
 something about a man and it didn't happen but it happened to his descendants
 then don't deny such thing, because God inspired to Amram that He shall
 give him a male that is blessed and cures the blind and the leper and resurrect
 the dead by His permission and He shall make him a prophet to the Israelites,
 and he told his wife about that and she thought that she will give birth
 to a male, but when she delivered what was in her womb she found that it
 was a female and she said: My Lord I am delivered of a female, and when
 God gave Jesus to Mary it was him that God inspired Amram about, and when
 Mary was born, Zacharias guarded her and took care of her.
 <br>Al-Ridhâ (PUH) was asked once whether that a prophet would tell
 something about God and then comes the opposite and he answered: yes, and
 then he mentioned this holy phrase: Go into the holy land which Allah hath
 ordained for you..etc(Al-Mâ'idah), and they did not go into it but
 their descendants did, and Amram ben Mâþân said: God
 promised to give me a prophet son in this year and in this month, and then
 he went absent and his wife gave birth to Mary and Zacharias took care
 of her, and some people said: the prophet of God said the truth, and some
 others said: he lied, and when Mary gave birth to Jesus (PUH), the group
 that didn't believe him believed in him and all of them said: this is what
 God had promised us. "The opposite" as it is mentioned in the narration
 and the answer with "yes" by the Imam, it is understood from all of that
 that is it only an apparent opposition. It is mentioned among them [maybe
 the author here meant the Christians] that the one vowed with must be in
 the church (Temple) and never go out of it, and when she gave birth to
 a female, she said to God as if she was sorry: My Lord I delivered a female,
 and the female has a period and she must be out of the temple and the one
 vowed with must not go out of the temple, and also a female is not like
 a male in serving the worshippers.
 <br>It is mentioned that the purified virgin used to serve them until she
 became an adult and then Zacharias stopped her and made a veil for her
 against the others and she was named Mary meaning the Worshipper Woman
 [in fact in Hebrew Mariam means the Pure]. Her naming was meant to bring
 the good luck and to ask for closeness from God and to ask God to make
 her infallible and special with His gifts and make her as He likes so that
 her name coincide with her deeds. For that God accepted her with good and
 planted her with good roots and He made Zacharias as her guardian and some
 of that was mentioned in the chapter of Zacharias and maybe you have to
 check back. There are many narrations for us that mention how `Ali, the
 prince of believers (PUH) and Fâtimah the daughter of the prophet
 (PUH) resembled Zacharias and Mary the daughter of Amram. As Zacharias
 used to go to Mary and find some fortune with her and say to her: from
 where you got this? and so she answers: it is from God, He gives anyone
 without any account for it, so did `Ali and Fâtimah and many times
 he (PUH) went to her and found some fortune and so `Ali says: from where
 you got this? and she answers: it is from God, He gives anyone without
 any account for it, and there are amazing stories related to this matter
 but we left it out because this is not the place for them and might cause
 boredom, and it might be that Amram, the father of Mary, died and his daughter
 was so young that she needed someone to take care of her and for this Zacharias,
 the father of John (PUT), did take care of her and guarded her. During
 that whenever Zacharias the husband of her sister go to her, he used to
 find some fortune with her and asked her: O Mary, from where you got this?
 so she answered: this is from God, He gives anyone without any account
 for it. It is probable that the angels told her that God chose her and
 purified her and saved her from being poluted with impurities and the angels
 worked on inducing her to worship and work hard to obey God, because she
 had a special high place for God, and so God did say: And when the angels
 said: O Mary! Lo! Allah hath chosen thee and made thee pure, and hath preferred
 thee above (all) the women of creation, O Mary! Be obedient to thy Lord,
 prostrate thyself and bow with those who bow (in worship).(Âl-`Imrân:42-43).
 It is mentioned that the angels used to talk to her and she used to talk
 to them and so she is a Speaker [meaning someone who did speak with angels].
 The angels used to talk to her directly and God accepted her from her mother
 and no female was accepted before her as far as we know. She worked on
 obeying her God and He fulfilled her with fortunes from paradise and He
 chose her and purified her against every dirt that comes to women and saved
 her against every bad language that could be in the tongue and saved her
 against every loss or disadvantage from her hands or her feet and whatever
 she eats or drinks and in her dwelling place and her clothing and whatever
 she hears or sees and everything related to her feelings. So she was guided
 by her God and He sent the angels to her to tell her what He wants from
 her and what He wants not, and He made her special with virtues. Then,
 she gave birth to Jesus without a father and God made him speak while he
 was only a child to clean her against whatever the jews did charge her
 with and God made her with her son a miracle for the people.
 <br>As attributed to Al-Bâqir (PUH) about the meaning of the holy
 phrase: O Mary! Lo! Allah hath chosen thee..etc, it means: He chose you
 from the descendants of the prophets and purified you against adultery
 and chose you to give birth to Jesus (PUH) without a man, so God chose
 her as a faithful servant and sincere to God and He wanted her to be so,
 and so she was one of the most faithful among them and was preferred above
 all the women, and like her was the gift of the prophet (PUH), Al-Zahrâ'
 (Fâtimah) (PUH) but she was not born without a father but her father
 was the prophet (PUH) and she was preferred above all the women of the
 creation, and about God's saying: Lo! Allah preferred Adam and Noah and
 the Family of Abraham and the Family of 'Imran above (all His) creatures,
 They were descendants one of another. Allah is Hearer, Knower(Âl-`Imrân:33-34),
 He chose them among all the creatures and chose them for His message and
 for the spiritual characteristics and for the knowledgement of what the
 people would need and what solves their problems, and God made them special
 with virtues and lifted their levels and made them tough against everyone
 with clues and miracles and their virtues showed up as a sign of their
 truthfulness and to show they're preferred upon everyone even the closest
 angels, and that doesn't oppose the idea that they were tested by pagans
 and hypocrites, and He might cause them troubles so that people won't make
 them as deities and gods instead of God, and there is a wisdom for God
 with what He is doing: He is not to be asked and they are to be asked.
 The family of Abraham: Ishmael and Isaac and their children, and from the
 descendants of Ishmael comes our prophet and his Household (PUT), so the
 family of Muhammad (PUH) was added to the family of Abraham, adding to
 them what God made them special with of miracles and virtues that no other
 prophet or angel is near them but everyone in this universe seems like
 a servant for them, and this is not a strange thing because they are the
 leaders of the universe without a doubt, [many phrases come then with the
 same meaning], and the family of `Imrân (Amram) are Moses and Aaron
 the children of Amram ben Yas'hur ben Fâhiþ (Kohath) ben Lâwi
 (Levi) ben Jacob ben Isaac ben Abraham (PUT), and Jesus with his mother
 Mary the daughter of Amram ben Mâþân that is connected
 to Solomon ben David (PUH) that is in return connected to Judah ben Jacob
 ben Isaac ben Abraham (PUT). They say that the time between Amram the father
 of Moses and Aaron and Amram the father of Mary the mother of Jesus was
 one thousand and eight hundred years, and between the birth of Jesus and
 the birth of Muhammad (PUT) there were six hundred years, and it is narrated
 by the way of the Household that they were five hundred years, and between
 Abraham and Moses ben Amram there were five hundred years, and Abdul-Wâhâb
 Al-Najjâr mentioned in his tales that Shem ben Noah was born and
 his father was five hundred years old, and from that time to the time of
 Abraham's birth it was eight hundred and ninety years and Abraham was (when
 died) one hundred and seventy five years old, and after the death of Abraham
 up to the time of Joseph it was one hundred years, and after his death
 up to the time of Moses ben Amram it was four hundred years, and after
 his death up to the time of Jesus's birth it was one thousand and eight
 hundred years, and after his absence up to the prophet Muhammad (PUH) it
 was six hundred years, and from the time of the birth of Jesus up to our
 time nowadays it took about one hundred and seventy one years [1971, the
 year of publishing the book], and son the total since the time of Shem
 birth up to nowadays it is around five thousand three hundred and thirty
 six (5336) years, and the time since the birth of Jesus up to our time
 is checked, and whatever is before the birth of Jesus is mostly dependant
 upon what is mentioned in Torah, and God is the Knower of everything.
