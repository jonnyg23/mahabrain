 Birth of Abraham (PUH)</a></big></big></big><br>
 <div style="text-align: left;"><a name="009_028">It is mentioned that
 Nimrod had an astrologer, and once he said to him (to Nimrod): I see by
 calculating the positions of the stars that a man will be in your land
 and work on changing the religion to some other religion than yours, so
 then Nimrod said to him: in what land shall that be? So he answered: in
 this land, and he is not born yet, so then Nimrod said: we must
 separate men and women, and so he did and the mother of Abraham was
 pregnant but her pregnancy was not of clear appearance, and when the
 time had come for her to give birth she said to her husband Terah: I
 want to be alone and hide, and every woman at that time used to hide
 whenever she gets pregnant because of the cruel rule. Nimrod appointed
 a woman for every pregnant wife, so whenever she gives birth to a male
 he gets killed, and whenever she gives birth to a female then she is
 safe, so mother of Abraham escaped away when it was the time for her to
 give birth and entered a cave far away from people's sights and she
 gave birth, and she used to check him up whenever she gets the chance
 to, and she used to block the cave's enterance with rocks, and God took
 care of him and protected him against their evils. It was mentioned
 that he used to grow up in one day as would someone else grow up in a
 month, so he stayed there in the cave for thirteen years, so when he
 got old that much he got out of the cave and couldn't bear it anymore,
 and when his mother came he caught her clothes and said to her: I must
 go out and see people, and so on until he got out with her and she said
 to him: if the king knew about you and you are born at this time he is
 going to kill you, but he didn't care and got out and then she brought
 him to his uncle Azar. It might be that Terah after the birth of
 Abraham and while he was there in the cave, died and fate judged for
 his mother to be in the house of Azar and a wife for him and she gave
 birth to children for him and he got also children from others, and
 only God knows.<br>
 Abraham left the cave after the sunset and darkness was all over the
 place, and he knew that people are worshipping idols and Azar and all
 the people in his house except for his mother are idolators as well, so
 he hated that and refused it and denied worshipping the idols. Then he
 saw an apparent star in the sky and it was Venus, so he said: this is
 my God, but when it disappeared he said: if it was my God indeed it
 won't disappear, and then said: I don't love things that set. Then he
 looked to the east and saw the moon so he said: this is my God, this is
 bigger, but when it moved and disappeared he said: </a><a name="006_077">Unless my Lord guide me, I surely shall become one of
 the folk who are astray. Then when it was the morning time and the sun
 rose and he saw its glance and light all over earth, he then said: this
 is my God, it is bigger and greater, but when it moved and disappeared,
 God then made him to see the throne and the kingdoms of heavens and
 earth and inspired him and guided him and filled his hearth with galo
 and he knew that this universe has a Creator, so then he said: </a><a name="006_078">O my people! Lo! I am free from all that ye associate
 (with Him), </a><a name="006_079">Lo! I have turned my face toward Him
 Who created the
 heavens and the earth, as one by nature upright, and I am not of the
 idolaters(Al-An`âm:78-79).<br>
 And when his mother brought him to her home and made a place for him
 between her children and his uncle Azar knew about him he said: who is
 that that still alive while the king kills all the males? So his mother
 said: this is my son and I gave birth to him at the time of so and so.
 Then Azar said to her: If the king knew about it he will be so mad and
 we'll be not in such a high place, and Azar was in fact a man of a high
 place under the rule of Nimrod and was his minister, and he used to
 give the idols for his children to sell it. So then Abraham's mother
 said: do not worry, if the king did not know about it he will stay with
 us and if he knew about it I will not make you to defend him, and Azar
 used to love Abraham so much whenever he looks at him and used to give
 him the idols to sell them as his children do.<br>
 It is mentioned also that Abraham (PUH) used to tie a rope in the necks
 of the idols and drags them over the ground and say: who would buy what
 harms him and give no benefits, and used to drop them in water and ask
 them to talk as to mock at them and as an insult for them and for
 whoever worships them, so his brothers mentioned that to their father
 Azar and that was so great for him so he warned him and threatened him
 to stop that, but he did not stop so he kept him at home and didn't let
 him go out. Then the people of Abraham and his relatives had a debate
 with him so then he said: </a><a name="006_080">Dispute ye with me
 concerning Allah when He hath guided me ?(Al-An`âm:80). They
 mentioned (PUT) [meaning: the Household PUT] that he was born in the
 first day in the month of Ðul-Hijjah [the 12th month in the lunar
 calendar for Muslims and the month of pilgrimage], and they say that he
 lived for one hundred and fifty seven years and buried in his current
 site in Al-Khaleel (Hebron) in Palestine.<br>
