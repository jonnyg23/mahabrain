 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:626</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Once while a Jew was selling something, he was offered a price that he
 was not pleased with. So, he said, "No, by Him Who gave Moses 
 superiority over all human beings!" Hearing him, an Ansari man got up 
 and slapped him on the face and said, "You say: By Him Who Gave Moses 
 superiority over all human beings although the Prophet (Muhammad) is 
 present amongst us!" The Jew went to the Prophet and said, "O 
 Abu-l-Qasim! I am under the assurance and contract of security, so 
 what right does so-and-so have to slap me?" The Prophet asked the 
 other, "Why have you slapped". He told him the whole story. The 
 Prophet became angry, till anger appeared on his face, and said, 
 "Don't give superiority to any prophet amongst Allah's Prophets, for 
 when the trumpet will be blown, everyone on the earth and in the 
 heavens will become unconscious except those whom Allah will exempt. 
 The trumpet will be blown for the second time and I will be the first 
 to be resurrected to see Moses holding Allah's Throne. I will not know
 whether the unconsciousness which Moses received on the Day of Tur has
 been sufficient for him, or has he got up before me. And I do not say 
 that there is anybody who is better than Yunus bin Matta."
