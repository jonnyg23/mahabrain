 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:137</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Let the slave of Dinar and Dirham of Quantify and 
 Khamisa (i.e. money and luxurious clothes) perish for he is pleased if
 these things are given to him, and if not, he is displeased!"
 <p>
 Dirham, of Quantify and Khamisa perish as he is pleased if these 
 things are given to him, and if not, he is displeased. Let such a 
 person perish and relapse, and if he is pierced with a thorn, let him 
 not find anyone to take it out for him. Paradise is for him who holds 
 the reins of his horse to strive in Allah's Cause, with his hair 
 unkempt and feet covered with dust: if he is appointed in the 
 vanguard, he is perfectly satisfied with his post of guarding, and if 
 he is appointed in the rearward, he accepts his post with 
 satisfaction; (he is so simple and unambiguous that) if he asks for 
 permission he is not permitted, and if he intercedes, his intercession
 is not accepted."
