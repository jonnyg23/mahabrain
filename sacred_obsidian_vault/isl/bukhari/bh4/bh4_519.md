 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:515</h3><p><i>Narrated Sad bin Abi Waqqas:</i></p>
 Once Umar asked the leave to see Allah's Apostle in whose company 
 there were some Quraishi women who were talking to him and asking him 
 for more financial support raising their voices. When 'Umar asked 
 permission to enter the women got up (quickly) hurrying to screen 
 themselves. When Allah's Apostle admitted 'Umar, Allah's Apostle was 
 smiling, 'Umar asked, "O Allah's Apostle! May Allah keep you gay 
 always." Allah's Apostle said, "I am astonished at these women who 
 were with me. As soon as they heard your voice, they hastened to 
 screen themselves." 'Umar said, "O Allah's Apostle! You have more 
 right to be feared by them." Then he addressed (those women) saying, 
 "O enemies of your own souls! Do you fear me and not Allah's Apostle 
 ?" They replied. "Yes, for you are a fearful and fierce man as 
 compared with Allah's Apostle." On that Allah's Apostle said (to 
 'Umar), "By Him in Whose Hands my life is, whenever Satan sees you 
 taking a path, he follows a path other than yours."
