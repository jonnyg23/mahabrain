 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:398</h3><p><i>Narrated Sahl bin Abi Hathma:</i></p>
 'Abdullah bin Sahl and Muhaiyisa bin Mas'ud bin Zaid set out to 
 Khaibar, the inhabitants of which had a peace treaty with the Muslims 
 at that time. They parted and later on Muhaiyisa came upon 'Abdullah 
 bin Sah! and found him murdered agitating in his blood. He buried him 
 and returned to Medina. 'Abdur Rahman bin Sahl, Muhaiyisa and 
 Huwaiuisa, the sons of Mas'ud came to the Prophet and 'Abdur Rahman 
 intended to talk, but the Prophet said (to him), "Let the eldest of 
 you speak." as 'Abdur-Rahman was the youngest:. 'Abdur-Rahman kept 
 silent and the other two spoke. The Prophet said, "If you swear as to 
 who has committed the murder, you will have the right to take your 
 right from the murderer." They said, "How should we swear if we did 
 not witness the murder or see the murderer?" The Prophet said, "Then 
 the Jews can clear themselves from the charge by taking Alaska (an 
 oath taken by men that it was not they who committed the murder)." 
 The!y said, "How should we believe in the oaths of infidels?" So, the 
 Prophet himself paid the blood money (of 'Abdullah). (See 
 Hadith No. 36 Vol. 9.)
