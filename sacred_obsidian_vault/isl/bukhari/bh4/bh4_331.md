 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:327</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 The delegates of the tribe of 'Abdul-Qais came and said, "O Allah's 
 Apostle! We are from the tribe of Rabi'a, and there is the infidels of
 the tribe of Mudar intervening between you and us, so we cannot come 
 to you except in the Sacred Months. So please order us some 
 instructions that we may apply it to ourselves and also invite our 
 people whom we left behind us to observe as well." The Prophet said, 
 "I order you (to do) four (things) and forbid you (to do) four: I 
 order you to believe in Allah, that is, to testify that None has the 
 right to be worshipped but Allah (the Prophet pointed with his hand); 
 to offer prayers perfectly; to pay Zakat; to fast the month of 
 Ramadan, and to pay the Khumus (i.e. one-fifth) of the war booty to 
 Allah and I forbid you to use Ad-dubba', An-Naqir, Al-Hantam and 
 Al-Muzaffat (i.e. utensils used for preparing alcoholic drinks)." (See
 Hadith No. 50, Vol. 1).
