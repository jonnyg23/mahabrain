 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:390</h3><p><i>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle once said to me, "If the revenue of Bahrain came, I 
 would give you this much and this much." When Allah's Apostle had 
 died, the revenue of Bahrain came, and Abu Bakr announced, " Let 
 whoever was promised something by Allah's Apostle come to me." So, I 
 went to Abu Bakr and said, "Allah's Apostle said to me, 'If the 
 revenue of Bahrain came, I would give you this much and this. much." 
 On that Abu Bakr said to me, "Scoop (money) with both your hands." I 
 scooped money with both my hands and Abu Bakr asked me to count it. I 
 counted it and it was five-hundred (gold pieces). The total amount he 
 gave me was one thousand and five hundred (gold pieces.)
 <p>
 said, "Spread it in the Mosque." It was the biggest amount that had 
 ever been brought to Allah's Apostle . In the meantime Al-'Abbas came 
 to him and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Give me, for I gave the ransom of
 myself and Aqil." The Prophet said (to him), "Take." He scooped money 
 with both hands and poured it in his garment and tried to lift it, but
 he could not and appealed to the Prophet, "Will you order someone to 
 help me in lifting it?" The Prophet said, "No." Then Al-'Abbas said, 
 "Then will you yourself help me carry it?" The Prophet said, "No." 
 Then Al 'Abbas threw away some of the money, but even then he was not 
 able to lift it, and so he gain requested the Prophet "Will you order 
 someone to help me carry it?" The Prophet said, "No." Then Al-'Abbas 
 said, "Then will you yourself yelp me carry it?" The Prophet said, 
 'No." So, Al-'Abbas threw away some more money and lifted it on his 
 shoulder and went away. The Prophet kept on looking at him with 
 astonishment at his greediness till he went out of our sight. Allah's 
 Apostle did not get up from there till not a single Dirham remained 
 from that money.
