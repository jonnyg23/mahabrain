 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:409</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 While the Prophet was in the state of prostration, surrounded by a 
 group of people from Quraish pagans. 'Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait came and 
 brought the intestines of a camel and threw them on the back of the 
 Prophet . The Prophet did not raise his head from prostration till 
 Fatima (i.e. his daughter) came and removed those intestines from his 
 back, and invoked evil on whoever had done (the evil deed). The 
 Prophet said, "O Allah! Destroy the chiefs of Quraish, O Allah! 
 Destroy Abu Jahl bin Hisham, 'Utba bin Rabi'a, Shaiba bin Rabi'a. 
 'Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait 'Umaiya bin Khalaf (or Ubai bin Kalaf)." Later on
 I saw all of them killed during the battle of Badr and their bodies 
 were thrown into a well except the body of Umaiya or Ubai, because he 
 was a fat person, and when he was pulled, the parts of his body got 
 separated before he was thrown into the well.
