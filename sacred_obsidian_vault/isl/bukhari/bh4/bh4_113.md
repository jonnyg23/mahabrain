 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:112</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, " Horses are kept for one of three purposes; for
 some people they are a source of reward, for some others they are a 
 means of shelter and for some others they are a source of sins. The 
 one for whom they are a source of reward, is he who keeps a horse for 
 Allah's Cause (i.e. Jihad) tying it with a long tether on a meadow or 
 in a garden with the result that whatever it eats from the area of the
 meadow or the garden where it is tied will be counted as good deeds 
 for his benefit, and if it should break its rope and jump over one or 
 two hillocks then all its dung and its foot marks will be written as 
 good deeds for him; and if it passes by a river and drinks water from 
 it even though he had no intention of watering it, even then he will 
 get the reward for its drinking. As for the man for whom horses are a 
 source of sins, he is the one who keeps a horse for the sake of pride 
 and pretense and showing enmity for Muslims: such a horse will be a 
 source of sins for him. When Allah's Apostle was asked about donkeys, 
 he replied, "Nothing has been revealed to me about them except this 
 unique, comprehensive Verse: "Then anyone who does an atom's (or a 
 small ant's) weight of good shall see it; And anyone who does an 
 atom's (or a small ant's) weight of evil, shall see it.' (101.7-8)
