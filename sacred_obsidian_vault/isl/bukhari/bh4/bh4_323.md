 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:319</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 That he and Abu Talha came in the company of the Prophet and Safiya 
 was accompanying the Prophet, who let her ride behind him on his 
 she-camel. During the journey, the she-camel slipped and both the 
 Prophet and (his) wife fell down. Abu Talha (the sub-narrator thinks 
 that Anas said that Abu Talha jumped from his camel quickly) said, "O 
 Allah's Apostle! May Allah sacrifice me for your sake! Did you get 
 hurt?" The Prophet replied,"No, but take care of the lady." Abu Talha 
 covered his face with his garment and proceeded towards her and 
 covered her with his garment, and she got up. He then set right the 
 condition of their she-camel and both of them (i.e. the Prophet and 
 his wife) rode and proceeded till they approached Medina. The Prophet 
 said, "We are returning with repentance and worshipping and praising 
 our Lord." The Prophet kept on saying this statement till he entered 
 Medina.
