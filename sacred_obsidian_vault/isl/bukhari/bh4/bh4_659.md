 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:656</h3><p><i>Narrated </i></p>
 Narrted Ibn Abbas:
 <p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "You will be resurrected (and assembled) 
 bare-footed, naked and uncircumcised." The Prophet then recited the 
 Divine Verse:-- "As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it: A
 promise We have undertaken. Truly we shall do it." (21.104)
 </p><p>
 He added, "The first to be dressed will be Abraham. Then some of my 
 companions will take to the right and to the left. I will say: 'My 
 companions! 'It will be said, 'They had been renegades since you left 
 them.' I will then say what the Pious Slave Jesus, the son of Mary 
 said: 'And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them; when 
 You did take me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a 
 Witness to all things. If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and 
 if you forgive them, You, only You are the All-Mighty the All-Wise.' "
 from Islam during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr who fought them".
