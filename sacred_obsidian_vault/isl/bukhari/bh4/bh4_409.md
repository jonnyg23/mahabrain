 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:405</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Amash:</i></p>
 I asked Abu Wail, "Did you take part in the battle of Siffin?" He 
 said, 'Yes, and I heard Sahl bin Hunaif (when he was blamed for lack 
 of zeal for fighting) saying, "You'd better blame your wrong opinions.
 I wish you had seen me on the day of Abu Jandal.  If I had the courage
 to disobey the Prophet's orders, I would have done so. We had kept out
 swords on our necks and shoulders, for a thing which frightened us. 
 And we did so, we found it easier for us, except in the case of the 
 above battle (of ours).' "
