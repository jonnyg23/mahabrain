 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:261</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 A group of eight men from the tribe of 'Ukil came to the Prophet and 
 then they found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So, they 
 said, "O Allah's Apostle! Provide us with some milk." Allah's Apostle 
 said, "I recommend that you should join the herd of camels." So they 
 went and drank the urine and the milk of the camels (as a medicine) 
 till they became healthy and fat. Then they killed the shepherd and 
 drove away the camels, and they became unbelievers after whey were 
 Muslims. When the Prophet was informed by a shouter for help, he sent 
 some men in their pursuit, and before the sun rose high, they were 
 brought, and he had their hands and feet cut off. Then he ordered for 
 nails which were heated and passed over their eyes, and whey were left
 in the Harra (i.e. rocky land in Medina). They asked for water, and 
 nobody provided them with water till they died (Abu Qilaba, a 
 sub-narrator said, "They committed murder and theft and fought against
 Allah and His Apostle, and spread evil in the land.")
