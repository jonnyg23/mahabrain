 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:116</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Ishaq:</i></p>
 Somebody asked Al-Bar-a bin 'Azib, "Did you flee deserting Allah's 
 Apostle during the battle of Hunain?" Al-Bara replied, "But Allah's 
 Apostle did not flee. The people of the Tribe of Hawazin were good 
 archers. When we met them, we attacked them, and they fled. When the 
 Muslims started collecting the war booty, the pagans faced us with 
 arrows, but Allah's Apostle did not flee. No doubt, I saw him on his 
 white mule and Abu Sufyan was holding its reins and the Prophet was 
 saying, 'I am the Prophet in truth: I am the son of 'Abdul Muttalib.'
