 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 4:384</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Umar bin Dinar:</i></p>
 I was sitting with Jabir bin Zaid and 'Amr bin Aus, and Bjalla was 
 narrating to them in 70 A.H. the year when Musab bin Az-Zubair was the
 leader of the pilgrims of Basra. We were sitting at the steps of 
 Zam-zam well and Bajala said, "I was the clerk of Juz bin Muawiya, 
 Al-Ahnaf's paternal uncle. A letter came from 'Umar bin Al-Khattab one
 year before his death; and it was read:-- "Cancel every marriage 
 contracted among the Magians between relatives of close kinship 
 (marriages that are regarded illegal in Islam: a relative of this sort
 being called Dhu-Mahram.)" 'Umar did not take the Jizya from the 
 Magian infidels till 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf testified that Allah's 
 Apostle had taken the Jizya from the Magians of Hajar.
