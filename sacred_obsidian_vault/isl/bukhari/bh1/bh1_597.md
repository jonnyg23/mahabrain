 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:595</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The Adhan pronounced by Bilal should not stop you 
 from taking Suhur, for he pronounces the Adhan at night, so that the 
 one offering the late night prayer (Tahajjud) from among you might 
 hurry up and the sleeping from among you might wake up. It does not 
 mean that dawn or morning has started." Then he (the Prophet) pointed 
 with his fingers and raised them up (towards the sky) and then lowered
 them (towards the earth) like this (Ibn Mas'ud imitated the gesture of
 the Prophet). Az-Zuhri gestured with his two index fingers which he 
 put on each other and then stretched them to the right and left. These
 gestures illustrate the way real dawn appears. It spreads left and 
 right horizontally. The dawn that appears in the high sky and lowers 
 down is not the real dawn) .
