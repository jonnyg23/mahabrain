 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:768</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Bakr bin 'Abdur Rahman Ibn Harith bin Hisham and Abu </i></p>
 Salama bin 'Abdur Rahman:
 <p>
 Abu Huraira used to say Takbir in all the prayers, compulsory and 
 optional -- in the month of Ramadan or other months. He used to say 
 Takbir on standing for prayer and on bowing; then he would say, 
 "Salmi'a-l-lahu Liman hamida," and before prostrating he would say 
 "Rabbana walaka-l-hamd." Then he would say Takbir on prostrating and 
 on raising his head from the prostration, then another Takbir on 
 prostrating (for the second time), and on raising his head from the 
 prostration. He also would say the Takbir on standing from the second 
 Rak'a. He used to do the same in every Rak'a till he completed the 
 prayer. On completion of the prayer, he would say, "By Him in Whose 
 Hands my soul is! No doubt my prayer is closer to that of Allah's 
 Apostle than yours, and this was His prayer till he left this world." 
 And Abu Huraira said, "When Allah's Apostle raised his head from 
 (bowing) he used to say "Sami' a-l-lahu Liman hamida, Rabbana 
 walakal-hamd." He Would invoke Allah for some people by naming them: 
 "O Allah! Save Al-Walid bin Al-Walid and Salama bin Hisham and 'Aiyash
 bin Abi Rabi'a and the weak and the helpless people among the faithful
 believers O Allah! Be hard on the tribe of Mudar and let them suffer 
 from famine years like that of the time of Joseph." In those days the 
 Eastern section of the tribe of Mudar was against the Prophet.
