 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:63</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 While we were sitting with the Prophet in the mosque, a man came 
 riding on a camel. He made his camel kneel down in the mosque, tied 
 its foreleg and then said: "Who amongst you is Muhammad?" At that time
 the Prophet  was sitting amongst us (his companions) leaning on his 
 arm. We replied, "This white man reclining on his arm." The an then 
 addressed him, "O Son of 'Abdul Muttalib."
 <p>
 The Prophet said, "I am here to answer your questions." The man said 
 to the Prophet, "I want to ask you something and will be hard in 
 questioning. So do not get angry." The Prophet said, "Ask whatever you
 want." The man said, "I ask you by your Lord, and the Lord of those 
 who were before you, has Allah sent you as an Apostle to all the 
 mankind?" The Prophet replied, "By Allah, yes." The man further said, 
 "I ask you by Allah. Has Allah ordered you to offer five prayers in a 
 day and night (24 hours).? He replied, "By Allah, Yes." The man 
 further said, "I ask you by Allah! Has Allah ordered you to observe 
 fasts during this month of the year (i.e. Ramadan)?" He replied, "By 
 Allah, Yes." The man further said, "I ask you by Allah. Has Allah 
 ordered you to take Zakat (obligatory charity) from our rich people 
 and distribute it amongst our poor people?" The Prophet replied, "By 
 Allah, yes." Thereupon that man said, "I have believed in all that 
 with which you have been sent, and I have been sent by my people as a 
 messenger, and I am Dimam bin Tha'laba from the brothers of Bani Sa'd 
 bin Bakr."
