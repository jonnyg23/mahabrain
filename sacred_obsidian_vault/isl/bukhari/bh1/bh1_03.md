 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:4</h3><p><i>Narrated Said bin Jubair:</i></p>
 Ibn 'Abbas in the explanation of the Statement of Allah. 'Move not 
 your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith." (75.16) 
 Said "Allah's Apostle used to bear the revelation with great trouble 
 and used to move his lips (quickly) with the Inspiration." Ibn 'Abbas 
 moved his lips saying, "I am moving my lips in front of you as Allah's
 Apostle used to move his." Said moved his lips saying: "I am moving my
 lips, as I saw Ibn 'Abbas moving his." Ibn 'Abbas added, "So Allah 
 revealed 'Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur'an) to make haste 
 therewith. It is for us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad) the
 ability to recite it (the Qur'an) (75.16-17) which means that Allah 
 will make him (the Prophet ) remember the portion of the Qur'an which 
 was revealed at that time by heart and recite it. The Statement of 
 Allah: And 'When we have recited it to you (O Muhammad through 
 Gabriel) then you follow its (Qur'an) recital' (75.18) means 'listen 
 to it and be silent.' Then it is for Us (Allah) to make It clear to 
 you' (75.19) means 'Then it is (for Allah) to make you recite it (and 
 its meaning will be clear by itself through your tongue). Afterwards, 
 Allah's Apostle used to listen to Gabriel whenever he came and after 
 his departure he used to recite it as Gabriel had recited it."
