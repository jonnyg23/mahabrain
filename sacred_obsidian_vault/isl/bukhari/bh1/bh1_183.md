 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:183</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:</i></p>
 that he stayed overnight in the house of Maimuna the wife of the 
 Prophet, his aunt. He added : I lay on the bed (cushion transversally)
 while Allah's Apostle and his wife lay in the length-wise direction of
 the cushion. Allah's Apostle slept till the middle of the night, 
 either a bit before or a bit after it and then woke up, rubbing the 
 traces of sleep off his face with his hands. He then, recited the last
 ten verses of Sura Al-Imran, got up and went to a hanging water-skin. 
 He then Performed the ablution from it and it was a perfect ablution, 
 and then stood up to offer the prayer. I, too, got up and did as the 
 Prophet had done. Then I went and stood by his side. He placed his 
 right hand on my head and caught my right ear and twisted it. He 
 prayed two Rakat then two Rakat and two Rakat and then two Rakat and 
 then two Rakat and then two Rakat (separately six times), and finally 
 one Rak'a (the Witr). Then he lay down again in the bed till the 
 Mu'adhdhin came to him where upon the Prophet got up, offered a two 
 light Rakat prayer and went out and led the Fajr prayer
