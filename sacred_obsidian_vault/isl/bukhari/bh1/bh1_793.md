 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:791</h3><p><i>Narrated Muhammad bin 'Amr bin 'Ata':</i></p>
 I was sitting with some of the companions of Allah's Apostle and we 
 were discussing about the way of praying of the Prophet. Abu Humaid 
 As-Saidi said, "I remember the prayer of Allah's Apostle better than 
 any one of you. I saw him raising both his hands up to the level of 
 the shoulders on saying the Takbir; and on bowing he placed his hands 
 on both knees and bent his back straight, then he stood up straight 
 from bowing till all the vertebrate took their normal positions. In 
 prostrations, he placed both his hands on the ground with the forearms
 away from the ground and away from his body, and his toes were facing 
 the Qibla. On sitting In the second Rak'a he sat on his left foot and 
 propped up the right one; and in the last Rak'a he pushed his left 
 foot forward and kept the other foot propped up and sat over the 
 buttocks "
