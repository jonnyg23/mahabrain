 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:342</h3><p><i>Narrated Shaqiq bin Salama:</i></p>
 I was with 'Abdullah and Abu Musa; the latter asked the former, "O Abu
 AbdurRahman! What is your opinion if somebody becomes Junub and no 
 water is available?" 'Abdullah replied, "Do not pray till water is 
 found." Abu Musa said, "What do you say about the statement of 'Ammar 
 (who was ordered by the Prophet to perform Tayammum). The Prophet said
 to him: "Perform Tayammum and that would be sufficient." 'Abdullah 
 replied, "Don't you see that 'Umar was not satisfied by 'Ammar's 
 statement?" Abu- Musa said, "All right, leave 'Ammalr's statement, but
 what will you say about this verse (of Tayammum)?" 'Abqiullah kept 
 quiet and then said, "If we allowed it, then they would probably 
 perform Tayammum even if water was available, if one of them found it 
 (water) cold." The narrator added, "I said to Shaqrq, "Then did 
 'Abdullah dislike to perform Tayammum because of this?" He replied, 
 "Yes."
