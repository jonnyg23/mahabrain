 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:624</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "While a man was going on a way, he saw a thorny
 branch and removed it from the way and Allah became pleased by his 
 action and forgave him for that." Then the Prophet said, "Five are 
 martyrs: One who dies of plague, one who dies of an abdominal disease,
 one who dies of drowning, one who is buried alive (and) dies and one 
 who is killed in Allah's cause." (The Prophet further said, "If the 
 people knew the reward for pronouncing the Adhan and for standing in 
 the first row (in the congregational prayer) and found no other way to
 get it except by drawing lots they would do so, and if they knew the 
 reward of offering the Zuhr prayer early (in its stated time), they 
 would race for it and they knew the reward for 'Isha' and Fajr prayers
 in congregation, they would attend them even if they were to crawl')
