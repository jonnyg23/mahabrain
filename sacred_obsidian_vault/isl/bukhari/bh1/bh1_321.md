 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:321</h3><p><i>Narrated Aiyub:</i></p>
 Hafsa said, 'We used to forbid our young women to go out for the two 
 'Id prayers. A woman came and stayed at the palace of Bani Khalaf and 
 she narrated about her sister whose husband took part in twelve holy 
 battles along with the Prophet and her sister was with her husband in 
 six (out of these twelve). She (the woman's sister) said, "We used to 
 treat the wounded, look after the patients and once I asked the 
 Prophet, 'Is there any harm for any of us to stay at home if she 
 doesn't have a veil?' He said, 'She should cover herself with the veil
 of her companion and should participate in the good deeds and in the 
 religious gathering of the Muslims.' When Um 'Atiya came I asked her 
 whether she had heard it from the Prophet. She replied, "Yes. May my 
 father be sacrificed for him (the Prophet)! (Whenever she mentioned 
 the Prophet she used to say, 'May my father be sacrificed for him) I 
 have heard the Prophet saying, 'The unmarried young virgins and the 
 mature girl who stay often screened or the young unmarried virgins who
 often stay screened and the menstruating women should come out and 
 participate in the good deeds as well as the religious gathering of 
 the faithful believers but the menstruating women should keep away 
 from the Musalla (praying place).' " Hafsa asked Um 'Atiya 
 surprisingly, "Do you say the menstruating women?" She replied, 
 "Doesn't a menstruating woman attend 'Arafat (Hajj) and such and such 
 (other deeds)?"
