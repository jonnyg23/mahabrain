 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:394</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah:</i></p>
 The Prophet prayed (and the subnarrator Ibrahim said, "I do not know 
 whether he prayed more or less than usual"), and when he had finished 
 the prayers he was asked, "O Allah's Apostle! Has there been any 
 change in the prayers?" He said, "What is it?' The people said, "You 
 have prayed so much and so much." So the Prophet bent his legs, faced 
 the Qibla and performed two prostrations (of Sahu) and finished his 
 prayers with Tasiim (by turning his face to right and left saying: 
 'As-Salamu'Alaikum-Warahmat-ullah'). When he turned his face to us he 
 said, "If there had been anything changed in the prayer, surely I 
 would have informed you but I am a human being like you and liable to 
 forget like you. So if I forget remind me and if anyone of you is 
 doubtful about his prayer, he should follow what he thinks to be 
 correct and complete his prayer accordingly and finish it and do two 
 prostrations (of Sahu)."
