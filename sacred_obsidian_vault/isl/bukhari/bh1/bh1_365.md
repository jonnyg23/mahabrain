 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:365</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 On the Day of Nahr (10th of Dhul-Hijja, in the year prior to the last 
 Hajj of the Prophet when Abu Bakr was the leader of the pilgrims in 
 that Hajj) Abu Bakr sent me along with other announcers to Mina to 
 make a public announcement: "No pagan is allowed to perform Hajj after
 this year and no naked person is allowed to perform the Tawaf around 
 the Ka'ba. Then Allah's Apostle sent 'All to read out the Surat Bara'a
 (At-Tauba) to the people; so he made the announcement along with us on
 the day of Nahr in Mina: "No pagan is allowed to perform Hajj after 
 this year and no naked person is allowed to perform the Tawaf around 
 the Ka'ba."
