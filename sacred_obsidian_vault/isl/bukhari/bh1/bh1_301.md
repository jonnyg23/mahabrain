 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:301</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</i></p>
 Once Allah's Apostle went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) o 
 'Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, 
 "O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers 
 of Hell-fire were you (women)." They asked, "Why is it so, O Allah's 
 Apostle ?" He replied, "You curse frequently and are ungrateful to 
 your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence 
 and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by 
 some of you." The women asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What is deficient 
 in our intelligence and religion?" He said, "Is not the evidence of 
 two women equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the 
 affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence. 
 Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her 
 menses?" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the 
 deficiency in her religion."
