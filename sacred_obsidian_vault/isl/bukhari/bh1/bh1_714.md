 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:712</h3><p><i>Narrated Asma' bint Abi Bakr:</i></p>
 The Prophet once offered the eclipse prayer. He stood for a long time 
 and then did a prolonged bowing. He stood up straight again and kept 
 on standing for a long time, then bowed a long bowing and then stood 
 up straight and then prostrated a prolonged prostration and then 
 lifted his head and prostrated a prolonged prostration. And then he 
 stood up for a long time and then did a prolonged bowing and then 
 stood up straight again and kept on standing for a long time. Then he 
 bowed a long bowing and then stood up straight and then prostrated a 
 prolonged prostration and then lifted his head and went for a 
 prolonged prostration. On completion o the prayer, he said, "Paradise 
 became s near to me that if I had dared, I would have plucked one of 
 its bunches for you and Hell became so near to me that said, 'O my 
 Lord will I be among those people?' Then suddenly I saw a woman and a 
 cat was lacerating her with it claws. On inquiring, it was said that 
 the woman had imprisoned the cat till it died of starvation and she 
 neither fed it no freed it so that it could feed itself."
