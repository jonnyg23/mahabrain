 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:804</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 Some poor people came to the Prophet and said, "The wealthy people 
 will get higher grades and will have permanent enjoyment and they pray
 like us and fast as we do. They have more money by which they perform 
 the Hajj, and 'Umra; fight and struggle in Allah's Cause and give in 
 charity." The Prophet said, "Shall I not tell you a thing upon which 
 if you acted you would catch up with those who have surpassed you? 
 Nobody would overtake you and you would be better than the people 
 amongst whom you live except those who would do the same. Say 
 "Sub-han-al-lah", "Alhamdu-lillah" and "Allahu Akbar" thirty three 
 times each after every (compulsory) prayer." We differed and some of 
 us said that we should say, "Subhan-al-lah" thirty three times and 
 "Alhamdu lillah" thirty three times and "Allahu Akbar" thirty four 
 times. I went to the Prophet who said, "Say, "Subhan-al-lah" and 
 "Alhamdu lillah" and "Allahu Akbar" all together for thirty three 
 times."
