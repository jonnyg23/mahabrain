 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 1:680</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 When the Prophet, became ill in his fatal illness, Someone came to 
 inform him about the prayer, and the Prophet told him to tell Abu Bakr
 to lead the people in the prayer. I said, "Abu Bakr is a soft-hearted 
 man and if he stands for the prayer in your place, he would weep and 
 would not be able to recite the Qur'an." The Prophet said, "Tell Abu 
 Bakr to lead the prayer." I said the same as before. He (repeated the 
 same order and) on the third or the fourth time he said, "You are the 
 companions of Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to lead the prayer." So Abu Bakr 
 led the prayer and meanwhile the Prophet felt better and came out with
 the help of two men; as if I see him just now dragging his feet on the
 ground. When Abu Bakr saw him, he tried to retreat but the Prophet 
 beckoned him to carry on. Abu Bakr retreated a bit and the Prophet sat
 on his (left) side. Abu Bakr was repeating the Takbir (Allahu Akbar) 
 of Allah's Apostle for the people to hear.
