 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:106</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</i></p>
 Once I passed the night in the house of Maimuna (his aunt). I slept 
 across the bed while Allah's Apostle and his wife slept length-wise. 
 The Prophet slept till midnight or nearly so and woke up rubbing his 
 face and recited ten verses from Surat "Aal-Imran." Allah's Apostle 
 went towards a leather skin and performed ablution in the most perfect
 way and then stood for the prayer. I did the same and stood beside 
 him. The Prophet put his right hand on my head, twisted my ear and 
 then prayed two Rakat five times and then ended his prayer with Witr. 
 He laid down till the Muadh-dhin came then he stood up and offered two
 Rakat (Sunna of Fajr prayer) and then went out and offered the Fajr 
 prayer.
