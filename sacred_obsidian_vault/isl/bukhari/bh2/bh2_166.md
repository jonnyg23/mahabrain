 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:167</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Musa:</i></p>
 The sun eclipsed and the Prophet got up, being afraid that it might be
 the Hour (i.e. Day of Judgment). He went to the Mosque and offered the
 prayer with the longest Qiyam, bowing and prostration that I had ever 
 seen him doing. Then he said, "These signs which Allah sends do not 
 occur because of the life or death of somebody, but Allah makes His 
 worshipers afraid by them. So when you see anything thereof, proceed 
 to remember Allah, invoke Him and ask for His forgiveness."
