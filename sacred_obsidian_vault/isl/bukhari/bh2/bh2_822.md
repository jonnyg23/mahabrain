 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:820</h3><p><i>Narrated Nafi:</i></p>
 Ibn 'Umar used to spend the night at Dhi-Tuwa in between the two 
 Thaniyas and then he would enter Mecca through the Thaniya which is at
 the higher region of Mecca, and whenever he came to Mecca for Hajj or 
 'Umra, he never made his she camel kneel down except near the gate of 
 the Masjid (Sacred Mosque) and then he would enter (it) and go to the 
 Black (stone) Corner and start from there circumambulating the Ka'ba 
 seven times: hastening in the first three rounds (Ramal) and walking 
 in the last four. On finishing, he would offer two Rakat prayer and 
 set out to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa before returning to 
 his dwelling place. On returning (to Medina) from Hajj or 'Umra, he 
 used to make his camel kneel down at Al-Batha which is at 
 Dhu-l-Hulaifa, the place where the Prophet used to make his camel 
 kneel down.
