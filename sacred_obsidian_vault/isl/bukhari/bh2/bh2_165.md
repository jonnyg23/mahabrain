 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:166</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 In the lifetime of the Prophet the sun eclipsed and the Prophet 
 (p.b.u.h) stood up to offer the prayer with the people and recited a 
 long recitation, then he performed a prolonged bowing, and then lifted
 his head and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter than the
 first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the
 first and then lifted his head and performed two prostrations. He then
 stood up for the second Raka and offered it like the first. Then he 
 stood up and said, "The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of 
 someone's life or death but they are two signs amongst the signs of 
 Allah which He shows to His worshipers. So whenever you see them, make
 haste for the prayer."
