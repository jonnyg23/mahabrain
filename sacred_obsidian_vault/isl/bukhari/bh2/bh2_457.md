 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:456</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "When (Allah's) slave is put in his grave and 
 his companions return and he even hears their footsteps, two angels 
 come to him and make him sit and ask, 'What did you use to say about 
 this man (i.e. Muhammad)?' The faithful Believer will say, 'I testify 
 that he is Allah's slave and His Apostle.' Then they will say to him, 
 'Look at your place in the Hell Fire; Allah has given you a place in 
 Paradise instead of it.' So he will see both his places." (Qatada 
 said, "We were informed that his grave would be made spacious." Then 
 Qatada went back to the narration of Anas who said;) Whereas a 
 hypocrite or a non-believer will be asked, "What did you use to say 
 about this man." He will reply, "I do not know; but I used to say what
 the people used to say." So they will say to him, "Neither did you 
 know nor did you take the guidance (by reciting the Quran)." Then he 
 will be hit with iron hammers once, that he will send such a cry as 
 everything near to him will hear, except Jinns and human beings. (See 
 Hadith No. 422).
