 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:334</h3><p><i>Narrated Kharija bin Zaid bin Thabit:</i></p>
 Um Al-'Ala', an Ansari woman who gave the pledge of allegiance to the 
 Prophet said to me, "The emigrants were distributed amongst us by 
 drawing lots and we got in our share 'Uthman bin Maz'un. We made him 
 stay with us in our house. Then he suffered from a disease which 
 proved fatal when he died and was given a bath and was shrouded in his
 clothes, Allah's Apostle came I said, 'May Allah be merciful to you, O
 Abu As-Sa'ib! I testify that Allah has honored you'. The Prophet said,
 'How do you know that Allah has honored him?' I replied, 'O Allah's 
 Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed for you! On whom else shall Allah
 bestow His honor?' The Prophet said, 'No doubt, death came to him. By 
 Allah, I too wish him good, but by Allah, I do not know what Allah 
 will do with me though I am Al lah's Apostle. ' By Allah, I never 
 attested the piety of anyone after that."
