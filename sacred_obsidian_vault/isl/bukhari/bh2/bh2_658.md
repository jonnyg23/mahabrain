 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:656</h3><p><i>Narrated Yazid bin Ruman from 'Urwa:</i></p>
 'Aisha said that the Prophet said to her, "O Aisha! Were your nation 
 not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, I would have had the
 Ka'ba demolished and would have included in it the portion which had 
 been left, and would have made it at a level with the ground and would
 have made two doors for it, one towards the east and the other towards
 the west, and then by doing this it would have been built on the 
 foundations laid by Abraham." That was what urged Ibn-Az-Zubair to 
 demolish the Ka'ba. Jazz said, "I saw Ibn-Az-Zubair when he demolished
 and rebuilt the Ka'ba and included in it a portion of Al-Hijr (the 
 unroofed portion of Ka'ba which is at present in the form of a 
 compound towards the north-west of the Ka'ba). I saw the original 
 foundations of Abraham which were of stones resembling the humps of 
 camels." So Jarir asked Yazid, "Where was the place of those stones?" 
 Jazz said, "I will just now show it to you." So Jarir accompanied 
 Yazid and entered Al-Hijr, and Jazz pointed to a place and said, "Here
 it is." Jarir said, "It appeared to me about six cubits from Al-Hijr 
 or so."
