 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:629</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 Ali came to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) from Yemen (to Mecca). The Prophet 
 asked Ali, "With what intention have you assumed Ihram?" Ali replied, 
 "I have assumed Ihram with the same intention as that of the Prophet."
 The Prophet said, "If I had not the Hadi with me I would have finished
 the Ihram." Muhammad bin Bakr narrated extra from Ibn Juraij, "The 
 Prophet said to Ali, "With what intention have you assumed the Ihram, 
 O Ali?" He replied, "With the same (intention) as that of the 
 Prophet." The Prophet said, "Have a Hadi and keep your Ihram as it 
 is."
