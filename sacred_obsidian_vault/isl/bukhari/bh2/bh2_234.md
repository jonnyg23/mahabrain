 Anas bin Malik said, "The Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Zaid bin Thabit took 
 their Suhur together. When they finished it, the Prophet stood for the
 (Fajr) prayer and offered it." We asked Anas, "What was the interval 
 between their finishing the Suhur and the starting of the morning 
 prayer?" Anas replied, "It was equal to the time taken by a person in 
 reciting fifty verses of the Quran."
