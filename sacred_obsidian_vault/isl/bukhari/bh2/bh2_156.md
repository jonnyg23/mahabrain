 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:157</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 (the wife of the Prophet) On the day when the sun Khasafat (eclipsed) 
 Allah's Apostle prayed; he stood up and said Takbir and recited a 
 prolonged recitation, then he performed a prolonged bowing, then he 
 raised his head and said, "Sami'a-l-lahu Lyman Hamidah," and then 
 remained standing and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter
 than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter
 than the first. Then he prostrated and prolonged the prostration and 
 he did the same in the second Raka as in the first and then finished 
 the prayer with Taslim. By that time the sun (eclipse) had cleared He 
 addressed the people and said, "The sun and the moon are two of the 
 signs of Allah; they do not eclipse (Yakhsifan) because of the death 
 or the life (i.e. birth) of someone. So when you see them make haste 
 for the prayer."
