 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:94</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdur Rahman bin 'Abis:</i></p>
 Ibn  Abbas was asked whether he had joined the Prophet in the 'Id 
 prayer. He said, "Yes. And I could not have joined him had I not been 
 young. (The Prophet came out) till he reached the mark which was near 
 the house of Kathir bin As-Salt, offered the prayer, delivered the 
 Khutba and then went towards the women. Bilal was accompanying him. He
 preached to them and advised them and ordered them to give alms. I saw
 the women putting their ornaments with their outstretched hands into 
 Bilal's garment. Then the Prophet along with Bilal returned home.
