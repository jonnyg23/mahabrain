 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:386</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 When the Prophet got the news of the death of Ibn Haritha, Ja'far and 
 Ibn Rawaha he sat down and looked sad and I was looking at him through
 the chink of the door. A man came and told him about the crying of the
 women of Ja'far. The Prophet ordered him to forbid them. The man went 
 and came back saying that he had told them but they did not listen to 
 him. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Forbid them." So again he went and 
 came back for the third time and said, "O Allah's Apostle! By Allah, 
 they did not listen to us at all." ('Aisha added): Allah's Apostle 
 ordered him to go and put dust in their mouths. I said, (to that man) 
 "May Allah stick your nose in the dust (i.e. humiliate you)! You could
 neither (persuade the women to) fulfill the order of Allah's Apostle 
 nor did you relieve Allah's Apostle from fatigue. "
