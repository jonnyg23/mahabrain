 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:302</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Azraq bin Qais:</i></p>
 We were at Al-Ahwaz fighting the AlHaruriya (tribe). While I was at 
 the bank of a river a man was praying and the reins of his animal were
 in his hands and the animal was struggling and he was following the 
 animal. (Shu'ba, a sub-narrator, said that man was Abu Barza 
 al-Aslaml). A man from the Khawarij said, "O Allah! Be harsh to this 
 sheik." And when the sheik (Abu Barza) finished his prayer, he said, 
 "I heard your remark. No doubt, I participated with Allah's Apostle in
 six or seven or eight holy battles and saw his leniency, and no doubt,
 I would rather retain my animal than let it return to its stable, as 
 it would cause me much trouble. "
