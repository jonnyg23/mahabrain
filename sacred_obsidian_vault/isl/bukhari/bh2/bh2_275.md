 I heard Anas bin Malik al-Ansari saying, "An Ansari man, who was very 
 fat, said to the Prophet, 'I am unable to present myself for the

 to his house. He washed one side of a mat with water and the Prophet

 Al-Jarud asked Anas, "Did the Prophet use to offer the Duha prayer?" 
 Anas replied, "I never saw him praying (the Duha prayer) except on 
 that day."
