 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:545</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Amr bin Al-Harith:</i></p>
 Zainab, the wife of 'Abdullah said, "I was in the Mosque and saw the 
 Prophet (p.b.u.h) saying, 'O women ! Give alms even from your 
 ornaments.' " Zainab used to provide for 'Abdullah and those orphans 
 who were under her protection. So she said to 'Abdullah, "Will you ask
 Allah's Apostle whether it will be sufficient for me to spend part of 
 the Zakat on you and the orphans who are under my protection?" He 
 replied "Will you yourself ask Allah's Apostle ?" (Zainab added): So I
 went to the Prophet and I saw there an Ansari woman who was standing 
 at the door (of the Prophet ) with a similar problem as mine. Bilal 
 passed by us and we asked him, 'Ask the Prophet whether it is 
 permissible for me to spend (the Zakat) on my husband and the orphans 
 under my protection.' And we requested Bilal not to inform the Prophet
 about us. So Bilal went inside and asked the Prophet regarding our 
 problem. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked, "Who are those two?" Bilal 
 replied that she was Zainab. The Prophet said, "Which Zainab?" Bilal 
 said, "The wife of 'Adullah (bin Masud)." The Prophet said, "Yes, (it 
 is sufficient for her) and she will receive a double rewards (for 
 that): One for helping relatives, and the other for giving Zakat."
