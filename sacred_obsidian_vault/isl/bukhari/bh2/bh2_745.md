 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:743</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid</i></p>
 I went out with 'Abdullah , to Mecca and when we proceeded to am' he 
 offered the two prayers (the Maghrib and the 'Isha') together, making 
 the Adhan and Iqama separately for each prayer. He took his supper in 
 between the two prayers. He offered the Fajr prayer as soon as the day
 dawned. Some people said, "The day had dawned (at the time of the 
 prayer)," and others said, "The day had not dawned." 'Abdullah then 
 said, "Allah's Apostle said, 'These two prayers have been shifted from
 their stated times at this place only (at Al-Muzdalifa); first: The 
 Maghrib and the 'Isha'. So the people should not arrive at 
 Al-Muzdalifa till the time of the 'Isha' prayer has become due. The 
 second prayer is the morning prayer which is offered at this hour.' " 
 Then 'Abdullah stayed there till it became a bit brighter. He then 
 said, "If the chief of the believers hastened onwards to Mina just 
 now, then he had indeed followed the Sunna." I do not know which 
 proceeded the other, his ('Abdullah's) statement or the departure of 
 'Uthman . Abdullah was reciting Talbiya till he threw pebbles at the 
 Jamrat-al-'Aqaba on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering) (that is the 10th 
 of Dhul-Hijja).
