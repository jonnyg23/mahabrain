 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:75</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Bara' bin 'Azib:</i></p>
 The Prophet delivered the Khutba after offering the prayer on the Day 
 of Nahr and said, "Whoever offers the prayer like us and slaughters 
 like us then his Nusuk (sacrifice) will be accepted by Allah. And 
 whoever slaughters his sacrifice before the 'Id prayer then he has not
 done the sacrifice." Abi Burda bin Niyar, the uncle of Al-Bara' said, 
 "O Allah's Apostle! I have slaughtered my sheep before the 'Id prayer 
 and I thought today as a day of eating and drinking (not alcoholic 
 drinks), and I liked that my sheep should be the first to be 
 slaughtered in my house. So slaughtered my sheep and took my food 
 before coming for the prayer." The Prophet said, "The sheep which you 
 have slaughtered is just mutton (not a Nusuk)." He (Abu Burda) said, 
 "O Allah's Apostle! I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than
 two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a Nusuk on my behalf? "The 
 Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Yes, it will be sufficient for you but it 
 will not be sufficient (as a Nusuk) for anyone else after you."
