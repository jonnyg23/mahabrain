 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:714</h3><p><i>Narrated Hafsa:</i></p>
 (On 'Id) We used to forbid our virgins to go out (for 'Id prayer). A 
 lady came and stayed at the Palace of Bani Khalaf. She mentioned that 
 her sister was married to one of the companions of Allah's Apostle who
 participated in twelve Ghazawats along with Allah's Apostle and her 
 sister was with him in six of them. She said, "We used to dress the 
 wounded and look after the patients." She (her sister) asked Allah's 
 Apostle , "Is there any harm for a woman to stay at home if she 
 doesn't have a veil?" He said, "She should cover herself with the veil
 of her companion and she should take part in the good deeds and in the
 religious gatherings of the believers." When Um 'Atiyya came, I asked 
 her. "Did you hear anything about that?" Um 'Atiyya said, "Bi Abi" and
 she never mentioned the name of Allah's Apostle without saying "Bi 
 Abi" (i.e. 'Let my father be sacrificed for you'). We asked her, "Have
 you heard Allah's Apostle saying so and so (about women)?" She replied
 in the affirmative and said, "Let my father be sacrificed for him. He 
 told us that unmarried mature virgins who stay often screened or 
 unmarried young virgins and mature girls who stay often screened 
 should come out and take part in the good deeds and in the religious 
 gatherings of the believers. But the menstruating women should keep 
 away from the Musalla (praying place)." I asked her, "The menstruating
 women?" She replied, "Don't they present themselves at 'Arafat and at 
 such and such places?"
