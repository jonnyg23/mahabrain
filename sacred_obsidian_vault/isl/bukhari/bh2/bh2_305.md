 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 2:303</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Aisha:</i></p>
 Once the sun eclipsed and Allah's Apostle stood up for the prayer and 
 recited a very long Sura and when bowed for a long while and then 
 raised his head and started reciting another Sura. Then he bowed, and 
 after finishing, he prostrated and did the same in the second Raka and
 then said, "These (lunar and solar eclipses) are two of the signs of 
 Allah and if you see them, pray till the eclipse is over. No doubt, 
 while standing at this place I saw everything promised to me by Allah 
 and I saw (Paradise) and I wanted to pluck a bunch (of grapes) 
 therefrom, at the time when you saw me stepping forward. No doubt, I 
 saw Hell with its different parts destroying each other when you saw 
 me retreating and in it I saw 'Amr bin Luhai who started the tradition
 of freeing animals (set them free) in the name of idols."
