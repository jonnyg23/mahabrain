 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:106</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle told us a long narrative about Ad-Dajjal, and among 
 the many things he mentioned, was his saying, "Ad-Dajjal will come and
 it will be forbidden for him to pass through the entrances of Medina. 
 He will land in some of the salty barren areas (outside) Medina; on 
 that day the best man or one of the best men will come up to him and 
 say, 'I testify that you are the same Dajjal whose description was 
 given to us by Allah's Apostle .' Ad-Dajjal will say to the people, 
 'If I kill this man and bring him back to life again, will you doubt 
 my claim?' They will say, 'No.' Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and 
 bring him back to life. That man will say, 'Now I know your reality 
 better than before.' Ad-Dajjal will say, 'I want to kill him but I 
 cannot.' "
