 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:560</h3><p><i>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid:</i></p>
 A man came to Allah's Apostle and asked about Al-Luqata (a fallen 
 thing). The Prophet said, "Recognize its container and its tying 
 material and then make a public announcement about it for one year and
 if its owner shows up, give it to him; otherwise use it as you like." 
 The man said, "What about a lost sheep?" The Prophet said, "It is for 
 you, your brother or the wolf." The man said "What about a lost 
 camel?" The Prophet said, "Why should you take it as it has got its 
 water-container (its stomach) and its hooves and it can reach the 
 places of water and can eat the trees till its owner finds it?"
