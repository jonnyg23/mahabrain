 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:377</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Urwa:</i></p>
 Aisha said, "Buraira came to me and said, 'I have agreed with my 
 masters to pay them nine Uqiyas (of gold) (in installments) one Uqiya 
 per year; please help me.' I said, 'I am ready to pay the whole amount
 now provided your masters agree that your Wala will be for me.' So, 
 Buraira went to her masters and told them about that offer but they 
 refused to accept it. She returned, and at that time, Allah's Apostle 
 was sitting (present). Buraira said, 'I told them of the offer but 
 they did not accept it and insisted on having the Wala.'.' The Prophet
 heard that." 'Aisha narrated the whole story to the Prophet . He said 
 to her, "Buy her and stipulate that her Wala' would be yours as the 
 Wala' is for the manumitted." 'Aisha did so. Then Allah's Apostle 
 stood up in front of the people, and after glorifying Allah he said, 
 "Amma Badu (i.e. then after)! What about the people who impose 
 conditions which are not in Allah's Book (Laws)? Any condition that is
 not in Allah's Book (Laws) is invalid even if they were one hundred 
 conditions, for Allah's decisions are the right ones and His 
 conditions are the strong ones (firmer) and the Wala' will be for the 
 manumitted."
