 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:331</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</i></p>
 While the Prophet was in the market, somebody, called, "O 
 Abu-l-Qasim." The Prophet turned to him. The man said, "I have called 
 to this (i.e. another man)." The Prophet said, "Name yourselves by my 
 name but not by my Kuniya (name)."  (In Arabic world it is the custom 
 to call the man as the father of his eldest son, e.g. Abu-l-Qasim.)
