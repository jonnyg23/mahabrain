 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:58</h3><p><i>Narrated Said bin Abu Said Al-Maqburi:</i></p>
 Abu Shuraih, Al-'Adawi said that he had said to 'Amr bin Sa'id when he
 was sending the troops to Mecca (to fight 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair), "O
 Chief! Allow me to tell you what Allah's Apostle said on the day 
 following the Conquest of Mecca. My ears heard that and my heart 
 understood it thoroughly and I saw with my own eyes the Prophet when 
 he, after Glorifying and Praising Allah, started saying, 'Allah, not 
 the people, made Mecca a sanctuary, so anybody who has belief in Allah
 and the Last Day should neither shed blood in it, nor should he cut 
 down its trees. If anybody tells (argues) that fighting in it is 
 permissible on the basis that Allah's Apostle did fight in Mecca, say 
 to him, 'Allah allowed His Apostle and did not allow you.' "Allah 
 allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and 
 today its sanctity is valid as it was before. So, those who are 
 present should inform those who are absent (concerning this fact." Abu
 Shuraih was asked, "What did 'Amr reply?" He said, ('Amr said) 'O Abu 
 Shuraih! I know better than you in this respect Mecca does not give 
 protection to a sinner, a murderer or a thief."
