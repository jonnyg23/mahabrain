 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:834</h3><p><i>Narrated Abdullah:</i></p>
 Allah's Apostle said, "If somebody takes a false oath in order to get 
 the property of a Muslim (unjustly) by that oath, then Allah will be 
 angry with him when he will meet Him." Al-Ash'ath informed me, "By 
 Allah! This was said regarding me. There was a dispute about a piece 
 of land between me and a man from the Jews who denied my right. I took
 him to the Prophet. Allah's Apostle asked me, 'Do you have an 
 evidence?' I replied in the negative. He said to the Jew, 'Take an 
 oath.' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! He will surely take an oath and 
 take my property unjustly." So, Allah revealed: "Verily! Those who 
 purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their oaths
 . . . "  (3.77)
