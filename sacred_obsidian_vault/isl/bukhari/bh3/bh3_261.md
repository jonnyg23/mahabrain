 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:264</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibrahim bin Sad from his father from his grand-father:</i></p>
 Abdur Rahman bin Auf said, "When we came to Medina as emigrants, 
 Allah's Apostle established a bond of brotherhood between me and Sad 
 bin Ar-Rabi'. Sad bin Ar-Rabi' said (to me), 'I am the richest among 
 the Ansar, so I will give you half of my wealth and you may look at my
 two wives and whichever of the two you may choose I will divorce her, 
 and when she has completed the prescribed period (before marriage) you
 may marry her.' Abdur-Rahman replied, "I am not in need of all that. 
 Is there any market-place where trade is practiced?' He replied, "The 
 market of Qainuqa." Abdur-Rahman went to that market the following day
 and brought some dried butter-milk (yogurt) and butter, and then he 
 continued going there regularly. Few days later, 'AbdurRahman came 
 having traces of yellow (scent) on his body. Allah's Apostle asked him
 whether he had got married. He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet
 said, 'Whom have you married?' He replied, 'A woman from the Ansar.' 
 Then the Prophet asked, 'How much did you pay her?' He replied, '(I 
 gave her) a gold piece equal in weigh to a date stone (or a date stone
 of gold)! The Prophet said, 'Give a Walima (wedding banquet) even if 
 with one sheep .' "
