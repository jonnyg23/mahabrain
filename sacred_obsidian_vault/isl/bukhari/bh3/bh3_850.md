 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:851</h3><p><i>Narrated An-Nu'man bin Bashir:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "The example of the person abiding by Allah's orders
 and limits (or the one who abides by the limits and regulations 
 prescribed by Allah) in comparison to the one who do wrong and violate
 Allah's limits and orders is like the example of people drawing lots 
 for seats in a boat. Some of them got seats in the upper part while 
 the others in the lower part ; those in the, lower part have to pass 
 by those in the upper one to get water, and that troubled the latter. 
 One of them (i.e. the people in the lower part) took an axe and 
 started making a hole in the bottom of the boat. The people of the 
 upper part came and asked him, (saying), 'What is wrong with you?' He 
 replied, "You have been troubled much by my (coming up to you), and I 
 have to get water.' Now if they prevent him from doing that they will 
 save him and themselves, but if they leave him (to do what he wants), 
 they will destroy him and themselves."
