 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:607</h3><p><i>Narrated Khabbab:</i></p>
 I was a blacksmith In the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance, and 'Asi 
 bin Wail owed me some money. I went to him to demand it, but he said 
 to me, "I will not pay you unless you reject faith in Muhammad." I 
 replied, "By Allah, I will never disbelieve Muhammad till Allah let 
 you die and then resurrect you." He said, "Then wait till I die and 
 come to life again, for then I will be given property and offspring 
 and will pay your right." So, thus revelation came: "Have you seen him
 who disbelieved in Our signs and yet says, 'I will be given property 
 and offspring?' "  (19.77)
