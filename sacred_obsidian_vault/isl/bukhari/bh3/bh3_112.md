 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:115</h3><p><i>Narrated Talha bin 'Ubaid-Ullah:</i></p>
 A bedouin with unkempt hair came to Allah's Apostle and said, "O 
 Allah's Apostle! Inform me what Allah has made compulsory for me as 
 regards the prayers." He replied: "You have to offer perfectly the 
 five compulsory prayers in a day and night (24 hours), unless you want
 to pray Nawafil." The bedouin further asked, "Inform me what Allah has
 made compulsory for me as regards fasting." He replied, "You have to 
 fast during the whole month of Ramadan, unless you want to fast more 
 as Nawafil." The bedouin further asked, "Tell me how much Zakat Allah 
 has enjoined on me." Thus, Allah's Apostle informed him about all the 
 rules (i.e. fundamentals) of Islam. The bedouin then said, "By Him Who
 has honored you, I will neither perform any Nawafil nor will I 
 decrease what Allah has enjoined on me. Allah's Apostle said, "If he 
 is saying the truth, he will succeed (or he will be granted 
 Paradise)."
