 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:520</h3><p><i>Narrated Rafi' bin Khadij:</i></p>
 We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We used to rent 
 the land at the yield of specific delimited portion of it to be given 
 to the landlord. Sometimes the vegetation of that portion was affected
 by blights etc., while the rest remained safe and vice versa, so the 
 Prophet forbade this practice. At that time gold or silver were not 
 used (for renting the land). If they provided the seeds, they would 
 get so-and-so much. Al-Hasan said, "There is no harm if the land 
 belongs to one but both spend on it and the yield is divided between 
 them." Az-Zuhri had the same opinion. Al-Hasan said, "There is no harm
 if cotton is picked on the condition of having half the yield." 
 Ibrahim, Ibn Siain, 'Ata', Al-Hakam, Az-Zuhri and Qatada said, "There 
 is no harm in giving the yarn to the weaver to weave into cloth on the
 basis that one-third or one-fourth (or any other portion) of the cloth
 is given to the weaver for his labor." Ma'am said, "There is no harm 
 in hiring animals for a definite (fixed) period on the basis that 
 one-third or one-fourth of the products carried by the animals is 
 given to the owner of the animals."
