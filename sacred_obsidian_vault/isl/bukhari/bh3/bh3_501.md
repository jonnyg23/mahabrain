 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:503</h3><p><i>Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:</i></p>
 When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin after embracing Islam, came
 to Allah's Apostle, he got up. They appealed to him to return their 
 properties and their captives. Allah's Apostle said to them, "The most
 beloved statement to me is the true one. So, you have the option of 
 restoring your properties or your captives, for I have delayed 
 distributing them." The narrator added, Allah's Apostle c had been 
 waiting for them for more than ten days on his return from Taif. When 
 they realized that Allah's Apostle would return to them only one of 
 two things, they said, "We choose our captives." So, Allah's Apostle 
 got up in the gathering of the Muslims, praised Allah as He deserved, 
 and said, "Then after! These brethren of yours have come to you with 
 repentance and I see it proper to return their captives to them. So, 
 whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, 
 and whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from 
 the very first booty which Allah will give us then he can do so." The 
 people replied, "We agree to give up our shares willingly as a favor 
 for Allah's Apostle." Then Allah's Apostle said, "We don't know who 
 amongst you has agreed and who hasn't. Go back and your chiefs may 
 tell us your opinion." So, all of them returned and their chiefs 
 discussed the matter with them and then they (i.e. their chiefs) came 
 to Allah's Apostle to tell him that they (i.e. the people) had given 
 up their shares gladly and willingly.
