 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:866</h3><p><i>Narrated Anas:</i></p>
 Ar-Rabi, the daughter of An-Nadr broke the tooth of a girl, and the 
 relatives of Ar-Rabi' requested the girl's relatives to accept the 
 Irsh (compensation for wounds etc.) and forgive (the offender), but 
 they refused. So, they went to the Prophet who ordered them to bring 
 about retaliation. Anas bin An-Nadr asked, "O Allah"; Apostle! Will 
 the tooth of Ar-Rabi' be broken? No, by Him Who has sent you with the 
 Truth, her tooth will not be broken." The Prophet said, "O Anas! 
 Allah"; law ordains retaliation." Later the relatives of the girl 
 agreed and forgave her. The Prophet said, "There are some of Allah's 
 slaves who, if they take an oath by Allah, are responded to by Allah 
 i.e. their oath is fulfilled). Anas added, "The people agreed and 
 accepted the Irsh."
