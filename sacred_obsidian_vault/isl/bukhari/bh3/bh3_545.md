 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:546</h3><p><i>Narrated 'Abdullah (bin Mas'ud):</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "Whoever takes a false oath to deprive somebody of 
 his property will meet Allah while He will be angry with him." Allah 
 revealed: 'Verily those who purchase a little gain at the cost of 
 Allah's covenant, and their oaths.' ........(3.77)
 <p>
 Al-Ash'ath came (to the place where 'Abdullah was narrating) and said,
 "What has Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (i.e. Abdullah) been telling you? This 
 verse was revealed concerning me. I had a well in the land of a cousin
 of mine. The Prophet asked me to bring witnesses (to confirm my 
 claim). I said, 'I don't have witnesses.' He said, 'Let the defendant 
 take an oath then.' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! He will take a (false)
 oath immediately.' Then the Prophet mentioned the above narration and 
 Allah revealed the verse to confirm what he had said." (See 
 Hadith No. 692)
