 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:863</h3><p><i>Narrated Al-Bara:</i></p>
 When the Prophet intended to perform 'Umra in the month of Dhul-Qada, 
 the people of Mecca did not let him enter Mecca till he settled the 
 matter with them by promising to stay in it for three days only. When 
 the document of treaty was written, the following was mentioned: 
 'These are the terms on which Muhammad, Allah's Apostle agreed (to 
 make peace).' They said, "We will not agree to this, for if we 
 believed that you are Allah's Apostle we would not prevent you, but 
 you are Muhammad bin 'Abdullah." The Prophet said, "I am Allah's 
 Apostle and also Muhammad bin 'Abdullah." Then he said to 'Ali, "Rub 
 off (the words) 'Allah's Apostle' ", but 'Ali said, "No, by Allah, I 
 will never rub off your name." So, Allah's Apostle took the document 
 and wrote, 'This is what Muhammad bin 'Abdullah has agreed upon: No 
 arms will be brought into Mecca except in their cases, and nobody from
 the people of Mecca will be allowed to go with him (i.e. the Prophet )
 even if he wished to follow him and he (the Prophet ) will not prevent
 any of his companions from staying in Mecca if the latter wants to 
 stay.' When the Prophet entered Mecca and the time limit passed, the 
 Meccans went to 'Ali and said, "Tell your Friend (i.e. the Prophet ) 
 to go out, as the period (agreed to) has passed." So, the Prophet went
 out of Mecca. The daughter of Hamza ran after them (i.e. the Prophet 
 and his companions), calling, "O Uncle! O Uncle!" 'Ali received her 
 and led her by the hand and said to Fatima, "Take your uncle's 
 daughter." Zaid and Ja'far quarrel ed about her. 'Ali said, "I have 
 more right to her as she is my uncle's daughter." Ja'far said, "She is
 my uncle's daughter, and her aunt is my wife." Zaid said, "She is my 
 brother's daughter." The Prophet judged that she should be given to 
 her aunt, and said that the aunt was like the mother. He then said to 
 'All, "You are from me and I am from you", and said to Ja'far, "You 
 resemble me both in character and appearance", and said to Zaid, "You 
 are our brother (in faith) and our freed slave."
