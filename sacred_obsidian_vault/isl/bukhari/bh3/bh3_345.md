 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:348</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 Rarely did the Prophet fail to visit Abu Bakr's house everyday, either
 in the morning or in the evening. When the permission for migration to
 Medina was granted, all of a sudden the Prophet came to us at noon and
 Abu Bakr was informed, who said, "Certainly the Prophet has come for 
 some urgent matter." The Prophet said to Abu Bark, when the latter 
 entered "Let nobody stay in your home." Abu Bakr said, "O Allah's 
 Apostle! There are only my two daughters (namely 'Aisha and Asma') 
 present." The Prophet said, "I feel (am informed) that I have been 
 granted the permission for migration." Abu Bakr said, "I will 
 accompany you, O Allah's Apostle!" The Prophet said, "You will 
 accompany me." Abu Bakr then said "O Allah's Apostle! I have two 
 she-camels I have prepared specially for migration, so I offer you one
 of them. The Prophet said, "I have accepted it on the condition that I
 will pay its price."
