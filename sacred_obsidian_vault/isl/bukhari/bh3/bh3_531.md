 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:532</h3><p><i>Narrated Rafi bin Khadij:</i></p>
 My uncle Zuhair said, "Allah's Apostle forbade us to do a thing which 
 was a source of help to us." I said, "Whatever Allah's Apostle said 
 was right." He said, "Allah's Apostle sent for me and asked, 'What are
 you doing with your farms?' I replied, 'We give our farms on rent on 
 the basis that we get the yield produced at the banks of the water 
 streams (rivers) for the rent, or rent it for some Wasqs of barley and
 dates.' Allah's Apostle said, 'Do not do so, but cultivate (the land) 
 yourselves or let it be cultivated by others gratis, or keep it 
 uncultivated.' I said, 'We hear and obey.'
