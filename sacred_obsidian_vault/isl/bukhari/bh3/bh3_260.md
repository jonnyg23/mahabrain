 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:263</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 You people say that Abu Huraira tells many narrations from Allah's 
 Apostle and you also wonder why the emigrants and Ansar do not narrate
 from Allah's Apostle as Abu Huraira does. My emigrant brothers were 
 busy in the market while I used to stick to Allah's Apostle content 
 with what fills my stomach; so I used to be present when they were 
 absent and I used to remember when they used to forget, and my Ansari 
 brothers used to be busy with their properties and I was one of the 
 poor men of Suffa. I used to remember the narrations when they used to
 forget. No doubt, Allah's Apostle once said, "Whoever spreads his 
 garment till I have finished my present speech and then gathers it to 
 himself, will remember whatever I will say." So, I spread my colored 
 garment which I was wearing till Allah's Apostle had finished his 
 saying, and then I gathered it to my chest. So, I did not forget any 
 of that narrations.
