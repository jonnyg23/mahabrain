 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:890</h3><p><i>Narrated Ibn Umar:</i></p>
 When the people of Khaibar dislocated Abdullah bin Umar's hands and 
 feet, Umar got up delivering a sermon saying, "No doubt, Allah's 
 Apostle made a contract with the Jews concerning their properties, and
 said to them, 'We allow you (to stand in your land) as long as Allah 
 allows you.' Now Abdullah bin Umar went to his land and was attacked 
 at night, and his hands and feet were dislocated, and as we have no 
 enemies there except those Jews, they are our enemies and the only 
 people whom we suspect, I have made up my mind to exile them." When 
 Umar decided to carry out his decision, a son of Abu Al-Haqiq's came 
 and addressed 'Umar, "O chief of the believers, will you exile us 
 although Muhammad allowed us to stay at our places, and made a 
 contract with us about our properties, and accepted the condition of 
 our residence in our land?" 'Umar said, "Do you think that I have 
 forgotten the statement of Allah's Apostle, i.e.: What will your 
 condition be when you are expelled from Khaibar and your camel will be
 carrying you night after night?" The Jew replied, "That was joke from 
 Abu-l-Qasim." 'Umar said, "O the enemy of Allah! You are telling a 
 lie." 'Umar then drove them out and paid them the price of their 
 properties in the form of fruits, money, camel saddles and ropes, 
 etc."
