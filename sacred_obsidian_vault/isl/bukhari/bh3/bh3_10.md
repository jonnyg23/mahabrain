 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:11</h3><p><i>Narrated Aisha:</i></p>
 We set out along with Allah's Apostle shortly before the appearance of
 the new moon (crescent) of the month of Dhi-l-Hijja and he said to us,
 "Whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so; and whoever wants 
 to assume Ihram for 'Umra may do so. Hadn't I brought the Hadi (animal
 for sacrificing) (with me), I would have assumed Ihram for 'Umra." 
 ('Aisha added,): So some of us assumed Ihram for 'Umra while the 
 others for Hajj. I was amongst those who assumed Ihram for 'Umra. The 
 day of 'Arafat approached and I was still menstruating. I complained 
 to the Prophet (about that) and he said, "Abandon your 'Umra, undo and
 comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj;." When it was the night of 
 Hasba, he sent 'Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tan'im and I assumed Ihram 
 for 'Umra (and performed it) in lieu of my missed 'Umra.
