 <h3 align="CENTER">Hadith 3:517</h3><p><i>Narrated Abu Huraira:</i></p>
 The Prophet said, "While a man was riding a cow, it turned towards him
 and said, 'I have not been created for this purpose (i.e. carrying), I
 have been created for sloughing." The Prophet added, "I, Abu Bakr and 
 'Umar believe in the story." The Prophet went on, "A wolf caught a 
 sheep, and when the shepherd chased it, the wolf said, 'Who will be 
 its guard on the day of wild beasts, when there will be no shepherd 
 for it except me?' "After narrating it, the Prophet said, "I, Abu Bakr
 and 'Umar too believe it." Abu Salama (a sub-narrator) said, "Abu Bakr
 and 'Umar were not present then." (It has been written that a wolf 
 also spoke to one of the companions of the Prophet near Medina as 
 narrated in Fatah-al-Bari:
 <p>
 Suddenly a wolf caught a sheep and I shouted at it. The wolf sat on 
 its tail and addressed me, saying, 'Who will look after it (i.e. the 
 sheep) when you will be busy and not able to look after it? Do you 
 forbid me the provision which Allah has provided me?' " Ahban added, 
 "I clapped my hands and said, 'By Allah, I have never seen anything 
 more curious and wonderful than this!' On that the wolf said, 'There 
 is something (more curious) and wonderful than this; that is, Allah's 
 Apostle in those palm trees, inviting people to Allah (i.e. Islam).' 
 "Unais bin 'Amr further said, "Then Ahban went to Allah's Apostle and 
 informed him what happened and embraced Islam.)" palm trees or other 
 trees and share the fruits with me."
