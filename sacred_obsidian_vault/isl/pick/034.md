 <h1 align="CENTER">34. Saba': Sheba</h1>
 <a name="an_034_001">1</a> Praise be to Allah, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and  whatsoever is in the earth. His is the praise in the Hereafter, and He is the Wise, the  Aware. 
 <a name="an_034_002">2</a> He knoweth that which goeth into the earth and that which cometh forth from  it, and that descendeth from the heaven and that which ascendeth into it. He is the  Merciful, the Forgiving. 
 <a name="an_034_003">3</a> Those who disbelieve say: The Hour will never come unto us. Say: Nay, by  my Lord, but it is coming unto you surely. (He is) the Knower of the Unseen. Not an  atom's weight, or less than that or greater, escapeth Him in the heavens or in the earth,  but it is in a clear Record, 
 <a name="an_034_004">4</a> That He may reward those who believe and do good works. For them is  pardon and a rich provision. 
 <a name="an_034_005">5</a> But those who strive against Our revelations, challenging (Us), theirs will be  a painful doom of wrath. 
 <a name="an_034_006">6</a> Those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed unto thee  from thy Lord is the truth and leadeth unto the path of the Mighty, the Owner of  Praise. 
 <a name="an_034_007">7</a> Those who disbelieve say: Shall we show you a man who will tell you (that)  when ye have become dispersed in dust with most complete dispersal still, even then,  ye will be created anew ? 
 <a name="an_034_008">8</a> Hath he invented a lie concerning Allah, or is there in him a madness ? Nay,  but those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are in torment and far error. 
 <a name="an_034_009">9</a> Have they not observed what is before them and what is behind them of the  sky and the earth ? If We will, We can make the earth swallow them, or cause  obliteration from the sky to fall on them.  Lo! herein surely is a portent for every  slave who turneth (to Allah) repentant. 
 <a name="an_034_010">10</a> And assuredly We gave David grace from Us, (saying): O ye hills and birds,  echo his psalms of praise! And We made the iron supple unto him, 
 <a name="an_034_011">11</a> Saying: Make thou long coats of mail and measure the links (thereof). And  do ye right. Lo! I am Seer of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_034_012">12</a> And unto Solomon (We gave) the wind, whereof the morning course was a  month's journey and the evening course a month's journey, and We caused the fount  of copper to gush forth for him, and (We gave him) certain of the jinn who worked  before him by permission of his Lord. And such of them as deviated from Our  command, them We caused to taste the punishment of flaming Fire. 
 <a name="an_034_013">13</a> They made for him what he willed: synagogues and statues, basins like wells  and boilers built into the ground. Give thanks, O House of David! Few of My  bondmen are thankful. 
 <a name="an_034_014">14</a> And when We decreed death for him, nothing showed his death to them save  a creeping creature of the earth which gnawed away his staff. And when he fell the  jinn saw clearly how, if they had known the Unseen, they would not have continued  in despised toil. 
 <a name="an_034_015">15</a> There was indeed a sign for Sheba in their dwelling-place: Two gardens on  the right hand and the left (as who should say): Eat of the provision of your Lord and  render thanks to Him. A fair land and an indulgent Lord! 
 <a name="an_034_016">16</a> But they were froward, so We sent on them the flood of 'Iram, and in  exchange for their two gardens gave them two gardens bearing bitter fruit, the  tamarisk and here and there a lote-tree. 
 <a name="an_034_017">17</a> This We awarded them because of their ingratitude. Punish We ever any save  the ingrates ? 
 <a name="an_034_018">18</a> And We set, between them and the towns which We had blessed, towns easy  to be seen, and We made the stage between them easy, (saying): Travel in them safely  both by night and day. 
 <a name="an_034_019">19</a> But they said: Our Lord! Make the stage between our journeys longer. And  they wronged themselves, therefore We made them bywords (in the land) and  scattered them abroad, a total scattering. Lo! herein verily are portents for each  steadfast, grateful (heart). 
 <a name="an_034_020">20</a> And Satan indeed found his calculation true concerning them, for they follow  him, all save a group of true believers. 
 <a name="an_034_021">21</a> And he had no warrant whatsoever against them, save that We would know  him who believeth in the Hereafter from him who is in doubt thereof; and thy Lord (O  Muhammad) taketh note of all things. 
 <a name="an_034_022">22</a> Say (O Muhammad): Call upon those whom ye set up beside Allah! They  possess not an atom's weight either in the heavens or in the earth, nor have they any  share in either, nor hath He an auxiliary among them. 
 <a name="an_034_023">23</a> No intercession availeth with Him save for him whom He permitteth. Yet,  when fear is banished from their hearts, they say: What was it that your Lord said ?  They say: The Truth. And He is the Sublime, the Great. 
 <a name="an_034_024">24</a> Say: Who giveth you provision from the sky and the earth ? Say: Allah, Lo!  we or you assuredly are rightly guided or in error manifest. 
 <a name="an_034_025">25</a> Say: Ye will not be asked of what we committed, nor shall we be asked of  what ye do. 
 <a name="an_034_026">26</a> Say: Our Lord will bring us all together, then He will judge between us with  truth. He is the All-knowing Judge. 
 <a name="an_034_027">27</a> Say: Show me those whom ye have joined unto Him as partners. Nay (ye  dare not)! For He is Allah, the Mighty, the Wise. 
 <a name="an_034_028">28</a> And We have not sent thee (O Muhammad) save as a bringer of good tidings  and a warner unto all mankind; but most of mankind know not. 
 <a name="an_034_029">29</a> And they say: When is this promise (to be fulfilled) if ye are truthful ? 
 <a name="an_034_030">30</a> Say (O Muhammad): Yours is the promise of a Day which ye cannot  postpone nor hasten by an hour. 
 <a name="an_034_031">31</a> And those who disbelieve say: We believe not in this Qur'an nor in that  which was before it; but oh, if thou couldst see, when the wrong-doers are brought up  before their Lord, how they cast the blame one to another; how those who were  despised (in the earth) say unto those who were proud: But for you, we should have  been believers. 
 <a name="an_034_032">32</a> Those who were proud say unto those who were despised: Did we drive you  away from the guidance after it had come unto you ? Nay, but ye were guilty. 
 <a name="an_034_033">33</a> Those who were despised say unto those who were proud: Nay but (it was  your) scheming night and day, when ye commanded us to disbelieve in Allah and set  up rivals unto Him. And they are filled with remorse when they behold the doom; and  We place carcans on the necks of those who disbelieved. Are they requited aught save  what they used to do ? 
 <a name="an_034_034">34</a> And We sent not unto any township a warner, but its pampered ones  declared: Lo! we are disbelievers in that wherewith ye have been sent. 
 <a name="an_034_035">35</a> And they say: We are more (than you) in wealth and children. We are not the  punished! 
 <a name="an_034_036">36</a> Say (O Muhammad): Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will  and narroweth it (for whom He will). But most of mankind know not. 
 <a name="an_034_037">37</a> And it is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you near unto Us,  but he who believeth and doeth good (he draweth near). As for such, theirs will be  twofold reward for what they did and they will dwell secure in lofty halls. 
 <a name="an_034_038">38</a> And as for those who strive against Our revelations, challenging, they will be  brought to the doom. 
 <a name="an_034_039">39</a> Say: Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His bondmen,  and narroweth (it) for him. And whatsoever ye spend (for good) He replaceth it. And  He is the Best of Providers. 
 <a name="an_034_040">40</a> And on the day when He will gather them all together, He will say unto the  angels: Did these worship you ? 
 <a name="an_034_041">41</a> They will say: Be Thou Glorified. Thou (alone) art our Guardian, not them!  Nay, but they worshipped the jinn; most of them were believers in them. 
 <a name="an_034_042">42</a> That day ye will possess no use nor hurt one for another. And We shall say  unto those who did wrong: Taste the doom of the Fire which ye used to deny. 
 <a name="an_034_043">43</a> And if Our revelations are recited unto them in plain terms, they say: This is  naught else than a man who would turn you away from what your fathers used to  worship; and they say: This is naught else than an invented lie. Those who disbelieve  say of the truth when it reacheth them: This is naught else than mere magic. 
 <a name="an_034_044">44</a> And We have given them no scriptures which they study, nor sent We unto  them, before thee, any warner. 
 <a name="an_034_045">45</a> Those before them denied, and these have not attained a tithe of that which  We bestowed on them (of old); yet they denied My messengers. How intense then  was My abhorrence (of them)! 
 <a name="an_034_046">46</a> Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I exhort you unto one thing only: that ye  awake, for Allah's sake, by twos and singly, and then reflect: There is no madness in  your comrade. He is naught else than a warner unto you in face of a terrific doom. 
 <a name="an_034_047">47</a> Say: Whatever reward I might have asked of you is yours. My reward is the  affair of Allah only. He is Witness over all things. 
 <a name="an_034_048">48</a> Say: Lo! my Lord hurleth the truth. (He is) the Knower of Things Hidden. 
 <a name="an_034_049">49</a> Say: The Truth hath come, and falsehood showeth not its face and will not  return. 
 <a name="an_034_050">50</a> Say: If I err, I err only to my own loss, and if I am rightly guided it is  because of that which my Lord hath revealed unto me. Lo! He is Hearer, Nigh. 
 <a name="an_034_051">51</a> Couldst thou but see when they are terrified with no escape, and are seized  from near at hand, 
 <a name="an_034_052">52</a> And say: We (now) believe therein. But how can they reach (faith) from afar  off, 
 <a name="an_034_053">53</a> When they disbelieved in it of yore. They aim at the unseen from afar off. 
 <a name="an_034_054">54</a> And a gulf is set between them and that which they desire, as was done for  people of their kind of old. Lo! they were in hopeless doubt.
