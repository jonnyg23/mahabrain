 <h1 align="CENTER">3. Al-Imran: The Family Of Imran</h1>
 <a name="an_003_001">1</a> Alim. Lam. Mim. 
 <a name="an_003_002">2</a> Allah! There is no God save Him, the Alive, the Eternal. 
 <a name="an_003_003">3</a> He hath revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture with truth, confirming  that which was (revealed) before it, even as He revealed the Torah and the Gospel. 
 <a name="an_003_004">4</a> Aforetime, for a guidance to mankind; and hath revealed the Criterion (of  right and wrong). Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah, theirs will be a  heavy doom. Allah is Mighty, Able to Requite (the wrong). 
 <a name="an_003_005">5</a> Lo! nothing in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah. 
 <a name="an_003_006">6</a> He it is Who fashioneth you in the wombs as pleaseth Him. There is no God  save Him, the Almighty, the Wise. 
 <a name="an_003_007">7</a> He it is Who hath revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture wherein are  clear revelations - they are the substance of the Book - and others (which are)  allegorical. But those in whose hearts is doubt pursue, forsooth, that which is  allegorical seeking (to cause) dissension by seeking to explain it. None knoweth its  explanation save Allah. And those who are of sound instruction say: We believe  therein; the whole is from our Lord; but only men of understanding really heed. 
 <a name="an_003_008">8</a> Our Lord! Cause not our hearts to stray after Thou hast guided us, and  bestow upon us mercy from Thy Presence. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Bestower. 
 <a name="an_003_009">9</a> Our Lord! Lo! it is Thou Who gatherest mankind together to a Day of which  there is no doubt. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst. 
 <a name="an_003_010">10</a> (On that Day) neither the riches nor the progeny of those who disbelieve will  aught avail them with Allah. They will be fuel for Fire. 
 <a name="an_003_011">11</a> Like Pharaoh's folk and those who were before them, they disbelieved Our  revelations and so Allah seized them for their sins. And Allah is severe in  punishment. 
 <a name="an_003_012">12</a> Say (O Muhammad) unto those who disbelieve: Ye shall be overcome and  gathered unto Hell, an evil resting-place. 
 <a name="an_003_013">13</a> There was a token for you in two hosts which met: one army fighting in the  way of Allah, and another disbelieving, whom they saw as twice their number,  clearly, with their very eyes. Thus Allah strengtheneth with His succour whom He  will. Lo! herein verily is a lesson for those who have eyes. 
 <a name="an_003_014">14</a> Beautified for mankind is love of the joys (that come) from women and  offspring; and stored-up heaps of gold and silver, and horses branded (with their  mark), and cattle and land. That is comfort of the life of the world. Allah! With Him  is a more excellent abode. 
 <a name="an_003_015">15</a> Say: Shall I inform you of something better than that ? For those who keep  from evil, with their Lord, are Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they  will abide, and pure companions, and contentment from Allah. Allah is Seer of His  bondmen, 
 <a name="an_003_016">16</a> Those who say: Our Lord! Lo! we believe. So forgive us our sins and guard  us from the punishment of Fire; 
 <a name="an_003_017">17</a> The steadfast, and the truthful, and the obedient, those who spend (and hoard  not), those who pray for pardon in the watches of the night. 
 <a name="an_003_018">18</a> Allah (Himself) is Witness that there is no God save Him. And the angels  and the men of learning (too are witness). Maintaining His creation in justice, there is  no God save Him the Almighty, the Wise. 
 <a name="an_003_019">19</a> Lo! religion with Allah (is) the Surrender (to His Will and Guidance). Those  who (formerly) received the Scripture differed only after knowledge came unto them,  through transgression among themselves. Whoso disbelieveth the revelations of Allah  (will find that) lo! Allah is swift at reckoning. 
 <a name="an_003_020">20</a> And if they argue with thee, (O Muhammad), say: I have surrendered my  purpose to Allah and (so have) those who follow me. And say unto those who have  received the Scripture and those who read not: Have ye (too) surrendered ? If they  surrender, then truly they are rightly guided, and if they turn away, then it is thy duty  only to convey the message (unto them). Allah is Seer of (His) bondmen. 
 <a name="an_003_021">21</a> Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah, and slay the prophets  wrongfully, and slay those of mankind who enjoin equity: promise them a painful  doom. 
 <a name="an_003_022">22</a> Those are they whose works have failed in the world and the Hereafter; and  they have no helpers. 
 <a name="an_003_023">23</a> Hast thou not seen how those who have received a portion of the Scripture  invoke the Scripture of Allah (in their disputes) that it may judge between them; then  a faction of them turn away, being opposed (to it) ? 
 <a name="an_003_024">24</a> That is because they say: The Fire will not touch us save for a certain number  of days. That which they used to invent hath deceived them regarding their religion. 
 <a name="an_003_025">25</a> How (will it be with them) when We have brought them all together to a Day  of which there is no doubt, when every soul will be paid in full what it hath earned,  and they will not be wronged. 
 <a name="an_003_026">26</a> Say: O Allah! Owner of Sovereignty! Thou givest sovereignty unto whom  Thou wilt, and Thou withdrawest sovereignty from whom Thou wilt. Thou exaltest  whom Thou wilt, and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt. In Thy hand is the good. Lo!  Thou art Able to do all things. 
 <a name="an_003_027">27</a> Thou causest the night to pass into the day, and Thou causest the day to pass  into the night. And Thou bringest forth the living from the dead, and Thou bringest  forth the dead from the living. And Thou givest sustenance to whom Thou choosest,  without stint. 
 <a name="an_003_028">28</a> Let not the believers take disbelievers for their friends in preference to  believers. Whoso doeth that hath no connection with Allah unless (it be) that ye but  guard yourselves against them, taking (as it were) security. Allah biddeth you beware  (only) of Himself. Unto Allah is the journeying. 
 <a name="an_003_029">29</a> Say, (O Muhammad): Whether ye hide that which is in your breasts or reveal  it, Allah knoweth it. He knoweth that which is in the heavens and that which is in the  earth, and Allah is Able to do all things. 
 <a name="an_003_030">30</a> On the Day when every soul will find itself confronted with all that it hath  done of good and all that it hath done of evil (every soul) will long that there might be  a mighty space of distance between it and that (evil). Allah biddeth you beware of  Him. And Allah is Full of Pity for (His) bondmen. 
 <a name="an_003_031">31</a> Say, (O Muhammad, to mankind): If ye love Allah, follow me; Allah will  love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
 <a name="an_003_032">32</a> Say: Obey Allah and the messenger. But if they turn away, lo! Allah loveth  not the disbelievers (in His guidance). 
 <a name="an_003_033">33</a> Lo! Allah preferred Adam and Noah and the Family of Abraham and the  Family of 'Imran above (all His) creatures. 
 <a name="an_003_034">34</a> They were descendants one of another. Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
 <a name="an_003_035">35</a> (Remember) when the wife of 'Imran said: My Lord! I have vowed unto  Thee that which is in my belly as a consecrated (offering). Accept it from me. Lo!  Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower! 
 <a name="an_003_036">36</a> And when she was delivered she said: My Lord! Lo! I am delivered of a  female - Allah knew best of what she was delivered - the male is not as the female;  and lo! I have named her Mary, and lo! I crave Thy protection for her and for her  offspring from Satan the outcast. 
 <a name="an_003_037">37</a> And her Lord accepted her with full acceptance and vouchsafed to her a  goodly growth; and made Zachariah her guardian. Whenever Zachariah went into the  sanctuary where she was, he found that she had food. He said: O Mary! Whence  cometh unto thee this (food) ? She answered: It is from Allah. Allah giveth without  stint to whom He will. 
 <a name="an_003_038">38</a> Then Zachariah prayed unto his Lord and said: My Lord! Bestow upon me of  Thy bounty goodly offspring. Lo! Thou art the Hearer of Prayer. 
 <a name="an_003_039">39</a> And the angels called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary: Allah  giveth thee glad tidings of (a son whose name is) John, (who cometh) to confirm a  word from Allah lordly, chaste, a prophet of the righteous. 
 <a name="an_003_040">40</a> He said: My Lord! How can I have a son when age hath overtaken me  already and my wife is barren ? (The angel) answered: So (it will be). Allah doeth  what He will. 
 <a name="an_003_041">41</a> He said: My Lord! Appoint a token for me. (The angel) said: The token unto  thee (shall be) that thou shalt not speak unto mankind three days except by signs.  Remember thy Lord much, and praise (Him) in the early hours of night and morning. 
 <a name="an_003_042">42</a> And when the angels said: O Mary! Lo! Allah hath chosen thee and made  thee pure, and hath preferred thee above (all) the women of creation. 
 <a name="an_003_043">43</a> O Mary! Be obedient to thy Lord, prostrate thyself and bow with those who  bow (in worship). 
 <a name="an_003_044">44</a> This is of the tidings of things hidden. We reveal it unto thee (Muhammad).  Thou wast not present with them when they threw their pens (to know) which of them  should be the guardian of Mary, nor wast thou present with them when they  quarrelled (thereupon). 
 <a name="an_003_045">45</a> (And remember) when the angels said: O Mary! Lo! Allah giveth thee glad  tidings of a word from him, whose name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary,  illustrious in the world and the Hereafter, and one of those brought near (unto Allah). 
 <a name="an_003_046">46</a> He will speak unto mankind in his cradle and in his manhood, and he is of  the righteous. 
 <a name="an_003_047">47</a> She said: My Lord! How can I have a child when no mortal hath touched me  ? He said: So (it will be). Allah createth what He will. If He decreeth a thing, He saith  unto it only: Be! and it is. 
 <a name="an_003_048">48</a> And He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, and the Torah and the  Gospel, 
 <a name="an_003_049">49</a> And will make him a messenger unto the Children of Israel, (saying): Lo! I  come unto you with a sign from your Lord. Lo! I fashion for you out of clay the  likeness of a bird, and I breathe into it and it is a bird, by Allah's leave. I heal him  who was born blind, and the leper, and I raise the dead, by Allah's leave. And I  announce unto you what ye eat and what ye store up in your houses. Lo! herein verily  is a portent for you, if ye are to be believers. 
 <a name="an_003_050">50</a> And (I come) confirming that which was before me of the Torah, and to  make lawful some of that which was forbidden unto you. I come unto you with a sign  from your Lord, so keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 
 <a name="an_003_051">51</a> Lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path. 
 <a name="an_003_052">52</a> But when Jesus became conscious of their disbelief, he cried: Who will be  my helpers in the cause of Allah ? The disciples said: We will be Allah's helpers. We  believe in Allah, and bear thou witness that we have surrendered (unto Him). 
 <a name="an_003_053">53</a> Our Lord! We believe in that which Thou hast revealed and we follow him  whom Thou hast sent. Enrol us among those who witness (to the truth). 
 <a name="an_003_054">54</a> And they (the disbelievers) schemed, and Allah schemed (against them): and  Allah is the best of schemers. 
 <a name="an_003_055">55</a> (And remember) when Allah said: O Jesus! Lo! I am gathering thee and  causing thee to ascend unto Me, and am cleansing thee of those who disbelieve and  am setting those who follow thee above those who disbelieve until the Day of  Resurrection. Then unto Me ye will (all) return, and I shall judge between you as to  that wherein ye used to differ. 
 <a name="an_003_056">56</a> As for those who disbelieve I shall chastise them with a heavy chastisement  in the world and the Hereafter; and they will have no helpers. 
 <a name="an_003_057">57</a> And as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their  wages in full. Allah loveth not wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_003_058">58</a> This (which) We recite unto thee is a revelation and a wise reminder. 
 <a name="an_003_059">59</a> Lo! the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of Adam. He created  him of dust, then He said unto him: Be! and he is. 
 <a name="an_003_060">60</a> (This is) the truth from thy Lord (O Muhammad), so be not thou of those  who waver. 
 <a name="an_003_061">61</a> And whoso disputeth with thee concerning him, after the knowledge which  hath come unto thee, say (unto him): Come! We will summon our sons and your sons,  and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, then we will pray  humbly (to our Lord) and (solemnly) invoke the curse of Allah upon those who lie. 
 <a name="an_003_062">62</a> Lo! This verily is the true narrative. There is no God save Allah, and lo!  Allah, He verily is, is the Mighty, the Wise. 
 <a name="an_003_063">63</a> And if they turn away, then lo! Allah is Aware of (who are) the corrupters. 
 <a name="an_003_064">64</a> Say: O People of the Scripture! Come to an agreement between us and you:  that we shall worship none but Allah, and that we shall ascribe no partner unto Him,  and that none of us shall take others for lords beside Allah. And if they turn away,  then say: Bear witness that we are they who have surrendered (unto Him). 
 <a name="an_003_065">65</a> O People of the Scripture! Why will ye argue about Abraham, when the  Torah and the Gospel were not revealed till after him ? Have ye then no sense ? 
 <a name="an_003_066">66</a> Lo! ye are those who argue about that whereof ye have some knowledge:  Why then argue ye concerning that whereof ye have no knowledge ? Allah knoweth.  Ye know not. 
 <a name="an_003_067">67</a> Abraham was not a Jew, nor yet a Christian; but he was an upright man who  had surrendered (to Allah), and he was not of the idolaters. 
 <a name="an_003_068">68</a> Lo! those of mankind who have the best claim to Abraham are those who  followed him, and this Prophet and those who believe (with him); and Allah is the  Protecting Guardian of the believers. 
 <a name="an_003_069">69</a> A party of the People of the Scripture long to make you go astray; and they  make none to go astray except themselves, but they perceive not. 
 <a name="an_003_070">70</a> O People of the Scripture! Why disbelieve ye in the revelations of Allah,  when ye (yourselves) bear witness (to their truth) ? 
 <a name="an_003_071">71</a> O People of the Scripture! Why confound ye truth with falsehood and  knowingly conceal the truth ? 
 <a name="an_003_072">72</a> And a party of the People of the Scripture say: Believe in that which hath  been revealed unto those who believe at the opening of the day, and disbelieve at the  end thereof, in order that they may return; 
 <a name="an_003_073">73</a> And believe not save in one who followeth your religion - Say (O  Muhammad): Lo! the guidance is Allah's Guidance - that anyone is given the like of  that which was given unto you or that they may argue with you in the presence of  their Lord. Say (O Muhammad): Lo! the bounty is in Allah's hand. He bestoweth it on  whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. 
 <a name="an_003_074">74</a> He selecteth for His mercy whom He will. Allah is of Infinite Bounty. 
 <a name="an_003_075">75</a> Among the People of the Scripture there is he who, if thou trust him with a  weight of treasure, will return it to thee. And among them there is he who, if thou  trust him with a piece of gold, will not return it to thee unless thou keep standing over  him. That is because they say: We have no duty to the Gentiles. They speak a lie  concerning Allah knowingly. 
 <a name="an_003_076">76</a> Nay, but (the chosen of Allah is) he who fulfilleth his pledge and wardeth off  (evil); for lo! Allah loveth those who ward off (evil). 
 <a name="an_003_077">77</a> Lo! those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their  oaths, they have no portion in the Hereafter. Allah will neither speak to them nor look  upon them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow. Theirs will be a  painful doom. 
 <a name="an_003_078">78</a> And lo! there is a party of them who distort the Scripture with their tongues,  that ye may think that what they say is from the Scripture, when it is not from the  Scripture. And they say: It is from Allah, when it is not from Allah; and they speak a  lie concerning Allah knowingly. 
 <a name="an_003_079">79</a> It is not (possible) for any human being unto whom Allah had given the  Scripture and wisdom and the prophethood that he should afterwards have said unto  mankind: Be slaves of me instead of Allah; but (what he said was): Be ye faithful  servants of the Lord by virtue of your constant teaching of the Scripture and of your  constant study thereof. 
 <a name="an_003_080">80</a> And he commanded you not that ye should take the angels and the prophets  for lords. Would he command you to disbelieve after ye had surrendered (to Allah) ? 
 <a name="an_003_081">81</a> When Allah made (His) covenant with the prophets, (He said): Behold that  which I have given you of the Scripture and knowledge. And afterward there will  come unto you a messenger, confirming that which ye possess. Ye shall believe in  him and ye shall help him. He said: Do ye agree, and will ye take up My burden  (which I lay upon you) in this (matter) ? They answered: We agree. He said: Then  bear ye witness. I will be a witness with you. 
 <a name="an_003_082">82</a> Then whosoever after this shall turn away: they will be miscreants. 
 <a name="an_003_083">83</a> Seek they other than the religion of Allah, when unto Him submitteth  whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and unto Him  they will be returned. 
 <a name="an_003_084">84</a> Say (O Muhammad): We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us  and that which was revealed unto Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the  tribes, and that which was vouchsafed unto Moses and Jesus and the prophets from  their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have  surrendered. 
 <a name="an_003_085">85</a> And whoso seeketh as religion other than the Surrender (to Allah) it will not  be accepted from him, and he will be a loser in the Hereafter. 
 <a name="an_003_086">86</a> How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and (after)  they bore witness that the messenger is true and after clear proofs (of Allah's  Sovereignty) had come unto them. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. 
 <a name="an_003_087">87</a> As for such, their guerdon is that on them rests the curse of Allah and of  angels and of men combined. 
 <a name="an_003_088">88</a> They will abide therein. Their doom will not be lightened, neither will they  be reprieved; 
 <a name="an_003_089">89</a> Save those who afterward repent and do right. Lo! Allah is Forgiving,  Merciful. 
 <a name="an_003_090">90</a> Lo! those who disbelieve after their (profession of) belief, and afterward  grow violent in disbelief: their repentance will not be accepted. And such are those  who are astray. 
 <a name="an_003_091">91</a> Lo! those who disbelieve, and die in disbelief, the (whole) earth full of gold  would not be accepted from such an one if it were offered as a ransom (for his soul).  Theirs will be a painful doom and they will have no helpers. 
 <a name="an_003_092">92</a> Ye will not attain unto piety until ye spend of that which ye love. And  whatsoever ye spend, Allah is Aware thereof. 
 <a name="an_003_093">93</a> All food was lawful unto the Children of Israel, save that which Israel  forbade himself, (in days) before the Torah was revealed. Say: Produce the Torah and  read it (unto us) if ye are truthful. 
 <a name="an_003_094">94</a> And whoever shall invent a falsehood after that concerning Allah, such will  be wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_003_095">95</a> Say: Allah speaketh truth. So follow the religion of Abraham, the upright. He  was not of the idolaters. 
 <a name="an_003_096">96</a> Lo! the first Sanctuary appointed for mankind was that at Mecca, a blessed  place, a guidance to the peoples; 
 <a name="an_003_097">97</a> Wherein are plain memorials (of Allah's guidance); the place where  Abraham stood up to pray; and whosoever entereth it is safe. And pilgrimage to the  House is a duty unto Allah for mankind, for him who can find a way thither. As for  him who disbelieveth, (let him know that) lo! Allah is Independent of (all) creatures. 
 <a name="an_003_098">98</a> Say: O People of the Scripture! Why disbelieve ye in the revelations of  Allah, when Allah (Himself) is Witness of what ye do ? 
 <a name="an_003_099">99</a> Say: O People of the Scripture! Why drive ye back believers from the way of  Allah, seeking to make it crooked, when ye are witnesses (to Allah's guidance) ?  Allah is not unaware of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_003_100">100</a> O ye who believe! If ye obey a party of those who have received the  Scripture they will make you disbelievers after your belief. 
 <a name="an_003_101">101</a> How can ye disbelieve, when it is ye unto whom Allah's revelations are  recited, and His messenger is in your midst ? He who holdeth fast to Allah, he indeed  is guided unto a right path. 
 <a name="an_003_102">102</a> O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah with right observance, and die  not save as those who have surrendered (unto Him) 
 <a name="an_003_103">103</a> And hold fast, all of you together, to the cable of Allah, and do not separate.  And remember Allah's favour unto you: How ye were enemies and He made  friendship between your hearts so that ye became as brothers by His grace; and (how)  ye were upon the brink of an abyss of fire, and He did save you from it. Thus Allah  maketh clear His revelations unto you, that haply ye may be guided, 
 <a name="an_003_104">104</a> And there may spring from you a nation who invite to goodness, and enjoin  right conduct and forbid indecency. Such are they who are successful. 
 <a name="an_003_105">105</a> And be ye not as those who separated and disputed after the clear proofs had  come unto them. For such there is an awful doom, 
 <a name="an_003_106">106</a> On the Day when (some) faces will be whitened and (some) faces will be  blackened; and as for those whose faces have been blackened, it will be said unto  them: Disbelieved ye after your (profession of) belief ? Then taste the punishment for  that ye disbelieved. 
 <a name="an_003_107">107</a> And as for those whose faces have been whitened, in the mercy of Allah they  dwell for ever. 
 <a name="an_003_108">108</a> These are revelations of Allah. We recite them unto thee in truth. Allah  willeth no injustice to (His) creatures. 
 <a name="an_003_109">109</a> Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the  earth; and unto Allah all things are returned. 
 <a name="an_003_110">110</a> Ye are the best community that hath been raised up for mankind. Ye enjoin  right conduct and forbid indecency; and ye believe in Allah. And if the People of the  Scripture had believed it had been better for them. Some of them are believers; but  most of them are evil-livers. 
 <a name="an_003_111">111</a> They will not harm you save a trifling hurt, and if they fight against you they  will turn and flee. And afterward they will not be helped. 
 <a name="an_003_112">112</a> Ignominy shall be their portion wheresoever they are found save (where they  grasp) a rope from Allah and a rope from men. They have incurred anger from their  Lord, and wretchedness is laid upon them. That is because they used to disbelieve the  revelations of Allah, and slew the prophets wrongfully. That is because they were  rebellious and used to transgress. 
 <a name="an_003_113">113</a> They are not all alike. Of the People of the Scripture there is a staunch  community who recite the revelations of Allah in the night season, falling prostrate  (before Him). 
 <a name="an_003_114">114</a> They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin right conduct and forbid  indecency, and vie one with another in good works. These are of the righteous. 
 <a name="an_003_115">115</a> And whatever good they do, they will not be denied the meed thereof. Allah  is Aware of those who ward off (evil). 
 <a name="an_003_116">116</a> Lo! the riches and the progeny of those who disbelieve will not avail them  aught against Allah; and such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide therein. 
 <a name="an_003_117">117</a> The likeness of that which they spend in this life of the world is as the  likeness of a biting, icy wind which smiteth the harvest of a people who have  wronged themselves, and devastateth it. Allah wronged them not, but they do wrong  themselves. 
 <a name="an_003_118">118</a> O ye who believe! Take not for intimates others than your own folk, who  would spare no pains to ruin you; they love to hamper you. Hatred is revealed by (the  utterance of) their mouths, but that which their breasts hide is greater. We have made  plain for you the revelations if ye will understand. 
 <a name="an_003_119">119</a> Lo! ye are those who love them though they love you not, and ye believe in  all the Scripture. When they fall in with you they say: We believe; but when they go  apart they bite their finger-tips at you, for rage. Say: Perish in your rage! Lo! Allah is  Aware of what is hidden in (your) breasts. 
 <a name="an_003_120">120</a> If a lucky chance befall you, it is evil unto them, and if disaster strike you  they rejoice thereat. But if ye persevere and keep from evil their guile will never harm  you. Lo! Allah is Surrounding what they do. 
 <a name="an_003_121">121</a> And when thou settedst forth at daybreak from thy housefolk to assign to the  believers their positions for the battle, Allah was Hearer, Knower. 
 <a name="an_003_122">122</a> When two parties of you almost fell away, and Allah was their Protecting  Friend. In Allah let believers put their trust. 
 <a name="an_003_123">123</a> Allah had already given you the victory at Badr, when ye were contemptible.  So observe your duty to Allah in order that ye may be thankful. 
 <a name="an_003_124">124</a> When thou didst say unto the believers: Is it not sufficient for you that your  Lord should support you with three thousand angels sent down (to your help) ? 
 <a name="an_003_125">125</a> Nay, but if ye persevere, and keep from evil, and (the enemy) attack you  suddenly, your Lord will help you with five thousand angels sweeping on. 
 <a name="an_003_126">126</a> Allah ordained this only as a message of good cheer for you, and that thereby  your hearts might be at rest - Victory cometh only from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise - 
 <a name="an_003_127">127</a> That He may cut off a part of those who disbelieve, or overwhelm them so  that they retire, frustrated. 
 <a name="an_003_128">128</a> It is no concern at all of thee (Muhammad) whether He relent toward them or  punish them; for they are evil-doers. 
 <a name="an_003_129">129</a> Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the  earth. He forgiveth whom He will, and punisheth whom He will. Allah is Forgiving,  Merciful. 
 <a name="an_003_130">130</a> O ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubling and quadrupling (the sum  lent). Observe your duty to Allah, that ye may be successful. 
 <a name="an_003_131">131</a> And ward off (from yourselves) the Fire prepared for disbelievers. 
 <a name="an_003_132">132</a> And obey Allah and the messenger, that ye may find mercy. 
 <a name="an_003_133">133</a> And vie one with another for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a paradise  as wide as are the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who ward off (evil); 
 <a name="an_003_134">134</a> Those who spend (of that which Allah hath given them) in ease and in  adversity, those who control their wrath and are forgiving toward mankind; Allah  loveth the good; 
 <a name="an_003_135">135</a> And those who, when they do an evil thing or wrong themselves, remember  Allah and implore forgiveness for their sins - Who forgiveth sins save Allah only ? -  and will not knowingly repeat (the wrong) they did. 
 <a name="an_003_136">136</a> The reward of such will be forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens  underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever - a bountiful reward  for workers! 
 <a name="an_003_137">137</a> Systems have passed away before you. Do but travel in the land and see the  nature of the consequence for those who did deny (the messengers). 
 <a name="an_003_138">138</a> This is a declaration for mankind, a guidance and an admonition unto those  who ward off (evil) 
 <a name="an_003_139">139</a> Faint not nor grieve, for ye will overcome them if ye are (indeed) believers. 
 <a name="an_003_140">140</a> If ye have received a blow, the (disbelieving) people have received a blow  the like thereof. These are (only) the vicissitudes which We cause to follow one  another for mankind, to the end that Allah may know those who believe and may  choose witnesses from among you; and Allah loveth not wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_003_141">141</a> And that Allah may prove those who believe, and may blight the  disbelievers. 
 <a name="an_003_142">142</a> Or deemed ye that ye would enter paradise while yet Allah knoweth not  those of you who really strive, nor knoweth those (of you) who are steadfast ? 
 <a name="an_003_143">143</a> And verily ye used to wish for death before ye met it (in the field). Now ye  have seen it with your eyes! 
 <a name="an_003_144">144</a> Muhammad is but a messenger, messengers (the like of whom) have passed  away before him. Will it be that, when he dieth or is slain, ye will turn back on your  heels ? He who turneth back on his heels doth no hurt to Allah, and Allah will reward  the thankful. 
 <a name="an_003_145">145</a> No soul can ever die except by Allah's leave and at a term appointed. Whoso  desireth the reward of the world, We bestow on him thereof; and whoso desireth the  reward of the Hereafter, We bestow on him thereof. We shall reward the thankful. 
 <a name="an_003_146">146</a> And with how many a prophet have there been a number of devoted men  who fought (beside him). They quailed not for aught that befell them in the way of  Allah, nor did they weaken, nor were they brought low. Allah loveth the steadfast. 
 <a name="an_003_147">147</a> Their cry was only that they said: Our Lord! forgive us for our sins and  wasted efforts, make our foothold sure, and give us victory over the disbelieving folk. 
 <a name="an_003_148">148</a> So Allah gave them the reward of the world and the good reward of the  Hereafter. Allah loveth those whose deeds are good. 
 <a name="an_003_149">149</a> O ye who believe! if ye obey those who disbelieve, they will make you turn  back on your heels, and ye turn back as losers. 
 <a name="an_003_150">150</a> But Allah is your Protector, and He is the Best of Helpers. 
 <a name="an_003_151">151</a> We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they  ascribe unto Allah partners, for which no warrant hath been revealed. Their habitation  is the Fire, and hapless the abode of the wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_003_152">152</a> Allah verily made good His promise unto you when ye routed them by His  leave, until (the moment) when your courage failed you, and ye disagreed about the  order and ye disobeyed, after He had shown you that for which ye long. Some of you  desired the world, and some of you desired the Hereafter. Therefore He made you flee  from them, that He might try you. Yet now He hath forgiven you. Allah is a Lord of  Kindness to believers. 
 <a name="an_003_153">153</a> When ye climbed (the hill) and paid no heed to anyone, while the messenger,  in your rear, was calling you (to fight). Therefor He rewarded you grief for (his) grief,  that (He might teach) you not to sorrow either for that which ye missed or for that  which befell you. Allah is Informed of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_003_154">154</a> Then, after grief, He sent down security for you. As slumber did it overcome  a party of you, while (the other) party, who were anxious on their own account,  thought wrongly of Allah, the thought of ignorance. They said: Have we any part in  the cause ? Say (O Muhammad): The cause belongeth wholly to Allah. They hide  within themselves (a thought) which they reveal not unto thee, saying: Had we had  any part in the cause we should not have been slain here. Say: Even though ye had  been in your houses, those appointed to be slain would have gone forth to the places  where they were to lie. (All this hath been) in order that Allah might try what is in  your breasts and prove what is in your hearts. Allah is Aware of what is hidden in the  breasts (of men). 
 <a name="an_003_155">155</a> Lo! those of you who turned back on the day when the two hosts met, Satan  alone it was who caused them to backslide, because of some of that which they have  earned. Now Allah hath forgiven them. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Clement. 
 <a name="an_003_156">156</a> O ye who believe! Be not as those who disbelieved and said of their brethren  who went abroad in the land or were fighting in the field: If they had been (here) with  us they would not have died or been killed: that Allah may make it anguish in their  hearts. Allah giveth life and causeth death; and Allah is Seer of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_003_157">157</a> And what though ye be slain in Allah's way or die therein ? Surely pardon  from Allah and mercy are better than all that they amass. 
 <a name="an_003_158">158</a> What though ye be slain or die, when unto Allah ye are gathered ? 
 <a name="an_003_159">159</a> It was by the mercy of Allah that thou wast lenient with them (O  Muhammad), for if thou hadst been stern and fierce of heart they would have  dispersed from round about thee. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and  consult with them upon the conduct of affairs. And when thou art resolved, then put  thy trust in Allah. Lo! Allah loveth those who put their trust (in Him). 
 <a name="an_003_160">160</a> If Allah is your helper none can overcome you, and if He withdraw His help  from you, who is there who can help you after Him ? In Allah let believers put their  trust. 
 <a name="an_003_161">161</a> It is not for any prophet to embezzle. Whoso embezzleth will bring what he  embezzled with him on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul will be paid in full  what it hath earned; and they will not be wronged. 
 <a name="an_003_162">162</a> Is one who followeth the pleasure of Allah as one who hath earned  condemnation from Allah, whose habitation is the Fire, a hapless journey's end ? 
 <a name="an_003_163">163</a> There are degrees (of grace and reprobation) with Allah, and Allah is Seer of  what they do. 
 <a name="an_003_164">164</a> Allah verily hath shown grace to the believers by sending unto them a  messenger of their own who reciteth unto them His revelations, and causeth them to  grow, and teacheth them the Scripture and wisdom; although before (he came to  them) they were in flagrant error. 
 <a name="an_003_165">165</a> And was it so, when a disaster smote you, though ye had smitten (them with  a disaster) twice (as great), that ye said: How is this ? Say (unto them, O  Muhammad): It is from yourselves. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things. 
 <a name="an_003_166">166</a> That which befell you, on the day when the two armies met, was by  permission of Allah; that He might know the true believers; 
 <a name="an_003_167">167</a> And that He might know the hypocrites, unto whom it was said: Come, fight  in the way of Allah, or defend yourselves. They answered: If we knew aught of  fighting we would follow you. On that day they were nearer disbelief than faith. They  utter with their mouths a thing  which is not in their hearts. Allah is Best Aware of  what they hide. 
 <a name="an_003_168">168</a> Those who, while they sat at home, said of their brethren (who were fighting  for the cause of Allah): If they had been guided by us they would not have been slain.  Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Then avert death from yourselves if ye are truthful. 
 <a name="an_003_169">169</a> Think not of those, who are slain in the way of Allah, as dead. Nay, they are  living. With their Lord they have provision. 
 <a name="an_003_170">170</a> Jubilant (are they) because of that which Allah hath bestowed upon them of  His bounty, rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left  behind: That there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. 
 <a name="an_003_171">171</a> They rejoice because of favour from Allah and kindness, and that Allah  wasteth not the wage of the believers. 
 <a name="an_003_172">172</a> As for those who heard the call of Allah and His messenger after the harm  befell them (in the fight); for such of them as do right and ward off (evil), there is  great reward. 
 <a name="an_003_173">173</a> Those unto whom men said: Lo! the people have gathered against you,  therefor fear them. (The threat of danger) but increased the faith of them and they  cried: Allah is Sufficient for us! Most Excellent is He in Whom we trust! 
 <a name="an_003_174">174</a> So they returned with grace and favour from Allah, and no harm touched  them. They followed the good pleasure of Allah, and Allah is of Infinite Bounty. 
 <a name="an_003_175">175</a> It is only the devil who would make (men) fear his partisans. Fear them not;  fear Me, if ye are true believers. 
 <a name="an_003_176">176</a> Let not their conduct grieve thee, who run easily to disbelief, for lo! they  injure Allah not at all. It is Allah's Will to assign them no portion in the Hereafter, and  theirs will be an awful doom. 
 <a name="an_003_177">177</a> Those who purchase disbelief at the price of faith harm Allah not at all, but  theirs will be a painful doom. 
 <a name="an_003_178">178</a> And let not those who disbelieve imagine that the rein We give them bodeth  good unto their souls. We only give them rein that they may grow in sinfulness. And  theirs will be a shameful doom. 
 <a name="an_003_179">179</a> It is not (the purpose) of Allah to leave you in your present state till He shall  separate the wicked from the good. And it is not (the purpose of) Allah to let you  know the Unseen. But Allah chooseth of His messengers whom He will, (to receive  knowledge thereof). So believe in Allah and His messengers. If ye believe and ward  off (evil), yours will be a vast reward. 
 <a name="an_003_180">180</a> And let not those who hoard up that which Allah hath bestowed upon them  of His bounty think that it is better for them. Nay, it is worse for them. That which  they hoard will be their collar on the Day of Resurrection. Allah's is the heritage of  the heavens and the earth, and Allah is Informed of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_003_181">181</a> Verily Allah heard the saying of those who said, (when asked for  contributions to the war): "Allah, forsooth, is poor, and we are rich!" We shall record  their saying with their slaying of the prophets wrongfully and We shall say: Taste ye  the punishment of burning! 
 <a name="an_003_182">182</a> This is on account of that which your own hands have sent before (you to the  judgment). Allah is no oppressor of (His) bondmen. 
 <a name="an_003_183">183</a> (The same are) those who say: Lo! Allah hath charged us that we believe not  in any messenger until he bring us an offering which fire (from heaven) shall devour.  Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Messengers came unto you before me with miracles,  and with that (very miracle) which ye describe. Why then did ye slay them ? (Answer  that) if ye are truthful! 
 <a name="an_003_184">184</a> And if they deny thee, even so did they deny messengers who were before  thee, who came with miracles and with the Psalms and with the Scripture giving light. 
 <a name="an_003_185">185</a> Every soul will taste of death. And ye will be paid on the Day of  Resurrection only that which ye have fairly earned. Whoso is removed from the Fire  and is made to enter paradise, he indeed is triumphant. The life of this world is but  comfort of illusion. 
 <a name="an_003_186">186</a> Assuredly ye will be tried in your property and in your persons, and ye will  hear much wrong from those who were given the Scripture before you, and from the  idolaters. But if ye persevere and ward off (evil), then that is of the steadfast heart of  things. 
 <a name="an_003_187">187</a> And (remember) when Allah laid a charge on those who had received the  Scripture (He said): Ye are to expound it to mankind and not to hide it. But they flung  it behind their backs and bought thereby a little gain. Verily evil is that which they  have gained thereby. 
 <a name="an_003_188">188</a> Think not that those who exult in what they have given, and love to be  praised for what they have not done - Think not, they are in safety from the doom. A  painful doom is theirs. 
 <a name="an_003_189">189</a> Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. Allah is  Able to do all things. 
 <a name="an_003_190">190</a> Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth and (in) the difference of  night and day are tokens (of His Sovereignty) for men of understanding, 
 <a name="an_003_191">191</a> Such as remember Allah, standing, sitting, and reclining, and consider the  creation of the heavens and the earth, (and say): Our Lord! Thou createdst not this in  vain. Glory be to Thee! Preserve us from the doom of Fire. 
 <a name="an_003_192">192</a> Our Lord! Whom Thou causest to enter the Fire: him indeed Thou hast  confounded. For evil-doers there will be no helpers. 
 <a name="an_003_193">193</a> Our Lord! Lo! we have heard a crier calling unto Faith: "Believe ye in your  Lord!" So we believed. Our Lord! Therefor forgive us our sins, and remit from us our  evil deeds, and make us die the death of the righteous. 
 <a name="an_003_194">194</a> Our Lord! And give us that which Thou hast promised to us by Thy  messengers. Confound us not upon the Day of Resurrection. Lo! Thou breakest not  the tryst. 
 <a name="an_003_195">195</a> And their Lord hath heard them (and He saith): Lo! I suffer not the work of  any worker, male or female, to be lost. Ye proceed one from another. So those who  fled and were driven forth from their homes and suffered damage for My cause, and  fought and were slain, verily I shall remit their evil deeds from them and verily I shall  bring them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow - A reward from Allah. And  with Allah is the fairest of rewards. 
 <a name="an_003_196">196</a> Let not the vicissitude (of the success) of those who disbelieve, in the land,  deceive thee (O Muhammad). 
 <a name="an_003_197">197</a> It is but a brief comfort. And afterward their habitation will be hell, an ill  abode. 
 <a name="an_003_198">198</a> But those who keep their duty to their Lord, for them are Gardens underneath  which rivers flow, wherein they will be safe for ever. A gift of welcome from their  Lord. That which Allah hath in store is better for the righteous. 
 <a name="an_003_199">199</a> And lo! of the People of the Scripture there are some who believe in Allah  and that which is revealed unto you and that which was revealed unto them, humbling  themselves before Allah. They purchase not a trifling gain at the price of the  revelations of Allah. Verily their reward is with their Lord. Lo! Allah is swift to take  account. 
 <a name="an_003_200">200</a> O ye who believe! Endure, outdo all others in endurance, be ready, and  observe your duty to Allah, in order that ye may succeed.
