 <h1 align="CENTER">9. at-Taubah: Repentance</h1>
 <a name="an_009_001">1</a> Freedom from obligation (is proclaimed) from Allah and His messenger  toward those of the idolaters with whom ye made a treaty. 
 <a name="an_009_002">2</a> Travel freely in the land four months, and know that ye cannot escape Allah  and that Allah will confound the disbelievers (in His Guidance). 
 <a name="an_009_003">3</a> And a proclamation from Allah and His messenger to all men on the day of  the Greater Pilgrimage that Allah is free from obligation to the idolaters, and (so is)  His messenger. So, if ye repent, it will be better for you; but if ye are averse, then  know that ye cannot escape Allah. Give tidings (O Muhammad) of a painful doom to  those who disbelieve, 
 <a name="an_009_004">4</a> Excepting those of the idolaters with whom ye (Muslims) have a treaty, and  who have since abated nothing of your right nor have supported anyone against you.  (As for these), fulfil their treaty to them till their term. Lo! Allah loveth those who  keep their duty (unto Him). 
 <a name="an_009_005">5</a> Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye  find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each  ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave  their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
 <a name="an_009_006">6</a> And if anyone of the idolaters seeketh thy protection (O Muhammad), then  protect him so that he may hear the Word of Allah, and afterward convey him to his  place of safety. That is because they are a folk who know not. 
 <a name="an_009_007">7</a> How can there be a treaty with Allah and with His messenger for the  idolaters save those with whom ye made a treaty at the Inviolable Place of Worship ?  So long as they are true to you, be true to them. Lo! Allah loveth those who keep their  duty. 
 <a name="an_009_008">8</a> How (can there be any treaty for the others) when, if they have the upper  hand of you, they regard not pact nor honour in respect of you ? They satisfy you with  their mouths the while their hearts refuse. And most of them are wrongdoers. 
 <a name="an_009_009">9</a> They have purchased with the revelations of Allah a little gain, so they debar  (men) from His way. Lo! evil is that which they are wont to do. 
 <a name="an_009_010">10</a> And they observe toward a believer neither pact nor honour. These are they  who are transgressors. 
 <a name="an_009_011">11</a> But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then are they  your brethren in religion. We detail Our revelations for a people who have  knowledge. 
 <a name="an_009_012">12</a> And if they break their pledges after their treaty (hath been made with you)  and assail your religion, then fight the heads of disbelief - Lo! they have no binding  oaths - in order that they may desist. 
 <a name="an_009_013">13</a> Will ye not fight a folk who broke their solemn pledges, and purposed to  drive out the messenger and did attack you first ? What! Fear ye them ? Now Allah  hath more right that ye should fear Him, if ye are believers 
 <a name="an_009_014">14</a> Fight them! Allah will chastise them at your hands, and He will lay them low  and give you victory over them, and He will heal the breasts of folk who are  believers. 
 <a name="an_009_015">15</a> And He will remove the anger of their hearts. Allah relenteth toward whom  He will. Allah is Knower, Wise. 
 <a name="an_009_016">16</a> Or deemed ye that ye would be left (in peace) when Allah yet knoweth not  those of you who strive, choosing for familiar none save Allah and His messenger and  the believers ? Allah is Informed of what ye do. 
 <a name="an_009_017">17</a> It is not for the idolaters to tend Allah's sanctuaries, bearing witness against  themselves of disbelief. As for such, their works are vain and in the Fire they will  abide. 
 <a name="an_009_018">18</a> He only shall tend Allah's sanctuaries who believeth in Allah and the Last  Day and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor-due and feareth none save  Allah. For such (only) is it possible that they can be of the rightly guided. 
 <a name="an_009_019">19</a> Count ye the slaking of a pilgrim's thirst and tendance of the Inviolable Place  of Worship as (equal to the worth of) him who believeth in Allah and the Last Day,  and striveth in the way of Allah ? They are not equal in the sight of Allah. Allah  guideth not wrongdoing folk. 
 <a name="an_009_020">20</a> Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth  and their lives in Allah's way are of much greater worth in Allah's sight. These are  they who are triumphant. 
 <a name="an_009_021">21</a> Their Lord giveth them good tidings of mercy from Him, and acceptance,  and Gardens where enduring pleasure will be theirs; 
 <a name="an_009_022">22</a> There they will abide for ever. Lo! with Allah there is immense reward. 
 <a name="an_009_023">23</a> O ye who believe! Choose not your fathers nor your brethren for friends if  they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith. Whoso of you taketh them for friends,  such are wrong-doers. 
 <a name="an_009_024">24</a> Say: If your fathers, and your sons, and your brethren, and your wives, and  your tribe, and the wealth ye have acquired, and merchandise for which ye fear that  there will no sale, and dwellings ye desire are dearer to you than Allah and His  messenger and striving in His way: then wait till Allah bringeth His command to pass.  Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. 
 <a name="an_009_025">25</a> Allah hath given you victory on many fields and on the day of Huneyn, when  ye exulted in your multitude but it availed you naught, and the earth, vast as it is, was  straitened for you; then ye turned back in flight; 
 <a name="an_009_026">26</a> Then Allah sent His peace of reassurance down upon His messenger and  upon the believers, and sent down hosts ye could not see, and punished those who  disbelieved. Such is the reward of disbelievers. 
 <a name="an_009_027">27</a> Then afterward Allah will relent toward whom He will; for Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful. 
 <a name="an_009_028">28</a> O ye who believe! The idolaters only are unclean. So let them not come near  the Inviolable Place of Worship after this their year. If ye fear poverty (from the loss  of their merchandise) Allah shall preserve you of His bounty if He will. Lo! Allah is  Knower, Wise. 
 <a name="an_009_029">29</a> Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as believe not  in Allah nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His  messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the tribute readily,  being brought low. 
 <a name="an_009_030">30</a> And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah, and the Christians say: The  Messiah is the son of Allah. That is their saying with their mouths. They imitate the  saying of those who disbelieved of old. Allah (Himself) fighteth against them. How  perverse are they! 
 <a name="an_009_031">31</a> They have taken as lords beside Allah their rabbis and their monks and the  Messiah son of Mary, when they were bidden to worship only One God. There is no  God save Him. Be He Glorified from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)! 
 <a name="an_009_032">32</a> Fain would they put out the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah  disdaineth (aught) save that He shall perfect His light, however much the disbelievers  are averse. 
 <a name="an_009_033">33</a> He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the Religion of  Truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion, however much the idolaters  may be averse. 
 <a name="an_009_034">34</a> O ye who believe! Lo! many of the (Jewish) rabbis and the (Christian)  monks devour the wealth of mankind wantonly and debar (men) from the way of  Allah. They who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah, unto  them give tidings (O Muhammad) of a painful doom, 
 <a name="an_009_035">35</a> On the day when it will (all) be heated in the fire of hell, and their foreheads  and their flanks and their backs will be branded therewith (and it will be said unto  them): Here is that which ye hoarded for yourselves. Now taste of what ye used to  hoard. 
 <a name="an_009_036">36</a> Lo! the number of the months with Allah is twelve months by Allah's  ordinance in the day that He created the heavens and the earth. Four of them are  sacred: that is the right religion. So wrong not yourselves in them. And wage war on  all of the idolaters as they are waging war on all of you. And know that Allah is with  those who keep their duty (unto Him). 
 <a name="an_009_037">37</a> Postponement (of a sacred month) is only an excess of disbelief whereby  those who disbelieve are misled; they allow it one year and forbid it (another) year,  that they may make up the number of the months which Allah hath hallowed, so that  they allow that which Allah hath forbidden. The evil of their deeds is made  fairseeming unto them. Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk. 
 <a name="an_009_038">38</a> O ye who believe! What aileth you that when it is said unto you: Go forth in  the way of Allah, ye are bowed down to the ground with heaviness. Take ye pleasure  in the life of the world rather than in the Hereafter ? The comfort of the life of the  world is but little in the Hereafter. 
 <a name="an_009_039">39</a> If ye go not forth He will afflict you with a painful doom, and will choose  instead of you a folk other than you. Ye cannot harm Him at all. Allah is Able to do  all things. 
 <a name="an_009_040">40</a> If ye help him not, still Allah helped him when those who disbelieve drove  him forth, the second of two; when they two were in the cave, when he said unto his  comrade: Grieve not. Lo! Allah is with us. Then Allah caused His peace of  reassurance to descend upon him and supported him with hosts ye cannot see, and  made the word of those who disbelieved the nethermost, while Allah's Word it was  that became the uppermost. Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
 <a name="an_009_041">41</a> Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed, and strive with your wealth and your  lives in the way of Allah! That is best for you if ye but knew. 
 <a name="an_009_042">42</a> Had it been a near adventure and an easy journey they had followed thee, but  the distance seemed too far for them. Yet will they swear by Allah (saying): If we had  been able we would surely have set out with you. They destroy their souls, and Allah  knoweth that they verily are liars. 
 <a name="an_009_043">43</a> Allah forgive thee (O Muhammad)! Wherefor didst thou grant them leave ere  those who told the truth were manifest to thee and thou didst know the liars ? 
 <a name="an_009_044">44</a> Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day ask no leave of thee lest they  should strive with their wealth and their lives. Allah is Aware of those who keep their  duty (unto Him). 
 <a name="an_009_045">45</a> They alone ask leave of thee who believe not in Allah and the Last Day, and  whose hearts feel doubt, so in their doubt they waver. 
 <a name="an_009_046">46</a> And if they had wished to go forth they would assuredly have made ready  some equipment, but Allah was averse to their being sent forth and held them back  and it was said (unto them): Sit ye with the sedentary! 
 <a name="an_009_047">47</a> Had they gone forth among you they had added to you naught save trouble  and had hurried to and fro among you, seeking to cause sedition among you; and  among you there are some who would have listened to them. Allah is Aware of evil- doers. 
 <a name="an_009_048">48</a> Aforetime they sought to cause sedition and raised difficulties for thee till the  Truth came and the decree of Allah was made manifest, though they were loth. 
 <a name="an_009_049">49</a> Of them is he who saith: Grant me leave (to stay at home) and tempt me not.  Surely it is into temptation that they (thus) have fallen. Lo! hell verily is all around  the disbelievers. 
 <a name="an_009_050">50</a> If good befalleth thee (O Muhammad) it afflicteth them, and if calamity  befalleth thee, they say: We took precaution, and they turn away well pleased. 
 <a name="an_009_051">51</a> Say: Naught befalleth us save that which Allah hath decreed for us. He is our  Protecting Friend. In Allah let believers put their trust! 
 <a name="an_009_052">52</a> Say: Can ye await for us aught save one of two good things (death or victory  in Allah's way) ? while we await for you that Allah will afflict you with a doom from  Him or at our hands. Await then! Lo! We are awaiting with you. 
 <a name="an_009_053">53</a> Say: Pay (your contribution), willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted  from you. Lo! ye were ever froward folk. 
 <a name="an_009_054">54</a> And naught preventeth that their contributions should be accepted from them  save that they have disbelieved in Allah and in His messenger, and they come not to  worship save as idlers, and pay not (their contribution) save reluctantly. 
 <a name="an_009_055">55</a> So let not their riches nor their children please thee (O Muhammad). Allah  thereby intendeth but to punish them in the life of the world and that their souls shall  pass away while they are disbelievers. 
 <a name="an_009_056">56</a> And they swear by Allah that they are in truth of you, when they are not of  you, but they are folk who are afraid. 
 <a name="an_009_057">57</a> Had they but found a refuge, or caverns, or a place to enter, they surely had  resorted thither swift as runaways. 
 <a name="an_009_058">58</a> And of them is he who defameth thee in the matter of the alms. If they are  given thereof they are content, and if they are not given thereof, behold! they are  enraged. 
 <a name="an_009_059">59</a> (How much more seemly) had they been content with that which Allah and  His messenger had given them and had said: Allah sufficeth us. Allah will give us of  His bounty, and (also) His messenger. Unto Allah we are suppliants. 
 <a name="an_009_060">60</a> The alms are only for the poor and the needy, and those who collect them,  and those whose hearts are to be reconciled, and to free the captives and the debtors,  and for the cause of Allah, and (for) the wayfarer; a duty imposed by Allah. Allah is  Knower, Wise. 
 <a name="an_009_061">61</a> And of them are those who vex the Prophet and say: He is only a hearer. Say:  A hearer of good for you, who believeth in Allah and is true to the believers, and a  mercy for such of you as believe. Those who vex the messenger of Allah, for them  there is a painful doom. 
 <a name="an_009_062">62</a> They swear by Allah to you (Muslims) to please you, but Allah, with His  messenger, hath more right that they should please Him if they are believers. 
 <a name="an_009_063">63</a> Know they not that whoso opposeth Allah and His messenger, his verily is  fire of hell, to abide therein ? That is the extreme abasement. 
 <a name="an_009_064">64</a> The hypocrites fear lest a surah should be revealed concerning them,  proclaiming what is in their hearts. Say: Scoff (your fill)! Lo! Allah is disclosing what  ye fear. 
 <a name="an_009_065">65</a> And if thou ask them (O Muhammad) they will say: We did but talk and jest.  Say: Was it at Allah and His revelations and His messenger that ye did scoff ? 
 <a name="an_009_066">66</a> Make no excuse. Ye have disbelieved after your (confession of) belief. If We  forgive a party of you, a party of you We shall punish because they have been guilty. 
 <a name="an_009_067">67</a> The hypocrites, both men and women, proceed one from another. They  enjoin the wrong, and they forbid the right, and they withhold their hands (from  spending for the cause of Allah). They forget Allah, so He hath forgotten them. Lo!  the hypocrites, they are the transgressors. 
 <a name="an_009_068">68</a> Allah promiseth the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers  fire of hell for their abode. It will suffice them. Allah curseth them, and theirs is  lasting torment. 
 <a name="an_009_069">69</a> Even as those before you who were mightier than you in strength, and more  affluent than you in wealth and children. They enjoyed their lot awhile, so ye enjoy  your lot awhile even as those before you did enjoy their lot awhile. And ye prate even  as they prated. Such are they whose works have perished in the world and the  Hereafter. Such are they who are the losers. 
 <a name="an_009_070">70</a> Hath not the fame of those before them reached them - the folk of Noah,  A'ad, Thamud, the folk of Abraham, the dwellers of Midian and the disasters (which  befell them) ? Their messengers (from Allah) came unto them with proofs (of Allah's  Sovereignty). So Allah surely wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves. 
 <a name="an_009_071">71</a> And the believers, men and women, are protecting friends one of another;  they enjoin the right and forbid the wrong, and they establish worship and they pay  the poor-due, and they obey Allah and His messenger. As for these, Allah will have  mercy on them. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
 <a name="an_009_072">72</a> Allah promiseth to the believers, men and women, Gardens underneath  which rivers flow, wherein they will abide - blessed dwellings in Gardens of Eden.  And - greater (far)! - acceptance from Allah. That is the supreme triumph. 
 <a name="an_009_073">73</a> O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites! Be harsh with  them. Their ultimate abode is hell, a hapless journey's end. 
 <a name="an_009_074">74</a> They swear by Allah that they said nothing (wrong), yet they did say the  word of disbelief, and did disbelieve after their Surrender (to Allah). And they  purposed that which they could not attain, and they sought revenge only that Allah by  His messenger should enrich them of His bounty. If they repent it will be better for  them; and if they turn away, Allah will afflict them with a painful doom in the world  and the Hereafter, and they have no protecting friend nor helper in the earth. 
 <a name="an_009_075">75</a> And of them is he who made a covenant with Allah (saying): If He give us of  His bounty we will give alms and become of the righteous. 
 <a name="an_009_076">76</a> Yet when He gave them of His bounty, they hoarded it and turned away,  averse; 
 <a name="an_009_077">77</a> So He hath made the consequence (to be) hypocrisy in their hearts until the  day when they shall meet Him, because they broke their word to Allah that they  promised Him, and because they lied. 
 <a name="an_009_078">78</a> Know they not that Allah knoweth both their secret and the thought that they  confide, and that Allah is the Knower of Things Hidden ? 
 <a name="an_009_079">79</a> Those who point at such of the believers as give the alms willingly and such  as can find naught to give but their endeavours, and deride them - Allah (Himself)  derideth them. Theirs will be a painful doom. 
 <a name="an_009_080">80</a> Ask forgiveness for them (O Muhammad), or ask not forgiveness for them;  though thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times Allah will not forgive them. That  is because they disbelieved in Allah and His messenger, and Allah guideth not  wrongdoing folk. 
 <a name="an_009_081">81</a> Those who were left behind rejoiced at sitting still behind the messenger of  Allah, and were averse to striving with their wealth and their lives in Allah's way.  And they said: Go not forth in the heat! Say: The fire of hell is more intense of heat, if  they but understood. 
 <a name="an_009_082">82</a> Then let them laugh a little: they will weep much, as the reward of what they  used to earn. 
 <a name="an_009_083">83</a> If Allah bring thee back (from the campaign) unto a party of them and they  ask of thee leave to go out (to fight), then say unto them: Ye shall never more go out  with me nor fight with me against a foe.  Ye were content with sitting still the first  time. So sit still, with the useless. 
 <a name="an_009_084">84</a> And never (O Muhammad) pray for one of them who dieth, nor stand by his  grave. Lo! they disbelieved in Allah and His messenger, and they died while they  were evil-doers. 
 <a name="an_009_085">85</a> Let not their wealth nor their children please thee! Allah purposeth only to  punish them thereby in the world, and that their souls shall pass away while they are  disbelievers. 
 <a name="an_009_086">86</a> And when a surah is revealed (which saith): Believe in Allah and strive along  with His messenger, the men of wealth among them still ask leave of thee and say:  Suffer us to be with those who sit (at home). 
 <a name="an_009_087">87</a> They are content that they should be with the useless and their hearts are  sealed, so that they apprehend not. 
 <a name="an_009_088">88</a> But the messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth  and their lives. Such are they for whom are the good things. Such are they who are the  successful. 
 <a name="an_009_089">89</a> Allah hath made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow,  wherein they will abide. That is the supreme triumph. 
 <a name="an_009_090">90</a> And those among the wandering Arabs who had an excuse came in order that  permission might be granted them. And those who lied to Allah and His messenger  sat at home. A painful doom will fall on those of them who disbelieve. 
 <a name="an_009_091">91</a> Not unto the weak nor unto the sick nor unto those who can find naught to  spend is any fault (to be imputed though they stay at home) if they are true to Allah  and His messenger. Not unto the good is there any road (of blame). Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful. 
 <a name="an_009_092">92</a> Nor unto those whom, when they came to thee (asking) that thou shouldst  mount them, thou didst tell: I cannot find whereon to mount you. They turned back  with eyes flowing with tears, for sorrow that they could not find the means to spend. 
 <a name="an_009_093">93</a> The road (of blame) is only against those who ask for leave of thee (to stay at  home) when they are rich. They are content to be with the useless. Allah hath sealed  their hearts so that they know not. 
 <a name="an_009_094">94</a> They will make excuse to you (Muslims) when ye return unto them. Say:  Make no excuse, for we shall not believe you. Allah hath told us tidings of you. Allah  and His messenger will see your conduct, and then ye will be brought back unto Him  Who knoweth the Invisible as well as the Visible, and He will tell you what ye used  to do. 
 <a name="an_009_095">95</a> They will swear by Allah unto you, when ye return unto them, that ye may  let them be. Let them be, for lo! they are unclean, and their abode is hell as the reward  for what they used to earn. 
 <a name="an_009_096">96</a> They swear unto you, that ye may accept them. Though ye accept them.  Allah verily accepteth not wrongdoing folk. 
 <a name="an_009_097">97</a> The wandering Arabs are more hard in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more  likely to be ignorant of the limits which Allah hath revealed unto His messenger. And  Allah is Knower, Wise. 
 <a name="an_009_098">98</a> And of the wandering Arabs there is he who taketh that which he expendeth  (for the cause of Allah) as a loss, and awaiteth (evil) turns of fortune for you (that he  may be rid of it). The evil turn of fortune will be theirs. Allah is Hearer, Knower. 
 <a name="an_009_099">99</a> And of the wandering Arabs there is he who believeth in Allah and the Last  Day, and taketh that which he expendeth and also the prayers of the messenger as  acceptable offerings in the sight of Allah. Lo! verily it is an acceptable offering for  them. Allah will bring them into His mercy. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
 <a name="an_009_100">100</a> And the first to lead the way, of the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and those who  followed them in goodness - Allah is well pleased with them and they are well  pleased with Him, and He hath made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers  flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the supreme triumph. 
 <a name="an_009_101">101</a> And among those around you of the wandering Arabs there are hypocrites,  and among the townspeople of Al-Madinah (there are some who) persist in hypocrisy  whom thou (O Muhammad) knowest not. We, We know them, and We shall chastise  them twice; then they will be relegated to a painful doom. 
 <a name="an_009_102">102</a> And (there are) others who have acknowledged their faults. They mixed a  righteous action with another that was bad. It may be that Allah will relent toward  them. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
 <a name="an_009_103">103</a> Take alms of their wealth, wherewith thou mayst purify them and mayst  make them grow, and pray for them. Lo! thy prayer is an assuagement for them. Allah  is Hearer, Knower. 
 <a name="an_009_104">104</a> Know they not that Allah is He Who accepteth repentance from His  bondmen and taketh the alms, and that Allah is He Who is the Relenting, the  Merciful. 
 <a name="an_009_105">105</a> And say (unto them): Act! Allah will behold your actions, and (so will) His  messenger and the believers, and ye will be brought back to the Knower of the  Invisible and the Visible, and He will tell you what ye used to do. 
 <a name="an_009_106">106</a> And (there are) others who await Allah's decree, whether He will punish  them or will forgive them. Allah is Knower, Wise. 
 <a name="an_009_107">107</a> And as for those who chose a place of worship out of opposition and  disbelief, and in order to cause dissent among the believers, and as an outpost for  those who warred against Allah and His messenger aforetime, they will surely swear:  We purposed naught save good. Allah beareth witness that they verily are liars. 
 <a name="an_009_108">108</a> Never stand (to pray) there. A place of worship which was found upon duty  (to Allah) from the first day is more worthy that thou shouldst stand (to pray) therein,  wherein are men who love to purify themselves. Allah loveth the purifiers. 
 <a name="an_009_109">109</a> Is he who founded his building upon duty to Allah and His good pleasure  better; or he who founded his building on the brink of a crumbling, overhanging  precipice so that it toppled with him into the fire of hell ? Allah guideth not  wrongdoing folk. 
 <a name="an_009_110">110</a> The building which they built will never cease to be a misgiving in their  hearts unless their hearts be torn to pieces. Allah is Knower, Wise. 
 <a name="an_009_111">111</a> Lo! Allah hath bought from the believers their lives and their wealth because  the Garden will be theirs: they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be  slain. It is a promise which is binding on Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the  Qur'an. Who fulfilleth His covenant better than Allah ? Rejoice then in your bargain  that ye have made, for that is the supreme triumph. 
 <a name="an_009_112">112</a> (Triumphant) are those who turn repentant (to Allah), those who serve  (Him), those who praise (Him), those who fast, those who bow down, those who fall  prostrate (in worship), those who enjoin the right and who forbid the wrong and those  who keep the limits (ordained) of Allah - And give glad tidings to believers! 
 <a name="an_009_113">113</a> It is not for the Prophet, and those who believe, to pray for the forgiveness of  idolaters even though they may be near of kin (to them) after it hath become clear that  they are people of hell-fire. 
 <a name="an_009_114">114</a> The prayer of Abraham for the forgiveness of his father was only because of  a promise he had promised him, but when it had become clear unto him that he (his  father) was an enemy to Allah he (Abraham) disowned him. Lo! Abraham was soft of  heart, long-suffering. 
 <a name="an_009_115">115</a> It was never Allah's (part) that He should send a folk astray after He had  guided them until He had made clear unto them what they should avoid. Lo! Allah is  Aware of all things. 
 <a name="an_009_116">116</a> Lo! Allah! Unto Him belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth.  He quickeneth and He giveth death. And ye have, instead of Allah, no protecting  friend nor helper. 
 <a name="an_009_117">117</a> Allah hath turned in mercy to the Prophet, and to the Muhajirin and the  Ansar who followed him in the hour of hardship. After the hearts of a party of them  had almost swerved aside, then turned He unto them in mercy. Lo! He is Full of Pity,  Merciful for them. 
 <a name="an_009_118">118</a> And to the three also (did He turn in mercy) who were left behind, when the  earth, vast as it is, was straitened for them, and their own souls were straitened for  them till they bethought them that there is no refuge from Allah save toward Him.  Then turned He unto them in mercy that they (too) might turn (repentant unto Him).  Lo! Allah! He is the Relenting, the Merciful. 
 <a name="an_009_119">119</a> O ye who believe! Be careful of your duty to Allah, and be with the truthful. 
 <a name="an_009_120">120</a> It is not for the townsfolk of Al-Madinah and for those around them of the  wandering Arabs so stay behind the messenger of Allah and prefer their lives to his  life. That is because neither thirst nor toil nor hunger afflicteth them in the way of  Allah, nor step they any step that angereth the disbelievers, nor gain they from the  enemy a gain, but a good deed is recorded for them therefor. Lo! Allah loseth not the  wages of the good. 
 <a name="an_009_121">121</a> Nor spend they any spending, small or great, nor do they cross a valley, but it  is recorded for them, that Allah may repay them the best of what they used to do. 
 <a name="an_009_122">122</a> And the believers should not all go out to fight. Of every troop of them, a  party only should go forth, that they (who are left behind) may gain sound knowledge  in religion, and that they may warn their folk when they return to them, so that they  may beware. 
 <a name="an_009_123">123</a> O ye who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you, and  let them find harshness in you, and know that Allah is with those who keep their duty  (unto Him). 
 <a name="an_009_124">124</a> And whenever a surah is revealed there are some of them who say: Which  one of you hath thus increased in faith ? As for those who believe, it hath increased  them in faith and they rejoice (therefor). 
 <a name="an_009_125">125</a> But as for those in whose hearts is disease, it only addeth wickedness to their  wickedness, and they die while they are disbelievers. 
 <a name="an_009_126">126</a> See they not that they are tested once or twice in every year ? Still they turn  not in repentance, neither pay they heed. 
 <a name="an_009_127">127</a> And whenever a surah is revealed, they look one at another (as who should  say): Doth anybody see you ? Then they turn away. Allah turneth away their hearts  because they are a folk who understand not. 
 <a name="an_009_128">128</a> There hath come unto you a messenger, (one) of yourselves, unto whom  aught that ye are overburdened is grievous, full of concern for you, for the believers  full of pity, merciful. 
 <a name="an_009_129">129</a> Now, if they turn away (O Muhammad) say: Allah sufficeth me. There is no  God save Him. In Him have I put my trust, and He is Lord of the Tremendous  Throne.
