 <p>Once on a time from all the Circles seven <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1</font></span><br> Between the stedfast Earth and rolling Heaven<br> THE BIRDS, of all Note, Plumage, and Degree,<br> That float in Air, and roost upon the Tree;<br> And they that from the Waters snatch their Meat,<br> And they that scour the Desert with long Feet;<br> Birds of all Natures, known or not to Man,<br> Flock'd from all Quarters into full Divan,<br> On no less solemn business than to find<br> Or choose, a Sultan Khalif of their kind, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">10</font></span><br> For whom, if never theirs, or lost, they pined.<br> The Snake had his, 'twas said; and so the Beast<br> His Lion-lord: and Man had his, at least:<br> And that the Birds, who nearest were the Skies,<br> And went apparell'd in its Angel Dyes.<br> Should be withoutunder no better Law<br> Than that which lost all other in the Maw<br> Disperst without a Bond of Unionnay,<br> Or meeting to make each the other's Prey<br> This was the Grievancethis the solemn Thing <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">20</font></span><br> On which the scatter'd Commonwealth of Wing,<br> From all the four Winds, flying like to Cloud<br> That met and blacken'd Heav'n, and Thunder-loud<br> With Sound of whirring Wings and Beaks that clash'd<br> Down like a Torrent on the Desert dash'd:<br> Till by Degrees, the Hubbub and Pell-mell<br> Into some Order and Precedence fell,<br> And, Proclamation made of Silence, each<br> In special Accent, but in general Speech<br> That all should understand, as seem'd him best, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">30</font></span><br> The Congregation of all Wings addrest.</p>  
 <p>And first, with Heart so full as from his Eyes<br> Ran weeping, up rose Tajidar the Wise;<br> The mystic Mark upon whose Bosom show'd<br> That He alone of all the Birds THE ROAD<br> Had travell'd: and the Crown upon his Head<br> Had reach'd the Goal; and He stood forth and said:</p>  
 <p>'O Birds, by what Authority divine<br> I speak you know by <i>His</i> authentic Sign,<br> And Name, emblazon'd on my Breast and Bill: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">40</font></span><br> Whose Counsel I assist at, and fulfil:<br> At His Behest I measured as he plann'd<br> The Spaces of the Air and Sea and Land;<br> I gauged the secret sources of the Springs<br> From Cloud to Fish: the Shadow of my Wings<br> Dream'd over sleeping Deluge: piloted<br> The Blast that bore Sulayman's Throne: and led<br> The Cloud of Birds that canopied his Head;<br> Whose Word I brought to Balkis: and I shared<br> The Counsel that with Asaf he prepared. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">50</font></span><br> And now you want a Khalif: and I know<br> Him, and his whereabout, and How to go:<br> And go alone I could, and plead your cause<br> Alone for all: but, by the eternal laws,<br> Yourselves by Toil and Travel of your own<br> Must for your old Delinquency atone.<br> Were you indeed not blinded by the Curse<br> Of Self-exile, that still grows worse and worse,<br> Yourselves would know that, though <i>you</i> see him not,<br> He is with you this Moment, on this Spot, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">60</font></span><br> Your Lord through all Forgetfulness and Crime,<br> Here, There, and Everywhere, and through all Time.<br> But as a Father, whom some wayward Child<br> By sinful Self-will has unreconciled,<br> Waits till the sullen Reprobate at cost<br> Of long Repentance should regain the Lost;<br> Therefore, yourselves to see as you are seen,<br> Yourselves must bridge the Gulf you made between<br> By such a Search and Travel to be gone<br> Up to the mighty mountain Kaf, whereon <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">70</font></span><br> Hinges the World, and round about whose Knees<br> Into one Ocean mingle the Sev'n Seas;<br> In whose impenetrable Forest-folds<br> Of Light and Dark "Symurgh" his Presence holds;<br> Not to be reach'd, if to be reach'd at all<br> But by a Road the stoutest might apal;<br> Of Travel not of Days or Months, but Years<br> Life-long perhaps: of Dangers, Doubts, and Fears<br> As yet unheard of: Sweat of Blood and Brain<br> Interminableoften all in vain<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">80</font></span><br> And, if successful, no Return again:<br> A Road whose very Preparation scared<br> The Traveller who yet must be prepared.<br> Who then this Travel to Result would bring<br> Needs both a Lion's Heart beneath the Wing,<br> And even more, a Spirit purified<br> Of Worldly Passion, Malice, Lust, and Pride:<br> Yea, ev'n of Worldly <i>Wisdom</i>, which grows dim<br> And dark, the nearer it approaches <i>Him</i>,<br> Who to the Spirit's Eye alone reveal'd, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">90</font></span><br> By sacrifice of Wisdom's self unseal'd;<br> Without which none who reach the Place could bear<br> To look upon the Glory dwelling there.'</p>  
 <p>One Night from out the swarming City Gate<br> Stept holy Bajazyd, to meditate<br> Alone amid the breathing Fields that lay<br> In solitary Silence leagues away,<br> Beneath a Moon and Stars as bright as Day.<br> And the Saint wondering such a Temple were,<br> And so lit up, and scarce one worshipper, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">100</font></span><br> A voice from Heav'n amid the stillness said:<br> 'The Royal Road is not for all to tread,<br> Nor is the Royal Palace for the Rout,<br> Who, even if they reach it, are shut out.<br> The Blaze that from my Harim window breaks<br> With fright the Rabble of the Roadside takes;<br> And ev'n of those that at my Portal din,<br> Thousands may knock for one that enters in.'</p>  
 <p>Thus spoke the Tajidar: and the wing'd Crowd,<br> That underneath his Word in Silence bow'd, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">110</font></span><br> Clapp'd Acclamation: and their Hearts and Eyes<br> Were kindled by the Firebrand of the Wise.<br> They felt their Degradation: they believed<br> The word that told them how to be retrieved,<br> And in that glorious Consummation won<br> Forgot the Cost at which it must be done.<br> 'They only <i>long'd</i> to follow: they would go<br> Whither he led, through Flood, or Fire, or Snow'<br> So cried the Multitude. But some there were<br> Who listen'd with a cold disdainful air, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">120</font></span><br> Content with what they were, or grudging Cost<br> Of Time or Travel that might all be lost;<br> These, one by one, came forward, and preferr'd<br> Unwise Objection: which the wiser Word<br> Shot with direct Reproof, or subtly round<br> With Argument and Allegory wound.</p>  
 <p>The <i>Pheasant</i> first would know by what pretence<br> The Tajidar to that pre-eminence<br> Was raiseda Bird, but for his lofty Crest<br> (And such the Pheasant had) like all the Rest<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">130</font></span><br> Who answer'd'By no Virtue of my own<br> Sulayman chose me, but by <i>His</i> alone:<br> Not by the Gold and Silver of my Sighs<br> Made mine, but the free Largess of his Eyes.<br> Behold the Grace of Allah comes and goes<br> As to Itself is good: and no one knows<br> Which way it turns: in that mysterious Court<br> Not he most finds who furthest travels for't.<br> For one may crawl upon his knees Life-long,<br> And yet may never reach, or all go wrong: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">140</font></span><br> Another just arriving at the Place<br> He toil'd for, andthe Door shut in his Face:<br> Whereas Another, scarcely gone a Stride,<br> And suddenlyBehold he is Inside!<br> But though the Runner win not, he that <i>stands</i>,<br> No Thorn will turn to Roses in <i>his</i> Hands:<br> Each one must do his best and all endure,<br> And all endeavour, hoping but not sure.<br> Heav'n its own Umpire is; its Bidding do,<br> And Thou perchance shalt be Sulayman's too.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">150</font></span></p>  
 <p>One day Shah Mahmud, riding with the Wind<br> A-hunting, left his Retinue behind,<br> And coming to a River, whose swift Course<br> Doubled back Game and Dog, and Man and Horse,<br> Beheld upon the Shore a little Lad<br> A-fishing, very poor, and Tatter-clad<br> He was, and weeping as his Heart would break.<br> So the Great Sultan, for good humour's sake<br> Pull'd in his Horse a moment, and drew nigh,<br> And after making his Salam, ask'd why <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">160</font></span><br> He weptweeping, the Sultan said, so sore<br> As he had never seen one weep before.<br> The Boy look'd up, and 'O Amir,' he said,<br> 'Sev'n of us are at home, and Father dead,<br> And Mother left with scarce a Bit of Bread:<br> And now since Sunrise have I fish'dand see!<br> Caught nothing for our SupperWoe is Me!'<br> The Sultan lighted from his horse. 'Behold,'<br> Said he, 'Good Fortune will not be controll'd:<br> And, since Today yours seems to turn from you, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">170</font></span><br> Suppose we try for once what mine will do,<br> And we will share alike in all I win.'<br> So the Shah took, and flung his Fortune in,<br> The Net; which, cast by the Great Mahmud's Hand,<br> A hundred glittering Fishes brought to Land.<br> The Lad look'd up in WonderMahmud smiled<br> And vaulted into Saddle. But the Child<br> Ran after'Nay, Amir, but half the Haul<br> Is yours by Bargain''Nay, Today take all,'<br> The Sultan cried, and shook his Bridle free<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">180</font></span><br> 'But mindTomorrow All belongs to Me'<br> And so rode off. Next morning at Divan<br> The Sultan's Mind upon his Bargain ran,<br> And being somewhat in a mind for sport<br> Sent for the Lad: who, carried up to Court,<br> And marching into Royalty's full Blaze<br> With such a Catch of Fish as yesterday's,<br> The Sultan call'd and set him by his side,<br> And asking him, 'What Luck?' The Boy replied,<br> '<i>This</i> is the Luck that follows every Cast, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">190</font></span><br> Since o'er my Net the Sultan's Shadow pass'd.'</p>  
 <p>Then came <i>The Nightingale</i>, from such a Draught<br> Of Ecstasy that from the Rose he quaff'd<br> Reeling as drunk, and ever did distil<br> In exquisite divisions from his Bill<br> To inflame the Hearts of Menand thus sang He<br> 'To me alone, alone, is giv'n the Key<br> Of Love; of whose whole Mystery possesst,<br> When I reveal a little to the Rest,<br> Forthwith Creation listening forsakes <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">200</font></span><br> The Reins of Reason, and my Frenzy takes:<br> Yea, whosoever once has quaint this wine<br> He leaves unlisten'd David's Song for mine.<br> In vain do Men for my Divisions strive,<br> And die themselves making dead Lutes alive:<br> I hang the Stars with Meshes for Men's Souls:<br> The Garden underneath my Music rolls.<br> The long, long Morns that mourn the Rose away<br> I sit in silence, and on Anguish prey:<br> But the first Air which the New Year shall breathe <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">210</font></span><br> Up to my Boughs of Message from beneath<br> That in her green Harim my Bride unveils,<br> My Throat bursts silence and <i>her</i> Advent hails,<br> Who in her crimson Volume registers<br> The Notes of Him whose Life is lost in hers.<br> The Rose I love and worship now is here;<br> If dying, yet reviving, Year by Year;<br> But that you tell of, all my Life why waste<br> In vainly searching; or, if found, not taste?'</p>  
 <p>So with Division infinite and Trill <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">220</font></span><br> On would the Nightingale have warbled still,<br> And all the World have listen'd; but a Note<br> Of sterner Import check'd the lovesick Throat.</p>  
 <p>'O watering with thy melodious Tears<br> Love's Garden, and who dost indeed the Ears<br> Of men with thy melodious Fingers mould<br> As David's Finger Iron did of old:<br> Why not, like David, dedicate thy Dower<br> Of Song to something better than a Flower?<br> Empress indeed of Beauty, so they say, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">230</font></span><br> But one whose Empire hardly lasts a Day,<br> By Insurrection of the Morning's Breath<br> That made her hurried to Decay and Death:<br> And while she lasts contented to be seen,<br> And worshipt, for the Garden's only Queen,<br> Leaving thee singing on thy Bough forlorn,<br> Or if she smile on Thee, perhaps in Scorn.'</p>  
 <p>Like that fond Dervish waiting in the throng<br> When some World-famous Beauty went along,<br> Who smiling on the Antic as she pass'd<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">240</font></span><br> Forthwith Staff, Bead and Scrip away he cast,<br> And grovelling in the Kennel, took to whine<br> Before her Door among the Dogs and Swine.<br> Which when she often went unheeding by,<br> But one day quite as heedless ask'd him'Why?'<br> He told of that one Smile, which, all the Rest<br> Passing, had kindled Hope within his Breast<br> Again she smiled and said, 'O self-beguiled<br> Poor Wretch, at whom and not on whom I smiled.'</p>  
 <p>Then came the subtle <i>Parrot</i> in a coat <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">250</font></span><br> Greener than Greensward, and about his Throat<br> A Collar ran of sub-sulphureous Gold;<br> And in his Beak a Sugar-plum he troll'd,<br> That all his Words with luscious Lisping ran,<br> And to this Tune'O cruel Cage, and Man<br> More iron still who did confine me there,<br> Who else with him whose Livery I wear<br> Ere this to his Eternal Fount had been,<br> And drunk what should have kept me ever-green.<br> But now I know the Place, and I am free <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">260</font></span><br> To go, and all the Wise will follow Me.<br> Some'and upon the Nightingale one Eye<br> He leer'd'for nothing but the Blossom sigh:<br> But I am for the luscious Pulp that grows<br> Where, and for which the Blossom only blows:<br> And which so long as the Green Tree provides<br> What better grows along Kaf's dreary Sides?<br> And what more needful Prophet <i>there</i> than He<br> Who gives me Life to nip it from the Tree?'</p>  
 <p>To whom the Tajidar'O thou whose Best <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">270</font></span><br> In the green leaf of Paradise is drest,<br> But whose Neck kindles with a lower Fire<br> O slip the collar off of base Desire,<br> And stand apparell'd in Heav'n's Woof entire!<br> <i>This</i> Life that hangs so sweet about your Lips<br> But, spite of all your Khizar, slips and slips,<br> What is it but itself the coarser Rind<br> Of the True Life withinside and behind,<br> Which he shall never never reach unto<br> Till the gross Shell of Carcase he break through?' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">280</font></span></p>  
 <p>For what said He, that dying Hermit, whom<br> Your Prophet came to, trailing through the Gloom<br> His Emerald Vest, and tempted'Come with Me,<br> And Live.' The Hermit answered'Not with Thee.<br> Two Worlds there are, and <i>This</i> was thy Design,<br> And thou hast got it; but The <i>Next</i> is mine;<br> Whose Fount is <i>this</i> life's Death, and to whose Side<br> Ev'n now I find my Way without a Guide.'</p>  
 <p>Then like a Sultan glittering in all Rays<br> Of Jewelry, and deckt with his own Blaze, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">290</font></span><br> The glorious Peacock swept into the Ring:<br> And, turning slowly that the glorious Thing<br> Might fill all Eyes with wonder, thus said He.<br> 'Behold, the Secret Artist, making me,<br> With no one Colour of the skies bedeckt,<br> But from its Angel's Feathers did select<br> To make up mine withal, the Gabriel<br> Of all the Birds: though from my Place I fell<br> In Eden, when Acquaintance I did make<br> In those blest days with that Sev'n-headed Snake, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">300</font></span><br> And thence with him, my perfect Beauty marr'd<br> With these ill Feet, was thrust out and debarr'd.<br> Little I care for Worldly Fruit or Flower,<br> Would you restore me to lost Eden's Bower,<br> But first my Beauty making all complete<br> With reparation of these ugly Feet.'</p>  
 <p>'Were it,' 'twas answer'd, 'only to return<br> To that lost Eden, better far to burn<br> In Self-abasement up thy pluméd Pride,<br> And ev'n with lamer feet to creep inside<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">310</font></span><br> But all mistaken you and all like you<br> That long for that lost Eden as the true;<br> Fair as it was, still nothing but the shade<br> And Out-court of the Majesty that made.<br> That which I point you tow'rd, and which the King<br> I tell you of broods over with his Wing,<br> With no deciduous leaf, but with the Rose<br> Of Spiritual Beauty, smells and glows:<br> No plot of Earthly Pleasance, but the whole<br> True Garden of the Universal Soul.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">320</font></span></p>  
 <p>For so Creation's Master-Jewel fell<br> From that same Eden: loving which too well,<br> The Work before the Artist did prefer,<br> And in the Garden lost the Gardener.<br> Wherefore one Day about the Garden went<br> A voice that found him in his false Content,<br> And like a bitter Sarsar of the North<br> Shrivell'd the Garden up, and drove him forth<br> Into the Wilderness: and so the Eye<br> Of Eden closed on him till by and by. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">330</font></span></p>  
 <p>Then from a Ruin where conceal'd he lay<br> Watching his buried Gold, and hating Day,<br> Hooted <i>The Owl</i>.'I tell you, my Delight<br> Is in the Ruin and the Dead of Night<br> Where I was born, and where I love to wone<br> All my Life long, sitting on some cold stone<br> Away from all your roystering Companies,<br> In some dark Corner where a Treasure lies;<br> That, buried by some Miser in the Dark,<br> Speaks up to me at Midnight like a Spark; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">340</font></span><br> And o'er it like a Talisman I brood,<br> Companion of the Serpent and the Toad.<br> What need of other Sovereign, having found,<br> And keeping as in Prison underground,<br> One before whom all other Kings bow down,<br> And with his glittering Heel their Foreheads crown?'</p>  
 <p>'He that a Miser lives and Miser dies,<br> At the Last Day what Figure shall he rise?'</p>  
 <p>A Fellow all his life lived hoarding Gold,<br> And, dying, hoarded left it. And behold, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">350</font></span><br> One Night his Son saw peering through the House<br> A Man, with yet the semblance of a Mouse,<br> Watching a crevice in the Walland cried<br> 'My Father?''Yes,' the Musulman replied,<br> 'Thy Father!''But why watching thus?''For fear<br> Lest any smell my Treasure buried here.'<br> 'But wherefore, Sir, so metamousified?'<br> 'Because, my Son, such is the true outside<br> Of the inner Soul by which I lived and died.'</p>  
 <p>'Aye,' said <i>The Partridge</i>, with his Foot and Bill <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">360</font></span><br> Crimson with raking Rubies from the Hill,<br> And clattering his Spurs'Wherewith the Ground<br> I stab,' said he, 'for Rubies, that, when found<br> I swallow; which, as soon as swallow'd, turn<br> To Sparks which though my beak and eyes do burn.<br> Gold, as you say, is but dull Metal dead,<br> And hanging on the Hoarder's Soul like Lead:<br> But Rubies that have Blood within, and grown<br> And nourisht in the Mountain Heart of Stone,<br> Burn with an inward Light, which they inspire, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">370</font></span><br> And make their Owners Lords of their Desire.'</p>  
 <p>To whom the Tajidar'As idly sold<br> To the quick Pebble as the drowsy Gold,<br> As dead when sleeping in their mountain mine<br> As dangerous to Him who makes them shine:<br> Slavish indeed to do their Lord's Commands,<br> And slave-like aptest to escape his Hands,<br> And serve a second Master like the first,<br> And working all their wonders for the worst.'</p>  
 <p>Never was Jewel after or before <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">380</font></span><br> Like that Sulayman for a Signet wore:<br> Whereby one Ruby, weighing scarce a grain<br> Did Sea and Land and all therein constrain,<br> Yea, ev'n the Winds of Heav'nmade the fierce East<br> Bear his League-wide Pavilion like a Beast,<br> Whither he would: yea, the Good Angel held<br> His subject, and the lower Fiend compell'd.<br> Till, looking round about him in his pride,<br> He overtax'd the Fountain that supplied,<br> Praying that after him no Son of Clay <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">390</font></span><br> Should ever touch his Glory. And one Day<br> Almighty God his Jewel stole away,<br> And gave it to the Div, who with the Ring<br> Wore also the Resemblance of the King,<br> And so for forty days play'd such a Game<br> As blots Sulayman's forty years with Shame.</p>  
 <p>Then <i>The Shah-Falcon</i>, tossing up his Head<br> Blink-hooded as it was'Behold,' he said,<br> 'I am the chosen Comrade of the King,<br> And perch upon the Fist that wears the Ring; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">400</font></span><br> Born, bred, and nourisht, in the Royal Court,<br> I take the Royal Name and make the Sport.<br> And if strict Discipline I undergo<br> And half my Life am blindedbe it so;<br> Because the Shah's Companion ill may brook<br> On aught save Royal Company to look.<br> And why am Ito leave my King, and fare<br> With all these Rabble Wings I know not where?'</p>  
 <p>'O blind indeed'the Answer was, 'and dark<br> To any but a vulgar Mortal Mark, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">410</font></span><br> And drunk with Pride of Vassalage to those<br> Whose Humour like their Kingdom comes and goes;<br> All Mutability: who one Day please<br> To give: and next Day what they gave not seize:<br> Like to the Fire: a dangerous Friend at best,<br> Which who keeps farthest from does wiseliest.</p>  
 <p>A certain Shah there was in Days foregone<br> Who had a lovely Slave he doted on,<br> And cherish'd as the Apple of his Eye,<br> Clad gloriously, fed sumptuously, set high, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">420</font></span><br> And never was at Ease were <i>He</i> not by,<br> Who yet, for all this Sunshine, Day by Day<br> Was seen to wither like a Flower away.<br> Which, when observing, one without the Veil<br> Of Favour ask'd the Favourite'Why so pale<br> And sad?' thus sadly answer'd the poor Thing<br> 'No Sun that rises sets until the King,<br> Whose Archery is famous among Men,<br> Aims at an Apple on my Head. and when<br> The stricken Apple splits. and those who stand <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">430</font></span><br> Around cry "Lo! the Shah's unerring Hand!"<br> Then He too laughing asks me "Why so pale<br> And sorrow-some? as could the Sultan fail,<br> Who such a master of the Bow confest,<br> And aiming by the Head that he loves best."'</p>  
 <p>Then on a sudden swoop'd <i>The Phoenix</i> down<br> As though he wore as well as gave The Crown:<br> And cried'I care not, I, to wait on Kings,<br> Whose crowns are but the Shadow of my Wings!'</p>  
 <p>'Aye,' was the Answer'And, pray, how has sped, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">440</font></span><br> On which it lighted, many a mortal Head?'</p>  
 <p>A certain Sultan dying, his Vizier<br> In Dream beheld him, and in mortal Fear<br> Began'O mighty Shah of Shahs! Thrice-blest'<br> But loud the Vision shriek'd and struck its Breast,<br> And 'Stab me not with empty Title!' cried<br> 'One only Shah there is, and none beside,<br> Who from his Throne above for certain Ends<br> Awhile some Spangle of his Glory lends<br> To Men on Earth; but calling in again <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">450</font></span><br> Exacts a strict account of every Grain.<br> Sultan I lived, and held the World in scorn:<br> O better had I glean'd the Field of Corn!<br> O better had I been a Beggar born,<br> And for my Throne and Crown, down in the Dust<br> My living Head had laid where Dead I must!<br> O wither'd, wither'd, wither'd, be the Wing<br> Whose overcasting Shadow made me King!'</p>  
 <p>Then from a Pond, where all day long he kept,<br> Waddled the dapper <i>Duck</i> demure, adept <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">460</font></span><br> At infinite Ablution, and precise<br> In keeping of his Raiment clean and nice.<br> And 'Sure of all the Race of Birds,' said He,<br> 'None for Religious Purity like Me,<br> Beyond what strictest Rituals prescribe<br> Methinks I am the Saint of all our Tribe,<br> To whom, by Miracle, the Water, that<br> I wash in, also makes my Praying-Mat.'</p>  
 <p>To whom, more angrily than all, replied<br> The Leader, lashing that religious Pride, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">470</font></span><br> That under ritual Obedience<br> To outer Law with inner might dispense:<br> For, fair as all the Feather to be seen,<br> Could one see <i>through</i>, the Maw was not so clean:<br> But He that made both Maw and Feather too<br> Would take account of, seeing through and through.</p>  
 <p>A Shah returning to his Capital,<br> His subjects drest it forth in Festival,<br> Thronging with Acclamation Square and Street,<br> And kneeling flung before his Horse's feet <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">480</font></span><br> Jewel and Gold. All which with scarce an Eye<br> The Sultan superciliously rode by:<br> Till coming to the public Prison, They<br> Who dwelt within those grisly Walls, by way<br> Of Welcome, having neither Pearl nor Gold,<br> Over the wall chopt Head and Carcase roll'd,<br> Some almost parcht to Mummy with the Sun,<br> Some wet with Execution that day done.<br> At which grim Compliment at last the Shah<br> Drew Bridle: and amid a wild Hurrah <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">490</font></span><br> Of savage Recognition, smiling threw<br> Silver and Gold among the wretched Crew,<br> And so rode forward. Whereat of his Train<br> One wondering that, while others sued in vain<br> With costly gifts, which carelessly he pass'd,<br> But smiled at ghastly Welcome like the last;<br> The Shah made answer'All that Pearl and Gold<br> Of ostentatious Welcome only told:<br> A little with great Clamour from the Store<br> Of hypocrites who kept at home much more. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">500</font></span><br> But when those sever'd Heads and Trunks I saw<br> Save by strict Execution of my Law<br> They had not parted company; not one<br> But told my Will not talk'd about, but done.'</p>  
 <p>Then from a Wood was heard unseen to coo<br> The <i>Ring-dove</i>'Yúsuf! Yúsuf! Yúsuf! Yú-'<br> (For thus her sorrow broke her Note in twain,<br> And, just where broken, took it up again)<br> '-suf! Yúsuf! Yúsuf! Yúsuf!'But one Note,<br> Which still repeating, she made hoarse her throat: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">510</font></span></p>  
 <p>Till checkt'O You, who with your idle Sighs<br> Block up the Road of better Enterprise;<br> Sham Sorrow all, or bad as sham if true,<br> When once the better thing is come to do;<br> Beware lest wailing thus you meet his Doom<br> Who all too long his Darling wept, from whom<br> You draw the very Name you hold so dear,<br> And which the World is somewhat tired to hear.'</p>  
 <p>When Yusuf from his Father's Home was torn,<br> The Patriarch's Heart was utterly forlorn, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">520</font></span><br> And, like a Pipe with but one stop, his Tongue<br> With nothing but the name of 'Yusuf' rung.<br> Then down from Heaven's Branches flew the <i>Bird<br> Of Heav'n</i> and said 'God wearies of that word:<br> Hast thou not else to do and else to say?'<br> So Jacob's lips were sealéd from that Day.<br> But one Night in a Vision, far away<br> His darling in some alien Field he saw<br> Binding the Sheaf; and what between the Awe<br> Of God's Displeasure and the bitter Pass <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">530</font></span><br> Of passionate Affection, sigh'd 'Alas'<br> And stopp'dBut with the morning Sword of Flame<br> That oped his Eyes the sterner Angel's came<br> 'For the forbidden Word not utter'd by<br> Thy Lips was yet sequester'd in that Sigh.'<br> And the right Passion whose Excess was wrong<br> Blinded the aged Eyes that wept too long.</p>  
 <p>And after these came othersarguing,<br> Enquiring and excusingsome one Thing,<br> And some anotherendless to repeat, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">540</font></span><br> But, in the Main, Sloth, Folly, or Deceit.<br> Their Souls were to the vulgar Figure cast<br> Of earthly Victual not of Heavenly Fast.<br> At last one smaller Bird, of a rare kind,<br> Of modest Plume and unpresumptuous Mind,<br> Whisper'd 'O Tajidar, we know indeed<br> How Thou both knowest, and would'st help our Need;<br> For thou art wise and holy, and hast been<br> Behind the Veil, and there The Presence seen.<br> But we are weak and vain, with little care <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">550</font></span><br> Beyond our yearly Nests and daily Fare<br> How should we reach the Mountain? and if there<br> How get so great a Prince to hear our Prayer?<br> For there, you say, dwells <i>The Symurgh</i> alone<br> In Glory, like Sulayman on his Throne,<br> And we but Pismires at his feet: can He<br> Such puny Creatures stoop to hear, or see;<br> Or hearing, seeing, own usunakin<br> As He to Folly, Woe, and Death, and Sin?'</p>

 <p>He ceased, and for awhile Amazement quell'd<br> The Host, and in the Chain of Silence held:<br> A Mystery so awful who would dare<br> So glorious who would not wishto share?<br> So Silence brooded on the feather'd Folk, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">630</font></span><br> Till here and there a timid Murmur broke<br> From some too poor in honest Confidence,<br> And then from others of too much Pretence;<br> Whom both, as each unduly hoped or fear'd,<br> The Tajidar in answer check'd or cheer'd.</p>  
 <p>Some said their Hearts were good indeed to go<br> The Way he pointed out: but they were slow<br> Of Comprehension, and scarce understood<br> Their present Evil or the promised Good:<br> And so, tho' willing to do all they could, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">640</font></span><br> Must not they fall short, or go wholly wrong,<br> On such mysterious Errand, and so long?<br> Whom the wise Leader bid but Do their Best<br> In Hope and Faith, and leave to Him the rest,<br> For He who fix'd the Race, and knew its Length<br> And Danger, also knew the Runner's Strength.</p>  
 <p>Shah Mahmud, absent on an Enterprise,<br> Ayas, the very Darling of his eyes,<br> At home under an Evil Eye fell sick,<br> Then cried the Sultan to a soldier 'Quick! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">650</font></span><br> To Horse! to Horse! without a Moment's Stay,<br> The shortest Road with all the Speed you may,<br> Or, by the Lord, your Head shall pay for it!'<br> Off went the Soldier, plying Spur and Bit<br> Over the sandy Desert, over green<br> Valley, and Mountain, and the Stream between,<br> Without a Moment's Stop for rest or bait,<br> Up to the Cityto the Palace Gate<br> Up to the Presence-Chamber at a Stride<br> And Lo! The Sultan at his Darling's side!<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">660</font></span><br> Then thought the Soldier'I have done my Best,<br> And yet shall die for it.' The Sultan guess'd<br> His Thought and smiled. 'Indeed your Best you did,<br> The nearest Road you knew, and well you rid:<br> And if <i>I</i> knew a shorter, my Excess<br> Of Knowledge does but justify thy Less.'</p>  
 <p>And then, with drooping Crest and Feather, came<br> Others, bow'd down with Penitence and Shame.<br> They long'd indeed to go; 'but how begin,<br> Mesh'd and entangled as they were in Sin <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">670</font></span><br> Which often-times Repentance of past Wrong<br> As often broken had but knit more strong?'<br> Whom the wise Leader bid be of good cheer,<br> And, conscious of the Fault, dismiss the Fear,<br> Nor at the very Entrance of the Fray<br> Their Weapon, ev'n if broken, fling away:<br> Since Mercy on the broken Branch anew<br> Would blossom were but each Repentance true.</p>  
 <p>For did not God his Prophet take to Task?<br> 'Sev'n-times of Thee did Karun Pardon ask; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">680</font></span><br> Which, hadst thou been like Me his Makeryea,<br> But present at the Kneading of his Clay<br> With those twain Elements of Hell and Heav'n,<br> One prayer had won what Thou deny'st to Sev'n.'</p>  
 <p>For like a Child sent with a fluttering Light<br> To feel his way along a gusty Night<br> Man walks the World: again and yet again<br> The Lamp shall be by Fits of Passion slain:<br> But shall not He who sent him from the Door<br> Relight the Lamp once more, and yet once more? <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">690</font></span></p>  
 <p>When the rebellious Host from Death shall wake<br> Black with Despair of Judgment, God shall take<br> Ages of holy Merit from the Count<br> Of Angels to make up Man's short Amount,<br> And bid the murmuring Angel gladly spare<br> Of that which, undiminishing his Share,<br> Of Bliss, shall rescue Thousands from the Cost<br> Of Bankruptcy within the Prison lost.</p>  
 <p>Another Story told how in the Scale<br> Good Will beyond mere Knowledge would prevail. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">700</font></span></p>  
 <p>In Paradise the Angel Gabriel heard<br> The Lips of Allah trembling with the Word<br> Of perfect Acceptation: and he thought<br> 'Some perfect Faith such perfect Answer wrought,<br> But whose?'And therewith slipping from the Crypt<br> Of Sidra, through the Angel-ranks he slipt<br> Watching what Lip yet trembled with the Shot<br> That so had hit the Markbut found it not.<br> Then, in a Glance to Earth, he threaded through<br> Mosque, Palace, Cell and Cottage of the True <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">710</font></span><br> Beliefin vain; so back to Heaven went<br> AndAllah's Lips still trembling with assent!<br> Then the tenacious Angel once again<br> Threaded the Ranks of Heav'n and Earthin vain<br> Till, once again return'd to Paradise,<br> There, looking into God's, the Angel's Eyes<br> Beheld the Prayer that brought that Benison<br> Rising like Incense from the Lips of one<br> Who to an Idol bowedas best he knew<br> Under that False God worshipping the True. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">720</font></span></p>  
 <p>And then came others whom the summons found<br> Not wholly sick indeed, but far from sound:<br> Whose light inconstant Soul alternate flew<br> From Saint to Sinner, and to both untrue;<br> Who like a niggard Tailor, tried to match<br> Truth's single Garment with a worldly Patch.<br> A dangerous Game; for, striving to adjust<br> The hesitating Scale of either Lust,<br> That which had least within it upward flew,<br> And still the weightier to the Earth down drew, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">730</font></span><br> And, while suspended between Rise and Fall,<br> Apt with a shaking Hand to forfeit all.</p>  
 <p>There was a Queen of Egypt like the Bride<br> Of Night, Full-moon-faced and Canopus-eyed,<br> Whom one among the meanest of her Crowd<br> Lovedand she knew it (for he loved aloud),<br> And sent for him, and said 'Thou lov'st thy Queen:<br> Now therefore Thou hast this to choose between:<br> Fly for thy Life: or for this one night Wed<br> Thy Queen, and with the Sunrise lose thy Head.' <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">740</font></span><br> He pausedhe turn'd to flyshe struck him dead.<br> 'For had he truly loved his Queen,' said She,<br> 'He would at once have giv'n his Life for me,<br> And Life and Wife had carried: but he lied;<br> And loving only Life, has justly died.'</p>  
 <p>And then came one who having clear'd his Throat<br> With sanctimonious Sweetness in his Note<br> Thus lisp'd'Behold I languish from the first<br> With passionate and unrequited Thirst<br> Of Love for more than any mortal Bird. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">750</font></span><br> Therefore have I withdrawn me from the Herd<br> To pine in Solitude. But Thou at last<br> Hast drawn a line across the dreary Past,<br> And sure I am by Foretaste that the Wine<br> I long'd for, and Thou tell'st of, shall be mine.'</p>  
 <p>But he was sternly checkt. 'I tell thee this:<br> Such Boast is no Assurance of such Bliss:<br> Thou canst not even fill the sail of Prayer<br> Unless from <i>Him</i> breathe that authentic Air<br> That shall lift up the Curtain that divides <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">760</font></span><br> His Lover from the Harim where <i>He</i> hides<br> And the Fulfilment of thy Vows must be,<br> Not from thy Love for Him, but His for Thee.'</p>  
 <p>The third night after Bajazyd had died,<br> One saw him, in a dream, at his Bedside,<br> And said, 'Thou Bajazyd? Tell me O Pyr,<br> How fared it there with Munkar and Nakyr?' <br> And Bajazyd replied, 'When from the Grave<br> They met me rising, and "If Allah's slave"<br> Ask'd me, "or collar'd with the Chain of Hell?" <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">770</font></span><br> I said "Not I but God alone can tell:<br> My Passion for his service were but fond<br> Ambition had not He approved the Bond:<br> Had He not round my neck the Collar thrown<br> And told me in the Number of his own;<br> And that He only knew. What signifies<br> A hundred Years of Prayer if none replies?"'</p>  
 <p>'But,' said Another, 'then shall none the Seal<br> Of Acceptation on his Forehead feel<br> Ere the Grave yield them on the other Side <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">780</font></span><br> Where all is settled?'</p>  
 <p>                      But the Chief replied<br> 'Enough for us to know that who is meet<br> Shall enter, and with unreprovéd Feet,<br> (Ev'n as he might upon the Waters walk)<br> The Presence-room, and in the Presence talk<br> With such unbridled Licence as shall seem<br> To the Uninitiated to blaspheme.'</p>  
 <p>Just as another Holy Spirit fled,<br> The Skies above him burst into a Bed<br> Of Angels looking down and singing clear <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">790</font></span><br> 'Nightingale! Nightingale! thy Rose is here!'<br> And yet, the Door wide open to that Bliss,<br> As some hot Lover slights a scanty Kiss,<br> The Saint cried 'All I sigh'd for come to <i>this</i>?<br> I who lifelong have struggled, Lord, to be<br> Not of thy Angels one, but one with Thee!'</p>  
 <p>Others were sure that all he said was true:<br> They were extremely wicked, that they knew:<br> And much they long'd to go at oncebut some,<br> They said, so unexpectedly had come <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">800</font></span><br> Leaving their Nests half-builtin bad Repair<br> With Children inThemselves about to pair<br> 'Might he not choose a better Seasonnay,<br> Better perhaps a Year or Two's Delay,<br> Till all was settled, and themselves more stout<br> And strong to carry their Repentance out<br> And then'</p>  
 <p>               'And then, the same or like Excuse,<br> With harden'd Heart and Resolution loose<br> With dallying: and old Age itself engaged<br> Still to shirk that which shirking we have aged: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">810</font></span><br> And so with Self-delusion, till, too late,<br> Death upon all Repentance shuts the Gate;<br> Or some fierce blow compels the Way to choose,<br> And forced Repentance half its Virtue lose.'</p>  
 <p>As of an aged Indian King they tell<br> Who, when his Empire with his Army fell<br> Under young Mahmud's Sword of Wrath, was sent<br> At sunset to the Conqueror in his Tent;<br> But, ere the old King's silver head could reach<br> The Ground, was lifted upwith kindly Speech, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">820</font></span><br> And with so holy Mercy reassured,<br> That, after due Persuasion, he abjured<br> His idols, sate upon Mahmud's Divan,<br> And took the Name and Faith of Musulman.<br> But when the Night fell, in his Tent alone<br> The poor old King was heard to weep and groan<br> And smite his Bosom; which, when Mahmud knew,<br> He went to him and said 'Lo, if Thou rue<br> Thy lost Dominion, Thou shalt wear the Ring<br> Of thrice as large a Realm.' But the dark King <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">830</font></span><br> Still wept, and Ashes on his Forehead threw<br> And cried 'Not for my Kingdom lost I rue:<br> But thinking how at the Last Day, will stand<br> <i>The</i> Prophet with <i>The Volume</i> in his Hand,<br> And ask of me "How was't that, in thy Day<br> Of Glory, Thou didst turn from Me and slay<br> My People; but soon as thy Infidel<br> Before my True Believers' Army fell<br> Like Corn before the Reaperthou didst own<br> His Sword who scoutedst <i>Me</i>." Of seed so sown <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">840</font></span><br> What profitable Harvest should be grown?'</p>  
 <p>Then after cheering others who delay'd,<br> Not of the Road but of Themselves afraid,<br> The Tajidar the Troop of those address'd,<br> Whose uncomplying Attitude confess'd<br> Their Souls entangled in the old Deceit,<br> And hankering still after forbidden Meat<br>     'O ye who so long feeding on the Husk<br> Forgo the Fruit, and doting on the Dusk<br> Of the false Dawn, are blinded to the True: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">850</font></span><br> That in the Maidan of this World pursue<br> The Golden Ball which, driven to the Goal,<br> Wins the World's Game but loses your own Soul:<br> Or like to Children after Bubbles run<br> That still elude your Fingers; or, if won,<br> Burst in Derision at your Touch; all thin<br> Glitter without, and empty Wind within.<br> So as a prosperous Worldling on the Bed<br> Of Death"Behold, I am as one," he said,<br> "Who all my Life long have been measuring Wind, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">860</font></span><br> And, dying, now leave even that behind"<br> This World's a Nest in which the Cockatrice<br> Is warm'd and hatcht of Vanity and Vice:<br> A false Bazaar whose Wares are all a lie,<br> Or never worth the Price at which you buy:<br> A many-headed Monster that, supplied<br> The faster, faster is unsatisfied;<br> So as one, hearing a rich Fool one day<br> To God for yet one other Blessing pray,<br> Bid him no longer bounteous Heaven tire <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">870</font></span><br> For Life to feed, but Death to quench, the Fire.<br> And what are all the Vanities and Wiles<br> In which the false World decks herself and smiles<br> To draw Men down into her harlot Lap?<br> Lusts of the Flesh that Soul and Body sap,<br> And, melting Soul down into carnal Lust,<br> Ev'n that for which 'tis sacrificed disgust:<br> Or Lust of worldly Gloryhollow more<br> Than the Drum beaten at the Sultan's Door,<br> And fluctuating with the Breath of Man <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">880</font></span><br> As the Vain Banner flapping in the Van.<br> And Lust of Goldperhaps of Lusts the worst;<br> The mis-created Idol most accurst<br> That between Man and Him who made him stands:<br> The Felon that with suicidal hands<br> He sweats to dig and rescue from his Grave,<br> And sets at large to make Himself its Slave.</p>

 <p>For ev'n as Yusuf (when his Brotherhood<br> Came up from Egypt to buy Corn, and stood<br> Before their Brother in his lofty Place, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">990</font></span><br> Nor knew him, for a Veil before his Face)<br> Struck on his Mystic Cup, which straightway then<br> Rung out their Story to those guilty Ten:<br> Not to <i>them</i> only, but to every one;<br> Whatever he have said and thought and done,<br> Unburied with the Body shall fly up,<br> And gather into Heav'n's inverted Cup,<br> Which, stricken by God's Finger, shall tell all<br> The Story whereby we must stand or fall.<br> And though we walk this World as if behind <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1000</font></span><br> There were no Judgement, or the Judge half-blind,<br> Beware, for He with whom we have to do<br> Outsees the Lynx, outlives the Phoenix too</p>  
 <p>So Sultan Mahmud, coming Face to Face<br> With mightier numbrs of the swarthy Race,<br> Vow'd that if God to him the battle gave,<br> God's Dervish People all the Spoil should have.<br> And God the Battle gave him; and the Fruit<br> Of a great Conquest coming to compute,<br> A Murmur through the Sultan's Army stirr'd <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1010</font></span><br> Lest, ill committed to one hasty Word,<br> The Shah should squander on an idle Brood<br> What should be theirs who earn'd it with their Blood,<br> Or go to fill the Coffers of the State.<br> So Mahmud's Soul began to hesitate:<br> Till looking round in Doubt from side to side<br> A raving Zealot in the Press he spied,<br> And call'd and had him brought before his Face,<br> And, telling, bid him arbitrate the case.<br> Who, having listen'd, said'The Thing is plain: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1020</font></span><br> If Thou and God should never have again<br> To deal together, rob him of his share:<br> But if perchance you shouldwhy then Beware!'</p>  
 <p>So spake the Tajidar: but Fear and Doubt<br> Among the Birds in Whispers went about:<br> Great was their Need: and Succour to be sought<br> At any Risk: at any Ransom bought:<br> But such a Monarchgreater than Mahmud<br> The Great Himself! Why how should he be woo'd<br> To listen to them? they too have come <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1030</font></span><br> O So suddenly, and unprepared from home<br> With any Gold, or Jewel, or rich Thing<br> To carry with them to so great a King<br> Poor Creatures! with the old and carnal Blind,<br> Spite of all said, so thick upon the Mind,<br> Devising how they might ingratiate<br> Access, as to some earthly Potentate.</p>  
 <p>'Let him that with this Monarch would engage<br> Bring the Gold Dust of a long Pilgrimage:<br> The Ruby of a bleeding Heart, whose Sighs <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1040</font></span><br> Breathe more than Amber-incense as it dies;<br> And while in naked Beggary he stands<br> Hope for the Robe of Honour from his Hands.'<br> And, as no gift this Sovereign receives<br> Save the mere Soul and Self of him who gives,<br> So let that Soul for other none Reward<br> Look than the Presence of its Sovereign Lord.'<br> And as his Hearers seem'd to estimate<br> Their Scale of Glory from Mahmud the Great,<br> A simple Story of the Sultan told <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1050</font></span><br> How best a subject with his Shah made bold</p>  
 <p>One night Shah Mahmud who had been of late<br> Somewhat distemper'd with Affairs of State<br> Stroll'd through the Streets disguised, as wont to do<br> And, coming to the Baths, there on the Flue<br> Saw the poor Fellow who the Furnace fed<br> Sitting beside his Water-jug and Bread.<br> Mahmud stept insat downunask'd took up<br> And tasted of the untasted Loaf and Cup,<br> Saying within himself, 'Grudge but a bit, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1060</font></span><br> And, by the Lord, your Head shall pay for it!'<br> So having rested, warm'd and satisfied<br> Himself without a Word on either side,<br> At last the wayward Sultan rose to go.<br> And then at last his Host broke silence'So?<br> Art satisfied? Well, Brother, any Day<br> Or Night, remember, when you come this Way<br> And want a bit of Provenderwhy, you<br> Are welcome, and if notwhy, welcome too.'<br> The Sultan was so tickled with the whim <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1070</font></span><br> Of this quaint Entertainment and of him<br> Who offer'd it, that many a Night again<br> Stoker and Shah forgather'd in that Vein<br> Till, the poor Fellow having stood the Test<br> Of true Good-fellowship, Mahmud confess'd<br> One Night the Sultan that had been his Guest:<br> And in requital of the scanty Dole<br> The Poor Man offer'd with so large a soul,<br> Bid him ask any Largess that he would<br> A Throneif he <i>would</i> have it, so he <i>should</i>. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1080</font></span><br> The Poor Man kiss'd the Dust, and 'All,' said he,<br> 'I ask is what and where I am to be;<br> If but the Shah from time to time will come<br> As now and see me in the lowly Home<br> His presence makes a palace, and my own<br> Poor Flue more royal than another's Throne.'</p>  
 <p>So said the cheery Tale: and, as they heard,<br> Again the Heart beneath the Feather stirr'd:<br> Again forgot the Danger and the Woes<br> Of the long Travel in its glorious Close:<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1090</font></span><br> 'Here truly all was Poverty, Despair<br> And miserable Banishmentbut there<br> That more than Mahmud, for no more than Prayer<br> Who would restore them to their ancient Place,<br> And round their Shoulders fling his Robe of Grace.'<br> They clapp'd their Wings, on Fire to be assay'd<br> And prove of what true Metal they were made,<br> Although defaced, and wanting the true Ring<br> And Superscription of their rightful King.</p>  
 <p>'The Road! The Road!' in countless voices cried <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1100</font></span><br> The Host'The Road! and who shall be our Guide?'<br> And they themselves 'The Tajidar!' replied:<br> Yet to make doubly certain that the Voice<br> Of Heav'n according with the People's Choice,<br> Lots should be drawn; and He on whom should light<br> Heav'n's Handthey swore to follow him outright.<br> This settled, and once more the Hubbub quell'd,<br> Once more Suspense the Host in Silence held,<br> While, Tribe by Tribe, the Birds their fortune drew;<br> And Lo! upon the Tajidar it flew. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1110</font></span><br> Then rising up again in wide and high<br> Circumference of wings that mesh'd the sky<br> 'The Tajidar! The Tajidar!' they cry<br> 'The Tajidar! The Tajidar!' with Him<br> Was Heav'n, and They would follow Life and Limb!<br> Then, once more fluttering to their Places down,<br> Upon his Head they set the Royal Crown<br> As Khalif of their Khalif so long lost,<br> And Captain of his now repentant Host;<br> And setting him on high, and Silence call'd, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1120</font></span><br> The Tajidar, in Pulpit-throne install'd,<br> His Voice into a Trumpet-tongue so clear<br> As all the winged Multitude should hear<br> Raised, to proclaim the Order and Array<br> Of March; which, many as it frighten'dyea,<br> The Heart of Multitudes at outset broke,<br> Yet for due Preparation must be spoke.</p>  
 <p>A Road indeed that never Wing before<br> Flew, nor Foot trod, nor Heart imaginedo'er<br> Waterless DesertsWaters where no Shore<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1130</font></span><br> Valleys comprising cloud-high Mountains: these<br> Again their Valleys deeper than the Seas:<br> Whose Dust all Adders, and whose vapour Fire:<br> Where all once hostile Elements conspire<br> To set the Soul against herself, and tear<br> Courage to TerrorHope into Despair,<br> And Madness; Terrors, Trials, to make stray<br> Or Stop where Death to wander or delay:<br> Where when half dead with Famine, Toil, and Heat,<br> 'Twas Death indeed to rest, or drink, or eat. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1140</font></span><br> A Road still waxing in Self-sacrifice<br> As it went on: still ringing with the Cries<br> And Groans of Those who had not yet prevail'd,<br> And bleaching with the Bones of those who fail'd:<br> Where, almost all withstood, perhaps to earn<br> Nothing: and, earning, never to return.<br> And first the <i>VALE OF SEARCH:</i> an endless Maze,<br> Branching into innumerable Ways<br> All courting Entrance: but one right: and this<br> Beset with Pitfall, Gulf, and Precipice, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1150</font></span><br> Where Dust is Embers, Air a fiery Sleet,<br> Through which with blinded Eyes and bleeding Feet<br> The Pilgrim stumbles, with Hyena's Howl<br> Around, and hissing Snake, and deadly Ghoul,<br> Whose Prey he falls if tempted but to droop,<br> Or if to wander famish'd from the Troop<br> For fruit that falls to ashes in the Hand,<br> Water that reacht recedes into the Sand.<br> The only word is 'Forward!' Guide in sight,<br> After him, swerving neither left nor right, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1160</font></span><br> Thyself for thine own Victual by Day,<br> At night thine own Self's Caravanserai.<br> Till suddenly, perhaps when most subdued<br> And desperate, the Heart shall be renew'd<br> When deep in utter Darkness, by one Gleam<br> Of Glory from the far remote <i>Harim</i>,<br> That, with a scarcely conscious Shock of Change,<br> Shall light the Pilgrim toward the Mountain Range<br> Of KNOWLEDGE: where, if stronger and more pure<br> The Light and Air, yet harder to endure; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1170</font></span><br> And if, perhaps, the Footing more secure,<br> Harder to keep up with a nimble Guide,<br> Less from lost Road than insufficient Stride<br> Yet tempted still by false Shows from the Track,<br> And by false Voices call'd aside or back,<br> Which echo from the Bosom, as if won<br> The Journey's End when only just begun,<br> And not a Mountain Peak with Toil attain'd<br> But shows a top yet higher to be gain'd.<br> Wherefore still Forward, Forward! Love that fired <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1180</font></span><br> Thee first to search, by Search so re-inspired<br> As that the Spirit shall the carnal Load<br> Burn up, and double wing Thee on the Road;<br> That wert thou knocking at the very Door<br> Of Heav'n, thou still would'st cry for More, More, More!</p>  
 <p>Till loom in sight Kaf's Mountain Peak ashroud<br> In Mistuncertain yet Mountain or Cloud,<br> But where the Pilgrim 'gins to hear the Tide<br> Of that one Sea in which the Sev'n subside;<br> And not the Sev'n Seas only: but the sev'n <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1190</font></span><br> And self-enfolded Spheres of Earth and Heav'n<br> Yea, the Two Worlds, that now as Pictures sleep<br> Upon its Surfacebut when once the Deep<br> From its long Slumber 'gins to heave and sway<br> Under the Tempest shall be swept away<br> With all their Phases and Phenomena:<br> Not senseless Matter only, but combined<br> With Life in all Varieties of Kind;<br> Yea, ev'n the abstract Forms that Space and Time<br> Men call, and Weal and Woe, Virtue and Crime, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1200</font></span><br> And all the several Creeds like those who fell<br> Before them, Musulman and Infidel<br> Shall from the Face of Being melt away,<br> Cancell'd and swept as Dreams before the Day.<br> So hast thou seen the Astrologer prepare<br> His mystic Table smooth of sand, and there<br> Inscribe his mystic figures, Square, and Trine,<br> Circle and Pentagram, and heavenly Sign<br> Of Star and Planet: from whose Set and Rise,<br> Meeting and Difference, he prophesies; <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1210</font></span><br> And, having done it, with his Finger clean<br> Obliterates as never they had been.</p>  
 <p>Such is when reacht the Table Land of One<br> And <i>Wonder:</i> blazing with so fierce a Sun<br> Of Unity that blinds while it reveals<br> The Universe that to a Point congeals,<br> So, stunn'd with utter Revelation, reels<br> The Pilgrim, when that <i>Double</i>-seeming House,<br> Against whose Beams he long had chafed his Brows,<br> Crumbles and cracks before that Sea, whose near <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1220</font></span><br> And nearer Voice now overwhelms his Ear.<br> Till blinded, deafen'd, madden'd, drunk with doubt<br> Of all within Himself as all without,<br> Nay, whether a <i>Without</i> there be, or not,<br> Or a <i>Within</i> that doubts: and if, then what?<br> Ev'n so shall the bewilder'd Pilgrim seem<br> When nearest waking deepliest in Dream,<br> And darkest next to Dawn; and lost what had<br> When <i>All</i> is found: and just when sane quite Mad<br> As one that having found the Key once more <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1230</font></span><br> Returns, and Lo! he cannot find the Door<br> He stumbles overSo the Pilgrim stands<br> A moment on the Thresholdwith raised Hands<br> Calls to the eternal Saki for one Draught<br> Of Light from the One Essence: which when quaff'd,<br> He plunges headlong in: and all is well<br> With him who never more returns to tell.<br> Such being then the Race and such the Goal,<br> Judge if you must not Body both and Soul<br> With Meditation, Watch and Fast prepare. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1240</font></span><br> For he that wastes his body to a Hair<br> Shall seize the Locks of Truth: and He that prays<br> Good Angels in their Ministry waylays:<br> And the Midnightly Watcher in the Folds<br> Of his own Darkness God Almighty holds.<br> He that would prosper here must from him strip<br> The World, and take the Dervish Gown and Scrip:<br> And as he goes must gather from all Sides<br> Irrelevant Ambitions, Lusts and Prides,<br> Glory and Gold, and sensual Desire, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1250</font></span><br> Whereof to build the fundamental Pyre<br> Of Self-annihilation: and cast in<br> All old Relations and Regards of Kin<br> And Country: and, the Pile with this perplext<br> World platform'd, from the Fables of the Next<br> Raise it tow'rd Culmination, with the torn<br> Rags and Integuments of Creeds out-worn;<br> And top the giddy Summit with the Scroll<br> Of <i>Reason</i> that in dingy Smoke shall roll<br> Over the true Self-sacrifice of Soul: <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1260</font></span><br> (For such a Prayer was his'O God, do Thou<br> With all my Wealth in the other World endow<br> My Friends: and with my Wealth in <i>this</i> my Foes,<br> Till bankrupt in <i>thy</i> Riches I repose!')<br> Then, all the Pile completed of the Pelf<br> Of either Worldat last throw on <i>Thyself</i>,<br> And with the torch of Self-negation fire;<br> And ever as the Flames rise high and higher,<br> With Cries of agonising Glory still<br> All of that <i>Self</i> burn up that burn up will, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1270</font></span><br> Leaving the Phoenix that no Fire can slay<br> To spring from its own Ashes kindlednay,<br> Itself an inextinguishable Spark<br> Of Being, <i>now</i> beneath Earth-ashes dark,<br> Transcending these, at last <i>Itself</i> transcends<br> And with the One Eternal Essence blends.</p>  
 <p>The Moths had long been exiled from the Flame<br> They worship: so to solemn Council came,<br> And voted <i>One</i> of them by Lot be sent<br> To find their Idol. One was chosen: went. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1280</font></span><br> And after a long Circuit in sheer Gloom,<br> Seeing, he thought, the TAPER in a Room<br> Flew back at once to say so. But the chief<br> Of <i>Mothistan</i> slighted so slight Belief,<br> And sent another Messenger, who flew<br> Up to the House, in at the window, through<br> The Flame itself; and back the Message brings,<br> With yet no sign of Conflict on his wings.<br> Then went a Third, and spurr'd with true Desire,<br> Plunging at once into the sacred Fire, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1290</font></span><br> Folded his Wings within, till he became<br> One Colour and one Substance with the Flame.<br> He only knew the Flame who in it burn'd;<br> And only He could tell who ne'er to tell return'd.</p>  
 <p>After declaring what of this declared<br> Must be, that all who went should be prepared,<br> From his high Station ceased the Tajidar<br> And lo! the Terrors that, when told afar,<br> Seem'd but as Shadows of a Noonday Sun,<br> Now that the talkt-of Thing was to be <i>done</i>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1300</font></span><br> Lengthening into those of closing Day<br> Strode into utter Darkness: and Dismay<br> Like Night on the husht Sea of Feathers lay,<br> Late so elate'So terrible a Track!<br> Endlessor, ending, never to come back!<br> Never to Country, Family, or Friend!'<br> In sooth no easy Bow for Birds to bend!<br> Even while he spoke, how many Wings and Crests<br> Had slunk away to distant Woods and Nests;<br> Others again in Preparation spent <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1310</font></span><br> What little Strength they had, and never went:<br> And others, after preparation due<br> When up the Veil of that first Valley drew<br> From whose waste Wilderness of Darkness blew<br> A Sarsar, whether edged of Flames or Snows,<br> That through from Root to Tip their Feathers froze<br> Up went a Multitude that overhead<br> A moment darken'd, then on all sides fled,<br> Dwindling the World-assembled Caravan<br> To less than half the Number that began. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1320</font></span><br> Of those who fled not, some in Dread and Doubt<br> Sat without stirring: others who set out<br> With frothy Force, or stupidly resign'd,<br> Before a League, flew off or fell behind.<br> And howsoever the more Brave and Strong<br> In Courage, Wing, or Wisdom push'd along,<br> Yet League by League the Road was thicklier spread<br> By the fast falling Foliage of the Dead:<br> Some spent with Travel over Wave and Ground;<br> Scorcht, frozen, dead for Drought, or drinking drown'd. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1330</font></span><br> Famisht, or poison'd with the Food when found:<br> By Weariness, or Hunger, or Affright<br> Seduced to stop or stray, become the Bite<br> Of Tiger howling round or hissing Snake,<br> Or Crocodile that eyed them from the Lake:<br> Or raving Mad, or in despair Self-slain:<br> Or slaying one another for a Grain:</p>  
 <p>Till of the mighty Host that fledged the Dome<br> Of Heav'n and Floor of Earth on leaving Home,<br> A Handful reach'd and scrambled up the Knees <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1340</font></span><br> Of Kaf whose Feet dip in the Seven Seas;<br> And of the few that up his Forest-sides<br> Of Light and Darkness where <i>The Presence</i> hides,<br> But <i>Thirty</i>thirty desperate draggled Things,<br> Half-dead, with scarce a Feather on their Wings,<br> Stunn'd, blinded, deafen'd with the Crash and Craze<br> Of Rock and Sea collapsing in a Blaze<br> That struck the Sun to Cinderfell upon<br> The Threshold of the Everlasting <i>One</i>,<br> With but enough of Life in each to cry, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1350</font></span><br> On THAT which all absorb'd<br>                                   And suddenly<br> Forth flash'd a winged Harbinger of Flame<br> And Tongue of Fire, and 'Who?' and 'Whence they came?'<br> And 'Why?' demanded. And the Tajidar<br> For all the Thirty answer'd him'We are<br> Those Fractions of the Sum of Being, far<br> Dis-spent and foul disfigured, that once more<br> Strike for Admission at the Treasury Door.'<br> To whom the Angel answer'd'Know ye not<br> That He you seek recks little who or what <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1360</font></span><br> Of Quantity and Kindhimself the Fount<br> Of Being Universal needs no Count<br> Of all the Drops o'erflowing from his Urn,<br> In what Degree they issue or return?'</p>  
 <p>Then cried the Spokesman, 'Be it even so:<br> Let us but see the Fount from which we flow,<br> 'And, seeing, lose Ourselves therein!' and, Lo!<br> Before the Word was utter'd, or the Tongue<br> Of Fire replied, or Portal open flung.<br> They were <i>within</i>they were before the <i>Throne</i>, <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1370</font></span><br> Before the Majesty that sat thereon,<br> But wrapt in so insufferable a Blaze<br> Of Glory as beat down their baffled Gaze.<br> Which, downward dropping, fell upon a Scroll<br> That, Lightning-like, flash'd back on each the whole<br> Past half-forgotten Story of his Soul:<br> Like that which Yusuf in his Glory gave<br> His Brethren as some Writing he would have<br> Interpreted; and at a Glance, behold<br> Their own Indenture for their Brother sold! <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1380</font></span><br> And so with these poor Thirty: who, abasht<br> In Memory all laid bare and Conscience lasht,<br> By full Confession and Self-loathing flung<br> The Rags of carnal Self that round them clung;<br> And, their old selves self-knowledged and self-loathed,<br> And in the Soul's Integrity re-clothed,<br> Once more they ventured from the Dust to raise<br> Their Eyesup to the Throneinto the Blaze,<br> And in the Centre of the Glory there<br> Beheld the Figure of<i>Themselves</i>as 'twere <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1390</font></span><br> Transfiguredlooking to Themselves, beheld<br> The Figure on the Throne en-miracled,<br> Until their Eyes themselves and That between<br> Did hesitate which <i>Sëer</i> was, which <i>Seen</i>;<br> They That, That They: Another, yet the Same:<br> Dividual, yet One: from whom there came<br> A Voice of awful Answer, scarce discern'd<br> From <i>which</i> to Aspiration <i>whose</i> return'd<br> They scarcely knew; as when some Man apart<br> Answers aloud the Question in his Heart<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1400</font></span><br> 'The Sun of my Perfection is a Glass<br> Wherein from <i>Seeing</i> into <i>Being</i> pass<br> All who, reflecting as reflected see<br> Themselves in Me, and Me in Them: not Me,<br> But all of Me that a contracted Eye<br> Is comprehensive of Infinity:<br> Nor yet <i>Themselves</i>: no Selves, but of The All<br> Fractions, from which they split and whither fall.<br> As Water lifted from the Deep, again<br> Falls back in individual Drops of Rain <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1410</font></span><br> Then melts into the Universal Main.<br> All you have been, and seen, and done, and thought,<br> Not <i>You</i> but <i>I</i>, have seen and been and wrought:<br> I was the Sin that from Myself rebell'd:<br> I the Remorse that tow'rd Myself compell'd:<br> I was the Tajidar who led the Track:<br> I was the little Briar that pull'd you back:<br> Sin and ContritionRetribution owed,<br> And cancell'dPilgrim, Pilgrimage, and Road,<br> Was but Myself toward Myself: and Your <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1420</font></span><br> Arrival but <i>Myself</i> at my own Door:<br> Who in your Fraction of Myself behold<br> Myself within the Mirror Myself hold<br> To see Myself in, and each part of Me<br> That sees himself, though drown'd, shall ever see.<br> Come you lost Atoms to your Centre draw,<br> And <i>be</i> the Eternal Mirror that you saw:<br> Rays that have wander'd into Darkness wide<br> Return, and back into your Sun subside.'</p>  
 <p>This was the Parliament of Birds: and this <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1430</font></span><br> The Story of the Host who went amiss,<br> And of the Few that better Upshot found;<br> Which being now recounted, Lo, the Ground<br> Of Speech fails underfoot: But this to tell<br> Their Road is thineFollowand Fare thee well. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">1435</font></span></p>
