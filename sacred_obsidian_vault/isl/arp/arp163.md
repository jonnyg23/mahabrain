 <p>[On comparing the following translation of the famous poem of Et-Tugrā‘ī, which Mr. Redhouse has obligingly made for this volume, with Dr. Carlyle's rendering (pp. <a href="arp079.htm#page_153">153</a>-<a href="arp079.htm#page_161">161</a>), it will be observed that, in a few instances, the true meaning of the original is lost in the metrical version. Some particulars regarding the author, &amp;c., are given in pp. <a href="arp159.htm#page_433">433</a>-<a href="arp159.htm#page_435">435</a>.]</p>  
 <p>FIRM-ROOTEDNESS of view has protected me from precipitancy; and the ornament of excellence has embellished me when void of trinkets.</p>  
 <p>2. My honour at the last, and my honour at the first, are equal; for the sun that inclines towards a fair altitude in the morning resembles the sun in its decline.</p>  
 <p>3. In what might consist a residence in Bagdad?—I have no home therein; I have neither she nor he-camel there.</p>  
 <p>4. Distant from my friends; empty-handed; isolated: I still am as a sword-blade, the two flat sides of which are bare of sheath-coverings.</p>  
 <p>5. There is no sincere friend unto whom to make plaint of my sorrow; nor a companion unto whom my joy may be communicated.</p>  
 <p>6. My absence from home has grown long; so that my saddle-camel has moaned, and her saddle, and the heel of my limber spear.</p>  
 <p>7. My famished beast has shrieked from fatigue, and has groaned for what my saddle-beasts have thrown off; and the riders have been contentious in blame of me.</p>  
 <p>8. I wish for the open hand of wealth, that I may have its help to pay off debts that I owe, as a point of exalted feeling.</p>  
 <p>9. But Fortune inverts my wishes, and makes me contented with a return home, instead of riches following on earnest endeavour.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_469"><font size="1" color="green">p. 469</font></a></p>  
 <p>10. And then, that well-proportioned man, like the upper part of a spear, holding his like between his leg and his saddle: not pusillanimous, and not depending on another;</p>  
 <p>11. Pleasant in his jesting; bitter in his earnest; in the firmness of whose valour there is mixed the tenderness of amatory converse;</p>  
 <p>12. From the watering-places of whose eyeballs I had driven away the flocks of drowsiness, though the night incited the herds of sleep to men's eyeballs;</p>  
 <p>13. The riders being inclined over their saddles, through heaviness, [some] coming to themselves, and others fuddled with the wine of drowsiness.</p>  
 <p>14. Then I said: “Shall I call thee to a momentous event, that thou mayest succour me, and wilt thou refuse me in the great misfortune?</p>  
 <p>15. “Dost thou sleep, leaving me, while the eye of the Pleiades is sleepless? And dost thou turn away from me, when the dye of night turns not?</p>  
 <p>16. “Then wilt thou help me in a folly I have taken into my head? (for at times folly scares away from cowardice).</p>  
 <p>17. “Verily I wish to visit the tribe by night at Idzam; whereas the archers of the tribe from Thu‘al have already shielded it:</p>  
 <p>18. “They shield therein, with bright swords and brown pliant lances, [maidens] with black tresses, yellow trinkets [of gold], and crimson vestments [of silk].</p>  
 <p>19. “Then march with us under the safeguard of the night, at random; for a fragrant puff shall guide us to their dwelling-places.</p>  
 <p>20. “For the beloved one is where the enemies and the lions are crouched down around the lairs of the antelopes, the thickets of which are shafts of spears.</p>  
 <p>21. “We are bound towards a growing damsel in the bend of the valley, the spear-heads of whose eyelashes have been tempered with the waters of coquetry and of the darkness of her eyelid borders.</p>  
 <p>22. “The commendatory conversations of generous men have</p>  
 <p><a name="page_470"><font size="1" color="green">p. 470</font></a></p>  
 <p>already multiplied concerning her, as to the noble qualities [in a woman] of cowardice and avarice.</p>  
 <p>23. “The fire of love rises by night in feverish hearts [livers], through their women; and that of hospitality, on the hill-tops, through their men.</p>  
 <p>24. “Their women slay the emaciated of their lovers, who struggle not; the men slaughter noble steeds and camels [as food for guests].</p>  
 <p>25. “Those stung with their spears are cured in their tents with a draught of the pond of wine and of honey [of the lips of their maidens].</p>  
 <p>26. “Perhaps a second visit to that bend of the valley [see v. 21] will cause to creep along a breath of cure for my ills.</p>  
 <p>27. “I do not dislike the gaping spear-thrust, when paired with a shot from the arrows of wide eyes.</p>  
 <p>28. “Neither do I fear the glancing blades [eyes] that help me to flashes from the interstices of blinds and curtains;</p>  
 <p>29. “Neither do I part with does [women] with whom I hold tender converse, even though lions of the thickets menace me with evil.</p>  
 <p>30. “The love of safety turns the effort of its possessor from high objects, and incites man to sloth.</p>  
 <p>31. “Therefore, if thou incline to it, then take thou to thyself a burrow in the earth, or a ladder to the atmosphere, and isolate thyself;</p>  
 <p>32. “And leave the broad ocean of ambition to those who dare ride thereon; contenting thee with some slight moisture.</p>  
 <p>33. “The contentment of the lowly, with a sorry livelihood, is abjectness; the glory of docile she-camels is in their most accelerated pace.</p>  
 <p>34. “Drive thou them, then, at a swift pace, into the very throats of the deserts; they emulating with their nose-bands the doubled bits [of horses].”</p>  
 <p>35. Verily, all grave matters have given me to understand that glory resides in migrations [and they speak truly in that respect].</p>  
 <p><a name="page_471"><font size="1" color="green">p. 471</font></a></p>  
 <p>36. If in the glory of a repair there were an attainment of desire, the sun would never move from the sign of Aries [his house of exaltation].</p>  
 <p>37. I would cry out to Fortune, were I in company of a listener; but Fortune is occupied in [other] matters, and ignores me.</p>  
 <p>38. It may be that, if my superiority and the defectuosity of those [others] should appear to its eye, it would sleep in respect of them, or would awake in respect of me.</p>  
 <p>39. I amuse my soul with desires which I entertain. How narrow is life, were it not for the expansion of desire!</p>  
 <p>40. I was not pleased with my livelihood when the days were fortunate. How, then, can I be satisfied, when they are retrograding in haste?</p>  
 <p>41. My knowledge has risen in my own estimation to a degree of preciousness in value; therefore have I protected it from the cheap rate of an every-day commodity.</p>  
 <p>42. It is a customary thing in a sword to be [esteemed] beautiful through its damaskeening; but it will not act, save in the hands of a hero. [I am such a sword-blade, with my knowledge; but, to show this, I must be used.]</p>  
 <p>43. I should not have chosen that my time should be lengthened unto me, until I should see the prosperity of ragamuffins and the vile.</p>  
 <p>44. People have, however, got before me whose run was behind my paces when I walked with leisure.</p>  
 <p>45. This is the reward of the man whose fellows have passed away before him, and who still has craved a long respite of his doom.</p>  
 <p>46. And if they who are inferior to me have risen above me, no wonder!—I have a precedent in the lower position of the sun than that of Saturn [in the Ptolemaic system of the spheres].</p>  
 <p>47. Then be patient therewith, without hatching stratagems or feeling vexed. In the forthcoming event of time there is that which will make thee independent of stratagems.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_472"><font size="1" color="green">p. 472</font></a></p>  
 <p>48. Thy most virulent enemy is the nearest of those to whom thou hast trusted. Then beware of men, and associate with them upon [terms of] distrust.</p>  
 <p>49. For verily the lord of the world, and the unique one thereof, is he who leans not for support upon any man in the world.</p>  
 <p>50. And thy good opinion of the days is a weakness; then, hold a bad opinion, and be in fear of them.</p>  
 <p>51. Honesty has sunk into the earth, and dishonesty has spread abroad; while between word and action an interval as wide as perjury has opened out.</p>  
 <p>52. Thy truthfulness hath the falsehood of mankind shamed with men; for can the crooked be fitted to the straight?</p>  
 <p>53. If there were anything useful in their firm adherence to their promises, the sword would outrun the chider.</p>  
 <p>54. O thou, who comest to drink of the remnant of a life, the whole of which is turbid!—thou hast expended thy clear and pure water in thy pristine days.</p>  
 <p>55. Wherefore inconsiderately rushest thou into the depth of the sea on which thou ridest, whereas one sip of a trickling spring would suffice thee?</p>  
 <p>56. The possession of contentment is not feared for; neither therein is want felt for auxiliaries or for attendants.</p>  
 <p>57. Dost thou seek for permanency in an abode that has no durability? Hast thou ever heard of a shadow that did not pass away?</p>  
 <p>58. And, O thou who art aware of the secrets informed thereof! be silent!—for in silence is there an escape from mistakes.</p>  
 <p>59. They have fostered thee for a matter which, if thou hast comprehended it, should make thee beware of pasturing among the loose cattle.</p>
