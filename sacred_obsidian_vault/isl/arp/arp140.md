 <p>BEATRICE [Su'ād] hath departed. Therefore was my heart that day distracted, raving after her, irredeemably enchained.</p>  
 <p>2. On the morrow of our separation, when she went forth, Beatrice was no other than a bleating antelope, with downcast glance, and eyes set off with collyrium.</p>  
 <p>3. When she smiles, she displays [a row of] teeth of glancing whiteness, as though it had been a damaskeened sword-blade, once tempered, and then dipped a second time in wine,</p>  
 <p>4. Dashed, on a cold day, with water from a meandering stream, clear, and flowing in a wide, pebbly channel, fanned by a north wind when the day is high;</p>  
 <p>5. From which the winds banish all sticks and straws, and on which the silvery bubbles raised by a morning rain appear in great numbers.</p>  
 <p>6. God bless her mother! for the darling she would have been, had she kept true to her promise, and if advice had been acceptable [to her]!</p>  
 <p>7. But she is a darling, in the very blood of whom are blended pain, anxiety, disappointment, and change!</p>  
 <p>8. She remains not constant to any state she may have assumed, even as the demon of the wilds varies in its costume!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="green">p. 313</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. She does not hold to any promise she has spoken, save as sieves hold water!</p>  
 <p>10. [The proverbial expression,] "the promises of ’Urqūb" is [as it were] a parable concerning her; and his promises were naught but lies!</p>  
 <p>11. I wish and desire that they would become present in an eternity: but what ails them, then? I feel the whole duration of time an impatience!</p>  
 <p>12. Let not, then, that deceive thee which she has bestowed, or which she has promised. Verily, desires and dreams are a delusion!</p>  
 <p>13. Beatrice is to-day in a land where naught can enable one to reach her, save the noble, generous, free-going she-camels.</p>  
 <p>14. And certainly nothing could carry one to her, save a huge and dauntless she-camel, possessed, against fatigue, of speed and endurance;</p>  
 <p>15. Of those which drench the roots of their ears when they sweat; whose unknown energy blurs all the road-marks;</p>  
 <p>16. Who looks at the highlands with the eyes of an isolated white addax, when the rocky flats and sand-hills are [as it were] on fire;</p>  
 <p>17. Whose neck is thick where her collar sits; whose pastern is plump; in whose build there is a superiority over the daughters of the stallion-camel;</p>  
 <p>18. Large-headed, large-jawed, strongly formed; in whose side is capaciousness; whose neck is an obelisk;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="green">p. 314</font></a></p>  
 <p>19. Whose hide is that of a sea-turtle, on which tikes, slim in the loins and meagre, can make no impression;—</p>  
 <p>20. A graceful creature; whose brother is her father out of a full-blooded dam, and whose paternal uncle is also her maternal uncle; who is long in the back, and agile;</p>  
 <p>21. Upon whom the tikes crawl; which are then dropped off by a chest and by flanks that are sleek;—</p>  
 <p>22. A very wild-ass; who, from plumpness, might be accused of too much flesh; whose elbow is twisted out from her chest-ribs;</p>  
 <p>23. Aquiline of nose; in whose ears, to an observer, there is manifest nobility; in whose cheeks is a smoothness;</p>  
 <p>24. As though what stands out in front of her two eyes and of the stabbing-place of her throat, as her muzzle and jaw-sides, were a millstone-pick;</p>  
 <p>25. Who whisks [a tail] the like of a palm-branch, set with tufts of hair, against a flat udder, which the teats have never made to shrink;</p>  
 <p>26. Who, as she plays, alights on agile, slender legs, the fall of which on the earth is a mere pat;</p>  
 <p>27. Dusky in their tendinous parts, which leave the pebbles scattered; and which no [leather] shoeing protects from the black [basaltic] stones of the hills,</p>  
 <p>28. On which, by day, the chameleon remains on the outlook, as though his back, exposed to the sun, were turned to ashes in the fire,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="green">p. 315</font></a></p>  
 <p>29. When the leader of a party has said to them—the piebald locusts having already begun to kick the pebbles—"Make your siesta;"</p>  
 <p>30. The alternating play of whose fore-legs [they having already sweated, and the mirages having already shone on the rocks]</p>  
 <p>31. Is [as it were] the alternating movement of the hands of a bereaved, grizzly, howling woman, standing up, and answered by [other] bereaved ones suffering from unsucked milk;</p>  
 <p>32. Lamenting, her arms drooping, deprived of reason when the bringers of bad news announced the [menaced] death of her first-born;</p>  
 <p>33. Who tears her breast with her two hands, her corset being burst into tatters away from her chest-ribs;</p>  
 <p>34. By whose side walk the misinformers, their words being: "O thou son of Abū Sulmà, verily thou art already slain!"</p>  
 <p>35. And each faithful friend, from whom I had entertained hope [of protection from Muhammad's emissaries], said to me: "I will not deceive thee; I am busy with other things than thee."</p>  
 <p>36. Then I spoke out: "Make ye way for me;—may your fathers perish! For all that the Most Merciful [God] hath forewilled will be accomplished:</p>  
 <p>37. "Every son of a female, long though his safety may be, is one day borne upon a ridged implement [a bier with a ridged lid]."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="green">p. 316</font></a></p>  
 <p>38. I have been informed that the Apostle of God hath threatened me; but pardon is hoped for from the Apostle of God.</p>  
 <p>39. "Respite!—May He guide thee [O Apostle!) aright, who hath given thee the free gift of the Qur’ān, in which are exhortations and detail!—</p>  
 <p>40. "Punish me not, then, at the words of calumniators: for I have not offended, though stories have multiplied concerning me."</p>  
 <p>41. Verily, I occupy a position, such that, were the elephant [of Abraha] to occupy it, and were to see and hear what I hear [and see],</p>  
 <p>42. Out of distraction would his shoulders tremble, unless generosity were shown by the Apostle of God.</p>  
 <p>43. I ceased not to traverse the wilderness, penetrating the folds of darkness, the skirts of night having dropped over all,</p>  
 <p>44. Until I have placed my right hand, which I will not remove, in the palm of him who had a claim to vengeance,—whose word is the word.</p>  
 <p>45. A mere plaything unto me was the most terrible object, when I spoke to him, and it was said [unto me]: "Thou art accused and responsible!"</p>  
 <p>46. By a lion, whose den is in a level spot of the land, in the marshy hollow of ‘Aththar, surrounded by jungle upon jungle;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="green">p. 317</font></a></p>  
 <p>47. Who goes forth in the morning and provides with food two cubs, that feed on the flesh of men soiled in the dust and torn into fragments;</p>  
 <p>48. Who, when he attacks his equal, is not permitted to leave that equal otherwise than mortified;</p>  
 <p>49. From whom the wild asses of the desert take flight, and in whose valley bands of men cannot march;</p>  
 <p>50. In whose valley there never lacks a man of courage, whose weapons are soiled with blood, his garments in shreds, and [himself] eaten!</p>  
 <p>51. Verily the Apostle of God is a Light from which illumination is sought: a drawn Indian blade—one of the Swords of God;</p>  
 <p>52. Among a small band of the Quraysh, whose spokesman said, in the Vale of Makka, when they had embraced Islām: "Depart ye!"</p>  
 <p>53. And they did depart. But there departed not [among them] the poltroons, the dastards in time of the encounter, the puny, and the unarmed.</p>  
 <p>54. They walk with the gait of light-coloured camels;—a blow protects them; while the dwarfish tawny men [of Madīna] run away:</p>  
 <p>55. Aquiline-nosed heroes; whose clothing, in combat, is of shirts of the tissue of David—</p>  
 <p>56. Bright and ample, interlaced with links like the tendrils of the Qaf‘a plant, firmly wove together;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="green">p. 318</font></a></p>  
 <p>57. Who are not boisterously joyful if their lances wound a foe; and who piteously bewail not when wounded;</p>  
 <p>58. Whom the spear-thrusts hit not, save on the front of their throats: for whom there is no shrinking back from the [battle-] pools of death!</p>
