 </p><table align="LEFT"><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="CENTER"><img src="img/32300.jpg" alt="I"></td></tr></table>IS it from a recollection of neighbours at Dhū-Salam that thou hast mixed with blood the tears flowing from an eyeball?  
 <p>2. “Or, has the wind blown from the direction of Kādzima, and has the lightning gleamed in the darkness from Itzam?</p>  
 <p>3. “What ails thy two eyes? If thou sayest, 'Leave off,' they fill. And what ails thy heart? If thou sayest, 'Be tranquil,' it is perplexed.</p>  
 <p>4. “Does the deeply-entangled lover suppose that affection can be concealed, when it is being partly wept for, and partly suffered for?</p>  
 <p>5. “Were it not for fondness, thou hadst not shed tears over projecting ruins, neither hadst thou remained sleepless with the memory of the moringa-tree and the long hill.</p>  
 <p>6. “And how wilt thou deny love, when the truth-speaking witnesses, tears and wasting, have testified to it against thee,</p>  
 <p>7. “And ardour hath fixed upon thy cheeks the two lines of grief and woe, like unto the corn-marigold and the ‘anam?“</p>  
 <p>8. “Yea! The phantom of her I love passed before me, and made me sleepless. For love doth dash delights with pain.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_324"><font size="1" color="green">p. 324</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. “O my chider for an excusable affection! [receive] an excuse from me to thee: and if thou wert just, thou wouldst not have reproached me.</p>  
 <p>10. “My condition hath become manifest unto thee; my secret is not concealed from the traducers; nor is my disease cut off.</p>  
 <p>11. “Thou hast given unto me sincere advice; but I listen not thereto. Verily a lover is in a state of surdity to all blamers!”</p>  
 <p>12. In truth, I have suspected my sincere gray hairs of being among my blamers; but my gray hairs are very far from blamings in giving advice.</p>  
 <p>13. For, indeed, the dominating spirit that commands me to do evil has not accepted admonition, through its ignorance, from the warning voice of gray hairs and decrepitude;</p>  
 <p>14. Neither has it made ready, out of good actions, a feast for the guest that has settled tenaciously on my head unabashed.</p>  
 <p>15. Had I known that I should not treat it with respect, I would have concealed with woad a secret that became revealed to me.</p>  
 <p>16. Who is for me in checking perversity in its erratic movements, as the perversity of horses is checked with bits?</p>  
 <p>17. Propose not, therefore, to crush its inclination in its acts of rebellion; for food invigorates desire in the insatiate.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_325"><font size="1" color="green">p. 325</font></a></p>  
 <p>18. The Flesh is like a child: if thou leavest him alone, he grows up with a love for suckling; and if thou weanest him, he is weaned.</p>  
 <p>19. Turn, then, away its desire; and take heed lest thou make it thy master: for whomsoever desire masters, it kills, or binds fast.</p>  
 <p>20. And watch thou over it, while it grazes in the [field of] actions. Then, if it find the pasturage sweet to its taste, leave it not to pasture.</p>  
 <p>21. How often hath it made a lethal thing appear pleasant of taste unto a man, while he knew not that poison was in the gravy!</p>  
 <p>22. And beware of artifices devised by hunger and satiety. For many an emptiness of stomach is more detrimental than indigestion.</p>  
 <p>23. And dash out the tears from thine eye that has filled from [a desire for] forbidden things; and strictly observe the diet of penitence.</p>  
 <p>24. And withstand thou the Flesh and the Devil, and rebel against them. Even when they offer thee sincere advice, doubt it.</p>  
 <p>25. And be not thou obedient to them, either as adversary or arbiter; for thou art aware of the devices of the adversary and of the arbiter.</p>  
 <p>26. I ask forgiveness of God for my spoken words unaccompanied by deeds; for therewith have I accused a spouse of barren wives of having posterity.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_326"><font size="1" color="green">p. 326</font></a></p>  
 <p>27. I have commanded thee [to do] good; but I have not [myself] conformed thereto. I have not been upright;—what, then, is my word to thee: Be upright?</p>  
 <p>28. I have not provisioned myself, before death, with a [store of] supererogatory good works; I have not worshipped, save as is incumbent; nor have I fasted [otherwise].</p>  
 <p>29. I have swerved from the practice of him who made the darkness [of night] alive [with his devotions], until his two feet complained of injury from tumefaction;</p>  
 <p>30. And bound up his entrails from hunger, and girded beneath stones a tender-skinned hypochondriac region;</p>  
 <p>31. Whom the towering mountains sought to entice from his self-possession by talking about gold; but to which he exhibited a surprising loftiness;</p>  
 <p>32. Whose necessity confirmed his disinclination towards them; for, verily, necessity doth not invade continences.</p>  
 <p>33. Then, how could his necessity invite to [the things of ] the world, him, without whom the world would not have come forth from naught?—</p>  
 <p>34. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Muhammad</span>, the Prince of the two universes [material and spiritual], of the two ponderable classes [men and demons], and of the two sections [of mankind], of the Arabians and of the Non-Arabians;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_327"><font size="1" color="green">p. 327</font></a></p>  
 <p>35. Our Annunciator, who commands and who prohibits; than whom no one is more righteous in the word "No!" or in [the word] "Yea!"</p>  
 <p>36. Who is also the "Beloved One [of God];" whose intercession is hoped for in every terror, of the terrors that beset;</p>  
 <p>37. Who called [men and demons] to [obedience to] God; so that they who lay hold on him have hold of a cable that will not break;</p>  
 <p>38. Who surpassed [all] the prophets in manly form and in moral qualities; whom they do not approach in knowledge or in generosity;</p>  
 <p>39. All of them supplicate the "Apostle of God" for a handful of [his] sea [of knowledge], or for a sip of [his] steady rain [of exposition];</p>  
 <p>40. Compared with whom, they, in their degree, are cognisant of a [mere] dot of the [divine] knowledge, or a [bare] suspicion of [God's] wisdoms;</p>  
 <p>41. Whose outward form and inner significance the Creator of the soul perfected, and whom He then selected [as His] "Beloved One;"</p>  
 <p>42. Who is unassociated with any partner in his beauties; in whom the essence of loveliness is undivided.</p>  
 <p>43. Put aside that which the Nazarenes have laid claim to for their prophet; pronounce what thou wilt in his praise, and decide;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_328"><font size="1" color="green">p. 328</font></a></p>  
 <p>44. Attribute to his personality what thou wilt of nobility; and ascribe to his worth what thou wilt of vastness;</p>  
 <p>45. For verily the superiority of the Apostle of God hath no limit, that a speaker can clearly enunciate with his mouth concerning it.</p>  
 <p>46. If his miracles had equalled his worth, his [very] name, when called upon, would have brought back to life mouldering bones fallen to pieces.</p>  
 <p>47. But, out of anxious solicitude towards us, he hath not tried us with anything at which men's reasons break down; we therefore doubt not, nor vainly surmise.</p>  
 <p>48. The comprehension of his spiritual mystery outwearies the human race; thou wilt, therefore, not see, far or near, any not out of breath [thereat];—</p>  
 <p>49. Even as the sun at a distance appears small to our eyes, but fatigues the sight with over-closeness.</p>  
 <p>50. And how should a sleeping people comprehend his reality in this lower world? They console themselves with dreams in lieu thereof.</p>  
 <p>51. The utmost scope of [their] knowledge concerning him [is], that he was a man, and that he is the best of God's creatures—of the whole of them.</p>  
 <p>52. And all the signs that the noble apostles wrought [in former days] pertained unto them merely through his glory.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_329"><font size="1" color="green">p. 329</font></a></p>  
 <p>53. For verily he is the sun of superiority, of which they are the stars. They exhibit their lights to the people in the darknesses [but the sun is visible by day].</p>  
 <p>54. How noble was the manly form of the Prophet; whom moral qualities adorned; whom beauty enveloped; and whom beauty of features distinguished!</p>  
 <p>55. Like the flowers in softness, and the full moon in splendour, and the sea in liberality, and time in endeavours!</p>  
 <p>56. Through his majesty, when thou meetest him, in an army, or in a body of attendants, it is as though he were a solitary individual!—</p>  
 <p>57. As though the pearl enclosed in the shell were [composed] of the two ores—speech from him, and smiling!</p>  
 <p>58. There is no perfume to equal the earth that has enclosed his bones;—blessed is he that sniffs therefrom, and he who kisses [it]!</p>  
 <p>59. His birth made manifest the sweet-smelling goodness of his substance. How fragrant was the commencement thereof, and the conclusion!</p>  
 <p>60. [It was] a day in which the Persians sagaciously opined that they were warned of the happening of evil and of vengeance;</p>  
 <p>61. And the pavilion of the Chosroes became, being fissured, like unto the courtiers of the Chosroes, irremediably disarrayed;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="green">p. 330</font></a></p>  
 <p>62. And the [Sacred] Fire, through sorrowfulness thereat, became extinct in its respirations [of flame], and the river [of the Tigris] dry at fount, through choking;</p>  
 <p>63. And it afflicted [the town of ] Sāwa that its lake should sink into the earth, and that the corner thereto for water should be angrily repelled when he thirsted;—</p>  
 <p>64. As though in the Fire [there was], through sadness, the wetness that is in water; and in the water, the [heart-] burning that is in fire;—</p>  
 <p>65. Then the genii make their voices heard; and the meteors are flashing, and the truth becomes manifest in sense and in words;</p>  
 <p>66. [But men] were blind and deaf; so the proclamation of the good news was not heard; nor were the flaming admonitions heeded;</p>  
 <p>67. Although their soothsayers had informed the peoples that their crooked religions would not stand;</p>  
 <p>68. And though they had seen in the horizon blazing stars fallen, in like manner with what [took place] on earth with idols;</p>  
 <p>69. Until it happened, by means of revelation, that one discomfited individual of the demons followed the footmarks of [another] discomfited one;</p>  
 <p>70. As though they were, in [their] flight, the cowards of Abraha, or the army lapidated with pebbles from his [Muhammad's] two hands,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="green">p. 331</font></a></p>  
 <p>71. In a throw, after a recitation of doxology within their two palms; even as the casting forth of the doxologist [Jonah] from the entrails of the swallowing fish;</p>  
 <p>72. At his [Muhammad's] call the trees came prostrating themselves, walking towards him on legs [trunks] without feet;</p>  
 <p>73. As though they were tracing lines for what their branches wrote, of a beautiful handwriting, in the main track of the path:</p>  
 <p>74. Like the cloud, which followed wherever he went, shielding him from the oven-like heat of noontide waxed sultry.</p>  
 <p>75. I swear by the cloven moon,—verily, it hath a relation, through his heart, which makes an oath thereby sacred to fulfil,—</p>  
 <p>76. And by what the Cave enclosed of good and generous, while all the eyes of the misbelievers were blind thereto,</p>  
 <p>77. And "Honesty," in the Cave, and the "Vouching Friend" [Abū-Bekr], budged not, while they [their pursuers] were saying: "No soul is in the Cave:</p>  
 <p>78. They imagined that the Dove would not circle, and they supposed that the Spider would not weave, around the "Best of Mortals;"</p>  
 <p>79. The protection of God rendered [them] independent of twofold coats of mail, and of high towers.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="green">p. 332</font></a></p>  
 <p>80. Time has not offered me an injury [against which] I have had recourse for protection unto him [Muhammad], but I received a protection from him that is not to be infringed;</p>  
 <p>81. And I have not craved from his hand the riches of this world, or the next, but that I received a bounty from the best of [bestowing hands] respectfully kissed [as their bounty is accepted] .</p>  
 <p>82. Deny thou not the revelation from his vision. Verily he had a heart that did not sleep when the two eyes slept;</p>  
 <p>83. For this [happened] in the time of the fulness of the prophetship; therefore the state of the dreamer is not denied regarding him.</p>  
 <p>84. God be sanctified! No revelation can be acquired by effort; and no prophet is suspected without his privity.</p>  
 <p>85. How many hath his [Muhammad's] hand cured by the touch who were diseased; and hath skilfully set free from the halter of insanity!</p>  
 <p>86. And his prayer hath made the year of drought to be alive—so that it hath been told of as a chief [year] among the times of rich vegetation—</p>  
 <p>87. By a cloud-bank that rained copiously, so that thou wouldst thence have imagined the pebbly torrent-channels were dikes cut from the ocean, or an inundation from a mountain-reservoir broken loose!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_333"><font size="1" color="green">p. 333</font></a></p>  
 <p>88. Let me alone, and my description of some of his miracles, which were as manifest as is the conspicuousness of the hospitality-fire. by night on the mountain-top;—</p>  
 <p>89. For pearls increase in beauty when they are in regular strings, while they lose no value when unstrung;—</p>  
 <p>90. And what [signifies] the aspiringness of the yearnings of the panegyrist toward that which is in him [Muhammad] of noble qualities and habits?</p>  
 <p>91. [And that volume of] Miracles of the Truth, brought into new existence by the All-Merciful, though [itself] an attribute of Him who is qualified with eternity, and [itself also] eternal;</p>  
 <p>92. It is not in conjunction with any one time [alone]; but it reminds us of the Resurrection, and of [the people of] ’Ad, and of [the garden of] Iram;</p>  
 <p>93. It remains perpetual with us; therefore it hath surpassed every miracle of the prophets [of old], since they came forth and endured not;</p>  
 <p>94. [Its miracles, <i>i.e.</i>, verses, are] self-evident, so that they remain not matters of doubt to the caviller, neither do they excite a desire for [another] arbiter;</p>  
 <p>95. It has never been contested, but that the most aggressive of its attackers has returned to it proposing peace;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="green">p. 334</font></a></p>  
 <p>96. Its eloquence repels the pretensions of its disputer, with the repulsion of the jealous one [who repels] the hand of the criminal from the things held sacred [to virtue];</p>  
 <p>97. Its miracles [verses] have significations like the waves of the ocean at full tide, and above the pearls thereof in beauty and in values;</p>  
 <p>98. Its wonders are not to be told or counted, neither does it verge, through over-abundance, on tediousness;</p>  
 <p>99. The eye of its reader is made to sparkle; therefore have I said to him [the reader]: "Thou hast found the stay [cable] of God; keep fast hold [thereon];</p>  
 <p>100. "If thou recite it out of fear of the heat of the fire of hell's lowest pit, thou hast extinguished the heat of the pit with its refreshing recitation."</p>  
 <p>101. It is, as it were, the Tank, at which the faces of transgressors become whitened, who have approached it black as charcoal;</p>  
 <p>102. And as the [strait] Path and the Balance, in equity; for justice, by any other than it, is not established among the people.</p>  
 <p>103. Wonder thou not at envious ones who deny it through ignorance, whereas it is [as] the [very] eye [-sight] of the perspicacious and intelligent:—</p>  
 <p>104. The eye, through ophthalmia, has, ere now, denied the light of the sun; and the mouth, through disease, has denied the taste of water.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_335"><font size="1" color="green">p. 335</font></a></p>  
 <p>105. O [Muhammad] thou Best of those whose court the guests seek, trudging on foot, or [seated] upon the loins of easy-paced she-camels;</p>  
 <p>106. And who art the greatest sign for one who takes admonition; and who art the greatest blessing to him who avails [thereof]!</p>  
 <p>107. Thou travelledst by night from one sacred site to [another] sacred site, as the full moon journeys in the deepest of darkness;</p>  
 <p>108. And thou continuedst to mount, until thou reachedst the stage of Two Bow-shots, not reached [by another], and not attempted;</p>  
 <p>109. And all the prophets and messengers gave thee the precedency—the precedency of the served one over the servants;</p>  
 <p>110. And thou traversedst with them the seven strata [of the heavens] in a procession, in which thou wast the standard-bearer;</p>  
 <p>111. Until thou leftedst not a further limit for any to go beyond thee in propinquity [to God's throne], nor a stair of ascent for any one mounting;</p>  
 <p>112. Thou debasedst every degree by comparison, when thou wast invited to go up higher, like the sole distinguished guest;</p>  
 <p>113. That thou mightest have an interview with One curtained in how special a manner from the eyes [of mankind] and [the communication of] a secret concealed in how profound a degree;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_336"><font size="1" color="green">p. 336</font></a></p>  
 <p>114. Thou gainedst every subject of [legitimate] boasting, without a co-participator; and thou passedst through every stage [of progress] free from the throng;</p>  
 <p>115. And illustrious was the worth of the grades thou acquiredst; difficult is the comprehension of the favours thou receivedst!</p>  
 <p>116. Glad tidings unto us, the host of Islām! For verily we have, through [God's] grace, a corner pilaster undemolishable!</p>  
 <p>117. Inasmuch as God has named him [Muhammad] "the Most Noble of the Apostles," who called us to obedience unto Him [God], we are the noblest of peoples.</p>  
 <p>118. The tidings of his mission scared the hearts of the enemies, as a cry that puts to flight an unminded flock of sheep and goats;</p>  
 <p>119. Neither did he cease to meet them on every battle-field, until, through his lances, they put [men] in mind of flesh on a tray;</p>  
 <p>120. They preferred flight; and therein they had well-nigh envied the [torn] limbs rising [into the air] with the eagles and the vultures;</p>  
 <p>521. The nights went by, and they knew not the count thereof, when these were not nights of the months when warfare is unlawful.</p>  
 <p>122. As though the religion [of Islām] were a guest that had alighted in their court with all noble brood camels, eager to devour the flesh of his enemies,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_337"><font size="1" color="green">p. 337</font></a></p>  
 <p>123. Who led a flood of an army [mounted] upon fleet horses, that threw up dashing waves of brave warriors,</p>  
 <p>124. [Composed] of all ready answerers to his call, confiding in God, and attacking with an exterminating weapon—extirpator of blasphemy;</p>  
 <p>125. Until, through them, the religious community of Islām, after its exile, became united to its blood-kindred;</p>  
 <p>126. For ever guaranteed, through them, with the best of fathers, and the best of husbands; so that it shall not become an orphan, nor a widow.</p>  
 <p>127. They were [immovable as] mountains. Ask, then, concerning them, of him who encountered with them: what was it he experienced from them in every place of encounter?</p>  
 <p>128. And ask Hunayn, and ask Badr, and ask ’Uhud: seasons of death more dire to them than the pest!</p>  
 <p>129. They sent forth the bright swords red, after these had reached every black hanging ear-curl of the hair of their enemies;</p>  
 <p>130. And they wrote with brown lances of Khatt, whose pens did not leave one body of a letter unpunctuated;</p>  
 <p>131. Whose weapons are keen; who have a mark that distinguishes them; for the rose is distinguished from the acacia by its mark.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="green">p. 338</font></a></p>  
 <p>132. The winds of victory guide unto thee their odour; so that thou deemest each armour-clad warrior a flower in its calyx.</p>  
 <p>133. They are, on the backs of their steeds, as it were, trees on hills, by reason of the firmness of courage, not through stringency of girths.</p>  
 <p>134. The hearts of the enemies sank with dismay at their onset; so that thou couldst not distinguish whether they were a flock of lambs or an army of warriors.</p>  
 <p>135. For whoso hath his stay in the Apostle of God, if lions meet him in their thickets, they are struck mute and motionless.</p>  
 <p>136. Thou wilt never see one of his friends unsuccoured by him, nor one enemy unbroken!</p>  
 <p>137. He hath caused his people to camp in the protection of his religion, even as the lion lays him down with his whelps in the thickets!</p>  
 <p>138. How many disputants concerning him have the words of God confounded; and how many adversaries has the Demonstration overcome in argument!</p>  
 <p>139. Let science in the "Illiterate One," in a time of universal ignorance [of God], and education in the "Orphan," suffice thee as a miracle!</p>  
 <p>140. I have given him my service in a panegyric, by which I seek pardon for the sins of a lifetime passed in poetry and services,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_339"><font size="1" color="green">p. 339</font></a></p>  
 <p>141. Which have placed on my neck that of which the results are to be feared; as though I were, through them, a victim from among cattle.</p>  
 <p>142. In both those occupations I have obeyed the seductions of youth; and I have earned nothing, save through sins and regret.</p>  
 <p>143. O what loss to a soul, in its traffic, that has not purchased religion with the world [as its price], and has not made a bid [for future happiness]!</p>  
 <p>144. And whoso selleth his future for the present, there becomes manifest for him a being cheated in the sale, and in the prepayment!</p>  
 <p>145. If I have committed a sin, my compact is not broken away from the Prophet, nor my cable sundered;</p>  
 <p>146. For verily I hold a safeguard from him through my being named Muhammad; and he is the most true of men to his bond.</p>  
 <p>147. If, in my resurrection, there be not one to take me by the hand out of goodness, then, otherwise, say thou [of me]: "Alas, the footslip!"</p>  
 <p>148. Be it not imagined of him that he will frustrate of his generosities the expectant one, or that the refugee will return from him other than treated with honour.</p>  
 <p>149. And ever since I have devoted my thoughts to his praiseworthy qualities, I have found him the best of sureties for my salvation.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_340"><font size="1" color="green">p. 340</font></a></p>  
 <p>150. Wealth from him will never fail a hand pinched with poverty: verily the rain maketh the flowers to grow on the hills!</p>  
 <p>151. And I have not desired the glory of the world, which the hands of Zuhayr [the poet] grasped through what he sang in praise of Harim.</p>  
 <p>152. O thou most noble of the creation! I have not any one [beside thee] to whom to betake me, on the occurrence of the universal event [of death and resurrection].</p>  
 <p>153. And thy dignity, O Apostle of God! will not be narrowed through me when the All-Generous God shall manifest Himself in His name of an Avenger.</p>  
 <p>154. For the world and its fellow [future life] exist out of thy bounty; and out of thy science exists the science of the Tablet and of the Pen!</p>  
 <p>155. O Flesh! despair thou not by reason of a footslip that was great: verily deadly sins, in the divine forgiveness, are as venial offences.</p>  
 <p>156. Maybe that the grace of my Lord, when He shall share it out, will come, in the shares, in proportion to the transgressions.</p>  
 <p>157. O my Lord [God], let not my hope be reversed in Thy counsel; and judge Thou not my reckoning deficient!</p>  
 <p>158. And deal Thou graciously with Thy servant: verily he hath a fortitude, which, when terrors call for it, is put to flight.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_341"><font size="1" color="green">p. 341</font></a></p>  
 <p>159. And grant Thou that showers of benedictions from Thee [may be] perpetual upon the Prophet, copious and continuous;</p>  
 <p>160. And upon the family and the companions; then upon the successors of these, the men of piety, and virtue, and forbearance, and generosity;</p>  
 <p>161. While the breath of the zephyr waves the branches of the moringa, and the camel-leader enlivens the camels with chants.</p>
