 <p>CHAPTER II., Verse 256.—God, there is no god but He, the living, the self-subsistent. Slumber takes Him not, nor sleep. His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. Who is it that intercedes with Him save by His permission? He knows what is before them and what behind them, and they comprehend not aught of His knowledge but of what He pleases. His throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and it tires Him not to guard them both, for He is high and grand.</p>  
 <p>Chapter IV., Verse 51.—Verily, God pardons not associating aught with Him, but He pardons anything short of that to whomsoever He pleases: but he who associates aught with God, he hath devised a mighty sin.</p>  
 <p>Chapter VII., Verse 190.—Will they associate with Him those who cannot create aught, but are themselves created, which have no power to help them, and cannot even help themselves?</p>  
 <p>But if ye call them unto guidance they will not follow you. It is the same to them if Thou dost call them, or if Thou dost hold Thy tongue.</p>  
 <p>Those whom ye call on other than God are servants like yourselves. Call on them then,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="green">p. 31</font></a></p>  
 <p>and let them answer you, if so be ye tell the truth! Have they feet to walk with? or have they hands to hold with? or have they eyes to see with? or have they ears to hear with? Call upon your partners; then plot against me, and do not wait.</p>  
 <p>(195).—Verily, my patron is God, who hath sent down the Book, and He is the patron of the righteous. But those whom ye call on beside Him cannot help you, nor can they even help themselves. But if ye call them unto the guidance they will not hear, thou mayest see them looking towards thee, yet they do not see. Take to pardon, and order what is kind, and shun the ignorant; and if an incitement from the devil incites you, then seek refuge in God; verily, He both hears and knows.</p>  
 <p>Chapter XIII., Verse 15.—On Him is the call of truth, and those who call on others than Him shall not be answered at all, save as one who stretches out his hand to the water that it may reach his mouth, but it reaches it not! The call of the misbelievers is only in error.</p>  
 <p>And God do those who are in the heavens and the earth adore, whether they will or no! As do their shadows also morn and eve.</p>  
 <p>Say, "Who is Lord of the heavens and the earth?" Say "God." Say, "Do ye take beside God patrons who cannot control profit or harm for themselves?" Say, "Shall the blind and the seeing be held equal? or shall the darkness and the light be held equal? or have they made associates with God who can create as He creates, so that the creation seem familiar to them?"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p>Say, "God is the creator of everything, and He is the one, the dominant."</p>  
 <p>Chapter XVII., Verse 23.—Put not with God other gods, or thou wilt sit despised and forsaken.</p>  
 <p>Chapter XIX., Verse 91.—They say, "The Merciful has taken to Himself a son": ye have brought a monstrous thing! The heavens well-nigh burst asunder thereat, and the earth is riven, and the mountains fall down broken, that they attribute to the Merciful a son! But it becomes not the Merciful to take to Himself a son! There is none in the heavens or the earth but comes to the Merciful as a servant; He counts them and numbers them by number, (95) and they are all coming to Him on the resurrection day singly.</p>  
 <p>Chapter XXVII., Verse 60.—Say, "Praise belongs to God; and peace be upon His servants whom He has chosen! Is God best, or what they associate with Him?" He who created the heavens and the earth; and sends down upon you from the heaven water; and we cause to grow therewith gardens fraught with beauty; ye could not cause the trees thereof to grow! Is there a god with God? nay, but they are a people who make peers with Him! He who made the earth, settled, and placed amongst it rivers; and placed upon it firm mountains; and placed between the two seas a barrier; is there a god with God? nay, but most of them know not! He who answers the distressed when he calls upon Him and removes the evil; and makes you successors in the earth; is there a god with God? Little is it that ye are mindful. He who guides you in the darkness, of the land</p>  
 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></a></p>  
 <p>and of the sea; and who sends winds as glad tidings before His mercy; is there a god with God? exalted be God above what they associate with Him! (65) He who began the creation and then will make it return again; and who provides you from the heavens and the earth; is there a god with God? so bring your proofs if ye do speak the truth."</p>  
 <p>Chapter CXII., Verse 1.—In the name of the Merciful and Compassionate God</p>  
 <p>Say, "He is God alone!</p>  
 <p>"God the Eternal!</p>  
 <p>"He begets not and is not begotten!</p>  
 <p>"Nor is there like unto Him any one!"</p>
