 <p>(157)</p>  
 <p>His Supplication for Monday</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>Praise is for Allah Who guided me towards Islam, enlightened me in</p>  
 <p>religion and granted me insight about those things in which people look</p>  
 <p>for allegations and accusation. Pure is Allah Who sustains the great and</p>  
 <p>the unjust, the intelligent and the fools, when He is Merciful towards the</p>  
 <p>negligent and careless, why will He not be Merciful on those who invoke</p>  
 <p>and beseech Him. There is no Lord except Allah and He bestows His</p>  
 <p>grace and Mercy on those who run away from His obedience so that</p>  
 <p>they may refrain from their tyranny and oppression and are prepared to</p>  
 <p>do good deeds with sincere people. And Allah is Great. He is tolerant</p>  
 <p>and knowledgeable Who has such amazing and marvelous proofs in the</p>  
 <p>universe which proves His Godhood, without a doubt. His recognition of</p>  
 <p>destinies and the excellent policies are adequate evidences and the just</p>  
 <p>witnesses are sufficient proof of His Oneness. O my Creator! O He Who</p>  
 <p>wards off the misfortune, aware of the secrets, gives abundance in</p>  
 <p>bestowal of rewards, I ask You, as the one who is ashamed of his sins</p>  
 <p>and is persistently absorbed in disobedience. I don't find anyone other</p>  
 <p>than You who can grant me refuge in it? And there is none other than</p>  
 <p>You, with whom I can get my helplessness dispelled and can put forth</p>  
 <p>my grievances. O the Lord of Majesty Your obligations has spread over</p>  
 <p>the entire creation and Your vast bounties have covered them up, and</p>  
 <p>Your complete bestowals are a source of happiness. O the Honourable</p>  
 <p>and the Generous and the abundant forgiver, and the one to deal strictly</p>  
 <p>with the disobedient I confess the errors of my soul and I plead to You</p>  
 <p>because I don't find a better place to seek pardon for my evil deeds,</p>  
 <p>other than You. O the bestower of the favourite bounties, and the</p>  
 <p>warder of calamities and the foremost in making the wishes come true.</p>  
 <p>The foreheads are bowed before You, don't send them dejected. Indeed</p>  
 <p>You do what pleases You and command what You like. O My Lord! O</p>  
 <p>my Master! When sorrow and shame is open and the feeling of fear and</p>  
 <p>chastisement has fallen down, then who is the lord from whom I can</p>  
 <p>have hopes, who is He to whom I can have hopes, who is He to whom I</p>  
 <p>can turn to and You are the Lord of forgiveness and the peak of Mercy.</p>  
 <p>O My Lord! Will You put me among those who will be destroyed,</p>  
 <p>whereas You are the best concealer (of sins)? Will You question me for</p>  
 <p>my sins in everybody's presence, whereas You are aware of the secrets</p>  
 <p>of the hearts? O Allah although I have been unjust on my soul, and have</p>  
 <p>overlooked Your commands, and have indulged myself in sins, and have</p>  
 <p>forgotten everything, but still You are the Owner of favours Who is</p>  
 <p>extremely kind towards the sinners and is benevolent upon the evil</p>  
 <p>doers by Your Grace. Thus! O the great Merciful, be kind upon me, as</p>  
 <p>You are the one Who can give peace to the living heart and by Your</p>  
 <p>favours, make the wishes of the hopeful come true. Your mercy also</p>  
 <p>showers on the undeserving. Give me shade in those desires, where</p>  
 <p>there is the sign of despair, and such a hope, which is not destined by</p>  
 <p>Your Chastisement. O He Who has covered everything by His</p>  
 <p>knowledge, O my Master, now my state is such that from dawn to dusk I</p>  
 <p>am begging at the door of Your Mercy and am away from asking from</p>  
 <p>anyone else other than You. And Your immense grace is too great to</p>  
 <p>reject the plea of a beggar, of a person who is imprisoned, one who is</p>  
 <p>inflicted with problems, and one who impatiently awaits Your forgiveness</p>  
 <p>to turn him down. O my Lord, the strength, intellect and thoughts are</p>  
 <p>incapable to gather knowledge about You and the tongues are</p>  
 <p>dumbstruck in praising You. Thus bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his</p>  
 <p>progeny by Your Grace and forgive my sins and grant me pure and</p>  
 <p>excellent and honourable sustenance by Your vast Grace. O the only</p>  
 <p>support of hopeful, O the one having power on the Heavens and the</p>  
 <p>Earth O the one to remain after the destruction of entire creation the</p>  
 <p>deeds on the day of reward and punishment, forgive my laxity O my</p>  
 <p>Lord! One who due to errors does not have trust on himself, then his</p>  
 <p>trust and the hope of the one who does not find any destination and the</p>  
 <p>hope of the one who does not have any hopes left due to his deeds. O</p>  
 <p>my Lord save me from destruction by Your Mercy, and put me among</p>  
 <p>Your appointed people, count me among the pious ones, forgive my sins</p>  
 <p>of the night and days, O the Knower of the secrets of the hearts, O the</p>  
 <p>possessor of grandeur and Majestic, the rights of my parents, brothers,</p>  
 <p>and sisters which are obligatory upon me, You fulfill them and relieve me</p>  
 <p>with Your Mercy and include me among those believers, whose</p>  
 <p>supplication You have accepted from the believing men and women.</p>  
 <p>Indeed You are Generous, Kind and an excessive forgiver. O Allah bless</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and bestow Your best protection.</p>
