 <p>His supplication for rains known as</p>  
 <p>'Istiskaa'</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>Praise is for Allah Who has completed the bounties, dispelled the</p>  
 <p>sorrow, given life to the living things. Who for His great throne has made</p>  
 <p>sky as a pillar and for His creatures earth as a carpet and mountains as</p>  
 <p>tent-pegs, the angels who rotate the earth and those who hold the skies</p>  
 <p>are on their mounts, and the pillars of the earth are withheld by His</p>  
 <p>Honour. Illuminated the universe by the Sun, and by its rays dispelled</p>  
 <p>the dark nights, and made the water flow on the earth, gifted the moon</p>  
 <p>with light and the stars with sparkle, then He rose and manifested His</p>  
 <p>Power and Created the earth. Then the strong and the arrogant one</p>  
 <p>was broken and was seeking the needs of the indigent people. O Allah!</p>  
 <p>For the sake of Your Honoured position and High Status and the safe</p>  
 <p>standard bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and His progeny as they have</p>  
 <p>manifested Your obedience and invited people towards You, have</p>  
 <p>fulfilled Your covenant, have implied Your laws, have treaded the path of</p>  
 <p>Your signs. He is Your creature, the trustworthy of Your covenant, the</p>  
 <p>caller towards Your laws, a witness of the caller towards Your</p>  
 <p>obedience and the invalidator of the excuses of the disobedient. O Allah!</p>  
 <p>Bestow bounty on Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) in such a measure that</p>  
 <p>You have reserved for anyone singly, and have illuminated their faces</p>  
 <p>by Your light, make their faces more illuminated and give him a position</p>  
 <p>more nearer than all other prophets, grant him the greatest share of</p>  
 <p>Your Pleasure and arrange his nation in the maximum rows because</p>  
 <p>they have never bowed before the idols, never prayed before trees,</p>  
 <p>neither drank wine nor blood. O Allah! We have left from Your presence</p>  
 <p>when darkness of distress had spread all over and the signs of poverty</p>  
 <p>made people helpless and we were made to subdue because of the</p>  
 <p>humiliation of relatives. And the group who lied were united against us</p>  
 <p>and famine had struck turning everyone as lean and slender who stood</p>  
 <p>against us, the clouds also cut our hopes for rains and we are thirsty for</p>  
 <p>the rains from water filled clouds and You are aware of all the troubles</p>  
 <p>and a hope for all requests our faith in You cries to You when people</p>  
 <p>have lost hopes, and clouds have dispersed and the lives are destroyed.</p>  
 <p>O the living and self-existing, trees, stars, rows after rows of angels, and</p>  
 <p>the stationed group of clouds questions You, do not return us</p>  
 <p>unsuccessful, do not account for our deeds, do not punish us for our</p>  
 <p>sins, and spread the clouds by Your mercy which are full of water and</p>  
 <p>are clearly seen, and oblige the creatures by growing various fruits and</p>  
 <p>flowers and after blooming of flowers buds make the civilization alive,</p>  
 <p>and call to witness Your Honoured angels, the rains should be such that</p>  
 <p>it is beneficial, create greenery, bring pleasure, and bringing life, and</p>  
 <p>prosperity with abundance forever, with big drops, which gives birth to</p>  
 <p>pure farms with extended stem, fresh and green, with branches spread</p>  
 <p>giving a good atmosphere with a vast illumination which is not without</p>  
 <p>the rains nor there remains any white piece without rains, nor any drop</p>  
 <p>which passes by it light and cold and is not beneficial for man. Your light</p>  
 <p>drops intoxicate, Your dead civilization comes to life, the scattered</p>  
 <p>sustenance gathers at one place, Your treasures of bounties are</p>  
 <p>manifested so that it reaches to all of Your creation who are perfect. So</p>  
 <p>much so that it reaches the famine covered area and those dead by the</p>  
 <p>circumstances comes back to life and the lakes and dams overflow, and</p>  
 <p>the peak of hills turn green and the green plants slant growing</p>  
 <p>abundantly, our farms turn green and fresh stream flows from dry areas,</p>  
 <p>our near and far areas turn green, our fruits grow heavy, our cattle</p>  
 <p>enliven and those settled away are satiated and our villagers become</p>  
 <p>strong and best obligation of all the obligation and the greatest bounties</p>  
 <p>among all on those creatures upon whom dust pours and from the fear</p>  
 <p>of those animals who roam freely to those animals who are useful. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! Send such rains that the earth becomes wet and continues to</p>  
 <p>pour and make us contented with those clouds which bring forth heavy</p>  
 <p>rains which is helpful, grants greenery and freshness its big drops,</p>  
 <p>benefits, faster, smoky, dark and heavy rains, that the dry things are</p>  
 <p>satiated and wasted things becomes useful once again, and those to be</p>  
 <p>born are ready. O Allah! Fill us with Your bounties, and favour us with</p>  
 <p>the blessings of the beneficial clouds which brings water in darkness</p>  
 <p>and gloom which put cover upon cover and shine upon shine</p>  
 <p>continuously and clouds spread over and do not make the swords of</p>  
 <p>chillness and its lightening and its water, mud and stones. O Allah! Save</p>  
 <p>us from polytheism and its wrath, oppression and its destruction, poverty</p>  
 <p>and its consequences. O the one to make goodness reach its</p>  
 <p>destination, and the one to send grace to the treasurers one of the</p>  
 <p>beneficial bounty is rains. You are the listener of the complaints, we are</p>  
 <p>sinners and You are the one from whom repentance is sought and You</p>  
 <p>forgive, We seek pardon from You. O the Merciful of all the mercifuls.</p>  
 <p>We ask You to forgive us for the sins due to ignorance and seek Your</p>  
 <p>pardon for our mistakes. O Allah! Our mountains have dried and our</p>  
 <p>earth has become dust and the animals have turned mad and are</p>  
 <p>standing in their stables and are crying so loudly as if a mother cries on</p>  
 <p>the death of her teenager son, they are tired of roaming in the barren</p>  
 <p>pasture ground and seeing the dry water wells because they have not</p>  
 <p>received a drop of rain. Now their bones have rotten. The fats in their</p>  
 <p>bodies have melted and the milk has also dried. O Allah! Have mercy on</p>  
 <p>the one who is moaning and the restless because our hopes are on</p>  
 <p>You, and we have to return to You, therefore do not discontinue the</p>  
 <p>rains on us, as You are aware of our secrets, and do not call to us for</p>  
 <p>accounting those deeds, which has been done by our fools. "Because</p>  
 <p>You bring down the rains even when people have lost hope completely</p>  
 <p>and You spread Your mercy and You are the guardian and worth the</p>  
 <p>praise.</p>
