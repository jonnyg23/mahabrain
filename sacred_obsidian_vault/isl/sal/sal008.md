 <p>begged of You with whom You has been pleased and unto whom You</p>  
 <p>have assured the granting thereof, O Allah, O Allah, O Allah, O Most</p>  
 <p>Merciful, O Most Merciful, O Most Merciful, O Most Beneficent, O Most</p>  
 <p>Beneficent, O Most Beneficent, O Lord of Majesty and Grace, O Lord of</p>  
 <p>Majesty and Grace, O Lord of Majesty and Grace. Through You,</p>  
 <p>Through You, Through You, Through You, Through You, Through You,</p>  
 <p>Through You I beseech You with the help of all the Names whereby You</p>  
 <p>have named Yourself, or which You have sent down in any of Your</p>  
 <p>inspired Scriptures, or Which You have inscribed in Your knowledge of</p>  
 <p>the unknown; and (I beseech You) in the name of the honored and</p>  
 <p>exalted positions of Your Throne, and in the name of the utmost extent</p>  
 <p>of Your Mercy as expressed in Your Book (the Quran) and in the name</p>  
 <p>of that which "If all the trees on earth were to become pens and all the</p>  
 <p>seven seas ink, the Words of Allah could not be fully written down."</p>  
 <p>"Verily Allah is the Honored, the Wise"; And I beseech You with the help</p>  
 <p>of Your Beautiful Names which You has praised in Your Book, saying:</p>  
 <p>Unto Allah belong the beautiful names -- so call ye Him by Them; And</p>  
 <p>You have said "Call unto Me and I shall answer You; and You has said,</p>  
 <p>"And when My servants ask something of Me, lo, I am near, and I grant</p>  
 <p>the prayer of the supplicant when he asks anything of Me, so pray ye</p>  
 <p>unto Me and believe in Me, that ye may be made perfect; And You has</p>  
 <p>said, "O My servants who have wronged yourselves, despair not of the</p>  
 <p>Mercy of Allah; verily Allah forgives all the sins; verily He is the</p>  
 <p>Forgiving, the Merciful." Therefore I pray unto You, My God, and I ask</p>  
 <p>You, My Cherisher and Sustainer, and I hope from You, my Chief, and I</p>  
 <p>crave Your acceptance of my prayer, O my Protector, even as You have</p>  
 <p>promised me, and I call upon You even as You have commanded me --</p>  
 <p>So, do unto me what pleases You to do, O Generous One! (Here the</p>  
 <p>Devotee should pray for the fulfillment of his valid desires.) And all</p>  
 <p>Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds, and the</p>  
 <p>blessings of Allah be upon Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and all His Holy</p>  
 <p>Descendants.</p>
