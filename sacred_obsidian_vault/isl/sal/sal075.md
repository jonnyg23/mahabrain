 <p>(74)</p>  
 <p>His supplication before the Battle of Jamal</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! I praise You as only You are worth the praise, as You have</p>  
 <p>obliged me so much that all my attention is only to You. Accept my</p>  
 <p>thanks as Your pardon is the best and Your test is since a long time, still</p>  
 <p>the thankfulness is a protection of my share of bounties, and not for</p>  
 <p>reforming myself. O Allah! You have obliged me by granting insight of</p>  
 <p>Your religion and recognition of Yourself and have granted Your</p>  
 <p>complete protection in my affairs. Have mercy on me and avert the</p>  
 <p>difficulties from me. Keep away Your fearful judgments from me. I don't</p>  
 <p>remember anything except Your obligation; I have not seen anything</p>  
 <p>except Your grace. O Allah! So many of the difficulties have been</p>  
 <p>warded off from me by You and was turned towards my enemies and</p>  
 <p>they were involved in it. And so many of the bounties which were with</p>  
 <p>my enemies, which You turned away from them and bestowed upon me.</p>  
 <p>And I am also not aware of all Your obligations on me. O Allah! You are</p>  
 <p>the one Who hears my prayers at the time of restlessness, You are the</p>  
 <p>one Who watches me at the times of sorrow, You are the one to avenge</p>  
 <p>my enemies. Neither I have ever found You away from me nor at the</p>  
 <p>times of prayer You are away and I always find You close to me and not</p>  
 <p>only when I call You. O Allah! I find only Your obligation worth praising</p>  
 <p>and only Your excellent tests is present with me, all Your actions are</p>  
 <p>good. My tongue, my intellect, all my parts and all that of mine which is</p>  
 <p>on the earth is full of praise for You. O Allah! For the sake of Your light</p>  
 <p>which You have created by Your Honour, and by the sake of Your</p>  
 <p>Honour which You have created by Your will, and by the sake of Your</p>  
 <p>name which is high, that bestow upon me the love to thank You</p>  
 <p>obligatorily. O Lord! Had You not helped me from all those things, which</p>  
 <p>were prohibited for me, and if the fear of the hereafter were not instilled</p>  
 <p>in me I would have been destroyed. O Allah the provisions of this world</p>  
 <p>called me, the greed of women and children which I accepted hastily and</p>  
 <p>tilted towards it, and when the provisions of the hereafter invited me</p>  
 <p>towards piety and goodness I stumbled but did not go that hastily as I</p>  
 <p>had gone for the things which be destroyed and perish very soon. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! You scared me, inculcated love in me, explained me with proofs</p>  
 <p>still I was not scared to the extent as it was desired and now I fear that I</p>  
 <p>am not unmindful in obedience to Your commands and that I might have</p>  
 <p>been deficient regarding Your established proofs. O Allah! Reserve all</p>  
 <p>my endeavours for Your strength and put Your fear in my heart. And</p>  
 <p>convert my carelessness, laziness, negligence and all personal fears</p>  
 <p>into Your fear, and obedience and good deeds by Your grace. O the</p>  
 <p>possessor of Honour and Majesty, make my shield against sins stronger</p>  
 <p>and multiply my good deeds as You can increase whatever You wish. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! Increase my status in the Heavens, and I seek refuge from all that</p>  
 <p>is eaten and drunk, but is prohibited by You, and I wish to be away from</p>  
 <p>the fear of all the known and unknown things, and I seek to be away</p>  
 <p>from the evil of all the things whether apparent or hidden. O Allah grant</p>  
 <p>me protection from what the others have done in ignorance instead of</p>  
 <p>knowledge, haste instead of tolerance, restlessness instead of patience</p>  
 <p>deviation instead of guidance and polytheism instead of faith. O my</p>  
 <p>Nourisher! Have mercy on me and oblige me because You befriend the</p>  
 <p>doers of good and never turn down their goodness and praise is for the</p>  
 <p>Lord of the worlds.</p>
