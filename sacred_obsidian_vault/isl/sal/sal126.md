 <p>(125)</p>  
 <p>His supplication for the second day of the</p>  
 <p>month</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>All praise is for Allah Who revealed on His servant Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
 <p>the divine book which is free from defects and is quite straightforward; in</p>  
 <p>order to forewarn mankind of the worst calamity, to give happy tidings to</p>  
 <p>the believers who perform good deeds that they would receive good</p>  
 <p>rewards and would eternally stay therein and also to forewarn those</p>  
 <p>who say that Allah has a son. Neither have they nor had their ancestors</p>  
 <p>any sense. Serious is the utterance that has come forth from their lips.</p>  
 <p>They say nothing but falsehood. All praise is for Allah Who relieved us</p>  
 <p>from distress. Verily our Lord would surely grant immense forgiveness.</p>  
 <p>He is Creator, Forgiver and Benevolent Who granted us an eternal</p>  
 <p>abode where neither any weariness nor any hardship will overtake us.</p>  
 <p>All praise be only to Allah, and peace be on His Servants whom He has</p>  
 <p>chosen: What! Is Allah better or what they join with Him? Is not He Who</p>  
 <p>created the Heavens and Earth, and sent down for you water from</p>  
 <p>Heaven; then caused to grow by it gardens, beautiful; it was not in your</p>  
 <p>power to grow the trees thereof. What! Is there any god with Allah? No,</p>  
 <p>they are a people who yet regard equals to Him. Is not He Who made</p>  
 <p>the Earth a resting place, and made in it rivers, and made on it</p>  
 <p>mountains, and caused between two seas a barrier. Is there any God</p>  
 <p>with Allah? No. Most of them know not. Is there anyone else to respond</p>  
 <p>to the distressed when he calls Him? Who removes the distress and</p>  
 <p>makes you the successors in the Earth? Is there any God with Allah?</p>  
 <p>How little you reflect. Is not He Who guides you in the darkness of the</p>  
 <p>land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as the bearers of the good</p>  
 <p>news of His Mercy? Is there any God with Allah? Exalted High is Allah</p>  
 <p>above what they associate with Him. Is not He Who originates the</p>  
 <p>creation, then reproduces it, and Who provides for you sustenance from</p>  
 <p>the Heaven and the Earth? Is there any God with Allah? Say, bring you</p>  
 <p>your proof, if you be truthful. Say: "None either in the Heavens or in the</p>  
 <p>Earth knows the unseen save Allah and they perceive not when they</p>  
 <p>shall be raised." (27: 59-65.) Glory be to Allah, the originator of the</p>  
 <p>Heavens and the Earth. He appointed the Angles as messengers who</p>  
 <p>possess two, three and four wings; He increases the creation as He</p>  
 <p>wishes. Verily Allah has power over all things. Praise be to Allah, the</p>  
 <p>Bountiful and Forgiving, the Most loving Merciful, Great Bestower, the</p>  
 <p>Exalted, the All-hearing and the All-seeing, Independent, Ever-living, the</p>  
 <p>Self-subsistent, Powerful and Almighty. He is real Lord, Authoritative,</p>  
 <p>and Omnipotent. Master, Just, Illuminated, High and Exalted,</p>  
 <p>Honourable, First and the Last, Hidden and Manifest. His is the highest</p>  
 <p>praise. He is everybody's Saviour, Greatest Creator, Maker, Fashioner,</p>  
 <p>Omnipotent, Truly Kind, Respectful and Knower of thanksgiving,</p>  
 <p>Administrator, Ruler, Viewer of all things, Kind, Protector, Graceful,</p>  
 <p>Wise, Praiseworthy, Dreadful, Forgiver of sins. Acceptor of repentance,</p>  
 <p>Master over all masters, Knower of the unseen and the seen, Constant</p>  
 <p>and the sustainer of the worlds. Glory be to Allah Whose praise is great,</p>  
 <p>Whose throne is great, Whose realm is great, Whose authority is great,</p>  
 <p>Whose courtesy is great, Whose skill is great, Whose blessing is great,</p>  
 <p>Whose light is great, Whose kindness is great, Whose honour is great,</p>  
 <p>Whose might is great, Whose power is great, and Whose command is</p>  
 <p>great. Glorious is Allah, the Lord of the universe. Praiseworthy is He</p>  
 <p>Who is most High, Who is most Honourable, Who is Greatest, Who is</p>  
 <p>most Kind, Who is most possessive of all things and Who is most</p>  
 <p>Virtuous. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the universe. Glory be to Allah,</p>  
 <p>the Greatest, Beneficent and Merciful, Endearing, Wise Creator,</p>  
 <p>Knower, Monarch, Clear, Almighty, Most High, Honourable and</p>  
 <p>Supreme Subduer, Master of Heaven and the Hell. Greatness and</p>  
 <p>dreadfulness are for Him and are at His command. It is He Who</p>  
 <p>deserves words of praise and He it is Who Bestows greatness to good</p>  
 <p>deeds. O, the most Merciful and compassionate!</p>
