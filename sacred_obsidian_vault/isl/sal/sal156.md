 <p>His supplication for Saturday</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>Praise is for Allah Who has connected my wishes with His forgiveness.</p>  
 <p>And has spread my desires with His mercy. Has strengthened my back</p>  
 <p>and the shoulders by His Generosity and Recognitions. He has not left</p>  
 <p>me without obligation and favours when I am involved in sins and</p>  
 <p>disobedience. And was negligent in His obedience, and have not fulfilled</p>  
 <p>the right of His fear and His chastisement. Allah is Pure on Whom the</p>  
 <p>believers rely and are devoted to Him in all the condition. No one is</p>  
 <p>independent of His grace. There is no god except Allah Who is attentive</p>  
 <p>to the one who is negligent about Him. Who accepts the repentance of</p>  
 <p>the one who does sins excessively. And He is displeased on the one</p>  
 <p>who has lost hopes of His Vast Blessings and Mercy, and Allah is above</p>  
 <p>all the things, Creator and Lord of all the things, the eradicator and</p>  
 <p>destroyer of all the things and Allah is Great, the greatness which He</p>  
 <p>deserves and it befits Him. O Allah bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) Your</p>  
 <p>servant, Your prophet, Your messenger, Your trustworthy, Your witness,</p>  
 <p>Pure and noble and on his progeny the Purified. O Allah! I ask You like</p>  
 <p>the one who has confessed his sins and like the one who has followed</p>  
 <p>the evil desires and is now ashamed of it, and You are the one Who can</p>  
 <p>be depended upon for forgiveness, and the best for the sinners and evil</p>  
 <p>doers because the sins have pushed them in the dark valley of</p>  
 <p>destruction, and is surrounded by errors and mistakes now the position</p>  
 <p>is such that I cannot consider the sins as insignificant. Now You are the</p>  
 <p>only place of hope and in hardships and ease You are the one on Whom</p>  
 <p>I rely. You are the refuge for the fearful who are drowning, and the</p>  
 <p>Merciful of all other mercifuls. O my Lord! I am presenting myself to You</p>  
 <p>attentively, because You are the climax for those who seek and the most</p>  
 <p>Merciful to accept the prayers of the sinners. O Allah! It is not difficult for</p>  
 <p>You to forgive the sins and cure the sorrow, although You are well</p>  
 <p>aware of the hidden things, You are the concealer of defects, and the</p>  
 <p>one to ward off the difficulties, because You are powerful, Everlasting</p>  
 <p>and Merciful and Who has worn the dress of Godhood and has</p>  
 <p>accepted the divinity of oneness. Now You are the pure from the status</p>  
 <p>of nature, so nobody can explain You by Your attributes and the</p>  
 <p>imagination of a man cannot comprehend You and the praise of people</p>  
 <p>equal to the number of Your Bounties and Your thankfulness equal to</p>  
 <p>the number of rotation of day and night. O Allah all the goodness are in</p>  
 <p>Your Power, and You are their Lord, the bestower of the cherished</p>  
 <p>bounties. You are the climax of aims, for the sake of Your vast Mercy I</p>  
 <p>seek nearness to You in which there is a place for everything. O Allah!</p>  
 <p>You are witnessing my status, aware of my heart, my affairs are not</p>  
 <p>concealed from You, and You are more nearer to me than my jugular</p>  
 <p>vein, so please accept my repentance by which I cannot repeat those</p>  
 <p>actions again which displease You, and grant me such a pardon after</p>  
 <p>which I don't indulge in sins, O the most Honourable of all the</p>  
 <p>Honourables. O my Lord, You have reformed the corrupted hearts and</p>  
 <p>they have changed and You are the one to oblige the deviated ones and</p>  
 <p>guide them by Your Guidance, and reinstate those deviated from the</p>  
 <p>right path and change their wrong deeds and laxity grant them Your</p>  
 <p>love, saved them from Your disobedience, bestowed on them the status</p>  
 <p>of good doers, put them among the successful people, O Lord, O the</p>  
 <p>most merciful of all the mercifuls, attach me together with those people.</p>  
 <p>O Allah I seek of You to bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and the progeny of</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and increase my sustenance the clean, pure and</p>  
 <p>safe and grant me the initiative to do those actions, which makes me</p>  
 <p>nearer to You, O Allah I present my helplessness as the one who is</p>  
 <p>helpless and has accepted his deviation. O the one Who forgives, I</p>  
 <p>repent to You, O the bestower of abundance bounties, do not make me</p>  
 <p>unsuccessful due to my low deeds, O the most High and Majestic, You</p>  
 <p>have always dealt with the sinners by forgiveness, please conceal the</p>  
 <p>evil deeds of this despised soul. O Lord, I have directed my attention</p>  
 <p>towards You, by the right which You have made obligatory on me,</p>  
 <p>because I don't have any good deed with which I can present myself, the</p>  
 <p>evils deeds are a barrier between me and the pious people, and as my</p>  
 <p>deeds are not such that can make me the companions of Your Prophets</p>  
 <p>so by the names which I have beseeched You, You make me turn</p>  
 <p>towards them, O my Lord, will You turn me unsuccessful whereas You</p>  
 <p>are my hope and will You turn me back empty-handed? In fact You are</p>  
 <p>my initial hope. O He Who is present and famous for Generosity, the</p>  
 <p>affairs of entire creation will ultimately return to You. Bless Muhammad</p>  
 <p>(s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and oblige me by taking me into their service</p>  
 <p>whose refuge is in Your neighbourhood, brothers, sisters, and include</p>  
 <p>me among those whom Your mercy covers. Your signs are reserved for</p>  
 <p>them, and Your favours are exclusively for them, You have created them</p>  
 <p>pure, doers of good, pious and great. Make me reach Your prophet</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) Mustafa peace be on him and his progeny</p>  
 <p>because he is on a station which is very nearer to You and O the</p>  
 <p>Beneficent and the Merciful forgive me and the believers and their</p>  
 <p>parents and their brothers and sisters.</p>
