 <p>His prayers praising Allah as taught to</p>  
 <p>Janab-e-Owais-e-Qarni</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! I ask from You not from others. I bow to You and never bow to</p>  
 <p>anyone other than You. I ask Allah, O the one Who gives respite to</p>  
 <p>those who fear Him. O the refuge of the one who seeks refuge. You are</p>  
 <p>the doer of goodness and the one to find a way through difficulties. You</p>  
 <p>forgive our carelessness, erase our sins, record our good deeds, raise</p>  
 <p>our status. I ask from You all good wishes and success, such wishes</p>  
 <p>other than which to seek from You is not proper. O Allah! O the</p>  
 <p>Beneficent! By Your Beautiful Names! Those great examples and the</p>  
 <p>countless bounties and by those names which are near to You in</p>  
 <p>greatness and dearer to You who in the ranks are nearer to You and</p>  
 <p>honoured and whose intercession is closer to You, and very important in</p>  
 <p>position, the most effective for acceptance and by Your name which is</p>  
 <p>Protected, Glorious, Respected and Great, with which You are happy</p>  
 <p>and satisfied, and one who calls You by these name is Your beloved.</p>  
 <p>You accept his invocations and it is his right upon You that You do not</p>  
 <p>refuse his invocations. And by all those names which are mentioned in</p>  
 <p>Taurat and Injeel, Zaboor and Furqan (the Holy Quran). And by all those</p>  
 <p>names which are specialized for You, which You have informed to one</p>  
 <p>of Your creatures or none is aware of it and all those names, by which</p>  
 <p>the holders of Your Throne and other Angels and those appointed from</p>  
 <p>Your creation call upon You. By the right of those who call upon You,</p>  
 <p>who bow down to You, who seek refuge from You, and those who</p>  
 <p>complain to You. By the right of those who worship You whether on land</p>  
 <p>or sea, on plains or on hills he calls You. Like whose need is quite</p>  
 <p>severe and sins are manifold and has reached the door of death,</p>  
 <p>strength has given way, who has no hopes on his deeds. He is not able</p>  
 <p>to find anyone to accept his efforts and to forgive his sins other than</p>  
 <p>You. And he has come voluntarily. There is no intention to rebel due to</p>  
 <p>Your obedience. O the Protector of all disabled I ask You as there is no</p>  
 <p>god other than You. You are affectionate, the Great obliger, the Creator</p>  
 <p>of the Heavens and the Earth. Possessor of Majesty and Mercy. Knower</p>  
 <p>of the Unseen and Seen, You are the Beneficent, the Merciful. You are</p>  
 <p>rich, I am poor, You are everlasting I shall die, You will remain I shall</p>  
 <p>perish, You are the forgiver I am a sinner. You are the Lord and I am a</p>  
 <p>slave. You are the king and I am Your subject. You are honoured and I</p>  
 <p>am degraded. You are self-sufficient and I am dependent. You are alive</p>  
 <p>and I am dead You are ever living and I will perish. You are doer of good</p>  
 <p>and I am sinful. You are forgiving and I am a sinner. You are merciful</p>  
 <p>and I am a transgressor. You are the Creator and I am the creature. You</p>  
 <p>are Powerful, I am weak. You are the Provider and I am the seeker. You</p>  
 <p>are the satisfier and I am fearful. You are the sustainer and we are the</p>  
 <p>sustained ones. To whom should we complain and address our</p>  
 <p>grievances? You are most deserving from among them as You have</p>  
 <p>pardoned many of the sinners. How many of the transgressors have You</p>  
 <p>overlooked! Pardon me, overlook my faults, have mercy on me. Protect</p>  
 <p>me from the calamity which has befallen me. Don't degrade me due to</p>  
 <p>my errors. Help me, my parents and my children. Have mercy on us. O</p>  
 <p>Merciful of all the mercifuls and the possessor of respect and Honour</p>  
 <p>have mercy on us.</p>
