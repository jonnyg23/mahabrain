 <p>(126)</p>  
 <p>His supplication for the third of the month</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>All praise be to Allah, Eternal with Constant activity, the Wise, Kind,</p>  
 <p>Foremost, Everlasting, Manifest, Hidden, the Only One, the Matchless,</p>  
 <p>Needless, He begets none nor is he begotten. There is none like Him.</p>  
 <p>Glory be to Allah Who is the real Guide, the Truth, the Justice, Manifest,</p>  
 <p>Lord of Mighty Grace, Magnificent, Most Honoured, Bestower, he grants</p>  
 <p>poverty and affluence to Who He wishes. He is the Lord of the</p>  
 <p>invulnerable strength, Excellent and Grantor of favour. Praise be to Allah</p>  
 <p>the Heir, the Guardian, Witness, Seer, Watchful, Listener of prayers.</p>  
 <p>Encompassing, Protector, Withholder, Opener, Provider, Giver of life</p>  
 <p>and death. The Glorious and Gracious, Worthy to be feared and worthy</p>  
 <p>to seek refuge to, the Lord of Ascents, unto Him ascend the Angels and</p>  
 <p>the Spirit. All Praise be to Allah Who is the Sustainer and Creator,</p>  
 <p>Merciful, His mercy is all embracing, Total Blessing and Absolute Proof.</p>  
 <p>Whose similitudes are most exalted and names are most beautiful.</p>  
 <p>Whose powers are invincible, the Cleaver of the dawn. The splitter of</p>  
 <p>grain seed and the date stone. He brings forth the living from the dead</p>  
 <p>and the dead from the living. He regulates the affairs of the Universe. He</p>  
 <p>is the Cleaver of the dawn; and has made the night for rest and the sun</p>  
 <p>and the moon for reckoning time. This is the measuring of the Almighty,</p>  
 <p>the All-knowing Lord. All Praise be to Allah, the most exalted, Lord of the</p>  
 <p>Heavenly Throne; sends forth He the Spirit at His own behest on</p>  
 <p>whomsoever He wishes of his servants that he may warn men of the day</p>  
 <p>of meeting, all good emanates from Him, Lord of mankind, Lord of</p>  
 <p>Lands. To Him is the return of all. He it is Who is at the zenith of vision,</p>  
 <p>knows He whatever any living being earns, Forgiver of sin, acceptor of</p>  
 <p>repentance, severe to chastise, the Lord of bounty. There is no god but</p>  
 <p>Allah, unto Him is the ultimate and end of the life journey of everything.</p>  
 <p>He is Mighty in prowess, Swift in reckoning, Firm in justice. When He</p>  
 <p>decrees an affair He only says to it "Be" and it is. He is full of good, and</p>  
 <p>is Bestower of good as He wishes. He never disappoints him who</p>  
 <p>beseeches Him, nor puts him to shame who is hopeful of Him. Neither</p>  
 <p>His blessings shrink nor can His bounties be counted. His promise is</p>  
 <p>just and right. He is the greatest amongst all the judges and the quickest</p>  
 <p>amidst all reckoners, Most Generous of all bountifuls, liberal in granting</p>  
 <p>bounties but stern in punishment. His decisions are just and He alone</p>  
 <p>deserves praise. He is true to His promise and Bestower of good.</p>  
 <p>Justice is the basis of His decisions. He guides towards the true path</p>  
 <p>and leads to straight path whomever He wishes. He is infinite in His</p>  
 <p>mercy. There is nothing whatsoever the like of Him. He created the sky,</p>  
 <p>the Earth, death and life that he may try of you which of you is best in</p>  
 <p>deeds. He alone is Almighty, forgiving, handsomely praised; He tests the</p>  
 <p>believers by gracious trial. Hearer of prayers and Just in His decisions.</p>  
 <p>He acts as He wishes and creates what He pleases. Might and Praise is</p>  
 <p>for Him. And for Him is Greatness, Pride and Sublimity. He sends down</p>  
 <p>rain, knows the "Unseen". He increases the sustenance of whom He</p>  
 <p>wishes, causes the wind to blow and raises He the heavy clouds and</p>  
 <p>regulates He the affairs of the Universe. He answers the distressed</p>  
 <p>when he calls Him, listens to the people's prayers, removes their</p>  
 <p>difficulties and satisfies the seeker. None can stop that which He</p>  
 <p>bestows nor can anyone give that which He withholds. There is nothing</p>  
 <p>whatsoever the like of Him. He is All-hearing and of All-seeing. His</p>  
 <p>names are secured. To create and to command are His domains.</p>  
 <p>Hallowed is He the Lord of Worlds. Great is His praise and all embracing</p>  
 <p>is His mercy manifested or hidden by His grace. Allah is most merciful.</p>
