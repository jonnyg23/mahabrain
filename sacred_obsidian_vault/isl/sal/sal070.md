 <p>His supplication for safety from calamities</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! Through You I am attacking and through You I am going</p>  
 <p>forward and by Your help I am hiding and by Your support I am</p>  
 <p>achieving success. I am dying and living for You. I have pledged my soul</p>  
 <p>and my transactions to You and there is no power or strength except</p>  
 <p>Allah the great. O Allah You have created me, sustained me, You have</p>  
 <p>concealed me and have bestowed Honour upon me among Your</p>  
 <p>creatures whenever I felt weak You bestowed strength on me, whenever</p>  
 <p>I stumbled You held me, whenever I was sick You cured me, whenever I</p>  
 <p>called You, You answered me. O my Lord! Be pleased with me, as You</p>  
 <p>have made me happy. And blessing of Allah be on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
 <p>and his purified progeny.</p>
