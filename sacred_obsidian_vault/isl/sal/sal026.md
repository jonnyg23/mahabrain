 <p>Another Elegy of Imam Ali (a.s.)</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O the one Who hears the supplication!</p>  
 <p>O the one Who has raised the heavens!</p>  
 <p>O the one Who is ever living!</p>  
 <p>O the one to bestow great bounties on the one</p>  
 <p>who is dependent and needy.</p>  
 <p>O the knower of the unseen!</p>  
 <p>O the Concealer of the unseen!</p>  
 <p>O the forgiver of sins!</p>  
 <p>O the averter of difficulties from the one who is</p>  
 <p>sorrowful and unhappy!</p>  
 <p>O the possessor of signs!</p>  
 <p>O the one to make vegetation grow!</p>  
 <p>O the one to gather the scattered ones!</p>  
 <p>O the one to give life to the rotten bones!</p>  
 <p>O the one Who from black and lightening clouds</p>  
 <p>sends water and smoke to the earth.</p>  
 <p>O the creator of skies together with the might,</p>  
 <p>which is illuminated by the shining of stars.</p>  
 <p>O the one Who opens the door to success!</p>  
 <p>O the one Who day and night blows the air</p>  
 <p>which brings the clouds!</p>  
 <p>O the one Who by the distinguished qualities</p>  
 <p>gathers the strength high and huge mountains</p>  
 <p>are set in the hard earth.</p>  
 <p>And O the leader of guidance and O the one to</p>  
 <p>inspire the mighty!</p>  
 <p>O the one Who sustains the creatures O the</p>  
 <p>one to enliven the inhabitants and the one to</p>  
 <p>dispel the sorrows.</p>  
 <p>And He in Whom I seek asylum and refuge,</p>  
 <p>Whose order prevails and I don't have courage</p>  
 <p>to run away from him, Who is great, most high</p>  
 <p>and gentle.</p>  
 <p>O the one to free the prisoners and O the one to</p>  
 <p>mend the broken hearts.</p>  
 <p>O the one Who makes the indigent,</p>  
 <p>self-sufficient.</p>  
 <p>O the one Who sustains the children and the</p>  
 <p>one Who cures the sick.</p>  
 <p>O the one from Whom strength is sought, O the</p>  
 <p>one through Whom dishonour and disgrace,</p>  
 <p>calamities and misfortunes are averted. Protect</p>  
 <p>me from sorrow and discomfort.</p>  
 <p>Protect me from men and jinns who make me</p>  
 <p>forget the Day of Judgment, which pains the</p>  
 <p>heart, and which diverts the soul from the</p>  
 <p>stoned Shaitan.</p>  
 <p>And O the one Who sustains the creatures</p>  
 <p>which comprises of men, animals and young</p>  
 <p>ones of birds they are also sustained and</p>  
 <p>clothed.</p>  
 <p>He is the possessor of pure knowledge.</p>  
 <p>O the owner of the destines whether obedient or</p>  
 <p>disobedient, no person is away from You</p>  
 <p>whether he is dead or alive.</p>  
 <p>O the best of the compensators and the one to</p>  
 <p>give happiness on faith and the one to enforce</p>  
 <p>Your laws, You are generous, wise.</p>  
 <p>O He Who has fully covered us, ward off</p>  
 <p>calamities from us. Whose kingdom is vast and</p>  
 <p>Who judges between good and evil deeds</p>  
 <p>equally.</p>  
 <p>O the one Who is aware of the actions.</p>  
 <p>O He Who hears the words, O He Who appoints</p>  
 <p>the destiny from the protected and familiar</p>  
 <p>justice.</p>  
 <p>O one Who hears, Whose creation i s</p>  
 <p>unparalleled, Whose throne is raised, Who is</p>  
 <p>protected from every tyrant and oppressor.</p>  
 <p>O the One Who gives asked, and whatever He</p>  
 <p>gave, gave nicely.</p>  
 <p>When He took care it was extremely high, Who</p>  
 <p>made everything clean and pure by the great</p>  
 <p>bounties.</p>  
 <p>O the refuge of the weak, O the redness of the</p>  
 <p>grievances.</p>  
 <p>O the subtle. You are great and high You are</p>  
 <p>generous and merciful on us, aware and kind to</p>  
 <p>us.</p>  
 <p>O He Who judges between the people with</p>  
 <p>truth, and the judgment is enforced on</p>  
 <p>everything in the universe, after which it is not</p>  
 <p>beneficial to save ourselves from death and</p>  
 <p>destruction.</p>  
 <p>Our Lord! You see us and we cannot see You.</p>  
 <p>There is no lord other than You, so guide us</p>  
 <p>towards You and don't set Your chastisement</p>  
 <p>on us only by Your protected Grace.</p>  
 <p>O the possessor of magnanimity. O the</p>  
 <p>possessor of Honour.</p>  
 <p>O the possessor of actions and the initiator.</p>  
 <p>Your kingdom is High.</p>  
 <p>O Lord, save me from Hell and from the great</p>  
 <p>fear and from its life and death and from its</p>  
 <p>eternal sorrow, from its hot water and make me</p>  
 <p>a companion of Quran, a resident of Heaven,</p>  
 <p>and husband of Houries.</p>  
 <p>Grant me refuge in the Heavens, those bounties</p>  
 <p>and pleasures in which there is no vulgarity, nor</p>  
 <p>any sorrow, nor lamentation, neither sickness</p>  
 <p>nor fatigue.</p>  
 <p>That pure abode where there wil l be no</p>  
 <p>hardship, which will be a pleasure for the</p>  
 <p>residents, and good news for the inhabitants</p>  
 <p>and a place of honour and repute. That high</p>  
 <p>place where beauty continues, which is</p>  
 <p>illuminated by bounties, a place of honour for</p>  
 <p>the generous.</p>  
 <p>That place where the carpet is spread, excellent</p>  
 <p>dresses, superb delicacies and cool refreshing</p>  
 <p>water.</p>  
 <p>O the one Who is above my every praise. I</p>  
 <p>plead You to bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and</p>  
 <p>the progeny of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and</p>  
 <p>whatever I have sought from You, don't turn</p>  
 <p>down anything but with Your grace increase the</p>  
 <p>bounties.</p>  
 <p>O Lord You have power over everything.</p>  
 <p>O He Who is more kind than anyone.</p>  
 <p>By Your mercy send blessings on our Prophet</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and His progeny.</p>
