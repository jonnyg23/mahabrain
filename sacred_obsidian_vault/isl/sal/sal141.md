 <p>With my witness that there is no god but Allah, the One with no</p>  
 <p>associate, I hope from Allah at the departure of the soul from my body to</p>  
 <p>keep my tongue perfect in its action of uttering words till my life ends</p>  
 <p>with good deeds. Accept this invocation, O the Lord of the Worlds!</p>
