 <p>His Dua expressing helplessness before the</p>  
 <p>Almighty</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! I ask You in the capacity of the one who is helpless and</p>  
 <p>powerless. I ask You as the one who is indigent and in troubles. I plead</p>  
 <p>as the one who is weak and I present myself as the one who is</p>  
 <p>degraded and is immersed in sins. I ask You as the one who has</p>  
 <p>pledged his soul to You sincerely, covered his face with dust, have put</p>  
 <p>his forehead in Your presence, whose tears flow continuously due to</p>  
 <p>Your fear, who is crying in Your presence, who has accepted his evil</p>  
 <p>deeds in Your presence, who has forgotten Your advice, all his</p>  
 <p>arguments are rendered useless. By the right of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)</p>  
 <p>and his progeny and by Your right which is great and is pertaining to</p>  
 <p>these Holy personalities, send blessings on them as per Your splendor</p>  
 <p>and send blessing on the progeny of Your Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and grant</p>  
 <p>me better than what You have granted to those believers who have</p>  
 <p>preceded me and better than that which You have given to other</p>  
 <p>believers, and better than that which You will be granting to Your</p>  
 <p>servants who will be born till the Day of Judgment all the goodness in</p>  
 <p>this world and the Hereafter. O Generous! Pardon my past sins in this</p>  
 <p>sitting and grant me help to abstain from sins in future, and grant me</p>  
 <p>Divine help to do Hajj and Umrah this year and that Hajj and Umrah,</p>  
 <p>which is accepted by You. O Generous One. And grant me this privilege</p>  
 <p>as long as I am alive. O Generous! O Generous! Help me in fulfilling the</p>  
 <p>needs of my family. Help me in fulfilling my duties and responsibilities</p>  
 <p>protect me from the mischief of the Arabs and non-Arabs. Save me from</p>  
 <p>the mischief of deviation from the jinns and the humans. Protect me from</p>  
 <p>the harm of every walking creature on the land as You are the Lord of</p>  
 <p>their destiny. Surely my Lord is on the right (truth) path.</p>
