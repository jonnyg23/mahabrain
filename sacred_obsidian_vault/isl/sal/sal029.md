 <p>His supplication on the 15th Shaban and</p>  
 <p>Thursday night (Dua-e-Kumail)</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny. O Allah! I</p>  
 <p>beseech You by Your mercy, which encompasses all things. And by</p>  
 <p>Your power by which You overcome all things and submit to it all things</p>  
 <p>and humble before it all things And by Your might by which You have</p>  
 <p>conquered all things And by Your majesty against which nothing can</p>  
 <p>stand up And by Your grandeur which prevails upon all things And by</p>  
 <p>Your authority which is exercised over all things And by Your own self</p>  
 <p>that shall endure forever after all things have vanished. And by Your</p>  
 <p>Names which manifest Your power over all things. And by Your</p>  
 <p>knowledge which pervades all things. And by the light of Your</p>  
 <p>countenance which illuminates everything. O You Who are the light! O</p>  
 <p>You Who are the most holy! O You Who existed before the first! O You</p>  
 <p>Who shall exist after the last! O Allah! Forgive me my such sins as</p>  
 <p>would affront my continency O Allah! Forgive me my such sins as would</p>  
 <p>bring down calamity O Allah! Forgive me my such sins as would change</p>  
 <p>divine favours (into calamities). O Allah! Forgive me my such sins as</p>  
 <p>would hinder my supplication. O Allah! Forgive me such sins as bring</p>  
 <p>down misfortunes (or afflictions). O Allah! Forgive my such sins as would</p>  
 <p>suppress hope. O Allah! Forgive every sin that I have committed and</p>  
 <p>every error that I have erred. O Allah! I endeavour to draw myself nigh to</p>  
 <p>You through Your invocation. And I pray to You to intercede on my</p>  
 <p>behalf. And I entreat You by Your benevolence to draw me nearer to</p>  
 <p>You. And grant me that I should be grateful to You and inspire me to</p>  
 <p>remember and to invoke You. O Allah! I entreat You begging You</p>  
 <p>submissively, humbly and awestricken to treat me with clemency and</p>  
 <p>mercy, and to make me pleased and contented with what You have</p>  
 <p>allotted to me. And cause me to be modest and unassuming in all</p>  
 <p>circumstances. O Allah! I beg You as one who is passing through</p>  
 <p>extreme privation and who supplicates his needs to You and his hope</p>  
 <p>has been greatly raised by that which is with You. O Allah! Great is Your</p>  
 <p>kingdom and exalted is Your greatness Your plan is secret, Your</p>  
 <p>authority is manifest, Your might is victorious and subduing and Your</p>  
 <p>power is prevalent throughout and it is not possible to escape from Your</p>  
 <p>dominion. O Allah! Except You I do not find anyone able to pardon my</p>  
 <p>sins nor to conceal my loathsome acts. Nor have I anyone except You to</p>  
 <p>change my evil deeds into virtues. There is no god but You, glory and</p>  
 <p>praise be to You. I have made my own soul to suffer. I had the audacity</p>  
 <p>(to sin) by my ignorance relying upon my past remembrance of You and</p>  
 <p>Your grace towards me. O Allah! My Lord! How many of my loathsome</p>  
 <p>acts have You screened (from public gaze). How many of my grievous</p>  
 <p>afflictions (distresses) have You reduced in severity. And how many of</p>  
 <p>my stumbling have You protected, how many of my detestable acts has</p>  
 <p>You averted, and how many of my undeserving praises have You</p>  
 <p>spread abroad! O Allah! My trials and sufferings have increased and my</p>  
 <p>evilness has worsened, my good deeds have diminished and my yokes</p>  
 <p>(of misdeeds) have become firm. And remote hopes restrain me to profit</p>  
 <p>(by good deeds) and the world has deceived me with its allurements and</p>  
 <p>my own self has been affected by treachery and procrastination.</p>  
 <p>Therefore, my Lord! I implore You by Your greatness not to let my sins</p>  
 <p>and my misdeeds shut out access to my prayers from reaching Your</p>  
 <p>realm and not to disgrace me by exposing those (hidden ones) of which</p>  
 <p>You have knowledge nor to hasten my retribution for those vices and</p>  
 <p>misdeeds committed by me in secret which were due to</p>  
 <p>evil-mindedness, ignorance, excessive lustfulness and my negligence. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! I beg You by Your greatness to be compassionate to me in all</p>  
 <p>circumstances and well disposed towards me in all matters. My God! My</p>  
 <p>Nourisher! Have I anyone except You from whom I can seek the</p>  
 <p>dislodging of my evils and understanding of my problems? My God! My</p>  
 <p>Master! You decreed a law for me but instead I obeyed my own low</p>  
 <p>desires. And I did not guard myself against the allurements of my enemy.</p>  
 <p>He deceived me with vain hopes whereby I was led astray and fate</p>  
 <p>helped him in that respect. Thus I transgressed some of its limits set for</p>  
 <p>me by You and I disobeyed some of Your commandments; You have</p>  
 <p>therefore a (just) cause against me in all those matters and I have no</p>  
 <p>plea against Your judgment passed against me. I have therefore become</p>  
 <p>(justifiably) liable to Your judgment and afflictions. But now I have turned</p>  
 <p>to You, my Lord, after being guilty of omissions and transgressions</p>  
 <p>against my soul, apologetically, repentantly, broken heartedly, entreating</p>  
 <p>earnestly for forgiveness, yieldingly confessing (to my guilt) as I can find</p>  
 <p>no escape from that which was done by me and having no refuge to</p>  
 <p>which I could turn except seeking Your acceptance of my excuse and</p>  
 <p>admitting me into the realm of Your capacious mercy. O Allah! Accept</p>  
 <p>my apology and have pity on my intense sufferings and set me free from</p>  
 <p>my heavy fetters (of evil deeds). My Nourisher! Have mercy on the</p>  
 <p>infirmity of my body, the delicacy of my skin and the brittleness of my</p>  
 <p>bones. O' You! Who originated my creation and (accorded me) my</p>  
 <p>individuality, and (ensured) my upbringing and welfare (and provided)</p>  
 <p>my sustenance (I beg You) to restore Your favours and blessings upon</p>  
 <p>me as You did in the beginning of my life. O' my God! My master! My</p>  
 <p>Lord! And my Nourisher! What! Will You see me punished with the fire</p>  
 <p>kindled by You despite my belief in Your unity? And despite the fact that</p>  
 <p>my heart has been filled with (pure) knowledge of You and when my</p>  
 <p>tongue has repeatedly praised You and my conscience has</p>  
 <p>acknowledged Your love and despite my sincere confessions (of my</p>  
 <p>sins) and my humble entreaties submissively made to Your divinity?</p>  
 <p>Nay, You are far too kind and generous to destroy one whom Yourself</p>  
 <p>nourished and supported, or to drive away from Yourself one whom You</p>  
 <p>have kept under Your protection, or to scare away one whom Yourself</p>  
 <p>have given shelter, or to abandon in affliction one You have maintained</p>  
 <p>and to whom You have been merciful. I wish I had known O' my Master,</p>  
 <p>my God and my Lord! Will You inflict fire upon faces which have</p>  
 <p>submissively bowed in prostration to Your greatness, or upon the</p>  
 <p>tongues which have sincerely confirmed Your unity and have always</p>  
 <p>expressed gratitude to You, or upon hearts which have acknowledged</p>  
 <p>Your divinity with conviction, or upon the minds which accumulated so</p>  
 <p>much knowledge of You until they became submissive to You, or upon</p>  
 <p>the limbs which strove, at the places appointed for Your worship, to</p>  
 <p>adore You willingly and seek Your forgiveness submissively? Such sort</p>  
 <p>(of harshness) is not expected from You as it is remote from Your grace,</p>  
 <p>O' generous one! O' Lord! You are aware of my weakness to bear even</p>  
 <p>a minor affliction of this world and its consequence and adversity</p>  
 <p>affecting the denizen of this earth, although such afflictions are</p>  
 <p>momentary, short-lived and transient. How then can I bear the</p>  
 <p>retributions and the punishments of the hereafter which are enormous</p>  
 <p>and of intensive sufferings, of prolonged period and perpetual duration,</p>  
 <p>and which shall never be alleviated for those who deserve the same as</p>  
 <p>those retributions will be the result of Your wrath; and Your punishment</p>  
 <p>which neither the heavens nor the earth can withstand and bear! My</p>  
 <p>Lord! How can I, a weak, insignificant, humble, poor and destitute</p>  
 <p>creature of Yours be able to bear them? O' my God! My Lord! My King!</p>  
 <p>And Master! Which of the matters shall I complain to You and for which</p>  
 <p>of them shall I bewail and weep? Shall I bewail for the pains and pangs</p>  
 <p>of the punishment and their intensity or for the length of sufferings and</p>  
 <p>their duration? Therefore (my Lord!) If You subject me to the penalties</p>  
 <p>(of hell) in company of Your enemies and cast me with those who</p>  
 <p>merited Your punishments and tear me apart from Your friends and</p>  
 <p>those who will be near to You, then my God, my Lord and my Master,</p>  
 <p>though I may patiently bear Your punishments, how can I calmly accept</p>  
 <p>being kept away from You? I reckon that though I may patiently endure</p>  
 <p>the scorching fire of Your hell, yet how can I resign myself to the denial</p>  
 <p>of Your pity and clemency? How can I remain in the fire while I have</p>  
 <p>hopes of Your forgiveness? O' my Lord! By Your honour truly do I swear</p>  
 <p>that, if You allow my power of speech to be retained by me in the hell, I</p>  
 <p>shall amongst its inmates cry out bewailing unto You like the cry of those</p>  
 <p>who have faith in Your kindness and compassion. And I shall bemoan for</p>  
 <p>You (for being deprived of nearness to You) the lamentation of those</p>  
 <p>who are bereaved, and I shall keep on calling unto You: "Where are You</p>  
 <p>O' Friend of the believers! O' (You Who are) the last hope and resort of</p>  
 <p>those who acknowledge You and have faith in Your clemency and</p>  
 <p>kindness; O' You Who are the helper of those seeking help! O' You Who</p>  
 <p>are dear to the hearts of those who truly believe in You! And O' You</p>  
 <p>Who are the Lord of the universe. "My Lord! Glory and praise be to You,</p>  
 <p>would You (wish) to be seen (disregarding) the voice of a Muslim</p>  
 <p>bondman, incarcerated therein (the hell) for his disobedience and</p>  
 <p>imprisoned within its pits for his evildoings and misdeeds, crying out to</p>  
 <p>You the utterance of one who has faith in Your mercy and calling out to</p>  
 <p>You in the language of those who believe in Your unity and seeking to</p>  
 <p>approach You by means of Your epithet "the Creator, the Nourisher, the</p>  
 <p>Accomplisher and the Protector of the entire existence"? My Lord! Then</p>  
 <p>how could he remain in torments when he hopefully relies upon Your</p>  
 <p>past forbearance, compassion and mercy? And how can the fire cause</p>  
 <p>him suffering when he hopes for Your grace and mercy and how can its</p>  
 <p>roaring flames char him when You hear his voice and see his plight?</p>  
 <p>And how can he withstand its roaring flames when You know his frailty?</p>  
 <p>And how can he be tossed about between its layers when You know his</p>  
 <p>sincerity? And how can the guards of hell threaten him when he calls out</p>  
 <p>to You? "My Lord", and how would You abandon him therein (the hell)</p>  
 <p>when he has faith in Your grace to set him free? Alas! That is not the</p>  
 <p>concept (held by us) of You nor has Your grace such a reputation nor</p>  
 <p>does it resemble that which You have awarded by Your kindness and</p>  
 <p>generosity to those who believe in Your unity. I definitely conclude that</p>  
 <p>had You not ordained punishment for those who disbelieved in You, and</p>  
 <p>had You not decreed Your enemies to remain in hell, You would have</p>  
 <p>made the hell cold and peaceful and there would never have been an</p>  
 <p>abode or place for anyone in it. But sanctified be Your Names, You have</p>  
 <p>sworn to fill the hell with the disbelievers from amongst the jinns and</p>  
 <p>mankind together and to place forever Your enemies therein. And You,</p>  
 <p>exalted be Your praises, had made manifest, out of Your generosity and</p>  
 <p>kindness, that a believer is not like unto him who is an evil-liver. My</p>  
 <p>Lord! My Master! I, therefore implore You by that power which You</p>  
 <p>determined and by the decree which You have finalized and ordained</p>  
 <p>whereby You have prevailed upon whom You have imposed it, to</p>  
 <p>bestow upon me this night and this very hour the forgiveness for all the</p>  
 <p>transgressions that I have been guilty of, for all the sins that I have</p>  
 <p>committed, for all the loathsome acts that I have kept secret and for all</p>  
 <p>the evils done by me, secretly or openly, in concealment or outwardly</p>  
 <p>and for every evil action that You have ordered the two noble scribes to</p>  
 <p>confirm whom You have appointed to record all my actions and to be</p>  
 <p>witnesses over me along with the limbs of my body, while You observe</p>  
 <p>over me besides them and was witness to those acts concealed from</p>  
 <p>them? Which You in Your mercy have kept secret and through Your</p>  
 <p>kindness unexposed and I pray to You to make my share plentiful in all</p>  
 <p>the good that You do bestow; in all the favours that You grant; and in all</p>  
 <p>the virtues that You allow to be known everywhere; and in all the</p>  
 <p>sustenance and livelihood that You expand and in respect of all the sins</p>  
 <p>that You forgive and the wrongs that You cover up. O' Lord! O' Lord! O'</p>  
 <p>Lord! O' my God! My Lord! My King! O' Master of my freedom! O' You</p>  
 <p>Who hold my destiny and Who are aware of my suffering and poverty, O'</p>  
 <p>You Who know my destitution and starvation, O' my Lord! O' Lord, O'</p>  
 <p>Lord! I beseech You by Your glory and Your honour, by Your supremely</p>  
 <p>high attributes and by Your names to cause me to utilise my time, day</p>  
 <p>and night, in Your remembrance, by engaging myself in serving You</p>  
 <p>(Your cause) and to let my deeds be such as to be acceptable to You,</p>  
 <p>so much so that all my actions and offerings (prayers) may be</p>  
 <p>transformed into one continuous and sustained effort and my life may</p>  
 <p>take the form of constant and perpetual service to You. O' my Master! O'</p>  
 <p>You upon Whom I rely! O' You unto Whom I express my distress! O' my</p>  
 <p>Lord! My Lord! My Lord! Strengthen my limbs for Your service and</p>  
 <p>sustain the strength of my hands to persevere in Your service and</p>  
 <p>bestow upon me the eagerness to fear You and constantly to serve You.</p>  
 <p>So that I may lead myself towards You in the field with the vanguards</p>  
 <p>who are in the fore rank and be swift towards You among those who</p>  
 <p>hasten towards You and urge eagerly to be near You and draw myself</p>  
 <p>towards You like them who sincerely draw themselves towards You and</p>  
 <p>to fear You like the fear of those who believe firmly in You and thus I</p>  
 <p>may join the congregation of the faithful congregated near You (for</p>  
 <p>protection). O' Allah! Whosoever intends evil against me, let ill befall on</p>  
 <p>him and frustrate him who plots against me and assign for me a place in</p>  
 <p>Your presence with the best of Your bondsmen and nearer abode to</p>  
 <p>You, for verily that position cannot be attained except through Your</p>  
 <p>grace and treat me benevolently, and through Your greatness extend</p>  
 <p>Your munificence towards me and through Your mercy protect me and</p>  
 <p>cause my tongue to accentuate Your remembrance and my heart filled</p>  
 <p>with Your love and be liberal to me by Your gracious response and</p>  
 <p>cause my evils to appear fewer and forgive me my errors. For verily, You</p>  
 <p>have ordained for Your bondsmen Your worship and bidden them to</p>  
 <p>supplicate unto You and have assured them (of Your) response. So, my</p>  
 <p>Lord! I look earnestly towards You and towards You, my Lord! I have</p>  
 <p>stretched forth my hands therefore, by Your honour, respond to my</p>  
 <p>supplication and let me attain my wishes and, by Your bounty, frustrate</p>  
 <p>not my hopes and protect me from the evils of my enemies, from among</p>  
 <p>the jinns and mankind. O' You! Who readily pleased, forgive one who</p>  
 <p>owns nothing but supplication for You does what You will. O' You!</p>  
 <p>Whose Name is the remedy (for all ills) and Whose remembrance is a</p>  
 <p>sure cure for all ailments and obedience to Whom makes one self</p>  
 <p>sufficient; have mercy on one whose only asset is hope and whose only</p>  
 <p>armour is lamentation. O' You! Who perfects all bounties and Who</p>  
 <p>wards off all misfortunes! O' Light! Who illuminates those who are in</p>  
 <p>bewilderment! O' Omniscient! Who knows without (acquisition of)</p>  
 <p>learning! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and the Descendants of</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and do unto me in accordance with that which</p>  
 <p>befits You, and deal with me not in accordance to my worth. May the</p>  
 <p>blessings of Allah be bestowed upon His Apostle and the Rightful Imams</p>  
 <p>from his Descendants and His peace be upon them plentifully.</p>
