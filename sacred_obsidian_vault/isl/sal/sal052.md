 <p>His supplication when sustenance becomes</p>  
 <p>scarce</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! So and so son of so and so does not have the strength to bear</p>  
 <p>the calamities nor to endure poverty. O Allah send blessing on</p>  
 <p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and do not cut down his</p>  
 <p>sustenance and do not curtail Your obligations on him. Do not make him</p>  
 <p>away from Your grace, do not make him unsuccessful from Your</p>  
 <p>uncountable bounties. Do not entrust him upon Your creatures nor leave</p>  
 <p>him upon himself because he would not be able to take care of himself.</p>  
 <p>On the contrary You Yourself ward off the troubles, which are</p>  
 <p>surrounding him. Only You guide him, be attentive on all his</p>  
 <p>transactions, because if You entrust him upon Your creatures, they</p>  
 <p>would not be able to benefit him, and if You leave him with his friends</p>  
 <p>then they will not give him his due and if they ever give, it will be very</p>  
 <p>less and if they do not give it would be nothing at all. And if they behave</p>  
 <p>miserly I would be affected. O Allah! Make so and so son of so and so</p>  
 <p>self-sufficient by Your grace and do not neglect him because he is</p>  
 <p>restless in Your presence, and he is fully dependent on the things,</p>  
 <p>which are in Your power, and are You unaware? You are fully aware</p>  
 <p>and knowing it. And whoever relies on Allah then it is sufficient for him</p>  
 <p>without any doubt Allah will fulfill his desires. Allah has appointed a fix</p>  
 <p>term for everyone. Surely every trouble is accompanied by ease. Surely</p>  
 <p>with every hardship there is ease, and whoever fears Allah, Allah makes</p>  
 <p>a way for him and he is bestowed from where he had least expected.</p>
