 <p>His supplication for the thirtieth of the</p>  
 <p>month</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny, and expand my</p>  
 <p>chest for Islam, and bless me with Imaan, and save me from the torment</p>  
 <p>of hell-fire. O Allah! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O the Holy! O Holy! I</p>  
 <p>beseech You with Your sublime name. There is no God but He, the</p>  
 <p>Real, Manifest, Ever-living, Self-subsisting, neither slumber nor sleep</p>  
 <p>seizes Him. His it is whatsoever is in the Heavens and whatsoever is in</p>  
 <p>the Earth; who is he that can intercede with Him save with His</p>  
 <p>permission. He knows what is before them and what is behind them,</p>  
 <p>while they cannot comprehend anything out of His knowledge, save that</p>  
 <p>which He wills. His Throne extends over the Heavens and the earth, and</p>  
 <p>the preservation of them both, tires Him not. And he is the Most High</p>  
 <p>and the Most Great. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny</p>  
 <p>among those of the ancient period, and bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and</p>  
 <p>his Progeny among those of the later period, and bless Muhammad</p>  
 <p>(s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny before the commencement of everything and</p>  
 <p>bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny at the end of everything,</p>  
 <p>and bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny during the day when it</p>  
 <p>shines, and bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny in the</p>  
 <p>Hereafter and in the world, and grant me my requests both in the</p>  
 <p>Hereafter and in the world. O the Ever-living! When no living being will</p>  
 <p>exist. O the Ever-living! When there was no living being existing. O the</p>  
 <p>Ever-living! There is no deity but You. O the Ever-living! O the</p>  
 <p>Self-subsisting! In the name of Your Mercy, I seek help from You, so</p>  
 <p>kindly succour me and improve my condition and leave me not alone to</p>  
 <p>myself, even for a wink of an eye. All praise is Allah's, the Lord of the</p>  
 <p>Worlds, the Beneficent, the Merciful. There is no associate with You. O</p>  
 <p>my Lord! You are Merciful towards me. I beseech You, O my Lord! In the</p>  
 <p>name of that with which Your Throne carries the Might of Your Glory, do</p>  
 <p>with me what befits You, and not in accordance with my entitlement, for</p>  
 <p>You are Worthy to be feared, and Worthy You are for seeking refuge. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! I praise You, and will continue to praise You forever with fresh</p>  
 <p>praises, and I rely on You alone, and seek forgiveness only from You.</p>  
 <p>And I bear witness that there is no god save You. May my life end with</p>  
 <p>such testifying, and so may I meet my Lord, and enter the grave with this</p>  
 <p>testifying, and remain in seclusion with such testifying. O Allah! I</p>  
 <p>beseech You for the ability to perform virtuous deed, and abstain from</p>  
 <p>evil deeds, and to love towards the poor . Forgive me and be</p>  
 <p>compassionate towards me. And You intend to involve any people with</p>  
 <p>afflictions or trial, kindly protect me from it and from every trial. And I</p>  
 <p>request You to bestow upon me love towards You, and love towards</p>  
 <p>those whom You love, and his love of him whose love brings me near</p>  
 <p>Your love. And I ask You to show me the way to refrain from my sins and</p>  
 <p>the way towards virtue. O Allah! I am one of Your creation and there are</p>  
 <p>rights on me due to Your creation. And between me and You, there are</p>  
 <p>rights on me due to You, but I am sinful. O Allah! Make Your creatures</p>  
 <p>pleased with me, regarding their rights over me, and forgive for all the</p>  
 <p>sins committed unto You. Bestow on me the good You may like to take</p>  
 <p>away from me. If You bestow not, the same will not be available with me.</p>  
 <p>You created me as You pleased, now make me such that You love.</p>  
 <p>Forgive us and have mercy on us. Relent our sins, and accept our</p>  
 <p>deeds, and cause us to enter Paradise, and save us from the fire, and</p>  
 <p>improve our life concessions. O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.), the</p>  
 <p>Ummi Prophet, as often as the number of people who invoke Your</p>  
 <p>Blessings for him, and also as often as the number of those who do not</p>  
 <p>invoke Your Blessings for him. Forgive us, have mercy on us, show</p>  
 <p>kindness to us, and accept our deeds. Verily, You are Oft-forgiving and</p>  
 <p>Merciful. O Allah! the Lord of the sacred House, the Lord of Rukn and</p>  
 <p>Maqaam, the Lord of Mash'aril Haraam, and the Lord of Hill and</p>  
 <p>Harame, convey to the soul of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.), Your Prophet, our</p>  
 <p>greetings. O Allah! The Lord of seven oft- repeated verses</p>  
 <p>(Surah-e-Hamd), and the glorious Quran, the Lord of Jibraeel, the Lord</p>  
 <p>of Mikaeel, the Lord of Israfeel, the Lord of all the Angles and all the</p>  
 <p>Creations! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny, and fulfill these</p>  
 <p>requests of mine. O Allah! I beseech You, O the Lord of seven Heavens!</p>  
 <p>O the Lord of seven earths, and of what is in them and in between them.</p>  
 <p>And I beseech You in the name of Yours with which You bestow</p>  
 <p>sustenance to the living, and with which You know the measurement of</p>  
 <p>the oceans and the reckoning of the sand particles, and through which</p>  
 <p>You cause death to the living, and through which You give life to the</p>  
 <p>dead and through which You honour the disgraced, and through which</p>  
 <p>You disgrace the honoured people, and through which You do what You</p>  
 <p>intend, and through which You command what You intend, and through</p>  
 <p>which You say to a thing "be" and there it is. O Allah! I beseech You with</p>  
 <p>Your most sublime name, You fulfill the needs of the seekers when they</p>  
 <p>request You with that name, and You respond to the call of those who</p>  
 <p>invoke You with it, and You afford protection to the seekers of protection</p>  
 <p>when they seek protection with it, and when those in distress call You</p>  
 <p>with it, You free them from their agony, and You accept the intercession</p>  
 <p>of those interceding with You through that name, and You rescue those</p>  
 <p>who seek help from You through that name, and bestow comforts on</p>  
 <p>them. And when the aggrieved calls at You through that name, You</p>  
 <p>listen to their calls, and succour them, and when the repentants present</p>  
 <p>themselves before You with that name, You accept their penitence. I</p>  
 <p>therefore beseech You with that name, O my Master and Lord! O my</p>  
 <p>Allah! O the Ever-living! O the Self-subsisting! O my Hope! O my</p>  
 <p>Shelter! O my Treasure! O my Store! O the Protection for me in my</p>  
 <p>Faith, world and Hereafter! With that mighty and most sublime name of</p>  
 <p>Yours, I invoke You for my sins which none can forgive save You, and</p>  
 <p>for my grief which none can allay save You, and for my sins whereby I</p>  
 <p>disobeyed You, and at the time of committing them, I felt no shame</p>  
 <p>before You. Here I come before You as miscreant and sinner with earth</p>  
 <p>straitened for me despite all its extensiveness, and with my faculty of</p>  
 <p>discernment lost, and fully aware that there is no escape for protection</p>  
 <p>anywhere save towards You, I am therefore before You, full y</p>  
 <p>surrounded by sins as destitute and needy, and I find none to forgive my</p>  
 <p>sins save You, and none to repair my loss save You, and I utter what</p>  
 <p>was uttered by Your bondsman Yunus when You caught him in the</p>  
 <p>darkness, with the hope that he be forgiven and freed by You from the</p>  
 <p>sins. There is no god save You. Glory be to You. Verily, I was of the</p>  
 <p>unjust ones. With Your greatest name to accept my prayer, and bestow</p>  
 <p>upon me my needs, and my aims, and hasten for me a period of ease</p>  
 <p>with perfect bounties, best of comforts, plenty of sustenance, and best of</p>  
 <p>residence, and keep me happy by the ever-flowing bounties. O Allah!</p>  
 <p>Grant me ability to offer my thanks to You for what You have given me,</p>  
 <p>and let this continue for the period You keep me alive, and forgive my</p>  
 <p>sins, my errors, my lavishment, and my crimes, when You take me away</p>  
 <p>from this world, let worldly bounties coalesce with the bounties of the</p>  
 <p>Hereafter. O Allah! Under Your control is the destination of the night and</p>  
 <p>day, heavens and Earth, sun and moon, and so also under Your control</p>  
 <p>is virtue and vice. O Allah! So please bless me in my faith, world,</p>  
 <p>Hereafter and in all my affairs. O Allah! Your promise is true, and so is</p>  
 <p>our attendance before You, there is no escape from it. (Request Allah</p>  
 <p>for the fulfillment of your needs.) O Allah! You have taken the</p>  
 <p>responsibility on Yourself to provide me and every living creature with</p>  
 <p>livelihood. O the Best to be invoked! O the Best to seek from! O the</p>  
 <p>Most Liberal Bestower! O the Best Centre of hopes! So kindly increase</p>  
 <p>sustenance for me and my family. O Allah! I beseech You to write in the</p>  
 <p>book of Your predestination, and decree of inevitable and wise affairs</p>  
 <p>which You decide in the Night of Power (Lailatul Qadr), and which</p>  
 <p>neither could be reversed nor could be changed, my name as one of the</p>  
 <p>pilgrims of Your sacred House, whose performances of the Pilgrim rites</p>  
 <p>are accepted, their efforts are appreciated, their sins are forgiven, their</p>  
 <p>misdeeds are erased, who have plenty of livelihood, their bodies are</p>  
 <p>healthy, and their fears are allayed, and prolong my life, increase my</p>  
 <p>sustenance, and bestow on me mental peace in affairs of the world and</p>  
 <p>of the Hereafter, which worry me presently and those to worry me in</p>  
 <p>future, and which worry my relatives, near or far. Verily, You are Most</p>  
 <p>Generous, Benevolent, Affectionate and Merciful. O the Creator!</p>  
 <p>Existing prior to the existence of everything, eyes sleep, the stars set</p>  
 <p>down, but You are ever-living, Self-subsisting, neither slumber nor sleep</p>  
 <p>overtakes You. Verily, You are subtle and All-aware. There is no might</p>  
 <p>and power but of Allah the High, the Sublime. All praise be for Allah, the</p>  
 <p>Lord of the Worlds! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure, purified,</p>  
 <p>chosen and virtuous Progeny, and greet them with worthy greetings.</p>
