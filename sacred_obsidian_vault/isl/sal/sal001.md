 <p align="center">Sahifa Alawiya</p>  
 <p align="center">By:</p>  
 <p align="center">Amirul Mo-mineen Ali Ibne Abi Talib (a.s.)</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>An Introduction</i></p>  
 <p>Seeing the usefulness of <i>Sahifa Kamila </i>- the collection of supplications of</p>  
 <p>Imam Zainul Aabedeen (a.s.), our scholars began to compile supplications of other</p>  
 <p>Masoomeen (a.s.). Abdullah bin Saleh Samahiji collected the supplications of Hazrat</p>  
 <p>Amirul Mo-mineen Ali Ibne Abi Talib (a.s.) and named the collection: <i>Sahifa</i></p>  
 <p><i>Alawiya</i>.</p>  
 <p>Other scholars also compiled their collections of Duas related from Imam</p>  
 <p>Ali (a.s.) but the collection that became most popular was that of Abdullah bin Saleh.</p>  
 <p>It had 160 Duas.</p>  
 <p><i>Sahifa Alawiya </i>was first published in 1305 A.H. (1887 A.D.) from Bombay.</p>  
 <p>Then from Majmaul Bahrayn Press, Ludhiana and after this in 1311 A.H. (1893 A.D.)</p>  
 <p>from Tehran. The fourth time it was published from Nizami Press, Lucknow with</p>  
 <p>translation and commentary in 1371 A.H. (1951 A.D.). But it is regretful that it did</p>  
 <p>not mention the sources.</p>  
 <p>The supplications of <i>Sahifa Alawiya </i>can be broadly divided into two</p>  
 <p>sections. The expression of Allah's slaveship and the entreaties of the supplicant.</p>  
 <p>Each of the supplications is a masterpiece of the expression of ones helplessness</p>  
 <p>before the grandeur of the Almighty and only a personality like Ali (a.s.) could have</p>  
 <p>composed such Duas.</p>  
 <p>The present English Version is based on the Urdu translation of <i>Sahifa</i></p>  
 <p><i>Alawiya </i>by Maulana Sayyid Murtuza Husain Lakhnavi, republished by Hyderi Kutub</p>  
 <p>Khana.</p>  
 <p>We have tried our best to make the translation conform to original Arabic</p>  
 <p>text, however if the readers find any aberration they are requested to inform us, so</p>  
 <p>that we can make the necessary changes in later editions.</p>
