 <p>(146)</p>  
 <p>His supplication for the twenty-third of the</p>  
 <p>month</p>  
 <p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
 <p>(The Hoopoe said) Verily! I found a woman ruling over them, and she</p>  
 <p>has been given plenty of everything, and she has a throne magnificent.</p>  
 <p>And I found her people prostrating in obedience to the Sun, besides</p>  
 <p>Allah, and to them Satan has made their deeds fair seeming, and thus</p>  
 <p>has turned them from the right way, so they are not guided aright that</p>  
 <p>they make not obedience to Allah, Who brings forth to light what is</p>  
 <p>hidden in the heavens and Earth, and what you hide and what you</p>  
 <p>manifest. Allah! There is no god but He. He is the Lord of the</p>  
 <p>Magnificent Throne! So they will be told: taste you the recompense for</p>  
 <p>what you had forgotten the meeting of this day of yours, verily, We too</p>  
 <p>forgot you and taste you the abiding chastisement for what you were</p>  
 <p>doing. Verily, only those who believe in Our signs, when they are</p>  
 <p>reminded of them, fall down prostrating in obedience and glorify the</p>  
 <p>praise of their Lord and they exalt not with pride. There sides forsake</p>  
 <p>their beds getting away from their beds overnight, praying to their Lord</p>  
 <p>in fear and in hope, and of what We provide them with they spend</p>  
 <p>benevolently in the way of their Lord. And any soul knows not what is</p>  
 <p>hidden for them the righteous ones of the joy of the eyes in recompense</p>  
 <p>for what good they were doing. O Allah! Make me of those for whom the</p>  
 <p>gardens of bliss shall be the eternal abode as an entertainment for what</p>  
 <p>good they were doing. Said David: Indeed he has been unjust to you in</p>  
 <p>demanding your ewe to add her to his own ewes. Verily, many of the</p>  
 <p>associates act wrongfully to one another save those who believe and do</p>  
 <p>good deeds and few are they. And David perceived that We had tried</p>  
 <p>him so he asked forgiveness of his Lord and he fell down bowing and</p>  
 <p>oft-turning himself to Us. And among His signs are the night and the day,</p>  
 <p>the Sun and the moon; Prostrate not you in obedience to Sun nor to the</p>  
 <p>moon but prostrate you in obedience to Allah alone Who created them,</p>  
 <p>you worship, Him. O Allah! You are forgiver, Merciful and I am a</p>  
 <p>miscreant sinner. O Allah! You are Bestower and I am seeker. O Allah!</p>  
 <p>You are Everlasting and I am mortal. O Allah! You are Needless and I</p>  
 <p>am needy. O Allah! You are the Creator and I am the created. O Allah!</p>  
 <p>You are Master and I am the servant. O Allah! Turn away from us the</p>  
 <p>torment of Hell, verily the torment of it is a lasting affliction. Verily it is an</p>  
 <p>evil abode and an evil station. We heard and obey. We seek forgiveness</p>  
 <p>from You. O our Lord! To You is the return. O my Lord! Increase me in</p>  
 <p>knowledge and disgrace me not on the day when people will be raised</p>  
 <p>from the graves for reckoning. O my Lord! Cause me to enter a goodly</p>  
 <p>entrance and cause me to go out of a goodly exit and grant me from You</p>  
 <p>an authority to assist me. O my Lord! Disembark me with a blessed</p>  
 <p>landing or You are the best of all who cause to land. O my Lord! Expand</p>  
 <p>for me my chest and make easy for me my task. O our Lord! Forgive us</p>  
 <p>and our brethren who have preceded us in faith and create not in our</p>  
 <p>hearts any ill-will towards those who believe. O our Lord! Verily You are</p>  
 <p>Ever-kind, the All merciful. O our Lord! And turn to us mercifully, for</p>  
 <p>verily You and only You are Oft-returning and Most Merciful. And have</p>  
 <p>mercy on us, and guide us to the right path, and forgive us, and make us</p>  
 <p>happy in the last part of our age, and end it with the best of</p>  
 <p>performances, and the best of our days be the day we present ourselves</p>  
 <p>before You, and make our end a happy end. O the Ever-living! O the</p>  
 <p>Self-subsisting! Verily I present my complaints before You for Your</p>  
 <p>Mercy, O the Dispeller of distress! O the Remover of worries! O the</p>  
 <p>Answerer of the invocation of those in distress, You are the beneficent in</p>  
 <p>this world and in the Hereafter and also the Most Merciful. Have mercy</p>  
 <p>on me by fulfilling all my needs with affection so as to make me needless</p>  
 <p>of others than You. O Allah! I cannot get what I wish nor can I dispel that</p>  
 <p>of which I fear except through You. The whole affair is within You</p>  
 <p>control. I need Your forgiveness and the whole of Your creation depends</p>  
 <p>on You and none is more needy towards You than I am. O Allah! I</p>  
 <p>became guided with Your light and through Your favours I became</p>  
 <p>independent of others, and with Your Blessings I enter upon the morning</p>  
 <p>and evening. My sins are clear before You. I beseech Your forgiveness</p>  
 <p>from them and turn penitent to You. O Allah! Let the deceit of the person</p>  
 <p>of whom I fear harm him. I seek protection from You against his mischief</p>  
 <p>and beseech Your help against him. There is no god save You. Glory be</p>  
 <p>to You. I was of the unjust ones. O Allah! I request You to bestow upon</p>  
 <p>me a pleasant life, a happy end and successful non-disgracing return. O</p>  
 <p>Allah! I seek refuge with You from disgracing or being disgraced, from</p>  
 <p>misleading or being misled, from being unjust to anyone or anyone</p>  
 <p>becoming unjust to me, and from my foolish action or be a prey to such</p>  
 <p>an action by others, O the Master of the Magnificent Throne and Eternal</p>  
 <p>good! You are hallowed and sublime, O the Most Merciful! May Allah</p>  
 <p>bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his purified Progeny.</p>
