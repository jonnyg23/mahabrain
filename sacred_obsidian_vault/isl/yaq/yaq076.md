 <p><a name="page_1655"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1655</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">Sura LXXVI.</h3>  <h3 align="center"><i>Dahr,</i> or Time, or <i>Insān,</i> or Man.</h3>  
 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
 <p>1. Has there not been<br> Over Man a long period<br> Of Time, when he was<br> Nothing—(not even) mentioned?</p>  
 <p>2. Verily We created<br> Man from a drop<br> Of mingled sperm,<br> In order to try him:<br> So We gave him (the gifts).<br> Of Hearing and Sight.</p>  
 <p>3. We showed him, the Way:<br> Whether he be grateful<br> Or ungrateful (rests<br> On his will).</p>  
 <p>4. For the Rejecters<br> We have prepared</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1656"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1656</font></a></p>  
 <p>Chains, Yokes, and<br> A Blazing Fire.</p>  
 <p>5. As to the Righteous,<br> They shall drink<br> Of a Cup (of Wine)<br> Mixed with Kāfūr,—</p>  
 <p>6. A Fountain where<br> The Devotees of God<br> Do drink, making it<br> Flow in unstinted abundance.</p>  
 <p>7. They perform (their) vows,<br> And they fear a Day<br> Whose evil flies far and wide.</p>  
 <p>8. And they feed, for the love<br> Of God, the indigent,<br> The orphan, and the captive,—</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1657"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1657</font></a></p>  
 <p>9. (Saying), "We feed you<br> For the sake of God alone:<br> No reward do we desire<br> From you, nor thanks.</p>  
 <p>10. "We only fear a Day<br> Of distressful Wrath<br> From the side of our Lord."</p>  
 <p>11. But God will deliver<br> Them from the evil<br> Of that Day, and will<br> Shed over them a Light<br> Of Beauty and<br> A (blissful) Joy.</p>  
 <p>12. And because they were<br> Patient and constant, He will<br> Reward them with a Garden<br> And (garments of) silk.</p>  
 <p>13. Reclining in the (Garden)<br> On raised thrones,<br> They will see there neither<br> The sun's (excessive heat)<br> Nor (the moon's) excessive cold.</p>  
 <p>14. And the shades of the (Garden)<br> Will come low over them,<br> And the bunches (of fruit),<br> There, will hang low<br> In humility.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1658"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1658</font></a></p>  
 <p>15. And amongst them will be<br> Passed round vessels of silver<br> And goblets of crystal,—</p>  
 <p>16. Crystal-clear, made of silver:<br> They will determine<br> The measure thereof<br> (According to their wishes).</p>  
 <p>17. And they will be given<br> To drink there of a Cup<br> (Of Wine) mixed <br> With Zanjaḅīl,—</p>  
 <p>18. A fountain there,<br> Called Salsabīl.</p>  
 <p>19. And round about them<br> Will (serve) youths<br> Of perpetual (freshness):<br> If thou seest them,<br> Thou wouldst think them<br> Scattered Pearls.</p>  
 <p>20. And when thou lookest,<br> It is there thou wilt see</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1659"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1659</font></a></p>  
 <p>A Bliss and<br> A Realm Magnificent.</p>  
 <p>21. Upon them will be<br> Green Garments of fine silk<br> And heavy brocade,<br> And they will be adorned<br> With Bracelets of silver;<br> And their Lord will<br> Give to them to drink<br> Of a Wine<br> Pure and Holy.</p>  
 <p>22. "Verily this is a Reward<br> For you, and your Endeavour<br> Is accepted and recognised."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>23. It is We Who<br> Have sent down the Qur-ān<br> To thee by stages.</p>  
 <p>24. Therefore be patient<br> With constancy to the Command<br> Of thy Lord, and hearken not<br> To the sinner or the ingrate<br> Among them.</p>  
 <p>25. And celebrate the name</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1660"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1660</font></a></p>  
 <p>Of thy Lord morning<br> And evening,</p>  
 <p>26. And part of the night,<br> Prostrate thyself to Him;<br> And glorify Him<br> A long night through.</p>  
 <p>27. As to these, they love<br> The fleeting life,<br> And put away behind them<br> A Day (that will be) hard.</p>  
 <p>28. It is We Who created<br> Them, and We have made<br> Their joints strong;<br> But, when We will,<br> We can substitute<br> The like of them<br> By a complete change.</p>  
 <p>29. This is an admonition:<br> Whosoever will, let him<br> Take a (straight) Path<br> To his Lord.</p>  
 <p>30. But ye will not,<br> Except as God wills;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1661"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1661</font></a></p>  
 <p>For God is full of<br> Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>  
 <p>31. He will admit<br> To His Mercy Whom He will;<br> But the wrong-doers,—<br> For them has He prepared<br> A grievous Penalty.</p>
