 <p><a name="page_1002"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1002</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">Sūra XXVIII.</h3>  <h3 align="center"><i>Qaṣaṣ</i>, or the Narration.</h3>  
 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful</i>.</p>  
 <p>1. <i>Tā</i>. <i>Sīn</i>. <i>Mīm</i>.</p>  
 <p>2. These are Verses of the Book<br> That makes (things) clear.</p>  
 <p>3. We rehearse to thee some<br> Of the story of Moses<br> And Pharaoh in Truth,<br> For people who believe.</p>  
 <p>4. Truly Pharaoh elated himself<br> In the land and broke up<br> Its people into sections,<br> Depressing a small group<br> Among them: their sons he slew,<br> But he kept alive their females:<br> For he was indeed<br> A maker of mischief.</p>  
 <p>5. And We wished to be<br> Gracious to those who were<br> Being depressed in the land,<br> To make them leaders (in faith)<br> And make them heirs,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1003"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1003</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. To establish a firm place<br> For them in the land,<br> And to show Pharaoh, Haman,<br> And their hosts, at their hands,<br> The very things against which<br> They were taking precautions.</p>  
 <p>7. So We sent this inspiration<br> To the mother of Moses:<br> "Suckle (thy child), but when<br> Thou hast fears about him,<br> Cast him into the river,<br> But fear not nor grieve:<br> For We shall restore him<br> To thee, and We shall make<br> Him one of Our apostles."</p>  
 <p>8. Then the people of Pharaoh<br> Picked him up (from the river):<br> (It was intended) that (Moses)<br> Should be to them an adversary<br> And a cause of sorrow:<br> For Pharaoh and Haman<br> And (all) their hosts were<br> Men of sin.</p>  
 <p>9. The wife of Pharaoh said:<br> "(Here is) a joy of the eye,'<br> For me and for thee:<br> Slay him not. It may be</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1004"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1004</font></a></p>  
 <p>That he will be of use<br> To us, or we may adopt<br> Him as a son." And they<br> Perceived not (what they<br> Were doing)!</p>  
 <p>10. But there came to be<br> A void in the heart<br> Of the mother of Moses:<br> She was going almost to<br> Disclose his (case), had We<br> Not strengthened her heart<br> (With faith), so that she<br> Might remain a (firm) believer.</p>  
 <p>11. And she said to the sister<br> Of (Moses), "Follow him".<br> So she (the sister) watched him<br> In the character of a stranger.<br> And they knew not.</p>  
 <p>12. And We ordained that he<br> Refused suck at first, until<br> (His sister came up<br> And) said: "Shall I<br> Point out to you the people<br> Of a house that will nourish<br> And bring him up for you'"<br> And be sincerely attached<br> To him?"...</p>  
 <p>13. Thus did We restore him<br> To his mother, that her eye<br> Might be comforted, that she<br> Might not grieve, and that<br> She might know that the promise<br> Of God is true: but<br> Most of them do not understand.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1005"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1005</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>14. When he reached full age,<br> And was firmly established<br> (In life), We bestowed on him<br> Wisdom and knowledge: for thus<br> Do We reward those<br> Who do good.</p>  
 <p>15. And he entered the City<br> At a time when its people<br> Were not watching: and he<br> Found there two men fighting,—<br> One of his own religion,<br> And the other, of his foes.<br> Now the man of his own<br> Religion appealed to him<br> Against his foe, and Moses<br> Struck him with his fist<br> And made an end of him.<br> He said: "This is a work<br> Of Evil (Satan): for he is<br> An enemy that manifestly<br> Misleads!"</p>  
 <p>16. He prayed: "O my Lord!<br> I have indeed wronged my soul!<br> Do Thou then forgive me!"<br> So (God) forgave him: for He<br> Is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1006"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1006</font></a></p>  
 <p>17. He said: "O my Lord!<br> For that Thou hast bestowed<br> Thy Grace on me, never<br> Shall I be a help<br> To those who sin!"</p>  
 <p>18. So he saw the morning<br> In the City, looking about,<br> In a state of fear, when<br> Behold, the man who had,<br> The day before, sought his help<br> Called aloud for his help<br> (Again). Moses said to him:<br> "Thou art truly, it is clear,<br> A quarrelsome fellow!"</p>  
 <p>19. Then, when he decided to lay<br> Hold of the man who was<br> An enemy to both of them,<br> That man said: "O Moses!<br> Is it thy intention to slay me<br> As thou slewest a man<br> Yesterday? Thy intention is<br> None other than to become<br> A powerful violent man<br> In the land, and not to be<br> One who sets things right!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1007"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1007</font></a></p>  
 <p>20. And there came a man,<br> Running, from the furthest end<br> Of the City. He said:<br> "O Moses! the Chiefs<br> Are taking counsel together<br> About thee, to slay thee:<br> So get thee away, for I<br> Do give thee sincere advice."</p>  
 <p>21. He therefore got away therefrom,<br> Looking about, in a state<br> Of fear. He prayed:<br> "O my Lord! save me<br> From people given to wrong-doing."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
 <p>22. When, when he turned his face<br> Towards (the land of) Madyan,<br> He said: "I do hope<br> That my Lord will show me<br> The smooth and straight Path."</p>  
 <p>23. And when he arrived at<br> The watering (place) in Madyan;<br> He found there a group<br> Of men watering (their flocks),<br> And besides them he found<br> Two women who were keeping</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1008"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1008</font></a></p>  
 <p>Back (their flocks). He said:<br> "What is the matter with you?"<br> They said: "We cannot water<br> (Our flocks) until the shepherds<br> Take back (their flocks):<br> And our father is<br> A very old man."</p>  
 <p>24. So he watered (their flocks)<br> For them; then he turned back<br> To the shade, and said:<br> "O my Lord!<br> Truly am I<br> In (desperate) need<br> Of any good<br> That Thou dost send me!"</p>  
 <p>25. Afterwards one of the (damsels)<br> Came (back) to him, walking<br> Bashfully. She said: "My father<br> Invites thee that he may<br> Reward thee for having watered<br> (Our flocks) for us." So when<br> He came to him and narrated<br> The story, he said:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1009"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1009</font></a></p>  
 <p>"Fear thou not: (well) hast thou<br> Escaped from unjust people."</p>  
 <p>26. Said one of the (damsels):<br> "O my (dear) father! engage<br> Him on wages: truly the best<br> Of men for thee to employ is<br> The (man) who is strong and trusty"…</p>  
 <p>27. He said: "I intend to wed<br> One of these my daughters<br> To thee, on, condition that<br> Thou serve me for eight years;<br> But if thou complete ten years,<br> It will be (grace) from thee.<br> But I intend not to place<br> Thee under a difficulty:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1010"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1010</font></a></p>  
 <p>Thou wilt find me,<br> Indeed, if God wills,<br> One of the righteous."</p>  
 <p>28. He said: "Be that (the agreement)<br> Between me and thee:<br> Whichever of the two terms<br> I fulfil, let there be<br> No ill-will to me.<br> Be God a witness<br> To what we say."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
 <p>29. Now when Moses had fulfilled<br> The term, and was travelling<br> With his family, he perceived<br> A fire in the direction<br> Of Mount Ṭūr. He said<br> To his family: "Tarry ye;<br> I perceive a fire; I hope<br> To bring you from there<br> Some information, or a burning<br> Firebrand, that ye may<br> Warm yourselves."</p>  
 <p>30. But when he came<br> To the (Fire), a voice</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1011"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1011</font></a></p>  
 <p>Was heard from the right bank<br> Of the valley, from a tree<br> In hallowed ground:<br> "O Moses! Verily<br> I am God, the Lord<br> Of the Worlds…</p>  
 <p>31. "Now do thou throw thy rod!"<br> But when he saw it<br> Moving (of its own accord)<br> As if it had been a snake,<br> He turned back in retreat,<br> And retraced not his steps:<br> "O Moses!" (it was said),<br> "Draw near, and fear not:<br> For thou art of those<br> Who are secure.</p>  
 <p>32. "Move thy hand into<br> Thy bosom, and it will<br> Come forth white without stain<br> (Or harm), and draw thy hand<br> Close to thy side<br> (To guard) against fear.<br> Those are the two credentials<br> From thy Lord to Pharaoh<br> And his Chiefs: for truly<br> They are a people<br> Rebellious and wicked."</p>  
 <p>33. He said: "O my Lord!<br> I have slain a man</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1012"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1012</font></a></p>  
 <p>Among them, and I fear<br> Lest they slay me.</p>  
 <p>34. "And my brother Aaron—<br> He is more eloquent in speech<br> Than I: so send him<br> With me as a helper,<br> To confirm (and strengthen) me:<br> For I fear that they may<br> Accuse me of falsehood."</p>  
 <p>35. He said: "We will certainly<br> Strengthen thy arm through<br> Thy brother, and invest you both<br> With authority, so they<br> Shall not be able to<br> Touch you: with Our Signs<br> Shall ye triumph,—you two<br> As well as those<br> Who follow you."</p>  
 <p>36. When Moses came to them<br> With Our Clear Signs, they said:<br> "This is nothing but sorcery<br> Faked up: never did we<br> Hear the like among our fathers<br> Of old!"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1013"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1013</font></a></p>  
 <p>37. Moses said: "My Lord<br> Knows best who it is<br> That comes with guidance<br> From Him and whose End<br> Will be best in the Hereafter:<br> Certain it is that<br> The wrong-doers will not prosper."</p>  
 <p>38. Pharaoh said: "O Chiefs!<br> No god do I know for you<br> But myself: therefore,<br> O Haman! light me a (kiln<br> To bake bricks) out of clay,<br> And build me a lofty<br> Palace, that I may mount up<br> To the god of Moses:<br> But as far as I am concerned,<br> I think (Moses) is a liar!"</p>  
 <p>39. And he was arrogant and insolent<br> In the land, beyond reason,—<br> He and his hosts: they thought<br> That they would not have<br> To return to Us!"</p>  
 <p>40. So We seized him<br> And his hosts, and We<br> Flung them into the sea:<br> Now behold what was the End<br> Of those who did wrong!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1014"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1014</font></a></p>  
 <p>41. And We made them (but)<br> Leaders inviting to the Fire;<br> And on the Day of Judgment<br> No help shall they find.</p>  
 <p>42. In this world We made<br> A Curse to follow them:<br> And on the Day of Judgment<br> They will be among<br> The loathed (and despised).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
 <p>43. We did reveal to Moses<br> The Book after We had<br> Destroyed the earlier generations,<br> (To give) Insight to men,<br> And Guidance and Mercy,<br> That they might receive admonition.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1015"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1015</font></a></p>  
 <p>44. Thou wast not on the Western<br> Side when We decreed<br> The Commission to Moses,<br> Nor wast thou a witness<br> (Of those events).</p>  
 <p>45. But We raised up (new)<br> Generations, and long were the ages<br> That passed over them;<br> But thou vast not a dweller<br> Among the people of Madyan,<br> Rehearsing Our Signs to them;<br> But it is We Who send<br> Apostles (with inspiration).</p>  
 <p>46. Nor wast thou at the side<br> Of (the Mountain of) Ṭūr<br> When We called (to Moses).<br> Yet (art thou sent)<br> As a Mercy from thy Lord,<br> To give warning to a people<br> To whom no warner had come<br> Before thee: in order that<br> They may receive admonition.</p>  
 <p>47. If (We had) not (sent thee<br> To the Quraish),—in case<br> A calamity should seize them<br> For (the deeds) that their hands<br> Have sent forth, they might say:<br> "Our Lord! why didst Thou not</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1016"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1016</font></a></p>  
 <p>Send us an apostle? We<br> Should then have followed<br> Thy Signs and been amongst<br> Those who believe!"</p>  
 <p>48. But (now), when the Truth<br> Has come to them from Ourselves,<br> They say, "Why are not<br> (Signs) sent to him, like<br> Those which were sent to Moses?"<br> Do they not then reject<br> (The Signs) which were formerly<br> Sent to Moses? They say: <br> "Two kinds of sorcery,<br> Each assisting the other .<br> And they say: "For us,<br> We reject all (such things)!"</p>  
 <p>49. Say: "Then bring ye<br> A Book from God,<br> Which is a better Guide<br> Than either of them,<br> That I may follow it!<br> (Do), if ye are truthful!"</p>  
 <p>50. But if they hearken not<br> To thee, know that they<br> Only follow their own lusts:<br> And who is more astray<br> Than one who follows his own<br> Lusts, devoid of guidance<br> From God? For God guides not<br> People given to wrong-doing.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1017"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1017</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
 <p>51. Now have We caused<br> The Word to reach them<br> Themselves, in order that<br> They may receive admonition.</p>  
 <p>52. Those to whom We sent<br> The Book before this,—they<br> Do believe in this (Revelation);</p>  
 <p>53. And when it is recited<br> To them, they say: "We<br> Believe therein, for it is<br> The Truth from our Lord:<br> Indeed we have been Muslims<br> (Bowing to God's Will)<br> From before this.</p>  
 <p>54. Twice will they be given<br> Their reward, for that they<br> Have persevered, that they avert<br> Evil with Good, and that<br> They spend (in charity) out of<br> What We have given them.</p>  
 <p>55. And when they hear vain talk,<br> They turn away therefrom<br> And say: "To us our deeds,<br> And to you yours;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1018"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1018</font></a></p>  
 <p>Peace be to you: we<br> Seek not the ignorant."</p>  
 <p>56. It is true thou wilt not<br> Be able to guide every one;<br> Whom thou lowest; but God<br> Guides those whom He will.<br> And He knows best those<br> Who receive guidance.</p>  
 <p>57. They say: "If we were<br> To follow the guidance with thee,<br> We should be snatched away<br> From our land." Have We not<br> Established for them a secure<br> Sanctuary, to which are brought<br> As tribute fruits of all kinds,—<br> A provision from Ourselves?<br> But most of them understand not.</p>  
 <p>58. And how many populations<br> We destroyed, which exulted<br> In their life (of ease and plenty)!<br> Now those habitations of theirs,<br> After them, are deserted,—<br> All but a (miserable) few!<br> And We are their heirs!"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1019"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1019</font></a></p>  
 <p>59. Nor was thy Lord the one<br> To destroy a population until<br> He had sent to its Centre<br> An apostle, rehearsing to them<br> Our Signs; nor are We<br> Going to destroy a population<br> Except when its members<br> Practise iniquity.</p>  
 <p>60. The (material) things which<br> Ye are given are but<br> The conveniences of this life<br> And the glitter thereof;<br> But that which is with God<br> Is better and more enduring:<br> Will ye not then be wise?</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 7.</h5>  
 <p>61. Are (these two) alike?—<br> One to whom We have made<br> A goodly promise, and who<br> Is going to reach its (fulfilment),<br> And one to whom We have<br> Given the good things of this<br> Life, but who, on the Day<br> Of Judgment, is to be among<br> Those brought up (for punishment)?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1020"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1020</font></a></p>  
 <p>62. That Day (God) will<br> Call to them, and say:<br> "Where are My 'partners'?—<br> Whom ye imagined (to be such)?"</p>  
 <p>63. Those against whom the charge<br> Will be proved, will say:<br> "Our Lord! These are the ones<br> Whom we led astray:<br> We led them astray, as we<br> Were astray ourselves: we free<br> Ourselves (from them) in Thy presence:<br> It was not us they worshipped."</p>  
 <p>64. It will be said (to them):<br> "Call upon your 'partners'<br> (For help)": they will call<br> Upon them, but they will not<br> Listen to them; and they<br> Will see the Penalty (before them);<br> (How they will wish)<br> 'If only they had been<br> Open to guidance!'</p>  
 <p>65. That Day (God) will<br> Call to them, and say:<br> "What was the answer<br> Ye gave to the apostles?"</p>  
 <p>66. Then the (whole) story that day<br> Will seem obscure to them<br> (Like light to the blind)<br> And they will not be able<br> (Even) to question each other.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1021"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1021</font></a></p>  
 <p>67. But any that (in this life)<br> Had repented, believed, and worked<br> Righteousness, will have hopes<br> To be among those who<br> Achieve salvation.</p>  
 <p>68. Why by Lord does create and choose<br> As He pleases: no choice<br> Have they (in the matter):<br> Glory to God! and far<br> Is He above the partners<br> They ascribe (to Him)!</p>  
 <p>69. And thy Lord knows all<br> That their hearts conceal<br> And all that they reveal.</p>  
 <p>70. And He is God: there is<br> No god. but He. To Him<br> Be praise, at the first<br> And at the last:<br> For Him is the Command,<br> And to Him shall ye<br> (All) be brought back.</p>  
 <p>71. Say: See ye? If God<br> Were to make the Night</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1022"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1022</font></a></p>  
 <p>Perpetual over you to the Day<br> Of Judgment, what god<br> Is there other than God,<br> Who can give you enlightenment?<br> Will ye not then hearken?</p>  
 <p>72. Say: See ye? If God<br> Were to make the Day<br> Perpetual over you to the Day<br> Of Judgment, what god<br> Is there other than God,<br> Who can give you a Night<br> In which ye can rest?<br> Will ye not then see?</p>  
 <p>73. It is out of His Mercy<br> That He has made for you<br> Night and Day,—that ye<br> May rest therein, and that<br> Ye may seek of His Grace;—<br> And in order that ye<br> May be grateful.</p>  
 <p>74. The Day that He will<br> Call on them, He will say:<br> "Where are My 'partners'?—<br> Whom ye imagined (to be such)?"</p>  
 <p>75. And from each people<br> Shall We draw a witness,<br> And We shall say: "Produce<br> Your Proof": then shall they<br> Know that the Truth is in<br> God (alone), and the (lies)<br> Which they invented will<br> Leave them in the lurch.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1023"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1023</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 8.</h5>  
 <p>76. Qārūn was doubtless,<br> Of the people of Moses; but<br> He acted insolently towards them:<br> Such were the treasures We<br> Had bestowed on him, that<br> Their very keys would<br> Have been a burden to<br> A body of strong men.<br> Behold, his people said to him:<br> "Exult not, for God loveth not<br> Those who exult (in riches).</p>  
 <p>77. "But seek, with the (wealth)<br> Which God has bestowed on thee,<br> The Home of the Hereafter,<br> Nor forget thy portion in this</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1024"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1024</font></a></p>  
 <p>World: but do thou good,<br> As God has been good<br> To thee, and seek not<br> (Occasions for) mischief in the land:<br> For God loves not those<br> Who do mischief."</p>  
 <p>78. He said: "This has been given<br> To me because of a certain<br> Knowledge which I have."<br> Did he not know that God<br> Had destroyed, before him,<br> (Whole) generations,—which were<br> Superior to him in strength<br> And greater in the amount<br> (Of riches) they had collected?<br> But the wicked are not<br> Called (immediately) to account<br> For their sins.</p>  
 <p>79. So he went forth among<br> His people in the (pride<br> Of his worldly) glitter.<br> Said those whose aim is<br> The Life of this World:<br> "Oh! that we had the like<br> Of what Qārūn has got!<br> For he is truly a lord<br> Of mighty good fortune!"</p>  
 <p>80. But those who had been granted<br> (True) knowledge said: "Alas<br> For you! The reward of God<br> (In the Hereafter) is best<br> For those who believe<br> And work righteousness: but this</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1025"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1025</font></a></p>  
 <p>None shall attain, save those<br> Who steadfastly persevere<br> (in good)."</p>  
 <p>81. Then We caused the earth<br> To swallow up him and<br> His house; and he had not<br> (The least little) party<br> To help him against God,<br> Nor could he defend himself.</p>  
 <p>82. And those who had envied<br> His position the day before<br> Began to say on the morrow:<br> "Ah! It is indeed God<br> Who enlarges the provision"'<br> Or restricts it, to any<br> Of His servants He pleases!<br> Had it not been that God<br> Was gracious to us, He<br> Could have caused the earth<br> To swallow us up! Ah!<br> Those who reject God<br> Will assuredly never prosper."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 9.</h5>  
 <p>83. What Home of the Hereafter<br> We shall give to those<br> Who intend not high-handedness<br> Or mischief on earth:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1026"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1026</font></a></p>  
 <p>And the End is (best)<br> For the righteous.</p>  
 <p>84. If any does good, the reward<br> To him is better than<br> His deed; but if any<br> Does evil, the doers of evil<br> Are only punished (to the extent)<br> Of their deeds.</p>  
 <p>85. Verily He Who ordained<br> The Qur-ān for thee, will bring<br> Thee back to the Place<br> Of Return. Say: "My Lord<br> Knows best who it is<br> That brings true guidance,<br> And who is in manifest error."</p>  
 <p>86. And thou hadst not expected<br> That the Book would be<br> Sent to thee except as<br> A Mercy from thy Lord:<br> Therefore lend not thou support<br> In any way to those</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1027"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1027</font></a></p>  
 <p>Who reject (God's Message).</p>  
 <p>87. And let nothing keep thee<br> Back from the Signs of God<br> After they have been revealed<br> To thee: and invite (men)<br> To thy Lord, and be not<br> Of the company of those<br> Who join gods with God.</p>  
 <p>88. And call not, besides God,<br> On another god. There is<br> No god but He. Everything<br> (That exists) will perish<br> Except His own Face<br> To Him belongs the Command,<br> And to Him will ye<br> (All) be brought back.</p>
