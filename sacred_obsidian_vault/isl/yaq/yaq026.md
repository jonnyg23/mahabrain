 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful</i>.</p>  
 <p>1. <i>Tā</i>. <i>Sīn</i>. <i>Mīm</i>.</p>  
 <p>2. These are Verses of the Book<br> That makes (things) clear.</p>  
 <p>3. It may be thou frettest<br> Thy soul with grief, that they<br> Do not become Believers.</p>  
 <p>4. If (such) were Our Will,<br> We could send down to them<br> From the sky a Sign,<br> To which they would bend<br> Their necks in humility.</p>  
 <p>5. But there comes not<br> To them a newly-revealed<br> Message from (God) Most Gracious,<br> But they turn away therefrom.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_947"><font size="1" color="green">p. 947</font></a></p>  
 <p>6. They have indeed rejected<br> (The Message): so they will<br> Know soon (enough) the truth<br> Of what they mocked at!</p>  
 <p>7. Do they not look<br> At the earth,—how many<br> Noble things of all kinds<br> We have produced therein?</p>  
 <p>8. Verily, in this is a Sign:<br> But most of them<br> Do not believe.</p>  
 <p>9. And verily, thy Lord<br> Is He, the Exalted in Might,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>10. Behold, thy Lord called<br> Moses: "Go to the people<br> Of iniquity,—</p>  
 <p>11. "The people of Pharaoh:<br> Will they not fear God?"</p>  
 <p>12. He said: "O my Lord!<br> I do fear that they<br> Will charge me with falsehood:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_948"><font size="1" color="green">p. 948</font></a></p>  
 <p>13. "My breast will be straitened?'<br> And my speech may not go<br> (Smoothly): so send unto Aaron.</p>  
 <p>14. "And (further), they have<br> A charge of crime against me;<br> And I fear they may<br> Slay me."</p>  
 <p>15. God said: "By no means!<br> Proceed then, both of you,<br> With Our Signs; We<br> Are with you, and will<br> Listen (to your call).</p>  
 <p>16. "So go forth, both of you,<br> To Pharaoh, and say:<br> 'We have been sent<br> By the Lord and Cherisher<br> Of the Worlds;</p>  
 <p>17. "'Send thou with us<br> The Children of Israel.'"</p>  
 <p>18. (Pharaoh) said: "Did we not<br> Cherish thee as a child<br> Among us, and didst thou not<br> Stay in our midst<br> Many years of thy life?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_949"><font size="1" color="green">p. 949</font></a></p>  
 <p>19. "And thou didst a deed<br> Of thine which (thou knowest)<br> Thou didst, and thou art<br> An ungrateful (wretch)!"</p>  
 <p>20. Moses said: "I did it<br> Then, when I was<br> In error.</p>  
 <p>21. "So I fled from you (all)<br> When I feared you;<br> But my Lord has (since)<br> Invested me with judgment<br> (And wisdom) and appointed me<br> As one of the apostles.</p>  
 <p>22. "And this is the favour<br> With which thou dost<br> Reproach me,—that thou<br> Hast enslaved the Children<br> Of Israel!"</p>  
 <p>23. Pharaoh said: "And what<br> Is the 'Lord and Cherisher<br> Of the Worlds'?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_950"><font size="1" color="green">p. 950</font></a></p>  
 <p>24. (Moses) said: "The Lord<br> And Cherisher of the heavens<br> And the earth, and all between,<br> If ye want to be<br> Quite sure."</p>  
 <p>25. (Pharaoh) said to those<br> Around: "Do ye not listen<br> (To what he says)?</p>  
 <p>26. (Moses) said: "Your Lord<br> And the Lord of your fathers<br> From the beginning!"</p>  
 <p>27. (Pharaoh) said: "Truly<br> Your apostle who has been<br> Sent to you is<br> A veritable madman!"</p>  
 <p>28. (Moses) said: "Lord of the East<br> And the West, and all between!<br> If ye only had sense!"</p>  
 <p>29. (Pharaoh) said: "If thou<br> Dost put forward any god<br> Other than me, I will<br> Certainly put thee in prison!"</p>  
 <p>30. (Moses) said: "Even if I<br> Showed you something<br> Clear (and) convincing?"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_951"><font size="1" color="green">p. 951</font></a></p>  
 <p>31. (Pharaoh) said: "Show it then,<br> If thou tellest the truth!"</p>  
 <p>32. So (Moses) threw his rod,<br> And behold, it was<br> A serpent, plain (for all to see)!</p>  
 <p>33. And he drew out his hand,<br> And behold, it was white<br> To all beholders!</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
 <p>34. (Pharaoh) said to the Chiefs<br> Around him: "This is indeed<br> A sorcerer well-versed:</p>  
 <p>35. "His plan is to get you out<br> Of your land by his sorcery;<br> Then what is it ye counsel?"</p>  
 <p>36. They said: "Keep him<br> And his brother in suspense<br> (For a while), and dispatch<br> To the Cities heralds to collect—</p>  
 <p>37. "And bring up to thee<br> All (our) sorcerers well-versed."</p>  
 <p>38. So the sorcerers were got<br> Together for the appointment<br> Of a day well-known,</p>  
 <p>39. And the people were told:<br> "Are ye (now) assembled?—</p>  
 <p>40. "That we may follow<br> The sorcerers (in religion)<br> If they win?"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_952"><font size="1" color="green">p. 952</font></a></p>  
 <p>41. So when the sorcerers arrived,<br> They said to Pharaoh:<br> "Of course—shall we have<br> A (suitable) reward<br> If we win?"</p>  
 <p>42. He said: "Yea, (and more),—<br> For ye shall in that case<br> Be (raised to posts)<br> Nearest (to my person)."</p>  
 <p>43. Moses said to them:<br> "Throw ye—that which<br> Ye are about to throw!"</p>  
 <p>44. So they threw their ropes<br> And their rods, and said:<br> "By the might of Pharaoh,<br> It is we who will<br> Certainly win!"</p>  
 <p>45. Then Moses threw his rod,<br> When, behold, it straightway<br> Swallows up all<br> The falsehoods which they fake!</p>  
 <p>46. When did the sorcerers<br> Fall down, prostrate in adoration,</p>  
 <p>47. Saying: "We believe<br> In the Lord of the Worlds,</p>  
 <p>48. "The Lord of Moses and Aaron."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_953"><font size="1" color="green">p. 953</font></a></p>  
 <p>49. Said (Pharaoh): "Believe ye<br> In Him before I give<br> You permission? Surely he<br> Is your leader, who has<br> Taught you sorcery!<br> But soon shall ye know!</p>  
 <p>50. "Be sure I will cut off<br> Your hands and your feet<br> On opposite sides, and I<br> Will cause you all<br> To die on the cross!"</p>  
 <p>51. They said: "No matter!<br> For us, we shall but<br> Return to our Lord!</p>  
 <p>52. "Only, our desire is<br> That our Lord will<br> Forgive us our faults,<br> That we may become<br> Foremost among the Believers!"</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
 <p>53. By inspiration We told Moses:<br> "Travel by night with<br> My servants; for surely<br> Ye shall be pursued."</p>  
 <p>54. Then Pharaoh sent heralds<br> To (all) the Cities,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_954"><font size="1" color="green">p. 954</font></a></p>  
 <p>55. (Saying): "These (Israelites)<br> Are but a small band,</p>  
 <p>56. "And they are raging<br> Furiously against us;</p>  
 <p>57. "But we are a multitude<br> Amply fore-warned."</p>  
 <p>58. So We expelled them<br> From gardens, springs,</p>  
 <p>59. Treasures, and every kind<br> Of honourable position;</p>  
 <p>60. Thus it was, but<br> We made the Children<br> Of Israel inheritors<br> Of such things.</p>  
 <p>61. So they pursued them<br> At sunrise.</p>  
 <p>62. And when the two bodies<br> Saw each other, the people<br> Of Moses said: "We are<br> Sure to be overtaken."</p>  
 <p>63. (Moses) said: "By no means!<br> My Lord is with me!<br> Soon will He guide me!"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_955"><font size="1" color="green">p. 955</font></a></p>  
 <p>64. Then We told Moses<br> By inspiration: "Strike<br> The sea with thy rod."<br> So it divided, and each<br> Separate part became<br> Like the huge, firm mass<br> Of a mountain.</p>  
 <p>65. And We made the other<br> Party approach thither.</p>  
 <p>66. We delivered Moses and all<br> Who were with him;</p>  
 <p>67. But We drowned the others.</p>  
 <p>68. Verily in this is a Sign:<br> But most of them<br> Do not believe.</p>  
 <p>69. And verily thy Lord<br> Is He, the Exalted in Might,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
 <p>70. And rehearse to them<br> (Something of) Abraham's story.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_956"><font size="1" color="green">p. 956</font></a></p>  
 <p>71. Behold, he said<br> To his father and his people:<br> "What worship ye?"</p>  
 <p>72. They said: "We worship<br> Idols, and we remain constantly<br> In attendance on them."</p>  
 <p>73. He said: "Do they listen<br> To you when ye call (on them),<br> Or do you good or harm?"</p>  
 <p>74. They said: "Nay, but we<br> Found our fathers doing<br> Thus (what we do)."</p>  
 <p>75. He said: "Do ye then<br> See whom ye have been<br> Worshipping,—</p>  
 <p>76. "Ye and your fathers before you?—</p>  
 <p>77. "For they are enemies to me;<br> Not so the Lord and Cherisher<br> Of the Worlds;</p>  
 <p>78. "Who created me, and<br> It is He who guides me;</p>  
 <p>79. "Who gives me food and drink,</p>  
 <p>80. "And when I am ill,<br> It is He who cures me;</p>  
 <p>81. "Who will cause me to die,<br> And then to live (again);</p>  
 <p><a name="page_957"><font size="1" color="green">p. 957</font></a></p>  
 <p>82. "And who, I hope,<br> Will forgive me my faults<br> On the Day of Judgment.</p>  
 <p>83. "O my Lord! bestow wisdom<br> On me, and join me<br> With the righteous;</p>  
 <p>84. "Grant me honourable mention<br> On the tongue of truth<br> Among the latest (generations);</p>  
 <p>85. "Make me one of the inheritors<br> Of the Garden of Bliss;</p>  
 <p>86. "Forgive my father, for that<br> He is among those astray;</p>  
 <p>87. "And let me not be<br> In disgrace on the Day<br> When (men) will be raised up;—</p>  
 <p>88. "The Day whereon neither<br> Wealth nor sons will avail,</p>  
 <p>89. "But only he (will prosper)<br> That brings to God<br> A sound heart;</p>  
 <p>90. "To the righteous, the Garden<br> Will be brought near,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_958"><font size="1" color="green">p. 958</font></a></p>  
 <p>91. "And to those straying in Evil,<br> The Fire will be placed<br> In full view;</p>  
 <p>92. "And it shall be said<br> To them, 'Where are<br> The (gods) ye worshipped—</p>  
 <p>93. "'Besides God? Can they<br> Help you or help themselves?'</p>  
 <p>94. "Then they will be thrown<br> Headlong into the (Fire),—<br> They and those straying<br> In Evil,</p>  
 <p>95. "And the whole hosts<br> Of Iblīs together.</p>  
 <p>96. "They will say there<br> In their mutual bickerings:</p>  
 <p>97. "'By God, we were truly<br> In an error manifest,</p>  
 <p>98. "'When we held you as equals<br> With the Lord of the Worlds;</p>

 <p>104. And verily thy Lord<br> Is He, the Exalted in Might,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
 <p>105. The people of Noah rejected<br> The apostles.</p>  
 <p>106. Behold, their brother Noah<br> Said to them: "Will ye not<br> Fear (God)?</p>  
 <p>107. "I am to you an apostle<br> Worthy of all trust:</p>  
 <p>108. "So fear God, and obey me.</p>

 <p>113. "Their account is only<br> With my Lord, if ye<br> Could (but) understand.</p>  
 <p>114. "I am not one to drive away<br> Those who believe.</p>

 <p>192. Verily this is a Revelation<br> From the Lord of the Worlds:</p>  
 <p>193. With it came down<br> The Spirit of Faith and Truth—</p>  
 <p><a name="page_970"><font size="1" color="green">p. 970</font></a></p>  
 <p>194. To thy heart and mind,<br> That thou mayest admonish</p>  
 <p>195. In the perspicuous<br> Arabic tongue.</p>  
 <p>196. Without doubt it is (announced)<br> In the mystic Book<br> Of former peoples.</p>  
 <p>197. Is it not a Sign<br> To them that the Learned<br> Of the Children of Israel<br> Knew it (as true)?</p>  
 <p>198. Had We revealed it<br> To any of the non Arabs,</p>  
 <p>199. And had he recited it<br> To them, they would not<br> Have believed in it.</p>  
 <p>200. Thus have We caused it<br> To enter the hearts<br> Of the Sinners.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_971"><font size="1" color="green">p. 971</font></a></p>  
 <p>201. They will not believe<br> In it until they see<br> The grievous Penalty;</p>  
 <p>202. But the (Penalty) will come<br> To them of a sudden,<br> While they preceive it not;</p>  
 <p>203. Then they will say:<br> "Shall we be respited?"</p>  
 <p>204. Do they then ask<br> For Our Penalty to be<br> Hastened on?</p>  
 <p>205. Seest thou? If We do<br> Let them enjoy (this life)<br> For a few years,</p>  
 <p>206. Yet there comes to them<br> At length the (Punishment)<br> Which they were promised!</p>  
 <p>207. It will profit them not<br> That they enjoyed (this life)!</p>  
 <p>208. Never did We destroy<br> A population, but had<br> Its warners—</p>  
 <p>209. By way of reminder;<br> And We never are unjust.</p>  
 <p>210. No evil ones have brought<br> Down this (Revelation):</p>  
 <p><a name="page_972"><font size="1" color="green">p. 972</font></a></p>  
 <p>211. It would neither suit them<br> Nor would they be able<br> (To produce it).</p>  
 <p>212. Indeed they have been removed<br> Far from even (a chance of)<br> Hearing it.</p>  
 <p>213. So call not on any<br> Other god with God,<br> Or thou wilt be among<br> Those under the Penalty.</p>  
 <p>214. And admonish thy nearest<br> Kinsmen,</p>  
 <p>215. And lower thy wing<br> To the Believers who<br> Follow thee.</p>  
 <p>216. Then if they disobey thee,<br> Say: "I am free (of responsibility)<br> For what ye do!"</p>  
 <p>217. And put thy trust<br> On the Exalted in Might,<br> The Merciful,—</p>  
 <p>218. Who seeth thee standing<br> Forth (in prayer),</p>  
 <p>219. And thy movements among<br> Those who prostrate themselves.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_973"><font size="1" color="green">p. 973</font></a></p>  
 <p>220. For it is He<br> Who heareth and knoweth<br> All things.</p>  
 <p>221. Shall I inform you.<br> (O people!), on whom it is<br> That the evil ones descend?</p>  
 <p>222. They descend on every<br> Lying, wicked person,</p>  
 <p>223. (Into whose ears) they pour<br> Hearsay vanities, and most<br> Of them are liars.</p>  
 <p>224. And the Poets,—<br> It is those straying in Evil,<br> Who follow them:</p>  
 <p>225. Seest thou not that they<br> Wander distracted in every<br> Valley?—</p>  
 <p>226. And that they say<br> What they practise not?—</p>  
 <p>227. Except those who believe,<br> Work righteousness, engage much</p>  
 <p><a name="page_974"><font size="1" color="green">p. 974</font></a></p>  
 <p>In the remembrance of God,<br> And defend themselves only after<br> They are unjustly attacked.<br> And soon will the unjust'<br> Assailants know what vicissitudes<br> Their affairs will take!</p>
