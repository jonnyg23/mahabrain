 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful</i>.</p>  
 <p>1. <i>Tā</i>. <i>Sīn</i>.<br> These are verses<br> Of the Qur-ān,—a Book<br> That makes (things) clear;</p>  
 <p>2. A Guide; and Glad Tidings<br> For the Relievers,—</p>  
 <p>3. Those who establish regular prayers<br> And give in regular charity,<br> And also have (full) assurance<br> Of the Hereafter.</p>  
 <p>4. As to those who believe not<br> In the Hereafter, We have<br> Made their deeds pleasing<br> In their eyes; and so they<br> Wander about in distraction.</p>  
 <p>5. Such are they for whom<br> A grievous Penalty is (waiting):<br> And in the Hereafter theirs<br> Will be the greatest loss.</p>  
 <p>6. As to thee, the Qur-ān<br> Is bestowed upon thee<br> From the presence of One<br> Who is Wise and All-Knowing.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_979"><font size="1" color="green">p. 979</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. Behold! Moses said<br> To his family "I perceive<br> A fire; soon will I bring you<br> From there some information,<br> Or I will bring you<br> A burning brand to light<br> Our fuel, that ye may<br> Warm yourselves.</p>  
 <p>8. But when he came<br> To the (Fire), a voice<br> Was heard: "Blessed are those<br> In the Fire and those around:<br> And Glory to God,<br> The Lord of the Worlds.</p>  
 <p>9. "O Moses! Verily,<br> I am God, the Exalted<br> In Might, the Wise!...</p>  
 <p>10. "Now do thou throw thy rod!"<br> But when he saw it<br> Moving (of its own accord)<br> As if it had been a snake,<br> He turned back in retreat,<br> And retraced not his steps:<br> "O Moses!" (it was said),<br> "Fear not: truly, in My presence,<br> Those called as apostles<br> Have no fear,—</p>  
 <p><a name="page_980"><font size="1" color="green">p. 980</font></a></p>  
 <p>11. "But if any have done wrong<br> And have thereafter substituted<br> Good to take the place of evil,<br> Truly, I am Oft-Forgiving,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  
 <p>12. "Now put thy hand into<br> Thy bosom, and it will<br> Come forth white without stain<br> (Or harm): (these are) among<br> The nine Signs (thou wilt take)<br> To Pharaoh and his people:<br> For they are a people<br> Rebellious in transgression."</p>  
 <p>13. But when Our Signs came<br> To them, that should have""<br> Opened their eyes, they said:<br> "This is sorcery manifest!"</p>  
 <p>14. And they rejected those Signs<br> In iniquity and arrogance,<br> Though their souls were convinced<br> Thereof: so see what was<br> The end of those<br> Who acted corruptly!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_981"><font size="1" color="green">p. 981</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>15. We gave (in the past)<br> Knowledge to David and Solomon<br> And they both said:<br> "Praise be to God, Who<br> Has favoured us above many<br> Of His servants who believe!</p>  
 <p>16. And Solomon was David's heir.<br> He said: "O ye people!<br> We have been taught the speech"<br> Of Birds, and on us<br> Has been bestowed (a little)<br> Of all things: this is<br> Indeed Grace manifest (from God.)"</p>  
 <p>17. And before Solomon were marshalled</p>  
 <p><a name="page_982"><font size="1" color="green">p. 982</font></a></p>  
 <p>His hosts,—of Jinns and men<br> And birds, and they were all<br> Kept in order and ranks.</p>  
 <p>18. At length, when they came<br> To a (lowly) valley of ants,<br> One of the ants said:<br> "O ye ants, get into<br> Your habitations, lest Solomon<br> And his hosts crush you<br> (Under foot) without knowing it."</p>  
 <p>19. So he smiled, amused<br> At her speech; and he said:<br> "O my Lord! so order me<br> That I may be grateful<br> For Thy favours, which Thou<br> Hast bestowed on me and<br> On my parents, and that<br> I may work the righteousness<br> That will please Thee:<br> And admit me, by Thy Grace,<br> To the ranks of Thy<br> Righteous Servants."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_983"><font size="1" color="green">p. 983</font></a></p>  
 <p>20. And he took a muster<br> Of the Birds; and he said:<br> "Why is it I see not<br> The Hoopoe? Or is he<br> Among the absentees?"</p>  
 <p>21. "I will certainly punish him<br> With a severe penalty,<br> Or execute him, unless he<br> Bring me a clear reason<br> (For absence)."</p>  
 <p>22. But the Hoopoe tarried not<br> Far: he (came up and) said:<br> "I have compassed (territory)<br> Which thou hast not compassed,<br> And I have come to thee<br> From Saba with tidings true.</p>  
 <p>23. "I found (there) a woman<br> Ruling over them and provided<br> With every requisite; and she<br> Has a magnificent throne.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_984"><font size="1" color="green">p. 984</font></a></p>  
 <p>24. "I found her and her people<br> Worshipping the sun besides God:<br> Satan has made their deeds<br> Seem pleasing in their eyes,<br> And has kept them away<br> From the Path,—so<br> They receive no guidance,—</p>  
 <p>25. "(Kept them away from the Path),<br> That they should not worship<br> God, Who brings to light<br> What is hidden in the heavens<br> And the earth, and knows<br> What ye hide and what<br> Ye reveal.</p>  
 <p>26. "God!—there is no god<br> But He!—Lord of the Throne's<br> Supreme!"</p>  
 <p>27. (Solomon) said: "Soon shall we<br> See whether thou hast told<br> The truth or lied!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_985"><font size="1" color="green">p. 985</font></a></p>  
 <p>28. "Go thou, with this letter<br> Of mine, and deliver it<br> To them: then draw back<br> From them, and (wait to) see<br> What answer they return"...</p>  
 <p>29. (The Queen) said: "Ye chiefs!<br> Here is—delivered to me—<br> A letter worthy of respect.</p>  
 <p>30. "It is from Solomon, and is<br> (As follows), 'In the name<br> Of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful:</p>  
 <p>31. "'Be ye not arrogant<br> Against me, but come<br> To me in submission<br> (To the true Religion).'"</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
 <p>32. the said: "Ye chiefs!<br> Advise me in (this)<br> My affair: no affair<br> Have I decided<br> Except in your presence."</p>  
 <p>33. They said: "We are endued<br> With strength, and given<br> To vehement war:<br> But the command is<br> With thee; so consider<br> What thou wilt command."</p>  
 <p>34. She said: "Kings, when they<br> Enter a country, despoil it,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_986"><font size="1" color="green">p. 986</font></a></p>  
 <p>And make the noblest<br> Of its people its meanest<br> Thus do they behave.</p>  
 <p>35. "But I am going to send<br> Him a present, and (wait)<br> To see with what (answer)<br> Return (my) ambassadors."</p>  
 <p>36. Now when (the embassy) came<br> To Solomon, he said:<br> "Will ye give me abundance<br> In wealth? But that which<br> God has given me is better<br> Than that which He has<br> Given you! Nay it is ye<br> Who rejoice in your gift!</p>  
 <p>37. "Go back to them, and be sure<br> We shall come to them<br> With such hosts as they<br> Will never be able to meet:<br> We shall expel them<br> From there in disgrace,<br> And they will feel<br> Humbled (indeed)."</p>  
 <p>38. He said (to his own men):<br> "Ye Chiefs! which of you<br> Can bring me her throne<br> Before they come to me<br> In submission?"</p>  
 <p>39. Said an ‘Ifrit, of the Jinns:<br> "I will bring it to thee</p>  
 <p><a name="page_987"><font size="1" color="green">p. 987</font></a></p>  
 <p>Before thou rise from thy<br> Council: indeed I have<br> Full strength for the purpose,<br> And may he trusted."</p>  
 <p>40. Said one who had knowledge<br> Of the Book: "I will<br> Bring it to thee within<br> The twinkling of an eye!"<br> Then when (Solomon) saw it<br> Placed firmly before him,<br> He said: "This is<br> By the grace of my Lord!<br> To test me whether I am<br> Grateful or ungrateful!<br> And if any is grateful,<br> Truly his gratitude is (a gain)<br> For his own soul; hut if<br> Any is ungrateful, truly<br> My Lord is Free of all Needs,<br> Supreme in Honour!"</p>  
 <p>41. He said: "Transform her throne<br> Out of all recognition by her:<br> Let us see whether she<br> Is guided (to the truth)</p>  
 <p><a name="page_988"><font size="1" color="green">p. 988</font></a></p>  
 <p>Or is one of those who<br> Receive no guidance."</p>  
 <p>42. So when she arrived,<br> She was asked, "Is this<br> Thy throne?" She said,<br> "It was just like this;<br> And knowledge was bestowed<br> On us in advance of this,<br> And we have submitted<br> To God (in Islam)."</p>  
 <p>43. And he diverted her<br> From the worship of others<br> Besides God: for she was<br> (Sprung) of a people<br> That had no faith.</p>  
 <p>44. She was asked to enter<br> The lofty Palace: but<br> When she saw it, she<br> Thought it was a lake<br> Of water, and she (tucked up<br> Her skirts), uncovering her legs.<br> He said: "This is<br> But a palace paved</p>  
 <p><a name="page_989"><font size="1" color="green">p. 989</font></a></p>  
 <p>Smooth with slabs of glass."<br> She said: "O my Lord!<br> I have indeed wronged"<br> My soul: I do (now)<br> Submit (in Islam), with Solomon,<br> To the Lord of the Worlds."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
 <p>45. We sent (aforetime),<br> To the <u>Th</u>amūd, their brother<br> Ṣaliḥ, saying, "Serve God":<br> But behold, they became<br> Two factions quarrelling<br> With each other.</p>  
 <p>46. He said: "O my people!<br> Why ask ye to hasten on</p>  
 <p><a name="page_990"><font size="1" color="green">p. 990</font></a></p>  
 <p>The evil in preference to the good?<br> If only ye ask God for forgiveness,<br> Ye may hope to receive mercy.</p>  
 <p>47. They said: "Ill omen<br> Do we augur from thee<br> And those that are with thee".<br> He said: "Your ill omen<br> Is with God; yea, ye are<br> A people under trial."</p>  
 <p>48. There were in the City<br> Nine men of a family,<br> Who made mischief in the land,<br> And would not reform.</p>  
 <p>49. They said: "Swear<br> A mutual oath by God<br> That we shall make<br> A secret night attack<br> On him and his people,<br> And that we shall then<br> Say to his heir (when he<br> Seeks vengeance), 'We were not<br> Present at the slaughter<br> Of his people, and we are<br> Positively telling the truth'."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_991"><font size="1" color="green">p. 991</font></a></p>  
 <p>50. They plotted and planned,<br> But We too planned,<br> Even while they perceived it not.</p>  
 <p>51. Then see what was the end<br> Of their plot!—this,<br> That We destroyed them<br> And their people, all (of them).</p>  
 <p>52. Now such were their houses,—<br> In utter ruin,—because<br> They practised wrong-doing.<br> Verily in this is a Sign<br> For people of knowledge.</p>  
 <p>53. And We saved those<br> Who believed and practised<br> Righteousness.</p>  
 <p>54. (We also sent) Lūt<br> (As an apostle): behold,<br> He said to his people,<br> "Do ye do what is shameful<br> Though ye see (its iniquity)?</p>  
 <p>55. Would ye really approach men<br> In your lusts rather than<br> Women? Nay, ye are<br> A people (grossly) ignorant!</p>  
 <p>56. But his people gave<br> No other answer but this:<br> They said, "Drive out</p>  
 <p><a name="page_992"><font size="1" color="green">p. 992</font></a></p>  
 <p>The followers of Lūt from<br> Your city: these are<br> Indeed men who want<br> To be clean and pure!"</p>  
 <p>57. But We saved him<br> And his family, except<br> His wife: her We destined<br> To be of those<br> Who lagged behind.</p>  
 <p>58. And We rained down on them<br> A shower (of brimstone):<br> And evil was the shower<br> On those who were admonished<br> (But heeded not)!</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
 <p>59. Say: Praise be to God,<br> And Peace on His servants<br> Whom He has chosen<br> (For His Message). (Who)<br> Is better?—God or<br> The false gods they associate<br> (With Him)?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_993"><font size="1" color="green">p. 993</font></a></p>  
 <p>60. Or, who has created<br> The heavens and the earth,<br> And who sends you down<br> Rain from the sky?<br> Yea, with it We cause<br> To grow well-planted orchards<br> Full of beauty and delight:<br> It is not in your power<br> To cause the growth<br> Of the trees in them. (Can there be<br> Another) god besides God?<br> Nay, they are a people<br> Who swerve from justice.</p>  
 <p>61. Or, who has made the earth<br> Firm to live in; made<br> Rivers in its midst; set<br> Thereon mountains immovable;<br> And made a separating bar<br> Between the two bodies<br> Of flowing water?<br> (Can there be another) god<br> Besides God? Nay, most<br> Of them know not.</p>  
 <p>62. Or, who listens to the (soul)<br> Distressed when it calls<br> On Him, and who relieves<br> Its suffering, and makes you</p>  
 <p><a name="page_994"><font size="1" color="green">p. 994</font></a></p>  
 <p>(Mankind) inheritors of the earth?'<br> (Can there be another) god<br> Besides God? Little it is<br> That ye heed!</p>  
 <p>63. Or, who guides you<br> Through the depths of darkness<br> On land and sea, and who<br> Sends the winds as heralds<br> Of glad tidings, going before<br> His Mercy? (Can there be<br> Another) god besides God?—<br> High is God above what<br> They associate with Him!</p>  
 <p>64. Or, who originates Creation,<br> Then repeats it,<br> And who gives you sustenance<br> From heaven and earth?<br> (Can there be another) god<br> Besides God? Say, "Bring forth<br> Your argument, if ye<br> Are telling the truth!"</p>  
 <p>65. Say: None in the heavens<br> Or on earth, except God,<br> Knows what is hidden:<br> Nor can they perceive<br> When they shall be raised<br> Up (for Judgment).</p>  
 <p>66. Still less can their knowledge<br> Comprehend the Hereafter: nay,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_995"><font size="1" color="green">p. 995</font></a></p>  
 <p>They are in doubt and uncertainty<br> Thereanent; nay, they are blind<br> Thereunto!</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
 <p>67. The Unbelievers say: "What!<br> When we become dust,<br> We and our fathers,—shall we<br> Really be raised (from the dead)?</p>  
 <p>68. "It is true we were promised<br> This,—we and our fathers<br> Before (us): these are nothing<br> But tales of the ancients."</p>  
 <p>69. Say: "Go ye through the earth<br> And see what has been<br> The end of those guilty<br> (Of sin)."</p>  
 <p>70. But grieve not over them,<br> Nor distress thyself<br> Because of their plots.</p>  
 <p>71. They also say: "When will<br> This promise (come to pass)?<br> (Say) if ye are truthful."</p>  
 <p>72. Say: "It may be that<br> Some of the events which<br> Ye wish to hasten on<br> May be (close) in your pursuit!"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_996"><font size="1" color="green">p. 996</font></a></p>  
 <p>73. But verily thy Lord is<br> Full of grace to mankind:<br> Yet most of them are ungrateful.</p>  
 <p>74. And verily thy Lord knoweth<br> All that their hearts do hide,<br> As well as all that<br> They reveal.</p>  
 <p>75. Nor is there aught<br> Of the Unseen, in heaven<br> Or earth, but is (recorded)<br> In a clear record.</p>  
 <p>76. Verily this Qur-ān doth explain<br> To the Children of Israel<br> Most of the matters<br> In which they disagree.</p>  
 <p>77. And it certainly is<br> A Guide and a Mercy<br> To those who believe.</p>  
 <p>78. Verily thy Lord will decide<br> Between them by His Decree:<br> And He is Exalted in Might,<br> All-Knowing.</p>  
 <p>79. So put thy trust in God:<br> For thou art on (the Path<br> Of) manifest Truth.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_997"><font size="1" color="green">p. 997</font></a></p>  
 <p>80. Truly thou canst not cause<br> The Dead to listen, nor<br> Canst thou cause the Deaf<br> To hear the call,<br> (Especially) when they<br> Turn back in retreat.</p>  
 <p>81. Nor canst thou be a guide<br> To the Blind, (to prevent them)<br> From straying: only those<br> Wilt thou get to listen<br> Who believe in Our Signs,<br> And they will bow in Islam.</p>  
 <p>82. And when the Word is<br> Fulfilled against them (the unjust),<br> We shall produce from the earth<br> A Beast to (face) them:<br> He will speak to them,<br> For that mankind did not<br> Believe with assurance<br> In Our Signs.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 7.</h5>  
 <p>83. One Day We shall gather<br> Together from every people<br> A troop of those who reject<br> Our Signs, and they shall<br> Be kept in ranks,—</p>  
 <p>84. Until, when they come<br> (Before the Judgment-seat),<br> (God) will say: "Did ye<br> Reject My Signs, though ye</p>  
 <p><a name="page_998"><font size="1" color="green">p. 998</font></a></p>  
 <p>Comprehended them not<br> In knowledge, or what<br> Was it ye did?"</p>  
 <p>85. And the Word will be<br> Fulfilled against them, because<br> Of their wrong-doing, and they<br> Will be unable to speak<br> (In plea).</p>  
 <p>86. See they not that We<br> Have made the Night<br> For them to rest in<br> And the Day to give<br> Them light? Verily in this<br> Are Signs for any people <br> That believe!</p>  
 <p>87. And the Day that the Trumpet<br> Will be sounded—then will be<br> Smitten with terror those<br> Who are in the heavens,<br> And those who are on earth,<br> Except such as God will please<br> (To exempt): and all shall come<br> To His (Presence) as beings<br> Conscious of their lowliness.</p>  
 <p>88. Thou seest the mountains<br> And thinkest them firmly fixed:<br> But they shall pass away<br> As the clouds pass away:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_999"><font size="1" color="green">p. 999</font></a></p>  
 <p>(Such is) the artistry of God,<br> Who disposes of all things<br> In perfect order: for He is<br> Well acquainted with all that ye do.</p>  
 <p>89. If any do good, good will<br> (Accrue) to them therefrom;<br> And they will be secure<br> From terror that Day.</p>  
 <p>90. And if any do evil,<br> Their faces will be thrown<br> Headlong into the Fire:<br> "Do ye receive a reward<br> Other than that which ye<br> Have earned by your deeds?"</p>  
 <p>91. For me, I have been<br> Commanded to serve the Lord<br> Of this City, Him Who has<br> Sanctified it and to Whom<br> (Belong) all things:<br> And I am commanded<br> To be of those who bow<br> In Islam to God's Will,—</p>  
 <p>92. And to rehearse the Qur-ān:<br> And if any accept guidance,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1000"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1000</font></a></p>  
 <p>They do it for the good<br> Of their own souls,<br> And if any stray, say:<br> "I am only a Warner".</p>  
 <p>93. And say: "Praise be to God,<br> Who will soon show you<br> His Signs, so that ye<br> Shall know them"; and thy Lord<br> Is not unmindful<br> Of all that ye do.</p>
