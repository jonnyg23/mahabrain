 <p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></a> <a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">Sūra II.</h3>  <h3 align="center">Baqara, or the Heifer.</h3>  
 <p><i>In the name of God, most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful</i>.</p>  
 <p>1. A. L. M.</p>  
 <p>2. This is the Book;<br> In it is guidance sure, without doubt,<br> To those who fear God;</p>  
 <p>3. Who believe in the Unseen,<br> Are steadfast in prayer,<br> And spend out of what We<br> Have provided for them;</p>  
 <p>4. And who believe in the Revelation<br> Sent to thee,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></a></p>  
 <p>And sent before thy time,<br> And (in their hearts)<br> Have the assurance of the Hereafter.</p>  
 <p>5. They are on (true) guidance,<br> From their Lord, and it is<br> These who will prosper.</p>  
 <p>6. As to those who reject Faith,<br> It is the same to them<br> Whether thou warn them<br> Or do not warn them;<br> They will not believe.</p>  
 <p>7. God hath set a seal<br> On their hearts and on their hearing,<br> And on their eyes is a veil;<br> Great is the penalty they (incur).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>8. Of the people there are some who say:<br> "We believe in God and the Last Day;"<br> But they do not (really) believe.</p>  
 <p>9. Fain would they deceive<br> God and those who believe,<br> But they only deceive themselves,<br> And realize (it) not!</p>  
 <p>10. In their hearts is a disease;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></a></p>  
 <p>And God has increased their disease:<br> And grievous is the penalty they (incur),<br> Because they are false (to themselves).</p>  
 <p>11. When it is said to them:<br> "Make not mischief on the earth,"<br> They say: "Why, we only<br> Want to make peace!"</p>  
 <p>12. Of a surety, they are the ones<br> Who make mischief,<br> But they realize (it) not.</p>  
 <p>13. When it is said to them:<br> "Believe as the others believe:"<br> They say: "Shall we believe<br> As the fools believe?"<br> Nay, of a surety they are the fools,<br> But they do not know."</p>  
 <p>14. When they meet those who believe,<br> They say: "We believe;"<br> But when they are alone<br> With their evil ones,<br> They say: "We are really with you:<br> We (were) only jesting."</p>  
 <p>15. God will throw back<br> Their mockery on them,<br> And give them rope in their trespasses;<br> So they will wander like blind ones<br> (To and fro).</p>  
 <p>16. These are they who have bartered<br> Guidance for error:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></a></p>  
 <p>But their traffic is profitless,<br> And they have lost true direction,</p>  
 <p>17. Their similitude is that of a man<br> Who kindled a fire;<br> When it lighted all around him,<br> God took away their light<br> And left them in utter darkness.<br> So they could not see.</p>  
 <p>18. Deaf, dumb, and blind,<br> They will not return (to the path).</p>  
 <p>19. Or (another similitude)<br> Is that of a rain-laden cloud<br> From the sky: in it are zones<br> Of darkness, and thunder and lightning:<br> They press their fingers in their ears<br> To keep out the stunning thunder-clap,<br> The while they are in terror of death.<br> But God is ever round<br> The rejecters of Faith!</p>  
 <p>20. The lightning all but snatches away<br> Their sight; every time the light<br> (Helps) them, they walk therein,<br> And when the darkness grows on them,<br> They stand still.<br> And if God willed, He could take away<br> Their faculty of hearing and seeing;<br> For God hath power over all things</p>  
 <p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="green">p. 21</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
 <p>21. O ye people!<br> Adore your Guardian-Lord,<br> Who created you<br> And those who came before you,<br> That ye may have the chance<br> To learn righteousness;</p>  
 <p>22. Who has made the earth your couch,<br> And the heavens your canopy;<br> And sent down rain from the heavens;<br> And brought forth therewith<br> Fruits for your sustenance;<br> Then set not up rivals unto God<br> When ye know (the truth).</p>  
 <p>23. And if ye are in doubt<br> As to what We have revealed<br> From time to time to Our servant,<br> Then produce a Sūra<br> Like thereunto;<br> And call your witnesses or helpers<br> (If there are any) besides God,<br> If your (doubts) are true.</p>  
 <p>24. But if ye cannot<br> And of a surety ye cannot—<br> Then fear the Fire<br> Whose fuel is Men and Stones,—<br> Which is prepared for those</p>  
 <p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></a></p>  
 <p>Who reject Faith.</p>  
 <p>25. But give glad tidings<br> To those who believe<br> And work righteousness,<br> That their portion is Gardens,<br> Beneath which rivers flow.<br> Every time they are fed<br> With fruits therefrom,<br> They say: "Why, this is<br> What we were fed with before,"<br> For they are given things in similitude;<br> And they have therein<br> Companions pure (and holy);<br> And they abide therein (for ever).</p>  
 <p>26. God disdains not to use<br> The similitude of things,<br> Lowest as well as highest.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></a></p>  
 <p>Those who believe know<br> That it is truth from their Lord;<br> But those who reject Faith say:<br> "What means God by this similitude?"<br> By it He causes many to stray,<br> And many He leads into the right path;<br> But He causes not to stray,<br> Except those who forsake (the path),—</p>  
 <p>27. Those who break God's Covenant<br> After it is ratified,<br> And who sunder what God<br> Has ordered to be joined,<br> And do mischief on earth:<br> These cause loss (only) to themselves.</p>  
 <p>28. How can ye reject<br> The faith in God?—<br> Seeing that ye were without life,<br> And He gave you life<br> Then will He cause you to die,<br> And will again bring you to life;<br> And again to Him will ye return.</p>  
 <p>29. It is He Who hath created for you<br> All things that are on earth;<br> Moreover His design comprehended the heavens,<br> For He gave order and perfection<br> To the seven firmaments;<br> And of all things<br> He hath perfect knowledge.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
 <p>30. Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: "I will create<br> A vicegerent on earth." They said:<br> "Wilt Thou place therein one who will make<br> Mischief therein and shed blood?—<br> Whilst we do celebrate Thy praises<br> And glorify Thy holy (name)?"<br> He said: "I know what ye know not."</p>  
 <p>31. And He taught Adam the nature<br> Of all things; then He placed them<br> Before the angels, and said: "Tell Me<br> The nature of these if ye are right."</p>  
 <p>32. They said: "Glory to Thee: of knowledge</p>  
 <p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></a></p>  
 <p>We have none, save what Thou<br> Hast taught us: in truth it is Thou<br> Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom."</p>  
 <p>33. He said: "O Adam! tell them<br> Their natures." When he had told them,<br> God said: "Did I not tell you<br> That I know the secrets of heaven<br> And earth, and I know what ye reveal<br> And what ye conceal?"</p>  
 <p>34. And behold, We said to the angels:<br> "Bow down to Adam: "and they bowed down:<br> Not so Iblīs: he refused and was haughty:<br> He was of those who reject Faith.</p>  
 <p>35. We said: "O Adam! dwell thou<br> And thy wife in the Garden;<br> And eat of the bountiful things therein<br> As (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree,<br> Or ye run into harm and transgression."</p>  
 <p>36. Then did Satan make them slip<br> From the (Garden), and get them out</p>  
 <p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="green">p. 26</font></a></p>  
 <p>Of the state (of felicity) in which<br> They had been. We said:<br> "Get ye down, all (ye people),<br> With enmity between yourselves.<br> On earth will be your dwelling-place<br> And your means of livelihood—<br> For a time."</p>  
 <p>37. Then learnt Adam from his Lord<br> Words of inspiration, and his Lord<br> Turned towards him; for He<br> Is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.</p>  
 <p>38. We said: "Get ye down all from here;<br> And if, as is sure, there comes to you<br> Guidance from Me, whosoever<br> Follows My guidance, on them<br> Shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</p>  
 <p>39. "But those who reject Faith<br> And belie Our Signs,<br> They shall be Companions of the Fire;<br> They shall abide therein."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
 <p>40. O Children of Israel! call to mind<br> The (special) favour which I bestowed<br> Upon you, and fulfil your Covenants<br> With Me as I fulfil My Covenant<br> With you, and fear none but Me.</p>  
 <p>41. And believe in what I reveal,<br> Confirming the revelation<br> Which is with you,<br> And be not the first to reject<br> Faith therein, nor sell My Signs<br> For a small price; and fear Me,<br> And Me alone.</p>  
 <p>42. And cover not Truth<br> With falsehood, nor conceal<br> The Truth when ye know (what it is).</p>  
 <p>43. And be steadfast in prayer;<br> Practise regular charity;<br> And bow down your heads<br> With those who bow down (in worship).</p>  
 <p>44. Do ye enjoin right conduct<br> On the people, and forget<br> (To practise it) yourselves,<br> And yet ye study the Scripture?<br> Will ye not understand?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="green">p. 28</font></a></p>  
 <p>45. Nay, seek (God's) help<br> With patient perseverance<br> And prayer:<br> It is indeed hard, except<br> To those who bring a lowly spirit,—</p>  
 <p>46. Who bear in mind the certainty<br> That they are to meet their Lord,<br> And that they are to return to Him.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
 <p>47. O Children of Israel! call to mind<br> The (special) favour which I bestowed<br> Upon you, and that I preferred you<br> To all others (for My Message).</p>  
 <p>48. Then guard yourselves against a day<br> When one soul shall not avail another<br> Nor shall intercession be accepted for her,<br> Nor shall compensation be taken from her,<br> Nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).</p>  
 <p>49. And remember, We delivered you<br> From the people of Pharaoh: they set you<br> Hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered</p>  
 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></a></p>  
 <p>Your sons and let your women-folk live;<br> Therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.</p>  
 <p>50. And remember We divided<br> The Sea for you and saved you<br> And drowned Pharaoh's people<br> Within your very sight.</p>  
 <p>51. And remember We appointed<br> Forty nights for Moses,<br> And in his absence ye took<br> The calf (for worship),<br> And ye did grievous wrong.</p>  
 <p>52. Even then We did forgive you;<br> There was a chance for you<br> To be grateful.</p>  
 <p>53. And remember We gave<br> Moses the Scripture and the Criterion</p>  
 <p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="green">p. 30</font></a></p>  
 <p>(Between right and wrong): there was<br> A chance for you to be guided aright.</p>  
 <p>54. And remember Moses said<br> To his people: "O my people!<br> Ye have indeed wronged<br> Yourselves by your worship of the calf:<br> So turn (in repentance) to your Maker,<br> And slay yourselves (the wrong-doers);<br> That will be better for you<br> In the sight of your Maker."<br> Then He turned towards you (in forgiveness):<br> For He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.</p>  
 <p>55. And remember ye said: "O Moses!<br> We shall never believe in thee<br> Until we see God manifestly,"<br> But ye were dazed<br> With thunder and lightning<br> Even as ye looked on.</p>  
 <p>56. Then We raised you up<br> After your death:<br> Ye had the chance<br> To be grateful.</p>  
 <p>57. And We gave you the shade of clouds</p>  
 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="green">p. 31</font></a></p>  
 <p>And sent down to you<br> Manna and quails, saying:<br> "Eat of the good things<br> We have provided fcr you:"<br> (But they rebelled);<br> To Us they did no harm,<br> But they harmed their own souls.</p>  
 <p>58. And remember We said:<br> "Enter this town, and eat<br> Of the plenty therein<br> As ye wish; but enter<br> The gate with humility,<br> In posture and in words,<br> And We shall forgive you your faults<br> And increase (the portion of)<br> Those who do good."</p>  
 <p>59. But the transgressors<br> Changed the word from that<br> Which had been given them;<br> So We sent on the transgt essors<br> A plague from heaven,<br> For that they infringed<br> (Our command) repeatedly.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 7.</h5>  
 <p>60. And remember Moses prayed<br> For water for his people;<br> We said: "Strike the rock<br> With thy staff." Then gushed forth</p>  
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p>Therefrom twelve springs.<br> Each group knew its own place<br> For water. So eat and drink<br> Of the sustenance provided by God,<br> And do no evil nor mischief<br> On the (face of the) earth.</p>  
 <p>61. And remember ye said:<br> "O Moses! we cannot endure<br> One kind of food (always);<br> So beseech thy Lord for us<br> To produce for us of what the earth<br> Groweth,—its pot-herbs, and cucumbers,<br> Its garlic, lentils, and onions."<br> He said: "Will ye exchange<br> The better for the worse?<br> Go ye down to any town,"<br> And ye shall find what ye want!"</p>  
 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></a></p>  
 <p>They were covered with humiliation<br> And misery; they drew<br> On themselves the wrath of God.<br> This because they went on<br> Rejecting the Signs of God<br> And slaying His Messengers<br> Without just cause.<br> This because they rebelled<br> And went on transgressing.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 8.</h5>  
 <p>62. Those who believe (in the Qur-ān),<br> And those who follow the Jewish (scriptures),<br> And the Christians and the Sabians,—<br> Any who believe in God<br> And the Last Day,<br> And work righteousness,<br> Shall have their reward</p>  
 <p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></a></p>  
 <p>With their Lord: on them<br> Shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</p>  
 <p>63. And remember We took<br> Your Covenant<br> And We raised above you<br> (The towering height)<br> Of Mount (Sinai):<br> (Saying): "Hold firmly<br> To what We have given you<br> And bring (ever) to remembrance<br> What is therein:<br> Perchance ye may fear God."</p>  
 <p>64. But ye turned back thereafter:<br> Had it not been for the Grace<br> And Mercy of God to you,<br> Ye had surely been<br> Among the lost.</p>  
 <p>65. And well ye knew<br> Those amongst you<br> Who transgressed<br> In the matter of the Sabbath:<br> We said to them:<br> "Be ye apes,<br> Despised and rejected."</p>  
 <p>66. So We made it an example<br> To their own time</p>  
 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></a></p>  
 <p>And to their posterity,<br> And a lesson<br> To those who fear God.</p>  
 <p>67. And remember Moses said<br> To his people: "God commands<br> That ye sacrifice a heifer."<br> They said: "Makest thou<br> A laughing-stock of us?"<br> He said: "God save me<br> From being an ignorant (fool)!"</p>  
 <p>68. They said: "Beseech on our behalf<br> Thy Lord to make plain to us<br> What (heifer) it is!"<br> He said: "He says: the heifer<br> Should be neither too old<br> Nor too young, but of middling<br> Age: now do what ye are commanded!"</p>  
 <p>69. They said: "Beseech on our behalf<br> Thy Lord to make plain to us<br> Her colour." He said: "He says:<br> A fawn-coloured heifer,<br> Pure and rich in tone,<br> The admiration of beholders!"</p>  
 <p>70. They said: "Beseech on our behalf<br> Thy Lord to make plain to us<br> What she is: to us are all heifers<br> Alike: we wish indeed for guidance,<br> If God wills."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></a></p>  
 <p>71. He said: "He says: a heifer<br> Not trained to till the soil<br> Or water the fields: sound<br> And without blemish." They said:<br> "Now hast thou brought<br> The truth." Then they offered<br> Her in sacrifice,<br> But not with good-will.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 9.</h5>  
 <p>72. Remember ye slew a man<br> And fell into a dispute<br> Among yourselves as to the crime:<br> But God was to bring forth<br> What ye did hide.</p>  
 <p>73. So We said: "Strike the (body)<br> With a piece of the (heifer)."<br> Thus God bringeth the dead<br> To life and showeth you His Signs:<br> Perchance ye may understand.</p>  
 <p>74. Thenceforth were your hearts<br> Hardened: they became<br> Like a rock and even worse<br> In hardness. For among rocks<br> There are some from which<br> Rivers gush forth; others<br> There are which when split<br> Asunder send forth water;<br> And others which sink</p>  
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></a></p>  
 <p>For fear of God. And God is<br> Not unmindful of what ye do.</p>  
 <p>75. Can ye (O ye men of Faith)<br> Entertain the hope that they<br> Will believe in you?—<br> Seeing that a party of them<br> Heard the Word of God,<br> And perverted it knowingly<br> After they understood it.</p>  
 <p>76. Behold! when they meet<br> The men of Faith, they say:<br> "We believe": but when<br> They meet each other in private,<br> They say: "Shall you tell them<br> What God hath revealed to you,<br> That they may engage you<br> In argument about it<br> Before your Lord?"—<br> Do ye not understand (their aim)?</p>  
 <p>77. Know they not that God<br> Knoweth what they conceal<br> And what they reveal?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></a></p>  
 <p>78. And there are among them<br> Illiterates, who know not the Book,<br> But (see therein their own) desires,<br> And they do nothing but conjecture.</p>  
 <p>79. Then woe to those who write<br> The Book with their own hands,<br> And then say: "This is from God,"<br> To traffic with it<br> For a miserable price!—<br> Woe to them for what their hands<br> Do write, and for the gain<br> They make thereby.</p>  
 <p>80. And they say: "The Fire<br> Shall not touch us<br> But for a few numbered days:"<br> Say: "Have ye taken a promise<br> From God, for He never<br> Breaks His promise?<br> Or is it that ye say of God<br> What ye do not know?"</p>  
 <p>81. Nay, those who seek gain<br> In Evil, and are girt round<br> By their sins,<br> They are Companions of the Fire:<br> Therein shall they abide<br> (For ever).</p>  
 <p>82. But those who have faith<br> And work righteousness,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></a></p>  
 <p>They are Companions of the Garden:<br> Therein shall they abide<br> (For ever).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 10.</h5>  
 <p>83. And remember We took<br> A Covenant from the Children<br> Of Israel (to this effect):<br> Worship none but God;<br> Treat with kindness<br> Your parents and kindred,<br> And orphans and those in need;<br> Speak fair to the people;<br> Be steadfast in prayer;<br> And practise regular charity.<br> Then did ye turn back,<br> Except a few among you,<br> And ye backslide (even now).</p>  
 <p>84. And remember We took<br> Your Covenant (to this effect):<br> Shed no blood amongst you,<br> Nor turn out your own people<br> From your homes: and this<br> Ye solemnly ratified,<br> And to this ye can bear witness.</p>  
 <p>85. After this it is ye, the same people,<br> Who slay among yourselves,<br> And banish a party of you<br> From their homes; assist<br> (Their enemies) against them,<br> In guilt and rancour;<br> And if they come to you<br> As captives, ye ransom them,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></a></p>  
 <p>Though it was not lawful<br> For you to banish them.<br> Then is it only a part of the Book<br> That ye believe in,<br> And do ye reject the rest?<br> But what is the reward for those<br> Among you who behave like this<br> But disgrace in this life?—<br> And on the Day of Judgment<br> They shall be consigned<br> To the most grievous penalty.<br> For God is not unmindful<br> Of what ye do.</p>  
 <p>86. These are the people who buy<br> The life of this world at the price<br> Of the Hereafter: their penalty<br> Shall not be lightened<br> Nor shall they be helped.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 11.</h5>  
 <p>87. We gave Moses the Book<br> And followed him up<br> With a succession of Apostles;<br> We gave Jesus the son of Mary<br> Clear (Signs) and strengthened him<br> With the holy spirit. Is it<br> That whenever there comes to you<br> An Apostle with what ye<br> Yourselves desire not, ye are<br> Puffed up with pride?—<br> Some ye called impostors,<br> And others ye slay!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></a></p>  
 <p>88. They say, "Our hearts<br> Are the wrappings (which preserve<br> God's Word: we need no more)."<br> Nay, God's curse is on them<br> For their blasphemy:<br> Little is it they believe.</p>  
 <p>89. And when there comes to them<br> A Book from God, confirming<br> What is with them,—although<br> From of old they had prayed<br> For victory against those<br> Without Faith,—when there comes.<br> To them that which they<br> (Should) have recognized,<br> They refuse to believe in it<br> But the curse of God<br> Is on those without Faith.</p>  
 <p>90. Miserable is the price<br> For which they have sold<br> Their souls, in that they<br> Deny (the revelation)<br> Which God has sent down,<br> In insolent envy that God<br> Of His Grace should send it<br> To any of His servants He pleases:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p>Thus have they drawn<br> On themselves Wrath upon Wrath.<br> And humiliating is the punishment<br> Of those who reject Faith.</p>  
 <p>91. When it is said to them,<br> "Believe in what God<br> Hath sent down," they say,<br> "We believe in what was sent down<br> To us": yet they reject<br> All besides, even if it be Truth<br> Confirming what is with them.<br> Say: "Why then have ye slain<br> The prophets of God in times<br> Gone by, if ye did indeed<br> Believe?"</p>  
 <p>92. There came to you Moses<br> With clear (Signs); yet<br> Ye worshipped the Calf<br> (Even) after that, and ye<br> Did behave wrongfully.</p>  
 <p>93. And remember We took<br> Your Covenant and We raised<br> Above you (the towering height)<br> Of Mount (Sinai):<br> (Saying): "Hold firmly<br> To what We have given you,<br> And hearken (to the Law)"<br> They said: "We hear,<br> And we disobey"<br> And they had to drink</p>

 <p>Into their hearts<br> (Of the taint) of the Calf<br> Because of their Faithlessness.<br> Say: "Vile indeed<br> Are the behests of your Faith<br> If ye have any faith!"</p>  
 <p>94. Say: "If the last Home,<br> With God, be for you specially,<br> And not for anyone else,<br> Then seek ye for death,<br> If ye are sincere."</p>  
 <p>95. But they will never seek<br> For death, on account of the (sins)<br> Which their hands have sent<br> On before them.<br> And God is well-acquainted<br> With the wrong-doers.</p>  
 <p>96. Thou wilt indeed find them,<br> Of all people, most greedy<br> Of life,—even more<br> Than the idolaters:<br> Each one of them wishes<br> He could be given a life<br> Of a thousand years:<br> But the grant of such life<br> Will not save him<br> From (due) punishment.<br> For God sees well<br> All that they do.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 12.</h5>  
 <p>97. Say: Whoever is an enemy<br> To Gabriel—for he brings down</p>  
 <p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></a></p>  
 <p>The (revelation) to thy heart<br> By God's will, a confirmation<br> Of what went before,<br> And guidance and glad tidings<br> For those who believe,—</p>  
 <p>98. Whoever is an enemy to God<br> And His angels and apostles,<br> To Gabriel and Michael,—<br> Lo! God is an enemy to those<br> Who reject Faith.</p>  
 <p>99. We have sent down to thee<br> Manifest Signs (<i>āyāt</i>);<br> And none reject them<br> But those who are perverse.</p>  
 <p>100. Is it not (the case) that<br> Every time they make a Covenant,<br> Some party among them<br> Throw it aside?—Nay,<br> Most of them are faithless.</p>  
 <p>101. And when there came to them<br> An Apostle from God,<br> Confirming what was with them,<br> A party of the People of the Book<br> Threw away the Book of God<br> Behind their backs,<br> As if (it had been something)<br> They did not know!</p>  
 <p>102. They followed what the evil ones<br> Gave out (falsely)<br> Against the power<br> Of Solomon: the blasphemers<br> Were, not Solomon, but<br> The evil ones, teaching men</p>  
 <p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></a></p>  
 <p>Magic, and such things<br> As came down at Babylon<br> To the angels Hārūt and Mārūt.<br> But neither of these taught anyone<br> (Such things) without saying:<br> "We are only for trial;<br> So do not blaspheme."<br> They learned from them<br> The means to sow discord<br> Between man and wife.<br> But they could not thus<br> Harm anyone except<br> By God's permission.<br> And they learned what harmed them,<br> Not what profited them.<br> And they knew that the buyers<br> Of (magic) would have<br> No share in the happiness<br> Of the Hereafter. And vile<br> Was the price for which<br> They did sell their souls,<br> If they but knew!</p>  
 <p>103. If they had kept their Faith<br> And guarded themselves from evil,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="green">p. 46</font></a></p>  
 <p>Far better had been<br> The reward from their Lord,<br> If they but knew!</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 13</h5>  
 <p>104. ye of Faith!<br> Say not (to the Apostle)<br> Words of ambiguous import,<br> But words of respect;<br> And hearken (to him):<br> To those without Faith<br> Is a grievous punishment.</p>  
 <p>105. It is never the wish<br> Of those without Faith<br> Among the People of the Book,<br> Nor of the Pagans,<br> That anything good<br> Should come down to you<br> From your Lord.<br> But God will choose<br> For His special Mercy<br> Whom He will—for God is<br> Lord of grace abounding.</p>  
 <p>106. None of Our revelations<br> Do We abrogate<br> Or cause to be forgotten,<br> But We substitute</p>  
 <p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></a></p>  
 <p>Something better or similar:<br> Knowest thou not that God<br> Hath power over all things?</p>  
 <p>107. Knowest thou not<br> That to God belongeth<br> The dominion of the heavens<br> And the earth?<br> And besides Him ye have<br> Neither patron nor helper.</p>  
 <p>108. Would ye question<br> Your Apostle as Moses's<br> Was questioned of old?<br> But whoever changeth<br> From Faith to Unbelief,<br> Hath strayed without doubt<br> From the even way.</p>  
 <p>109. Quite a number of the People<br> Of the Book wish they could<br> Turn you (people) back<br> To infidelity after ye have believed,<br> From selfish envy,<br> After the Truth hath become<br> Manifest unto them:<br> But forgive and overlook,</p>  
 <p>Till God accomplish<br> His purpose; for God<br> Hath power over all things.'</p>  
 <p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></a></p>  
 <p>110. And be steadfast in prayer<br> And regular in charity:<br> And whatever good<br> Ye send forth for your souls<br> Before you, ye shall find it<br> With God: for God sees<br> Well all that ye do.</p>  
 <p>111. And they say: "None<br> Shall enter Paradise unless<br> He be a Jew or a Christian."<br> Those are their (vain) desires.<br> Say: "Produce your proof<br> If ye are truthful."</p>  
 <p>112. Nay,—whoever submits<br> His whole self to God<br> And is a doer of good,<br> He will get his reward<br> With his Lord;<br> On such shall be no fear,<br> Nor shall they grieve.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 14.</h5>  
 <p>113. The Jews say: "The Christians<br> Have naught (to stand) upon;<br> And the Christians say:<br> "The Jews have naught<br> (To stand) upon." Yet they<br> (Profess to) study the (same) Book.<br> Like unto their word<br> Is what those say who know not;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></a></p>  
 <p>But God will judge<br> Between them in their quarrel<br> On the Day of Judgment.</p>  
 <p>114. And who is more unjust<br> Than he who forbids<br> That in places for the worship<br> Of God, God's name should be<br> Celebrated?—whose zeal<br> Is (in fact) to ruin them?<br> It was not fitting that such<br> Should themselves enter them<br> Except in fear. For them<br> There is nothing but disgrace<br> In this world, and in the world<br> To come, an exceeding torment.</p>  
 <p>115. To God belong the East<br> And the West: whithersoever<br> Ye turn, there is the Presence<br> Of God. For God is All-Pervading,<br> All-Knowing.</p>  
 <p>116. They say: "God hath begotten<br> A son": Glory be to Him.—Nay,<br> To Him belongs all<br> That is in the heavens<br> And on earth: everything<br> Renders worship to Him.'"</p>  
 <p>117. To Him is due<br> The primal origin</p>  
 <p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></a></p>  
 <p>Of the heavens and the earth:<br> When He decreeth a matter,<br> He saith to it: "Be,"<br> And it is.</p>  
 <p>118. Say those without knowledge:<br> "Why speaketh not God<br> Unto us? Or why cometh not<br> Unto us a Sign?"<br> So said the people before them<br> Words of similar import.<br> Their hearts are alike.<br> We have indeed made clear<br> The Signs unto any people<br> Who hold firmly<br> To Faith (in their hearts).</p>  
 <p>119. Verily We have sent thee<br> In truth as a bearer<br> Of glad tidings and a warner:<br> But of thee no question<br> Shall be asked of the Companions<br> Of the Blazing Fire.</p>  
 <p>120. Never will the Jews<br> Or the Christians be satisfied<br> With thee unless thou follow<br> Their form of religion. Say:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>"The Guidance of God,—that<br> Is the (only) Guidance."<br> Wert thou to follow their desires<br> After the knowledge<br> Which hath reached thee,<br> Then wouldst thou find<br> Neither Protector nor Helper<br> Against God.</p>  
 <p>121. Those to whom We have sent<br> The Book study it as it<br> Should be studied: they are<br> The ones that believe therein:<br> Those who reject faith therein,—<br> The loss is their own.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 15.</h5>  
 <p>122. O Children of Israel! call to mind<br> The special favour which I bestowed<br> Upon you, and that I preferred you<br> To all others (for My Message).</p>  
 <p>123. Then guard yourselves against a Day</p>  
 <p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></a></p>  
 <p>When one soul shall not avail another,<br> Nor shall compensation be<br> accepted from her<br> Nor shall intercession profit her<br> Nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).</p>  
 <p>124. And remember that Abraham<br> Was tried by his Lord<br> With certain Commands,<br> Which he fulfilled:<br> He said: "I will make thee<br> An Imām to the Nations."<br> He pleaded: "And also<br> (Imāms) from my offspring!"<br> He answered: "But My Promise<br> Is not within the reach<br> Of evil-doers."</p>  
 <p>125. Remember We made the House<br> A place of assembly for men<br> And a place of safety;<br> And take ye the Station<br> Of Abraham as a place<br> Of prayer; and We covenanted<br> With Abraham and lsmā’īl,<br> That they should sanctify<br> My House for those who<br> Compass it round, or use it</p>  
 <p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="green">p. 53</font></a></p>  
 <p>As a retreat, or bow, or<br> Prostrate themselves (therein<br> In prayer).</p>  
 <p>126. And remember Abraham said:<br> "My Lord, make this a City<br> Of Peace, and feed its People<br> With fruits,—such of them<br> As believe in God and the Last Day."<br> He said: "(Yea), and such as<br> Reject Faith,—for a while<br> Will I grant them their pleasure,<br> But will soon drive them<br> To the torment of Fire,—<br> An evil destination (indeed)!"</p>  
 <p>127. And remember Abraham<br> And Ismā’īl raised<br> The foundations of the House<br> (With this prayer): "Our Lord!<br> Accept (this service) from us:<br> For Thou art the All-Hearing,<br> The All-Knowing.</p>  
 <p>128. "Our Lord! make of us<br> Muslims, bowing to Thy (Will),<br> And of our progeny a people<br> Muslim, bowing to Thy (Will);<br> And show us our places for<br> The celebration of (due) rites;<br> And turn unto us (in Mercy);<br> For Thou art the Oft-Returning,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  
 <p>129. "Our Lord! send amongst them<br> An Apostle of their own,<br> Who shall rehearse Thy Signs<br> To them and instruct them</p>  
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="green">p. 54</font></a></p>  
 <p>In Scripture and Wisdom,<br> And sanctify them:<br> For Thou art the Exalted in Might,<br> The Wise."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 16.</h5>  
 <p>130. And who turns away<br> From the religion of Abraham<br> But such as debase their souls<br> With folly? Him We chose<br> And rendered pure in this world:<br> And he will be in the Hereafter<br> In the ranks of the Righteous.</p>  
 <p>131. Behold! his Lord said<br> To him: "Bow (thy will to Me):"<br> He said: "I bow (my will)<br> To the Lord and Cherisher<br> Of the Universe."</p>  
 <p>132. And this was the legacy<br> That Abraham left to his sons,<br> And so did Jacob;<br> "Oh my sons! God hath chosen<br> The Faith for you; then die not<br> Except in the Faith of Islam."</p>  
 <p>133. Were ye witnesses<br> When Death appeared before Jacob?<br> Behold, he said to his sons:<br> "What will ye worship after me?"<br> They said: "We shall worship</p>  
 <p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="green">p. 55</font></a></p>  
 <p>Thy God and the God of thy fathers,—<br> Of Abraham, Ismā'īl, and Isaac,—<br> The One (True) God:<br> To Him we bow (in Islam)."</p>  
 <p>134. That was a People that hath<br> Passed away. They shall reap<br> The fruit of what they did,<br> And ye of what ye do!<br> Of their merits<br> There is no question in your case!</p>  
 <p>135. They say: "Become Jews<br> Or Christians if ye would be guided<br> (To salvation)." Say thou:<br> "Nay! (I would rather) the Religion<br> Of Abraham the True,<br> And he joined not gods with God."</p>  
 <p>136. Say ye: "We believe<br> In God, and the revelation<br> Given to us, and to Abraham,<br> Ismā'īl, Isaac, Jacob,<br> And the Tribes, and that given<br> To Moses and Jesus, and that given<br> To (all) Prophets from their Lord:<br> We make no difference<br> Between one and another of them:<br> And we bow to God (in Islam)."</p>  
 <p>137. So if they believe<br> As ye believe, they are indeed<br> On the right path; but if<br> They turn back, it is they</p>  
 <p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></a></p>  
 <p>Who are in schism; but God will<br> Suffice thee as against them,<br> And He is the All-Hearing,<br> The All-Knowing.</p>  
 <p>138. (Our religion is)<br> The Baptism of God:<br> And who can baptize better<br> Than God? And it is He<br> Whom we worship.</p>  
 <p>139. Say: Will ye dispute<br> With us about God, seeing<br> That He is our Lord<br> And your Lord; that we<br> Are responsible for our doings<br> And ye for yours; and that<br> We are sincere (in our faith) In him?</p>  
 <p>140. Or do ye say that<br> Abraham, Ismā'īl, Isaac,<br> Jacob and the Tribes were<br> Jews or Christians?<br> Say: Do ye know better<br> Than God? Ah! who<br> Is more unjust than those<br> Who conceal the testimony<br> They have from God?<br> But God is not unmindful<br> Of what ye do!</p>  
 <p>141. That was a people that hath<br> Passed away. They shall reap<br> The fruit of what they did,<br> And ye of what ye do!<br> Of their merits<br> There is no question in your case:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 17.</h5>  
 <p>142. The Fools among the people<br> Will say: "What hath turned<br> Them from the Qibla to which<br> They were used?" Say:<br> To God belong both East and West:<br> He guideth whom He will<br> To a Way that is straight.</p>  
 <p>143. Thus have We made of you<br> An <i>Ummat</i> justly balanced,<br> That ye might be witnesses<br> Over the nations,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></a></p>  
 <p>And the Apostle a witness<br> Over yourselves;<br> And We appointed the Qibla<br> To which thou wast used,<br> Only to test those who followed<br> The Apostle from those<br> Who would turn on their heels<br> (From the Faith). Indeed it was<br> (A change) momentous, except<br> To those guided by God.<br> And never would God<br> Make your faith of no effect.<br> For God is to all people<br> Most surely full of kindness,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  
 <p>144. We see the turning<br> Of thy face (for guidance)<br> To the heavens: now<br> Shall We turn thee<br> To a Qibla that shall<br> Please thee. Turn then<br> Thy face in the direction<br> Of the sacred Mosque:<br> Wherever ye are, turn<br> Your faces in that direction.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></a></p>  
 <p>The people of the Book<br> Know well that that is<br> The truth from their Lord.<br> Nor is God unmindful<br> Of what they do.</p>  
 <p>145. Even if thou wert to bring<br> To the people of the Book<br> All the Signs (together),<br> They would not follow<br> Thy Qibla; nor art thou<br> Going to follow their Qibla;<br> Nor indeed will they follow<br> Each other's Qibla. If thou<br> After the knowledge hath reached thee,<br> Wert to follow their (vain)<br> Desires,—then wert thou<br> Indeed (clearly) in the wrong.</p>  
 <p>146. The people of the Book<br> Know this as they know<br> Their own sons; but some<br> Of them conceal the truth<br> Which they themselves know.</p>  
 <p>147. The Truth is from thy Lord;<br> So be not at all in doubt.</p>

 <p>149. From whencesoever<br> Thou startest forth, turn<br> Thy face in the direction<br> Of the Sacred Mosque;<br> That is indeed the truth<br> From thy Lord. And God<br> Is not unmindful<br> Of what ye do.</p>  
 <p>150. So from whencesoever<br> Thou startest forth, turn<br> Thy face in the direction<br> Of the Sacred Mosque;<br> And wheresoever ye are,<br> Turn your face thither:<br> That there be no ground<br> Of dispute against you<br> Among the people,<br> Except those of them that are<br> Bent on wickedness; so fear<br> Them not, but fear Me;<br> And that I may complete<br> My favours on you, and ye<br> May (consent to) be guided;</p>

 <p>156. Who say, when afflicted<br> With calamity: "To God<br> We belong, and to Him<br> Is our return":—</p>  
 <p>157. They are those on whom<br> (Descend) blessings from God,<br> And Mercy,<br> And they are the ones<br> That receive guidance.</p>

 <p>166 Then would those<br> Who are followed<br> Clear themselves of those<br> Who follow (them):<br> They would see the Penalty,<br> And all relations<br> Between them would be cut off.</p>  
 <p>167.

 <p>205. When he turns his back,<br> His aim everywhere<br> Is to spread mischief<br> Through the earth and destroy<br> Crops and cattle.<br> But God loveth not mischief.</p>

 <p>241. For divorced women<br> Maintenance (should be provided)<br> On a reasonable (scale).<br> This is a duty<br> On the righteous.</p>  
 <p>242. Thus doth God<br> Make clear His Signs<br> To you: in order that<br> Ye may understand.</p>

 <p>243. Didst thou not<br> Turn by vision to those<br> Who abandoned their homes,<br> Though they were thousands<br> (In number), for fear of death?<br> God said to them: "Die":<br> Then He restored them to life.<br> For God is full of bounty<br> To mankind, but<br> Most of them are ungrateful.</p>  
 <p>244. Then fight in the cause<br> Of God, and know that God<br> Heareth and knoweth all things.</p>  
 <p>245. Who is he<br> That will loan to God<br> A beautiful loan, which God<br> Will double unto his credit<br> And multiply many times?<br> It is God that giveth (you)<br> Want or Plenty,<br> And to Him shall be<br> Your return.</p>  
 <p>246. Hast thou not<br> Turned thy vision to the Chiefs<br> Of the Children of Israel<br> After (the time of) Moses?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></a></p>  
 <p>They said to a Prophet<br> (That was) among them:<br> "Appoint for us a King, that we<br> May fight in the cause of God."<br> He said: "Is it not possible,<br> If ye were commanded<br> To fight, that that ye<br> Will not fight?" They said:<br> "How could we refuse<br> To fight in the cause of God,<br> Seeing that we were turned out<br> Of our homes and our families?"<br> But when they were commanded<br> To fight, they turned back,<br> Except a small band<br> Among them. But God<br> Has full knowledge of those<br> Who do wrong.</p>  
 <p>247. Their Prophet said to them:<br> "God hath appointed<br> Talut as king over you."<br> They said: "How can he<br> Exercise authority over us<br> When we are better fitted<br> Than he to exercise authority,<br> And he is not even gifted,<br> With wealth in abundance?"<br> He said: "God hath<br> Chosen him above you,<br> And hath gifted him<br> Abundantly with knowledge<br> And bodily prowess: God</p>  
 <p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="green">p. 99</font></a></p>  
 <p>Granteth His authority to whom<br> He pleaseth. God careth<br> For all, and He knoweth<br> All things."</p>  
 <p>248. And (further) their Prophet<br> Said to them: "A Sign<br> Of his authority<br> Is that there shall come<br> To you the Ark of the Covenant,<br> With (an assurance) therein<br> Of security from your Lord,<br> And the relics left<br> By the family of Moses<br> And the family of Aaron,<br> Carried by angels.<br> In this is a Symbol<br> For you if ye indeed<br> Have faith."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 33.</h5>  
 <p>249. When Talūt set forth<br> With the armies, he said:<br> "God will test you<br> At the stream: if any<br> Drinks of its water,<br> He goes not with my army:<br> Only those who taste not<br> Of it go with me:<br> A mere sip out of the hand<br> Is excused." But they all<br> Drank of it, except a few.<br> When they crossed the river,—<br> He and the faithful ones with him,<br> They said: "This day<br> We cannot cope<br> With Goliath and his forces."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="green">p. 100</font></a></p>  
 <p>But those who were convinced<br> That they must meet God,<br> Said: "How oft, by God's will,<br> Hath a small force<br> Vanquished a big one?<br> God is with those<br> Who steadfastly persevere."</p>  
 <p>250. When they advanced<br> To meet Goliath and his forces,<br> They prayed: "Our Lord<br> Pour out constancy on us<br> And make our steps firm:<br> Help us against those<br> That reject faith."</p>  
 <p>251. By God's will,<br> They routed them;<br> And David slew Goliath;<br> And God gave him<br> Power and wisdom<br> And taught him<br> Whatever (else) He willed,<br> And did not God<br> Check one set of people<br> By means of another,<br> The earth would indeed<br> Be full of mischief:<br> But God is full of bounty<br> To all the worlds.</p>  
 <p>252. These are the Signs<br> Of God: we rehearse them<br> To thee in truth: verily<br> Thou art one of the Apostles.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="green">p. 101</font></a></p>  
 <p>253. Those apostles<br> Were endowed with gifts,<br> Some above others<br> To one of them God spoke;<br> Others He raised<br> To degrees (of honour);<br> To Jesus the son of Mary<br> We gave Clear (Signs),<br> And strengthened him<br> With the holy spirit.<br> If God had so willed,<br> Succeeding generations<br> Would not have fought<br> Among each other, after<br> Clear (Signs) had come to them,<br> But they (chose) to wrangle,<br> Some believing and Others<br> Rejecting. If God had so willed,<br> They would not have fought<br> Each other; but God<br> Fulfilleth His plan.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="green">p. 102</font></a></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 34.</h5>  
 <p>254. O ye who believe!<br> Spend out of (the bounties)<br> We have provided for you,<br> Before the Day comes<br> When no bargaining<br> (Will avail), nor friendship<br> Nor intercession.<br> Those who reject Faith—they<br> Are the wrong-doers.</p>  
 <p>255. God! There is no god<br> But He,—the Living,<br> The Self-subsisting, Eternal.<br> No slumber can seize Him<br> Nor sleep. His are all things<br> In the heavens and on earth.<br> Who is there can intercede<br> In His presence except<br> As He permitteth? He knoweth<br> What (appeareth to His creatures</p>  
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="green">p. 103</font></a></p>  
 <p>As) Before or After<br> Or Behind them.<br> Nor shall they compass<br> Aught of His knowledge<br> Except as He willeth.<br> His Throne doth extend<br> Over the heavens<br> And the earth, and He feeleth<br> No fatigue in guarding,<br> And preserving them<br> For He is the Most High,<br> The Supreme (in glory).</p>  
 <p>256. Let there be no compulsion<br> In religion: Truth stands out<br> Clear from Error: whoever<br> Rejects Evil and believes<br> In God hath grasped<br> The most trustworthy<br> Hand-hold, that never breaks.<br> And God heareth<br> And knoweth all things.</p>  
 <p>257. God is the Protector<br> Of those who have faith:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="green">p. 104</font></a></p>  
 <p>From the depths of darkness<br> He will lead them forth<br> Into light. Of those<br> Who reject faith the patrons<br> Are the Evil Ones: from light<br> They will lead them forth<br> Into the depths of darkness.<br> They will be Companions<br> Of the fire, to dwell therein<br> (For ever).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 35.</h5>  
 <p>258. Hast thou not<br> Turned thy vision to one<br> Who disputed with Abraham<br> About his Lord, because<br> God had granted him<br> Power? Abraham said:<br> "My Lord is He Who<br> Giveth life and death."<br> He said: "I give life and death."<br> Said Abraham: "But it is God<br> That causeth the sun<br> To rise from the East:<br> Do thou then cause him<br> To rise from the West."<br> Thus was he confounded<br> Who (in arrogance) rejected<br> Faith. Nor doth God<br> Give guidance<br> To a people unjust.</p>  
 <p>259. Or (take) the similitude<br> Of one who passed</p>  
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></a></p>  
 <p>By a hamlet, all in ruins<br> To its roofs. He said:<br> "Oh! how shall God<br> Bring it (ever) to life,<br> After (this) its death?"<br> But God caused him<br> To die for a hundred years,<br> Then raised him up (again).<br> He said: "How long<br> Didst thou tarry (thus)?"<br> He said: "(Perhaps) a day<br> Or part of a day." He said:<br> "Nay, thou hast tarried<br> Thus a hundred years;<br> But look at thy food<br> And thy drink; they show<br> No signs of age; and look<br> At thy donkey: and that<br> We may make of thee<br> A Sign unto the people,<br> Look further at the bones,<br> How We bring them together<br> And clothe them with flesh."<br> When this was shown clearly<br> To him, he said: "I know<br> That God hath power<br> Over all things."</p>  
 <p>260. Behold! Abraham said:<br> "My Lord! Show me how<br> Thou givest life to the dead."<br> He said: "Dost thou not<br> Then believe?" He said:<br> "Yea! but to satisfy</p>  
 <p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="green">p. 106</font></a></p>  
 <p>My own understanding."<br> He said: "Take four birds;<br> Tame them to turn to thee;<br> Put a portion of them<br> On every hill, and call to them:<br> They will come to thee<br> (Flying) with speed.<br> Then know that God<br> Is Exalted in Power, Wise."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 36.</h5>  
 <p>261. The parable of those<br> Who spend their substance<br> In the way of God is that<br> Of a grain of corn: it groweth<br> Seven ears, and each ear<br> Hath a hundred grains.<br> God giveth manifold increase<br> To whom He pleaseth:<br> And God careth for all<br> And He knoweth all things</p>  
 <p>262. Those who spend<br> Their substance in the cause<br> Of God, and follow not up<br> Their gifts with reminders<br> Of their generosity<br> Or with injury,—for them<br> Their reward is with their Lord:<br> On them shall be no fear,<br> Nor shall they grieve.</p>  
 <p>263. Kind words<br> And the covering of faults</p>  
 <p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 107</font></a></p>  
 <p>Are better than charity<br> Followed by injury.<br> God is Free of all wants,<br> And He is most Forbearing.</p>  
 <p>264. O ye who believe!<br> Cancel not your charity<br> By reminders of your generosity<br> Or by injury,—like those<br> Who spend their substance<br> To be seen of men,<br> But believe neither<br> In God nor in the Last Day.<br> They are in Parable like a hard,<br> Barren rock, on which<br> Is a little soil: on it<br> Falls heavy rain,<br> Which leaves it<br> (Just) a bare stone.<br> They will be able to do nothing<br> With aught they have earned.<br> And God guideth not<br> Those who reject faith.</p>  
 <p>265. And the likeness of those<br> Who spend their substance,<br> Seeking to please God<br> And to strengthen their souls,<br> Is as a garden, high<br> And fertile: heavy rain<br> Falls on it but makes it yield<br> A double increase<br> Of harvest, and if it receives not<br> Heavy rain, light moisture<br> Sufficeth it. God seeth well<br> Whatever ye do.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="green">p. 108</font></a></p>  
 <p>266. Does any of you wish<br> That he should have a garden<br> With date-palms and vines<br> And streams flowing<br> Underneath, and all kinds<br> Of fruit, while he is stricken<br> With old age, and his children<br> Are not strong (enough<br> To look after themselves)—<br> That it should be caught<br> In a whirlwind,<br> With fire therein,<br> And be burnt up?<br> Thus doth God make clear<br> To you (His) Signs;<br> That ye may consider.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 37.</h5>  
 <p>267. O ye who believe!<br> Give of the good things<br> Which ye have (honourably) earned,<br> And of the fruits of the earth<br> Which We have produced</p>  
 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></a></p>  
 <p>For you, and do not even aim<br> At getting anything<br> Which is bad, in order that<br> Out of it ye may give away<br> Something, when ye yourselves<br> Would not receive it<br> Except with closed eyes.<br> And know that God<br> Is Free of all wants,<br> And Worthy of all praise.</p>  
 <p>268. The Evil One threatens<br> You with poverty<br> And bids you to conduct<br> Unseemly. God promiseth<br> You His forgiveness<br> And bounties.<br> And God careth for all<br> And He knoweth all things.</p>  
 <p>269. He granteth wisdom<br> To whom He pleaseth;<br> And he to whom wisdom<br> Is granted receiveth<br> Indeed a benefit overflowing;<br> But none will grasp the Message<br> But men of understanding.</p>  
 <p>270. And whatever ye spend<br> In charity or devotion,<br> Be sure God knows it all.<br> But the wrong-doers<br> Have no helpers.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></a></p>  
 <p>271. If ye disclose (acts<br> Of) charity, even so<br> It is well,<br> But if ye conceal them,<br> And make them reach<br> Those (really) in need,<br> That is best for you:<br> It will remove from you<br> Some of your (stains<br> Of) evil. And God<br> Is well acquainted<br> With what ye do.</p>  
 <p>272. It is not required<br> Of thee (O Apostle),<br> To set them on the right path,<br> But God sets on the right path<br> Whom He pleaseth.<br> Whatever of good ye give<br> Benefits your own souls,<br> And ye shall only do so<br> Seeking the "Face"<br> Of God. Whatever good<br> Ye give, shall be<br> Rendered back to you,<br> And ye shall not<br> Be dealt with unjustly.</p>  
 <p>273. (Charity is) for those<br> In need, who, in God's cause<br> Are restricted (from travel),<br> And cannot move about</p>  
 <p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></a></p>  
 <p>In the land, seeking<br> (For trade or work):<br> The ignorant man thinks,<br> Because of their modesty,<br> That they are free from want.<br> Thou shaltḳnow them<br> By their (unfailing) mark:<br> They beg not importunately<br> From all and sundry.<br> And whatever of good<br> Ye give, be assured<br> God knoweth it well.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 38.</h5>  
 <p>274. Whose who (in charity)<br> Spend of their goods<br> By night and by day,<br> In secret and in public,<br> Have their reward<br> With their Lord:<br> On them shall be no fear,<br> Nor shall they grieve.</p>  
 <p>275. Those who devour usury<br> Will not stand except<br> As stands one whom<br> The Evil One by his touch<br> Hath driven to madness.<br> That is because they say:<br> "Trade is like usury,"<br> But God hath permitted trade</p>  
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></a></p>  
 <p>And forbidden usury.<br> Those who after receiving<br> Direction from their Lord,<br> Desist, shall be pardoned<br> For the past; their case<br> Is for God (to judge);<br> But those who repeat<br> (The offence) are Companions<br> Of the Fire: they will<br> Abide therein (for ever).</p>  
 <p>276. God will deprive<br> Usury of all blessing,<br> But will give increase<br> For deeds of charity:<br> For He loveth not<br> Creatures ungrateful<br> And wicked.</p>  
 <p>277. Those who believe,<br> And do deeds of righteousness,<br> And establish regular prayers<br> And regular charity,<br> Will have their reward<br> With their Lord:<br> On them shall be no fear,<br> Nor shall they grieve.</p>  
 <p>278. O ye who believe!<br> Fear God, and give up<br> What remains of your demand<br> For usury, if ye are<br> Indeed believers.</p>  
 <p>279. If ye do it not,<br> Take notice of war<br> From God and His Apostle:<br> But if ye turn back,<br> Ye shall have<br> Your capital sums:<br> Deal not unjustly,<br> And ye shall not<br> Be dealt with unjustly.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></a></p>  
 <p>280. If the debtor is<br> In a difficulty,<br> Grant him time<br> Till it is easy<br> For him to repay.<br> But if ye remit it<br> By way of charity,<br> That is best for you<br> If ye only knew.</p>  
 <p>281. And fear the Day<br> When ye shall be<br> Brought back to God.<br> Then shall every soul<br> Be paid what it earned,<br> And none shall be<br> Dealt with unjustly.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 39.</h5>  
 <p>282. O ye who believe!<br> When ye deal with each other,<br> In transactions involving<br> Future obligations<br> In a fixed period of time,<br> Reduce them to writing<br> Let a scribe write down<br> Faithfully as between<br> The parties: let not the scribe<br> Refuse to write: as God<br> Has taught him,<br> So let him write.<br> Let him who incurs<br> The liability dictate,<br> But let him fear<br> His Lord God,<br> And not diminish<br> Aught of what he owes.<br> If the party liable<br> Is mentally deficient,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></a></p>  
 <p>Or weak, or unable<br> Himself to dictate,<br> Let his guardian<br> Dictate faithfully.<br> And get two witnesses,<br> Out of your own men,<br> And if there are not two men,<br> Then a man and two women,<br> Such as ye choose,<br> For witnesses,<br> So that if one of them errs,<br> The other can remind her.<br> The witnesses<br> Should not refuse<br> When they are called on<br> (For evidence).<br> Disdain not to reduce<br> To writing (your contract)<br> For a future period,<br> Whether it be small<br> Or big: it is juster<br> In the sight of God,<br> More suitable as evidence,<br> And more convenient<br> To prevent doubts<br> Among yourselves<br> But if it be a transaction<br> Which ye carry out<br> On the spot among yourselves,<br> There is no blame on you<br> If ye reduce it not<br> To writing.<br> But take witnesses<br> Whenever ye make<br> A commercial contract;<br> And let neither scribe<br> Nor witness suffer harm.<br> If ye do (such harm),<br> It would be wickedness<br> In you. So fear God;<br> For it is God<br> That teaches you.<br> And God is well acquainted<br> With all things.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></a></p>  
 <p>283. If ye are on a journey,<br> And cannot find<br> A scribe, a pledge<br> With possession (may serve<br> The purpose).<br> And if one of you<br> Deposits a thing<br> On trust with another,<br> Let the trustee<br> (Faithfully) discharge<br> His trust, and let him<br> Fear his Lord.<br> Conceal not evidence;<br> For whoever conceals it,—<br> His heart is tainted<br> With sin. And God<br> Knoweth all that ye do.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 40.</h5>  
 <p>284. To God belongeth all<br> That is in the heavens<br> And on earth. Whether<br> Ye show what is in your minds<br> Or conceal it, God<br> Calleth you to account for it.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></a></p>  
 <p>He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,<br> And punishefh whom He pleaseth.<br> For God hath power<br> Over all things.</p>  
 <p>285. The Apostle believeth<br> In what hath been revealed<br> To him from his Lord,<br> As do the men of faith.<br> Each one (of them) believeth<br> In God, His angels,<br> His books, and His apostles.<br> "We make no distinction (they say)<br> Between one and another<br> Of His apostles."

 <p>286. On no soul doth God<br> Place a burden greater<br> Than it can bear.<br> It gets every good that it earns,<br> And it suffers every ill that if earns.<br> (Pray:) "Our Lord!<br> Condemn us not<br> If we forget or fall<br> Into error; our Lord!<br> Lay not on us a burden<br> Like that which Thou<br> Didst lay on those before us;</p>
