 <i>Prince Arthure ouercomes the great<br>
 Gerioneo in fight:<br>
 Doth slay the Monster, and restore<br>
 Belge vnto her right.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 I
 T often fals in course of common life,<br>
 That right long time is ouerborne of wrong,<br>
 Through auarice, or powre, or guile, or strife,<br>
 That weakens her, and makes her party strong:<br>
 But Iustice, though her dome she doe prolong,<br>
 Yet at the last she will her owne cause right.<br>
 As by sad <i>Belge</i> seemes, whose wrongs though long<br>
 She suffred, yet at length she did requight,<br>
 And sent redresse thereof by this braue Briton Knight.<p>
 
 Whereof when newes was to that Tyrant brought,<br>
 How that the Lady <i>Belge</i> now had found<br>
 A Champion, that had with his Champion fought,<br>
 And laid his Seneschall low on the ground,<br>
 And eke him selfe did threaten to confound,<br>
 He gan to burne in rage, and friese in feare,<br>
 Doubting sad end of principle vnsound:<br>
 Yet sith he heard but one, that did appeare,<br>
 He did him selfe encourage, and take better cheare.</p><p>
 
 Nathelesse him selfe he armed all in hast,<br>
 And forth he far'd with all his many bad,<br>
 Ne stayed step, till that he came at last<br>
 Vnto the Castle, which they conquerd had.<br>
 There with huge terrour, to be more ydrad,<br>
 He sternely marcht before the Castle gate,<br>
 And with bold vaunts, and ydle threatning bad<br>
 Deliuer him his owne, ere yet too late,<br>
 To which they had no right, nor any wrongfull state.</p><p>
 
 The Prince staid not his aunswere to deuize,<br>
 But opening streight the Sparre, forth to him came,<br>
 Full nobly mounted in right warlike wize;<br>
 And asked him, if that he were the same,<br>
 Who all that wrong vnto that wofull Dame<br>
 So long had done, and from her natiue land<br>
 Exiled her, that all the world spake shame.<br>
 He boldly aunswerd him, he there did stand<br>
 That would his doings iustifie with his owne hand.</p><p>
 
 With that so furiously at him he flew,<br>
 As if he would haue ouerrun him streight,<br>
 And with his huge great yron axe gan hew<br>
 So hideously vppon his armour bright,<br>
 As he to peeces would haue chopt it quight:<br>
 That the bold Prince was forced foote to giue<br>
 To his first rage, and yeeld to his despight;<br>
 The whilest at him so dreadfully he driue,<br>
 That seem'd a marble rocke asunder could haue riue.</p><p>
 
 Thereto a great aduauntage eke he has<br>
 Through his three double hands thrise multiplyde,<br>
 Besides the double strength, which in them was:<br>
 For stil when fit occasion did betyde,<br>
 He could his weapon shift from side to syde,<br>
 From hand to hand, and with such nimblesse sly<br>
 Could wield about, that ere it were espide,<br>
 The wicked stroke did wound his enemy,<br>
 Behinde, beside, before, as he it list apply.</p><p>
 
 Which vncouth vse when as the Prince perceiued,<br>
 He gan to watch the wielding of his hand,<br>
 Least by such slight he were vnwares deceiued;<br>
 And euer ere he saw the stroke to land,<br>
 He would it meete, and warily withstand.<br>
 One time, when he his weapon faynd to shift,<br>
 As he was wont, and chang'd from hand to hand,<br>
 He met him with a counterstroke so swift,<br>
 That quite smit off his arme, as he it vp did lift.</p><p>
 
 Therewith, all fraught with fury and disdaine,<br>
 He brayd aloud for very fell despight;<br>
 And sodainely t'auenge him selfe againe,<br>
 Gan into one assemble all the might<br>
 Of all his hands, and heaued them on hight,<br>
 Thinking to pay him with that one for all:<br>
 But the sad steele seizd not, where it was hight,<br>
 Vppon the childe, but somewhat short did fall,<br>
 And lighting on his horses head, him quite did mall.</p><p>
 
 Downe streight to ground fell his astonisht steed,<br>
 And eke to th'earth his burden with him bare:<br>
 But he him selfe full lightly from him freed,<br>
 And gan him selfe to fight on foote prepare.<br>
 Whereof when as the Gyant was aware,<br>
 He wox right blyth, as he had got thereby,<br>
 And laught so loud, that all his teeth wide bare<br>
 One might haue seene enraung'd disorderly,<br>
 Like to a rancke of piles, that pitched are awry.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones againe his axe he raught on hie,<br>
 Ere he were throughly buckled to his geare;<br>
 And can let driue at him so dreadfullie,<br>
 That had he chaunced not his shield to reare,<br>
 Ere that huge stroke arriued on him neare,<br>
 He had him surely clouen quite in twaine.<br>
 But th'Adamantine shield, which he did beare,<br>
 So well was tempred, that for all his maine,<br>
 It would no passage yeeld vnto his purpose vaine.</p><p>
 
 Yet was the stroke so forcibly applide,<br>
 That made him stagger with vncertaine sway,<br>
 As if he would haue tottered to one side.<br>
 Wherewith full wroth, he fiercely gan assay,<br>
 That curt'sie with like kindnesse to repay;<br>
 And smote at him with so importune might,<br>
 That two more of his armes did fall away,<br>
 Like fruitlesse braunches, which the hatchets slight<br>
 Hath pruned from the natiue tree, and cropped quight.</p><p>
 
 With that all mad and furious he grew,<br>
 Like a fell mastiffe through enraging heat,<br>
 And curst, and band, and blasphemies forth threw,<br>
 Against his Gods, and fire to them did threat,<br>
 And hell vnto him selfe with horrour great.<br>
 Thenceforth he car'd no more, which way he strooke,<br>
 Nor where it light, but gan to chaufe and sweat,<br>
 And gnasht his teeth, and his head at him shooke,<br>
 And sternely him beheld with grim and ghastly looke.</p><p>
 
 Nought fear'd the childe his lookes, ne yet his threats,<br>
 But onely wexed now the more aware,<br>
 To saue him selfe from those his furious heats,<br>
 And watch aduauntage, how to worke his care:<br>
 The which good Fortune to him offred faire.<br>
 For as he in his rage him ouerstrooke,<br>
 He ere he could his weapon backe repaire,<br>
 His side all bare and naked ouertooke,<br>
 And with his mortal steel quite throgh the body strooke.</p><p>
 
 Through all three bodies he him strooke attonce;<br>
 That all the three attonce fell on the plaine:<br>
 Else should he thrise haue needed, for the nonce<br>
 Them to haue stricken, and thrise to haue slaine.<br>
 So now all three one sencelesse lumpe remaine,<br>
 Enwallow'd in his owne blacke bloudy gore,<br>
 And byting th'earth for very deaths disdaine;<br>
 Who with a cloud of night him couering, bore<br>
 Downe to the house of dole, his daies there to deplore.</p><p>
 
 Which when the Lady from the Castle saw,<br>
 Where she with her two sonnes did looking stand,<br>
 She towards him in hast her selfe did draw,<br>
 To greet him the good fortune of his hand:<br>
 And all the people both of towne and land,<br>
 Which there stood gazing from the Citties wall<br>
 Vppon these warriours, greedy t'vnderstand,<br>
 To whether should the victory befall,<br>
 Now when they saw it falne, they eke him greeted all.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Belge</i> with her sonnes prostrated low<br>
 Before his feete, in all that peoples sight;<br>
 Mongst ioyes mixing some tears, mongst wele, some wo,<br>
 Him thus bespake; O most redoubted Knight<br>
 The which hast me, of all most wretched wight,<br>
 That earst was dead, restor'd to life againe,<br>
 And these weake impes replanted by thy might;<br>
 What guerdon can I giue thee for thy paine,<br>
 But euen that which thou sauedst, thine still to remaine?</p><p>
 
 He tooke her vp forby the lilly hand,<br>
 And her recomforted the best he might,<br>
 Saying; Deare Lady, deedes ought not be scand<br>
 By th'authors manhood, nor the doers might,<br>
 But by their trueth and by the causes right:<br>
 That same is it, which fought for you this day.<br>
 What other meed then need me to requight,<br>
 But that which yeeldeth vertues meed alway?<br>
 That is the vertue selfe, which her reward doth pay.</p><p>
 
 She humbly thankt him for that wondrous grace,<br>
 And further sayd; Ah Sir, but mote ye please,<br>
 Sith ye thus farre haue tendred my poore case,<br>
 As from my chiefest foe me to release,<br>
 That your victorious arme will not yet cease,<br>
 Till ye haue rooted all the relickes out<br>
 Of that vilde race, and stablished my peace.<br>
 What is there else (sayd he) left of their rout?<br>
 Declare it boldly Dame, and doe not stand in dout.</p><p>
 
 Then wote you, Sir, that in this Church hereby,<br>
 There stands an Idole of great note and name,<br>
 The which this Gyant reared first on hie,<br>
 And of his owne vaine fancies thought did frame:<br>
 To whom for endlesse horrour of his shame,<br>
 He offred vp for daily sacrifize<br>
 My children and my people, burnt in flame;<br>
 With all the tortures, that he could deuize,<br>
 The more t'aggrate his God with such his blouddy guize.</p><p>
 
 And vnderneath this Idoll there doth lie<br>
 An hideous monster, that doth it defend,<br>
 And feedes on all the carkasses, that die<br>
 In sacrifize vnto that cursed feend:<br>
 Whose vgly shape none euer saw, nor kend,<br>
 That euer scap'd: for of a man they say<br>
 It has the voice, that speaches forth doth send,<br>
 Euen blasphemous words, which she doth bray<br>
 Out of her poysnous entrails, fraught with dire decay.</p><p>
 
 Which when the Prince heard tell, his heart gan earne<br>
 For great desire, that Monster to assay,<br>
 And prayd the place of her abode to learne.<br>
 Which being shew'd, he gan him selfe streight way<br>
 Thereto addresse, and his bright shield display.<br>
 So to the Church he came, where it was told,<br>
 The Monster vnderneath the Altar lay;<br>
 There he that Idoll saw of massy gold<br>
 Most richly made, but there no Monster did behold.</p><p>
 
 Vpon the Image with his naked blade<br>
 Three times, as in defiance, there he strooke;<br>
 And the third time out of an hidden shade,<br>
 There forth issewd, from vnder th'Altars smooke,<br>
 A dreadfull feend, with fowle deformed looke,<br>
 That stretcht it selfe, as it had long lyen still;<br>
 And her long taile and fethers strongly shooke,<br>
 That all the Temple did with terrour fill;<br>
 Yet him nought terrifide, that feared nothing ill.</p><p>
 
 An huge great Beast it was, when it in length<br>
 Was stretched forth, that nigh fild all the place,<br>
 And seem'd to be of infinite great strength;<br>
 Horrible, hideous, and of hellish race,<br>
 Borne of the brooding of <i>Echidna</i> base,<br>
 Or other like infernall furies kinde:<br>
 For of a Mayd she had the outward face,<br>
 To hide the horrour, which did lurke behinde,<br>
 The better to beguile, whom she so fond did finde.</p><p>
 
 Thereto the body of a dog she had,<br>
 Full of fell rauin and fierce greedinesse;<br>
 A Lions clawes, with powre and rigour clad,<br>
 To rend and teare, what so she can oppresse;<br>
 A Dragons taile, whose sting without redresse<br>
 Full deadly wounds, where so it is empight;<br>
 And Eagles wings, for scope and speedinesse,<br>
 That nothing may escape her reaching might,<br>
 Whereto she euer list to make her hardy flight.</p><p>
 
 Much like in foulnesse and deformity<br>
 Vnto that Monster, whom the Theban Knight,<br>
 The father of that fatall progeny,<br>
 Made kill her selfe for very hearts despight,<br>
 That he had red her Riddle, which no wight<br>
 Could euer loose, but suffred deadly doole.<br>
 So also did this Monster vse like slight<br>
 To many a one, which came vnto her schoole,<br>
 Whom she did put to death, deceiued like a foole.</p><p>
 
 She comming forth, when as she first beheld<br>
 The armed Prince, with shield so blazing bright,<br>
 Her ready to assaile, was greatly queld,<br>
 And much dismayd with that dismayfull sight,<br>
 That backe she would haue turnd for great affright.<br>
 But he gan her with courage fierce assay,<br>
 That forst her turne againe in her despight,<br>
 To saue her selfe, least that he did her slay:<br>
 And sure he had her slaine, had she not turnd her way.</p><p>
 
 Tho when she saw, that she was forst to fight,<br>
 She flew at him, like to an hellish feend,<br>
 And on his shield tooke hold with all her might,<br>
 As if that it she would in peeces rend,<br>
 Or reaue out of the hand, that did it hend.<br>
 Strongly he stroue out of her greedy gripe<br>
 To loose his shield, and long while did contend:<br>
 But when he could not quite it, with one stripe<br>
 Her Lions clawes he from her feete away did wipe.</p><p>
 
 With that aloude she gan to bray and yell,<br>
 And fowle blasphemous speaches forth did cast,<br>
 And bitter curses, horrible to tell,<br>
 That euen the Temple, wherein she was plast,<br>
 Did quake to heare, and nigh asunder brast.<br>
 Tho with her huge long taile she at him strooke,<br>
 That made him stagger, and stand halfe agast<br>
 With trembling ioynts, as he for terrour shooke;<br>
 Who nought was terrifide, but greater courage tooke.</p><p>
 
 As when the Mast of some well timbred hulke<br>
 Is with the blast of some outragious storme<br>
 Blowne downe, it shakes the bottome of the bulke,<br>
 And makes her ribs to cracke, as they were torne,<br>
 Whilest still she stands as stonisht and forlorne:<br>
 So was he stound with stroke of her huge taile.<br>
 But ere that it she backe againe had borne,<br>
 He with his sword it strooke, that without faile<br>
 He ioynted it, and mard the swinging of her flaile.</p><p>
 
 Then gan she cry much louder then afore,<br>
 That all the people there without it heard,<br>
 And <i>Belge</i> selfe was therewith stonied sore,<br>
 As if the onely sound thereof she feard.<br>
 But then the feend her selfe more fiercely reard<br>
 Vppon her wide great wings, and strongly flew<br>
 With all her body at his head and beard;<br>
 That had he not foreseene with heedfull vew,<br>
 And thrown his shield atween, she had him done to rew.</p><p>
 
 But as she prest on him with heauy sway,<br>
 Vnder her wombe his fatall sword he thrust,<br>
 And for her entrailes made an open way,<br>
 To issue forth; the which once being brust,<br>
 Like to a great Mill damb forth fiercely gusht,<br>
 And powred out of her infernall sinke<br>
 Most vgly filth, and poyson therewith rusht,<br>
 That him nigh choked with the deadly stinke:<br>
 Such loathly matter were small lust to speake, or thinke.</p><p>
 
 Then downe to ground fell that deformed Masse,<br>
 Breathing out clouds of sulphure fowle and blacke,<br>
 In which a puddle of contagion was,<br>
 More loathd then <i>Lerna</i>, or then <i>Stygian</i> lake,<br>
 That any man would nigh awhaped make.<br>
 Whom when he saw on ground, he was full glad,<br>
 And streight went forth his gladnesse to partake<br>
 With <i>Belge</i>, who watcht all this while full sad,<br>
 Wayting what end would be of that same daunger drad.</p><p>
 
 Whom when she saw so ioyously come forth,<br>
 She gan reioyce, and shew triumphant chere,<br>
 Lauding and praysing his renowmed worth,<br>
 By all the names that honorable were.<br>
 Then in he brought her, and her shewed there<br>
 The present of his paines, that Monsters spoyle,<br>
 And eke that Idoll deem'd so costly dere;<br>
 Whom he did all to peeces breake and foyle<br>
 In filthy durt, and left so in the loathely soyle.</p><p>
 
 Then all the people, which beheld that day,<br>
 Gan shout aloud, that vnto heauen it rong;<br>
 And all the damzels of that towne in ray,<br>
 Came dauncing forth, and ioyous carrols song:<br>
 So him they led through all their streetes along,<br>
 Crowned with girlonds of immortall baies,<br>
 And all the vulgar did about them throng,<br>
 To see the man, whose euerlasting praise<br>
 They all were bound to all posterities to raise.</p><p>
 
 There he with <i>Belge</i> did a while remaine,<br>
 Making great feast and ioyous merriment,<br>
 Vntill he had her settled in her raine,<br>
 With safe assuraunce and establishment.<br>
 Then to his first emprize his mind he lent,<br>
 Full loath to <i>Belge</i>, and to all the rest:<br>
 Of whom yet taking leaue, thenceforth he went<br>
 And to his former iourney him addrest,<br>
 On which long way he rode, ne euer day did rest.</p><p>
 
 But turne we now to noble <i>Artegall</i>;<br>
 Who hauing left <i>Mercilla</i>, streight way went<br>
 On his first quest, the which him forth did call,<br>
 To weet to worke <i>Irenaes</i> franchisement,<br>
 And eke <i>Grantortoes</i> worthy punishment.<br>
 So forth he fared as his manner was,<br>
 With onely <i>Talus</i> wayting diligent,<br>
 Through many perils and much way did pas,<br>
 Till nigh vnto the place at length approcht he has.</p><p>
 
 There as he traueld by the way, he met<br>
 An aged wight, wayfaring all alone,<br>
 Who through his yeares long since aside had set<br>
 The vse of armes, and battell quite forgone:<br>
 To whom as he approcht, he knew anone,<br>
 That it was he which whilome did attend<br>
 On faire <i>Irene</i> in her affliction,<br>
 When first to Faery court he saw her wend,<br>
 Vnto his soueraine Queene her suite for to commend.</p><p>
 
 Whom by his name saluting, thus he gan;<br>
 Haile good Sir <i>Sergis</i>, truest Knight aliue,<br>
 Well tride in all thy Ladies troubles than,<br>
 When her that Tyrant did of Crowne depriue;<br>
 What new ocasion doth thee hither driue,<br>
 Whiles she alone is left, and thou here found?<br>
 Or is she thrall, or doth she not suruiue?<br>
 To whom he thus; She liueth sure and sound;<br>
 But by that Tyrant is in wretched thraldome bound.</p><p>
 
 For she presuming on th'appointed tyde,<br>
 In which ye promist, as ye were a Knight,<br>
 To meete her at the saluage Ilands syde,<br>
 And then and there for triall of her right<br>
 With her vnrighteous enemy to fight,<br>
 Did thither come, where she afrayd of nought,<br>
 By guilefull treason and by subtill slight<br>
 Surprized was, and to <i>Grantorto</i> brought,<br>
 Who her imprisond hath, and her life often sought.</p><p>
 
 And now he hath to her prefixt a day,<br>
 By which if that no champion doe appeare,<br>
 Which will her cause in battailous array<br>
 Against him iustifie, and proue her cleare<br>
 Of all those crimes, that he gainst her doth reare,<br>
 She death shall by.  Those tidings sad<br>
 Did much abash Sir <i>Artegall</i> to heare,<br>
 And grieued sore, that through his fault she had<br>
 Fallen into that Tyrants hand and vsage bad.</p><p>
 
 Then thus replide; Now sure and by my life,<br>
 Too much am I to blame for that faire Maide,<br>
 That haue her drawne to all this troublous strife,<br>
 Through promise to afford her timely aide,<br>
 Which by default I haue not yet defraide.<br>
 But witnesse vnto me, ye heauens, that know<br>
 How cleare I am from blame of this vpbraide:<br>
 For ye into like thraldome me did throw,<br>
 And kept from complishing the faith, which I did owe.</p><p>
 
 But now aread, Sir <i>Sergis</i>, how long space,<br>
 Hath he her lent, a Champion to prouide?<br>
 Ten daies (quoth he) he graunted hath of grace,<br>
 For that he weeneth well, before that tide<br>
 None can haue tidings to assist her side.<br>
 For all the shores, which to the sea accoste,<br>
 He day and night doth ward both far and wide,<br>
 That none can there arriue without an hoste:<br>
 So her he deemes already but a damned ghoste.</p><p>
 
 Now turne againe (Sir <i>Artegall</i> then sayd)<br>
 For if I liue till those ten daies haue end,<br>
 Assure your selfe, Sir Knight, she shall haue ayd,<br>
 Though I this dearest life for her doe spend;<br>
 So backeward he attone with him did wend.<br>
 Tho as they rode together on their way,<br>
 A rout of people they before them kend,<br>
 Flocking together in confusde array,<br>
 As if that there were some tumultuous affray.</p><p>
 
 To which as they approcht, the cause to know,<br>
 They saw a Knight in daungerous distresse<br>
 Of a rude rout him chasing to and fro,<br>
 That sought with lawlesse powre him to oppresse,<br>
 And bring in bondage of their brutishnesse:<br>
 And farre away, amid their rakehell bands,<br>
 They spide a Lady left all succourlesse,<br>
 Crying, and holding vp her wretched hands<br>
 To him for aide, who long in vaine their rage withstands.</p><p>
 
 Yet still he striues, ne any perill spares,<br>
 To reskue her from their rude violence,<br>
 And like a Lion wood amongst them fares,<br>
 Dealing his dreadfull blowes with large dispence,<br>
 Gainst which the pallid death findes no defence.<br>
 But all in vaine, their numbers are so great,<br>
 That naught may boot to banishe them from thence:<br>
 For soone as he their outrage backe doth beat,<br>
 They turne afresh, and oft renew their former threat.</p><p>
 
 And now they doe so sharpely him assay,<br>
 That they his shield in peeces battred haue,<br>
 And forced him to throw it quite away,<br>
 Fro dangers dread his doubtfull life to saue;<br>
 Albe that it most safety to him gaue,<br>
 And much did magnifie his noble name.<br>
 For from the day that he thus did it leaue,<br>
 Amongst all Knights he blotted was with blame,<br>
 And counted but a recreant Knight, with endles shame.</p><p>
 
 Whom when they thus distressed did behold,<br>
 They drew vnto his aide; but that rude rout<br>
 Them also gan assaile with outrage bold,<br>
 And forced them, how euer strong and stout<br>
 They were, as well approu'd in many a doubt,<br>
 Backe to recule; vntill that yron man<br>
 With his huge flaile began to lay about;<br>
 From whose sterne presence they diffused ran,<br>
 Like scattred chaffe, the which the wind away doth fan.</p><p>
 
 So when that Knight from perill cleare was freed,<br>
 He drawing neare, began to greete them faire,<br>
 And yeeld great thankes for their so goodly deed,<br>
 In sauing him from daungerous despaire<br>
 Of those, which sought his life for to empaire.<br>
 Of whom Sir <i>Artegall</i> gan then enquire<br>
 The whole occasion of his late misfare,<br>
 And who he was, and what those villaines were,<br>
 The which with mortall malice him pursu'd so nere.</p><p>
 
 To whom he thus; My name is <i>Burbon</i> hight,<br>
 Well knowne, and far renowmed heretofore,<br>
 Vntill late mischiefe did vppon me light,<br>
 That all my former praise hath blemisht sore;<br>
 And that faire Lady, which in that vprore<br>
 Ye with those caytiues saw, <i>Flourdelis</i> hight,<br>
 Is mine owne loue, though me she haue forlore,<br>
 Whether withheld from me by wrongfull might,<br>
 Or with her owne good will, I cannot read aright.</p><p>
 
 But sure to me her faith she first did plight,<br>
 To be my loue, and take me for her Lord,<br>
 Till that a Tyrant, which <i>Grandtorto</i> hight,<br>
 With golden giftes and many a guilefull word<br>
 Entyced her, to him for to accord.<br>
 O who may not with gifts and words be tempted?<br>
 Sith which she hath me euer since abhord,<br>
 And to my foe hath guilefully consented:<br>
 Ay me, that euer guyle in wemen was inuented.</p><p>
 
 And now he hath this troupe of villains sent,<br>
 By open force to fetch her quite away:<br>
 Gainst whom my selfe I long in vaine haue bent,<br>
 To rescue her, and daily meanes assay,<br>
 Yet rescue her thence by no meanes I may:<br>
 For they doe me with multitude oppresse,<br>
 And with vnequall might doe ouerlay,<br>
 That oft I driuen am to great distresse,<br>
 And forced to forgoe th'attempt remedilesse.</p><p>
 
 But why haue ye (said <i>Artegall</i>) forborne<br>
 Your owne good shield in daungerous dismay?<br>
 That is the greatest shame and foulest scorne,<br>
 Which vnto any knight behappen may<br>
 To loose the badge, that should his deedes display.<br>
 To whom Sir <i>Burbon</i>, blushing halfe for shame,<br>
 That shall I vnto you (quoth he) bewray;<br>
 Least ye therefore mote happily me blame,<br>
 And deeme it doen of will, that through inforcement came.</p><p>
 
 True is, that I at first was dubbed knight<br>
 By a good knight, the knight of the <i>Redcrosse</i>;<br>
 Who when he gaue me armes, in field to fight,<br>
 Gaue me a shield, in which he did endosse<br>
 His deare Redeemers badge vpon the bosse:<br>
 The same longwhile I bore, and therewithall<br>
 Fought many battels without wound or losse;<br>
 Therewith <i>Grandtorto</i> selfe I did appall,<br>
 And made him oftentimes in field before me fall.</p><p>
 
 But for that many did that shield enuie,<br>
 And cruell enemies increased more;<br>
 To stint all strife and troublous enmitie,<br>
 That bloudie scutchin being battered sore,<br>
 I layd aside, and haue of late forbore,<br>
 Hoping thereby to haue my loue obtayned:<br>
 Yet can I not my loue haue nathemore;<br>
 For she by force is still fro me detayned,<br>
 And with corruptfull brybes is to vntruth mis-trayned.</p><p>
 
 To whom thus <i>Artegall</i>; Certes Sir knight,<br>
 Hard is the case, the which ye doe complaine;<br>
 Yet not so hard (for nought so hard may light,<br>
 That it to such a streight mote you constraine)<br>
 As to abandon, that which doth containe<br>
 Your honours stile, that is your warlike shield.<br>
 All perill ought be lesse, and lesse all paine<br>
 Then losse of fame in disauentrous field;<br>
 Dye rather, then doe ought, that mote dishonour yield.</p><p>
 
 Not so; (quoth he) for yet when time doth serue,<br>
 My former shield I may resume againe:<br>
 To temporize is not from truth to swerue,<br>
 Ne for aduantage terme to entertaine,<br>
 When as necessitie doth it constraine.<br>
 Fie on such forgerie (said <i>Artegall</i>)<br>
 Vnder one hood to shadow faces twaine.<br>
 Knights ought be true, and truth is one in all:<br>
 Of all things to dissemble fouly may befall.</p><p>
 
 Yet let me you of courtesie request,<br>
 (Said <i>Burbon</i>) to assist me now at need<br>
 Against these pesants, which haue me opprest,<br>
 And forced me to so infamous deed,<br>
 That yet my loue may from their hands be freed.<br>
 Sir <i>Artegall</i>, albe he earst did wyte<br>
 His wauering mind, yet to his aide agreed,<br>
 And buckling him eftsoones vnto the fight,<br>
 Did set vpon those troupes with all his powre and might.</p><p>
 
 Who flocking round about them, as a swarme<br>
 Of flyes vpon a birchen bough doth cluster,<br>
 Did them assault with terrible allarme,<br>
 And ouer all the fields themselues did muster,<br>
 With bils and glayues making a dreadfull luster;<br>
 That forst at first those knights backe to retyre:<br>
 As when the wrathfull <i>Boreas</i> doth bluster,<br>
 Nought may abide the tempest of his yre,<br>
 Both man and beast doe fly, and succour doe inquyre.</p><p>
 
 But when as ouerblowen was that brunt,<br>
 Those knights began a fresh them to assayle,<br>
 And all about the fields like Squirrels hunt;<br>
 But chiefly <i>Talus</i> with his yron flayle,<br>
 Gainst which no flight nor rescue mote auayle,<br>
 Made cruell hauocke of the baser crew,<br>
 And chaced them both ouer hill and dale:<br>
 The raskall manie soone they ouerthrew,<br>
 But the two knights themselues their captains did subdew.</p><p>
 
 At last they came whereas that Ladie bode,<br>
 Whom now her keepers had forsaken quight,<br>
 To saue themselues, and scattered were abrode:<br>
 Her halfe dismayd they found in doubtfull plight,<br>
 As neither glad nor sorie for their sight;<br>
 Yet wondrous faire she was, and richly clad<br>
 In roiall robes, and many Iewels dight,<br>
 But that those villens through their vsage bad<br>
 Them fouly rent, and shamefully defaced had.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Burbon</i> streight dismounting from his steed,<br>
 Vnto her ran with greedie great desyre,<br>
 And catching her fast by her ragged weed,<br>
 Would haue embraced her with hart entyre.<br>
 But she backstarting with disdainefull yre,<br>
 Bad him auaunt, ne would vnto his lore<br>
 Allured be, for prayer nor for meed.<br>
 Whom when those knights so froward and forlore<br>
 Beheld, they her rebuked and vpbrayded sore.</p><p>
 
 Sayd <i>Artegall</i>; What foule disgrace is this,<br>
 To so faire Ladie, as ye seeme in sight,<br>
 To blot your beautie, that vnblemisht is,<br>
 With so foule blame, as breach of faith once plight,<br>
 Or change of loue for any worlds delight?<br>
 Is ought on earth so pretious or deare,<br>
 As prayse and honour?  Or is ought so bright<br>
 And beautifull, as glories beames appeare,<br>
 Whose goodly light then <i>Phebus</i> lampe doth shine more cleare?</p><p>
 
 Why then will ye, fond Dame, attempted bee<br>
 Vnto a strangers loue so lightly placed,<br>
 For guiftes of gold, or any worldly glee,<br>
 To leaue the loue, that ye before embraced,<br>
 And let your fame with falshood be defaced?<br>
 Fie on the pelfe, for which good name is sold,<br>
 And honour with indignitie debased:<br>
 Dearer is loue then life, and fame then gold;<br>
 But dearer then thẽ both, your faith once plighted hold.</p><p>
 
 Much was the Ladie in her gentle mind<br>
 Abasht at his rebuke, that bit her neare,<br>
 Ne ought to answere thereunto did find;<br>
 But hanging downe her head with heauie cheare,<br>
 Stood long amaz'd, as she amated weare.<br>
 Which <i>Burbon</i> seeing, her againe assayd,<br>
 And clasping twixt his armes, her vp did reare<br>
 Vpon his steede, whiles she no whit gainesayd,<br>
 So bore her quite away, nor well nor ill apayd.</p><p>
 
 Nathlesse the yron man did still pursew<br>
 That raskall many with vnpittied spoyle;<br>
 Ne ceassed not, till all their scattred crew<br>
 Into the sea he droue quite from that soyle,<br>
 The which they troubled had with great turmoyle.<br>
 But <i>Artegall</i> seeing his cruell deed,<br>
 Commaunded him from slaughter to recoyle,<br>
 And to his voyage gan againe proceed:<br>
 For that the terme approching fast, required speed.</p><p>
