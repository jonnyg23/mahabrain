 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Amoret rapt by greedie lust<br>
 Belphebe saues from dread:<br>
 The Squire her loues, and being blam'd<br>
 his dayes in dole doth lead.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 G
 Reat God of loue, that with thy cruell darts,<br>
 Doest conquer greatest conquerors on ground,<br>
 And setst thy kingdome in the captiue harts<br>
 Of Kings and Keasars, to thy seruice bound,<br>
 What glorie, or what guerdon hast thou found<br>
 In feeble Ladies tyranning so sore;<br>
 And adding anguish to the bitter wound,<br>
 With which their liues thou lanchedst long afore,<br>
 By heaping stormes of trouble on them daily more?<p>
 
 So whylome didst thou to faire <i>Florimell</i>;<br>
 And so and so to noble <i>Britomart</i>:<br>
 So doest thou now to her, of whom I tell,<br>
 The louely <i>Amoret</i>, whose gentle hart<br>
 Thou martyrest with sorow and with smart,<br>
 In saluage forrests, and in deserts wide,<br>
 With Beares and Tygers taking heauie part,<br>
 Withouten comfort, and withouten guide,<br>
 That pittie is to heare the perils, which she tride.</p><p>
 
 So soone as she with that braue Britonesse<br>
 Had left that Turneyment for beauties prise,<br>
 They trauel'd long, that now for wearinesse,<br>
 Both of the way, and warlike exercise,<br>
 Both through a forest ryding did deuise<br>
 T'alight, and rest their wearie limbs awhile.<br>
 There heauie sleepe the eye-lids did surprise<br>
 Of <i>Britomart</i> after long tedious toyle,<br>
 That did her passed paines in quiet rest assoyle.</p><p>
 
 The whiles faire <i>Amoret</i>, of nought affeard,<br>
 Walkt through the wood, for pleasure, or for need;<br>
 When suddenly behind her backe she heard<br>
 One rushing forth out of the thickest weed,<br>
 That ere she backe could turne to taken heed,<br>
 Had vnawares her snatched vp from ground.<br>
 Feebly she shriekt, but so feebly indeed,<br>
 That <i>Britomart</i> heard not the shrilling sound,<br>
 There where through weary trauel she lay sleeping sou˜d.</p><p>
 
 It was to weet a wilde and saluage man,<br>
 Yet was no man, but onely like in shape,<br>
 And eke in stature higher by a span,<br>
 All ouergrowne with haire, that could awhape<br>
 An hardy hart, and his wide mouth did gape<br>
 With huge great teeth, like to a tusked Bore:<br>
 For he liu'd all on rauin and on rape<br>
 Of men and beasts; and fed on fleshly gore,<br>
 The signe whereof yet stain'd his bloudy lips afore.</p><p>
 
 His neather lip was not like man nor beast,<br>
 But like a wide deepe poke, downe hanging low,<br>
 In which he wont the relickes of his feast,<br>
 And cruell spoyle, which he had spard, to stow:<br>
 And ouer it his huge great nose did grow,<br>
 Full dreadfully empurpled all with bloud;<br>
 And downe both sides two wide long eares did glow,<br>
 And raught downe to his waste, when vp he stood,<br>
 More great then th'eares of Elephants by <i>Indus</i> flood.</p><p>
 
 His wast was with a wreath of yuie greene<br>
 Engirt about, ne other garment wore:<br>
 For all his haire was like a garment seene;<br>
 And in his hand a tall young oake he bore,<br>
 Whose knottie snags were sharpned all afore,<br>
 And beath'd in fire for steele to be in sted.<br>
 But whence he was, or of what wombe ybore,<br>
 Of beasts, or of the earth, I haue not red:<br>
 But certes was with milke of Wolues and Tygres fed.</p><p>
 
 This vgly creature in his armes her snatcht,<br>
 And through the forrest bore her quite away,<br>
 With briers and bushes all to rent and scratcht;<br>
 Ne care he had, ne pittie of the pray,<br>
 Which many a knight had sought so many a day.<br>
 He stayed not, but in his armes her bearing<br>
 Ran, till he came to th'end of all his way,<br>
 Vnto his caue farre from all peoples hearing,<br>
 And there he threw her in, nought feeling, ne nought fearing.</p><p>
 
 For she deare Ladie all the way was dead,<br>
 Whilest he in armes her bore; but when she felt<br>
 Her selfe downe soust, she waked out of dread<br>
 Streight into griefe, that her deare hart nigh swelt,<br>
 And eft gan into tender teares to melt.<br>
 Then when she lookt about, and nothing found<br>
 But darknesse and dread horrour, where she dwelt,<br>
 She almost fell againe into a swound,<br>
 Ne wist whether aboue she were, or vnder ground.</p><p>
 
 With that she heard some one close by her side<br>
 Sighing and sobbing sore, as if the paine<br>
 Her tender hart in peeces would diuide:<br>
 Which she long listning, softly askt againe<br>
 What mister wight it was that so did plaine?<br>
 To whom thus aunswer'd was: Ah wretched wight<br>
 That seekes to know anothers griefe in vaine,<br>
 Vnweeting of thine owne like haplesse plight:<br>
 Selfe to forget to mind another, is ouersight.</p><p>
 
 Aye me (said she) where am I, or with whom?<br>
 Emong the liuing, or emong the dead?<br>
 What shall of me vnhappy maid become?<br>
 Shall death be th'end, or ought else worse, aread.<br>
 Vnhappy mayd (then answerd she) whose dread<br>
 Vntride, is lesse then when thou shalt it try:<br>
 Death is to him, that wretched life doth lead,<br>
 Both grace and gaine; but he in hell doth lie,<br>
 That liues a loathed life, and wishing cannot die.</p><p>
 
 This dismall day hath thee a caytiue made,<br>
 And vassall to the vilest wretch aliue,<br>
 Whose cursed vsage and vngodly trade<br>
 The heauens abhorre, and into darkenesse driue.<br>
 For on the spoile of women he doth liue,<br>
 Whose bodies chast, when euer in his powre<br>
 He may them catch, vnable to gainestriue,<br>
 He with his shamefull lust doth first deflowre,<br>
 And afterwards themselues doth cruelly deuoure.</p><p>
 
 Now twenty daies, by which the sonnes of men<br>
 Diuide their works, haue past through heuen sheene,<br>
 Since I was brought into this dolefull den;<br>
 During which space these sory eies haue seen<br>
 Seauen women by him slaine, and eaten clene.<br>
 And now no more for him but I alone,<br>
 And this old woman here remaining beene;<br>
 Till thou cam'st hither to augment our mone,<br>
 And of vs three to morrow he will sure eate one.</p><p>
 
 Ah dreadfull tidings which thou doest declare,<br>
 (Quoth she) of all that euer hath bene knowen:<br>
 Full many great calamities and rare<br>
 This feeble brest endured hath, but none<br>
 Equall to this, where euer I haue gone.<br>
 But what are you, whom like vnlucky lot<br>
 Hath linckt with me in the same chaine attone?<br>
 To tell (quoth she) that which ye see, needs not;<br>
 A wofull wretched maid, of God and man forgot.</p><p>
 
 But what I was, it irkes me to reherse<br>
 Daughter vnto a Lord of high degree;<br>
 That ioyd in happy peace, till fates peruerse<br>
 With guilefull loue did secretly agree,<br>
 To ouerthrow my state and dignitie.<br>
 It was my lot to loue a gentle swaine,<br>
 Yet was he but a Squire of low degree;<br>
 Yet was he meet, vnlesse mine eye did faine,<br>
 By any Ladies side for Leman to haue laine.</p><p>
 
 But for his meannesse and disparagement,<br>
 My Sire, who me too dearely well did loue,<br>
 Vnto my choise by no meanes would assent,<br>
 But often did my folly fowle reproue.<br>
 Yet nothing could my fixed mind remoue,<br>
 But whether willed or nilled friend or foe,<br>
 I me resolu'd the vtmost end to proue,<br>
 And rather then my loue abandon so,<br>
 Both sire, and friends, and all for euer to forego.</p><p>
 
 Thenceforth I sought by secret meanes to worke<br>
 Time to my will, and from his wrathfull sight<br>
 To hide th'intent, which in my heart did lurke,<br>
 Till I thereto had all things ready dight.<br>
 So on a day vnweeting vnto wight,<br>
 I with that Squire agreede away to flit,<br>
 And in a priuy place, betwixt vs hight,<br>
 Within a groue appointed him to meete;<br>
 To which I boldly came vpon my feeble feete.</p><p>
 
 But ah vnhappy houre me thither brought:<br>
 For in that place where I him thought to find,<br>
 There was I found, contrary to my thought,<br>
 Of this accursed Carle of hellish kind;<br>
 The shame of men, and plague of womankind,<br>
 Who trussing me, as Eagle doth his pray,<br>
 Me hether brought with him, as swift as wind,<br>
 Where yet vntouched till this present day,<br>
 I rest his wretched thrall, the sad <i>AEmylia</i>.</p><p>
 
 Ah sad <i>AEmylia</i> (then sayd <i>Amoret</i>,)<br>
 Thy ruefull plight I pitty as mine owne.<br>
 But read to me, by what deuise or wit,<br>
 Hast thou in all this time, from him vnknowne<br>
 Thine honor sau'd, though into thraldome throwne?<br>
 Through helpe (quoth she) of this old woman here<br>
 I haue so done, as she to me hath showne.<br>
 For euer when he burnt in lustfull fire,<br>
 She in my stead supplide his bestiall desire.</p><p>
 
 Thus of their euils as they did discourse,<br>
 And each did other much bewaile and mone;<br>
 Loe where the villaine selfe, their sorrowes sourse,<br>
 Came to the caue, and rolling thence the stone,<br>
 Which wont to stop the mouth thereof, that none<br>
 Might issue forth, came rudely rushing in,<br>
 And spredding ouer all the flore alone,<br>
 Gan dight him selfe vnto his wonted sinne;<br>
 Which ended, then his bloudy banket should beginne.</p><p>
 
 Which when as fearefull <i>Amoret</i> perceiued,<br>
 She staid not the vtmost end thereof to try,<br>
 But like a ghastly Gelt, whose wits are reaued,<br>
 Ran forth in hast with hideous outcry,<br>
 For horrour of his shamefull villany.<br>
 But after her full lightly he vprose,<br>
 And her pursu'd as fast as she did flie:<br>
 Full fast she flies, and farre afore him goes,<br>
 Ne feeles the thorns and thickets pricke her tender toes.</p><p>
 
 Nor hedge, nor ditch, nor hill, nor dale she staies,<br>
 But ouerleapes them all, like Robucke light,<br>
 And through the thickest makes her nighest waies;<br>
 And euermore when with regardfull sight<br>
 She looking backe, espies that griesly wight<br>
 Approching nigh, she gins to mend her pace,<br>
 And makes her feare a spur to hast her flight:<br>
 More swift then <i>Myrrh'</i> or <i>Daphne</i> in her race,<br>
 Or any of the Thracian Nimphes in saluage chase.</p><p>
 
 Long so she fled, and so he follow'd long;<br>
 Ne liuing aide for her on earth appeares,<br>
 But if the heauens helpe to redresse her wrong,<br>
 Moued with pity of her plenteous teares.<br>
 It fortuned <i>Belphebe</i> with her peares<br>
 The woody Nimphs, and with that louely boy,<br>
 Was hunting then the Libbards and the Beares,<br>
 In these wild woods, as was her wonted ioy,<br>
 To banish sloth, that oft doth noble mindes annoy.</p><p>
 
 It so befell, as oft it fals in chace,<br>
 That each of them from other sundred were,<br>
 And that same gentle Squire arriu'd in place,<br>
 Where this same cursed caytiue did appeare,<br>
 Pursuing that faire Lady full of feare;<br>
 And now he her quite ouertaken had;<br>
 And now he her away with him did beare<br>
 Vnder his arme, as seeming wondrous glad,<br>
 That by his grenning laughter mote farre off be rad.</p><p>
 
 Which drery sight the gentle Squire espying,<br>
 Doth hast to crosse him by the nearest way,<br>
 Led with that wofull Ladies piteous crying,<br>
 And him assailes with all the might he may:<br>
 Yet will not he the louely spoile downe lay,<br>
 But with his craggy club in his right hand,<br>
 Defends him selfe, and saues his gotten pray.<br>
 Yet had it bene right hard him to withstand,<br>
 But that he was full light and nimble on the land.</p><p>
 
 Thereto the villaine vsed craft in fight;<br>
 For euer when the Squire his iauelin shooke,<br>
 He held the Lady forth before him right,<br>
 And with her body, as a buckler, broke<br>
 The puissance of his intended stroke.<br>
 And if it chaunst, (as needs it must in fight)<br>
 Whilest he on him was greedy to be wroke,<br>
 That any little blow on her did light,<br>
 Then would he laugh aloud, and gather great delight.</p><p>
 
 Which subtill sleight did him encumber much,<br>
 And made him oft, when he would strike, forbeare;<br>
 For hardly could he come the carle to touch,<br>
 But that he her must hurt, or hazard neare:<br>
 Yet he his hand so carefully did beare,<br>
 That at the last he did himselfe attaine,<br>
 And therein left the pike head of his speare.<br>
 A streame of coleblacke bloud thence gusht amaine,<br>
 That all her silken garments did with bloud bestaine.</p><p>
 
 With that he threw her rudely on the flore,<br>
 And laying both his hands vpon his glaue,<br>
 With dreadfull strokes let driue at him so sore,<br>
 That forst him flie abacke, himselfe to saue:<br>
 Yet he therewith so felly still did raue,<br>
 That scarse the Squire his hand could once vpreare,<br>
 But for aduantage ground vnto him gaue,<br>
 Tracing and trauersing, now here, now there;<br>
 For bootlesse thing it was to think such blowes to beare.</p><p>
 
 Whilest thus in battell they embusied were,<br>
 <i>Belphebe</i> raunging in that forrest wide,<br>
 The hideous noise of their huge strokes did heare,<br>
 And drew thereto, making her eare her guide.<br>
 Whom when that theefe approching nigh espide,<br>
 With bow in hand, and arrowes ready bent,<br>
 He by his former combate would not bide,<br>
 But fled away with ghastly dreriment,<br>
 Well knowing her to be his deaths sole instrument.</p><p>
 
 Whom seeing flie, she speedily poursewed<br>
 With winged feete, as nimble as the winde;<br>
 And euer in her bow she ready shewed<br>
 The arrow, to his deadly marke desynde,<br>
 As when <i>Latonaes</i> daughter cruell kynde,<br>
 In vengement of her mothers great disgrace,<br>
 With fell despight her cruell arrowes tynde<br>
 Gainst wofull <i>Niobes</i> vnhappy race,<br>
 That all the gods did mone her miserable case.</p><p>
 
 So well she sped her and so far she ventred,<br>
 That ere vnto his hellish den he raught,<br>
 Euen as he ready was there to haue entred,<br>
 She sent an arrow forth with mighty draught,<br>
 That in the very dore him ouercaught,<br>
 And in his nape arriuing, through it thrild<br>
 His greedy throte, therewith in two distraught,<br>
 That all his vitall spirites thereby spild,<br>
 And all his hairy brest with gory bloud was fild.</p><p>
 
 Whom when on ground she groueling saw to rowle,<br>
 She ran in hast his life to haue bereft:<br>
 But ere she could him reach, the sinfull sowle<br>
 Hauing his carrion corse quite sencelesse left,<br>
 Was fled to hell, surcharg'd with spoile and theft.<br>
 Yet ouer him she there long gazing stood,<br>
 And oft admir'd his monstrous shape, and oft<br>
 His mighty limbs, whilest all with filthy bloud<br>
 The place there ouerflowne, seemd like a sodaine flood.</p><p>
 
 Thence forth she past into his dreadfull den,<br>
 Where nought but darkesome drerinesse she found,<br>
 Ne creature saw, but hearkned now and then<br>
 Some litle whispering, and soft groning sound.<br>
 With that she askt, what ghosts there vnder ground<br>
 Lay hid in horrour of eternall night?<br>
 And bad them, if so be they were not bound,<br>
 To come and shew themselues before the light,<br>
 Now freed from feare and danger of that dismall wight.</p><p>
 
 Then forth the sad <i>AEmylia</i> issewed,<br>
 Yet trembling euery ioynt through former feare;<br>
 And after her the Hag, there with her mewed,<br>
 A foule and lothsome creature did appeare;<br>
 A leman fit for such a louer deare.<br>
 That mou'd <i>Belphebe</i> her no lesse to hate,<br>
 Then for to rue the others heauy cheare;<br>
 Of whom she gan enquire of her estate.<br>
 Who all to her at large, as hapned, did relate.</p><p>
 
 Thence she them brought toward the place, where late<br>
 She left the gentle Squire with <i>Amoret:</i><br>
 There she him found by that new louely mate,<br>
 Who lay the whiles in swoune, full sadly set,<br>
 From her faire eyes wiping the deawy wet,<br>
 Which softly stild, and kissing them atweene,<br>
 And handling soft the hurts, which she did get.<br>
 For of that Carle she sorely bruz'd had beene,<br>
 Als of his owne rash hand one wound was to be seene.</p><p>
 
 Which when she saw, with sodaine glauncing eye,<br>
 Her noble heart with sight thereof was fild<br>
 With deepe disdaine, and great indignity,<br>
 That in her wrath she thought them both haue thrild,<br>
 With that selfe arrow, which the Carle had kild:<br>
 Yet held her wrathfull hand from vengeance sore,<br>
 But drawing nigh, ere he her well beheld;<br>
 Is this the faith, she said, and said no more,<br>
 But turnd her face, and fled away for euermore.</p><p>
 
 He seeing her depart, arose vp light,<br>
 Right sore agrieued at her sharpe reproofe,<br>
 And follow'd fast: but when he came in sight,<br>
 He durst not nigh approch, but kept aloofe,<br>
 For dread of her displeasures vtmost proofe.<br>
 And euermore, when he did grace entreat,<br>
 And framed speaches fit for his behoofe,<br>
 Her mortall arrowes she at him did threat,<br>
 And forst him backe with fowle dishonor to retreat.</p><p>
 
 At last when long he follow'd had in vaine,<br>
 Yet found no ease of griefe, nor hope of grace,<br>
 Vnto those woods he turned backe againe,<br>
 Full of sad anguish, and in heauy case:<br>
 And finding there fit solitary place<br>
 For wofull wight, chose out a gloomy glade,<br>
 Where hardly eye mote see bright heauens face,<br>
 For mossy trees, which couered all with shade<br>
 And sad melancholy: there he his cabin made.</p><p>
 
 His wonted warlike weapons all he broke,<br>
 And threw away, with vow to vse no more,<br>
 Ne thenceforth euer strike in battell stroke,<br>
 Ne euer word to speake to woman more;<br>
 But in that wildernesse, of men forlore,<br>
 And of the wicked world forgotten quight,<br>
 His hard mishap in dolor to deplore,<br>
 And wast his wretched daies in wofull plight;<br>
 So on him selfe to wreake his follies owne despight.</p><p>
 
 And eke his garment, to be thereto meet,<br>
 He wilfully did cut and shape anew;<br>
 And his faire lockes, that wont with ointment sweet<br>
 To be embaulm'd, and sweat out dainty dew,<br>
 He let to grow and griesly to concrew,<br>
 Vncomb'd, vncurl'd, and carelesly vnshed;<br>
 That in short time his face they ouergrew,<br>
 And ouer all his shoulders did dispred,<br>
 That who he whilome was, vneath was to be red.</p><p>
 
 There he continued in this carefull plight,<br>
 Wretchedly wearing out his youthly yeares,<br>
 Through wilfull penury consumed quight,<br>
 That like a pined ghost he soone appeares.<br>
 For other food then that wilde forrest beares,<br>
 Ne other drinke there did he euer tast,<br>
 Then running water, tempred with his teares,<br>
 The more his weakened body so to wast:<br>
 That out of all mens knowledge he was worne at last.</p><p>
 
 For on a day, by fortune as it fell,<br>
 His owne deare Lord Prince <i>Arthure</i> came that way,<br>
 Seeking aduentures, where he mote heare tell;<br>
 And as he through the wandring wood did stray,<br>
 Hauing espide this Cabin far away,<br>
 He to it drew, to weet who there did wonne;<br>
 Weening therein some holy Hermit lay,<br>
 That did resort of sinfull people shonne;<br>
 Or else some woodman shrowded there from scorching sunne.</p><p>
 
 Arriuing there, he found this wretched man,<br>
 Spending his daies in dolour and despaire,<br>
 And through long fasting woxen pale and wan,<br>
 All ouergrowen with rude and rugged haire;<br>
 That albeit his owne deare Squire he were,<br>
 Yet he him knew not, ne auiz'd at all,<br>
 But like strange wight, whom he had seene no where,<br>
 Saluting him, gan into speach to fall,<br>
 And pitty much his plight, that liu'd like outcast thrall.</p><p>
 
 But to his speach he aunswered no whit,<br>
 But stood still mute, as if he had beene dum,<br>
 Ne signe of sence did shew, ne common wit,<br>
 As one with griefe and anguishe ouercum,<br>
 And vnto euery thing did aunswere mum:<br>
 And euer when the Prince vnto him spake,<br>
 He louted lowly, as did him becum,<br>
 And humble homage did vnto him make,<br>
 Midst sorrow shewing ioyous semblance for his sake.</p><p>
 
 At which his vncouth guise and vsage quaint<br>
 The Prince did wonder much, yet could not ghesse<br>
 The cause of that his sorrowfull constraint;<br>
 Yet weend by secret signes of manlinesse,<br>
 Which close appeard in that rude brutishnesse,<br>
 That he whilome some gentle swaine had beene,<br>
 Traind vp in feats of armes and knightlinesse;<br>
 Which he obseru'd, by that he him had seene<br>
 To weld his naked sword, and try the edges keene.</p><p>
 
 And eke by that he saw on euery tree,<br>
 How he the name of one engrauen had,<br>
 Which likly was his liefest loue to be,<br>
 For whom he now so sorely was bestad;<br>
 Which was by him <i>BELPHEBE</i> rightly rad.<br>
 Yet who was that <i>Belphebe</i>, he ne wist;<br>
 Yet saw he often how he wexed glad,<br>
 When he it heard, and how the ground he kist,<br>
 Wherein it written was, and how himselfe he blist:</p><p>
 
 Tho when he long had marked his demeanor,<br>
 And saw that all he said and did, was vaine,<br>
 Ne ought mote make him change his wonted tenor,<br>
 Ne ought mote ease or mitigate his paine,<br>
 He left him there in languor to remaine,<br>
 Till time for him should remedy prouide,<br>
 And him restore to former grace againe.<br>
 Which for it is too long here to abide,<br>
 I will deferre the end vntill another tide.</p><p>
