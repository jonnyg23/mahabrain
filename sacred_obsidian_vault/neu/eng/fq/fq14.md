 </p><blockquote> 
 <i>Guyon by Archimage abusd,<br>
 The Redcrosse knight awaytes,<br>
 Findes Mordant and Amauia slaine<br>
 With pleasures poisoned baytes.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote> 
 
  
 <p>
 </p><blockquote> 
 T
 Hat cunning Architect of cancred guile,<br>
 Whom Princes late displeasure left in bands,<br>
 For falsed letters and suborned wile,<br>
 Soone as the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight he vnderstands,<br>
 To beene departed out of <i>Eden</i> lands,<br>
 To serue againe his soueraine Elfin Queene,<br>
 His artes he moues, and out of caytiues hands<br>
 Himselfe he frees by secret meanes vnseene;<br>
 His shackles emptie left, him selfe escaped cleene.<p>
  
 And forth he fares full of malicious mind,<br>
 To worken mischiefe and auenging woe,<br>
 Where euer he that godly knight may find,<br>
 His onely hart sore, and his onely foe,<br>
 Sith <i>Vna</i> now he algates must forgoe,<br>
 Whom his victorious hands did earst restore<br>
 To natiue crowne and kingdome late ygoe:<br>
 Where she enioyes sure peace for euermore,<br>
 As weather-beaten ship arriu'd on happie shore.</p><p>
  
 Him therefore now the obiect of his spight<br>
 And deadly food he makes: him to offend<br>
 By forged treason, or by open fight<br>
 He seekes, of all his drift the aymed end:<br>
 Thereto his subtile engins he does bend<br>
 His practick wit, and his faire filed tong,<br>
 With thousand other sleights: for well he kend,<br>
 His credit now in doubtfull ballaunce hong;<br>
 For hardly could be hurt, who was already stong.</p><p>
  
 Still as he went, he craftie stales did lay<br>
 With cunning traines him to entrap vnwares.<br>
 And priuie spials plast in all his way,<br>
 To weete what course he takes, and how he fares;<br>
 To ketch him at a vantage in his snares.<br>
 But now so wise and warie was the knight<br>
 By triall of his former harmes and cares,<br>
 That he descride, and shonned still his slight:<br>
 The fish that once was caught, new bait will hardly bite.</p><p>
  
 Nath'lesse th'Enchaunter would not spare his paine,<br>
 In hope to win occasion to his will;<br>
 Which when he long awaited had in vaine,<br>
 He chaungd his minde from one to other ill:<br>
 For to all good he enimy was still.<br>
 Vpon the way him fortuned to meet,<br>
 Faire marching vnderneath a shady hill,<br>
 A goodly knight, all armd in harnesse meete,<br>
 That from his head no place appeared to his feete.</p><p>
  
 His carriage was full comely and vpright,<br>
 His countenaunce demure and temperate,<br>
 But yet so sterne and terrible in sight,<br>
 That cheard his friends, and did his foes amate:<br>
 He was an Elfin borne of noble state,<br>
 And mickle worship in his natiue land;<br>
 Well could he tourney and in lists debate,<br>
 And knighthood tooke of good Sir <i>Huons</i> hand,<br>
 When with king <i>Oberon</i> he came to Faerie land.</p><p>
  
 Him als accompanyd vpon the way<br>
 A comely Palmer, clad in blacke attire,<br>
 Of ripest yeares, and haires all hoarie gray,<br>
 That with a staffe his feeble steps did stire,<br>
 Least his long way his aged limbes should tire:<br>
 And if by lookes one may the mind aread,<br>
 He seemd to be a sage and sober sire,<br>
 And euer with slow pace the knight did lead,<br>
 Who taught his trampling steed with equall steps to tread.</p><p>
  
 Such whenas <i>Archimago</i> them did view,<br>
 He weened well to worke some vncouth wile,<br>
 Eftsoones vntwisting his deceiptfull clew,<br>
 He gan to weaue a web of wicked guile,<br>
 And with faire countenance and flattring stile,<br>
 To them approching, thus the knight bespake:<br>
 Faire sonne of <i>Mars</i>, that seeke with warlike spoile.<br>
 And great atchieu'ments great your selfe to make,<br>
 Vouchsafe to stay your steed for humble misers sake.</p><p>
  
 He stayd his steed for humble misers sake,<br>
 And bad tell on the tenor of his plaint;<br>
 Who feigning then in euery limbe to quake,<br>
 Through inward feare, and seeming pale and faint<br>
 With piteous mone his percing speach gan paint;<br>
 Deare Lady how shall I declare thy cace,<br>
 Whom late I left in langourous constraint?<br>
 Would God thy selfe now present were in place,<br>
 To tell this ruefull tale; thy sight could win thee grace.</p><p>
  
 Or rather would, O would it so had chaunst,<br>
 That you, most noble Sir, had present beene,<br>
 When that lewd ribauld with vile lust aduaunst<br>
 Layd first his filthy hands on virgin cleene,<br>
 To spoile her daintie corse so faire and sheene,<br>
 As on the earth, great mother of vs all,<br>
 With liuing eye more faire was neuer seene,<br>
 Of chastitie and honour virginall:<br>
 Witnesse ye heauẽs, whom she in vaine to helpe did call.</p><p>
  
 How may it be, (said then the knight halfe wroth,)<br>
 That knight should knighthood euer so haue shent?<br>
 None but that saw (quoth he) would weene for troth,<br>
 How shamefully that Maid he did torment.<br>
 Her looser golden lockes he rudely rent,<br>
 And drew her on the ground, and his sharpe sword,<br>
 Against her snowy brest he fiercely bent,<br>
 And threatned death with many a bloudie word;<br>
 Toung hates to tell the rest, that eye to see abhord.</p><p>
  
 Therewith amoued from his sober mood,<br>
 And liues he yet (said he) that wrought this act,<br>
 And doen the heauens afford him vitall food?<br>
 He liues, (quoth he) and boasteth of the fact,<br>
 Ne yet hath any knight his courage crackt.<br>
 Where may that treachour then (said he) be found,<br>
 Or by what meanes may I his footing tract?<br>
 That shall I shew (said he) as sure, as hound<br>
 The strickẽ Deare doth chalenge by the bleeding wound.</p><p>
  
 He staid not lenger talke, but with fierce ire<br>
 And zealous hast away is quickly gone<br>
 To seeke that knight, where him that craftie Squire<br>
 Supposd to be. They do arriue anone,<br>
 Where sate a gentle Lady all alone,<br>
 With garments rent, and haire discheueled,<br>
 Wringing her hands, and making piteous mone;<br>
 Her swollen eyes were much disfigured,<br>
 And her faire face with teares was fowly blubbered.</p><p>
  
 The knight approching nigh thus to her said,<br>
 Faire Ladie, through foule sorrow ill bedight,<br>
 Great pittie is to see you thus dismaid,<br>
 And marre the blossome of your beautie bright:<br>
 For thy appease your griefe and heauie plight,<br>
 And tell the cause of your conceiued paine.<br>
 For if he liue, that hath you doen despight,<br>
 He shall you doe due recompence againe,<br>
 Or else his wrong with greater puissance maintaine.</p><p>
  
 Which when she heard, as in despightfull wise,<br>
 She wilfully her sorrow did augment,<br>
 And offred hope of comfort did despise:<br>
 Her golden lockes most cruelly she rent,<br>
 And scratcht her face with ghastly dreriment,<br>
 Ne would she speake, ne see, ne yet be seene,<br>
 But hid her visage, and her head downe bent,<br>
 Either for grieuous shame, or for great teene,<br>
 As if her hart with sorrow had transfixed beene.</p><p>
  
 Till her that Squire bespake, Madame my liefe,<br>
 For Gods deare loue be not so wilfull bent,<br>
 But doe vouchsafe now to receiue reliefe,<br>
 The which good fortune doth to you present.<br>
 For what bootes it to weepe and to wayment,<br>
 When ill is chaunst, but doth the ill increase,<br>
 And the weake mind with double woe torment?<br>
 When she her Squire heard speake, she gan appease<br>
 Her voluntarie paine, and feele some secret ease.</p><p>
  
 Eftsoone she said, Ah gentle trustie Squire,<br>
 What comfort can I wofull wretch conceaue,<br>
 Or why should euer I henceforth desire,<br>
 To see faire heauens face, and life not leaue,<br>
 Sith that false Traytour did my honour reaue?<br>
 False traytour certes (said the Faerie knight)<br>
 I read the man, that euer would deceaue<br>
 A gentle Ladie, or her wrong through might:<br>
 Death were too little paine for such a foule despight.</p><p>
  
 But now, faire Ladie, comfort to you make,<br>
 And read, who hath ye wrought this shamefull plight.<br>
 That short reuenge the man may ouertake,<br>
 Where so he be, and soone vpon him light.<br>
 Certes (saide she) I wote not how he hight,<br>
 But vnder him a gray steede did he wield,<br>
 Whose sides with dapled circles weren dight;<br>
 Vpright he rode, and in his siluer shield<br>
 He bore a bloudie Crosse, that quartred all the field.</p><p>
  
 Now by my head (said <i>Guyon</i>) much I muse,<br>
 How that same knight should do so foule amis,<br>
 Or euer gentle Damzell so abuse:<br>
 For may I boldly say, he surely is<br>
 A right good knight, and true of word ywis:<br>
 I present was, and can it witnesse well,<br>
 When armes he swore, and streight did enterpris<br>
 Th'aduenture of the <i>Errant damozell</i>,<br>
 In which he hath great glorie wonne, as I heare tell.</p><p>
  
 Nathlesse he shortly shall againe be tryde,<br>
 And fairly quite him of th'imputed blame,<br>
 Else be ye sure he dearely shall abyde,<br>
 Or make you good amendment for the same:<br>
 All wrongs haue mends, but no amends of shame.<br>
 Now therefore Ladie, rise out of your paine,<br>
 And see the saluing of your blotted name.<br>
 Full loth she seemd thereto, but yet did faine;<br>
 For she was inly glad her purpose so to gaine.</p><p>
  
 Her purpose was not such, as she did faine,<br>
 Ne yet her person such, as it was seene,<br>
 But vnder simple shew and semblant plaine<br>
 Lurckt false <i>Duessa</i> secretly vnseene,<br>
 As a chast Virgin, that wronged beene:<br>
 So had false <i>Archimago</i> her disguisd,<br>
 To cloke her guile with sorrow and sad teene;<br>
 And eke himselfe had craftily deuisd<br>
 To be her Squire, and do her seruice well aguisd.</p><p>
  
 Her late forlorne and naked he had found,<br>
 Where she did wander in waste wildernesse,<br>
 Lurking in rockes and caues farre vnder ground,<br>
 And with greene mosse cou'ring her nakednesse,<br>
 To hide her shame and loathly filthinesse;<br>
 Sith her Prince <i>Arthur</i> of proud ornaments<br>
 And borrow'd beautie spoyld. Her nathelesse<br>
 Th'enchaunter finding fit for his intents,<br>
 Did thus reuest, and deckt with due habiliments.</p><p>
  
 For all he did, was to deceiue good knights,<br>
 And draw them from pursuit of praise and fame,<br>
 To slug in slouth and sensuall delights,<br>
 And end their daies with irrenowmed shame.<br>
 And now exceeding griefe him ouercame,<br>
 To see the <i>Redcrosse</i> thus aduaunced hye;<br>
 Therefore this craftie engine he did frame,<br>
 Against his praise to stirre vp enmitye<br>
 Of such, as vertues like mote vnto him allye.</p><p>
  
 So now he <i>Guyon</i> guides an vncouth way<br>
 Through woods &amp; mountaines, till they came at last<br>
 Into a pleasant dale, that lowly lay<br>
 Betwixt two hils, whose high heads ouerplast,<br>
 The valley did with coole shade ouercast,<br>
 Through midst thereof a little riuer rold,<br>
 By which there sate a knight with helme vnlast,<br>
 Himselfe refreshing with the liquid cold,<br>
 After his trauell long, and labours manifold.</p><p>
  
 Loe yonder he, cryde <i>Archimage</i> alowd,<br>
 That wrought the shamefull fact, which I did shew;<br>
 And now he doth himselfe in secret shrowd,<br>
 To flie the vengeance for his outrage dew;<br>
 But vaine: for ye shall dearely do him rew,<br>
 So God ye speed, and send you good successe;<br>
 Which we farre off will here abide to vew.<br>
 So they him left, inflam'd with wrathfulnesse,<br>
 That streight against that knight his speare he did addresse.</p><p>
  
 Who seeing him from farre so fierce to pricke,<br>
 His warlike armes about him gan embrace,<br>
 And in the rest his readie speare did sticke;<br>
 Tho when as still he saw him towards pace,<br>
 He gan rencounter him in equall race.<br>
 They bene ymet, both readie to affrap,<br>
 When suddenly that warriour gan abace<br>
 His threatned speare, as if some new mishap<br>
 Had him betidde, or hidden daunger did entrap.</p><p>
  
 And cryde, Mercie Sir knight, and mercie Lord,<br>
 For mine offence and heedlesse hardiment,<br>
 That had almost committed crime abhord,<br>
 And with reprochfull shame mine honour shent,<br>
 Whiles cursed steele against that badge I bent,<br>
 The sacred badge of my Redeemers death,<br>
 Which on your shield is set for ornament:<br>
 But his fierce foe his steede could stay vneath,<br>
 Who prickt with courage kene, did cruell battell breath.</p><p>
  
 But when he heard him speake, streight way he knew<br>
 His error, and himselfe inclyning sayd;<br>
 Ah deare Sir <i>Guyon</i>, well becommeth you,<br>
 But me behoueth rather to vpbrayd,<br>
 Whose hastie hand so farre from reason strayd,<br>
 That almost it did haynous violence<br>
 On that faire image of that heauenly Mayd,<br>
 That decks and armes your shield with faire defence:<br>
 Your court'sie takes on you anothers due offence.</p><p>
  
 So bene they both attone, and doen vpreare<br>
 Their beuers bright, each other for to greete;<br>
 Goodly comportance each to other beare,<br>
 And entertaine themselues with court'sies meet,<br>
 Then said the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight, Now mote I weet,<br>
 Sir <i>Guyon</i>, why with so fierce saliaunce,<br>
 And fell intent ye did at earst me meet;<br>
 For sith I know your goodly gouernaunce,<br>
 Great cause, I weene, you guided, or some vncouth chaunce.</p><p>
  
 Certes (said he) well mote I shame to tell<br>
 The fond encheason, that me hither led.<br>
 A false infamous faitour late befell<br>
 Me for to meet, that seemed ill bested,<br>
 And playnd of grieuous outrage, which he red<br>
 A knight had wrought against a Ladie gent;<br>
 Which to auenge, he to this place me led,<br>
 Where you he made the marke of his intent,<br>
 And now is fled; foule shame him follow, where he went.</p><p>
  
 So can he turne his earnest vnto game,<br>
 Through goodly handling and wise temperance.<br>
 By this his aged guide in presence came;<br>
 Who soone as on that knight his eye did glance,<br>
 Eft soones of him had perfect cognizance,<br>
 Sith him in Faerie court he late auizd;<br>
 And said, Faire sonne, God giue you happie chance,<br>
 And that deare Crosse vpon your shield deuizd,<br>
 Wherewith aboue all knights ye goodly seeme aguizd.</p><p>
  
 Ioy may you haue, and euerlasting fame,<br>
 Of late most hard atchieu'ment by you donne,<br>
 For which enrolled is your glorious name<br>
 In heauenly Registers aboue the Sunne,<br>
 Where you a Saint with Saints your seat haue wonne:<br>
 But wretched we, where ye haue left your marke,<br>
 Must now anew begin, like race to runne;<br>
 God guide thee, <i>Guyon</i>, well to end thy warke,<br>
 And to the wished hauen bring thy weary barke.</p><p>
  
 Palmer, (him answered the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight)<br>
 His be the praise, that this atchieu'ment wrought,<br>
 Who made my hand the organ of his might;<br>
 More then goodwill to me attribute nought:<br>
 For all I did, I did but as I ought.<br>
 But you, faire Sir, whose pageant next ensewes,<br>
 Well mote yee thee, as well can wish your thought,<br>
 That home ye may report thrise happie newes;<br>
 For well ye worthie bene for worth and gentle thewes.</p><p>
  
 So courteous conge both did giue and take,<br>
 With right hands plighted, pledges of good will.<br>
 Then <i>Guyon</i> forward gan his voyage make,<br>
 With his blacke Palmer, that him guided still.<br>
 Still he him guided ouer dale and hill,<br>
 And with his steedie staffe did point his way:<br>
 His race with reason, and with words his will,<br>
 From foule intemperance he oft did stay,<br>
 And suffred not in wrath his hastie steps to stray.</p><p>
  
 In this faire wize they traueild long yfere,<br>
 Through many hard assayes, which did betide;<br>
 Of which he honour still away did beare,<br>
 And spred his glorie through all countries wide.<br>
 At last as chaunst them by a forest side<br>
 To passe, for succour from the scorching ray,<br>
 They heard a ruefull voice, that dearnly cride<br>
 With percing shriekes, and many a dolefull lay;<br>
 Which to attend, a while their forward steps they stay.</p><p>
  
 But if that carelesse heauens (quoth she) despise<br>
 The doome of iust reuenge, and take delight<br>
 To see sad pageants of mens miseries,<br>
 As bound by them to liue in liues despight,<br>
 Yet can they not warne death from wretched wight.<br>
 Come then, come soone, come sweetest death to mee,<br>
 And take away this long lent loathed light:<br>
 Sharpe by thy wounds, but sweet the medicines bee,<br>
 That long captiued soules from wearie thraldome free.</p><p>
  
 But thou, sweet Babe, whom frowning froward fate<br>
 Hath made sad witnesse of thy fathers fall,<br>
 Sith heauen thee deignes to hold in liuing state,<br>
 Long maist thou liue, and better thriue withall,<br>
 Then to thy lucklesse parents did befall:<br>
 Liue thou, and to thy mother dead attest,<br>
 That cleare she dide from blemish criminall;<br>
 Thy litle hands embrewd in bleeding brest<br>
 Loe I for pledges leaue.  So giue me leaue to rest.</p><p>
  
 With that a deadly shrieke she forth did throw,<br>
 That through the wood reecchoed againe,<br>
 And after gaue a grone so deepe and low,<br>
 That seemd her tender heart was rent in twaine,<br>
 Or thrild with point of thorough piercing paine;<br>
 As gentle Hynd, whose sides with cruell steele<br>
 Through launched, forth her bleeding life does raine,<br>
 Whiles the sad pang approching she does feele,<br>
 Brayes out her latest breath, and vp her eyes doth seele.</p><p>
  
 Which when that warriour heard, dismounting straict<br>
 From his tall steed, he rusht into the thicke,<br>
 And soone arriued, where that sad pourtraict<br>
 Of death and labour lay, halfe dead, halfe quicke,<br>
 In whose white alabaster brest did sticke<br>
 A cruell knife, that made a griesly wound,<br>
 From which forth gusht a streme of gorebloud thick,<br>
 That all her goodly garments staind around,<br>
 And into a deepe sanguine dide the grassie ground.</p><p>
  
 Pittifull spectacle of deadly smart,<br>
 Beside a bubbling fountaine low she lay,<br>
 Which she increased with her bleeding hart,<br>
 And the cleane waues with purple gore did ray;<br>
 Als in her lap a louely babe did play<br>
 His cruell sport, in stead of sorrow dew;<br>
 For in her streaming blood he did embay<br>
 His litle hands, and tender ioynts embrew;<br>
 Pitifull spectacle, as euer eye did view.</p><p>
  
 Besides them both, vpon the soiled gras<br>
 The dead corse of an armed knight was spred,<br>
 Whose armour all with bloud besprinckled was;<br>
 His ruddie lips did smile, and rosy red<br>
 Did paint his chearefull cheekes, yet being ded,<br>
 Seemd to haue beene a goodly personage,<br>
 Now in his freshest flowre of lustie hed,<br>
 Fit to inflame faire Lady with loues rage,<br>
 But that fiers fate did crop the blossome of his age.</p><p>
  
 Whom when the good Sir <i>Guyon</i> did behold,<br>
 His hart gan wexe as starke, as marble stone,<br>
 And his fresh bloud did frieze with fearefull cold,<br>
 That all his senses seemd bereft attone:<br>
 At last his mightie ghost gan deepe to grone,<br>
 As Lyon grudging in his great disdaine,<br>
 Mournes inwardly, and makes to himselfe mone:<br>
 Till ruth and fraile affection did constraine,<br>
 His stout courage to stoupe, and shew his inward paine.</p><p>
  
 Out of her gored wound the cruell steele<br>
 He lightly snatcht, and did the floudgate stop<br>
 With his faire garment: then gan softly feele<br>
 Her feeble pulse, to proue if any drop<br>
 Of liuing bloud yet in her veynes did hop;<br>
 Which when he felt to moue, he hoped faire<br>
 To call backe life to her forsaken shop;<br>
 So well he did her deadly wounds repaire,<br>
 That at the last she gan to breath out liuing aire.</p><p>
  
 Which he perceiuing greatly gan reioice,<br>
 And goodly counsell, that for wounded hart<br>
 Is meetest med'cine, tempred with sweet voice;<br>
 Ay me, deare Lady, which the image art<br>
 Of ruefull pitie, and impatient smart,<br>
 What direfull chance, armd with reuenging fate,<br>
 Or cursed hand hath plaid this cruell part,<br>
 Thus fowle to hasten your vntimely date;<br>
 Speake, O deare Lady speake: help neuer comes too late.</p><p>
  
 Therewith her dim eie-lids she vp gan reare,<br>
 On which the drery death did sit, as sad<br>
 As lump of lead, and made darke clouds appeare;<br>
 But when as him all in bright armour clad<br>
 Before her standing she espied had,<br>
 As one out of a deadly dreame affright,<br>
 She weakely started, yet she nothing drad:<br>
 Streight downe againe her selfe in great despight<br>
 She groueling threw to ground, as hating life and light.</p><p>
  
 The gentle knight her soone with carefull paine<br>
 Vplifted light, and softly did vphold:<br>
 Thrise he her reard, and thrise she sunke againe,<br>
 Till he his armes about her sides gan fold,<br>
 And to her said; Yet if the stony cold<br>
 Haue not all seized on your frozen hart,<br>
 Let one word fall that may your griefe vnfold,<br>
 And tell the secret of your mortall smart;<br>
 He oft finds present helpe, who does his griefe impart.</p><p>
  
 Then casting vp a deadly looke, full low,<br>
 Shee sight from bottome of her wounded brest,<br>
 And after, many bitter throbs did throw<br>
 With lips full pale and foltring tongue opprest,<br>
 These words she breathed forth from riuen chest;<br>
 Leaue, ah leaue off, what euer wight thou bee,<br>
 To let a wearie wretch from her dew rest,<br>
 And trouble dying soules tranquilitee.<br>
 Take not away now got, which none would giue to me.</p><p>
  
 Ah farre be it (said he) Deare dame fro mee,<br>
 To hinder soule from her desired rest,<br>
 Or hold sad life in long captiuitee:<br>
 For all I seeke, is but to haue redrest<br>
 The bitter pangs, that doth your heart infest.<br>
 Tell then, ô Lady tell, what fatall priefe<br>
 Hath with so huge misfortune you opprest?<br>
 That I may cast to compasse your reliefe,<br>
 Or die with you in sorrow, and partake your griefe.</p><p>
  
 With feeble hands then stretched forth on hye,<br>
 As heauen accusing guiltie of her death,<br>
 And with dry drops congealed in her eye,<br>
 In these sad words she spent her vtmost breath:<br>
 Heare then, ô man, the sorrowes that vneath<br>
 My tongue can tell, so farre all sense they pas:<br>
 Loe this dead corpse, that lies here vnderneath,<br>
 The gentlest knight, that euer on greene gras<br>
 Gay steed with spurs did pricke, the good Sir <i>Mortdant</i> was.</p><p>
  
 Was, (ay the while, that he is not so now)<br>
 My Lord my loue; my deare Lord, my deare loue,<br>
 So long as heauens iust with equall brow<br>
 Vouchsafed to behold vs from aboue,<br>
 One day when him high courage did emmoue,<br>
 As wont ye knights to seeke aduentures wilde,<br>
 He pricked forth, his puissant force to proue,<br>
 Me then he left enwombed of this child,<br>
 This lucklesse child, whom thus ye see with bloud defild.</p><p>
  
 Him fortuned (hard fortune ye may ghesse)<br>
 To come, where vile <i>Acrasia</i> does wonne,<br>
 <i>Acrasia</i> a false enchaunteresse,<br>
 That many errant knights hath foule fordonne:<br>
 Within a wandring Island, that doth ronne<br>
 And stray in perilous gulfe, her dwelling is:<br>
 Faire Sir, if euer there ye trauell, shonne<br>
 The cursed land where many wend amis,<br>
 And know it by the name; it hight the <i>Bowre of blis</i>.</p><p>
  
 Her blisse is all in pleasure and delight,<br>
 Wherewith she makes her louers drunken mad,<br>
 And then with words &amp; weedes of wondrous might,<br>
 On them she workes her will to vses bad:<br>
 My lifest Lord she thus beguiled had;<br>
 For he was flesh: (all flesh doth frailtie breed.)<br>
 Whom when I heard to beene so ill bestad,<br>
 Weake wretch I wrapt my selfe in Palmers weed,<br>
 And cast to seeke him forth through daunger and great dreed.</p><p>
  
 Now had faire <i>Cynthia</i> by euen tournes<br>
 Full measured three quarters of her yeare,<br>
 And thrise three times had fild her crooked hornes,<br>
 Whenas my wombe her burdein would forbeare,<br>
 And bad me call <i>Lucina</i> to me neare.<br>
 <i>Lucina</i> came: a manchild forth I brought:<br>
 The woods, the Nymphes, my bowres, my midwiues weare,<br>
 Hard helpe at need.  So deare thee babe I bought,<br>
 Yt nought too deare I deemd, while so my dear I sought.</p><p>
  
 Him so I sought, and so at last I found<br>
 Where him that witch had thralled to her will,<br>
 In chaines of lust and lewd desires ybound,<br>
 And so transformed from his former skill,<br>
 That me he knew not, neither his owne ille;<br>
 Till through wise handling and faire gouernance,<br>
 I him recured to a better will,<br>
 Purged from drugs of foule intemperance:<br>
 Then meanes I gan deuise for his deliuerance.</p><p>
  
 Which when the vile Enchaunteresse perceiu'd,<br>
 How that my Lord from her I would repriue,<br>
 With cup thus charmd, him parting she deceiu'd;<br>
 <i>Sad verse, giue death to him that death does giue,<br>
 And losse of loue, to her that loues to liue,<br>
 So soone as Bacchus with the Nymphe does lincke:</i><br>
 So parted we and on our iourney driue,<br>
 Till comming to this well, he stoupt to drincke:<br>
 The charme fulfild, dead suddenly he downe did sincke.</p><p>
  
 Which when I wretch,---Not one word more she sayd<br>
 But breaking off, the end for want of breath,<br>
 And slyding soft, as downe to sleepe her layd,<br>
 And ended all her woe in quiet death.<br>
 That seeing good Sir <i>Guyon</i>, could vneath<br>
 From teares abstaine, for griefe his hart did grate,<br>
 And from so heauie sight his head did wreath,<br>
 Accusing fortune, and too cruell fate,<br>
 Which plunged had faire Ladie in so wretched state.</p><p>
  
 Then turning to his Palmer said, Old syre<br>
 Behold the image of mortalitie,<br>
 And feeble nature cloth'd with fleshly tyre,<br>
 When raging passion with fierce tyrannie<br>
 Robs reason of her due regalitie<br>
 And makes it seruant to her basest part:<br>
 The strong it weakens with infirmitie,<br>
 And with bold furie armes the weakest hart;<br>
 The strong through pleasure soonest falles, the weake through
 smart.</p><p>
  
 But temperance (said he) with golden squire<br>
 Betwixt them both can measure out a meane,<br>
 Neither to melt in pleasures whot desire,<br>
 Nor fry in hartlesse griefe and dolefull teene.<br>
 Thrise happie man, who fares them both atweene:<br>
 But sith this wretched woman ouercome<br>
 Of anguish, rather then of crime hath beene,<br>
 Reserue her cause to her eternall doome,<br>
 And in the meane vouchsafe her honorable toombe.</p><p>
  
 Palmer (quoth he) death is an equall doome<br>
 To good and bad, the common Inne of rest;<br>
 But after death the tryall is to come,<br>
 When best shall be to them, that liued best:<br>
 But both alike, when death hath both supprest,<br>
 Religious reuerence doth buriall teene,<br>
 Which who so wants, wants so much of his rest;<br>
 For all so great shame after death I weene,<br>
 As selfe to dyen bad, vnburied bad to beene.</p><p>
  
 So both agree their bodies to engraue;<br>
 The great earthes wombe they open to the sky,<br>
 And with sad Cypresse seemely it embraue,<br>
 Then couering with a clod their closed eye,<br>
 They lay therein those corses tenderly,<br>
 And bid them sleepe in euerlasting peace.<br>
 But ere they did their vtmost obsequy,<br>
 Sir <i>Guyon</i> more affection to increace,<br>
 Bynempt a sacred vow, which none should aye releace.</p><p>
  
 The dead knights sword out of his sheath he drew,<br>
 With which he cut a locke of all their heare,<br>
 Which medling with their bloud and earth, he threw<br>
 Into the graue, and gan deuoutly sweare;<br>
 Such and such euill God on <i>Guyon</i> reare,<br>
 And worse and worse young Orphane be thy paine,<br>
 If I or thou dew vengeance doe forbeare,<br>
 Till guiltie bloud her guerdon doe obtaine:<br>
 So shedding many teares, they closd the earth againe.</p><p>
