 <i>Calidore hostes with Meliboe<br>
 and loues fayre Pastorell;<br>
 Coridon enuies him, yet he<br>
 for ill rewards him well.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 N
 Ow turne againe my teme thou iolly swayne,<br>
 Backe to the furrow which I lately left;<br>
 I lately left a furrow, one or twayne<br>
 Vnplough'd, the which my coulter hath not cleft:<br>
 Yet seem'd the soyle both fayre and frutefull eft,<br>
 As I it past, that were too great a shame,<br>
 That so rich frute should be from vs bereft;<br>
 Besides the great dishonour and defame,<br>
 Which should befall to <i>Calidores</i> immortall name.<p>
 
 Great trauell hath the gentle <i>Calidore</i><br>
 And toyle endured, sith I left him last<br>
 Sewing the <i>Blatant beast</i>, which I forbore<br>
 To finish then, for other present hast.<br>
 Full many pathes and perils he hath past,<br>
 Through hils, through dales, throgh forests, &amp; throgh plaines<br>
 In that same quest which Fortune on him cast,<br>
 Which he atchieued to his owne great gaines,<br>
 Reaping eternall glorie of his restlesse paines.</p><p>
 
 So sharply he the Monster did pursew,<br>
 That day nor night he suffred him to rest,<br>
 Ne rested he himselfe but natures dew,<br>
 For dread of daunger, not to be redrest,<br>
 If he for slouth forslackt so famous quest.<br>
 Him first from court he to the citties coursed,<br>
 And from the citties to the townes him prest,<br>
 And from the townes into the countrie forsed,<br>
 And from the country back to priuate farmes he scorsed.</p><p>
 
 From thence into the open fields he fled,<br>
 Whereas the Heardes were keeping of their neat,<br>
 And shepheards singing to their flockes, that fed,<br>
 Layes of sweete loue and youthes delightfull heat:<br>
 Him thether eke for all his fearefull threat<br>
 He followed fast, and chaced him so nie,<br>
 That to the folds, where sheepe at night doe seat,<br>
 And to the litle cots, where shepherds lie<br>
 In winters wrathfull time, he forced him to flie.</p><p>
 
 There on a day as he pursew'd the chace,<br>
 He chaunst to spy a sort of shepheard groomes,<br>
 Playing on pypes, and caroling apace,<br>
 The whyles their beasts there in the budded broomes<br>
 Beside them fed, and nipt the tender bloomes:<br>
 For other worldly wealth they cared nought.<br>
 To whom Sir <i>Calidore</i> yet sweating comes,<br>
 And them to tell him courteously besought,<br>
 If such a beast they saw, which he had thether brought.</p><p>
 
 They answer'd him, that no such beast they saw,<br>
 Nor any wicked feend, that mote offend<br>
 Their happie flockes, nor daunger to them draw:<br>
 But if that such there were (as none they kend)<br>
 They prayd high God him farre from them to send.<br>
 Then one of them him seeing so to sweat,<br>
 After his rusticke wise, that well he weend,<br>
 Offred him drinke, to quench his thirstie heat,<br>
 And if he hungry were, him offred eke to eat.</p><p>
 
 The knight was nothing nice, where was no need,<br>
 And tooke their gentle offer: so adowne<br>
 They prayd him sit, and gaue him for to feed<br>
 Such homely what, as serues the simple clowne,<br>
 That doth despise the dainties of the towne.<br>
 Tho hauing fed his fill, he there besyde<br>
 Saw a faire damzell, which did weare a crowne<br>
 Of sundry flowres, with silken ribbands tyde,<br>
 Yclad in home-made greene that her owne hands had dyde.</p><p>
 
 Vpon a litle hillocke she was placed<br>
 Higher then all the rest, and round about<br>
 Enuiron'd with a girland, goodly graced,<br>
 Of louely lasses, and them all without<br>
 The lustie shepheard swaynes sate in a rout,<br>
 The which did pype and sing her prayses dew,<br>
 And oft reioyce, and oft for wonder shout,<br>
 As if some miracle of heauenly hew<br>
 Were downe to them descended in that earthly vew.</p><p>
 
 And soothly sure she was full fayre of face,<br>
 And perfectly well shapt in euery lim,<br>
 Which she did more augment with modest grace,<br>
 And comely carriage of her count'nance trim,<br>
 That all the rest like lesser lamps did dim:<br>
 Who her admiring as some heauenly wight,<br>
 Did for their soueraine goddesse her esteeme,<br>
 And caroling her name both day and night,<br>
 The fayrest <i>Pastorella</i> her by name did hight.</p><p>
 
 Ne was there heard, ne was there shepheards swayne<br>
 But her did honour, and eke many a one<br>
 Burnt in her loue, and with sweet pleasing payne<br>
 Full many a night for her did sigh and grone:<br>
 But most of all the shepheard <i>Coridon</i><br>
 For her did languish, and his deare life spend;<br>
 Yet neither she for him, nor other none<br>
 Did care a whit, ne any liking lend:<br>
 Though meane her lot, yet higher did her mind ascend.</p><p>
 
 Her whyles Sir <i>Calidore</i> there vewed well,<br>
 And markt her rare demeanure, which him seemed<br>
 So farre the meane of shepheards to excell,<br>
 As that he in his mind her worthy deemed,<br>
 To be a Princes Paragone esteemed,<br>
 He was vnwares surprisd in subtile bands<br>
 Of the blynd boy, ne thence could be redeemed<br>
 By any skill out of his cruell hands;<br>
 Caught like the bird, which gazing still on others stands.</p><p>
 
 So stood he still long gazing thereupon,<br>
 Ne any will had thence to moue away,<br>
 Although his quest were farre afore him gon;<br>
 But after he had fed, yet did he stay,<br>
 And sate there still, vntill the flying day<br>
 Was farre forth spent, discoursing diuersly<br>
 Of sundry things, as fell, to worke delay;<br>
 And euermore his speach he did apply<br>
 To th'heards, but meant them to the damzels fantazy.</p><p>
 
 By this the moystie night approching fast,<br>
 Her deawy humour gan on th'earth to shed,<br>
 That warn'd the shepheards to their homes to hast<br>
 Their tender flocks, now being fully fed,<br>
 For feare of wetting them before their bed;<br>
 Then came to them a good old aged syre,<br>
 Whose siluer lockes bedeckt his beard and hed,<br>
 With shepheards hooke in hand, and fit attyre,<br>
 That wild the damzell rise; the day did now expyre.</p><p>
 
 He was to weet by common voice esteemed<br>
 The father of the fayrest <i>Pastorell</i>,<br>
 And of her selfe in very deede so deemed;<br>
 Yet was not so, but as old stories tell<br>
 Found her by fortune, which to him befell,<br>
 In th'open fields an Infant left alone,<br>
 And taking vp brought home, and noursed well<br>
 As his owne chyld; for other he had none,<br>
 That she in tract of time accompted was his owne.</p><p>
 
 She at his bidding meekely did arise,<br>
 And streight vnto her litle flocke did fare:<br>
 Then all the rest about her rose likewise,<br>
 And each his sundrie sheepe with seuerall care<br>
 Gathered together, and them homeward bare:<br>
 Whylest euerie one with helping hands did striue<br>
 Amongst themselues, and did their labours share,<br>
 To helpe faire <i>Pastorella</i>, home to driue<br>
 Her fleecie flocke; but <i>Coridon</i> most helpe did giue.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Meliboee</i> (so hight that good old man)<br>
 Now seeing <i>Calidore</i> left all alone,<br>
 And night arriued hard at hand, began<br>
 Him to inuite vnto his simple home;<br>
 Which though it were a cottage clad with lome,<br>
 And all things therein meane, yet better so<br>
 To lodge, then in the saluage fields to rome.<br>
 The knight full gladly soone agreed thereto,<br>
 Being his harts owne wish, and home with him did go.</p><p>
 
 There he was welcom'd of that honest syre,<br>
 And of his aged Beldame homely well;<br>
 Who him besought himselfe to disattyre,<br>
 And rest himselfe, till supper time befell.<br>
 By which home came the fayrest <i>Pastorell</i>,<br>
 After her flocke she in their fold had tyde,<br>
 And supper readie dight, they to it fell<br>
 With small adoe, and nature satisfyde,<br>
 The which doth litle craue contented to abyde.</p><p>
 
 Tho when they had their hunger slaked well,<br>
 And the fayre mayd the table ta'ne away,<br>
 The gentle knight, as he that did excell<br>
 In courtesie, and well could doe and say,<br>
 For so great kindnesse as he found that day,<br>
 Gan greatly thanke his host and his good wife;<br>
 And drawing thence his speach another way,<br>
 Gan highly to commend the happie life,<br>
 Which Shepheards lead, without debate or bitter strife.</p><p>
 
 How much (sayd he) more happie is the state,<br>
 In which ye father here doe dwell at ease,<br>
 Leading a life so free and fortunate,<br>
 From all the tempests of these worldly seas,<br>
 Which tosse the rest in daungerous disease?<br>
 Where warres, and wreckes, and wicked enmitie<br>
 Doe them afflict, which no man can appease,<br>
 That certes I your happinesse enuie,<br>
 And wish my lot were plast in such felicitie.</p><p>
 
 Surely my sonne (then answer'd he againe)<br>
 If happie, then it is in this intent,<br>
 That hauing small, yet doe I not complaine<br>
 Of want, ne wish for more it to augment,<br>
 But doe my self, with that I haue, content;<br>
 So taught of nature, which doth litle need<br>
 Of forreine helpes to lifes due nourishment:<br>
 The fields my food, my flocke my rayment breed;<br>
 No better doe I weare, no better doe I feed.</p><p>
 
 Therefore I doe not any one enuy,<br>
 Nor am enuyde of any one therefore;<br>
 They that haue much, feare much to loose thereby,<br>
 And store of cares doth follow riches store.<br>
 The litle that I haue, growes dayly more<br>
 Without my care, but onely to attend it;<br>
 My lambes doe euery yeare increase their score,<br>
 And my flockes father daily doth amend it.<br>
 What haue I, but to praise th'Almighty, that doth send it?</p><p>
 
 To them, that list, the worlds gay showes I leaue,<br>
 And to great ones such follies doe forgiue,<br>
 Which oft through pride do their owne perill weaue,<br>
 And through ambition downe themselues doe driue<br>
 To sad decay, that might contented liue.<br>
 Me no such cares nor combrous thoughts offend,<br>
 Ne once my minds vnmoued quiet grieue,<br>
 But all the night in siluer sleepe I spend,<br>
 And all the day, to what I list, I doe attend.</p><p>
 
 Sometimes I hunt the Fox, the vowed foe<br>
 Vnto my Lambes, and him dislodge away;<br>
 Sometime the fawne I practise from the Doe,<br>
 Or from the Goat her kidde how to conuay;<br>
 Another while I baytes and nets display,<br>
 The birds to catch, or fishes to beguyle:<br>
 And when I wearie am, I downe doe lay<br>
 My limbes in euery shade, to rest from toyle,<br>
 And drinke of euery brooke, when thirst my throte doth boyle.</p><p>
 
 The time was once, in my first prime of yeares,<br>
 When pride of youth forth pricked my desire,<br>
 That I disdain'd amongst mine equall peares<br>
 To follow sheepe, and shepheards base attire:<br>
 For further fortune then I would inquire.<br>
 And leauing home, to roiall court I sought;<br>
 Where I did sell my selfe for yearely hire,<br>
 And in the Princes gardin daily wrought:<br>
 There I beheld such vainenesse, as I neuer thought.</p><p>
 
 With sight whereof soone cloyd, and long deluded<br>
 With idle hopes, which them doe entertaine,<br>
 After I had ten yeares my selfe excluded<br>
 From natiue home, and spent my youth in vaine,<br>
 I gan my follies to my selfe to plaine,<br>
 And this sweet peace, whose lacke did then appeare.<br>
 Tho backe returning to my sheepe againe,<br>
 I from thenceforth haue learn'd to loue more deare<br>
 This lowly quiet life, which I inherite here.</p><p>
 
 Whylest thus he talkt, the knight with greedy eare<br>
 Hong still vpon his melting mouth attent;<br>
 Whose sensefull words empierst his hart so neare,<br>
 That he was rapt with double rauishment,<br>
 Both of his speach that wrought him great content,<br>
 And also of the obiect of his vew,<br>
 On which his hungry eye was alwayes bent;<br>
 That twixt his pleasing tongue, and her faire hew,<br>
 He lost himselfe, and like one halfe entraunced grew.</p><p>
 
 Yet to occasion meanes, to worke his mind,<br>
 And to insinuate his harts desire,<br>
 He thus replyde; Now surely syre, I find,<br>
 That all this worlds gay showes, which we admire,<br>
 Be but vaine shadowes to this safe retyre<br>
 Of life, which here in lowlinesse ye lead,<br>
 Fearelesse of foes, or fortunes wrackfull yre,<br>
 Which tosseth states, and vnder foot doth tread<br>
 The mightie ones, affrayd of euery chaunges dread.</p><p>
 
 That euen I which daily doe behold<br>
 The glorie of the great, mongst whom I won,<br>
 And now haue prou'd, what happineesse ye hold<br>
 In this small plot of your dominion,<br>
 Now loath great Lordship and ambition;<br>
 And wish the heauens so much had graced mee,<br>
 As graunt me liue in like condition;<br>
 Or that my fortunes might transposed bee<br>
 From pitch of higher place, vnto this low degree.</p><p>
 
 In vaine (said then old <i>Meliboe</i>) doe men<br>
 The heauens of their fortunes fault accuse,<br>
 Sith they know best, what is the best for them:<br>
 For they to each such fortune doe diffuse,<br>
 As they doe know each can most aptly vse.<br>
 For not that, which men couet most, is best,<br>
 Nor that thing worst, which men do most refuse;<br>
 But fittest is, that all contented rest<br>
 With that they hold: each hath his fortune in his brest.</p><p>
 
 It is the mynd, that maketh good or ill,<br>
 That maketh wretch or happie, rich or poore:<br>
 For some, that hath abundance at his will,<br>
 Hath not enough, but wants in greatest store;<br>
 And other, that hath litle, askes no more,<br>
 But in that litle is both rich and wise.<br>
 For wisedome is most riches; fooles therefore<br>
 They are, which fortunes doe by vowes deuize,<br>
 Sith each vnto himselfe his life may fortunize.</p><p>
 
 Since then in each mans self (said <i>Calidore</i>)<br>
 It is, to fashion his owne lyfes estate,<br>
 Giue leaue awhyle, good father, in this shore<br>
 To rest my barcke, which hath bene beaten late<br>
 With stormes of fortune and tempestuous fate,<br>
 In seas of troubles and of toylesome paine,<br>
 That whether quite from them for to retrate<br>
 I shal resolue, or backe to turne againe,<br>
 I may here with your selfe some small repose obtaine.</p><p>
 
 Not that the burden of so bold a guest<br>
 Shall chargefull be, or chaunge to you at all;<br>
 For your meane food shall be my daily feast,<br>
 And this your cabin both my bowre and hall.<br>
 Besides for recompence hereof, I shall<br>
 You well reward, and golden guerdon giue,<br>
 That may perhaps you better much withall,<br>
 And in this quiet make you safer liue.<br>
 So forth he drew much gold, and toward him it driue.</p><p>
 
 But the good man, nought tempted with the offer<br>
 Of his rich mould, did thrust it farre away,<br>
 And thus bespake; Sir knight, your bounteous proffe[r]<br>
 Be farre fro me, to whom ye ill display<br>
 That mucky masse, the cause of mens decay,<br>
 That mote empaire my peace with daungers dread.<br>
 But if ye algates couet to assay<br>
 This simple sort of life, that shepheards lead,<br>
 Be it your owne: our rudenesse to your selfe aread.</p><p>
 
 So there that night Sir <i>Calidore</i> did dwell,<br>
 And long while after, whilest him list remaine,<br>
 Dayly beholding the faire <i>Pastorell</i>,<br>
 And feeding on the bayt of his owne bane.<br>
 During which time he did her entertaine<br>
 With all kind courtesies, he could inuent;<br>
 And euery day, her companie to gaine,<br>
 When to the field she went, he with her went:<br>
 So for to quench his fire, he did it more augment.</p><p>
 
 But she that neuer had acquainted beene<br>
 With such queint vsage, fit for Queenes and Kings,<br>
 Ne euer had such knightly seruice seene,<br>
 But being bred vnder base shepheards wings,<br>
 Had euer learn'd to loue the lowly things,<br>
 Did litle whit regard his courteous guize,<br>
 But cared more for <i>Colins</i> carolings<br>
 Then all that he could doe, or euer deuize:<br>
 His layes, his loues, his lookes she did them all despize.</p><p>
 
 Which <i>Calidore</i> perceiuing, thought it best<br>
 To chaunge the manner of his loftie looke;<br>
 And doffing his bright armes, himselfe addrest<br>
 In shepheards weed, and in his hand he tooke,<br>
 In stead of steelehead speare, a shepheards hooke;<br>
 That who had seene him then, would haue bethought<br>
 On <i>Phrygian Paris</i> by <i>Plexippus</i> brooke,<br>
 When he the loue of fayre <i>Oenone</i> sought,<br>
 What time the golden apple was vnto him brought.</p><p>
 
 So being clad, vnto the fields he went<br>
 With the faire <i>Pastorella</i> euery day,<br>
 And kept her sheepe with diligent attent,<br>
 Watching to driue the rauenous Wolfe away,<br>
 The whylest at pleasure she mote sport and play;<br>
 And euery euening helping them to fold:<br>
 And otherwhiles for need, he did assay<br>
 In his strong hand their rugged teats to hold,<br>
 And out of them to presse the milke: loue so much could.</p><p>
 
 Which seeing <i>Coridon</i>, who her likewise<br>
 Long time had lou'd, and hop'd her loue to gaine,<br>
 He much was troubled at that straungers guize,<br>
 And many gealous thoughts conceiu'd in vaine,<br>
 That this of all his labour and long paine<br>
 Should reap the haruest, ere it ripened were;<br>
 That made him scoule, and pout, and oft complaine<br>
 Of <i>Pastorell</i> to all the shepheards there,<br>
 That she did loue a stranger swayne then him more dere.</p><p>
 
 And euer when him came in companie,<br>
 Where <i>Calidore</i> was present, he would loure,<br>
 And byte his lip, and euen for gealousie<br>
 Was readie oft his owne hart to deuoure,<br>
 Impatient of any paramoure:<br>
 Who on the other side did seeme so farre<br>
 From malicing, or grudging his good houre,<br>
 That all he could, he graced him with her,<br>
 Ne euer shewed signe of rancour or of iarre.</p><p>
 
 And oft, when <i>Coridon</i> vnto her brought<br>
 Or litle sparrowes, stolen from their nest,<br>
 Or wanton squirrels, in the woods farre sought,<br>
 Or other daintie thing for her addrest,<br>
 He would commend his guift, and make the best.<br>
 Yet she no whit his presents did regard,<br>
 Ne him could find to fancie in her brest:<br>
 This newcome shepheard had his market mard.<br>
 Old loue is litle worth when new is more prefard.</p><p>
 
 One day when as the shepheard swaynes together<br>
 Were met, to make their sports and merrie glee,<br>
 As they are wont in faire sunshynie weather,<br>
 The whiles their flockes in shadowes shrouded bee,<br>
 They fell to daunce: then did they all agree,<br>
 That <i>Colin Clout</i> should pipe as one most fit;<br>
 And <i>Calidore</i> should lead the ring, as hee<br>
 That most in <i>Pastorellaes</i> grace did sit.<br>
 Thereat frown'd <i>Coridon</i>, and his lip closely bit.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Calidore</i> of courteous inclination<br>
 Tooke <i>Coridon</i>, and set him in his place,<br>
 That he should lead the daunce, as was his fashion;<br>
 For <i>Coridon</i> could daunce, and trimly trace.<br>
 And when as <i>Pastorella</i>, him to grace,<br>
 Her flowry garlond tooke from her owne head,<br>
 And plast on his, he did it soone displace,<br>
 And did it put on <i>Coridons</i> in stead:<br>
 Then <i>Coridon</i> woxe frollicke, that earst seemed dead.</p><p>
 
 Another time, when as they did dispose<br>
 To practise games, and maisteries to try,<br>
 They for their Iudge did <i>Pastorella</i> chose;<br>
 A garland was the meed of victory.<br>
 There <i>Coridon</i> forth stepping openly,<br>
 Did chalenge <i>Calidore</i> to wrestling game:<br>
 For he through long and perfect industry,<br>
 Therein well practisd was, and in the same<br>
 Thought sure t'auenge his grudge, &amp; worke his foe great shame.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Calidore</i> he greatly did mistake;<br>
 For he was strong and mightily stiffe pight,<br>
 That with one fall his necke he almost brake,<br>
 And had he not vpon him fallen light,<br>
 His dearest ioynt he sure had broken quight.<br>
 Then was the oaken crowne by <i>Pastorell</i><br>
 Giuen to <i>Calidore</i>, as his due right;<br>
 But he, that did in courtesie excell,<br>
 Gaue it to <i>Coridon</i>, and said he wonne it well.</p><p>
 
 Thus did the gentle knight himselfe abeare<br>
 Amongst that rusticke rout in all his deeds,<br>
 That euen they, the which his riuals were,<br>
 Could not maligne him, but commend him needs:<br>
 For courtesie amongst the rudest breds<br>
 Good will and fauour. So it surely wrought<br>
 With this faire Mayd, and in her mynde the seeds<br>
 Of perfect loue did sow, that last forth brought<br>
 The fruite of ioy and blisse, though long time dearely bought.</p><p>
 
 Thus <i>Calidore</i> continu'd there long time,<br>
 To winne the loue of the faire <i>Pastorell</i>;<br>
 Which hauing got, he vsed without crime<br>
 Or blamefull blot, but menaged so well,<br>
 That he of all the rest, which there did [d]well,<br>
 Was fauoured, and to her grace commmended.<br>
 But what straunge fortunes vnto him befell,<br>
 Ere he attain'd the point by him intended,<br>
 Shall more conueniently in other place be ended.</p><p>
