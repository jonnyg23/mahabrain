 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Artegall trayn'd in Iustice lore<br>
 Irenaes quest pursewed,<br>
 He doeth auenge on Sanglier<br>
 His Ladies bloud embrewed.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 T
 Hough vertue then were held in highest price,<br>
 In those old times, of which I doe intreat,<br>
 Yet then likewise the wicked seede of vice<br>
 Began to spring which shortly grew full great,<br>
 And with their boughes the gentle plants did beat.<br>
 But euermore some of the vertuous race<br>
 Rose vp, inspired with heroicke heat,<br>
 That cropt the branches of the sient base,<br>
 And with strong hand their fruitfull rancknes did deface.<p>
 
 Such first was <i>Bacchus</i>, that with furious might<br>
 All th'East before vntam'd did ouerronne,<br>
 And wrong repressed, and establisht right,<br>
 Which lawlesse men had formerly fordonne.<br>
 There Iustice first her princely rule begonne.<br>
 Next <i>Hercules</i> his like ensample shewed,<br>
 Who all the West with equall conquest wonne,<br>
 And monstrous tyrants with his club subdewed;<br>
 The club of Iustice dread, with kingly powre endewed.</p><p>
 
 And such was he, of whom I haue to tell,<br>
 The Champion of true Iustice <i>Artegall</i>.<br>
 Whom (as ye lately mote remember well)<br>
 An hard aduenture, which did then befall,<br>
 Into redoubted perill forth did call;<br>
 That was to succour a distressed Dame,<br>
 Whom a strong tyrant did vniustly thrall,<br>
 And from the heritage, which she did clame,<br>
 Did with strong hand withhold: <i>Grantorto</i> was his name.</p><p>
 
 Wherefore the Lady, which <i>Eirena</i> hight,<br>
 Did to the Faery Queene her way addresse,<br>
 To whom complayning her afflicted plight,<br>
 She her besought of gratious redresse.<br>
 That soueraine Queene, that mightie Emperesse,<br>
 Whose glorie is to aide all suppliants pore,<br>
 And of weake Princes to be Patronesse,<br>
 Chose <i>Artegall</i> to right her to restore;<br>
 For that to her he seem'd best skild in righteous lore.</p><p>
 
 For <i>Artegall</i> in iustice was vpbrought<br>
 Euen from the cradle of his infancie,<br>
 And all the depth of rightfull doome was taught<br>
 By faire <i>Astræa</i>, with great industrie,<br>
 Whilest here on earth she liued mortallie.<br>
 For till the world from his perfection fell<br>
 Into all filth and foule iniquitie,<br>
 <i>Astræa</i> here mongst earthly men did dwell,<br>
 And in the rules of iustice them instructed well.</p><p>
 
 Whiles through the world she walked in this sort,<br>
 Vpon a day she found this gentle childe,<br>
 Amongst his peres playing his childish sport:<br>
 Whom seeing fit, and with no crime defilde,<br>
 She did allure with gifts and speaches milde,<br>
 To wend with her.  So thence him farre she brought<br>
 Into a caue from companie exilde,<br>
 In which she noursled him, till yeares he raught,<br>
 And all the discipline of iustice there him taught.</p><p>
 
 There she him taught to weigh both right and wrong<br>
 In equall ballance with due recompence,<br>
 And equitie to measure out along,<br>
 According to the line of conscience,<br>
 When so it needs with rigour to dispence.<br>
 Of all the which, for want there of mankind,<br>
 She caused him to make experience<br>
 Vpon wyld beasts, which she in woods did find,<br>
 With wrongfull powre oppressing others of their kind.</p><p>
 
 Thus she him trayned, and thus she him taught,<br>
 In all the skill of deeming wrong and right,<br>
 Vntill the ripenesse of mans yeares he raught;<br>
 That euen wilde beasts did feare his awfull sight,<br>
 And men admyr'd his ouerruling might;<br>
 Ne any liu'd on ground, that durst withstand<br>
 His dreadfull heast, much lesse him match in fight,<br>
 Or bide the horror of his wreakfull hand,<br>
 When so he list in wrath lift vp his steely brand.</p><p>
 
 Which steely brand, to make him dreaded more,<br>
 She gaue vnto him, gotten by her slight<br>
 And earnest search, where it was kept in store<br>
 In <i>Ioues</i> eternall house, vnwist of wight,<br>
 Since he himselfe it vs'd in that great fight<br>
 Against the <i>Titans</i>, that whylome rebelled<br>
 Gainst highest heauen; <i>Chrysaor</i> it was hight;<br>
 <i>Chrysaor</i> that all other swords excelled,<br>
 Well prou'd in that same day, when <i>Ioue</i> those Gyants quelled.</p><p>
 
 For of most perfect metall it was made,<br>
 Tempred with Adamant amongst the same,<br>
 And garnisht all with gold vpon the blade<br>
 In goodly wise, whereof it tooke his name,<br>
 And was of no lesse vertue, then of fame.<br>
 For there no substance was so firme and hard,<br>
 But it would pierce or cleaue, where so it came;<br>
 Ne any armour could his dint out ward,<br>
 But wheresoeuer it did light, it throughly shard.</p><p>
 
 Now when the world with sinne gan to abound,<br>
 <i>Astraea</i> loathing lenger here to space<br>
 Mongst wicked men, in whom no truth she found,<br>
 Return'd to heauen, whence she deriu'd her race;<br>
 Where she hath now an euerlasting place,<br>
 Mongst those twelue signes, which nightly we doe see<br>
 The heauens bright-shining baudricke to enchace;<br>
 And is the <i>Virgin</i>, sixt in her degree,<br>
 And next her selfe her righteous ballance hanging bee.</p><p>
 
 But when she parted hence, she left her groome<br>
 An yron man, which did on her attend<br>
 Alwayes, to execute her stedfast doome,<br>
 And willed him with <i>Artegall</i> to wend,<br>
 And doe what euer thing he did intend.<br>
 His name was <i>Talus</i>, made of yron mould,<br>
 Immoueable, resistlesse, without end.<br>
 Who in his hand an yron flale did hould,<br>
 With which he thresht out falshood, and did truth vnfould.</p><p>
 
 He now went with him in this new inquest,<br>
 Him for to aide, if aide he chaunst to neede,<br>
 Against that cruell Tyrant, which opprest<br>
 The faire <i>Irena</i> with his foule misdeede,<br>
 And kept the crowne in which she should succeed.<br>
 And now together on their way they bin,<br>
 When as they saw a Squire in squallid weed,<br>
 Lamenting sore his sorowfull sad tyne,<br>
 With many bitter teares shed from his blubbred eyne.</p><p>
 
 To whom as they approched, they espide<br>
 A sorie sight, as euer seene with eye;<br>
 An headlesse Ladie lying him beside,<br>
 In her owne blood all wallow'd wofully,<br>
 That her gay clothes did in discolour die.<br>
 Much was he moued at that ruefull sight;<br>
 And flam'd with zeale of vengeance inwardly,<br>
 He askt, who had that Dame so fouly dight;<br>
 Or whether his owne hand, or whether other wight?</p><p>
 
 Ah woe is me, and well away (quoth hee)<br>
 Bursting forth teares, like springs out of a banke,<br>
 That euer I this dismall day did see:<br>
 Full farre was I from thinking such a pranke;<br>
 Yet litle losse it were, and mickle thanke,<br>
 If I should graunt that I haue doen the same,<br>
 That I mote drinke the cup, whereof she dranke:<br>
 But that I should die guiltie of the blame,<br>
 The which another did, who now is fled with shame.</p><p>
 
 Who was it then (sayd <i>Artegall</i>) that wrought?<br>
 And why? doe it declare vnto me trew.<br>
 A knight (said he) if knight he may be thought,<br>
 That did his hand in Ladies bloud embrew,<br>
 And for no cause, but as I shall you shew.<br>
 This day as I in solace sate hereby<br>
 With a fayre loue, whose losse I now do rew,<br>
 There came this knight, hauing in companie<br>
 This lucklesse Ladie, which now here doth headlesse lie.</p><p>
 
 He, whether mine seem'd fayrer in his eye,<br>
 Or that he wexed weary of his owne,<br>
 Would change with me; but I did it denye;<br>
 So did the Ladies both, as may be knowne,<br>
 But he, whose spirit was with pride vpblowne,<br>
 Would not so rest contented with his right,<br>
 But hauing from his courser her downe throwne,<br>
 Fro me reft mine away by lawlesse might,<br>
 And on his steed her set, to beare her out of sight.</p><p>
 
 Which when his Ladie saw, she follow'd fast,<br>
 And on him catching hold, gan loud to crie<br>
 Not so to leaue her, nor away to cast,<br>
 But rather of his hand besought to die.<br>
 With that his sword he drew all wrathfully,<br>
 And at one stroke cropt off her head with scorne,<br>
 In that same place, whereas it now doth lie.<br>
 So he my loue away with him hath borne,<br>
 And left me here, both his &amp; mine owne loue to morne.</p><p>
 
 Aread (sayd he) which way then did he make?<br>
 And by what markes may he be knowne againe?<br>
 To hope (quoth he) him soone to ouertake,<br>
 That hence so long departed, is but vaine:<br>
 But yet he pricked ouer yonder plaine,<br>
 And as I marked, bore vpon his shield,<br>
 By which it's easie him to know againe,<br>
 A broken sword within a bloodie field;<br>
 Expressing well his nature, which the same did wield.</p><p>
 
 No sooner sayd, but streight he after sent<br>
 His yron page, who him pursew'd so light,<br>
 As that it seem'd aboue the ground he went:<br>
 For he was swift as swallow in her flight,<br>
 And strong as Lyon in his Lordly might.<br>
 It was not long, before he ouertooke<br>
 Sir <i>Sanglier</i>; (so cleeped was that Knight)<br>
 Whom at the first he ghessed by his looke,<br>
 And by the other markes, which of his shield he tooke.</p><p>
 
 He bad him stay, and backe with him retire;<br>
 Who full of scorne to be commaunded so,<br>
 The Lady to alight did eft require,<br>
 Whilest he reformed that vnciuill fo:<br>
 And streight at him with all his force did go.<br>
 Who mou'd no more therewith, then when a rocke<br>
 Is lightly stricken with some stones throw;<br>
 But tlo him leaping, len him such a knocke,<br>
 That on the ground he layd him like a sencelesse blocke.</p><p>
 
 But ere he could him selfe recure againe,<br>
 Him in his iron paw he seized had;<br>
 That when he wak't out of his warelesse paine,<br>
 He found him selfe, vnwist, so ill bestad,<br>
 That lim he could not wag.  Thence he him lad,<br>
 Bound like a beast appointed to the stall:<br>
 The sight whereof the Lady sore adrad,<br>
 And fain'd to fly for feare of being thrall;<br>
 But he her quickly stayd, and forst to wend withall.</p><p>
 
 When to the place they came, where <i>Artegall</i><br>
 By that same carefull Squire did then abide,<br>
 He gently gan him to demaund of all,<br>
 That did betwixt him and that Squire betide.<br>
 Who with sterne countenance and indignant pride<br>
 Did aunswere, that of all he guiltlesse stood,<br>
 And his accuser thereuppon defide:<br>
 For neither he did shed that Ladies bloud,<br>
 Nor tooke away his loue, but his owne proper good.</p><p>
 
 Well did the Squire perceiue him selfe too weake,<br>
 To aunswere his defiaunce in the field,<br>
 And rather chose his challenge off to breake,<br>
 Then to approue his right with speare and shield.<br>
 And rather guilty chose him selfe to yield.<br>
 But <i>Artegall</i> by signes perceiuing plaine,<br>
 That he it was not, which that Lady kild,<br>
 But that strange Knight, the fairer loue to gaine,<br>
 Did cast about by sleight the truth thereout to straine.</p><p>
 
 And sayd, Now sure this doubtfull causes right<br>
 Can hardly but by Sacrament be tride,<br>
 Or else by ordele, or by blooddy fight;<br>
 That ill perhaps mote fall to either side.<br>
 But if ye please, that I your cause decide,<br>
 Perhaps I may all further quarrell end,<br>
 So ye will sweare my iudgement to abide.<br>
 Thereto they both did franckly condiscend,<br>
 And to his doome with listfull eares did both attend.</p><p>
 
 Sith then (sayd he) ye both the dead deny,<br>
 And both the liuing Lady claime your right,<br>
 Let both the dead and liuing equally<br>
 Deuided be betwixt you here in sight,<br>
 And each of either take his share aright.<br>
 But looke who does dissent from this my read,<br>
 He for a twelue moneths day shall in despight<br>
 Beare for his penaunce that same Ladies head;<br>
 To witnesse to the world, that she by him is dead.</p><p>
 
 Well pleased with that doome was <i>Sangliere</i>,<br>
 And offred streight the Lady to be slaine.<br>
 But that same Squire, to whom she was more dere,<br>
 When as he saw she should be cut in twaine,<br>
 Did yield, she rather should with him remaine<br>
 Aliue, then to him selfe be shared dead;<br>
 And rather then his loue should suffer paine,<br>
 He chose with shame to beare that Ladies head<br>
 True loue despiseth shame, when life is cald in dread.</p><p>
 
 Whom when so willing <i>Artegall</i> perceaued;<br>
 Not so thou Squire, (he sayd) but thine I deeme<br>
 The liuing Lady, which from thee he reaued:<br>
 For worthy thou of her doest rightly seeme.<br>
 And you, Sir Knight, that loue so light esteeme,<br>
 As that ye would for little leaue the same,<br>
 Take here your owne, that doth you best beseeme,<br>
 And with it beare the burden of defame;<br>
 Your owne dead Ladies head, to tell abrode your shame.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Sangliere</i> disdained much his doome,<br>
 And sternly gan repine at his beheast;<br>
 Ne would for ought obay, as did become,<br>
 To beare that Ladies head before his breast.<br>
 Vntill that <i>Talus</i> had his pride represt,<br>
 And forced him, maulgre, it vp to reare.<br>
 Who when he saw it bootelesse to resist,<br>
 He tooke it vp, and thence with him did beare,<br>
 As rated Spaniell takes his burden vp for feare.</p><p>
 
 Much did that Squire Sir <i>Artegall</i> adore,<br>
 For his great iustice, held in high regard;<br>
 And as his Squire him offred euermore<br>
 To serue, for want of other meete reward,<br>
 And wend with him on his aduenture hard.<br>
 But he thereto would by no meanes consent;<br>
 But leauing him forth on his iourney far'd:<br>
 Ne wight with him but onely <i>Talus</i> went.<br>
 They two enough t'encounter an whole Regiment.</p><p>
