 </p><blockquote>
 <i>The gentle Squire recouers grace,<br>
 Sclaunder her guests doth staine:<br>
 Corflambo chaseth Placidas,<br>
 And is by Arthure slaine.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 W
 Ell said the wiseman, now prou'd true by this,<br>
 Which to this gentle Squire did happen late.<br>
 That the displeasure of the mighty is<br>
 Then death it selfe more dread and desperate.<br>
 For naught the same may calme ne mitigate,<br>
 Till time the tempest doe thereof delay<br>
 With sufferaunce soft, which rigour can abate,<br>
 And haue the sterne remembrance wypt away<br>
 Of bitter thoughts, which deepe therein infixed lay.<p>
 
 Like as it fell to this vnhappy boy,<br>
 Whose tender heart the faire <i>Belphebe</i> had,<br>
 With one sterne looke so daunted, that no ioy<br>
 In all his life, which afterwards he lad,<br>
 He euer tasted, but with penaunce sad<br>
 And pensiue sorrow pind and wore away,<br>
 Ne euer laught, ne once shew'd countenance glad;<br>
 But alwaies wept and wailed night and day,<br>
 As blasted bloosme through heat doth languish &amp; decay;</p><p>
 
 Till on a day, as in his wonted wise<br>
 His doole he made, there chaunst a turtle Doue<br>
 To come, where he his dolors did deuise,<br>
 That likewise late had lost her dearest loue;<br>
 Which losse her made like passion also proue.<br>
 Who seeing his sad plight, her tender heart<br>
 With deare compassion deeply did emmoue,<br>
 That she gan mone his vndeserued smart,<br>
 And with her dolefull accent beare with him apart.</p><p>
 
 Shee sitting by him as on ground he lay,<br>
 Her mournefull notes full piteously did frame,<br>
 And thereof made a lamentable lay,<br>
 So sensibly compyld, that in the same<br>
 Him seemed oft he heard his owne right name.<br>
 With that he forth would poure so plenteous teares,<br>
 And beat his breast vnworthy of such blame,<br>
 And knocke his head, and rend his rugged heares,<br>
 That could haue perst the hearts of Tigres &amp; of Beares.</p><p>
 
 Thus long this gentle bird to him did vse,<br>
 Withouten dread of perill to repaire<br>
 Vnto his wonne, and with her mournefull muse<br>
 Him to recomfort in his greatest care,<br>
 That much did ease his mourning and misfare:<br>
 And euery day for guerdon of her song,<br>
 He part of his small feast to her would share;<br>
 That at the last of all his woe and wrong<br>
 Companion she became, and so continued long.</p><p>
 
 Vpon a day as she him sate beside,<br>
 By chance he certaine miniments forth drew,<br>
 Which yet with him as relickes did abide<br>
 Of all the bounty, which <i>Belphebe</i> threw<br>
 On him, whilst goodly grace she did him shew:<br>
 Amongst the rest a iewell rich he found,<br>
 That was a Ruby of right perfect hew,<br>
 Shap'd like a heart, yet bleeding of the wound,<br>
 And with a litle golden chaine about it bound.</p><p>
 
 The same he tooke, and with a riband new,<br>
 In which his Ladies colours were, did bind<br>
 About the turtles necke, that with the vew<br>
 Did greatly solace his engrieued mind.<br>
 All vnawares the bird, when she did find<br>
 Her selfe so deckt, her nimble wings displaid,<br>
 And flew away, as lightly as the wind:<br>
 Which sodaine accident him much dismaid,<br>
 And looking after long, did marke which way she straid.</p><p>
 
 But when as long he looked had in vaine,<br>
 Yet saw her forward still to make her flight,<br>
 His weary eie returnd to him againe,<br>
 Full of discomfort and disquiet plight,<br>
 That both his iuell he had lost so light,<br>
 And eke his deare companion of his care.<br>
 But that sweet bird departing, flew forth right<br>
 Through the wide region of the wastfull aire,<br>
 Vntill she came where wonned his <i>Belphebe</i> faire.</p><p>
 
 There found she her (as then it did betide)<br>
 Sitting in couert shade of arbors sweet,<br>
 After late weary toile, which she had tride<br>
 In saluage chase, to rest as seem'd her meet.<br>
 There she alighting, fell before her feet,<br>
 And gan to her her mournfull plaint to make,<br>
 As was her wont, thinking to let her weet<br>
 The great tormenting griefe, that for her sake<br>
 Her gentle Squire through her displeasure did pertake.</p><p>
 
 She her beholding with attentiue eye,<br>
 At length did marke about her purple brest<br>
 That precious iuell, which she formerly<br>
 Had knowne right well with colourd ribbands drest:<br>
 Therewith she rose in hast, and her addrest<br>
 With ready hand it to haue reft away.<br>
 But the swift bird obayd not her behest,<br>
 But swaru'd aside, and there againe did stay;<br>
 She follow'd her, and thought againe it to assay.</p><p>
 
 And euer when she nigh approcht, the Doue<br>
 Would flit a litle forward, and then stay,<br>
 Till she drew neare, and then againe remoue;<br>
 So tempting her still to pursue the pray,<br>
 And still from her escaping soft away:<br>
 Till that at length into that forrest wide,<br>
 She drew her far, and led with slow delay.<br>
 In th'end she her vnto that place did guide,<br>
 Whereas that wofull man in languor did abide.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones she flew vnto his fearelesse hand,<br>
 And there a piteous ditty new deuiz'd,<br>
 As if she would haue made him vnderstand,<br>
 His sorrowes cause to be of her despis'd.<br>
 Whom when she saw in wretched weedes disguiz'd,<br>
 With heary glib deform'd, and meiger face,<br>
 Like ghost late risen from his graue agryz'd,<br>
 She knew him not, but pittied much his case,<br>
 And wisht it were in her to doe him any grace.</p><p>
 
 He her beholding, at her feet downe fell,<br>
 And kist the ground on which her sole did tread,<br>
 And washt the same with water, which did well<br>
 From his moist eies, and like two streames procead;<br>
 Yet spake no word, whereby she might aread<br>
 What mister wight he was, or what he ment:<br>
 But as one daunted with her presence dread,<br>
 Onely few ruefull lookes vnto her sent,<br>
 As messengers of his true meaning and intent.</p><p>
 
 Yet nathemore his meaning she ared,<br>
 But wondred much at his so selcouth case,<br>
 And by his persons secret seemlyhed<br>
 Well weend, that he had beene some man of place,<br>
 Before misfortune did his hew deface:<br>
 That being mou'd with ruth she thus bespake.<br>
 Ah wofull man, what heauens hard disgrace,<br>
 Or wrath of cruell wight on thee ywrake?<br>
 Or selfe disliked life doth thee thus wretched make?</p><p>
 
 If heauen, then none may it redresse or blame,<br>
 Sith to his powre we all are subiect borne:<br>
 If wrathfull wight, then fowle rebuke and shame<br>
 Be theirs, that haue so cruell thee forlorne;<br>
 But if through inward griefe or wilfull scorne<br>
 Of life it be, then better doe aduise.<br>
 For he whose daies in wilfull woe are worne,<br>
 The grace of his Creator doth despise,<br>
 That will not vse his gifts for thanklesse nigardise.</p><p>
 
 When so he heard her say, eftsoones he brake<br>
 His sodaine silence, which he long had pent,<br>
 And sighing inly deepe, her thus bespake;<br>
 Then haue they all themselues against me bent:<br>
 For heauen, first author of my languishment,<br>
 Enuying my too great felicity,<br>
 Did closely with a cruell one consent,<br>
 To cloud my daies in dolefull misery,<br>
 And make me loath this life, still longing for to die.</p><p>
 
 Ne any but your selfe, O dearest dred,<br>
 Hath done this wrong, to wreake on worthlesse wight<br>
 Your high displesure, through misdeeming bred:<br>
 That when your pleasure is to deeme aright,<br>
 Ye may redresse, and me restore to light.<br>
 Which sory words her mightie hart did mate<br>
 With mild regard, to see his ruefull plight,<br>
 That her inburning wrath she gan abate,<br>
 And him receiu'd againe to former fauours state.</p><p>
 
 In which he long time afterwards did lead<br>
 An happie life with grace and good accord,<br>
 Fearlesse of fortunes chaunge or enuies dread,<br>
 And eke all mindlesse of his owne deare Lord<br>
 The noble Prince, who neuer heard one word<br>
 Of tydings, what did vnto him betide,<br>
 Or what good fortune did to him afford,<br>
 But through the endlesse world did wander wide,<br>
 Him seeking euermore, yet no where him descride.</p><p>
 
 Till on a day as through that wood he rode,<br>
 He chaunst to come where those two Ladies late,<br>
 <i>AEmylia</i> and <i>Amoret</i> abode,<br>
 Both in full sad and sorrowfull estate;<br>
 The one right feeble through the euill rate<br>
 Of food, which in her duresse she had found:<br>
 The other almost dead and desperate<br>
 Through her late hurts, and through that haplesse wound,<br>
 With which the Squire in her defence her sore astound.</p><p>
 
 Whom when the Prince beheld, he gan to rew<br>
 The euill case in which those Ladies lay;<br>
 But most was moued at the piteous vew<br>
 Of <i>Amoret</i>, so neare vnto decay,<br>
 That her great daunger did him much dismay.<br>
 Eftsoones that pretious liquour forth he drew,<br>
 Which he in store about him kept alway,<br>
 And with few drops thereof did softly dew<br>
 Her wounds, that vnto strength restor'd her soone anew.</p><p>
 
 Tho when they both recouered were right well,<br>
 He gan of them inquire, what euill guide<br>
 Them thether brought, and how their harmes befell.<br>
 To whom they told all, that did them betide,<br>
 And how from thraldome vile they were vntide<br>
 Of that same wicked Carle, by Virgins hond;<br>
 Whose bloudie corse they shew'd him there beside,<br>
 And eke his caue, in which they both were bond:<br>
 At which he wondred much, when all those signes he fond.</p><p>
 
 And euermore he greatly did desire<br>
 To know, what Virgin did them thence vnbind;<br>
 And oft of them did earnestly inquire,<br>
 Where was her won, and how he mote her find.<br>
 But when as nought according to his mind<br>
 He could outlearne, he them from ground did reare:<br>
 No seruice lothsome to a gentle kind;<br>
 And on his warlike beast them both did beare,<br>
 Himselfe by them on foot, to succour them from feare.</p><p>
 
 So when that forrest they had passed well,<br>
 A litle cotage farre away they spide,<br>
 To which they drew, ere night vpon them fell;<br>
 And entring in, found none therein abide,<br>
 But one old woman sitting there beside,<br>
 Vpon the ground in ragged rude attyre,<br>
 With filthy lockes about her scattered wide,<br>
 Gnawing her nayles for felnesse and for yre,<br>
 And there out sucking venime to her parts entyre.</p><p>
 
 A foule and loathly creature sure in sight,<br>
 And in conditions to be loath'd no lesse:<br>
 For she was stuft with rancour and despight<br>
 Vp to the throat, that oft with bitternesse<br>
 It forth would breake, and gush in great excesse,<br>
 Pouring out streames of poyson and of gall<br>
 Gainst all, that truth or vertue doe professe,<br>
 Whom she with leasings lewdly did miscall,<br>
 And wickedly backbite: Her name men <i>Sclaunder</i> call.</p><p>
 
 Her nature is all goodnesse to abuse,<br>
 And causelesse crimes continually to frame,<br>
 With which she guiltlesse persons may accuse,<br>
 And steale away the crowne of their good name;<br>
 Ne euer Knight so bold, ne euer Dame<br>
 So chast and loyall liu'd, but she would striue<br>
 With forged cause them falsely to defame;<br>
 Ne euer thing so well was doen aliue,<br>
 But she with blame would blot, &amp; of due praise depriue.</p><p>
 
 Her words were not, as common words are ment,<br>
 T'expresse the meaning of the inward mind,<br>
 But noysome breath, and poysnous spirit sent<br>
 From inward parts, with cancred malice lind,<br>
 And breathed forth with blast of bitter wind;<br>
 Which passing through the eares, would pierce the hart,<br>
 And wound the soule it selfe with griefe vnkind:<br>
 For like the stings of Aspes, that kill with smart,<br>
 Her spightfull words did pricke, &amp; wound the inner part.</p><p>
 
 Such was that Hag, vnmeet to host such guests,<br>
 Whom greatest Princes court would welcome fayne;<br>
 But neede, that answers not to all requests,<br>
 Bad them not looke for better entertayne;<br>
 And eke that age despysed nicenesse vaine,<br>
 Enur'd to hardnesse and to homely fare,<br>
 Which them to warlike discipline did trayne,<br>
 And manly limbs endur'd with little care<br>
 Against all hard mishaps and fortunelesse misfare.</p><p>
 
 Then all that euening welcommed with cold,<br>
 And chearelesse hunger, they together spent;<br>
 Yet found no fault, but that the Hag did scold<br>
 And rayle at them with grudgefull discontent,<br>
 For lodging there without her owne consent:<br>
 Yet they endured all with patience milde,<br>
 And vnto rest themselues all onely lent,<br>
 Regardlesse of that queane so base and vilde,<br>
 To be vniustly blamd, and bitterly reuilde.</p><p>
 
 Here well I weene, when as these rimes be red<br>
 With misregard, that some rash witted wight,<br>
 Whose looser thought will lightly be misled,<br>
 These gentle Ladies will misdeeme too light,<br>
 For thus conuersing with this noble Knight;<br>
 Sith now of dayes such temperance is rare<br>
 And hard to finde, that heat of youthfull spright<br>
 For ought will from his greedie pleasure spare:<br>
 More hard for hungry steed t'abstaine from pleasant lare.</p><p>
 
 But antique age yet in the infancie<br>
 Of time, did liue then like an innocent,<br>
 In simple truth and blamelesse chastitie,<br>
 Ne then of guile had made experiment,<br>
 But voide of vile and treacherous intent,<br>
 Held vertue for it selfe in soueraine awe:<br>
 Then loyall loue had royall regiment,<br>
 And each vnto his lust did make a lawe,<br>
 From all forbidden things his liking to withdraw.</p><p>
 
 The Lyon there did with the Lambe consort,<br>
 And eke the Doue sate by the Faulcons side,<br>
 Ne each of other feared fraud or tort,<br>
 But did in safe securitie abide,<br>
 Withouten perill of the stronger pride:<br>
 But when the world woxe old, it woxe warre old<br>
 (Whereof it hight) and hauing shortly tride<br>
 The traines of wit, in wickednesse woxe bold,<br>
 And dared of all sinnes the secrets to vnfold.</p><p>
 
 Then beautie, which was made to represent<br>
 The great Creatours owne resemblance bright,<br>
 Vnto abuse of lawlesse lust was lent,<br>
 And made the baite of bestiall delight:<br>
 Then faire grew foule, and foule grew faire in sight,<br>
 And that which wont to vanquish God and man,<br>
 Was made the vassall of the victors might;<br>
 Then did her glorious flowre wex dead and wan,<br>
 Despisd and troden downe of all that ouerran.</p><p>
 
 And now it is so vtterly decayd,<br>
 That any bud thereof doth scarse remaine,<br>
 But if few plants preseru'd through heauenly ayd,<br>
 In Princes Court doe hap to sprout againe,<br>
 Dew'd with her drops of bountie Soueraine,<br>
 Which from that goodly glorious flowre proceed,<br>
 Sprung of the auncient stocke of Princes straine,<br>
 Now th'onely remnant of that royall breed,<br>
 Whose noble kind at first was sure of heauenly seed.</p><p>
 
 Tho soone as day discouered heauens face<br>
 To sinfull men with darknes ouerdight,<br>
 This gentle crew gan from their eye-lids chace<br>
 The drowzie humour of the dampish night,<br>
 And did themselues vnto their iourney dight.<br>
 So forth they yode, and forward softly paced,<br>
 That them to view had bene an vncouth sight;<br>
 How all the way the Prince on footpace traced,<br>
 The Ladies both on horse, together fast embraced.</p><p>
 
 Soone as they thence departed were afore,<br>
 That shamefull Hag, the slaunder of her sexe,<br>
 Them follow'd fast, and them reuiled sore,<br>
 Him calling theefe, them whores; that much did vexe<br>
 His noble hart; thereto she did annexe<br>
 False crimes and facts, such as they neuer ment,<br>
 That those two Ladies much asham'd did wexe:<br>
 The more did she pursue her lewd intent,<br>
 And rayl'd and rag'd, till she had all her poyson spent.</p><p>
 
 At last when they were passed out of sight,<br>
 Yet she did not her spightfull speach forbeare,<br>
 But after them did barke, and still backbite,<br>
 Though there were none her hatefull words to heare:<br>
 Like as a curre doth felly bite and teare<br>
 The stone, which passed straunger at him threw;<br>
 So she them seeing past the reach of eare,<br>
 Against the stones and trees did rayle anew,<br>
 Till she had duld the sting, which in her tongs end grew.</p><p>
 
 They passing forth kept on their readie way,<br>
 With easie steps so soft as foot could stryde.<br>
 Both for great feeblesse, which did oft assay<br>
 Faire <i>Amoret</i>, that scarcely she could ryde;<br>
 And eke through heauie armes, which sore annoyd<br>
 The Prince on foot, not wonted so to fare;<br>
 Whose steadie hand was faine his steede to guyde,<br>
 And all the way from trotting hard to spare,<br>
 So was his toyle the more, the more that was his care.</p><p>
 
 At length they spide, where towards them with speed<br>
 A Squire came gallopping, as he would flie;<br>
 Bearing a litle Dwarfe before his steed,<br>
 That all the way full loud for aide did crie,<br>
 That seem'd his shrikes would rend the brasen skie:<br>
 Whom after did a mightie man pursew,<br>
 Ryding vpon a Dromedare on hie,<br>
 Of stature huge, and horrible of hew,<br>
 That would haue maz'd a man his dreadfull face to vew.</p><p>
 
 For from his fearefull eyes two fierie beames,<br>
 More sharpe then points of needles did proceede,<br>
 Shooting forth farre away two flaming streames,<br>
 Full of sad powre, that poysonous bale did breede<br>
 To all, that on him lookt without good heed,<br>
 And secretly his enemies did slay:<br>
 Like as the Basiliske of serpents seede,<br>
 From powrefull eyes close venim doth conuay<br>
 Into the lookers hart, and killeth farre away.</p><p>
 
 He all the way did rage at that same Squire,<br>
 And after him full many threatnings threw,<br>
 With curses vaine in his auengefull ire:<br>
 But none of them (so fast away he flew)<br>
 Him ouertooke, before he came in vew.<br>
 Where when he saw the Prince in armour bright,<br>
 He cald to him aloud, his case to rew,<br>
 And rescue him through succour of his might,<br>
 From that his cruell foe, that him pursewd in sight.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones the Prince tooke downe those Ladies twaine<br>
 From loftie steede, and mounting in their stead<br>
 Came to that Squire, yet trembling euery vaine:<br>
 Of whom he gan enquire his cause of dread;<br>
 Who as he gan the same to him aread,<br>
 Loe hard behind his backe his foe was prest,<br>
 With dreadfull weapon aymed at his head;<br>
 That vnto death had doen him vnredrest,<br>
 Had not the noble Prince his readie stroke represt.</p><p>
 
 Who thrusting boldly twixt him and the blow,<br>
 The burden of the deadly brunt did beare<br>
 Vpon his shield, which lightly he did throw<br>
 Ouer his head, before the harme came neare.<br>
 Nathlesse it fell with so despiteous dreare<br>
 And heauie sway, that hard vnto his crowne<br>
 The shield it droue, and did the couering reare:<br>
 Therewith both Squire and dwarfe did tomble downe<br>
 Vnto the earth, and lay long while in senselesse swowne.</p><p>
 
 Whereat the Prince full wrath, his strong right hand<br>
 In full auengement heaued vp on hie,<br>
 And stroke the Pagan with his steely brand<br>
 So sore, that to his saddle bow thereby<br>
 He bowed low, and so a while did lie:<br>
 And sure had not his massie yron mace<br>
 Betwixt him and his hurt bene happily,<br>
 It would haue cleft him to the girding place,<br>
 Yet as it was, it did astonish him long space.</p><p>
 
 But when he to himselfe returnd againe,<br>
 All full of rage he gan to curse and sweare,<br>
 And vow by <i>Mahoune</i> that he should be slaine.<br>
 With that his murdrous mace he vp did reare,<br>
 That seemed nought the souse thereof could beare,<br>
 And therewith smote at him with all his might.<br>
 But ere that it to him approched neare,<br>
 The royall child with readie quicke foresight,<br>
 Did shun the proofe thereof and it auoyded light.</p><p>
 
 But ere his hand he could recure againe,<br>
 To ward his bodie from the balefull stound,<br>
 He smote at him with all his might and maine,<br>
 So furiously, that ere he wist, he found<br>
 His head before him tombling on the ground.<br>
 The whiles his babling tongue did yet blaspheme<br>
 And curse his God, that did him so confound;<br>
 The whiles his life ran foorth in bloudie streame,<br>
 His soule descended downe into the Stygian reame.</p><p>
 
 Which when that Squire beheld, he woxe full glad<br>
 To see his foe breath out his spright in vaine:<br>
 But that same dwarfe right sorie seem'd and sad,<br>
 And howld aloud to see his Lord there slaine,<br>
 And rent his haire and scratcht his face for paine.<br>
 Then gan the Prince at leasure to inquire<br>
 Of all the accident, there hapned plaine,<br>
 And what he was, whose eyes did flame with fire;<br>
 All which was thus to him declared by that Squire.</p><p>
 
 This mightie man (quoth he) whom you haue slaine,<br>
 Of an huge Geauntesse whylome was bred;<br>
 And by his strength rule to himselfe did gaine<br>
 Of many Nations into thraldome led,<br>
 And mightie kingdomes of his force adred;<br>
 Whom yet he conquer'd not by bloudie fight,<br>
 Ne hostes of men with banners brode dispred,<br>
 But by the powre of his infectious sight,<br>
 With which he killed all, that came within his might.</p><p>
 
 Ne was he euer vanquished afore,<br>
 But euer vanquisht all, with whom he fought;<br>
 Ne was there man so strong, but he downe bore,<br>
 Ne woman yet so faire, but he her brought<br>
 Vnto his bay, and captiued her thought.<br>
 For most of strength and beautie his desire<br>
 Was spoyle to make, and wast them vnto nought,<br>
 By casting secret flakes of lustfull fire<br>
 From his false eyes, into their harts and parts entire.</p><p>
 
 Therefore <i>Corflambo</i> was he cald aright,<br>
 Though namelesse there his bodie now doth lie,<br>
 Yet hath he left one daughter that is hight<br>
 The faire <i>Poeana</i>; who seemes outwardly<br>
 So faire, as euer yet saw liuing eie:<br>
 And were her vertue like her beautie bright,<br>
 She were as faire as any vnder skie.<br>
 But ah she giuen is to vaine delight,<br>
 And eke too loose of life, and eke of loue too light.</p><p>
 
 So as it fell there was a gentle Squire,<br>
 That lou'd a Ladie of high parentage;<br>
 But for his meane degree might not aspire<br>
 To match so high, her friends with counsell sage,<br>
 Dissuaded her from such a disparage.<br>
 But she, whose hart to loue was wholly lent,<br>
 Out of his hands could not redeeme her gage,<br>
 But firmely following her first intent,<br>
 Resolu'd with him to wend, gainst all her friends consent.</p><p>
 
 So twixt themselues they pointed time and place,<br>
 To which when he according did repaire,<br>
 An hard mishap and disauentrous case<br>
 Him chaunst; in stead of his <i>Æmylia</i> faire<br>
 This Gyants sonne, that lies there on the laire<br>
 An headlesse heape, him vnawares there caught,<br>
 And all dismayd through mercilesse despaire,<br>
 Him wretched thrall vnto his dongeon brought,<br>
 Where he remaines, of all vnsuccour'd and vnsought.</p><p>
 
 This Gyants daughter came vpon a day<br>
 Vnto the prison in her ioyous glee,<br>
 To view the thrals, which there in bondage lay:<br>
 Amongst the rest she chaunced there to see<br>
 This louely swaine the Squire of low degree;<br>
 To whom she did her liking lightly cast,<br>
 And wooed him her paramour to bee:<br>
 From day to day she woo'd and prayd him fast,<br>
 And for his loue him promist libertie at last.</p><p>
 
 He though affide vnto a former loue,<br>
 To whom his faith he firmely ment to hold,<br>
 Yet seeing not how thence he mote remoue,<br>
 But by that meanes, which fortune did vnfold,<br>
 Her graunted loue, but with affection cold<br>
 To win her grace his libertie to get.<br>
 Yet she him still detaines in captiue hold<br>
 Fearing least if she should him freely set,<br>
 He would her shortly leaue, and former loue forget.</p><p>
 
 Yet so much fauour she to him hath hight,<br>
 Aboue the rest, that he sometimes may space<br>
 And walke about her gardens of delight,<br>
 Hauing a keeper still with him in place;<br>
 Which keeper is this Dwarfe, her dearling base,<br>
 To whom the keyes of euery prison dore<br>
 By her committed be, of speciall grace,<br>
 And at his will may whom he list restore,<br>
 And whom he list reserue, to be afflicted more.</p><p>
 
 Whereof when tydings came vnto mine eare,<br>
 Full inly sorie for the feruent zeale,<br>
 Which I to him as to my soule did beare;<br>
 I thether went where I did long conceale<br>
 My selfe, till that the Dwarfe did me reueale,<br>
 And told his Dame, her Squire of low degree<br>
 Did secretly out of her prison steale;<br>
 For me he did mistake that Squire to be;<br>
 For neuer two so like did liuing creature see.</p><p>
 
 Then was I taken and before her brought:<br>
 Who through the likenesse of my outward hew,<br>
 Being likewise beguiled in her thought,<br>
 Gan blame me much for being so vntrew,<br>
 To seeke by flight her fellowship t'eschew,<br>
 That lou'd me deare, as dearest thing aliue.<br>
 Thence she commaunded me to prison new;<br>
 Whereof I glad did not gainesay nor striue,<br>
 But suffred that same Dwarfe me to her dongeon driue.</p><p>
 
 There did I finde mine onely faithfull frend<br>
 In heauy plight and sad perplexitie;<br>
 Whereof I sorie, yet my selfe did bend,<br>
 Him to recomfort with my companie.<br>
 But him the more agreeu'd I found thereby:<br>
 For all his ioy, he said, in that distresse<br>
 Was mine and his <i>Æmylias</i> libertie.<br>
 <i>Æmylia</i> well he lou'd, as I mote ghesse;<br>
 Yet greater loue to me then her he did professe.</p><p>
 
 But I with better reason him auiz'd,<br>
 And shew'd him how through error and mis-thought<br>
 Of our like persons eath to be disguiz'd,<br>
 Or his exchange, or freedome might be wrought.<br>
 Whereto full loth was he, ne would for ought<br>
 Consent, that I who stood all fearelesse free,<br>
 Should wilfully be into thraldome brought,<br>
 Till fortune did perforce it so decree.<br>
 Yet ouerrul'd at last, he did to me agree.</p><p>
 
 The morrow next about the wonted howre,<br>
 The Dwarfe cald at the doore of <i>Amyas</i>,<br>
 To come forthwith vnto his Ladies bowre.<br>
 In steed of whom forth came I <i>Placidas</i>,<br>
 And vndiscerned, forth with him did pas.<br>
 There with great ioyance and with gladsome glee,<br>
 Of faire <i>Poeana</i> I receiued was,<br>
 And oft imbrast, as if that I were hee,<br>
 And with kind words accoyd, vowing great loue to mee.</p><p>
 
 Which I, that was not bent to former loue,<br>
 As was my friend, that had her long refusd,<br>
 Did well accept, as well it did behoue,<br>
 And to the present neede it wisely vsd.<br>
 My former hardnesse first I faire excusd;<br>
 And after promist large amends to make.<br>
 With such smooth termes her error I abusd,<br>
 To my friends good, more then for mine owne sake,<br>
 For whose sole libertie I loue and life did stake.</p><p>
 
 Thenceforth I found more fauour at her hand,<br>
 That to her Dwarfe, which had me in his charge,<br>
 She bad to lighten my too heauie band,<br>
 And graunt more scope to me to walke at large.<br>
 So on a day as by the flowrie marge<br>
 Of a fresh streame I with that Elfe did play,<br>
 Finding no meanes how I might vs enlarge,<br>
 But if that Dwarfe I could with me conuay,<br>
 I lightly snatcht him vp, and with me bore away.</p><p>
 
 Thereat he shriekt aloud, that with his cry<br>
 The Tyrant selfe came forth with yelling bray,<br>
 And me pursew'd; but nathemore would I<br>
 Forgoe the purchase of my gotten pray,<br>
 But haue perforce him hether brought away.<br>
 Thus as they talked, loe where nigh at hand<br>
 Those Ladies two yet doubtfull through dismay<br>
 In presence came, desirous t'vnderstand<br>
 Tydings of all, which there had hapned on the land.</p><p>
 
 Where soone as sad <i>Æmylia</i> did espie<br>
 Her captiue louers friend, young <i>Placidas</i>:<br>
 All mindlesse of her wonted modestie,<br>
 She to him ran, and him with streight embras<br>
 Enfolding said, And liues yet <i>Amyas</i>?<br>
 He liues (quoth he) and his <i>Æmylia</i> loues.<br>
 Then lesse (said she) by all the woe I pas,<br>
 With which my weaker patience fortune proues.<br>
 But what mishap thus long him fro my selfe remoues?</p><p>
 
 Then gan he all this storie to renew,<br>
 And tell the course of his captiuitie;<br>
 That her deare hart full deepely made to rew,<br>
 And sigh full sore, to heare the miserie,<br>
 In which so long he mercilesse did lie.<br>
 Then after many teares and sorrowes spent,<br>
 She deare besought the Prince of remedie:<br>
 Who thereto did with readie will consent,<br>
 And well perform'd, as shall appeare by his euent.</p><p>
