 <i>The house of Temperance, in which<br>
 doth sober Alma dwell,<br>

 knightes to flight compell.</i><p>

 O
 F all Gods workes, which do this world adorne,<br>
 There is no one more faire and excellent,<br>
 Then is mans body both for powre and forme,<br>
 Whiles it is kept in sober gouernment;<br>
 But none then it, more fowle and indecent,<br>
 Distempred through misrule and passions bace:<br>
 It growes a Monster, and incontinent<br>
 Doth loose his dignitie and natiue grace.<br>
 Behold, who list, both one and other in this place.</p><p>
  
 After the Paynim brethren conquer'd were,<br>
 The <i>Briton</i> Prince recou'ring his stolne sword,<br>
 And <i>Guyon</i> his lost shield, they both yfere<br>
 Forth passed on their way in faire accord,<br>
 Till him the Prince with gentle court did bord;<br>
 Sir knight, mote I of you this curt'sie read,<br>
 To weet why on your shield so goodly scord<br>
 Beare ye the picture of that Ladies head?<br>
 Full liuely is the semblaunt, though the substance dead.</p><p>
  
 Faire Sir (said he) if in that picture dead<br>
 Such life ye read, and vertue in vaine shew,<br>
 What mote ye weene, if the trew liuely-head<br>
 Of that most glorious visage ye did vew?<br>
 But if the beautie of her mind ye knew,<br>
 That is her bountie, and imperiall powre,<br>
 Thousand times fairer then her mortall hew,<br>
 O how great wonder would your thoughts deuoure,<br>
 And infinite desire into your spirite poure!</p><p>
  
 She is the mighty Queene of <i>Faerie</i>,<br>
 Whose faire retrait I in my shield do beare;<br>
 She is the flowre of grace and chastitie,<br>
 Throughout the world renowmed far and neare,<br>
 My liefe, my liege, my Soueraigne, my deare,<br>
 Whose glory shineth as the morning starre,<br>
 And with her light the earth enlumines cleare;<br>
 Far reach her mercies, and her prayses farre,<br>
 As well in state of peace, as puissaunce in warre.</p><p>
  
 Thrise happy man, (said then the <i>Briton</i> knight)<br>
 Whom gracious lot, and thy great valiaunce<br>
 Haue made thee souldier of that Princesse bright,<br>
 Which with her bounty and glad countenance<br>
 Doth blesse her seruaunts, and them high aduaunce.<br>
 How may straunge knight hope euer to aspire,<br>
 By faithfull seruice, and meet amenance,<br>
 Vnto such blisse? sufficient were that hire<br>
 For losse of thousand liues, to dye at her desire.</p><p>
  
 Said <i>Guyon</i>, Noble Lord, what meed so great,<br>
 Or grace of earthly Prince so soueraine,<br>
 But by your wondrous worth and warlike feat<br>
 Ye well may hope, and easely attaine?<br>
 But were your will, her sold to entertaine,<br>
 And numbred be mongst knights of <i>Maydenhed</i>,<br>
 Great guerdon, well I wote, should you remaine,<br>
 And in her fauour high be reckoned,<br>
 As <i>Arthegall</i>, and <i>Sophy</i> now beene honored.</p><p>
  
 Certes (then said the Prince) I God auow,<br>
 That sith I armes and knighthood first did plight,<br>
 My whole desire hath beene, and yet is now,<br>
 To serue that Queene with all my powre and might.<br>
 Now hath the Sunne with his lamp-burning light,<br>
 Walkt round about the world, and I no lesse,<br>
 Sith of that Goddesse I haue sought the sight,<br>
 Yet no where can her find: such happinesse<br>
 Heauen doth to me enuy, and fortune fauourlesse.</p><p>
  
 Fortune, the foe of famous cheuisaunce<br>
 Seldome (said <i>Guyon</i>) yields to vertue aide,<br>
 But in her way throwes mischiefe and mischaunce,<br>
 Whereby her course is stopt, and passage staid.<br>
 But you, faire Sir, be not herewith dismaid,<br>
 But constant keepe the way, in which ye stand;<br>
 Which were it not, that I am else delaid<br>
 With hard aduenture, which I haue in hand,<br>
 I labour would to guide you through all Faery land.</p><p>
  
 Gramercy Sir (said he) but mote I wote,<br>
 What straunge aduenture do ye now pursew?<br>
 Perhaps my succour, or aduizement meete<br>
 Mote stead you much your purpose to subdew.<br>
 Then gan Sir <i>Guyon</i> all the story shew<br>
 Of false <i>Acrasia</i>, and her wicked wiles,<br>
 Which to auenge, the Palmer him forth drew<br>
 From Faery court.  So talked they, the whiles<br>
 They wasted had much way, and measurd many miles.</p><p>
  
 And now faire <i>Phoebus</i> gan decline in hast<br>
 His weary wagon to the Westerne vale,<br>
 Whenas they spide a goodly castle, plast<br>
 Foreby a riuer in a pleasaunt dale,<br>
 Which choosing for that euenings hospitale,<br>
 They thither marcht: but when they came in sight,<br>
 And from their sweaty Coursers did auale,<br>
 They found the gates fast barred long ere night,<br>
 And euery loup fast lockt, as fearing foes despight.</p><p>
  
 Which when they saw, they weened fowle reproch<br>
 Was to them doen, their entrance to forstall,<br>
 Till that the Squire gan nigher to approch;<br>
 And wind his horne vnder the castle wall,<br>
 That with the noise it shooke, as it would fall:<br>
 Eftsoones forth looked from the highest spire<br>
 The watch, and lowd vnto the knights did call,<br>
 To weete, what they so rudely did require.<br>
 Who gently answered, They entrance did desire.</p><p>
  
 Fly fly, good knights, (said he) fly fast away<br>
 If that your liues ye loue, as meete ye should;<br>
 Fly fast, and saue your selues from neare decay,<br>
 Here may ye not haue entraunce, though we would:<br>
 We would and would againe, if that we could;<br>
 But thousand enemies about vs raue,<br>
 And with long siege vs in this castle hould:<br>
 Seuen yeares this wize they vs besieged haue,<br>
 And many good knights slaine, that haue vs sought to saue.</p><p>
  
 Thus as he spoke, loe with outragious cry<br>
 A thousand villeins round about them swarmd<br>
 Out of the rockes and caues adioyning nye,<br>
 Vile caytiue wretches, ragged, rude, deformd,<br>
 All threatning death, all in straunge manner armd,<br>
 Some with vnweldy clubs, some with long speares,<br>
 Some rusty kniues, some staues in fire warmd.<br>
 Sterne was their looke, like wild amazed steares,<br>
 Staring with hollow eyes, and stiffe vpstanding heares.</p><p>
  
 Fiersly at first those knights they did assaile,<br>
 And droue them to recoile: but when againe<br>
 They gaue fresh charge, their forces gan to faile,<br>
 Vnhable their encounter to sustaine;<br>
 For with such puissaunce and impetuous maine<br>
 Those Champions broke on them, that forst them fly,<br>
 Like scattered Sheepe, whenas the Shepheards swaine<br>
 A Lyon and a Tigre doth espye,<br>
 With greedy pace forth rushing from the forest nye.</p><p>
  
 A while they fled, but soone returnd againe<br>
 With greater fury, then before was found;<br>
 And euermore their cruell Capitaine<br>
 Sought with his raskall routs t'enclose them round,<br>
 And ouerrun to tread them to the ground.<br>
 But soone the knights with their bright-burning blades<br>
 Broke their rude troupes, and orders did confound,<br>
 Hewing and slashing at their idle shades;<br>
 For though they bodies seeme, yet substance from them fades.</p><p>
  
 As when a swarme of Gnats at euentide<br>
 Out of the fennes of Allan do arise,<br>
 Their murmuring small trompets sounden wide,<br>
 Whiles in the aire their clustring army flies,<br>
 That as a cloud doth seeme to dim the skies;<br>
 Ne man nor beast may rest, or take repast,<br>
 For their sharpe wounds, and noyous iniuries,<br>
 Till the fierce Northerne wind with blustring blast<br>
 Doth blow them quite away, and in the <i>Ocean</i> cast.</p><p>
  
 Thus when they had that troublous rout disperst,<br>
 Vnto the castle gate they come againe,<br>
 And entraunce crau'd, which was denied erst.<br>
 Now when report of that their perilous paine,<br>
 And combrous conflict, which they did sustaine,<br>
 Came to the Ladies eare, which there did dwell,<br>
 She forth issewed with a goodly traine<br>
 Of Squires and Ladies equipaged well,<br>
 And entertained them right fairely, as befell.</p><p>
  
 <i>Alma</i> she called was, a virgin bright;<br>
 That had not yet felt <i>Cupides</i> wanton rage,<br>
 Yet was she woo'd of many a gentle knight,<br>
 And many a Lord of noble parentage,<br>
 That sought with her to lincke in marriage:<br>
 For she was faire, as faire mote euer bee,<br>
 And in the flowre now of her freshest age;<br>
 Yet full of grace and goodly modestee,<br>
 That euen heauen reioyced her sweete face to see.</p><p>
  
 In robe of lilly white she was arayd,<br>
 That from her shoulder to her heele downe raught,<br>
 The traine whereof loose far behind her strayd,<br>
 Braunched with gold &amp; pearle, most richly wrought,<br>
 And borne of two faire Damsels, which were taught,<br>
 That seruice well.  Her yellow golden heare<br>
 Was trimly wouen, and in tresses wrought,<br>
 Ne other tyre she on her head did weare,<br>
 But crowned with a garland of sweet Rosiere.</p><p>
  
 Goodly she entertaind those noble knights,<br>
 And brought them vp into her castle hall;<br>
 Where gentle court and gracious delight<br>
 She to them made, with mildnesse virginall,<br>
 Shewing her selfe both wise and liberall:<br>
 There when they rested had a season dew,<br>
 They her besought of fauour speciall,<br>
 Of that faire Castle to affoord them vew;<br>
 She graunted, &amp; them leading forth, the same did shew.</p><p>
  
 First she them led vp to the Castle wall,<br>
 That was so high, as foe might not it clime,<br>
 And all so faire, and fensible withall,<br>
 Not built of bricke, ne yet of stone and lime,<br>
 But of thing like to that <i>AEgyptian</i> slime,<br>
 Whereof king <i>Nine</i> whilome built <i>Babell</i> towre;<br>
 But ˆo; great pitty, that no lenger time<br>
 So goodly workemanship should not endure:<br>
 Soone it must turne to earth; no earthly thing is sure.</p><p>
  
 The frame thereof seemd partly circulare,<br>
 And part triangulare, &amp;ocirc: worke diuine;<br>
 Those two the first and last proportions are,<br>
 The one imperfect, mortall, foeminine;<br>
 Th'other immortall, perfect, masculine,<br>
 And twixt them both a quadrate was the base,<br>
 Proportioned equally by seuen and nine;<br>
 Nine was the circle set in heauens place,<br>
 All which compacted made a goodly <i>Diapase</i>.</p><p>
  
 Therein two gates were placed seemly well:<br>
 The one before, by which all in did pas,<br>
 Did th'other far in workmanship excell;<br>
 For not of wood, nor of enduring bras,<br>
 But of more worthy substance fram'd it was;<br>
 Doubly disparted, it did locke and close,<br>
 That when it locked, none might thorough pas,<br>
 And when it opened, no man might it close,<br>
 Still open to their friends, and closed to their foes.</p><p>
  
 Of hewen stone the porch was fairely wrought,<br>
 Stone more of valew, and more smooth and fine,<br>
 Then Iet or Marble far from Ireland brought;<br>
 Ouer the which was cast a wandring vine,<br>
 Enchaced with a wanton yuie twine.<br>
 And ouer it a faire Portcullis hong,<br>
 Which to the gate directly did incline,<br>
 With comely compasse, and compacture strong,<br>
 Neither vnseemely short, nor yet exceeding long.</p><p>
  
 Within the Barbican a Porter sate,<br>
 Day and night duely keeping watch and ward,<br>
 Nor wight, nor word mote passe out of the gate,<br>
 But in good order, and with dew regard;<br>
 Vtterers of secrets he from thence debard,<br>
 Bablers of folly, and blazers of crime.<br>
 His larumbell might lowd and wide be hard,<br>
 When cause requird, but neuer out of time;<br>
 Early and late it rong, at euening and at prime.</p><p>
  
 And round about the porch on euery side<br>
 Twise sixteen warders sat, all armed bright<br>
 In glistring steele, and strongly fortifide:<br>
 Tall yeomen seemed they, and of great might,<br>
 And were enraunged ready, still for fight.<br>
 By them as <i>Alma</i> passed with her guestes,<br>
 They did obeysaunce, as beseemed right,<br>
 And then againe returned to their restes:<br>
 The Porter eke to her did lout with humble gestes.</p><p>
  
 Thence she them brought into a stately Hall,<br>
 Wherein were many tables faire dispred,<br>
 And ready dight with drapets festiuall,<br>
 Against the viaundes should be ministred.<br>
 At th'upper end there sate, yclad in red<br>
 Downe to the ground, a comely personage,<br>
 That in his hand a white rod menaged,<br>
 He Steward was hight <i>Diet</i>; rype of age,<br>
 And in demeanure sober, and in counsell sage.</p><p>
  
 And through the Hall there walked to and fro<br>
 A iolly yeoman, Marshall of the same,<br>
 Whose name was <i>Appetite</i>; he did bestow<br>
 Both guestes and meate, when euer in they came,<br>
 And knew them how to order without blame,<br>
 As him the Steward bad.  They both attone<br>
 Did dewty to their Lady, as became;<br>
 Who passing by, forth led her guestes anone<br>
 Into the kitchin rowme, ne spard for nicenesse none.</p><p>
  
 It was a vaut ybuilt for great dispence,<br>
 With many raunges reard along the wall;<br>
 And one great chimney, whose long tonnell thence,<br>
 The smoke forth threw. And in the midst of all<br>
 There placed was a caudron wide and tall,<br>
 Vpon a mighty furnace, burning whot,<br>
 More whot, then <i>Aetn'</i>, or flaming <i>Mongiball</i>:<br>
 For day and night it brent, ne ceased not,<br>
 So long as any thing it in the caudron got.</p><p>
  
 But to delay the heat, least by mischaunce<br>
 It might breake out, and set the whole on fire,<br>
 There added was by goodly ordinaunce,<br>
 An huge great paire of bellowes, which did styre<br>
 Continually, and cooling breath inspyre.<br>
 About the Caudron many Cookes accoyld,<br>
 With hookes and ladles, as need did require;<br>
 The whiles the viandes in the vessell boyld<br>
 They did about their businesse sweat, and sorely toyld.</p><p>
  
 The maister Cooke was cald <i>Concoction</i>,<br>
 A carefull man, and full of comely guise:<br>
 The kitchin Clerke, that hight <i>Digestion</i>,<br>
 Did order all th'Achates in seemely wise,<br>
 And set them forth, as well he could deuise.<br>
 The rest had seuerall offices assind,<br>
 Some to remoue the scum, as it did rise;<br>
 Others to beare the same away did mind;<br>
 And others it to vse according to his kind.</p><p>
  
 But all the liquour, which was fowle and wast,<br>
 Not good nor seruiceable else for ought,<br>
 They in another great round vessell plast,<br>
 Till by a conduit pipe it thence were brought:<br>
 And all the rest, that noyous was, and nought,<br>
 By secret wayes, that none might it espy,<br>
 Was close conuaid, and to the back-gate brought,<br>
 That cleped was <i>Port Esquiline</i>, whereby<br>
 It was auoided quite, and throwne out priuily.</p><p>
  
 Which goodly order, and great workmans skill<br>
 Whenas those knights beheld, with rare delight,<br>
 And gazing wonder they their minds did fill;<br>
 For neuer had they seene so straunge a sight.<br>
 Thence backe againe faire <i>Alma</i> led them right,<br>
 And soone into a goodly Parlour brought,<br>
 That was with royall arras richly dight,<br>
 In which was nothing pourtrahed, nor wrought,<br>
 Not wrought, nor pourtrahed, but easie to be thought.</p><p>
  
 And in the midst thereof vpon the floure,<br>
 A louely beuy of faire Ladies sate,<br>
 Courted of many a iolly Paramoure,<br>
 The which them did in modest wise amate,<br>
 And each one sought his Lady to aggrate:<br>
 And eke emongst them litle <i>Cupid</i> playd<br>
 His wanton sports, being returned late<br>
 From his fierce warres, and hauing from him layd<br>
 His cruell bow, wherewith he thousands hath dismayd.</p><p>
  
 Diuerse delights they found them selues to please;<br>
 Some song in sweet consort, some laught for ioy,<br>
 Some plaid with strawes, some idly sat at ease;<br>
 But other some could not abide to toy,<br>
 All pleasaunce was to them griefe and annoy:<br>
 This fround, that faund, the third for shame did blush,<br>
 Another seemed enuious, or coy,<br>
 Another in her teeth did gnaw a rush:<br>
 But at these straungers presence euery one did hush.</p><p>
  
 Soone as the gracious <i>Alma</i> came in place,<br>
 They all attonce out of their seates arose,<br>
 And to her homage made, with humble grace:<br>
 Whom when the knights beheld, they gan dispose<br>
 Themselues to court, and each a Damsell chose:<br>
 The Prince by chaunce did on a Lady light,<br>
 That was right faire and fresh as morning rose,<br>
 But somwhat sad, and solemne eke in sight,<br>
 As if some pensiue thought cõstraind her gentle spright.</p><p>
  
 In a long purple pall, whose skirt with gold,<br>
 Was fretted all about, she was arayd;<br>
 And in her hand a Poplar braunch did hold:<br>
 To whom the Prince in curteous manner said;<br>
 Gentle Madame, why beene ye thus dismaid,<br>
 And your faire beautie do with sadnesse spill?<br>
 Liues any, that you hath thus ill apaid?<br>
 Or doen you loue, or doen you lacke your will?<br>
 What euer be the cause, it sure beseemes you ill.</p><p>
  
 Faire Sir, (said she halfe in disdainefull wise,)<br>
 How is it, that this mood in me ye blame,<br>
 And in your selfe do not the same aduise?<br>
 Him ill beseemes, anothers fault to name,<br>
 That may vnwares be blotted with the same:<br>
 Pensiue I yeeld I am, and sad in mind,<br>
 Through great desire of glory and of fame:<br>
 Ne ought I weene are ye therein behind,<br>
 That haue twelue moneths sought one, yet no where can her find.</p><p>
  
 The Prince was inly moued at her speach,<br>
 Well weeting trew, what she had rashly told;<br>
 Yet with faire semblaunt sought to hide the breach,<br>
 Which chaunge of colour did perforce vnfold,<br>
 Now seeming flaming whot, now stony cold.<br>
 Tho turning soft aside, he did inquire,<br>
 What wight she was, that Poplar braunch did hold:<br>
 It answered was, her name was <i>Prays-desire</i>,<br>
 That by well doing sought to honour to aspire.</p><p>
  
 The whiles, the <i>Faerie</i> knight did entertaine<br>
 Another Damsell of that gentle crew,<br>
 That was right faire, and modest of demaine,<br>
 But that too oft she chaung'd her natiue hew:<br>
 Straunge was her tyre, and all her garment blew,<br>
 Close round about her tuckt with many a plight:<br>
 Vpon her fist the bird, which shonneth vew,<br>
 And keepes in couerts close from liuing wight,<br>
 Did sit, as yet ashamd, how rude <i>Pan</i> did her dight.</p><p>
  
 So long as <i>Guyon</i> with her commoned,<br>
 Vnto the ground she cast her modest eye,<br>
 And euer and anone with rosie red<br>
 The bashfull bloud her snowy cheekes did dye,<br>
 That her became, as polisht yuory,<br>
 Which cunning Craftesman hand hath ouerlayd<br>
 With faire vermilion or pure Castory.<br>
 Great wonder had the knight, to see the mayd<br>
 So straungely passioned, and to her gently sayd,</p><p>
  
 Faire Damzell, seemeth, by your troubled cheare,<br>
 That either me too bold ye weene, this wise<br>
 You to molest, or other ill to feare<br>
 That in the secret of your hart close lyes,<br>
 From whence it doth, as cloud from sea arise.<br>
 If it be I, of pardon I you pray;<br>
 But if ought else that I mote not deuise,<br>
 I will, if please you it discure, assay,<br>
 To ease you of that ill, so wisely as I may.</p><p>
  
 She answerd nought, but more abasht for shame,<br>
 Held downe her head, the whiles her louely face<br>
 The flashing bloud with blushing did inflame,<br>
 And the strong passion mard her modest grace,<br>
 That <i>Guyon</i> meruayld at her vncouth cace:<br>
 Till <i>Alma</i> him bespake, Why wonder yee<br>
 Faire Sir at that, which ye so much embrace?<br>
 She is the fountaine of your modestee;<br>
 You shamefast are, but <i>Shamefastnesse</i> it selfe is shee.</p><p>
  
 Thereat the Elfe did blush in priuitee,<br>
 And turnd his face away; but she the same<br>
 Dissembled faire, and faynd to ouersee.<br>
 Thus they awhile with court and goodly game,<br>
 Themselues did solace each one with his Dame,<br>
 Till that great Ladie thence away them sought,<br>
 To vew her castles other wondrous frame.<br>
 Vp to a stately Turret she them brought,<br>
 Ascending by ten steps of Alablaster wrought.</p><p>
  
 That Turrets frame most admirable was,<br>
 Like highest heauen compassed around,<br>
 And lifted high aboue this earthly masse,<br>
 Which it suruew'd, as hils doen lower ground;<br>
 But not on ground mote like to this be found,<br>
 Not that, which antique <i>Cadmus</i> whylome built<br>
 In <i>Thebes</i>, which <i>Alexander</i> did confound;<br>
 Nor that proud towre of <i>Troy</i>, though richly guilt,<br>
 From which young <i>Hectors</i> bloud by cruell <i>Greekes</i> was 
 spilt.</p><p>
  
 The roofe hereof was arched ouer head,<br>
 And deckt with flowers and herbars daintily;<br>
 Two goodly Beacons, set in watches stead,<br>
 Therein gaue light, and flam'd continually:<br>
 For they of liuing fire most subtilly<br>
 Were made, and set in siluer sockets bright,<br>
 Couer'd with lids deuiz'd of substance sly,<br>
 That readily they shut and open might.<br>
 O who can tell the prayses of that makers might!</p><p>
  
 Ne can I tell, ne can I stay to tell<br>
 This parts great workmanship, &amp; wondrous powre,<br>
 That all this other worlds worke doth excell,<br>
 And likest is vnto that heauenly towre,<br>
 That God hath built for his owne blessed bowre.<br>
 Therein were diuerse roomes, and diuerse stages,<br>
 But three the chiefest, and of greatest powre,<br>
 In which there dwelt three honorable sages,<br>
 The wisest men, I weene, that liued in their ages.</p><p>
  
 Not he, whom <i>Greece</i>, the Nourse of all good arts,<br>
 By <i>Phoebus</i> doome, the wisest thought aliue,<br>
 Might be compar'd to these by many parts:<br>
 Nor that sage <i>Pylian</i> syre, which did suruiue<br>
 Three ages, such as mortall men contriue,<br>
 By whose aduise old <i>Priams</i> cittie fell,<br>
 With these in praise of pollicies mote striue.<br>
 These three in these three roomes did sundry dwell,<br>
 And counselled faire <i>Alma</i>, how to gouerne well.</p><p>
  
 The first of them could things to come foresee:<br>
 The next could of things present best aduize;<br>
 The third things past could keepe in memoree,<br>
 So that no time, nor reason could arize,<br>
 But that the same could one of these comprize.<br>
 For thy the first did in the forepart sit,<br>
 That nought mote hinder his quicke preiudize:<br>
 He had a sharpe foresight, and working wit,<br>
 That neuer idle was, ne once could rest a whit.</p><p>
  
 His chamber was dispainted all within,<br>
 With sundry colours, in the which were writ<br>
 Infinite shapes of things dispersed thin;<br>
 Some such as in the world were neuer yit,<br>
 Ne can deuized be of mortall wit;<br>
 Some daily seene, and knowen by their names,<br>
 Such as in idle fantasies doe flit:<br>
 Infernall Hags, <i>Centaurs</i>, feendes, <i>Hippodames</i>,<br>
 Apes, Lions, Ægles, Owles, fooles, louers, children, Dames.</p><p>
  
 And all the chamber filled was with flyes,<br>
 Which buzzed all about, and made such sound,<br>
 That they encombred all mens eares and eyes,<br>
 Like many swarmes of Bees assembled round,<br>
 After their hiues with honny do abound:<br>
 All those were idle thoughts and fantasies,<br>
 Deuices, dreames, opinions vnsound,<br>
 Shewes, visions, sooth-sayes, and prophesies;<br>
 And all that fained is, as leasings, tales, and lies.</p><p>
  
 Emongst them all sate he, which wonned there,<br>
 That hight <i>Phantastes</i> by his nature trew;<br>
 A man of yeares yet fresh, as mote appere,<br>
 Of swarth complexion, and of crabbed hew,<br>
 That him full of melancholy did shew;<br>
 Bent hollow beetle browes, sharpe staring eyes,<br>
 That mad or foolish seemd: one by his vew<br>
 Mote deeme him borne with ill disposed skyes,<br>
 When oblique <i>Saturne</i> sate in the house of agonyes.</p><p>
  
 Whom <i>Alma</i> hauing shewed to her guestes,<br>
 Thence brought thẽ to the second roome, whose wals<br>
 Were painted faire with memorable gestes,<br>
 Of famous Wisards, and with picturals<br>
 Of Magistrates, of courts, of tribunals,<br>
 Of commen wealthes, of states, of pollicy,<br>
 Of lawes, of iudgements, and of decretals;<br>
 All artes, all science, all Philosophy,<br>
 And all that in the world was aye thought wittily.</p><p>
  
 Of those that roome was full, and them among<br>
 There sate a man of ripe and perfect age,<br>
 Who did them meditate all his life long,<br>
 That through continuall practise and vsage,<br>
 He now was growne right wise, and wondrous sage.<br>
 Great pleasure had those stranger knights, to see<br>
 His goodly reason, and graue personage,<br>
 That his disciples both desir'd to bee;<br>
 But <i>Alma</i> thence thẽ led to th'hindmost roome of three.</p><p>
  
 That chamber seemed ruinous and old,<br>
 And therefore was remoued farre behind,<br>
 Yet were the wals, that did the same vphold,<br>
 Right firme &amp; strong, though somewhat they declind;<br>
 And therein sate an old old man, halfe blind,<br>
 And all decrepit in his feeble corse,<br>
 Yet liuely vigour rested in his mind,<br>
 And recompenst him with a better scorse:<br>
 Weake body well is chang'd for minds redoubled forse.</p><p>
  
 This man of infinite remembrance was,<br>
 And things foregone through many ages held,<br>
 Which he recorded still, as they did pas,<br>
 Ne suffred them to perish through long eld,<br>
 As all things else, the which this world doth weld,<br>
 But laid them vp in his immortall scrine,<br>
 Where they for euer incorrupted dweld:<br>
 The warres he well remembred of king <i>Nine</i>,<br>
 Of old <i>Assaracus</i>, and <i>Inachus</i> diuine.</p><p>
  
 The yeares of <i>Nestor</i> nothing were to his,<br>
 Ne yet <i>Mathusalem</i>, though longest liu'd;<br>
 For he remembred both their infancies:<br>
 Ne wonder then, if that he were depriu'd<br>
 Of natiue strength now, that he them suruiu'd.<br>
 His chamber all was hangd about with rolles,<br>
 And old records from auncient times deriu'd,<br>
 Some made in books, some in long parchmẽt scrolles,<br>
 That were all worme-eaten, and full of canker holes.</p><p>
  
 Amidst them all he in a chaire was set,<br>
 Tossing and turning them withouten end;<br>
 But for he was vnhable them to fet,<br>
 A litle boy did on him still attend,<br>
 To reach, when euer he for ought did send;<br>
 And oft when things were lost, or laid amis,<br>
 That boy them sought, and vnto him did lend.<br>
 Therefore he <i>Anamnestes</i> cleped is,<br>
 And that old man <i>Eumnestes</i>, by their propertis.</p><p>
  
 The knights there entring, did him reuerence dew<br>
 And wondred at his endlesse exercise,<br>
 Then as they gan his Librarie to vew,<br>
 And antique Registers for to auise,<br>
 There chaunced to the Princes hand to rize,<br>
 An auncient booke, hight <i>Briton moniments</i>,<br>
 That of this lands first conquest did deuize,<br>
 And old diuision into Regiments,<br>
 Till it reduced was to one mans gouernments.</p><p>
  
 Sir <i>Guyon</i> chaunst eke on another booke,<br>
 That hight <i>Antiquitie</i> of <i>Faerie</i> lond.<br>
 In which when as he greedily did looke;<br>
 Th'off-spring of Elues and Faries there he fond,<br>
 As it deliuered was from hond to hond:<br>
 Whereat they burning both with feruent fire,<br>
 Their countries auncestry to vnderstond,<br>
 Crau'd leaue of <i>Alma</i>, and that aged sire,<br>
 To read those bookes; who gladly graunted their desire.</p><p>
