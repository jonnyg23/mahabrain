 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Marin for loue of Florimell,<br>
 In languor wastes his life:<br>
 The Nymph his mother getteth her,<br>
 And giues to him for wife.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 O
  What an endlesse worke haue I in hand,<br>
 To count the seas abundant progeny,<br>
 Whose fruitfull seede farre passeth those in land,<br>
 And also those which wonne in th'azure sky?<br>
 For much more eath to tell the starres on hy,<br>
 Albe they endlesse seeme in estimation,<br>
 Then to recount the Seas posterity:<br>
 So fertile be the flouds in generation,<br>
 So huge their numbers, and so numberlesse their nation.<p>
 
 Therefore the antique wisards well inuented,<br>
 That <i>Venus</i> of the fomy sea was bred;<br>
 For that the seas by her are most augmented.<br>
 Witnesse th'exceeding fry, which there are fed,<br>
 And wondrous sholes, which may of none be red.<br>
 Then blame me not, if I haue err'd in count<br>
 Of Gods, of Nymphs, of riuers yet vnred:<br>
 For though their numbers do much more surmount,<br>
 Yet all those same were there, which erst I did recount.</p><p>
 
 All those were there, and many other more,<br>
 Whose names and nations were too long to tell,<br>
 That <i>Proteus</i> house they fild euen to the dore;<br>
 Yet were they all in order, as befell,<br>
 According their degrees disposed well.<br>
 Amongst the rest, was faire <i>Cymodoce</i>,<br>
 The mother of vnlucky <i>Marinell</i>,<br>
 Who thither with her came, to learne and see<br>
 The manner of the Gods when they at banquet bee.</p><p>
 
 But for he was halfe mortall, being bred<br>
 Of mortall sire, though of immortall wombe,<br>
 He might not with immortall food be fed,<br>
 Ne with th'eternall Gods to bancket come;<br>
 But walkt abrode, and round about did rome,<br>
 To view the building of that vncouth place,<br>
 That seem'd vnlike vnto his earthly home:<br>
 Where, as he to and fro by chaunce did trace,<br>
 There vnto him betid a disauentrous case.</p><p>
 
 Vnder the hanging of an hideous clieffe,<br>
 He heard the lamentable voice of one,<br>
 That piteously complaind her carefull grieffe,<br>
 Which neuer she before disclosd to none,<br>
 But to her selfe her sorrow did bemone.<br>
 So feelingly her case she did complaine,<br>
 That ruth it moued in the rocky stone,<br>
 And made it seeme to feele her grieuous paine,<br>
 And oft to grone with billowes beating from the maine.</p><p>
 
 Though vaine I see my sorrowes to vnfold,<br>
 And count my cares, when none is nigh to heare,<br>
 Yet hoping griefe may lessen being told,<br>
 I will them tell though vnto no man neare:<br>
 For heauen that vnto all lends equall eare,<br>
 Is farre from hearing of my heauy plight;<br>
 And lowest hell, to which I lie most neare,<br>
 Cares not what euils hap to wretched wight;<br>
 And greedy seas doe in the spoile of life delight.</p><p>
 
 Yet loe the seas I see by often beating,<br>
 Doe pearce the rockes, and hardest marble weares;<br>
 But his hard rocky hart for no entreating<br>
 Will yeeld, but when my piteous plaints he heares,<br>
 Is hardned more with my aboundant teares.<br>
 Yet though he neuer list to me relent,<br>
 But let me waste in woe my wretched yeares,<br>
 Yet will I neuer of my loue repent,<br>
 But ioy that for his sake I suffer prisonment.</p><p>
 
 And when my weary ghost with griefe outworne,<br>
 By timely death shall winne her wished rest,<br>
 Let then this plaint vnto his eares be borne,<br>
 That blame it is to him, that armes profest,<br>
 To let her die, whom he might haue redrest.<br>
 There did she pause, inforced to giue place,<br>
 Vnto the passion, that her heart opprest,<br>
 And after she had wept and wail'd a space,<br>
 She gan afresh thus to renew her wretched case.</p><p>
 
 Ye Gods of seas, if any Gods at all<br>
 Haue care of right, or ruth of wretches wrong,<br>
 By one or other way me woefull thrall,<br>
 Deliuer hence out of this dungeon strong,<br>
 In which I daily dying am too long.<br>
 And if ye deeme me death for louing one,<br>
 That loues not me, then doe it not prolong,<br>
 But let me die and end my daies attone,<br>
 And let him liue vnlou'd, or loue him selfe alone.</p><p>
 
 But if that life ye vnto me decree,<br>
 Then let mee liue, as louers ought to do,<br>
 And of my lifes deare loue beloued be:<br>
 And if he shall through pride your doome vndo,<br>
 Do you by duresse him compell thereto,<br>
 And in this prison put him here with me:<br>
 One prison fittest is to hold vs two:<br>
 So had I rather to be thrall, then free;<br>
 Such thraldome or such freedome let it surely be.</p><p>
 
 But O vaine iudgement, and conditions vaine,<br>
 The which the prisoner points vnto the free,<br>
 The whiles I him condemne, and deeme his paine,<br>
 He where he list goes loose, and laughes at me.<br>
 So euer loose, so euer happy be.<br>
 But where so loose or happy that thou art,<br>
 Know <i>Marinell</i> that all this is for thee.<br>
 With that she wept and wail'd, as if her hart<br>
 Would quite haue burst through great abundance of her smart.</p><p>
 
 All which complaint when <i>Marinell</i> had heard,<br>
 And vnderstood the cause of all her care<br>
 To come of him, for vsing her so hard,<br>
 His stubborne heart, that neuer felt misfare<br>
 Was toucht with soft remorse and pitty rare;<br>
 That euen for griefe of minde he oft did grone,<br>
 And inly wish, that in his powre it weare<br>
 Her to redresse: but since he meanes found none<br>
 He could no more but her great misery bemone.</p><p>
 
 Thus whilst his stony heart with tender ruth<br>
 Was toucht, and mighty courage mollifide,<br>
 Dame <i>Venus</i> sonne that tameth stubborne youth<br>
 With iron bit, and maketh him abide,<br>
 Till like a victor on his backe he ride,<br>
 Into his mouth his maystring bridle threw,<br>
 That made him stoupe, till he did him bestride:<br>
 Then gan he make him tread his steps anew,<br>
 And learne to loue, by learning louers paines to rew.</p><p>
 
 Now gan he in his grieued minde deuise,<br>
 How from that dungeon he might her enlarge:<br>
 Some while he thought, by faire and humble wise<br>
 To <i>Proteus</i> selfe to sue for her discharge:<br>
 But then he fear'd his mothers former charge<br>
 Gainst womens loue, long giuen him in vaine.<br>
 Then gan he thinke, perforce with sword and targe<br>
 Her forth to fetch, and <i>Proteus</i> to constraine:<br>
 But soone he gan such folly to forthinke againe.</p><p>
 
 Then did he cast to steale her thence away,<br>
 And with him beare, where none of her might know.<br>
 But all in vaine: for why he found no way<br>
 To enter in, or issue forth below:<br>
 For all about that rocke the sea did flow.<br>
 And though vnto his will she giuen were,<br>
 Yet without ship or bote her thence to row,<br>
 He wist not how her thence away to bere;<br>
 And daunger well he wist long to continue there.</p><p>
 
 At last when as no meanes he could inuent,<br>
 Backe to him selfe he gan returne the blame,<br>
 That was the author of her punishment;<br>
 And with vile curses, and reprochfull shame<br>
 To damne him selfe by euery euill name;<br>
 And deeme vnworthy or of loue or life,<br>
 That had despisde so chast and faire a dame,<br>
 Which him had sought through trouble &amp; lõg strife;<br>
 Yet had refusde a God that her had sought to wife.</p><p>
 
 In this sad plight he walked here and there,<br>
 And romed round about the rocke in vaine,<br>
 As he had lost him selfe, he wist not where;<br>
 Oft listening if he mote her heare againe;<br>
 And still bemoning her vnworthy paine.<br>
 Like as an Hynde whose calfe is falne vnwares<br>
 Into some pit, where she him heares complaine,<br>
 An hundred times about the pit side fares,<br>
 Right sorrowfully mourning her bereaued cares.</p><p>
 
 And now by this the feast was throughly ended,<br>
 And euery one gan homeward to resort.<br>
 Which seeing <i>Marinell</i>, was sore offended,<br>
 That his departure thence should be so short,<br>
 And leaue his loue in that sea-walled fort.<br>
 Yet durst he not his mother disobay,<br>
 But her attending in full seemly sort,<br>
 Did march amongst the many all the way:<br>
 And all the way did inly mourne, like one astray.</p><p>
 
 Being returned to his mothers bowre,<br>
 In solitary silence far from wight,<br>
 He gan record the lamentable stowre,<br>
 In which his wretched loue lay day and night,<br>
 For his deare sake, that ill deseru'd that plight:<br>
 The thought whereof empierst his hart so deepe,<br>
 That of no worldly thing he tooke delight;<br>
 Ne dayly food did take, ne nightly sleepe,<br>
 But pyn'd, &amp;; mourn'd, &amp; languisht, and alone did weepe.</p><p>
 
 That in short space his wonted chearefull hew<br>
 Gan fade, and liuely spirits deaded quight:<br>
 His cheeke bones raw, and eie-pits hollow grew,<br>
 And brawney armes had lost their knowen might,<br>
 That nothing like himselfe he seem'd in sight.<br>
 Ere long so weake of limbe, and sicke of loue<br>
 He woxe, that lenger he note stand vpright,<br>
 But to his bed was brought, and layd aboue,<br>
 Like ruefull ghost, vnable once to stirre or moue.</p><p>
 
 Which when his mother saw, she in her mind<br>
 Was troubled sore, ne wist well what to weene,<br>
 Ne could by search nor any meanes out find<br>
 The secret cause and nature of his teene,<br>
 Whereby she might apply some medicine;<br>
 But weeping day and night, did him attend,<br>
 And mourn'd to see her losse before her eyne,<br>
 Which grieu'd her more, that she it could not mend:<br>
 To see an helpelesse euill, double griefe doth lend.</p><p>
 
 Nought could she read the roote of his disease,<br>
 Ne weene what mister maladie it is,<br>
 Whereby to seeke some meanes it to appease.<br>
 Most did she thinke, but most she thought amis,<br>
 That that same former fatall wound of his<br>
 Whyleare by <i>Tryphon</i> was not throughly healed,<br>
 But closely rankled vnder th'orifis:<br>
 Least did she thinke, that which he most concealed,<br>
 That loue it was, which in his hart lay vnreuealed.</p><p>
 
 Therefore to <i>Tryphon</i> she againe doth hast,<br>
 And him doth chyde as false and fraudulent,<br>
 That fayld the trust, which she in him had plast,<br>
 To cure her sonne, as he his faith had lent:<br>
 Who now was falne into new languishment<br>
 Of his old hurt, which was not throughly cured.<br>
 So backe he came vnto her patient;<br>
 Where searching euery part, her well assured,<br>
 That it was no old sore, which his new paine procured.</p><p>
 
 But that it was some other maladie,<br>
 Or griefe vnknowne, which he could not discerne:<br>
 So left he her withouten remedie.<br>
 Then gan her heart to faint, and quake, and earne,<br>
 And inly troubled was, the truth to learne.<br>
 Vnto himselfe she came, and him besought,<br>
 Now with faire speches, now with threatnings sterne,<br>
 If ought lay hidden in his grieued thought,<br>
 It to reueale: who still her answered, there was nought.</p><p>
 
 Nathlesse she rested not so satisfide,<br>
 But leauing watry gods, as booting nought,<br>
 Vnto the shinie heauen in haste she hide,<br>
 And thence <i>Apollo</i> King of Leaches brought.<br>
 <i>Apollo</i> came; who soone as he had sought<br>
 Through his disease, did by and by out find,<br>
 That he did languish of some inward thought,<br>
 The which afflicted his engrieued mind;<br>
 Which loue he red to be, that leads each liuing kind.</p><p>
 
 Which when he had vnto his mother told,<br>
 She gan thereat to fret, and greatly grieue.<br>
 And comming to her sonne, gan first to scold,<br>
 And chyde at him, that made her misbelieue:<br>
 But afterwards she gan him soft to shrieue,<br>
 And wooe with faire intreatie, to disclose,<br>
 Which of the Nymphes his heart so sore did mieue.<br>
 For sure she weend it was some one of those,<br>
 Which he had lately seene, that for his loue he chose.</p><p>
 
 Now lesse she feared that same fatall read,<br>
 That warned him of womens loue beware:<br>
 Which being ment of mortall creatures sead,<br>
 For loue of Nymphes she thought she need not care,<br>
 But promist him, what euer wight she weare,<br>
 That she her loue to him would shortly gaine:<br>
 So he her told: but soone as she did heare<br>
 That <i>Florimell</i> it was, which wrought his paine,<br>
 She gan a fresh to chafe, and grieue in euery vaine.</p><p>
 
 Yet since she saw the streight extremitie,<br>
 In which his life vnluckily was layd,<br>
 It was no time to scan the prophecie,<br>
 Whether old <i>Proteus</i> true or false had sayd,<br>
 That his decay should happen by a mayd.<br>
 It's late in death of daunger to aduize,<br>
 Or loue forbid him, that is life denayd:<br>
 But rather gan in troubled mind deuize,<br>
 How she that Ladies libertie might enterprize.</p><p>
 
 To <i>Proteus</i> selfe to sew she thought it vaine,<br>
 Who was the root and worker of her woe:<br>
 Nor vnto any meaner to complaine,<br>
 But vnto great king <i>Neptune</i> selfe did goe,<br>
 And on her knee before him falling lowe,<br>
 Made humble suit vnto his Maiestie,<br>
 To graunt to her, her sonnes life, which his foe<br>
 A cruell Tyrant had presumpteouslie<br>
 By wicked doome condemn'd, a wretched death to die.</p><p>
 
 To whom God <i>Neptune</i> softly smyling, thus;<br>
 Daughter me seemes of double wrong ye plaine,<br>
 Gainst one that hath both wronged you, and vs:<br>
 For death t'adward I ween'd did appertaine<br>
 To none, but to the seas sole Soueraine.<br>
 Read therefore who it is, which this hath wrought,<br>
 And for what cause; the truth discouer plaine.<br>
 For neuer wight so euill did or thought,<br>
 But would some rightfull cause pretend, though rightly nought.</p><p>
 
 To whom she answerd, Then it is by name<br>
 <i>Proteus</i>, that hath ordayn'd my sonne to die;<br>
 For that a waift, the which by fortune came<br>
 Vpon your seas, he claym'd as propertie:<br>
 And yet nor his, nor his in equitie,<br>
 But yours the waift by high prerogatiue.<br>
 Therefore I humbly craue your Maiestie,<br>
 It to repleuie, and my sonne repriue:<br>
 So shall you by one gift saue all vs three aliue.</p><p>
 
 He graunted it: and streight his warrant made,<br>
 Vnder the Sea-gods seale autenticall,<br>
 Commaunding <i>Proteus</i> straight t'enlarge the mayd,<br>
 Which wandring on his seas imperiall,<br>
 He lately tooke, and sithence kept as thrall.<br>
 Which she receiuing with meete thankefulnesse,<br>
 Departed straight to <i>Proteus</i> therewithall:<br>
 Who reading it with inward loathfulnesse,<br>
 Was grieued to restore the pledge, he did possesse.</p><p>
 
 Yet durst he not the warrant to withstand,<br>
 But vnto her deliuered <i>Florimell</i>.<br>
 Whom she receiuing by the lilly hand,<br>
 Admyr'd her beautie much, as she mote well:<br>
 For she all liuing creatures did excell;<br>
 And was right ioyous, that she gotten had<br>
 So faire a wife for her sonne <i>Marinell</i>.<br>
 So home with her she streight the virgin lad,<br>
 And shewed her to him, then being sore bestad.</p><p>
 
 Who soone as he beheld that angels face,<br>
 Adorn'd with all diuine perfection,<br>
 His cleared heart eftsoones away gan chace<br>
 Sad death, reuiued with her sweet inspection<br>
 And feeble spirit inly felt refection;<br>
 As withered weed through cruell winters tine,<br>
 That feeles the warmth of sunny beames reflection,<br>
 Liftes vp his head, that did before decline<br>
 And gins to spread his leafe before the faire sunshine.</p><p>
 
 Right so himselfe did <i>Marinell</i> vpreare,<br>
 When he in place his dearest loue did spy;<br>
 And though his limbs could not his bodie beare,<br>
 Ne former strength returne so suddenly,<br>
 Yet chearefull signes he shewed outwardly.<br>
 Ne lesse was she in secret hart affected,<br>
 But that she masked it with modestie,<br>
 For feare she should of lightnesse be detected:<br>
 Which to another place I leaue to be perfected.</p><p>
