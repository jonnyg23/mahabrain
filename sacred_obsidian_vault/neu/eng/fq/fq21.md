 </p><blockquote> 
 <i>Sir Guyon laid in swowne is by<br>
 Acrates sonnes despoyld,<br>
 Whom Arthur soone hath reskewed<br>
 And Paynim brethren foyld.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote> 
 
  
 <p>
 </p><blockquote> 
 A
 Nd is there care in heauen? and is there loue<br>
 In heauenly spirits to these creatures bace,<br>
 That may compassion of their euils moue?<br>
 There is: else much more wretched were the cace<br>
 Of men, then beasts.  But ô th'exceeding grace<br>
 Of highest God, that loues his creatures so,<br>
 And all his workes with mercy doth embrace,<br>
 That blessed Angels, he sends to and fro,<br>
 To serue to wicked man, to serue his wicked foe.<p>
  
 How oft do they, their siluer bowers leaue,<br>
 To come to succour vs, that succour want?<br>
 How oft do they with golden pineons, cleaue<br>
 The flitting skyes, like flying Pursuiuant,<br>
 Against foule feends to aide vs millitant?<br>
 They for vs fight, they watch and dewly ward,<br>
 And their bright Squadrons round about vs plant,<br>
 And all for loue, and nothing for reward:<br>
 O why should heauenly God to man haue such regard?</p><p>
  
 During the while, that <i>Guyon</i> did abide<br>
 In <i>Mammons</i> house, the Palmer, whom whyleare<br>
 That wanton Mayd of passage had denide,<br>
 By further search had passage found elsewhere,<br>
 And being on his way, approched neare,<br>
 Where <i>Guyon</i> lay in traunce, when suddenly<br>
 He heard a voice, that called loud and cleare,<br>
 Come hither, come hither, ô come hastily;<br>
 That all the fields resounded with the ruefull cry.</p><p>
  
 The Palmer lent his eare vnto the noyce,<br>
 To weet, who called so importunely:<br>
 Againe he heard a more efforced voyce,<br>
 That bad him come in haste.  He by and by<br>
 His feeble feet directed to the cry;<br>
 Which to that shadie delue him brought at last,<br>
 Where <i>Mammon</i> earst did sunne his threasury:<br>
 There the good <i>Guyon</i> he found slumbring fast<br>
 In senselesse dreame; which sight at first him sore aghast.</p><p>
  
 Beside his head there sate a faire young man,<br>
 Of wondrous beautie, and of freshest yeares,<br>
 Whose tender bud to blossome new began,<br>
 And flourish faire aboue his equall peares;<br>
 His snowy front curled with golden heares,<br>
 Like <i>Phoebus</i> face adornd with sunny rayes,<br>
 Diuinely shone, and two sharpe winged sheares,<br>
 Decked with diuerse plumes, like painted Iayes,<br>
 Were fixed at his backe, to cut his ayerie wayes.</p><p>
  
 Like as <i>Cupido</i> on <i>Idæan</i> hill,<br>
 When hauing laid his cruell bow away,<br>
 And mortall arrowes, wherewith he doth fill<br>
 The world with murdrous spoiles and bloudie pray,<br>
 With his faire mother he him dights to play,<br>
 And with his goodly sisters, <i>Graces</i> three;<br>
 The Goddesse pleased with his wanton play,<br>
 Suffers her selfe through sleepe beguild to bee,<br>
 The whiles the other Ladies mind their merry glee.</p><p>
  
 Whom when the Palmer saw, abasht he was<br>
 Through fear and wonder, that he nought could say,<br>
 Till him the child bespoke, Long lackt, alas,<br>
 Hath bene thy faithfull aide in hard assay,<br>
 Whiles deadly fit thy pupill doth dismay;<br>
 Behold this heauie sight, thou reuerend Sire,<br>
 But dread of death and dolour doe away;<br>
 For life ere long shall to her home retire,<br>
 And he that breathlesse seemes, shal corage bold respire.</p><p>
  
 The charge, which God doth vnto me arret,<br>
 Of his deare safetie, I to thee commend;<br>
 Yet will I not forgoe, ne yet forget<br>
 The care thereof my selfe vnto the end,<br>
 But euermore him succour, and defend<br>
 Against his foe and mine: watch thou I pray;<br>
 For euill is at hand him to offend.<br>
 So hauing said, eftsoones he gan display<br>
 His painted nimble wings, and vanisht quite away.</p><p>
  
 The Palmer seeing his left empty place,<br>
 And his slow eyes beguiled of their sight,<br>
 Woxe sore affraid, and standing still a space,<br>
 Gaz'd after him, as fowle escapt by flight;<br>
 At last him turning to his charge behight,<br>
 With trembling hand his troubled pulse gan try;<br>
 Where finding life not yet dislodged quight,<br>
 He much reioyst, and courd it tenderly,<br>
 As chicken newly hatcht, from dreaded destiny.</p><p>
  
 At last he spide, where towards him did pace<br>
 Two Paynim knights, all armd as bright as skie,<br>
 And them beside an aged Sire did trace,<br>
 And farre before a light-foot Page did flie,<br>
 That breathed strife and troublous enmitie;<br>
 Those were the two sonnes of <i>Acrates</i> old<br>
 Who meeting earst with <i>Archimago</i> slie,<br>
 Foreby that idle strond, of him were told,<br>
 That he, wich earst them combatted, was <i>Guyon</i> bold.</p><p>
  
 Which to auenge on him they dearely vowd,<br>
 Where euer that on ground they mote him fynd;<br>
 False <i>Archimage</i> prouokt their courage prowd,<br>
 And stryfull <i>Atin</i> in their stubborne mynd<br>
 Coles of contention and whot vengeance tynd.<br>
 Now bene they come, whereas the Palmer sate,<br>
 Keeping that slombred corse to him assynd;<br>
 Well knew they both his person, sith of late<br>
 With him in bloudie armes they rashly did debate.</p><p>
  
 Whom when <i>Pyrrochles</i> saw, inflam'd with rage,<br>
 That sire he foule bespake, Thou dotard vile,<br>
 That with thy brutenesse shendst thy comely age,<br>
 Abandone soone, I read, the caitiue spoile<br>
 Of that same outcast carkasse, that erewhile<br>
 Made it selfe famous through false trechery,<br>
 And crownd his coward crest with knightly stile;<br>
 Loe where he now inglorious doth lye,<br>
 To proue he liued ill, that did thus foully dye.</p><p>
  
 To whom the Palmer fearelesse answered;<br>
 Certes, Sir knight, ye bene too much to blame,<br>
 Thus for to blot the honour of the dead,<br>
 And with foule cowardize his carkasse shame,<br>
 Whose liuing hands immortalizd his name.<br>
 Vile is the vengeance on the ashes cold,<br>
 And enuie base, to barke at sleeping fame:<br>
 Was neuer wight, that treason of him told;<br>
 Your selfe his prowesse prou'd &amp; found him fiers &amp; bold.</p><p>
  
 Then said <i>Cymochles</i>; Palmer, thou doest dote,<br>
 Ne canst of prowesse, ne of knighthood deeme,<br>
 Saue as thou seest or hearst.  But well I wote,<br>
 That of his puissance tryall made extreeme;<br>
 Yet gold all is not, that doth golden seeme,<br>
 Ne all good knights, that shake well speare and shield:<br>
 The worth of all men by their end esteeme,<br>
 And then due praise, or due reproch them yield;<br>
 Bad therefore I him deeme, that thus lies dead on field.</p><p>
  
 Good or bad (gan his brother fierce reply)<br>
 What doe I recke, sith that he dyde entire?<br>
 Or what doth his bad death now satisfy<br>
 The greedy hunger of reuenging ire,<br>
 Sith wrathfull hand wrought not her owne desire?<br>
 Yet since no way is left to wreake my spight,<br>
 I will him reaue of armes, the victors hire,<br>
 And of that shield, more worthy of good knight;<br>
 For why should a dead dog be deckt in armour bright?</p><p>
  
 Faire Sir, said then the Palmer suppliaunt,<br>
 For knighthoods loue, do not so foule a deed,<br>
 Ne blame your honour with so shamefull vaunt<br>
 Of vile reuenge. To spoile the dead of weed<br>
 Is sacrilege, and doth all sinnes exceed;<br>
 But leaue these relicks of his liuing might,<br>
 To decke his herce, and trap his tomb-blacke steed.<br>
 What herce or steed (said he) should he haue dight,<br>
 But be entombed in the rauen or the kight?</p><p>
  
 With that, rude hand vpon his shield he laid,<br>
 And th'other brother gan his helme vnlace,<br>
 Both fiercely bent to haue him disaraid;<br>
 Till that they spide, where towards them did pace<br>
 An armed knight, of bold and bounteous grace,<br>
 Whose squire bore after him an heben launce,<br>
 And couerd shield.  Well kend him so farre space<br>
 Th'enchaunter by his armes and amenaunce,<br>
 When vnder him he saw his Lybian steed to praunce.</p><p>
  
 And to those brethren said, Rise rise by liue,<br>
 And vnto battell doe your selues addresse;<br>
 For yonder comes the prowest knight aliue,<br>
 Prince <i>Arthur</i>, flowre of grace and nobilesse,<br>
 That hath to Paynim knights wrought great distresse,<br>
 And thousand Sar'zins foully donne to dye.<br>
 That word so deepe did in their harts impresse,<br>
 That both eftsoones vpstarted furiously,<br>
 And gan themselues prepare to battell greedily.</p><p>
  
 But fierce <i>Pyrrochles</i>, lacking his owne sword,<br>
 The want thereof now greatly gan to plaine,<br>
 And <i>Archimage</i> besought, him that afford,<br>
 Which he had brought for <i>Braggadocchio</i> vaine.<br>
 So would I (said th'enchaunter) glad and faine<br>
 Beteeme to you this sword, you to defend,<br>
 Or ought that else your honour might maintaine,<br>
 But that this weapons powre I well haue kend,<br>
 To be contrarie to the worke, which ye intend.</p><p>
  
 For that same knights owne sword this is of yore,<br>
 Which <i>Merlin</i> made by his almightie art<br>
 For that his noursling, when he knighthood swore,<br>
 Therewith to doen his foes eternall smart.<br>
 The metall first he mixt with <i>Medæwart</i>,<br>
 That no enchauntment from his dint might saue;<br>
 That it in flames of <i>Aetna</i> wrought apart,<br>
 And seuen times dipped in the bitter waue<br>
 Of hellish <i>Styx</i>, which hidden vertue to it gaue.</p><p>
  
 The vertue is, that neither steele, nor stone<br>
 The stroke thereof from entrance may defend;<br>
 Ne euer may be vsed by his fone,<br>
 Ne forst his rightfull owner to offend,<br>
 Ne euer will it breake, ne euer bend.<br>
 Wherefore <i>Morddure</i> it rightfully is hight.<br>
 In vaine therefore, <i>Pyrrochles</i>, should I lend<br>
 The same to thee, against his lord to fight,<br>
 For sure it would deceiue thy labour, and thy might.</p><p>
  
 Foolish old man, said then the Pagan wroth,<br>
 That weenest words or charmes may force withstond:<br>
 Soone shalt thou see, and then beleeue for troth,<br>
 That I can carue with this inchaunted brond<br>
 His Lords owne flesh.  Therewith out of his hond<br>
 That vertuous steele he rudely snatcht away,<br>
 And <i>Guyons</i> shield about his wrest he bond;<br>
 So readie dight, fierce battaile to assay,<br>
 And match his brother proud in battailous array.</p><p>
  
 By this that straunger knight in presence came,<br>
 And goodly salued them; who nought againe<br>
 Him answered, as courtesie became,<br>
 But with sterne lookes, and stomachous disdaine,<br>
 Gaue signes of grudge and discontentment vaine:<br>
 Then turning to the Palmer, he gan spy<br>
 Where at his feete, with sorrowfull demaine<br>
 And deadly hew, an armed corse did lye,<br>
 In whose dead face he red great magnanimity.</p><p>
  
 Said he then to the Palmer, Reuerend syre,<br>
 What great misfortune hath betidd this knight?<br>
 Or did his life her fatall date expyre,<br>
 Or did he fall by treason, or by fight?<br>
 How euer, sure I rew his pitteous plight.<br>
 Not one, nor other, (said the Palmer graue)<br>
 Hath him befalne, but cloudes of deadly night<br>
 A while his heauie eylids couer'd haue,<br>
 And all his senses drowned in deepe senselesse waue.</p><p>
  
 Which, those his cruell foes, that stand hereby,<br>
 Making aduantage, to reuenge their spight,<br>
 Would him disarme, and treaten shamefully,<br>
 Vnworthy vsage of redoubted knight.<br>
 But you, faire Sir, whose honorable sight<br>
 Doth promise hope of helpe, and timely grace,<br>
 Mote I beseech to succour his sad plight,<br>
 And by your powre protect his feeble cace.<br>
 First praise of knighthood is, foule outrage to deface.</p><p>
  
 Palmer, (said he) no knight so rude, I weene,<br>
 As to doen outrage to a sleeping ghost:<br>
 Ne was there euer noble courage seene,<br>
 That in aduauntage would his puissance bost:<br>
 Honour is least, where oddes appeareth most.<br>
 May be, that better reason will asswage<br>
 The rash reuengers heat.  Words well dispost<br>
 Haue secret powre, t'appease inflamed rage:<br>
 If not, leaue vnto me thy knights last patronage.</p><p>
  
 Tho turning to those brethren, thus bespoke,<br>
 Ye warlike payre, whose valorous great might<br>
 It seemes, iust wrongs to vengeance doe prouoke,<br>
 To wreake your wrath on this dead seeming knight,<br>
 Mote ought allay the storme of your despight,<br>
 And settle patience in so furious heat?<br>
 Not to debate the chalenge of your right,<br>
 But for this carkasse pardon I entreat,<br>
 Whom fortune hath alreadie laid in lowest seat.</p><p>
  
 To whom <i>Cymochles</i> said; For what art thou,<br>
 That mak'st thy selfe his dayes-man, to prolong<br>
 The vengeance prest?  Or who shall let me now,<br>
 On this vile bodie from to wreake my wrong,<br>
 And make his carkasse as the outcast dong?<br>
 Why should not that dead carrion satisfie<br>
 The guilt, which if he liued had thus long,<br>
 His life for due reuenge should deare abie?<br>
 The trespasse still doth liue, albe the person die.</p><p>
  
 Indeed (then said the Prince) the euill donne<br>
 Dyes not, when breath the bodie first doth leaue,<br>
 But from the grandsyre to the Nephewes sonne,<br>
 And all his seed the curse doth often cleaue,<br>
 Till vengeance vtterly the guilt bereaue:<br>
 So streightly God doth iudge.  But gentle knight,<br>
 That doth against the dead his hand vpreare,<br>
 His honour staines with rancour and despight,<br>
 And great disparagment makes to his former might.</p><p>
  
 <i>Pyrrochles</i> gan reply the second time,<br>
 And to him said, Now felon sure I read,<br>
 How that thou art partaker of his crime:<br>
 Therefore by <i>Termagaunt</i> thou shalt be dead.<br>
 With that his hand, more sad then lomp of lead,<br>
 Vplifting high, he weened with <i>Morddure</i>,<br>
 His owne good sword <i>Morddure</i>, to cleaue his head.<br>
 The faithfull steele such treason no'uld endure,<br>
 But swaruing from the marke, his Lords life did assure.</p><p>
  
 Yet was the force so furious and so fell,<br>
 That horse and man it made to reele aside;<br>
 Nath'lesse the Prince would not forsake his sell:<br>
 For well of yore he learned had to ride,<br>
 But full of anger fiercely to him cride;<br>
 False traitour miscreant, thou broken hast<br>
 The law of armes, to strike foe vndefide.<br>
 But thou thy treasons fruit, I hope, shalt taste<br>
 Right sowre, &amp; feele the law, the which thou hast defast.</p><p>
  
 With that his balefull speare, he fiercely bent<br>
 Against the Pagans brest, and therewith thought<br>
 His cursed life out of her lodge haue rent:<br>
 But ere the point arriued, where it ought,<br>
 That seuen-fold shield, which he from <i>Guyon</i> brought<br>
 He cast betwene to ward the bitter stound:<br>
 Through all those foldes the steelehead passage wrought<br>
 And through his shoulder pierst; wherwith to groũd<br>
 He groueling fell, all gored in his gushing wound.</p><p>
  
 Which when his brother saw, fraught with great griefe<br>
 And wrath, he to him leaped furiously,<br>
 And fowly said, By <i>Mahoune</i>, cursed thiefe,<br>
 That direfull stroke thou dearely shalt aby.<br>
 Then hurling vp his harmefull blade on hye,<br>
 Smote him so hugely on his haughtie crest,<br>
 That from his saddle forced him to fly:<br>
 Else mote it needes downe to his manly brest<br>
 Haue cleft his head in twaine, and life thence dispossest.</p><p>
  
 Now was the Prince in daungerous distresse,<br>
 Wanting his sword, when he on foot should fight:<br>
 His single speare could doe him small redresse,<br>
 Against two foes of so exceeding might,<br>
 The least of which was match for any knight.<br>
 And now the other, whom he earst did daunt,<br>
 Had reard himselfe againe to cruell fight,<br>
 Three times more furious, and more puissaunt,<br>
 Vnmindfull of his wound, of his fate ignoraunt.</p><p>
  
 So both attonce him charge on either side,<br>
 With hideous strokes, and importable powre,<br>
 That forced him his ground to trauerse wide,<br>
 And wisely watch to ward that deadly stowre:<br>
 For in his shield, as thicke as stormie showre,<br>
 Their strokes did raine, yet did he neuer quaile,<br>
 Ne backward shrinke, but as a stedfast towre,<br>
 Whom foe with double battry doth assaile,<br>
 Them on her bulwarke beares, and bids them nought auaile.</p><p>
  
 So stoutly he withstood their strong assay,<br>
 Till that at last, when he aduantage spyde,<br>
 His poinant speare he thrust with puissant sway<br>
 At proud <i>Cymochles</i>, whiles his shield was wyde,<br>
 That through his thigh the mortall steele did gryde:<br>
 He swaruing with the force, within his flesh<br>
 Did breake the launce, and let the head abyde:<br>
 Out of the wound the red bloud flowed fresh,<br>
 That vnderneath his feet soone made a purple plesh.</p><p>
  
 Horribly then he gan to rage, and rayle,<br>
 Cursing his Gods, and himselfe damning deepe:<br>
 Als when his brother saw the red bloud rayle<br>
 Adowne so fast, and all his armour steepe,<br>
 For very felnesse lowd he gan to weepe,<br>
 And said, Caytiue, cursse on thy cruell hond,<br>
 That twise hath sped; yet shall it not thee keepe<br>
 From the third brunt of this my fatall brond:<br>
 Loe where the dreadfull Death behind thy backe doth stond.</p><p>
  
 With that he strooke, and th'other strooke withall,<br>
 That nothing seem'd mote beare so monstrous might:<br>
 The one vpon his couered shield did fall,<br>
 And glauncing downe would not his owner byte:<br>
 But th'other did vpon his troncheon smyte,<br>
 Which hewing quite a sunder, further way<br>
 It made, and on his hacqueton did lyte,<br>
 The which diuiding with importune sway,<br>
 It seizd in his right side, and there the dint did stay.</p><p>
  
 Wyde was the wound, and a large lukewarme flood,<br>
 Red as the Rose, thence gushed grieuously;<br>
 That when the Paynim spyde the streaming blood,<br>
 Gaue him great hart, and hope of victory.<br>
 On th'other side, in huge perplexity,<br>
 The Prince now stood, hauing his weapon broke;<br>
 Nought could he hurt, but still at ward did ly:<br>
 Yet with his troncheon he so rudely stroke<br>
 <i>Cymochles</i> twise, that twise him forst his foot reuoke.</p><p>
  
 Whom when the Palmer saw in such distresse,<br>
 Sir <i>Guyons</i> sword he lightly to him raught,<br>
 And said; Faire Son, great God thy right hand blesse,<br>
 To vse that sword so wisely as it ought.<br>
 Glad was the knight, &amp; with fresh courage fraught,<br>
 When as againe he armed felt his hond;<br>
 Then like a Lion, which hath long time saught<br>
 His robbed whelpes, and at the last them fond<br>
 Emongst the shepheard swaynes, then wexeth wood &amp; yond.</p><p>
  
 So fierce he laid about him, and dealt blowes<br>
 On either side, that neither mayle could hold,<br>
 Ne shield defend the thunder of his throwes:<br>
 Now to <i>Pyrrochles</i> many strokes he told;<br>
 Eft to <i>Cymochles</i> twise so many fold:<br>
 Then backe againe turning his busie hond,<br>
 Them both attonce compeld with courage bold,<br>
 To yield wide way to his hart-thrilling brond;<br>
 And though they both stood stiffe, yet could not both withstond.</p><p>
  
 As saluage Bull, whom two fierce mastiues bayt,<br>
 When rancour doth with rage him once engore,<br>
 Forgets with warie ward them to awayt,<br>
 But with his dreadfull hornes them driues afore,<br>
 Or flings aloft, or treads downe in the flore,<br>
 Breathing out wrath, and bellowing disdaine,<br>
 That all the forrest quakes to heare him rore:<br>
 So rag'd Prince <i>Arthur</i> twixt his foemen twaine,<br>
 That neither could his mightie puissance sustaine.</p><p>
  
 But euer at <i>Pyrrochles</i> when he smit,<br>
 Who <i>Guyons</i> shield cast euer him before,<br>
 Whereon the Faery Queenes pourtract was writ,<br>
 His hand relented, and the stroke forbore,<br>
 And his deare hart the picture gan adore,<br>
 Which oft the Paynim sau'd from deadly stowre.<br>
 But him henceforth the same can saue no more;<br>
 For now arriued is his fatall howre,<br>
 That no'te auoyded be by earthly skill or powre.</p><p>
  
 For when <i>Cymochles</i> saw the fowle reproch,<br>
 Which them appeached, prickt with guilty shame,<br>
 And inward griefe, he fiercely gan approch,<br>
 Resolu'd to put away that loathly blame,<br>
 Or dye with honour and desert of fame;<br>
 And on the hauberk stroke the Prince so sore,<br>
 That quite disparted all the linked frame,<br>
 And pierced to the skin, but bit no more,<br>
 Yet made him twise to reele, that neuer moou'd afore.</p><p>
  
 Whereat renfierst with wrath and sharpe regret,<br>
 He stroke so hugely with his borrowd blade,<br>
 That it empierst the Pagans burganet,<br>
 And cleauing the hard steele, did deepe inuade<br>
 Into his head, and cruell passage made<br>
 Quite through his braine.  He tombling downe on ground,<br>
 Breathd out his ghost, which to th'infernall shade<br>
 Fast flying, there eternall torment found,<br>
 For all the sinnes, wherewith his lewd life did abound.</p><p>
  
 Which when his german saw, the stony feare<br>
 Ran to his hart, and all his sence dismayd,<br>
 Ne thenceforth life ne courage did appeare,<br>
 But as a man, whom hellish feends haue frayd,<br>
 Long trembling still he stood: at last thus sayd;<br>
 Traytour what hast thou doen? how euer may<br>
 Thy cursed hand so cruelly haue swayd<br>
 Against that knight: Harrow and well away,<br>
 After so wicked deed why liu'st thou lenger day?</p><p>
  
 With that all desperate as loathing light,<br>
 And with reuenge desiring soone to dye,<br>
 Assembling all his force and vtmost might,<br>
 With his owne sword he fierce at him did flye,<br>
 And strooke, and foynd, and lasht outrageously,<br>
 Withouten reason or regard.  Well knew<br>
 The Prince, with patience and sufferaunce sly<br>
 So hasty heat soone cooled to subdew:<br>
 Tho when this breathlesse woxe, that batteil gan renew.</p><p>
  
 As when a windy tempest bloweth hye,<br>
 That nothing may withstand his stormy stowre,<br>
 The cloudes, as things affrayd, before him flye;<br>
 But all so soone as his outrageous powre<br>
 Is layd, they fiercely then begin to shoure,<br>
 And as in scorne of his spent stormy spight,<br>
 Now all attonce their malice forth do poure;<br>
 So did Sir <i>Guyon</i>[Prince <i>Arthur</i>] beare himselfe in fight,<br>
 And suffred rash <i>Pyrrochles</i> wast his idle might.</p><p>
  
 At last when as the Sarazin perceiu'd,<br>
 How that straunge sword refusd, to serue his need,<br>
 But when he stroke most strong, the dint deceiu'd,<br>
 He flong it from him, and deuoyd of dreed,<br>
 Vpon him lightly leaping without heed,<br>
 Twixt his two mighty armes engrasped fast,<br>
 Thinking to ouerthrow and downe him tred:<br>
 But him in strength and skill the Prince surpast,<br>
 And through his nimble sleight did vnder him down cast.</p><p>
  
 Nought booted it the Paynim then to striue;<br>
 For as a Bittur in the Eagles claw,<br>
 That may not hope by flight to scape aliue,<br>
 Still waites for death with dread and trembling aw;<br>
 So he now subiect to the victours law,<br>
 Did not once moue, nor vpward cast his eye,<br>
 For vile disdaine and rancour, which did gnaw<br>
 His hart in twaine with sad melancholy,<br>
 As one that loathed life, and yet despisd to dye.</p><p>
  
 But full of Princely bounty and great mind,<br>
 The Conquerour nought cared him to slay,<br>
 But casting wrongs and all reuenge behind,<br>
 More glory thought to giue life, then decay,<br>
 And said, Paynim, this is thy dismall day;<br>
 Yet if thou wilt renounce thy miscreaunce,<br>
 And my trew liegeman yield thy selfe for ay,<br>
 Life will I graunt thee for thy valiaunce,<br>
 And all thy wrongs will wipe out of my souenaunce.</p><p>
  
 Foole (said the Pagan) I thy gift defye,<br>
 But vse thy fortune, as it doth befall,<br>
 And say, that I not ouercome do dye,<br>
 But in despight of life, for death do call.<br>
 Wroth was the Prince, and sory yet withall,<br>
 That he so wilfully refused grace;<br>
 Yet sith his fate so cruelly did fall,<br>
 His shining Helmet he gan soone vnlace,<br>
 And left his headlesse body bleeding all the place.</p><p>
  
 By this Sir <i>Guyon</i> from his traunce awakt,<br>
 Life hauing maistered her sencelesse foe;<br>
 And looking vp, when as his shield he lakt,<br>
 And sword saw not, he wexed wondrous woe:<br>
 But when the Palmer, whom he long ygoe<br>
 Had lost, he by him spide, right glad he grew,<br>
 And said, Deare sir, whom wandring to and fro<br>
 I long haue lackt, I ioy thy face to vew;<br>
 Firme is thy faith, whom daunger neuer fro me drew.</p><p>
  
 But read what wicked hand hath robbed mee<br>
 Of my good sword and shield?  The Palmer glad,<br>
 With so fresh hew vprising him to see,<br>
 Him answered; Faire sonne, be no whit sad<br>
 For want of weapons, they shall soone be had.<br>
 So gan he to discourse the whole debate,<br>
 Which that straunge knight for him sustained had,<br>
 And those two Sarazins confounded late,<br>
 Whose carcases on ground were horribly prostrate.</p><p>
  
 Which when he heard, and saw the tokens trew,<br>
 His hart with great affection was embayd,<br>
 And to the Prince bowing with reuerence dew,<br>
 As to the Patrone of his life, thus sayd;<br>
 My Lord, my liege, by whose most gratious ayd<br>
 I liue this day, and see my foes subdewd,<br>
 What may suffise, to be for meede repayd<br>
 Of so great graces, as ye haue me shewd,<br>
 But to be euer bound</p><p>
  
 To whom the Infant thus, Faire Sir, what need<br>
 Good turnes be counted, as a seruile bond,<br>
 To bind their doers, to receiue their meede?<br>
 Are not all knights by oath bound, to withstond<br>
 Oppressours powre by armes and puissant hond?<br>
 Suffise, that I haue done my dew in place.<br>
 So goodly purpose they together fond,<br>
 Of kindnesse and of curteous aggrace;<br>
 The whiles false <i>Archimarge</i> and <i>Atin</i> fled apace.</p><p>
