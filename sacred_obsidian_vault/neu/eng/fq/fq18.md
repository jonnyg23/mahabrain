 </p><blockquote> 
 <i>Pyrrochles does with Guyon fight,<br>
 And Furors chayne vnbinds<br>
 Of whom sore hurt, for his reuenge<br>
 Atin Cymochles finds.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote> 
 
  
 <p>
 </p><blockquote> 
 W
 Ho euer doth to temperaunce apply<br>
 His stedfast life, and all his actions frame,<br>
 Trust me, shall find no greater enimy,<br>
 Then stubborne perturbation, to the same;<br>
 To which right well the wise do giue that name,<br>
 For it the goodly peace of stayed mindes<br>
 Does ouerthrow, and troublous warre proclame:<br>
 His owne woes authour, who so bound it findes,<br>
 As did <i>Pyrrochles</i>, and it wilfully vnbindes.<p>
  
 After that varlets flight, it was not long,<br>
 Ere on the plaine fast pricking <i>Guyon</i> spide<br>
 One in bright armes embatteiled full strong,<br>
 That as the Sunny beames do glaunce and glide<br>
 Vpon the trembling waue, so shined bright,<br>
 And round about him threw forth sparkling fire,<br>
 That seemd him to enflame on euery side:<br>
 His steed was bloudy red, and fomed ire,<br>
 When with the maistring spur he did him roughly stire.</p><p>
  
 Approching nigh, he neuer stayd to greete,<br>
 Ne chaffar words, prowd courage to prouoke,<br>
 But prickt so fiers, that vnderneath his feete<br>
 The smouldring dust did round about him smoke,<br>
 Both horse and man nigh able for to choke;<br>
 And fairly couching his steele-headed speare,<br>
 Him first saluted with a sturdy stroke;<br>
 It booted nought Sir <i>Guyon</i> comming neare<br>
 To thinke, such hideous puissaunce on foot to beare.</p><p>
  
 But lightly shunned it, and passing by,<br>
 With his bright blade did smite at him so fell,<br>
 That the sharpe steele arriuing forcibly<br>
 On his broad shield, bit not, but glauncing fell<br>
 On his horse necke before the quilted sell,<br>
 And from the head the body sundred quight.<br>
 So him dismounted low, he did compell<br>
 On foot with him to matchen equall fight;<br>
 The truncked beast fast bleeding, did him fowly dight.</p><p>
  
 Sore bruzed with the fall, he slow vprose,<br>
 And all enraged, thus him loudly shent;<br>
 Disleall knight, whose coward courage chose<br>
 To wreake it selfe on beast all innocent,<br>
 And shund the marke, at which it should be ment,<br>
 Thereby thine armes seeme strõg, but manhood fraile;<br>
 So hast thou oft with guile thine honour blent;<br>
 But litle may such guile thee now auaile,<br>
 If wonted force and fortune do not much me faile.</p><p>
  
 With that he drew his flaming sword, and strooke<br>
 At him so fiercely, that the vpper marge<br>
 Of his seuenfolded shield away it tooke,<br>
 And glauncing on his helmet, made a large<br>
 And open gash therein: were not his targe,<br>
 That broke the violence of his intent,<br>
 The weary soule from thence it would discharge;<br>
 Nathelesse so sore abuff to him it lent,<br>
 That made him reele, and to his brest his beuer bent.</p><p>
  
 Exceeding wroth was <i>Guyon</i> at that blow,<br>
 And much ashamd, that stroke of liuing arme<br>
 Should him dismay, and make him stoup so low,<br>
 Though otherwise it did him litle harme:<br>
 Tho hurling high his yron braced arme,<br>
 He smote so manly on his shoulder plate,<br>
 That all his left side it did quite disarme;<br>
 Yet there the steele stayd not, but inly bate<br>
 Deepe in his flesh, and opened wide a red floodgate.</p><p>
  
 Deadly dismayd, with horrour of that dint<br>
 <i>Pyrrochles</i> was, and grieued eke entyre;<br>
 Yet nathemore did it his fury stint,<br>
 But added flame vnto his former fire,<br>
 That welnigh molt his hart in raging yre,<br>
 Ne thenceforth his approued skill, to ward,<br>
 Or strike, or hurle, round in warelike gyre,<br>
 Remembred he, ne car'd for his saufgard,<br>
 But rudely rag'd, and like a cruell Tygre far'd.</p><p>
  
 He hewd, and lasht, and foynd, and thundred blowes,<br>
 And euery way did seeke into his life,<br>
 Ne plate, ne male could ward so mighty throwes,<br>
 But yielded passage to his cruell knife.<br>
 But <i>Guyon</i>, in the heat of all his strife,<br>
 Was warie wise, and closely did awayt<br>
 Auauntage, whilest his foe did rage most rife;<br>
 Sometimes a thwart, sometimes he strooke him strayt,<br>
 And falsed oft his blowes, t'illude him with such bayt.</p><p>
  
 Like as a Lyon, whose imperiall powre<br>
 A prowd rebellious Vnicorne defies,<br>
 T'auoide the rash assault and wrathfull stowre<br>
 Of his fiers foe, him to a tree applies,<br>
 And when him running in full course he spies,<br>
 He slips aside; the whiles that furious beast<br>
 His precious horne, sought of his enimies<br>
 Strikes in the stocke, ne thence can be rel[e]ast,<br>
 But to the mighty victour yields a bounteous feast.</p><p>
  
 With such faire slight him <i>Guyon</i> often faild,<br>
 Till at the last all breathlesse, wearie, faint<br>
 Him spying, with fresh onset he assaild,<br>
 And kindling new his courage seeming queint,<br>
 Strooke him so hugely, that through great constraint<br>
 He made him stoup perforce vnto his knee,<br>
 And do vnwilling worship to the Saint,<br>
 That on his shield depainted he did see;<br>
 Such homage till that instant neuer learned hee.</p><p>
  
 Whom <i>Guyon</i> seeing stoup, pursewed fast<br>
 The present offer of faire victory.<br>
 And soone his dreadfull blade about he cast,<br>
 Wherewith he smote his haughty crest so hye,<br>
 That streight on ground made him full low to lye;<br>
 Then on his brest his victour foote he thrust:<br>
 With that he cryde, Mercy, do me not dye,<br>
 Ne deeme thy force by fortunes doome vniust,<br>
 That hath (maugre her spight) thus low me laid in dust.</p><p>
  
 Eftsoones his cruell hand Sir <i>Guyon</i> stayd,<br>
 Tempring the passion with aduizement slow,<br>
 And maistring might on enimy dismayd:<br>
 For th'equall dye of warre he well did know;<br>
 Then to him said, Liue and allegaunce owe,<br>
 To him that giues thee life and libertie,<br>
 And henceforth by this dayes ensample trow,<br>
 That hasty wroth, and heedlesse hazardrie,<br>
 Do breede repentaunce late, and lasting infamie.</p><p>
  
 So vp he let him rise, who with grim looke<br>
 And count'naunce sterne vpstanding, gan to grind<br>
 His grated teeth for great disdeigne, and shooke<br>
 His sandy lockes, long hanging downe behind,<br>
 Knotted in bloud and dust, for griefe of mind,<br>
 That he in ods of armes was conquered;<br>
 Yet in himselfe some comfort he did find,<br>
 That him so noble knight had maistered,<br>
 Whose bounty more then might, yet both he wondered.</p><p>
  
 Which <i>Guyon</i> marking said, Be nought agrieu'd,<br>
 Sir Knight, that thus ye now subdewed arre:<br>
 Was neuer man, who most conquestes atchieu'd<br>
 But sometimes had the worse, and lost by warre,<br>
 Yet shortly gaynd, that losse exceeded farre:<br>
 Losse is no shame, nor to be lesse then foe,<br>
 But to be lesser, then himselfe, doth marre<br>
 Both loosers lot, and victours prayse alsoe.<br>
 Vaine others ouerthrowes, who selfe doth ouerthrowe.</p><p>
  
 Fly, O <i>Pyrrochles</i>, fly the dreadfull warre,<br>
 That in thy selfe thy lesser parts do moue,<br>
 Outrageous anger, and woe-working iarre,<br>
 Direfull impatience, and hart murdring loue;<br>
 Those, those thy foes, those warriours far remoue,<br>
 Which thee to endlesse bale captiued lead.<br>
 But sith in might thou didst my mercy proue,<br>
 Of curtesie to me the cause a read,<br>
 That thee against me drew with so impetuous dread.</p><p>
  
 Dreadlesse (said he) that shall I soone declare:<br>
 It was complaind, that thou hadst done great tort<br>
 Vnto an aged woman, poore and bare,<br>
 And thralled her in chaines with strong effort,<br>
 Voide of all succour and needfull comfort:<br>
 That ill beseemes thee, such as I thee see,<br>
 To worke such shame.  Therefore I thee exhort,<br>
 To chaunge thy will, and set <i>Occasion</i> free,<br>
 And to her captiue sonne yield his first libertee.</p><p>
  
 Thereat Sir <i>Guyon</i> smilde, And is that all<br>
 (Said he) that thee so sore displeased hath?<br>
 Great mercy sure, for to enlarge a thrall,<br>
 Whose freedome shall thee turne to greatest scath.<br>
 Nath'lesse now quench thy whot emboyling wrath:<br>
 Loe there they be; to thee I yield them free.<br>
 Thereat he wondrous glad, out of the path<br>
 Did lightly leape, where he them bound did see,<br>
 And gan to breake the bands of their captiuitee.</p><p>
  
 Soone as <i>Occasion</i> felt her selfe vntyde,<br>
 Before her sonne could well assoyled bee,<br>
 She to her vse returnd, and streight defyde<br>
 Both <i>Guyon</i> and <i>Pyrrochles</i>: th'one (said shee)<br>
 Bycause he wonne; the other because hee<br>
 Was wonne: So matter did she make of nought,<br>
 To stirre vp strife, and do them disagree;<br>
 But soone as <i>Furor</i> was enlargd, she sought<br>
 To kindle his quencht fire, and thousand causes wrought.</p><p>
  
 It was not long, ere she inflam'd him so,<br>
 That he would algates with <i>Pyrrochles</i> fight,<br>
 And his redeemer chalengd for his foe,<br>
 Because he had not well mainteind his right,<br>
 But yielded had to that same straunger knight:<br>
 Now gan <i>Pyrrochles</i> wex as wood, as hee,<br>
 And him affronted with impatient might:<br>
 So both together fiers engrasped bee,<br>
 Whiles <i>Guyon</i> standing by, their vncouth strife does see.</p><p>
  
 Him all that while <i>Occasion</i> did prouoke<br>
 Against <i>Pyrrochles</i>, and new matter framed<br>
 Vpon the old, him stirring to be wroke<br>
 Of his late wrongs, in which she oft him blamed<br>
 For suffering such abuse, as knighhood shamed,<br>
 And him dishabled quite.  But he was wise<br>
 Ne would with vaine occasions be inflamed;<br>
 Yet others she more vrgent did deuise:<br>
 Yet nothing could him to impatience entise.</p><p>
  
 Their fell contention still increased more,<br>
 And more thereby increased <i>Furors</i> might,<br>
 That he his foe has hurt, and wounded sore,<br>
 And him in bloud and durt deformed quight.<br>
 His mother eke, more to augment his spight,<br>
 Now brought to him a flaming fire brond,<br>
 Which she in <i>Stygian</i> lake, ay burning bright,<br>
 Had kindled: that she gaue into his hond,<br>
 That armd with fire, more hardly he mote him withstõd.</p><p>
  
 Tho gan that villein wex so fiers and strong,<br>
 That nothing might sustaine his furious forse;<br>
 He cast him downe to ground, and all along<br>
 Drew him through durt and myre without remorse,<br>
 And fowly battered his comely corse,<br>
 That <i>Guyon</i> much disdeignd so loathly sight.<br>
 At last he was compeld to cry perforse,<br>
 Helpe, ô Sir <i>Guyon</i>, helpe most noble knight,<br>
 To rid a wretched man from hands of hellish wight.</p><p>
  
 The knight was greatly moued at his plaint,<br>
 And gan him dight to succour his distresse,<br>
 Till that the Palmer, by his graue restraint,<br>
 Him stayd from yielding pitifull redresse;<br>
 And said, Deare sonne, thy causelesse ruth represse,<br>
 Ne let thy stout hart melt in pitty vayne:<br>
 He that his sorrow sought through wilfulnesse,<br>
 And his foe fettred would release agayne,<br>
 Deserues to tast his follies fruit, repented payne.</p><p>
  
 <i>Guyon</i> obayd; So him away he drew<br>
 From needlesse trouble of renewing fight<br>
 Already fought, his voyage to pursew.<br>
 But rash <i>Pyrrochles</i> varlet, <i>Atin</i> hight,<br>
 When late he saw his Lord in heauy plight,<br>
 Vnder Sir <i>Guyons</i> puissaunt stroke to fall,<br>
 Him deeming dead, as then he seemd in sight,<br>
 Fled fast away, to tell his funerall<br>
 Vnto his brother, whom <i>Cymochles</i> men did call.</p><p>
  
 He was a man of rare redoubted might,<br>
 Famous throughout the world for warlike prayse,<br>
 And glorious spoiles, purchast in perilous fight:<br>
 Full many doughtie knights he in his dayes<br>
 Had doen to death, subdewde in equall frayes,<br>
 Whose carkases, for terrour of his name,<br>
 Of fowles and beastes he made the piteous prayes,<br>
 And hong their conquered armes for more defame<br>
 On gallow trees, in honour of his dearest Dame.</p><p>
  
 His dearest Dame is that Enchaunteresse,<br>
 The vile <i>Acrasia</i>, that with vaine delightes,<br>
 And idle pleasures in his[her] <i>Bowre</i> of <i>Blisse</i>,<br>
 Does charme her louers, and the feeble sprightes<br>
 Can call out of the bodies of fraile wightes:<br>
 Whom then she does transforme to mõstrous hewes,<br>
 And horribly misshapes with vgly sightes,<br>
 Captiu'd eternally in yron mewes,<br>
 And darksom dens, where <i>Titan</i> his face neuer shewes.</p><p>
  
 There <i>Atin</i> found <i>Cymochles</i> soiourning,<br>
 To serue his Lemans loue: for he, by kind,<br>
 Was giuen all to lust and loose liuing,<br>
 When euer his fiers hands he free mote find:<br>
 And now he has pourd out his idle mind<br>
 In daintie delices, and lauish ioyes,<br>
 Hauing his warlike weapons cast behind,<br>
 And flowes in pleasures, and vaine pleasing toyes,<br>
 Mingled emongst loose Ladies and lasciuious boyes.</p><p>
  
 And ouer him, art striuing to compaire<br>
 With nature, did an Arber greene dispred,<br>
 Framed of wanton Yuie, flouring faire,<br>
 Through which the fragrant Eglantine did spred<br>
 His pricking armes, entrayld with roses red,<br>
 Which daintie odours round about them threw,<br>
 And all within with flowres was garnished,<br>
 That when myld <i>Zephyrus</i> emongst them blew,<br>
 Did breath out bounteous smels, &amp; painted colors shew.</p><p>
  
 And fast beside, there trickled softly downe<br>
 A gentle streame, whose murmuring waue did play<br>
 Emongst the pumy stones, and made a sowne,<br>
 To lull him soft a sleepe, that by it lay;<br>
 The wearie Traueiler, wandring that way,<br>
 Therein did often quench his thristy heat,<br>
 And then by it his wearie limbes display,<br>
 Whiles creeping slomber made him to forget<br>
 His former paine, and wypt away his toylsoms weat.</p><p>
  
 And on the other side a pleasaunt groue<br>
 Was shot vp high, full of the stately tree,<br>
 That dedicated is t'<i>Olympicke Ioue</i>,<br>
 And to his sonne <i>Alcides</i>, whenas hee<br>
 Gaynd in <i>Nemea</i> goodly victoree;<br>
 Therein the mery birds of euery sort<br>
 Chaunted alowd their chearefull harmonie:<br>
 And made emongst them selues a sweet consort,<br>
 That quickned the dull spright with musicall comfort.</p><p>
  
 There he him found all carelesly displayd,<br>
 In secret shadow from the sunny ray,<br>
 On a sweet bed of lillies softly layd,<br>
 Amidst a flocke of Damzels fresh and gay,<br>
 That round about him dissolute did play<br>
 Their wanton follies, and light meriment;<br>
 Euery of which did loosely disaray<br>
 Her vpper parts of meet habiliments,<br>
 And shewd them naked, deckt with many ornaments.</p><p>
  
 And euery of them stroue, with most delights,<br>
 Him to aggrate, and greatest pleasures shew;<br>
 Some framd faire lookes, glancing like euening lights,<br>
 Others sweet words, dropping like honny dew;<br>
 Some bathed kisses, and did soft embrew,<br>
 The sugred licour through his melting lips:<br>
 One boastes her beautie, and does yeeld to vew<br>
 Her daintie limbes aboue her tender hips,<br>
 Another her out boastes, and all for tryall strips.</p><p>
  
 He, like an Adder, lurking in the weeds,<br>
 His wandring thought in deepe desire does steepe,<br>
 And his fraile eye with spoyle of beautie feedes;<br>
 Sometimes he falsely faines himselfe to sleepe,<br>
 Whiles through their lids his wanton eies do peepe,<br>
 To steale a snatch of amorous conceipt,<br>
 Whereby close fire into his heart does creepe:<br>
 So, them deceiues, deceiu'd in his deceipt,<br>
 Made drunke with drugs of deare voluptuous receipt.</p><p>
  
 <i>Atin</i> arriuing there, when him he spide,<br>
 Thus in still waues of deepe delight to wade,<br>
 Fiercely approching, to him lowdly cride,<br>
 <i>Cymochles</i>; oh no, but <i>Cymochles</i> shade,<br>
 In which that manly person late did fade,<br>
 What is become of great <i>Acrates</i> sonne?<br>
 Or where hath he hong vp his mortall blade,<br>
 That hath so many haughtie conquests wonne?<br>
 Is all his force forlorne, and all his glory donne?</p><p>
  
 Then pricking him with his sharpe-pointed dart,<br>
 He said? Vp, vp, thou womanish weake knight,<br>
 That here in Ladies lap entombed art,<br>
 Vnmindfull of thy praise and prowest might,<br>
 And weetlesse eke of lately wrought despight,<br>
 Whiles sad <i>Pyrrochles</i> lies on senselesse ground,<br>
 And groneth out his vtmost grudging spright,<br>
 Through many a stroke, &amp; many a streaming wound,<br>
 Calling thy helpe in vaine, that here in ioyes art dround.</p><p>
  
 Suddeinly out of his delightfull dreame<br>
 The man awoke, and would haue questiond more;<br>
 But he would not endure that wofull theame<br>
 For to dilate at large, but vrged sore<br>
 With percing words, and pittifull implore,<br>
 Him hastie to arise.  As one affright<br>
 With hellish feends, or <i>Furies</i> mad vprore,<br>
 He then vprose, inflam'd with fell despight,<br>
 And called for his armes; for he would algates fight.</p><p>
  
 They bene ybrought; he quickly does him dight,<br>
 And lightly mounted, passeth on his way,<br>
 Ne Ladies loues, ne sweete entreaties might<br>
 Appease his heat, or hastie passage stay;<br>
 For he has vowd, to beene aueng'd that day,<br>
 (That day it selfe him seemed all too long:)<br>
 On him, that did <i>Pyrrochles</i> deare dismay:<br>
 So proudly pricketh on his courser strong,<br>
 And <i>Atin</i> aie him pricks with spurs of shame &amp; wrong.</p><p>
