 </p><p> 
 </p><blockquote> 
  
  
 <i>The knight with that old Dragon fights<br> 
 two dayes incessantly:<br>  
 The third him ouerthrowes, and gayns<br> 
 most glorious victory. </i><p> 
 </p></blockquote> 
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>     
 HIgh time now gan it wex for <i>Vna 
 faire,</i><br>
 To thinke of those her captiue Parents deare,<br>
 And their forwasted kingdome to repaire:<br>
 Whereto whenas they now approched neare,<br>
 With hartie words her knight she gan to cheare,<br>
 And in her modest manner thus bespake;<br>
 Deare knight, as deare, as euer knight was deare,<br>
 That all these sorrowes suffer for my sake,<br>
 High heauen behold the tedious toyle, ye for me take.<p>
  
 Now are we come vnto my natiue soyle,<br>
 And to the place, where all our perils dwell;<br>
 Here haunts that feend, and does his dayly spoyle,<br>
 Therefore henceforth be at your keeping well,<br>
 And euer ready for your foeman fell.<br>
 The sparke of noble courage now awake,<br>
 And striue your excellent selfe to excell;<br>
 That shall ye euermore renowmed make,<br>
 Aboue all knights on earth, that batteill vndertake.</p><p>
  
 And pointing forth, lo yonder is (said she)<br>
 The brasen towre in which my parents deare<br>
 For dread of that huge feend emprisond be<br>
 Whom I from far see on the walles appeare<br>
 Whose sight my feeble soule doth greatly cheare:<br>
 And on the top of all I do espye<br>
 The watchman wayting tydings glad to heare,<br>
 That ô my parents might I happily<br>
 Vnto you bring, to ease you of your misery.</p><p>
  
 With that they heard a roaring hideous sound,<br>
 That all the ayre with terrour filled wide,<br>
 And seemd vneath to shake the stedfast ground.<br>
 Eftsoones that dreadfull Dragon they espide,<br>
 Where stretcht he lay vpon the sunny side<br>
 Of a great hill, himselfe like a great hill.<br>
 But all so soone, as he from far descride<br>
 Those glistring armes, that heauen with light did fill,<br>
 He rousd himselfe full blith, and hastned them vntill.</p><p>
  
 Then bad the knight his Lady yede aloofe,<br>
 And to an hill her selfe with draw aside,<br>
 From whence she might behold that battailles proof<br>
 And eke be safe from daunger far descryde:<br>
 She him obayd, and turnd a little wyde.<br>
 Now O thou sacred Muse, most learned Dame,<br>
 Faire ympe of <i>Phoebus</i>, and his aged bride,<br>
 The Nourse of time, and euerlasting fame,<br>
 That warlike hands ennoblest with immortall name;</p><p>
  
 O gently come into my feeble brest,<br>
 Come gently, but not with that mighty rage,<br>
 Wherewith the martiall troupes thou doest infest,<br>
 And harts of great Heroës doest enrage,<br>
 That nought their kindled courage may aswage,<br>
 Soone as thy dreadfull trompe begins to sownd;<br>
 The God of warre with his fiers equipage<br>
 Thou doest awake, sleepe neuer he so sownd,<br>
 And scared nations doest with horrour sterne astownd.</p><p>
  
 Faire Goddesse lay that furious fit aside,<br>
 Till I of warres and bloudy <i>Mars</i> do sing,<br>
 And Briton fields with Sarazin bloud bedyde,<br>
 Twixt that great faery Queene and Paynim king,<br>
 That with their horrour heauen and earth did ring,<br>
 A worke of labour long, and endlesse prayse:<br>
 But now a while let downe that haughtie string,<br>
 And to my tunes thy second tenor rayse,<br>
 That I this man of God his godly armes may blaze.</p><p>
  
 By this the dreadfull Beast drew nigh to hand,<br>
 Halfe flying, and halfe footing in his hast,<br>
 That with his largenesse measured much land,<br>
 And made wide shadow vnder his huge wast;<br>
 As mountaine doth the valley ouercast.<br>
 Approching nigh, he reared high afore<br>
 His body monstrous, horrible, and vast,<br>
 Which to increase his wondrous greatnesse more,<br>
 Was swolne with wrath, &amp; poyson, &amp; with bloudy gore.</p><p>
  
 And ouer, all with brasen scales was armd,<br>
 Like plated coate of steele, so couched neare,<br>
 That nought mote perce, ne might his corse be harmd<br>
 With dint of sword, nor push of pointed speare;<br>
 Which as an Eagle, seeing pray appeare,<br>
 His aery plumes doth rouze, full rudely dight,<br>
 So shaked he, that horrour was to heare,<br>
 For as the clashing of an Armour bright,<br>
 Such noyse his rouzed scales did send vnto the knight.</p><p>
  
 His flaggy wings when forth he did display,<br>
 Were like two sayles, in which the hollow wynd<br>
 Is gathered full, and worketh speedy way:<br>
 And eke the pennes, that did his pineons bynd,<br>
 Were like mayne-yards, with flying canuas lynd,<br>
 With which whenas him list the ayre to beat,<br>
 And there by force vnwonted passage find,<br>
 The cloudes before him fled for terrour great,<br>
 And all the heauens stood still amazed with his threat.</p><p>
  
 His huge long tayle wound vp in hundred foldes,<br>
 Does ouerspred his long bras-scaly backe,<br>
 Whose wreathed boughts when euer he vnfoldes,<br>
 And thicke entangled knots adown does slacke.<br>
 Bespotted all with shields of red and blacke,<br>
 It sweepeth all the land behind him farre,<br>
 And of three furlongs does but litle lacke;<br>
 And at the point two stings in-fixed arre,<br>
 Both deadly sharpe, that sharpest steele exceeden farre.</p><p>
  
 But stings and sharpest steele did far exceed<br>
 The sharpnesse of his cruell rending clawes;<br>
 Dead was it sure, as sure as death in deed,<br>
 What euer thing does touch his rauenous pawes,<br>
 Or what within his reach he euer drawes.<br>
 But his most hideous head my toung to tell<br>
 Does tremble: for his deepe deuouring iawes<br>
 Wide gaped, like the griesly mouth of hell,<br>
 Through which into his darke abisse all rauin fell.</p><p>
  
 And that more wondrous was, in either iaw<br>
 Three ranckes of yron teeth enraunged were,<br>
 In which yet trickling bloud and gobbets raw<br>
 Of late deuoured bodies did appeare,<br>
 That sight thereof bred cold congealed feare:<br>
 Which to increase, and as atonce to kill,<br>
 A cloud of smoothering smoke and sulphur seare<br>
 Out of his stinking gorge forth steemed still,<br>
 That all the ayre about with smoke and stench did fill.</p><p>
  
 His blazing eyes, like two bright shining shields,<br>
 Did burne with wrath, and sparkled liuing fyre;<br>
 As two broad Beacons, set in open fields,<br>
 Send forth their flames farre off to euery shyre,<br>
 And warning giue, that enemies conspyre,<br>
 With fire and sword the region to inuade;<br>
 So flam'd his eyne with rage and rancorous yre:<br>
 But farre within, as in a hollow glade,<br>
 Those glaring lampes were set, that made a dreadfull shade.</p><p>
  
 So dreadfully he towards him did pas,<br>
 Forelifting vp aloft his speckled brest,<br>
 And often bounding on the brused gras,<br>
 As for great ioyance of his newcome guest.<br>
 Eftsoones he gan aduance his haughtie crest,<br>
 As chauffed Bore his bristles doth vpreare,<br>
 And shoke his scales to battell readie drest;<br>
 That made the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight nigh quake for feare,<br>
 As bidding bold defiance to his foeman neare.</p><p>
  
 The knight gan fairely couch his steadie speare,<br>
 And fiercely ran at him with rigorous might:<br>
 The pointed steele arriuing rudely theare,<br>
 His harder hide would neither perce, nor bight,<br>
 But glauncing by forth passed forward right;<br>
 Yet sore amoued with so puissant push,<br>
 The wrathfull beast about him turned light,<br>
 And him so rudely passing by, did brush<br>
 With his long tayle, that horse and man to ground did rush.</p><p>
  
 Both horse and man vp lightly rose againe,<br>
 And fresh encounter towards him addrest:<br>
 But th'idle stroke yet backe recoyld in vaine,<br>
 And found no place his deadly point to rest.<br>
 Exceeding rage enflam'd the furious beast,<br>
 To be auenged of so great despight;<br>
 For neuer felt his imperceable brest<br>
 So wondrous force, from hand of liuing wight;<br>
 Yet had he prou'd the powre of many a puissant knight.</p><p>
  
 Then with his wauing wings displayed wyde,<br>
 Himselfe vp high he lifted from the ground,<br>
 And with strong flight did forcibly diuide<br>
 The yielding aire, which nigh too feeble found<br>
 Her flitting partes, and element vnsound,<br>
 To beare so great a weight: he cutting way<br>
 With his broad sayles, about him soared round:<br>
 At last low stouping with vnweldie sway,<br>
 Snatcht vp both horse &amp; man, to beare them quite away.</p><p>
  
 Long he them bore aboue the subiect plaine,<br>
 So farre as Ewghen bow a shaft may send,<br>
 Till struggling strong did him at last constraine,<br>
 To let them downe before his flightes end:<br>
 As hagard hauke presuming to contend<br>
 With hardie fowle, aboue his hable might,<br>
 His wearie pounces all in vaine doth spend,<br>
 To trusse the pray too heauie for his flight;<br>
 Which comming downe to ground, does free it selfe by fight.</p><p>
  
 He so disseized of his gryping grosse,<br>
 The knight his thrillant speare againe assayd<br>
 In his bras-plated body to embosse,<br>
 And three mens strength vnto the stroke he layd;<br>
 Wherewith the stiffe beame quaked, as affrayd,<br>
 And glauncing from his scaly necke, did glyde<br>
 Close vnder his left wing, then broad displayd.<br>
 The percing steele there wrought a wound full wyde,<br>
 That with the vncouth smart the Monster lowdly cryde.</p><p>
  
 He cryde, as raging seas are wont to rore,<br>
 When wintry storme his wrathfull wreck does threat,<br>
 The rolling billowes beat the ragged shore,<br>
 As they the earth would shoulder from her seat,<br>
 And greedie gulfe does gape, as he would eat<br>
 His neighbour element in his reuenge:<br>
 Then gin the blustring brethren boldly threat,<br>
 To moue the world from off his stedfast henge,<br>
 And boystrous battell make, each other to auenge.</p><p>
  
 The steely head stucke fast still in his flesh,<br>
 Till with his cruell clawes he snatcht the wood,<br>
 And quite a sunder broke. Forth flowed fresh<br>
 A gushing riuer of blacke goarie blood,<br>
 That drowned all the land, whereon he stood;<br>
 The streame thereof would driue a water-mill.<br>
 Trebly augmented was his furious mood<br>
 With bitter sense of his deepe rooted ill,<br>
 That flames of fire he threw forth frõ his large nosethrill.</p><p>
  
 His hideous tayle then hurled he about,<br>
 And therewith all enwrapt the nimble thyes<br>
 Of his froth-fomy steed, whose courage stout<br>
 Striuing to loose the knot, that fast him tyes,<br>
 Himselfe in streighter bandes too rash implyes,<br>
 That to the ground he is perforce constraynd<br>
 To throw his rider: who can quickly ryse<br>
 From off the earth, with durty bloud distaynd,<br>
 For that reprochfull fall right fowly he disdaynd.</p><p>
  
 And fiercely tooke his trenchand blade in hand,<br>
 With which he stroke so furious and so fell,<br>
 That nothing seemd the puissance could withstand:<br>
 Vpon his crest the hardned yron fell,<br>
 But his more hardned crest was armd so well,<br>
 That deeper dint therein it would not make;<br>
 Yet so extremely did the buffe him quell,<br>
 That from thenceforth he shund the like to take,<br>
 But when he saw them come, he did them still forsake.</p><p>
  
 The knight was wrath to see his stroke beguyld,<br>
 And smote againe with more outrageous might;<br>
 But backe againe the sparckling steele recoyld,<br>
 And left not any marke, where it did light;<br>
 As if in Adamant rocke it had bene pight.<br>
 The beast impatient of his smarting wound,<br>
 And of so fierce and forcible despight,<br>
 Thought with his wings to stye aboue the ground;<br>
 But his late wounded wing vnseruiceable found.</p><p>
  
 Then full of griefe and anguish vehement,<br>
 He lowdly brayd, that like was neuer heard,<br>
 And from his wide deuouring ouen sent<br>
 A flake of fire, that flashing in his beard,<br>
 Him all amazd, and almost made affeard:<br>
 The scorching flame sore swinged all his face,<br>
 And through his armour all his bodie seard,<br>
 That he could not endure so cruell cace,<br>
 But thought his armes to leaue, and helmet to vnlace.</p><p>
  
 Not that great Champion of the antique world,<br>
 Whom famous Poetes verse so much doth vaunt,<br>
 And hath for twelue huge labours high extold,<br>
 So many furies and sharpe fits did haunt,<br>
 When him the poysoned garment did enchaunt<br>
 With <i>Centaures</i> bloud, and bloudie verses charm'd,<br>
 As did this knight twelue thousand dolours daunt,<br>
 Whom fyrie steele now burnt, that earst him arm'd,<br>
 That erst him goodly arm'd, now most of all him harm'd.</p><p>
  
 Faint, wearie, sore, emboyled, grieued, brent<br>
 With heat, toyle, wounds, armes, smart, &amp; inward fire<br>
 That neuer man such mischiefes did torment;<br>
 Death better were, death did he oft desire,<br>
 But death will neuer come, when needes require.<br>
 Whom so dismayd when that his foe beheld,<br>
 He cast to suffer him no more respire,<br>
 But gan his sturdie sterne about to weld,<br>
 And him so strongly stroke, that to the ground him feld.</p><p>
  
 It fortuned (as faire it then befell)<br>
 Behind his backe vnweeting, where he stood,<br>
 Of auncient time there was a springing well,<br>
 From which fast trickled forth a siluer flood,<br>
 Full of great vertues, and for med'cine good.<br>
 Whylome, before that cursed Dragon got<br>
 That happie land, and all with innocent blood<br>
 Defyld those sacred waues, it rightly hot<br>
 <i>The well of life</i>, ne yet his vertues had forgot.</p><p>
  
 For vnto life the dead it could restore,<br>
 And guilt of sinfull crimes cleane wash away,<br>
 Those that with sicknesse were infected sore,<br>
 It could recure, and aged long decay<br>
 Renew, as one were borne that very day.<br>
 Both <i>Silo</i> this, and <i>Iordan</i> did excell,<br>
 And th'English <i>Bath</i>, and eke the german <i>Spau</i>,<br>
 Ne can <i>Cephise</i>, nor <i>Hebrus</i> match this well:<br>
 Into the same the knight backe ouerthrowen, fell.</p><p>
  
 Now gan the golden <i>Phoebus</i> for to steepe<br>
 His fierie face in billowes of the west,<br>
 And his faint steedes watred in Ocean deepe,<br>
 Whiles from their iournall labours they did rest,<br>
 When that infernall Monster, hauing kest<br>
 His wearie foe into that liuing well,<br>
 Can high aduance his broad discoloured brest,<br>
 Aboue his wonted pitch, with countenance fell,<br>
 And clapt his yron wings, as victor he did dwell.</p><p>
  
 Which when his pensiue Ladie saw from farre,<br>
 Great woe and sorrow did her soule assay,<br>
 As weening that the sad end of the warre,<br>
 And gan to highest God entirely pray,<br>
 That feared chance from her to turne away;<br>
 With folded hands and knees full lowly bent<br>
 All night she watcht, ne once adowne would lay<br>
 Her daintie limbs in her sad dreriment,<br>
 But praying still did wake, and waking did lament.</p><p>
  
 The morrow next gan early to appeare,<br>
 That <i>Titan</i> rose to runne his daily race:<br>
 But early ere the morrow next gan reare<br>
 Out of the sea faire <i>Titans</i> deawy face,<br>
 Vp rose the gentle virgin from her place,<br>
 And looked all about, if she might spy<br>
 Her loued knight to moue his manly pace:<br>
 For she had great doubt of his safety,<br>
 Since late she saw him fall before his enemy.</p><p>
  
 At last she where he vpstarted braue<br>
 Out of the well, wherein he drenched lay;<br>
 As Eagle fresh out of the Ocean waue,<br>
 Where he hath left his plumes all hoary gray,<br>
 And deckt himselfe with feathers youthly gay,<br>
 Like Eyas hauke vp mounts vnto the skies,<br>
 His newly budded pineons to assay,<br>
 And marueiles at himselfe, still as he flies:<br>
 So new this new-borne knight to battell new did rise.</p><p>
  
 Whom when the damned feend so fresh did spy,<br>
 No wonder if he wondred at the sight,<br>
 And doubted, whether his late enemy<br>
 It were, or other new supplied knight.<br>
 He, now to proue his late renewed might,<br>
 High brandishing his bright deaw-burning blade,<br>
 Vpon his crested scalpe so sore did smite,<br>
 That to the scull a yawning wound it made:<br>
 The deadly dint his dulled senses all dismaid.</p><p>
  
 I wote not, whether the reuenging steele<br>
 Were hardned with that holy water dew,<br>
 Wherein he fell, or sharper edge did feele,<br>
 Or his baptized hands now greater grew;<br>
 Or other secret vertue did ensew;<br>
 Else neuer could the force of fleshly arme,<br>
 Ne molten mettall in his bloud embrew:<br>
 For till that stownd could neuer wight him harme,<br>
 By subtilty, nor slight, nor might, nor mighty charme.</p><p>
  
 The cruell wound enraged him so sore,<br>
 That loud he yelded for exceeding paine;<br>
 As hundred ramping Lyons seem'd to rore,<br>
 Whom rauenous hunger did thereto constraine:<br>
 Then gan he tosse aloft his stretched traine,<br>
 And therewith scourge the buxome aire so sore,<br>
 That to his force to yeelden it was faine;<br>
 Ne ought his sturdie strokes might stand afore,<br>
 That high trees ouerthrew, and rocks in peeces tore.</p><p>
  
 The same aduauncing high aboue his head,<br>
 With sharpe intended sting so rude him smot,<br>
 That to the earth him droue, as stricken dead,<br>
 Ne liuing wight would haue him life behot:<br>
 The mortall sting his angry needle shot<br>
 Quite through his shield, and in his shoulder seasd,<br>
 Where fast it stucke, ne would there out be got:<br>
 The griefe thereof him wondrous sore diseasd,<br>
 Ne might his ranckling paine with patience be appeasd.</p><p>
  
 But yet more mindfull of his honour deare,<br>
 Then of the grieuous smart, which him did wring,<br>
 From loathed soile he can him lightly reare,<br>
 And stroue to loose the farre infixed sting:<br>
 Which when in vaine he tryde with struggeling.<br>
 Inflam'd with wrath, his raging blade he heft,<br>
 And.strooke so strongly, that the knotty string<br>
 Of his huge taile he quite a sunder cleft,<br>
 Fiue ioynts thereof he hewd, and but the stump him left.</p><p>
  
 Hart cannot thinke, what outrage, and what cryes,<br>
 With foule enfouldred smoake and flashing fire,<br>
 The hell-bred beast threw forth vnto the skyes,<br>
 That all was couered with darknesse dire:<br>
 Then fraught with rancour, and engorged ire,<br>
 He cast at once him to auenge for all,<br>
 And gathering vp himselfe out of the mire,<br>
 With his vneuen wings did fiercely fall<br>
 Vpon his sunne-bright shield, and gript it fast withall.</p><p>
  
 Much was the man encombred with his hold,<br>
 In feare to lose his weapon in his paw,<br>
 Ne wist yet, how his talants to vnfold;<br>
 Nor harder was from <i>Cerberus</i> greedie iaw<br>
 To plucke a bone, then from his cruell claw<br>
 To reaue by strength the griped gage away:<br>
 Thrise he assayd it from his foot to draw,<br>
 And thrise in vaine to draw it did assay,<br>
 It booted nought to thinke, to robbe him of his pray.</p><p>
  
 Tho when he saw no power might preuaile,<br>
 His trustie sword he cald to his last aid,<br>
 Wherewith he fiercely did his foe assaile,<br>
 And double blowes about him stoutly laid,<br>
 That glauncing fire out of the yron plaid;<br>
 As sparckles from the Anduile vse to fly,<br>
 When heauie hammers on the wedge are swaid;<br>
 Therewith at last he forst him to vnty<br>
 One of his grasping feete, him to defend thereby.</p><p>
  
 The other foot, fast fixed on his shield,<br>
 Whenas no strength, nor stroks mote him constraine<br>
 To loose, ne yet the warlike pledge to yield,<br>
 He smot thereat with all his might and maine,<br>
 That nought so wondrous puissance might sustaine;<br>
 Vpon the ioynt the lucky steele did light,<br>
 And made such way, that hewd it quite in twaine;<br>
 The paw yet missed not his minisht might,<br>
 But hong still on the shield, as it at first was pight.</p><p>
  
 For griefe thereof, and diuelish despight,<br>
 From his infernall fournace forth he threw<br>
 Huge flames, that dimmed all the heauens light,<br>
 Enrold in duskish smoke and brimstone blew;<br>
 As burning <i>Aetna</i> from his boyling stew<br>
 Doth belch out flames, and rockes in peeces broke,<br>
 And ragged ribs of mountaines molten new,<br>
 Enwrapt in coleblacke clouds and filthy smoke,<br>
 That all the land with stench, and heauen with horror choke.</p><p>
  
 The heate whereof, and harmefull pestilence<br>
 So sore him noyd, that forst him to retire<br>
 A little backward for his best defence,<br>
 To saue his bodie from the scorching fire,<br>
 Which he from hellish entrailes did expire.<br>
 It chaunst (eternall God that chaunce did guide)<br>
 As he recoyled backward, in the mire<br>
 His nigh forwearied feeble feet did slide,<br>
 And downe he fell, with dread of shame sore terrifide.</p><p>
  
 There grew a goodly tree him faire beside,<br>
 Loaden with fruit and apples rosie red,<br>
 As they in pure vermilion had beene dide,<br>
 Whereof great vertues ouer all were red:<br>
 For happie life to all, which thereon fed,<br>
 And life eke euerlasting did befall:<br>
 Great God it planted in that blessed sted<br>
 With his almightie hand, and did it call<br>
 The tree of life, the crime of our first fathers fall.</p><p>
  
 In all the world like was not to be found,<br>
 Saue in that soile, where all good things did grow,<br>
 And freely sprong out of the fruitfull ground,<br>
 As incorrupted Nature did them sow,<br>
 Till that dread Dragon all did ouerthrow.<br>
 Another like faire tree eke grew thereby,<br>
 Whereof who so did eat, eftsoones did know<br>
 Both good and ill: O mornefull memory:<br>
 That tree through one mans fault hath doen vs all to dy.</p><p>
  
 From that first tree forth flowd, as from a well,<br>
 A trickling streame of Balme, most soueraine<br>
 And daintie deare, which on the ground still fell,<br>
 And ouerflowed all the fertill plaine,<br>
 As it had deawed bene with timely raine:<br>
 Life and long health that gratious ointment gaue,<br>
 And deadly woundes could heale, and reare againe<br>
 The senselesse corse appointed for the graue.<br>
 Into that same he fell: which did from death him saue.</p><p>
  
 For nigh thereto the euer damned beast<br>
 Durst not approch, for he was deadly made,<br>
 And all that life preserued, did detest:<br>
 Yet he it oft aduentur'd to inuade.<br>
 By this the drouping day-light gan to fade<br>
 And yeeld his roome to sad succeeding night,<br>
 Who with her sable mantle gan to shade<br>
 The face of earth, and wayes of liuing wight,<br>
 And high her burning torch set vp in heauen bright.</p><p>
  
 When gentle <i>Vna</i> saw the second fall<br>
 Of her deare knight, who wearie of long fight,<br>
 And faint through losse of bloud, mou'd not at all,<br>
 But lay as in a dreame of deepe delight,<br>
 Besmeard with pretious Balme, whose vertuous might<br>
 Did heale his wounds, and scorching heat alay,<br>
 Againe she stricken was with sore affright,<br>
 And for his safetie gan deuoutly pray;<br>
 And watch the noyous night, and wait for ioyous day.</p><p>
  
 The ioyous day gan early to appeare,<br>
 And faire <i>Aurora</i> from the deawy bed<br>
 Of aged <i>Tithone</i> gan her selfe to reare,<br>
 With rosie cheekes, for shame as blushing red;<br>
 Her golden lockes for haste were loosely shed<br>
 About her eares, when <i>Vna</i> her did marke<br>
 Clymbe to her charet, all with flowers spred;<br>
 From heauen high to chase the chearelesse darke,<br>
 With merry note her loud salutes the mounting larke.</p><p>
  
 Then freshly vp arose the doughtie knight,<br>
 All healed of his hurts and woundes wide,<br>
 And did himselfe to battell readie dight;<br>
 Whose early foe awaiting him beside<br>
 To haue deuourd, so soone as day he spyde,<br>
 When now he saw himselfe so freshly reare,<br>
 As if late fight had nought him damnifyde,<br>
 He woxe dismayd, and gan his fate to feare;<br>
 Nathlesse with wonted rage he him aduaunced neare.</p><p>
  
 And in his first encounter, gaping wide,<br>
 He thought attonce him to haue swallowd quight,<br>
 And rusht vpon him with outragious pride;<br>
 Who him r'encountring fierce, as hauke in flight,<br>
 Perforce rebutted backe. The weapon bright<br>
 Taking aduantage of his open iaw,<br>
 Ran through his mouth with so importune might,<br>
 That deepe emperst his darksome hollow maw,<br>
 And back retyrd, his life bloud forth with all did draw.</p><p>
  
 So downe he fell, and forth his life did breath,<br>
 That vanisht into smoke and cloudes swift;<br>
 So downe he fell, that th'earth him vnderneath<br>
 Did grone, as feeble so great load to lift;<br>
 So downe he fell, as an huge rockie clift,<br>
 Whose false foundation waues haue washt away,<br>
 With dreadfull poyse is from the mayneland rift,<br>
 And rolling downe, great <i>Neptune</i> doth dismay;<br>
 So downe he fell, and like an heaped mountaine lay.</p><p>
  
 The knight himselfe euen trembled at his fall,<br>
 So huge and horrible a masse it seem'd;<br>
 And his deare Ladie, that beheld it all,<br>
 Durst not approch for dread, which she misdeem'd,<br>
 But yet at last, when as the direfull feend<br>
 She saw not stirre, off-shaking vaine affright,<br>
 She nigher drew, and saw that ioyous end:<br>
 Then God she praysd, and thankt her faithfull knight,<br>
 That had atchieu'd so great a conquest by his might.</p><p>
