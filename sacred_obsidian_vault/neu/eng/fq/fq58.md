 <i>Talus brings newes to Britomart<br>
 of Artegals mishap,<br>
 She goes to seeke him, Dolon meetes<br>
 who seekes her to entrap.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 S
 Ome men, I wote, will deeme in <i>Artegall</i><br>
 Great weaknesse, and report of him much ill,<br>
 For yeelding so himselfe a wretched thrall,<br>
 To th'insolent commaund of womens will;<br>
 That all his former praise doth fowly spill.<br>
 But he the man, that say or doe so dare,<br>
 Be well aduiz'd, that he stand stedfast still:<br>
 For neuer yet was wight so well aware,<br>
 But he at first or last was trapt in womens snare.<p>
 
 Yet in the streightnesse of that captiue state,<br>
 This gentle knight himselfe so well behaued,<br>
 That notwithstanding all the subtill bait,<br>
 With which those Amazons his loue still craued,<br>
 To his owne loue his loialtie he saued:<br>
 Whose character in th'Adamantine mould<br>
 Of his true hart so firmely was engraued,<br>
 That no new loues impression euer could<br>
 Bereaue it thence: such blot his honour blemish should.</p><p>
 
 Yet his owne loue, the noble <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
 Scarse so conceiued in her iealous thought,<br>
 What time sad tydings of his balefull smart<br>
 In womans bondage, <i>Talus</i> to her brought;<br>
 Brought in vntimely houre, ere it was sought.<br>
 For after that the vtmost date, assynde<br>
 For his returne, she waited had for nought,<br>
 She gan to cast in her misdoubtfull mynde<br>
 A thousand feares, that loue-sicke fancies faine to fynde.</p><p>
 
 Sometime she feared, least some hard mishap<br>
 Had him misfalne in his aduenturous quest;<br>
 Sometime least his false foe did him entrap<br>
 In traytrous traine, or had vnwares opprest:<br>
 But most she did her troubled mynd molest,<br>
 And secretly afflict with iealous feare,<br>
 Least some new loue had him from her possest;<br>
 Yet loth she was, since she no ill did heare,<br>
 To thinke of him so ill: yet could she not forbeare.</p><p>
 
 One while she blam'd her selfe; another whyle<br>
 She him condemn'd, as trustlesse and vntrew:<br>
 And then, her griefe with errour to beguyle,<br>
 She fayn'd to count the time againe anew,<br>
 As if before she had not counted trew.<br>
 For houres but dayes; for weekes, that passed were,<br>
 She told but moneths, to make them seeme more few:<br>
 Yet when she reckned them, still drawing neare,<br>
 Each hour did seeme a moneth, &amp; euery moneth a yeare.</p><p>
 
 But when as yet she saw him not returne,<br>
 She thought to send some one to seeke him out;<br>
 But none she found so fit to serue that turne,<br>
 As her owne selfe, to ease her selfe of dout.<br>
 Now she deuiz'd amongst the warlike rout<br>
 Of errant Knights, to seeke her errant Knight;<br>
 And then againe resolu'd to hunt him out<br>
 Amongst loose Ladies, lapped in delight:<br>
 And then both Knights enuide, &amp; Ladies eke did spight.</p><p>
 
 One day, when as she long had sought for ease<br>
 In euery place, and euery place thought best,<br>
 Yet found no place, that could her liking please,<br>
 She to a window came, that opened West,<br>
 Towards which coast her loue his way addrest.<br>
 There looking forth, shee in her heart did find<br>
 Many vaine fancies, working her vnrest;<br>
 And sent her winged thoughts, more swift then wind,<br>
 To beare vnto her loue the message of her mind.</p><p>
 
 There as she looked long, at last she spide<br>
 One comming towards her with hasty speede:<br>
 Well weend she then, ere him she plaine descride,<br>
 That it was one sent from her loue indeede.<br>
 Who when he nigh approcht, shee mote arede<br>
 That it was <i>Talus</i>, <i>Artegall</i> his groome;<br>
 Whereat her heart was fild with hope and drede;<br>
 Ne would she stay, till he in place could come,<br>
 But ran to meete him forth, to know his tidings somme.</p><p>
 
 Euen in the dore him meeting, she begun;<br>
 And where is he thy Lord, and how far hence?<br>
 Declare at once; and hath he lost or wun?<br>
 The yron man, albe he wanted sence<br>
 And sorrowes feeling, yet with conscience<br>
 Of his ill newes, did inly chill and quake,<br>
 And stood still mute, as one in great suspence,<br>
 As if that by his silence he would make<br>
 Her rather reade his meaning, then him selfe it spake.</p><p>
 
 Till she againe thus sayd; <i>Talus</i> be bold,<br>
 And tell what euer it be, good or bad,<br>
 That from thy tongue thy hearts intent doth hold.<br>
 To whom he thus at length.  The tidings sad,<br>
 That I would hide, will needs, I see, be rad.<br>
 My Lord, your Loue, by hard mishap doth lie<br>
 In wretched bondage, wofully bestad.<br>
 Ay me (quoth she) what wicked destinie?<br>
 And is he vanquisht by his tyrant enemy?</p><p>
 
 Not by that Tyrant, his intended foe;<br>
 But by a Tyrannesse (he then replide,)<br>
 That him captiued hath in haplesse woe.<br>
 Cease thou bad newes-man, badly doest thou hide<br>
 Thy maisters shame, in harlots bondage tide.<br>
 The rest my selfe too readily can spell.<br>
 With that in rage she turn'd from him aside,<br>
 Forcing in vaine the rest to her to tell,<br>
 And to her chamber went like solitary cell.</p><p>
 
 There she began to make her monefull plaint<br>
 Against her Knight, for being so vntrew;<br>
 And him to touch with falshoods fowle attaint,<br>
 That all his other honour ouerthrew.<br>
 Oft did she blame her selfe, and often rew,<br>
 For yeelding to a straungers loue so light,<br>
 Whose life and manners straunge she neuer knew;<br>
 And euermore she did him sharpely twight<br>
 For breach of faith to her, which he had firmely plight.</p><p>
 
 And then she in her wrathfull will did cast,<br>
 How to reuenge that blot of honour blent;<br>
 To fight with him, and goodly die her last:<br>
 And then againe she did her selfe torment,<br>
 Inflicting on her selfe his punishment.<br>
 A while she walkt, and chauft; a while she threw<br>
 Her selfe vppon her bed, and did lament:<br>
 Yet did she not lament with loude alew,<br>
 As women wont, but with deepe sighes, and singulfs few.</p><p>
 
 Like as a wayward childe, whose sounder sleepe<br>
 Is broken with some fearefull dreames affright,<br>
 With froward will doth set him selfe to weepe;<br>
 Ne can be stild for all his nurses might,<br>
 But kicks, and squals, and shriekes for fell despight:<br>
 Now scratching her, and her loose locks misusing;<br>
 Now seeking darkenesse, and now seeking light;<br>
 Then crauing sucke, and then the sucke refusing.<br>
 Such was this Ladies fit, in her loues fond accusing.</p><p>
 
 But when she had with such vnquiet fits<br>
 Her selfe there close afflicted long in vaine,<br>
 Yet found no easement in her troubled wits,<br>
 She vnto <i>Talus</i> forth return'd againe,<br>
 By change of place seeking to ease her paine;<br>
 And gan enquire of him, with mylder mood,<br>
 The certaine cause of <i>Artegals</i> detaine;<br>
 And what he did, and in what state he stood,<br>
 And whether he did woo, or whether he were woo'd.</p><p>
 
 Ah wellaway (sayd then the yron man,)<br>
 That he is not the while in state to woo;<br>
 But lies in wretched thraldome, weake and wan,<br>
 Not by strong hand compelled thereunto,<br>
 But his owne doome, that none can now vndoo.<br>
 Sayd I not then (quoth shee) erwhile aright,<br>
 That this is things compacte betwixt you two,<br>
 Me to deceiue of faith vnto me plight,<br>
 Since that he was not forst, nor ouercome in fight?</p><p>
 
 With that he gan at large to her dilate<br>
 The whole discourse of his captiuance sad,<br>
 In sort as ye haue heard the same of late.<br>
 All which when she with hard enduraunce had<br>
 Heard to the end, she was right sore bestad,<br>
 With sodaine stounds of wrath and griefe attone:<br>
 Ne would abide, till she had aunswere made,<br>
 But streight her selfe did dight, and armor don;<br>
 And mounting to her steede, bad <i>Talus</i> guide her on.</p><p>
 
 So forth she rode vppon her ready way,<br>
 To seeke her Knight, as <i>Talus</i> her did guide:<br>
 Sadly she rode, and neuer word did say,<br>
 Nor good nor bad, ne euer lookt aside,<br>
 But still right downe, and in her thought did hide<br>
 The felnesse of her heart, right fully bent<br>
 To fierce auengement of that womans pride,<br>
 Which had her Lord in her base prison pent,<br>
 And so great honour with so fowle reproch had blent.</p><p>
 
 So as she thus melancholicke did ride,<br>
 Chawing the cud of griefe and inward paine,<br>
 She chaunst to meete toward th'euen-tide<br>
 A Knight, that softly paced on the plaine,<br>
 As if him selfe to solace he were faine.<br>
 Well shot in yeares he seem'd, and rather bent<br>
 To peace, then needlesse trouble to constraine.<br>
 As well by view of that his vestiment,<br>
 As by his modest semblant, that no euill ment.</p><p>
 
 He comming neare, gan gently her salute,<br>
 With curteous words, in the most comely wize;<br>
 Who though desirous rather to rest mute,<br>
 Then termes to entertaine of common guize,<br>
 Yet rather then she kindnesse would despize,<br>
 She would her selfe displease, so him requite.<br>
 Then gan the other further to deuize<br>
 Of things abrode, as next to hand did light,<br>
 And many things demaund, to which she answer'd light.</p><p>
 
 For little lust had she to talke of ought,<br>
 Or ought to heare, that mote delightfull bee;<br>
 Her minde was whole possessed of one thought,<br>
 That gaue none other place.  Which when as hee<br>
 By outward signes, (as well he might) did see,<br>
 He list no lenger to vse lothfull speach,<br>
 But her besought to take it well in gree,<br>
 Sith shady dampe had dimd the heauens reach,<br>
 To lodge with him that night, vnles good cause empeach.</p><p>
 
 The Championesse, now seeing night at dore,<br>
 Was glad to yeeld vnto his good request:<br>
 And with him went without gaine-saying more.<br>
 Not farre away, but little wide by West,<br>
 His dwelling was, to which he him addrest;<br>
 Where soone arriuing they receiued were<br>
 In seemely wise, as them beseemed best:<br>
 For he their host them goodly well did cheare,<br>
 And talk't of pleasant things, the night away to weare.</p><p>
 
 Thus passing th'euening well, till time of rest,<br>
 Then <i>Britomart</i> vnto a bowre was brought;<br>
 Where groomes awayted her to haue vndrest.<br>
 But she ne would vndressed be for ought,<br>
 Ne doffe her armes, though he her much besought.<br>
 For she had vow'd, she sayd, not to forgo<br>
 Those warlike weedes, till she reuenge had wrought<br>
 Of a late wrong vppon a mortall foe;<br>
 Which she would sure performe, betide her wele or wo.</p><p>
 
 Which when their Host perceiu'd, right discontent<br>
 In minde he grew, for feare least by that art<br>
 He should his purpose misse, which close he ment:<br>
 Yet taking leaue of her, he did depart.<br>
 There all that night remained <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
 Restlesse, recomfortlesse, with heart deepe grieued,<br>
 Not suffering the least twinckling sleepe to start<br>
 Into her eye, which th'heart mote haue relieued,<br>
 But if the least appear'd, her eyes she streight reprieued.</p><p>
 
 Ye guilty eyes (sayd she) the which with guyle<br>
 My heart at first betrayd, will ye betray<br>
 My life now to, for which a little whyle<br>
 Ye will not watch? false watches, wellaway,<br>
 I wote when ye did watch both night and day<br>
 Vnto your losse: and now needes will ye sleepe?<br>
 Now ye haue made my heart to wake alway,<br>
 Now will ye sleepe? ah wake, and rather weepe,<br>
 To thinke of your nights want, that should yee waking keepe.</p><p>
 
 Thus did she watch, and weare the weary night<br>
 In waylfull plaints, that none was to appease;<br>
 Now walking soft, now sitting still vpright,<br>
 As sundry chaunge her seemed best to ease.<br>
 Ne lesse did <i>Talus</i> suffer sleepe to seaze<br>
 His eye-lids sad, but watcht continually,<br>
 Lying without her dore in great disease;<br>
 Like to a Spaniell wayting carefully<br>
 Least any should betray his Lady treacherously.</p><p>
 
 What time the natiue Belman of the night,<br>
 The bird, that warned <i>Peter</i> of his fall,<br>
 First rings his siluer Bell t'each sleepy wight,<br>
 That should their mindes vp to deuotion call,<br>
 She heard a wondrous noise below the hall.<br>
 All sodainely the bed, where she should lie,<br>
 By a false trap was let adowne to fall<br>
 Into a lower roome, and by and by<br>
 The loft was raysd againe, that no man could it spie.</p><p>
 
 With sight whereof she was dismayd right sore,<br>
 Perceiuing well the treason, which was ment:<br>
 Yet stirred not at all for doubt of more,<br>
 But kept her place with courage confident,<br>
 Wayting what would ensue of that euent.<br>
 It was not long, before she heard the sound<br>
 Of armed men, comming with close intent<br>
 Towards her chamber; at which dreadfull stound<br>
 She quickly caught her sword, &amp; shield about her bound.</p><p>
 
 With that there came vnto her chamber dore<br>
 Two Knights, all armed ready for to fight,<br>
 And after them full many other more,<br>
 A raskall rout, with weapons rudely dight.<br>
 Whom soone as <i>Talus</i> spide by glims of night,<br>
 He started vp, there where on ground he lay,<br>
 And in his hand his thresher ready keight.<br>
 They seeing that, let driue at him streight way,<br>
 And round about him preace in riotous aray.</p><p>
 
 But soone as he began to lay about<br>
 With his rude yron flaile, they gan to flie,<br>
 Both armed Knights, and eke vnarmed rout:<br>
 Yet <i>Talus</i> after them apace did plie,<br>
 Where euer in the darke he could them spie;<br>
 That here and there like scattred sheepe they lay.<br>
 Then backe returning, where his Dame did lie,<br>
 He to her told the story of that fray,<br>
 And all that treason there intended did bewray.</p><p>
 
 Wherewith though wondrous wroth, and inly burning,<br>
 To be auenged for so fowle a deede,<br>
 Yet being forst to abide the daies returning,<br>
 She there remain'd, but with right wary heede,<br>
 Least any more such practise should proceede.<br>
 Now mote ye know (that which to <i>Britomart</i><br>
 Vnknowen was) whence all this did proceede,<br>
 And for what cause so great mischieuous smart<br>
 Was ment to her, that neuer euill ment in hart.</p><p>
 
 The goodman of this house was <i>Dolon</i> hight,<br>
 A man of subtill wit and wicked minde,<br>
 That whilome in his youth had bene a Knight,<br>
 And armes had borne, but little good could finde,<br>
 And much lesse honour by that warlike kinde<br>
 Of life: for he was nothing valorous,<br>
 But with slie shiftes and wiles did vnderminde<br>
 All noble Knights, which were aduenturous,<br>
 And many brought to shame by treason treacherous.</p><p>
 
 He had three sonnes, all three like fathers sonnes,<br>
 Like treacherous, like full of fraud and guile,<br>
 Of all that on this earthly compasse wonnes:<br>
 The eldest of the which was slaine erewhile<br>
 By <i>Artegall</i>, through his owne guilty wile;<br>
 His name was <i>Guizor</i>, whose vntimely fate<br>
 For to auenge, full many treasons vile<br>
 His father <i>Dolon</i> had deuiz'd of late<br>
 With these his wicked sons, and shewd his cankred hate.</p><p>
 
 For sure he weend, that this his present guest<br>
 Was <i>Artegall</i>, by many tokens plaine;<br>
 But chiefly by that yron page he ghest,<br>
 Which still was wont with <i>Artegall</i> remaine;<br>
 And therefore ment him surely to haue slaine.<br>
 But by Gods grace, and her good heedinesse,<br>
 She was preserued from their traytrous traine.<br>
 Thus she all night wore out in watchfulnesse,<br>
 Ne suffred slothfull sleepe her eyelids to oppresse.</p><p>
 
 The morrow next, so soone as dawning houre<br>
 Discouered had the light to liuing eye,<br>
 She forth yssew'd out of her loathed bowre,<br>
 With full intent t'auenge that villany,<br>
 On that vilde man, and all his family.<br>
 And comming down to seeke them, where they wond,<br>
 Nor sire, nor sonnes, nor any could she spie:<br>
 Each rowme she sought, but them all empty fond:<br>
 They all were fled for feare, but whether, nether kond.</p><p>
 
 She saw it vaine to make there lenger stay,<br>
 But tooke her steede, and thereon mounting light,<br>
 Gan her addresse vnto her former way.<br>
 She had not rid the mountenance of a flight,<br>
 But that she saw there present in her sight,<br>
 Those two false brethren, on that perillous Bridge,<br>
 On which <i>Pollente</i> with <i>Artegall</i> did fight.<br>
 Streight was the passage like a ploughed ridge,<br>
 That if two met, the one mote needes fall ouer the lidge.</p><p>
 
 There they did thinke them selues on her to wreake:<br>
 Who as she nigh vnto them drew, the one<br>
 These vile reproches gan vnto her speake;<br>
 Thou recreant false traytor, that with lone<br>
 Of armes has knighthood stolne, yet Knight art none,<br>
 No more shall now the darkenesse of the night<br>
 Defend thee from the vengeance of thy fone,<br>
 But with thy bloud thou shalt appease the spright<br>
 Of <i>Guizor</i>, by thee slaine, and murdred by thy slight.</p><p>
 
 Strange were the words in <i>Britomartis</i> eare;<br>
 Yet stayd she not for them, but forward fared,<br>
 Till to the perillous Bridge she came, and there<br>
 <i>Talus</i> desir'd, that he might haue prepared<br>
 The  way to her, and those two losels scared.<br>
 But she thereat was wroth, that for despight<br>
 The glauncing sparkles through her beuer glared,<br>
 And from her eies did flash out fiery light,<br>
 Like coles, that through a siluer Censer sparkle bright.</p><p>
 
 She stayd not to aduise which way to take;<br>
 But putting spurres vnto her fiery beast,<br>
 Thorough the midst of them she way did make.<br>
 The one of them, which most her wrath increast,<br>
 Vppon her speare she bore before her breast,<br>
 Till to the Bridges further end she past,<br>
 Where falling downe, his challenge he releast:<br>
 The other ouer side the Bridge she cast<br>
 Into the riuer, where he drunke his deadly last.</p><p>
 
 As when the flashing Leuin haps to light<br>
 Vppon two stubborne oakes, which stand so neare,<br>
 That way betwixt them none appeares in sight;<br>
 The Engin fiercely flying forth, doth teare<br>
 Th'one from the earth, &amp; through the aire doth beare;<br>
 The other it with force doth ouerthrow,<br>
 Vppon one side, and from his rootes doth reare.<br>
 So did the Championesse those two there strow,<br>
 And to their sire their carcasses left to bestow.</p><p>
