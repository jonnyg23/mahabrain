 </p><blockquote>
 <i>The saluage serues Matilda well<br>
 till she Prince Arthure fynd,<br>
 Who her together with his Squyre<br>
 with th'Hermit leaues behynd.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 O
  What an easie thing is to descry<br>
 The gentle bloud, how euer it be wrapt<br>
 In sad misfortunes foule deformity,<br>
 And wretched sorrowes, which haue often hapt?<br>
 For howsoeuer it may grow mis-shapt,<br>
 Like this wyld man, being vndisciplynd,<br>
 That to all vertue it may seeme vnapt,<br>
 Yet will it shew some sparkes of gentle mynd,<br>
 And at the last breake forth in his owne proper kynd.<p>
 
 That plainely may in this wyld man be red,<br>
 Who though he were still in this desert wood,<br>
 Mongst saluage beasts, both rudely borne and bred,<br>
 Ne euer saw faire guize, ne learned good,<br>
 Yet shewd some token of his gentle blood,<br>
 By gentle vsage of that wretched Dame.<br>
 For certes he was borne of noble blood,<br>
 How euer by hard hap he hether came;<br>
 As ye may know, when time shall be to tell the same.</p><p>
 
 Who when as now long time he lacked had<br>
 The good Sir <i>Calepine</i>, that farre was strayd,<br>
 Did wexe exceeding sorrowfull and sad,<br>
 As he of some misfortune were afrayd:<br>
 And leauing there this Ladie all dismayd,<br>
 Went forth streightway into the forrest wyde,<br>
 To seeke, if he perchance a sleepe were layd,<br>
 Or what so else were vnto him betyde:<br>
 He sought him farre and neare, yet him no where he spyde.</p><p>
 
 Tho backe returning to that sorie Dame,<br>
 He shewed semblant of exceeding mone,<br>
 By speaking signes, as he them best could frame;<br>
 Now wringing both his wretched hands in one,<br>
 Now beating his hard head vpon a stone,<br>
 That ruth it was to see him so lament.<br>
 By which she well perceiuing, what was done,<br>
 Gan teare her hayre, and all her garments rent,<br>
 And beat her breast, and piteously her selfe torment.</p><p>
 
 Vpon the ground her selfe she fiercely threw,<br>
 Regardlesse of her wounds, yet bleeding rife,<br>
 That with their bloud did all the flore imbrew,<br>
 As if her breast new launcht with murdrous knife,<br>
 Would streight dislodge the wretched wearie life.<br>
 There she long groueling, and deepe groning lay,<br>
 As if her vitall powers were at strife<br>
 With stronger death, and feared their decay,<br>
 Such were this Ladies pangs and dolorous assay.</p><p>
 
 Whom when the Saluage saw so sore distrest,<br>
 He reared her vp from the bloudie ground,<br>
 And sought by all the meanes, that he could best,<br>
 Her to recure out of that stony swound,<br>
 And staunch the bleeding of her dreary wound.<br>
 Yet nould she be recomforted for nought,<br>
 Ne cease her sorrow and impatient stound,<br>
 But day and night did vexe her carefull thought,<br>
 And euer more and more her owne affliction wrought.</p><p>
 
 At length, when as no hope of his retourne<br>
 She saw now left, she cast to leaue the place,<br>
 And wend abrode, though feeble and forlorne,<br>
 To seeke some comfort in that sorie case.<br>
 His steede now strong through rest so long a space,<br>
 Well as she could, she got, and did bedight,<br>
 And being thereon mounted, forth did pace,<br>
 Withouten guide, her to conduct aright,<br>
 Or gard her to defend from bold oppressors might.</p><p>
 
 Whom when her Host saw readie to depart,<br>
 He would not suffer her alone to fare,<br>
 But gan himselfe addresse to take her part.<br>
 Those warlike armes, which <i>Calepine</i> whyleare<br>
 Had left behind, he gan eftsoones prepare,<br>
 And put them all about himselfe vnfit,<br>
 His shield, his helmet, and his curats bare.<br>
 But without sword vpon his thigh to sit:<br>
 Sir <i>Calepine</i> himselfe away had hidden it.</p><p>
 
 So forth they traueld an vneuen payre,<br>
 That mote to all men seeme an vncouth sight;<br>
 A saluage man matcht with a Ladie fayre,<br>
 That rather seem'd the conquest of his might,<br>
 Gotten by spoyle, then purchaced aright.<br>
 But he did her attend most carefully,<br>
 And faithfully did serue both day and night,<br>
 Withouten thought of shame or villeny,<br>
 Ne euer shewed signe of foule disloyalty.</p><p>
 
 Vpon a day as on their way they went,<br>
 It chaunst some furniture about her steed<br>
 To be disordred by some accident:<br>
 Which to redresse, she did th'assistance need<br>
 Of this her groome, which he by signes did reede;<br>
 And streight his combrous armes aside did lay<br>
 Vpon the ground, withouten doubt or dreed,<br>
 And in his homely wize began to assay<br>
 T'amend what was amisse, and put in right aray.</p><p>
 
 Bout which whilest he was busied thus hard,<br>
 Lo where a knight together with his squire,<br>
 All arm'd to point came ryding thetherward,<br>
 Which seemed by their portance and attire,<br>
 To be two errant knights, that did inquire<br>
 After aduentures, where they mote them get.<br>
 Those were to weet (if that ye it require)<br>
 Prince <i>Arthur</i> and young <i>Timias</i>, which met<br>
 By straunge occasion, that here needs forth be set.</p><p>
 
 After that <i>Timias</i> had againe recured<br>
 The fauour of <i>Belphebe</i>, (as ye heard)<br>
 And of her grace did stand againe assured,<br>
 To happie blisse he was full high vprear'd,<br>
 Nether of enuy, nor of chaunge afeard,<br>
 Though many foes did him maligne therefore,<br>
 And with vniust detraction him did beard;<br>
 Yet he himselfe so well and wisely bore,<br>
 That in her soueraine lyking he dwelt euermore.</p><p>
 
 But of them all, which did his ruine seeke<br>
 Three mightie en'mies did him most despight,<br>
 Three mightie ones, and cruell minded eeke,<br>
 That him not onely sought by open might<br>
 To ouerthrow, but to supplant by slight.<br>
 The first of them by name was cald <i>Despetto</i>,<br>
 Exceeding all the rest in powre and hight;<br>
 The second not so strong but wise, <i>Decetto</i>;<br>
 The third nor strong nor wise, but spightfullest <i>Defetto</i>.</p><p>
 
 Oftimes their sundry powres they did employ,<br>
 And seuerall deceipts, but all in vaine:<br>
 For neither they by force could him destroy,<br>
 Ne yet entrap in treasons subtill traine.<br>
 Therefore conspiring all together plaine,<br>
 They did their counsels now in one compound;<br>
 Where singled forces faile, conioynd may gaine.<br>
 The <i>Blatant Beast</i> the fittest meanes they found,<br>
 To worke his vtter shame, and throughly him confound.</p><p>
 
 Vpon a day as they the time did waite,<br>
 When he did raunge the wood for saluage game,<br>
 They sent that <i>Blatant Beast</i> to be a baite,<br>
 To draw him from his deare beloued dame,<br>
 Vnwares into the daunger of defame.<br>
 For well they wist, that Squire to be so bold,<br>
 That no one beast in forrest wylde or tame,<br>
 Met him in chase, but he it challenge would,<br>
 And plucke the pray oftimes out of their greedy hould.</p><p>
 
 The hardy boy, as they deuised had,<br>
 Seeing the vgly Monster passing by,<br>
 Vpon him set, of perill nought adrad,<br>
 Ne skilfull of the vncouth ieopardy;<br>
 And charged him so fierce and furiously,<br>
 That his great force vnable to endure,<br>
 He forced was to turne from him and fly:<br>
 Yet ere he fled, he with his tooth impure<br>
 Him heedlesse bit, the whiles he was thereof secure.</p><p>
 
 Securely he did after him pursew,<br>
 Thinking by speed to ouertake his flight;<br>
 Who through thicke woods and brakes &amp; briers him drew,<br>
 To weary him the more, and waste his spight,<br>
 So that he now has almost spent his spright.<br>
 Till that at length vnto a woody glade<br>
 He came, whose couert stopt his further sight,<br>
 There his three foes shrowded in guilefull shade,<br>
 Out of their ambush broke, and gan him to inuade.</p><p>
 
 Sharpely they all attonce did him assaile,<br>
 Burning with inward rancour and despight,<br>
 And heaped strokes did round about him haile<br>
 With so huge force, that seemed nothing might<br>
 Beare off their blowes, from percing thorough quite.<br>
 Yet he them all so warily did ward,<br>
 That none of them in his soft flesh did bite,<br>
 And all the while his backe for best safegard,<br>
 He lent against a tree, that backeward onset bard.</p><p>
 
 Like a wylde Bull, that being at a bay,<br>
 Is bayted of a mastiffe, and a hound,<br>
 And a curre-dog; that doe him sharpe assay<br>
 On euery side, and beat about him round;<br>
 But most that curre barking with bitter sownd,<br>
 And creeping still behinde, doth him incomber,<br>
 That in his chauffe he digs the trampled ground,<br>
 And threats his horns, and bellowes like the thonder,<br>
 So did that Squire his foes disperse, and driue asonder.</p><p>
 
 Him well behoued so; for his three foes<br>
 Sought to encompasse him on euery side,<br>
 And dangerously did round about enclose.<br>
 But most of all <i>Defetto</i> him annoyde,<br>
 Creeping behinde him still to haue destroyde:<br>
 So did <i>Decetto</i> eke him circumuent,<br>
 But stout <i>Despetto</i> in his greater pryde,<br>
 Did front him face to face against him bent,<br>
 Yet he them all withstood, and often made relent.</p><p>
 
 Till that at length nigh tyrd with former chace,<br>
 And weary now with carefull keeping ward,<br>
 He gan to shrinke, and somewhat to giue place,<br>
 Full like ere long to haue escaped hard;<br>
 When as vnwares he in the forrest heard<br>
 A trampling steede, that with his neighing fast<br>
 Did warne his rider be vppon his gard;<br>
 With noise whereof the Squire now nigh aghast,<br>
 Reuiued was, and sad dispaire away did cast.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones he spide a Knight approching nye,<br>
 Who seeing one in so great daunger set<br>
 Mongst many foes, him selfe did faster hye;<br>
 To reskue him, and his weake part abet,<br>
 For pitty so to see him ouerset.<br>
 Whom soone as his three enemies did vew,<br>
 They fled, and fast into the wood did get:<br>
 Him booted not to thinke them to pursew,<br>
 The couert was so thicke, that did no passage shew.</p><p>
 
 Then turning to that swaine, him well he knew<br>
 To be his <i>Timias</i>, his owne true Squire,<br>
 Whereof exceeding glad, he to him drew,<br>
 And him embracing twixt his armes entire,<br>
 Him thus bespake; My liefe, my lifes desire,<br>
 Why haue ye me alone thus long yleft?<br>
 Tell me what worlds despight, or heauens yre<br>
 Hath you thus long away from me bereft?<br>
 Where haue ye all this while bin wandring, where bene weft?</p><p>
 
 With that he sighed deepe for inward tyne:<br>
 To whom the Squire nought aunswered againe,<br>
 But shedding few soft teares from tender eyne,<br>
 His deare affect with silence did restraine,<br>
 And shut vp all his plaint in priuy paine.<br>
 There they awhile some gracious speaches spent,<br>
 As to them seemed fit time to entertaine.<br>
 After all which vp to their steedes they went,<br>
 And forth together rode a comely couplement.</p><p>
 
 So now they be arriued both in sight<br>
 Of this wyld man, whom they full busie found<br>
 About the sad <i>Serena</i> things to dight,<br>
 With those braue armours lying on the ground,<br>
 That seem'd the spoile of some right well renownd.<br>
 Which when that Squire beheld, he to them stept,<br>
 Thinking to take them from that hylding hound:<br>
 But he it seeing, lightly to him lept,<br>
 And sternely with strong hand it from his handling kept.</p><p>
 
 Gnashing his grinded teeth with griesly looke,<br>
 And sparkling fire out of his furious eyne,<br>
 Him with his fist vnwares on th'head he strooke,<br>
 That made him downe vnto the earth encline;<br>
 Whence soone vpstarting much he gan repine,<br>
 And laying hand vpon his wrathfull blade,<br>
 Thought therewithall forthwith him to haue slaine,<br>
 Who it perceiuing, hand vpon him layd,<br>
 And greedily him griping, his auengement stayd.</p><p>
 
 With that aloude the faire <i>Serena</i> cryde<br>
 Vnto the Knight, them to dispart in twaine:<br>
 Who to them stepping did them soone diuide,<br>
 And did from further violence restraine,<br>
 Albe the wyld-man hardly would refraine.<br>
 Then gan the Prince, of her for to demand,<br>
 What and from whence she was, and by what traine<br>
 She fell into that saluage villaines hand,<br>
 And whether free with him she now were, or in band.</p><p>
 
 To whom she thus; I am, as now ye see,<br>
 The wretchedst Dame, that liue this day on ground;<br>
 Who both in minde, the which most grieueth me,<br>
 And body haue receiu'd a mortall wound,<br>
 That hath me driuen to this drery stound.<br>
 I was erewhile, the loue of <i>Calepine</i>:<br>
 Who whether he aliue be to be found,<br>
 Or by some deadly chaunce be done to pine,<br>
 Since I him lately lost, vneath is to define.</p><p>
 
 In saluage forrest I him lost of late,<br>
 Where I had surely long ere this bene dead,<br>
 Or else remained in most wretched state,<br>
 Had not this wylde man in that wofull stead<br>
 Kept, and deliuered me from deadly dread.<br>
 In such a saluage wight, of brutish kynd,<br>
 Amongst wilde beastes in desert forrests bred,<br>
 It is most straunge and wonderfull to fynd<br>
 So milde humanity, and perfect gentle mynd.</p><p>
 
 Let me therefore this fauour for him finde,<br>
 That ye will not your wrath vpon him wreake,<br>
 Sith he cannot expresse his simple minde,<br>
 Ne yours conceiue, ne but by tokens speake:<br>
 Small praise to proue your powre on wight so weake.<br>
 With such faire words she did their heate asswage,<br>
 And the strong course of their displeasure breake,<br>
 That they to pitty turnd their former rage,<br>
 And each sought to supply the office of her page.</p><p>
 
 So hauing all things well about her dight,<br>
 She on her way cast forward to proceede,<br>
 And they her forth conducted, where they might<br>
 Finde harbour fit to comfort her great neede.<br>
 For now her wounds corruption gan to breed;<br>
 And eke this Squire, who likewise wounded was<br>
 Of that same Monster late, for lacke of heed,<br>
 Now gan to faint, and further could not pas<br>
 Through feeblenesse, which all his limbes oppressed has.</p><p>
 
 So forth they rode together all in troupe,<br>
 To seeke some place, the which mote yeeld some ease<br>
 To these sicke twaine, that now began to droupe,<br>
 And all the way the Prince sought to appease<br>
 The bitter anguish of their sharpe disease,<br>
 By all the courteous meanes he could inuent;<br>
 Somewhile with merry purpose fit to please,<br>
 And otherwhile with good encouragement,<br>
 To make them to endure the pains, did them torment.</p><p>
 
 Mongst which, <i>Serena</i> did to him relate<br>
 The foule discourt'sies and vnknightly parts,<br>
 Which <i>Turpine</i> had vnto her shewed late,<br>
 Without compassion of her cruell smarts:<br>
 Although <i>Blandina</i> did with all her arts<br>
 Him otherwise perswade, all that she might;<br>
 Yet he of malice, without her desarts,<br>
 Not onely her excluded late at night,<br>
 But also trayterously did wound her weary Knight.</p><p>
 
 Wherewith the Prince sore moued, there auoud,<br>
 That soone as he returned backe againe,<br>
 He would auenge th'abuses of that proud<br>
 And shamefull Knight, of whom she did complaine.<br>
 This wize did they each other entertaine,<br>
 To passe the tedious trauell of the way;<br>
 Till towards night they came vnto a plaine,<br>
 By which a little Hermitage there lay,<br>
 Far from all neighbourhood, the which annoy it may.</p><p>
 
 And nigh thereto a little Chappell stoode,<br>
 Which being all with Yuy ouerspred,<br>
 Deckt all the roofe, and shadowing the roode,<br>
 Seem'd like a groue faire braunched ouer hed:<br>
 Therein the Hermite, which his life here led<br>
 In streight obseruaunce of religious vow,<br>
 Was wont his howres and holy things to bed;<br>
 And therein he likewise was praying now,<br>
 Whenas these Knights arriu'd, they wist not where nor how.</p><p>
 
 They stayd not there, but streight way in did pas.<br>
 Whom when the Hermite present saw in place,<br>
 From his deuotion streight he troubled was;<br>
 Which breaking of he toward them did pace,<br>
 With stayed steps, and graue beseeming grace:<br>
 For well it seem'd, that whilome he had beene<br>
 Some goodly person, and of gentle race,<br>
 That could his good to all, and well did weene,<br>
 How each to entertaine with curt'sie well beseene,</p><p>
 
 And soothly it was sayd by common fame,<br>
 So long as age enabled him thereto,<br>
 That he had bene a man of mickle name,<br>
 Renowmed much in armes and derring doe:<br>
 But being aged now and weary to<br>
 Of warres delight, and worlds contentious toyle,<br>
 The name of knighthood he did disauow,<br>
 And hanging vp his armes and warlike spoyle,<br>
 From all this worlds incombraunce did himselfe assoyle.</p><p>
 
 He thence them led into his Hermitage,<br>
 Letting their steedes to graze vpon the Green:<br>
 Small was his house, and like a little cage,<br>
 For his owne turne, yet inly neate and clene,<br>
 Deckt with greene boughes, and flowers gay beseene.<br>
 Therein he them full faire did entertaine<br>
 Not with such forged showes, as fitter beene<br>
 For courting fooles, that curtesies would faine,<br>
 But with entire affection and appearaunce plaine.</p><p>
 
 Yet was their fare but homely, such as hee<br>
 Did vse, his feeble body to sustaine;<br>
 The which full gladly they did take in glee,<br>
 Such as it was, ne did of want complaine,<br>
 But being well suffiz'd, them rested faine.<br>
 But faire <i>Serene</i> all night could take no rest,<br>
 Ne yet that gentle Squire, for grieuous paine<br>
 Of their late woundes, the which the <i>Blatant Beast</i><br>
 Had giuen them, whose griefe through suffraunce sore increast.</p><p>
 
 So all that night they past in great disease,<br>
 Till that the morning, bringing earely light<br>
 To guide mens labours, brought them also ease,<br>
 And some asswagement of their painefull plight.<br>
 Then vp they rose, and gan them selues to dight<br>
 Vnto their iourney; but that Squire and Dame<br>
 So faint and feeble were, that they ne might<br>
 Endure to trauell, nor one foote to frame:<br>
 Their hearts were sicke, their sides were sore, their feete were lame.</p><p>
 
 Therefore the Prince, whom great affaires in mynd<br>
 Would not permit, to make their lenger stay,<br>
 Was forced there to leaue them both behynd,<br>
 In that good Hermits charge, whom he did pray<br>
 To tend them well.  So forth he went his way,<br>
 And with him eke the saluage, that whyleare<br>
 Seeing his royall vsage and array,<br>
 Was greatly growne in loue of that braue pere,<br>
 Would needes depart, as shall declared be elsewhere.</p><p>
