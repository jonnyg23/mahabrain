 </p><p> 
 </p><blockquote> 
  
  
 <i>The faithfull knight in equall field<br> 
 subdewes his faithlesse foe,<br> 
 Whom false Duessa saues, and for<br>  
 his cure to hell does goe. </i><p> 
 </p></blockquote> 
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>     
 THe noble hart, that harbours vertuous 
 thought,<br>  
 And is with child of glorious great intent,<br>  
 Can neuer rest, vntill it forth haue brought<br>  
 Th'eternall brood of glorie excellent:<br>  
 Such restlesse passion did all night torment<br>  
 The flaming corage of that Faery knight,<br>  
 Deuizing, how that doughtie turnament<br>  
 With greatest honour he atchieuen might;<br>
 Still did he wake, and still did watch for dawning light.<p>
  
 At last the golden Orientall gate<br>  
 Of greatest heauen gan to open faire,<br>  
 And <i>Phoebus</i> fresh, as bridegrome to his mate,<br>  
 Came dauncing forth, shaking his deawie haire:<br>  
 And hurld his glistring beames through gloomy aire.<br>  
 Which when the wakeful Elfe perceiu'd, streight way<br>  
 He started vp, and did him selfe prepaire,<br>  
 In sun-bright armes, and battailous array:<br>
 For with that Pagan proud he combat will that day.</p><p>
  
 And forth he comes into the commune hall,<br>  
 Where earely waite him many a gazing eye,<br>  
 To weet what end to straunger knights may fall.<br>  
 There many Minstrales maken melody,<br>  
 To driue away the dull melancholy,<br>  
 And many Bardes, that to the trembling chord<br>  
 Can tune their timely voyces cunningly,<br>  
 And many Chroniclers, that can record<br>
 Old loues, and warres for Ladies doen by many a Lord.</p><p>
  
 Soone after comes the cruell Sarazin,<br>  
 In wouen maile all armed warily,<br>  
 And sternly lookes at him, who not a pin<br>  
 Does care for looke of liuing creatures eye.<br>  
 They bring them wines of <i>Greece</i> and <i>Araby</i>,<br>  
 And daintie spices fetcht from furthest <i>Ynd</i>,<br>  
 To kindle heat of corage priuily:<br>  
 And in the wine a solemne oth they bynd<br>
 T'obserue the sacred lawes of armes, that are assynd.</p><p>
  
 At last forth comes that far renowmed Queene,<br>  
 With royall pomp and Princely maiestie;<br>  
 She is ybrought vnto a paled greene,<br>  
 And placed vnder stately canapee,<br>  
 The warlike feates of both those knights to see.<br>  
 On th'other side in all mens open vew<br>  
 <i>Duessa</i> placed is, and on a tree<br>  
 <i>Sans-foy</i> his shield is hangd with bloudy hew:<br>
 Both those the lawrell girlonds to the victor dew.</p><p>
  
 A shrilling trompet sownded from on hye,<br>  
 And vnto battaill bad them selues addresse:<br>  
 Their shining shieldes about their wrestes they tye,<br>  
 And burning blades about their heads do blesse,<br>  
 The instruments of wrath and heauinesse:<br>  
 With greedy force each other doth assayle,<br>  
 And strike so fiercely, that they do impresse<br>  
 Deepe dinted furrowes in the battred mayle;<br>
 The yron walles to ward their blowes are weake &amp; fraile.</p><p>
  
 The Sarazin was stout, and wondrous strong,<br>  
 And heaped blowes like yron hammers great:<br>  
 For after bloud and vengeance he did long.<br>  
 The knight was fiers, and full of youthly heat:<br>  
 And doubled strokes, like dreaded thunders threat:<br>  
 For all for prayse and honour he did fight.<br>  
 Both stricken strike, and beaten both do beat,<br>  
 That from their shields forth flyeth firie light,<br>
 And helmets hewen deepe, shew marks of eithers might.</p><p>
  
 So th'one for wrong, the other striues for right:<br>  
 As when a Gryfon seized of his pray,<br>  
 A Dragon fiers encountreth in his flight,<br>  
 Through widest ayre making his ydle way,<br>  
 That would his rightfull rauine rend away:<br>  
 With hideous horrour both together smight,<br>  
 And souce so sore, that they the heauens affray:<br>  
 The wise Southsayer seeing so sad sight,<br>
 Th'amazed vulgar tels of warres and mortall fight.</p><p>
  
 So th'one for wrong, the other striues for right,<br>  
 And each to deadly shame would driue his foe:<br>  
 The cruell steele so greedily doth bight<br>  
 In tender flesh, that streames of bloud down flow,<br>  
 With which the armes, that earst so bright did show,<br>  
 Into a pure vermillion now are dyde:<br>  
 Great ruth in all the gazers harts did grow,<br>  
 Seeing the gored woundes to gape so wyde,<br>
 That victory they dare not wish to either side.</p><p>
  
 At last the Paynim chaunst to cast his eye,<br>  
 His suddein eye, flaming with wrathfull fyre,<br>  
 Vpon his brothers shield, which hong thereby:<br>  
 Therewith redoubled was his raging yre,<br>  
 And said, Ah wretched sonne of wofull syre,<br>  
 Doest thou sit wayling by black <i>Stygian</i> lake,<br>  
 Whilest here thy shield is hangd for victors hyre,<br>  
 And sluggish german doest thy forces slake,<br>
 To after-send his foe, that him may ouertake?</p><p>
  
 Goe caytiue Elfe, him quickly ouertake,<br>  
 And soone redeeme from his long wandring woe;<br>  
 Goe guiltie ghost, to him my message make,<br>  
 That I his shield haue quit from dying foe.<br>  
 Therewith vpon his crest he stroke him so,<br>  
 That twise he reeled, readie twise to fall;<br>  
 End of the doubtfull battell deemed tho<br>  
 The lookers on, and lowd to him gan call<br>
 The false <i>Duessa</i>, Thine the shield, and I, and all.</p><p>
  
 Soone as the Faerie heard his Ladie speake,<br>  
 Out of his swowning dreame he gan awake,<br>  
 And quickning faith, that earst was woxen weake,<br>  
 The creeping deadly cold away did shake:<br>  
 Tho mou'd with wrath, and shame, and Ladies sake,<br>  
 Of all attonce he cast auengd to bee,<br>  
 And with so'exceeding furie at him strake,<br>  
 That forced him to stoupe vpon his knee;<br>
 Had he not stouped so, he should haue clouen bee.</p><p>
  
 And to him said, Goe now proud Miscreant,<br>  
 Thy selfe thy message doe to german deare,<br>  
 Alone he wandring thee too long doth want:<br>  
 Goe say, his foe thy shield with his doth beare.<br>  
 Therewith his heauie hand he high gan reare,<br>  
 Him to haue slaine; when loe a darkesome clowd<br>  
 Vpon him fell: he no where doth appeare,<br>  
 But vanisht is. The Elfe him cals alowd,<br>
 But answer none receiues: the darknes him does shrowd.</p><p>
  
 In haste <i>Duessa</i> from her place arose,<br>  
 And to him running said, O prowest knight,<br>  
 That euer Ladie to her loue did chose,<br>  
 Let now abate the terror of your might,<br>  
 And quench the flame of furious despight,<br>  
 And bloudie vengeance; lo th'infernall powres<br>  
 Couering your foe with cloud of deadly night,<br>  
 Haue borne him hence to <i>Plutoes</i> balefull bowres.<br>
 The conquest yours, I yours, the shield, and glory yours.</p><p>
  
 Not all so satisfide, with greedie eye<br>  
 He sought all round about, his thirstie blade<br>  
 To bath in bloud of faithlesse enemy;<br>  
 Who all that while lay hid in secret shade:<br>  
 He standes amazed, how he thence should fade.<br>  
 At last the trumpets Triumph sound on hie,<br>  
 And running Heralds humble homage made,<br>  
 Greeting him goodly with new victorie,<br>
 And to him brought the shield, the cause of enmitie.</p><p>
  
 Wherewith he goeth to that soueraine Queene,<br>  
 And falling her before on lowly knee,<br>  
 To her makes present of his seruice seene:<br>  
 Which she accepts, with thankes, and goodly gree,<br>  
 Greatly aduauncing his gay cheualree.<br>  
 So marcheth home, and by her takes the knight,<br>  
 Whom all the people follow with great glee,<br>  
 Shouting, and clapping all their hands on hight,<br>
 That all the aire it fils, and flyes to heauen bright.</p><p>
  
 Home is he brought, and laid in sumptuous bed:<br>  
 Where many skilfull leaches him abide,<br>  
 To salue his hurts, that yet still freshly bled.<br>  
 In wine and oyle they wash his woundes wide,<br>  
 And softly can embalme on euery side.<br>  
 And all the while, most heauenly melody<br>  
 About the bed sweet musicke did diuide,<br>  
 Him to beguile of griefe and agony:<br>
 And all the while <i>Duessa</i> wept full bitterly.</p><p>
  
 As when a wearie traueller that strayes<br>  
 By muddy shore of broad seuen-mouthed <i>Nile</i>,<br>  
 Vnweeting of the perillous wandring wayes,<br>  
 Doth meet a cruell craftie Crocodile,<br>  
 Which in false griefe hyding his harmefull guile,<br>  
 Doth weepe full sore, and sheddeth tender teares:<br>  
 The foolish man, that pitties all this while<br>  
 His mournefull plight, is swallowd vp vnwares,<br>
 Forgetfull of his owne, that mindes anothers cares.</p><p>
  
 So wept <i>Duessa</i> vntill euentide,<br>  
 That shyning lampes in <i>Ioues</i> high house were light:<br>  
 Then forth she rose, ne lenger would abide,<br>  
 But comes vnto the place, where th'Hethen knight<br>  
 In slombring swownd nigh voyd of vitall spright,<br>  
 Lay couer'd with inchaunted cloud all day:<br>  
 Whom when she found, as she him left in plight,<br>  
 To wayle his woefull case she would not stay,<br>
 But to the easterne coast of heauen makes speedy way.</p><p>
  
 Where griesly <i>Night</i>, with visage deadly sad,<br>  
 That <i>Phoebus</i> chearefull face durst neuer vew,<br>  
 And in a foule blacke pitchie mantle clad,<br>  
 She findes forth comming from her darkesome mew,<br>  
 Where she all day did hide her hated hew.<br>  
 Before the dore her yron charet stood,<br>  
 Alreadie harnessed for iourney new;<br>  
 And coleblacke steedes yborne of hellish brood,<br>
 That on their rustie bits did champ, as they were wood.</p><p>
  
 Who when she saw <i>Duessa</i> sunny bright,<br>  
 Adornd with gold and iewels shining cleare,<br>  
 She greatly grew amazed at the sight,<br>  
 And th'vnacquainted light began to feare:<br>  
 For neuer did such brightnesse there appeare,<br>  
 And would haue backe retyred to her caue,<br>  
 Vntill the witches speech she gan to heare,<br>  
 Saying, Yet ô thou dreaded Dame, I craue<br>
 Abide, till I haue told the message, which I haue.</p><p>
  
 She stayd, and foorth <i>Duessa</i> gan proceede,<br>  
 O thou most auncient Grandmother of all,<br>  
 More old then <i>Ioue</i>, whom thou at first didst 
 breede,<br>  
 Or that great house of Gods cælestiall,<br>  
 Which wast begot in <i>Dæmogorgons</i> hall,<br>  
 And sawst the secrets of the world vnmade,<br>  
 Why suffredst thou thy Nephewes deare to fall<br>  
 With Elfin sword, most shamefully betrade?<br>
 Lo where the stout <i>Sansioy</i> doth sleepe in deadly shade.</p><p>
  
 And him before, I saw with bitter eyes<br>  
 The bold <i>Sansfoy</i> shrinke vnderneath his speare;<br>  
 And now the pray of fowles in field he lyes,<br>  
 Nor wayld of friends, nor laid on groning beare,<br>  
 That whylome was to me too dearely deare.<br>  
 O what of Gods then boots it to be borne,<br>  
 If old <i>Aveugles</i> sonnes so euill heare?<br>  
 Or who shall not great <i>Nightes</i> children scorne,<br>
 When two of three her Nephews are so fowle forlorne?</p><p>
  
 Vp then, vp dreary Dame, of darknesse Queene,<br>  
 Go gather vp the reliques of thy race,<br>  
 Or else goe them auenge, and let be seene,<br>  
 That dreaded <i>Night</i> in brightest day hath place,<br>  
 And can the children of faire light deface.<br>  
 Her feeling speeches some compassion moued<br>  
 In hart, and chaunge in that great mothers face:<br>  
 Yet pittie in her hart was neuer proued<br>
 Till then: for euermore she hated, neuer loued.</p><p>
  
 And said, Deare daughter rightly may I rew<br>  
 The fall of famous children borne of mee,<br>  
 And good successes, which their foes ensew:<br>  
 But who can turne the streame of destinee,<br>  
 Or breake the chayne of strong necessitee,<br>  
 Which fast is tyde to <i>Ioues</i> eternall seat?<br>  
 The sonnes of Day he fauoureth, I see,<br>  
 And by my ruines thinkes to make them great:<br>
 To make one great by others losse, is bad excheat.</p><p>
  
 Yet shall they not escape so freely all;<br>  
 For some shall pay the price of others guilt:<br>  
 And he the man that made <i>Sansfoy</i> to fall,<br>  
 Shall with his owne bloud price that he hath spilt.<br>  
 But what art thou, that telst of Nephews kilt?<br>  
 I that do seeme not I, <i>Duessa</i> am,<br>  
 (Quoth she) how euer now in garments gilt,<br>  
 And gorgeous gold arayd I to thee came;<br>
 <i>Duessa</i> I, the daughter of Deceipt and Shame.</p><p>
  
 Then bowing downe her aged backe, she kist<br>  
 The wicked witch, saying; In that faire face<br>  
 The false resemblance of Deceipt, I wist<br>  
 Did closely lurke; yet so true-seeming grace<br>  
 It carried, that I scarse in darkesome place<br>  
 Could it discerne, though I the mother bee<br>  
 Of falshood, and root of <i>Duessaes</i> race.<br>  
 O welcome child, whom I haue longd to see,<br>
 And how haue seene vnwares. Lo now I go with thee.</p><p>
  
 Then to her yron wagon she betakes,<br>  
 And with her beares the fowle welfauourd witch:<br>  
 Through mirkesome aire her readie way she makes.<br>  
 Her twyfold Teme, of which two blacke as pitch,<br>  
 And two were browne, yet each to each vnlich,<br>  
 Did softly swim away, ne euer stampe,<br>  
 Vnlesse she chaunst their stubborne mouths to twitch;  <br>
 Then foming tarre, their bridles they would champe,<br>
 And trampling the fine element, would fiercely rampe.</p><p>
  
 So well they sped, that they be come at length<br>  
 Vnto the place, whereas the Paynim lay,<br>  
 Deuoid of outward sense, and natiue strength,<br>  
 Couerd with charmed cloud from vew of day,<br>  
 And sight of men, since his late luckelesse fray.<br>  
 His cruell wounds with cruddy bloud congealed,<br>  
 They binden vp so wisely, as they may,<br>  
 And handle softly, till they can be healed:<br>
 So lay him in her charet, close in night concealed.</p><p>
  
 And all the while she stood vpon the ground,<br>  
 The wakefull dogs did neuer cease to bay,<br>  
 As giuing warning of th'vnwonted sound,<br>  
 With which her yron wheeles did them affray,<br>  
 And her darke griesly looke them much dismay;<br>  
 The messenger of death, the ghastly Owle<br>  
 With drearie shriekes did also her bewray;<br>  
 And hungry Wolues continually did howle,<br>
 At her abhorred face, so filthy and so fowle.</p><p>
  
 Thence turning backe in silence soft they stole,<br>  
 And brought the heauie corse with easie pace<br>  
 To yawning gulfe of deepe <i>Auernus</i> hole.<br>  
 By that same hole an entrance darke and bace<br>  
 With smoake and sulphure hiding all the place,<br>  
 Descends to hell: there creature neuer past,<br>  
 That backe returned without heauenly grace;<br>  
 But dreadfull <i>Furies</i>, which their chaines haue brast,<br>
 And damned sprights sent forth to make ill men aghast.</p><p>
  
 By that same way the direfull dames doe driue<br>  
 Their mournefull charet, fild with rusty blood,<br>  
 And downe to <i>Plutoes</i> house are come biliue:<br>  
 Which passing through, on euery side them stood<br>  
 The trembling ghosts with sad amazed mood,<br>  
 Chattring their yron teeth, and staring wide<br>  
 With stonie eyes; and all the hellish brood<br>  
 Of feends infernall flockt on euery side,<br>
 To gaze on earthly wight, that with the Night durst ride.</p><p>
  
 They pas the bitter waues of <i>Acheron</i>,<br>  
 Where many soules sit wailing woefully,<br>  
 And come to fiery flood of <i>Phlegeton</i>,<br>  
 Whereas the damned ghosts in torments fry,<br>  
 And with sharpe shrilling shriekes doe bootlesse cry,<br>  
 Cursing high <i>Ioue</i>, the which them thither sent.<br>  
 The house of endlesse paine is built thereby,<br>  
 In which ten thousand sorts of punishment<br>
 The cursed creatures doe eternally torment.</p><p>
  
 Before the threshold dreadfull <i>Cerberus</i><br>  
 His three deformed heads did lay along,<br>  
 Curled with thousand adders venemous,<br>  
 And lilled forth his bloudie flaming tong:<br>  
 At them he gan to reare his bristles strong,<br>  
 And felly gnarre, vntill dayes enemy<br>  
 Did him appease; then downe his taile he hong<br>  
 And suffered them to passen quietly:<br>
 For she in hell and heauen had power equally.</p><p>
  
 There was <i>Ixion</i> turned on a wheele,<br>  
 For daring tempt the Queene of heauen to sin;<br>  
 And <i>Sisyphus</i> an huge round stone did reele<br>  
 Against an hill, ne might from labour lin;<br>  
 There thirstie <i>Tantalus</i> hong by the chin;<br>  
 And <i>Tityus</i> fed a vulture on his maw;<br>  
 <i>Typhoeus</i> ioynts were stretched on a gin,<br>  
 <i>Theseus</i> condemned to endlesse slouth by law,<br>
 And fifty sisters water in leake vessels draw.</p><p>
  
 They all beholding worldly wights in place,<br>  
 Leaue off their worke, vnmindfull of their smart,<br>  
 To gaze on them; who forth by them doe pace,<br>  
 Till they be come vnto the furthest part:<br>  
 Where was a Caue ywrought by wondrous art,<br>  
 Deepe, darke, vneasie, dolefull, comfortlesse,<br>  
 In which sad <i>Æsculapius</i> farre a part<br>  
 Emprisond was in chaines remedilesse,<br>
 For that <i>Hippolytus</i> rent corse he did redresse.</p><p>
  
 <i>Hippolytus</i> a iolly huntsman was,<br>  
 That wont in charet chace the foming Bore;<br>  
 He all his Peeres in beautie did surpas,<br>  
 But Ladies loue as losse of time forbore:<br>  
 His wanton stepdame loued him the more,<br>  
 But when she saw her offred sweets refused<br>  
 Her loue she turnd to hate, and him before<br>  
 His father fierce of treason false accused,<br>
 And with her gealous termes his open eares abused.</p><p>
  
 Who all in rage his Sea-god syre besought,<br>  
 Some cursed vengeance on his sonne to cast:<br>  
 From surging gulf two monsters straight were brought,<br>  
 With dread whereof his chasing steedes aghast,<br>  
 Both charet swift and huntsman ouercast.<br>  
 His goodly corps on ragged cliffs yrent,<br>  
 Was quite dismembred, and his members chast<br>  
 Scattered on euery mountaine, as he went,<br>
 That of <i>Hippolytus</i> was left no moniment.</p><p>
  
 His cruell stepdame seeing what was donne,<br>  
 Her wicked dayes with wretched knife did end,<br>  
 In death auowing th'innocence of her sonne.<br>  
 Which hearing his rash Syre, began to rend<br>  
 His haire, and hastie tongue, that did offend:<br>  
 Tho gathering vp the relicks of his smart<br>  
 By <i>Dianes</i> meanes, who was <i>Hippolyts</i> frend,<br>  
 Them brought to <i>Æsculape</i>, that by his art<br>
 Did heale them all againe, and ioyned euery part.</p><p>
  
 Such wondrous science in mans wit to raine<br>  
 When <i>Ioue</i> auizd, that could the dead reuiue,<br>  
 And fates expired could renew againe,<br>  
 Of endlesse life he might him not depriue,<br>  
 But vnto hell did thrust him downe aliue,<br>  
 With flashing thunderbolt ywounded sore:<br>  
 Where long remaining, he did alwaies striue<br>  
 Himselfe wilth salues to health for to restore,<br>
 And slake the heauenly fire, that raged euermore.</p><p>
  
 There auncient Night arriuing, did alight<br>  
 From her nigh wearie waine, and in her armes<br>  
 To <i>Æsculapius</i> brought the wounded knight:<br>  
 Whom hauing softly disarayd of armes,<br>  
 Tho gan to him discouer all his harmes,<br>  
 Beseeching him with prayer, and with praise,<br>  
 If either salues, or oyles, or herbes, or charmes<br>  
 A fordonne wight from dore of death mote raise,<br>
 He would at her request prolong her nephews daies.</p><p>
  
 Ah Dame (quoth he) thou temptest me in vaine,<br>  
 To dare the thing, which daily yet I rew,<br>  
 And the old cause of my continued paine<br>  
 With like attempt to like end to renew.<br>  
 Is not enough, that thrust from heauen dew<br>  
 Here endlesse penance for one fault I pay,<br>  
 But that redoubled crime with vengeance new<br>  
 Thou biddest me to eeke?  Can Night defray<br>
 The wrath of thundring <i>Ioue</i>, that rules both night and day?</p><p>
  
 Not so (quoth she) but sith that heauens king<br>  
 From hope of heauen hath thee excluded quight,<br>  
 Why fearest thou, that canst not hope for thing,<br>  
 And fearest not, that more thee hurten might,<br>  
 Now in the powre of euerlasting Night?<br>  
 Goe to then, ô thou farre renowmed sonne<br>  
 Of great <i>Apollo</i>, shew thy famous might<br>  
 In medicine, that else hath to thee wonne<br>
 Great paines, &amp; greater praise, both neuer to be donne.</p><p>
  
 Her words preuaild: And then the learned leach<br>  
 His cunning hand gan to his wounds to lay,<br>  
 And all things else, the which his art did teach:<br>  
 Which hauing seene, from thence arose away<br>  
 The mother of dread darknesse, and let stay<br>  
 <i>Aueugles</i> sonne there in the leaches cure,<br>  
 And backe returning tooke her wonted way,<br>  
 To runne her timely race, whilst <i>Phoebus</i> pure<br>
 In westerne waues his wearie wagon did recure.</p><p>
  
 The false <i>Duessa</i> leauing noyous Night,<br>  
 Returnd to stately pallace of dame Pride;<br>  
 Where when she came, she found the Faery knight<br>  
 Departed thence, albe his woundes wide<br>  
 Not throughly heald, vnreadie were to ride.<br>  
 Good cause he had to hasten thence away;<br>  
 For on a day his wary Dwarfe had spide,<br>  
 Where in a dongeon deepe huge numbers lay<br>
 Of caytiue wretched thrals, that wayled night and day.</p><p>
  
 A ruefull sight, as could be seene with eie;<br>  
 Of whom he learned had in secret wise<br>  
 The hidden cause of their captiuitie,<br>  
 How mortgaging their liues to <i>Couetise</i>,<br>  
 Through wastfull Pride, and wanton Riotise,<br>  
 They were by law of that proud Tyrannesse<br>  
 Prouokt with <i>VVrath</i>, and <i>Enuies</i> false surmise,<br>
 Condemned to that Dongeon mercilesse,<br>
 Where they should liue in woe, &amp; die in wretchednesse.</p><p>
  
 There was that great proud king of <i>Babylon</i>,<br>  
 That would compell all nations to adore,<br>  
 And him as onely God to call vpon,<br>  
 Till through celestiall doome throwne out of dore,<br>  
 Into an Oxe he was transform'd of yore:<br>  
 There also was king <i>Croesus</i>, that enhaunst<br>  
 His heart too high through his great riches store;<br>  
 And proud <i>Antiochus</i>, the which aduaunst<br>
 His cursed hand gainst God, and on his altars daunst.</p><p>
  
 And them long time before, great <i>Nimrod</i> was,<br>  
 That first the world with sword and fire warrayd;<br>  
 And after him old <i>Ninus</i> farre did pas<br>  
 In princely pompe, of all the world obayd;<br>  
 There also was that mightie Monarch layd<br>  
 Low vnder all, yet aboue all in pride,<br>  
 That name of natiue syre did fowle vpbrayd,<br>  
 And would as <i>Ammons</i> sonne be magnifide,<br>
 Till scornd of God and man a shamefull death he dide.</p><p>
  
 All these together in one heape were throwne,<br>  
 Like carkases of beasts in butchers stall.<br>  
 And in another corner wide were strowne<br>  
 The antique ruines of the <i>Romaines</i> fall:<br>  
 Great <i>Romulus</i> the Grandsyre of them all,<br>  
 Proud <i>Tarquin</i>, and too lordly <i>Lentulus</i>,<br>  
 Stout <i>Scipio</i>, and stubborne <i>Hanniball</i>,<br>  
 Ambitious <i>Sylla</i>, and sterne <i>Marius</i>,<br>
 High <i>Cæsar</i>, great <i>Pompey</i>, and fierce <i>Antonius</i>.</p><p>
  
 Amongst these mighty men were wemen mixt,<br>  
 Proud wemen, vaine, forgetfull of their yoke:<br>  
 The bold <i>Semiramis</i>, whose sides transfixt<br>  
 With sonnes owne blade, her fowle reproches spoke;<br>  
 Faire <i>Sthenoboea</i>, that her selfe did choke<br>  
 With wilfull cord, for wanting of her will;<br>  
 High minded <i>Cleopatra</i>, that with stroke<br>  
 Of Aspes sting her selfe did stoutly kill:<br>
 And thousands moe the like, that did that dongeon fill.</p><p>
  
 Besides the endlesse routs of wretched thralles,<br>  
 Which thither were assembled day by day,<br>  
 From all the world after their wofull falles,<br>  
 Through wicked pride, and wasted wealthes decay.<br>  
 But most of all, which in the Dongeon lay<br>  
 Fell from high Princes courts, or Ladies bowres,<br>  
 Where they in idle pompe, or wanton play,<br>  
 Consumed had their goods, and thriftlesse howres,<br>
 And lastly throwne themselues into these heauy stowres.</p><p>
  
 Whose case when as the carefull Dwarfe had tould,<br>  
 And made ensample of their mournefull sight<br>  
 Vnto his maister, he no lenger would<br>  
 There dwell in perill of like painefull plight,<br>  
 But early rose, and ere that dawning light<br>  
 Discouered had the world to heauen wyde,<br>  
 He by a priuie Posterne tooke his flight,<br>  
 That of no enuious eyes he mote be spyde:<br>
 For doubtlesse death ensewd, if any him descryde.</p><p>
  
 Scarse could he footing find in that fowle way,<br>  
 For many corses, like a great Lay-stall<br>  
 Of murdred men which therein strowed lay,<br>  
 Without remorse, or decent funerall:<br>  
 Which all through that great Princesse pride did fall<br>  
 And came to shamefull end. And them beside<br>  
 Forth ryding vnderneath the castell wall,<br>  
 A donghill of dead carkases he spide,<br>
 The dreadfull spectacle of that sad house of <i>Pride</i>.</p><p>

 <p>
 </p><blockquote>     
 AS when a ship, that flyes faire vnder 
 saile,<br>
 An hidden rocke escaped hath vnwares,<br>
 That lay in waite her wrack for to bewaile,<br>
 The Marriner yet halfe amazed stares<br>
 At perill past, and yet in doubt ne dares<br>
 To ioy at his foole-happie ouersight:<br>
 So doubly is distrest twixt ioy and cares<br>
 The dreadlesse courage of this Elfin knight,<br>
 Hauing escapt so sad ensamples in his sight.<p>
  
 Yet sad he was that his too hastie speed<br>
 The faire <i>Duess</i>' had forst him leaue behind;<br>
 And yet more sad, that <i>Vna</i> his deare dreed<br>
 Her truth had staind with treason so vnkind;<br>
 Yet crime in her could neuer creature find,<br>
 But for his loue, and for her owne selfe sake,<br>
 She wandred had from one to other <i>Ynd</i>,<br>
 Him for to seeke, ne euer would forsake,<br>
 Till her vnwares the fierce <i>Sansloy</i> did ouertake.</p><p>
  
 Who after <i>Archimagoes</i> fowle defeat,<br>
 Led her away into a forrest wilde,<br>
 And turning wrathfull fire to lustfull heat,<br>
 With beastly sin thought her to haue defilde,<br>
 And made the vassall of his pleasures vilde.<br>
 Yet first he cast by treatie, and by traynes,<br>
 Her to perswade, that stubborne fort to yilde:<br>
 For greater conquest of hard loue he gaynes,<br>
 That workes it to his will, then he that it constraines.</p><p>
  
 With fawning wordes he courted her a while,<br>
 And looking louely, and oft sighing sore,<br>
 Her constant hart did tempt with diuerse guile:<br>
 But wordes, and lookes, and sighes she did abhore,<br>
 As rocke of Diamond stedfast euermore.<br>
 Yet for to feed his fyrie lustfull eye,<br>
 He snatcht the vele, that hong her face before;<br>
 Then gan her beautie shine, as brightest skye,<br>
 And burnt his beastly hart t'efforce her chastitye.</p><p>
  
 So when he saw his flatt'ring arts to fayle,<br>
 And subtile engines bet from batteree,<br>
 With greedy force he gan the fort assayle,<br>
 Whereof he weend possessed soone to bee,<br>
 And win rich spoile of ransackt chastetee.<br>
 Ah heauens, that do this hideous act behold,<br>
 And heauenly virgin thus outraged see,<br>
 How can ye vengeance iust so long withhold,<br>
 And hurle not flashing flames vpon that Paynim bold?</p><p>
  
 The pitteous maiden carefull comfortlesse,<br>
 Does throw out thrilling shriekes, &amp; shrieking cryes,<br>
 The last vaine helpe of womens great distresse,<br>
 And with loud plaints importuneth the skyes,<br>
 That molten starres do drop like weeping eyes;<br>
 And <i>Phoebus</i> flying so most shamefull sight,<br>
 His blushing face in foggy cloud implyes,<br>
 And hides for shame. What wit of mortall wight<br>
 Can now deuise to quit a thrall from such a plight?</p><p>
  
 Eternall prouidence exceeding thought,<br>
 Where none appeares can make her selfe a way:<br>
 A wondrous way it for this Lady wrought,<br>
 From Lyons clawes to pluck the griped pray.<br>
 Her shrill outcryes and shriekes so loud did bray,<br>
 That all the woodes and forestes did resownd;<br>
 A troupe of <i>Faunes</i> and <i>Satyres</i> far away<br>
 Within the wood were dauncing in a rownd,<br>
 Whiles old <i>Syluanus</i> slept in shady arber sownd.</p><p>
  
 Who when they heard that pitteous strained voice,<br>
 In hast forsooke their rurall meriment,<br>
 And ran towards the far rebownded noyce,<br>
 To weet, what wight so loudly did lament.<br>
 Vnto the place they come incontinent:<br>
 Whom when the raging Sarazin espide,<br>
 A rude, misshapen, monstrous rablement,<br>
 Whose like he neuer saw, he durst not bide,<br>
 But got his ready steed, and fast away gan ride.</p><p>
  
 The wyld woodgods arriued in the place,<br>
 There find the virgin dolefull desolate,<br>
 With ruffled rayments, and faire blubbred face,<br>
 As her outrageous foe had left her late,<br>
 And trembling yet through feare of former hate;<br>
 All stand amazed at so vncouth sight,<br>
 And gin to pittie her vnhappie state,<br>
 All stand astonied at her beautie bright,<br>
 In their rude eyes vnworthie of so wofull plight.</p><p>
  
 She more amaz'd, in double dread doth dwell;<br>
 And euery tender part for feare does shake:<br>
 As when a greedie Wolfe through hunger fell<br>
 A seely Lambe farre from the flocke does take,<br>
 Of whom he meanes his bloudie feast to make,<br>
 A Lyon spyes fast running towards him,<br>
 The innocent pray in hast he does forsake,<br>
 Which quit from death yet quakes in euery lim<br>
 With chaunge of feare, to see the Lyon looke so grim.</p><p>
  
 Such fearefull fit assaid her trembling hart,<br>
 Ne word to speake, ne ioynt to moue she had:<br>
 The saluage nation feele her secret smart,<br>
 And read her sorrow in her count'nance sad;<br>
 Their frowning forheads with rough hornes yclad,<br>
 And rusticke horror all a side doe lay,<br>
 And gently grenning, shew a semblance glad<br>
 To comfort her, and feare to put away,<br>
 Their backward bent knees teach her humbly to obay.</p><p>
  
 The doubtfull Damzell dare not yet commit<br>
 Her single person to their barbarous truth,<br>
 But still twixt feare and hope amazd does sit,<br>
 Late learnd what harme to hastie trust ensu'th,<br>
 They in compassion of her tender youth,<br>
 And wonder of her beautie soueraine,<br>
 Are wonne with pitty and vnwonted ruth,<br>
 And all prostrate vpon the lowly plaine,<br>
 Do kisse her feete, and fawne on her with count'nance faine.</p><p>
  
 Their harts she ghesseth by their humble guise,<br>
 And yieldes her to extremitie of time;<br>
 So from the ground she fearelesse doth arise,<br>
 And walketh forth without suspect of crime:<br>
 They all as glad, as birdes of ioyous Prime,<br>
 Thence lead her forth, about her dauncing round,<br>
 Shouting, and singing all a shepheards ryme,<br>
 And with greene braunches strowing all the ground,<br>
 Do worship her, as Queene, with oliue girlond cround.</p><p>
  
 And all the way their merry pipes they sound,<br>
 That all the woods with doubled Eccho ring,<br>
 And with their horned feet do weare the ground,<br>
 Leaping like wanton kids in pleasant Spring.<br>
 So towards old <i>Syluanus</i> they her bring;<br>
 Who with the noyse awaked, commeth out,<br>
 To weet the cause, his weake steps gouerning,<br>
 And aged limbs on Cypresse stadle stout,<br>
 And with an yuie twyne his wast is girt about.</p><p>
  
 Far off he wonders, what them makes so glad,<br>
 If <i>Bacchus</i> merry fruit they did inuent,<br>
 Or <i>Cybeles</i> franticke rites haue made them mad;<br>
 They drawing nigh, vnto their God present<br>
 That flowre of faith and beautie excellent.<br>
 The God himselfe vewing that mirrhour rare,<br>
 Stood long amazd, and burnt in his intent;<br>
 His owne faire <i>Dryope</i> now he thinkes not faire,<br>
 And <i>Pholoe</i> fowle, when her to this he doth compaire.</p><p>
  
 The woodborne people fall before her flat,<br>
 And worship her as Goddesse of the wood;<br>
 And old <i>Syluanus</i> selfe bethinkes not, what<br>
 To thinke of wight so faire, but gazing stood,<br>
 In doubt to deeme her borne of earthly brood;<br>
 Sometimes Dame <i>Venus</i> selfe he seemes to see,<br>
 But <i>Venus</i> neuer had so sober mood;<br>
 Sometimes <i>Diana</i> he her takes to bee,<br>
 But misseth bow, and shaftes, and buskins to her knee.</p><p>
  
 By vew of her he ginneth to reuiue<br>
 His ancient loue, and dearest <i>Cyparisse</i>,<br>
 And calles to mind his pourtraiture aliue,<br>
 How faire he was, and yet not faire to this,<br>
 And how he slew with glauncing dart amisse<br>
 A gentle Hynd, the which the louely boy<br>
 Did loue as life, aboue all worldly blisse;<br>
 For griefe whereof the lad n'ould after ioy,<br>
 But pynd away in anguish and selfe-wild annoy.</p><p>
  
 The wooddy Nymphes, faire <i>Hamadryades</i><br>
 Her to behold do thither runne apace,<br>
 And all the troupe of light-foot <i>Naiades</i>,<br>
 Flocke all about to see her louely face:<br>
 But when they vewed haue her heauenly grace,<br>
 They enuie her in their malitious mind,<br>
 And fly away for feare of fowle disgrace:<br>
 But all the <i>Satyres</i> scorne their woody kind,<br>
 And henceforth nothing faire, but her on earth they find.</p><p>
  
 Glad of such lucke, the luckelesse lucky maid,<br>
 Did her content to please their feeble eyes,<br>
 And long time with that saluage people staid,<br>
 To gather breath in many miseries.<br>
 During which time her gentle wit she plyes,<br>
 To teach them truth, which worshipt her in vaine,<br>
 And made her th'Image of Idolatryes;<br>
 But when their bootlesse zeale she did restraine<br>
 Frõ her own worship, they her Asse would worship fayn.</p><p>
  
 It fortuned a noble warlike knight<br>
 By iust occasion to that forrest came,<br>
 To seeke his kindred, and the lignage right,<br>
 From whence he tooke his well deserued name:<br>
 He had in armes abroad wonne muchell fame,<br>
 And fild far landes with glorie of his might,<br>
 Plaine, faithfull, true, and enimy of shame,<br>
 And euer lou'd to fight for Ladies right,<br>
 But in vaine glorious frayes he litle did delight.</p><p>
  
 A Satyres sonne yborne in forrest wyld,<br>
 By straunge aduenture as it did betyde,<br>
 And there begotten of a Lady myld,<br>
 Faire <i>Thyamis</i> the daughter of <i>Labryde</i>,<br>
 That was in sacred bands of wedlocke tyde<br>
 To <i>Therion</i>, a loose vnruly swayne;<br>
 Who had more ioy to raunge the forrest wyde,<br>
 And chase the saluage beast with busie payne,<br>
 Then serue his Ladies loue, and wast in pleasures vayne.</p><p>
  
 The forlorne mayd did with loues longing burne,<br>
 And could not lacke her louers company,<br>
 But to the wood she goes, to serue her turne,<br>
 And seeke her spouse, that from her still does fly,<br>
 And followes other game and venery:<br>
 A Satyre chaunst her wandring for to find,<br>
 And kindling coles of lust in brutish eye,<br>
 The loyall links of wedlocke did vnbind,<br>
 And made her person thrall vnto his beastly kind.</p><p>
  
 So long in secret cabin there he held<br>
 Her captiue to his sensuall desire,<br>
 Till that with timely fruit her belly sweld,<br>
 And bore a boy vnto that saluage sire:<br>
 Then home he suffred her for to retire,<br>
 For ransome leauing him the late borne childe;<br>
 Whom till to ryper yeares he gan aspire,<br>
 He noursled vp in life and manners wilde,<br>
 Emongst wild beasts and woods, from lawes of men exilde.</p><p>
  
 For all he taught the tender ymp, was but<br>
 To banish cowardize and bastard feare;<br>
 His trembling hand he would him force to put<br>
 Vpon the Lyon and the rugged Beare,<br>
 And from the she Beares teats her whelps to teare;<br>
 And eke wyld roring Buls he would him make<br>
 To tame, and ryde their backes not made to beare;<br>
 And the Robuckes in flight to ouertake,<br>
 That euery beast for feare of him did fly and quake.</p><p>
  
 Thereby so fearelesse, and so fell he grew,<br>
 That his owne sire and maister of his guise<br>
 Did often tremble at his horrid vew,<br>
 And oft for dread of hurt would him aduise,<br>
 The angry beasts not rashly to despise,<br>
 Nor too much to prouoke; for he would learne<br>
 The Lyon stoup to him in lowly wise,<br>
 (A lesson hard) and make the Libbard sterne<br>
 Leaue roaring, when in rage he for reuenge did earne.</p><p>
  
 And for to make his powre approued more,<br>
 Wyld beasts in yron yokes he would compell;<br>
 The spotted Panther, and the tusked Bore,<br>
 The Pardale swift, and the Tigre cruell;<br>
 The Antelope, and Wolfe both fierce and fell;<br>
 And them constraine in equall teme to draw.<br>
 Such ioy he had, their stubborne harts to quell,<br>
 And sturdie courage tame with dreadfull aw,<br>
 That his beheast they feared, as tyrans law, </p><p>
  
 His louing mother came vpon a day<br>
 Vnto the woods, to see her little sonne;<br>
 And chaunst vnwares to meet him in the way,<br>
 After his sportes, and cruell pastime donne,<br>
 When after him a Lyonesse did runne,<br>
 That roaring all with rage, did lowd requere<br>
 Her children deare, whom he away had wonne:<br>
 The Lyon whelpes she saw how he did beare,<br>
 And lull in rugged armes, withouten childish feare.</p><p>
  
 The fearefull Dame all quaked at the sight,<br>
 And turning backe, gan fast to fly away,<br>
 Vntill with loue reuokt from vaine affright,<br>
 She hardly yet perswaded was to stay,<br>
 And then to him these womanish words gan say;<br>
 Ah <i>Satyrane</i>, my dearling, and my ioy,<br>
 For loue of me leaue off this dreadfull play;<br>
 To dally thus with death, is no fit toy,<br>
 Go find some other play-fellowes, mine own sweet boy.</p><p>
  
 In these and like delights of bloudy game<br>
 He trayned was, till ryper yeares he raught,<br>
 And there abode, whilst any beast of name<br>
 Walkt in that forest, whom he had not taught<br>
 To feare his force: and then his courage haught<br>
 Desird of forreine foemen to be knowne,<br>
 And far abroad for straunge aduentures sought:<br>
 In which his might was neuer ouerthrowne,<br>
 But through all Faery lond his famous worth was blown.</p><p>
  
 Yet euermore it was his manner faire,<br>
 After long labours and aduentures spent,<br>
 Vnto those natiue woods for to repaire,<br>
 To see his sire and offspring auncient.<br>
 And now he thither came for like intent;<br>
 Where he vnwares the fairest <i>Vna</i> found,<br>
 Straunge Lady, in so straunge habiliment,<br>
 Teaching the Satyres, which her sat around,<br>
 Trew sacred lore, which from her sweet lips did redound.</p><p>
  
 He wondred at her wisedome heauenly rare,<br>
 Whose like in womens wit he neuer knew;<br>
 And when her curteous deeds he did compare,<br>
 Gan her admire, and her sad sorrowes rew,<br>
 Blaming of Fortune, which such troubles threw,<br>
 And ioyd to make proofe of her crueltie<br>
 On gentle Dame, so hurtlesse, and so trew:<br>
 Thenceforth he kept her goodly company,<br>
 And learnd her discipline of faith and veritie.</p><p>
  
 But she all vowd vnto the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight,<br>
 His wandring perill closely did lament,<br>
 Ne in this new acquaintaunce could delight,<br>
 But her deare heart with anguish did torment,<br>
 And all her wit in secret counsels spent,<br>
 How to escape. At last in priuie wise<br>
 To <i>Satyrane</i> she shewed her intent:<br>
 Who glad to gain such fauour, gan deuise,<br>
 How with that pensiue Maid he best might thence arise.</p><p>
  
 So on a day when Satyres all were gone,<br>
 To do their seruice to <i>Syluanus</i> old,<br>
 The gentle virgin left behind alone<br>
 He led away with courage stout and bold.<br>
 Too late it was, to Satyres to be told,<br>
 Or euer hope recouer her againe:<br>
 In vaine he seekes that hauing cannot hold.<br>
 So fast he carried her with carefull paine,<br>
 That they the woods are past, &amp; come now to the plaine.</p><p>
  
 The better part now of the lingring day,<br>
 They traueild had, when as they farre espide<br>
 A wearie wight forwandring by the way,<br>
 And towards him they gan in hast to ride,<br>
 To weet of newes, that did abroad betide,<br>
 Or tydings of her knight of the <i>Redcrosse</i>.<br>
 But he them spying, gan to turne aside,<br>
 For feare as seemd, or for some feigned losse;<br>
 More greedy they of newes, fast towards him do crosse.</p><p>
  
 A silly man, in simple weedes forworne,<br>
 And soild with dust of the long dried way;<br>
 His sandales were with toilesome trauell torne,<br>
 And face all tand with scorching sunny ray,<br>
 As he had traueild many a sommers day,<br>
 Through boyling sands of <i>Arabie</i> and <i>Ynde</i>;<br>
 And in his hand a <i>Iacobs</i> staffe, to stay<br>
 His wearie limbes vpon: and eke behind,<br>
 His scrip did hang, in which his needments he did bind.</p><p>
  
 The knight approching nigh, of him inquerd<br>
 Tydings of warre, and of aduentures new;<br>
 But warres, nor new aduentures none he herd.<br>
 Then <i>Vna</i> gan to aske, if ought he knew,<br>
 Or heard abroad of that her champion trew,<br>
 That in his armour bare a croslet red.<br>
 Aye me, Deare dame (quoth he) well may I rew<br>
 To tell the sad sight, which mine eies haue red:<br>
 These eyes did see that knight both liuing and eke ded.</p><p>
  
 That cruell word her tender hart so thrild,<br>
 That suddein cold did runne through euery vaine,<br>
 And stony horrour all her sences fild<br>
 With dying fit, that downe she fell for paine.<br>
 The knight her lightly reared vp againe,<br>
 And comforted with curteous kind reliefe:<br>
 Then wonne from death, she bad him tellen plaine<br>
 The further processe of her hidden griefe;<br>
 The lesser pangs can beare, who hath endur'd the chiefe.</p><p>
  
 Then gan the Pilgrim thus, I chaunst this day,<br>
 This fatall day, that shall I euer rew,<br>
 To see two knights in trauell on my way<br>
 (A sory sight) arraung'd in battell new,<br>
 Both breathing vengeaunce, both of wrathfull hew:<br>
 My fearefull flesh did tremble at their strife,<br>
 To see their blades so greedily imbrew,<br>
 That drunke with bloud, yet thristed after life:<br>
 What more? the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight was slaine with Paynim knife.</p><p>
  
 Ah dearest Lord (quoth she) how might that bee,<br>
 And he the stoutest knight, that euer wonne?<br>
 Ah dearest dame (quoth he) how might I see<br>
 The thing, that might not be, and yet was donne?<br>
 Where is (said <i>Satyrane</i>) that Paynims sonne,<br>
 That him of life, and vs of ioy hath reft?<br>
 Not far away (quoth he) he hence doth wonne<br>
 Foreby a fountaine, where I late him left<br>
 Washing his bloudy wounds, that through the steele were cleft.</p><p>
  
 Therewith the knight thence marched forth in hast,<br>
 Whiles <i>Vna</i> with huge heauinesse opprest,<br>
 Could not for sorrow follow him so fast;<br>
 And soone he came, as he the place had ghest,<br>
 Whereas that <i>Pagan</i> proud him selfe did rest,<br>
 In secret shadow by a fountaine side:<br>
 Euen he it was, that earst would haue supprest<br>
 Faire <i>Vna</i>: whom when <i>Satyrane</i> espide,<br>
 With fowle reprochfull words he boldly him defide.</p><p>
  
 And said, Arise thou cursed Miscreaunt,<br>
 That hast with knightlesse guile and trecherous train<br>
 Faire knighthood fowly shamed, and doest vaunt<br>
 That good knight of the <i>Redcrosse</i> to haue slain:<br>
 Arise, and with like treason now maintain<br>
 Thy guilty wrong, or else thee guilty yield.<br>
 The Sarazin this hearing, rose amain,<br>
 And catching vp in hast his three square shield,<br>
 And shining helmet, soone him buckled to the field.</p><p>
  
 And drawing nigh him said, Ah misborne Elfe,<br>
 In euill houre thy foes thee hither sent,<br>
 Anothers wrongs to wreake vpon thy selfe:<br>
 Yet ill thou blamest me, for hauing blent<br>
 My name with guile and traiterous intent;<br>
 That <i>Redcrosse</i> knight, perdie, I neuer slew,<br>
 But had he beene, where earst his armes were lent,<br>
 Th'enchaunter vaine his errour should not rew:<br>
 But thou his errour shalt, I hope now prouen trew.</p><p>
  
 Therewith they gan, both furious and fell,<br>
 To thunder blowes, and fiersly to assaile<br>
 Each other bent his enimy to quell,<br>
 That with their force they perst both plate and maile,<br>
 And made wide furrowes in their fleshes fraile,<br>
 That it would pitty any liuing eie.<br>
 Large floods of bloud adowne their sides did raile;<br>
 But floods of bloud could not them satisfie:<br>
 Both hungred after death: both chose to win, or die.</p><p>
  
 So long they fight, and fell reuenge pursue,<br>
 That fainting each, themselues to breathen let,<br>
 And oft refreshed, battell oft renue:<br>
 As when two Bores with rancling malice met,<br>
 Their gory sides fresh bleeding fiercely fret,<br>
 Til breathlesse both them selues aside retire,<br>
 Where foming wrath, their cruell tuskes they whet,<br>
 And trample th'earth, the whiles they may respire;<br>
 Then backe to fight againe, new breathed and entire.</p><p>
  
 So fiersly, when these knights had breathed once,<br>
 They gan to fight returne, increasing more<br>
 Their puissant force, and cruell rage attonce,<br>
 With heaped strokes more hugely, then before,<br>
 That with their drerie wounds and bloudy gore<br>
 They both deformed, scarsely could be known.<br>
 By this sad <i>Vna</i> fraught with anguish sore,<br>
 Led with their noise, which through the aire was thrown:<br>
 Arriu'd, where they in erth their fruitles bloud had sown.</p><p>
  
 Whom all so soone as that proud Sarazin<br>
 Espide, he gan reuiue the memory<br>
 Of his lewd lusts, and late attempted sin,<br>
 And left the doubtfull battell hastily,<br>
 To catch her, newly offred to his eie:<br>
 But <i>Satyrane</i> with strokes him turning, staid,<br>
 And sternely bad him other businesse plie,<br>
 Then hunt the steps of pure vnspotted Maid:<br>
 Wherewith he all enrag'd, these bitter speaches said.</p><p>
  
 O foolish faeries sonne, what furie mad<br>
 Hath thee incenst, to hast thy dolefull fate?<br>
 Were it not better, I that Lady had,<br>
 Then that thou hadst repented it too late?<br>
 Most sencelesse man he, that himselfe doth hate,<br>
 To loue another. Lo then for thine ayd<br>
 Here take thy louers token on thy pate.<br>
 So they to fight; the whiles the royall Mayd<br>
 Fled farre away, of that proud Paynim sore afrayd.</p><p>
  
 But that false <i>Pilgrim</i>, which that leasing told,<br>
 Being in deed old <i>Archimage</i>, did stay<br>
 In secret shadow, all this to behold,<br>
 And much reioyced in their bloudy fray:<br>
 But when he saw the Damsell passe away<br>
 He left his stond, and her pursewd apace,<br>
 In hope to bring her to her last decay.<br>
 But for to tell her lamentable cace,<br>
 And eke this battels end, will need another place.</p><p>
