 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Calidore saues from Maleffort,<br>
 A Damzell vsed vylde:<br>
 Doth vanquish Crudor, and doth make<br>
 Briana wexe more mylde.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 O
 F Court it seemes, men Courtesie doe call,<br>
 For that it there most vseth to abound;<br>
 And well beseemeth that in Princes hall<br>
 That vertue should be plentifully found,<br>
 Which of all goodly manners is the ground,<br>
 And roote of ciuill conuersation.<br>
 Right so in Faery court it did redound,<br>
 Where curteous Knights and Ladies most did won<br>
 Of all on earth, and made a matchlesse paragon.<p>
 
 But mongst them all was none more courteous Knight,<br>
 Then <i>Calidore</i>, beloued ouer all,<br>
 In whom it seemes, that gentlenesse of spright<br>
 And manners mylde were planted naturall;<br>
 To which he adding comely guize withall,<br>
 And gracious speach, did steale mens hearts away.<br>
 Nathlesse thereto he was full stout and tall,<br>
 And well approu'd in batteilous affray,<br>
 That him did much renowme, and far his fame display.</p><p>
 
 Ne was there Knight, ne was there Lady found<br>
 In Faery court, but him did deare embrace,<br>
 For his faire vsage and conditions sound,<br>
 The which in all mens liking gayned place,<br>
 And with the greatest purchast greatest grace:<br>
 Which he could wisely vse, and well apply,<br>
 To please the best, and th'euill to embase.<br>
 For he loathd leasing, and base flattery,<br>
 And loued simple truth and stedfast honesty.</p><p>
 
 And now he was in trauell on his way,<br>
 Vppon an hard aduenture sore bestad,<br>
 Whenas by chaunce he met vppon a day<br>
 With <i>Artegall</i>, returning yet halfe sad<br>
 From his late conquest, which he gotten had.<br>
 Who whenas each of other had a sight,<br>
 They knew them selues, and both their persons rad:<br>
 When <i>Calidore</i> thus first; Haile noblest Knight<br>
 Of all this day on ground, that breathen liuing spright.</p><p>
 
 Now tell, if please you, of the good successe,<br>
 Which ye haue had in your late enterprize.<br>
 To whom Sir <i>Artegall</i> gan to expresse<br>
 His whole exploite, and valorous emprize,<br>
 In order as it did to him arize.<br>
 Now happy man (sayd then Sir <i>Calidore</i>)<br>
 Which haue so goodly, as ye can deuize,<br>
 Atchieu'd so hard a quest, as few before;<br>
 That shall you most renowmed make for euermore.</p><p>
 
 But where ye ended haue, now I begin<br>
 To tread an endlesse trace, withouten guyde,<br>
 Or good direction, how to enter in,<br>
 Or how to issue forth in waies vntryde,<br>
 In perils strange, in labours long and wide;<br>
 In which although good Fortune me befall,<br>
 Yet shall it not by none be testifyde.<br>
 What is that quest (quoth then Sir <i>Artegall</i>)<br>
 That you into such perils presently doth call?</p><p>
 
 The Blattant Beast (quoth he) I doe pursew,<br>
 And through the world incessantly doe chase,<br>
 Till I him ouertake, or else subdew:<br>
 Yet know I not or how, or in what place<br>
 To find him out, yet still I forward trace.<br>
 What is that Blattant Beast? (then he replide)<br>
 It is a Monster bred of hellishe race,<br>
 (Then answerd he) which often hath annoyd<br>
 Good Knights and Ladies true, and many else destroyd.</p><p>
 
 Of <i>Cerberus</i> whilome he was begot,<br>
 And fell <i>Chimaelig;ra</i> in her darkesome den,<br>
 Through fowle commixture of his filthy blot;<br>
 Where he was fostred long in <i>Stygian</i> fen,<br>
 Till he to perfect ripenesse grew, and then<br>
 Into this wicked world he forth was sent,<br>
 To be the plague and scourge of wretched men:<br>
 Whom with vile tongue and venemous intent<br>
 He sore doth wound, and bite, and cruelly torment.</p><p>
 
 Then since the saluage Island I did leaue<br>
 Sayd <i>Artegall</i>, I such a Beast did see,<br>
 The which did seeme a thousand tongues to haue,<br>
 That all in spight and malice did agree,<br>
 With which he bayd and loudly barkt at mee,<br>
 As if that he attonce would me deuoure.<br>
 But I that knew my selfe from perill free,<br>
 Did nought regard his malice nor his powre,<br>
 But he the more his wicked poyson forth did poure.</p><p>
 
 That surely is that Beast (saide <i>Calidore</i>)<br>
 Which I pursue, of whom I am right glad<br>
 To heare these tidings, which of none afore<br>
 Through all my weary trauell I haue had:<br>
 Yet now some hope your words vnto me add.<br>
 Now God you speed (quoth then Sir <i>Artegall</i>)<br>
 And keepe your body from the daunger drad:<br>
 For ye haue much adoe to deale withall.<br>
 So both tooke goodly leaue, and parted seuerall.</p><p>
 
 Sir <i>Calidore</i> thence trauelled not long,<br>
 When as by chaunce a comely Squire he found,<br>
 That thorough some more mighty enemies wrong,<br>
 Both hand and foote vnto a tree was bound:<br>
 Who seeing him from farre, with piteous sound<br>
 Of his shrill cries him called to his aide.<br>
 To whom approching, in that painefull stound<br>
 When he him saw, for no demaunds he staide,<br>
 But first him losde, and afterwards thus to him saide.</p><p>
 
 Vnhappy Squire, what hard mishap thee brought<br>
 Into this bay of perill and disgrace?<br>
 What cruell hand thy wretched thraldome wrought,<br>
 And thee captyued in this shamefull place?<br>
 To whom he answerd thus; My haplesse case<br>
 Is not occasiond through my misdesert,<br>
 But through misfortune, which did me abase<br>
 Vnto this shame, and my young hope subuert,<br>
 Ere that I in her guilefull traines was well expert.</p><p>
 
 Not farre from hence, vppon yond rocky hill,<br>
 Hard by a streight there stands a castle strong,<br>
 Which doth obserue a custome lewd and ill,<br>
 And it hath long mayntaind with mighty wrong:<br>
 For may no Knight nor Lady passe along<br>
 That way, (and yet they needs must passe that way),<br>
 By reason of the streight, and rocks among,<br>
 But they that Ladies lockes doe shaue away,<br>
 And that knights berd for toll, which they for passage pay.</p><p>
 
 A shamefull vse as euer I did heare,<br>
 Sayd <i>Calidore</i>, and to be ouerthrowne.<br>
 But by what meanes did they at first it reare,<br>
 And for what cause, tell if thou haue it knowne.<br>
 Sayd then that Squire: The Lady which doth owne<br>
 This Castle, is by name <i>Briana</i> hight.<br>
 Then which a prouder Lady liueth none:<br>
 She long time hath deare lou'd a doughty Knight,<br>
 And sought to win his loue by all the meanes she might.</p><p>
 
 His name is <i>Crudor</i>, who through high disdaine<br>
 And proud despight of his selfe pleasing mynd,<br>
 Refused hath to yeeld her loue againe,<br>
 Vntill a Mantle she for him doe fynd,<br>
 With beards of Knights and locks of Ladies lynd.<br>
 Which to prouide, she hath this Castle dight,<br>
 And therein hath a Seneschall assynd,<br>
 Cald <i>Maleffort</i>, a man of mickle might,<br>
 Who executes her wicked will, with worse despight.</p><p>
 
 He this same day, as I that way did come<br>
 With a faire Damzell, my beloued deare,<br>
 In execution of her lawlesse doome,<br>
 Did set vppon vs flying both for feare:<br>
 For little bootes against him hand to reare.<br>
 Me first he tooke, vnhable to withstond;<br>
 And whiles he her pursued euery where,<br>
 Till his returne vnto this tree he bond:<br>
 Ne wote I surely, whether her he yet haue fond.</p><p>
 
 Thus whiles they spake, they heard a ruefull shrieke<br>
 Of one loud crying, which they streight way ghest,<br>
 That it was she, the which for helpe did seeke.<br>
 Tho looking vp vnto the cry to lest,<br>
 They saw that Carle from farre, with hand vnblest<br>
 Hayling that mayden by the yellow heare,<br>
 That all her garments from her snowy brest,<br>
 And from her head her lockes he nigh did teare,<br>
 Ne would he spare for pitty, nor refraine for feare.</p><p>
 
 Which haynous sight when <i>Calidore</i> beheld,<br>
 Eftsoones he loosd that Squire, and so him left,<br>
 With hearts dismay and inward dolour queld,<br>
 For to pursue that villaine, which had reft<br>
 That piteous spoile by so iniurious theft.<br>
 Whom ouertaking, loude to him he cryde;<br>
 Leaue faytor quickely that misgotten weft<br>
 To him, that hath it better iustifyde,<br>
 And turne thee soone to him, of whom thou art defyde.</p><p>
 
 Who hearkning to that voice, him selfe vpreard,<br>
 And seeing him so fiercely towardes make,<br>
 Against him stoutly ran, as nought afeard,<br>
 But rather more enrag'd for those words sake;<br>
 And with sterne count'naunce thus vnto him spake.<br>
 Art thou the caytiue, that defyest me,<br>
 And for this Mayd, whose party thou doest take,<br>
 Wilt giue thy beard, though it but little bee?<br>
 Yet shall it not her lockes for raunsome fro me free.</p><p>
 
 With that he fiercely at him flew, and layd<br>
 On hideous strokes with most importune might,<br>
 That oft he made him stagger as vnstayd,<br>
 And oft recuile to shunne his sharpe despight.<br>
 But <i>Calidore</i>, that was well skild in fight,<br>
 Him long forbore, and still his spirite spar'd,<br>
 Lying in waite, how him he damadge might.<br>
 But when he felt him shrinke, and come to ward,<br>
 He greater grew, and gan to driue at him more hard.</p><p>
 
 Like as a water streame, whose swelling sourse<br>
 Shall driue a Mill, within strong bancks is pent,<br>
 And long restrayned of his ready course;<br>
 So soone as passage is vnto him lent,<br>
 Breakes forth, and makes his way more violent.<br>
 Such was the fury of Sir <i>Calidore</i>,<br>
 When once he felt his foeman to relent;<br>
 He fiercely him pursu'd, and pressed sore,<br>
 Who as he still decayd, so he encreased more.</p><p>
 
 The heauy burden of whose dreadfull might<br>
 When as the Carle no longer could sustaine,<br>
 His heart gan faint, and streight he tooke his flight<br>
 Toward the Castle, where if need constraine,<br>
 His hope of refuge vsed to remaine.<br>
 Whom <i>Calidore</i> perceiuing fast to flie,<br>
 He him pursu'd and chaced through the plaine,<br>
 That he for dread of death gan loude to crie<br>
 Vnto the ward, to open to him hastilie.</p><p>
 
 They from the wall him seeing so aghast,<br>
 The gate soone opened to receiue him in,<br>
 But <i>Calidore</i> did follow him so fast,<br>
 That euen in the Porch he him did win,<br>
 And cleft his head asunder to his chin.<br>
 The carkasse tumbling downe within the dore,<br>
 Did choke the entraunce with a lumpe of sin,<br>
 That it could not be shut, whilest <i>Calidore</i><br>
 Did enter in, and slew the Porter on the flore.</p><p>
 
 With that the rest, the which the Castle kept,<br>
 About him flockt, and hard at him did lay;<br>
 But he them all from him full lightly swept,<br>
 As doth a Steare, in heat of sommers day,<br>
 With his long taile the bryzes brush away.<br>
 Thence passing forth, into the hall he came,<br>
 Where of the Lady selfe in sad dismay<br>
 He was ymett, who with vncomely shame<br>
 Gan him salute, and fowle vpbrayd with faulty blame.</p><p>
 
 False traytor Knight, (sayd she) no Knight at all,<br>
 But scorne of armes that hast with guilty hand<br>
 Murdred my men, and slaine my Seneschall;<br>
 Now comest thou to rob my house vnmand,<br>
 And spoile my selfe, that can not thee withstand?<br>
 Yet doubt thou not, but that some better Knight<br>
 Then thou, that shall thy treason vnderstand,<br>
 Will it auenge, and pay thee with thy right:<br>
 And if none do, yet shame shal thee with shame requight.</p><p>
 
 Much was the Knight abashed at that word;<br>
 Yet answerd thus; Not vnto me the shame,<br>
 But to the shamefull doer it afford.<br>
 Bloud is no blemish; for it is no blame<br>
 To punish those, that doe deserue the same;<br>
 But they that breake bands of ciuilitie,<br>
 And wicked customes make, those doe defame<br>
 Both noble armes and gentle curtesie.<br>
 No greater shame to man then inhumanitie.</p><p>
 
 Then doe your selfe, for dread of shame, forgoe<br>
 This euill manner, which ye here maintaine,<br>
 And doe in stead thereof mild curt'sie showe<br>
 To all, that passe. That shall you glory gaine<br>
 More then his loue, which thus ye seeke t'obtaine.<br>
 Wherewith all full of wrath, she thus replyde;<br>
 Vile recreant, know that I doe much disdaine<br>
 Thy courteous lore, that doest my loue deride,<br>
 Who scornes thy ydle scoffe, and bids thee be defyde.</p><p>
 
 To take defiaunce at a Ladies word<br>
 (Quoth he) I hold it no indignity;<br>
 But were he here, that would it with his sword<br>
 Abett, perhaps he mote it deare aby.<br>
 Cowherd (quoth she) were not, that thou wouldst fly,<br>
 Ere he doe come, he should be soone in place.<br>
 If I doe so, (sayd he) then liberty<br>
 I leaue to you, for aye me to disgrace<br>
 With all those shames, that erst ye spake me to deface.</p><p>
 
 With that a Dwarfe she cald to her in hast,<br>
 And taking from her hand a ring of gould,<br>
 A priuy token, which betweene them past,<br>
 Bad him to flie with all the speed he could,<br>
 To <i>Crudor</i>, and desire him that he would<br>
 Vouchsafe to reskue her against a Knight,<br>
 Who through strõg powre had now her self in hould,<br>
 Hauing late slaine her Seneschall in fight,<br>
 And all her people murdred with outragious might.</p><p>
 
 The Dwarfe his way did hast, and went all night;<br>
 But <i>Calidore</i> did with her there abyde<br>
 The comming of that so much threatned Knight,<br>
 Where that discourteous Dame with scornfull pryde,<br>
 And fowle entreaty him indignifyde,<br>
 That yron heart it hardly could sustaine:<br>
 Yet he, that could his wrath full wisely guyde,<br>
 Did well endure her womanish disdaine,<br>
 And did him selfe from fraile impatience refraine.</p><p>
 
 The morrow next, before the lampe of light,<br>
 Aboue the earth vpreard his flaming head,<br>
 The Dwarfe, which bore that message to her knight,<br>
 Brought aunswere backe, that ere he tasted bread,<br>
 He would her succour, and aliue or dead<br>
 Her foe deliuer vp into her hand:<br>
 Therefore he wild her doe away all dread;<br>
 And that of him she mote assured stand,<br>
 He sent to her his basenet, as a faithfull band.</p><p>
 
 Thereof full blyth the Lady streight became,<br>
 And gan t'augment her bitternesse much more:<br>
 Yet no whit more appalled for the same,<br>
 Ne ought dismayed was Sir <i>Calidore</i>,<br>
 But rather did more chearefull seeme therefore.<br>
 And hauing soone his armes about him dight,<br>
 Did issue forth, to meete his foe afore;<br>
 Where long he stayed not, when as a Knight<br>
 He spide come pricking on with al his powre and might.</p><p>
 
 Well weend he streight, that he should be the same,<br>
 Which tooke in hand her quarrell to maintaine;<br>
 Ne stayd to aske if it were he by name,<br>
 But coucht his speare, and ran at him amaine.<br>
 They bene ymett in middest of the plaine,<br>
 With so fell fury, and dispiteous forse,<br>
 That neither could the others stroke sustaine,<br>
 But rudely rowld to ground both man and horse,<br>
 Neither of other taking pitty nor remorse.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Calidore</i> vprose againe full light,<br>
 Whiles yet his foe lay fast in sencelesse sound,<br>
 Yet would he not him hurt, although he might:<br>
 For shame he weend a sleeping wight to wound.<br>
 But when <i>Briana</i> saw that drery stound,<br>
 There where she stood vppon the Castle wall,<br>
 She deem'd him sure to haue bene dead on ground,<br>
 And made such piteous mourning therewithall,<br>
 That from the battlements she ready seem'd to fall.</p><p>
 
 Nathlesse at length him selfe he did vpreare<br>
 In lustlesse wise, as if against his will,<br>
 Ere he had slept his fill, he wakened were,<br>
 And gan to stretch his limbs; which feeling ill<br>
 Of his late fall, a while he rested still:<br>
 But when he saw his foe before in vew,<br>
 He shooke off luskishnesse, and courage chill<br>
 Kindling a fresh, gan battell to renew,<br>
 To proue if better foote then horsebacke would ensew.</p><p>
 
 There then began a fearefull cruell fray<br>
 Betwixt them two, for maystery of might.<br>
 For both were wondrous practicke in that play,<br>
 And passing well expert in single fight,<br>
 And both inflam'd with furious despight:<br>
 Which as it still encreast, so still increast<br>
 Their cruell strokes and terrible affright;<br>
 Ne once for ruth their rigour they releast,<br>
 Ne once to breath a while their angers tempest ceast.</p><p>
 
 Thus long they trac'd and trauerst to and fro,<br>
 And tryde all waies, how each mote entrance make<br>
 Into the life of his malignant foe;<br>
 They hew'd their helmes, and plates asunder brake,<br>
 As they had potshares bene; for nought mote slake<br>
 Their greedy vengeaunces, but goary blood,<br>
 That at the last like to a purple lake<br>
 Of bloudy gore congeal'd about them stood,<br>
 Which from their riuen sides forth gushed like a flood.</p><p>
 
 At length it chaunst, that both their hands on hie,<br>
 At once did heaue, with all their powre and might,<br>
 Thinking the vtmost of their force to trie,<br>
 And proue the finall fortune of the fight:<br>
 But <i>Calidore</i>, that was more quicke of sight,<br>
 And nimbler handed, then his enemie,<br>
 Preuented him before his stroke could light,<br>
 And on the helmet smote him formerlie,<br>
 That made him stoupe to ground with meeke humilitie.</p><p>
 
 And ere he could recouer foot againe,<br>
 He following that faire aduantage fast,<br>
 His stroke redoubled with such might and maine,<br>
 That him vpon the ground he groueling cast;<br>
 And leaping to him light, would haue vnlast<br>
 His Helme, to make vnto his vengeance way.<br>
 Who seeing, in what daunger he was plast,<br>
 Cryde out, Ah mercie Sir, doe me not slay,<br>
 But saue my life, which lot before your foot doth lay.</p><p>
 
 With that his mortall hand a while he stayd,<br>
 And hauing somewhat calm'd his wrathfull heat<br>
 With goodly patience, thus he to him sayd;<br>
 And is the boast of that proud Ladies threat,<br>
 That menaced me from the field to beat,<br>
 Now brought to this? By this now may ye learne,<br>
 Strangers no more so rudely to intreat,<br>
 But put away proud looke, and vsage sterne,<br>
 The which shal nought to you but foule dishonor yearne.</p><p>
 
 For nothing is more blamefull to a knight,<br>
 That court'sie doth as well as armes professe,<br>
 How euer strong and fortunate in fight,<br>
 Then the reproch of pride and cruelnesse.<br>
 In vaine he seeketh others to suppresse,<br>
 Who hath not learnd him selfe first to subdew:<br>
 All flesh is frayle, and full of ficklenesse,<br>
 Subiect to fortunes chance, still chaunging new;<br>
 What haps to day to me, to morrow may to you.</p><p>
 
 Who will not mercie vnto others shew,<br>
 How can he mercy euer hope to haue?<br>
 To pay each with his owne is right and dew.<br>
 Yet since ye mercie now doe need to craue,<br>
 I will it graunt, your hopelesse life to saue;<br>
 With these conditions, which I will propound:<br>
 First, that ye better shall your selfe behaue<br>
 Vnto all errant knights, whereso on ground;<br>
 Next that ye Ladies ayde in euery stead and stound.</p><p>
 
 The wretched man, that all this while did dwell<br>
 In dread of death, his heasts did gladly heare,<br>
 And promist to performe his precept well,<br>
 And whatsoeuer else he would requere.<br>
 So suffring him to rise, he made him sweare<br>
 By his owne sword, and by the crosse thereon,<br>
 To take <i>Briana</i> for his louing fere,<br>
 Withouten dowre or composition;<br>
 But to release his former foule condition.</p><p>
 
 All which accepting, and with faithfull oth<br>
 Bynding himselfe most firmely to obay,<br>
 He vp arose, how euer liefe or loth,<br>
 And swore to him true fealtie for aye.<br>
 Then forth he cald from sorrowfull dismay<br>
 The sad <i>Briana</i>, which all this beheld:<br>
 Who comming forth yet full of late affray,<br>
 Sir <i>Calidore</i> vpcheard, and to her teld<br>
 All this accord, to which he <i>Crudor</i> had compeld.</p><p>
 
 Whereof she now more glad, then sory earst,<br>
 All ouercome with infinite affect,<br>
 For his exceeding courtesie, that pearst<br>
 Her stubborne hart with inward deepe effect,<br>
 Before his feet her selfe she did proiect,<br>
 And him adoring as her liues deare Lord,<br>
 With all due thankes, and dutifull respect,<br>
 Her selfe acknowledg'd bound for that accord,<br>
 By which he had to her both life and loue restord.</p><p>
 
 So all returning to the Castle glad,<br>
 Most ioyfully she them did entertaine,<br>
 Where goodly glee and feast to them she made,<br>
 To shew her thankefull mind and meaning faine,<br>
 By all the meanes she mote it best explaine:<br>
 And after all, vnto Sir <i>Calidore</i><br>
 She freely gaue that Castle for his paine,<br>
 And her selfe bound to him for euermore;<br>
 So wondrously now chaung'd, from that she was afore.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Calidore</i> himselfe would not retaine<br>
 Nor land nor fee, for hyre of his good deede,<br>
 But gaue them streight vnto that Squire againe,<br>
 Whom from her Seneschall he lately freed,<br>
 And to his damzell as their rightfull meed,<br>
 For recompence of all their former wrong:<br>
 There he remaind with them right well agreed,<br>
 Till of his wounds he wexed hole and strong,<br>
 And then to his first quest he passed forth along.</p><p>
