 <i>Artegall heares of Florimell,<br>
 Does with the Pagan fight:<br>
 Him slaies, drownes Lady Munera<br>
 Does race her castle quight.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 N
 Ought is more honorable to a knight,<br>
 Ne better doth beseeme braue cheualry,<br>
 Then to defend the feeble in their right,<br>
 And wrong redresse in such as wend awry.<br>
 Whilome those great Heroes got thereby<br>
 Their greatest glory, for their rightfull deedes,<br>
 And place deserued with the Gods on hy.<br>
 Herein the noblesse of this knight exceedes,<br>
 Who now to perils great for iustice sake proceedes.<p>
 
 To which as he now was vppon the way,<br>
 He chaunst to meet a Dwarfe in hasty course;<br>
 Whom he requir'd his forward hast to stay,<br>
 Till he of tidings mote with him discourse.<br>
 Loth was the Dwarfe, yet did he stay perforse,<br>
 And gan of sundry newes his store to tell,<br>
 As to his memory they had recourse:<br>
 But chiefely of the fairest <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
 How she was found againe, and spousde to <i>Marinell</i>.</p><p>
 
 For this was <i>Dony</i>, <i>Florimels</i> owne Dwarfe,<br>
 Whom hauing lost (as ye haue heard whyleare)<br>
 And finding in the way the scattred scarfe,<br>
 The fortune of her life long time did feare.<br>
 But of her health when <i>Artegall</i> did heare,<br>
 And safe returne, he was full inly glad,<br>
 And askt him where, and when her bridale cheare<br>
 Should be solemniz'd: for if time he had,<br>
 He would be there, and honor to her spousall ad.</p><p>
 
 Within three daies (quoth hee) as I do here,<br>
 It will be at the Castle of the strond;<br>
 What time if naught me let, I will be there<br>
 To doe her seruice, so as I am bond.<br>
 But in my way a little here beyond<br>
 A cursed cruell Sarazin doth wonne,<br>
 That keepes a Bridges passage by strong hond,<br>
 And many errant Knights hath there fordonne;<br>
 That makes all men for feare that passage for to shonne.</p><p>
 
 What mister wight (quoth he) and how far hence<br>
 Is he, that doth to trauellers such harmes?<br>
 He is (said he) a man of great defence;<br>
 Expert in battell and in deedes of armes;<br>
 And more emboldned by the wicked charmes,<br>
 With which his daughter doth him still support;<br>
 Hauing great Lordships got and goodly farmes,<br>
 Through strong oppression of his powre extort;<br>
 By which he stil them holds, &amp; keepes with strong effort.</p><p>
 
 And dayly he his wrongs encreaseth more,<br>
 For neuer wight he lets to passe that way,<br>
 Ouer his Bridge, albee he rich or poore,<br>
 But he him makes his passage-penny pay:<br>
 Else he doth hold him backe or beat away.<br>
 Thereto he hath a groome of euill guize,<br>
 Whose scalp is bare, that bondage doth bewray,<br>
 Which pols and pils the poore in piteous wize;<br>
 But he him selfe vppon th rich doth tyrannize.</p><p>
 
 His name is hight <i>Pollente</i>, rightly so<br>
 For that he is so puissant and strong,<br>
 That with his powre he all doth ouergo,<br>
 And makes them subiect to his mighty wrong;<br>
 And some by sleight he eke doth vnderfong.<br>
 For on a Bridge he custometh to fight,<br>
 Which is but narrow, but exceeding long;<br>
 And in the same are many trap fals pight,<br>
 Through which the rider downe doth fall through ouersight.</p><p>
 
 And vnderneath the same a riuer flowes,<br>
 That is both swift and dangerous deepe withall;<br>
 Into the which whomso he ouerthrowes,<br>
 All destitute of helpe doth headlong fall,<br>
 But he him selfe, through practise vsuall,<br>
 Leapes forth into the floud, and there assaies<br>
 His foe confused through his sodaine fall,<br>
 That horse and man he equally dismaies,<br>
 And either both them drownes, or trayterously slaies.</p><p>
 
 Then doth he take the spoile of them at will,<br>
 And to his daughter brings, that dwels thereby:<br>
 Who all that comes doth take, and therewith fill<br>
 The coffers of her wicked threasury;<br>
 Which she with wrongs hath heaped vp so hy,<br>
 That many Princes she in wealth exceedes,<br>
 And purchast all the countrey lying ny<br>
 With the reuenue of her plenteous meedes:<br>
 Her name is <i>Munera</i>, agreeing with her deedes.</p><p>
 
 Thereto she is full faire, and rich attired,<br>
 With golden hands and siluer feete beside,<br>
 That many Lords haue her to wife desired:<br>
 But she them all despiseth for great pride.<br>
 Now by my life (sayd he) and God to guide,<br>
 None other way will I this day betake,<br>
 But by that Bridge, whereas he doth abide:<br>
 Therefore me thither lead.  No more he spake,<br>
 But thitherward forthright his ready way did make.</p><p>
 
 Vnto the place he came within a while,<br>
 Where on the Bridge he ready armed saw<br>
 The Sarazin, awayting for some spoile.<br>
 Who as they to the passage gan to draw,<br>
 A villaine to them came with scull all raw,<br>
 That passage money did of them require,<br>
 According to the custome of their law.<br>
 To whom he aunswerd wroth, Loe there thy hire;<br>
 And with that word him strooke, that streight he did expire.</p><p>
 
 Which when the Pagan saw, he wexed wroth,<br>
 And streight him selfe vnto the fight addrest,<br>
 Ne was Sir <i>Artegall</i> behinde: so both<br>
 Together ran with ready speares in rest.<br>
 Right in the midst, whereas they brest to brest<br>
 Should meete, a trap was letten downe to fall<br>
 Into the floud: streight leapt the Carle vnblest,<br>
 Well weening that his foe was falne withall:<br>
 But he was well aware, and leapt before his fall.</p><p>
 
 There being both together in the floud,<br>
 They each at other tyrannously flew;<br>
 Ne ought the water cooled their whot bloud,<br>
 But rather in them kindled choler new.<br>
 But there the Paynim, who that vse well knew<br>
 To fight in water, great aduantage had,<br>
 That oftentimes him nigh he ouerthrew:<br>
 And eke the courser, whereuppon he rad,<br>
 Could swim like to a fish, whiles he his backe bestrad.</p><p>
 
 Which oddes when as Sir <i>Artegall</i> espide,<br>
 He saw no way, but close with him in hast;<br>
 And to him driuing strongly downe the tide,<br>
 Vppon his iron coller griped fast,<br>
 That with the straint his wesand nigh he brast.<br>
 There they together stroue and struggled long,<br>
 Either the other from his steede to cast;<br>
 Ne euer <i>Artegall</i> his griple strong<br>
 For any thing wold slacke, but still vppon him hong.</p><p>
 
 As when a Dolphin and a Sele are met,<br>
 In the wide champian of the Ocean plaine:<br>
 With cruell chaufe their courages they whet,<br>
 The maysterdome of each by force to gaine,<br>
 And dreadfull battaile twixt them do darraine:<br>
 They snuf, they snort, they bo˜uce, they rage, they rore,<br>
 That all the sea disturbed with their traine,<br>
 Doth frie with fome aboue the surges hore.<br>
 Such was betwixt these two the troublesome vprore.</p><p>
 
 So <i>Artegall</i> at length him forst forsake<br>
 His horses backe, for dread of being drownd,<br>
 And to his handy swimming him betake.<br>
 Eftsoones him selfe he from his hold vnbownd,<br>
 And then no ods at all in him he fownd:<br>
 For <i>Artegall</i> in swimming skilfull was,<br>
 And durst the depth of any water sownd.<br>
 So ought each Knight, that vse of perill has,<br>
 In swimming be expert through waters force to pas.</p><p>
 
 Then very doubtfull was the warres euent,<br>
 Vncertaine whether had the better side:<br>
 For both were skild in that experiment,<br>
 And both in armes well traind and throughly tride.<br>
 But <i>Artegall</i> was better breath'd beside,<br>
 And towards th'end, grew greater in his might,<br>
 That his faint foe no longer could abide<br>
 His puissance, ne beare him selfe vpright,<br>
 But from the water to the land betooke his flight.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Artegall</i> pursewd him still so neare,<br>
 With bright Chrysaor in his cruell hand,<br>
 That as his head he gan a litle reare<br>
 Aboue the brincke, to tread vpon the land,<br>
 He smote it off, that tumbling on the strand<br>
 It bit the earth for very fell despight,<br>
 And gnashed with his teeth, as if he band<br>
 High God, whose goodnesse he despaired quight,<br>
 Or curst the hand, which did that vengẽace on him dight.</p><p>
 
 His corps was carried downe along the Lee,<br>
 Whose waters with his filthy bloud it stayned:<br>
 But his blasphemous head, that all might see,<br>
 He pitcht vpon a pole on high ordayned;<br>
 Where many years it afterwards remayned,<br>
 To be a mirrour to all mighty men,<br>
 In whose right hands great power is contayned,<br>
 That none of them the feeble ouerren,<br>
 But alwaies doe their powre within iust compasse pen.</p><p>
 
 That done, vnto the Castle he did wend,<br>
 In which the Paynims daughter did abide,<br>
 Guarded of many which did her defend:<br>
 Of whom he entrance sought, but was denide,<br>
 And with reprochfull blasphemy defide,<br>
 Beaten with stones downe from the battilment,<br>
 That he was forced to withdraw aside;<br>
 And bad his seruant <i>Talus</i> to inuent<br>
 Which way he enter might, without endangerment.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones his Page drew to the Castle gate,<br>
 And with his iron flale at it let flie,<br>
 That all the warders it did sore amate,<br>
 The which erewhile spake so reprochfully,<br>
 And made them stoupe, that looked earst so hie.<br>
 Yet still he bet, and bounst vppon the dore,<br>
 And thundred strokes thereon so hideouslie,<br>
 That all the peece he shaked from the flore,<br>
 And filled all the house with feare and great vprore.</p><p>
 
 With noise whereof the Lady forth appeared<br>
 Vppon the Castle wall, and when she saw<br>
 The daungerous state, in which she stood, she feared<br>
 The sad effect of her neare ouerthrow;<br>
 And gan entreat that iron man below,<br>
 To cease his outrage, and him faire besought,<br>
 Sith neither force of stones which they did throw,<br>
 Nor powr of charms, which she against him wrought,<br>
 Might otherwise preuaile, or make him cease for ought.</p><p>
 
 But when as yet she saw him to proceede,<br>
 Vnmou'd with praiers, or with piteous thought,<br>
 She ment him to corrupt with goodly meede;<br>
 And causde great sackes with endlesse riches fraught,<br>
 Vnto the battilment to be vpbrought,<br>
 And powred forth ouer the Castle wall,<br>
 That she might win some time, though dearly bought<br>
 Whilest he to gathering of the gold did fall.<br>
 But he was nothing mou'd, nor tempted therewithall.</p><p>
 
 But still continu'd his assault the more,<br>
 And layd on load with his huge yron flaile,<br>
 That at the length he has yrent the dore,<br>
 And made way for his maister to assaile.<br>
 Who being entred, nought did then auaile<br>
 For wight, against his powre them selues to reare:<br>
 Each one did flie; their hearts began to faile,<br>
 And hid them selues in corners here and there;<br>
 And eke their dame halfe dead did hide her self for feare.</p><p>
 
 Long they her sought, yet no where could they finde her,<br>
 That sure they ween'd she was escapt away:<br>
 But <i>Talus</i>, that could like a limehound winde her,<br>
 And all things secrete wisely could bewray,<br>
 At length found out, whereas she hidden lay<br>
 Vnder an heape of gold.  Thence he her drew<br>
 By the faire lockes, and fowly did array,<br>
 Withouten pitty of her goodly hew,<br>
 That <i>Artegall</i> him selfe her seemelesse plight did rew.</p><p>
 
 Yet for no pitty would he change the course<br>
 Of Iustice, which in <i>Talus</i> hand did lye;<br>
 Who rudely hayld her forth without remorse,<br>
 Still holding vp her suppliant hands on hye,<br>
 And kneeling at his feete submissiuely.<br>
 But he her suppliant hands, those hands of gold,<br>
 And eke her feete, those feete of siluer trye,<br>
 Which sought vnrighteousnesse, and iustice sold,<br>
 Chopt off, and nayld on high, that all might thẽ behold.</p><p>
 
 Her selfe then tooke he by the sclender wast,<br>
 In vaine loud crying, and into the flood<br>
 Ouer the Castle wall adowne her cast,<br>
 And there her drowned in the durty mud:<br>
 But the streame washt away her guilty blood.<br>
 Thereafter all that mucky pelfe he tooke,<br>
 The spoile of peoples euill gotten good,<br>
 The which her sire had scrap't by hooke and crooke;<br>
 And burning all to ashes, powr'd it downe the brooke.</p><p>
 
 And lastly all that Castle quite he raced,<br>
 Euen from the sole of his foundation,<br>
 And all the hewen stones thereof defaced,<br>
 That there mote be no hope of reparation,<br>
 Nor memory thereof to any nation.<br>
 All which when <i>Talus</i> throughly had perfourmed,<br>
 Sir <i>Artegall</i> vndid the euill fashion,<br>
 And wicked customes of that Bridge refourmed.<br>
 Which done, vnto his former iourney he retourned.</p><p>
 
 In which they measur'd mickle weary way,<br>
 Till that at length nigh to the sea they drew;<br>
 By which as they did trauell on a day,<br>
 They saw before them, far as they could vew,<br>
 Full many people gathered in a crew:<br>
 Whose great assembly they did much admire,<br>
 For neuer there the like resort they knew.<br>
 So towardes them they coasted, to enquire<br>
 What thing so many nations met, did there desire.</p><p>
 
 There they beheld a mighty Gyant stand<br>
 Vpon a rocke, and holding forth on hie<br>
 An huge great paire of ballance in his hand,<br>
 With which he boasted in his surquedrie,<br>
 That all the world he would weigh equallie,<br>
 If ought he had the same to counterpoys.<br>
 For want whereof he weighed vanity,<br>
 And fild his ballaunce full of idle toys:<br>
 Yet was admired much of fooles, women, and boys.</p><p>
 
 He sayd that he would all the earth vptake,<br>
 And all the sea, deuided each from either:<br>
 So would he of the fire one ballaunce make,<br>
 And one of th'ayre, without or wind, or wether:<br>
 Then would he ballaunce heauen and hell together,<br>
 And all that did within them all containe;<br>
 Of all whose weight, he would not misse a fether.<br>
 And looke what surplus did of each remaine,<br>
 He would to his owne part restore the same againe.</p><p>
 
 For why, he sayd they all vnequall were,<br>
 And had encroched vppon others share,<br>
 Like as the sea (which plaine he shewed there)<br>
 Had worne the earth, so did the fire the aire;<br>
 So all the rest did others parts empaire.<br>
 And so were realmes and nations run awry.<br>
 All which he vndertooke for to repaire,<br>
 In sort as they were formed aunciently;<br>
 And all things would reduce vnto equality.</p><p>
 
 Therefore the vulgar did about him flocke,<br>
 And cluster thicke vnto his leasings vaine,<br>
 Like foolish flies about an hony crocke,<br>
 In hope by him great benefite to gaine,<br>
 And vncontrolled freedome to obtaine.<br>
 All which when <i>Artegall</i> did see, and heare,<br>
 How he mis-led the simple peoples traine,<br>
 In sdeignfull wize he drew vnto him neare,<br>
 And thus vnto him spake, without regard or feare;</p><p>
 
 Thou that presum'st to weigh the world anew,<br>
 And all things to an equall to restore,<br>
 In stead of right me seemes great wrong dost shew,<br>
 And far aboue thy forces pitch to sore.<br>
 For ere thou limit what is lesse or more<br>
 In euery thing, thou oughtest first to know,<br>
 What was the poyse of euery part of yore:<br>
 And looke then how much it doth ouerflow,<br>
 Or faile thereof, so much is more then iust to trow.</p><p>
 
 For at the first they all created were<br>
 In goodly measure, by their Makers might,<br>
 And weighed out in ballaunces so nere,<br>
 That not a dram was missing of their right,<br>
 The earth was in the middle centre pight,<br>
 In which it doth immoueable abide,<br>
 Hemd in with waters like a wall in sight;<br>
 And they with aire, that not a drop can slide:<br>
 Al which the heauens containe, &amp; in their courses guide.</p><p>
 
 Such heauenly iustice doth among them raine,<br>
 That euery one doe know their certaine bound,<br>
 In which they doe these many yeares remaine,<br>
 And mongst them al no change hath yet beene found.<br>
 But if thou now shouldst weigh them new in pound,<br>
 We are not sure they would so long remaine:<br>
 All change is perillous, and all chaunce vnsound.<br>
 Therefore leaue off to weigh them all againe,<br>
 Till we may be assur'd they shall their course retaine.</p><p>
 
 Thou foolishe Elfe (said then the Gyant wroth)<br>
 Seest not, how badly all things present bee,<br>
 And each estate quite out of order go'th?<br>
 The sea it selfe doest thou not plainely see<br>
 Encroch vppon the land there vnder thee;<br>
 And th'earth it selfe how daily its increast,<br>
 By all that dying to it turned be?<br>
 Were it not good that wrong were then surceast,<br>
 And from the most, that some were giuen to the least?</p><p>
 
 Therefore I will throw downe these mountaines hie,<br>
 And make them leuell with the lowly plaine:<br>
 These towring rocks, which reach vnto the skie,<br>
 I will thrust downe into the deepest maine,<br>
 And as they were, them equalize againe.<br>
 Tyrants that make men subiect to their law,<br>
 I will suppresse, that they no more may raine;<br>
 And Lordings curbe, that commons ouer-aw;<br>
 And all the wealth of rich men to the poore will draw.</p><p>
 
 Of things vnseene how canst thou deeme aright,<br>
 Then answered the righteous <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
 Sith thou misdeem'st so much of things in sight?<br>
 What though the sea with waues continuall<br>
 Doe eate the earth, it is no more at all:<br>
 Ne is the earth the lesse, or loseth ought,<br>
 For whatsoeuer from one place doth fall,<br>
 Is with the tide vnto an other brought:<br>
 For there is nothing lost, that may be found, if sought.</p><p>
 
 Likewise the earth is not augmented more,<br>
 By all that dying into it doe fade.<br>
 For of the earth they formed were of yore;<br>
 How euer gay their blossome or their blade<br>
 Doe flourish now, they into dust shall vade.<br>
 What wrong then is it, if that when they die,<br>
 They turne to that, whereof they first were made?<br>
 All in the powre of their great Maker lie:<br>
 All creatures must obey the voice of the most hie.</p><p>
 
 They liue, they die, like as he doth ordaine,<br>
 Ne euer any asketh reason why.<br>
 The hils doe not the lowly dales disdaine;<br>
 The dales doe not the lofty hils enuy.<br>
 He maketh Kings to sit in souerainty;<br>
 He maketh subiects to their powre obay;<br>
 He pulleth downe, he setteth vp on hy;<br>
 He giues to this, from that he takes away.<br>
 For all we haue is his: what he list doe, he may.</p><p>
 
 What euer thing is done, by him is donne,<br>
 Ne any may his mighty will withstand;<br>
 Ne any may his soueraine power shonne,<br>
 Ne loose that he hath bound with stedfast band.<br>
 In vaine therefore doest thou now take in hand,<br>
 To call to count, or weigh his workes anew,<br>
 Whose counsels depth thou canst not vnderstand,<br>
 Sith of things subiect to thy daily vew<br>
 Thou doest not know the causes, nor their courses dew.</p><p>
 
 For take thy ballaunce, if thou be so wise,<br>
 And weigh the winde, that vnder heauen doth blow;<br>
 Or weigh the light, that in the East doth rise;<br>
 Or weigh the thought, that frõ mans mind doth flow.<br>
 But if the weight of these thou canst not show,<br>
 Weigh but one word which from thy lips doth fall.<br>
 For how canst thou those greater secrets know,<br>
 That doest not know the least thing of them all?<br>
 Ill can he rule the great, that cannot reach the small.</p><p>
 
 Therewith the Gyant much abashed sayd;<br>
 That he of little things made reckoning light,<br>
 Yet the least word that euer could be layd<br>
 Within his ballaunce, he could way aright.<br>
 Which is (sayd he) more heauy then in weight,<br>
 The right or wrong, the false or else the trew?<br>
 He answered, that he would try it streight,<br>
 So he the words into his ballaunce threw,<br>
 But streight the winged words out of his ballaunce flew.</p><p>
 
 Wroth wext he then, and sayd, that words were light,<br>
 Ne would within his ballaunce well abide.<br>
 But he could iustly weigh the wrong or right.<br>
 Well then, sayd <i>Artegall</i>, let it be tride.<br>
 First in one ballance set the true aside.<br>
 He did so first; and then the false he layd<br>
 In th'other scale; but still it downe did slide,<br>
 And by no meane could in the weight be stayd.<br>
 For by no meanes the false will with the truth be wayd.</p><p>
 
 Now take the right likewise, sayd <i>Artegale</i>,<br>
 And counterpeise the same with so much wrong.<br>
 So first the right he put into one scale;<br>
 And then the Gyant stroue with puissance strong<br>
 To fill the other scale with so much wrong.<br>
 But all the wrongs that he therein could lay,<br>
 Might not it peise; yet did he labour long,<br>
 And swat, and chauf'd, and proued euery way:<br>
 Yet all the wrongs could not a litle right downe lay.</p><p>
 
 Which when he saw, he greatly grew in rage,<br>
 And almost would his balances haue broken:<br>
 But <i>Artegall</i> him fairely gan asswage,<br>
 And said; Be not vpon thy balance wroken:<br>
 For they doe nought but right or wrong betoken;<br>
 But in the mind the doome of right must bee;<br>
 And so likewise of words, the which be spoken,<br>
 The eare must be the ballance, to decree<br>
 And iudge, whether with truth or falshood they agree.</p><p>
 
 But set the truth and set the right aside,<br>
 For they with wrong or falshood will not fare;<br>
 And put two wrongs together to be tride,<br>
 Or else two falses, of each equall share;<br>
 And then together doe them both compare.<br>
 For truth is one, and right is euer one.<br>
 So did he, and then plaine it did appeare,<br>
 Whether of them the greater were attone.<br>
 But right sate in the middest of the beame alone.</p><p>
 
 But he the right from thence did thrust away,<br>
 For it was not the right, which he did seeke;<br>
 But rather stroue extremities to way,<br>
 Th'one to diminish, th'other for to eeke.<br>
 For of the meane he greatly did misleeke.<br>
 Whom when so lewdly minded <i>Talus</i> found,<br>
 Approching nigh vnto him cheeke by cheeke,<br>
 He shouldered him from off the higher ground,<br>
 And down the rock him throwing, in the sea him dround.</p><p>
 
 Like as a ship, whom cruell tempest driues<br>
 Vpon a rocke with horrible dismay,<br>
 Her shattered ribs in thousand peeces riues,<br>
 And spoyling all her geares and goodly ray,<br>
 Does make her selfe misfortunes piteous pray.<br>
 So downe the cliffe the wretched Gyant tumbled;<br>
 His battred ballances in peeces lay,<br>
 His timbered bones all broken rudely rumbled:<br>
 So was the high aspyring with huge ruine humbled.</p><p>
 
 That when the people, which had there about<br>
 Long wayted, saw his sudden desolation,<br>
 They gan to gather in tumultuous rout,<br>
 And mutining, to stirre vp ciuill faction,<br>
 For certaine losse of so great expectation.<br>
 For well they hoped to haue got great good,<br>
 And wondrous riches by his innouation.<br>
 Therefore resoluing to reuenge his blood,<br>
 They rose in armes, and all in battell order stood.</p><p>
 
 Which lawlesse multitude him comming too<br>
 In warlike wise, when <i>Artegall</i> did vew,<br>
 He much was troubled, ne wist what to doo.<br>
 For loth he was his noble hands t'embrew<br>
 In the base blood of such a rascall crew;<br>
 And otherwise, if that he should retire,<br>
 He fear'd least they with shame would him pursew.<br>
 Therefore he <i>Talus</i> to them sent, t'inquire<br>
 The cause of their array, and truce for to desire.</p><p>
 
 But soone as they him nigh approching spide,<br>
 They gan with all their weapons him assay,<br>
 And rudely stroke at him on euery side:<br>
 Yet nought they could him hurt, ne ought dismay.<br>
 But when at them he with his flaile gan lay,<br>
 He like a swarme of flyes them ouerthrew;<br>
 Ne any of them durst come in his way,<br>
 But here and there before his presence flew,<br>
 And hid themselues in holes and bushes from his vew.</p><p>
 
 As when a Faulcon hath with nimble flight<br>
 Flowne at a flush of Ducks, foreby the brooke,<br>
 The trembling foule dismayd with dreadfull sight<br>
 Of death, the which them almost ouertooke,<br>
 Doe hide themselues from her astonying looke,<br>
 Amongst the flags and couert round about.<br>
 When <i>Talus</i> saw they all the field forsooke<br>
 And none appear'd of all that raskall rout,<br>
 To <i>Artegall</i> he turn'd, and went with him throughout.</p><p>
