 <p><i>To the Right noble, and Valorous,
 Sir Walter</i> Raleigh knight, Lo. Wardein of the Stanneryes, and her Maiesties
 lieftenaunt of the County of Cornewayll.
 </p><p> <b>S</b>
 <i>Ir knowing how doubtfully all Allegories may be construed, and this
 booke of mine, which I have entituled the Faery Queene, being a continued
 Allegory, or darke conceit, I haue thought good aswell for auoyding of
 gealous opinions and miscõstructions, as also for your better light
 in reading thereof, (being so by you commanded) to discouer vnto you the
 general intention and meaning, which in the whole course thereof I haue
 fashioned, without expressing of any particular purposes or by accidents
 therein occasioned. The generall end therefore of all the booke is to fashion
 a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and gentle discipline: Which for
 that I conceiued shoulde be most plausible and pleasing, being coloured
 with an historicall fiction, the which the most part of men delight to
 read, rather for variety of matter, then for profite of the ensample: I
 chose the historye of king Arthure, as most fitte for the excellency of
 his person being made famous by many mens former workes, and also furthest
 from the daunger of enuy, and suspition of present time. In which I haue
 followed all the antique Poets historicall, first Homere, who in the Persons
 of Agamemnon and Vlysses hath ensampled a good gouernour and a vertuous
 man, the one in his Ilias, the other in his Odysseis: then Virgil, whose
 like intention was to doe in the person of Aeneas: after him Ariosto comprised
 them both in his Orlando: and lately Tasso disseuered them againe, and
 formed both parts in two persons, namely that part which they in Philosophy
 call Ethice, or vertues of a priuate man, coloured in his Rinaldo: The
 other named Politice in his Godfredo. By ensample of which excellente Poets,
 I labour to pourtraict in Arthure, before he was king, the image of a braue
 knight, perfected in the twelue morall vertues, as Aristotle hath deuised,
 the which is the purpose of these first twelue bookes: which if I finde
 to be well accepted, I may be perhaps encoraged, to frame the other part
 of polliticke vertues in his person, after that hee came to be king. To
 some I know this Methode will seeme displeasaunt, which had rather haue
 good discipline deliuered plainly in way of precepts, or sermoned at large,
 as they vse, then thus clowdily enrapped in Allegoricall deuises. But such,
 me seeme, should be satisfide with the vse of these dayes seeing all things
 accounted by their showes, and nothing esteemed of, that is not delightfull
 and pleasing to commune sence. For this cause Xenophon preferred before
 Plato, for that the one in the exquisite depth of his iudgement, formed
 a Commune welth such as it should be, but the other in the person of Cyrus
 and the Persians fashioned a gouernment such as it might best be: So much
 more profitable and gratious is doctrine by ensample, then by rule. So
 haue I laboured to doe in the person of Arthure: whome I conceiue after
 his long education by Timon, to whome he was by Merlin deliuered to be
 brought vp, so soone as he was borne of the Lady Igrayne, to haue seene
 in a dream or vision the Faery Queen, with whose excellent beauty rauished,
 he awaking resolued to seeke her out, and so being by Merlin armed, and
 by Timon throughly instructed, he went to seeke her forth in Faerye land.
 In that Faery Queene I meane glory in my generall intention, but in my
 particular I conceiue the most excellent and glorious person of our soueraine
 the Queene, and her kingdome in Faery land. And yet in some places els
 I do otherwise shadow her. For considering she beareth two persons, the
 one of a most royall Queene or Empresse, the other of a most vertuous and
 beautifull Lady, this latter part in some places I doe ezpresse in Belphoebe,
 fashioning her name according to your owne excellent conceipt of Cynthia
 (Phoebe and Cynthia being both names of Diana). So in the person of Prince
 Arthure I sette forth magnificence in particular, which vertue for that
 (according to Aristotle and the rest) it is the perfection of all the rest,
 and conteineth in it them all, therefore in the whole course I mention
 the deedes of Arthure applyable to that vertue, which I write of in that
 booke. But of the xii. other vertues, I make xii. other knights the patrones,
 for the more variety of the history. Of which these three bookes contayn
 three. The first of the knight of the Redcrosse, in whome I express Holynes.
 The seconde of Sir Guyon, in whome I sette forth Temperaunce: The third
 of Britomartis a Lady knight, in whome I picture Chastity. But because
 the beginning of the whole worke seemeth abrupte and as depending vpon
 other antecedents, it needs that ye know the occasion of these three knights
 seuerall aduentures. For the Methode of a Poet historical is not such,
 as of an Historiographer. For an Historiographer discourseth of affayres
 orderly as they were donne, accounting as well the times as the actions,
 but a Poet thrusteth into the middest, euen where it most concerneth him,
 and there recoursing to the thinges forepaste, and diuining of thinges
 to come, maketh a pleasing Analysis of all. The beginning therefore of
 my history, if it were to be told by an Historiographer should be the twelfth
 booke, which is the last, where I deuise that the Faery Queene kept her
 Annuall feaste xii. dayes, vppon which xii. seuerall dayes, the occasions
 of the xii. seuerall aduentures, hapned, which being vndertaken by xii.
 seuerall knights, are in these xii. books seuerally handled and discoursed.
 The first was this. In the beginning of the feast, there presented himselfe
 a tall clownish younge man, who falling before the Queen of Faries desired
 a boone (as the manner then was) which during that feast she might not
 refuse: which was that hee might haue the atchieument of any aduenture,
 which during that feaste should happen: that being graunted, he rested
 him on the floore, vnfitte through his rusticity for a better place. Soone
 after entred a faire Ladye in mourning weedes, riding on a white Asse,
 with a dwarfe behind her leading a warlike steed, that bore the Armes of
 a knight, and his speare in the dwarfes hand. Shee falling before the Queene
 of Faeries complayned that her father and mother an ancient King and Queene,
 had bene by an huge dragon many years shut vp in a brasen Castle, who thence
 suffred them not to yssew: and therefore besought the Faery Queene to assygne
 her some one of her knights to take on him that exployt. Presently that
 clownish person vpstarting, desired that aduenture: whereat the Queene
 much wondering, and the Lady much gainesaying, yet he earnestly importuned
 his desire. In the end the Lady told him that vnlesse that armour which
 she brought, would serue him (that is the armour of a Christian man specified
 by Saint Paul v. Ephes.) that he could not succeed in that enterprise,
 which being forthwith put upon him with dewe furnitures thereunto, he seemed
 the goodliest man in al that company, and was well liked of the Lady. And
 eftesoones taking on him knighthood, and mounting on that straunge Courser,
 he went forth with her on that aduenture: where beginneth the first booke,
 vz.</i>
 <br> 
 </p><center>
 <p>A gentle knight was pricking on the
 playne, &amp;c.</p></center>
 
 <p><i>The second day ther came in a
 Palmer bearing an Infant with bloody hands, whose Parents he complained
 to haue bene slayne by an Enchauntresse called Acrasia: and therfore craued
 of the Faery Queene, to appoint him some knight, to performe that aduenture,
 which being assigned to Sir Guyon, he presently went forth with that same
 Palmer: which is the beginning of the second booke and the whole subiect
 thereof. The third day there came in a Groome, who complained before the
 Faery Queene, that a vile Enchaunter called Busirane had in hand a most
 faire Lady called Amoretta, whom he kept in most grieuous torment, because
 she would not yield him the pleasure of her body. Whereupon Sir Scudamour
 the louer of that Lady presently tooke on him that aduenture. But being
 vnable to performe it by reason of the hard Enchauntments, after long sorrow,
 in the end he met with Britomartis who succoured him, and reskewed his
 loue.</i>
 </p><p><i> But by occasion hereof,
 many other aduentures are intermedled, but rather as Accidents, then intendments.
 As the loue of Britomart, the ouerthrow of Marinell, the misery of Florimell,
 the vertuousnes of Belphoebe, the lasciuiousnes of Hellenora, and many
 the like.</i>
 </p><p><i> Thus much Sir, I haue briefly
 ouerronne to direct your vnderstanding to the wel-head of the History,
 that from thence gathering the whole intention of the conceit, ye may as
 in a handfull gripe al the discourse, which otherwise may happily seeme
 tedious and confused. So humbly crauing the continuaunce of your honorable
 fauour towardes me, and th'eternall establishment of your happines, I humbly
 take leaue.</i>
 </p><blockquote>23 <i>Ianuary,</i> 1589.
 <p> Yours most humbly affectionate
 <br>Ed. Spenser.
