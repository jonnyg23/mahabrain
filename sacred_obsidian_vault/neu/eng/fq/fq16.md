 </p><blockquote> 
 <i>Vaine Braggadocchio getting Guyons<br>
 horse is made the scorne<br>
 Of knighthood trew, and is of fayre<br>
 Belphoebe fowle forlorne.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote> 
 
  
 <p>
 </p><blockquote> 
 S
 Oone as the morrow faire with purple beames<br>
 Disperst the shadowes of the mistie night,<br>
 And <i>Titan</i> playing on the eastern streames,<br>
 cleare the deawy ayre with springing light,<br>
 Sir <i>Guyon</i> mindfull of his vow yplight,<br>
 Vprose from drowsie couch, and him addrest<br>
 Vnto the iourney which he had behight:<br>
 His puissaunt armes about his noble brest,<br>
 And many-folded shield he bound about his wrest.<p>
  
 Then taking <i>Congé</i> of that virgin pure,<br>
 The bloudy-handed babe vnto her truth<br>
 Did earnestly commit, and her coniure,<br>
 In vertuous lore to traine his tender youth,<br>
 And all that gentle noriture ensu'th:<br>
 And that so soone as ryper yeares he raught,<br>
 He might for memorie of that dayes ruth,<br>
 Be called <i>Ruddymane</i>, and thereby taught,<br>
 T'auenge his Parẽts death on them, that had it wrought.</p><p>
  
 So forth he far'd, as now befell, on foot,<br>
 Sith his good steed is lately from him gone;<br>
 Patience perforce; helpelesse what may it boot<br>
 To fret for anger, or for griefe to mone?<br>
 His Palmer now shall foot no more alone:<br>
 So fortune wrought, as vnder greene woods syde<br>
 He lately heard that dying Lady grone,<br>
 He left his steed without, and speare besyde,<br>
 And rushed in on foot to ayd her, ere she dyde.</p><p>
  
 The whiles a losell wandring by the way,<br>
 One that to bountie neuer cast his mind,<br>
 Ne thought of honour euer did assay<br>
 His baser brest, but in his kestrell kind<br>
 A pleasing vaine of glory vaine did find,<br>
 To which his flowing toung, and troublous spright<br>
 Gaue him great ayd, and made him more inclind:<br>
 He that braue steed there finding ready dight,<br>
 Purloynd both steed and speare, and ran away full light.</p><p>
  
 Now gan his hart all swell in iollitie,<br>
 And of him selfe great hope and helpe conceiu'd,<br>
 That puffed vp with smoke of vanitie,<br>
 And with selfe-loued personage deceiu'd,<br>
 He gan to hope, of men to be receiu'd<br>
 For such, as he him thought, or faine would bee:<br>
 But for in court gay portaunce he perceiu'd,<br>
 And gallant shew to be in greatest gree,<br>
 Eftsoones to court he cast t'auaunce his first degree.</p><p>
  
 And by the way he chaunced to espy<br>
 One sitting idle on a sunny bancke,<br>
 To whom auaunting in great brauery,<br>
 As Peacocke, that his painted plumes doth prancke,<br>
 He smote his courser in the trembling flancke,<br>
 And to him threatned his hart-thrilling speare:<br>
 The seely man seeing him ryde so rancke,<br>
 And ayme at him, fell flat to ground for feare,<br>
 And crying Mercy lowd, his pitious hands gan reare.</p><p>
  
 Thereat the Scarcrow wexed wondrous prowd,<br>
 Through fortune of his first aduenture faire,<br>
 And with big thundring voyce reuyld him lowd;<br>
 Vile Caytiue, vassall of dread and despaire,<br>
 Vnworthie of the commune breathed aire,<br>
 Why liuest thou, dead dog, a lenger day,<br>
 And doest not vnto death thy selfe prepaire.<br>
 Dye, or thy selfe my captiue yield for ay;<br>
 Great fauour I thee graunt, for aunswere thus to stay.</p><p>
  
 Hold, ô deare Lord, hold your dead-doing hand,<br>
 Then loud he cryde, I am your humble thrall.<br>
 Ah wretch (quoth he) thy destinies withstand<br>
 My wrathfull will, and do for mercy call.<br>
 I giue thee life: therefore prostrated fall,<br>
 And kisse my stirrup; that thy homage bee.<br>
 The Miser threw him selfe, as an Offall,<br>
 Streight at his foot in base humilitee,<br>
 And cleeped him his liege, to hold of him in fee.</p><p>
  
 So happy peace they made and faire accord:<br>
 Eftsoones this liege-man gan to wexe more bold,<br>
 And when he felt the folly of his Lord,<br>
 In his owne kind he gan him selfe vnfold:<br>
 For he was wylie witted, and growne old<br>
 In cunning sleights and practick knauery.<br>
 From that day forth he cast for to vphold<br>
 His idle humour with fine flattery,<br>
 And blow the bellowes to his swelling vanity.</p><p>
  
 <i>Trompart</i> fit man for <i>Braggadocchio</i>,<br>
 To serue at court in view of vaunting eye;<br>
 Vaine-glorious man, when fluttring wind does blow<br>
 In his light wings, is lifted vp to skye:<br>
 The scorne of knighthood and trew cheualrye,<br>
 To thinke without desert of gentle deed,<br>
 And noble worth to be aduaunced hye:<br>
 Such prayse is shame; but honour vertues meed<br>
 Doth beare the fairest flowre in honorable seed.</p><p>
  
 So forth they pas, a well consorted paire,<br>
 Till that at length with <i>Archimage</i> they meet:<br>
 Who seeing one that shone in armour faire,<br>
 On goodly courser thundring with his feet,<br>
 Eftsoones supposed him a person meet,<br>
 Of his reuenge to make the instrument:<br>
 For since the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight he earst did weet,<br>
 To beene with <i>Guyon</i> knit in one consent,<br>
 The ill, which earst to him, he now to <i>Guyon</i> ment.</p><p>
  
 And comming close to <i>Trompart</i> gan inquere<br>
 Of him, what mighty warriour that mote bee,<br>
 That rode in golden sell with single spere,<br>
 But wanted sword to wreake his enmitee.<br>
 He is a great aduenturer, (said he)<br>
 That hath his sword through hard assay forgone,<br>
 And now hath vowd, till he auenged bee,<br>
 Of that despight, neuer to wearen none;<br>
 That speare is him enough to doen a thousand grone.</p><p>
  
 Th'enchaunter greatly ioyed in the vaunt,<br>
 And weened well ere long his will to win,<br>
 And both his foen with equall foyle to daunt.<br>
 Tho to him louting lowly, did begin<br>
 To plaine of wrongs, which had committed bin<br>
 By <i>Guyon</i>, and by that false <i>Redcrosse</i> knight,<br>
 Which two through treason and deceiptfull gin,<br>
 Had slaine Sir <i>Mordant</i>, and his Lady bright:<br>
 That mote him honour win, to wreake so foule despight.</p><p>
  
 Therewith all suddeinly he seemd enraged,<br>
 And threatned death with dreadfull countenaunce,<br>
 As if their liues had in his hand beene gaged;<br>
 And with stiffe force shaking his mortall launce,<br>
 To let him weet his doughtie valiaunce,<br>
 Thus said; Old man, great sure shalbe thy meed,<br>
 If where those knights for feare of dew vengeaunce<br>
 Do lurke, thou certainly to me areed,<br>
 That I may wreake on them their hainous hatefull deed.</p><p>
  
 Certes, my Lord, (said he) that shall I soone,<br>
 And giue you eke good helpe to their decay,<br>
 But mote I wisely you aduise to doon;<br>
 Giue no ods to your foes, but do puruay<br>
 Your selfe of sword before that bloudy day:<br>
 For they be two the prowest knights on ground,<br>
 And oft approu'd in many hard assay,<br>
 And eke of surest steele, that may be found,<br>
 Do arme your selfe against that day, them to confound.</p><p>
  
 Dotard (said he) let be thy deepe aduise;<br>
 Seemes that through many yeares thy wits thee faile,<br>
 And that weake eld hath left thee nothing wise,<br>
 Else neuer should thy iudgement be so fraile,<br>
 To measure manhood by the sword or maile.<br>
 Is not enough foure quarters of a man,<br>
 Withouten sword or shield, an host to quaile?<br>
 Thou little wotest, what this right hand can:<br>
 Speake they, which haue beheld the battailes, which it wan.</p><p>
  
 The man was much abashed at his boast;<br>
 Yet well he wist, that who so would contend<br>
 With either of those knights on euen coast,<br>
 Should need of all his armes, him to defend;<br>
 Yet feared least his boldnesse should offend,<br>
 When <i>Braggadocchio</i> said, Once I did sweare,<br>
 When with one sword seuen knights I brought to end,<br>
 Thence forth in battell neuer sword to beare,<br>
 But it were that, which noblest knight on earth doth weare.</p><p>
  
 Perdie Sir knight, said then th'enchaunter bliue,<br>
 That shall I shortly purchase to your hond:<br>
 For now the best and noblest knight aliue<br>
 Prince <i>Arthur</i> is, that wonnes in Faerie lond;<br>
 He hath a sword, that flames like burning brond.<br>
 The same by my deuice I vndertake<br>
 Shall by to morrow by thy side be fond.<br>
 At which bold word that boaster gan to quake,<br>
 And wondred in his mind, what mote that monster make.</p><p>
  
 He stayd not for more bidding, but away<br>
 Was suddein vanished out of his sight:<br>
 The Northerne wind his wings did broad display<br>
 At his commaund, and reared him vp light<br>
 From off the earth to take his aerie flight.<br>
 They lookt about, but no where could espie<br>
 Tract of his foot: then dead through great affright<br>
 They both nigh were, and each bad other flie:<br>
 Both fled attonce, ne euer backe returned eie.</p><p>
  
 Till that they come vnto a forrest greene,<br>
 In which they shrowd thẽselues from causelesse feare;<br>
 Yet feare them followes still, where so they beene,<br>
 Each trembling leafe, and whistling wind they heare,<br>
 As ghastly bug their haire on end does reare:<br>
 Yet both doe striue their fearfulnesse to faine.<br>
 At last they heard a horne, that shrilled cleare<br>
 Throughout the wood, that ecchoed againe,<br>
 And made the forrest ring, as it would riue in twaine.</p><p>
  
 Eft through the thicke they heard one rudely rush;<br>
 With noyse whereof he from his loftie steed<br>
 Downe fell to ground, and crept into a bush,<br>
 To hide his coward head from dying dreed.<br>
 But <i>Trompart</i> stoutly stayd to taken heed,<br>
 Of what might hap.  Eftsoone there stepped forth<br>
 A goodly Ladie clad in hunters weed,<br>
 That seemd to be a woman of great worth,<br>
 And by her stately portance, borne of heauenly birth.</p><p>
  
 Her face so faire as flesh it seemed not,<br>
 But heauenly pourtraict of bright Angels hew,<br>
 Cleare as the skie, withouten blame or blot,<br>
 Through goodly mixture of complexions dew;<br>
 And in her cheekes the vermeill red did shew<br>
 Like roses in a bed of lillies shed,<br>
 The which ambrosiall odours from them threw,<br>
 And gazers sense with double pleasure fed,<br>
 Hable to heale the sicke, and to reuiue the ded.</p><p>
  
 In her faire eyes two liuing lamps did flame,<br>
 Kindled aboue at th'heauenly makers light,<br>
 And darted fyrie beames out of the same,<br>
 So passing persant, and so wondrous bright,<br>
 That quite bereau'd the rash beholders sight:<br>
 In them the blinded god his lustfull fire<br>
 To kindle oft assayd, but had no might;<br>
 For with dredd Maiestie, and awfull ire,<br>
 She broke his wanton darts, and quenched base desire.</p><p>
  
 Her iuorie forhead, full of bountie braue,<br>
 Like a broad table did it selfe dispred,<br>
 For Loue his loftie triumphes to engraue,<br>
 And write the battels of his great godhed:<br>
 All good and honour might therein be red:<br>
 For there their dwelling was.  And when she spake,<br>
 Sweet words, like dropping honny she did shed,<br>
 And twixt the perles and rubins softly brake<br>
 A siluer sound, that heauenly musicke seemd to make.</p><p>
  
 Vpon her eyelids many Graces sate,<br>
 Vnder the shadow of her euen browes,<br>
 Working belgards, and amorous retrate,<br>
 And euery one her with a grace endowes:<br>
 And euery one with meekenesse to her bowes.<br>
 So glorious mirrhour of celestiall grace,<br>
 And soueraine moniment of mortall vowes,<br>
 How shall fraile pen descriue her heauenly face,<br>
 For feare through want of skill her beautie to disgrace?</p><p>
  
 So faire, and thousand thousand times more faire<br>
 She seemd, when she presented was to sight,<br>
 And was yclad, for heat of scorching aire,<br>
 All in a silken Camus lylly whight,<br>
 Purfled vpon with many a folded plight,<br>
 Which all aboue besprinckled was throughout,<br>
 With golden aygulets, that glistred bright,<br>
 Like twinckling starres, and all the skirt about<br>
 Was hemd with golden fringe</p><p>
  
 Below her ham her weed were somewhat traine,<br>
 And her streight legs most brauely were embayld<br>
 In gilden buskins of costly Cordwaine,<br>
 All bard with golden bendes, which were entayld<br>
 With curious antickes, and full faire aumayld:<br>
 Before they fastned were vnder her knee<br>
 In a rich Iewell, and therein entrayld<br>
 The ends of all their knots, that none might see,<br>
 How they within their fouldings close enwrapped bee.</p><p>
  
 Like two faire marble pillours they were seene,<br>
 Which doe the temple of the Gods support,<br>
 Whom all the people decke with girlands greene,<br>
 And honour in their festiuall resort;<br>
 Those same with stately grace, and princely port<br>
 She taught to tread, when she her selfe would grace,<br>
 But with the wooddie Nymphes when she did play,<br>
 Or when the flying Libbard she did chace,<br>
 She could them nimbly moue, and after fly apace.</p><p>
  
 And in her hand a sharpe bore-speare she held,<br>
 And at her backe a bow and quiuer gay,<br>
 Stuft with steele-headed darts, wherewith she queld<br>
 The saluage beastes in her victorious play,<br>
 Knit with a golden bauldricke, which forelay<br>
 Athwart her snowy brest, and did diuide<br>
 Her daintie paps; which like young fruit in May<br>
 Now little gan to swell, and being tide,<br>
 Through her thin weed their places only signifide.</p><p>
  
 Her yellow lockes crisped, like golden wyre,<br>
 About her shoulders weren loosely shed,<br>
 And when the winde emongst them did inspyre,<br>
 They waued like a penon wide dispred,<br>
 And low behinde her backe were scattered:<br>
 And whether art it were, or heedlesse hap,<br>
 As through the flouring forrest rash she fled,<br>
 In her rude haires sweet flowres themselues did lap,<br>
 And flourishing fresh leaues and blossomes did enwrap.</p><p>
  
 Such as <i>Diana</i> by the sandie shore<br>
 Of swift <i>Eurotas</i>, or on <i>Cynthus</i> greene,<br>
 Where all the Nymphes haue her vnwares forlore,<br>
 Wandreth alone with bow and arrowes keene,<br>
 To seeke her game: Or as that famous Queene<br>
 Of <i>Amazons</i>, whom <i>Pyrrhus</i> did destroy,<br>
 The day that first of <i>Priame</i> she was seene,<br>
 Did shew her selfe in great triumphant ioy,<br>
 To succour the weake state of sad afflicted <i>Troy</i>.</p><p>
  
 Such when as hartlesse <i>Trompart</i> her did vew,<br>
 He was dismayed in his coward mind,<br>
 And doubted, whether he himselfe should shew,<br>
 Or fly away, or bide alone behind:<br>
 Both feare and hope he in her face did find,<br>
 When she at last him spying thus bespake;<br>
 Hayle Groome; didst not thou see a bleeding Hind,<br>
 Whose right haunch earst my stedfast arrow strake?<br>
 If thou didst, tell me, that I may her ouertake.</p><p>
  
 Wherewith reviu'd, this answere forth he threw;<br>
 O Goddesse, (for such I thee take to bee)<br>
 For neither doth thy face terrestriall shew,<br>
 Nor voyce sound mortall; I auow to thee,<br>
 Such wounded beast, as that, I did not see,<br>
 Sith earst into this forrest wild I came.<br>
 But mote thy goodlyhed forgiue it mee,<br>
 To weet, which of the Gods I shall thee name,<br>
 That vnto thee due worship I may rightly frame.</p><p>
  
 To whom she thus; but ere her words ensewed,<br>
 Vnto the bush her eye did suddein glaunce,<br>
 In which vaine <i>Braggadocchio</i> was mewed,<br>
 And saw it stirre: she left her percing launce,<br>
 And towards gan a deadly shaft aduaunce,<br>
 In mind to marke the beast. At which sad stowre,<br>
 <i>Trompart</i> forth stept, to stay the mortall chaunce,<br>
 Out crying, ô what euer heauenly powre,<br>
 Or earthly wight thou be, withhold this deadly howre.</p><p>
  
 O stay thy hand, for yonder is no game<br>
 For thy fierce arrowes, them to exercize,<br>
 But loe my Lord, my liege, whose warlike name,<br>
 Is farre renowmd through many bold emprize;<br>
 And now in shade he shrowded yonder lies.<br>
 She staid: with that he crauld out of his nest,<br>
 Forth creeping on his caitiue hands and thies,<br>
 And standing stoutly vp, his loftie crest<br>
 Did fiercely shake, and rowze, as comming late from rest.</p><p>
  
 As fearefull fowle, that long in secret caue<br>
 For dread of soaring hauke her selfe hath hid,<br>
 Not caring how, her silly life to saue,<br>
 She her gay painted plumes disorderid,<br>
 Seeing at last her selfe from daunger rid,<br>
 Peepes foorth, and soone renewes her natiue pride;<br>
 She gins her feathers foule disfigured<br>
 Proudly to prune, and set on euery side,<br>
 So shakes off shame, ne thinks how erst she did her hide.</p><p>
  
 So when her goodly visage he beheld,<br>
 He gan himselfe to vaunt: but when he vewed<br>
 Those deadly tooles, which in her hand she held,<br>
 Soone into other fits he was transmewed,<br>
 Till she to him her gratious speach renewed;<br>
 All haile, Sir knight, and well may thee befall,<br>
 As all the like, which honour haue pursewed<br>
 Through deedes of armes and prowesse martiall;<br>
 All vertue merits praise, but such the most of all</p><p>
  
 To whom he thus:  ô fairest vnder skie,<br>
 True be thy words, and worthy of thy praise,<br>
 That warlike feats doest highest glorifie.<br>
 Therein haue I spent all my youthly daies,<br>
 And many battailes fought, and many fraies<br>
 Throughout the world, wher so they might be found,<br>
 Endeuouring my dreadded name to raise<br>
 Aboue the Moone, that fame may it resound<br>
 In her eternall trompe, with laurell girland cround.</p><p>
  
 But what art thou, ô Ladie, which doest raunge<br>
 In this wilde forrest, where no pleasure is,<br>
 And doest not it for ioyous court exchaunge,<br>
 Emongst thine equall peres, where happie blis<br>
 And all delight does raigne, much more then this?<br>
 There thou maist loue, and dearely loued bee,<br>
 And swim in pleasure, which thou here doest mis;<br>
 There maist thou best be seene, and best maist see:<br>
 The wood is fit for beasts, the court is fit for thee.</p><p>
  
 Who so in pompe of proud estate (quoth she)<br>
 Does swim, and bathes himselfe in courtly blis,<br>
 Does waste his dayes in darke obscuritee,<br>
 And in obliuion euer buried is:<br>
 Where ease abounds, yt's eath to doe amis;<br>
 But who his limbs with labours, and his mind<br>
 Behaues with cares, cannot so easie mis.<br>
 Abroad in armes, at home in studious kind<br>
 Who seekes with painfull toile, shall honour soonest find.</p><p>
  
 In woods, in waues, in warres she wonts to dwell,<br>
 And will be found with perill and with paine;<br>
 Ne can the man, that moulds in idle cell,<br>
 Vnto her happie mansion attaine:<br>
 Before her gate high God did Sweat ordaine,<br>
 And wakefull watches euer to abide:<br>
 But easie is the way, and passage plaine<br>
 To pleasures pallace; it may soone be spide,<br>
 And day and night her dores to all stand open wide.</p><p>
  
 In Princes court,---The rest she would haue said,<br>
 But that the foolish man, fild with delight<br>
 Of her sweet words, that all his sence dismaid,<br>
 And with her wondrous beautie rauisht quight,<br>
 Gan burne in filthy lust, and leaping light,<br>
 Thought in his bastard armes her to embrace.<br>
 With that she swaruing backe, her Iauelin bright<br>
 Against him bent, and fiercely did menace:<br>
 So turned her about, and fled away apace.</p><p>
  
 Which when the Peasant saw, amazd he stood,<br>
 And grieued at her flight; yet durst he not<br>
 Pursew her steps, through wild vnknowen wood;<br>
 Besides he feard her wrath, and threatned shot<br>
 Whiles in the bush he lay, not yet forgot:<br>
 Ne car'd he greatly for her presence vaine,<br>
 But turning said to <i>Trompart</i>, What foule blot<br>
 Is this to knight, that Ladie should againe<br>
 Depart to woods vntoucht, &amp; leaue so proud disdaine?</p><p>
  
 Perdie (said <i>Trompart</i>) let her passe at will,<br>
 Least by her presence daunger mote befall.<br>
 For who can tell (and sure I feare it ill)<br>
 But that she is some powre celestiall?<br>
 For whiles she spake, her great words did apall<br>
 My feeble courage, and my hart oppresse,<br>
 That yet I quake and tremble ouer all.<br>
 And I (said <i>Braggadocchio</i>) thought no lesse,<br>
 When first I heard her horne sound with such ghastlinesse.</p><p>
  
 For from my mothers wombe this grace I haue<br>
 Me giuen by eternall destinie,<br>
 That earthly thing may not my courage braue<br>
 Dismay with feare, or cause one foot to flie,<br>
 But either hellish feends, or powres on hie:<br>
 Which was the cause, when earst that horne I heard,<br>
 Weening it had beene thunder in the skie,<br>
 I hid my selfe from it, as one affeard;<br>
 But when I other knew, my selfe I boldly reard.</p><p>
  
 But now for feare of worse, that may betide,<br>
 Let vs soone hence depart.  They soone agree;<br>
 So to his steed he got, and gan to ride,<br>
 As one vnfit therefore, that all might see<br>
 He had not trayned bene in cheualree.<br>
 Which well that valiant courser did discerne;<br>
 For he despysd to tread in dew degree,<br>
 But chaufd and fom'd, with courage fierce and sterne,<br>
 And to be easd of that base burden still did erne.</p><p>
