 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Satyrane makes a Turneyment<br>
 For loue of Florimell:<br>
 Britomart winnes the prize from all,<br>
 And Artegall doth quell.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 I
 T often fals, (as here it earst befell)<br>
 That mortall foes doe turne to faithfull frends,<br>
 And friends profest are chaungd to foemen fell:<br>
 The cause of both, of both their minds depends;<br>
 And th'end of both likewise of both their ends.<br>
 For enmitie, that of no ill proceeds,<br>
 But of occasion, with th'occasion ends;<br>
 And friendship, which a faint affection breeds<br>
 Without regard of good, dyes like ill grounded seeds.<p>
 
 That well (me seemes) appeares, by that of late<br>
 Twixt <i>Cambell</i> and Sir <i>Triamond</i> befell,<br>
 As als by this, that now a new debate<br>
 Stird vp twixt <i>Scudamour</i> and <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
 The which by course befals me here to tell:<br>
 Who hauing those two other Knights espide,<br>
 Marching afore, as ye remember well,<br>
 Sent forth their Squire to haue them both descride,<br>
 And eke those masked Ladies riding them beside.</p><p>
 
 Who backe returning, told as he had seene,<br>
 That they were doughtie knights of dreaded name;<br>
 And those two Ladies, their two loues vnseene;<br>
 And therefore wisht them without blot or blame,<br>
 To let them passe at will, for dread of shame.<br>
 But <i>Blandamour</i> full of vainglorious spright,<br>
 And rather stird by his discordfull Dame,<br>
 Vpon them gladly would haue prov'd his might,<br>
 But that he yet was sore of his late lucklesse fight.</p><p>
 
 Yet nigh approching, he them fowle bespake,<br>
 Disgracing them, him selfe thereby to grace,<br>
 As was his wont; so weening way to make<br>
 To Ladies loue, where so he came in place,<br>
 And with lewd termes their louers to deface.<br>
 Whose sharpe prouokement them incenst so sore,<br>
 That both were bent t'auenge his vsage base,<br>
 And gan their shields addresse them selues afore:<br>
 For euill deedes may better then bad words be bore.</p><p>
 
 But faire <i>Cambina</i> with perswasions myld,<br>
 Did mitigate the fiercenesse of their mode,<br>
 That for the present they were reconcyld,<br>
 And gan to treate of deeds of armes abrode,<br>
 And strange aduentures, all the way they rode:<br>
 Amongst the which they told, as then befell,<br>
 Of that great turney, which was blazed brode,<br>
 For that rich girdle of faire <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
 The prize of her, which did in beautie most excell.</p><p>
 
 To which folke-mote they all with one consent,<br>
 Sith each of them his Ladie had him by,<br>
 Whose beautie each of them thought excellent,<br>
 Agreed to trauell, and their fortunes try.<br>
 So as they passed forth, they did espy<br>
 One in bright armes, with ready speare in rest,<br>
 That toward them his course seem'd to apply,<br>
 Gainst whom Sir <i>Paridell</i> himselfe addrest,<br>
 Him weening, ere he nigh approcht to haue represt.</p><p>
 
 Which th'other seeing, gan his course relent,<br>
 And vaunted speare eftsoones to disaduaunce,<br>
 As if he naught but peace and pleasure ment,<br>
 Now falne into their fellowship by chance,<br>
 Whereat they shewed curteous countenaunce.<br>
 So as he rode with them accompanide,<br>
 His rouing eie did on the Lady glaunce,<br>
 Which <i>Blandamour</i> had riding by his side:<br>
 Who˜ sure he weend, that he some wher tofore had eide.</p><p>
 
 It was to weete that snowy <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
 Which <i>Ferrau</i> late from <i>Braggadochio</i> wonne,<br>
 Whom he now seeing, her remembred well,<br>
 How hauing reft her from the witches sonne,<br>
 He soone her lost: wherefore he now begunne<br>
 To challenge her anew, as his owne prize,<br>
 Whom formerly he had in battell wonne,<br>
 And proffer made by force her to reprize:<br>
 Which scornefull offer, <i>Blandamour</i> gan soone despize.</p><p>
 
 And said, Sir Knight, sith ye this Lady clame,<br>
 Whom he that hath, were loth to lose so light,<br>
 (For so to lose a Lady, were great shame)<br>
 Yee shall her winne, as I haue done in fight:<br>
 And lo shee shall be placed here in sight,<br>
 Together with this Hag beside her set,<br>
 That who so winnes her, may her haue by right:<br>
 But he shall haue the Hag that is ybet,<br>
 And with her alwaies ride, till he another get.</p><p>
 
 That offer pleased all the company,<br>
 So <i>Florimell</i> with <i>Ate</i> forth was brought,<br>
 At which they all gan laugh full merrily:<br>
 But <i>Braggadochio</i> said, he neuer thought<br>
 For such an Hag, that seemed worse then nought,<br>
 His person to emperill so in fight.<br>
 But if to match that Lady they had sought<br>
 Another like, that were like faire and bright,<br>
 His life he then would spend to iustifie his right.</p><p>
 
 At which his vaine excuse they all gan smile,<br>
 As scorning his vnmanly cowardize:<br>
 And <i>Florimell</i> him fowly gan reuile,<br>
 That for her sake refus'd to enterprize<br>
 The battell, offred in so knightly wize.<br>
 And <i>Ate</i> eke prouokt him priuily,<br>
 With loue of her, and shame of such mesprize.<br>
 But naught he car'd for friend or enemy,<br>
 For in base mind nor friendship dwels nor enmity.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Cambell</i> thus did shut vp all in iest,<br>
 Braue Knights and Ladies, certes ye doe wrong<br>
 To stirre vp strife, when most vs needeth rest,<br>
 That we may vs reserue both fresh and strong,<br>
 Against the Turneiment which is not long.<br>
 When who so list to fight, may fight his fill,<br>
 Till then your challenges ye may prolong;<br>
 And then it shall be tried, if ye will,<br>
 Whether shall haue the Hag, or hold the Lady still.</p><p>
 
 They all agreed: so turning all to game,<br>
 And pleasaunt bord, they past forth on their way,<br>
 And all that while, where so they rode or came,<br>
 That masked Mock-knight was their sport and play.<br>
 Till that at length vpon th'appointed day,<br>
 Vnto the place of turneyment they came;<br>
 Where they before them found in fresh aray<br>
 Manie a braue knight, and manie a daintie dame<br>
 Assembled, for to get the honour of that game.</p><p>
 
 There this faire crewe arriuing, did diuide<br>
 Them selues asunder: <i>Blandamour</i> with those<br>
 Of his, on th'one; the rest on th'other side.<br>
 But boastfull <i>Braggadocchio</i> rather chose,<br>
 For glorie vaine their fellowship to lose,<br>
 That men on him the more might gaze alone.<br>
 The rest them selues in troupes did else dispose,<br>
 Like as it seemed best to euery one;<br>
 The knights in couples marcht, with ladies linckt attone.</p><p>
 
 Then first of all forth came Sir <i>Satyrane</i>,<br>
 Bearing that precious relicke in an arke<br>
 Of gold, that bad eyes might it not prophane:<br>
 Which drawing softly forth out of the darke,<br>
 He open shewd, that all men it mote marke.<br>
 A gorgeous girdle, curiously embost<br>
 With pearle &amp; precious stone, worth many a marke;<br>
 Yet did the workmanship farre passe the cost:<br>
 It was the same, which lately <i>Florimel</i> had lost.</p><p>
 
 That same aloft he hong in open vew,<br>
 To be the prize of beautie and of might;<br>
 The which eftsoones discouered, to it drew<br>
 The eyes of all, allur'd with close delight,<br>
 And hearts quite robbed with so glorious sight,<br>
 That all men threw out vowes and wishes vaine.<br>
 Thrise happie Ladie, and thrise happie knight,<br>
 Them seemd, that could so goodly riches gaine,<br>
 So worthie of the perill, worthy of the paine.</p><p>
 
 Then tooke the bold Sir <i>Satyrane</i> in hand<br>
 An huge great speare, such as he wont to wield,<br>
 And vauncing forth from all the other band<br>
 Of knights, addrest his maiden-headed shield,<br>
 Shewing him selfe all ready for the field.<br>
 Gainst whom there singled from the other side<br>
 A Painim knight, that well in armes was skild,<br>
 And had in many a battell oft bene tride,<br>
 Hight <i>Bruncheual</i> the bold, who fiersly forth did ride.</p><p>
 
 So furiously they both together met,<br>
 That neither could the others force sustaine;<br>
 As two fierce Buls, that striue the rule to get<br>
 Of all the heard, meete with so hideous maine,<br>
 That both rebutted, tumble on the plaine:<br>
 So these two champions to the ground were feld,<br>
 Where in a maze they both did long remaine,<br>
 And in their hands their idle troncheons held,<br>
 Which neither able were to wag, or once to weld.</p><p>
 
 Which when the noble <i>Ferramont</i> espide,<br>
 He pricked forth in ayd of <i>Satyran</i>;<br>
 And him against Sir <i>Blandamour</i> did ride<br>
 With all the strength and stifnesse that he can.<br>
 But the more strong and stiffely that he ran,<br>
 So much more sorely to the ground he fell,<br>
 That on an heape were tumbled horse and man.<br>
 Vnto whose rescue forth rode <i>Paridell</i>;<br>
 But him likewise with that same speare he eke did quell.</p><p>
 
 Which <i>Braggadocchio</i> seeing, had no will<br>
 To hasten greatly to his parties ayd,<br>
 Albee his turne were next; but stood there still,<br>
 As one that seemed doubtfull or dismayd.<br>
 But <i>Triamond</i> halfe wroth to see him staid,<br>
 Sternly stept forth, and raught away his speare,<br>
 With which so sore he <i>Ferramont</i> assaid,<br>
 That horse and man to ground he quite did beare,<br>
 That neither could in hast themselues againe vpreare.</p><p>
 
 Which to auenge, Sir <i>Deuon</i> him did dight,<br>
 But with no better fortune then the rest:<br>
 For him likewise he quickly downe did smight,<br>
 And after him Sir <i>Douglas</i> him addrest,<br>
 And after him Sir <i>Paliumord</i> forth prest,<br>
 But none of them against his strokes could stand,<br>
 But all the more, the more his praise increst.<br>
 For either they were left vppon the land,<br>
 Or went away sore wounded of his haplesse hand.</p><p>
 
 And now by this, Sir <i>Satyrane</i> abraid,<br>
 Out of the swowne, in which too long he lay;<br>
 And looking round about, like one dismaid,<br>
 When as he saw the mercilesse affray<br>
 Which doughty <i>Triamond</i> had wrought that day,<br>
 Vnto the noble Knights of Maidenhead,<br>
 His mighty heart did almost rend in tway,<br>
 For very gall, that rather wholly dead<br>
 Himselfe he wisht haue beene, then in so bad a stead.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones he gan to gather vp around<br>
 His weapons, which lay scattered all abrode,<br>
 And as it fell, his steed he ready found.<br>
 On whom remounting, fiercely forth he rode,<br>
 Like sparke of fire that from the anduile glode.<br>
 There where he saw the valiant <i>Triamond</i><br>
 Chasing, and laying on them heauy lode,<br>
 That none his force were able to withstond,<br>
 So dreadfull were his strokes, so deadly was his hond.</p><p>
 
 With that, at him his beam-like speare he aimed,<br>
 And thereto all his power and might applide:<br>
 The wicked steele for mischiefe first ordained,<br>
 And hauing now misfortune got for guide,<br>
 Staid not, till it arriued in his side.<br>
 And therein made a very griesly wound,<br>
 That streames of bloud his armour all bedide.<br>
 Much was he daunted with that direfull stound,<br>
 That scarse he him vpheld from falling in a sound.</p><p>
 
 Yet as he might, himselfe he soft withdrew<br>
 Out of the field, that none perceiu'd it plaine.<br>
 Then gan the part of Chalengers anew<br>
 To range the field, and victorlike to raine,<br>
 That none against them battell durst maintaine.<br>
 By that the gloomy euening on them fell,<br>
 That forced them from fighting to refraine,<br>
 And trumpets sound to cease did them compell.<br>
 So <i>Satyrane</i> that day was iudg'd to beare the bell.</p><p>
 
 The morrow next the Turney gan anew,<br>
 And with the first the hardy <i>Satyrane</i><br>
 Appear'd in place, with all his noble crew:<br>
 On th'other side, full many a warlike swaine,<br>
 Assembled were, that glorious prize to gaine.<br>
 But mongst them all, was not Sir <i>Triamond</i>,<br>
 Vnable he new battell to darraine,<br>
 Through grieuaunce of his late receiued wound,<br>
 That doubly did him grieue, when so himselfe he found.</p><p>
 
 Which <i>Cambell</i> seeing, though he could not salue,<br>
 Ne done vndoe, yet for to salue his name,<br>
 And purchase honour in his friends behalue,<br>
 This goodly counterfesaunce he did frame.<br>
 The shield and armes well knowne to be the same,<br>
 Which <i>Triamond</i> had worne, vnwares to wight,<br>
 And to his friend vnwist, for doubt of blame,<br>
 If he misdid, he on himselfe did dight,<br>
 That none could him discerne, and so went forth to fight.</p><p>
 
 There <i>Satyrane</i> Lord of the field he found,<br>
 Triumphing in great ioy and iolity;<br>
 Gainst whom none able was to stand on ground;<br>
 That much he gan his glorie to enuy,<br>
 And cast t'auenge his friends indignity.<br>
 A mightie speare eftsoones at him he bent;<br>
 Who seeing him come on so furiously,<br>
 Met him mid-way with equall hardiment,<br>
 That forcibly to ground they both together went.</p><p>
 
 They vp againe them selues can lightly reare,<br>
 And to their tryed swords them selues betake;<br>
 With which they wrought such wondrous maruels there,<br>
 That all the rest it did amazed make,<br>
 Ne any dar'd their perill to partake;<br>
 Now cuffling close, now chacing to and fro,<br>
 Now hurtling round aduantage for to take:<br>
 As two wild Boares together grapling go,<br>
 Chaufing and foming choler each against his fo.</p><p>
 
 So as they courst, and turneyd here and theare,<br>
 It chaunst Sir <i>Satyrane</i> his steed at last,<br>
 Whether through foundring or through sodein feare<br>
 To stumble, that his rider nigh he cast;<br>
 Which vauntage <i>Cambell</i> did pursue so fast,<br>
 That ere him selfe he had recouered well,<br>
 So sore he sowst him on the compast creast,<br>
 That forced him to leaue his loftie sell,<br>
 And rudely tumbling downe vnder his horse feete fell.</p><p>
 
 Lightly <i>Cambello</i> leapt downe from his steed,<br>
 For to haue rent his shield and armes away,<br>
 That whylome wont to be the victors meed;<br>
 When all vnwares he felt an hideous sway<br>
 Of many swords, that lode on him did lay.<br>
 An hundred knights had him enclosed round,<br>
 To rescue <i>Satyrane</i> out of his pray;<br>
 All which at once huge strokes on him did pound,<br>
 In hope to take him prisoner, where he stood on ground.</p><p>
 
 He with their multitude was nought dismayd,<br>
 But with stout courage turnd vpon them all,<br>
 And with his brondiron round about him layd;<br>
 Of which he dealt large almes, as did befall:<br>
 Like as a Lion that by chaunce doth fall<br>
 Into the hunters toile, doth rage and rore,<br>
 In royall heart disdaining to be thrall.<br>
 But all in vaine: for what might one do more?<br>
 They haue him taken captiue, though it grieue him sore.</p><p>
 
 Whereof when newes to <i>Triamond</i> was brought,<br>
 There as he lay, his wound he soone forgot,<br>
 And starting vp, streight for his armour sought:<br>
 In vaine he sought; for there he found it not;<br>
 <i>Cambello</i> it away before had got:<br>
 <i>Cambelloes</i> armes therefore he on him threw,<br>
 And lightly issewd forth to take his lot.<br>
 There he in troupe found all that warlike crew,<br>
 Leading his friend away, full sorie to his vew.</p><p>
 
 Into the thickest of that knightly preasse<br>
 He thrust, and smote downe all that was betweene,<br>
 Caried with feruent zeale, ne did he ceasse,<br>
 Till that he came, where he had <i>Cambell</i> seene,<br>
 Like captive thral two other Knights atweene,<br>
 There he amongst them cruell hauocke makes;<br>
 That they which lead him, soone enforced beene<br>
 To let him loose, to saue their proper stakes;<br>
 Who being freed, from one a weapon fiercely takes.</p><p>
 
 With that he driues at them with dreadfull might,<br>
 Both in remembrance of his friends late harme,<br>
 And in reuengement of his owne despight,<br>
 So both together giue a new allarme,<br>
 As if but now the battell wexed warme.<br>
 As when two greedy Wolues doe breake by force<br>
 Into an heard, farre from the husband farme,<br>
 They spoile and rauine without all remorse,<br>
 So did these two through all the field their foes enforce.</p><p>
 
 Fiercely they followd on their bolde emprize,<br>
 Till trumpets sound did warne them all to rest;<br>
 Then all with one consent did yeeld the prize<br>
 To <i>Triamond</i> and <i>Cambell</i> as the best.<br>
 But <i>Triamond</i> to <i>Cambell</i> it relest,<br>
 And <i>Cambell</i> it to <i>Triamond</i> transferd;<br>
 Each labouring t'aduance the others gest,<br>
 And make his praise before his owne preferd:<br>
 So that the doome was to another day differd.</p><p>
 
 The last day came, when all those knightes againe<br>
 Assembled were their deedes of armes to shew.<br>
 Full many deedes that day were shewed plaine:<br>
 But <i>Satyrane</i> boue all the other crew,<br>
 His wondrous worth declared in all mens view.<br>
 For from the first he to the last endured,<br>
 And though some while Fortune from him withdrew,<br>
 Yet euermore his honour he recured,<br>
 And with vnwearied powre his party still assured.</p><p>
 
 Ne was there Knight that euer thought of armes,<br>
 But that his vtmost prowesse there made knowen,<br>
 That by their many wounds, and carelesse harmes,<br>
 By shiuered speares, and swords all vnder strowen,<br>
 By scattered shields was easie to be showen.<br>
 There might ye see loose steeds at randon ronne,<br>
 Whose luckelesse riders late were ouerthrowen;<br>
 And squiers make hast to helpe their Lords fordonne.<br>
 But still the Knights of Maidenhead the better wonne.</p><p>
 
 Till that there entred on the other side,<br>
 A straunger knight, from whence no man could reed,<br>
 In quyent disguise, full hard to be descride.<br>
 For all his armour was like saluage weed,<br>
 With woody mosse bedight, and all his steed<br>
 With oaken leaues attrapt, that seemed fit<br>
 For saluage wight, and thereto well agreed<br>
 His word, which on his ragged shield was writ,<br>
 <i>Saluagesse sans finesse</i>, shewing secret wit.</p><p>
 
 He at his first incomming, charg'd his spere<br>
 At him, that first appeared in his sight:<br>
 That was to weet, the stout Sir <i>Sangliere</i>,<br>
 Who well was knowen to be a valiant Knight,<br>
 Approued oft in many a perlous fight.<br>
 Him at the first encounter downe he smote,<br>
 And ouerbore beyond his crouper quight,<br>
 And after him another Knight, that hote<br>
 Sir <i>Brianor</i>, so sore, that none him life behote.</p><p>
 
 Then ere his hand he reard, he ouerthrew<br>
 Seuen Knights one after other as they came:<br>
 And when his speare was brust, his sword he drew,<br>
 The instrument of wrath, and with the same<br>
 Far'd like a lyon in his bloodie game,<br>
 Hewing, and slashing shields, and helmets bright,<br>
 And beating downe, what euer nigh him came,<br>
 That euery one gan shun his dreadfull sight,<br>
 No lesse then death it selfe, in daungerous affright.</p><p>
 
 Much wondred all men, what, or whence he came,<br>
 That did amongst the troupes so tyrannize;<br>
 And each of other gan inquire his name.<br>
 But when they could not learne it by no wize,<br>
 Most answerable to his wyld disguize<br>
 It seemed, him to terme the saluage knight.<br>
 But certes his right name was otherwize,<br>
 Though knowne to few, that <i>Arthegall</i> he hight,<br>
 The doughtiest knight that liv'd that day, and most of might.</p><p>
 
 Thus was Sir <i>Satyrane</i> with all his band<br>
 By his sole manhood and atchieuement stout<br>
 Dismayd, that none of them in field durst stand,<br>
 But beaten were, and chased all about.<br>
 So he continued all that day throughout,<br>
 Till euening, that the Sunne gan downward bend.<br>
 Then rushed forth out of the thickest rout<br>
 A stranger knight, that did his glorie shend:<br>
 So nought may be esteemed happie till the end.</p><p>
 
 He at his entrance charg'd his powrefull speare<br>
 At <i>Artegall</i>, in middest of his pryde,<br>
 And therewith smote him on his Vmbriere<br>
 So sore, that tombling backe, he downe did slyde<br>
 Ouer his horses taile aboue a stryde:<br>
 Whence litle lust he had to rise againe.<br>
 Which <i>Cambell</i> seeing, much the same enuyde,<br>
 And ran at him with all his might and maine;<br>
 But shortly was likewise seene lying on the plaine.</p><p>
 
 Whereat  full inly wroth was <i>Triamond</i>,<br>
 And cast t'auenge the shame doen to his freend:<br>
 But by his friend himselfe eke soone he fond,<br>
 In no lesse neede of helpe, then him he weend.<br>
 All which when <i>Blandamour</i> from end to end<br>
 Beheld, he woxe therewith displeased sore,<br>
 And thought in mind it shortly to amend:<br>
 His speare he feutred, and at him it bore;<br>
 But with no better fortune, then the rest afore.</p><p>
 
 Full many others at him likewise ran:<br>
 But all of them likewise dismounted were,<br>
 Ne certes wonder; for no powre of man<br>
 Could bide the force of that enchaunted speare,<br>
 The which this famous <i>Britomart</i> did beare;<br>
 With which she wondrous deeds of arms atchieued,<br>
 And ouerthrew, what euer came her neare,<br>
 That all those stranger knights full sore agrieued,<br>
 And that late weaker band of chalengers relieued.</p><p>
 
 Like as in sommers day when raging heat<br>
 Doth burne the earth, and boyled riuers drie,<br>
 That all brute beasts forst to refraine fro meat,<br>
 Doe hunt for shade, where shrowded they may lie,<br>
 And missing it, faine from themselues to flie;<br>
 All trauellers tormented are with paine:<br>
 A watry cloud doth ouercast the skie,<br>
 And poureth forth a sudden shoure of raine,<br>
 That all the wretched world recomforteth againe.</p><p>
 
 So did the warlike <i>Britomart</i> restore<br>
 The prize, to knights of Maydenhead that day,<br>
 Which else was like to haue bene lost, and bore<br>
 The prayse of prowesse from them all away.<br>
 Then shrilling trompets loudly gan to bray,<br>
 And bad them leaue their labours and long toyle,<br>
 To ioyous feast and other gentle play;<br>
 Where beauties prize shold win that pretious spoyle:<br>
 Where I with sound of trompe will also rest a whyle.</p><p>
