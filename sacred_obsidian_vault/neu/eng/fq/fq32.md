 </p><blockquote>
 <i>The birth of faire Belphoebe and<br>
 Of Amoret is told.<br>
 The Gardins of Adonis fraught<br>
 With pleasures manifold.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 VV
 Ell may I weene, faire Ladies, all this while<br>
 Ye wonder, how this noble Damozell<br>
 So great perfections did in her compile,<br>
 Sith that in saluage forests she did dwell,<br>
 So farre from court and royall Citadell,<br>
 The great schoolmistresse of all curtesy:<br>
 Seemeth that such wild woods should far expell<br>
 All ciuill vsage and gentility,<br>
 And gentle sprite deforme with rude rusticity.<p>
 
 But to this faire <i>Belphoebe</i> in her berth<br>
 The heauens so fauourable were and free,<br>
 Looking with myld aspect vpon the earth,<br>
 In th'<i>Horoscope</i> of her natiuitee,<br>
 That all the gifts of grace and chastitee<br>
 On her they poured forth of plenteous horne;<br>
 <i>Ioue</i> laught on <i>Venus</i> from his soueraigne see,<br>
 And <i>Phoebus</i> with faire beames did her adorne,<br>
 And all the <i>Graces</i> rockt her cradle being borne.</p><p>
 
 Her berth was of the wombe of Morning dew,<br>
 And her conception of the ioyous Prime,<br>
 And all her whole creation did her shew<br>
 Pure and vnspotted from all loathly crime,<br>
 That is ingenerate in fleshly slime.<br>
 So was this virgin borne, so was she bred,<br>
 So was she trayned vp from time to time,<br>
 In all chast vertue, and true bounti-hed<br>
 Till to her dew perfection she was ripened.</p><p>
 
 Her mother was the faire <i>Chrysogonee</i>,<br>
 The daughter of <i>Amphisa</i>, who by race<br>
 A Faerie was, yborne of high degree,<br>
 She bore <i>Belphoebe</i>, she bore in like cace<br>
 Faire <i>Amoretta</i> in the second place:<br>
 These two were twinnes, &amp; twixt them two did share<br>
 The heritage of all celestiall grace.<br>
 That all the rest it seem'd they robbed bare<br>
 Of bountie, and of beautie, and all vertues rare.</p><p>
 
 It were a goodly storie, to declare,<br>
 By what straunge accident faire <i>Chrysogone</i><br>
 Conceiu'd these infants, and how them she bare,<br>
 In this wild forrest wandring all alone,<br>
 After she had nine moneths fulfild and gone:<br>
 For not as other wemens commune brood,<br>
 They were enwombed in the sacred throne<br>
 Of her chaste bodie, nor with commune food,<br>
 As other wemens babes, they sucked vitall blood.</p><p>
 
 But wondrously they were begot, and bred<br>
 Through influence of th'heauens fruitfull ray,<br>
 As it in antique bookes is mentioned.<br>
 It was vpon a Sommers shynie day,<br>
 When <i>Titan</i> faire his beames did display,<br>
 In a fresh fountaine, farre from all mens vew,<br>
 She bath'd her brest, the boyling heat t'allay;<br>
 She bath'd with roses red, and violets blew,<br>
 And all the sweetest flowres, that in the forrest grew.</p><p>
 
 Till faint through irkesome wearinesse, adowne<br>
 Vpon the grassie ground her selfe she layd<br>
 To sleepe, the whiles a gentle slombring swowne<br>
 Vpon her fell all naked bare displayd;<br>
 The sunne-beames bright vpon her body playd,<br>
 Being through former bathing mollifide,<br>
 And pierst into her wombe, where they embayd<br>
 With so sweet sence and secret power vnspide,<br>
 That in her pregnant flesh they shortly fructifide.</p><p>
 
 Miraculous may seeme to him, that reades<br>
 So straunge ensample of conception;<br>
 But reason teacheth that the fruitfull seades<br>
 Of all things liuing, through impression<br>
 Of the sunbeames in moyst complexion,<br>
 Doe life conceiue and quickned are by kynd:<br>
 So after <i>Nilus</i> invndation,<br>
 Infinite shapes of creatures men do fynd,<br>
 Informed in the mud, on which the Sunne hath shynd.</p><p>
 
 Great father he of generation<br>
 Is rightly cald, th'author of life and light;<br>
 And his faire sister for creation<br>
 Ministreth matter fit, which tempred right<br>
 With heate and humour, breedes the liuing wight.<br>
 So sprong these twinnes in wombe of <i>Chrysogone</i>,<br>
 Yet wist she nought thereof, but sore affright,<br>
 Wondred to see her belly so vpblone,<br>
 Which still increast, till she her terme had full outgone.</p><p>
 
 Whereof conceiuing shame and foule disgrace,<br>
 Albe her guiltlesse conscience her cleard,<br>
 She fled into the wildernesse a space,<br>
 Till that vnweeldy burden she had reard,<br>
 And shund dishonor, which as death she feard:<br>
 Where wearie of long trauell, downe to rest<br>
 Her selfe she set, and comfortably cheard;<br>
 There a sad cloud of sleepe her ouerkest,<br>
 And seized euery sense with sorrow sore opprest.</p><p>
 
 It fortuned, faire <i>Venus</i> hauing lost<br>
 Her little sonne, the winged god of loue,<br>
 Who for some light displeasure, which him crost,<br>
 Was from her fled, as flit as ayerie Doue,<br>
 And left her blisfull bowre of ioy aboue,<br>
 (So from her often he had fled away,<br>
 When she for ought him sharpely did reproue,<br>
 And wandred in the world in strange aray,<br>
 Disguiz'd in thousand shapes, that none might him bewray.)</p><p>
 
 Him for to seeke, she left her heauenly hous,<br>
 The house of goodly formes and faire aspects,<br>
 Whence all the world deriues the glorious<br>
 Features of beautie, and all shapes select,<br>
 With which high God his workmanship hath deckt;<br>
 And searched euery way, through which his wings<br>
 Had borne him, or his tract she mote detect:<br>
 She promist kisses sweet, and sweeter things<br>
 Vnto the man, that of him tydings to her brings.</p><p>
 
 First she him sought in Court, where most he vsed<br>
 Whylome to haunt, but there she found him not;<br>
 But many there she found, which sore accused<br>
 His falsehood, and with foule infamous blot<br>
 His cruell deedes and wicked wyles did spot:<br>
 Ladies and Lords she euery where mote heare<br>
 Complayning, how with his empoysned shot<br>
 Their wofull harts he wounded had whyleare,<br>
 And so had left them languishing twixt hope and feare.</p><p>
 
 She then the Citties sought from gate to gate,<br>
 And euery one did aske, did he him see;<br>
 And euery one her answerd, that too late<br>
 He had him seene, and felt the crueltie<br>
 Of his sharpe darts and whot artillerie;<br>
 And euery one threw forth reproches rife<br>
 Of his mischieuous deedes, and said, that hee<br>
 Was the disturber of all ciuill life,<br>
 The enimy of peace, and author of all strife.</p><p>
 
 Then in the countrey she abroad him sought,<br>
 And in the rurall cottages inquired,<br>
 Where also many plaints to her were brought,<br>
 How he their heedlesse harts with loue had fyred,<br>
 And his false venim through their veines inspyred;<br>
 And eke the gentle shepheard swaynes, which sat<br>
 Keeping their fleecie flockes, as they were hyred,<br>
 She sweetly heard complaine, both how and what<br>
 Her sonne had to them doen; yet she did smile thereat.</p><p>
 
 But when in none of all these she him got,<br>
 She gan auize, where else he mote him hyde:<br>
 At last she her bethought, that she had not<br>
 Yet sought the saluage woods and forrests wyde,<br>
 In which full many louely Nymphes abyde,<br>
 Mongst whom might be, that he did closely lye,<br>
 Or that the loue of some of them him tyde:<br>
 For thy, she thither cast her course t'apply,<br>
 To search the secret haunts of <i>Dianes</i> company.</p><p>
 
 Shortly vnto the wastefull woods she came,<br>
 Whereas she found the Goddesse with her crew,<br>
 After late chace of their embrewed game,<br>
 Sitting beside a fountaine in a rew,<br>
 Some of them washing with the liquid dew<br>
 From off their dainty limbes the dustie sweat,<br>
 And soyle which did deforme their liuely hew;<br>
 Others lay shaded from the scorching heat;<br>
 The rest vpon her person gaue attendance great.</p><p>
 
 She hauing hong vpon a bough on high<br>
 Her bow and painted quiuer, had vnlaste<br>
 Her siluer buskins from her nimble thigh,<br>
 And her lancke loynes vngirt, and brests vnbraste,<br>
 After her heat the breathing cold to taste;<br>
 Her golden lockes, that late in tresses bright<br>
 Embreaded were for hindring of her haste,<br>
 Now loose about her shoulders hong vndight,<br>
 And were with sweet <i>Ambrosia</i> all besprinckled light.</p><p>
 
 Soone as she <i>Venus</i> saw behind her backe,<br>
 She was asham'd to be so loose surprized,<br>
 And woxe halfe wroth against her damzels slacke,<br>
 That had not her thereof before auized,<br>
 But suffred her so carelesly disguized<br>
 Be ouertaken.  Soone her garments loose<br>
 Vpgath'ring, in her bosome she comprized,<br>
 Well as she might, and to the Goddesse rose,<br>
 Whiles all her Nymphes did like a girlond her enclose.</p><p>
 
 Goodly she gan faire <i>Cytherea</i> greet,<br>
 And shortly asked her, what cause her brought<br>
 Into that wildernesse for her vnmeet,<br>
 From her sweet bowres, and beds with pleasures fraught:<br>
 That suddein change she strange aduenture thought.<br>
 To whom halfe weeping, she thus answered,<br>
 That she her dearest sonne <i>Cupido</i> sought,<br>
 Who in his frowardnesse from her was fled;<br>
 That she repented sore, to haue him angered.</p><p>
 
 Thereat <i>Diana</i> gan to smile, in scorne<br>
 Of her vaine plaint, and to her scoffing sayd;<br>
 Great pittie sure, that ye be so forlorne<br>
 Of your gay sonne, that giues ye so good ayd<br>
 To your disports: ill mote ye bene apayd.<br>
 But she was more engrieued, and replide;<br>
 Faire sister, ill beseemes it to vpbrayd<br>
 A dolefull heart with so disdainfull pride;<br>
 The like that mine, may be your paine another tide.</p><p>
 
 As you in woods and wanton wildernesse<br>
 Your glory set, to chace the saluage beasts,<br>
 So my delight is all in ioyfulnesse,<br>
 In beds, in bowres, in banckets, and in feasts:<br>
 And ill becomes you with your loftie creasts,<br>
 To scorne the ioy, that <i>Ioue</i> is glad to seeke;<br>
 We both are bound to follow heauens beheasts,<br>
 And tend our charges with obeisance meeke:<br>
 Spare, gentle sister, with reproch my paine to eeke.</p><p>
 
 And tell me, if that ye my sonne haue heard,<br>
 To lurke emongst your Nymphes in secret wize;<br>
 Or keepe their cabins: much I am affeard,<br>
 Least he like one of them him selfe disguize,<br>
 And turne his arrowes to their exercize:<br>
 So may he long himselfe full easie hide:<br>
 For he is faire and fresh in face and guize,<br>
 As any Nymph (let not it be enuyde,)<br>
 So saying euery Nymph full narrowly she eyde.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Phoebe</i> therewith sore was angered,<br>
 And sharply said; Goe Dame, goe seeke your boy,<br>
 Where you him lately left, in <i>Mars</i> his bed;<br>
 He comes not here, we scorne his foolish ioy,<br>
 Ne lend we leisure to his idle toy:<br>
 But if I catch him in this company,<br>
 By <i>Stygian</i> lake I vow, whose sad annoy<br>
 The Gods doe dread, he dearely shall abye:<br>
 Ile clip his wanton wings, that he no more shall fly.</p><p>
 
 Whom when as <i>Venus</i> saw so sore displeased,<br>
 She inly sory was, and gan relent,<br>
 What she had said: so her she soone appeased,<br>
 With sugred words and gentle blandishment,<br>
 Which as a fountaine from her sweet lips went,<br>
 And welled goodly forth, that in short space<br>
 She was well pleasd, and forth her damzels sent,<br>
 Through all the woods, to search from place to place,<br>
 If any tract of him or tydings they mote trace.</p><p>
 
 To search the God of loue, her Nymphes she sent<br>
 Throughout the wandring forrest euery where:<br>
 And after them her selfe eke with her went<br>
 To seeke the fugitiue, both farre and nere,<br>
 So long they sought, till they arriued were<br>
 In that same shadie couert, whereas lay<br>
 Faire <i>Crysogone</i> in slombry traunce whilere:<br>
 Who in her sleepe (a wondrous thing to say)<br>
 Vnwares had borne two babes, as faire as springing day.</p><p>
 
 Vnwares she them conceiu'd, vnwares she bore:<br>
 She bore withouten paine, that she conceiued<br>
 Withouten pleasure: ne her need implore<br>
 <i>Lucinaes</i> aide: which when they both perceiued,<br>
 They were through wonder nigh of sense bereaued,<br>
 And gazing each on other, nought bespake:<br>
 At last they both agreed, her seeming grieued<br>
 Out of her heauy swowne not to awake,<br>
 But from her louing side the tender babes to take.</p><p>
 
 Vp they them tooke, each one a babe vptooke,<br>
 And with them carried, to be fostered;<br>
 Dame <i>Phoebe</i> to a Nymph her babe betooke,<br>
 To be vpbrought in perfect Maydenhed,<br>
 And of her selfe her name <i>Belphoebe</i> red:<br>
 But <i>Venus</i> hers thence farre away conuayd,<br>
 To be vpbrought in goodly womanhed,<br>
 And in her litle loues stead, which was strayd,<br>
 Her <i>Amoretta</i> cald, to comfort her dismayd.</p><p>
 
 She brought her to her ioyous Paradize,<br>
 Where most she wonnes, whẽ she on earth does dwel.<br>
 So faire a place, as Nature can deuize:<br>
 Whether in <i>Paphos</i>, or <i>Cytheron</i> hill,<br>
 Or it in <i>Gnidus</i> be, I wote not well;<br>
 But well I wote by tryall, that this same<br>
 All other pleasant places doth excell,<br>
 And called is by her lost louers name,<br>
 The <i>Gardin</i> of <i>Adonis</i>, farre renowmd by fame.</p><p>
 
 In that same Gardin all the goodly flowres,<br>
 Wherewith dame Nature doth her beautifie,<br>
 And decks the girlonds of her paramoures,<br>
 Are fetcht: there is the first seminarie<br>
 Of all things, that are borne to liue and die,<br>
 According to their kindes.  Long worke it were,<br>
 Here to account the endlesse progenie<br>
 Of all the weedes, that bud and blossome there;<br>
 But so much as doth need, must needs be counted here.</p><p>
 
 It sited was in fruitfull soyle of old,<br>
 And girt in with two walles on either side;<br>
 The one of yron, the other of bright gold,<br>
 That none might thorough breake, nor ouer-stride:<br>
 And double gates it had, which opened wide,<br>
 By which both in and out men moten pas;<br>
 Th'one faire and fresh, the other old and dride:<br>
 Old <i>Genius</i> the porter of them was,<br>
 Old <i>Genius</i>, the which a double nature has.</p><p>
 
 He letteth in, he letteth out to wend,<br>
 All that to come into the world desire;<br>
 A thousand thousand naked babes attend<br>
 About him day and night, which doe require,<br>
 That he with fleshly weedes would them attire:<br>
 Such as him list, such as eternall fate<br>
 Ordained hath, he clothes with sinfull mire,<br>
 And sendeth forth to liue in mortall state,<br>
 Till they againe returne backe by the hinder gate.</p><p>
 
 After that they againe returned beene,<br>
 They in that Gardin planted be againe;<br>
 And grow afresh, as they had neuer seene<br>
 Fleshly corruption, nor mortall paine.<br>
 Some thousand yeares so doen they there remaine;<br>
 And then of him are clad with other hew,<br>
 Or sent into the chaungefull world againe,<br>
 Till thither they returne, where first they grew:<br>
 So like a wheele around they runne from old to new.</p><p>
 
 Ne needs there Gardiner to set, or sow,<br>
 To plant or prune: for of their owne accord<br>
 All things, as they created were, doe grow,<br>
 And yet remember well the mightie word,<br>
 Which first was spoken by th'Almightie lord,<br>
 That bad them to increase and multiply:<br>
 Ne doe they need with water of the ford,<br>
 Or of the clouds to moysten their roots dry;<br>
 For in themselues eternall moisture they imply.</p><p>
 
 Infinite shapes of creatures there are bred,<br>
 And vncouth formes, which none yet euer knew,<br>
 And euery sort is in a sundry bed<br>
 Set by it selfe, and ranckt in comely rew:<br>
 Some fit for reasonable soules t'indew,<br>
 Some made for beasts, some made for birds to weare,<br>
 And all the fruitfull spawne of fishes hew<br>
 In endlesse rancks along enraunged were,<br>
 That seem'd the <i>Ocean</i> could not containe them there.</p><p>
 
 Daily they grow, and daily forth are sent<br>
 Into the world, it to replenish more;<br>
 Yet is the stocke not lessened, nor spent,<br>
 But still remaines in euerlasting store,<br>
 As it at first created was of yore.<br>
 For in the wide wombe of the world there lyes,<br>
 In hatefull darkenesse and in deepe horrore,<br>
 An huge eternall <i>Chaos</i>, which supplyes<br>
 The substances of natures fruitfull progenyes.</p><p>
 
 All things from thence doe their first being fetch,<br>
 And borrow matter, whereof they are made,<br>
 Which when as forme and feature it does ketch,<br>
 Becomes a bodie, and doth then inuade<br>
 The state of life, out of the griesly shade.<br>
 That substance is eterne, and bideth so,<br>
 Ne when the life decayes, and forme does fade,<br>
 Doth it consume, and into nothing go,<br>
 But chaunged is, and often altred to and fro.</p><p>
 
 The substance is not chaunged, nor altered,<br>
 But th'only forme and outward fashion;<br>
 For euery substance is conditioned<br>
 To change her hew, and sundry formes to don,<br>
 Meet for her temper and complexion:<br>
 For formes are variable and decay,<br>
 By course of kind, and by occasion;<br>
 And that faire flowre of beautie fades away,<br>
 As doth the lilly fresh before the sunny ray.</p><p>
 
 Great enimy to it, and to all the rest,<br>
 That in the <i>Gardin</i> of <i>Adonis</i> springs,<br>
 Is wicked <i>Time</i>, who with his scyth addrest,<br>
 Does mow the flowring herbes and goodly things,<br>
 And all their glory to the ground downe flings,<br>
 Where they doe wither, and are fowly mard:<br>
 He flyes about, and with his flaggy wings<br>
 Beates downe both leaues and buds without regard,<br>
 Ne euer pittie may relent his malice hard.</p><p>
 
 Yet pittie often did the gods relent,<br>
 To see so faire things mard, and spoyled quight:<br>
 And their great mother <i>Venus</i> did lament<br>
 The losse of her deare brood, her deare delight:<br>
 Her hart was pierst with pittie at the sight,<br>
 When walking through the Gardin, them she spyde,<br>
 Yet no'te she find redresse for such despight.<br>
 For all that liues, is subiect to that law:<br>
 All things decay in time, and to their end do draw.</p><p>
 
 But were it not, that <i>Time</i> their troubler is,<br>
 All that in this delightfull Gardin growes,<br>
 Should happie be, and haue immortall blis:<br>
 For here all plentie, and all pleasure flowes,<br>
 And sweet loue gentle fits emongst them throwes,<br>
 Without fell rancor, or fond gealosie;<br>
 Franckly each paramour his leman knowes,<br>
 Each bird his mate, ne any does enuie<br>
 Their goodly meriment, and gay felicitie.</p><p>
 
 There is continuall spring, and haruest there<br>
 Continuall, both meeting at one time:<br>
 For both the boughes doe laughing blossomes beare,<br>
 And with fresh colours decke the wanton Prime,<br>
 And eke attonce the heauy trees they clime,<br>
 Which seeme to labour vnder their fruits lode:<br>
 The whiles the ioyous birdes make their pastime<br>
 Emongst the shadie leaues, their sweet abode,<br>
 And their true loues without suspition tell abrode.</p><p>
 
 Right in the middest of that Paradise,<br>
 There stood a stately Mount, on whose round top<br>
 A gloomy groue of mirtle trees did rise,<br>
 Whose shadie boughes sharpe steele did neuer lop,<br>
 Nor wicked beasts their tender buds did crop,<br>
 But like a girlond compassed the hight,<br>
 And from their fruitfull sides sweet gum did drop,<br>
 That all the ground with precious deaw bedight,<br>
 Threw forth most dainty odours, &amp; most sweet delight.</p><p>
 
 And in the thickest couert of that shade,<br>
 There was a pleasant arbour, not by art,<br>
 But of the trees owne inclination made,<br>
 Which knitting their rancke braunches part to part,<br>
 With wanton yuie twyne entrayld athwart,<br>
 And Eglantine, and Caprifole emong,<br>
 Fashiond aboue within their inmost part,<br>
 That nether <i>Phoebus</i> beams could through thẽ throng,<br>
 Nor <i>Aeolus</i> sharp blast could worke them any wrong.</p><p>
 
 And all about grew euery sort of flowre,<br>
 To which sad louers were transformd of yore;<br>
 Fresh <i>Hyacinthus</i>, <i>Phoebus</i> paramoure,<br>
 And dearest loue:<br>
 Foolish <i>Narcisse</i>, that likes the watry shore,<br>
 Sad <i>Amaranthus</i>, made a flowre but late,<br>
 Sad <i>Amaranthus</i>, in whose purple gore<br>
 Me seemes I see <i>Amintas</i> wretched fate,<br>
 To whom sweet Poets verse hath giuen endlesse date.</p><p>
 
 There wont faire <i>Venus</i> often to enioy<br>
 Her deare <i>Adonis</i> ioyous company,<br>
 And reape sweet pleasure of the wanton boy;<br>
 There yet, some say, in secret he does ly,<br>
 Lapped in flowres and pretious spycery,<br>
 By her hid from the world, and from the skill<br>
 Of <i>Stygian</i> Gods, which doe her loue enuy;<br>
 But she her selfe, when euer that she will,<br>
 Possesseth him, and of his sweetnesse takes her fill.</p><p>
 
 And sooth it seemes they say: for he may not<br>
 For euer die, and euer buried bee<br>
 In balefull night, where all things are forgot;<br>
 All be he subiect to mortalitie,<br>
 Yet is eterne in mutabilitie,<br>
 And by succession made perpetuall,<br>
 Transformed oft, and chaunged diuerslie:<br>
 For him the Father of all formes they call;<br>
 Therefore needs mote he liue, that liuing giues to all.</p><p>
 
 There now he liueth in eternall blis,<br>
 Ioying his goddesse, and of her enioyd:<br>
 Ne feareth he henceforth that foe of his,<br>
 Which with his cruell tuske him deadly cloyd:<br>
 For that wilde Bore, the which him once annoyd,<br>
 She firmely hath emprisoned for ay,<br>
 That her sweet loue his malice mote auoyd,<br>
 In a strong rocky Caue, which is they say,<br>
 Hewen vnderneath that Mount, that none him losen may.</p><p>
 
 There now he liues in euerlasting ioy,<br>
 With many of the Gods in company,<br>
 Which thither haunt, and with the winged boy<br>
 Sporting himselfe in safe felicity:<br>
 Who when he hath with spoiles and cruelty<br>
 Ransackt the world, and in the wofull harts<br>
 Of many wretches set his triumphes hye,<br>
 Thither resorts, and laying his sad darts<br>
 Aside, with faire <i>Adonis</i> playes his wanton parts.</p><p>
 
 And his true loue faire <i>Psyche</i> with him playes,<br>
 Faire <i>Psyche</i> to him lately reconcyld,<br>
 After long troubles and vnmeet vpbrayes,<br>
 With which his mother <i>Venus</i> her reuyld,<br>
 And eke himselfe her cruelly exyld:<br>
 But now in stedfast loue and happy state<br>
 She with him liues, and hath him borne a chyld,<br>
 <i>Pleasure</i>, that doth both gods and men aggrate,<br>
  <i>Pleasure</i>, the daughter of <i>Cupid</i> and <i>Psyche</i> late.</p><p>
 
 Hither great <i>Venus</i> brought this infant faire,<br>
 The younger daughter of <i>Chrysogonee</i>,<br>
 And vnto <i>Psyche</i> with great trust and care<br>
 Committed her, yfostered to bee,<br>
 And trained vp in true feminitee:<br>
 Who no lesse carefully her tendered,<br>
 Then her owne daughter <i>Pleasure</i>, to whom shee<br>
 Made her companion, and her lessoned<br>
 In all the lore of loue, and goodly womanhead.</p><p>
 
 In which when she to perfect ripenesse grew,<br>
 Of grace and beautie noble Paragone,<br>
 She brought her forth into the worldes vew,<br>
 To be th'ensample of true loue alone,<br>
 And Lodestarre of all chaste affectione,<br>
 To all faire Ladies, that doe liue on ground.<br>
 To Faery court she came, where many one<br>
 Admyrd her goodly haueour, and found<br>
 His feeble hart wide launched with loues cruell wound.</p><p>
 
 But she to none of them her loue did cast,<br>
 Saue to the noble knight Sir <i>Scudamore</i>,<br>
 To whom her louing hart she linked fast<br>
 In faithfull loue, t'abide for euer more,<br>
 And for his dearest sake endured sore,<br>
 Sore trouble of an hainous enimy;<br>
 Who her would forced haue to haue forlore<br>
 Her former loue, and stedfast loialty,<br>
 As ye may elsewhere read that ruefull history.</p><p>
 
 But well I weene, ye first desire to learne,<br>
 What end vnto that fearefull Damozell,<br>
 Which fled so fast from that same foster stearne,<br>
 Whom with his brethren <i>Timias</i> slew, befell:<br>
 That was to weet, the goodly <i>Florimell</i>;<br>
 Who wandring for to seeke her louer deare,<br>
 Her louer deare, her dearest <i>Marinell</i>,<br>
 Into misfortune fell, as ye did heare,<br>
 And from Prince <i>Arthur</i> fled with wings of idle feare.</p><p>
