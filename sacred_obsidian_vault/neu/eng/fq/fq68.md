 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Calidore brings Priscilla home,<br>
 Pursues the Blatant Beast:<br>
 Saues Serena, whilest Calepine<br>
 By Turpine is opprest.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 T
 rue is, that whilome that good Poet sayd,<br>
 The gentle minde by gentle deeds is knowne.<br>
 For a man by nothing is so well bewrayd,<br>
 As by his manners, in which plaine is showne<br>
 Of what degree and what race he is growne.<br>
 For seldome seene, a trotting Stalion get<br>
 An ambling Colt, that is his proper owne:<br>
 So seldome seene, that one in basenesse set<br>
 Doth noble courage shew, with curteous manners met.<p>
 
 But euermore contrary hath bene tryde,<br>
 That gentle bloud will gentle manners breed;<br>
 As well may be in <i>Calidore</i> descryde,<br>
 By late ensample of that courteous deed,<br>
 Done to that wounded Knight in his great need,<br>
 Whom on his backe he bore, till he him brought<br>
 Vnto the Castle where they had decreed.<br>
 There of the Knight, the which that Castle ought,<br>
 To make abode that night he greatly was besought.</p><p>
 
 He was to weete a man of full ripe yeares,<br>
 That in his youth had beene of mickle might,<br>
 And borne great sway in armes amongst his peares:<br>
 But now weake age had dimd his candle light.<br>
 Yet was he courteous still to euery wight,<br>
 And loued all that did to armes incline.<br>
 And was the father of that wounded Knight,<br>
 Whom <i>Calidore</i> thus carried on his chine,<br>
 And <i>Aldus</i> was his name, and his sonnes <i>Aladine</i>.</p><p>
 
 Who when he saw his sonne so ill bedight,<br>
 With bleeding wounds, brought home vpon a Beare<br>
 By a faire Lady, and a straunger Knight,<br>
 Was inly touched with compassion deare,<br>
 And deare affection of so dolefull dreare,<br>
 That he these words burst forth; Ah sory boy,<br>
 Is this the hope that to my hoary heare<br>
 Thou brings? aie me, is this the timely ioy,<br>
 Which I expected long, now turnd to sad annoy?</p><p>
 
 Such is the weakenesse of all mortall hope;<br>
 So tickle is the state of earthly things,<br>
 That ere they come vnto their aymed scope,<br>
 They fall too short of our fraile reckonings,<br>
 And bring vs bale and bitter sorrowings,<br>
 In stead of comfort, which we should embrace:<br>
 This is the state of Keasars and of Kings.<br>
 Let none therefore, that is in meaner place,<br>
 Too greatly grieue at any his vnlucky case.</p><p>
 
 So well and wisely did that good old Knight<br>
 Temper his griefe, and turned it to cheare,<br>
 To cheare his guests, whom he had stayd that night,<br>
 And make their welcome to them well appeare:<br>
 That to Sir <i>Calidore</i> was easie geare;<br>
 But that faire Lady would be cheard for nought,<br>
 But sigh't and sorrow'd for her louer deare,<br>
 And inly did afflict her pensiue thought,<br>
 With thinking to what case her name should now be brought.</p><p>
 
 For she was daughter to a noble Lord,<br>
 Which dwelt thereby, who sought her to affy<br>
 To a great pere; but she did disaccord,<br>
 Ne could her liking to his loue apply,<br>
 But lou'd this fresh young Knight, who dwelt her ny,<br>
 The lusty <i>Aladine</i>, though meaner borne,<br>
 And of lesse liuelood and hability,<br>
 Yet full of valour, the which did adorne<br>
 His meanesse much, &amp; make her th'others riches scorne.</p><p>
 
 So hauing both found fit occasion,<br>
 They met together in that luckelesse glade;<br>
 Where that proud Knight in his presumption<br>
 The gentle <i>Aladine</i> did earst inuade,<br>
 Being vnarm'd, and set in secret shade.<br>
 Whereof she now bethinking, gan t'aduize,<br>
 How great a hazard she at earst had made<br>
 Of her good fame, and further gan deuize,<br>
 How she the blame might salue with coloured disguize.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Calidore</i> with all good courtesie<br>
 Fain'd her to frolicke, and to put away<br>
 The pensiue fit of her melancholie;<br>
 And that old Knight by all meanes did assay,<br>
 To make them both as merry as he may.<br>
 So they the euening past, till time of rest,<br>
 When <i>Calidore</i> in seemly good array<br>
 Vnto his bowre was brought, and there vndrest,<br>
 Did sleepe all night through weary trauell of his quest.</p><p>
 
 But faire <i>Priscilla</i> (so that Lady hight)<br>
 Would to no bed, nor take no kindely sleepe,<br>
 But by her wounded loue did watch all night,<br>
 And all the night for bitter anguish weepe,<br>
 And with her teares his wounds did wash and steepe.<br>
 So well she washt them, and so well she watcht him,<br>
 That of the deadly swound, in which full deepe<br>
 He drenched was, she at the length dispacht him,<br>
 And droue away the stound, which mortally attacht him.</p><p>
 
 The morrow next, when day gan to vplooke,<br>
 He also gan vplooke with drery eye,<br>
 Like one that out of deadly dreame awooke:<br>
 Where when he saw his faire <i>Priscilla</i> by,<br>
 He deepely sigh't, and groaned inwardly,<br>
 To thinke of this ill state, in which she stood,<br>
 To which she for his sake had weetingly<br>
 Now brought her selfe, and blam'd her noble blood:<br>
 For first, next after life, he tendered her good.</p><p>
 
 Which she perceiuing, did with plenteous teares<br>
 His care more then her owne compassionate,<br>
 Forgetfull of her owne, to minde his feares:<br>
 So both conspiring, gan to intimate<br>
 Each others griefe with zeale affectionate,<br>
 And twixt them twaine with equall care to cast,<br>
 How to saue hole her hazarded estate;<br>
 For which the onely helpe now left them last<br>
 Seem'd to be <i>Calidore</i>: all other helpes were past.</p><p>
 
 Him they did deeme, as sure to them he seemed,<br>
 A courteous Knight, and full of faithfull trust:<br>
 Therefore to him their cause they best esteemed<br>
 Whole to commit, and to his dealing iust.<br>
 Earely, so soone as <i>Titans</i> beames forth brust<br>
 Through the thicke clouds, in which they steeped lay<br>
 All night in darkenesse, duld with yron rust,<br>
 <i>Calidore</i> rising vp as fresh as day,<br>
 Gan freshly him addresse vnto his former way.</p><p>
 
 But first him seemed fit, that wounded Knight<br>
 To visite, after this nights perillous passe,<br>
 And to salute him, if he were in plight,<br>
 And eke that Lady his faire louely lasse.<br>
 There he him found much better then he was,<br>
 And moued speach to him of things of course,<br>
 The anguish of his paine to ouerpasse:<br>
 Mongst which he namely did to him discourse,<br>
 Of former daies mishap, his sorrowes wicked sourse.</p><p>
 
 Of which occasion <i>Aldine</i> taking hold,<br>
 Gan breake to him the fortunes of his loue,<br>
 And all his disaduentures to vnfold;<br>
 That <i>Calidore</i> it dearly deepe did moue.<br>
 In th'end his kyndly courtesie to proue,<br>
 He him by all the bands of loue besought,<br>
 And as it mote a faithfull friend behoue,<br>
 To safeconduct his loue, and not for ought<br>
 To leaue, till to her fathers house he had her brought.</p><p>
 
 Sir <i>Calidore</i> his faith thereto did plight,<br>
 It to performe: so after little stay,<br>
 That she her selfe had to the iourney dight,<br>
 He passed forth with her in faire array,<br>
 Fearelesse, who ought did thinke, or ought did say,<br>
 Sith his own thought he knew most cleare from wite.<br>
 So as they past together on their way,<br>
 He can deuize this counter-cast of slight,<br>
 To giue faire colour to that Ladies cause in sight.</p><p>
 
 Streight to the carkasse of that Knight he went,<br>
 The cause of all this euill, who was slaine<br>
 The day before by iust auengement<br>
 Of noble <i>Tristram</i>, where it did remaine:<br>
 There he the necke thereof did cut in twaine,<br>
 And tooke with him the head, the signe of shame.<br>
 So forth he passed thorough that daies paine,<br>
 Till to that Ladies fathers house he came;<br>
 Most pensiue man, through feare, what of his childe became.</p><p>
 
 There he arriuing boldly, did present<br>
 The fearefull Lady to her father deare,<br>
 Most perfect pure, and guiltlesse innocent<br>
 Of blame, as he did on his Knighthood sweare,<br>
 Since first he saw her, and did free from feare<br>
 Of a discourteous Knight, who her had reft,<br>
 And by outragious force away did beare:<br>
 Witnesse thereof he shew'd his head there left,<br>
 And wretched life forlorne for vengement of his theft.</p><p>
 
 Most ioyfull man her sire was her to see,<br>
 And heare th'aduenture of her late mischaunce;<br>
 And thousand thankes to <i>Calidore</i> for fee<br>
 Of his large paines in her deliueraunce<br>
 Did yeeld; Ne lesse the Lady did aduaunce.<br>
 Thus hauing her restored trustily,<br>
 As he had vow'd, some small continuaunce<br>
 He there did make, and then most carefully<br>
 Vnto his first exploite he did him selfe apply.</p><p>
 
 So as he was pursuing of his quest<br>
 He chaunst to come whereas a iolly Knight,<br>
 In couert shade him selfe did safely rest,<br>
 To solace with his Lady in delight:<br>
 His warlike armes he had from him vndight:<br>
 For that him selfe he thought from daunger free,<br>
 And far from enuious eyes that mote him spight.<br>
 And eke the Lady was full faire to see,<br>
 And courteous withall, becomming her degree.</p><p>
 
 To whom Sir <i>Calidore</i> approaching nye,<br>
 Ere they were well aware of liuing wight,<br>
 Them much abasht, but more him selfe thereby,<br>
 That he so rudely did vppon them light,<br>
 And troubled had their quiet loues delight.<br>
 Yet since it was his fortune, not his fault,<br>
 Him selfe thereof he labour'd to acquite,<br>
 And pardon crau'd for his so rash assault,<br>
 That he gainst courtesie so fowly did default.</p><p>
 
 With which his gentle words and goodly wit<br>
 He soone allayd that Knights conceiu'd displeasure,<br>
 That he besought him downe by him to sit,<br>
 That they mote treat of things abrode at leasure;<br>
 And of aduentures, which had in his measure<br>
 Of so long waies to him befallen late.<br>
 So downe he sate, and with delightfull pleasure<br>
 His long aduentures gan to him relate,<br>
 Which he endured had through daungerous debate.</p><p>
 
 Of which whilest they discoursed both together,<br>
 The faire <i>Serena</i> (so his Lady hight)<br>
 Allur'd with myldnesse of the gentle wether,<br>
 And pleasaunce of the place, the which was dight<br>
 With diuers flowres distinct with rare delight,<br>
 Wandred about the fields, as liking led<br>
 Her wauering lust after her wandring sight,<br>
 To make a garland to adorne her hed,<br>
 Without suspect of ill or daungers hidden dred.</p><p>
 
 All sodainely out of the forrest nere<br>
 The Blatant Beast forth rushing vnaware,<br>
 Caught her thus loosely wandring here and there,<br>
 And in his wide great mouth away her bare,<br>
 Crying aloud to shew her sad misfare<br>
 Vnto the Knights, and calling oft for ayde;<br>
 Who with the horrour of her haplesse care<br>
 Hastily starting vp, like men dismayde,<br>
 Ran after fast, to reskue the distressed mayde.</p><p>
 
 The Beast with their pursuit incited more,<br>
 Into the wood was bearing her apace<br>
 For to haue spoyled her, when <i>Calidore</i><br>
 Who was more light of foote and swift in chace,<br>
 Him ouertooke in middest of his race:<br>
 And fiercely charging him with all his might,<br>
 Forst to forgoe his pray there in the place,<br>
 And to betake him selfe to fearefull flight;<br>
 For he durst not abide with <i>Calidore</i> to fight.</p><p>
 
 Who nathelesse, when he the Lady saw<br>
 There left on ground, though in full euill plight,<br>
 Yet knowing that her Knight now neare did draw,<br>
 Staide not to succour her in that affright,<br>
 But follow'd fast the Monster in his flight:<br>
 Through woods and hils he follow'd him so fast,<br>
 That he nould let him breath nor gather spright,<br>
 But forst him gape and gaspe, with dread aghast,<br>
 As if his lungs and lites were nigh a sunder brast.</p><p>
 
 And now by this Sir <i>Calepine</i>, so hight,<br>
 Came to the place, where he his Lady found<br>
 In dolorous dismay and deadly plight,<br>
 All in gore bloud there tumbled on the ground,<br>
 Hauing both sides through grypt with griesly wound.<br>
 His weapons soone from him he threw away,<br>
 And stouping downe to her in drery swound,<br>
 Vprear'd her from the ground whereon she lay,<br>
 And in his tender armes her forced vp to stay.</p><p>
 
 So well he did his busie paines apply,<br>
 That the faint sprite he did reuoke againe,<br>
 To her fraile mansion of mortality.<br>
 Then vp he tooke her twixt his armes twaine,<br>
 And setting on his steede, her did sustaine<br>
 With carefull hands soft footing her beside,<br>
 Till to some place of rest they mote attaine,<br>
 Where she in safe assuraunce mote abide,<br>
 Till she recured were of those her woundes wide.</p><p>
 
 Now when as <i>Phoebus</i> with his fiery waine<br>
 Vnto his Inne began to draw apace;<br>
 Tho wexing weary of that toylesome paine,<br>
 In trauelling on foote so long a space,<br>
 Not wont on foote with heauy armes to trace,<br>
 Downe in a dale forby a riuers syde,<br>
 He chaunst to spie a faire and stately place,<br>
 To which he meant his weary steps to guyde,<br>
 In hope there for his loue some succour to prouyde.</p><p>
 
 But comming to the riuers side, he found<br>
 That hardly passable on foote it was:<br>
 Therefore there still he stood as in a stound,<br>
 Ne wist which way he through the foord mote pas.<br>
 Thus whilest he was in this distressed case,<br>
 Deuising what to doe, he nigh espyde<br>
 An armed Knight approaching to the place,<br>
 With a faire Lady lincked by his syde,<br>
 The which themselues prepard thorough the foord to ride.</p><p>
 
 Whom <i>Calepine</i> saluting (as became)<br>
 Besought of courtesie in that his neede,<br>
 For safe conducting of his sickely Dame,<br>
 Through that same perillous foord with better heede,<br>
 To take him vp behinde vpon his steed:<br>
 To whom that other did this taunt returne.<br>
 Perdy thou peasant Knight, mightst rightly reed<br>
 Me then to be full base and euill borne,<br>
 If I would beare behinde a burden of such scorne.</p><p>
 
 But as thou hast thy steed forlorne with shame,<br>
 So fare on foote till thou another gayne,<br>
 And let thy Lady likewise doe the same.<br>
 Or beare her on thy backe with pleasing payne,<br>
 And proue thy manhood on the billowes vayne.<br>
 With which rude speach his Lady much displeased,<br>
 Did him reproue, yet could him not restrayne,<br>
 And would on her owne Palfrey him haue eased,<br>
 For pitty of his Dame, whom she saw so diseased.</p><p>
 
 Sir <i>Calepine</i> her thanckt, yet inly wroth<br>
 Against her Knight, her gentlenesse refused,<br>
 And carelesly into the riuer goth,<br>
 As in despight to be so fowle abused<br>
 Of a rude churle, whom often he accused<br>
 Of fowle discourtesie, vnfit for Knight;<br>
 And strongly wading through the waues vnused,<br>
 With speare in th'one hand, stayd him selfe vpright,<br>
 With th'other staide his Lady vp with steddy might.</p><p>
 
 And all the while, that same discourteous Knight,<br>
 Stood on the further bancke beholding him,<br>
 At whose calamity, for more despight<br>
 He laught, and mockt to see him like to swim.<br>
 But when as <i>Calepine</i> came to the brim,<br>
 And saw his carriage past that perill well,<br>
 Looking at that same Carle with count'nance grim,<br>
 His heart with vengeaunce inwardly did swell,<br>
 And forth at last did breake in speaches sharpe and fell.</p><p>
 
 Vnknightly Knight, the blemish of that name,<br>
 And blot of all that armes vppon them take,<br>
 Which is the badge of honour and of fame,<br>
 Loe I defie thee, and here challenge make,<br>
 That thou for euer doe those armes forsake,<br>
 And be for euer held a recreant Knight,<br>
 Vnlesse thou dare for thy deare Ladies sake,<br>
 And for thine owne defence on foote alight,<br>
 To iustifie thy fault gainst me in equall fight.</p><p>
 
 The dastard, that did heare him selfe defyde,<br>
 Seem'd not to weigh his threatfull words at all,<br>
 But laught them out, as if his greater pryde<br>
 Did scorne the challenge of so base a thrall:<br>
 Or had no courage, or else had no gall.<br>
 So much the more was <i>Calepine</i> offended,<br>
 That him to no reuenge he forth could call,<br>
 But both his challenge and him selfe contemned,<br>
 Ne cared as a coward so to be condemned.</p><p>
 
 But he nought weighing what he sayd or did,<br>
 Turned his steede about another way,<br>
 And with his Lady to the Castle rid,<br>
 Where was his won; ne did the other stay,<br>
 But after went directly as he may,<br>
 For his sicke charge some harbour there to seeke;<br>
 Where he arriuing with the fall of day,<br>
 Drew to the gate, and there with prayers meeke,<br>
 And myld entreaty lodging did for her beseeke.</p><p>
 
 But the rude Porter that no manners had,<br>
 Did shut the gate against him in his face,<br>
 And entraunce boldly vnto him forbad.<br>
 Nathelesse the Knight now in so needy case,<br>
 Gan him entreat euen with submission base,<br>
 And humbly praid to let them in that night:<br>
 Who to him aunswer'd, that there was no place<br>
 Of lodging fit for any errant Knight,<br>
 Vnlesse that with his Lord he formerly did fight.</p><p>
 
 Full loth am I (quoth he) as now at earst,<br>
 When day is spent, and rest vs needeth most,<br>
 And that this Lady, both whose sides are pearst<br>
 With wounds, is ready to forgo the ghost:<br>
 Ne would I gladly combate with mine host,<br>
 That should to me such curtesie afford,<br>
 Vnlesse that I were thereunto enforst.<br>
 But yet aread to me, how hight thy Lord,<br>
 That doth thus strongly ward the Castle of the ford.</p><p>
 
 His name (quoth he) if that thou list to learne,<br>
 Is hight Sir <i>Turpine</i>, one of mickle might,<br>
 And manhood rare, but terrible and stearne<br>
 In all assaies to euery errant Knight,<br>
 Because of one, that wrought him fowle despight.<br>
 Ill seemes (sayd he) if he so valiaunt be,<br>
 That he should be so sterne to stranger wight:<br>
 For seldome yet did liuing creature see,<br>
 That curtesie and manhood euer disagree.</p><p>
 
 But go thy waies to him, and fro me say,<br>
 That here is at his gate an errant Knight,<br>
 That house-rome craues, yet would be loth t'assay<br>
 The proofe of battell, now in doubtfull night,<br>
 Or curtesie with rudenesse to requite:<br>
 Yet if he needes will fight, craue leaue till morne,<br>
 And tell withall, the lamentable plight,<br>
 In which this Lady languisheth forlorne,<br>
 That pitty craues, as he of woman was yborne.</p><p>
 
 The groome went streight way in, and to his Lord<br>
 Declar'd the message, which that Knight did moue;<br>
 Who sitting with his Lady then at bord,<br>
 Not onely did not his demaund [ap]proue,<br>
 But both himselfe reuil'd, and eke his loue;<br>
 Albe his Lady, that <i>Blandina</i> hight,<br>
 Him of vngentle vsage did [re]proue<br>
 And earnestly entreated that they might<br>
 Finde fauour to be lodged there for that same night.</p><p>
 
 Yet would he not perswaded be for ought,<br>
 Ne from his currish will awhit reclame.<br>
 Which answer when the groome returning, brought<br>
 To <i>Calepine</i>, his heart did inly flame<br>
 With wrathfull fury for so foule a shame,<br>
 That he could not thereof auenged bee:<br>
 But most for pitty of his dearest Dame,<br>
 Whom now in deadly daunger he did see;<br>
 Yet had no meanes to comfort, nor procure her glee.</p><p>
 
 But all in vaine; for why, no remedy<br>
 He saw, the present mischiefe to redresse,<br>
 But th'vtmost end perforce for to aby,<br>
 Which that nights fortune would for him addresse.<br>
 So downe he tooke his Lady in distresse,<br>
 And layd her vnderneath a bush to sleepe,<br>
 Couer'd with cold, and wrapt in wretchednesse,<br>
 Whiles he him selfe all night did nought but weepe,<br>
 And wary watch about her for her safegard keepe.</p><p>
 
 The morrow next, so soone as ioyous day<br>
 Did shew it selfe in sunny beames bedight,<br>
 <i>Serena</i> full of dolorous dismay,<br>
 Twixt darkenesse dread, and hope of liuing light,<br>
 Vprear'd her head to see that chearefull sight.<br>
 Then <i>Calepine</i>, how euer inly wroth,<br>
 And greedy to auenge that vile despight,<br>
 Yet for the feeble Ladies sake, full loth<br>
 To make there lenger stay, forth on his iourney goth.</p><p>
 
 He goth on foote all armed by her side,<br>
 Vpstaying still her selfe vppon her steede,<br>
 Being vnhable else alone to ride;<br>
 So sore her sides, so much her wounds did bleede:<br>
 Till that at length, in his extreamest neede,<br>
 He chaunst far off an armed Knight to spy,<br>
 Pursuing him apace with greedy speede,<br>
 Whom well he wist to be some enemy,<br>
 That meant to make aduantage of his misery.</p><p>
 
 Wherefore he stayd, till that he nearer drew,<br>
 To weet what issue would thereof betyde,<br>
 Tho whenas he approched nigh in vew,<br>
 By certaine signes he plainely him descryde,<br>
 To be the man, that with such scornefull pryde<br>
 Had him abusde, and shamed yesterday;<br>
 Therefore misdoubting, least he should misguyde<br>
 His former malice to some new assay,<br>
 He cast to keepe him selfe so safely as he may.</p><p>
 
 By this the other came in place likewise,<br>
 And couching close his speare and all his powre,<br>
 As bent to some malicious enterprise,<br>
 He bad him stand, t'abide the bitter stoure<br>
 Of his sore vengeaunce, or to make auoure<br>
 Of the lewd words and deedes, which he had done:<br>
 With that ran at him, as he would deuoure<br>
 His life attonce; who nought could do, but shun<br>
 The perill of his pride, or else be ouerrun.</p><p>
 
 Yet he him still pursew'd from place to place,<br>
 Will full intent him cruelly to kill;<br>
 And like a wilde goate round about did chace,<br>
 Flying the fury of his bloudy will.<br>
 But his best succour and refuge was still<br>
 Behinde his Ladies backe, who to him cryde,<br>
 And called oft with prayers loud and shrill,<br>
 As euer he to Lady was affyde,<br>
 To spare her Knight, and rest with reason pacifyde.</p><p>
 
 But he the more thereby enraged was,<br>
 And with more eager felnesse him pursew'd:<br>
 So that at length, after long weary chace,<br>
 Hauing by chaunce a close aduantage vew'd,<br>
 He ouer raught him, hauing long eschew'd<br>
 His violence in vaine, and with his spere<br>
 Strooke through his shoulder, that the blood ensew'd<br>
 In great aboundance, as a well it were,<br>
 That forth out of an hill fresh gushing did appere.</p><p>
 
 Yet ceast he not for all that cruell wound,<br>
 But chaste him still, for all his Ladies cry;<br>
 Not satisfyde till on the fatall ground<br>
 He saw his life powrd forth dispiteously:<br>
 The which was certes in great ieopardy,<br>
 Had not a wondrous chaunce his reskue wrought,<br>
 And saued from his cruell villany.<br>
 Such chaunces oft exceed all humaine thought:<br>
 That in another Canto shall to end be brought.</p><p>
