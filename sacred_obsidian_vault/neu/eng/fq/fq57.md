 <i>Artegall fights with Radigund<br>
 And is subdewd by guile:<br>
 He is by her emprisoned,<br>
 But wrought by Clarins wile.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 S
 O soone as day forth dawning from the East,<br>
 Nights humid curtaine from the heauens withdrew,<br>
 And earely calling forth both man and beast,<br>
 Comaunded them their daily workes renew,<br>
 These noble warriors, mindefull to pursew<br>
 The last daies purpose of their vowed fight,<br>
 Them selues thereto preparde in order dew;<br>
 The Knight, as best was seeming for a Knight,<br>
 And th'Amazon, as best it likt her selfe to dight.<p>
 
 All in a Camis light of purple silke<br>
 Wouen vppon with siluer, subtly wrought,<br>
 And quilted vppon sattin white as milke,<br>
 Trayled with ribbands diuersly distraught<br>
 Like as the workeman had their courses taught;<br>
 Which was short tucked for light motion<br>
 Vp to her ham, but when she list, it raught<br>
 Downe to her lowest heele, and thereuppon<br>
 She wore for her defence a mayled habergeon.</p><p>
 
 And on her legs she painted buskins wore,<br>
 Basted with bends of gold on euery side,<br>
 And mailes betweene, and laced close afore:<br>
 Vppon her thigh her Cemitare was tide,<br>
 With an embrodered belt of mickell pride;<br>
 And on her shoulder hung her shield, bedeckt<br>
 Vppon the bosse with stones, that shined wide,<br>
 As the faire Moone in her most full aspect,<br>
 That to the Moone it mote be like in each respect.</p><p>
 
 So forth she came out of the citty gate,<br>
 With stately port and proud magnificence,<br>
 Guarded with many damzels, that did waite<br>
 Vppon her person for her sure defence,<br>
 Playing on shaumes and trumpets, that from hence<br>
 Their sound did reach vnto the heauens hight.<br>
 So forth into the field she marched thence,<br>
 Where was a rich Pauilion ready pight,<br>
 Her to receiue, till time they should begin the fight.</p><p>
 
 Then forth came <i>Artegall</i> out of his tent,<br>
 All arm'd to point, and first the Lists did enter:<br>
 Soone after eke came she, with fell intent,<br>
 And countenaunce fierce, as hauing fully bent her,<br>
 That battels vtmost triall to aduenter.<br>
 The Lists were closed fast, to barre the rout<br>
 From rudely pressing to the middle center;<br>
 Which in great heapes them circled all about,<br>
 Wayting, how Fortune would resolue that daungerous dout.</p><p>
 
 The Trumpets sounded, and the field began;<br>
 With bitter strokes it both began, and ended.<br>
 She at the first encounter on him ran<br>
 With furious rage, as if she had intended<br>
 Out of his breast the very heart haue rended:<br>
 But he that had like tempests often tride,<br>
 From that first flaw him selfe right well defended.<br>
 The more she rag'd, the more he did abide;<br>
 She hewd, she foynd, she lasht, she laid on euery side.</p><p>
 
 Yet still her blowes he bore, and her forbore,<br>
 Weening at last to win aduantage new;<br>
 Yet still her crueltie increased more,<br>
 And though powre faild, her courage did accrew:<br>
 Which fayling he gan fiercely her pursew.<br>
 Like as a Smith that to his cunning feat<br>
 The stubborne mettall seeketh to subdew,<br>
 Soone as he feeles it mollifide with heat,<br>
 With his great yron sledge doth strongly on it beat.</p><p>
 
 So did Sir <i>Artegall</i> vpon her lay,<br>
 As if she had an yron anduile beene,<br>
 That flakes of fire, bright as the sunny ray,<br>
 Out of her steely armes were flashing seene,<br>
 That all on fire ye would her surely weene.<br>
 But with her shield so well her selfe she warded,<br>
 From the dread daunger of his weapon keene,<br>
 That all that while her life she safely garded:<br>
 But he that helpe from her against her will discarded.</p><p>
 
 For with his trenchant blade at the next blow<br>
 Halfe of her shield he shared quite away,<br>
 That halfe her side it selfe did naked show,<br>
 And thenceforth vnto daunger opened way.<br>
 Much was she moued with the mightie sway<br>
 Of that sad stroke, that halfe enrag'd she grew,<br>
 And like a greedie Beare vnto her pray,<br>
 With her sharpe Cemitare at him she flew,<br>
 That glauncing downe his thigh, the purple bloud forth drew.</p><p>
 
 Thereat she gan to triumph with great boast,<br>
 And to vpbrayd that chaunce, which him misfell,<br>
 As if the prize she gotten had almost,<br>
 With spightfull speaches, fitting with her well;<br>
 That his great hart gan inwardly to swell<br>
 With indignation, at her vaunting vaine,<br>
 And at her strooke with puissance fearefull fell;<br>
 Yet with her shield she warded it againe,<br>
 That shattered all to peeces round about the plaine.</p><p>
 
 Hauing her thus disarmed of her shield,<br>
 Vpon her helmet he againe her strooke,<br>
 That downe she fell vpon the grassie field,<br>
 In sencelesse swoune, as if her life forsooke,<br>
 And pangs of death her spirit ouertooke.<br>
 Whom when he saw before his foote prostrated,<br>
 He to her lept with deadly dreadfull looke,<br>
 And her sunshynie helmet soone vnlaced,<br>
 Thinking at once both head and helmet to haue raced.</p><p>
 
 But when as he discouered had her face,<br>
 He saw his senses straunge astonishment,<br>
 A miracle of natures goodly grace,<br>
 In her faire visage voide of ornament,<br>
 But bath'd in bloud and sweat together ment;<br>
 Which in the rudenesse of that euill plight,<br>
 Bewrayd the signes of feature excellent:<br>
 Like as the Moone in foggie winters night,<br>
 Doth seeme to be her selfe, though darkned be her light.</p><p>
 
 At sight thereof his cruell minded hart<br>
 Empierced was with pittifull regard,<br>
 That his sharpe sword he threw from him apart,<br>
 Cursing his hand that had that visage mard:<br>
 No hand so cruell, nor no hart so hard,<br>
 But ruth of beautie will it mollifie.<br>
 By this vpstarting from her swoune, she star'd<br>
 A while about her with confused eye;<br>
 Like one that from his dreame is waked suddenlye.</p><p>
 
 Soone as the knight she there by her did spy,<br>
 Standing with emptie hands all weaponlesse,<br>
 With fresh assault vpon him she did fly,<br>
 And gan renew her former cruelnesse:<br>
 And though he still retyr'd, yet nathelesse<br>
 With huge redoubled strokes she on him layd;<br>
 And more increast her outrage mercilesse,<br>
 The more that he with meeke intreatie prayd,<br>
 Her wrathful hand from greedy vengeance to haue stayd.</p><p>
 
 Like as a Puttocke hauing spyde in sight<br>
 A gentle Faulcon sitting on an hill,<br>
 Whose other wing, now made vnmeete for flight,<br>
 Was lately broken by some fortune ill;<br>
 The foolish Kyte, led with licentious will,<br>
 Doth beat vpon the gentle bird in vaine,<br>
 With many idle stoups her troubling still:<br>
 Euen so did <i>Radigund</i> with bootlesse paine<br>
 Annoy this noble Knight, and sorely him constraine.</p><p>
 
 Nought could he do, but shun the dred despight<br>
 Of her fierce wrath, and backward still retyre,<br>
 And with his single shield, well as he might,<br>
 Beare off the burden of her raging yre;<br>
 And euermore he gently did desyre,<br>
 To stay her stroks, and he himselfe would yield:<br>
 Yet nould she hearke, ne let him once respyre,<br>
 Till he to her deliuered had his shield,<br>
 And to her mercie him submitted in plaine field.</p><p>
 
 So was he ouercome, not ouercome,<br>
 But to her yeelded of his owne accord;<br>
 Yet was he iustly damned by the doome<br>
 Of his owne mouth, that spake so warelesse word,<br>
 To be her thrall, and seruice her afford.<br>
 For though that he first victorie obtayned,<br>
 Yet after by abandoning his sword,<br>
 He wilfull lost, that he before attayned.<br>
 No fayrer conquest, then that with goodwill is gayned.</p><p>
 
 Tho with her sword on him she flatling strooke,<br>
 In signe of true subiection to her powre,<br>
 And as her vassall him to thraldome tooke.<br>
 But <i>Terpine</i> borne to'a more vnhappy howre,<br>
 As he, on whom the lucklesse starres did lowre,<br>
 She causd to be attacht, and forthwith led<br>
 Vnto the crooke t'abide the balefull stowre,<br>
 From which he lately had through reskew fled:<br>
 Where he full shamefully was hanged by the hed.</p><p>
 
 But when they thought on <i>Talus</i> hands to lay,<br>
 He with his yron flaile amongst them thondred,<br>
 That they were fayne to let him scape away,<br>
 Glad from his companie to be so sondred;<br>
 Whose presence all their troups so much encombred<br>
 That th'heapes of those, which he did wound and slay,<br>
 Besides the rest dismayd, might not be nombred:<br>
 Yet all that while he would not once assay,<br>
 To reskew his owne Lord, but thought it iust t'obay.</p><p>
 
 Then tooke the Amazon this noble knight,<br>
 Left to her will by his owne wilfull blame,<br>
 And caused him to be disarmed quight,<br>
 Of all the ornaments of knightly name,<br>
 With which whylome he gotten had great fame:<br>
 In stead whereof she made him to be dight<br>
 In womans weedes, that is to manhood shame,<br>
 And put before his lap a napron white,<br>
 In stead of Curiets and bases fit for fight.</p><p>
 
 So being clad, she brought him from the field,<br>
 In which he had bene trayned many a day,<br>
 Into a long large chamber, which was sield<br>
 With moniments of many knights decay,<br>
 By her subdewed in victorious fray:<br>
 Amongst the which she causd his warlike armes<br>
 Be hang'd on high, that mote his shame bewray;<br>
 And broke his sword, for feare of further harmes,<br>
 With which he wont to stirre vp battailous alarmes.</p><p>
 
 There entred in, he round about him saw<br>
 Many braue knights, whose names right well he knew,<br>
 There bound t'obay that Amazons proud law,<br>
 Spinning and carding all in comely rew,<br>
 That his bigge hart loth'd so vncomely vew.<br>
 But they were forst through penurie and pyne,<br>
 To doe those workes, to them appointed dew:<br>
 For nought was giuen them to sup or dyne,<br>
 But what their hands could earne by twisting linnen twyne.</p><p>
 
 Amongst them all she placed him most low,<br>
 And in his hand a distaffe to him gaue,<br>
 That he thereon should spin both flax and tow;<br>
 A sordid office for a mind so braue.<br>
 So hard it is to be a womans slaue.<br>
 Yet he it tooke in his owne selfes despight,<br>
 And thereto did himselfe right well behaue,<br>
 Her to obay, sith he his faith had plight,<br>
 Her vassall to become, if she him wonne in fight.</p><p>
 
 Who had him seene, imagine mote thereby,<br>
 That whylome hath of <i>Hercules</i> bene told,<br>
 How for <i>Iolas</i> sake he did apply<br>
 His mightie hands, the distaffe vile to hold,<br>
 For his huge club, which had subdew'd of old<br>
 So many monsters, which the world annoyed;<br>
 His Lyons skin chaungd to a pall of gold,<br>
 In which forgetting warres, he onely ioyed<br>
 In combats of sweet loue, and with his mistresse toyed.</p><p>
 
 Such is the crueltie of womenkynd,<br>
 When they haue shaken off the shamefast band,<br>
 With which wise Nature did them strongly bynd,<br>
 T'obay the heasts of mans well ruling hand,<br>
 That then all rule and reason they withstand,<br>
 To purchase a licentious libertie.<br>
 But vertuous women wisely vnderstand,<br>
 That they were borne to base humilitie,<br>
 Vnlesse the heauens them lift to lawfull soueraintie.</p><p>
 
 Thus there long while continu'd <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
 Seruing proud <i>Radigund</i> with true subiection;<br>
 How euer it his noble heart did gall,<br>
 T'obay a womans tyrannous direction,<br>
 That might haue had of life or death election:<br>
 But hauing chosen, now he might not chaunge.<br>
 During which time, the warlike Amazon,<br>
 Whose wandring fancie after lust did raunge,<br>
 Gan cast a secret liking to this captiue straunge.</p><p>
 
 Which long concealing in her couert brest,<br>
 She chaw'd the cud of louers carefull plight;<br>
 Yet could it not so thoroughly digest,<br>
 Being fast fixed in her wounded spright,<br>
 But it tormented her both day and night:<br>
 Yet would she not thereto yeeld free accord,<br>
 To serue the lowly vassall of her might,<br>
 And of her seruant make her souerayne Lord:<br>
 So great her pride, that she such basenesse much abhord.</p><p>
 
 So much the greater still her anguish grew,<br>
 Through stubborne handling of her loue-sicke hart;<br>
 And still the more she stroue it to subdew,<br>
 The more she still augmented her owne smart,<br>
 And wyder made the wound of th'hidden dart.<br>
 At last when long she struggled had in vaine,<br>
 She gan to stoupe, and her proud mind conuert<br>
 To meeke obeysance of loues mightie raine,<br>
 And him entreat for grace, that had procur'd her paine.</p><p>
 
 Vnto her selfe in secret she did call<br>
 Her nearest handmayd, whom she most did trust,<br>
 And to her said; <i>Clarinda</i> whom of all<br>
 I trust a liue, sith I thee fostred first;<br>
 Now is the time, that I vntimely must<br>
 Thereof make tryall, in my greatest need:<br>
 It is so hapned, that the heauens vniust,<br>
 Spighting my happie freedome, haue agreed,<br>
 To thrall my looser life, or my last bale to breed.</p><p>
 
 With that she turn'd her head, as halfe abashed,<br>
 To hide the blush which in her visage rose,<br>
 And through her eyes like sudden lightning flashed,<br>
 Decking her cheeke with a vermilion rose:<br>
 But soone she did her countenance compose,<br>
 And to her turning, thus began againe;<br>
 This griefes deepe wound I would to thee disclose,<br>
 Thereto compelled through hart-murdring paine,<br>
 But dread of shame my doubtfull lips doth still restraine.</p><p>
 
 Ah my deare dread (said then the faithfull Mayd)<br>
 Can dread of ought your dreadlesse hart withhold,<br>
 That many hath with dread of death dismayd,<br>
 And dare euen deathes most dreadfull face behold?<br>
 Say on my souerayne Ladie, and be bold;<br>
 Doth not your handmayds life at your foot lie?<br>
 Therewith much comforted, she gan vnfold<br>
 The cause of her conceiued maladie,<br>
 As one that would confesse, yet faine would it denie.</p><p>
 
 <i>Clarin</i> (sayd she) thou seest yond Fayry Knight,<br>
 Whom not my valour, but his owne braue mind<br>
 Subiected hath to my vnequall might;<br>
 What right is it, that he should thraldome find,<br>
 For lending life to me a wretch vnkind;<br>
 That for such good him recompence with ill?<br>
 Therefore I cast, how I may him vnbind,<br>
 And by his freedome get his free goodwill;<br>
 Yet so, as bound to me he may continue still.</p><p>
 
 Bound vnto me, but not with such hard bands<br>
 Of strong compulsion, and streight violence,<br>
 As now in miserable state he stands;<br>
 But with sweet loue and sure beneuolence,<br>
 Voide of malitious mind, or foule offence.<br>
 To which if thou canst win him any way,<br>
 Without discouerie of my thoughts pretence,<br>
 Both goodly meede of him it purchase may,<br>
 And eke with gratefull seruice me right well apay.</p><p>
 
 Which that thou mayst the better bring to pas,<br>
 Loe here this ring, which shall thy warrant bee,<br>
 And token true to old <i>Eumenias</i>,<br>
 From time to time, when thou it best shalt see,<br>
 That in and out thou mayst haue passage free.<br>
 Goe now, <i>Clarinda</i>, well thy wits aduise,<br>
 And all thy forces gather vnto thee;<br>
 Armies of louely lookes, and speeches wise,<br>
 With which thou canst euen <i>Ioue</i> himselfe to loue entise.</p><p>
 
 The trustie Mayd, conceiuing her intent,<br>
 Did with sure promise of her good indeuour,<br>
 Giue her great comfort, and some harts content.<br>
 So from her parting, she thenceforth did labour<br>
 By all the meanes she might, to curry fauour<br>
 With th'Elfin Knight, her Ladies best beloued;<br>
 With daily shew of courteous kind behauiour,<br>
 Euen at the markewhite of his hart she roued,<br>
 And with wide glauncing words, one day she thus him proued.</p><p>
 
 Vnhappie Knight, vpon whose hopelesse state<br>
 Fortune enuying good, hath felly frowned,<br>
 And cruell heauens haue heapt an heauy fate;<br>
 I rew that thus thy better dayes are drowned<br>
 In sad despaire, and all thy senses swowned<br>
 In stupid sorow, sith thy iuster merit<br>
 Might else haue with felicitie bene crowned:<br>
 Looke vp at last, and wake thy dulled spirit,<br>
 To thinke how this long death thou mightest disinherit.</p><p>
 
 Much did he maruell at her vncouth speach,<br>
 Whose hidden drift he could not well perceiue;<br>
 And gan to doubt, least she him sought t'appeach<br>
 Of treason, or some guilefull traine did weaue,<br>
 Through which she might his wretched life bereaue.<br>
 Both which to barre, he with this answere met her;<br>
 Faire Damzell, that with ruth (as I perceaue)<br>
 Of my mishaps, art mou'd to wish me better,<br>
 For such your kind regard, I can but rest your detter.</p><p>
 
 Yet weet ye well, that to a courage great<br>
 It is no lesse beseeming well, to beare<br>
 The storme of fortunes frowne, or heauens threat,<br>
 Then in the sunshine of her countenance cleare<br>
 Timely to ioy, and carrie comely cheare.<br>
 For though this cloud haue now me ouercast,<br>
 Yet doe I not of better times despeyre;<br>
 And, though (vnlike) they should for euer last,<br>
 Yet in my truthes assurance I rest fixed fast.</p><p>
 
 But what so stonie mind (she then replyde)<br>
 But if in his owne powre occasion lay,<br>
 Would to his hope a windowe open wyde,<br>
 And to his fortunes helpe make readie way?<br>
 Vnworthy sure (quoth he) of better day,<br>
 That will not take the offer of good hope,<br>
 And eke pursew, if he attaine it may.<br>
 Which speaches she applying to the scope<br>
 Of her intent, this further purpose to him shope.</p><p>
 
 Then why doest not, thou ill aduized man,<br>
 Make meanes to win thy libertie forlorne,<br>
 And try if thou by faire entreatie, can<br>
 Moue <i>Radigund</i>? who though she still haue worne<br>
 Her dayes in warre, yet (weet thou) was not borne<br>
 Of Beares and Tygres, nor so saluage mynded,<br>
 As that, albe all loue of men she scorne,<br>
 She yet forgets, that she of men was kynded:<br>
 And sooth oft seene, that proudest harts base loue hath blynded.</p><p>
 
 Certes <i>Clarinda</i>, not of cancred will,<br>
 (Sayd he) nor obstinate disdainefull mind,<br>
 I haue forbore this duetie to fulfill:<br>
 For well I may this weene, by that I fynd,<br>
 That she a Queene, and come of Princely kynd,<br>
 Both worthie is for to be sewd vnto,<br>
 Chiefely by him, whose life her law doth bynd,<br>
 And eke of powre her owne doome to vndo,<br>
 And als' of princely grace to be inclyn'd thereto.</p><p>
 
 But want of meanes hath bene mine onely let,<br>
 From seeking fauour, where it doth abound;<br>
 Which if I might by your good office get,<br>
 I to your selfe should rest for euer bound,<br>
 And readie to deserue, what grace I found.<br>
 She feeling him thus bite vpon the bayt,<br>
 Yet doubting least his hold was but vnsound,<br>
 And not well fastened, would not strike him strayt,<br>
 But drew him on with hope, fit leasure to awayt.</p><p>
 
 But foolish Mayd, whyles heedlesse of the hooke,<br>
 She thus oft times was beating off and on,<br>
 Through slipperie footing, fell into the brooke,<br>
 And there was caught to her confusion.<br>
 For seeking thus to salue the Amazon,<br>
 She wounded was with her deceipts owne dart,<br>
 And gan thenceforth to cast affection,<br>
 Conceiued close in her beguiled hart,<br>
 To <i>Artegall</i>, through pittie of his causelesse smart.</p><p>
 
 Yet durst she not disclose her fancies wound,<br>
 Ne to himselfe, for doubt of being sdayned,<br>
 Ne yet to any other wight on ground,<br>
 For feare her mistresse shold haue knowledge gayned,<br>
 But to her selfe it secretly retayned,<br>
 Within the closet of her couert brest:<br>
 The more thereby her tender hart was payned.<br>
 Yet to awayt fit time she weened best,<br>
 And fairely did dissemble her sad thoughts vnrest.</p><p>
 
 One day her Ladie, calling her apart,<br>
 Gan to demaund of her some tydings good,<br>
 Touching her loues successe, her lingring smart.<br>
 Therewith she gan at first to change her mood,<br>
 As one adaw'd, and halfe confused stood;<br>
 But quickly she it ouerpast, so soone<br>
 As she her face had wypt, to fresh her blood:<br>
 Tho gan she tell her all, that she had donne,<br>
 And all the wayes she sought, his loue for to haue wonne.</p><p>
 
 But sayd, that he was obstinate and sterne,<br>
 Scorning her offers and conditions vaine;<br>
 Ne would be taught with any termes, to lerne<br>
 So fond a lesson, as to loue againe.<br>
 Die rather would he in penurious paine,<br>
 And his abridged dayes in dolour wast,<br>
 Then his foes loue or liking entertaine:<br>
 His resolution was both first and last,<br>
 His bodie was her thrall, his hart was freely plast.</p><p>
 
 Which when the cruell Amazon perceiued,<br>
 She gan to storme, and rage, and rend her gall,<br>
 For very fell despight, which she conceiued,<br>
 To be so scorned of a base borne thrall,<br>
 Whose life did lie in her least eye-lids fall;<br>
 Of which she vow'd with many a cursed threat,<br>
 That she therefore would him ere long forestall.<br>
 Nathlesse when calmed was her furious heat,<br>
 She chang'd that threatfull mood, &amp; mildly gan entreat.</p><p>
 
 What now is left <i>Clarinda</i>? what remaines,<br>
 That we may compasse this our enterprize?<br>
 Great shame to lose so long employed paines,<br>
 And greater shame t'abide so great misprize,<br>
 With which he dares our offers thus despize.<br>
 Yet that his guilt the greater may appeare,<br>
 And more my gratious mercie by this wize,<br>
 I will a while with his first folly beare,<br>
 Till thou haue tride againe, &amp; tempted him more neare.</p><p>
 
 Say, and do all, that may thereto preuaile;<br>
 Leaue nought vnpromist, that may him perswade,<br>
 Life, freedome, grace, and gifts of great auaile,<br>
 With which the Gods themselues are mylder made:<br>
 Thereto adde art, euen womens witty trade,<br>
 The art of mightie words, that men can charme;<br>
 With which in case thou canst him not inuade,<br>
 Let him feele hardnesse of thy heauie arme:<br>
 Who will not stoupe with good, shall be made stoupe with harme.</p><p>
 
 Some of his diet doe from him withdraw;<br>
 For I him find to be too proudly fed.<br>
 Giue him more labour, and with streighter law,<br>
 That he with worke may be forwearied.<br>
 Let him lodge hard, and lie in strawen bed,<br>
 That may pull downe the courage of his pride;<br>
 And lay vpon him, for his greater dread,<br>
 Cold yron chaines, with which let him be tide;<br>
 And let, what euer he desires, be him denide.</p><p>
 
 When thou hast all this doen, then bring me newes<br>
 Of his demeane: thenceforth not like a louer,<br>
 But like a rebell stout I will him vse.<br>
 For I resolue this siege not to giue ouer,<br>
 Till I the conquest of my will recouer.<br>
 So she departed, full of griefe and sdaine,<br>
 Which inly did to great impatience moue her.<br>
 But the false mayden shortly turn'd againe<br>
 Vnto the prison, where her hart did thrall remaine.</p><p>
 
 There all her subtill nets she did vnfold,<br>
 And all the engins of her wit display;<br>
 In which she meant him warelesse to enfold,<br>
 And of his innocence to make her pray.<br>
 So cunningly she wrought her crafts assay,<br>
 That both her Ladie, and her selfe withall,<br>
 And eke the knight attonce she did betray:<br>
 But most the knight, whom she with guilefull call<br>
 Did cast for to allure, into her trap to fall.</p><p>
 
 As a bad Nurse, which fayning to receiue<br>
 In her owne mouth the food, ment for her chyld,<br>
 Withholdes it to her selfe, and doeth deceiue<br>
 The infant, so for want of nourture spoyld:<br>
 Euen so <i>Clarinda</i> her owne Dame beguyld,<br>
 And turn'd the trust, which was in her affyde,<br>
 To feeding of her priuate fire, which boyld<br>
 Her inward brest, and in her entrayles fryde,<br>
 The more that she it sought to couer and to hyde.</p><p>
 
 For comming to this knight, she purpose fayned,<br>
 How earnest suit she earst for him had made<br>
 Vnto her Queene, his freedome to haue gayned;<br>
 But by no meanes could her thereto perswade:<br>
 But that in stead therof, she sternely bade<br>
 His miserie to be augmented more,<br>
 And many yron bands on him to lade.<br>
 All which nathlesse she for his loue forbore:<br>
 So praying him t'accept her seruice euermore.</p><p>
 
 And more then that, she promist that she would,<br>
 In case she might finde fauour in his eye,<br>
 Deuize how to enlarge him out of hould.<br>
 The Fayrie glad to gaine his libertie,<br>
 Can yeeld great thankes for such her curtesie,<br>
 And with faire words, fit for the time and place,<br>
 To feede the humour of her maladie;<br>
 Promist, if she would free him from that case,<br>
 He wold by all good means he might, deserue such grace.</p><p>
 
 So daily he faire semblant did her shew,<br>
 Yet neuer meant he in his noble mind,<br>
 To his owne absent loue to be vntrew:<br>
 Ne euer did deceiptfull <i>Clarin</i> find<br>
 In her false hart, his bondage to vnbind;<br>
 But rather how she mote him faster tye.<br>
 Therefore vnto her mistresse most vnkind<br>
 She daily told, her loue he did defye,<br>
 And him she told, her Dame his freedome did denye.</p><p>
 
 Yet thus much friendship she to him did show,<br>
 That his scarse diet somewhat was amended,<br>
 And his worke lessened, that his loue mote grow:<br>
 Yet to her Dame him still she discommended,<br>
 That she with him mote be the more offended.<br>
 Thus he long while in thraldome there remayned,<br>
 Of both beloued well, but litle frended;<br>
 Vntill his owne true loue his freedome gayned,<br>
 Which in an other Canto will be best contayned.</p><p>
