 T
 He rugged forhead that with graue foresight<br>
 Welds kingdomes causes, &amp; affaires of state,<br>
 My looser rimes (I wote) doth sharply wite,<br>
 For praising loue, as I haue done of late,<br>
 And magnifying louers deare debate;<br>
 By which fraile youth is oft to follie led,<br>
 Through false allurement of that pleasing baite,<br>
 That better were in vertues discipled,<br>
 Then with vaine poemes weeds to haue their fancies fed.<p>
 
 Such ones ill iudge of loue, that cannot loue,<br>
 Ne in their frosen hearts feele kindly flame:<br>
 For thy, they ought not thing vnknowne reproue,<br>
 Ne naturall affection faultlesse blame,<br>
 For fault of few that haue abusd the same.<br>
 For it of honor and all vertue is<br>
 The roote, and brings forth glorious flowres of fame,<br>
 That crowne true louers with immortall blis,<br>
 The meed of them that loue, and do not liue amisse.</p><p>
 
 Which who so list looke backe to former ages,<br>
 And call to count the things that then were donne,<br>
 Shall find, that all the workes of those wise sages,<br>
 And braue exploits which great Heroes wonne,<br>
 In loue were either ended or begunne:<br>
 Witnesse the father of Philosophie,<br>
 Which to his <i>Critias</i>, shaded oft from sunne,<br>
 Of loue full manie lessons did apply,<br>
 The which these Stoicke censours cannot well deny.</p><p>
 
 To such therefore I do not sing at all,<br>
 But to that sacred Saint my soueraigne Queene,<br>
 In whose chast breast all bountie naturall,<br>
 And treasures of true loue enlocked beene,<br>
 Boue all her sexe that euer yet was seene;<br>
 To her I sing of loue, that loueth best,<br>
 And best is lou'd of all aliue I weene:<br>
 To her this song most fitly is addrest,<br>
 The Queene of loue, &amp; Prince of peace frõ heauen blest.</p><p>
 
 Which that she may the better deigne to heare,<br>
 Do thou dred infant, <i>Venus</i> dearling doue,<br>
 From her high spirit chase imperious feare,<br>
 And vse of awfull Maiestie remoue:<br>
 In sted thereof with drops of melting loue,<br>
 Deawd with ambrosiall kisses, by thee gotten<br>
 From thy sweete smyling mother from aboue,<br>
 Sprinckle her heart, and haughtie courage soften,<br>
 That she may hearke to loue, and reade this lesson often.</p><p>
