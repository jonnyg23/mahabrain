 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Fayre Pastorella by great hap<br>
 her parents vnderstands:<br>
 Calidore doth the Blatant beast<br>
 subdew, and bynd in bands.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 L
 Ike as a ship, that through the Ocean wyde<br>
 Directs her course vnto one certaine cost,<br>
 Is met of many a counter winde and tyde,<br>
 With which her winged speed is let and crost,<br>
 And she her selfe in stormie surges tost;<br>
 Yet making many a borde, and many a bay,<br>
 Still winneth way, ne hath her compasse lost:<br>
 Right so it fares with me in this long way,<br>
 Whose course is often stayd, yet neuer is astray.<p>
 
 For all that hetherto hath long delayd<br>
 This gentle knight, from sewing his first quest,<br>
 Though out of course, yet hath not bene mis-sayd,<br>
 To shew the courtesie by him profest,<br>
 Euen vnto the lowest and the least.<br>
 But now I come into my course againe,<br>
 To his atchieuement of the <i>Blatant beast</i>;<br>
 Who all this while at will did range and raine,<br>
 Whilst none was him to stop, nor none him to restraine.</p><p>
 
 Sir <i>Calidore</i> when thus he now had raught<br>
 Faire <i>Pastorella</i> from those <i>Brigants</i> powre,<br>
 Vnto the Castle of <i>Belgard</i> her brought,<br>
 Whereof was Lord the good Sir <i>Bellamoure</i>;<br>
 Who whylome was in his youthes freshest flowre<br>
 A lustie knight, as euer wielded speare,<br>
 And had endured many a dreadfull stoure<br>
 In bloudy battell for a Ladie deare,<br>
 The fayrest Ladie then of all that liuing were.</p><p>
 
 Her name was <i>Claribell</i>: whose father hight<br>
 The Lord of <i>Many Ilands</i>, farre renound<br>
 For his great riches and his greater might.<br>
 He through the wealth, wherein he did abound,<br>
 This daughter thought in wedlocke to haue bound<br>
 Vnto the Prince of <i>Picteland</i> bordering nere,<br>
 But she whose sides before with secret wound<br>
 Of loue to <i>Bellamoure</i> empierced were,<br>
 By all meanes shund to match with any forrein fere.</p><p>
 
 And <i>Bellamour</i> againe so well her pleased,<br>
 With dayly seruice and attendance dew,<br>
 That of her loue he was entyrely seized,<br>
 And closely did her wed, but knowne to few.<br>
 Which when her father vnderstood, he grew<br>
 In so great rage, that them in dongeon deepe<br>
 Without compassion cruelly he threw;<br>
 Ye did so streightly them a sunder keepe,<br>
 That neither could to company of th'other creepe.</p><p>
 
 Nathlesse Sir <i>Bellamour</i>, whether through grace<br>
 Or secret guifts so with his keepers wrought,<br>
 That to his loue sometimes he came in place,<br>
 Whereof her wombe vnwist to wight was fraught,<br>
 And in dew time a mayden child forth brought.<br>
 Which she streight way for dread least, if her syre<br>
 Should know thereof, to slay he would haue sought,<br>
 Deliuered to her handmayd, that for hyre<br>
 She should it cause be fostred vnder straunge attyre.</p><p>
 
 The trustie damzell bearing it abrode<br>
 Into the emptie fields, where liuing wight<br>
 Mote not bewray the secret of her lode,<br>
 She forth gan lay vnto the open light<br>
 The litle babe, to take thereof a sight.<br>
 Whom whylest she did with watrie eyne behold,<br>
 Vpon the litle brest like christall bright,<br>
 She mote perceiue a litle purple mold,<br>
 That like a rose her silken leaues did faire vnfold.</p><p>
 
 Well she it markt, and pittied the more,<br>
 Yet could not remedie her wretched case;<br>
 But closing it againe like as before,<br>
 Bedeaw'd with teares there left it in the place:<br>
 Yet left not quite, but drew a litle space<br>
 Behind the bushes, where she her did hyde,<br>
 To weet what mortall hand, or heauens grace<br>
 Would for the wretched infants helpe prouyde,<br>
 For which it loudly cald, and pittifully cryde.</p><p>
 
 At length a Shepheard, which there by did keepe<br>
 His fleecie flocke vpon the playnes around,<br>
 Led with the infants cry, that loud did weepe,<br>
 Came to the place, where when he wrapped found<br>
 Th'abandond spoyle, he softly it vnbound;<br>
 And seeing there, that did him pittie sore,<br>
 He tooke it vp, and in his mantle wound;<br>
 So home vnto his honest wife it bore,<br>
 Who as her owne it nurst, and named euermore.</p><p>
 
 Thus long continu'd <i>Claribell</i> a thrall,<br>
 And <i>Bellamour</i> in bands, till that her syre<br>
 Departed life, and left vnto them all.<br>
 Then all the stormes of fortunes former yre<br>
 Were turnd, and they to freedome did retyre.<br>
 Thenceforth they ioy'd in happinesse together,<br>
 And liued long in peace and loue entyre,<br>
 Without disquiet or dislike of ether,<br>
 Till time that <i>Calidore</i> brought <i>Pastorella</i> thether.</p><p>
 
 Both whom they goodly well did entertaine;<br>
 For <i>Bellamour</i> knew <i>Calidore</i> right well,<br>
 And loued for his prowesse, sith they twaine<br>
 Long since had fought in field.  Als <i>Claribell</i><br>
 No lesse did tender the faire <i>Pastorell</i>,<br>
 Seeing her weake and wan, through durance long.<br>
 There they a while together thus did dwell<br>
 In much delight, and many ioyes among,<br>
 Vntill the damzell gan to wex more sound and strong.</p><p>
 
 Tho gan Sir <i>Calidore</i> him to aduize<br>
 Of his first quest, which he had long forlore;<br>
 Asham'd to thinke, how he that enterprize,<br>
 The which the Faery Queene had long afore<br>
 Bequeath'd to him, forslacked had so sore;<br>
 That much he feared, least reprochfull blame<br>
 With foule dishonour him mote blot therefore;<br>
 Besides the losse of so much loos and fame,<br>
 As through the world thereby should glorifie his name.</p><p>
 
 Therefore resoluing to returne in hast<br>
 Vnto so great atchieuement, he bethought<br>
 To leaue his Loue, now perill being past,<br>
 With <i>Claribell</i>, whylest he that monster sought<br>
 Throughout the world, and to destruction brought.<br>
 So taking leaue of his faire <i>Pastorell</i>,<br>
 Whom to recomfort, all the meanes he wrought,<br>
 With thanks to <i>Bellamour</i> and <i>Claribell</i>,<br>
 He went forth on his quest, and did, that him befell.</p><p>
 
 But first, ere I doe his aduentures tell,<br>
 In this exploite, me needeth to declare,<br>
 What did betide to the faire <i>Pastorell</i>,<br>
 During his absence left in heauy care,<br>
 Through daily mourning, and nightly misfare:<br>
 Yet did that auncient matrone all she might,<br>
 To cherish her with all things choice and rare;<br>
 And her owne handmayd, that <i>Melissa</i> hight,<br>
 Appointed to attend her dewly day and night.</p><p>
 
 Who in a morning, when this Mayden faire<br>
 Was dighting her, hauing her snowy brest<br>
 As yet not laced, nor her golden haire<br>
 Into their comely tresses dewly drest,<br>
 Chaunst to espy vpon her yuory chest<br>
 The rosie marke, which she remembred well<br>
 That litle Infant had, which forth she kest,<br>
 The daughter of her Lady <i>Claribell</i>,<br>
 The which she bore, the whiles in prison she did dwell.</p><p>
 
 Which well auizing, streight she gan to cast<br>
 In her conceiptfull mynd, that this faire Mayd<br>
 Was that same infant, which so long sith past<br>
 She in the open fields had loosely layd<br>
 To Fortunes spoile, vnable it to ayd.<br>
 So full of ioy, streight forth she ran in hast<br>
 Vnto her mistresse, being halfe dismayd,<br>
 To tell her, how the heauens had her graste,<br>
 To saue her chylde, which in misfortunes mouth was plaste.</p><p>
 
 The sober mother seeing such her mood,<br>
 Yet knowing not, what meant that sodaine thro,<br>
 Askt her, how mote her words be vnderstood,<br>
 And what the matter was, that mou'd her so.<br>
 My liefe (sayd she) ye know, that long ygo,<br>
 Whilest ye in durance dwelt, ye to me gaue<br>
 A little mayde, the which ye chylded tho;<br>
 The same againe if now ye list to haue,<br>
 The same is yonder Lady, whom high God did saue.</p><p>
 
 Much was the Lady troubled at that speach,<br>
 And gan to question streight how she it knew.<br>
 Most certaine markes, (sayd she) do me it teach,<br>
 For on her brest I with these eyes did vew<br>
 The litle purple rose, which thereon grew,<br>
 Whereof her name ye then to her did giue.<br>
 Besides her countenaunce, and her likely hew,<br>
 Matched with equall yeares, do surely prieue<br>
 That yond same is your daughter sure, which yet doth liue.</p><p>
 
 The matrone stayd no lenger to enquire,<br>
 But forth in hast ran to the straunger Mayd;<br>
 Whom catching greedily for great desire,<br>
 Rent vp her brest, and bosome open layd,<br>
 In which that rose she plainely saw displayd.<br>
 Then her embracing twixt her armes twaine,<br>
 She long so held, and softly weeping sayd;<br>
 And liuest thou my daughter now againe?<br>
 And art thou yet aliue, whom dead I long did faine.</p><p>
 
 Tho further asking her of sundry things,<br>
 And times comparing with their accidents,<br>
 She found at last by very certaine signes,<br>
 And speaking markes of passed monuments,<br>
 That this young Mayd, whom chance to her presents<br>
 Is her owne daughter, her owne infant deare.<br>
 Tho wondring long at those so straunge euents,<br>
 A thousand times she her embraced nere,<br>
 With many a ioyfull kisse, and many a melting teare.</p><p>
 
 Who euer is the mother of one chylde,<br>
 Which hauing thought long dead, she fyndes aliue,<br>
 Let her by proofe of that, which she hath fylde<br>
 In her owne breast, this mothers ioy descriue:<br>
 For other none such passion can contriue<br>
 In perfect forme, as this good Lady felt,<br>
 When she so faire a daughter saw suruiue,<br>
 As <i>Pastorella</i> was, that nigh she swelt<br>
 For passing ioy, which did all into pitty melt.</p><p>
 
 Thence running forth vnto her loued Lord,<br>
 She vnto him recounted, all that fell:<br>
 Who ioyning ioy with her in one accord,<br>
 Acknowledg'd for his owne faire <i>Pastorell</i>.<br>
 There leaue we them in ioy, and let vs tell<br>
 Of <i>Calidore</i>; who seeking all this while<br>
 That monstrous Beast by finall force to quell,<br>
 Through euery place, with restlesse paine and toile<br>
 Him follow'd, by the tract of his outragious spoile.</p><p>
 
 Through all estates he found that he had past,<br>
 In which he many massacres had left,<br>
 And to the Clergy now was come at last;<br>
 In which such spoile, such hauocke, and such theft<br>
 He wrought, that thence all goodnesse he bereft,<br>
 That endlesse were to tell.  The Elfin Knight,<br>
 Who now no place besides vnsought had left,<br>
 At length into a Monastere did light,<br>
 Where he him foũd despoyling all with maine &amp; might.</p><p>
 
 Into their cloysters now he broken had,<br>
 Through which the Monckes he chaced here &amp; there.<br>
 And them pursu'd into their dortours sad,<br>
 And searched all their cels and secrets neare;<br>
 In which what filth and ordure did appeare,<br>
 Were yrkesome to report; yet that foule Beast<br>
 Nought sparing them, the more did tosse and teare,<br>
 And ransacke all their dennes from most to least,<br>
 Regarding nought religion, nor their holy heast.</p><p>
 
 From thence into the sacred Church he broke,<br>
 And robd the Chancell, and the deskes downe threw,<br>
 And Altars fouled, and blasphemy spoke,<br>
 And th'Images for all their goodly hew,<br>
 Did cast to ground, whilest none was them to rew;<br>
 So all confounded and disordered there.<br>
 But seeing <i>Calidore</i>, away he flew,<br>
 Knowing his fatall hand by former feare;<br>
 But he him fast pursuing, soone approched neare.</p><p>
 
 Him in a narrow place he ouertooke,<br>
 And fierce assailing forst him turne againe:<br>
 Sternely he turnd againe, when he him strooke<br>
 With his sharpe steele, and ran at him amaine<br>
 With open mouth, that seemed to containe<br>
 A full good pecke within the vtmost brim,<br>
 All set with yron teeth in raunges twaine,<br>
 That terrifide his foes, and armed him,<br>
 Appearing like the mouth of <i>Orcus</i> griesly grim.</p><p>
 
 And therein were a thousand tongs empight,<br>
 Of sundry kindes, and sundry quality;<br>
 Some were of dogs, that barked day and night,<br>
 And some of cats, that wrawling still did cry,<br>
 And some of Beares, that groynd continually,<br>
 And some of Tygres, that did seeme to gren,<br>
 And snar at all, that euer passed by:<br>
 But most of them were tongues of mortall men,<br>
 Which spake reprochfully, not caring where nor when.</p><p>
 
 And them amongst were mingled here and there,<br>
 The tongues of Serpents with three forked stings,<br>
 That spat out poyson and gore bloudy gere<br>
 At all, that came within his rauenings,<br>
 And spake licentious words, and hatefull things<br>
 Of good and bad alike, of low and hie;<br>
 Ne Kesars spared he a whit, nor Kings,<br>
 But either blotted them with infamie,<br>
 Or bit them with his banefull teeth of iniury.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Calidore</i> thereof no whit afrayd,<br>
 Rencountred him with so impetuous might,<br>
 That th'outrage of his violence he stayd,<br>
 And bet abacke, threatning in vaine to bite,<br>
 And spitting forth the poyson of his spight,<br>
 That fomed all about his bloody iawes.<br>
 Tho rearing vp his former feete on hight,<br>
 He rampt vpon him with his rauenous pawes,<br>
 As if he would haue rent him with his cruell clawes.</p><p>
 
 But he right well aware, his rage to ward,<br>
 Did cast his shield atweene, and therewithall<br>
 Putting his puissaunce forth, pursu'd so hard,<br>
 That backeward he enforced him to fall:<br>
 And being downe, ere he new helpe could call,<br>
 His shield he on him threw, and fast downe held;<br>
 Like as a bullocke, that in bloudy stall<br>
 Of butchers balefull hand to ground is feld,<br>
 Is forcibly kept downe, till he be throughly queld.</p><p>
 
 Full cruelly the Beast did rage and rore,<br>
 To be downe held, and maystred so with might,<br>
 That he gan fret and fome out bloudy gore,<br>
 Striuing in vaine to rere him selfe vpright.<br>
 For still the more he stroue, the more the Knight<br>
 Did him suppresse, and forcibly subdew;<br>
 That made him almost mad for fell despight.<br>
 He grind, hee bit, he scratcht, he venim threw,<br>
 And fared like a feend, right horrible in hew.</p><p>
 
 Or like the hell-borne <i>Hydra</i>, which they faine<br>
 That great <i>Alcides</i> whilome ouerthrew,<br>
 After that he had labourd long in vaine,<br>
 To crop his thousand heads, the which still new<br>
 Forth budded, and in greater number grew.<br>
 Such was the fury of this hellish Beast,<br>
 Whilest <i>Calidore</i> him vnder him downe threw;<br>
 Who nathemore his heauy load releast,<br>
 But aye the more he rag'd, the more his powre increast.</p><p>
 
 Tho when the Beast saw, he mote nought auaile,<br>
 By force, he gan his hundred tongues apply,<br>
 And sharpely at him to reuile and raile,<br>
 With bitter termes of shamefull infamy;<br>
 Oft interlacing many a forged lie,<br>
 Whose like he neuer once did speake, nor heare,<br>
 Nor euer thought thing so vnworthily:<br>
 Yet did he nought for all that him forbeare,<br>
 But strained him so streightly, that he chokt him neare.</p><p>
 
 At last when as he found his force to shrincke,<br>
 And rage to quaile, he tooke a muzzell strong<br>
 Of surest yron, made with many a lincke;<br>
 Therewith he mured vp his mouth along,<br>
 And therein shut vp his blasphemous tong,<br>
 For neuer more defaming gentle Knight,<br>
 Or vnto louely Lady doing wrong:<br>
 And thereunto a great long chaine he tight,<br>
 With which he drew him forth, euen in his own despight.</p><p>
 
 Like as whylome that strong <i>Tirynthian</i> swaine,<br>
 Brought forth with him the dreadfull dog of hell,<br>
 Against his will fast bound in yron chaine,<br>
 And roring horribly, did him compell<br>
 To see the hatefull sunne, that he might tell<br>
 To griesly <i>Pluto</i>, what on earth was donne,<br>
 And to the other damned ghosts, which dwell<br>
 For aye in darkenesse, which day light doth shonne:<br>
 So led this Knight his captyue with like conquest wonne.</p><p>
 
 Yet greatly did the Beast repine at those<br>
 Straunge bands, whose like till then he neuer bore,<br>
 Ne euer any durst till then impose,<br>
 And chauffed inly, seeing now no more<br>
 Him liberty was left aloud to rore:<br>
 Yet durst he not draw backe; nor once withstand<br>
 The proued powre of noble <i>Calidore</i>,<br>
 But trembled vnderneath his mighty hand,<br>
 And like a fearefull dog him followed through the land.</p><p>
 
 Him through all Faery land he follow'd so,<br>
 As if he learned had obedience long,<br>
 That all the people where so he did go,<br>
 Out of their townes did round about him throng,<br>
 To see him leade that Beast in bondage strong,<br>
 And seeing it, much wondred at the sight;<br>
 And all such persons, as he earst did wrong,<br>
 Reioyced much to see his captiue plight,<br>
 And much admyr'd the Beast, but more admyr'd the Knight.</p><p>
 
 Thus was this Monster by the maystring might<br>
 Of doughty <i>Calidore</i>, supprest and tamed,<br>
 That neuer more he mote endammadge wight<br>
 With his vile tongue, which many had defamed,<br>
 And many causelesse caused to be blamed:<br>
 So did he eeke long after this remaine,<br>
 Vntill that, whether wicked fate so framed,<br>
 Or fault of men, he broke his yron chaine,<br>
 And got into the world at liberty againe.</p><p>
 
 Thenceforth more mischiefe and more scath he wrought<br>
 To mortall men, then he had done before;<br>
 Ne euer could by any more be brought<br>
 Into like bands, ne maystred any more:<br>
 Albe that long time after <i>Calidore</i>,<br>
 The good Sir <i>Pelleas</i> him tooke in hand,<br>
 And after him Sir <i>Lamoracke</i> of yore,<br>
 And all his brethren borne in Britaine land;<br>
 Yet none of them could euer bring him into band.</p><p>
 
 So now he raungeth through the world againe,<br>
 And rageth sore in each degree and state;<br>
 Ne any is, that may him now restraine,<br>
 He growen is so great and strong of late,<br>
 Barking and biting all that him doe bate,<br>
 Albe they worthy blame, or cleare of crime:<br>
 Ne spareth he most learned wits to rate,<br>
 Ne spareth he the gentle Poets rime,<br>
 But rends without regard of person or of time.</p><p>
 
 Ne may this homely verse, of many meanest,<br>
 Hope to escape his venemous despite,<br>
 More then my former writs, all were they clearest<br>
 From blamefull blot, and free from all that wite,<br>
 With which some wicked tongues did it backebite,<br>
 And bring into a mighty Peres displeasure,<br>
 That neuer so deserued to endite.<br>
 Therfore do you my rimes keep better measure,<br>
 And seeke to please, that now is counted wisemens threasure.</p><p>
