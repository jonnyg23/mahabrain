 </p><blockquote>
 <i>Malbecco will no straunge knights host,<br>
 For peeuish gealosie:<br>
 Paridell giusts with Britomart:<br>
 Both shew their auncestrie.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 R
 Edoubted knights, and honorable Dames,<br>
 To whom I leuell all my labours end,<br>
 Right sore I feare, least with vnworthy blames<br>
 This odious argument my rimes should shend,<br>
 Or ought your goodly patience offend,<br>
 Whiles of a wanton Lady I do write,<br>
 Which with her loose incontinence doth blend<br>
 The shyning glory of your soueraigne light,<br>
 And knighthood fowle defaced by a faithlesse knight.<p>
 
 But neuer let th'ensample of the bad<br>
 Offend the good: for good by paragone<br>
 Of euill, may more notably be rad,<br>
 As white seemes fairer, macht with blacke attone;<br>
 Ne all are shamed by the fault of one;<br>
 For lo in heauen, whereas all goodnesse is,<br>
 Emongst the Angels, a whole legione<br>
 Of wicked Sprights did fall from happy blis;<br>
 What wonder then, if one of women all did mis?</p><p>
 
 Then listen Lordings, if ye list to weet<br>
 The cause, why <i>Satyrane</i> and <i>Paridell</i><br>
 Mote not be entertaynd, as seemed meet,<br>
 Into that Castle (as that Squire does tell.)<br>
 Therein a cancred crabbed Carle does dwell,<br>
 That has no skill of Court nor courtesie,<br>
 Ne cares, what men say of him ill or well;<br>
 For all his dayes he drownes in priuitie,<br>
 Yet has full large to liue, and spend at libertie.</p><p>
 
 But all his mind is set on mucky pelfe,<br>
 To hoord vp heapes of euill gotten masse,<br>
 For which he others wrongs, and wreckes himselfe;<br>
 Yet is he lincked to a louely lasse,<br>
 Whose beauty doth her bounty far surpasse,<br>
 The which to him both far vnequall yeares,<br>
 And also far vnlike conditions has;<br>
 For she does ioy to play emongst her peares,<br>
 And to be free from hard restraint and gealous feares.</p><p>
 
 But he is old, and withered like hay,<br>
 Vnfit faire Ladies seruice to supply;<br>
 The priuie guilt whereof makes him alway<br>
 Suspect her truth, and keepe continuall spy<br>
 Vpon her with his other blincked eye;<br>
 Ne suffreth he resort of liuing wight<br>
 Approch to her, ne keepe her company,<br>
 But in close bowre her mewes from all mens sight,<br>
 Depriu'd of kindly ioy and naturall delight.</p><p>
 
 <i>Malbecco</i> he, and <i>Hellenore</i> she hight,<br>
 Vnfitly yokt together in one teeme,<br>
 That is the cause, why neuer any knight<br>
 Is suffred here to enter, but he seeme<br>
 Such, as no doubt of him he neede misdeeme.<br>
 Thereat Sir <i>Satyrane</i> gan smile, and say;<br>
 Extremely mad the man I surely deeme,<br>
 That weenes with watch and hard restraint to stay<br>
 A womans will, which is disposd to go astray.</p><p>
 
 In vaine he feares that, which he cannot shonne:<br>
 For who wotes not, that womans subtiltyes<br>
 Can guilen <i>Argus</i>, when she list misdonne?<br>
 It is not yron bandes, nor hundred eyes,<br>
 Nor brasen walls, nor many wakefull spyes,<br>
 That can withhold her wilfull wandring feet;<br>
 But fast good will with gentle curtesyes,<br>
 And timely seruice to her pleasures meet<br>
 May her perhaps containe, that else would algates fleet.</p><p>
 
 
 Then is he not more mad (said <i>Paridell</i>)<br>
 That hath himselfe vnto such seruice sold,<br>
 In dolefull thraldome all his dayes to dwell?<br>
 For sure a foole I do him firmely hold,<br>
 That loues his fetters, though they were of gold.<br>
 But why do we deuise of others ill,<br>
 Whiles thus we suffer this same dotard old,<br>
 To keepe vs out, in scorne of his owne will,<br>
 And rather do not ransack all, and him selfe kill?</p><p>
 
 Nay let vs first (said <i>Satyrane</i>[)] entreat<br>
 The man by gentle meanes, to let vs in,<br>
 And afterwardes affray with cruell threat,<br>
 Ere that we to efforce it do begin:<br>
 Then if all fayle, we will by force it win,<br>
 And eke reward the wretch for his mesprise,<br>
 As may be worthy of his haynous sin.<br>
 That counsell pleasd: then <i>Paridell</i> did rise,<br>
 And to the Castle gate approcht in quiet wise.</p><p>
 
 Whereat soft knocking, entrance he desyrd.<br>
 The good man selfe, which then the Porter playd,<br>
 Him answered, that all were now retyrd<br>
 Vnto their rest, and all the keyes conuayd<br>
 Vnto their maister, who in bed was layd,<br>
 That none him durst awake out of his dreme;<br>
 And therefore them of patience gently prayd.<br>
 Then <i>Paridell</i> began to chaunge his theme,<br>
 And threatned him with force &amp; punishment extreme.</p><p>
 
 But all in vaine; for nought mote him relent,<br>
 And now so long before the wicket fast<br>
 They wayted, that the night was forward spent,<br>
 And the faire welkin fowly ouercast,<br>
 Gan blowen vp a bitter stormy blast,<br>
 With shoure and hayle so horrible and dred,<br>
 That this faire many were compeld at last,<br>
 To fly for succour to a little shed,<br>
 The which beside the gate for swine was ordered.</p><p>
 
 It fortuned, soone after they were gone,<br>
 Another knight, whom tempest thither brought,<br>
 Came to that Castle, and with earnest mone,<br>
 Like as the rest, late entrance deare besought;<br>
 But like so as the rest he prayd for nought,<br>
 For flatly he of entrance was refusd,<br>
 Sorely thereat he was displeasd, and thought<br>
 How to auenge himselfe so sore abusd,<br>
 And euermore the Carle of curtesie accusd.</p><p>
 
 But to auoyde th'intollerable stowre,<br>
 He was compeld to seeke some refuge neare,<br>
 And to that shed, to shrowd him from the showre,<br>
 He came, which full of guests he found whyleare,<br>
 So as he was not let to enter there:<br>
 Whereat he gan to wex exceeding wroth,<br>
 And swore, that he would lodge with them yfere,<br>
 Or them dislodge, all were they liefe or loth;<br>
 And so defide them each, and so defide them both.</p><p>
 
 Both were full loth to leaue that needfull tent,<br>
 And both full loth in darkenesse to debate;<br>
 Yet both full liefe him lodging to haue lent,<br>
 And both full liefe his boasting to abate;<br>
 But chiefly <i>Paridell</i> his hart did grate,<br>
 To heare him threaten so despightfully.<br>
 As if he did a dogge to kenell rate,<br>
 That durst not barke; and rather had he dy,<br>
 Then when he was defide, in coward corner ly.</p><p>
 
 Tho hastily remounting to his steed,<br>
 He forth issew'd; like as a boistrous wind,<br>
 Which in th'earthes hollow caues hath long bin hid,<br>
 And shut vp fast within her prisons blind,<br>
 Makes the huge element against her kind<br>
 To moue, and tremble as it were agast,<br>
 Vntill that it an issew forth may find;<br>
 Then forth it breakes, and with his furious blast<br>
 Confounds both land &amp; seas, and skyes doth ouercast.</p><p>
 
 Their steel-hed speares they strongly coucht, and met<br>
 Together with impetuous rage and forse,<br>
 That with the terrour of their fierce affret,<br>
 They rudely droue to ground both man and horse,<br>
 That each awhile lay like a sencelesse corse.<br>
 But <i>Paridell</i> sore brused with the blow,<br>
 Could not arise, the counterchaunge to scorse,<br>
 Till that young Squire him reared from below;<br>
 Then drew he his bright sword, &amp; gan about him throw.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Satyrane</i> forth stepping, did them stay<br>
 And with faire treatie pacifide their ire,<br>
 Then when they were accorded from the fray,<br>
 Against that Castles Lord they gan conspire,<br>
 To heape on him dew vengeaunce for his hire.<br>
 They bene agreed, and to the gates they goe<br>
 To burne the same with vnquenchable fire,<br>
 And that vncurteous Carle their commune foe<br>
 To do fowle death to dye, or wrap in grieuous woe.</p><p>
 
 <i>Malbecco</i> seeing them resolu'd in deed<br>
 To flame the gates, and hearing them to call<br>
 For fire in earnest, ran with fearefull speed,<br>
 And to them calling from the castle wall,<br>
 Besought them humbly, him to beare withal,<br>
 As ignoraunt of seruants bad abuse,<br>
 And slacke attendaunce vnto straungers call.<br>
 The knights were willing all things to excuse,<br>
 Though nought beleu'd, &amp; entraũce late did not refuse.</p><p>
 
 They bene ybrought into a comely bowre,<br>
 And seru'd of all things that mote needfull bee;<br>
 Yet secretly their hoste did on them lowre,<br>
 And welcomde more for feare, then charitee;<br>
 But they dissembled, what they did not see,<br>
 And welcomed themselues.  Each gan vndight<br>
 Their garments wet, and weary armour free,<br>
 To dry them selues by <i>Vulcanes</i> flaming light,<br>
 And eke their lately bruzed parts to bring in plight.</p><p>
 
 And eke that straunger knight emongst the rest;<br>
 Was for like need enforst to disaray:<br>
 Tho whenas vailed was her loftie crest,<br>
 Her golden locks, that were in tramels gay<br>
 Vpbounden, did them selues adowne display,<br>
 And raught vnto her heeles; like sunny beames,<br>
 That in a cloud their light did long time stay,<br>
 Their vapour vaded, shew their golden gleames,<br>
 And through the persant aire shoote forth their azure streames.</p><p>
 
 She also dofte her heauy haberieon,<br>
 Which the faire feature of her limbs did hyde,<br>
 And her well plighted frock, which she did won<br>
 To tucke about her short, when she did ryde,<br>
 She low let fall, that flowd from her lanck syde<br>
 Downe to her foot, with carelesse modestee.<br>
 Then of them all she plainly was espyde,<br>
 To be a woman wight, vnwist to bee,<br>
 The fairest woman wight, that euer eye did see.</p><p>
 
 Like as <i>Minerua</i>, being late returnd<br>
 From slaughter of the Giaunts conquered;<br>
 Where proud <i>Encelade</i>, whose wide nosethrils burnd<br>
 With breathed flames, like to a furnace red,<br>
 Transfixed with the speare, downe tombled ded<br>
 From top of <i>Hemus</i>, by him heaped hye;<br>
 Hath loosd her helmet from her lofty hed,<br>
 And her <i>Gorgonian</i> shield gins to vntye<br>
 From her left arme, to rest in glorious victorye.</p><p>
 
 Which whenas they beheld, they smitten were<br>
 With great amazement of so wondrous sight,<br>
 And each on other, and they all on her<br>
 Stood gazing, as if suddein great affright<br>
 Had them surprised.  At last auizing right,<br>
 Her goodly personage and glorious hew,<br>
 Which they so much mistooke, they tooke delight<br>
 In their first errour, and yet still anew<br>
 With wonder of her beauty fed their hungry vew.</p><p>
 
 Yet note their hungry vew be satisfide,<br>
 But seeing still the more desir'd to see,<br>
 And euer firmely fixed did abide<br>
 In contemplation of diuinitie:<br>
 But most they meruail[e]d at her cheualree,<br>
 And noble prowesse, which they had approued,<br>
 That much they faynd to know, who she mote bee;<br>
 Yet none of all them her thereof amoued,<br>
 Yet euery one her likte, and euery one her loued.</p><p>
 
 And <i>Paridell</i> though partly discontent<br>
 With his late fall, and fowle indignity,<br>
 Yet was soone wonne his malice to relent,<br>
 Through gracious regard of her faire eye,<br>
 And knightly worth, which he too late did try,<br>
 Yet tried did adore.  Supper was dight;<br>
 Then they <i>Malbecco</i> prayd of curtesy,<br>
 That of his Lady they might haue the sight,<br>
 And company at meat, to do them more delight.</p><p>
 
 But he to shift their curious request,<br>
 Gan causen, why she could not come in place;<br>
 Her crased health, her late recourse to rest,<br>
 And humid euening ill for sicke folkes cace:<br>
 But none of those excuses could take place;<br>
 Ne would they eate, till she in presence came.<br>
 She came in presence with right comely grace,<br>
 And fairely them saluted, as became,<br>
 And shewd her selfe in all a gentle curteous Dame.</p><p>
 
 They sate to meat, and <i>Satyrane</i> his chaunce<br>
 Was her before, and <i>Paridell</i> besyde;<br>
 But he him selfe sate looking still askaunce,<br>
 Gainst <i>Britomart</i>, and euer closely eyde<br>
 Sir <i>Satyrane</i>, that glaunces might not glyde:<br>
 But his blind eye, that syded <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
 All his demeasnure from his sight did hyde:<br>
 On her faire face so did he feede his fill,<br>
 And sent close messages of loue to her at will.</p><p>
 
 And euer and anone, when none was ware,<br>
 With speaking lookes, that close embassage bore,<br>
 He rou'd at her, and told his secret care:<br>
 For all that art he learned had of yore.<br>
 Ne was she ignoraunt of that lewd lore,<br>
 But in his eye his meaning wisely red,<br>
 And with the like him answerd euermore:<br>
 She sent at him one firie dart, whose hed<br>
 Empoisned was with priuy lust, and gealous dred.</p><p>
 
 He from that deadly throw made no defence,<br>
 But to the wound his weake hart opened wyde;<br>
 The wicked engine through false influence,<br>
 Past through his eyes, and secretly did glyde<br>
 Into his hart, which it did sorely gryde.<br>
 But nothing new to him was that same paine,<br>
 Ne paine at all; for he so oft had tryde<br>
 The powre thereof, and lou'd so oft in vaine,<br>
 That thing of course he counted, loue to entertaine.</p><p>
 
 Thenceforth to her he sought to intimate<br>
 His inward griefe, by meanes to him well knowne,<br>
 Now <i>Bacchus</i> fruit out of the siluer plate<br>
 He on the table dasht, as ouerthrowne,<br>
 Or of the fruitfull liquor ouerflowne,<br>
 And by the dauncing bubbles did diuine,<br>
 Or therein write to let his loue be showne;<br>
 Which well she red out of the learned line,<br>
 A sacrament prophane in mistery of wine.</p><p>
 
 And when so of his hand the pledge she raught,<br>
 The guilty cup she fained to mistake,<br>
 And in her lap did shed her idle draught,<br>
 Shewing desire her inward flame to slake:<br>
 By such close signes they secret way did make<br>
 Vnto their wils, and one eyes watch escape;<br>
 Two eyes him needeth, for to watch and wake,<br>
 Who louers will deceiue.  Thus was the ape,<br>
 By their faire handling, put into <i>Malbeccoes</i> cape.</p><p>
 
 Now when of meats and drinks they had their fill,<br>
 Purpose was moued by that gentle Dame,<br>
 Vnto those knights aduenturous, to tell<br>
 Of deeds of armes, which vnto them became,<br>
 And euery one his kindred, and his name.<br>
 Then <i>Paridell</i>, in whom a kindly pryde<br>
 Of gracious speach, and skill his words to frame<br>
 Abounded, being glad of so fit tyde<br>
 Him to commend to her, thus spake, of all well eyde.</p><p>
 
 <i>Troy</i>, that art now nought, but an idle name,<br>
 And in thine ashes buried low dost lie,<br>
 Though whilome far much greater then thy fame,<br>
 Before that angry Gods, and cruell skye<br>
 Vpon thee heapt a direfull destinie,<br>
 What boots it boast thy glorious descent,<br>
 And fetch from heauen thy great Genealogie,<br>
 Sith all thy worthy prayses being blent,<br>
 Their of-spring hath embaste, and later glory shent.</p><p>
 
 Most famous Worthy of the world, by whome<br>
 That warre was kindled, which did <i>Troy</i> inflame,<br>
 And stately towres of <i>Ilion</i> whilome<br>
 Brought vnto balefull ruine, was by name<br>
 Sir <i>Paris</i> far renowmd through noble fame,<br>
 Who through great prowesse and bold hardinesse,<br>
 From <i>Lacedæmon</i> fetcht the fairest Dame,<br>
 That euer <i>Greece</i> did boast, or knight possesse,<br>
 Whom <i>Venus</i> to him gaue for meed of worthinesse.</p><p>
 
 Faire <i>Helene</i>, flowre of beautie excellent,<br>
 And girlond of the mighty Conquerours,<br>
 That madest many Ladies deare lament<br>
 The heauie losse of their braue Paramours,<br>
 Which they far off beheld from <i>Troian</i> toures,<br>
 And saw the fieldes of faire <i>Scamander</i> strowne<br>
 With carcases of noble warrioures,<br>
 Whose fruitlesse liues were vnder furrow sowne,<br>
 And <i>Xanthus</i> sandy bankes with bloud all ouerflowne.</p><p>
 
 From him my linage I deriue aright,<br>
 Who long before the ten yeares siege of <i>Troy</i>,<br>
 Whiles yet on <i>Ida</i> he a shepheard hight,<br>
 On faire <i>Oenone</i> got a louely boy,<br>
 Whom for remembraunce of her passed ioy,<br>
 She of his Father <i>Parius</i> did name;<br>
 Who, after <i>Greekes</i> did <i>Priams</i> realme destroy,<br>
 Gathred the <i>Troian</i> reliques sau'd from flame,<br>
 And with them sayling thence, to th'Isle of <i>Paros</i> came.</p><p>
 
 That was by him cald <i>Paros</i>, which before<br>
 Hight <i>Nausa</i>, there he many yeares did raine,<br>
 And built <i>Nausicle</i> by the <i>Pontick</i> shore,<br>
 The which he dying left next in remaine<br>
 To <i>Paridas</i> his sonne.<br>
 From whom I <i>Paridell</i> by kin descend;<br>
 But for faire Ladies loue, and glories gaine,<br>
 My natiue soile haue left, my dayes to spend<br>
 In sewing deeds of armes, my liues and labours end.</p><p>
 
 Whenas the noble <i>Britomart</i> heard tell<br>
 Of <i>Troian</i> warres, and <i>Priams</i> Citie sackt,<br>
 The ruefull story of Sir <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
 She was empassiond at that piteous act,<br>
 With zelous enuy of Greekes cruell fact,<br>
 Against that nation, from whose race of old<br>
 She heard, that she was lineally extract:<br>
 For noble <i>Britons</i> sprong from <i>Troians</i> bold,<br>
 And <i>Troynouant</i> was built of old <i>Troyes</i> ashes cold.</p><p>
 
 Then sighing soft awhile, at last she thus:<br>
 O lamentable fall of famous towne,<br>
 Which raignd so many yeares victorious,<br>
 And of all <i>Asie</i> bore the soueraigne crowne,<br>
 In one sad night consumd, and throwen downe:<br>
 What stony hart, that heares thy haplesse fate,<br>
 Is not empierst with deepe compassiowne,<br>
 And makes ensample of mans wretched state,<br>
 That floures so fresh at morne, and fades at euening late?</p><p>
 
 Behold, Sir, how your pitifull complaint<br>
 Hath found another partner of your payne:<br>
 For nothing may impresse so deare constraint,<br>
 As countries cause, and commune foes disdayne.<br>
 But if it should not grieue you, backe agayne<br>
 To turne your course, I would to heare desyre,<br>
 What to <i>Aeneas</i> fell; sith that men sayne<br>
 He was not in the Cities wofull fyre<br>
 Consum'd, but did him selfe to safetie retyre.</p><p>
 
 <i>Anchyses</i> sonne begot of <i>Venus</i> faire,<br>
 (Said he,) out of the flames for safegard fled,<br>
 And with a remnant did to sea repaire,<br>
 Where he through fatall errour long was led<br>
 Full many yeares, and weetlesse wandered<br>
 From shore to shore, emongst the Lybicke sands,<br>
 Ere rest he found.  Much there he suffered,<br>
 And many perils past in forreine lands,<br>
 To saue his people sad from victours vengefull hands.</p><p>
 
 At last in <i>Latium</i> he did arriue,<br>
 Where he with cruell warre was entertaind<br>
 Of th'inland folke, which sought him backe to driue,<br>
 Till he with old <i>Latinus</i> was constraind,<br>
 To contract wedlock: (so the fates ordaind.)<br>
 Wedlock contract in bloud, and eke in blood<br>
 Accomplished, that many deare complaind:<br>
 The riuall slaine, the victour through the flood<br>
 Escaped hardly, hardly praisd his wedlock good.</p><p>
 
 Yet after all, he victour did suruiue,<br>
 And with <i>Latinus</i> did the kingdome part.<br>
 But after when both nations gan to striue,<br>
 Into their names the title to conuart,<br>
 His sonne <i>Iulus</i> did from thence depart,<br>
 With all the warlike youth of <i>Troians</i> bloud,<br>
 And in long <i>Alba</i> plast his throne apart,<br>
 Where faire it florished, and long time it stoud,<br>
 Till <i>Romulus</i> renewing it, to <i>Rome</i> remoud.</p><p>
 
 There there (said <i>Britomart</i>) a fresh appeard<br>
 The glory of the later world to spring,<br>
 And <i>Troy</i> againe out of her dust was reard,<br>
 To sit in second seat of soueraigne king,<br>
 Of all the world vnder her gouerning.<br>
 But a third kingdome yet is to arise,<br>
 Out of the <i>Troians</i> scattered of-spring,<br>
 That in all glory and great enterprise,<br>
 Both first and second <i>Troy</i> shall dare to equalise.</p><p>
 
 It <i>Troynouant</i> is hight, that with the waues<br>
 Of wealthy <i>Thamis</i> washed is along,<br>
 Vpon whose stubborne neck, whereat he raues<br>
 With roring rage, and sore him selfe does throng,<br>
 That all men feare to tempt his billowes strong,<br>
 She fastned hath her foot, which standes so hy,<br>
 That it a wonder of the world is song<br>
 In forreine landes, and all which passen by,<br>
 Beholding it from far, do thinke it threates the skye.</p><p>
 
 The <i>Troian Brute</i> did first that Citie found,<br>
 And Hygate made the meare thereof by West,<br>
 And <i>Ouert</i> gate by North: that is the bound<br>
 Toward the land; two riuers bound the rest.<br>
 So huge a scope at first him seemed best,<br>
 To be the compasse of his kingdomes seat:<br>
 So huge a mind could not in lesser rest,<br>
 Ne in small meares containe his glory great,<br>
 That <i>Albion</i> had conquered first by warlike feat.</p><p>
 
 Ah fairest Lady knight, (said <i>Paridell</i>)<br>
 Pardon I pray my heedlesse ouersight,<br>
 Who had forgot, that whilome I heard tell<br>
 From aged <i>Mnemon</i>; for my wits bene light.<br>
 Indeed he said (if I remember right,)<br>
 That of the antique <i>Troian</i> stocke, there grew<br>
 Another plant, that raught to wondrous hight,<br>
 And far abroad his mighty branches threw,<br>
 Into the vtmost Angle of the world he knew.</p><p>
 
 For that same <i>Brute</i>, whom much he did aduaunce<br>
 In all his speach, was <i>Syluius</i> his sonne,<br>
 Whom hauing slaine, through luckles arrowes glaũce<br>
 He fled for feare of that he had misdonne,<br>
 Or else for shame, so fowle reproch to shonne,<br>
 And with him led to sea an youthly trayne,<br>
 Where wearie wandring they long time did wonne,<br>
 And many fortunes prou'd in th'<i>Ocean</i> mayne,<br>
 And great aduẽtures found, that now were lõg to sayne.</p><p>
 
 At last by fatall course they driuen were<br>
 Into an Island spatious and brode,<br>
 The furthest North, that did to them appeare:<br>
 Which after rest they seeking far abrode,<br>
 Found it the fittest soyle for their abode,<br>
 Fruitfull of all things fit for liuing foode,<br>
 But wholy wast, and void of peoples trode,<br>
 Saue an huge nation of the Geaunts broode,<br>
 That fed on liuing flesh, &amp; druncke mens vitall blood.</p><p>
 
 Whom he through wearie wars and labours long,<br>
 Subdewd with losse of many <i>Britons</i> bold:<br>
 In which the great <i>Goemagot</i> of strong<br>
 <i>Corineus</i>, and <i>Coulin</i> of <i>Debon</i> old<br>
 Were ouerthrowne and layd on th'earth full cold,<br>
 Which quaked vnder their so hideous masse,<br>
 A famous history to be enrold<br>
 In euerlasting moniments of brasse,<br>
 That all the antique Worthies merits far did passe.</p><p>
 
 His worke great <i>Troynouant</i>, his worke is eke<br>
 Faire <i>Lincolne</i>, both renowmed far away,<br>
 That who from East to West will endlong seeke,<br>
 Cannot two fairer Cities find this day,<br>
 Except <i>Cleopolis:</i> so heard I say<br>
 Old <i>Mnemon</i>.  Therefore Sir, I greet you well<br>
 Your countrey kin, and you entirely pray<br>
 Of pardon for the strife, which late befell<br>
 Betwixt vs both vnknowne.  So ended <i>Paridell</i>.</p><p>
 
 But all the while, that he these speaches spent,<br>
 Vpon his lips hong faire Dame <i>Hellenore</i>,<br>
 With vigilant regard, and dew attent,<br>
 Fashioning worlds of fancies euermore<br>
 In her fraile wit, that now her quite forlore:<br>
 The whiles vnwares away her wondring eye,<br>
 And greedy eares her weake hart from her bore:<br>
 Which he perceiuing, euer priuily<br>
 In speaking, many false belgardes at her let fly.</p><p>
 
 So long these knights discoursed diuersly,<br>
 Of straunge affaires, and noble hardiment,<br>
 Which they had past with mickle ieopardy,<br>
 That now the humid night was farforth spent,<br>
 And heauenly lampes were halfendeale ybrent:<br>
 Which th'old man seeing well, who too long thought<br>
 Euery discourse and euery argument,<br>
 Which by the houres he measured, besought<br>
 Them go to rest. So all vnto their bowres were brought.</p><p>
