 <i>Contayning</i></p><p> 
  THE LEGEND OF ARTEGALL</p><p> 
 <i>OR</i><br>
 OF IVSTICE.
 </p></center><p> 
 
 </p><p>
 </p><blockquote>
 SO oft as I with state of present time,<br>
 The image of the antique world compare,<br>
 When as mans age was in his freshest prime,<br>
 And the first blossome of faire vertue bare,<br>
 Such oddes I finde twixt those, and these which are,<br>
 As that, through long continuance of his course,<br>
 Me seemes the world is runne quite out of square,<br>
 From the first point of his appointed sourse,<br>
 And being once amisse growes daily wourse and wourse.<p>
 
 For from the golden age, that first was named,<br>
 It's now at earst become a stonie one;<br>
 And men themselues, the which at first were framed<br>
 Of earthly mould, and form'd of flesh and bone,<br>
 Are now transformed into hardest stone:<br>
 Such as behind their backs (so backward bred)<br>
 Were throwne by <i>Pyrrha</i> and <i>Deucalione</i>:<br>
 And if then those may any worse be red,<br>
 They into that ere long will be degendered.</p><p>
 
 Let none then blame me, if in discipline<br>
 Of vertue and of ciuill vses lore,<br>
 I doe not forme them to the common line<br>
 Of present dayes, which are corrupted sore,<br>
 But to the antique vse, which was of yore,<br>
 When good was onely for it selfe desyred,<br>
 And all men sought their owne, and none no more;<br>
 When Iustice was not for most meed outhyred,<br>
 But simple Truth did rayne, and was of all admyred.</p><p>
 
 For that which all men then did vertue call,<br>
 Is now cald vice; and that which vice was hight,<br>
 Is now hight vertue, and so vs'd of all:<br>
 Right now is wrong, and wrong that was is right,<br>
 As all things else in time are chaunged quight.<br>
 Ne wonder; for the heauens reuolution<br>
 Is wandred farre from where it first was pight,<br>
 And so doe make contrarie constitution<br>
 Of all this lower world, toward his dissolution.</p><p>
 
 For who so list into the heauens looke,<br>
 And search the courses of the rowling spheares,<br>
 Shall find that from the point, where they first tooke<br>
 Their setting forth, in these few thousand yeares<br>
 They all are wandred much; that plaine appeares.<br>
 For that same golden fleecy Ram, which bore<br>
 <i>Phrixus</i> and <i>Helle</i> from their stepdames feares,<br>
 Hath now forgot, where he was plast of yore,<br>
 And shouldred hath the Bull, which fayre <i>Europa</i> bore.</p><p>
 
 And eke the Bull hath with his bow-bent horne<br>
 So hardly butted those two twinnes of <i>Ioue</i>,<br>
 That they haue crusht the Crab, and quite him borne<br>
 Into the great <i>Nemoean</i> lions groue.<br>
 So now all range, and doe at randon roue<br>
 Out of their proper places farre away,<br>
 And all this world with them amisse doe moue,<br>
 And all his creatures from their course astray,<br>
 Till they arriue at their last ruinous decay.</p><p>
 
 Ne is that same great glorious lampe of light,<br>
 That doth enlumine all these lesser fyres,<br>
 In better case, ne keepes his course more right,<br>
 But is miscaried with the other Spheres.<br>
 For since the terme of fourteene hundred fyeres,<br>
 That learned <i>Ptolomaee</i> his hight did take,<br>
 He is declyned from that marke of theirs,<br>
 Nigh thirtie minutes to the Southerne lake;<br>
 That makes me feare in time he will vs quite forsake.</p><p>
 
 And if to those <i>Ægyptian</i> wisards old,<br>
 Which in Star-read were wont haue best insight,<br>
 Faith may be giuen, it is by them told,<br>
 That since the time they first tooke the Sunnes hight,<br>
 Foure times his place he shifted hath in sight,<br>
 And twice hath risen, where he now doth West,<br>
 And wested twice, where he ought rise aright.<br>
 But most is <i>Mars</i> amisse of all the rest,<br>
 And next to him old <i>Saturne</i>, that was wont be best.</p><p>
 
 For during <i>Saturnes</i> ancient raigne it's sayd,<br>
 That all the world with goodnesse did abound:<br>
 All loued vertue, no man was affrayd<br>
 Of force, ne fraud in wight was to be found:<br>
 No warre was knowne, no dreadfull trompets sound,<br>
 Peace vniuersall rayn'd mongst men and beasts,<br>
 And all things freely grew out of the ground:<br>
 Iustice sate high ador'd with solemne feasts,<br>
 And to all people did diuide her dred beheasts.</p><p>
 
 Most sacred vertue she of all the rest,<br>
 Resembling God in his imperiall might;<br>
 Whose soueraine powre is herein most exprest,<br>
 That both to good and bad he dealeth right,<br>
 And all his workes with Iustice hath bedight.<br>
 That powre he also doth to Princes lend,<br>
 And makes them like himselfe in glorious sight,<br>
 To sit in his owne seate, his cause to end,<br>
 And rule his people right, as he doth recommend.</p><p>
 
 Dread Souerayne Goddesse, that doest highest sit<br>
 In seate of iudgement, in th'Almighties stead,<br>
 And with magnificke might and wondrous wit<br>
 Doest to thy people righteous doome aread,<br>
 That furthest Nations filles with awfull dread,<br>
 Pardon the boldnesse of thy basest thrall,<br>
 That dare discourse of so diuine a read,<br>
 As thy great iustice praysed ouer all:<br>
 The instrument whereof loe here thy <i>Artegall</i>.</p><p>
