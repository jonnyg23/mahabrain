 <i>Prince Arthure ouercomes Disdaine,<br>
 Quites Mirabell from dreed:<br>

 By Calepine is freed.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 Y
 e gentle Ladies, in whose soueraine powre<br>
 Loue hath the glory of his kingdome left,<br>
 And th'hearts of men, as your eternall dowre,<br>
 In yron chaines, of liberty bereft,<br>
 Deliuered hath into your hands by gift;<br>
 Be well aware, how ye the same doe vse,<br>
 That pride doe not to tyranny you lift;<br>
 Least if men you of cruelty accuse,<br>
 He from you take that chiefedome, which ye doe abuse.<p>
 
 And as ye soft and tender are by kynde,<br>
 Adornd with goodly gifts of beauties grace,<br>
 So be ye soft and tender eeke in mynde;<br>
 But cruelty and hardnesse from you chace,<br>
 That all your other praises will deface,<br>
 And from you turne the loue of men to hate.<br>
 Ensample take of <i>Mirabellaes</i> case,<br>
 Who from the high degree of happy state,<br>
 Fell into wretched woes, which she repented late.</p><p>
 
 Who after thraldome of the gentle Squire,<br>
 Which she beheld with lamentable eye,<br>
 Was touched with compassion entire,<br>
 And much lamented his calamity,<br>
 That for her sake fell into misery:<br>
 Which booted nought for prayers, nor for threat<br>
 To hope for to release or mollify;<br>
 For aye the more, that she did them entreat,<br>
 The more they him misust, and cruelly did beat.</p><p>
 
 So as they forward on their way did pas,<br>
 Him still reuiling and afflicting sore,<br>
 They met Prince <i>Arthure</i> with Sir <i>Enias</i>,<br>
 (That was that courteous Knight, whom he before<br>
 Hauing subdew'd, yet did to life restore,)<br>
 To whom as they approcht, they gan augment<br>
 Their cruelty, and him to punish more,<br>
 Scourging and haling him more vehement;<br>
 As if it them should grieue to see his punishment.</p><p>
 
 The Squire him selfe when as he saw his Lord,<br>
 The witnesse of his wretchednesse, in place,<br>
 Was much asham'd, that with an hempen cord<br>
 He like a dog was led in captiue case,<br>
 And did his head for bashfulnesse abase,<br>
 As loth to see, or to be seene at all:<br>
 Shame would be hid. But whenas <i>Enias</i><br>
 Beheld two such, of two such villaines thrall,<br>
 His manly mynde was much emmoued therewithall.</p><p>
 
 And to the Prince thus sayd; See you Sir Knight,<br>
 The greatest shame that euer eye yet saw?<br>
 Yond Lady and her Squire with foule despight<br>
 Abusde, against all reason and all law,<br>
 Without regard of pitty or of awe.<br>
 See how they doe that Squire beat and reuile;<br>
 See how they doe the Lady hale and draw.<br>
 But if ye please to lend me leaue a while,<br>
 I will them soone acquite, and both of blame assoile.</p><p>
 
 The Prince assented, and then he streight way<br>
 Dismounting light, his shield about him threw,<br>
 With which approching, thus he gan to say;<br>
 Abide ye caytiue treachetours vntrew,<br>
 That haue with treason thralled vnto you<br>
 These two, vnworthy of your wretched bands;<br>
 And now your crime with cruelty pursew.<br>
 Abide, and from them lay your loathly hands;<br>
 Or else abide the death, that hard before you stands.</p><p>
 
 The villaine stayd not aunswer to inuent,<br>
 But with his yron club preparing way,<br>
 His mindes sad message backe vnto him sent;<br>
 The which descended with such dreadfull sway,<br>
 That seemed nought the course thereof could stay:<br>
 No more then lightening from the lofty sky.<br>
 Ne list the Knight the powre thereof assay,<br>
 Whose doome was death, but lightly slipping by,<br>
 Vnwares defrauded his intended destiny.</p><p>
 
 And to requite him with the like againe,<br>
 With his sharpe sword he fiercely at him flew,<br>
 And strooke so strongly, that the Carle with paine<br>
 Saued him selfe, but that he there him slew:<br>
 Yet sau'd not so, but that the bloud it drew,<br>
 And gaue his foe good hope of victory.<br>
 Who therewith flesht, vpon him set anew,<br>
 And with the second stroke, thought certainely<br>
 To haue supplyde the first, and paide the vsury.</p><p>
 
 But Fortune aunswerd not vnto his call;<br>
 For as his hand was heaued vp on hight,<br>
 The villaine met him in the middle fall,<br>
 And with his club bet backe his brondyron bright<br>
 So forcibly, that with his owne hands might<br>
 Rebeaten backe vpon him selfe againe,<br>
 He driuen was to ground in selfe despight;<br>
 From whence ere he recouery could gaine,<br>
 He in his necke had set his foote with fell disdaine.</p><p>
 
 With that the foole, which did that end awayte,<br>
 Came running in, and whilest on ground he lay,<br>
 Laide heauy hands on him, and held so strayte,<br>
 That downe he kept him with his scornefull sway,<br>
 So as he could not weld him any way.<br>
 The whiles that other villaine went about<br>
 Him to haue bound, and thrald without delay;<br>
 The whiles the foole did him reuile and flout,<br>
 Threatning to yoke them tow &amp; tame their corage stout.</p><p>
 
 As when a sturdy ploughman with his hynde<br>
 By strength haue ouerthrowne a stubborne steare,<br>
 They downe him hold, and fast with cords do bynde,<br>
 Till they him force the buxome yoke to beare:<br>
 So did these two this Knight oft tug and teare.<br>
 Which when the Prince beheld, there standing by,<br>
 He left his lofty steede to aide him neare,<br>
 And buckling soone him selfe, gan fiercely fly<br>
 Vppon that Carle, to saue his friend from ieopardy.</p><p>
 
 The villaine leauing him vnto his mate<br>
 To be captiu'd, and handled as he list,<br>
 Himselfe addrest vnto this new debate,<br>
 And with his club him all about so blist,<br>
 That he which way to turne him scarcely wist:<br>
 Sometimes aloft he layd, sometimes alow;<br>
 Now here, now there, and oft him neare he mist;<br>
 So doubtfully, that hardly one could know<br>
 Whether more wary were to giue or ward the blow.</p><p>
 
 But yet the Prince so well enured was<br>
 With such huge strokes, approued oft in fight,<br>
 That way to them he gaue forth right to pas.<br>
 Ne would endure the daunger of their might,<br>
 But wayt aduantage, when they downe did light.<br>
 At last the caytiue after long discourse,<br>
 When all his strokes he saw auoyded quite,<br>
 Resolued in one t'assemble all his force,<br>
 And make one end of him without ruth or remorse.</p><p>
 
 His dreadfull hand he heaued vp aloft,<br>
 And with his dreadfull instrument of yre,<br>
 Thought sure haue pownded him to powder soft,<br>
 Or deepe emboweld in the earth entyre:<br>
 But Fortune did not with his will conspire.<br>
 For ere his stroke attayned his intent,<br>
 The noble childe preuenting his desire,<br>
 Vnder his club with wary boldnesse went,<br>
 And smote him on the knee, that neuer yet was bent.</p><p>
 
 It neuer yet was bent, ne bent it now,<br>
 Albe the stroke so strong and puissant were,<br>
 That seem'd a marble pillour it could bow:<br>
 But all that leg, which did his body beare,<br>
 It crackt throughout, yet did no bloud appeare;<br>
 So as it was vnable to support<br>
 So huge a burden on such broken geare,<br>
 But fell to ground, like to a lumpe of durt;<br>
 Whence he assayd to rise, but could not for his hurt.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones the Prince to him full nimbly stept,<br>
 And least he should recouer foote againe,<br>
 His head meant from his shoulders to haue swept.<br>
 Which when the Lady saw, she cryde amaine;<br>
 Stay stay, Sir Knight, for loue of God abstaine,<br>
 From that vnwares ye weetlesse doe intend;<br>
 Slay not that Carle, though worthy to be slaine:<br>
 For more on him doth then him selfe depend;<br>
 My life will by his death haue lamentable end.</p><p>
 
 He staide his hand according her desire,<br>
 Yet nathemore him suffred to arize;<br>
 But still suppressing gan of her inquire,<br>
 What meaning mote those vncouth words comprize,<br>
 That in that villaines health her safety lies:<br>
 That, were no might in man, nor heart in Knights,<br>
 Which durst her dreaded reskue enterprize,<br>
 Yet heauens them selues, that fauour feeble rights,<br>
 Would for it selfe redresse, and punish such despights.</p><p>
 
 Then bursting forth in teares, which gushed fast<br>
 Like many water streames, a while she stayd;<br>
 Till the sharpe passion being ouerpast,<br>
 Her tongue to her restord, then thus she sayd;<br>
 Nor heauens, nor men can me most wretched mayd<br>
 Deliuer from the doome of my desart,<br>
 The which the God of loue hath on me layd,<br>
 And damned to endure this direfull smart,<br>
 For penaunce of my proud and hard rebellious hart.</p><p>
 
 In prime of youthly yeares, when first the flowre<br>
 Of beauty gan to bud, and bloosme delight,<br>
 And nature me endu'd with plenteous dowre,<br>
 Of all her gifts, that pleasde each liuing sight,<br>
 I was belou'd of many a gentle Knight,<br>
 And sude and sought with all the seruice dew:<br>
 Full many a one for me deepe groand and sigh't,<br>
 And to the dore of death for sorrow drew,<br>
 Complayning out on me, that would not on them rew.</p><p>
 
 But let them loue that list, or liue or die;<br>
 Me list not die for any louers doole:<br>
 Ne list me leaue my loued libertie,<br>
 To pitty him that list to play the foole:<br>
 To loue my selfe I learned had in schoole.<br>
 Thus I triumphed long in louers paine,<br>
 And sitting carelesse on the scorners stoole,<br>
 Did laugh at those that did lament and plaine:<br>
 But all is now repayd with interest againe.</p><p>
 
 For loe the winged God, that woundeth harts,<br>
 Causde me be called to accompt therefore,<br>
 And for reuengement of those wrongfull smarts,<br>
 Which I to others did inflict afore,<br>
 Addeem'd me to endure this penaunce sore;<br>
 That in this wize, and this vnmeete array,<br>
 With these two lewd companions, and no more,<br>
 <i>Disdaine</i> and <i>Scorne</i>, I through the world should stray,<br>
 Till I haue sau'd so many, as I earst did slay.</p><p>
 
 Certes (sayd then the Prince) the God is iust,<br>
 That taketh vengeaunce of his peoples spoile.<br>
 For were no law in loue, but all that lust,<br>
 Might them oppresse, and painefully turmoile,<br>
 His kingdome would continue but a while.<br>
 But tell me Lady, wherefore doe you beare<br>
 This bottle thus before you with such toile,<br>
 And eeke this wallet at your backe arreare,<br>
 That for these Carles to carry much more comely were?</p><p>
 
 Here in this bottle (sayd the sory Mayd)<br>
 I put the teares of my contrition,<br>
 Till to the brim I haue it full defrayd:<br>
 And in this bag which I behinde me don,<br>
 I put repentaunce for things past and gon.<br>
 Yet is the bottle leake, and bag so torne,<br>
 That all which I put in, fals out anon;<br>
 And is behinde me trodden downe of <i>Scorne</i>,<br>
 Who mocketh all my paine, &amp; laughs the more I mourn.</p><p>
 
 The Infant hearkned wisely to her tale,<br>
 And wondred much at <i>Cupids</i> iudg'ment wise,<br>
 That could so meekly make proud hearts auale,<br>
 And wreake him selfe on them, that him despise.<br>
 Then suffred he <i>Disdaine</i> vp to arise,<br>
 Who was not able vp him selfe to reare,<br>
 By meanes his leg through his late luckelesse prise,<br>
 Was crackt in twaine, but by his foolish feere<br>
 Was holpen vp, who him supported standing neare.</p><p>
 
 But being vp, he lookt againe aloft,<br>
 As if he neuer had receiued fall;<br>
 And with sterne eye-browes stared at him oft,<br>
 As if he would haue daunted him with all:<br>
 And standing on his tiptoes, to seeme tall,<br>
 Downe on his golden feete he often gazed,<br>
 As if such pride the other could apall;<br>
 Who was so far from being ought amazed,<br>
 That he his lookes despised, and his boast dispraized.</p><p>
 
 Then turning backe vnto that captiue thrall,<br>
 Who all this while stood there beside them bound,<br>
 Vnwilling to be knowne, or seene at all,<br>
 He from those bands weend him to haue vnwound.<br>
 But when approching neare, he plainely found,<br>
 It was his owne true groome, the gentle Squire,<br>
 He thereat wext exceedingly astound,<br>
 And him did oft embrace, and oft admire,<br>
 Ne could with seeing satisfie his great desire.</p><p>
 
 Meane while the Saluage man, when he beheld<br>
 That huge great foole oppressing th'other Knight,<br>
 Whom with his weight vnweldy downe he held,<br>
 He flew vpon him, like a greedy kight<br>
 Vnto some carrion offered to his sight,<br>
 And downe him plucking, with his nayles and teeth<br>
 Gan him to hale, and teare, and scratch, and bite;<br>
 And from him taking his owne whip, therewith<br>
 So sore him scourgeth, that the bloud downe followeth.</p><p>
 
 And sure I weene, had not the Ladies cry<br>
 Procur'd the Prince his cruell hand to stay,<br>
 He would with whipping, him haue done to dye:<br>
 But being checkt, he did abstaine streight way,<br>
 And let him rise. Then thus the Prince gan say;<br>
 Now Lady sith your fortunes thus dispose,<br>
 That if ye list haue liberty, ye may,<br>
 Vnto your selfe I freely leaue to chose,<br>
 Whether I shall you leaue, or from these villaines lose.</p><p>
 
 Ah nay Sir Knight (sayd she) it may not be,<br>
 But that I needes must by all meanes fulfill<br>
 This penaunce, which enioyned is to me,<br>
 Least vnto me betide a greater ill;<br>
 Yet no lesse thankes to you for your good will.<br>
 So humbly taking leaue, she turnd aside,<br>
 But <i>Arthure</i> with the rest, went onward still<br>
 On his first quest, in which did him betide<br>
 A great aduenture, which did him from them deuide.</p><p>
 
 But first it falleth me by course to tell<br>
 Of faire <i>Serena</i>, who as earst you heard,<br>
 When first the gentle Squire at variaunce fell<br>
 With those two Carles, fled fast away, afeard<br>
 Of villany to be to her inferd:<br>
 So fresh the image of her former dread,<br>
 Yet dwelling in her eye, to her appeard,<br>
 That euery foote did tremble, which did tread,<br>
 And euery body two, and two she foure did read.</p><p>
 
 Through hils &amp; dales, through bushes &amp; through breres<br>
 Long thus she fled, till that at last she thought<br>
 Her selfe now past the perill of her feares.<br>
 Then looking round about, and seeing nought,<br>
 Which doubt of daunger to her offer mought,<br>
 She from her palfrey lighted on the plaine,<br>
 And sitting downe, her selfe a while bethought<br>
 Of her long trauell and turmoyling paine;<br>
 And often did of loue, and oft of lucke complaine.</p><p>
 
 And euermore she blamed <i>Calepine</i>,<br>
 The good Sir <i>Calepine</i>, her owne true Knight,<br>
 As th'onely author of her wofull tine:<br>
 For being of his loue to her so light,<br>
 As her to leaue in such a piteous plight.<br>
 Yet neuer Turtle truer to his make,<br>
 Then he was tride vnto his Lady bright:<br>
 Who all this while endured for her sake,<br>
 Great perill of his life, and restlesse paines did take.</p><p>
 
 Tho when as all her plaints she had displayd,<br>
 And well disburdened her engrieued brest,<br>
 Vpon the grasse her selfe adowne she layd;<br>
 Where being tyrde with trauell, and opprest<br>
 With sorrow, she betooke her selfe to rest.<br>
 There whilest in <i>Morpheus</i> bosome safe she lay,<br>
 Fearelesse of ought, that mote her peace molest,<br>
 False Fortune did her safety betray,<br>
 Vnto a straunge mischaunce, that menac'd her decay.</p><p>
 
 In these wylde deserts, where she now abode,<br>
 There dwelt a saluage nation, which did liue<br>
 Of stealth and spoile, and making nightly rode<br>
 Into their neighbours borders; ne did giue<br>
 Them selues to any trade, as for to driue<br>
 The painefull plough, or cattell for to breed,<br>
 Or by aduentrous marchandize to thriue;<br>
 But on the labours of poore men to feed,<br>
 And serue their owne necessities with others need.</p><p>
 
 Thereto they vsde one most accursed order,<br>
 To eate the flesh of men, whom they mote fynde,<br>
 And straungers to deuoure, which on their border<br>
 Were brought by errour, or by wreckfull wynde.<br>
 A monstrous cruelty gainst course of kynde.<br>
 They towards euening wandring euery way,<br>
 To seeke for booty, came by fortune blynde,<br>
 Whereas this Lady, like a sheepe astray,<br>
 Now drowned in the depth of sleepe all fearelesse lay.</p><p>
 
 Soone as they spide her, Lord what gladfull glee<br>
 They made amongst them selues; but when her face<br>
 Like the faire yuory shining they did see,<br>
 Each gan his fellow solace and embrace,<br>
 For ioy of such good hap by heauenly grace.<br>
 Then gan they to deuize what course to take:<br>
 Whether to slay her there vpon the place,<br>
 Or suffer her out of her sleepe to wake,<br>
 And then her eate attonce; or many meales to make.</p><p>
 
 The best aduizement was of bad, to let her<br>
 Sleepe out her fill, without encomberment:<br>
 For sleepe they sayd would make her battill better.<br>
 Then when she wakt, they all gaue one consent,<br>
 That since by grace of God she there was sent,<br>
 Vnto their God they would her sacrifize,<br>
 Whose share, her guiltlesse bloud they would present,<br>
 But of her dainty flesh they did deuize<br>
 To make a common feast, &amp; feed with gurmandize.</p><p>
 
 So round about her they them selues did place<br>
 Vpon the grasse, and diuersely dispose,<br>
 As each thought best to spend the lingring space.<br>
 Some with their eyes the daintest morsels chose;<br>
 Some praise her paps, some praise her lips and nose;<br>
 Some whet their kniues, and strip their elboes bare:<br>
 The Priest him selfe a garland doth compose<br>
 Of finest flowres, and with full busie care<br>
 His bloudy vessels wash, and holy fire prepare.</p><p>
 
 The Damzell wakes, then all attonce vpstart,<br>
 And round about her flocke, like many flies,<br>
 Whooping, and hallowing on euery part,<br>
 As if they would haue rent the brasen skies.<br>
 Which when she sees with ghastly griefful eies,<br>
 Her heart does quake, and deadly pallid hew<br>
 Benumbes her cheekes: Then out aloud she cries,<br>
 Where none is nigh to heare, that will her rew,<br>
 And rends her golden locks, and snowy brests embrew.</p><p>
 
 But all bootes not: they hands vpon her lay;<br>
 And first they spoile her of her iewels deare,<br>
 And afterwards of all her rich array;<br>
 The which amongst them they in peeces teare,<br>
 And of the pray each one a part doth beare.<br>
 Now being naked, to their sordid eyes<br>
 The goodly threasures of nature appeare:<br>
 Which as they view with lustfull fantasyes,<br>
 Each wisheth to him selfe, and to the rest enuyes.</p><p>
 
 Her yuorie necke, her alablaster brest,<br>
 Her paps, which like white silken pillowes were,<br>
 For loue in soft delight thereon to rest;<br>
 Her tender sides, her bellie white and clere,<br>
 Which like an Altar did it selfe vprere,<br>
 To offer sacrifice diuine thereon;<br>
 Her goodly thighes, whose glorie did appeare<br>
 Like a triumphall Arch, and thereupon<br>
 The spoiles of Princes hang'd, which were in battel won.</p><p>
 
 Those daintie parts, the dearlings of delight,<br>
 Which mote not be prophan'd of common eyes,<br>
 Those villeins vew'd with loose lasciuious sight,<br>
 And closely tempted with their craftie spyes;<br>
 And some of them gan mongst themselues deuize,<br>
 Thereof by force to take their beastly pleasure.<br>
 But them the Priest rebuking, did aduize<br>
 To dare not to pollute so sacred threasure,<br>
 Vow'd to the gods: religiõ held euen theeues in measure.</p><p>
 
 So being stayd, they her from thence directed<br>
 Vnto a litle groue not farre asyde,<br>
 In which an altar shortly they erected,<br>
 To slay her on. And now the Euentyde<br>
 His brode black wings had through the heauens wyde<br>
 By this dispred, that was the tyme ordayned<br>
 For such a dismall deed, their guilt to hyde:<br>
 Of few greene turfes an altar soone they fayned,<br>
 And deckt it all with flowres, which they nigh hand obtayned.</p><p>
 
 Tho when as all things readie were aright,<br>
 The Damzell was before the altar set,<br>
 Being alreadie dead with fearefull fright.<br>
 To whom the Priest with naked armes full net<br>
 Approching nigh, and murdrous knife well whet,<br>
 Gan mutter close a certaine secret charme,<br>
 With other diuelish ceremonies met:<br>
 Which doen he gan aloft t'aduance his arme,<br>
 Whereat they shouted all, and made a loud alarme.</p><p>
 
 Then gan the bagpypes and the hornes to shrill,<br>
 And shrieke aloud, that with the peoples voyce<br>
 Confused, did the ayre with terror fill,<br>
 And made the wood to tremble at the noyce:<br>
 The whyles she wayld, the more they did reioyce.<br>
 Now mote ye vnderstand that to this groue<br>
 Sir <i>Calepine</i> by chaunce, more then by choyce,<br>
 The selfe same euening fortune hether droue,<br>
 As he to seeke <i>Serena</i> through the woods did roue.</p><p>
 
 Long had he sought her, and through many a soyle<br>
 Had traueld still on foot in heauie armes,<br>
 Ne ought was tyred with his endlesse toyles,<br>
 Ne ought was feared of his certaine harmes:<br>
 And now all weetlesse of the wretched stormes,<br>
 In which his loue was lost, he slept full fast,<br>
 Till being waked with these loud alarmes,<br>
 He lightly started vp like one aghast,<br>
 And catching vp his arms streight to the noise forth past.</p><p>
 
 There by th'vncertaine glimse of starry night,<br>
 And by the twinkling of their sacred fire,<br>
 He mote perceiue a litle dawning sight<br>
 Of all, which there was doing in that quire:<br>
 Mongst whom a woman spoyld of all attire<br>
 He spyde, lamenting her vnluckie strife,<br>
 And groning sore from grieued hart entire,<br>
 Eftsoones he saw one with a naked knife<br>
 Readie to launce her brest, and let out loued life.</p><p>
 
 With that he thrusts into the thickest throng,<br>
 And euen as his right hand adowne descends,<br>
 He him preuenting, layes on earth along,<br>
 And sacrifizeth to th'infernall feends.<br>
 Then to the rest his wrathfull hand he bends,<br>
 Of whom he makes such hauocke and such hew,<br>
 That swarmes of damned soules to hell he sends:<br>
 The rest that scape his sword and death eschew,<br>
 Fly like a flocke of doues before a Faulcons vew.</p><p>
 
 From them returning to that Ladie backe,<br>
 Whom by the Altar he doth sitting find,<br>
 Yet fearing death, and next to death the lacke<br>
 Of clothes to couer, what they ought by kind:<br>
 He first her hands beginneth to vnbind,<br>
 And then to question of her present woe;<br>
 And afterwards to cheare with speaches kind.<br>
 But she for nought that he could say or doe,<br>
 One word durst speake, or answere him a whit thereto.</p><p>
 
 So inward shame of her vncomely case<br>
 She did conceiue, through care of womanhood,<br>
 That though the night did couer her disgrace,<br>
 Yet she in so vnwomanly a mood,<br>
 Would not bewray the state in which she stood.<br>
 So all that night to him vnknowen she past.<br>
 But day, that doth discouer bad and good,<br>
 Ensewing, made her knowen to him at last:<br>
 The end whereof Ile keepe vntill another cast.</p><p>
