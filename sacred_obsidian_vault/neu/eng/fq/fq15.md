 </p><blockquote> 
 
  
 <i>Babes bloudie hands may not be clensd,<br>
 the face of golden Meane.<br>
 Her sisters two Extremities:<br>
 striue her to banish cleane.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote> 
 
  
 <p>
 </p><blockquote> 
 T
 Hus when Sir <i>Guyon</i> with his faithfull guide<br>
 Had with due rites and dolorous lament<br>
 The end of their sad Tragedie vptyde,<br>
 The little babe vp in his armes he hent;<br>
 Who with sweet pleasance and bold blandishment<br>
 Gan smyle on them, that rather ought to weepe,<br>
 As carelesse of his woe, or innocent<br>
 Of that was doen, that ruth emperced deepe<br>
 In that knights heart, and wordes with bitter teares did steepe.<p>
  
 Ah lucklesse babe, borne vnder cruell starre,<br>
 And in dead parents balefull ashes bred,<br>
 Full litle weenest thou, what sorrowes are<br>
 Left thee for portion of thy liuelihed,<br>
 Poore Orphane in the wide world scattered,<br>
 As budding braunch rent from the natiue tree,<br>
 And throwen forth, till it be withered:<br>
 Such is the state of men: thus enter wee<br>
 Into this life with woe, and end with miseree.</p><p>
  
 Then soft himselfe inclyning on his knee<br>
 Downe to that well, did in the water weene<br>
 (So loue does loath disdainfull nicitee)<br>
 His guiltie hands from bloudie gore to cleene,<br>
 He washt them oft and oft, yet nought they beene<br>
 For all his washing cleaner. Still he stroue,<br>
 Yet still the litle hands were bloudie seene;<br>
 The which him into great amaz'ment droue,<br>
 And into diuerse doubt his wauering wonder cloue.</p><p>
  
 He wist not whether blot of foule offence<br>
 Might not be purgd with water nor with bath;<br>
 Or that high God, in lieu of innocence,<br>
 Imprinted had that token of his wrath,<br>
 To shew how sore bloudguiltinesse he hat'th;<br>
 Or that the charme and venim, which they druncke,<br>
 Their bloud with secret filth infected hath,<br>
 Being diffused through the senselesse truncke,<br>
 That through the great contagion direfull deadly stunck.</p><p>
  
 Whom thus at gaze, the Palmer gan to bord<br>
 With goodly reason, and thus faire bespake;<br>
 Ye bene right hard amated, gratious Lord,<br>
 And of your ignorance great maruell make,<br>
 Whiles cause not well conceiued ye mistake.<br>
 But know, that secret vertues are infusd<br>
 In euery fountaine, and in euery lake,<br>
 Which who hath skill them rightly to haue chusd,<br>
 To proofe of passing wonders hath full often vsd.</p><p>
  
 Of those some were so from their sourse indewd<br>
 By great Dame Nature, from whose fruitfull pap<br>
 Their welheads spring, and are with moisture dewd;<br>
 Which feedes each liuing plant with liquid sap,<br>
 And filles with flowres faire <i>Floraes</i> painted lap:<br>
 But other some by gift of later grace,<br>
 Or by good prayers, or by other hap,<br>
 Had vertue pourd into their waters bace,<br>
 And thenceforth were renowmd, &amp; sought from place to place.</p><p>
  
 Such is this well, wrought by occasion straunge,<br>
 Which to her Nymph befell. Vpon a day,<br>
 As she the woods with bow and shafts did raunge,<br>
 The hartlesse Hind and Robucke to dismay,<br>
 <i>Dan Faunus</i> chaunst to meet her by the way,<br>
 And kindling fire at her faire burning eye,<br>
 Inflamed was to follow beauties chace,<br>
 And chaced her, that fast from him did fly;<br>
 As Hind from her, so she fled from her enimy.</p><p>
  
 At last when fayling breath began to faint,<br>
 And saw no meanes to scape, of shame affrayd,<br>
 She set her downe to weepe for sore constraint,<br>
 And to <i>Diana</i> calling lowd for ayde,<br>
 Her deare besought, to let her dye a mayd.<br>
 The goddesse heard, and suddeine where she sate,<br>
 Welling out streames of teares, and quite dismayd<br>
 With stony feare of that rude rustick mate,<br>
 Transformd her to a stone from stedfast virgins state.</p><p>
  
 Lo now she is that stone, from whose two heads,<br>
 As from two weeping eyes, fresh streames do flow,<br>
 Yet cold through feare, and old conceiued dreads;<br>
 And yet the stone her semblance seemes to show,<br>
 Shapt like a maid, that such ye may her know;<br>
 And yet her vertues in her water byde:<br>
 For it is chast and pure, as purest snow,<br>
 Ne lets her waues with any filth be dyde,<br>
 But euer like her selfe vnstained hath beene tryde.</p><p>
  
 From thence it comes, that this babes bloudy hand<br>
 May not be clensd with water of this well:<br>
 Ne certes Sir striue you it to withstand,<br>
 But let them still be bloudy, as befell,<br>
 That they his mothers innocence may tell,<br>
 As she bequeathd in her last testament;<br>
 That as a sacred Symbole it may dwell<br>
 In her sonnes flesh, to minde reuengement,<br>
 And be for all chast Dames an endlesse moniment.</p><p>
  
 He hearkned to his reason, and the childe<br>
 Vptaking, to the Palmer gaue to beare;<br>
 But his sad fathers armes with bloud defilde,<br>
 An heauie load himselfe did lightly reare,<br>
 And turning to that place, in which whyleare<br>
 He left his loftie steed with golden sell,<br>
 And goodly gorgeous barbes, him found not theare.<br>
 By other accident that earst befell,<br>
 He is conuaide, but how or where, here fits not tell.</p><p>
  
 Which when Sir <i>Guyon</i> saw, all were he wroth,<br>
 Yet algates mote he soft himselfe appease,<br>
 And fairely fare on foot, how euer loth;<br>
 His double burden did him sore disease.<br>
 So long they traueiled with litle ease,<br>
 Till that at last they to a Castle came,<br>
 Built on a rocke adioyning to the seas:<br>
 It was an auncient worke of antique fame,<br>
 And wondrous strong by nature, and by skilfull frame.</p><p>
  
 Therein three sisters dwelt of sundry sort,<br>
 The children of one sire by mothers three;<br>
 Who dying whylome did diuide this fort<br>
 To them by equall shares in equall fee:<br>
 But strifull minde, and diuerse qualitee<br>
 Drew them in parts, and each made others foe;<br>
 Still did they striue, and dayly disagree;<br>
 The eldest did against the youngest goe,<br>
 And both against the middest meant to worken woe.</p><p>
  
 Where when the knight arriu'd, he was right well<br>
 Receiu'd, as knight of so much worth became,<br>
 Of second sister, who did far excell<br>
 The other two; <i>Medina</i> was her name,<br>
 A sober sad, and comely curteous Dame;<br>
 Who rich arayd, and yet in modest guize,<br>
 In goodly garments, that her well became,<br>
 Faire marching forth in honorable wize,<br>
 Him at the threshold met, and well did enterprize.</p><p>
  
 She led him vp into a goodly bowre,<br>
 And comely courted with meet modestie,<br>
 Ne in her speach, ne in her hauiour,<br>
 Was lightnesse seene, or looser vanitie,<br>
 But gratious womanhood, and grauitie,<br>
 Aboue the reason of her youthly yeares:<br>
 Her golden lockes she roundly did vptye<br>
 In breaded tramels, that no looser heares<br>
 Did out of order stray about her daintie eares.</p><p>
  
 Whilest she her selfe thus busily did frame,<br>
 Seemely to entertaine her new-come guest,<br>
 Newes hereof to her other sisters came,<br>
 Who all this while were at their wanton rest,<br>
 Accourting each her friend with lauish fest:<br>
 They were two knights of perelesse puissance,<br>
 And famous far abroad for warlike gest,<br>
 Which to these Ladies loue did countenaunce,<br>
 And to his mistresse each himselfe stroue to aduaunce.</p><p>
  
 He that made loue vnto the eldest Dame,<br>
 Was hight Sir <i>Huddibras</i>, an hardy man;<br>
 Yet not so good of deedes, as great of name,<br>
 Which he by many rash aduentures wan,<br>
 Since errant armes to sew he first began;<br>
 More huge in strength, then wise in workes he was,<br>
 And reason with foole-hardize ouer ran;<br>
 Sterne melancholy did his courage pas,<br>
 And was for terrour more, all armd in shyning bras.</p><p>
  
 But he that lou'd the youngest, was <i>Sans-loy</i>,<br>
 He that faire <i>Vna</i> late fowle outraged,<br>
 The most vnruly, and the boldest boy,<br>
 That euer warlike weapons menaged,<br>
 And to all lawlesse lust encouraged,<br>
 Through strong opinion of his matchlesse might:<br>
 Ne ought he car'd, whom he endamaged<br>
 By tortious wrong, or whom bereau'd of right.<br>
 He now this Ladies champion chose for loue to fight.</p><p>
  
 These two gay knights, vowd to so diuerse loues,<br>
 Each other does enuie with deadly hate,<br>
 And dayly warre against his foeman moues,<br>
 In hope to win more fauour with his mate,<br>
 And th'others pleasing seruice to abate,<br>
 To magnifie his owne.  But when they heard,<br>
 How in that place straunge knight arriued late,<br>
 Both knights and Ladies forth right angry far'd,<br>
 And fiercely vnto battell sterne themselues prepar'd.</p><p>
  
 But ere they could proceede vnto the place,<br>
 Where he abode, themselues at discord fell,<br>
 And cruell combat ioynd in middle space:<br>
 With horrible assault, and furie fell,<br>
 They heapt huge strokes, the scorned life to quell,<br>
 That all on vprore from her settled seat<br>
 The house was raysd, and all that in did dwell;<br>
 Seemd that lowde thunder with amazement great<br>
 Did rend the ratling skyes with flames of fouldring heat.</p><p>
  
 The noyse thereof calth forth that straunger knight,<br>
 To weet, what dreadfull thing was there in hand;<br>
 Where when as two braue knights in bloudy fight<br>
 With deadly rancour he enraunged fond,<br>
 His sunbroad shield about his wrest he bond,<br>
 And shyning blade vnsheathd, with which he ran<br>
 Vnto that stead, their strife to vnderstond;<br>
 And at his first arriuall, them began<br>
 With goodly meanes to pacifie, well as he can.</p><p>
  
 But they him spying, both with greedy forse<br>
 Attonce vpon him ran, and him beset<br>
 With strokes of mortall steele without remorse,<br>
 And on his shield like yron sledges bet:<br>
 As when a Beare and Tygre being met<br>
 In cruell fight on lybicke Ocean wide,<br>
 Espye a traueiler with feet surbet,<br>
 Whom they in equall pray hope to deuide,<br>
 They stint their strife, and him assaile on euery side.</p><p>
  
 But he, not like a wearie traueilere,<br>
 Their sharpe assault right boldly did rebut,<br>
 And suffred not their blowes to byte him nere<br>
 But with redoubled buffes them backe did put:<br>
 Whose grieued mindes, which choler did englut,<br>
 Against themselues turning their wrathfull spight,<br>
 Gan with new rage their shields to hew and cut;<br>
 But still when <i>Guyon</i> came to part their fight,<br>
 With heauie load on him they freshly gan to smight.</p><p>
  
 As a tall ship tossed in troublous seas,<br>
 Whom raging windes threatning to make the pray<br>
 Of the rough rockes, do diuersly disease,<br>
 Meetes two contrary billowes by the way,<br>
 That her on either side do sore assay,<br>
 And boast to swallow her in greedy graue;<br>
 She scorning both their spights, does make wide way,<br>
 And with her brest breaking the fomy waue,<br>
 Does ride on both their backs, &amp; faire her selfe doth saue.</p><p>
  
 So boldly he him beares, and rusheth forth<br>
 Betweene them both, by conduct of his blade.<br>
 Wondrous great prowesse and heroick worth<br>
 He shewd that day, and rare ensample made,<br>
 When two so mighty warriours he dismade:<br>
 Attonce he wards and strikes, he takes and payes,<br>
 Now forst to yield, now forcing to inuade,<br>
 Before, behind, and round about him layes:<br>
 So double was his paines, so double be his prayse.</p><p>
  
 Straunge sort of fight, three valiaunt knights to see<br>
 Three combats ioyne in one, and to darraine<br>
 A triple warre with triple enmitee,<br>
 All for their Ladies froward loue to gaine,<br>
 Which gotten was but hate. So loue does raine<br>
 In stoutest minds, and maketh monstrous warre;<br>
 He maketh warre, he maketh peace againe,<br>
 And yet his peace is but continuall iarre:<br>
 O miserable men, that to him subiect arre.</p><p>
  
 Whilst thus they mingled were in furious armes,<br>
 The faire <i>Medina</i> with her tresses torne,<br>
 And naked brest, in pitty of their harmes,<br>
 Emongst them ran, and falling them beforne,<br>
 Besought them by the womb, which them had borne,<br>
 And by the loues, which were to them most deare,<br>
 And by the knighthood, which they sure had sworne,<br>
 Their deadly cruell discord to forbeare,<br>
 And to her iust conditions of faire peace to heare.</p><p>
  
 But her two other sisters standing by,<br>
 Her lowd gainsaid, and both their champions bad<br>
 Pursew the end of their strong enmity,<br>
 As euer of their loues they would be glad.<br>
 Yet she with pitthy words and counsell sad,<br>
 Still stroue their stubborne rages to reuoke,<br>
 That at the last suppressing fury mad,<br>
 They gan abstaine from dint of direfull stroke,<br>
 And hearken to the sober speaches, which she spoke.</p><p>
  
 Ah puissaunt Lords, what cursed euill Spright,<br>
 Or fell <i>Erinnys</i>, in your noble harts<br>
 Her hellish brond hath kindled with despight,<br>
 And stird you vp to worke your wilfull smarts?<br>
 Is this the ioy of armes? be these the parts<br>
 Of glorious knighthood, after bloud to thrust,<br>
 And not regard dew right and iust desarts?<br>
 Vaine is the vaunt, and victory vniust,<br>
 That more to mighty hãds, thẽ rightfull cause doth trust.</p><p>
  
 And were there rightfull cause of difference,<br>
 Yet were not better, faire it to accord,<br>
 Then with bloud guiltinesse to heape offence,<br>
 And mortall vengeaunce ioyne to crime abhord?<br>
 O fly from wrath, fly, O my liefest Lord:<br>
 Sad be the sights, and bitter fruits of warre,<br>
 And thousand furies wait on wrathfull sword;<br>
 Ne ought the prayse of prowesse more doth marre,<br>
 Then fowle reuenging rage, and base contentious iarre.</p><p>
  
 But louely concord, and most sacred peace<br>
 Doth nourish vertue, and fast friendship breeds;<br>
 Weake she makes strõg, &amp; strõg thing does increace,<br>
 Till it the pitch of highest prayse exceeds:<br>
 Braue be her warres, and honorable deeds,<br>
 By which she triumphes ouer ire and pride,<br>
 And winnes an Oliue girlond for her meeds:<br>
 Be therefore, O my deare Lords, pacifide,<br>
 And this misseeming discord meekely lay aside.</p><p>
  
 Her gracious words their rancour did appall,<br>
 And suncke so deepe into their boyling brests,<br>
 That downe they let their cruell weapons fall,<br>
 And lowly did abase their loftie crests<br>
 To her faire presence, and discrete behests.<br>
 Then she began a treatie to procure,<br>
 And stablish termes betwixt both their requests,<br>
 That as a law for euer should endure;<br>
 Which to obserue in word of knights they did assure.</p><p>
  
 Which to confirme, and fast to bind their league,<br>
 After their wearie sweat and bloudy toile,<br>
 She them besought, during their quiet treague,<br>
 Into her lodging to repaire a while,<br>
 To rest themselues, and grace to reconcile.<br>
 They soone consent: so forth with her they fare,<br>
 Where they are well receiu'd, and made to spoile<br>
 Themselues of soiled armes, and to prepare<br>
 Their minds to pleasure, &amp; their mouthes to dainty fare.</p><p>
  
 And those two froward sisters, their faire loues<br>
 Came with them eke, all were they wondrous loth,<br>
 And fained cheare, as for the time behoues,<br>
 But could not colour yet so well the troth,<br>
 But that their natures bad appeard in both:<br>
 For both did at their second sister grutch,<br>
 And inly grieue, as doth an hidden moth<br>
 The inner garment fret, not th'vtter touch;<br>
 One thought their cheare too litle, th'other thought too mutch.</p><p>
  
 <i>Elissa</i> (so the eldest hight) did deeme<br>
 Such entertainment base, ne ought would eat,<br>
 Ne ought would speake, but euermore did seeme<br>
 As discontent for want of merth or meat;<br>
 No solace could her Paramour intreat,<br>
 Her once to show, ne court, nor dalliance,<br>
 But with bent lowring browes, as she would threat,<br>
 She scould, and frownd with froward countenaunce,<br>
 Vnworthy of faire Ladies comely gouernaunce.</p><p>
  
 But young <i>Perissa</i> was of other mind,<br>
 Full of disport, still laughing, loosely light,<br>
 And quite contrary to her sisters kind;<br>
 No measure in her mood, no rule of right,<br>
 But poured out in pleasure and delight;<br>
 In wine and meats she flowd aboue the bancke,<br>
 And in excesse exceeded her owne might;<br>
 In sumptuous tire she ioyd her selfe to prancke,<br>
 But of her loue too lauish (litle haue she thancke.)</p><p>
  
 Fast by her side did sit the bold <i>Sans-loy</i><br>
 Fit mate for such a mincing mineon,<br>
 Who in her loosenesse tooke exceeding ioy;<br>
 Might not be found a franker franion,<br>
 Of her lewd parts to make companion;<br>
 But <i>Huddibras</i>, more like a Malecontent,<br>
 Did see and grieue at his bold fashion;<br>
 Hardly could he endure his hardiment,<br>
 Yet still he sat, and inly did him selfe torment.</p><p>
  
 Betwixt them both the faire <i>Medina</i> sate<br>
 With sober grace, and goodly carriage:<br>
 With equall measure she did moderate<br>
 The strong extremities of their outrage;<br>
 That forward paire she euer would asswage,<br>
 When they would striue dew reason to exceed;<br>
 But that same froward twaine would accourage,<br>
 And of her plenty adde vnto their need:<br>
 So kept she them in order, and her selfe in heed.</p><p>
  
 Thus fairely she attempered her feast,<br>
 And pleasd them all with meete satietie,<br>
 At last when lust of meat and drinke was ceast,<br>
 She <i>Guyon</i> deare besought of curtesie,<br>
 To tell from whence he came through ieopardie,<br>
 And whither now on new aduenture bound.<br>
 Who with bold grace, and comely grauitie,<br>
 Drawing to him the eyes of all around,<br>
 From lofty siege began these words aloud to sound.</p><p>
  
 This thy demaund, ô Lady, doth reuiue<br>
 Fresh memory in me of that great Queene,<br>
 Great and most glorious virgin Queene aliue,<br>
 That with her soueraigne powre, and scepter shene<br>
 All Faery lond does peaceable sustene.<br>
 In widest Ocean she her throne does reare,<br>
 That ouer all the earth it may be seene;<br>
 As morning Sunne her beames dispredden cleare,<br>
 And in her face faire peace, and mercy doth appeare.</p><p>
  
 In her the richesse of all heauenly grace<br>
 In chiefe degree are heaped vp on hye:<br>
 And all that else this worlds enclosure bace,<br>
 Hath great or glorious in mortall eye.<br>
 Adornes the person of her Maiestie;<br>
 That men beholding so great excellence,<br>
 And rare perfection in mortalitie,<br>
 Do her adore with sacred reuerence,<br>
 As th'Idole of her makers great magnificence.</p><p>
  
 To her I homage and my seruice owe,<br>
 In number of the noblest knights on ground,<br>
 Mongst whom on me she deigned to bestowe<br>
 Order of <i>Maydenhead</i>, the most renownd,<br>
 That may this day in all the world be found:<br>
 An yearely solemne feast she wontes to make<br>
 The day that first doth lead the yeare around;<br>
 To which all knights of worth and courage bold<br>
 Resort, to heare of straunge aduentures to be told.</p><p>
  
 There this old Palmer shewed himselfe that day,<br>
 And to that mighty Princesse did complaine<br>
 Of grieuous mischiefes, which a wicked Fay<br>
 Had wrought, and many whelmd in deadly paine,<br>
 Whereof he crau'd redresse.  My Soueraine,<br>
 Whose glory is in gracious deeds, and ioyes<br>
 Throughout the world her mercy to maintaine,<br>
 Eftsoones deuisd redresse for such annoyes;<br>
 Me all vnfit for so great purpose she employes.</p><p>
  
 Now hath faire <i>Phoebe</i> with her siluer face<br>
 Thrise seene the shadowes of the neather world,<br>
 Sith last I left that honorable place,<br>
 In which her royall presence is introld;<br>
 Ne euer shall I rest in house nor hold,<br>
 Till I that false <i>Acrasia</i> haue wonne;<br>
 Of whose fowle deedes, too hideous to be told<br>
 I witnesse am, and this their wretched sonne,<br>
 Whose wofull parents she hath wickedly fordonne.</p><p>
  
 Tell on, faire Sir, said she, that dolefull tale,<br>
 From which sad ruth does seeme you to restraine,<br>
 That we may pitty such vnhappy bale,<br>
 And learne from pleasures poyson to abstaine:<br>
 Ill by ensample good doth often gayne.<br>
 Then forward he his purpose gan pursew,<br>
 And told the storie of the mortall payne,<br>
 Which <i>Mordant</i> and <i>Amauia</i> did rew;<br>
 As with lamenting eyes him selfe did lately vew.</p><p>
  
 Night was far spent, and now in <i>Ocean</i> deepe<br>
 <i>Orion</i>, flying fast from hissing snake,<br>
 His flaming head did hasten for to steepe,<br>
 When of his pitteous tale he end did make;<br>
 Whilest with delight of that he wisely spake,<br>
 Those guestes beguiled, did beguile their eyes<br>
 Of kindly sleepe, that did them ouertake.<br>
 At last when they had markt the chaunged skyes,<br>
 They wist their houre was spẽt; thẽ each to rest him hyes.</p><p>
