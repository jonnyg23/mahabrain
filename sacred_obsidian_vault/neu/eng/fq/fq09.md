 </p><blockquote> 
  
  
 <i>Faire virgin to redeeme her deare<br> 
 brings Arthur to the fight,<br>  
 Who slayes the Gyant, wounds the beast,<br> 
 and strips Duessa quight. </i><p> 
 </p></blockquote> 
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>     
 AY me, how many perils doe enfold<br>
 The righteous man, to make him daily fall?<br>
 Were not, that heauenly grace doth him vphold,<br>
 And stedfast truth acquite him out of all.<br>
 Her loue is firme, her care continuall,<br>
 So oft as he through his owne foolish pride,<br>
 Or weaknesse is to sinfull bands made thrall:<br>
 Else should this <i>Redcrosse</i> knight in bands haue dyde,<br>
 For whose deliuerãce she this Prince doth thither guide.<p>
  
 They sadly traueild thus, vntill they came<br>
 Nigh to a castle builded strong and hie:<br>
 Then cryde the Dwarfe, lo yonder is the same,<br>
 In which my Lord my liege doth lucklesse lie,<br>
 Thrall to that Gyants hatefull tyrannie:<br>
 Therefore, deare Sir, your mightie powres assay.<br>
 The noble knight alighted by and by<br>
 From loftie steede, and bad the Ladie stay,<br>
 To see what end of fight should him befall that day.</p><p>
  
 So with the Squire, th'admirer of his might,<br>
 He marched forth towards that castle wall;<br>
 Whose gates he found fast shut, ne liuing wight<br>
 To ward the same, nor answere commers call.<br>
 Then tooke that Squire an horne of bugle small,<br>
 Which hong adowne his side in twisted gold,<br>
 And tassels gay. Wyde wonders ouer all<br>
 Of that same hornes great vertues weren told,<br>
 Which had approued bene in vses manifold.</p><p>
  
 Was neuer wight, that heard that shrilling sound,<br>
 But trembling feare did feele in euery vaine;<br>
 Three miles it might be easie heard around,<br>
 And Ecchoes three answerd it selfe againe:<br>
 No false enchauntment, nor deceiptfull traine<br>
 Might once abide the terror of that blast,<br>
 But presently was voide and wholly vaine:<br>
 No gate so strong, no locke so firme and fast,<br>
 But with that percing noise flew open quite, or brast.</p><p>
  
 The same before the Geants gate he blew,<br>
 That all the castle quaked from the ground,<br>
 And euery dore of freewill open flew.<br>
 The Gyant selfe dismaied with that sownd,<br>
 Where he with his <i>Duessa</i> dalliance fownd,<br>
 In hast came rushing forth from inner bowre,<br>
 With staring countenance sterne, as one astownd,<br>
 And staggering steps, to weet, what suddein stowre<br>
 Had wrought that horror strange, and dar'd his dreaded powre.</p><p>
  
 And after him the proud <i>Duessa</i> came,<br>
 High mounted on her manyheaded beast,<br>
 And euery head with fyrie tongue did flame,<br>
 And euery head was crowned on his creast,<br>
 And bloudie mouthed with late cruell feast.<br>
 That when the knight beheld, his mightie shild<br>
 Vpon his manly arme he soone addrest,<br>
 And at him fiercely flew, with courage fild,<br>
 And eger greedinesse through euery member thrild.</p><p>
  
 Therewith the Gyant buckled him to fight,<br>
 Inflam'd with scornefull wrath and high disdaine,<br>
 And lifting vp his dreadfull club on hight,<br>
 All arm'd with ragged snubbes and knottie graine,<br>
 Him thought at first encounter to haue slaine,<br>
 But wise and warie was that noble Pere,<br>
 And lightly leaping from so monstrous maine,<br>
 Did faire auoide the violence him nere;<br>
 It booted nought, to thinke, such thunderbolts to beare.</p><p>
  
 Ne shame he thought to shunne so hideous might:<br>
 The idle stroke, enforcing furious way,<br>
 Missing the marke of his misaymed sight<br>
 Did fall to ground, and with his heauie sway<br>
 So deepely dinted in the driuen clay,<br>
 That three yardes deepe a furrow vp did throw:<br>
 The sad earth wounded with so sore assay,<br>
 Did grone full grieuous vnderneath the blow,<br>
 And trembling with strange feare, did like an earthquake show.</p><p>
  
 As when almightie <i>Ioue</i> in wrathfull mood,<br>
 To wreake the guilt of mortall sins is bent,<br>
 Hurles forth his thundring dart with deadly food,<br>
 Enrold in flames, and smouldring dreriment,<br>
 Through riuen cloudes and molten firmament;<br>
 The fierce threeforked engin making way,<br>
 Both loftie towres and highest trees hath rent,<br>
 And all that might his angrie passage stay,<br>
 And shooting in the earth, casts vp a mount of clay.</p><p>
  
 His boystrous club, so buried in the ground,<br>
 He could not rearen vp againe so light,<br>
 But that the knight him at auantage found,<br>
 And whiles he stroue his combred clubbe to quight<br>
 Out of the earth, with blade all burning bright<br>
 He smote off his left arme, which like a blocke<br>
 Did fall to ground, depriu'd of natiue might;<br>
 Large streames of bloud out of the truncked stocke<br>
 Forth gushed, like fresh water streame from riuen rocke.</p><p>
  
 Dismaied with so desperate deadly wound,<br>
 And eke impatient of vnwonted paine,<br>
 He loudly brayd with beastly yelling sound,<br>
 That all the fields rebellowed againe;<br>
 As great a noyse, as when in Cymbrian plaine<br>
 An heard of Bulles, whom kindly rage doth sting,<br>
 Do for the milkie mothers want complaine,<br>
 And fill the fields with troublous bellowing,<br>
 The neighbour woods around with hollow murmur ring.</p><p>
  
 That when his deare <i>Duessa</i> heard, and saw<br>
 The euill stownd, that daungerd her estate,<br>
 Vnto his aide she hastily did draw<br>
 Her dreadfull beast, who swolne with bloud of late<br>
 Came ramping forth with proud presumpteous gate,<br>
 And threatned all his heads like flaming brands.<br>
 But him the Squire made quickly to retrate,<br>
 Encountring fierce with single sword in hand,<br>
 And twixt him and his Lord did like a bulwarke stand.</p><p>
  
 The proud <i>Duessa</i> full of wrathfull spight,<br>
 And fierce disdaine, to be affronted so,<br>
 Enforst her purple beast with all her might<br>
 That stop out of the way to ouerthroe,<br>
 Scorning the let of so vnequall foe:<br>
 But nathemore would that courageous swayne<br>
 To her yeeld passage, gainst his Lord to goe,<br>
 But with outrageous strokes did him restraine,<br>
 And with his bodie bard the way atwixt them twaine.</p><p>
  
 Then tooke the angrie witch her golden cup,<br>
 Which still she bore, replete with magick artes;<br>
 Death and despeyre did many thereof sup,<br>
 And secret poyson through their inner parts,<br>
 Th'eternall bale of heauie wounded harts;<br>
 Which after charmes and some enchauntments said,<br>
 She lightly sprinkled on his weaker parts;<br>
 Therewith his sturdie courage soone was quayd,<br>
 And all his senses were with suddeine dread dismayd.</p><p>
  
 So downe he fell before the cruell beast,<br>
 Who on his necke his bloudie clawes did seize,<br>
 That life nigh crusht out of his panting brest:<br>
 No powre he had to stirre, nor will to rize.<br>
 That when the carefull knight gan well auise,<br>
 He lightly left the foe, with whom he fought,<br>
 And to the beast gan turne his enterprise;<br>
 For wondrous anguish in his hart it wrought,<br>
 To see his loued Squire into such thraldome brought.</p><p>
  
 And high aduauncing his bloud-thirstie blade,<br>
 Stroke one of those deformed heads so sore,<br>
 That of his puissance proud ensample made;<br>
 His monstrous scalpe downe to his teeth it tore,<br>
 And that misformed shape mis-shaped more:<br>
 A sea of bloud gusht from the gaping wound,<br>
 That her gay garments staynd with filthy gore,<br>
 And ouerflowed all the field around;<br>
 That ouer shoes in bloud he waded on the ground.</p><p>
  
 Thereat he roared for exceeding paine,<br>
 That to haue heard, great horror would haue bred,<br>
 And scourging th'emptie ayre with his long traine,<br>
 Through great impatience of his grieued hed<br>
 His gorgeous ryder from her loftie sted<br>
 Would haue cast downe, and trod in durtie myre,<br>
 Had not the Gyant soone her succoured;<br>
 Who all enrag'd with smart and franticke yre,<br>
 Came hurtling in full fierce, and forst the knight retyre.</p><p>
  
 The force, which wont in two to be disperst,<br>
 In one alone left hand he now vnites,<br>
 Which is through rage more strong then both were erst;<br>
 With which his hideous club aloft he dites,<br>
 And at his foe with furious rigour smites,<br>
 That strongest Oake might seeme to ouerthrow.<br>
 The stroke vpon his shield so heauie lites,<br>
 That to the ground it doubleth him full low<br>
 What mortall wight could euer beare so monstrous blow?</p><p>
  
 And in his fall his shield, that couered was,<br>
 Did loose his vele by chaunce, and open flew:<br>
 The light whereof, that heauens light did pas,<br>
 Such blazing brightnesse through the aier threw,<br>
 That eye mote not the same endure to vew.<br>
 Which when the Gyaunt spyde with staring eye,<br>
 He downe let fall his arme, and soft withdrew<br>
 His weapon huge, that heaued was on hye<br>
 For to haue slaine the man, that on the ground did lye.</p><p>
  
 And eke the fruitfull-headed beast, amaz'd<br>
 At flashing beames of that sunshiny shield,<br>
 Became starke blind, and all his senses daz'd,<br>
 That downe he tumbled on the durtie field,<br>
 And seem'd himselfe as conquered to yield.<br>
 Whom when his maistresse proud perceiu'd to fall,<br>
 Whiles yet his feeble feet for faintnesse reeld,<br>
 Vnto the Gyant loudly she gan call,<br>
 O helpe <i>Orgoglio</i>, helpe, or else we perish all.</p><p>
  
 At her so pitteous cry was much amoou'd<br>
 Her champion stout, and for to ayde his frend,<br>
 Againe his wonted angry weapon proou'd:<br>
 But all in vaine: for he has read his end<br>
 In that bright shield, and all their forces spend<br>
 Themselues in vaine: for since that glauncing sight,<br>
 He hath no powre to hurt, nor to defend;<br>
 As where th'Almighties lightning brond does light,<br>
 It dimmes the dazed eyen, and daunts the senses quight.</p><p>
  
 Whom when the Prince, to battell new addrest,<br>
 And threatning high his dreadfull stroke did see,<br>
 His sparkling blade about his head he blest,<br>
 And smote off quite his right leg by the knee,<br>
 That downe he tombled; as an aged tree,<br>
 High growing on the top of rocky clift,<br>
 Whose hartstrings with keene steele nigh hewen be,<br>
 The mightie trunck halfe rent, with ragged rift<br>
 Doth roll adowne the rocks, and fall with fearefull drift.</p><p>
  
 Or as a Castle reared high and round,<br>
 By subtile engins and malitious slight<br>
 Is vndermined from the lowest ground<br>
 And her foundation forst, and feebled quight,<br>
 At last downe falles, and with her heaped hight<br>
 Her hastie ruine does more heauie make,<br>
 And yields it selfe vnto the victours might;<br>
 Such was this Gyaunts fall, that seemd to shake<br>
 The stedfast globe of earth, as it for feare did quake.</p><p>
  
 The knight then lightly leaping to the pray,<br>
 With mortall steele him smot againe so sore,<br>
 That headlesse his vnweldy bodie lay,<br>
 All wallowd in his owne fowle bloudy gore,<br>
 Which flowed from his wounds in wondrous store,<br>
 But soone as breath out of his breast did pas,<br>
 That huge great body, which the Gyaunt bore,<br>
 Was vanisht quite, and of that monstrous mas<br>
 Was nothing left, but like an emptie bladder was.</p><p>
  
 Whose grieuous fall, when false <i>Duessa</i> spide,<br>
 Her golden cup she cast vnto the ground,<br>
 And crowned mitre rudely threw aside;<br>
 Such percing griefe her stubborne hart did wound,<br>
 That she could not endure that dolefull stound,<br>
 But leauing all behind her, fled away:<br>
 The light-foot Squire her quickly turnd around,<br>
 And by hard meanes enforcing her to stay,<br>
 So brought vnto his Lord, as his deserued pray.</p><p>
  
 The royall Virgin, which beheld from farre,<br>
 In pensiue plight, and sad perplexitie,<br>
 The whole atchieuement of this doubtfull warre,<br>
 Came running fast to greet his victorie,<br>
 With sober gladnesse, and myld modestie,<br>
 And with sweet ioyous cheare him thus bespake;<br>
 Faire braunch of noblesse, flowre of cheualrie,<br>
 That with your worth the world amazed make,<br>
 How shall I quite the paines, ye suffer for my sake?</p><p>
  
 And you fresh bud of vertue springing fast,<br>
 Whom these sad eyes saw nigh vnto deaths dore,<br>
 What hath poore Virgin for such perill past,<br>
 Wherewith you to reward? Accept therefore<br>
 My simple selfe, and seruice euermore;<br>
 And he that high does sit, and all things see<br>
 With equall eyes, their merites to restore,<br>
 Behold what ye this day haue done for mee,<br>
 And what I cannot quite, requite with vsuree.</p><p>
  
 But sith the heauens, and your faire handeling<br>
 Haue made you maister of the field this day,<br>
 Your fortune maister eke with gouerning,<br>
 And well begun end all so well, I pray,<br>
 Ne let that wicked woman scape away;<br>
 For she it is, that did my Lord bethrall,<br>
 My dearest Lord, and deepe in dongeon lay,<br>
 Where he his better dayes hath wasted all.<br>
 O heare, how piteous he to you for ayd does call.</p><p>
  
 Forthwith he gaue in charge vnto his Squire,<br>
 That scarlot whore to keepen carefully;<br>
 Whiles he himselfe with greedie great desire<br>
 Into the Castle entred forcibly,<br>
 Where liuing creature none he did espye;<br>
 Then gan he lowdly through the house to call:<br>
 But no man car'd to answere to his crye.<br>
 There raignd a solemne silence ouer all,<br>
 Nor voice was heard, nor wight was seene in bowre or hall.</p><p>
  
 At last with creeping crooked pace forth came<br>
 An old old man, with beard as white as snow,<br>
 That on a staffe his feeble steps did frame,<br>
 And guide his wearie gate both too and fro:<br>
 For his eye sight him failed long ygo,<br>
 And on his arme a bounch of keyes he bore,<br>
 The which vnused rust did ouergrow:<br>
 Those were the keyes of euery inner dore,<br>
 But he could not them vse, but kept them still in store.</p><p>
  
 But very vncouth sight was to behold,<br>
 How he did fashion his vntoward pace,<br>
 For as he forward moou'd his footing old,<br>
 So backward still was turnd his wrincled face,<br>
 Vnlike to men, who euer as they trace,<br>
 Both feet and face one way are wont to lead.<br>
 This was the auncient keeper of that place,<br>
 And foster father of the Gyant dead;<br>
 His name <i>Ignaro</i> did his nature right aread.</p><p>
  
 His reuerend haires and holy grauitie<br>
 The knight much honord, as beseemed well,<br>
 And gently askt, where all the people bee,<br>
 Which in that stately building wont to dwell.<br>
 Who answerd him full soft, he could not tell.<br>
 Againe he askt, where that same knight was layd,<br>
 Whom great <i>Orgoglio</i> with his puissaunce fell<br>
 Had made his caytiue thrall; againe he sayde,<br>
 He could not tell: ne euer other answere made.</p><p>
  
 Then asked he, which way he in might pas:<br>
 He could not tell, againe he answered.<br>
 Thereat the curteous knight displeased was,<br>
 And said, Old sire, it seemes thou hast not red<br>
 How ill it sits with that same siluer hed<br>
 In vaine to mocke, or mockt in vaine to bee:<br>
 But if thou be, as thou art pourtrahed<br>
 With natures pen, in ages graue degree,<br>
 Aread in grauer wise, what I demaund of thee.</p><p>
  
 His answere likewise was, he could not tell.<br>
 Whose senceless speach, and doted ignorance<br>
 When as the noble Prince had marked well,<br>
 He ghest his nature by his countenance,<br>
 And calmd his wrath with goodly temperance.<br>
 Then to him stepping, from his arme did reach<br>
 Those keyes, and made himselfe free enterance.<br>
 Each dore he opened without any breach;<br>
 There was no barre to stop, nor foe him to empeach.</p><p>
  
 There all within full rich arayd he found,<br>
 With royall arras and resplendent gold.<br>
 And did with store of euery thing abound,<br>
 That greatest Princes presence might behold.<br>
 But all the floore (too filthy to be told)<br>
 With bloud of guiltlesse babes, and innocents trew,<br>
 Which there were slaine, as sheepe out of the fold,<br>
 Defiled was, that dreadfull was to vew,<br>
 And sacred ashes ouer it was strowed new.</p><p>
  
 And there beside of marble stone was built<br>
 An Altare, caru'd with cunning imagery,<br>
 On which true Christians bloud was often spilt,<br>
 And holy Martyrs often doen to dye,<br>
 With cruell malice and strong tyranny:<br>
 Whose blessed sprites from vnderneath the stone<br>
 To God for vengeance cryde continually,<br>
 And with great griefe were often heard to grone,<br>
 That hardest heart would bleede, to heare their piteous mone.</p><p>
  
 Through euery rowme he sought, and euery bowr,<br>
 But no where could he find that wofull thrall:<br>
 At last he came vnto an yron doore,<br>
 That fast was lockt, but key found not at all<br>
 Emongst that bounch, to open it withall;<br>
 But in the same a little grate was pight,<br>
 Through which he sent his voyce, and lowd did call<br>
 With all his powre, to weet, if liuing wight<br>
 Were housed therewithin, whom he enlargen might.</p><p>
  
 Therewith an hollow, dreary, murmuring voyce<br>
 These piteous plaints and dolours did resound;<br>
 O who is that, which brings me happy choyce<br>
 Of death, that here lye dying euery stound,<br>
 Yet liue perforce in balefull darkenesse bound?<br>
 For now three Moones haue chãged thrice their hew,<br>
 And haue beene thrice hid vnderneath the ground,<br>
 Since I the heauens chearefull face did vew,<br>
 O welcome thou, that doest of death bring tydings trew.</p><p>
  
 Which when that Champion heard, with percing point<br>
 Of pitty deare his hart was thrilled sore,<br>
 And trembling horrour ran through euery ioynt,<br>
 For ruth of gentle knight so fowle forlore:<br>
 Which shaking off, he rent that yron dore,<br>
 With furious force, and indignation fell;<br>
 Where entred in, his foot could find no flore,<br>
 But all a deepe descent, as darke as hell,<br>
 That breathed euer forth a filthie banefull smell.</p><p>
  
 But neither darkenesse fowle, nor filthy bands,<br>
 Nor noyous smell his purpose could withhold,<br>
 (Entire affection hateth nicer hands)<br>
 But that with constant zeale, and courage bold,<br>
 After long paines and labours manifold,<br>
 He found the meanes that Prisoner vp to reare;<br>
 Whose feeble thighes, vnhable to vphold<br>
 His pined corse, him scarse to light could beare,<br>
 A ruefull spectacle of death and ghastly drere.</p><p>
  
 His sad dull eyes deepe sunck in hollow pits,<br>
 Could not endure th'vnwonted sunne to view;<br>
 His bare thin cheekes for want of better bits,<br>
 And empty sides deceiued of their dew,<br>
 Could make a stony hart his hap to rew;<br>
 His rawbone armes, whose mighty brawned bowrs<br>
 Were wont to riue steele plates, and helmets hew,<br>
 Were cleane consum'd, and all his vitall powres<br>
 Decayd, and all his flesh shronk vp like withered flowres.</p><p>
  
 Whom when his Lady saw, to him she ran<br>
 With hasty ioy: to see him made her glad,<br>
 And sad to view his visage pale and wan,<br>
 Who earst in flowres of freshest youth was clad.<br>
 Tho when her well of teares she wasted had,<br>
 She said, Ah dearest Lord, what euill starre<br>
 On you hath fround, and pourd his influence bad,<br>
 That of your selfe ye thus berobbed arre,<br>
 And this misseeming hew your manly looks doth marre?</p><p>
  
 But welcome now my Lord, in wele or woe,<br>
 Whose presence I haue lackt too long a day;<br>
 And fie on Fortune mine auowed foe,<br>
 Whose wrathfull wreakes them selues do now alay.<br>
 And for these wrongs shall treble penaunce pay<br>
 Of treble good: good growes of euils priefe.<br>
 The chearelesse man, whom sorrow did dismay,<br>
 Had no delight to treaten of his griefe;<br>
 His long endured famine needed more reliefe.</p><p>
  
 Faire Lady, then said that victorious knight,<br>
 The things, that grieuous were to do, or beare,<br>
 Them to renew, I wote, breeds no delight:<br>
 Best musicke breeds delight in loathing eare:<br>
 But th'onely good, that growes of passed feare,<br>
 Is to be wise, and ware of like agein.<br>
 This dayes ensample hath this lesson deare<br>
 Deepe written in my heart with yron pen,<br>
 That blisse may not abide in state of mortall men.</p><p>
  
 Henceforth sir knight, take to you wonted strength,<br>
 And maister these mishaps with patient might;<br>
 Loe where your foe lyes stretcht in monstrous length,<br>
 And loe that wicked woman in your sight,<br>
 The roote of all your care, and wretched plight,<br>
 Now in your powre, to let her liue, or dye.<br>
 To do her dye (quoth <i>Vna</i>) were despight,<br>
 And shame t'auenge so weake an enimy;<br>
 But spoile her of her scarlot robe, and let her fly.</p><p>
  
 So as she bad, that witch they disaraid,<br>
 And robd of royall robes, and purple pall,<br>
 And ornaments that richly were displaid;<br>
 Ne spared they to strip her naked all.<br>
 Then when they had despoild her tire and call,<br>
 Such as she was, their eyes might her behold,<br>
 That her misshaped parts did them appall,<br>
 A loathly, wrinckled hag, ill fauoured, old,<br>
 Whose secret filth good manners biddeth not be told.</p><p>
  
 Her craftie head was altogether bald,<br>
 And as in hate of honorable eld,<br>
 Was ouergrowne with scurfe and filthy scald;<br>
 Her teeth out of her rotten gummes were feld,<br>
 And her sowre breath abhominably smeld;<br>
 Her dried dugs, like bladders lacking wind,<br>
 Hong downe, and filthy matter from them weld;<br>
 Her wrizled skin as rough, as maple rind,<br>
 So scabby was, that would haue loathd all womankind.</p><p>
  
 Her neather parts, the shame of all her kind,<br>
 My chaster Muse for shame doth blush to write;<br>
 But at her rompe she growing had behind<br>
 A foxes taile, with dong all fowly dight;<br>
 And eke her feete most monstrous were in sight;<br>
 For one of them was like an Eagles claw,<br>
 With griping talaunts armd to greedy fight,<br>
 The other like a Beares vneuen paw:<br>
 More vgly shape yet neuer liuing creature saw.</p><p>
  
 Which when the knights beheld, amazd they were,<br>
 And wondred at so fowle deformed wight.<br>
 Such then (said <i>Vna</i>) as she seemeth here,<br>
 Such is the face of falshood, such the sight<br>
 Of fowle <i>Duessa</i>, when her borrowed light<br>
 Is laid away, and counterfesaunce knowne.<br>
 Thus when they had the witch disrobed quight,<br>
 And all her filthy feature open showne,<br>
 They let her goe at will, and wander wayes vnknowne.</p><p>
  
 She flying fast from heauens hated face,<br>
 And from the world that her discouered wide,<br>
 Fled to the wastfull wildernesse apace,<br>
 From liuing eyes her open shame to hide,<br>
 And lurkt in rocks and caues long vnespide.<br>
 But that faire crew of knights, and <i>Vna</i> faire<br>
 Did in that castle afterwards abide,<br>
 To rest them selues, and weary powres repaire,<br>
 Where store they found of all, that dainty was and rare.</p><p>

 Old <i>Timon</i>, who in youthly yeares hath beene<br>
 In warlike feates th'expertest man aliue,<br>
 And is the wisest now on earth I weene;<br>
 His dwelling is low in a valley greene,<br>
 Vnder the foot of <i>Rauran</i> mossy hore,<br>
 From whence the riuer <i>Dee</i> as siluer cleene<br>
 His tombling billowes rolls with gentle rore:<br>
 There all my dayes he traind me vp in vertuous lore.</p><p>
  
 Thither the great Magicien <i>Merlin</i> came,<br>
 As was his vse, ofttimes to visit me:<br>
 For he had charge my discipline to frame,<br>
 And Tutours nouriture to ouersee.<br>
 Him oft and oft I askt in priuitie,<br>
 Of what loines and what lignage I did spring:<br>
 Whose aunswere bad me still assured bee,<br>
 That I was sonne and heire vnto a king,<br>
 As time in her iust terme the truth to light should bring.</p><p>
  
 Well worthy impe, said then the Lady gent,<br>
 And Pupill fit for such a Tutours hand.<br>
 But what aduenture, or what high intent<br>
 Hath brought you hither into Faery land,<br>
 Aread Prince <i>Arthur</i>, crowne of Martiall band?<br>
 Full hard it is (quoth he) to read aright<br>
 The course of heauenly cause, or vnderstand<br>
 The secret meaning of th'eternall might,<br>
 That rules mens wayes, and rules the thoughts of liuing wight.</p><p>
  
 For whither he through fatall deepe foresight<br>
 Me hither sent, for cause to me vnghest,<br>
 Or that fresh bleeding wound, which day and night<br>
 Whilome doth rancle in my riuen brest,<br>
 With forced fury following his behest,<br>
 Me hither brought by wayes yet neuer found,<br>
 You to haue helpt I hold my selfe yet blest.<br>
 Ah curteous knight (quoth she) what secret wound<br>
 Could euer find, to grieue the gentlest hart on ground?</p><p>
  
 Deare Dame (quoth he) you sleeping sparkes awake,<br>
 Which troubled once, into huge flames will grow,<br>
 Ne euer will their feruent fury slake,<br>
 Till liuing moysture into smoke do flow,<br>
 And wasted life do lye in ashes low.<br>
 Yet sithens silence lesseneth not my fire,<br>
 But told it flames, and hidden it does glow,<br>
 I will reuele, what ye so much desire:<br>
 Ah Loue, lay downe thy bow, the whiles I may respire.</p><p>
  
 It was in freshest flowre of youthly yeares,<br>
 When courage first does creepe in manly chest,<br>
 Then first the coale of kindly heat appeares<br>
 To kindle loue in euery liuing brest;<br>
 But me had warnd old <i>Timons</i> wise behest,<br>
 Those creeping flames by reason to subdew,<br>
 Before their rage grew to so great vnrest,<br>
 As miserable louers vse to rew,<br>
 Which still wex old in woe, whiles woe still wexeth new.</p><p>
  
 That idle name of loue, and louers life,<br>
 As losse of time, and vertues enimy<br>
 I euer scornd, and ioyd to stirre vp strife,<br>
 In middest of their mournfull Tragedy,<br>
 Ay wont to laugh, when them I heard to cry,<br>
 And blow the fire, which them to ashes brent:<br>
 Their God himselfe, grieu'd at my libertie,<br>
 Shot many a dart at me with fiers intent,<br>
 But I them warded all with wary gouernment.</p><p>
  
 But all in vaine: no fort can be so strong,<br>
 Ne fleshly brest can armed be so sound,<br>
 But will at last be wonne with battrie long,<br>
 Or vnawares at disauantage found;<br>
 Nothing is sure, that growes on earthly ground:<br>
 And who most trustes in arme of fleshly might,<br>
 And boasts, in beauties chaine not to be bound,<br>
 Doth soonest fall in disauentrous fight,<br>
 And yeeldes his caytiue neck to victours most despight.</p><p>
  
 Ensample make of him your haplesse ioy,<br>
 And of my selfe now mated, as ye see;<br>
 Whose prouder vaunt that proud auenging boy<br>
 Did soone pluck downe, and curbd my libertie.<br>
 For on a day prickt forth with iollitie<br>
 Of looser life, and heat of hardiment,<br>
 Raunging the forest wide on courser free,<br>
 The fields, the floods, the heauens with one consent<br>
 Did seeme to laugh on me, and fauour mine intent.</p><p>
  
 For-wearied with my sports, I did alight<br>
 From loftie steed, and downe to sleepe me layd;<br>
 The verdant gras my couch did goodly dight,<br>
 And pillow was my helmet faire displayd:<br>
 Whiles euery sence the humour sweet embayd,<br>
 And slombring soft my hart did steale away,<br>
 Me seemed, by my side a royall Mayd<br>
 Her daintie limbes full softly down did lay:<br>
 So faire a creature yet saw neuer sunny day.</p><p>
  
 Most goodly glee and louely blandishment<br>
 She to me made, and bad me loue her deare,<br>
 For dearely sure her loue was to me bent,<br>
 As when iust time expired should appeare.<br>
 But whether dreames delude, or true it were,<br>
 Was neuer hart so rauisht with delight,<br>
 Ne liuing man like words did euer heare,<br>
 As she to me deliuered all that night;<br>
 And at her parting said, She Queene of Faeries hight.</p><p>
  
 When I awoke, and found her place deuoyd,<br>
 And nought but pressed gras, where she had lyen,<br>
 I sorrowed all so much, as earst I ioyd,<br>
 And washed all her place with watry eyen.<br>
 From that day forth I lou'd that face diuine;<br>
 From that day forth I cast in carefull mind,<br>
 To seeke her out with labour, and long tyne,<br>
 And neuer vow to rest, till her I find,<br>
 Nine monethes I seeke in vaine yet ni'll that vow vnbind.</p><p>
  
 Thus as he spake, his visage wexed pale,<br>
 And chaunge of hew great passion did bewray;<br>
 Yet still he stroue to cloke his inward bale,<br>
 And hide the smoke, that did his fire display,<br>
 Till gentle <i>Vna</i> thus to him gan say;<br>
 O happy Queene of Faeries, that hast found<br>
 Mongst many, one that with his prowesse may<br>
 Defend thine honour, and thy foes confound:<br>
 True Loues are oftẽ sown, but seldom grow on ground.</p><p>
  
 Thine, O then, said the gentle <i>Redcrosse</i> knight,<br>
 Next to that Ladies loue, shalbe the place,<br>
 O fairest virgin, full of heauenly light,<br>
 Whose wondrous faith, exceeding earthly race,<br>
 Was firmest fixt in mine extremest case,<br>
 And you, my Lord, the Patrone of my life,<br>
 Of that great Queene may well gaine worthy grace:<br>
 For onely worthy you through prowes priefe<br>
 Yf liuing man mote worthy be, to be her liefe.</p><p>
  
 So diuersly discoursing of their loues,<br>
 The golden Sunne his glistring head gan shew,<br>
 And sad remembraunce now the Prince amoues,<br>
 With fresh desire his voyage to pursew:<br>
 Als <i>Vna</i> earnd her traueill to renew.<br>
 Then those two knights, fast friendship for to bynd,<br>
 And loue establish each to other trew,<br>
 Gaue goodly gifts, the signes of gratefull mynd,<br>
 And eke as pledges firme, right hands together ioynd.</p><p>
  
 Prince <i>Arthur</i> gaue a boxe of Diamond sure,<br>
 Embowd with gold and gorgeous ornament,<br>
 Wherein were closd few drops of liquor pure,<br>
 Of wondrous worth, and vertue excellent,<br>
 That any wound could heale incontinent:<br>
 Which to requite, the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight him gaue<br>
 A booke, wherein his Saueours testament<br>
 Was writ with golden letters rich and braue;<br>
 A worke of wondrous grace, and able soules to saue.</p><p>
  
 Thus beene they parted, <i>Arthur</i> on his way<br>
 To seeke his loue, and th'other for to fight<br>
 With <i>Vnaes</i> foe, that all her realme did pray.<br>
 But she now weighing the decayed plight,<br>
 And shrunken synewes of her chosen knight,<br>
 Would not a while her forward course pursew,<br>
 Ne bring him forth in face of dreadfull fight,<br>
 Till he recouered had his former hew:<br>
 For him to be yet weake and wearie well she knew.</p><p>
  
 So as they traueild, lo they gan espy<br>
 An armed knight towards them gallop fast,<br>
 That seemed from some feared foe to fly,<br>
 Or other griesly thing, that him agast.<br>
 Still as he fled, his eye was backward cast,<br>
 As if his feare still followed him behind;<br>
 Als flew his steed, as he his bands had brast,<br>
 And with his winged heeles did tread the wind,<br>
 As he had beene a fole of <i>Pegasus</i> his kind.</p><p>
  
 Nigh as he drew, they might perceiue his head<br>
 To be vnarmd, and curld vncombed heares<br>
 Vpstaring stiffe, dismayd with vncouth dread;<br>
 Nor drop of bloud in all his face appeares<br>
 Nor life in limbe: and to increase his feares,<br>
 In fowle reproch of knighthoods faire degree,<br>
 About his neck an hempen rope he weares,<br>
 That with his glistring armes does ill agree;<br>
 But he of rope or armes has now no memoree.</p><p>
  
 The <i>Redcrosse</i> knight toward him crossed fast,<br>
 To weet, what mister wight was so dismayd:<br>
 There him he finds all sencelesse and aghast,<br>
 That of him selfe he seemd to be afrayd;<br>
 Whom hardly he from flying forward stayd,<br>
 Till he these wordes to him deliuer might;<br>
 Sir knight, aread who hath ye thus arayd,<br>
 And eke from whom make ye this hasty flight:<br>
 For neuer knight I saw in such misseeming plight.</p><p>
  
 He answerd nought at all, but adding new<br>
 Feare to his first amazment, staring wide<br>
 With stony eyes, and hartlesse hollow hew,<br>
 Astonisht stood, as one that had aspide<br>
 Infernall furies, with their chaines vntide.<br>
 Him yet againe, and yet againe bespake<br>
 The gentle knight; who nought to him replide,<br>
 But trembling euery ioynt did inly quake,<br>
 And foltring tongue at last these words seemd forth to shake.</p><p>
  
 For Gods deare loue, Sir knight, do me not stay;<br>
 For loe he comes, he comes fast after mee.<br>
 Eft looking backe would faine haue runne away;<br>
 But he him forst to stay, and tellen free<br>
 The secret cause of his perplexitie:<br>
 Yet nathemore by his bold hartie speach,<br>
 Could his bloud-frosen hart emboldned bee,<br>
 But through his boldnesse rather feare did reach,<br>
 Yet forst, at last he made through silence suddein breach.</p><p>
  
 And am I now in safetie sure (quoth he)<br>
 From him, that would haue forced me to dye?<br>
 And is the point of death now turnd fro mee,<br>
 That I may tell this haplesse history?<br>
 Feare nought: (quoth he) no daunger now is nye?<br>
 Then shall I you recount a ruefull cace,<br>
 (Said he) the which with this vnlucky eye<br>
 I late beheld, and had not greater grace<br>
 Me reft from it, had bene partaker of the place.</p><p>
  
 I lately chaunst (Would I had neuer chaunst)<br>
 With a faire knight to keepen companee,<br>
 Sir <i>Terwin</i> hight, that well himselfe aduaunst<br>
 In all affaires, and was both bold and free,<br>
 But not so happie as mote happie bee:<br>
 He lou'd, as was his lot, a Ladie gent,<br>
 That him againe lou'd in the least degree:<br>
 For she was proud, and of too high intent,<br>
 And ioyd to see her louer languish and lament.</p><p>
  
 From whom returning sad and comfortlesse,<br>
 As on the way together we did fare,<br>
 We met that villen (God from him me blesse)<br>
 That cursed wight, from whom I scapt whyleare,<br>
 A man of hell, that cals himselfe <i>Despaire</i>:<br>
 Who first vs greets, and after faire areedes<br>
 Of tydings strange, and of aduentures rare:<br>
 So creeping close, as Snake in hidden weedes,<br>
 Inquireth of our states, and of our knightly deedes.</p><p>
  
 Which when he knew, and felt ourfeeble harts<br>
 Embost with bale, and bitter byting griefe,<br>
 Which loue had launched with his deadly darts,<br>
 With wounding words and termes of foule repriefe<br>
 He pluckt from vs all hope of due reliefe,<br>
 That earst vs held in loue of lingring life;<br>
 Then hopelesse hartlesse, gan the cunning thiefe<br>
 Perswade vs die, to stint all further strife:<br>
 To me he lent this rope, to him a rustie knife.</p><p>
  
 With which sad instrument of hastie death,<br>
 That wofull louer, loathing lenger light,<br>
 A wide way made to let forth liuing breath.<br>
 But I more fearefull, or more luckie wight,<br>
 Dismayd with that deformed dismall sight,<br>
 Fled fast away, halfe dead with dying feare:<br>
 Ne yet assur'd of life by you, Sir knight,<br>
 Whose like infirmitie like chaunce may beare:<br>
 But God you neuer let his charmed speeches heare.</p><p>
  
 How may a man (said he) with idle speach<br>
 Be wonne, to spoyle the Castle of his health?<br>
 I wote (quoth he) whom triall late did teach,<br>
 That like would not for all this worldes wealth:<br>
 His subtill tongue, like dropping honny, mealt'th<br>
 Into the hart, and searcheth euery vaine,<br>
 That ere one be aware, by secret stealth<br>
 His powre is reft, and weaknesse doth remaine.<br>
 O neuer Sir desire to try his guilefull traine.</p><p>
  
 Certes (said he) hence shall I neuer rest,<br>
 Till I that treachours art haue heard and tride;<br>
 And you Sir knight, whose name mote I request,<br>
 Of grace do me vnto his cabin guide.<br>
 I that hight <i>Treuisan</i> (quoth he) will ride<br>
 Against my liking backe, to doe you grace:<br>
 But nor for gold nor glee will I abide<br>
 By you, when ye arriue in that same place;<br>
 For leuer had I die, then see his deadly face.</p><p>
  
 Ere long they come, where that same wicked wight<br>
 His dwelling has, low in an hollow caue,<br>
 Farre vnderneath a craggie clift ypight,<br>
 Darke, dolefull, drearie, like a greedie graue,<br>
 That still for carrion carcases doth craue:<br>
 On top whereof aye dwelt the ghastly Owle,<br>
 Shrieking his balefull note, which euer draue<br>
 Farre from that haunt all other chearefull fowle;<br>
 And all about it wandring ghostes did waile and howle.</p><p>
  
 And all about old stockes and stubs of trees,<br>
 Whereon nor fruit, nor leafe was euer seene,<br>
 Did hang vpon the ragged rocky knees;<br>
 On which had many wretches hanged beene,<br>
 Whose carcases were scattered on the greene,<br>
 And throwne about the cliffs. Arriued there,<br>
 That bare-head knight for dread and dolefull teene,<br>
 Would faine haue fled, ne durst approchen neare,<br>
 But th'other forst him stay, and comforted in feare.</p><p>
  
 That darkesome caue they enter, where they find<br>
 That cursed man, low sitting on the ground,<br>
 Musing full sadly in his sullein mind;<br>
 His griesie lockes, long growen, and vnbound,<br>
 Disordred hong about his shoulders round,<br>
 And hid his face; through which his hollow eyne<br>
 Lookt deadly dull, and stared as astound;<br>
 His raw-bone cheekes through penurie and pine,<br>
 Were shronke into his iawes, as he did neuer dine.</p><p>
  
 His garment nought but many ragged clouts,<br>
 With thornes together pind and patched was,<br>
 The which his naked sides he wrapt abouts;<br>
 And him beside there lay vpon the gras<br>
 A drearie corse, whose life away did pas,<br>
 All wallowd in his owne yet luke-warme blood,<br>
 That from his wound yet welled fresh alas;<br>
 In which a rustie knife fast fixed stood,<br>
 And made an open passage for the gushing flood.</p><p>
  
 Which piteous spectacle, approuing trew<br>
 The wofull tale that <i>Treuisan</i> had told,<br>
 When as the gentle <i>Redcrosse</i> knight did vew,<br>
 With firie zeale he burnt in courage bold,<br>
 Him to auenge, before his bloud were cold,<br>
 And to the villein said, Thou damned wight,<br>
 The author of this fact, we here behold,<br>
 What iustice can but iudge against thee right,<br>
 With thine owne bloud to price his bloud, here shed in sight.</p><p>
  
 What franticke fit (quoth he) hath thus distraught<br>
 Thee, foolish man, so rash a doome to giue?<br>
 What iustice euer other iudgement taught,<br>
 But he should die, who merites not to liue?<br>
 None else to death this man despayring driue,<br>
 But his owne guiltie mind deseruing death.<br>
 Is then vniust to each his due to giue?<br>
 Or let him die, that loatheth liuing breath?<br>
 Or let him die at ease, that liueth here vneath?</p><p>
  
 Who trauels by the wearie wandring way,<br>
 To come vnto his wished home in haste,<br>
 And meetes a flood, that doth his passage stay,<br>
 Is not great grace to helpe him ouer past,<br>
 Or free his feet, that in the myre sticke fast?<br>
 Most enuious man, that grieues at neighbours good,<br>
 And fond, that ioyest in the woe thou hast,<br>
 Why wilt not let him passe, that long hath stood<br>
 Vpon the banke, yet wilt thy selfe not passe the flood?</p><p>
  
 He there does now enioy eternall rest<br>
 And happie ease, which thou doest want and craue,<br>
 And further from it daily wanderest:<br>
 What if some litle paine the passage haue,<br>
 That makes fraile flesh to feare the bitter waue?<br>
 Is not short paine well borne, that brings long ease,<br>
 And layes the soule to sleepe in quiet graue?<br>
 Sleepe after toyle, port after stormie seas,<br>
 Ease after warre, death after life does greatly please.</p><p>
  
 The knight much wondred at his suddeine wit,<br>
 And said, The terme of life is limited,<br>
 Ne may a man prolong, nor shorten it;<br>
 The souldier may not moue from watchfull sted,<br>
 Nor leaue his stand, vntill his Captaine bed.<br>
 Who life did limit by almightie doome,<br>
 (Quoth he) knowes best the termes established;<br>
 And he, that points the Centonell his roome,<br>
 Doth license him depart at sound of morning droome.</p><p>
  
 Is not his deed, what euer thing is donne,<br>
 In heauen and earth? did not he all create<br>
 To die againe? all ends that was begonne.<br>
 Their times in his eternall booke of fate<br>
 Are written sure, and haue their certaine date.<br>
 Who then can striue with strong necessitie,<br>
 That holds the world in his still chaunging state,<br>
 Or shunne the death ordaynd by destinie?<br>
 Whẽ houre of death is come, let none aske whence, nor why.</p><p>
  
 The lenger life, I wote the greater sin,<br>
 The greater sin, the greater punishment:<br>
 All those great battels, which thou boasts to win,<br>
 Through strife, and bloud-shed, and auengement,<br>
 Now praysd, hereafter deare thou shalt repent:<br>
 For life must life, and bloud must bloud repay.<br>
 Is not enough thy euill life forespent?<br>
 For he, that once hath missed the right way,<br>
 The further he doth goe, the further he doth stray.</p><p>
  
 Then do no further goe, no further stray,<br>
 But here lie downe, and to thy rest betake,<br>
 Th'ill to preuent, that life ensewen may.<br>
 For what hath life, that may it loued make,<br>
 And giues not rather cause it to forsake?<br>
 Feare, sicknesse, age, losse, labour, sorrow, strife,<br>
 Paine, hunger, cold, that makes the hart to quake;<br>
 And euer fickle fortune rageth rife,<br>
 All which, and thousands mo do make a loathsome life.</p><p>
  
 Thou wretched man, of death hast greatest need,<br>
 If in true ballance thou wilt weigh thy state:<br>
 For neuer knight, that dared warlike deede,<br>
 More lucklesse disauentures did amate:<br>
 Witnesse the dongeon deepe, wherein of late<br>
 Thy life shut vp, for death so oft did call;<br>
 And though good lucke prolonged hath thy date,<br>
 Yet death then, would the like mishaps forestall,<br>
 Into the which hereafter thou maiest happen fall.</p><p>
  
 Why then doest thou, ô man of sin, desire<br>
 To draw thy dayes forth to their last degree?<br>
 Is not the measure of thy sinfull hire<br>
 High heaped vp with huge iniquitie,<br>
 Against the day of wrath, to burden thee?<br>
 Is not enough, that to this Ladie milde<br>
 Thou falsed hast thy faith with periurie,<br>
 And sold thy selfe to serue <i>Duessa</i> vilde,<br>
 With whom in all abuse thou hast thy selfe defilde?</p><p>
  
 Is not he iust, that all this doth behold<br>
 From highest heauen, and beares an equall eye?<br>
 Shall he thy sins vp in his knowledge fold,<br>
 And guiltie be of thine impietie?<br>
 Is not his law, Let euery sinner die:<br>
 Die shall all flesh? what then must needs be donne,<br>
 Is it not better to doe willinglie,<br>
 Then linger, till the glasse be all out ronne?<br>
 Death is the end of woes: die soone, O faeries sonne.</p><p>
  
 The knight was much enmoued with his speach,<br>
 That as a swords point through his hart did perse,<br>
 And in his conscience made a secret breach,<br>
 Well knowing true all, that he did reherse,<br>
 And to his fresh remembrance did reuerse<br>
 The vgly vew of his deformed crimes,<br>
 That all his manly powres it did disperse,<br>
 As he were charmed with inchaunted rimes,<br>
 That oftentimes he quakt, and fainted oftentimes.</p><p>
  
 In which amazement, when the Miscreant<br>
 Perceiued him to wauer weake and fraile,<br>
 Whiles trembling horror did his conscience dant,<br>
 And hellish anguish did his soule assaile,<br>
 To driue him to despaire, and quite to quaile,<br>
 He shew'd him painted in a table plaine,<br>
 The damned ghosts, that doe in torments waile,<br>
 And thousand feends that doe them endlesse paine<br>
 With fire and brimstone, which for euer shall remaine.</p><p>
  
 The sight whereof so throughly him dismaid,<br>
 That nought but death before his eyes he saw,<br>
 And euer burning wrath before him laid,<br>
 By righteous sentence of th'Almighties law:<br>
 Then gan the villein him to ouercraw,<br>
 And brought vnto him swords, ropes, poison, fire,<br>
 And all that might him to perdition draw;<br>
 And bad him choose, what death he would desire:<br>
 For death was due to him, that had prouokt Gods ire.</p><p>
  
 But when as none of them he saw him take,<br>
 He to him raught a dagger sharpe and keene,<br>
 And gaue it him in hand: his hand did quake,<br>
 And tremble like a leafe of Aspin greene,<br>
 And troubled bloud through his pale face was seene<br>
 To come, and goe with tydings from the hart,<br>
 As it a running messenger had beene.<br>
 At last resolu'd to worke his finall smart,<br>
 He lifted vp his hand, that backe againe did start.</p><p>
  
 Which when as <i>Vna</i> saw, through euery vaine<br>
 The crudled cold ran to her well of life,<br>
 As in a swowne: but soone reliu'd againe,<br>
 Out of his hand she snatcht the cursed knife,<br>
 And threw it to the ground, enraged rife,<br>
 And to him said, Fie, fie, faint harted knight,<br>
 What meanest thou by this reprochfull strife?<br>
 Is this the battell, which thou vauntst to fight<br>
 With that fire-mouthed Dragon, horrible and bright?</p><p>
  
 Come, come away, fraile, seely, fleshly wight,<br>
 Ne let vaine words bewitch thy manly hart,<br>
 Ne diuelish thoughts dismay thy constant spright.<br>
 In heauenly mercies hast thou not a part?<br>
 Why shouldst thou then despeire, that chosen art?<br>
 Where iustice growes, there grows eke greater grace,<br>
 The which doth quench the brond of hellish smart,<br>
 And that accurst hand-writing doth deface,<br>
 Arise, Sir knight arise, and leaue this cursed place.</p><p>
  
 So vp he rose, and thence amounted streight.<br>
 Which when the carle beheld, and saw his guest<br>
 Would safe depart, for all his subtill sleight,<br>
 He chose an halter from among the rest,<br>
 And with it hung himselfe, vnbid vnblest.<br>
 But death he could not worke himselfe thereby;<br>
 For thousand times he so himselfe had drest,<br>
 Yet nathelesse it could not doe him die,<br>
 Till he should die his last, that is eternally.</p><p>
