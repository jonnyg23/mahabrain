  THE SIXTH<br>  BOOKE OF THE 
 <br>  FAERIE QVEENE. <p> 
 <i>Contayning</i><br>  THE LEGEND OF S. CALIDORE<br>  
 <br> <i>OR</i><br> OF COVRTESIE.</p></center><p> 
 
 </p><p>
 </p><blockquote>
 T
 He waies, through which my weary steps I guyde,<br>
 In this delightfull land of Faery,<br>
 Are so exceeding spacious and wyde,<br>
 And sprinckled with such sweet variety,<br>
 Of all that pleasant is to eare or eye,<br>
 That I nigh rauisht with rare thoughts delight,<br>
 My tedious trauell doe forget thereby;<br>
 And when I gin to feele decay of might,<br>
 It strength to me supplies, &amp; chears my dulled spright.<p>
 
 Such secret comfort, and such heauenly pleasures,<br>
 Ye sacred imps, that on <i>Parnasso</i> dwell,<br>
 And there the keeping haue of learnings threasures,<br>
 Which doe all worldly riches farre excell,<br>
 Into the mindes of mortall men doe well,<br>
 And goodly fury into them infuse;<br>
 Guyde ye my footing, and conduct me well<br>
 In these strange waies, where neuer foote did vse,<br>
 Ne none can find, but who was taught them by the Muse.</p><p>
 
 Reuele to me the sacred noursery<br>
 Of vertue, which with you doth there remaine,<br>
 Where it in siluer bowre does hidden ly<br>
 From view of men, and wicked worlds disdaine.<br>
 Since it at first was by the Gods with paine<br>
 Planted in earth, being deriu'd at furst<br>
 From heauenly seedes of bounty soueraine,<br>
 And by them long with carefull labour nurst,<br>
 Till it to ripenesse grew, and forth to honour burst.</p><p>
 
 Amongst them all growes not a fayrer flowre,<br>
 Then is the bloosme of comely courtesie,<br>
 Which though it on a lowly stalke doe bowre,<br>
 Yet brancheth forth in braue nobilitie,<br>
 And spreds it selfe through all ciuilitie:<br>
 Of which though present age doe plenteous seeme,<br>
 Yet being matcht with plaine Antiquitie,<br>
 Ye will them all but fayned showes esteeme,<br>
 Which carry colours faire, that feeble eies misdeeme.</p><p>
 
 But in the triall of true curtesie,<br>
 Its now so farre from that, which then it was,<br>
 That it indeed is nought but forgerie,<br>
 Fashion'd to please the eies of them, that pas,<br>
 Which see not perfet things but in a glas:<br>
 Yet is that glasse so gay, that it can blynd<br>
 The wisest sight, to thinke gold that is bras.<br>
 But vertues seat is deepe within the mynd,<br>
 And not in outward shows, but inward thoughts defynd.</p><p>
 
 But where shall I in all Antiquity<br>
 So faire a patterne finde, where may be seene<br>
 The goodly praise of Princely curtesie,<br>
 As in your selfe, O soueraine Lady Queene,<br>
 In whose pure minde, as in a mirrour sheene<br>
 It showes, and with her brightnesse doth inflame<br>
 The eyes of all, which thereon fixed beene;<br>
 But meriteth indeede an higher name:<br>
 Yet so from low to high vplifted is your fame.</p><p>
 
 Then pardon me, most dreaded Soueraine,<br>
 That from your selfe I doe this vertue bring,<br>
 And to your selfe doe it returne againe:<br>
 So from the Ocean all riuers spring,<br>
 And tribute backe repay as to their King.<br>
 Right so from you all goodly vertues well<br>
 Into the rest, which round about you ring,<br>
 Faire Lords and Ladies, which about you dwell,<br>
 And doe adorne your Court, where courtesies excell.</p><p>
