 </p><blockquote>
 <i>The battell twixt three brethren, with<br>
 Cambell for Canacee.<br>
 Cambina with true friendships bond<br>
 doth their long strife agree.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 O
  Why doe wretched men so much desire,<br>
 To draw their dayes vnto the vtmost date,<br>
 And doe not rather wish them soone expire,<br>
 Knowing the miserie of their estate,<br>
 And thousand perills which them still awate,<br>
 Tossing them like a boate amid the mayne,<br>
 That euery houre they knocke at deathes gate?<br>
 And he that happie seemes and least in payne,<br>
 Yet is as nigh his end, as he that most doth playne.<p>
 
 Therefore this Fay I hold but fond and vaine,<br>
 The which in seeking for her children three<br>
 Long life, thereby did more prolong their paine.<br>
 Yet whilest they liued none did euer see<br>
 More happie creatures, then they seem'd to bee,<br>
 Nor more ennobled for their courtesie,<br>
 That made them dearely lou'd of each degree;<br>
 Ne more renowmed for their cheualrie,<br>
 That made them dreaded much of all men farre and nie.</p><p>
 
 These three that hardie chalenge tooke in hand,<br>
 For <i>Canacee</i> with <i>Cambell</i> for to fight:<br>
 The day was set, that all might vnderstand,<br>
 And pledges pawnd the same to keepe a right,<br>
 That day, the dreddest day that liuing wight<br>
 Did euer see vpon this world to shine,<br>
 So soone as heauens window shewed light,<br>
 These warlike Champions all in armour shine,<br>
 Assembled were in field, the chalenge to define.</p><p>
 
 The field with listes was all about enclos'd,<br>
 To barre the prease of people farre away;<br>
 And at th'one side sixe iudges were dispos'd,<br>
 To view and deeme the deedes of armes that day;<br>
 And on the other side in fresh aray,<br>
 Fayre <i>Canacee</i> vpon a stately stage<br>
 Was set, to see the fortune of that fray,<br>
 And to be seene, as his most worthie wage,<br>
 That could her purchase with his liues aduentur'd gage.</p><p>
 
 Then entred <i>Cambell</i> first into the list,<br>
 With stately steps, and fearelesse countenance,<br>
 As if the conquest his he surely wist.<br>
 Soone after did the brethren three aduance,<br>
 In braue aray and goodly amenance,<br>
 With scutchins gilt and banners broad displayd:<br>
 And marching thrise in warlike ordinance,<br>
 Thrise lowted lowly to the noble Mayd,<br>
 The whiles shril trompets &amp; loud clarions sweetly playd.</p><p>
 
 Which doen the doughty chalenger came forth,<br>
 All arm'd to point his chalenge to abet:<br>
 Gainst whom Sir <i>Priamond</i> with equall worth:<br>
 And equall armes himselfe did forward set.<br>
 A trompet blew; they both together met,<br>
 With dreadfull force, and furious intent,<br>
 Carelesse of perill in their fiers affret,<br>
 As if that life to losse they had forelent,<br>
 And cared not to spare, that should be shortly spent.</p><p>
 
 Right practicke was Sir <i>Priamond</i> in fight,<br>
 And throughly skild in vse of shield and speare;<br>
 Ne lesse approued was <i>Cambelloes</i> might,<br>
 Ne lesse his skill in weapons did appeare,<br>
 That hard it was to weene which harder were.<br>
 Full many mightie strokes on either side<br>
 Were sent, that seemed death in them to beare,<br>
 But they were both so watchfull and well eyde,<br>
 That they auoyded were, and vainely by did slyde.</p><p>
 
 Yet one of many was so strongly bent<br>
 By <i>Priamond</i>, that with vnluckie glaunce,<br>
 Through <i>Cambels</i> shoulder it vnwarely went,<br>
 That forced him his shield to disaduaunce:<br>
 Much was he grieued with that gracelesse chaunce,<br>
 Yet from the wound no drop of bloud there fell,<br>
 But wondrous paine, that did the more enhaunce<br>
 His haughtie courage to aduengement fell:<br>
 Smart daunts not mighty harts, but makes them more to swell.</p><p>
 
 With that his poynant speare he fierce auentred,<br>
 With doubled force close vnderneath his shield,<br>
 That through the mayles into his thigh it entred,<br>
 And there arresting, readie way did yield,<br>
 For bloud to gush forth on the grassie field;<br>
 That he for paine himselfe n'ote right vpreare,<br>
 But too and fro in great amazement reel'd,<br>
 Like an old Oke whose pith and sap is seare,<br>
 At puffe of euery storme doth stagger here and theare.</p><p>
 
 Whom so dismayd when <i>Cambell</i> had espide,<br>
 Againe he droue at him with double might,<br>
 That nought mote stay the steele, till in his side<br>
 The mortall point most cruelly empight:<br>
 Where fast infixed, whilest he sought by slight<br>
 It forth to wrest, the staffe a sunder brake,<br>
 And left the head behind: with which despight<br>
 He all enrag'd, his shiuering speare did shake,<br>
 And charging him a fresh thus felly him bespake.</p><p>
 
 Lo faitour there thy meede vnto thee take,<br>
 The meede of thy mischalenge and abet:<br>
 Not for thine owne, but for thy sisters sake,<br>
 Haue I thus long thy life vnto thee let:<br>
 But to forbeare doth not forgiue the det.<br>
 The wicked weapon heard his wrathfull vow,<br>
 And passing forth with furious affret,<br>
 Pierst through his beuer quite into his brow,<br>
 That with the force it backward forced him to bow.</p><p>
 
 Therewith a sunder in the midst it brast,<br>
 And in his hand nought but the troncheon left,<br>
 The other halfe behind yet sticking fast,<br>
 Out of his headpeece <i>Cambell</i> fiercely reft,<br>
 And with such furie backe at him it heft,<br>
 That making way vnto his dearest life,<br>
 His weasand pipe it through his gorget cleft:<br>
 Thence streames of purple bloud issuing rife,<br>
 Let forth his wearie ghost and made an end of strife.</p><p>
 
 His wearie ghost assoyld from fleshly band,<br>
 Did not as others wont, directly fly<br>
 Vnto her rest in Plutoes griesly land,<br>
 Ne into ayre did vanish presently,<br>
 Ne chaunged was into a starre in sky:<br>
 But through traduction was eftsoones deriued,<br>
 Like as his mother prayd the Destinie,<br>
 Into his other brethren, that suruiued,<br>
 In whom he liu'd a new, of former life depriued.</p><p>
 
 Whom when on ground his brother next beheld,<br>
 Though sad and sorie for so heauy sight,<br>
 Yet leaue vnto his sorrow did not yeeld,<br>
 But rather stird to vengeance and despight,<br>
 Through secret feeling of his generous spright,<br>
 Rusht fiercely forth, the battell to renew,<br>
 As in reuersion of his brothers right;<br>
 And chalenging the Virgin as his dew.<br>
 His foe was soone addrest: the trompets freshly blew.</p><p>
 
 With that they both together fiercely met,<br>
 As if that each ment other to deuoure;<br>
 And with their axes both so sorely bet,<br>
 That neither plate nor mayle, whereas their powre<br>
 They felt, could once sustaine the hideous stowre,<br>
 But riued were like rotten wood a sunder,<br>
 Whilest through their rifts the ruddie bloud did showre<br>
 And fire did flash, like lightning after thunder,<br>
 That fild the lookers on attonce with ruth and wonder.</p><p>
 
 As when two Tygers prickt with hungers rage,<br>
 Haue by good fortune found some beasts fresh spoyle,<br>
 On which they weene their famine to asswage,<br>
 And gaine a feastfull guerdon of their toyle,<br>
 Both falling out doe stirre vp strifefull broyle,<br>
 And cruell battell twixt themselues doe make,<br>
 Whiles neither lets the other touch the soyle,<br>
 But either sdeignes with other to partake:<br>
 So cruelly these Knights stroue for that Ladies sake.</p><p>
 
 Full many strokes, that mortally were ment,<br>
 The whiles were enterchaunged twixt them two;<br>
 Yet they were all with so good wariment<br>
 Or warded, or auoyded and let goe,<br>
 That still the life stood fearelesse of her foe:<br>
 Till <i>Diamond</i> disdeigning long delay<br>
 Of doubtfull fortune wauering to and fro,<br>
 Resolu'd to end it one or other way;<br>
 And heau'd his murdrous axe at him with mighty sway.</p><p>
 
 The dreadfull stroke in case it had arriued,<br>
 Where it was ment, (so deadly it was ment)<br>
 The soule had sure out of his bodie riued,<br>
 And stinted all the strife incontinent.<br>
 But <i>Cambels</i> fate that fortune did preuent:<br>
 For seeing it at hand, he swaru'd asyde,<br>
 And so gaue way vnto his fell intent:<br>
 Who missing of the marke which he had eyde,<br>
 Was with the force nigh feld whilst his right foot did slyde.</p><p>
 
 As when a Vulture greedie of his pray,<br>
 Through hunger long, that hart to him doth lend,<br>
 Strikes at an Heron with all his bodies sway,<br>
 That from his force seemes nought may it defend;<br>
 The warie fowle that spies him toward bend<br>
 His dreadfull souse auoydes, it shunning light,<br>
 And maketh him his wing in vaine to spend;<br>
 That with the weight of his owne weeldlesse might,<br>
 He falleth nigh to ground, and scarse recouereth flight.</p><p>
 
 Which faire aduenture when <i>Cambello</i> spide,<br>
 Full lightly, ere himselfe he could recower,<br>
 From daungers dread to ward his naked side,<br>
 He can let driue at him with all his power,<br>
 And with his axe him smote in euill hower,<br>
 That from his shoulders quite his head he reft:<br>
 The headlesse tronke, as heedlesse of that stower,<br>
 Stood still a while, and his fast footing kept,<br>
 Till feeling life to fayle, it fell, and deadly slept.</p><p>
 
 They which that piteous spectacle beheld,<br>
 Were much amaz'd the headlesse tronke to see<br>
 Stand vp so long, and weapon vaine to weld,<br>
 Vnweeting of the Fates diuine decree,<br>
 For lifes succession in those brethren three.<br>
 For notwithstanding that one soule was reft,<br>
 Yet, had the bodie not dismembred bee,<br>
 It would haue liued, and reuiued eft;<br>
 But finding no fit seat, the lifelesse corse it left.</p><p>
 
 It left; but that same soule, which therein dwelt,<br>
 Streight entring into <i>Triamond</i>, him fild<br>
 With double life, and griefe, which when he felt,<br>
 As one whose inner parts had bene ythrild<br>
 With point of steele, that close his hartbloud spild,<br>
 He lightly lept out of his place of rest,<br>
 And rushing forth into the emptie field,<br>
 Against <i>Cambello</i> fiercely him addrest;<br>
 Who him affronting soone to fight was readie prest.</p><p>
 
 Well mote ye wonder how that noble Knight,<br>
 After he had so often wounded beene,<br>
 Could stand on foot, now to renew the fight.<br>
 But had ye then him forth aduauncing seene,<br>
 Some newborne wight ye would him surely weene:<br>
 So fresh he seemed and so fierce in sight;<br>
 Like as a Snake, whom wearie winters teene,<br>
 Hath worne to nought, now feeling sommers might,<br>
 Casts off his ragged skin and freshly doth him dight.</p><p>
 
 All was through vertue of the ring he wore,<br>
 The which not onely did not from him let<br>
 One drop of bloud to fall, but did restore<br>
 His weakned powers, and dulled spirits whet,<br>
 Through working of the stone therein yset.<br>
 Else how could one of equall might with most,<br>
 Against so many no lesse mightie met,<br>
 Once thinke to match three such on equall cost,<br>
 Three such as able were to match a puissant host.</p><p>
 
 Yet nought thereof was <i>Triamond</i> adredde,<br>
 Ne desperate of glorious victorie,<br>
 But sharpely him assayld, and sore bestedde,<br>
 With heapes of strokes, which he at him let flie,<br>
 As thicke as hayle forth poured from the skie:<br>
 He stroke, he soust, he foynd, he hewd, he lasht,<br>
 And did his yron brond so fast applie,<br>
 That from the same the fierie sparkles flasht,<br>
 As fast as water-sprinckles gainst a rocke are dasht.</p><p>
 
 Much was <i>Cambello</i> daunted with his blowes,<br>
 So thicke they fell, and forcibly were sent,<br>
 That he was forst from daunger of the throwes<br>
 Backe to retire, and somewhat to relent,<br>
 Till th'heat of his fierce furie he had spent:<br>
 Which when for want of breath gan to abate,<br>
 He then afresh with new encouragement<br>
 Did him assayle, and mightily amate,<br>
 As fast as forward erst, now backward to retrate.</p><p>
 
 Like as the tide that comes fro th'Ocean mayne,<br>
 Flowes vp the Shenan with contrarie forse,<br>
 And ouerruling him in his owne rayne,<br>
 Driues backe the current of his kindly course,<br>
 And makes it seeme to haue some other sourse:<br>
 But when the floud is spent, then backe againe<br>
 His borrowed waters forst to redisbourse,<br>
 He sends the sea his owne with double gaine,<br>
 And tribute eke withall, as to his Soueraine.</p><p>
 
 Thus did the battell varie to and fro,<br>
 With diuerse fortune doubtfull to be deemed:<br>
 Now this the better had, now had his fo;<br>
 Then he halfe vanquisht, then the other seemed,<br>
 Yet victors both them selues alwayes esteemed.<br>
 And all the while the disentrayled blood<br>
 Adowne their sides like litle riuers stremed,<br>
 That with the wasting of his vitall flood,<br>
 Sir <i>Triamond</i> at last full faint and feeble stood.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Cambell</i> still more strong and greater grew,<br>
 Ne felt his blood to wast, ne powres emperisht,<br>
 Through that rings vertue, that with vigour new,<br>
 Still when as he enfeebled was, him cherisht,<br>
 And all his wounds, and all his bruses guarisht,<br>
 Like as a withered tree through husbands toyle<br>
 Is often seene full freshly to haue florisht,<br>
 And fruitfull apples to haue borne awhile,<br>
 As fresh as when it first was planted in the soyle.</p><p>
 
 Through which aduantage, in his strength he rose,<br>
 And smote the other with so wondrous might,<br>
 That through the seame, which did his hauberk close,<br>
 Into his throate and life it pierced quight,<br>
 That downe he fell as dead in all mens sight:<br>
 Yet dead he was not, yet he sure did die,<br>
 As all men do, that lose the liuing spright:<br>
 So did one soule out of his bodie flie<br>
 Vnto her natiue home from mortall miserie.</p><p>
 
 But nathelesse whilst all the lookers on<br>
 Him dead behight, as he to all appeard,<br>
 All vnawares he started vp anon,<br>
 As one that had out of a dreame bene reard,<br>
 And fresh assayld his foe; who halfe affeard<br>
 Of th'vncouth sight, as he some ghost had seene,<br>
 Stood still amaz'd, holding his idle sweard;<br>
 Till hauing often by him stricken beene,<br>
 He forced was to strike, and saue him selfe from teene.</p><p>
 
 Yet from thenceforth more warily he fought,<br>
 As one in feare the Stygian gods t'offend,<br>
 Ne followd on so fast, but rather sought<br>
 Him selfe to saue, and daunger to defend,<br>
 Then life and labour both in vaine to spend.<br>
 Which <i>Triamond</i> perceiuing, weened sure<br>
 He gan to faint, toward the battels end,<br>
 And that he should not long on foote endure,<br>
 A signe which did to him the victorie assure.</p><p>
 
 Whereof full blith, eftsoones his mightie hand<br>
 He heav'd on high, in mind with that same blow<br>
 To make an end of all that did withstand:<br>
 Which <i>Cambell</i> seeing come, was nothing slow<br>
 Him selfe to saue from that so deadly throw;<br>
 And at that instant reaching forth his sweard<br>
 Close vnderneath his shield, that scarce did show,<br>
 Stroke him, as he his hand to strike vpreard,<br>
 In th'arm-pit full, that through both sides the wound appeard.</p><p>
 
 Yet still that direfull stroke kept on his way,<br>
 And falling heauie on <i>Cambelloes</i> crest,<br>
 Strooke him so hugely, that in swowne he lay,<br>
 And in his head an hideous wound imprest:<br>
 And sure had it not happily found rest<br>
 Vpon the brim of his brode plated shield,<br>
 It would haue cleft his braine downe to his brest.<br>
 So both at once fell dead vpon the field,<br>
 And each to other seemd the victorie to yield.</p><p>
 
 Which when as all the lookers on beheld,<br>
 They weened sure the warre was at an end,<br>
 And Iudges rose, and Marshals of the field<br>
 Broke vp the listes, their armes away to rend;<br>
 And <i>Canacee</i> gan wayle her dearest frend.<br>
 All suddenly they both vpstarted light,<br>
 The one out of the swownd, which him did blend,<br>
 The other breathing now another spright,<br>
 And fiercely each assayling, gan afresh to fight.</p><p>
 
 Long while they then continued in that wize,<br>
 As if but then the battell had begonne:<br>
 Strokes, wounds, wards, weapons, all they did despise,<br>
 Ne either car'd to ward, or perill shonne,<br>
 Desirous both to haue the battell donne;<br>
 Ne either cared life to saue or spill,<br>
 Ne which of them did winne, ne which were wonne.<br>
 So wearie both of fighting had their fill,<br>
 That life it selfe seemd loathsome, and long safetie ill.</p><p>
 
 Whilst thus the case in doubtfull ballance hong,<br>
 Vnsure to whether side it would incline,<br>
 And all mens eyes and hearts, which there among<br>
 Stood gazing, filled were with rufull tine,<br>
 And secret feare, to see their fatall fine,<br>
 All suddenly they heard a troublous noyes,<br>
 That seemd some perilous tumult to desine,<br>
 Confusd with womens cries, and shouts of boyes,<br>
 Such as the troubled Theaters oftimes annoyes.</p><p>
 
 Thereat the Champions both stood still a space,<br>
 To weeten what that sudden clamour ment;<br>
 Lo where they spyde with speedie whirling pace,<br>
 One in a charet of straunge furniment,<br>
 Towards them driuing like a storme out sent.<br>
 The charet decked was in wondrous wize,<br>
 With gold and many a gorgeous ornament,<br>
 After the Persian Monarks antique guize,<br>
 Such as the maker selfe could best by art deuize.</p><p>
 
 And drawne it was (that wonder is to tell)<br>
 Of two grim lyons, taken from the wood,<br>
 In which their powre all others did excell;<br>
 Now made forget their former cruell mood,<br>
 T'obey their riders hest, as seemed good.<br>
 And therein sate a Ladie passing faire<br>
 And bright, that seemed borne of Angels brood,<br>
 And with her beautie bountie did compare,<br>
 Whether of them in her should haue the greater share.</p><p>
 
 Thereto she learned was in Magicke leare,<br>
 And all the artes, that subtill wits discouer,<br>
 Hauing therein bene trained many a yeare,<br>
 And well instructed by the Fay her mother,<br>
 That in the same she farre exceld all other.<br>
 Who vnderstanding by her mightie art,<br>
 Of th'euill plight, in which her dearest brother<br>
 Now stood, came forth in hast to take his part,<br>
 And pacifie the strife, which causd so deadly smart.</p><p>
 
 And as she passed through th'vnruly preace<br>
 Of people, thronging thicke her to behold,<br>
 Her angrie teame breaking their bonds of peace,<br>
 Great heapes of them, like sheepe in narrow fold,<br>
 For hast did ouer-runne, in dust enrould,<br>
 That thorough rude confusion of the rout,<br>
 Some fearing shriekt, some being harmed hould,<br>
 Some laught for sport, some did for wonder shout,<br>
 And some that would seeme wise, their wonder turnd to dout.</p><p>
 
 In her right hand a rod of peace shee bore,<br>
 About the which two Serpents weren wound,<br>
 Entrayled mutually in louely lore,<br>
 And by the tailes together firmely bound,<br>
 And both were with one oliue garland crownd,<br>
 Like to the rod which <i>Maias</i> sonne doth wield,<br>
 Wherewith the hellish fiends he doth confound.<br>
 And in her other hand a cup she hild,<br>
 The which was with Nepenthe to the brim vpfild.</p><p>
 
 Nepenthe is a drinck of souerayne grace,<br>
 Deuized by the Gods, for to asswage<br>
 Harts grief, and bitter gall away to chace,<br>
 Which stirs vp anguish and contentious rage:<br>
 In stead thereof sweet peace and quiet age<br>
 It doth establish in the troubled mynd.<br>
 Few men, but such as sober are and sage,<br>
 Are by the Gods to drinck thereof assynd;<br>
 But such as drinck, eternall happinesse do fynd.</p><p>
 
 Such famous men, such worthies of the earth,<br>
 As <i>Ioue</i> will haue aduaunced to the skie,<br>
 And there made gods, though borne of mortall berth,<br>
 For their high merits and great dignitie,<br>
 Are wont, before they may to heauen flie,<br>
 To drincke hereof, whereby all cares forepast<br>
 Are washt away quite from their memorie.<br>
 So did those olde Heroes hereof taste,<br>
 Before that they in blisse amongst the Gods were plaste.</p><p>
 
 Much more of price and of more gratious powre<br>
 Is this, then that same water of Ardenne,<br>
 The which <i>Rinaldo</i> drunck in happie howre,<br>
 Described by that famous Tuscane penne:<br>
 For that had might to change the hearts of men<br>
 Fro loue to hate, a change of euill choise:<br>
 But this doth hatred make in loue to brenne,<br>
 And heauy heart with comfort doth reioyce.<br>
 Who would not to this vertue rather yeeld his voice?</p><p>
 
 At last arriuing by the listes side,<br>
 Shee with her rod did softly smite the raile,<br>
 Which straight flew ope, and gaue her way to ride.<br>
 Eftsoones out of her Coch she gan auaile,<br>
 And pacing fairely forth, did bid all haile,<br>
 First to her brother, whom she loued deare,<br>
 That so to see him made her heart to quaile:<br>
 And next to <i>Cambell</i>, whose sad ruefull cheare<br>
 Made her to change her hew, and hidden loue t'appeare.</p><p>
 
 They lightly her requit (for small delight<br>
 They had as then her long to entertaine.)<br>
 And eft them turned both againe to fight;<br>
 Which when she saw, downe on the bloudy plaine<br>
 Her selfe she threw, and teares gan shed amaine;<br>
 Amongst her teares immixing prayers meeke,<br>
 And with her prayers reasons to restraine<br>
 From blouddy strife, and blessed peace to seeke,<br>
 By all that vnto them was deare, did them beseeke.</p><p>
 
 But when as all might nought with them preuaile,<br>
 Shee smote them lightly with her powrefull wand.<br>
 Then suddenly as if their hearts did faile,<br>
 Their wrathfull blades downe fell out of their hand,<br>
 And they like men astonisht still did stand.<br>
 Thus whilest their minds were doubtfully distraught,<br>
 And mighty spirites bound with mightier band,<br>
 Her golden cup to them for drinke she raught,<br>
 Whereof full glad for thirst, ech drunk an harty draught.</p><p>
 
 Of which so soone as they once tasted had,<br>
 Wonder it is that sudden change to see:<br>
 Instead of strokes, each other kissed glad,<br>
 And louely haulst from feare of treason free,<br>
 And plighted hands for euer friends to be.<br>
 When all men saw this sudden change of things,<br>
 So mortall foes so friendly to agree,<br>
 For passing ioy, which so great maruaile brings,<br>
 They all gan shout aloud, that all the heauen rings.</p><p>
 
 All which, when gentle <i>Canacee</i> beheld,<br>
 In hast she from her lofty chaire descended,<br>
 To weet what sudden tidings was befeld:<br>
 Where when she saw that cruell war so ended,<br>
 And deadly foes so faithfully affrended,<br>
 In louely wise she gan that Lady greet,<br>
 Which had so great dismay so well amended,<br>
 And entertaining her with curt'sies meet,<br>
 Profest to her true friendship and affection sweet.</p><p>
 
 Thus when they all accorded goodly were,<br>
 The trumpets sounded, and they all arose,<br>
 Thence to depart with glee and gladsome chere.<br>
 Those warlike champions both together chose,<br>
 Homeward to march, themselues there to repose,<br>
 And wise <i>Cambina</i> taking by her side<br>
 Faire <i>Canacee</i>, as fresh as morning rose,<br>
 Vnto her Coch remounting, home did ride,<br>
 Admir'd of all the people, and much glorifide.</p><p>
 
 Where making ioyous feast theire daies they spent<br>
 In perfect loue, deuoide of hatefull strife,<br>
 Allide with bands of mutuall couplement;<br>
 For <i>Triamond</i> had <i>Canacee</i> to wife,<br>
 With whom he ledd a long and happie life;<br>
 And <i>Cambel</i> tooke <i>Cambina</i> to his fere,<br>
 The which as life were each to other liefe.<br>
 So all alike did loue, and loued were,<br>
 That since their days such louers were not found elswhere.</p><p>
