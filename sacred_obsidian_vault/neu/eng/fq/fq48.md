 </p><blockquote>
 <i>The Squire of low degree releast<br>
 Poeana takes to wife:<br>
 Britomart fightes with many Knights,<br>
 Prince Arthur stints their strife.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 H
 Ard is the doubt, and difficult to deeme,<br>
 When all three kinds of loue together meet,<br>
 And doe dispart the hart with powre extreme,<br>
 Whether shall weigh the balance downe; to weet<br>
 The deare affection vnto kindred sweet,<br>
 Or raging fire of loue to woman kind,<br>
 Or zeale of friends combynd with vertues meet.<br>
 But of them all the band of vertuous mind<br>
 Me seemes the gentle hart should most assured bind.<p>
 
 For naturall affection soone doth cesse,<br>
 And quenched is with <i>Cupids</i> greater flame:<br>
 But faithfull friendship doth them both suppresse,<br>
 And them with maystring discipline doth tame,<br>
 Through thoughts aspyring to eternall fame.<br>
 For as the soule doth rule the earthly masse,<br>
 And all the seruice of the bodie frame,<br>
 So loue of soule doth loue of bodie passe,<br>
 No lesse then perfect gold surmounts the meanest brasse.</p><p>
 
 All which who list by tryall to assay,<br>
 Shall in this storie find approued plaine;<br>
 In which these Squires true friendship more did sway,<br>
 Then either care of parents could refraine,<br>
 Or loue of fairest Ladie could constraine.<br>
 For though <i>Poeana</i> were as faire as morne,<br>
 Yet did this trustie Squire with proud disdaine<br>
 For his friends sake her offred fauours scorne,<br>
 And she her selfe her syre, of whom she was yborne.</p><p>
 
 Now after that Prince <i>Arthur</i> graunted had,<br>
 To yeeld strong succour to that gentle swayne,<br>
 Who now long time had lyen in prison sad,<br>
 He gan aduise how best he mote darrayne<br>
 That enterprize, for greatest glories gayne.<br>
 That headlesse tyrants tronke he reard from ground,<br>
 And hauing ympt the head to it agayne,<br>
 Vpon his vsuall beast it firmely bound,<br>
 And made it so to ride, as it aliue was found.</p><p>
 
 Then did he take that chaced Squire, and layd<br>
 Before the ryder, as he captiue were,<br>
 And made his Dwarfe, though with vnwilling ayd,<br>
 To guide the beast, that did his maister beare,<br>
 Till to his castle they approched neare.<br>
 Whom when the watch, that kept continuall ward<br>
 Saw comming home; all voide of doubtfull feare,<br>
 He running downe, the gate to him vnbard;<br>
 Whom straight the Prince ensuing, in together far'd.</p><p>
 
 There he did find in her delitious boure<br>
 The faire <i>Poeana</i> playing on a Rote,<br>
 Complayning of her cruell Paramoure,<br>
 And singing all her sorrow to the note,<br>
 As she had learned readily by rote.<br>
 That with the sweetnesse of her rare delight,<br>
 The Prince halfe rapt, began on her to dote:<br>
 Till better him bethinking of the right,<br>
 He her vnwares attacht, and captiue held by might.</p><p>
 
 Whence being forth produc'd, when she perceiued<br>
 Her owne deare sire, she cald to him for aide.<br>
 But when of him no aunswere she receiued,<br>
 But saw him sencelesse by the Squire vpstaide,<br>
 She weened well, that then she was betraide:<br>
 Then gan she loudly cry, and weepe, and waile,<br>
 And that same Squire of treason to vpbraide.<br>
 But all in vaine, her plaints might not preuaile,<br>
 Ne none there was to reskue her, ne none to baile.</p><p>
 
 Then tooke he that same Dwarfe, and him compeld<br>
 To open vnto him the prison dore,<br>
 And forth to bring those thrals, which there he held.<br>
 Thence forth were brought to him aboue a score<br>
 Of Knights and Squires to him vnknowne afore:<br>
 All which he did from bitter bondage free,<br>
 And vnto former liberty restore.<br>
 Amongst the rest, that Squire of low degree<br>
 Came forth full weake and wan, not like him selfe to bee.</p><p>
 
 Whom soone as faire <i>AEmylia</i> beheld,<br>
 And <i>Placidas</i>, they both vnto him ran,<br>
 And him embracing fast betwixt them held,<br>
 Striuing to comfort him all that they can,<br>
 And kissing oft his visage pale and wan.<br>
 That faire <i>Poeana</i> them beholding both,<br>
 Gan both enuy, and bitterly to ban;<br>
 Through iealous passion weeping inly wroth,<br>
 To see the sight perforce, that both her eyes were loth.</p><p>
 
 But when a while they had together beene,<br>
 And diuersly conferred of their case,<br>
 She, though full oft she both of them had seene<br>
 A sunder, yet not euer in one place,<br>
 Began to doubt, when she them saw embrace,<br>
 Which was the captiue Squire she lou'd so deare,<br>
 Deceiued through great likenesse of their face.<br>
 For they so like in person did appeare,<br>
 That she vneath discerned, whether whether weare.</p><p>
 
 And eke the Prince, when as he them auized,<br>
 Their like resemblaunce much admired there,<br>
 And mazd how nature had so well disguized<br>
 Her worke, and counterfet her selfe so nere,<br>
 As if that by one patterne seene somewhere,<br>
 She had them made a paragone to be,<br>
 Or whether it through skill, or errour were.<br>
 Thus gazing long, at them much wondred he,<br>
 So did the other knights and Squires, which him did see.</p><p>
 
 Then gan they ransacke that same Castle strong,<br>
 In which he found great store of hoorded threasure,<br>
 The which that tyrant gathered had by wrong<br>
 And tortious powre, without respect or measure.<br>
 Vpon all which the Briton Prince made seasure,<br>
 And afterwards continu'd there a while,<br>
 To rest him selfe, and solace in soft pleasure<br>
 Those weaker Ladies after weary toile;<br>
 To whom he did diuide part of his purchast spoile.</p><p>
 
 And for more ioy, that captiue Lady faire<br>
 The faire <i>Poeana</i> he enlarged free;<br>
 And by the rest did set in sumptuous chaire,<br>
 To feast and frollicke; nathemore would she<br>
 Shew gladsome countenaunce nor pleasaunt glee:<br>
 But grieued was for losse both of her sire,<br>
 And eke of Lordship, with both land and fee:<br>
 But most she touched was with griefe entire,<br>
 For losse of her new loue, the hope of her desire.</p><p>
 
 But her the Prince through his well wonted grace,<br>
 To better termes of myldnesse did entreat,<br>
 From that fowle rudenesse, which did her deface;<br>
 And that same bitter corsiue, which did eat<br>
 Her tender heart, and made refraine from meat,<br>
 He with good thewes and speaches well applyde,<br>
 Did mollifie, and calme her raging heat.<br>
 For though she were most faire, and goodly dyde,<br>
 Yet she it all did mar with cruelty and pride.</p><p>
 
 And for to shut vp all in friendly loue,<br>
 Sith loue was first the ground of all her griefe,<br>
 That trusty Squire he wisely well did moue<br>
 Not to despise that dame, which lou'd him liefe,<br>
 Till he had made of her some better priefe,<br>
 But to accept her to his wedded wife.<br>
 Thereto he offred for to make him chiefe<br>
 Of all her land and lordship during life:<br>
 He yeelded, and her tooke; so stinted all their strife.</p><p>
 
 From that day forth in peace and ioyous blis,<br>
 They liu'd together long without debate:<br>
 Ne priuate iarre, ne spite of enemis<br>
 Could shake the safe assuraunce of their state.<br>
 And she whom Nature did so faire create,<br>
 That she mote match the fairest of her daies,<br>
 Yet with lewd loues and lust intemperate<br>
 Had it defaste; thenceforth reformd her waies,<br>
 That all men much admyrde her change, and spake her praise.</p><p>
 
 Thus when the Prince had perfectly compylde<br>
 These paires of friends in peace and setled rest,<br>
 Him selfe, whose minde did trauell as with chylde,<br>
 Of his old loue, conceau'd in secret brest,<br>
 Resolued to pursue his former quest;<br>
 And taking leaue of all, with him did beare<br>
 Faire <i>Amoret</i>, whom Fortune by bequest<br>
 Had left in his protection whileare,<br>
 Exchanged out of one into an other feare.</p><p>
 
 Feare of her safety did her not constraine,<br>
 For well she wist now in a mighty hond,<br>
 Her person late in perill, did remaine,<br>
 Who able was all daungers to withstond.<br>
 But now in feare of shame she more did stond,<br>
 Seeing her selfe all soly succourlesse,<br>
 Left in the victors powre, like vassall bond;<br>
 Whose will her weakenesse could no way represse,<br>
 In case his burning lust should breake into excesse.</p><p>
 
 But cause of feare sure had she none at all<br>
 Of him, who goodly learned had of yore<br>
 The course of loose affection to forstall,<br>
 And lawlesse lust to rule with reasons lore;<br>
 That all the while he by his side her bore,<br>
 She was as safe as in a Sanctuary;<br>
 Thus many miles they two together wore,<br>
 To seeke their loues dispersed diuersly,<br>
 Yet neither shewed to other their hearts priuity.</p><p>
 
 At length they came, whereas a troupe of Knights<br>
 They saw together skirmishing, as seemed:<br>
 Sixe they were all, all full of fell despight,<br>
 But foure of them the battell best beseemed,<br>
 That which of them was best, mote not be deemed.<br>
 Those foure were they, from whom false <i>Florimell</i><br>
 By <i>Braggadochio</i> lately was redeemed.<br>
 To weet, sterne <i>Druon</i>, and lewd <i>Claribell</i>,<br>
 Loue-lauish <i>Blandamour</i>, and lustfull <i>Paridell</i>.</p><p>
 
 <i>Druons</i> delight was all in single life,<br>
 And vnto Ladies loue would lend no leasure:<br>
 The more was <i>Claribell</i> enraged rife<br>
 With feruent flames, and loued out of measure:<br>
 So eke lou'd <i>Blandamour</i>, but yet at pleasure<br>
 Would change his liking, and new Lemans proue:<br>
 But <i>Paridell</i> of loue did make no threasure,<br>
 But lusted after all, that him did moue.<br>
 So diuersly these foure disposed were to loue.</p><p>
 
 But those two other which beside them stoode,<br>
 Were <i>Britomart</i>, and gentle <i>Scudamour</i>,<br>
 Who all the while beheld their wrathfull moode,<br>
 And wondred at their impacable stoure,<br>
 Whose like they neuer saw till that same houre:<br>
 So dreadfull strokes each did at other driue,<br>
 And laid on load with all their might and powre,<br>
 As if that euery dint the ghost would riue<br>
 Out of their wretched corses, and their liues depriue.</p><p>
 
 As when <i>Dan AEolus</i> in great displeasure,<br>
 For losse of his deare loue by <i>Neptune</i> hent,<br>
 Sends forth the winds out of his hidden threasure,<br>
 Vpon the sea to wreake his fell intent;<br>
 They breaking forth with rude vnruliment,<br>
 From all foure parts of heauen doe rage full sore,<br>
 And tosse the deepes, and teare the firmament,<br>
 And all the world confound with wide vprore,<br>
 As if in stead thereof they <i>Chaos</i> would restore.</p><p>
 
 Cause of their discord, and so fell debate,<br>
 Was for the loue of that same snowy maid,<br>
 Whome they had lost in Turneyment of late,<br>
 And seeking long, to weet which way she straid<br>
 Met here together; where through lewd vpbraide<br>
 Of <i>Ate</i> and <i>Duessa</i> they fell out,<br>
 And each one taking part in others aide,<br>
 This cruell conflict raised thereabout,<br>
 Whose dangerous successe depended yet in dout.</p><p>
 
 For sometimes <i>Paridell</i> and <i>Blandamour</i><br>
 The better had, and bet the others backe,<br>
 Eftsoones the others did the field recoure,<br>
 And on their foes did worke full cruell wracke:<br>
 Yet neither would their fiendlike fury slacke,<br>
 But euermore their malice did augment;<br>
 Till that vneath they forced were for lacke<br>
 Of breath, their raging rigour to relent,<br>
 And rest themselues for to recouer spirits spent.</p><p>
 
 There gan they change their sides, and new parts take;<br>
 For <i>Paridell</i> did take to <i>Druons</i> side,<br>
 For old despight, which now forth newly brake<br>
 Gainst <i>Blandamour</i>, whom alwaies he enuide:<br>
 And <i>Blandamour</i> to <i>Claribell</i> relide.<br>
 So all afresh gan former fight renew.<br>
 As when two Barkes, this caried with the tide,<br>
 That with the wind, contrary courses sew,<br>
 If wind and tide doe change, their courses change anew.</p><p>
 
 Thenceforth they much more furiously gan fare,<br>
 As if but then the battell had begonne,<br>
 Ne helmets bright, ne hawberks strong did spare,<br>
 That through the clifts the vermeil bloud out sponne,<br>
 And all adowne their riuen sides did ronne.<br>
 Such mortall malice, wonder was to see<br>
 In friends profest, and so great outrage donne:<br>
 But sooth is said, and tride in each degree,<br>
 Faint friends when they fall out, most cruell fomen bee.</p><p>
 
 Thus they long while continued in fight,<br>
 Till <i>Scudamour</i>, and that same Briton maide,<br>
 By fortune in that place did chance to light:<br>
 Whom soone as they with wrathfull eie bewraide,<br>
 They gan remember of the fowle vpbraide,<br>
 The which that Britonesse had to them donne,<br>
 In that late Turney for the snowy maide;<br>
 Where she had them both shamefully fordonne,<br>
 And eke the famous prize of beauty from them wonne.</p><p>
 
 Eftsoones all burning with a fresh desire,<br>
 Of fell reuenge, in their malicious mood<br>
 They from them selues gan turne their furious ire,<br>
 And cruell blades yet steeming with whot bloud,<br>
 Against those two let driue, as they were wood:<br>
 Who wondring much at that so sodaine fit,<br>
 Yet nought dismayd, them stoutly well withstood;<br>
 Ne yeelded foote, ne once abacke did flit,<br>
 But being doubly smitten likewise doubly smit.</p><p>
 
 The warlike Dame was on her part assaid,<br>
 Of <i>Claribell</i> and <i>Blandamour</i> attone;<br>
 And <i>Paridell</i> and <i>Druon</i> fiercely laid<br>
 At <i>Scudamour</i>, both his professed fone.<br>
 Foure charged two, and two surcharged one;<br>
 Yet did those two them selues so brauely beare,<br>
 That the other litle gained by the lone,<br>
 But with their owne repayed duely weare,<br>
 And vsury withall: such gaine was gotten deare.</p><p>
 
 Full oftentimes did <i>Britomart</i> assay<br>
 To speake to them, and some emparlance moue;<br>
 But they for nought their cruell hands would stay,<br>
 Ne lend an eare to ought, that might behoue,<br>
 As when an eager mastiffe once doth proue<br>
 The tast of bloud of some engored beast,<br>
 No words may rate, nor rigour him remoue<br>
 From greedy hold of that his blouddy feast:<br>
 So litle did they hearken to her sweet beheast.</p><p>
 
 Whom when the Briton Prince a farre beheld<br>
 With ods of so vnequall match opprest,<br>
 His mighty heart with indignation sweld,<br>
 And inward grudge fild his heroicke brest:<br>
 Eftsoones him selfe he to their aide addrest,<br>
 And thrusting fierce into the thickest preace,<br>
 Diuided them, how euer loth to rest,<br>
 And would them faine from battell to surceasse,<br>
 With gentle words perswading them to friendly peace.</p><p>
 
 But they so farre from peace or patience were,<br>
 That all at once at him gan fiercely flie,<br>
 And lay on load, as they him downe would beare;<br>
 Like to a storme, which houers vnder skie<br>
 Long here and there, and round about doth stie,<br>
 At length breakes downe in raine, and haile, and sleet,<br>
 First from one coast, till nought thereof be drie;<br>
 And then another, till that likewise fleet;<br>
 And so from side to side till all the world it weet.</p><p>
 
 But now their forces greatly were decayd,<br>
 The Prince yet being fresh vntoucht afore;<br>
 Who them with speaches milde gan first disswade<br>
 From such foule outrage, and them long forbore:<br>
 Till seeing them through suffrance hartned more,<br>
 Him selfe he bent their furies to abate,<br>
 And layd at them so sharpely and so sore,<br>
 That shortly them compelled to retrate,<br>
 And being brought in daunger, to relent too late.</p><p>
 
 But now his courage being throughly fired,<br>
 He ment to make them know their follies prise,<br>
 Had not those two him instantly desired<br>
 T'asswage his wrath, and pardon their mesprise.<br>
 At whose request he gan him selfe aduise<br>
 To stay his hand, and of a truce to treat<br>
 In milder tearmes, as list them to deuise:<br>
 Mongst which the cause of their so cruell heat<br>
 He did them aske, who all that passed gan repeat.</p><p>
 
 And told at large how that same errant Knight,<br>
 To weet faire <i>Britomart</i>, them late had foyled<br>
 In open turney, and by wrongfull fight<br>
 Both of their publicke praise had them despoyled,<br>
 And also of their priuate loues beguyled;<br>
 Of two full hard to read the harder theft.<br>
 But she that wrongfull challenge soone assoyled,<br>
 And shew'd that she had not that Lady reft,<br>
 (As they supposd) but her had to her liking left.</p><p>
 
 To whom the Prince thus goodly well replied;<br>
 Certes sir Knight[s], ye seemen much to blame,<br>
 To rip vp wrong, that battell once hath tried;<br>
 Wherein the honor both of Armes ye shame,<br>
 And eke the loue of Ladies foule defame;<br>
 To whom the world this franchise euer yeelded,<br>
 That of their loues choise they might freedom clame,<br>
 And in that right should by all knights be shielded:<br>
 Gainst which me seemes this war ye wrongfully haue wielded.</p><p>
 
 And yet (quoth she) a greater wrong remaines:<br>
 For I thereby my former loue haue lost,<br>
 Whom seeking euer since with endlesse paines,<br>
 Hath me much sorrow and much trauell cost;<br>
 Aye me to see that gentle maide so tost.<br>
 But <i>Scudamour</i> then sighing deepe, thus saide,<br>
 Certes her losse ought me to sorrow most,<br>
 Whose right she is, where euer she be straide,<br>
 Through many perils wonne, and many fortunes waide.</p><p>
 
 For from the first that I her loue profest,<br>
 Vnto this houre, this present lucklesse howre,<br>
 I neuer ioyed happinesse nor rest,<br>
 But thus turmoild from one to other stowre,<br>
 I wast my life, and doe my daies deuowre<br>
 In wretched anguishe and incessant woe,<br>
 Passing the measure of my feeble powre,<br>
 That liuing thus, a wretch and louing so,<br>
 I neither can my loue, ne yet my life forgo.</p><p>
 
 Then good sir <i>Claribell</i> him thus bespake,<br>
 Now were it not sir <i>Scudamour</i> to you,<br>
 Dislikefull paine, so sad a taske to take,<br>
 Mote we entreat you, sith this gentle crew<br>
 Is now so well accorded all anew;<br>
 That as we ride together on our way,<br>
 Ye will recount to vs in order dew<br>
 All that aduenture, which ye did assay<br>
 For that faire Ladies loue: past perils well apay.</p><p>
 
 So gan the rest him likewise to require,<br>
 But <i>Britomart</i> did him importune hard,<br>
 To take on him that paine: whose great desire<br>
 He glad to satisfie, him selfe prepar'd<br>
 To tell through what misfortune he had far'd,<br>
 In that atchieuement, as to him befell.<br>
 And all those daungers vnto them declar'd,<br>
 Which sith they cannot in this Canto well<br>
 Comprised be, I will them in another tell.</p><p>
