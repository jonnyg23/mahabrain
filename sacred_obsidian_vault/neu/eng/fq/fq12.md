 <center> <i>Cant. 
 XII. </i></center><p> 
  
 </p><p> 
 </p><blockquote> 
  
  
 <i>Faire Vna to the Redcrosse knight<br> 
 betrouthed is with ioy:<br>  
 Though false Duessa it to barre<br>  
 her false sleights doe imploy. </i><p> 
 </p></blockquote> 
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>     
 BEhold I see the hauen nigh at hand,<br>
 To which I meane my wearie course to bend;<br>
 Vere the maine shete, and beare vp with the land,<br>
 The which afore is fairely to be kend,<br>
 And seemeth safe from stormes, that may offend;<br>
 There this faire virgin wearie of her way<br>
 Must landed be, now at her iourneyes end:<br>
 There eke my feeble barke a while may stay,<br>
 Till merry wind and weather call her thence away.<p>
  
 Scarsely had <i>Phoebus</i> in the glooming East<br>
 Yet harnessed his firie-footed teeme,<br>
 Ne reard aboue the earth his flaming creast,<br>
 When the last deadly smoke aloft did steeme,<br>
 That signe of last outbreathed life did seeme,<br>
 Vnto the watchman on the castle wall;<br>
 Who thereby dead that balefull Beast did deeme,<br>
 And to his Lord and Ladie lowd gan call,<br>
 To tell, how he had seene the Dragons fatall fall.</p><p>
  
 Vprose with hastie ioy, and feeble speed<br>
 That aged Sire, the Lord of all that land,<br>
 And looked forth, to weet, if true indeede<br>
 Those tydings were, as he did vnderstand,<br>
 Which whenas true by tryall he out fond,<br>
 He bad to open wyde his brazen gate,<br>
 Which long time had bene shut, and out of hond<br>
 Proclaymed ioy and peace through all his state;<br>
 For dead now was their foe, which them forrayed late.</p><p>
  
 Then gan triumphant Trompets sound on hie,<br>
 That sent to heauen the ecchoed report<br>
 Of their new ioy, and happie victorie<br>
 Gainst him, that had them long opprest with tort,<br>
 And fast imprisoned in sieged fort.<br>
 Then all the people, as in solemne feast,<br>
 To him assembled with one full consort,<br>
 Reioycing at the fall of that great beast,<br>
 From whose eternall bondage now they were releast.</p><p>
  
 Forth came that auncient Lord and aged Queene,<br>
 Arayd in antique robes downe to the ground,<br>
 And sad habiliments right well beseene;<br>
 A noble crew about them waited round<br>
 Of sage and sober Peres, all grauely gownd;<br>
 Whom farre before did march a goodly band<br>
 Of tall young men, all hable armes to sownd,<br>
 But now they laurell braunches bore in hand;<br>
 Glad signe of victorie and peace in all their land.</p><p>
  
 Vnto that doughtie Conquerour they came,<br>
 And him before themselues prostrating low,<br>
 Their Lord and Patrone loud did him proclame,<br>
 And at his feet their laurell boughes did throw.<br>
 Soone after them all dauncing on a row<br>
 The comely virgins came, with girlands dight,<br>
 As fresh as flowres in medow greene do grow,<br>
 When morning deaw vpon their leaues doth light:<br>
 And in their hands sweet Timbrels all vpheld on hight.</p><p>
  
 And them before, the fry of children young<br>
 Their wanton sports and childish mirth did play,<br>
 And to the Maydens sounding tymbrels sung<br>
 In well attuned notes, a ioyous lay,<br>
 And made delightfull musicke all the way,<br>
 Vntill they came, where that faire virgin stood;<br>
 As faire <i>Diana</i> in fresh sommers day<br>
 Beholds her Nymphes, enraung'd in shadie wood,<br>
 Some wrestle, some do run, some bathe in christall flood.</p><p>
  
 So she beheld those maydens meriment<br>
 With chearefull vew; who when to her they came,<br>
 Themselues to ground with gratious humblesse bent,<br>
 And her ador'd by honorable name,<br>
 Lifting to heauen her euerlasting fame:<br>
 Then on her head they set a girland greene,<br>
 And crowned her twixt earnest and twixt game;<br>
 Who in her selfe-resemblance well beseene,<br>
 Did seeme such, as she was, a goodly maiden Queene.</p><p>
  
 And after, all the raskall many ran,<br>
 Heaped together in rude rablement<br>
 To see the face of that victorious man:<br>
 Whom all admired, as from heauen sent,<br>
 And gazd vpon with gaping wonderment.<br>
 But when they came, where that dead Dragon lay,<br>
 Stretcht on the ground in monstrous large extent,<br>
 The sight with idle feare did them dismay,<br>
 Ne durst approch him nigh, to touch, or once assay.</p><p>
  
 Some feard, and fled; some feard and well it faynd;<br>
 One that would wiser seeme, then all the rest,<br>
 Warnd him not touch, for yet perhaps remaynd<br>
 Some lingring life within his hollow brest,<br>
 Or in his wombe might lurke some hidden nest<br>
 Of many Dragonets, his fruitfull seed;<br>
 Another said, that in his eyes did rest<br>
 Yet sparckling fire, and bad thereof take heed;<br>
 Another said, he saw him moue his eyes indeed.</p><p>
  
 One mother, when as her foolehardie chyld<br>
 Did come too neare, and with his talants play,<br>
 Halfe dead through feare, her litle babe reuyld,<br>
 And to her gossips gan in counsell say;<br>
 How can I tell, but that his talants may<br>
 Yet scratch my sonne, or rend his tender hand?<br>
 So diuersly themselues in vaine they fray;<br>
 Whiles some more bold, to measure him nigh stand,<br>
 To proue how many acres he did spread of land.</p><p>
  
 Thus flocked all the folke him round about,<br>
 The whiles that hoarie king, with all his traine,<br>
 Being arriued, where that champion stout<br>
 After his foes defeasance did remaine,<br>
 Him goodly greetes, and faire does entertaine,<br>
 With princely gifts of yuorie and gold,<br>
 And thousand thankes him yeelds for all his paine.<br>
 Then when his daughter deare he does behold,<br>
 Her dearely doth imbrace, and kisseth manifold.</p><p>
  
 And after to his Pallace he them brings,<br>
 With shaumes, &amp; trompets, &amp;amp with Clarions sweet;<br>
 And all the way the ioyous people sings,<br>
 And with their garments strowes the paued street:<br>
 Whence mounting vp, they find purueyance meet<br>
 Of all, that royall Princes court became,<br>
 And all the floore was vnderneath their feet<br>
 Bespred with costly scarlot of great name,<br>
 On which they lowly sit, and fitting purpose frame.</p><p>
  
 What needs me tell their feast and goodly guize,<br>
 In which was nothing riotous nor vaine?<br>
 What needs of daintie dishes to deuize,<br>
 Of comely seruices, or courtly trayne?<br>
 My narrow leaues cannot in them containe<br>
 The large discourse of royall Princes state.<br>
 Yet was their manner then but bare and plaine:<br>
 For th'antique world excesse and pride did hate;<br>
 Such proud luxurious pompe is swollen vp but late.</p><p>
  
 Then when with meates and drinkes of euery kinde<br>
 Their feruent appetites they quenched had,<br>
 That auncient Lord gan fit occasion finde,<br>
 Of straunge aduentures, and of perils sad,<br>
 Which in his trauell him befallen had,<br>
 For to demaund of his renowmed guest:<br>
 Who then with vtt'rance graue, and count'nance sad<br>
 From point to point, as is before exprest,<br>
 Discourst his voyage long, according his request.</p><p>
  
 Great pleasure mixt with pittifull regard,<br>
 That godly King and Queene did passionate,<br>
 Whiles they his pittifull aduentures heard,<br>
 That oft they did lament his lucklesse state,<br>
 And often blame the too importune fate,<br>
 That heapd on him so many wrathfull wreakes:<br>
 For neuer gentle knight, as he of late,<br>
 So tossed was in fortunes cruell freakes;<br>
 And all the while salt teares bedeawd the hearers cheaks.</p><p>
  
 Then said that royall Pere in sober wise;<br>
 Deare Sonne, great beene the euils, which ye bore<br>
 From first to last in your late enterprise,<br>
 That I note, whether prayse, or pitty more:<br>
 For neuer liuing man, I weene, so sore<br>
 In sea of deadly daungers was distrest;<br>
 But since now safe ye seised haue the shore,<br>
 And well arriued are, (high God be blest)<br>
 Let vs deuize of ease and euerlasting rest.</p><p>
  
 Ah dearest Lord, said then that doughty knight,<br>
 Of ease or rest I may not yet deuize;<br>
 For by the faith, which I to armes haue plight,<br>
 I bounden am streight after this emprize,<br>
 As that your daughter can ye well aduize,<br>
 Backe to returne to that great Faerie Queene,<br>
 And her to serue six yeares in warlike wize,<br>
 Gainst that proud Paynim king, that workes her teene:<br>
 Therefore I ought craue pardon, till I there haue beene.</p><p>
  
 Vnhappie falles that hard necessitie,<br>
 (Quoth he) the troubler of my happie peace,<br>
 And vowed foe of my felicitie;<br>
 Ne I against the same can iustly preace:<br>
 But since that band ye cannot now release,<br>
 Nor doen vndo; (for vowes may not be vaine)<br>
 Soone as the terme of those six yeares shall cease,<br>
 Ye then shall hither backe returne againe,<br>
 The marriage to accomplish vowd betwixt you twain.</p><p>
  
 Which for my part I couet to performe,<br>
 In sort as through the world I did proclame,<br>
 That who so kild that monster most deforme,<br>
 And him in hardy battaile ouercame,<br>
 Should haue mine onely daughter to his Dame,<br>
 And of my kingdome heire apparaunt bee:<br>
 Therefore since now to thee perteines the same,<br>
 By dew desert of noble cheualree,<br>
 Both daughter and eke kingdome, lo I yield to thee.</p><p>
  
 Then forth he called that his daughter faire,<br>
 The fairest <i>Vn'</i> his onely daughter deare,<br>
 His onely daughter, and his onely heyre;<br>
 Who forth proceeding with sad sober cheare,<br>
 As bright as doth the morning starre appeare<br>
 Out of the East, with flaming lockes bedight,<br>
 To tell that dawning day is drawing neare,<br>
 And to the world does bring long wished light;<br>
 So faire and fresh that Lady shewd her selfe in sight.</p><p>
  
 So faire and fresh, as freshest flowre in May;<br>
 For she had layd her mournefull stole aside,<br>
 And widow-like sad wimple throwne away,<br>
 Wherewith her heauenly beautie she did hide,<br>
 Whiles on her wearie iourney she did ride;<br>
 And on her now a garment she did weare,<br>
 All lilly white, withoutten spot, or pride,<br>
 That seemd like silke and siluer wouen neare,<br>
 But neither silke nor siluer therein did appeare.</p><p>
  
 The blazing brightnesse of her beauties beame,<br>
 And glorious light of her sunshyny face<br>
 To tell, were as to striue against the streame.<br>
 My ragged rimes are all too rude and bace,<br>
 Her heauenly lineaments for to enchace.<br>
 Ne wonder; for her owne deare loued knight,<br>
 All were she dayly with himselfe in place,<br>
 Did wonder much at her celestiall sight:<br>
 Oft had he seene her faire, but neuer so faire dight.</p><p>
  
 So fairely dight, when she in presence came,<br>
 She to her Sire made humble reuerence,<br>
 And bowed low, that her right well became,<br>
 And added grace vnto her excellence:<br>
 Who with great wisedome, and graue eloquence<br>
 Thus gan to say. But eare he thus had said,<br>
 With flying speede, and seeming great pretence,<br>
 Came running in, much like a man dismaid,<br>
 A Messenger with letters, which his message said.</p><p>
  
 All in the open hall amazed stood,<br>
 At suddeinnesse of that vnwarie sight,<br>
 And wondred at his breathlesse hastie mood.<br>
 But he for nought would stay his passage right,<br>
 Till fast before the king he did alight;<br>
 Where falling flat, great humblesse he did make,<br>
 And kist the ground, whereon his foot was pight;<br>
 Then to his hands that writ he did betake,<br>
 Which he disclosing, red thus, as the paper spake.</p><p>
  
 To thee, most mighty king of <i>Eden</i> faire,<br>
 Her greeting sends in these sad lines addrest,<br>
 The wofull daughter, and forsaken heire<br>
 Of that great Emperour of all the West;<br>
 And bids thee be aduized for the best,<br>
 Ere thou thy daughter linck in holy band<br>
 Of wedlocke to that new vnknowen guest:<br>
 For he already plighted his right hand<br>
 Vnto another loue, and to another land.</p><p>
  
 To me sad mayd, or rather widow sad,<br>
 He was affiaunced long time before,<br>
 And sacred pledges he both gaue, and had,<br>
 False erraunt knight, infamous, and forswore:<br>
 Witnesse the burning Altars, which he swore,<br>
 And guiltie heauens of his bold periury,<br>
 Which though he hath polluted oft of yore,<br>
 Yet I to them for iudgement iust do fly,<br>
 And them coniure t'auenge this shamefull iniury.</p><p>
  
 Therefore since mine he is, or free or bond,<br>
 Or false or trew, or liuing or else dead,<br>
 Withhold, O soueraine Prince, your hasty hond<br>
 From knitting league with him, I you aread;<br>
 Ne weene my right with strength adowne to tread,<br>
 Through weakenesse of my widowhed, or woe:<br>
 For truth is strong, her rightfull cause to plead,<br>
 And shall find friends, if need requireth soe,<br>
 So bids thee well to fare, Thy neither friend, nor foe, <i>Fidessa</i>.</p><p>
  
 When he these bitter byting words had red,<br>
 The tydings straunge did him abashed make,<br>
 That still he sate long time astonished<br>
 As in great muse, ne word to creature spake.<br>
 At last his solemne silence thus he brake,<br>
 With doubtfull eyes fast fixed on his guest;<br>
 Redoubted knight, that for mine onely sake<br>
 Thy life and honour late aduenturest,<br>
 Let nought be hid from me, that ought to be exprest.</p><p>
  
 What meane these bloudy vowes, and idle threats,<br>
 Throwne out from womanish impatient mind?<br>
 What heauens? what altars? what enraged heates<br>
 Here heaped vp with termes of loue vnkind,<br>
 My conscience cleare with guilty bands would bind?<br>
 High God be witnesse, that I guiltlesse ame.<br>
 But if your selfe, Sir knight, ye faultie find,<br>
 Or wrapped be in loues of former Dame,<br>
 With crime do not it couer, but disclose the same.</p><p>
  
 To whom the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight this answere sent,<br>
 My Lord, my King, be nought hereat dismayd,<br>
 Till well ye wote by graue intendiment,<br>
 What woman, and wherefore doth me vpbrayd<br>
 With breach of loue, and loyalty betrayd.<br>
 It was in my mishaps, as hitherward<br>
 I lately traueild, that vnwares I strayd<br>
 Out of my way, through perils straunge and hard;<br>
 That day should faile me, ere I had them all declard.</p><p>
  
 There did I find, or rather I was found<br>
 Of this false woman, that <i>Fidessa</i> hight,<br>
 <i>Fidessa</i> hight the falsest Dame on ground,<br>
 Most false <i>Duessa</i>, royall richly dight,<br>
 That easie was t'inuegle weaker sight:<br>
 Who by her wicked arts, and wylie skill,<br>
 Too false and strong for earthly skill or might,<br>
 Vnwares me wrought vnto her wicked will,<br>
 And to my foe betrayd, when least I feared ill.</p><p>
  
 Then stepped forth the goodly royall Mayd,<br>
 And on the ground her selfe prostrating low,<br>
 With sober countenaunce thus to him sayd;<br>
 O pardon me, my soueraigne Lord, to show<br>
 The secret treasons, which of late I know<br>
 To haue bene wroght by that false sorceresse.<br>
 She onely she it is, that earst did throw<br>
 This gentle knight into so great distresse,<br>
 That death him did awaite in dayly wretchednesse.</p><p>
  
 And now it seemes, that she suborned hath<br>
 This craftie messenger with letters vaine,<br>
 To worke new woe and improuided scath,<br>
 By breaking of the band betwixt vs twaine;<br>
 Wherein she vsed hath the practicke paine<br>
 Of this false footman, clokt with simplenesse,<br>
 Whom if ye please for to discouer plaine,<br>
 Ye shall him <i>Archimago</i> find, I ghesse,<br>
 The falsest man aliue; who tries shall find no lesse.</p><p>
  
 The king was greatly moued at her speach,<br>
 And all with suddein indignation fraight,<br>
 Bad on that Messenger rude hands to reach.<br>
 Eftsoones the Gard, which on his state did wait,<br>
 Attacht that faitor false, and bound him strait:<br>
 Who seeming sorely chauffed at his band,<br>
 As chained Beare, whom cruell dogs do bait,<br>
 With idle force did faine them to withstand,<br>
 And often semblaunce made to scape out of their hand.</p><p>
  
 But they him layd full low in dungeon deepe,<br>
 And bound him hand and foote with yron chains.<br>
 And with continuall watch did warely keepe;<br>
 Who then would thinke, that by his subtile trains<br>
 He could escape fowle death or deadly paines?<br>
 Thus when that Princes wrath was pacifide,<br>
 He gan renew the late forbidden banes,<br>
 And to the knight his daughter deare he tyde,<br>
 With sacred rites and vowes for euer to abyde.</p><p>
  
 His owne two hands the holy knots did knit,<br>
 That none but death for euer can deuide;<br>
 His owne two hands, for such a turne most fit,<br>
 The housling fire did kindle and prouide,<br>
 And holy water thereon sprinckled wide;<br>
 At which the bushy Teade a groome did light,<br>
 And sacred lampe in secret chamber hide,<br>
 Where it should not be quenched day nor night,<br>
 For feare of euill fates, but burnen euer bright.</p><p>
  
 Then gan they sprinckle all the posts with wine,<br>
 And made great feast to solemnize that day;<br>
 They all perfumde with frankincense diuine,<br>
 And precious odours fetcht from far away,<br>
 That all the house did sweat with great aray:<br>
 And all the while sweete Musicke did apply<br>
 Her curious skill, the warbling notes to play,<br>
 To driue away the dull Melancholy;<br>
 The whiles one sung a song of loue and iollity.</p><p>
  
 During the which there was an heauenly noise<br>
 Heard sound through all the Pallace pleasantly,<br>
 Like as it had bene many an Angels voice,<br>
 Singing before th'eternall maiesty,<br>
 In their trinall triplicities on hye;<br>
 Yet wist no creature, whence that heauenly sweet<br>
 Proceeded, yet each one felt secretly<br>
 Himselfe thereby reft of his sences meet,<br>
 And rauished with rare impression in his sprite.</p><p>
  
 Great ioy was made that day of young and old,<br>
 And solemne feast proclaimd throughout the land,<br>
 That their exceeding merth may not be told:<br>
 Suffice it heare by signes to vnderstand<br>
 The vsuall ioyes at knitting of loues band.<br>
 Thrise happy man the knight himselfe did hold,<br>
 Possessed of his Ladies hart and hand,<br>
 And euer, when his eye did her behold,<br>
 His heart did seeme to melt in pleasures manifold.</p><p>
  
 Her ioyous presence and sweet company<br>
 In full content he there did long enioy,<br>
 Ne wicked enuie, ne vile gealosy<br>
 His deare delights were able to annoy:<br>
 Yet swimming in that sea of blisfull ioy,<br>
 He nought forgot, how he whilome had sworne,<br>
 In case he could that monstrous beast destroy,<br>
 Vnto his Farie Queene backe to returne:<br>
 The which he shortly did, and <i>Vna</i> left to mourne.</p><p>
  
 Now strike your sailes ye iolly Mariners,<br>
 For we be come vnto a quiet rode,<br>
 Where we must land some of our passengers,<br>
 And light this wearie vessell of her lode.<br>
 Here she a while may make her safe abode,<br>
 Till she repaired haue her tackles spent,<br>
 And wants supplide. And then againe abroad<br>
 On the long voyage whereto she is bent:<br>
 Well may she speede and fairely finish her intent.</p><p>
