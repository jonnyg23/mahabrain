 <i>The spousals of faire Florimell,<br>
 where turney many knights:<br>
 There Braggadochio is vncas'd<br>
 in all the Ladies sights.</i><p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 A
 Fter long stormes and tempests ouerblowne,<br>
 The sunne at length his ioyous face doth cleare:<br>
 So when as fortune all her spight hath showne,<br>
 Some blisfull houres at last must needes appeare;<br>
 Else should afflicted wights oftimes despeire.<br>
 So comes it now to <i>Florimell</i> by tourne,<br>
 After long sorrowes suffered whyleare,<br>
 In which captiu'd she many moneths did mourne,<br>
 To tast of ioy, and to wont pleasures to retourne.<p>
 
 Who being freed from <i>Proteus</i> cruell band<br>
 By <i>Marinell</i>, was vnto him affide,<br>
 And by him brought againe to Faerie land;<br>
 Where he her spous'd, and made his ioyous bride.<br>
 The time and place was blazed farre and wide;<br>
 And solemne feasts and giusts ordain'd therefore.<br>
 To which there did resort from euery side<br>
 Of Lords and Ladies infinite great store;<br>
 Ne any Knight was absent, that braue courage bore.</p><p>
 
 To tell the glorie of the feast that day,<br>
 The goodly seruice, the deuicefull sights,<br>
 The bridegromes state, the brides most rich array,<br>
 The pride of Ladies, and the worth of knights,<br>
 The royall banquets, and the rare delights,<br>
 Were worke fit for an Herauld, not for me:<br>
 But for so much as to my lot here lights,<br>
 That with this present treatise doth agree,<br>
 True vertue to aduance, shall here recounted bee.</p><p>
 
 When all men had with full satietie<br>
 Of meates and drinkes their appetites suffiz'd,<br>
 To deedes of armes and proofe of cheualrie<br>
 They gan themselues addresse, full rich aguiz'd,<br>
 As each one had his furnitures deuiz'd.<br>
 And first of all issu'd Sir <i>Marinell</i>,<br>
 And with him sixe knights more, which enterpriz'd<br>
 To chalenge all in right of <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
 And to maintaine, that she all others did excell.</p><p>
 
 The first of them was hight Sir <i>Orimont</i>,<br>
 A noble Knight, and tride in hard assayes:<br>
 The second had to name Sir <i>Bellisont</i>,<br>
 But second vnto none in prowesse prayse;<br>
 The third was <i>Brunell</i>, famous in his dayes;<br>
 The fourth <i>Ecastor</i>, of exceeding might;<br>
 The fift <i>Armeddan</i>, skild in louely layes;<br>
 The sixt was <i>Lansack</i>, a redoubted Knight:<br>
 All sixe well seene in armes, and prou'd in many a fight.</p><p>
 
 And them against came all that list to giust,<br>
 From euery coast and countrie vnder sunne:<br>
 None was debard, but all had leaue that lust.<br>
 The trompets sound; then all together ronne.<br>
 Full many deedes of armes that day were donne,<br>
 And many knights vnhorst, and many wounded,<br>
 As fortune fell; yet litle lost or wonne:<br>
 But all that day the greatest prayse redounded<br>
 To <i>Marinell</i>, whose name the Heralds loud resounded.</p><p>
 
 The second day, so soone as morrow light<br>
 Appear'd in heauen, into the field they came,<br>
 And there all day continew'd cruell fight,<br>
 With diuers fortune fit for such a game,<br>
 In which all stroue with perill to winne fame.<br>
 Yet whether side was victor, note be ghest:<br>
 But at the last the trompets did proclame<br>
 That <i>Marinell</i> that day deserued best.<br>
 So they disparted were, and all men went to rest.</p><p>
 
 The third day came, that should due tryall lend<br>
 Of all the rest, and then this warlike crew<br>
 Together met, of all to make an end.<br>
 There <i>Marinell</i> great deeds of armes did shew;<br>
 And through the thickest like a Lyon flew,<br>
 Rashing off helmes, and ryuing plates a sonder,<br>
 That euery one his daunger did eschew.<br>
 So terribly his dreadfull strokes did thonder,<br>
 That all men stood amaz'd, &amp; at his might did wonder.</p><p>
 
 But what on earth can alwayes happie stand?<br>
 The greater prowesse greater perils find.<br>
 So farre he past amongst his enemies band,<br>
 That they haue him enclosed so behind,<br>
 As by no meanes he can himselfe outwind.<br>
 And now perforce they haue him prisoner taken;<br>
 And now they doe with captiue bands him bind;<br>
 And now they lead him thence, of all forsaken,<br>
 Vnlesse some succour had in time him ouertaken.</p><p>
 
 It fortun'd whylest they were thus ill beset,<br>
 Sir <i>Artegall</i> into the Tilt-yard came,<br>
 With <i>Braggadochio</i>, whom he lately met<br>
 Vpon the way, with that his snowy Dame.<br>
 Where when he vnderstood by common fame,<br>
 What euill hap to <i>Marinell</i> betid,<br>
 He much was mou'd at so vnworthie shame,<br>
 And streight that boaster prayd, with whom he rid,<br>
 To change his shield with him, to be better hid.</p><p>
 
 So forth he went, and soone them ouer hent,<br>
 Where they were leading <i>Marinell</i> away,<br>
 Whom he assayld with dreadlesse hardiment,<br>
 And forst the burden of their prize to stay.<br>
 They were an hundred knights of that array;<br>
 Of which th'one halfe vpon himselfe did set,<br>
 The other stayd behind to gard the pray.<br>
 But he ere long the former fiftie bet;<br>
 And from the other fiftie soone the prisoner fet.</p><p>
 
 So backe he brought Sir <i>Marinell</i> againe;<br>
 Whom hauing quickly arm'd againe anew,<br>
 They both together ioyned might and maine,<br>
 To set afresh on all the other crew.<br>
 Whom with sore hauocke soone they ouerthrew,<br>
 And chaced quite out of the field, that none<br>
 Against them durst his head to perill shew.<br>
 So were they left Lords of the field alone:<br>
 So <i>Marinell</i> by him was rescu'd from his fone.</p><p>
 
 Which when he had perform'd, then backe againe<br>
 To <i>Braggadochio</i> did his shield restore:<br>
 Who all this while behind him did remaine,<br>
 Keeping there close with him in pretious store<br>
 That his false Ladie, as ye heard afore.<br>
 Then did the trompets sound, and Iudges rose,<br>
 And all these knights, which that day armour bore,<br>
 Came to the open hall, to listen whose<br>
 The honour of the prize should be adiudg'd by those.</p><p>
 
 And thether also came in open sight<br>
 Fayre <i>Florimell</i>, into the common hall,<br>
 To greet his guerdon vnto euery knight,<br>
 And best to him, to whom the best should fall.<br>
 Then for that stranger knight they loud did call,<br>
 To whom that day they should the girlond yield.<br>
 Who came not forth, but for Sir <i>Artegall</i><br>
 Came <i>Braggadochio</i>, and did shew his shield,<br>
 Which bore the Sunne brode blazed in a golden field.</p><p>
 
 The sight whereof did all with gladnesse fill:<br>
 So vnto him they did addeeme the prise<br>
 Of all that Tryumph.  Then the trompets shrill<br>
 Don <i>Braggadochios</i> name resounded thrise:<br>
 So courage lent a cloke to cowardise.<br>
 And then to him came fayrest <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
 And goodly gan to greet his braue emprise,<br>
 And thousand thankes him yeeld, that had so well<br>
 Approu'd that day, that she all others did excell.</p><p>
 
 To whom the boaster, that all knights did blot,<br>
 With proud disdaine did scornefull answere make;<br>
 That what he did that day, he did it not<br>
 For her, but for his owne deare Ladies sake,<br>
 Whom on his perill he did vndertake,<br>
 Both her and eke all others to excell:<br>
 And further did vncomely speaches crake.<br>
 Much did his words the gentle Ladie quell,<br>
 And turn'd aside for shame to heare, what he did tell.</p><p>
 
 Then forth he brought his snowy <i>Florimele</i>,<br>
 Whom <i>Trompart</i> had in keeping there beside,<br>
 Couered from peoples gazement with a vele.<br>
 Whom when discouered they had throughly eide,<br>
 With great amazement they were stupefide;<br>
 And said, that surely <i>Florimell</i> it was,<br>
 Or if it were not <i>Florimell</i> so tride,<br>
 That <i>Florimell</i> her selfe she then did pas.<br>
 So feeble skill of perfect things the vulgar has.</p><p>
 
 Which when as <i>Marinell</i> beheld likewise,<br>
 He was therewith exceedingly dismayd;<br>
 Ne wist he what to thinke, or to deuise,<br>
 But like as one, whom feends had made affrayd,<br>
 He long astonisht stood, ne ought he sayd,<br>
 Ne ought he did, but with fast fixed eies<br>
 He gazed still vpon that snowy mayd;<br>
 Whom euer as he did the more auize,<br>
 The more to be true <i>Florimell</i> he did surmize.</p><p>
 
 As when two sunnes appeare in the azure skye,<br>
 Mounted in <i>Phoebus</i> charet fierie bright,<br>
 Both darting forth faire beames to each mans eye,<br>
 And both adorn'd with lampes of flaming light,<br>
 All that behold so strange prodigious sight,<br>
 Not knowing natures worke, nor what to weene,<br>
 Are rapt with wonder, and with rare affright.<br>
 So stood Sir <i>Marinell</i>, when he had seene<br>
 The semblant of this false by his faire beauties Queene.</p><p>
 
 All which when <i>Artegall</i>, who all this while<br>
 Stood in the preasse close couered, well aduewed,<br>
 And saw that boasters pride and gracelesse guile,<br>
 He could no longer beare, but forth issewed,<br>
 And vnto all himselfe there open shewed,<br>
 And to the boaster said; Thou losell base,<br>
 That hast with borrowed plumes thy selfe endewed,<br>
 And others worth with leasings doest deface,<br>
 When they are all restor'd, thou shalt rest in disgrace.</p><p>
 
 That shield, which thou doest beare, was it indeed,<br>
 Which this dayes honour sau'd to <i>Marinell</i>;<br>
 But not that arme, nor thou the man I reed,<br>
 Which didst that seruice vnto <i>Florimell</i>.<br>
 For proofe shew forth thy sword, and let it tell,<br>
 What strokes, what dreadfull stoure it stird this day:<br>
 Or shew the wounds, which vnto thee befell;<br>
 Or shew the sweat, with which thou diddest sway<br>
 So sharpe a battell, that so many did dismay.</p><p>
 
 But this the sword, which wrought those cruell stounds,<br>
 And this the arme, the which that shield did beare,<br>
 And these the signes, (so shewed forth his wounds)<br>
 By which that glorie gotten doth appeare.<br>
 As for this Ladie, which he sheweth here,<br>
 Is not (I wager) <i>Florimell</i> at all;<br>
 But some fayre Franion, fit for such a fere,<br>
 That by misfortune in his hand did fall.<br>
 For proofe whereof, he bad them <i>Florimell</i> forth call.</p><p>
 
 So forth the noble Ladie was ybrought,<br>
 Adorn'd with honor and all comely grace:<br>
 Whereto her bashfull shamefastnesse ywrought<br>
 A great increase in her faire blushing face;<br>
 As roses did with lillies interlace.<br>
 For of those words, the which that boaster threw,<br>
 She inly yet conceiued great disgrace.<br>
 Whom when as all the people such did vew,<br>
 They shouted loud, and signes of gladnesse all did shew.</p><p>
 
 Then did he set her by that snowy one,<br>
 Like the true saint beside the image set,<br>
 Of both their beauties to make paragone,<br>
 And triall, whether should the honor get.<br>
 Streight way so soone as both together met,<br>
 Th'enchaunted Damzell vanisht into nought:<br>
 Her snowy substance melted as with heat,<br>
 Ne of that goodly hew remayned ought,<br>
 But th'emptie girdle, which about her wast was wrought.</p><p>
 
 As when the daughter of <i>Thaumantes</i> faire,<br>
 Hath in a watry cloud displayed wide<br>
 Her goodly bow, which paints the liquid ayre;<br>
 That all men wonder at her colours pride;<br>
 All suddenly, ere one can looke aside,<br>
 The glorious picture vanisheth away,<br>
 Ne any token doth thereof abide:<br>
 So did this Ladies goodly forme decay,<br>
 And into nothing goe, ere one could it bewray.</p><p>
 
 Which when as all that present were, beheld,<br>
 They stricken were with great astonishment,<br>
 And their faint harts with senselesse horrour queld,<br>
 To see the thing, that seem'd so excellent,<br>
 So stolen from their fancies wonderment;<br>
 That what of it became, none vnderstood.<br>
 And <i>Braggadochio</i> selfe with dreriment<br>
 So daunted was in his despeyring mood,<br>
 That like a lifelesse corse immoueable he stood.</p><p>
 
 But <i>Artegall</i> that golden belt vptooke,<br>
 The which of all her spoyle was onely left;<br>
 Which was not hers, as many it mistooke,<br>
 But <i>Florimells</i> owne girdle, from her reft,<br>
 While she was flying, like a weary weft,<br>
 From that foule monster, which did her compell<br>
 To perils great; which he vnbuckling eft,<br>
 Presented to the fayrest <i>Florimell</i>;<br>
 Who round about her tender wast it fitted well.</p><p>
 
 Full many Ladies often had assayd,<br>
 About their middles that faire belt to knit;<br>
 And many a one suppos'd to be a mayd:<br>
 Yet it to none of all their loynes would fit,<br>
 Till <i>Florimell</i> about her fastned it.<br>
 Such power it had, that to no womans wast<br>
 By any skill or labour it would sit,<br>
 Vnlesse that she were continent and chast,<br>
 But it would lose or breake, that many had disgrast.</p><p>
 
 Whilest thus they busied were bout <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
 And boastfull <i>Braggadochio</i> to defame,<br>
 Sir <i>Guyon</i> as by fortune then befell,<br>
 Forth from the thickest preasse of people came,<br>
 His owne good steed, which he had stolne, to clame;<br>
 And th'one hand seizing on his golden bit,<br>
 With th'other drew his sword: for with the same<br>
 He ment the thiefe there deadly to haue smit:<br>
 And had he not bene held, he nought had fayld of it.</p><p>
 
 Thereof great hurly burly moued was<br>
 Throughout the hall, for that same warlike horse.<br>
 For <i>Braggadochio</i> would not let him pas;<br>
 And <i>Guyon</i> would him algates haue perforse,<br>
 Or it approue vpon his carrion corse.<br>
 Which troublous stirre when <i>Artegall</i> perceiued,<br>
 He nigh them drew to stay th'auengers forse,<br>
 And gan inquire, how was that steed bereaued,<br>
 Whether by might extort, or else by slight deceaued.</p><p>
 
 Who all that piteous storie, which befell<br>
 About that wofull couple, which were slaine,<br>
 And their young bloodie babe to him gan tell;<br>
 With whom whiles he did in the wood remaine,<br>
 His horse purloyned was by subtill traine:<br>
 For which he chalenged the thiefe to fight.<br>
 But he for nought could him thereto constraine.<br>
 For as the death he hated such despight,<br>
 And rather had to lose, then trie in armes his right.</p><p>
 
 Which <i>Artegall</i> well hearing, though no more<br>
 By law of armes there neede ones right to trie,<br>
 As was the wont of warlike knights of yore,<br>
 Then that his foe should him the field denie,<br>
 Yet further right by tokens to descrie,<br>
 He askt, what priuie tokens he did beare.<br>
 If that (said <i>Guyon</i>) may you satisfie,<br>
 Within his mouth a blacke spot doth appeare,<br>
 Shapt like a horses shoe, who list to seeke it there.</p><p>
 
 Whereof to make due tryall, one did take<br>
 The horse in hand, within his mouth to looke:<br>
 But with his heeles so sorely he him strake,<br>
 That all his ribs he quite in peeces broke,<br>
 That neuer word from that day forth he spoke.<br>
 Another that would seeme to haue more wit,<br>
 Him by the bright embrodered hedstall tooke:<br>
 But by the shoulder him so sore he bit,<br>
 That he him maymed quite, and all his shoulder split.</p><p>
 
 Ne he his mouth would open vnto wight,<br>
 Vntill that <i>Guyon</i> selfe vnto him spake,<br>
 And called <i>Brigadore</i> (so was he hight)<br>
 Whose voice so soone as he did vndertake,<br>
 Eftsoones he stood as still as any stake,<br>
 And suffred all his secret marke to see:<br>
 And when as he him nam'd, for ioy he brake<br>
 His bands, and follow'd him with gladfull glee,<br>
 And friskt, and flong aloft, and louted low on knee.</p><p>
 
 Thereby Sir <i>Artegall</i> did plaine areed,<br>
 That vnto him the horse belong'd, and sayd;<br>
 Lo there Sir <i>Guyon</i>, take to you the steed,<br>
 As he with golden saddle is arayd;<br>
 And let that losell, plainely now displayd,<br>
 Hence fare on foot, till he an horse haue gayned.<br>
 But the proud boaster gan his doome vpbrayd,<br>
 And him reuil'd, and rated, and disdayned,<br>
 That iudgement so vniust against him had ordayned.</p><p>
 
 Much was the knight incenst with his lewd word,<br>
 To haue reuenged that his villeny;<br>
 And thrise did lay his hand vpon his sword,<br>
 To haue him slaine, or dearely doen aby.<br>
 But <i>Guyon</i> did his choler pacify,<br>
 Saying, Sir knight, it would dishonour bee<br>
 To you, that are our iudge of equity,<br>
 To wreake your wrath on such a carle as hee:<br>
 It's punishment enough, that all his shame doe see.</p><p>
 
 So did he mitigate Sir <i>Artegall</i>;<br>
 But <i>Talus</i> by the backe the boaster hent,<br>
 And drawing him out of the open hall,<br>
 Vpon him did inflict this punishment.<br>
 First he his beard did shaue, and fowly shent:<br>
 Then from him reft his shield, and it renuerst,<br>
 And blotted out his armes with falshood blent,<br>
 And himselfe baffuld, and his armes vnherst,<br>
 And broke his sword in twaine, and all his armour sperst.</p><p>
 
 The whiles his guilefull groome was fled away:<br>
 But vaine it was to thinke from him to flie.<br>
 Who ouertaking him did disaray,<br>
 And all his face deform'd with infamie,<br>
 And out of court him scourged openly.<br>
 So ought all faytours, that true knighthood shame,<br>
 And armes dishonour with base villanie,<br>
 From all braue knights be banisht with defame:<br>
 For oft their lewdnes blotteth good deserts with blame.</p><p>
 
 Now when these counterfeits were thus vncased<br>
 Out of the foreside of their forgerie,<br>
 And in the sight of all men cleane disgraced,<br>
 All gan to iest and gibe full merilie<br>
 At the remembrance of their knauerie.<br>
 Ladies can laugh at Ladies, Knights at Knights,<br>
 To thinke with how great vaunt of brauerie<br>
 He them abused, through his subtill slights,<br>
 And what a glorious shew he made in all their sights.</p><p>
 
 There leaue we them in pleasure and repast,<br>
 Spending their ioyous dayes and gladfull nights,<br>
 And taking vsurie of time forepast,<br>
 With all deare delices and rare delights,<br>
 Fit for such Ladies and such louely knights:<br>
 And turne we here to this faire furrowes end<br>
 Our wearie yokes, to gather fresher sprights,<br>
 That when as time to <i>Artegall</i> shall tend,<br>
 We on his first aduenture may him forward send.</p><p>
