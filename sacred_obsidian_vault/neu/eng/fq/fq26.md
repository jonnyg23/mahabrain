  THE THIRD<br>  BOOKE OF THE 
 <br>  FAERIE QVEENE. <p> 
 <i>Contayning,</i></p><p>  THE LEGEND OF BRITOMARTIS.</p><p>  
 <i>OR</i></p><p> <i>Of Chastitie.</i></p><p> </p></center> 
 
 <p>
 </p><blockquote>
 I
 T falles me here to write of Chastity,<br>
 That fairest vertue, farre aboue the rest;<br>
 For which what needs me fetch from <i>Faery</i><br>
 Forreine ensamples, it to haue exprest?<br>
 Sith it is shrined in my Soueraines brest,<br>
 And form'd so liuely in each perfect part<br>
 That to all Ladies, which haue it profest,<br>
 Need but behold the pourtraict of her hart,<br>
 If pourtrayd it might be by any liuing art.<p>
 
 But liuing art may not least part expresse,<br>
 Nor life-resembling pencill it can paint,<br>
 All were it <i>Zeuxis</i> or <i>Praxiteles:</i><br>
 His daedale hand would faile, and greatly faint,<br>
 And her perfections with his error taint:<br>
 Ne Poets wit, that passeth Painter farre<br>
 In picturing the parts of beautie daint,<br>
 So hard a workmanship aduenture darre,<br>
 For fear through want of words her excellence to marre.</p><p>
 
 How then shall I, Apprentice of the skill,<br>
 That whylome in diuinest wits did raine,<br>
 Presume so high to stretch mine humble quill?<br>
 Yet now my lucklesse lot doth me constraine<br>
 Hereto perforce.  But ô dred Soueraine<br>
 Thus farre forth pardon, sith that choicest wit<br>
 Cannot your glorious pourtraict figure plaine<br>
 That I in colourd showes may shadow it,<br>
 And antique praises vnto present persons fit.</p><p>
 
 But if in liuing colours, and right hew,<br>
 Your selfe you couet to see pictured,<br>
 Who can it doe more liuely, or more trew,<br>
 Then that sweet verse, with <i>Nectar</i> sprinckeled,<br>
 In which a gracious seruant pictured<br>
 His <i>Cynthia</i>, his heauens fairest light?<br>
 That with his melting sweetnesse rauished,<br>
 And with the wonder of her beames bright,<br>
 My senses lulled are in slomber of delight.</p><p>
 
 But let that same delitious Poet lend<br>
 A little leaue vnto a rusticke Muse<br>
 To sing his mistresse prayse, and let him mend,<br>
 If ought amis her liking may abuse:<br>
 Ne let his fairest <i>Cynthia</i> refuse,<br>
 In mirrours more then one her selfe to see,<br>
 But either <i>Gloriana</i> let her chuse,<br>
 Or in <i>Belphoebe</i> fashioned to bee:<br>
 In th'one her rule, in th'other her rare chastitee.</p><p>
