 <h3 align="CENTER">TRADITIONAL WELLS.</h3>
 <p>The ley brings to mind or discovers many of these, for a straight track went to or past all of them. There are Holy Wells at Dinedor, between Blakemere and Preston, and under Herrock Hill. As children, living close by, we used to call the Coldwell at Holmer the Holywell, and found our way by stepping stones to the ancient stone built well now destroyed. It was much like the Chamber well near the mill at Weobley. The Golden Well near Dorstone is on a ley running through Arthur's Stone, the Gold Post (a mountain cot), and terminating in Pen-y-Beacon. The two "golds" on one track indicate a trader's way. Leys go straight to, and not beyond, many wells in the Malvern ridge--St. Ann's, Holy Well, Walms (there is a Walmer Street named from a ley in Hereford and a surname Walmsley), St. Pewtress, and one (whose name I do not find) near the Chase Inn, above Colwall, which village itself is the Cole's--or magic man's--well.</p>
 <p>I have photographed in Cornwall the pointed "beehive" stone structure covering a Holywell, surmounted by a cross; the whole obviously suited for a sighting point. Here and there, as at the Flintshire Holywell, a chapel has been built over the well. Our local example is at Marden, where the well, in the west end of the church, central with the nave (and the ley), is connected with the tradition of St. Ethelbert.</p>
 <p>There is an ancient well in Goodrich Churchyard, with a track way obviously passing over it, but not through the church.</p>
