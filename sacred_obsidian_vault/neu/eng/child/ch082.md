 82.1	THERE was a knight, in a summers night,
 	Was riding oer the lee, diddle
 	An there he saw a bonny birdy,
 	Was singing upon a tree. diddle
 82.1b	O wow for day! diddle
 	An dear gin it were day! diddle
 	Gin it were day, an gin I were away!
 	For I ha na lang time to stay. diddle
 82.2	Make hast, make hast, ye gentle knight,
 	What keeps you here so late?
 	Gin ye kent what was doing at hame,
 	I fear you woud look blate.
 82.3	O what needs I toil day an night,
 	My fair body to kill,
 	Whan I hae knights at my comman,
 	An ladys at my will?
 82.4	Ye lee, ye lee, ye gentle knight,
 	Sa louds I hear you lee;
 	Your ladys a knight in her arms twa
 	That she lees far better nor the.
 82.5	Ye lee, you lee, you bonny birdy,
 	How you lee upo my sweet!
 	I will tak out my bonny bow,
 	An in troth I will you sheet.
 82.6	But afore ye hae your bow well bent,
 	An a your arrows yare,
 	I will flee till another tree,
 	Whare I can better fare.
 82.7	O whare was you gotten, and whare was ye clecked?
 	My bonny birdy, tell me:
 	O I was clecked in good green wood,
 	My bonny birdy, tell me:
 	O I was clecked in good green wood,
 	Intill a holly tree;
 	A gentleman my nest herryed,
 	An ga me to his lady.
 82.8	Wi good white bread an farrow-cow milk
 	He bade her feed me aft,
 	An ga her a little wee simmer-dale wanny,
 	To ding me sindle and saft.
 82.9	Wi good white bread an farrow-cow milk
 	I wot she fed me nought,
 	But wi a little wee simmer-dale wanny
 	She dang me sair an aft:
 	Gin she had deen as ye her bade,
 	I woudna tell how she has wrought.
 82.10	The knight he rade, and the birdy flew,
 	The live-lang simmers night,
 	Till he came till his ladys bowr-door,
 	Then even down he did light:
 	The birdy sat on the crap of a tree,
 	An I wot it sang fu dight.
 82.11b	O wow for day! diddle
 	An dear gin it were day! diddle
 	Gin it were day, an gin I were away!
 	For I ha na lang time to stay. diddle
 82.12	What needs ye lang for day, diddle.
 	An wish that you were away? diddle
 	Is no your hounds i my cellar,
 	Eating white meal an gray? diddle
 82.12b	O wow, etc.
 82.13	Is nae your steed in my stable,
 	Eating good corn an hay?
 	An is nae your hawk i my perch-tree,
 	Just perching for his prey?
 	An is nae yoursel i my arms twa?
 	Then how can ye lang for day?
 82.14b	O wow for day! diddle
 	An dear gin it were day! diddle
 ??	O wow for day! diddle
 	An dear gin it were day! diddle
 ??	O wow for day! diddle
 	An dear gin it were day! diddle
 	For he thats in bed wi anither mans wife
 	Has never lang time to stay. diddle
 82.15	Then out the knight has drawn his sword,
 	An straiked it oer a strae,
 	An thro and thro the fase knights waste
 	He gard cauld iron gae:
 	An I hope ilk ane sal sae be servd
 	That treats ane honest man sae.
