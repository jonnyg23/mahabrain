 <h1 align="CENTER">32: King Henry</h1>
 <pre>
 
 32.1	LAT never a man a wooing wend
 	That lacketh thingis three;
 	A routh o gold, an open heart,
 	Ay fu o charity.
 32.2	As this I speak of King Henry,
 	For he lay burd-alone;
 	An hes doen him to a jelly hunts ha,
 	Was seven miles frae a town.
 32.3	He chasd the deer now him before,
 	An the roe down by the den,
 	Till the fattest buch in a the flock
 	King Henry he has slain.
 32.4	O he has doen him to his ha,
 	To make him beerly cheer;
 	An in it came a griesly ghost,
 	Steed stappin i the fleer.
 32.5	Her head hat the reef-tree o the house,
 	Her middle ye mot wel span;
 	Hes thrown to her his gay mantle,
 	Says, Lady, hap your lingcan.
 32.6	Her teeth was a like teather stakes,
 	Her nose like club or mell;
 	An I ken naething she peard to be,
 	But the fiend that wons in hell.
 32.7	Some meat, some meat, ye King Henry,
 	Some meat ye gie to me!
 	An what meats in this house, lady,
 	An what ha I to gie?
 	O ye do kill your berry-brown steed,
 	An you bring him here to me.
 32.8	O whan he slew his berry-brown steed,
 	Wow but his heart was sair!
 	Shee eat him [a] up, skin an bane,
 	Left naething but hide an hair.
 32.9	Mair meat, mair meat, ye King Henry,
 	Mair meat ye gi to me!
 	An what meats in this house, lady,
 	An what ha I to gi?
 	O ye do kill your good gray-hounds,
 	An ye bring them a to me.
 32.10	O whan he slew his good gray-hounds,
 	Wow but his heart was sair!
 	She eat them a up, skin an bane,
 	Left naething but hide an hair.
 32.11	Mair meat, mair meat, ye King Henry,
 	Mair meat ye gi to me!
 	An what meats i this house, lady,
 	An what ha I to gi?
 	O ye do kill your gay gos-hawks,
 	An ye bring them here to me.
 32.12	O whan he slew his gay gos-hawks,
 	Wow but his heart was sair!
 	She eat them a up, skin an bane,
 	Left naething but feathers bare.
 32.13	Some drink, some drink, now, King Henry,
 	Some drink ye bring to me!
 	O what drinks i this house, lady,
 	That youre nae welcome ti?
 	O ye sew up your horses hide,
 	An bring in a drink to me.
 32.14	And hes sewd up the bloody hide,
 	A puncheon o wine put in;
 	She drank it a up at a waught,
 	Left na ae drap ahin.
 32.15	A bed, a bed, now, King Henry,
 	A bed you mak to me!
 	For ye maun pu the heather green,
 	An mak a bed to me.
 32.16	O pud has he the heather green,
 	An made to her a bed,
 	An up has he taen his gay mantle,
 	An oer it has he spread.
 32.17	Tak aff your claiths, now, King Henry,
 	An lye down by my side!
 	O God forbid, says King Henry,
 	That ever the like betide;
 	That ever the fiend that wons in hell
 	Shoud streak down by my side.
 	* * * * *
 32.18	Whan night was gane, and day was come,
 	An the sun shone throw the ha,
 	The fairest lady that ever was seen
 	Lay atween him an the wa.
 32.19	O well is me! says King Henry,
 	How langll this last wi me?
 	Then out it spake that fair lady,
 	Even till the day you dee.
 32.20	For Ive met wi mony a gentle knight
 	Thats gien me sic a fill,
 	But never before wi a courteous knight
 	That ga me a my will.
