 <h1 align="CENTER">273A: King Edward the Fourth and a Tanner of Tamworth</h1>
 <pre>
 
 273A.1	 In summer time, when leaves grew green,
 	 and birds were singing on every tree,
 	 King Edward would a hunting ride,
 	 some pastime for to see.
 273A.2	 Our king he would a hunting ride,
 	 by eight a clock of the day,
 	 And well was he ware of a bold tanner,
 	 came riding on the way.
 273A.3	 A good russet coat the tanner had on,
 	 fast buttoned under his chin,
 	 And under him a good cow-hide,
 	 and a mare of four shilling.
 273A.4	 Now stand you here, my good lords all,
 	 under this trusty tree,
 	 And I will wend to yonder fellow,
 	 to know from whence came he.
 273A.5	 God speed, God speed, then said our king;
 	 Thou art welcome, good fellow, quoth he;
 	 Which is the way to Drayton Basset
 	 I pray thee shew to me.
 273A.6	 The ready way to Drayton Basset,
 	 from this place as thou dost stand,
 	 The next pair of gallows thou comst to
 	 thou must turn up [on] thy right hand.
 273A.7	 at is not the way, then said our king,
 	 The ready way I pray thee shew me;
 	 Whether thou be thief or true man, quoth the tanner,
 	 Im weary of thy company.
 273A.8	 Away, with a vengeance, qoth the tanner,
 	 I hold thee out of thy wit,
 	 For all this day have I ridden and gone,
 	 And I am fasting yet.
 273A.9	 Go with me to Drayton Basset, said our king,
 	 No daintyes we will lack;
 	 Wel have meat and drink of the best,
 	 And I will pay the shot.
 273A.10	 Godamercy for nothing, said the tanner,
 	 Thou shalt pay for no dinner of mine;
 	 I have more groats and nobles in my purse
 	 then thou hast pence in thine.
 273A.11	 God save your goods, then said the king,
 	 a+end send them well to thee!
 	 Be thou thief or true man, quoth the tanner,
 	 I am weary of thy company.
 273A.12	 Away, with a vengeance, quoth the tanner,
 	 of thee I stand in fear;
 	 The aparrell thou wearst on thy back
 	 May seem a good lord to wear.
 273A.13	 I never stole them said our king,
 	 I swear to thee by the rood;
 	 Thou art some ruffian of the country,
 	 thou ridst in the midst of thy good.
 273A.14	 at news dost thou hear? then said our king,
 	 I pray what news do you hear?
 	 I hear no news, answered the tanner,
 	 But that cow-hides be dear.
 273A.15	 Cow-hides? cow-hides? then said our king,
 	 I marvell what they be;
 	 Why, art thou a fool? quoth the tanner,
 	 look, I have one under me.
 273A.16	 Yet one thing now I would thee pray,
 	 so that thou wouldst not be strange;
 	 If thy mare be better then my steed,
 	 I pray thee let us change.
 273A.17	 But if you needs with me will change,
 	 As change full well may ye,
 	 By the faith of my body, quoth the tanner,
 	 I look to have boot of thee.
 273A.18	 What boot wilt thou ask? then said our king,
 	 what boot dost thou ask on this ground?
 	 No pence nor half-pence, said the tanner,
 	 But a noble in gold so round.
 273A.19	 Heres twenty good groats, then said the king,
 	 So well paid see you be;
 	 I love thee better then I did before,
 	 I thought thou hadst nere a peny.
 273A.20	 But if so be we needs must change,
 	 as change thou must abide,
 	 Though thou hast gotten Brock my mare,
 	 thou shalt not have my cow-hide.
 273A.21	 The tanner took the good cow-hide,
 	 that of the cow was hilt,
 	 And threw it upon the kings saddle,
 	 That was so fairly guilt.
 273A.22	 Now help me, help me, quoth the tanner,
 	 Full quickly that I were gone,
 	 For when I come home to Gillian my wife
 	 shel say Im a gentleman.
 273A.23	 The king took the tanner by the leg,
 	 he girded a fart so round;
 	 Your very homely, said the king,
 	 were I aware, Id laid you o th ground.
 273A.24	 But when the tanner was in the kings saddle
 	 aston d then he was;
 	 He knew not the stirrops that he did wear,
 	 whether they were gold or brass.
 273A.25	 But when the steed saw the black cow-tale wag,
 	 for and the black cow-horn,
 	 The steed began to run away,
 	 as the divel the tanner had born.
 273A.26	 Untill he came unto a nook,
 	 a little beside an ash;
 	 The steed gave the tanner such a fall
 	 his neck was almost brast.
 273A.27	 Take thy horse again, with a vengeance, he said,
 	 with me he shall not abide;
 	 It is no marvell, said the king, and laught,
 	 He knew not your cow-hide.
 273A.28	 But if that we needs now must change,
 	 as change that well we mought,
 	 Ile swear to you plain, if you have your mare,
 	 I look to have some boot.
 273A.29	 What boot will you ask? quoth the tanner,
 	 What boot will you ask on this ground?
 	 No pence nor half-pence, said our king,
 	 But a noble in gold so round.
 273A.30	 Heres twenty [good] groats, said the tanner,
 	 a+end twenty more I have of thine;
 	 I have ten groats more in my purse,
 	 wel drink five of them at the wine.
 273A.31	 The king set a bugle-horne to his mouth,
 	 that blew both loud and shrill,
 	 And five hundred lords and knights
 	 came riding over a hill.
 273A.32	 Away, with a vengeance, quoth the tanner,
 	 with thee Ile no longer abide;
 	 Thou art a strong thief, yonder be thy fellows,
 	 they will steal away my cow-hide.
 273A.33	 No I protest, then said our king,
 	 For so it may not be;
 	 They be the lords of Drayton Basset,
 	 come out of the North Country.
 273A.34	 But when they came before the king
 	 full low they fell on their knee;
 	 The tanner had rather then a thousand pound
 	 he had been out of his company.
 273A.35	 A coller! a coller! then said the king,
 	 a+e coller! then did he cry;
 	 Then would he have given a thousand pound
 	 he had not been so nigh.
 273A.36	 A coller? a coller? then quoth the tanner,
 	 it is a thing which will breed sorrow;
 	 For after a coller commeth a halter,
 	 and I shall be hanged tomorrow.
 273A.37	 No, do not fear, the king did say;
 	 For pastime thou hast shown me,
 	 No coller nor halter thou shalt have,
 	 but I will give thee a fee.
 273A.38	 For Plompton Park I will give thee,
 	 with tenements three beside,
 	 Which is worth three hundred pound a year,
 	 to maintain thy good cow-hide.
 273A.39	 Godamercy, Godamercy, quoth the tanner;
 	 For this good deed thou hast done,
 	 If ever thou comest to merry Tamworth
 	 thou shalt have clouting-leather for thy shone.
