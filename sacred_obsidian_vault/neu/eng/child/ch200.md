 	 They coost the glamer oer her.
 200A.3	 Gae tak frae me this gay mantile,
 	 And bring to me a plaidie;

 200A.4	 Yestreen I lay in a well-made bed,
 	 And my good lord beside me;
 	 This night Ill ly in a tenants barn,
 	 Whatever shall betide me.
 200A.5	 Come to your bed, says Johny Faa,

 	 And O but they sang bonnie!
 	 They sang sae sweet and sae complete
 	 That down came our fair ladie.
 200B.2	 She came tripping down the stairs,
 	 And all her maids before her;
 	 As soon as they saw her weel-fard face,
 	 They coost their glamourie owre her.
 200B.3	 She gave to them the good wheat bread,
 	 And they gave her the ginger;
 	 But she gave them a far better thing,
 	 The gold ring off her finger.
 200B.4	 Will ye go with me, my hinny and my heart?

 	 And I will swear, by the staff of my spear,
 	 That your lord shall nae mair come near thee.

 	 I could sail the seas with my dearie;
 	 I could sail the seas with my Jockie Faa,
 	 And with pleasure could drown with my dearie.
 200B.7	 They wandred high, they wandred low,
 	 They wandred late and early,
 	 Untill they came to an old tenants-barn,
 	 And by this time she was weary.
 200B.8	 Last night I lay in a weel-made bed,
 	 And my noble lord beside me,
 	 And now I must ly in an old tenants-barn,
 	 And the black crew glowring owre me.

 200B.10	 They wandred high, they wandred low,
 	 They wandred late and early,
 	 Untill they came to that wan water,
 	 And by this time she was wearie.
 200B.11	 Aften have I rode that wan water,
 	 And my lord Cassilis beside me,
 	 And now I must set in my white feet and wade,
 	 And carry the gypsie laddie.
 200B.12	 By and by came home this noble lord,
 	 And asking for his ladie,

 	 She is gone with the gypsie laddie.
 200B.13	 Go saddle to me the black, he says,

 	 And I will neither eat nor drink
 	 Till I bring home my ladie.
 200B.14	 He wandred high, he wandred low,
 	 He wandred late and early,
 	 Untill he came to that wan water,
 	 And there he spied his ladie.
 200B.15	 O wilt thou go home, my hinny and my heart,
 	 O wilt thou go home, my dearie?
 	 And Il close thee in a close room,
 	 Where no man shall come near thee."]
 200B.16	 I will not go home, my hinny and my heart,
 	 I will not go home, my dearie;
 	 If I have brewn good beer, I will drink of the same,
 	 And my lord shall nae mair come near me.
 200B.17	 But I will swear, by the moon and the stars,
 	 And the sun that shines so clearly,
 	 That I am as free of the gypsie gang
 	 As the hour my mother did bear me.
 200B.18	 They were fifteen valiant men,
 	 Black, but very bonny,
 	 And they lost all their lives for one,
 	 The Earl of Cassillis ladie.

 	 The grass was wet and dewy;
 	 Seated with her gipsey lad,

 	 Would you forsake your baby?
 	 Would you forsake your own true love,
 	 And go with the gipsey Davy?

 	 Yes, Ill forsake my baby;
 	 What care I for my true love?
 	 I love the gipsey Davy.
 200J.7	 The great lord he rode home that night,
 	 He took good care of his baby,
 	 And ere six months had passed away
 	 He married another lady.
