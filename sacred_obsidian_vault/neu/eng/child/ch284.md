 <h1 align="CENTER">284A: John Dory</h1>
 <pre>
 
 284A.1	 As it fell on a holy-day,
 	 And vpon an holy-tide-a,
 	 Iohn Dory bought him an ambling nag,
 	 To Paris for to ride-a.
 284A.2	 And when John Dory to Paris was come,
 	 A little before the gate-a,
 	 John Dory was fitted, the porter was witted
 	 To let him in thereat-a.
 284A.3	 The first man that John Dory did meet
 	 Was good king John of France-a;
 	 John Dory could well of his courtesie,
 	 But fell downe in a trance-a.
 284A.4	 A pardon, a pardon, my liege and my king,
 	 For my merie men and for me-a,
 	 And all the churles in merie England,
 	 Ile bring them all bound to thee-a.
 284A.5	 And Nicholl was then a Cornish man,
 	 A little beside Bohide-a,
 	 And he mande forth a good blacke barke,
 	 With fiftie good oares on a side-a.
 284A.6	 Run vp, my boy, vnto the maine top,
 	 And looke what thou canst spie-a:
 	 Who ho! who ho! a goodly ship I do see,
 	 I trow it be John Dory[-a]
 284A.7	 They hoist their sailes, both top and top,
 	 The meisseine and all was tride-a,
 	 And euery man stood to his lot,
 	 What euer should betide-a.
 284A.8	 The roring cannons then were plide,
 	 And dub-a-dub went the drumme-a;
 	 The braying trumpets lowde they cride
 	 To courage both all and some-a.
 284A.9	 The grappling-hooks were brought at length,
 	 The browne bill and the sword-a,
 	 John Dory at length, for all his strength,
 	 Was clapt fast vnder board-a.
