 Percy MS., p. 274; Hales and Furnivall, II, 269.
 
 63A.1	CHILDE Watters in his stable stoode,
 	And stroaket his milke-white steede;
 	To him came a ffaire young ladye
 	As ere did weare womans wee&lt;de].
 63A.2	Saies, Christ you saue, good Chyld Waters!
 	Sayes, Christ you saue and see!
 	My girdle of gold, which was too longe,
 	Is now to short ffor mee.
 63A.3	And all is with one chyld of yours,
 	I ffeele sturre att my side;
 	My gowne of greene, it is to strayght;
 	Before it was to wide.
 63A.4	If the child be mine, Faire Ellen, he sayd,
 	Be mine, as you tell mee,
 	Take you Cheshire and Lancashire both,
 	Take them your owne to bee.
 63A.5	If the child be mine, Ffaire Ellen, he said,
 	Be mine, as you doe sweare,
 	Take you Cheshire and Lancashire both,
 	And make that child your heyre.
 63A.6	Shee saies, I had rather haue one kisse,
 	Child Waters, of thy mouth,
 	Then I wold haue Cheshire and Lancashire both,
 	that lyes by north and south.
 63A.7	And I had rather haue a twinkling,
 	Child Waters, of your eye,
 	Then I wold haue Cheshire and Lancashire both,
 	To take them mine oune to bee.
 63A.8	To-morrow, Ellen, I must forth ryde
 	Soe ffarr into the north countrye;
 	The ffairest lady that I can ffind,
 	Ellen, must goe with mee.
 	And euer I pray you, Child Watters,
 	Your ffootpage let me bee!
 63A.9	If you will my ffootpage be, Ellen,
 	As you doe tell itt mee,
 	Then you must cutt your gownne of greene
 	An inche aboue your knee.
 63A.10	Soe must you doe your yellow lockes,
 	Another inch aboue your eye;
 	You must tell noe man what is my name;
 	My ffootpage then you shall bee.
 63A.11	All this long day Child Waters rode,
 	Shee ran bare ffoote by his side;
 	Yett was he neuer soe curteous a knight
 	To say, Ellen, will you ryde?
 63A.12	But all this day Child Waters rode,
 	Shee ran barffoote thorow the broome;
 	Yett he was neuer soe curteous a knight
 	As to say, Put on your shoone.
 63A.13	Ride softlye, shee said, Child Watters;
 	Why doe you ryde soe ffast?
 	The child which is no mans but yours
 	My bodye itt will burst.
 63A.14	He sayes, Sees thou yonder water, Ellen,
 	that fflowes from banke to brim?
 	I trust to god, Child Waters, shee said,
 	You will neuer see mee swime.
 63A.15	But when shee came to the waters side,
 	Shee sayled to the chinne:
 	Except the lord of heauen be my speed,
 	Now must I learne to swime.
 63A.16	The salt waters bare vp Ellens clothes,
 	Our Ladye bare vpp he&lt;r] chinne,
 	And Child Waters was a woe man, good Lord,
 	To ssee Faire Ellen swime.
 63A.17	And when shee ouer the water was,
 	Shee then came to his knee:
 	He said, Come hither, Ffaire Ellen,
 	Loe yonder what I see!
 63A.18	Seest thou not yonder hall, Ellen?
 	Of redd gold shine the yates;
 	Theres four and twenty ffayre ladyes,
 	The ffairest is my wordlye make.
 63A.19	Seest thou not yonder hall, Ellen?
 	Of redd gold shineth the tower;
 	There is four and twenty ffaire ladyes,
 	The fairest is my paramoure.
 63A.20	I doe see the hall now, Child Waters,
 	that of redd gold shineth the yates;
 	God giue good then of your selfe,
 	And of your wordlye make!
 63A.21	I doe see the hall now, Child Waters,
 	that of redd gold shineth the yates;
 	God giue good then of your selfe,
 	And of your paramoure!
 63A.22	There were four and twenty ladyes,
 	Were playing att the ball,
 	And Ellen, was the ffairest ladye,
 	Must bring his steed to the stall.
 63A.23	There were four and twenty faire ladyes
 	Was playing att the chesse;
 	And Ellen, shee was the ffairest ladye,
 	Must bring his horsse to grasse.
 63A.24	And then bespake Child Waters sister,
 	And these were the words said shee:
 	You haue the prettyest ffootpage, brother,
 	that euer I saw with mine eye;
 	That euer I saw with mine eye;
 63A.25	But that his belly it is soe bigg,
 	His girdle goes wonderous hye;
 	And euer I pray you, Child Waters,
 	Let him goe into the chamber with mee.
 63A.26	It is more meete for a little ffootpage,
 	that has run through mosse and mire,
 	To take his supper vpon his knee
 	And sitt downe by the kitchin fyer,
 	Then to goe into the chamber with any ladye
 	That weares soe [rich] attyre.
 63A.27	But when th?e had supped euery one,
 	To bedd they took the way;
 	He sayd, Come hither, my little footpage,
 	Harken what I doe say.
 63A.28	And goe thee downe into yonder towne,
 	And low into the street;
 	The ffairest ladye that thou can find,
 	Hyer her in mine armes to sleepe,
 	And take her vp in thine armes two,
 	For filinge of her ffeete.
 63A.29	Ellen is gone into the towne,
 	And low into the streete;
 	The fairest ladye that shee cold find
 	Shee hyred in his armes to sleepe,
 	And tooke her in her armes two,
 	For filing of her ffeete.
 63A.30	I pray you now, good Child Waters,
 	that I may creepe in att your bedds feete;
 	For there is noe place about this house
 	Where I may say a sleepe.
 63A.31	This [night] and itt droue on affterward
 	Till itt was neere the day:
 	He sayd, Rise vp, my litle ffoote-page,
 	And giue my steed corne and hay;
 	And soe doe thou the good blacke oates,
 	that he may carry me the better away.
 63A.32	And vp then rose Ffaire Ellen,
 	And gaue his steed corne and hay,
 	And soe shee did and the good blacke oates,
 	that he might carry him the better away.
 63A.33	Shee layned her backe to the manger side,
 	And greiuouslye did groane;
 	And that beheard his mother deere,
 	And heard her make her moane.
 63A.34	Shee said, Rise vp, thou Child Waters,
 	I thinke thou art a cursed man;
 	For yonder is a ghost in thy stable,
 	that greiuouslye doth groane,
 	Or else some woman laboures of child,
 	Shee is soe woe begone.
 63A.35	But vp then rose Child Waters,
 	And did on his shirt of silke;
 	Then he put on his other clothes
 	On his body as white as milke.
 63A.36	And when he came to the stable-dore,
 	Full still that hee did stand,
 	that hee might heare now Faire Ellen,
 	That hee might heare now Faire Ellen,
 	How shee made her monand.
 63A.37	Shee said, Lullabye, my owne deere child!
 	Lullabye, deere child, deere!
 	I wold thy father were a king,
 	Thy mother layd on a beere!
 63A.38	Peace now, he said, good Faire Ellen,
 	And be of good cheere, I thee pray,
 	And the bridall and the churching both,
 	They shall bee vpon one day.

 a. Jamiesons Brown MS., fol. 22, taken down from Mrs Browns recitation before 1783.  b. A. Fraser Tytlers Brown MS., No 9, as recited by Mrs Brown in 1800.
 
 63B.1	I WARN ye all, ye gay ladies,
 	That wear scarlet an brown,
 	That ye dinna leave your fathers house,
 	To follow young men frae town.
 63B.2	O here am I, a lady gay,
 	That wears scarlet an brown,
 	Yet I will leave my fathers house,
 	An follow Lord John frae the town.
 63B.3	Lord John stood in his stable-door,
 	Said he was bound to ride;
 	Burd Ellen stood in her bowr-door,
 	Said shed rin by his side.
 63B.4	Hes pitten on his cork-heeld shoone,
 	An fast awa rade he;
 	Shes clade hersel in page array,
 	An after him ran she.
 63B.5	Till they came till a wan water,
 	An folks do ca it clyde;
 	Then hes lookit oer his left shoulder,
 	Says, Lady, can ye wide?
 63B.6	O I learnt it i my father house,
 	An I learnt it for my weal,
 	Wenneer I came to a wan water,
 	To swim like ony eel.
 63B.7	But the firstin stap the lady stappit,
 	The water came til her knee;
 	Ohon, alas! said the lady,
 	This waters oer deep for me.
 63B.8	The nextin stap the lady stappit,
 	The water came till her middle;
 	An sighin says that gay lady,
 	Ive wat my gouden girdle
 63B.9	The nextin stap the lady stappit,
 	The water came till her pap;
 	An the bairn that was in her twa sides
 	For caul begane to quake.
 63B.10	Lye still, lye still, my ain dear babe,
 	Ye work your mither wae;
 	Your father rides on high horse-back,
 	Cares little for us twae.
 63B.11	O about the midst o Clyden water
 	There was a yeard-fast stane;
 	He lightly turnd his horse about,
 	An tooke her on him behin.
 63B.12	O tell me this now, good Lord John,
 	An a word ye dinna lee,
 	How far it is to your lodgin,
 	Whare we this night maun be?
 63B.13	O see you nae yon castle, Ellen,
 	That shines sae fair to see?
 	There is a lady in it, Ellen,
 	Will sunder you an me.
 63B.14	There is a lady in that castle
 	Will sunder you and I:
 	Betide me well, betide me wae,
 	I sal go there an try.
 63B.15	O my dogs sal eat the good white bread,
 	An ye sal eat the bran;
 	Then will ye sigh, an say, alas!
 	That ever I was a man!
 63B.16	O I sal eat the good white bread,
 	An your dogs sal eat the bran;
 	An I hope to live an bless the day,
 	That ever ye was a man.
 63B.17	O my horse sal eat the good white meal,
 	An ye sal eat the corn;
 	Then will ye curse the heavy hour
 	That ever your love was born.
 63B.18	O I sal eat the good white meal,
 	An your horse sal eat the corn;
 	An I ay sall bless the happy hour
 	That ever my love was born.
 63B.19	O four an twenty gay ladies
 	Welcomd Lord John to the ha,
 	But a fairer lady than them a
 	Led his horse to the stable sta.
 63B.20	An four an twenty gay ladies
 	Welcomd Lord John to the green,
 	But a fairer lady than them a
 	At the manger stood alane.
 63B.21	Whan bells were rung, an mass was sung,
 	Ar a men boun to meat,
 	Burd Ellen at a bye-table
 	Amo the foot-men was set.
 63B.22	O eat an drink, my bonny boy,
 	The white bread an the beer:
 	The never a bit can I eat or drink,
 	My hearts sae full of fear.
 63B.23	O eat an drink, my bonny boy,
 	The white bread an the wine:
 	O I canna eat nor drink, master,
 	My hearts sae full of pine.
 63B.24	But out it spake Lord Johns mother,
 	An a wise woman was she:
 	Whare met ye wi that bonny boy,
 	That looks sae sad on thee?
 63B.25	Sometimes his cheek is rosy red,
 	An sometimes deadly wan;
 	Hes liker a woman big wi bairn,
 	Than a young lords serving man.
 63B.26	O it makes me laugh, my mother dear,
 	Sic words to hear frae thee;
 	He is a squires ae dearest son,
 	That for love has followd me.
 63B.27	Rise up, rise up, my bonny boy,
 	Gi my horse corn an hay:
 	O that I will, my master dear,
 	As quickly as I may.
 63B.28	Shes taen the hay under her arm,
 	The corn intill her han,
 	An shes gane to the great stable,
 	As fast as eer she can.
 63B.29	O room ye roun, my bonny broun steeds,
 	O room ye near the wa;
 	For the pain that strikes me thro my sides
 	Full soon will gar me fa.
 63B.30	Shes leand her back against the wa;
 	Strong travail seizd her on;
 	An even amo the great horse feet
 	Burd Ellen brought forth her son.
 63B.31	Lord John[s] mither intill her bowr
 	Was sitting all alone,
 	Whan, i the silence o the night,
 	She heard fair Ellens moan.
 63B.32	Won up, won up, my son, she says,
 	Go se how a does fare;
 	For I think I hear a womans groans,
 	An a bairn greeting sair.
 63B.33	O hastily he gat him up,
 	Stayd neither for hose nor shoone,
 	An hes doen him to the stable-door,
 	Wi the clear light o the moon.
 63B.34	He strack the door hard wi his foot,
 	An sae has he wi his knee,
 	An iron locks an iron bars
 	Into the floor flung he:
 	Be not afraid, Burd Ellen, he says,
 	Thers nane come in but me.
 63B.35	Up he has taen his bonny young son,
 	An gard wash him wi the milk;
 	An up has he taen his fair lady,
 	Gard row her in the silk.
 63B.36	Cheer up your heart, Burd Ellen, he says,
 	Look nae mair sad nor wae;
 	For your marriage an your kirkin too
 	Sal baith be in ae day.

 63C.1	THE corn is turning ripe, Lord John,
 	The nuts are growing fu,
 	And ye are bound for your ain countrie,
 	Fain wad I go wi you.
 63C.2	Wi me, Margret, wi me, Margret,
 	What wad ye do wi me?
 	Ive mair need o a pretty little boy,
 	To wait upon my steed.
 63C.3	Its I will be your pretty little boy,
 	To wait upon your steed;
 	And ilka town that we come to,
 	A pack of hounds Ill lead.
 63C.4	My hounds will eat o the bread o wheat,
 	And ye of the bread of bran;
 	And then you will sit and sigh,
 	That eer ye loed a man.
 63C.5	The first water that they cam to,
 	I think they call it Clyde,
 	He saftly unto her did say,
 	Lady Margret, will ye ride?
 63C.6	The first step that she steppit in,
 	She steppit to the knee;
 	Says, Wae be to ye, waefu water,
 	For through ye I maun be.
 63C.7	The second step that she steppit in,
 	She steppit to the middle,
 	And sighd, and said, Lady Margret,
 	Ive staind my gowden girdle.
 63C.8	The third step that she steppit in,
 	She steppit to the neck;
 	The pretty babe within her sides,
 	The cauld it garrd it squake.
 63C.9	Lie still my babe, lie still my babe,
 	Lie still as langs ye may,
 	For your father rides on horseback high,
 	Cares little for us twae.
 63C.10	Its whan she cam to the other side,
 	She sat doun on a stane;
 	Says, Them that made me, help me now,
 	For I am far frae hame.
 63C.11	How far is it frae your mithers bouer,
 	Gude Lord John tell to me?
 	Its therty miles, Lady Margaret,
 	Its therty miles and three:
 	And yese be wed to ane o her serving men,
 	For yese get na mair o me.
 63C.12	Then up bespak the wylie parrot,
 	As it sat on the tree,
 	Ye lee, ye lee, Lord John, it said,
 	Sae loud as I hear ye lee.
 63C.13	Ye say its therty miles frae your mithers bouer,
 	Whan its but barely three;
 	And shell neer be wed to a serving man,
 	For shell be your ain ladie.
 63C.14	[O dinna ye see yon bonnie castle,
 	Lies on yon sunny lea?
 	And yese get ane o my mithers men,
 	For yese get na mair o me.]
 63C.15	[Well see I yon bonnie castle,
 	Lies on yon sunny lea,
 	But Ise neer hae nane o your mithers men,
 	Tho I never gat mair o thee.]
 63C.16	[Whan he cam to the porters yett
 	He tirled at the pin,
 	And wha sae ready as the bauld porter
 	To open and lat him in.]
 63C.17	Monie a lord and fair ladie
 	Met Lord John in the closs,
 	But the bonniest face amang them a
 	Was hauding Lord Johns horse.
 63C.18	[Monie a lord and lady bricht
 	Met Lord John on the green,
 	But the bonniest boy amang them a
 	Was standing by, him leen.]
 63C.19	Monie a lord and gay ladie
 	Sat dining in the ha,
 	But the bonniest face that was there
 	Was waiting on them a.
 63C.20	O up bespak Lord Johns sister,
 	A sweet young maid was she:
 	My brither has brought a bonnie young page,
 	His like I neer did see;
 	But the red flits fast frae his cheek,
 	And the tear stands in his ee.
 63C.21	But up bespak Lord Johns mither,
 	She spak wi meikle scorn:
 	Hes liker a woman gret wi bairn,
 	Than onie waiting-man.
 63C.22	Its yell rise up, my bonnie boy,
 	And gie my steed the hay:
 	O that I will, my dear master,
 	As fast as I can gae.
 63C.23	She took the hay aneath her arm,
 	The corn intil her hand,
 	But atween the stable-door and the staw,
 	Lady Margret made a stand.
 63C.24	[Whan bells were rung, and mass was sung,
 	And a men boun for bed,
 	Lord John, mither, and sister gay
 	In ae bour they were laid.]
 63C.25	[Lord John had na weel gat aff his claise,
 	Nor was he weel laid doun,
 	Till his mither heard a bairn greet,
 	And a womans heavy moan.]
 63C.26	[Win up, win up, Lord John, she said,
 	Seek neither hose nor shoon;
 	For Ive heard a bairn loud greet,
 	And a womans heavy moan.]
 63C.27	[Lord John raise, put on his claise,
 	Sought neither hose nor shoon,
 	Atween the ha and the stable-door
 	He made na a step but ane.]
 63C.28	O open the door, Lady Margaret,
 	O open and let me in;
 	I want to see if my steed be fed,
 	Or my grey-hounds fit to rin.
 63C.29	Ill na open the door, Lord John, she said,
 	Ill na open it to thee,
 	Till ye grant to me my ae request,
 	And a puir ane its to me.
 63C.30	Yell gie to me a bed in an outhouse,
 	For my young son and me,
 	And the meanest servant in a the place,
 	To wait on him and me.
 63C.31	[Hes tane the door wi his fit,
 	And he keppd it wi his knee,
 	He made the door o double deals
 	In splinders soon to flee.]
 63C.32	[An askin, an askin, grant me, Lord John,
 	An askin yell grant me;
 	The meanest maid about the place
 	To bring a glass o water to me.]
 63C.33	I grant, I grant, Lady Margret, he said,
 	A that, and mair frae me,
 	The very best bed in a the place
 	To your young son and thee,
 	And my mither, and my sister dear,
 	To wait on him and thee.
 63C.34	And a thae lands, and a thae rents,
 	They shall be his and thine;
 	Our wedding and our kirking day,
 	They sall be all in ane.
 63C.35	And he has tane Lady Margaret,
 	And rowd her in the silk,
 	And he has tane his ain young son,
 	And washd him in the milk.

 	Some rogue hae broke my stable-door,
 	And stown awa my steed.
 63J.28	Win up, win up now, Dow Isbel,

 	And yell gae to my stable-door,
 	See that be true or lie.
 63J.29	When she gaed to the stable-door,

 63J.42	He hit the door then wi his foot,
 	Sae did he wi his knee,
 	Till doors o deal, and locks o steel,
 	In splinders gart he flee.
 63J.43	An asking, asking, Sweet Willie,
 	An asking yell grant me;
 	The warst in bower in a your towers,
 	For thy young son and me.
 63J.44	Your askings nae sae great, Burd Helen,
 	But granted it shall be;
 	The best in bower in a my towers,
 	For my young son and thee.
 63J.45	An asking, asking, sweet Willie,
 	An asking yell grant me;
 	The warst an woman about your bowers,

 63J.46	The best an woman about my bowers,
 	To wait on him and thee,
 	And thats my sister Dow Isbel,
 	And a gude woman is she.
 63J.47	Ye will take up my little young son,
 	And wash him wi the milk;
 	And yell take up my gay lady,
 	And row her in the silk.
 63J.48	Be favourable to my lady,
 	Be favourable, if ye may;
 	Her kirking and her fair wedding
 	Shall baith stand on ae day.
