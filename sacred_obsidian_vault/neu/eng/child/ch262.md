 <h1 align="CENTER">262A: Lord Livingston</h1>
 <pre>
 
 262A.1	 IT fell about the Lammas time,
 	 When wightsmen won their hay,
 	 A the squires in merry Linkum
 	 Went a forth till a play.
 262A.2	 They playd until the evening tide,
 	 The sun was gaeing down;
 	 A lady thro plain fields was bound,
 	 A lily leesome thing.
 262A.3	 Two squires that for this lady pledged,
 	 In hopes for a renown,
 	 The one was calld the proud Seaton,
 	 The other Livingston.
 262A.4	 When will ye, Michaell o Livingston,
 	 Wad for this lady gay?
 	 To-morrow, to-morrow, said Livingston,
 	 To-morrow, if you may.
 262A.5	 Then they hae wadded their wagers,
 	 And laid their pledges down;
 	 To the high castle o Edinbro
 	 They made them ready boun.
 262A.6	 The chamber that they did gang in,
 	 There it was daily dight;
 	 The kipples were like the gude red gowd,
 	 As they stood up in hight,
 	 And the roof-tree like the siller white,
 	 And shind like candles bright.
 262A.7	 The lady fair into that ha
 	 Was comly to be seen;
 	 Her kirtle was made o the pa,
 	 Her gowns seemd o the green.
 262A.8	 Her gowns seemd like green, like green,
 	 Her kirtle o the pa;
 	 A siller wand intill her hand,
 	 She marshalld ower them a.
 262A.9	 She gae every knight a lady bright,
 	 And every squire a may;
 	 Her own sell chose him Livingston,
 	 They were a comely tway.
 262A.10	 Then Seaton started till his foot,
 	 The fierce flame in his ee:
 	 On the next day, wi sword in hand,
 	 On plain fields meet ye me.
 262A.11	 When bells were rung, and mass was sung,
 	 And a man bound for bed,
 	 Lord Livingston and his fair dame
 	 In bed were sweetly laid.
 262A.12	 The bed, the bed where they lay in
 	 Was coverd wi the pa;
 	 A covering o the gude red gowd
 	 Lay nightly ower the twa.
 262A.13	 So they lay there, till on the morn
 	 The sun shone on their feet;
 	 Then up it raise him Livingston
 	 To draw to him a weed.
 262A.14	 The first an weed that he drew on
 	 Was o the linen clear;
 	 The next an weed that he drew on,
 	 It was a weed o weir.
 262A.15	 The niest an weed that he drew on
 	 Was gude iron and steel;
 	 Twa gloves o plate, a gowden helmet,
 	 Became that hind chiel weel.
 262A.16	 Then out it speaks that lady gay-+--+-
 	 A little forbye stood she-+--+-
 	 Ill dress mysell in mens array,
 	 Gae to the fields for thee.
 262A.17	 O God forbid, said Livingston,
 	 That eer I dree the shame;
 	 My lady slain in plain fields,
 	 And I coward knight at hame!
 262A.18	 He scarcely travelled frae the town
 	 A mile but barely twa
 	 Till he met wi a witch-woman,
 	 I pray to send her wae!
 262A.19	 This is too gude a day, my lord,
 	 To gang sae far frae town;
 	 This is too gude a day, my lord,
 	 On field to make you boun.
 262A.20	 I dreamd a dream concerning thee,
 	 O read ill dreams to guid!
 	 Your bower was full o milk-white swans,
 	 Your brides bed full o bluid.
 262A.21	 O bluid is gude, said Livingston,
 	 To bide it whoso may;
 	 If I be frae yon plain fields,
 	 Nane knew the plight I lay.
 262A.22	 Then he rade on to plain fields
 	 As swifts his horse coud hie,
 	 And ther he met the proud Seaton,
 	 Come boldly ower the lee.
 262A.23	 Come on to me now, Livingston,
 	 Or then take foot and flee;
 	 This is the day that we must try
 	 Who gains the victorie.
 262A.24	 Then they fought with sword in hand
 	 Till they were bluidy men;
 	 But on the point o Seatons sword
 	 Brave Livingston was slain.
 262A.25	 His lady lay ower castle-wa,
 	 Beholding dale and down,
 	 When Blenchant brave, his gallant steed,
 	 Came prancing to the town.
 262A.26	 O where is now my ain gude lord
 	 He stays sae far frae me?
 	 O dinna ye see your ain gude lord
 	 Stand bleeding by your knee?
 262A.27	 O live, O live, Lord Livingston,
 	 The space o ae half hour,
 	 Theres nae a leech in Edinbro town
 	 But Ill bring to your door.
 262A.28	 Awa wi your leeches, lady, he said,
 	 Of them Ill be the waur;
 	 Theres nae a leech in Edinbro town
 	 That can strong death debar.
 262A.29	 Yell take the lands o Livingston
 	 And deal them liberallie,
 	 To the auld that may not, the young that cannot,
 	 And blind that does na see,
 	 And help young maidens marriages,
 	 That has nae gear to gie.
 262A.30	 My mother got it in a book,
 	 The first night I was born,
 	 I woud be wedded till a knight,
 	 And him slain on the morn.
 262A.31	 But I will do for my loves sake
 	 What ladies woudna thole;
 	 Ere seven years shall hae an end,
 	 Nae shoes gang on my sole.
 262A.32	 Theres never lint gang on my head,
 	 Nor kame gang in my hair,
 	 Nor ever coal nor candle-light
 	 Shine in my bower mair.
 262A.33	 When seven years were near an end,
 	 The lady she thought lang,
 	 And wi a crack her heart did brake,
 	 And sae this ends my sang.
