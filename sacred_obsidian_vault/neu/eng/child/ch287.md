 <h1 align="CENTER">287A: Captain Ward and the Rainbow</h1>
 <pre>
 
 287A.1	 STRIKE up, you lusty gallants, with musick and sound of drum,
 	 For we have descryed a rover, upon the sea is come;
 	 His name is Captain Ward, right well it doth appear,
 	 There has not been such a rover found out this thousand year.
 287A.2	 For he hath sent unto our king, the sixth of January,
 	 Desiring that he might come in, with all his company:
 	 And if your king will let me come till I my tale have told,
 	 I will bestow for my ransome full thirty tun of gold.
 287A.3	 O nay! O nay! then said our king, O nay! this may not be,
 	 To yield to such a rover my self will not agree;
 	 He hath deceivd the French-man, likewise the King of Spain,
 	 And how can he be true to me that hath been false to twain?
 287A.4	 With that our king provided a ship of worthy fame,
 	 Rainbow she is called, if you would know her name;
 	 Now the gallant Rainbow she rowes upon the sea,
 	 Five hundred gallant seamen to bear her company.
 287A.5	 The Dutch-man and the Spaniard she made them for to flye,
 	 Also the bonny French-man, as she met him on the sea:
 	 When as this gallant Rainbow did come where Ward did lye,
 	 Where is the captain of this ship? this gallant Rainbow did cry.
 287A.6	 O that am I, says Captain Ward, Theres no man bids me lye,
 	 And if thou art the kings fair ship, thou art welcome unto me:
 	 Ile tell thee what, says Rainbow, our king is in great grief
 	 That thou shouldst lye upon the sea and play the arrant thief,
 287A.7	 And will not let our merchants ships pass as they did before;
 	 Such tydings to our king is come, which grieves his heart full sore.
 	 With that this gallant Rainbow she shot, out of her pride,
 	 Full fifty gallant brass pieces, charged on every side.
 287A.8	 And yet these gallant shooters prevailed not a pin,
 	 Though they were brass on the out-side, brave Ward was steel within;
 	 Shoot on, shoot on, says Captain Ward, your sport well pleaseth me,
 	 And he that first gives over shall yield unto the sea.
 287A.9	 I never wrongd an English ship, but Turk and King of Spain,
 	 For and the jovial Dutch-man as I met on the main.
 	 If I had known your king but one two years before,
 	 I would have savd brave Essex life, whose death did grieve me sore.
 287A.10	 Go tell the King of England, go tell him thus from me,
 	 If he reign king of all the land, I will reign king at sea.
 	 With that the gallant Rainbow shot, and shot, and shot in vain,
 	 And left the rovers company, and returnd home again.
 287A.11	 Our royal king of England, your ships returned again,
 	 For Wards ship is so strong it never will be tane:
 	 O everlasting! says our king, I have lost jewels three,
 	 Which would have gone unto the seas and brought proud Ward to me.
 287A.12	 The first was Lord Clifford, Earl of Cumberland;
 	 The second was the lord Mountjoy, as you shall understand;
 	 The third was brave Essex, from field would never flee;
 	 Which would a gone unto the seas and brought proud Ward to me.
