 	Says, Lye ye here, fair maid, till day.
 25B.14	O spare me, O spare me, but this single night,
 	And let me gang hame a maiden sae bright.

 <h3 align="CENTER">25[E]: Willies Lyke-Wake</h3>
 <pre>
 
 25[E].1	If my love loves me, she lets me not know,
 	That is a dowie chance;
 	I wish that I the same could do,
 	Tho my love were in France, France,
 	Tho my love were in France.
 25[E.2]	O lang think I, and very lang,
 	And lang think I, I true;
 	But lang and langer will I think
 	Or my love o me rue.
 25[E.3]	I will write a broad letter,
 	And write it sae perfite,
 	That an she winna o me rue,
 	Ill bid her come to my lyke.
 25[E.4]	Then he has written a broad letter,
 	And seald it wi his hand,
 	And sent it on to his true love,
 	As fast as boy could gang.
 25[E.5]	When she looked the letter upon,
 	A light laugh then gae she;
 	But ere she read it to an end,
 	The tear blinded her ee.
 25[E.6]	O saddle to me a steed, father,
 	O saddle to me a steed;
 	For word is come to me this night,
 	That my true love is dead.
 25[E.7]	The steeds are in the stable, daughter,
 	The keys are casten by;
 	Ye cannot won to-night, daughter,
 	To-morrow yese won away.
 25[E.8]	She has cut aff her yellow locks,
 	A little aboon her ee,
 	And she is on to Willies lyke,
 	As fast as gang could she.
 25[E.9]	As she gaed ower yon high hill head,
 	She saw a dowie light;
 	It was the candles at Willies lyke,
 	And torches burning bright.
 25[E.10]	Three o Willies eldest brothers
 	Were making for him a bier;
 	One half o it was gude red gowd,
 	The other siller clear.
 25[E.11]	Three o Willies eldest sisters
 	Were making for him a sark;
 	The one half o it was cambric fine,
 	The other needle wark.
 25[E.12]	Out spake the youngest o his sisters,
 	As she stood on the fleer:
 	How happy would our brother been,
 	If yed been sooner here!
 25[E.13]	She lifted up the green covering,
 	And gae him kisses three;
 	Then he lookd up into her face,
 	The blythe blink in his ee.
 25[E.14]	O then he started to his feet,
 	And thus to her said he:
 	Fair Annie, since were met again,
 	Parted nae mair wese be.
