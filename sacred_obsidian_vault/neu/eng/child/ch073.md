 <h1 align="CENTER">73A: Lord Thomas and Annet</h1>
 <pre>
 
 73A.1	LORD THOMAS and Fair Annet
 	Sate a day on a hill;
 	Whan night was cum, and sun was sett,
 	They had not talkt their fill.
 73A.2	Lord Thomas said a word in jest,
 	Fair Annet took it ill:
 	A, I will nevir wed a wife
 	Against my ain friends will.
 73A.3	Gif ye wull nevir wed a wife,
 	A wife wull neir wed yee:
 	Sae he is hame to tell his mither,
 	And knelt upon his knee.
 73A.4	O rede, O rede, mither, he says,
 	A gude rede gie to mee;
 	O sall I tak the nut-browne bride,
 	And let Fair Annet bee?
 73A.5	The nut-browne bride haes gowd and gear,
 	Fair Annet she has gat nane;
 	And the little beauty Fair Annet haes
 	O it wull soon be gane.
 73A.6	And he has till his brother gane:
 	Now, brother, rede ye mee;
 	A, sall I marrie the nut-browne bride,
 	And let Fair Annet bee?
 73A.7	The nut-browne bride has oxen, brother,
 	The nut-browne bride has kye;
 	I wad hae ye marrie the nut-browne bride,
 	And cast Fair Annet bye.
 	I wad hae ye marrie the nut-browne bride,
 	And cast Fair Annet bye.
 73A.8	Her oxen may dye i the house, billie,
 	And her kye into the byre,
 	And I sall hae nothing to mysell
 	Bot a fat fadge by the fyre.
 73A.9	And he has till his sister gane:
 	Now, sister, rede ye mee;
 	O sall I marrie the nut-browne bride,
 	And set Fair Annet free?
 73A.10	Ise rede ye tak Fair Annet, Thomas,
 	And let the browne bride alane;
 	Lest ye sould sigh, and say, Alace,
 	What is this we brought hame!
 73A.11	No, I will tak my mithers counsel,
 	And marrie me owt o hand;
 	And I will tak the nut-browne bride,
 	Fair Annet may leive the land.
 73A.12	Up then rose Fair Annets father,
 	Twa hours or it wer day,
 	And he is gane into the bower
 	Wherein Fair Annet lay.
 73A.13	Rise up, rise up, Fair Annet, he says,
 	Put on your silken sheene;
 	Let us gae to St. Maries kirke,
 	And see that rich weddeen.
 73A.14	My maides, gae to my dressing-roome,
 	And dress to me my hair;
 	My maides, gae to my dressing-roome,
 	And dress to me my hair;
 	Whaireir yee laid a plait before,
 	See yee lay ten times mair.
 73A.15	My maids, gae to my dressing-room,
 	And dress to me my smock;
 	The one half is o the holland fine,
 	The other o needle-work.
 73A.16	The horse Fair Annet rade upon,
 	He amblit like the wind;
 	Wi siller he was shod before,
 	Wi burning gowd behind.
 73A.17	Four and twanty siller bells
 	Wer a tyed till his mane,
 	And yae tift o the norland wind,
 	They tinkled ane by ane.
 73A.18	Four and twanty gay gude knichts
 	Rade by Fair Annets side,
 	And four and twanty fair ladies,
 	As gin she had bin a bride.
 73A.19	And whan she cam to Maries kirk,
 	She sat on Maries stean:
 	The cleading that Fair Annet had on
 	It skinkled in their een.
 73A.20	And whan she cam into the kirk,
 	She shimmerd like the sun;
 	The belt that was about her waist
 	Was a wi pearles bedone.
 73A.21	She sat her by the nut-browne bride,
 	And her een they wer sae clear,
 	Lord Thomas he clean forgat the bride,
 	Whan Fair Annet drew near.
 73A.22	He had a rose into his hand,
 	He gae it kisses three,
 	And reaching by the nut-browne bride,
 	Laid it on Fair Annets knee.
 73A.23	Up than spak the nut-browne bride,
 	She spak wi meikle spite:
 	And whair gat ye that rose-water,
 	That does mak yee sae white?
 73A.24	O I did get the rose-water
 	Whair ye wull neir get nane,
 	For I did get that very rose-water
 	Into my mithers wame.
 73A.25	The bride she drew a long bodkin
 	Frae out her gay head-gear,
 	And strake Fair Annet unto the heart,
 	That word spak nevir mair.
 73A.26	Lord Thomas he saw Fair Annet wex pale,
 	And marvelit what mote bee;
 	But whan he saw her dear hearts blude,
 	A wood-wroth wexed hee.
 73A.27	He drew his dagger, that was sae sharp,
 	That was sae sharp and meet,
 	And drave it into the nut-browne bride,
 	That fell deid at his feit.
 73A.28	Now stay for me, dear Annet, he sed,
 	Now stay, my dear, he cryd;
 	Then strake the dagger untill his heart,
 	And fell deid by her side.
 73A.29	Lord Thomas was buried without kirk-wa,
 	Fair Annet within the quiere,
 	And o the tane thair grew a birk,
 	The other a bonny briere.
 73A.30	And ay they grew, and ay they threw,
 	As they wad faine be neare;
 	And by this ye may ken right weil
 	They were twa luvers deare.

 	They wad na got their fill.
 73B.2	But Willie spak a word amiss,
 	Fair Annie took it ill:

 73B.5	Come riddle us, riddle us, father dear,
 	Yea both of us into ane;
 	Whether sall I marry Fair Annie,

 73B.6	The brown bride she has houses and land,
 	And Annie she has nane;
 	Sae on my blessing, my auld son,
 	Bring ye Brown Bride hame.
 73B.7	Then he is to his mithers bouer,
 	And tirled at the pin;
 	Then up and rose his mother dear
 	To let Sweet Willie in.
 73B.8	Come riddle us, riddle us, mother dear,
 	Yea baith o us into ane;
 	Whether sall I marry Fair Annie,
 	Or bring the brown bride hame?
 73B.9	The brown bride she has gowd and gear,
 	Fair Annie she has nane;
 	And for my blessing, my auld son,

 	And tirled at the pin;
 	And wha sae ready as his sister dear
 	To let her brither in.
 73B.11	Come riddle us, riddle us, sister fair,
 	Us baith yea into ane;
 	Whether sall I marry Fair Annie,
 	Or bring the brown bride hame?
 73B.12	The brown bride she has horse and kye,
 	And Annie she has nane;
 	But for my love, my brither dear,
 	Bring hame the fair woman.
 73B.13	Your horse may dee into the staw,
 	The kye into the byre,
 	And yell hae nocht but a howther o dirt,
 	To feed about your fire.
 73B.14	Then he is to Fair Annies bouer,
 	And tirled at the pin;
 	And wha sae ready as Fair Annie
 	To let Sweet Willie in.
 73B.15	Youre welcome here to me, Willie,
 	Youre welcome here to me:
 	Im na welcome to thee, Annie,
 	Im na welcome to thee,
 	For Im come to bid ye to my wedding,
 	Its gey sad news to thee.
 73B.16	Its gey sad news to me, Willie,
 	The saddest ye could tell;
 	Its gey sad news to me, Willie,
 	That shoud been bride mysel.
 73B.17	Then she is to her father gane,
 	And bowed low on her knee:
 	. . . . .
 	. . . . .
 73B.18	Come riddle us, riddle us, father dear,
 	Us baith yea into ane;
 	Whether sall I gang to Willies wedding,
 	Or sall I stay at hame?
 73B.19	Whare ane will be your frien, Annie,
 	Twenty will be your fae;
 	But prove it gude, or prove it bad,
 	To Willies wedding Ill gae.
 73B.20	Ill na put on the grisly black,
 	Nor yet the dowie green,
 	But Ill put on a scarlet robe
 	To sheen like onie queen.
 73B.21	Shes orderd the smiths to the smithy,
 	To shoe her a riding steed;
 	She has orderd the tailors to her bouer,
 	To dress her a riding weed.
 73B.22	She has calld her maries to her bour,
 	To lay gowd on her hair:
 	Whare eer ye put ae plait before,
 	See ye lay ten times mair.
 73B.23	The steed Fair Annie rade upon,
 	He bounded like the wind;
 	Wi silver he was shod before,
 	Wi burning gowd behind.
 73B.24	And four and twenty siller bells
 	War ti d til his mane;
 	Wi ae blast o the norland wind
 	They tinkled ane by ane.
 73B.25	And whan she cam unto the place,
 	And lichted on the green,
 	Ilka ane that did her see
 	Thought that she was a queen.
 73B.26	Is this your bride, Sweet Willie? she said,
 	I think shes wondrous wan;
 	Ye micht have had as fair a bride
 	As eer the sun sheend on.
 73B.27	O haud your tongue, Fair Annie, he said,
 	Wi your talk let me abee;
 	For better I loe your little finger
 	Than the brown brides haill bodie.
 73B.28	Then out and spak the nut-brown bride,
 	And she spak out of spite:
 	O whare gat ye the water, Annie,
 	That washd your face sae white?
 73B.29	O I gat een the water, quo she,
 	Whare ye will neer get nane;
 	Its I gat een the water, quo she,
 	Aneath yon marble stane.
 73B.30	Then out and spake the nut-brown bride,
 	And she spak yet again:
 	O whare gat ye the claith, Annie,
 	That dried your face sae clean?
 73B.31	O I gat een the claith, quo she,
 	Whare ye will neer get nane;
 	Its I gat een the claith, quo she,
 	Aneath yon bouer o bane.
 73B.32	The brown bride had a little penknife,
 	Which she kept secret there;
 	She stabbd Fair Annie to the heart,
 	A deep wound and a sair.
 73B.33	Its out and spak he Sweet Willie,
 	And he spak yet again:
 	O whats the matter wi thee, Annie,
 	That ye do look sae wan?
 73B.34	Oh are ye blind, Willie? she said,
 	Or do ye no weel see?
 	I think ye micht see my hearts blude,
 	Come rinning by my knee.
 73B.35	Then Willie took a little sword,
 	Which he kept secret there,
 	And strak the brown bride to the heart,
 	A word she neer spak mair.
 73B.36	And after that a this was dune,
 	He drew it through the strae,
 	And through his ain fair bodie
 	He causd the cauld iron gae.
 73B.37	The last words that Sweet Willie spak,
 	His heart was almaist gane;
 	May never a young man like me
 	Have sic a sad wedding.
 73B.38	For gear will come, and gear will gang,
 	And gears ae but a lend,
 	And monie a ane for warlds gear
 	A silly brown bride brings hame.
 	And monie a ane for warlds gear
 	A silly brown bride brings hame.
 73B.39	Sweet Willie was buried in Marys kirk,
 	And Annie in Marys quire,
 	And out o the ane there grew a birk,
 	And out o the ither a brier.
 73B.40	And ae they grew, and ae they threw,
 	Until the twa did meet,
 	That ilka ane micht plainly see
 	They were true lovers sweet.

 73C.1	COME read my rede, O mother dear,
 	Come riddle it all in one;
 	O whether will I take Fair Annie,
 	Or bring the brown bride home?
 73C.2	The brown, brown bride has kye and ewes,
 	Fair Annie she has none;
 	She has nothing but a bonny, bonny face,
 	And thatll soon be gone.
 73C.3	Where will I get a pretty little boy,
 	Thatll rin my errands soon,
 	That will rin to Fair Annies bower,
 	And bid her to my wedding?
 73C.4	Here am I, a pretty little boy,
 	Thatll rin your errands soon,
 	That will rin to Fair Annies bower,
 	And bid her to your wedding.
 73C.5	Forbid her to put on her silks so black,
 	Or yet her silks so brown;
 	But she must put on her suddled silks,
 	That she wears up and down.
 73C.6	Forbid her to put on her silks so green,
 	Or yet her sils so gray;
 	But she must put on her suddled silks,
 	That she wears every day.
 73C.7	When he gade to Fair Annies bower,
 	He tirled at the pin;
 	So ready was Fair Annie hersell
 	To open and let him in.
 73C.8	What news, what news, my little boy?
 	What news hast thou to me?
 	You must prepare for Lord Thomas wedding,
 	And thats bad news for thee.
 73C.9	Good news, good news, Fair Annie says,
 	Good news is it for me,
 	For me to be bride and him bridegroom,
 	And thats good news for me.
 73C.10	He forbids thee to put on thy silks so black,
 	Or yet thy silks so brown;
 	But thou must put on thy suddled silks,
 	That thou wears up and down.
 73C.11	He forbids you to put on thy silks so green,
 	Or yet thy silks so gray;
 	But thou must on thy suddled silks,
 	That thou wears every day.
 73C.12	There are smiths into my smiddy-bour
 	Thatll dress to me a steed,
 	There are tailors in my tailor-house
 	Thatll dress to me a weed.
 73C.13	There are maidens in my maiden-bower
 	Thatll lay gold in my hair,
 	And where eer there were ane link before,
 	It shall be nine times mair.
 73C.14	Then Annie got herself attired,
 	In all things very fine,
 	With red ribbons, and silks so fair,
 	That owre her shoulders shine.
 73C.15	When she came to Lord Thomas yett,
 	She shined amang them a,
 	And the buttons on Lord Thomas coat
 	Brusted and brak in twa.
 73C.16	Brown, brown is your steed, she says,
 	But browner is your bride;
 	But gallant is that handkerchy
 	That hideth her din hide.
 73C.17	O hold thy peace, Fair Annie, he says,
 	Speak not of that to me,
 	For happy is that bonny, bonny lad
 	That leads his life with thee.
 73C.18	Then out bespoke the brown, brown bride,
 	And she spoke out with spite:
 	O whare gets thou that water-cherry,
 	That washes thee so white?
 73C.19	I got in my fathers garden,
 	Below an olive tree,
 	And although thou war to seek long seven years
 	That water thoull never see.
 73C.20	Tho thou hast got Lord Thomas hand
 	That water thoull neer see;
 	For thous sunbrunt from thy mothers womb,
 	And thoull never be like me.

 73D.1	LORD THOMAS he was a bold forrester,
 	And a chaser of the kings deer;
 	Fair Ellinor was a fair woman,
 	And Lord Thomas he loved her dear.
 73D.2	Come riddle my riddle, dear mother, he said,
 	And riddle us both as one,
 	Whether I shall marry Fair Ellinor,
 	And let the brown girl alone.
 73D.3	The brown girl she has got houses and lands,
 	And Fair Ellinor she has got none;
 	Therefore I charge you on my blessing
 	To bring me the brown girl home.
 73D.4	And as it befell on a high holidaye,
 	As many did more beside,
 	Lord Thomas he went to Fair Ellinor,
 	That should have been his bride.
 73D.5	But when he came to Fair Ellinors bower,
 	He knocked there at the ring;
 	But who was so ready as Fair Ellinor
 	For to let Lord Thomas in.
 73D.6	What news, what news, Lord Thomas, she said,
 	What news hast thou brought unto me?
 	I am come to bid thee to my wedding,
 	And that is bad news to thee.
 73D.7	Oh God forbid, Lord Thomas, she said,
 	That such a thing should be done;
 	I thought to have been thy bride my own self,
 	And you to have been the brids-groom.
 73D.8	Come riddle my riddle, dear mother, she sayd,
 	And riddle it all in one;
 	Whether I shall go to Lord Thomass wedding,
 	Or whether I shall tarry at home.
 73D.9	Theres many that are your friends, daughter,
 	And many that are your fo;
 	Therefore I charge you on my blessing,
 	To Lord Thomass wedding dont go.
 73D.10	Theres many that are my friends, mother,
 	If a thousand more were my foe,
 	Betide my life, betide my death,
 	To Lord Thomass wedding Ile go.
 73D.11	She cloathed herself in gallant attyre,
 	And her merry men all in green,
 	And as they rid thorough everye towne,
 	They took her to have been a queene.
 73D.12	But when she came to Lord Thomass gate,
 	She knocked there at the ring;
 	But who was so ready as Lord Thomas
 	To lett Fair Ellinor in.
 73D.13	Is this your bride? Fair Ellin she sayd,
 	Methinks she looks wondrous browne;
 	Thou mightest have had as fair a woman
 	As ever trod on the ground.
 73D.14	Despise her not, Fair Ellin, he sayd,
 	Despise her not now unto mee;
 	For better I love thy little finger
 	Than all her whole body.
 73D.15	This browne bride had a little penknife,
 	That was both long and sharp,
 	And betwixt the short ribs and the long
 	Prickd Fair Ellinor to the heart.
 73D.16	Oh Christ now save thee, Lord Thomas he said,
 	Methinks thou lookst wondrous wan;
 	Thou wast usd for to look with as fresh a colour
 	As ever the sun shind on.
 73D.17	Oh art thou blind, Lord Thomas? she sayd,
 	Or canst thou not very well see?
 	Oh dost thou not see my own hearts blood
 	Runs trickling down my knee?
 73D.18	Lord Thomas he had a sword by his side,
 	As he walked about the hall;
 	He cut off his brides head from her shoulders,
 	And he threw it against the wall.
 73D.19	He set the hilte against the ground,
 	And the point against his heart;
 	There was never three lovers that ever met
 	More sooner they did depart.

 73E.42	The tane was buried in Marys kirk,
 	The tither in Marys quire,
 	And out o the tane there grew a birk,
 	And out o the tither a brier.
 73E.43	And ay they grew, and ay the drew,
 	Untill they twa did meet,
 	And every ane that past them by
