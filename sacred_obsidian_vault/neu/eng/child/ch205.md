 <h1 align="CENTER">205A: Loudon Hill, or Dromclog</h1>
 <pre>
 
 205A.1	 YOURRrrL marvel when I tell ye o
 	 Our noble Burly and his train,
 	 When last he marchd up through the land,
 	 Wi sax-and-twenty westland men.
 205A.2	 Than they I neer o braver heard,
 	 For they had a baith wit and skill;
 	 They proved right well, as I heard tell,
 	 As they cam up oer Loudoun Hill.
 205A.3	 Weel prosper a the gospel-lads
 	 That are into the west countrie
 	 Ay wicked Claverse to demean,
 	 And ay an ill dead may he die!
 205A.4	 For hes drawn up i battle rank,
 	 An that baith soon an hastilie;
 	 But they wha live till simmer come,
 	 Some bludie days for this will see.
 205A.5	 But up spak cruel Claverse then,
 	 Wi hastie wit an wicked skill,
 	 Gae fire on yon westlan men;
 	 I think it is my sovreigns will.
 205A.6	 But up bespake his cornet then,
 	 Its be wi nae consent o me;
 	 I ken Ill neer come back again,
 	 An mony mae as weel as me.
 205A.7	 There is not ane of a yon men
 	 But wha is worthy other three;
 	 There is na ane amang them a
 	 That in his cause will stap to die.
 205A.8	 An as for Burly, him I knaw;
 	 Hes a man of honour, birth, an fame;
 	 Gie him a sword into his hand,
 	 Hell fight thysel an other ten.
 205A.9	 But up spake wicked Claverse then-+--+-
 	 I wat his heart it raise fu hie-+--+-
 	 And he has cryd, that a might hear,
 	 Man, ye hae sair deceived me.
 205A.10	 I never kend the like afore,
 	 Na, never since I came frae hame,
 	 That you sae cowardly here suld prove,
 	 An yet come of a noble Gra+eme.
 205A.11	 But up bespake his cornet then,
 	 Since that it is your honours will,
 	 Mysel shall be the foremost man
 	 That shall gie fire on Loudoun Hill.
 205A.12	 Your command Ill lead them on,
 	 But yet wi nae consent o me;
 	 For weel I ken Ill neer return,
 	 And mony mae as weel as me.
 205A.13	 Then up he drew in battle rank-+--+-
 	 I wat he had a bonny train-+--+-
 	 But the first time that bullets flew
 	 Ay he lost twenty o his men.
 205A.14	 Then back he came the way he gaed,
 	 I wat right soon an suddenly;
 	 He gave command amang his men,
 	 And sent them back, and bade them flee.
 205A.15	 Then up came Burly, bauld an stout,
 	 Wi s little train o westland men,
 	 Wha mair than either aince or twice
 	 In Edinburgh confind had been.
 205A.16	 They hae been up to London sent,
 	 An yet theyre a come safely down;
 	 Sax troop o horsemen they hae beat,
 	 And chased them into Glasgow town.
