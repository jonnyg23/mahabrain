 <h1 align="CENTER">42A: Clerk Colvill</h1>
 <pre>
 
 42A.1	CLARK COLVEN and his gay ladie,
 	As they walked to yon garden green,
 	A belt about her middle gimp,
 	Which cost Clark Colven crowns fifteen:
 42A.2	O hearken weel now, my good lord,
 	O hearken weel to what I say;
 	When ye gang to the wall o Stream,
 	O gang nae neer the well-fared may.
 42A.3	O haud your tongue, my gay ladie,
 	Tak nae sic care o me;
 	For I nae saw a fair woman
 	I like so well as thee.
 42A.4	He mounted on his berry-brown steed,
 	And merry, merry rade he on,
 	Till he came to the wall o Stream,
 	And there he saw the mermaiden.
 42A.5	Ye wash, ye wash, ye bonny may,
 	And ays ye wash your sark o silk:
 	Its a for you, ye gentle knight,
 	My skin is whiter than the milk.
 42A.6	Hes taen her by the milk-white hand,
 	Hes taen her by the sleeve sae green,
 	And hes forgotten his gay ladie,
 	And away with the fair maiden.
 	* * * * *
 42A.7	Ohon, alas! says Clark Colven,
 	And aye sae sairs I mean my head!
 	And merrily leugh the mermaiden,
 	O win on till you be dead.
 42A.8	But out ye tak your little pen-knife,
 	And frae my sark ye shear a gare;
 	Row that about your lovely head,
 	And the pain yell never feel nae mair.
 42A.9	Out he has taen his little pen-knife,
 	And frae her sark hes shorn a gare,
 	Rowed that about his lovely head,
 	But the pain increased mair and mair.
 42A.10	Ohon, alas! says Clark Colven,
 	An aye sae sairs I mean my head!
 	And merrily laughd the mermaiden,
 	It will ay be war till ye be dead.
 42A.11	Then out he drew his trusty blade,
 	And thought wi it to be her dead,
 	But shes become a fish again,
 	And merrily sprang into the fleed.
 42A.12	Hes mounted on his berry-brown steed,
 	And dowy, dowy rade he home,
 	And heavily, heavily lighted down
 	When to his ladies bower-door he came.
 42A.13	Oh, mither, mither, mak my bed,
 	And, gentle ladie, lay me down;
 	Oh, brither, brither, unbend my bow,
 	Twill never be bent by me again.
 42A.14	His mither she has made his bed,
 	His gentle ladie laid him down,
 	His brither he has unbent his bow,
 	Twas never bent by him again.

 <pre>
 
 42B.1	CLERK COLVILL and his lusty dame
 	Were walking in the garden green;
 	The belt around her stately waist
 	Cost Clerk Colvill of pounds fifteen.
 42B.2	O promise me now, Clerk Colvill,
 	Or it will cost ye muckle strife,
 	Ride never by the wells of Slane,
 	If ye wad live and brook your life.
 42B.3	Now speak nae mair, my lusty dame,
 	Now speak nae mair of that to me;
 	Did I neer see a fair woman,
 	But I wad sin with her body?
 42B.4	Hes taen leave o his gay lady,
 	Nought minding what his lady said,
 	And hes rode by the wells of Slane,
 	Where washing was a bonny maid.
 42B.5	Wash on, wash on, my bonny maid,
 	That wash sae clean your sark of silk;
 	And weel fa you, fair gentleman,
 	Your body whiter than the milk.
 	* * * * *
 42B.6	Then loud, loud cryd the Clerk Colvill,
 	O my head it pains me sair;
 	Then take, then take, the maiden said,
 	And frae my sark youll cut a gare.
 42B.7	Then shes gied him a little bane-knife,
 	And frae her sark he cut a share;
 	Shes tyd it round his whey-white face,
 	But ay his head it aked mair.
 42B.8	Then louder cryd the Clerk Colvill,
 	O sairer, sairer akes my head;
 	And sairer, sairer ever will,
 	The maiden crys, Till you be dead.
 42B.9	Out then he drew his shining blade,
 	Thinking to stick her where she stood,
 	But she was vanishd to a fish,
 	And swam far off, a fair mermaid.
 42B.10	O mother, mother, braid my hair;
 	My lusty lady, make my bed;
 	O brother, take my sword and spear,
 	For I have seen the false mermaid.
