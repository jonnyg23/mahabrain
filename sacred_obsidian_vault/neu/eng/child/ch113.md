 <h1 align="CENTER">113: The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry</h1>
 <pre>
 
 113.1	 AN eartly nourris sits and sing,
 	 And aye she sings, Ba, lily wean!
 	 Little ken I my bairnis father,
 	 Far less the land that he staps in.
 113.2	 Then ane arose at her bed-fit,
 	 An a grumly guest Im sure was he:
 	 Here am I, thy bairnis father,
 	 Although that I be not comelie.
 113.3	 I am a man, upo the lan,
 	 An I am a silkie in the sea;
 	 And when Im far and far frae lan,
 	 My dwelling is in Sule Skerrie.
 113.4	 It was na weel, quo the maiden fair,
 	 It was na weel, indeed, quo she,
 	 That the Great Silkie of Sule Skerrie
 	 Suld hae come and aught a bairn to me.
 113.5	 Now he has taen a purse of goud,
 	 And he has pat it upo her knee,
 	 Sayin, Gie to me my little young son,
 	 An tak thee up thy nourris-fee.
 113.6	 An it sall come to pass on a simmers day,
 	 When the sin shines het on evera stane,
 	 That I will tak my little young son,
 	 An teach him for to swim the faem.
 113.7	 An thu sall marry a proud gunner,
 	 An a proud gunner Im sure hell be,
 	 An the very first schot that ere he schoots,
 	 Hell schoot baith my young son and me.
