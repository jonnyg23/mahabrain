 <h1 align="CENTER">46A: Captain Wedderburns Courtship</h1>
 <pre>
 
 46A.1	THE laird of Bristolls daughter was in the woods walking,
 	And by came Captain Wetherbourn, a servant to the king;
 	And he said to his livery man, Wert not against the law,
 	I would tak her to mine ain bed, and lay her neist the wa.
 46A.2	Im into my fathers woods, amongst my fathers trees,
 	O kind sir, let mee walk alane, O kind sir, if you please;
 	The butlers bell it will be rung, and Ill be mist awa;
 	Ill lye into mine ain bed, neither at stock nor wa.
 46A.3	O my bonny lady, the bed its not be mine,
 	For Ill command my servants for to call it thine;
 	The hangings are silk satin, the sheets are holland sma,
 	And wes baith lye in ae bed, but yous lye neist the wa.
 46A.4	And so, my bonny lady, -+-I do not know your name,-+-
 	But my names Captain Wetherburn, and Im a man of fame;
 	Tho your father and a his men were here, I would na stand in awe
 	To tak you to mine ain bed, and lay you neist the wa.
 46A.5	Oh my bonny, bonny lady, if youll gie me your hand,
 	You shall hae drums and trumpets to sound at your command;
 	Wi fifty men to guard you, sae weel their swords can dra,
 	And wees baith lye in ae bed, but yous lye neist the wa.
 46A.6	Hes mounted her upon a steid, behind his gentleman,
 	And he himself did walk afoot, to had his lady on,
 	With his hand about her midle sae jimp, for fear that she should fa;
 	She man lye in his bed, but shell not lye neist the wa.
 46A.7	Hes taen her into Edinburgh, his landlady cam ben:
 	And monny bonny ladys in Edinburgh hae I seen,
 	But the like of this fine creature my eyes they never sa;
 	O dame bring ben a down-bed, for shes lye neist the wa.
 46A.8	Hold your tongue, young man, she said, a+end dinna trouble me,
 	Unless you get to my supper, and that is dishes three;
 	Dishes three to my supper, tho I eat nane at a,
 	Before I lye in your bed, but I winna lye neist the wa.
 46A.9	You maun get to my supper a cherry but a stane,
 	And you man get to my supper a capon but a bane,
 	And you man get a gentle bird that flies wanting the ga,
 	Before I lye in your bed, but Ill not lye neist the wa.
 46A.10	A cherry whan in blossom is a cherry but a stane;
 	A capon when hes in the egg canna hae a bane;
 	The dow it is a gentle bird that flies wanting the ga;
 	And ye man lye in my bed, between me and the wa.
 46A.11	Hold your tongue, young man, she said, a+end dinna me perplex,
 	Unless you tell me questions, and that is questions six;
 	Tell me them as I shall ask them, and that is twa by twa,
 	Before I lye in your bed, but Ill not lye neist the wa.
 46A.12	What is greener than the grass, whats higher than the tree?
 	Whats war than a womans wiss, whats deeper than the sea?
 	What bird sings first, and whereupon the dew down first does fa?
 	Before I lye in your bed, but Ill lye neist the wa.
 46A.13	Virgus is greener than the grass, heavens higher than the tree;
 	The deils war than a womans wish, hells deeper than the sea;
 	The cock sings first, on the Sugar Loaf the dew down first does fa;
 	And ye man lye in my bed, betweest me and the wa.
 46A.14	Hold your tongue, young man, she said, I pray you give it oer,
 	Unless you tell me questions, and that is questions four;
 	Tell me them as I shall ask them, and that is twa by twa,
 	Before I lye in your bed, but I winna lye neist the wa.
 46A.15	You man get to me a plumb that does in winter grow;
 	And likewise a silk mantle that never waft gaed thro;
 	A sparrows horn, a priest unborn, this night to join us twa,
 	Before I lye in your bed, but I winna lye neist the wa.
 46A.16	There is a plumb in my fathers yeard that does in winter grow;
 	Likewise he has a silk mantle that never waft gaed thro;
 	A sparrows horn, it may be found, theres ane in every tae,
 	Theres ane upo the mouth of him, perhaps there may be twa.
 46A.17	The priest is standing at the door, just ready to come in;
 	Nae man could sae that he was born, to lie it is a sin;
 	For a wild boar bored him mothers side, he out of it did fa;
 	And you man lye in my bed, between me and the wa.
 46A.18	Little kent Grizey Sinclair, that morning when she raise,
 	Twas to be the hindermost of a her single days;
 	For now shes Captain Wetherburns wife, a man she never saw,
 	And she man lye in his bed, but shell not lye neist the wa.

 <h3 align="CENTER">46B: Captain Wedderburns Courtship</h3>
 <pre>
 
 46B.1	THE Lord of Rosslyns daughter gaed through the wud her lane,
 	And there she met Captain Wedderburn, a servant to the king.
 	He said unto his livery-man, Weret na agen the law,
 	I wad tak her to my ain bed, and lay her at the wa.
 46B.2	Im walking here my lane, she says, amang my fathers trees;
 	And ye may lat me walk my lane, kind sir, now gin ye please.
 	The supper-bell it will be rung, and Ill be missd awa;
 	Sae Ill na lie in your bed, at neither stock nor wa.
 46B.3	He said, My pretty lady, I pray lend me your hand,
 	And yell hae drums and trumpets always at your command;
 	And fifty men to guard ye wi, that weel their swords can draw;
 	Sae well baith lie in ae bed, and yell lie at the wa.
 46B.4	Haud awa frae me, kind sir, I pray let go my hand;
 	The supper-bell it will be rung, nae langer maun I stand.
 	My father hell na supper tak, gif I be missd awa;
 	Sae Ill na lie in your bed, at neither stock nor wa.
 46B.5	O my name is Captain Wedderburn, my name Ill neer deny,
 	And I command ten thousand men, upo yon mountains high.
 	Tho your father and his men were here, of them Id stand na awe,
 	But should tak ye to my ain bed, and lay ye neist the wa.
 46B.6	Then he lap aff his milk-white steed, and set the lady on,
 	And a the way he walkd on foot, he held her by the hand;
 	He held her by the middle jimp, for fear that she should fa;
 	Saying, Ill tak ye to my ain bed, and lay thee at the wa.
 46B.7	He took her to his quartering-house, his landlady looked ben,
 	Saying, Monie a pretty ladie in Edinbruch Ive seen;
 	But sic na pretty ladie is not into it a:
 	Gae, mak for her a fine down-bed, and lay her at the wa.
 46B.8	O haud awa frae me, kind sir, I pray ye lat me be,
 	For Ill na lie in your bed till I get dishes three;
 	Dishes three maun be dressd for me, gif I should eat them a,
 	Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.
 46B.9	Tis I maun hae to my supper a chicken without a bane;
 	And I maun hae to my supper a cherry without a stane;
 	And I maun hae to my supper a bird without a gaw,
 	Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.
 46B.10	Whan the chickens in the shell, I am sure it has na bane;
 	And whan the cherrys in the bloom, I wat it has na stane;
 	The dove she is a genty bird, she flees without a gaw;
 	Sae well baith lie in ae bed, and yell be at the wa.
 46B.11	O haud awa frae me, kind sir, I pray ye give me owre,
 	For Ill na lie in your bed, till I get presents four;
 	Presents four ye maun gie me, and that is twa and twa,
 	Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.
 46B.12	Tis I maun hae some winter fruit that in December grew;
 	And I maun hae a silk mantil that waft gaed never through;
 	A sparrows horn, a priest unborn, this nicht to join us twa,
 	Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.
 46B.13	My father has some winter fruit that in December grew;
 	My mither has a silk mantil the waft gaed never through;
 	A sparrows horn ye soon may find, theres ane on evry claw,
 	And twa upo the gab o it, and ye shall get them a.
 46B.14	The priest he stands without the yett, just ready to come in;
 	Nae man can say he eer was born, nae man without he sin;
 	He was haill cut frae his mithers side, and frae the same let fa;
 	Sae well baith lie in ae bed, and yese lie at the wa.
 46B.15	O haud awa frae me, kind sir, I pray dont me perplex,
 	For Ill na lie in your bed till ye answer questions six:
 	Questions six ye maun answer me, and that is four and twa,
 	Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.
 46B.16	O what is greener than the gress, whats higher than thae trees?
 	O what is worse than womens wish, whats deeper than the seas?
 	What bird craws first, what tree buds first, what first does on them fa?
 	Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.
 46B.17	Death is greener than the gress, heaven higher than thae trees;
 	The devils waur than womens wish, hells deeper than the seas;
 	The cock craws first, the cedar buds first, dew first on them does fa;
 	Sae well baith lie in ae bed, and yese lie at the wa.
 46B.18	Little did this lady think, that morning whan she raise,
 	That this was for to be the last o a her maiden days.
 	But theres na into the kings realm to be found a blither twa,
 	And now shes Mrs. Wedderburn, and she lies at the wa.

 	And by came Captain Wedderburn, a servant to the Queen;
 	He said unto his serving man, Wert not agaynst the law,
 	I would tak her to my ain house as lady o my ha.
 46C.2	He said, My pretty ladye, I pray give me your hand;
 	You shall have drums and trumpets always at your command;
 	With fifty men to guard you, that well their swords can draw,
 	And Ill tak ye to my ain bed, and lay you next the wa.
 46C.3	Im walking in my feythers shaws: quo he, My charming maid,

 46C.6	You must get me to my supper a chicken without a bone;
 	You must get me to my supper a cherry without a stone;
 	You must get me to my supper a bird without a ga,

 46C.7	When the cherry is in the bloom, Im sure it has no stone;
 	When the chickens in the shell, Im sure it has nae bone;
 	The dove she is a gentil bird, and flies without a ga;
 	So Ive answered you your questions three, and youre lady of my ha.

 	The devils worse than womans voice; hells deeper than the seas;
 	. . . . . .
 	. . . . .
 46C.10	One question still you must answer me, or you I laugh to scorn;
 	Go seek me out an English priest, of woman never born;
 	. . . . . .
 	. . . . .
 46C.11	Oh then, quo he, My young brother from mothers side was torn,
