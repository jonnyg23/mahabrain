 	 Bridegroom and a was ready;
 	 Stop, says he, My nobles a,
 	 For Ive left something behind me.
 215H.2	 It is your blessing, mother dear,
 	 To bound [to] the bride-styl with me:
 	 Gods blessing now, my son, says she,
 	 And mine and a gang wi ye!

 	 And joy was in their gallant company;
 	 Its they have ridden up, and they have ridden down,
 	 Till they came to the water o Gemrie.
 215H.5	 When they came to the water, it was flooded;
 	 In the middle Sweet William he fell;
 	 The spray brook over his horses mane,
 	 And the wind sang his funeral knell.
 215H.6	 O much is the pity! O much is the pity!

 	 Hadna my son there men enew
 	 To hae taken his steed from him?
 215H.11	 Theyve ridden up, theyve ridden down,
 	 Till they came to the kirk o Gemrie;
 	 There they saw his winsome bride,
 	 Alone at the kirk-style standing.
 215H.12	 Where away is the man, says she,
 	 That promised me fair wedding?
 	 This day he vowd to meet me here,

 	 Until that shes gotten his body,
 	 And shes laid it on the green, green grass,
 	 And flung her mantle oer him.
 215H.16	 O Willie was red, but O now hes white!
 	 And Willie was wondrous bonny,
 	 And Willie said hed marry me,
 	 Gin ere he married oney.
 215H.17	 He was red, he was white, he was my delight,
 	 And aye, aye I thought him bonny;
 	 But now since Willie has dyd for me,
 	 I will sleep wi him in the same grave at Gemrie.
