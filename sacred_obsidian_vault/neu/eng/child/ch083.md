 	And he tooke his siluer combe in his hand,
 	To kembe his yellow lockes.
 83A.3	He sayes, Come hither, thou litle foot-page,
 	That runneth lowlye by my knee,
 	Ffor thou shalt goe to Iohn Stewards wiffe
 	And pray her speake with mee.

 	Euer soe well froe mee.
 83A.5	And, as itt falls, as many times
 	As knotts beene knitt on a kell,
 	Or merchant men gone to leeue London,
 	Either to buy ware or sell.
 83A.6	And, as itt falles, as many times
 	As any hart can thinke,
 	Or schoole-masters are in any schoole-house,
 	Writting with pen and inke:
 	Ffor if I might, as well as shee may,
 	This night I wold with her speake.
 83A.7	And heere I send her a mantle of greene,
 	As greene as any grasse,
 	And bidd her come to the siluer wood,
 	To hunt with Child Maurice.
 83A.8	And there I send her a ring of gold,
 	A ring of precyous stone,
 	And bidd her come to the siluer wood,
 	Let for no kind of man.
 83A.9	One while this litle boy he yode,
 	Another while he ran,
 	Vntill he came to Iohn Stewards hall,
 	I-wis he neuer blan.
 83A.10	And of nurture the child had good,
 	Hee ran vp hall and bower free,
 	And when he came to this lady faire,
 	Sayes, God you saue and see!
 	And when he came to this lady faire,
 	Sayes, God you saue and see!
 	And when he came to this lady faire,
 	Sayes, God you saue and see!
 83A.11	I am come from Ch[i]ld Maurice,
 	A message vnto thee;
 	And Child Maurice, he greetes you well,
 	And euer soe well from mee.
 83A.12	And, as itt falls, as oftentimes
 	As knotts beene knitt on a kell,
 	Or marchant-men gone to leeue London,
 	Either for to buy ware or sell.
 83A.13	And as oftentimes he greetes you well
 	As any hart can thinke,
 	Or schoolemasters [are] in any schoole,
 	Wryting with pen and inke.
 83A.14	And heere he sends a mantle of greene,
 	As greene as any grasse,
 	And he bidds you come to the siluer wood,
 	To hunt with Child Maurice.
 83A.15	And heere he sends you a ring of gold,
 	A ring of the precyous stone;
 	He prayes you to come to the siluer wood,
 	Let for no kind of man.
 83A.16	Now peace, now peace, thou litle foot-page,
 	Ffor Christes sake, I pray thee!
 	Ffor if my lord heare one of these words,
 	Thou must be hanged hye!
 83A.17	Iohn Steward stood vnder the castle-wall,
 	And he wrote the words euerye one,
 	. . . . . .
 	. . . . .
 83A.18	And he called vnto his hors-keeper,
 	Make readye you my steede!
 	I, and soe hee did to his chamberlaine,
 	Make readye thou my weede!
 83A.19	And he cast a lease vpon his backe,
 	And he rode to the siluer wood,
 	And there he sought all about,
 	About the siluer wood.
 83A.20	And there he found him Child Maurice
 	Sitting vpon a blocke,
 	With a siluer combe in his hand,
 	Kembing his yellow locke[s.]
 	* * * * *
 83A.21	But then stood vp him Child Maurice,
 	And sayd these words trulye:
 	I doe not know your ladye, he said,
 	If that I doe her see.
 83A.22	that I doe her see.
 83A.22	He sayes, How now, how now, Child Maurice?
 	Alacke, how may this bee?
 	Ffor thou hast sent her loue-tokens,
 	More now then two or three.
 83A.23	Ffor thou hast sent her a mantle of greene,
 	As greene as any grasse,
 	And bade her come to the siluer woode,
 	To hunt with Child Maurice.
 83A.24	And thou [hast] sent her a ring of gold,
 	A ring of the precyous stone,
 	And bade her come to the siluer wood,
 	Let for no kind of man.
 83A.25	And by my faith, now, Child Maurice,
 	The tone of vs shall dye!
 	Now be my troth, sayd Child Maurice,
 	And that shall not be I.
 	And soe fast he smote att Iohn Steward,
 83A.26	But hee pulled forth a bright browne sword,
 	And dryed itt on the grasse,
 	And the first good stroke Iohn Stewart stroke,
 	I-wisse he neuer [did] rest.
 83A.27	Then hee pulled forth his bright browne sword,
 	And dryed itt on his sleeue,
 	And the first good stroke Iohn Stewart stroke,
 	Child Maurice head he did cleeue.
 83A.28	And he pricked itt on his swords poynt,
 	Went singing there beside,
 	And he rode till he came to that ladye faire,
 	Wheras this ladye lyed.
 83A.29	And sayes, Dost thou know Child Maurice head,
 	If that thou dost itt see?
 	And lapp itt soft, and kisse itt offt,
 	Ffor thou louedst him better than mee.
 83A.30	But when shee looked on Child Maurice head,
 	Shee neuer spake words but three:
 	I neuer beare no child but one,
 	And you haue slaine him trulye.
 83A.31	Sayes, Wicked be my merrymen all,
 	I gaue meate, drinke, and clothe!
 	But cold they not haue holden me
 	When I was in all that wrath!
 83A.32	Ffor I haue slaine one of the curteousest knights
 That	euer bestrode a steed,
 	Soe haue I done one [of] the fairest ladyes
 That	euer bestrode a steed,
 	Soe haue I done one [of] the fairest ladyes
 That	euer ware womans weede!

 83B.1	CHILD NORYCE is a clever young man,
 	He wavers wi the wind;
 	His horse was silver-shod before,
 	With the beaten gold behind.
 83B.2	He called to his little man John,
 	Saying, You dont see what I see;
 	For O yonder I see the very first woman
 	That ever loved me.
 83B.3	Here is a glove, a glove, he said,
 	Lined with the silver grey;
 	You may tell her to come to the merry greenwood,
 	To speak to Child Nory.
 83B.4	Here is a ring, a ring, he says,
 	Its all gold but the stane;
 	You may tell her to come to the merry greenwood,
 	And ask the leave o nane.
 83B.5	So well do I love your errand, my master,
 	But far better do I love my life;
 	O would ye have me go to Lord Barnards castle,
 	To betray away his wife?
 83B.6	O dont I give you meat, he says,
 	And dont I pay you fee?
 	How dare you stop my errand? he says;
 	My orders you must obey.
 83B.7	O when he came to Lord Bernards castle,
 	He tinkled at the ring;
 	Who was as ready as Lord Barnard himself
 	To let this little boy in?
 83B.8	Here is a glove, a glove, he says,
 	Lined with the silver grey;
 	You are bidden to come to the merry greenwood,
 	To speak to Child Nory.
 83B.9	Here is a ring, a ring, he says,
 	Its all gold but the stane;
 	You are bidden to come to the merry greenwood,
 	And ask the leave o nane.
 83B.10	Lord Barnard he was standing by,
 	And an angry man was he:
 	O little did I think there was a lord in the world
 	My lady loved but me!
 83B.11	O he dressed himself in the holland smock,
 	And garments that was gay,
 	And he is away to the merry green-wood,
 	To speak to Child Nory.
 83B.12	Child Noryce sits on yonder tree,
 	He whistles and he sings:
 	O wae be to me, says Child Noryce,
 	Yonder my mother comes!
 83B.13	Child Noryce he came off the tree,
 	His mother to take off the horse:
 	Och alace, alace, says Child Noryce,
 	My mother was neer so gross!
 83B.14	Lord Barnard he had a little small sword,
 	That hung low down by his knee;
 	He cut the head off Child Noryce,
 	And put the body on a tree.
 83B.15	And when he came home to his castell,
 	And to his ladies hall,
 	He threw the head into her lap,
 	Saying, Lady, theres a ball!
 83B.16	She turned up the bloody head,
 	She kissed it frae cheek to chin:
 	Far better do I love this bloody head
 	Than all my royal kin.
 83B.17	When I was in my fathers castel,
 	In my virginity,
 	There came a lord into the North,
 	Gat Child Noryce with me.
 83B.18	O wae be to thee, Lady Margaret, he sayd,
 	And an ill death may you die;
 	For if you had told me he was your son,
 	He had neer been slain by me.

 83E.1	CHIELD MORRICE was an earls son,
 	His name it waxed wide;
 	It was nae for his parentage,
 	Nor yet his meikle pride,
 	But it was for a lady gay,
 	That lived on Carron side.
 83E.2	O Willie, my man, my errand gang,
 	And you maun rin wi speed;
 	When other boys run on their feet,
 	On horseback ye shall ride.
 83E.3	O master dear, I love you weel,
 	And I love you as my life,
 	But I will not go to Lord Barnards ha,
 	For to tryst forth his wife.
 83E.4	For the baron hes a man of might,
 	He neer could bide a taunt,
 	And ye shall see or it be late
 	How meikle yell hae to vaunt.
 83E.5	O you must rin my errand, Willie,
 	And you must rin wi speed,
 	And if you dont obey my high command
 	Ill gar your body bleed.

 83E.7	And here it is a holland smock,

 	Bid her come speak to Chield Morice,

 83E.8	Since I must run this errand for you,
 	So sore against my will,
 	Ive made a vow, and Ill keep it true,
 	It shall be done for ill.
 83E.9	For he did not ask the porters leave,
 	Tho he stood at the gate,
 	But straight he ran to the big hall,
 	Where great folk sat at meat.
 83E.10	Good hallow, gentle sir and dame,
 	My errand canno wait;
 	Dame, ye must go speak to Chield Morice,
 	Before it be too late.
 83E.11	And here it is a gay manteel,

 83E.13	O aye she stamped wi her foot,
 	And winked wi her ee,
 	But a that she could say or do,
 	Forbidden he wad na be.
 83E.14	Its surely to my bouir-woman,
 	It canna be to me:
 	I brocht it to Lord Barnards lady,
 	And I trow that thou art she.
 83E.15	Out then spak the wylie nurse,
 	Wi the bairn just on her knee:
 	If this be come fra Chield Morice,
 	Its dear welcome to me.
 83E.16	Thou lies, thou lies, thou wylie nurse,
 	Sae louds I hear thee lie;
 	I brought it to Lord Barnards lady,
 	And I trow thou binna she.
 	I brought it to Lord Barnards lady,
 	And I trow thou binna she.
 83E.17	Then up and rose him the bold baron,
 	And an angry man was he;
 	He took the table wi his foot,
 	And keppd it wi his knee,
 	Till silver cup and ezar dish
 	In flinders they did flee.
 83E.18	Go gring me one of thy cleeding,
 	That hings upon the pin,

 83E.19	I would have you stay at home, Lord Barnard,
 	I would have you stay at home;
 	Never wyte a man for violence douce
 	That never thought you wrong.
 83E.20	And when he to the green-wood went,
 	No body saw he there
 	But Chield Morice, on a milk-white steed,
 	Combing down his yellow hair.
 83E.21	Chield Morice sat in the gay green-wood,
 	He whistled and he sang:
 	O what means a thir folks coming?
 	My mother tarries lang.
 83E.22	mother tarries lang.
 83E.22	No wonder, no wonder, Chield Morice, he said,
 	My lady loved thee weel;
 	For the whitest bit of my body
 	Is blacker than thy heel.
 83E.23	But nevertheless now, Chield Morice,
 	For a thy gay beautie,
 	O nevertheless, Chield Morice,
 	Thy head shall go with me.
 83E.24	He had a rapier by his side,
 	Hung low down by his knee;
 	He struck Chield Morrice on the neck,
 	Till aff his head did flee.
 83E.25	Then hes taen up that bloody head,
 	And stuck it on a spear,
 	And the meanest man in a his train
 	Gat Chield Morice head to bear.
 83E.26	The lady looked owre the castle-wa,
 	Wi meikle dool and down,
 	And there she saw Chield Morice head,
 	Coming trailing to the town.
 83E.27	But hes taen up this bluidy head,
 	And dashed it gainst the wa:
 	Come down, come down, you ladies fair,
 	And play at this foot-ba.
 83E.28	Then shes taen up this bluidy head,
 	And an ill deid may thou die!
 	And she kissed it both cheek and chin:
 	I would rather hae a kiss o that bluidy head
 	Than a thy earldom.
 	I would rather hae a kiss o that bluidy head
 	Than a thy earldom.
 	I would rather hae a kiss o that bluidy head
 	Than a thy earldom.
 83E.29	I got him in my fathers bouir,
 	Wi meikle sin and shame,
 	And I brought him up in gay green-wood,
 	Beneath the heavy rain.
 83E.30	Many a day have I rockd thy cradle,
 	And fondly seen thee sleep,
 	But now Ill go about thy grave,
 	And sore, sore will I weep.
 83E.31	O woe be to thee, thou wild woman,
 	And an ill deid may thou die!
 	For if ye had tauld me he was your son,
 	He should hae ridden and gane wi me.
 83E.32	O hold your tongue, you bold baron,
 	And an ill death may ye die!
 	He had lands and rents enew of his ain,
 	He needed nane fra thee.
 83E.33	Then Ill curse the hand that did the deed,
 	The heart that thought him ill,
 	The feet that carried me speedilie
 	This comely youth to kill.
 83E.34	This lady she died gin ten oclock,
 	Lord Barnard died gin twall,
 	And bonnie boy now, Sweet Willie,
 	Whats come o him I canna tell.

 83F.1	GIL MORRICE was an erles son,
 	His name it waxed wide;
 	It was nae for his great riches,
 	Nor yet his mickle pride,
 	Bot it was for a lady gay,
 	That livd on Carron side.
 83F.2	Whair sall I get a bonny boy,
 	That will win hose and shoen,
 	That will gae to Lord Barnards ha,
 	And bid his lady cum?
 83F.3	And ye maun rin errand, Willie,
 	And ye may rin wi pride;
 	When other boys gae on their foot,
 	On horseback ye sall ride.
 83F.4	O no! Oh no! my master dear,
 	I dare nae for my life;
 	Ill no gae to the bauld barons,
 	For to triest furth his wife.
 83F.5	My bird Willie, my boy Willie,
 	My dear Willie, he sayd,
 	How can ye strive against the stream?
 	For I sall be obeyd.
 83F.6	Bot, O my master dear, he cryd,
 	In grene-wod yere your lain;
 	Gi owre sic thochts, I walde ye rede,
 	For fear ye should be tain.
 	Gi owre sic thochts, I walde ye rede,
 	For fear ye should be tain.
 83F.7	fear ye should be tain.
 83F.7	fear ye should be tain.
 83F.7	Haste, haste, I say, gae to the ha,
 	Bid hir cum here wi speid;
 	If ye refuse my heigh command,
 	Ill gar your body bleid.
 83F.8	Gae bid hir take this gay mantel,
 	Tis a gowd but the hem;
 	Bid hir cum to the gude grene-wode,
 	And bring nane bot hir lain.
 83F.9	And there it is, a silken sarke,
 	Hir ain hand sewd the sleive;
 	And bid her cum to Gill Morice,
 	Speir nae bauld barons leave.
 83F.10	Yes, I will gae your black errand,
 	Though it be to your cost;
 	Sen ye by me will nae be warnd,
 	In it ye sall find frost.
 83F.11	The baron hes a man of might,
 	He neir could bide to taunt;
 	As ye will see, before its nicht,
 	How sma ye hae to vaunt.
 83F.12	And sen I maun your errand rin,
 	Sae sair against my will,
 	Ise mak a vow, and keip it trow,
 	It sall be done for ill.
 83F.13	And when he came to broken brigue,
 	He bent his bow and swam;
 	And when [he] came to grass growing,
 	Set down his feet and ran.
 83F.14	And when he came to Barnards ha,
 	Would neither chap nor ca,
 	Bot set his bent bow to his breist,
 	And lichtly lap the wa.
 83F.15	He wauld nae tell the man his errand,
 	Though he stude at the gait;
 	Bot straiht into the ha he cam,
 	Whair they were set at meit.
 83F.16	Hail! hail! my gentle sire and dame,
 	My message winna waite;
 	Dame, ye maun to the gude grene-wod,
 	Before that it be late.
 83F.17	Yere bidden tak this gay mantel,
 	Tis a gowd bot the hem;
 	You maun gae to the gude grene-wode,
 	Evn by your sel alane.
 83F.18	And there it is, a silken sarke,
 	Your ain hand sewd the sleive;
 	Ye maun gae speik to Gill Morice,
 	Speir nae bauld barons leave.
 83F.19	The lady stamped wi hir foot,
 	And winked wi hir ee;
 	But a that she coud say or do,
 	Forbidden he wad nae bee.
 83F.20	Its surely to my bowr-woman;
 	It neir could be to me:
 	I brocht it to Lord Barnards lady;
 	I trow that ye be she.
 83F.21	Then up and spack the wylie nurse,
 	The bairn upon hir knee:
 	If it be cum frae Gill Morice,
 	Its deir welcum to mee.
 83F.22	Ye leid, ye leid, ye filthy nurse,
 	Sae louds I heire ye lee;
 	I brocht it to Lord Barnards lady;
 	I trow ye be nae shee.
 83F.23	Then up and spack the bauld baron,
 	An angry man was hee;
 	Hes tain the table wi his foot,
 	Sae has he wi his knee,
 	Till siller cup and ezar dish
 	In flinders he gard flee.
 83F.24	Gae bring a robe of your cliding,
 	That hings upon the pin,
 	And Ill gae to the gude grene-wode,
 	And speik wi your lemman.
 83F.25	O bide at hame, now, Lord Barnard,
 	I warde ye bide at hame;
 	Neir wyte a man for violence
 	That neir wate ye wi nane.
 83F.26	Gil Morice sate in gude grene-wode,
 	He whistled and he sang:
 	O what mean a the folk coming?
 	My mother tarries lang.
 83F.27	The baron came to the grene-wode,
 	Wi mickle dule and care,
 	And there he first spied Gill Morice,
 	Kameing his yellow hair.
 83F.28	Nae wonder, nae wonder, Gill Morice,
 	My lady loed thee weel;
 	The fairest part of my body
 	Is blacker than thy heel.
 83F.29	Yet neir the less now, Gill Morice,
 	For a thy great bewty,
 	Yes rew the day ye eir was born;
 	That head sall gae wi me.
 83F.30	Now he has drawn his trusty brand,
 	And slaited on the strae,
 	And thro Gill Morice fair body
 	Hes gard cauld iron gae.
 83F.31	And he has tain Gill Morice head,
 	And set it on a speir;
 	The meanest man in a his train
 	Has gotten that head to bear.
 83F.32	And he has tain Gill Morice up,
 	Laid him across his steid,
 	And brocht him to his painted bowr,
 	And laid him on a bed.
 83F.33	The lady sat on castil-wa,
 	Beheld baith dale and doun,
 	And there she saw Gill Morice head
 	Cum trailing to the toun.
 83F.34	Far better I loe that bluidy head,
 	Bot and that yellow hair,
 	Than Lord Barnard, and a his lands,
 	As they lig here and thair.
 83F.35	And she has tain hir Gill Morice,
 	And kissd baith mouth and chin:
 	I was once as fow of Gill Morice
 	As the hip is o the stean.
 83F.36	I got ye in my fathers house,
 	Wi mickle sin and shame;
 	I brocht thee up in gude green-wode,
 	Under the heavy rain.
 83F.37	Oft have I by thy cradle sitten,
 	And fondly seen thee sleip;
 	Bot now I gae about thy grave,
 	The saut tears for to weip.
 83F.38	And syne she kissd his bluidy cheik,
 	And syne his bluidy chin:
 	O better I loe my Gill Morice
 	Than a my kith and kin!
 83F.39	Away, away, ye ill woman,
 	And an il deith mait ye dee!
 	Gin I had kend hed bin your son,
 	Hed neir bin slain for mee.
