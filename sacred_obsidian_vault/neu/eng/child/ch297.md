 <pre>
 
 297A.1	 O EARL Rothes, an thou wert mine,
 	 And I were to be thy ladie,
 	 I wad drink at the beer, and tipple at the wine,
 	 And be my bottle with any.
 297A.2	 Hold thy tongue, sister Ann, he says,
 	 Thy words they are too many;
 	 What wad ye do wi sae noble a lord,
 	 When he has so noble a ladie?
 297A.3	 O Ill pay you your tocher, Lady Ann,
 	 Both in gear and money,
 	 If yell forsake Earl Rothess companie,
 	 And mind that he has a ladie.
 297A.4	 I do not value your gold, she says,
 	 Your gear its no sae readie;
 	 Ill neer forsake Earl Rothess companie,
 	 And I dont gie a fig for his ladie.
 297A.5	 Ill keep ye i the caslte, Lady Ann,
 	 O servants ye shall hae monie;
 	 Ill keep ye till yere safely brocht to bed,
 	 And Ill mak you a marquiss ladie.
 297A.6	 I do not value your castle, she says,
 	 Your servants are no sae readie;
 	 Earl Rothes will keep me till Im brocht to bed,
 	 And hell mak me a marquiss ladie.
 297A.7	 Woe be to thee, Earl Rothes, he says,
 	 And the mark o the judge be upon thee,
 	 For the using o this poor thing sae,
 	 For the using my sister so badly.
 297A.8	 When Im come to the years of a man,
 	 And able a sword to carry,
 	 Ill thrust it thro Earl Rothes bodie
 	 For the using my sister sae basely.
 297A.9	 Fare thee well, Lady Ann, he says,
 	 No longer will I tarry;
 	 You and I will never meet again,
 	 Till we meet at the bonny town o Torry.
