 <h1 align="CENTER">236A: The Laird o Drum</h1>
 <pre>
 
 236A.1	 O IT fell out upon a day,
 	 When Drums was going to ride, O
 	 And there he met with a well-fard may,
 	 Keeping her flocks on yon side. O
 236A.2	 O fair may, O rare may,
 	 Can not you fancy me?
 	 Of a the lasses here about
 	 I like nane so well as thee.
 236A.3	 Set your love on another, kind sir,
 	 Set it not on me,
 	 For Im not fit to be your bride,
 	 And your whore Ill never be.
 236A.4	 Drums is to her father gane,
 	 Keeping his flocks on yon hill,
 	 And he has gotten his consent,
 	 And the maid was at his will.
 236A.5	 My daughter can neither read nor write,
 	 She was neer brought up at school;
 	 But well can she milk cow and ewe,
 	 And make a kebbuck well.
 236A.6	 Shell winn in your barn at bear-seed time,
 	 Cast out your muck at Yule;
 	 Shell saddle your steed in time o need,
 	 Draw aff your boots hersell.
 236A.7	 Have not I no clergymen?
 	 Pay I no clergy fee?
 	 Ill school her as I think fit,
 	 And as I think fit to be.
 236A.8	 Drums is to the Highlands gane
 	 For to be made ready,
 	 And a the gentry thereabout
 	 Says, Yonder comes Drums and his lady.
 236A.9	 Peggy Coutts is a very bonnie bride,
 	 And Drums is a wealthy laddie;
 	 But Drums might hae chosen a higher match
 	 Than any shepherds daughter.
 236A.10	 Then up bespake his brother John,
 	 Says, Brother youve done us wrong;
 	 Youve married ane below our degree,
 	 A stain to a our kin.
 236A.11	 Hold your tongue, my brother John,
 	 I have done you no wrong;
 	 For Ive married ane to wirk and win,
 	 And yeve married ane to spend.
 236A.12	 The last time that I had a wife,
 	 She was above my degree;
 	 I durst not come in her presence
 	 But with my hat on my knee.
 236A.13	 There was four-and-twenty gentlemen
 	 Stood at the yetts o Drum;
 	 There was na ane amang them a
 	 That welcomd his lady in.
 236A.14	 Hes taen her by the milk-white hand
 	 And led her in himsell,
 	 And in thro has and thro bowers,
 	 And youre welcome, Lady o Drum.
 236A.15	 Thrice he kissd her cherry cheek,
 	 And thrice her cherry chin,
 	 And twenty times her comely mouth,
 	 And youre welcome, Lady o Drum.
 236A.16	 Ye shall be cook in my kitchen,
 	 Butler in my ha;
 	 Ye shall be lady at my command
 	 When I ride far awa.
 236A.17	 But what will I do when auld Drum dies,
 	 When auld Drum dies and leaves me?
 	 Then Ill tak back my word again,
 	 And the Coutts will come and see me.

 	 Put on the silk and scarlet;
 	 Ill make a vow, and keep it true,
 	 Youll neither be miss nor harlot.

 	 Ive married a wife to win my bread,
 	 Youve married ane to spend.
 236D.16	 For the last time that I was married,
 	 She was far abeen my degree;
 	 She wadna gang to the bonny yetts o Drum
 	 But the pearlin abeen her ee,
 	 And I durstna gang in the room where she was
 	 But my hat below my knee.
 236D.17	 When they had eaten and well drunken,
 	 And all men bound for bed,
 	 The Laird o Drum and his lady gay
 	 In ae bed they were laid.
 236D.18	 Gin ye had been o high renown,
 	 As ye are o low degree,
 	 We might hae baith gane down the streets
 	 Amang gude companie.
 236D.19	 I tauld you ere we were wed
 	 You were far abeen my degree;
 	 But now Im married, in your bed laid,
 	 And just as gude as ye.
 236D.20	 Gin ye were dead, and I were dead,
 	 And baith in grave had lain,
 	 Ere seven years were at an end,
 	 Theyd not ken your dust frae mine.
