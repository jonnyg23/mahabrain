 <pre>
 
 269A.1	 THERE was a king, and a very great king,
 	 And a king of meikle fame;
 	 He had not a child in the world but ane,
 	 Lady Daisy was her name.
 269A.2	 He had a very bonnie kitchen-boy,
 	 And William was his name;
 	 He never lay out o Lady Daisys bower,
 	 Till he brought her body to shame.
 269A.3	 When een-birds sung, and een-bells rung,
 	 And a men were boune to rest,
 	 The king went on to Lady Daisys bower,
 	 Just like a wandering ghaist.
 269A.4	 He has drawn the curtains round and round,
 	 And there he has sat him down;
 	 To whom is this, Lady Daisy, he says,
 	 That now you gae so round?
 269A.5	 Is it to a laird? or is it to a lord?
 	 Or a baron of high degree?
 	 Or is it William, my bonnie kitchen-boy?
 	 Tell now the truth to me.
 269A.6	 Its no to a laird, and its no to a lord,
 	 Nor a baron of high degree;
 	 But its to William, your bonnie kitchen-boy:
 	 What cause hae I to lee?
 269A.7	 O where is all my merry, merry men,
 	 That I pay meat and fee,
 	 That they will not take out this kitchen-boy,
 	 And kill him presentlie?
 269A.8	 They hae taen out this bonnie kitchen-boy,
 	 And killd him on the plain;
 	 His hair was like the threads o gold,
 	 His een like crystal stane;
 	 His hair was like the threads o gold,
 	 His teeth like ivory bane.
 269A.9	 They hae taen out this bonnie boys heart,
 	 Put it in a cup o gold;
 	 Take that to Lady Daisy, he said,
 	 For shes impudent and bold;
 	 And she washd it with the tears that ran from her eye
 	 Into the cup of gold.
 269A.10	 Now fare ye weel, my father the king!
 	 You hae taen my earthly joy;
 	 Since hes died for me, Ill die for him,
 	 My bonnie kitchen-boy.
 269A.11	 O where is all my merry, merry men,
 	 That I pay meat and wage,
 	 That they could not withold my cruel hand,
 	 When I was mad with rage?
 269A.12	 I think nae wonder, Lady Daisy, he said,
 	 That he brought your body to shame;
 	 For there never was man of woman born
 	 Sae fair as him that is slain.

 	 And a king of mickle fame,
 	 And he had daughters only one,
 	 Lady Dysmal was her name.
 269C.2	 He had a boy, and a kitchen-boy,
 	 A boy of mickle scorn,
 	 And she lovd him lang, and she loved him aye,
 	 Till the grass oergrew the corn.
 269C.3	 When twenty weeks were gone and past,
 	 O she began to greet!
 	 Her petticoat grew short before,
 	 And her stays they wadna meet.
 269C.4	 It fell upon a winters night
 	 The king could get nae rest;
 	 He cam unto his daughter dear,
 	 Just like a wandring ghaist.
 269C.5	 He cam into her bed-chalmer,
 	 And drew the curtains round:
 	 What aileth thee, my daughter dear?
 	 I fear youve gotten wrong.
 269C.6	 O if I have, despise me not,
 	 For he is all my joy;
 	 I will forsake baith dukes and earls,
 	 And marry your kitchen-boy.
 269C.7	 Go call to me my merry men all,
 	 By thirty and by three;
 	 Go call to me my kitchen-boy,
 	 Well murder him secretlie.
 269C.8	 There was nae din that could be heard,
 	 And neer a word was said,
 	 Till they got him baith fast and sure
 	 Between twa feather-beds.
 269C.9	 Go cut the heart out of his breast,
 	 And put it in a cup of gold,
 	 And present it to his Dysmal dear,
 	 For she is baith stout and bold.

 	 And put it in a cup of gold,
 	 And presented it to his Dysmal dear,
 	 Who was baith stout and bold.

 	 O come to me, my joy!
 	 O come to me, my hinney, my heart
 	 My fathers kitchen-boy!

 	 And set it at her bed-head;
 	 She washd it wi the tears that fell from her eyes,
 	 And next morning she was dead.

 	 Whom I paid meat and wage,
 	 Ye didna hold my cruel hand
 	 When I was in my rage?
 269C.14	 For gone is a my hearts delight,
 	 And gone is a my joy;
 	 For my dear Dysmal she is dead,
 	 And so is my kitchen-boy.

 	 And a for her layen her love so low,
 	 On her fathers kitchn-boy.

 	 Just thinking to get rest,
 	 Up it came her old father,
 	 Just like a wandering ghaist.
 269D.4	 Rise up, rise up, Lady Diamond, he says,
 	 Rise up, put on your gown;
 	 Rise up, rise up, Lady Diamond, he says,
 	 For I fear ye go too roun.
 269D.5	 Too roun I go, ye blame me no,
 	 Ye cause me not to shame;
 	 For better love I that bonny boy
 	 Than all your well-bred men.

 	 Put him between twa feather-beds;

 	 And streakd it on a strow,
 	 And thro and thro that bony boys heart
 	 Hes gart cauld iron go.

 	 Set it on a tasse of gold,
 	 And set it before Lady Diamonds face,
 	 Said, Fair lady, behold!

 	 And holden it in her hand:
 	 Better loved I that bonny, bonny boy
 	 Than all my fathers land.

 	 And laid it at her head;
 	 The tears away frae her eyes did fly,
 	 And ere midnight she was dead.
