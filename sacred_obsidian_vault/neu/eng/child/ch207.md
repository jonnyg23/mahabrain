 <h1 align="CENTER">207A: Lord Delamere</h1>
 <pre>
 
 207A.1	 GOOD people, give attention, a story you shall hear,
 	 It is of the king and my lord Delamere;
 	 The quarrel it arose in the Parliament House,
 	 Concdrning some taxations going to be put in force.
 	 Ri toora loora la.
 207A.2	 Says my lord Delamere to his Majesty soon,
 	 If it please you, my liege, of you Ill soon beg a boon.
 	 Then what is your boon? let me it understand:
 	 Its to have all the poor men you have in your land.
 207A.3	 And Ill take them to Cheshire, and there I will sow
 	 Both hempseed and flaxseed, and [hang] them all in a row.
 	 Why, theyd better be hanged, and stopped soon their breath,
 	 If it please you, my liege, than to starve them to death.
 207A.4	 Then up starts a French lord, as we do hear,
 	 Saying, Thou art a proud Jack, to my lord Delamere;
 	 Thou oughtest to be stabbed-+--+-then he turnd him about-+--+-
 	 For affronting the king in the Parliament House.
 207A.5	 Then up starts his grace, the Duke of Devonshire,
 	 Saying, Ill fight in defence of my lord Delamere.
 	 Then a stage was erected, to battle they went,
 	 To kill or to be killed was our noble dukes intent.
 207A.6	 The very first push, as we do understand,
 	 The dukes sword he bended it back into his hand.
 	 He waited a while, but nothing he spoke,
 	 Till on the kings armour his rapier he broke.
 207A.7	 An English lord, who by that stage did stand,
 	 Threw Devonshire another, and he got it in his hand:
 	 Play low for your life, brave Devonshire, said he,
 	 Play low for your life, or a dead man you will be.
 207A.8	 Devonshire dropped on his knee, and gave him his death-wound;
 	 O then that French lord fell dead upon the ground.
 	 The king called his guards, and he unto them did say,
 	 Bring Devonshire down, and take the dead man away.
 207A.9	 No, if it please you, my liege, no! Ive slain him like a man;
 	 Im resolved to see what clothing hes got on.
 	 Oh, fie upon your treachery, your treachery! said he,
 	 Oh, king, twas your intention to have took my life away.
 207A.10	 For he fought in your armour, whilst I have fought in bare;
 	 The same thou shalt win, king, before thou does it wear.
 	 Then they all turned back to the Parliament House,
 	 And the nobles made obesiance with their hands to their mouths.
 207A.11	 God bless all the nobles we have in our land,
 	 And send the Church of England may flourish still and stand;
 	 For Ive injured no king, no kingdom, nor no crown,
 	 But I wish that every honest man might enjoy his own.

 <h3 align="CENTER">207B: Lord Delamere</h3>
 <pre>
 
 207B.1	 GOOD people give attention to a story you shall hear:
 	 Between the king and my lord Delamere,
 	 A quarrel arose in the Parliament House,
 	 Concerning the taxes to be put in force.
 	 With my fal de ral de ra.
 207B.2	 I wonder, I wonder that James, our good king,
 	 So many hard taxes upon the poor should bring;
 	 So many hard taxes, as I have heard them say,
 	 Makes many a good farmer to break and run away.
 207B.3	 Such a rout has been in the parliament, as I hear,
 	 Betwixt a Dutch lord and my lord Delamere.
 	 He said to the king, as he sat on the throne,
 	 If it please you, my liege, to grant me a boon.
 207B.4	 O what is thy boon? Come. let me understand.
 	 Tis to give me all the poor you have in the land;
 	 Ill take them down to Cheshire, and there I will sow
 	 Both hemp-seed and flax-seed, and hang them in a row.
 207B.5	 Its better, my liege, they should die a shorter death
 	 Than for your Majesty to starve them on earth.
 	 With that up starts a Dutch lord, as we hear,
 	 And he says, Thou proud Jack, to my lord Delamere,
 207B.6	 Thou ought to be stabbed, and he turned him about,
 	 For affronting the king in the Parliament House.
 	 Then up got a brave duke, the Duke of Devonshire,
 	 Who said, I will fight for my lord Delamere.
 207B.7	 He is under age, as Ill make it appear,
 	 So Ill stand in defence of my lord Delamere.
 	 A stage then was built, and to battle they went,
 	 To kill or be killed it was their intent.
 207B.8	 The very first blow, as we understand,
 	 Devonshires rapier went back to his hand;
 	 Then he mused awhile, but not a word spoke,
 	 When against the kings armour his rapier he broke.
 207B.9	 O then he stept backward, and backward stept he,
 	 And then stept forward my lord Willoughby;
 	 He gave him a rapier, and thus he did say;
 	 Play low, Devonshire, theres treachery, I see.
 207B.10	 He knelt on his knee, and he gave him the wound,
 	 With that the Dutch lord fell dead on the ground:
 	 The king calld his soldiers, and thus he did say:
 	 Call Devonshire down, take the dead man away.
 207B.11	 He answered, My liege, Ive killed him like a man,
 	 And it is my intent to see what clothing hes got on.
 	 O treachery! O treachery! as I well may say,
 	 It was your intent, O king, to take my life away.
 207B.12	 He fought in your armour, while I fought him bare,
 	 And thou, king, shalt win it before thou dost it wear;
 	 I neither do curse king, parliament, or throne,
 	 But I wish every honest man may enjoy his own.
 207B.13	 The rich men do flourish with silver and gold,
 	 While poor men are starving with hunger and cold;
 	 And if they hold on as they have begun,
 	 Theyll make little England pay dear for a king.

 <pre>
 
 207C.1	 O THE Duchess of Devonshire was standing hard by;
 	 Upon her dear husband she cast her lovely eye:
 	 Oh, fie upon treachery! theres been treachery I say,
 	 It was your full intent to have taen my dukes life away.
 207C.2	 Then away to the parliament these votes all went again,
 	 And there they acted like just and honest men.
 	 I neither curse my king, nor kingdom, crown or throne,
 	 But I wish every honest man to enjoy but what is his own.

 <h3 align="CENTER">207D: Lord Delamere</h3>
 <pre>
 
 207D.1	 IN the Parliament House a great rout has been there,
 	 Betwixt our good king and the lord Delaware:
 	 Says Lord Delaware to his Majesty full soon,
 	 Will it please you, my liege, to grant me a boon?
 207D.2	 Whats your boon? says the king, Now let me understand.
 	 Its, give me all the poor men weve starving in this land,
 	 And without delay Ill hie me to Lincolnshire,
 	 To sow hemp-seed and flax-seed, and hang them all there.
 207D.3	 For with hempen cord its better to stop each poor mans breath
 	 Than with famine you should see your subjects starve to death.
 	 Up starts a Dutch lord, who to Delaware did say,
 	 Thou deservest to be stabbd! then he turnd himself away.
 207D.4	 Thou deservest to be stabbd, and the dogs have thine ears,
 	 For insulting our king, in this parliament of peers.
 	 Up sprang a Welsh lord, the brave Duke of Devonshire:
 	 In young Delawares defence, Ill fight this Dutch lord, my sire.
 207D.5	 For he is in the right, and Ill make it so appear;
 	 Him I dare to single combat, for insulting Delaware.
 	 A stage was soon erected, and to combat they went;
 	 For to kill or to be killd, it was eithers full intent.
 207D.6	 But the very first flourish, when the heralds gave command,
 	 The sword of brave Devonshire bent backward on his hand.
 	 In suspense he paused a while, scannd his foe before he strake,
 	 Then against the kings armour his bent sword he brake.
 207D.7	 Then he sprang from the stage to a soldier in the ring,
 	 Saying, Lend your sword, that to an end this tragedy we bring.
 	 Though hes fighting me in armour, while I am fighting bare,
 	 Even more than this Id venture for young Lord Delaware.
 207D.8	 Leaping back on the stage, sword to buckler now resounds,
 	 Till he left the Dutch lord a bleeding in his wounds.
 	 This seeing, cries the king to his guards without delay,
 	 Call Devonshire down! take the dead man away!
 207D.9	 No, says brave Devonshire, Ive fought him as a man;
 	 Since hes dead, I will keep the trophies I have won.
 	 For he fought me in your armour, while I fought him bare,
 	 And the same you must win back, my liege, if ever you them wear.
 207D.10	 God bless the Church of England! may it prosper on each hand,
 	 And also every poor man now starving in this land.
 	 And while I pray success may crown our king upon his throne,
 	 Ill wish every poor man may long enjoy his own.
