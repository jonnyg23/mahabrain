 <h1 align="CENTER">117A: The Gest of Robyn Hode</h1>
 <pre>
 
 117A.1	 LYTHE and listin, gentilmen,
 	 That be of frebore blode;
 	 I shall you tel of a gode yeman,
 	 His name was Robyn Hode.
 117A.2	 Robyn was a prude outlaw,
 	 [Whyles he walked on grounde;
 	 So curteyse an outlawe] as he was one
 	 Was never non founde.
 117A.3	 Robyn stode in Bernesdale,
 	 And lenyd hym to a tre;
 	 And bi hym stode Litell Johnn,
 	 A gode yeman was he.
 117A.4	 And alsoo dyd gode Scarlok,
 	 And Much, the millers son;
 	 There was none ynch of his bodi
 	 But it was worth a grome.
 117A.5	 Than bespake Lytell Johnn
 	 All vntoo Robyn Hode:
 	 Maister, and ye wolde dyne betyme
 	 It wolde doo you moche gode.
 117A.6	 Than bespake hym gode Robyn:
 	 To dyne haue I noo lust,
 	 Till that I haue som bolde baron,
 	 Or som vnkouth gest.
 117A.7	 . . . . . . .
 	 That may pay for the best,
 	 Or som knyght or [som] squyer,
 	 That dwelleth here bi west.
 117A.8	 A gode maner than had Robyn;
 	 In londe where that he were,
 	 Euery day or he wold dyne
 	 Thre messis wolde he here.
 117A.9	 The one in the worship of the Fader,
 	 And another of the Holy Gost,
 	 The thirde of Our der  Lady,
 	 That he loued allther moste.
 117A.10	 Robyn loued Oure der  Lady;
 	 For dout of dydly synne,
 	 Wolde he neuer do compani harme
 	 That any woman was in.
 117A.11	 Maistar, than sayde Lytil Johnn,
 	 And we our borde shal sprede,
 	 Tell vs wheder that we shal go,
 	 And what life that we shall lede.
 117A.12	 Where we shall take, where we shall leue,
 	 Where we shall abide behynde;
 	 Where we shall robbe, where we shal reue,
 	 Where we shal bete and bynde.
 117A.13	 Therof no force, than sayde Robyn;
 	 We shall do well inowe;
 	 But loke ye do no husbonde harme,
 	 That tilleth with his ploughe.
 117A.14	 No more ye shall no gode yeman
 	 That walketh by gren -wode shawe;
 	 Ne no knyght ne no squyer
 	 That wol be a gode felawe.
 117A.15	 These bisshoppes and these archebishoppes,
 	 Ye shall them bete and bynde;
 	 The hy  sherif of Notyingham,
 	 Hym holde ye in your mynde.
 117A.16	 This worde shalbe holde, sayde Lytell Johnn,
 	 And this lesson we shall lere;
 	 It is fer dayes ; God sende vs a gest,
 	 That we were at oure dynere!
 117A.17	 Take thy gode bowe in thy honde, sayde Rob[yn];
 	 Late Much wende with the;
 	 And so shal Willyam Scarlo[k],
 	 And no man abyde with me.
 117A.18	 And walke vp to the Saylis,
 	 And so to Watlingr Stret[e],
 	 And wayte after some vnkuth gest,
 	 Vp chaunce ye may them mete.
 117A.19	 Be he erle, or ani baron,
 	 Abbot, or ani knyght,
 	 Bringhe hym to lodge to me;
 	 His dyner shall be dight.
 117A.20	 They wente vp to the Saylis,
 	 These yeman all thre;
 	 They loked est, they loke[d] weest;
 	 They myght no man see.
 117A.21	 But as they loked in to Bernysdale,
 	 Bi a dern  strete,
 	 Than came a knyght ridinghe;
 	 Full sone they gan hym mete.
 117A.22	 All dreri was his semblaunce,
 	 And lytell was his pryde;
 	 His one fote in the styrop stode,
 	 That othere wauyd beside.
 117A.23	 His hode hanged in his iyn two;
 	 He rode in symple aray;
 	 A soriar man than he was one
 	 Rode neuer in somer day.
 117A.24	 Litell Johnn was full curteyes,
 	 And sette hym on his kne:
 	 Welcom be ye, gentyll knyght,
 	 Welcom ar ye to me.
 117A.25	 Welcom be thou to gren  wode,
 	 Hend  knyght and fre;
 	 My maister hath abiden you fastinge,
 	 Syr, al these our s thre.
 117A.26	 Who is thy maister? sayde the knyght;
 	 Johnn sayde, Robyn Hode;
 	 He is [a] gode yoman, sayde the knyght,
 	 Of hym haue I herde moche gode.
 117A.27	 I graunte, he sayde, with you to wende,
 	 My bretherne, all in fere;
 	 My purpos was to haue dyned to day
 	 At Blith or Dancastere.
 117A.28	 Furth than went this gentyl knight,
 	 With a carefull chere;
 	 The teris oute of his iyen ran,
 	 And fell downe by his lere.
 117A.29	 They  brought hym to the lodg -dore;
 	 Whan Robyn hym gan see,
 	 Full curtesly dyd of his hode
 	 And sette hym on his knee.
 117A.30	 Welcome, sir knight, than sayde Robyn,
 	 Welcome art thou to me;
 	 I haue abyden you fastinge, sir,
 	 All these ouris thre.
 117A.31	 Than answered the gentyll knight,
 	 With word s fayre and fre;
 	 God the saue, goode Robyn,
 	 And all thy fayre meyn .
 117A.32	 They wasshed togeder and wyped bothe,
 	 And sette to theyr dynere;
 	 Brede and wyne they had right ynoughe,
 	 And noumbles of the dere.
 117A.33	 Swannes and fessauntes they had full gode,
 	 And foules of the ryuere;
 	 There fayled none so litell a birde
 	 That euer was bred on bryre.
 117A.34	 Do gladly, sir knight, sayde Robyn;
 	 Gramarcy, sir, sayde he;
 	 Suche a dinere had I nat
 	 Of all these wekys thre.
 117A.35	 If I come ageyne, Robyn,
 	 Here by thys contr ,
 	 As gode a dyner I shall the make
 	 As that thou haest made to me.
 117A.36	 Gramarcy, knyght, sayde Robyn;
 	 My dyner whan that I it haue,
 	 I was neuer so gredy, bi dere worthy God,
 	 My dyner for to craue.
 117A.37	 But pay or ye wende, sayde Robyn;
 	 Me thynketh it is gode ryght;
 	 It was neuer the maner, by dere worthi God,
 	 A yoman to pay for a knyhht.
 117A.38	 I haue nought in my coffers, saide the knyght,
 	 That I may profer for shame:
 	 Litell Johnn, go loke, sayde Robyn,
 	 Ne let nat for no blame.
 117A.39	 Tel me truth, than saide Robyn,
 	 So God haue parte of the:
 	 I haue no more but ten shelynges, sayde the knyght,
 	 So God haue parte of me.
 117A.40	 If thou hast no more, sayde Robyn,
 	 I woll nat one peny;
 	 And yf thou haue nede of any more,
 	 More shall I lend the.
 117A.41	 Go nowe furth, Littell Johnn,
 	 The truth tell thou me;
 	 If there be no more but ten shelinges,
 	 No peny that I se.
 117A.42	 Lyttell Johnn sprede downe hys mantell
 	 Full fayre vpon the grounde,
 	 And there he fonde in the knyght s cofer
 	 But euen halfe [a] pounde.
 117A.43	 Littell Johnn let it lye full styll,
 	 And went to hys maysteer [full] lowe;
 	 What tidyng s, Johnn? sayde Robyn;
 	 Sir, the knyght is true inowe.
 117A.44	 Fyll of the best wine, sayde Robyn,
 	 The knyght shall begynne;
 	 Moche wonder thinketh me
 	 Thy clot[h]ynge is so thin[n]e.
 117A.45	 Tell me [one] worde, sayde Robyn,
 	 And counsel shal it be;
 	 I trowe thou warte made a knyght of force,
 	 Or ellys of yemanry.
 117A.46	 Or ellys thou hast bene a sori husbande,
 	 And lyued in stroke and stryfe;
 	 An okerer, or ellis a lechoure, sayde Robyn,
 	 Wyth wronge hast led thy lyfe.
 117A.47	 I am none of those, sayde the knyght,
 	 By God that mad  me;
 	 An hundred wynter here before
 	 Myn auncetres knyghtes haue be.
 117A.48	 But oft it hath befal, Robyn,
 	 A man hath be disgrate;
 	 But God that sitteth in heuen aboue
 	 May amende his state.
 117A.49	 Withyn this two yere, Robyne, he sayde,
 	 My neghbours well it knowe,
 	 Foure hundred pounde of gode money
 	 Ful well than myght I spende.
 117A.50	 Nowe haue I no gode, saide the knyght,
 	 God hath shaped such an ende,
 	 But my chyldren and my wyfe,
 	 Tyll God yt may amende.
 117A.51	 In what maner, than sayde Robyn,
 	 Hast thou lorne thy rychesse?
 	 For my great  foly, he sayde,
 	 And for my kynd[ ]nesse.
 117A.52	 I hade a sone, forsoth, Robyn,
 	 That shulde hau[e] ben myn ayre,
 	 Whanne he was twenty wynter olde,
 	 In felde wolde iust full fayre.
 117A.53	 He slewe a knyght of Lancaster,
 	 And a squyer bolde;
 	 For to saue hym in his ryght
 	 My godes both sette and solde.
 117A.54	 My londes both sette to wedde, Robyn,
 	 Vntyll a certayn day,
 	 To a ryche abbot here besyde
 	 Of Seynt Mari Abbey.
 117A.55	 What is the som? sayde Robyn;
 	 Trouth than tell thou me;
 	 Sir, he sayde, Foure hundred pounde;
 	 The abbot told it to me.
 117A.56	 Nowe and thou lese thy lond, sayde Robyn,
 	 What woll fall of the?
 	 Hastely I wol me buske, sayd the knyght,
 	 Ouer the salt  see,
 117A.57	 And se w[h]ere Criste was quyke and dede,
 	 On the mount of Caluer ;
 	 Fare wel, frende, and haue gode day;
 	 It may no better be.
 117A.58	 Teris fell out of hys iyen two;
 	 He wolde haue gone hys way:
 	 Farewel, frende, and haue gode day;
 	 I ne haue no more to pay.
 117A.59	 Where be thy frend s? sayde Robyn:
 	 Syr, neuer one wol me knowe;
 	 While I was ryche ynowe at home
 	 Great boste than wolde they blowe.
 117A.60	 And nowe they renne away fro me,
 	 As bestis on a rowe;
 	 They take no more hede of me
 	 Thanne they had me neuer sawe.
 117A.61	 For ruthe thanne wept Litell Johnn,
 	 Scarlok and Muche in fere;
 	 Fyl of the best wyne, sayde Robyn,
 	 For here is a symple chere.
 117A.62	 Hast thou any frende, sayde Robyn,
 	 Thy borowe that wold  be?
 	 I haue none, than sayde the knyght,
 	 But God that dyed on tree.
 117A.63	 Do away thy iapis, than sayde Robyn,
 	 Thereof wol I right none;
 	 Wenest thou I wolde haue God to borowe,
 	 Peter, Poule, or Johnn?
 117A.64	 Nay, by hym that me made,
 	 And shope both sonne and mone,
 	 Fynde me a better borowe, sayde Robyn,
 	 Or money getest thou none.
 117A.65	 I haue none other, sayde the knyght,
 	 The sothe for to say,
 	 But yf yt be Our der  Lady;
 	 She fayled me neuer or thys day.
 117A.66	 By dere worthy God, sayde Robyn,
 	 To seche all Englonde thorowe,
 	 Yet fonde I neuer to my pay
 	 A moche better borowe.
 117A.67	 Come nowe furth, Litell Johnn,
 	 And go to my tresour ,
 	 And bringe me foure hundered pound,
 	 And loke well tolde it be.
 117A.68	 Furth than went Litell Johnn,
 	 And Scarlok went before;
 	 He tolde oute foure hundred pounde
 	 By eight and twenty score.
 117A.69	 Is thys well tolde? sayde [litell] Much;
 	 Johnn sayde, What gre[ue]th the?
 	 It is almus to helpe a gentyll knyght,
 	 That is fal in pouert .
 117A.70	 Master, than sayde Lityll John,
 	 His clothinge is full thynne;
 	 Ye must gyue the knight a lyueray,
 	 To lappe his body therin.
 117A.71	 For ye haue scarlet and grene, mayster,
 	 And man[y] a riche aray;
 	 Ther is no marchaunt in mery Englond
 	 So ryche, I dare well say.
 117A.72	 Take hym thre yerdes of euery colour,
 	 And loke well mete that it be;
 	 Lytell Johnn toke none other mesure
 	 But his bow -tree.
 117A.73	 And at euery handfull that he met
 	 He lep d foot s three;
 	 What deuyll s drapar, sayid litell Muche,
 	 Thynkest thou for to be?
 117A.74	 Scarlok stode full stil and loughe,
 	 And sayd, By God Almyght,
 	 Johnn may gyue hym gode mesure,
 	 For it costeth hym but lyght.
 117A.75	 Mayster, than said Litell Johnn
 	 To gentill Robyn Hode,
 	 Ye must giue the knig[h]t a hors,
 	 To lede home this gode.
 117A.76	 Take hym a gray coursar, sayde Robyn,
 	 And a saydle newe;
 	 He is Oure Ladyes messangere;
 	 God graunt that he be true.
 117A.77	 And a gode palfray, sayde lytell Much,
 	 To mayntene hym in his right;
 	 And a peyre of bot s, sayde Scarlock,
 	 For he is a gentyll knight.
 117A.78	 What shalt thou gyue hym, Litell John? said Robyn;
 	 Sir, a peyre of gilt sporis clene,
 	 To pray for all this company;
 	 God bringe hym out of tene.
 117A.79	 Whan shal mi day be, said the knight,
 	 Sir, and your wyll be?
 	 This day twelue moneth, saide Robyn,
 	 Vnder this gren -wode tre.
 117A.80	 It were greate sham , sayde Robyn,
 	 A knight alone to ryde,
 	 Without  squyre, yoman, or page,
 	 To walk  by his syde.
 117A.81	 I shall the lende Litell John, my man,
 	 For he shalbe thy knaue;
 	 In a yema[n]s stede he may the stande,
 	 If thou greate ned  haue.
 117A.82	 Now is the knight gone on his way;
 	 This game hym thought full gode;
 	 Whanne he loked on Bernesdale
 	 He blessyd Robyn Hode.
 117A.83	 And whanne he thought on Bernysdale,
 	 On Scarlok, Much, and Johnn,
 	 He blyssyd them for the best company
 	 That euer he in come.
 117A.84	 Then spake that gentyll knyght,
 	 To Lytel Johan gan he saye,
 	 To-morrowe I must to Yorke toune,
 	 To Saynt Mary abbay.
 117A.85	 And to the abbot of that place
 	 Foure hondred pounde I must pay;
 	 And but I be there vpon this nyght
 	 My londe is lost for ay.
 117A.86	 The abbot sayd to his couent,
 	 There he stode on grounde,
 	 This day twelfe moneth came there a knyght
 	 And borowed foure hondred pounde.
 117A.87	 [He borowed foure hondred pounde,]
 	 Upon all his lond  fre;
 	 But he come this ylk  day
 	 Dysheryte shall he be.
 117A.88	 It is full erely, sayd the pryoure,
 	 The day is not yet ferre gone;
 	 I had leuer to pay an hondred pounde,
 	 And lay downe anone.
 117A.89	 The knyght is ferre beyonde the see,
 	 In Englonde is his ryght,
 	 And suffreth honger and colde,
 	 And many a sory nyght.
 117A.90	 It were grete pyt , said the pryoure,
 	 So to haue his londe;
 	 And ye be so lyght of your consyence,
 	 Ye do to hym moch wronge.
 117A.91	 Thou arte euer in my berde, sayd the abbot,
 	 By God and Saynt Rycharde;
 	 With that cam in a fat-heded monke,
 	 The heygh selerer.
 117A.92	 He is dede or hanged, sayd the monke,
 	 By God that bought me dere,
 	 And we shall haue to spende in this place
 	 Foure hondred pounde by yere.
 117A.93	 The abbot and the hy selerer
 	 Stert  forthe full bolde,
 	 The [hye] iustyce of Englonde
 	 The abbot there dyde holde.
 117A.94	 The hy  iustyce and many mo
 	 Had take in to they[r] honde
 	 Holy all the knyght s det,
 	 To put that knyght to wronge.
 117A.95	 They demed the knyght wonder sore,
 	 The abbot and his meyn :
 	 But he come this ylk  day
 	 Dysheryte shall he be.
 117A.96	 He wyll not come yet, sayd the iustyce,
 	 Idare well vndertake;
 	 But in sorowe tym  for them all
 	 The knyght came to the gate.
 117A.97	 Than bespake that gentyll knyght
 	 Untyll his meyn :
 	 Now put on your symple wedes
 	 That ye brought fro the see.
 117A.98	 [They put on their symple wedes,]
 	 They came to the gates anone;
 	 The porter was redy hymselfe,
 	 And welcomed them euerychone.
 117A.99	 Welcome, syr knyght, sayd the porter;
 	 My lorde to mete is he,
 	 And so is many a gentyll man,
 	 For the loue of the.
 117A.100	The porter swore a full grete othe,
 RRBrry	 God that mad  me,
 	 Here be the best coresed hors
 	 That euer yet sawe I me.
 117A.101	Lede them in to the stable, he sayd,
 	 That eased myght they be;
 	 They shall not come therin, sayd the knyght,
 	 By God that dyed on a tre.
 117A.102	Lord s were to mete isette
 	 In that abbotes hall;
 	 The knyght went forth and kneled downe,
 	 And salued them grete and small.
 117A.103	Do gladly, syr abbot, sayd the knyght,
 	 I am come to holde my day:
 	 The fyrst word the abbot spake,
 	 Hast thou brought my pay?
 117A.104	Not one peny, sayd the knyght,
 	 By God that maked me;
 	 Thou art a shrewed dettour, sayd the abbot;
 	 Syr iustyce, drynke to me.
 117A.105	What doost thou here, sayd the abbot,
 	 But thou haddest brought thy pay?
 	 For God, than sayd the knyght,
 	 To pray of a lenger daye.
 117A.106	Thy daye is broke, sayd the iustyce,
 	 Londe getest thou none:
 	 Now, good syr iustyce, be my frende,
 	 And fende me of my fone!
 117A.107	I am holde with the abbot, sayd the iustyce,
 	 Both with cloth and fee :
 	 Now, good syr sheryf, be my frende!
 	 Nay, for God, sayd he.
 117A.108	Now, good syr abbot, be my frende,
 	 For thy curteys ,
 	 And holde my lond s in thy honde
 	 Tyll I haue made the gree!
 117A.109	And I wyll be thy true seruaunte,
 	 And trewely seru  the,
 	 Tyl ye haue foure hondred pounde
 	 Of money good and free.
 117A.110	The abbot sware a full grete othe,
 	 By God that dyed on a tree,
 	 Get the londe where thou may,
 	 For thou getest none of me.
 117A.111	By dere worthy God, then sayd the knyght,
 	 That all this world  wrought,
 	 But I haue my londe agayne,
 	 Full dere it shall be bought.
 117A.112	God, that was of a mayden borne,
 	 Leue vs well to spede!
 	 For it is good to assay a frende
 	 Or that a man haue nede.
 117A.113	The abbot lothely on hym gan loke,
 	 And vylaynesly hym gan call;
 	 Out, he sayd, Thou fals  knyght,
 	 Spede the out of my hall!
 117A.114	Thou lyest, then sayd the gentyll knyght,
 	 Abbot, in thy hal;
 	 False knyght was I neuer,
 	 By God that made vs all.
 117A.115	Vp then stode that gentyll knyght,
 	 To the abbot sayd he,
 	 To suffre a knyght to knele so longe,
 	 Thou canst no curteysye.
 117A.116	In ioust s and in tournement
 	 Full ferre than haue I be,
 	 And put my selfe as ferre in prees
 	 As ony that euer I se.
 117A.117	What wyll ye gyue more, sayd the iustice,
 	 And the knyght shall make a releyse?
 	 And elles dare I safly swere
 	 Ye holde neuer your londe in pees.
 117A.118	An hondred pounde, sayd the abbot;
 	 The justice sayd, Gyue hym two;
 	 Nay, be God, sayd the knyght,
 	 Yit gete ye it not so.
 117A.119	Though ye wolde gyue a thousand more,
 	 Yet were ye neuer the nere;
 	 Shall there neuer be myn heyre
 	 Abbot, iustice, ne frere.
 117A.120	He stert hym to a borde anone,
 	 Tyll a table rounde,
 	 And there he shoke oute of a bagge
 	 Euen four hundred pound.
 117A.121	Haue here thi golde, sir abbot, saide the knight,
 	 Which that thou lentest me;
 	 Had thou ben curtes at my comynge,
 	 Rewarded shuldest thou haue be.
 117A.122	The abbot sat styll, and ete no more,
 	 For all his ryall fare;
 	 He cast his hede on his shulder,
 	 And fast began to stare.
 117A.123	Take me my golde agayne, saide the abbot,
 	 Sir iustice, that I toke the:
 	 Not a peni, said the iustice,
 	 Bi Go[d, that dy]ed on tree.
 117A.124	Sir [abbot, and ye me]n of lawe,
 	 Now haue I holde my daye;
 	 Now shall I haue my londe agayne,
 	 For ought that you can saye.
 117A.125	The knyght stert out of the dore,

 117A.262	He dyde him streyt to Bernysdale,

 117A.281	Now hath the knyght his leue i-take,

 	 Robyn Hode and his mery men
 	 Dwelled styll full many a day.
 117A.282	Lyth and lysten, gentil men,
 	 And herken what I shall say,
 	 How the proud[ ] sheryfe of Notyngham
 	 Dyde crye a full fayre play;
 117A.283	That all the best archers of the north
 	 Sholde come vpon a day,
 	 And [he] that shoteth allther best
 	 The game shall bere a way.
 117A.284	He that shoteth allther best,
 	 Furthest fayre and lowe,
 	 At a payre of fynly buttes,
 	 Under the gren -wode shawe,
 117A.285	A ryght good arowe he shall haue,
 	 The shaft of syluer whyte,
 	 The hede and the feders of ryche red golde,
 	 In Englond is none lyke.
 117A.286	This than herde good Robyn,
 	 Under his trystell-tre:
 	 Make you redy, ye wyght yonge men;
 	 That shotynge wyll I se.
 117A.287	Buske you, my mery yonge men,

 117A.288	Whan they had theyr bowes i-bent,
 	 Theyr takles fedred fre,
 	 Seuen score of wyght yonge men
 	 Stode by Robyns kne.
 117A.289	Whan they cam to Notyngham,
 	 The buttes were fayre and longe;
 	 Many was the bolde archere
 	 That shoted with bow s stronge.
 117A.290	There shall but syx shote with me;
 	 The other shal kepe my he[ue]de,
 	 And stand  with good bow s bent,
 	 That I be not desceyued.
 117A.291	The fourth outlawe his bowe gan bende,
 	 And that was Robyn Hode,
 	 And that behelde the proud[ ] sheryfe,
 	 All by the but [as] he stode.
 117A.292	Thry s Robyn shot about,
 	 And alway he slist the wand,
 	 And so dyde good Gylberte

 117A.293	Lytell Johan and good Scatheloke
 	 Were archers good and fre;
 	 Lytell Much and good Reynolde,
 	 The worste wolde they not be.
 117A.294	Whan they had shot aboute,

 	 Euermore was the best,
 	 For soth, Robyn Hode.
 117A.295	Hym was delyuered the good arowe,
 	 For best worthy was he;
 	 He toke the yeft so curteysly,
 	 To gren  wode wolde he.
 117A.296	They cryed out on Robyn Hode,
 	 And grete horn s gan they blowe:
 	 Wo worth the, treason! sayd Robyn,
 	 Full euyl thou art to knowe.
 117A.297	And wo be thou! thou proud  sheryf,
 	 Thus gladdynge thy gest;
 	 Other wyse thou behot  me
 	 In yonder wylde forest.
 117A.298	But had I the in gren  wode,
 	 Under my trystell-tre,
 	 Thou sholdest leue me a better wedde
 	 Than thy trewe lewt .
 117A.299	Full many a bow  there was bent,
 	 And arow s let they glyde;
 	 Many a kyrtell there was rent,
 	 And hurt many a syde.
 117A.300	The outlawes shot was so stronge
 	 That no man myght them dryue,
 	 And the proud[ ] sheryf s men,
 	 They fled away full blyue.
 117A.301	Robyn sawe the busshement to-broke,
 	 In gren  wode he wolde haue be;
 	 Many an arowe there was shot
 	 Amonge that company.
 117A.302	Lytell Johan was hurte full sore,
 	 With an arowe in his kne,
 	 That he myght neyther go nor ryde;
 	 It was full grete pyt .
 117A.303	Mayster, then sayd Lytell Johan,
 	 If euer thou loue[d]st me,

 117A.305	But take out thy brown  swerde,
 	 And smyte all of my hede,
 	 And gyue me wound s depe and wyde;
 	 No lyfe on me be lefte.
 117A.306	I wolde not that, sayd Robyn,
 	 Johan, that thou were slawe,
 	 For all the golde in mery Englonde,
 	 Though it lay now on a rawe.
 117A.307	God forbede, sayd Lytell Much,
 	 That dyed on a tre,
 	 That thou sholdest, Lytell Johan,
 	 Parte our company.
 117A.308	Up he toke hym on his backe,
 	 And bare hym well a myle;
 	 Many a tyme he layd hym downe,
 	 And shot another whyle.
 117A.309	n was there a fayre castell,
 	 A lytell within the wode;
 	 Double-dyched it was about,
 	 And walled, by the rode.
 117A.310	And there dwelled that gentyll knyght,
 	 Syr Rychard at the Lee,
 	 That Robyn had lent his good,
 	 Under the gren -wode tree.
 117A.311	In he toke good Robyn,

 117A.314	Shyt the gates, and drawe the brydge,
 	 And let no man come in,
 	 And arme you well, and make you redy,
 	 And to the walles ye wynne.
 117A.315	For one thynge, Robyn, I the behote;
 	 Iswere by Saynt Quyntyne,

 117A.321	Wende furth, sirs, on your way,

 	 And Robyn Hode, and yf he may.
 117A.355	He asked men of that countr 
 	 After Robyn Hode,
 	 And after that gentyll knyght,
 	 That was so bolde and stout.
 117A.356	Whan they had tolde hym the case
 	 Our kynge vnderstode ther tale,

 117A.362	Than bespake a fayre olde knyght,

 117A.363	There is no man in this countr

 	 And bere a bowe in his hondes,
 117A.364	That he ne shall lese his hede,
 	 That is the best ball in his hode:
 	 Giue it no man, my lorde the kynge,

 117A.365	Half a yere dwelled our comly kynge

 117A.366	But alway went good Robyn

 117A.371	Full hast[ ]ly our kynge was dyght,

 	 Ryght as he were abbot-lyke,
 	 They rode up in-to the towne.
 117A.373	Styf bot s our kynge had on,
 	 Forsoth as I you say;
 	 He rode syngynge to gren  wode,

 117A.374	His male-hors and his gret  somers

 117A.381	And I haue but forty pounde,
 	 No more than haue I me;

 117A.382	Robyn toke the forty pounde,
 	 And departed it in two partye;
 	 Halfendell he gaue his mery men,

 117A.383	Full curteysly Robyn gan say;

 117A.386	I loue no man in all the worlde
 	 So well as I do my kynge;
 	 Welcome is my lord s seale;
 	 And, monke, for thy tydynge,
 117A.387	Syr abbot, for thy tydynges,
 	 To day thou shalt dyne with me,
 	 For the loue of my kynge,
 	 Under my trystell-tre.
 117A.388	Forth he lad our comly kynge,
 	 Full fayre by the honde;
 	 Many a dere there was slayne,
 	 And full fast dyghtande.
 117A.389	Robyn toke a full grete horne,
 	 And loude he gan blowe;
 	 Seuen score of wyght yonge men
 	 Came redy on a rowe.
 117A.390	All they kneled on theyr kne,
 	 Full fayre before Robyn:
 	 The kynge sayd hym selfe vntyll,
 	 And swore by Saynt Austyn,
 117A.391	Here is a wonder semely syght;
 	 Me thynketh, by Godd s pyne,
 	 His men are more at his byddynge
 	 Then my men be at myn.
 117A.392	Full hast[ ]ly was theyr dyner idyght,
 	 And therto gan they gone;
 	 They serued our kynge with al theyr myght,
 	 Both Robyn and Lytell Johan.
 117A.393	Anone before our kynge was set
 	 The fatt  venyson,
 	 The good whyte brede, the good rede wyne,
 	 And therto the fyne ale and browne.
 117A.394	Make good chere, said Robyn,
 	 Abbot, for charyt ;
 	 And for this ylk  tydynge,
 	 Blyssed mote thou be.
 117A.395	Now shalte thou se what lyfe we lede,
 	 Or thou hens wende;
 	 Than thou may enfourme our kynge,
 	 Whan ye togyder lende.
 117A.396	Up they stert  all in hast,
 	 Theyr bow s were smartly bent;
 	 Our kynge was neuer so sore agast,
 	 He wende to haue be shente.
 117A.397	Two yerd s there were vp set,
 	 Thereto gan they gange;
 	 By fyfty pase, our kynge sayd,
 	 The merk s were to longe.
 117A.398	On euery syde a rose-garlonde,
 	 They shot vnder the lyne:
 	 Who so fayleth of the rose-garlonde, sayd Robyn,
 	 His takyll he shall tyne,
 117A.399	And yelde it to his mayster,
 	 Be it neuer so fyne;
 	 For no man wyll I spare,
 	 So drynke I ale or wyne:
 117A.400	And bere a buffet on his hede,
 	 I-wys ryght all bare:
 	 And all that fell in Robyns lote,
 	 He smote them wonder sare.
 117A.401	Twyse Robyn shot aboute,
 	 And euer he cleued the wande,
 	 And so dyde good Gylberte
 	 With the Whyt  Hande.
 117A.402	Lytell Johan and good Scathelocke,
 	 For nothynge wolde they spare;
 	 When they fayled of the garlonde,
 	 Robyn smote them full sore.
 117A.403	At the last shot that Robyn shot,
 	 For all his frend s fare,
 	 Yet he fayled of the garlonde
 	 Thre fyngers and mare.
 117A.404	Than bespake good Gylberte,
 	 And thus he gan say;
 	 Mayster, he sayd, your takyll is lost,
 	 Stande forth and take your pay.
 117A.405	If it be so, sayd Robyn,
 	 That may no better be,
 	 Syr abbot, I delyuer the myn arowe,
 	 I pray the, syr, serue thou me.
 117A.406	It falleth not for myn ordre, sayd our kynge,
 	 Robyn, by thy leue,
 	 For to smyte no good yeman,
 	 For doute I sholde hym greue.
 117A.407	Smyte on boldely, sayd Robyn,
 	 I giue the larg  leue:
 	 Anone our kynge, with that worde,
 	 He folde vp his sleue,
 117A.408	And sych a buffet he gaue Robyn,
 	 To grounde he yede full nere:
 	 I make myn avowe to God, sayd Robyn,
 	 Thou arte a stalworthe frere.
 117A.409	There is pith in thyn arme, sayd Robyn,
 	 I trowe thou canst well shete:
 	 Thus our kynge and Robyn Hode
 	 Togeder gan they mete.
 117A.410	Robyn beheld our comly kynge
 	 Wystly in the face,
 	 So dyde Syr Rycharde at the Le,
 	 And kneled downe in that place.
 117A.411	And so dyde all the wylde outlawes,
 	 Whan they se them knele:
 	 My lorde the kynge of Englonde,
 	 Now I knowe you well.
 117A.412	Mercy then, Robyn, sayd our kynge,
 	 Vnder your trystyll-tre,
 	 Of thy goodnesse and thy grace,
 	 For my men and me!
 117A.413	Yes, for God, sayd Robyn,
 	 And also God me saue,
 	 I ask  mersy, my lorde the kynge,
 	 And for my men I craue.
 117A.414	Yes, for God, than sayd our kynge,
 	 And therto sent I me,
 	 With that thou leue the gren  wode,
 	 And all thy company;
 117A.415	And come home, syr, to my courte,
 	 And there dwell with me.
 	 I make myn avowe to God, sayd Robyn,
 	 And ryght so shall it be.
 117A.416	I wyll come to your courte,
 	 Your seruyse for to se,
 	 And brynge with me of my men
 	 Seuen score and thre.
 117A.417	But me lyk  well your seruyse,
 	 I [wyll] come agayne full soone,
 	 And shote at the donn  dere,
 	 As I am wonte to done.
 117A.418	Haste thou ony gren  cloth, sayd our kynge,
 	 That thou wylte sell nowe to me?
 	 Ye, for God, sayd Robyn,
 	 Thyrty yerd s and thre.
 117A.419	Robyn, sayd our kynge,
 	 Now pray I the,
 	 Sell me some of that cloth,
 	 To me and my meyn .
 117A.420	Yes, for God, then sayd Robyn,
 	 Or elles I were a fole;
 	 Another day ye wyll me clothe,
 	 I trowe, ayenst the Yole.
 117A.421	The kynge kest of his col  then,
 	 A grene garment he dyde on,
 	 And euery knyght also, i-wys,
 	 Another had full sone.
 117A.422	Whan they were clothed in Lyncolne grene,
 	 They keste away theyr graye;
 	 Now we shall to Notyngham,
 	 All thus our kynge gan say.
 117A.423	They bente theyr bowes, and forth they went,
 	 Shotynge all in-fere,
 	 Towarde the towne of Notyngham,
 	 Outlawes as they were.
 117A.424	Our kynge and Robyn rode togyder,
 	 For soth as I you say,
 	 And they shote plucke-buffet,
 	 As they went by the way.
 117A.425	And many a buffet our kynge wan
 	 Of Robyn Hode that day,
 	 And nothynge spared good Robyn
 	 Our kynge in his pay.
 117A.426	So God me help , sayd our kynge,
 	 Thy game is nought to lere;
 	 I sholde not get a shote of the,
 	 Though I shote all this yere.
 117A.427	All the people of Notyngham
 	 They stode and behelde;
 	 They sawe nothynge but mantels of grene
 	 That couered all the felde.
 117A.428	Than euery man to other gan say,
 	 I drede our kynge be slone;
 	 Com  Robyn Hode to the towne, i-wys
 	 On lyue he lefte neuer one.
 117A.429	Full hast[ ]ly they began to fle,
 	 Both yemen and knaues,
 	 And olde wyues that myght euyll goo,
 	 They hypped on theyr staues.
 117A.430	The kynge l[o]ughe full fast,
 	 And commaunded them agayne;
 	 When they se our comly kynge,
 	 I-wys they were full fayne.
 117A.431	They ete and dranke, and made them glad,
 	 And sange with not s hye;
 	 Than bespake our comly kynge
 	 To Syr Rycharde at the Lee.
 117A.432	He gaue hym there his londe agayne,
 	 A good man he bad hym be;
 	 Robyn thanked our comly kynge,
 	 And set hym on his kne.
 117A.433	Had robyn dwelled in the kyng s courte
 	 But twelue monethes and thre,
 	 That [he had] spent an hondred pounde,
 	 And all his mennes fe.
 117A.434	In euery place where Robyn came
 	 Euer more he layde downe,
 	 Both for knyght s and for squyres,
 	 To gete hym grete renowne.
 117A.435	By than the yere was all agone
 	 He had no man but twayne,
 	 Lytell Johan and good Scathlocke,
 	 With hym all for to gone.
 117A.436	Robyn sawe yonge men shote
 	 Full fayre vpon a day;
 	 Alas! than sayd good Robyn,
 	 My welthe is went away.
 117A.437	Somtyme I was an archere good,
 	 A styffe and eke a stronge;
 	 I was compted the best archere
 	 That was in mery Englonde.
 117A.438	Alas! then sayd good Robyn,
 	 Alas and well a woo!
 	 Yf I dwele lenger with the kynge,
 	 Sorowe wyll me sloo.
 117A.439	Forth than went Robyn Hode
 	 Tyll he came to our kynge:
 	 My lorde the kynge of Englonde,
 	 Graunte me myn askynge.
 117A.440	I made a chapell in Bernysdale,
 	 That semely is to se,
 	 It is of Mary Magdaleyne,
 	 And thereto wolde I be.
 117A.441	I myght neuer in this seuen nyght
 	 No tyme to slepe ne wynke,
 	 Nother all these seuen dayes
 	 Nother ete ne drynke.
 117A.442	Me longeth sore to Bernysdale,
 	 I may not be therfro;
 	 Barefote and wolwarde I haue hyght
 	 Thyder for to go.
 117A.443	Yf it be so, than sayd our kynge,
 	 It may no better be,
 	 Seuen nyght I gyue the leue,
 	 No lengre, to dwell fro me.
 117A.444	Gramercy, lorde, then sayd Robyn,
 	 And set hym on his kne;
 	 He toke his leu  full courteysly.
 	 To gren  wode then went he.
 117A.445	Whan he came to gren  wode,
 	 In a mery mornynge,
 	 There he herde the not s small
 	 Of byrd s mery syngynge.
 117A.446	It is ferre gone, sayd Robyn,
 	 That I was last here;
 	 Me lyste a lytell for to shote
 	 At the donn  dere.
 117A.447	Robyn slewe a full grete harte;
 	 His horne than gan he blow,
 	 That all the outlawes of that forest
 	 That horne coud they knowe,
 117A.448	And gadred them togyder,
 	 In a lytell throwe.
 	 Seuen score of wyght yonge men
 	 Came redy on a rowe,
 117A.449	And fayre dyde of theyr hodes,
 	 And set them on theyr kne:
 	 Welcome, they sayd, our [der ] mayster,
 	 Under this gren -wode tre.
 117A.450	Robyn dwelled in gren  wode
 	 Twenty yere and two;
 	 For all drede of Edwarde our kynge,
 	 Agayne wolde he not goo.
 117A.451	Yet he was begyled, i-wys,
 	 Through a wycked woman,
 	 The pryoresse of Kyrk sly,
 	 That nye was of hys kynne:
 117A.452	For the loue of a knyght,

 117A.453	They toke togyder theyr counsell
 	 Robyn Hode for to sle,
 	 And how they myght best do that dede,
 	 His banis for to be.
 117A.454	Than bespake good Robyn,
 	 In place where as he stode,
 	 To morow I muste to Kyrke[s]ly,
 	 Craftely to be leten blode.
 117A.455	Syr Roger of Donkestere,
 	 By the pryoresse he lay,
 	 And there they betrayed good Robyn Hode,
 	 Through theyr fals  playe.
 117A.456	Cryst haue mercy on his soule,
 	 That dyed on the rode!
 	 For he was a good outlawe,
 	 And dyde pore men moch god.
