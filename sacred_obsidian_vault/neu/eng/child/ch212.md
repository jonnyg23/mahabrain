 	 WHERE shall I gang, my ain true love?
 	 Where shall I gang to hide me?
 	 For weel ye ken i yere fathers bowr
 	 It wad be death to find me.
 212A.2	 O go you to yon tavern-house,
 	 An there count owre your lawin,
 	 An, if I be a woman true,
 	 Ill meet you in the dawin.
 212A.3	 O hes gone to yon tavern-house,
 	 An ay he counted his lawin,
 	 An ay he drank to her guid health
 	 Was to meet him in the dawin.
 212A.4	 O hes gone to yon tavern-house,
 	 An counted owre his lawin,
 	 When in there cam three armed men,
 	 To meet him in the dawin.
 212A.5	 O woe be unto womans wit!
 	 It has beguiled many;
 	 She promised to come hersel,
 	 But she sent three men to slay me.

 <h3 align="CENTER">212B: The Duke of Atholes Nurse</h3>
 <pre>
 
 212B.1	 YE are the Duke of Athols nurse,
 	 And Im the new-come darling;
 	 Ill gie you my gay gold rings
 	 To get ae word of my leman.
 212B.2	 I am the Duke Athols nurse,
 	 And yere the new-come darling;
 	 Keep well your gay gold rings,
 	 Ye sall get twa words o your leman.
 212B.3	 He leand oure his saddle-bow,
 	 It was not for to kiss her:
 	 Anither woman has my heart,
 	 And I but come here to see ye.
 212B.4	 If anither woman has your heart,
 	 O dear, but I am sorry!
 	 Ye hie you down to yon ale house,
 	 And stay untill t be dawing,
 	 And if I be a woman true
 	 Ill meet you in the dawing.
 212B.5	 He did him down to yon ale-house,
 	 And drank untill t was dawing;
 	 He drank the bonnie lassies health
 	 That was to clear his lawing.
 212B.6	 He lookit out of a shot-window,
 	 To see if she was coming,
 	 And there he seed her seven brithers,
 	 So fast as they were running!
 212B.7	 He went up and down the house,
 	 Says, Landlady, can you save me?
 	 For yonder comes her seven brithers,
 	 And they are coming to slay me.
 212B.8	 So quick she minded her on a wile
 	 How she might protect him!
 	 She dressd him in a suit of womans attire
 	 And set him to her baking.
 212B.9	 Had you a quarterer here last night,
 	 Or staid he to the dawing?
 	 Shew us the room the squire lay in,
 	 We are come to clear his lawing.
 212B.10	 I had a quarterer here last night,
 	 But he staid not to the dawing;
 	 He called for a pint, and paid as he went,
 	 You have nothing to do with his lawing.
 212B.11	 They searchd the house baith up and down,
 	 The curtains they spaird not to rive em,
 	 And twenty times they passd
 	 The squire at his baking.

 <h3 align="CENTER">212C: The Duke of Atholes Nurse</h3>
 <pre>
 
 212C.1	 AS I went down by the Duke of Atholes gates,
 	 Where the bells of the court were ringing,
 	 And there I heard a fair maid say,
 	 O if I had but ae sight o my Johnie!
 212C.2	 O here is your Johnie just by your side;
 	 What have ye to say to your Johnie?
 	 O here is my hand, but anither has my heart,
 	 So yell never get more o your Johnie.
 212C.3	 O ye may go down to yon ale-house,
 	 And there do sit till the dawing;
 	 And call for the wine that is very, very fine,
 	 And Ill come and clear up your lawing.
 212C.4	 So hes gane down to yon ale-house,
 	 And he has sat till the dawing;
 	 And hes calld for the wine thats very, very fine,
 	 But she neer cam to clear up his lawing.
 212C.5	 Lang or the dawing he oure the window looks,
 	 To see if his true-love was coming,
 	 And there he spied twelve weel armd boys,
 	 Coming over the plainstanes running.
 212C.6	 O landlady, landlady, what shall I do?
 	 For my life its not worth a farthing!
 	 O young man, said she, Tak counsel by me,
 	 And I will be your undertaking.
 212C.7	 I will clothe you in my own body-clothes
 	 And Ill send you like a girl to the baking:
 	 And loudly, loudly they rapped at the door,
 	 And loudly, loudly they rapp d.
 212C.8	 O had you any strangers here late last night?
 	 Or were they lang gane or the dawing?
 	 O had you any strangers here late last night?
 	 We are now come to clear up his lawing.
 212C.9	 O I had a stranger here late last night,
 	 But he was lang gane or the dawing;
 	 He called for a pint, and he paid it as he went,
 	 And yeve no more to do with his lawing.
 212C.10	 O show me the room that your stranger lay in,
 	 If he was lang gane or the dawing:
 	 She showed them the room that her stranger lay in,
 	 But he was lang gane or the dawing.
 212C.11	 O they stabbed the feather-bed all round and round,
 	 And the curtains they neer stood to tear them;
 	 And they gade as they cam, and left a things undone,
 	 And left the young squire by his baking.

 <pre>
 
 212D.1	 AS I cam in by the Duke of Atholes gate,
 	 I heard a fair maid singing,
 	 Wi a bonny baby on her knee,
 	 And the bells o the court were ringing.
 212D.2	 O its I am the Duke of Atholes nurse,
 	 And the place does well become me;
 	 But I would gie a my half-years fee
 	 Just for a sight o my Johnie.
 	 * * * * *
 212D.3	 If yell gae down to yon ale-house,
 	 And stop till it be dawing,
 	 And ca for a pint o the very, very best,
 	 And Ill come and clear up your lawing.
 212D.4	 O hes gane down to yon ale-house,
 	 And stopt till it was dawing;
 	 He cad for a pint o the very, very best,
 	 But she cam na to clear up his lawing.
 212D.5	 He looked out at the chamber-window,
 	 To see if she was coming;
 	 And there he spied ten armed men,
 	 Across the plain coming running.
 212D.6	 O landlady, landlady, what shall I do?
 	 For my life is not worth a farthing;
 	 I paid you a guinea for my lodging last night,
 	 But I fear Ill never see sun shining.
 212D.7	 If ye will be advised by me,
 	 Ill be your undertaking;
 	 Ill dress you up in my ain body-clothes
 	 And set you to the baking.
 212D.8	 So loudly at the door they rapt,
 	 So loudly are they calling,
 	 O had you a stranger here last night,
 	 Or is he within your dwelling?
 212D.9	 O I had a stranger here last night,
 	 But he wos gane or dawing;
 	 He cad for a pint, and he paid it or he went,
 	 And I hae nae mair to do wi his lawing.
 212D.10	 They stabd the feather-beds round and round,
 	 The curtains they spared na to tear them;
 	 But they went as they came, and left a things undone,
 	 And the young man busy baking.

 212E.1	 I AM the Duke o Atholes nurse,
 	 My part does well become me,
 	 And I wad gie aw my half-years fee
 	 For ae sicht o my Johnie.
 212E.2	 Keep weill, keep weill your half-years fee,
 	 For yell soon get a sicht o your Johnie;
 	 But anither woman has my heart,

 	 And drank till the day was dawin,
 	 And ay he drank the bonnie lassys health
 	 That was coming to pay the lawin.
 212E.5	 He spared na the sack, tho it was dear,
 	 The wine nor the sugar-candy,
 	 . . . .
 	 . . . .
 212E.6	 Hes dune him to the shot-window,

 	 And set him till a baking.
 212E.8	 Sae loudly as they rappit at the yett,
 	 Sae loudly as they callit,
 	 Had ye onie strangers here last nicht,
 	 That drank till the day was dawin?

 <h3 align="CENTER">212F: The Duke of Atholes Nurse</h3>
 <pre>
 
 212F.1	 AS I gaed in yon greenwood-side,
 	 I heard a fair maid singing;
 	 Her voice was sweet, she sang sae complete
 	 That all the woods were ringing.
 212F.2	 O Im the duke o Atholes nurse,
 	 My post is well becoming;
 	 But I woud gie a my half-years fee
 	 For ae sight o my leman.
 212F.3	 Ye say, yere the Duke o Atholes nurse,
 	 Your post is well becoming;
 	 Keep well, keep well your half-years fee,
 	 Yese hae twa sights o your leman.
 212F.4	 He leand him ower his saddle-bow
 	 And cannilie kissd his dearie:
 	 Ohon and alake! anither has my heart,
 	 And I darena mair come near thee.
 212F.5	 Ohon and alake! if anither hae your heart,
 	 These words hae fairly undone me;
 	 But let us set a time, tryst to meet again,
 	 Then in gude friends you will twine me.
 212F.6	 Ye will do you down to yon tavern-house
 	 And drink till the day be dawing,
 	 And, as sure as I ance had a love for you,
 	 Ill come there and clear your lawing.
 212F.7	 Yell spare not the wine, altho it be fine,
 	 Nae Malago, tho it be rarely,
 	 But yell aye drink the bonnie lassies health
 	 Thats to clear your lawing fairly.
 212F.8	 Then hes done him down to yon tavern-house
 	 And drank till day was dawing,
 	 And aye he drank the bonnie lassies health
 	 That was coming to clear his lawing.
 212F.9	 And aye as he birled, and aye as he drank,
 	 The gude beer and the brandy,
 	 He spard not the wine, altho it was fine,
 	 The sack nor the sugar candy.
 212F.10	 Its a wonder to me, the knight he did say,
 	 My bonnie lassies sae delaying;
 	 She promised, as sure as she loved me ance,
 	 She woud be here by the dawing.
 212F.11	 Hes done him to a shott-window,
 	 A little before the dawing,
 	 And there he spied her nine brothers bauld,
 	 Were coming to betray him.
 212F.12	 Where shall I rin? where shall I gang?
 	 Or where shall I gang hide me?
 	 She that was to meet me in friendship this day
 	 Has sent nine men to slay me!
 212F.13	 Hes gane to the landlady o the house,
 	 Says, O can you supply me?
 	 For she that was to meet me in friendship this day
 	 Has sent nine men to slay me.
 212F.14	 She gae him a suit o her ain female claise
 	 And set him to the baking;
 	 The bird never sang mair sweet on the bush
 	 Nor the knight sung at the baking.
 212F.15	 As they came in at the ha-door,
 	 Sae loudly as they rappit!
 	 And when they came upon the floor,
 	 Sae loudly as they chappit!
 212F.16	 O had ye a stranger here last night,
 	 Who drank till the day was dawing?
 	 Come show us the chamber where he lyes in,
 	 Well shortly clear his lawing.
 212F.17	 I had nae stranger here last night
 	 That drank till the day was dawing;
 	 But ane that took a pint, and paid it ere he went,
 	 And theres naething to clear o his lawing.
 212F.18	 A lad among the rest, being o a merry mood,
 	 To the young knight fell a-talking;
 	 The wife took her foot and gae him a kick,
 	 Says, Be busy, ye jilt, at your baking.
 212F.19	 They stabbed the house baith but and ben,
 	 The curtains they spared nae riving,
 	 And for a that they search and ca,
 	 For a kiss o the knight they were striving.
