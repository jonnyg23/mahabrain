 <h1 align="CENTER">77A: Sweet Williams Ghost</h1>
 <pre>
 
 77A.1	THERE came a ghost to Margrets door,
 	With many a grievous groan,
 	And ay he tirled at the pin,
 	But answer made she none.
 77A.2	Is that my father Philip,
 	Or ist my brother John?
 	Or ist my true-love, Willy,
 	From Scotland new come home?
 77A.3	Tis not thy father Philip,
 	Nor yet thy brother John;
 	But tis thy true-love, Willy,
 	From Scotland new come home.
 77A.4	O sweet Margret, O dear Margret,
 	I pray thee speak to me;
 	Give me my faith and troth, Margret,
 	As I gave it to thee.
 77A.5	Thy faith and troth thous never get,
 	Nor yet will I thee lend,
 	Till that thou come within my bower,
 	And kiss my cheek and chin.
 77A.6	If I shoud come within thy bower,
 	I am no earthly man;
 	And shoud I kiss thy rosy lips,
 	Thy days will not be lang.
 77A.7	O sweet Margret, O dear Margret,
 	I pray thee speak to me;
 	Give me my faith and troth, Margret,
 	As I gave it to thee.
 77A.8	Thy faith and troth thous never get,
 	Nor yet will I thee lend,
 	Till you take me to yon kirk,
 	And wed me with a ring.
 77A.9	My bones are buried in yon kirk-yard,
 	Afar beyond the sea,
 	And it is but my spirit, Margret,
 	Thats now speaking to thee.
 77A.10	She stretchd out her lilly-white hand,
 	And, for to do her best,
 	Hae, theres your faith and troth, Willy,
 	God send your soul good rest.
 77A.11	Now she has kilted her robes of green
 	A piece below her knee,
 	And a the live-lang winter night
 	The dead corp followed she.
 77A.12	Is there any room at your head, Willy?
 	Or any room at your feet?
 	Or any room at your side, Willy,
 	Wherein that I may creep?
 77A.13	Theres no room at my head, Margret,
 	Theres no room at my feet;
 	Theres no room at my side, Margret,
 	My coffins made so meet.
 77A.14	Then up and crew the red, red cock,
 	And up then crew the gray:
 	Tis time, tis time, my dear Margret,
 	That you were going away.
 77A.15	No more the ghost to Margret said,
 	But, with a grievous groan,
 	Evanishd in a cloud of mist,
 	And left her all alone.
 77A.16	O stay, my only true-love, stay,
 	The constant Margret cryd;
 	Wan grew her cheeks, she closd her een,
 	Stretchd her soft limbs, and dyd.

 77B.1	WHAN bells war rung, an mass was sung,
 	A wat a man to bed were gone,
 	Clark Sanders came to Margrets window,
 	With mony a sad sigh and groan.
 77B.2	Are ye sleeping, Margret, he says,
 	Or are ye waking, presentlie?
 	Give me my faith and trouthe again,
 	A wat, trew-love, I gied to thee.
 77B.3	Your faith and trouth yes never get,
 	Nor our trew love shall never twain,
 	Till ye come with me in my bower,
 	And kiss me both cheek and chin.
 77B.4	My mouth it is full cold, Margret,
 	It has the smell now of the ground;
 	And if I kiss thy comely mouth,
 	Thy life-days will not be long.
 77B.5	Cocks are crowing a merry mid-larf,
 	I wat the wild fule boded day;
 	Gie me my faith and trouthe again,
 	And let me fare me on my way.
 77B.6	Thy faith and trouth thou shall na get,
 	Nor our trew love shall never twin,
 	Till ye tell me what comes of women
 	Awat that dys in strong traveling.
 77B.7	Their beds are made in the heavens high,
 	Down at the foot of our good Lords knee,
 	Well set about wi gilly-flowers,
 	A wat sweet company for to see.
 77B.8	O cocks are crowing a merry midd-larf,
 	A wat the wilde foule boded day;
 	The salms of Heaven will be sung,
 	And ere now Ile be misst away.
 77B.9	Up she has tain a bright long wand,
 	And she has straked her trouth thereon;
 	She has given [it] him out at the shot-window,
 	Wi many a sad sigh and heavy groan.
 77B.10	I thank you, Margret, I thank you, Margret,
 	And I thank you hartilie;
 	Gine ever the dead come for the quick,
 	Be sure, Margret, Ill come again for thee.
 77B.11	Its hose an shoon an gound alane
 	She clame the wall and followed him,
 	Untill she came to a green forest,
 	On this she lost the sight of him.
 77B.12	Is their any room at your head, Sanders?
 	Is their any room at your feet?
 	Or any room at your twa sides?
 	Whare fain, fain woud I sleep.
 77B.13	Their is na room at my head, Margret,
 	Their is na room at my feet;
 	There is room at my twa sides,
 	For ladys for to sleep.
 77B.14	Cold meal is my covering owre,
 	But an my winding sheet;
 	My bed it is full low, I say,
 	Down among the hongerey worms I sleep.
 77B.15	Cold meal is my covering owre,
 	But an my winding sheet;
 	The dew it falls na sooner down
 	Then ay it is full weet.

 	But Im your true love, Sweet William,
 	From England thats newly come.

 	Or any silks so fine?
 	Or have ye brought me any precious things,
 	That merchants have for sale?
 77C.5	I have not brought you any scarlets sae red,
 	No, no, nor the silks so fine;
 	But I have brought you my winding-sheet,
