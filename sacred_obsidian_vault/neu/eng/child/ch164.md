 <h1 align="CENTER">164A: King Henry Fifths Conquest of France</h1>
 <pre>
 
 164A.1	 AS our king lay musing on his bed,
 	 He bethought himself upon a time
 	 Of a tribute that was due from France,
 	 Had not been paid for so long a time.
 	 Fal, lal, etc.
 164A.2	 He called for his lovely page,
 	 His lovely page then called he,
 	 Saying, You must go to the king of France,
 	 To the king of France, sir, ride speedily.
 164A.3	 O then went away this lovely page,
 	 This lovely page then away went he;
 	 And when he came to the king of France,
 	 Low he fell down on his bended knee.
 164A.4	 My master greets you, worthy sir;
 	 Ten ton of gold that is due to he,
 	 That you will send him his tribute home,
 	 Or in French land you soon will him see.
 164A.5	 Your masters young and of tender years,
 	 Not fir to come into my degree,
 	 And I will send him three tennis-balls,
 	 That with them he may learn to play.
 164A.6	 O then returned this lovely page,
 	 This lovely page then returned he,
 	 And when he came to our gracious king,
 	 Low he fell down on his bended knee.
 164A.7	 What news, what news, my trusty page?
 	 What is the news you have brought to me?
 	 I have brought such news from the king of France
 	 That you and he will never agree.
 164A.8	 He says youre young and of tender years,
 	 Not fit to come into his degree,
 	 And he will send you three tennis-balls,
 	 That with them you may learn to play.
 164A.9	 Recruit me Cheshire and Lancashire,
 	 And Derby Hills that are so free;
 	 No marryd man nor no widows son;
 	 For no widows curse shall go with me.
 164A.10	 They recruited Cheshire and Lancashire,
 	 And Derby Hills that are so free;
 	 No marryd man, nor no widows son;
 	 Yet there was a jovial bold company.
 164A.11	 O then we marchd into the French land,
 	 With drums and trumpets so merrily;
 	 And then bespoke the king of France,
 	 Lo, yonder comes proud King Henry.
 164A.12	 The first shot that the Frenchmen gave,
 	 They killd our Englishmen so free;
 	 We killd ten thousand of the French,
 	 And the rest of them they ran away.
 164A.13	 And then we marched to Paris gates,
 	 With drums and trumpets so merrily:
 	 O then bespoke the king of France,
 	 The Lord have mercy on my men and me!
 164A.14	 O I will send him his tribute home,
 	 Ten ton of gold that is due to he,
 	 And the finest flower that is in all France
 	 To the Rose of England I will give free.
