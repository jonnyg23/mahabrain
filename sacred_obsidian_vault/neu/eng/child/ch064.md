 <pre>
 
 64A.1	YE maun gang to your father, Janet,
 	Ye maun gang to him soon;
 	Ye maun gang to your father, Janet,
 	In case that his days are dune.
 64A.2	Janets awa to her father,
 	As fast as she could hie:
 	O whats your will wi me, father?
 	O whats your will wi me?
 64A.3	My will wi you, Fair Janet, he said,
 	It is both bed and board;
 	Some say that he loe Sweet Willie,
 	But ye maun wed a French lord.
 64A.4	A French lord maun I wed, father?
 	A French lord maun I wed?
 	Then, by my sooth, quo Fair Janet,
 	Hes neer enter my bed.
 64A.5	Janets awa to her chamber,
 	As fast as she could go;
 	Whas the first ane that tapped there,
 	But Sweet Willie her jo?
 64A.6	O we maun part this love, Willie,
 	That has been lang between;
 	Theres a French lord coming oer the sea,
 	To wed me wi a ring;
 	Theres a French lord coming oer the sea,
 	To wed and tak me hame.
 64A.7	If we maun part this love, Janet,
 	It causeth mickle woe;
 	If we maun part this love, Janet,
 	It makes me into mourning go.
 64A.8	But ye maun gang to your three sisters,
 	Meg, Marion, and Jean;
 	Tell them to come to Fair Janet,
 	In case that her days are dune.
 64A.9	Willies awa to his three sisters,
 	Meg, Marion, and Jean:
 	O haste, and gang to Fair Janet,
 	I fear that her days are dune.
 64A.10	Some drew to them their silken hose,
 	Some drew to them their shoon,
 	Some drew to them their silk manteils,
 	Their covering to put on,
 	And theyre awa to Fair Janet,
 	By the hie light o the moon.
 	* * * * *
 64A.11	O I have born this babe, Willie,
 	Wi mickle toil and pain;
 	Take hame, take hame, your babe, Willie,
 	For nurse I dare be nane.
 64A.12	Hes tane his young son in his arms,
 	And kisst him cheek and chin,
 	And hes awa to his mothers bower,
 	By the hie light o the moon.
 64A.13	O open, open, mother, he says,
 	O open, and let me in;
 	The rain rains on my yellow hair,
 	And the dew drops oer my chin,
 	And I hae my young son in my arms,
 	I fear that his days are dune.
 64A.14	With her fingers lang and sma
 	She lifted up the pin,
 	And with her arms lang and sma
 	Received the baby in.
 64A.15	Gae back, gae back now, Sweet Willie,
 	And comfort your fair lady;
 	For where ye had but ae nourice,
 	Your young son shall hae three.
 64A.16	Willie he was scarce awa,
 	And the lady put to bed,
 	Whan in and came her father dear:
 	Make haste, and busk the bride.
 64A.17	Theres a sair pain in my head, father,
 	Theres a sair pain in my side;
 	And ill, O ill, am I, father,
 	This day for to be a bride.
 64A.18	O ye maun busk this bonny bride,
 	And put a gay mantle on;
 	For she shall wed this auld French lord,
 	Gin she should die the morn.
 64A.19	Some put on the gay green robes,
 	And some put on the brown;
 	But Janet put on the scarlet robes,
 	To shine foremost throw the town.
 64A.20	And some they mounted the black steed,
 	And some mounted the brown;
 	But Janet mounted the milk-white steed,
 	To ride foremost throw the town.
 64A.21	O wha will guide your horse, Janet?
 	O wha will guide him best?
 	O wha but Willie, my true-love?
 	He kens I loe him best.
 64A.22	And when they cam to Maries kirk,
 	To tye the haly ban,
 	Fair Janets cheek looked pale and wan,
 	And her colour gaed an cam.
 64A.23	When dinner it was past and done,
 	And dancing to begin,
 	O well go take the brides maidens,
 	And well go fill the ring.
 64A.24	O ben than cam the auld French lord,
 	Saying, Bride, will ye dance with me?
 	Awa, awa, ye auld French lord,
 	Your face I downa see.
 64A.25	O ben than cam now Sweet Willie,
 	He cam with ane advance:
 	O Ill go tak the brides maidens,
 	And well go tak a dance.
 64A.26	Ive seen ither days wi you, Willie,
 	And so has mony mae,
 	Ye would hae danced wi me mysel,
 	Let a my maidens gae.
 64A.27	O ben than cam now Sweet Willie,
 	Saying, Bride, will ye dance wi me?
 	Aye, by my sooth, and that I will,
 	Gin my back should break in three.
 64A.28	She had nae turned her throw the dance,
 	Throw the dance but thrice,
 	When she fell doun at Willies feet,
 	And up did never rise.
 64A.29	Willies taen the key of his coffer,
 	And gien it to his man:
 	Gae hame, and tell my mother dear
 	My horse he has me slain;
 	Bid her be kind to my young son,
 	For father he has nane.
 64A.30	The tane was buried in Maries kirk,
 	And the tither in Maries quire;
 	Out of the tane there grew a birk,
 	And the tither a bonny brier.

 64B.1	IF you do love me weel, Willie,
 	Yell shew to me truelie;
 	Yell build to me a bonnie ship,
 	And set her on the sea.
 64B.2	He did love her very weel,
 	He shewed to her trulie;
 	He builded her a bonnie ship,
 	And set her on the sea.
 64B.3	They had not sailed one league, one league,
 	One league but only three,
 	Till sharp, sharp showers fair Janet took,
 	She grew sick and like to die.
 64B.4	If you do love me weel, Willie,
 	Yell shew to me trulye;
 	Yell tak me to my mothers bower,
 	Whare I was wont to be.
 64B.5	He did love her very weel,
 	He shewed to her trulye;
 	He took her to her mothers bower,
 	Whare she was wont to be.
 64B.6	Its yell stand up at my richt side,
 	You will on tiptaes stand,
 	Until you hear your auld son weep,
 	But an you Janet mourn.
 64B.7	Come take your auld son in your arms,
 	He is both large and lang;
 	Come take your auld son in your arms,
 	And for a nourice gang.
 64B.8	He is to his mothers bowers,
 	An hour or it struck nine:
 	I have a babe into my arms,
 	Hell die nor nouricing.
 64B.9	Goe home, go home, my son, she says,
 	And mak thy Jenny blythe;
 	If ae nurse winna sere her son,
 	Its Ill provide him five.
 64B.10	Fair Janet was nae weel lichter,
 	Nor weel doun on her side,
 	Till ben and cam her father dear,
 	Saying, Wha will busk our bride?
 64B.11	Ben and cam her brethren dear,
 	Saying, Wha will busk our bride?
 	And wha will saddle our brides horse?
 	Whom ahint will she ride?
 64B.12	Hold your tongue, my brethren dear,
 	And let your folly be,
 	For Im sae fair and full of hair
 	Sma busking will serve me.
 64B.13	Hold your tongue, my brethren dear,
 	And let your folly be,
 	For I will ride behint William,
 	He will best wait on me.
 64B.14	Willie, lay the saddle saft,
 	And lead the bridle soun,
 	And when we come to Marys Kirk,
 	Yell set me hooly down.
 64B.15	Supper scarslie was owre,
 	Nor musick weel fan to,
 	Till ben and cam the brides brethren,
 	Saying, Bride, yell dance wi me:
 	Awa, awa, my brethren dear,
 	For dancings no for me.
 64B.16	Ben and came her ain bridegroom,
 	Saying, Bride, yell dance wi me;
 	She says, Awa, awa, ye southland dog,
 	Your face I downa see.
 64B.17	Ben and cam then Sweet Willie,
 	Saying, Bride, yell dance wi me:
 	Oh I will dance the floor once owre,
 	Tho my heart should break in three.
 64B.18	Oh no, oh no, said Sweet William,
 	Let no such things eer be;
 	But I will cut my glove in two,
 	And Ill dance for thee and me.
 64B.19	She hadna danced the floor once owre,
 	Im sure she hadna thrice,
 	Till she fell in a deadly swound,
 	And from it neer did rise.
 64B.20	Out and spak her ain bridegroom,
 	And an angry man was he:
 	This day she has gien me the gecks,
 	Yet she must bear the scorn;
 	Theres not a bell in merry Linkum
 	Shall ring for her the morn.
 64B.21	Out and spoke then Sweet William,
 	And a sorry man was he:
 	Altho she has gien you the gecks,
 	She will not bear the scorn;
 	Theres not a bell in merry Linkum
 	But shall ring for her the morn.
 64B.22	There was not a bell in merry Linkum
 	But they tinkled and they rang,
 	And a the birds that flew above,
 	They changed their notes and sang.

 64C.1	LIVD ance twa luvers in yon dale,
 	And they luvd ither weel;
 	Frae evning late to morning aire
 	Of luving luvd their fill.
 64C.2	Now, Willie, gif you luve me weel,
 	As sae it seems to me,
 	Gar build, gar build a bonny schip,
 	Gar build it speedilie.
 64C.3	AnRR rrwe wLl saL the sea sae g-een,
 	Unto some far countrie,
 	Or well sail to some bonie isle,
 	Stands lanely midst the sea.
 64C.4	But lang or ere the schip was built,
 	Or deckd, or rigged out,
 	Came sick a pain in Annets back
 	That down she coud na lout.
 64C.5	Now, Willie, gif ye luve me weel,
 	As sae it seems to me,
 	O haste, haste, bring me to my bowr,
 	And my bowr-maidens three.
 64C.6	Hes taen her in his arms twa,
 	And kissd her, cheik and chin;
 	Hes brocht her to her ain sweet bowr,
 	But nae bowr-maid was in.
 64C.7	Now leave my bower, Willie, she said,
 	Now leave me to my lane;
 	When she was travelling.
 64C.8	Hes stepped three steps down the stair,
 	Upon the marble stane;
 	Sae louds he heard his young sons greet,
 	But and his ladys mane!
 64C.9	Now come, now come, Willie, she said,
 	Tak your young son frae me,
 	And hie him to your mothers bower,
 	With speed and privacie.
 64C.10	Hes taen his young son in his arms,
 	Hes kissd him, cheik and chin;
 	Hes hied him to his mothers bower,
 	By th ae light of the moon.
 64C.11	And with him came the bold barone,
 	And he spake up wi pride:
 	Gar seek, gar seek the bower-maidens,
 	Gar busk, gar busk the bryde.
 64C.12	My maidens, easy with my back,
 	And easy with my side;
 	O set my saddle saft, Willie,
 	I am a tender bryde.
 64C.13	When she came to the burrow-town,
 	They gied her a broch and ring,
 	And when she came to . . .,
 	They had a fair wedding.
 64C.14	O up then spake the norland lord,
 	And blinkit wi his ee:
 	I trow this ladys born a bairn,
 	Then laucht loud lauchters three.
 64C.15	And up then spake the brisk bridegroom,
 	And he spake up wi pryde:
 	Gin I should pawn my wedding-gloves,
 	I will dance wi the bryde.
 64C.16	Now had your tongue, my lord, she said,
 	Wi dancing let me be;
 	I am sae thin in flesh and blude,
 	Sma dancing will serve me.
 64C.17	But shes taen Willie be the hand,
 	The tear blinded her ee:
 	But I wad dance wi my true-luve,
 	But bursts my heart in three.
 64C.18	Shes taen her bracelet frae her arm,
 	Her garter frae her knee:
 	Gie that, gie that to my young son,
 	Hell neer his mother see.

 64C.19	Gar deal, gar deal the bread, mother,
 	Gar deal, gar deal the wyne;
 	This day hath seen my true-loves death,
 	This nicht shall witness myne.

 64D.1	IT never was my mothers fashion,
 	As little willt be mine,
 	For to hae gay lords within my room
 	When ladies are travailing.
 64D.2	Lord William was scarsely down the stair,
 	A step but only ane,
 	Till he heard his auld son gie a cry,
 	And his lady a heavy maen.
 64D.3	Turn back, turn back, Lord William, she says,
 	Take thy auld son in thy coat-neuk,

 	When four and twenty knights and lords
 	Came for the bride at last.
 64D.8	They dressed her up, they dressed her down,
 	They dressed her wondrous fine,

 	She lost her colour clean.

 64F.2	Yell mount me quickly on a steed,

 	The brides father he took the cup,
 	For to serve out the wine.
 64F.25	Out it speaks the bridegrooms brother,
 	An ill death mat he die!
 	I fear our bride shes born a bairn,
 	Or else has it a dee.
 64F.26	Shes taen out a Bible braid,
 	And deeply has she sworn;
 	If I hae born a bairn, she says,
 	Sin yesterday at morn,
 64F.27	Or if Ive born a bairn, she says,
 	Sin yesterday at noon,
 	Theres nae a lady amang you a
 	That woud been here sae soon.
 64F.28	Then out it spake the bridegrooms man,
 	Mischance come ower his heel!
 	Win up, win up, now bride, he says,
 	And dance a shamefu reel.
 64F.29	Then out it speaks the bride hersell,
 	And a sorry heart had she:
 	Is there nae ane amang you a
 	Will dance this dance for me?
 64F.30	Then out it speaks him Sweet Willie,
 	And he spake aye thro pride:
 	O draw my boots for me, bridegroom,
 	Or I dance for your bride.
 64F.31	Then out it spake the bride hersell:
 	O na, this maunna be;
 	For I will dance this dance mysell,
 	Tho my back shoud gang in three.
 64F.32	She hadna well gane thro the reel,
 	Nor yet well on the green,
 	Till she fell down at Willies feet
 	As cauld as ony stane.
 64F.33	Hes taen her in his arms twa,
 	And haed her up the stair;
 	Then up it came her jolly bridegroom,
 	Says, Whats your business there?
 64F.34	Then Willie lifted up his foot,
 	And dang him down the stair,
 	And brake three ribs o the bridegrooms side,
 	And a word he spake nae mair.
 64F.35	Nae meen was made for that lady,
 	When she was lying dead;
 	But a was for him Sweet Willie,
 	On the fields for he ran mad.

 	A queen of fair England to be?
 	Or will you burn for Sweet Willie,
 	The morn upon yon lea?
 64G.2	I will marry the southland lord,
 	Father, sen it is your will;
 	But Id rather it were my burial-day,
 	For my grave Im going till.

 	O go now hastilie,
 	O go now to Sweet Willies bower,
 	And bid him cum speak to me.

 64G.4	And he is to his mothers bower,
 	As fast as he could rin:
 	Open, open, my mother dear,
 	Open, and let me in.
 64G.5	For the rain rains on my yellow hair,
 	The dew stands on my chin,
 	And I have something in my lap,
 	And I wad fain be in.
 64G.6	O go, O go now, Sweet Willie,
 	And make your lady blithe,
 	For wherever you had ae nourice,

 	Says, Whare is a our brides maidens,
 	Theyre no busking the bride?

 	And he swore by the thorn,
 	That she was as free o a child that night
 	As the night that she was born.
 64G.12	Ye hae gien me the gowk, Annet,
 	But Ill gie you the scorn;
 	For theres no a bell in a the town
 	Shall ring for you the morn.
 64G.13	Out and spak then Sweet Willie:
 	Sae louds I hear you lie!
 	Theres no a bell in a the town
 	But shall ring for Annet and me.
