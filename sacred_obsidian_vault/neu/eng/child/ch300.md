 <h1 align="CENTER">300A: Blancheflour and Jellyflorice</h1>
 <pre>
 
 300A.1	 THERE was a maid, richly arrayd,
 	 In robes were rare to see,
 	 For seven years and something mair
 	 She servd a gay ladie.
 300A.2	 But being fond o a higher place,
 	 In service she thought lang;
 	 She took her mantle her about,
 	 Her coffer by the band.
 300A.3	 And as she walkd by the shore-side,
 	 As blythes a bird on tree,
 	 Yet still she gazd her round about,
 	 To see what she could see.
 300A.4	 At last she spied a little castle,
 	 That stood near by the sea;
 	 She spied it far and drew it near,
 	 To that castle went she.
 300A.5	 And when she came to that castle
 	 She tirled at the pin,
 	 And ready stood a little wee boy
 	 To lat this fair maid in.
 300A.6	 O whos the owner of this place,
 	 O porter-boy, tell me;
 	 This place belongs unto a queen
 	 O birth and high degree.
 300A.7	 She put her hand in her pocket,
 	 And gae him shillings three:
 	 O porter, bear my message well
 	 Unto the queen frae me.
 300A.8	 The porters gane before the queen,
 	 Fell low down on his knee:
 	 Win up, win up, my porter-boy,
 	 What makes this courtesie?
 300A.9	 I hae been porter at your yetts,
 	 My dame, these years full three,
 	 But see a ladie at your yetts
 	 The fairest my eyes did see.
 300A.10	 Cast up my yetts baith wide and braid,
 	 Lat her come in to me,
 	 And Ill know by her courtesie
 	 Lords daughter if she be.
 300A.11	 When she came in before the queen,
 	 Fell low down on her knee:
 	 Service frae you, my dame the queen,
 	 I pray you grant it me.
 300A.12	 If that service ye now do want,
 	 What station will ye be?
 	 Can ye card wool, or spin, fair maid,
 	 Or milk the cows to me?
 300A.13	 No, I can neither card nor spin,
 	 Nor cows I canno milk,
 	 But sit into a ladys bower
 	 And sew the seams o silk.
 300A.14	 What is your name, ye comely dame?
 	 Pray tell this unto me:
 	 O Blancheflour, that is my name,
 	 Born in a strange countrie.
 300A.15	 O keep ye well frae Jellyflorice-+--+-
 	 My ain dear son is he-+--+-
 	 When other ladies get a gift,
 	 O that ye shall get three.
 300A.16	 It wasna tald into the bower
 	 Till it went thro the ha,
 	 That Jellyflorice and Blancheflour
 	 Were grown ower great witha.
 300A.17	 When the queens maids their visits paid,
 	 Upo the gude Yule-day,
 	 When other ladies got horse to ride,
 	 She boud take foot and gae.
 300A.18	 The queen she calld her stable-groom,
 	 To come to her right seen;
 	 Says, Yell take out yon wild waith steed
 	 And bring him to the green.
 300A.19	 Yell take the bridle frae his head,
 	 The lighters frae his een;
 	 Ere she ride three times roun the cross,
 	 Her weel-days will be dune.
 300A.20	 Jellyflorice his true-love spyd
 	 As she rade roun the cross,
 	 And thrice he kissd her lovely lips,
 	 And took her frae her horse.
 300A.21	 Gang to your bower, my lily-flower,
 	 For a my mothers spite;
 	 Theres nae other amang her maids,
 	 In whom I take delight.
 300A.22	 Ye are my jewel, and only ane,
 	 Nane s do you injury;
 	 For ere this-day-month come and gang
 	 My wedded wife yese be.
