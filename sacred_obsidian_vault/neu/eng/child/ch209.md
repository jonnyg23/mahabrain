 <pre>
 
 209A.1	 THERE was a battle in the north,
 	 And nobles there was many,
 	 And they hae killd Sir Charlie Hay,
 	 And they laid the wyte on Geordie.
 209A.2	 O he has written a lang letter,
 	 He sent it to his lady:
 	 Ye maun cum up to Enbrugh town,
 	 To see what words o Geordie.
 209A.3	 When first she lookd the letter on,
 	 She was baith red and rosy;
 	 But she had na read a word but twa
 	 Till she wallowt like a lily.
 209A.4	 Gar get to me my gude grey steed,
 	 My menyie a gae wi me,
 	 For I shall neither eat nor drink
 	 Till Enbrugh town shall see me.
 209A.5	 And she has mountit her gude grey steed,
 	 Her menyie a gaed wi her,
 	 And she did neither eat nor drink
 	 Till Enbrugh town did see her.
 209A.6	 And first appeard the fatal block,
 	 And syne the aix to head him,
 	 And Geordie cumin down the stair,
 	 And bands o airn upon him.
 209A.7	 But tho he was chaind in fetters strang,
 	 O airn and steel sae heavy,
 	 There was na ane in a the court
 	 Sae bra a man as Geordie.
 209A.8	 O shes down on her bended knee,
 	 I wat shes pale and weary:
 	 O pardon, pardon, noble king,
 	 And gie me back my dearie!
 209A.9	 I hae born seven sons to my Geordie dear,
 	 The seventh neer saw his daddie;
 	 O pardon, pardon, noble king,
 	 Pity a waefu lady!
 209A.10	 Gar bid the headin-man mak haste,
 	 Our king replyd fu lordly:
 	 O noble king, tak a thats mine,
 	 But gie me back my Geordie!
 209A.11	 The Gordons cam, and the Gordons ran,
 	 And they were stark and steady,
 	 And ay the word amang them a
 	 Was, Gordons, keep you ready!
 209A.12	 An aged lord at the kings right hand
 	 Says, Noble king, but hear me;
 	 Gar her tell down five thousand pound,
 	 And gie her back her dearie.
 209A.13	 Some gae her marks, some gae her crowns,
 	 Some gae her dollars many,
 	 And shes telld down five thousand pound,
 	 And shes gotten again her dearie.
 209A.14	 She blinkit blythe in her Geordies face,
 	 Says, Dear Ive bought thee, Geordie;
 	 But there sud been bluidy bouks on the green
 	 Or I had tint my laddie.
 209A.15	 He claspit her by the middle sma,
 	 And he kist her lips sae rosy:
 	 The fairest flower o woman-kind
 	 Is my sweet, bonie lady!

 	 And on ahint her Geordie,
 	 The bird on the bush neer sang sae sweet,
 	 As she sung to her love Geordie.
 209H.17	 First I was mistress o bonny Auchindown,
 	 And I was lady o a Carnie,
 	 But now I have come to the bonny Bog o Gight,
 	 The wife o my true-love Geordie.
 209H.18	 If I were in the high Hielans,
 	 I would hear the white kye lowing;
 	 But Id rather be on the bonny banks o Spey,
 	 To see the fish-boaties rowing.

 209I.1	 I choosed my love at the bonny yates of Gight,
 	 Where the birks an the flowers spring bony,
 	 But pleasures I had never one,
 	 But crosses very mony.
 209I.2	 First I was mistress of Pitfan
 	 And madam of Kincraigie,
 	 And now my name is bonny Lady Anne,
 	 And I am Gights own lady.
 209I.3	 He does not use me as his wife,
 	 Nor cherish me as his lady,
 	 But day by day he saddles the grey,
 	 And rides off to Bignets lady.
 209I.4	 Bignet he got word of this,
 	 That Gight lay wi his lady;
 	 He swore a vow, and kept it true,
 	 To be revengd on s body.
 209I.5	 Where will I get a bonny boy
 	 Will run my errand shortly,
 	 That woud run on to the bonny yates o Gight
 	 Wi a letter to my lady?
 209I.6	 Gight has written a broad letter,
 	 And seald it soon and ready,
 	 And sent it on to Gights own yates,
 	 For to acquaint his lady.
 209I.7	 The first of it she looked on,
 	 O dear! she smiled bonny;
 	 But as she read it till an end
 	 The tears were thick an mony.
 209I.8	 Come saddle to me the black, she says,
 	 Come saddle him soon and shortly,
 	 Ere I ride down to Edinburgh town,
 	 Wi a lang side sark to Geordy.
 209I.9	 When she came to the boat of Leith,
 	 I wad she did na tarry;
 	 She gave the boatman a guinea o gold
 	 To boat her oer the ferry.
 209I.10	 As she gaed oer the pier of Leith,
 	 Among the peerls many,
 	 She dealt the crowns and dukedoons,
 	 Bade them a pray for Geordy.
 209I.11	 As she gaed up the tolbooth-stair,
 	 Among the nobles many,
 	 Every one sat hat on head,
 	 But hat in hand stood Geordy.
 209I.12	 Has he brunt? or has he slain?
 	 Or has he robb d any?
 	 Or has he done any other crime,
 	 That gars you head my Geordy?
 209I.13	 He hasna brunt, he hasna slain,
 	 He hasna robbed any;
 	 But he has done another crime,
 	 For which he will pay dearly.
 209I.14	 In it comes First Lord Judge,
 	 Says, George, Im sorry for you;
 	 You must prepare yourself for death,
 	 For therell be nae mercy for you.
 209I.15	 In it comes his Second Lord Judge,
 	 Says, George Im sorry for you;
 	 You must prepare yourself for death,
 	 For therell be nae mercy for you.
 209I.16	 Out it speaks Gights lady herself,
 	 And vow, but she spake wordy!
 	 Is there not a lord among you all
 	 Can plead a word for Geordy?
 209I.17	 Out it speaks the first Lord Judge:
 	 What ladys that amang you
 	 That speaks to us so boldly here,
 	 And bids us plead for Geordy?
 209I.18	 Out then spake a friend, her own,
 	 And says, Its Gights own lady,
 	 Who is come to plead her own lords cause,
 	 To which shes true and steady.
 209I.19	 The queen, looking oer her shott-window,
 	 Says, Ann, Im soory for you;
 	 If yell tell down ten thousand crowns,
 	 Ye shall get home your Geordy.
 209I.20	 Shes taen the hat out of his hand,
 	 And dear! it set her bonny;
 	 Shes beggd the red gold them among,
 	 And a to borrow Geordy.
 209I.21	 She turnd her right and round about
 	 Among the nobles many;
 	 Some gave her dollars, some her crowns,
 	 And some gave guineas many.
 209I.22	 She spread her mantle on the floor,
 	 O dear! she spread it bonny,
 	 And she told down that noble sum;
 	 Says, Put on your hat, my Geordy.
 209I.23	 But out it speaks him gleid Argyle,
 	 Says, Woe be to your body!
 	 I wish that Gight had lost his head,
 	 I should enjoyd his lady.
 209I.24	 She looked oer her left shoulder,
 	 A proud look and a saucy;
 	 Says, Woe be to you, gleid Argyle!
 	 Yell neer be like my Geordy.
 209I.25	 Youll hae me to some writers house,
 	 And that baith seen and shortly,
 	 That I may write down Gights lament,
 	 And how I borrowed Geordy.
 209I.26	 When she was in her saddle set,
 	 And aye behind her Geordy,
 	 Birds neer sang blyther in the bush
 	 Than she behind her Geordy.
 209I.27	 O bonny George, but I love thee well,
 	 And O sae dear as I love thee!
 	 The sun and moon and firmament above
 	 Bear witness how I love thee!
 209I.28	 O bonny Ann, but I love thee well,
 	 And O but sae dear as I love thee!
 	 The birds in the air, that fly together pair and pair,

 209J.1	 FIRST I was lady o Black Riggs,
 	 And then into Kincraigie;
 	 Now I am the Lady o Gight,
 	 And my love hes cad Geordie.
 209J.2	 I was the mistress o Pitfan,
 	 And madam o Kincraigie;
 	 But now my name is Lady Anne,
 	 And I am Gights own lady.
 209J.3	 We courted in the woods o Gight,
 	 Where birks and flowrs spring bonny;
 	 But pleasures I had never one,
 	 But sorrows thick and mony.
 209J.4	 He never ownd me as his wife,
 	 Nor honourd me as his lady,
 	 But day by day he saddles the grey,
 	 And rides to Bignets lady.
 209J.5	 When Bignet he got word of that,
 	 That Gight lay wi his lady,
 	 Hes casten him in prison strong,
 	 To ly till lords were ready.
 209J.6	 Where will I get a little wee boy,
 	 That is baith true and steady,
 	 That will run on to bonny Gight,
 	 And bring to me my lady?
 209J.7	 O here am I, a little wee boy,
 	 That is baith true and steady,
 	 That will run to the yates of Gight,
 	 And bring to you your lady.
 209J.8	 Yell bid her saddle the grey, the grey,
 	 The brown rode neer so smartly;
 	 Yell bid her come to Edinbro town,
 	 A for the life of Geordie.
 209J.9	 The night was fair, the moon was clear,
 	 And he rode by Bevany,
 	 And stopped at the yates o Gight,
 	 Where leaves were thick and mony.
 209J.10	 The lady lookd oer castle-wa,
 	 And dear, but she was sorry!
 	 Here comes a page frae Edinbro town;
 	 A is nae well wi Geordie.
 209J.11	 What news, what news, my little boy?
 	 Come tell me soon and shortly;
 	 Bad news, bad news, my lady, he said,
 	 Theyre going to hang your Geordie.
 209J.12	 Yell saddle to me the grey, the grey,
 	 The brown rade neer so smartly;
 	 And Ill awa to Edinbro town,
 	 Borrow the life o Geordie.
 209J.13	 When she came near to Edinbro town,
 	 I wyte she didna tarry,
 	 But she has mounted her grey steed,
 	 And ridden the Queens Ferry.
 209J.14	 When she came to the boat of Leith,
 	 I wat she didna tarry;
 	 She gae the boatman a guinea o gowd
 	 To boat her ower the ferry.
 209J.15	 When she came to the pier o Leith,
 	 The poor they were sae many;
 	 She dealt the gowd right liberallie,
 	 And bade them pray for Geordie.
 209J.16	 When she gaed up the tolbooth-stair,
 	 The nobles there were many:
 	 And ilka ane stood hat on head,
 	 But hat in hand stood Geordie.
 209J.17	 She gae a blink out-ower them a,
 	 And three blinks to her Geordie;
 	 But when she saw his een fast bound,
 	 A swoon fell in this lady.
 209J.18	 Whom has he robbd? What has he stole?
 	 Or has he killed ony?
 	 Or whats the crime that he has done,
 	 His foes they are sae mony?
 209J.19	 He hasna brunt, he hasna slain,
 	 He hasna robbed ony;
 	 But he has done another crime,
 	 For which he will pay dearly.
 209J.20	 Then out it speaks Lord Montague,
 	 O wae be to his body!
 	 The day we hangd young Charles Hay,
 	 The morn well head your Geordie.
 209J.21	 Then out it speaks the king himsell,
 	 Vow, but he spake bonny!
 	 Come here, young Gight, confess your sins,
 	 Lets hear if they be mony.
 209J.22	 Come here, young Gight, confess your sins,
 	 See ye be true and steady;
 	 And if your sins they be but sma,
 	 Then yese win wi your lady.
 209J.23	 Nane have I robbd, nought have I stown,
 	 Nor have I killed ony;
 	 But ane of the kings best brave steeds,
 	 I sold him in Bevany.
 209J.24	 Then out it speaks the king again,
 	 Dear, but he spake bonny!
 	 That crimes nae great; for your ladys sake,
 	 Put on your hat now, Geordie.
 209J.25	 Then out it speaks Lord Montague,
 	 O wae be to his body!
 	 Theres guilt appears in Gights ain face,
 	 Yell cross-examine Geordie.
 209J.26	 Now since it all I must confess,
 	 My crimes baith great and mony:
 	 A woman abused, five orphan babes,
 	 I killd them for their money.
 209J.27	 Out it speaks the king again,
 	 And dear, but he was sorry!
 	 Your confession brings confusion,
 	 Take aff your hat now, Geordie.
 209J.28	 Then out it speaks the lady hersell,
 	 Vow, but she was sorry!
 	 Now all my life Ill wear the black,
 	 Mourn for the death o Geordie.
 209J.29	 Lord Huntly then he did speak out,
 	 O fair mot fa his body!
 	 I there will fight doublet alane
 	 Or ony thing ails Geordie.
 209J.30	 Then out it speaks the king again,
 	 Vow, but he spake bonny!
 	 If yell tell down ten thousand crowns,
 	 Yell buy the life o Geordie.
 209J.31	 She spread her mantle on the ground,
 	 Dear, but she spread it bonny!
 	 Some gae her crowns, some ducadoons,
 	 And some gae dollars mony:
 	 Then she tauld down ten thousand crowns,
 	 Put on your hat, my Geordie.
 209J.32	 Then out it speaks Lord Montague,
 	 Wae be to his body!
 	 I wisht that Gight wanted the head;
 	 I might enjoyd his lady.
 209J.33	 Out it speaks the lady hersell,
 	 Ye need neer wish my body;
 	 O ill befa your wizzend snout!
 	 Woud ye compare wi Geordie?
 209J.34	 When she was in her saddle set,
 	 Riding the leys sae bonny,
 	 The fiddle and fleet playd neer sae sweet
 	 As she behind her Geordie.
 209J.35	 O Geordie, Geordie, I love you well,
 	 Nae jealousie coud move me;
 	 The birds in air, that fly in pairs,
 	 Can witness how I love you.
 209J.36	 Yell call for one, the best o clerks,
 	 Yell call him soon amd shortly,
 	 As he may write what I indite,
 	 A this Ive done for Geordie.
 209J.37	 He turned him right and round about,
 	 And high, high looked Geordie:
 	 A finger o Bignets ladys hand
 	 Is worth a your fair body.
 209J.38	 My lands may a be masterless,
 	 My babes may want their mother;
 	 But Ive made a vow, will keep it true,
 	 Ill be bound to no other.
 209J.39	 These words they causd a great dispute,
 	 And proud and fierce grew Geordie;
 	 A sharp dagger he pulled out,
 	 And pierced the heart o s lady.
 209J.40	 The ladys dead, and Gight hes fled,
 	 And left his lands behind him;
 	 Altho they searched south and north,
 	 There were nane there coud find him.
 209J.41	 Now a that lived into Black Riggs,
 	 And likewise in Kincraigie,
 	 For seven years were clad in black,
 	 To mourn for Gights own lady.
