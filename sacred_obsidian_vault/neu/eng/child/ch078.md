 <h1 align="CENTER">78A: The Unquiet Grave</h1>
 <pre>
 
 78A.1	THE wind doth blow today, my love,
 	And a few small drops of rain;
 	I never had but one true-love,
 	In cold grave she was lain.
 78A.2	Ill do as much for my true-love
 	As any young man may;
 	Ill sit and mourn all at her grave
 	For a twelvemonth and a day.
 78A.3	The twelvemonth and a day being up,
 	The dead began to speak:
 	Oh who sits weeping on my grave,
 	And will not let me sleep?
 78A.4	Tis I, my love, sits on your grave,
 	And will not let you sleep;
 	For I crave one kiss of your clay-cold lips,
 	And that is all I seek.
 78A.5	You crave one kiss of my clay-cold lips;
 	But my breath smells earthy strong;
 	If you have one kiss of my clay-cold lips,
 	Your time will not be long.
 78A.6	Tis down in yonder garden green,
 	Love, where we used to walk,
 	The finest flower that ere was seen
 	Is withered to a stalk.
 78A.7	The stalk is withered dry, my love,
 	So will our hearts decay;
 	So make yourself content, my love,
 	Till God calls you away.

 78B.1	HOW cold the wind do blow, dear love,
 	And see the drops of rain!
 	I never had but one true-love,
 	In the green wood he was slain.
 78B.2	I would do as much for my own true-love
 	As in my power doth lay;
 	I would sit and mourn all on his grave
 	For a twelvemonth and a day.
 78B.3	A twelvemonth and a day being past,
 	His ghost did rise and speak:
 	What makes you mourn all on my grave?
 	For you will not let me sleep.
 78B.4	It is not your gold I want, dear love,
 	Nor yet your wealth I crave;
 	But one kiss from your lily-white lips
 	Is all I wish to have.
 78B.5	Your lips are cold as clay, dear love,
 	Your breath doth smell so strong;
 	I am afraid, my pretty, pretty maid,
 	Your time will not be long.

 78D.1	PROUD BOREAS makes a hideous noise,
 	Loud roars the fatal fleed;
 	I loved never a love but one,
 	In church-yard she lies dead.
 78D.2	But I will do for my loves sake
 	What other young men may;
 	Ill sit and mourn upon her grave,
 	A twelvemonth and a day.
 78D.3	A twelvemonth and a day being past,
 	The ghost began to speak:
 	Why sit ye here upon my grave,
 	And will not let me sleep?
 78D.4	One kiss of your lily-white lips
 	Is all that I do crave;
 	And one kiss of your lily-white lips
 	Is all that I would have.
 78D.5	Your breath is as the roses sweet,
 	Mine as the sulphur strong;
 	If you get one kiss of my lips,
 	Your days would not be long.
 78D.6	Mind not ye the day, Willie,
 	Sin you and I did walk?
 	The firstand flower that we did pu
 	Was witherd on the stalk.
 78D.7	Flowers will fade and die, my dear,
 	Aye as the tears will turn;
 	And since Ive lost my own sweet-heart,
 	Ill never cease but mourn.
 78D.8	Lament nae mair for me, my love,
 	The powers we must obey;
 	But hoist up one sail to the wind,
 	Your ship must sail away.

 78[E].1	Cold blows the wind over my true love,
 	Cold blows the drops of rain;
 	I never, never had but one sweet-heart,
 	In the green wood he was slain.
 78[E.2]	But Ill do as much for my true love
 	As any young girl can do;
 	Ill sit and Ill weep by his grave-side
 	For a twelvemonth and one day.
 78[E.3]	When the twelvemonths end and one day was past,
 	This young man he arose:
 	What makes you weep by my grave-side
 	For twelve months and one day?
 78[E.4]	Only one kiss from your lily cold lips,
 	One kiss is all I crave;
 	Only one kiss from your lily cold lips,
 	And return back to your grave.
 78[E.5]	My lip is cold as the clay, sweet-heart,
 	My breath is earthly strong;
 	If you should have a kiss from my cold lip,
 	Your days will not be long.
 78[E.6]	Go fetch me a note from the dungeon dark,
 	Cold water from a stone;
 	There Ill sit and weep for my true love
 	For a twelvemonth and one day.
 78[E.7]	Go dig me a grave both long, wide and deep;
 	I will lay down in it and take one sleep,
 	For a twelvemonth and one day;
 	I will lay down in it and take a long sleep,
 	For a twelvemonth and a day.

 	And in Camvile he was slain.
 78[F.2]	Ill do as much for my true love
 	As any young girl may;
 	Ill sit and weep down by his grave
 	For twelve months and one day.
 78[F.3]	But when twelve months were come and gone,
 	This young man he arose:
 	What makes you weep down by my grave?
 	I cant take my respose.
 78[F.4]	One kiss, one kiss, of your lily-white lips,
 	One kiss is all I crave;
 	One kiss, one kiss, of your lily-white lips,

 78[F.5]	My lips they are as cold as my clay,
 	My breath is heavy and strong;
 	If thou wast to kiss my lily-white lips,
 	Thy days would not be long.
 78[F.6]	O dont you remember the garden-grove
 	Where we was used to walk?
 	Pluck the finest flower of them all,
 	Twill wither to a stalk.
 78[F.7]	Go fetch me a nut from a dungeon deep,
 	And water from a stone,
 	And white milk from a maidens breast
 	[That babe bare never none].

 78[G].1	Cold blows the wind to-day, sweetheart,
 	Cold are the drops of rain;
 	The first truelove that ever I had
 	In the green wood he was slain.
 78[G.2]	Twas down on the garden-green, sweetheart,
 	Where you and I did walk;
 	The fairest flower that in the garden grew
 	Is witherd to a stalk.
 78[G.3]	The stalk will bear no leaves, sweetheart,
 	The flowers will neer return,
 	And since my truelove is dead and gone,
 	What can I do but mourn?
 78[G.4]	A twelvemonth and a day being gone,
 	The spirit rose and spoke:
 	. . . . . . .
 	. . . . . . .
 78[G.5]	My body is clay-cold, sweetheart,
 	My breath smells heavy and strong,
 	And if you kiss my lily-white lips

 	The very first love that ever I had
 	In greenwood he was slain.
 78[Ha.2]	Ill do as much for my sweet-heart
 	As any young woman may;
 	Ill sit and mourn on his grave-side
 	A twelve-month and a day.
 78[Ha.3]	A twelve-month and a day being up,
 	The ghost began to speak:
 	Why sit you here by my grave-side
 	And will not let me sleep?
 78[Ha.4]	What is it that you want of me,
 	Or what of me would have?
 	A kiss from off your lily-white lips,
 	And that is all I crave!
 78[Ha.5]	Cold are my lips in death, sweet-heart,
 	My breath is earthy strong;
 	To gain a kiss of my cold lips,
 	Your time would not be long.
 78[Ha.6]	If you were not my own sweet-heart,
 	As now I know you be,
 	Id tear you as the withered leaves
 	That grew on yonder tree.
 78[Ha.7]	O dont you mind the garden, love,
 	Where you and I did walk?
 	The fairest flower that blossomd there
 	Is withered on the stalk.

 78[Ha.8]	And now Ive mourned upon his grave
 	A twelvemonth and a day,
 	Well set our sails before the wind
 	And so well sail away.

 78[Hb.2]	Ill do as much for my true-love
 	As any young woman may;
 	Ill sit and mourn upon his grave

 78[Hb.3]	When a twelve-month and a day were up,
 	His body straight arose:
 	What brings you weeping oer my grave
 	That I get no respose?
 78[Hb.4]	O think upon the garden, love,
 	Where you and I did walk;
 	The fairest flower that blossomd there
 	Is withered on the stalk.
 78[Hb.5]	The stalk will bear no leaves, sweet-heart,
 	The flower will neer return,
 	And my true-love is dead, is dead,
 	And i do naught but mourn.
 78[Hb.6]	What is it that you want of me
 	And will not let me sleep?
 	Your salten tears they trickle down
 	And wet my winding-sheet.

 	O what of thee in grave?
 	A kiss from off your lily-white lips,
 	And that is all I crave.

 	My breath is earthy strong;
 	If you do touch my clay-cold lips,

 	One kiss is all I crave;
 	I care not, if I kiss but thee,
 	That I should share thy grave.
 78[Hb.10]	Go fetch me a light from dungeon deep,
 	Wring water from a stone,
 	And likewise milk from a maidens breast
