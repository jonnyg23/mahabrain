 <h1 align="CENTER">50: The Bonny Hind</h1>
 <pre>
 
 50.1	O MAY she comes, and may she goes,
 	Down by yon gardens green,
 	And there she spied a gallant squire
 	As squire had ever been.
 50.2	And may she comes, and may she goes,
 	Down by yon hollin tree,
 	And there she spied a brisk young squire,
 	And a brisk young squire was he.
 50.3	Give me your green manteel, fair maid,
 	Give me your maidenhead;
 	Gif ye winna gie me your green manteel,
 	Gi me your maidenhead.
 50.4	He has taen her by the milk-white hand,
 	And softly laid her down,
 	And when hes lifted her up again
 	Given her a silver kaim.
 50.5	Perhaps there may be bairns, kind sir,
 	Perhaps there may be nane;
 	But if you be a courtier,
 	Youll tell to me your name.
 50.6	I am nae courtier, fair maid,
 	But new come frae the sea;
 	I am nae courtier, fair maid,
 	But when I courtith thee.
 50.7	They call me Jack when Im abroad,
 	Sometimes they call me John;
 	But when Im in my fathers bower
 	Jock Randal is my name.
 50.8	Ye lee, ye lee, ye bonny lad,
 	Sae louds I hear ye lee!
 	Ffor Im Lord Randals yae daughter,
 	He has nae mair nor me.
 50.9	Ye lee, ye lee, ye bonny may,
 	Sae louds I hear ye lee!
 	For Im Lord Randals yae yae son,
 	Just now come oer the sea.
 50.10	Shes putten her hand down by her spare,
 	And out shes taen a knife,
 	And she has putnt in her hearts bluid,
 	And taen away her life.
 50.11	And hes taen up his bonny sister,
 	With the big tear in his een,
 	And he has buried his bonny sister
 	Amang the hollins green.
 50.12	And syne hes hyed him oer the dale,
 	His father dear to see:
 	Sing O and O for my bonny hind,
 	Beneath yon hollin tree!
 50.13	1 What needs you care for your bonny hyn?
 	For it you needna care;
 	Theres aught score hyns in yonder park,
 	And five score hyns to spare.
 50.14	Four score of them are siller-shod,
 	Of thae ye may get three;
 	But O and O for my bonny hyn,
 	Beneath yon hollin tree!
 50.15	What needs you care for your bonny hyn?
 	For it you need na care;
 	Take you the best, gi me the warst,
 	Since plenty is to spare.
 50.16	I care na for your hyns, my lord,
 	I care na for your fee;
 	But O and O for my bonny hyn,
 	Beneath the hollin tree!
 50.17	O were ye at your sisters bower,
 	Your sister fair to see,
 	Yell think na mair o your bonny hyn
 	Beneath the hollin tree.
