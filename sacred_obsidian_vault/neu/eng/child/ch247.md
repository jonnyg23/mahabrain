 <h1 align="CENTER">247A: Lady Elspat</h1>
 <pre>
 
 247A.1	 HOW brents your brow, my Lady Elspat!
 	 How golden yallow is your hair!
 	 Of all the maids of fair Scotland,
 	 Theres nane like Lady Elspat fair.
 247A.2	 Perform your vows, Sweet William, she says,
 	 The vows which ye ha made to me,
 	 An at the back o my mothers castle
 	 This night Ill surely meet wi thee.
 247A.3	 But wae be to her brothers page,
 	 Who heard the words this twa did say!
 	 Hes told them to her lady mother,
 	 Who wrought Sweet William mieckle wae.
 247A.4	 For she has taen him Sweet William,
 	 An shes gard bind him wi his bow-string
 	 Till the red bluide o his fair body
 	 Frae ilka nail o his hand did spring.
 247A.5	 O it fell once upon a time
 	 That the Lord Justice came to town;
 	 Out has she taen him Sweet William,
 	 Brought him before Lord Justice boun.
 247A.6	 An what is the crime, now, madame, he says,
 	 Has been committed by this young man?
 	 O he has broken my bonny castel,
 	 That was well biggit with lime and stane.
 247A.7	 An he has broken my bonny coffers,
 	 That was well banded wi aiken ban,
 	 An he has stoln my rich jewels;
 	 I wot he has them every one.
 247A.8	 Then out it spake her Lady Elspat,
 	 As she sat by Lord Justice knee;
 	 Now ye hae taul your tale, mother,
 	 I pray, Lord Justice, youl now hear me.
 247A.9	 He has na broken her bonny castel,
 	 That was well biggit wi lime and stane,
 	 Nor has he stoln her rich jewels,
 	 For I wot she has them every one.
 247A.10	 But tho he was my first true love,
 	 An tho I had sworn to be his bride,
 	 Cause he had not a great estate,
 	 She would this way our loves divide.
 247A.11	 An out it spake the Lord Justice,
 	 I wot the tear was in his ee;
 	 I see nae fault in this young man,
 	 Sae loose his bans, an set him free.
 247A.12	 Take back your love, Lady Elspat,
 	 An my best blessing you baith upon!
 	 For gin he be your first true love,
 	 He is my eldest sisters son.
 247A.13	 There is a steed in my stable
 	 Cost me baith gold and white money;
 	 Yes get as mieckle o my free lan
 	 As hell ride about in a summers day.
