 <h1 align="CENTER">263A: The New-Slain Knight</h1>
 <pre>
 
 263A.1	 MY heart is lighter than the poll;
 	 My folly made me glad,
 	 As on my rambles I went out,
 	 Near by a garden-side.
 263A.2	 I walked on, and father on,
 	 Love did my heart engage;
 	 There I spied a well-faird maid,
 	 Lay sleeping near a hedge.
 263A.3	 Then I kissd her with my lips
 	 And stroked her with my hand:
 	 Win up, win up, ye well-faird maid,
 	 This day ye sleep oer lang.
 263A.4	 This dreary sight that I hae seen
 	 Unto my heart gives pain;
 	 At the south side o your fathers garden,
 	 I see a knight lies slain.
 263A.5	 O what like was his hawk, his hawk?
 	 Or what like was his hound?
 	 And what like was the trusty brand
 	 This new-slain knight had on?
 263A.6	 His hawk and hound were from him gone,
 	 His steed tied to a tree;
 	 A bloody brand beneath his head,
 	 And on the ground lies he.
 263A.7	 O what like was his hose, his hose?
 	 And what like was his shoon?
 	 And what like was the gay clothing
 	 This new-slain knight had on?
 263A.8	 His coat was of the red scarlet,
 	 His waistcoat of the same;
 	 His hose were of the bonny black,
 	 And shoon laced with cordin.
 263A.9	 Bonny was his yellow hair,
 	 For it was new combd down;
 	 Then, sighing sair, said the lady fair,
 	 I combd it late yestreen.
 263A.10	 O wha will shoe my fu fair foot?
 	 Or wha will glove my hand?
 	 Or wha will father my dear bairn,
 	 Since my loves dead and gane?
 263A.11	 O I will shoe your fu fair foot,
 	 And I will glove your hand;
 	 And Ill be father to your bairn,
 	 Since your loves dead and gane.
 263A.12	 I winna father my bairn, she said,
 	 Upon an unkent man;
 	 Ill father it on the King of Heaven,
 	 Since my loves dead and gane.
 263A.13	 The knight he knackd his white fingers,
 	 The lady tore her hair;
 	 Hes drawn the mask from off his face,
 	 Says, Lady, mourn nae mair.
 263A.14	 For ye are mine, and I am thine,
 	 I see your love is true;
 	 And if I live and brook my life
 	 Yese never hae cause to rue.
