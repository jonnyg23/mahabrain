 <h1 align="CENTER">36: The Laily Worm and the Machrel of the Sea</h1>
 <pre>
 
 36.1	I WAS but seven year auld
 	When my mither she did die;
 	My father married the ae warst woman
 	The warld did ever see.
 36.2	For she has made me the laily worm,
 	That lies at the fit o the tree,
 	An my sister Masery shes made
 	The machrel of the sea.
 36.3	An every Saturday at noon
 	The machrel comes to me,
 	An she takes my laily head
 	An lays it on her knee,
 	She kaims it wi a siller kaim,
 	An washest in the sea.
 36.4	Seven knights hae I slain,
 	Sin I lay at the fit of the tree,
 	An ye war na my ain father,
 	The eight ane ye should be.
 36.5	Sing on your song, ye laily worm,
 	That ye did sing to me:
 	I never sung that song but what
 	I would it sing to thee.
 36.6	I was but seven year auld,
 	When my mither she did die;
 	My father married the ae warst woman
 	The warld did ever see.
 36.7	For she changed me to the laily worm,
 	That lies at the fit o the tree,
 	And my sister Masery
 	To the machrel of the sea.
 36.8	And every Saturday at noon
 	The machrel comes to me,
 	An she takes my laily head
 	An lays it on her knee,
 	An kames it wi a siller kame,
 	An washes it i the sea.
 36.9	Seven knights hae I slain,
 	Sin I lay at the fit o the tree,
 	An ye war na my ain father,
 	The eighth ane ye shoud be.
 36.10	He sent for his lady,
 	As fast as send could he:
 	Whar is my son that ye sent frae me,
 	And my daughter, Lady Masery?
 36.11	Your son is at our kings court,
 	Serving for meat an fee,
 	An your daughters at our queens court,
 	. . . . . 
 36.12	Ye lie, ye ill woman,
 	Sae loud as I hear ye lie;
 	My sons the laily worm,
 	That lies at the fit o the tree,
 	And my daughter, Lady Masery,
 	Is the machrel of the sea!
 36.13	She has tane a siller wan,
 	An gien him strokes three,
 	And he has started up the bravest knight
 	That ever your eyes did see.
 36.14	She has taen a small horn,
 	An loud an shrill blew she,
 	An a the fish came her untill
 	But the proud machrel of the sea:
 	Ye shapeit me ance an unseemly shape,
 	An yes never mare shape me.
 36.15	He has sent to the wood
 	For whins and for hawthorn,
 	An he has taen that gay lady,
 	An there he did her burn.
