 <h1 align="CENTER">303A: The Holy Nunnery</h1>
 <pre>
 
 303A.1	 FAIR ANNIE had a costly bower,
 	 Well built wi lime and stane,
 	 And Willie came to visit her,
 	 Wit the light o the meen.
 303A.2	 When he came to Annies bower-door,
 	 He tirled at the pin:
 	 Ye sleep ye, wake ye, Fair Annie,
 	 Yell open, lat me come in.
 303A.3	 O never a fit, says Fair Annie,
 	 Till I your errand ken;
 	 My fathers vowed a vow, Annie,
 	 Ill tell you when Im in.
 303A.4	 My fathers vowed a rash vow,
 	 I darena marry thee;
 	 My mithers vowed anither vow,
 	 My bride yese never be.
 303A.5	 If ye had tauld me that, Willie,
 	 When we began to woo,
 	 There was naithing in this warld wide
 	 Shoud drawn my love to you.
 303A.6	 A nun, a nun, said Fair Annie,
 	 A nun will I be then;
 	 A priest, a priest, said Sweet Willie,
 	 A priest will I be syne.
 303A.7	 She is gane to her father,
 	 For mither she had nane;
 	 And she is on to her father,
 	 To see if shed be a nun.
 303A.8	 An asking, asking, father dear,
 	 An asking yell grant me;
 	 Thats to get to the holy nunnery,
 	 And there to live or die.
 303A.9	 Your askings nae sae great, daughter,
 	 But granted it shall be;
 	 For yese won to the holy nunnery,
 	 There to live or die.
 303A.10	 Then they gaed on, and farther on,
 	 Till they came to the yate;
 	 And there they spied a maiden porter,
 	 Wi gowd upon her hat.
 303A.11	 An asking, asking, maiden porter,
 	 An asking yell grant me;
 	 If Ill won to the holy nunnery,
 	 There to live or die.
 303A.12	 Your askings nae sae great, lady,
 	 But granted it shall be;
 	 For yese won to the holy nunnery,
 	 There to live or die.
 303A.13	 But ye maun vow a vow, lady,
 	 Before that ye seek in;
 	 Never to kiss a young mans mouth
 	 That goes upon the grun.
 303A.14	 And ye must vow anither vow,
 	 Severely ye must work;
 	 The well-warst vow that yere to vow,
 	 Is never to gang to kirk.
 303A.15	 I will vow a vow, she said,
 	 Before that I seek in;
 	 I neer shall kiss a young mans mouth
 	 That goes upon the grun.
 303A.16	 And I will vow anither vow,
 	 Severly I will work;
 	 The well-warst vow that Im to vow
 	 Is never to gang to kirk.
 303A.17	 For seven years now Fair Annie,
 	 In the holy nunnery lay she,
 	 And seven years Sweet Willie lay,
 	 In languish like to die.
 303A.18	 Is there nae duke no lords daughter,
 	 My son, can comfort thee,
 	 And save thee frae the gates o death?
 	 Is there nae remedie?
 303A.19	 There is nae duke nor lords daughter,
 	 Mother, can cofort me,
 	 Except it be my love, Annie,
 	 In the holy nunnery lies she.
 303A.20	 Theyve dressd Sweet Willie up in silk,
 	 Wi gowd his gown did shine,
 	 And nane coud ken by his pale face
 	 But he was a lady fine.
 303A.21	 So they gaed on, and farther on,
 	 Till they came to the yate,
 	 And there they spied a maiden porter,
 	 Wi gowd upon her hat.
 303A.22	 An asking, an asking, maiden porter,
 	 An asking yell grant me;
 	 For to win in to the holy nunnery,
 	 Fair Annie for to see.
 303A.23	 Your askings nae sae great, lady,
 	 But granted it shall be;
 	 Yese won into the holy nunnery,
 	 Fair Annie for to see.
 303A.24	 Be she dukes or lords daughter,
 	 Its lang sin she came here:
 	 Fair Annie kent her true loves face;
 	 Says, Come up, my sister dear.
 303A.25	 Sweet Willie went to kiss her lips,
 	 As he had wont to do;
 	 But she softly whispered him,
 	 I darena this avow.
