 <h1 align="CENTER">265A: The Knights Ghost</h1>
 <pre>
 
 265A.1	 THERE is a fashion in this land,
 	 And even come to this country,
 	 That every lady should meet her lord
 	 When he is newly come frae sea:
 265A.2	 Some wi hawks, and some wi hounds,
 	 And other some wi gay monie;
 	 Bit I will gae myself alone,
 	 And set his young son on his knee.
 265A.3	 Shes taen her young son in her arms,
 	 And nimbly walkd by yon sea-strand,
 	 And there she spyd her fathers ship,
 	 As she was sailing to dry land.
 265A.4	 Where hae ye put my ain gude lord,
 	 This day he stays sae far frae me?
 	 If ye be wanting your ain gude lord,
 	 A sight o him yell never see.
 265A.5	 Was he brunt? or was he shot?
 	 Or was he drowned in the sea?
 	 Or whats become o my ain gude lord,
 	 That he will neer appear to me?
 265A.6	 He wasna brunt, nor was he shot,
 	 Nor was he drowned in the sea;
 	 He was slain in Dunfermling,
 	 A fatal day to you and me.
 265A.7	 Come in, come in, my merry young men,
 	 Come in and drink the wine wi me;
 	 And a the better ye shall fare
 	 For this gude news ye tell to me.
 265A.8	 Shes brought them down to yon cellar,
 	 She brought them fifty steps and three;
 	 She birled wi them the beer and wine,
 	 Till they were as drunk as drunk could be.
 265A.9	 Then she has lockd her cellar-door,
 	 For there were fifty steps and three:
 	 Lie there, wi my sad malison,
 	 For this bad news yeve tauld to me.
 265A.10	 Shes taen the keys intill her hand
 	 And threw them deep, deep in the sea:
 	 Lie there, wi my sad malison,
 	 Till my gude lord return to me.
 265A.11	 Then she sat down in her own room,
 	 And sorrow lulld her fast asleep,
 	 And up it starts her own gude lord,
 	 And even at that ladys feet.
 265A.12	 Take here the keys, Janet, he says,
 	 That ye threw deep, deep in the sea;
 	 And yell relieve my merry young men,
 	 For theyve nane o the swick o me.
 265A.13	 They shot the shot, and drew the stroke,
 	 And wad in red bluid to the knee;
 	 Nae sailors mair for their lord coud do
 	 Nor my young men they did for me.
 265A.14	 I hae a question at you to ask,
 	 Before that ye depart frae me;
 	 Youll tell to me what day Ill die,
 	 And what day will my burial be?
 265A.15	 I hae nae mair o Gods power
 	 Than he has granted unto me;
 	 But come to heaven when ye will,
 	 There porter to you I will be.
 265A.16	 But yell be wed to a finer knight
 	 Than ever was in my degree;
 	 Unto him yell hae children nine,
 	 And six o them will be ladies free.
 265A.17	 The other three will be bold young men,
 	 To fight for king and countrie;
 	 The ane a duke, the second a knight,
 	 And third a laird o lands sae free.
