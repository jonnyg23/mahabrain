 <h1 align="CENTER">130A: Robin Hood and the Scotchman</h1>
 <pre>
 
 130A.1	 THEN bold Robin Hood to the north he would go,
 	 With a hey down down a down down
 	 With valour and mickle might,
 	 With sword by his side, which oft had been trid,
 	 To fight and recover his right.
 130A.2	 The first that he met was a bony bold Scot,
 	 His servant he said he would be;
 	 No, quoth Robin Hood, it cannot be good,
 	 For thou wilt prove false unto me.
 130A.3	 Thou hast not bin true to sire nor cuz:
 	 Nay, marry, the Scot he said,
 	 As true as your heart, Ile never part,
 	 Gude master, be not afraid.
 	 * * * * *
 130A.4	 Then Robin Hood turnd his face to the east;
 	 Fight on my merry men stout,
 	 Our cause is good, quoth brave Robin Hood,
 	 And we shall not be beaten out.
 130A.5	 The battel grows hot on every side,
 	 The Scotchman made great moan;
 	 Quoth Jockey, Gude faith, they fight on each side;
 	 Would I were with my wife Ione!
 130A.6	 The enemy compast brave Robin about,
 	 Tis long ere the battel ends;
 	 Thers neither will yeeld nor give up the field,
 	 For both are supplied with friends.
 	 * * * * *
 130A.7	 This song it was made in Robin Hoods dayes;
 	 Lets pray unto Iove above
 	 To give us true peace, that mischief may cease,
 	 And war may give place unto love.

 <h3 align="CENTER">130B: Robin Hood and the Scotchman</h3>
 <pre>
 
 130B.1	 NOW bold Robin Hood to the north would go,
 	 With valour and mickle might,
 	 With sword by his side, which oft had been tryd,
 	 To fight and recover his right.
 130B.2	 The first that he met was a jolly stout Scot,
 	 His servant he said he would be;
 	 No, quoth Robin Hood, it cannot be good,
 	 For thou wilt prove false unto me.
 130B.3	 Thou hast not been true to sire or cuz;
 	 Nay, marry, the Scot he said,
 	 As true as your heart, I never will part;
 	 Good master, be not afraid.
 130B.4	 But eer I employ you, said bold Robin Hood,
 	 With you I must have a bout;
 	 The Scotchman replyd, Let the battle be tryd,
 	 For I know I will beat you out.
 130B.5	 Thus saying, the contest did quickly begin,
 	 Which lasted two hours and more;
 	 The blows Sawney gave bold Robin so brave
 	 The battle soon made him give oer.
 130B.6	 Have mercy, thou Scotchman, bold Robin Hood cryd,
 	 Full dearly this boon have I bought;
 	 We will both agree, and my man you shall be,
 	 For a stouter I never have fought.
 130B.7	 Then Sawny consented with Robin to go,
 	 To be of his bowmen so gay;
 	 Thus ended the fight, and with mickle delight
 	 To Sherwood they hasted away.
