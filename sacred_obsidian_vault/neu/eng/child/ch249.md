 <h1 align="CENTER">249A: Auld Matrons</h1>
 <pre>
 
 249A.1	 MY love she is a gentlewoman,
 	 Has her living by the seam;
 	 I kenna how she is provided
 	 This night for me and my foot-groom.
 249A.2	 He is gane to Annies bower-door,
 	 And gently tirled at the pin:
 	 Ye sleep, ye wake, my love Annie,
 	 Yell rise and lat your true-love in.
 249A.3	 Wi her white fingers lang and sma
 	 She gently lifted up the pin;
 	 Wi her arms lang and bent
 	 She kindly caught sweet Willie in.
 249A.4	 O will ye go to cards or dice?
 	 Or will ye go to play?
 	 Or will ye go to a well made bed,
 	 And sleep a while till day?
 249A.5	 I winna gang to cards nor dice,
 	 Nor yet will I to play;
 	 But I will gang to a well made bed,
 	 And sleep a while till day.
 249A.6	 My love Annie, my dear Annie,
 	 I would be at your desire;
 	 But wae mat fa the auld Matrons,
 	 As she sits by the kitchen fire!
 249A.7	 Keep up your heart, Willie, she said,
 	 Keep up your heart, dinna fear;
 	 Its seven years, and some guid mair,
 	 Sin her foot did file the flear.
 249A.8	 They hadna kissd nor love clapped,
 	 As lovers when they meet,
 	 Till up it raise the auld Matrons,
 	 Sae wells she spread her feet.
 249A.9	 O wae mat fa the auld Matrons,
 	 Sae clevers she took the gate!
 	 And shes gaen ower yon lang, lang hill,
 	 Knockd at the sheriffs yate.
 249A.10	 Ye sleep, ye wake, my lord? she said;
 	 Are ye not your bower within?
 	 Theres knight in bed wi your daughter,
 	 I fear shes gotten wrang.
 249A.11	 Yell do ye down thro Kelso town,
 	 Waken my wall-wight men;
 	 And gin ye hae your wark well dune
 	 Ill be there at command.
 249A.12	 Shes done her down thro Kelso town,
 	 Wakend his wall-wight men;
 	 But gin she had her wark well done
 	 He was there at command.
 249A.13	 He had his horse wi corn fodderd,
 	 His men armd in mail;
 	 He gae the Matrons half a merk
 	 To show them ower the hill.
 249A.14	 Willie sleepd, but Annie waked
 	 Till she heard their bridles ring;
 	 Then tapped on her loves shoulder,
 	 And said, Yeve sleepit lang.
 249A.15	 O save me, save me, my blessd lady,
 	 Till Ive on my shooting-gear;
 	 I dinna fear the king himsell,
 	 Tho he ans men were here.
 249A.16	 Then they shot in, and Willie out,
 	 The arrows grazd his brow;
 	 The maid she wept and tore her hair,
 	 Says, This can never do.
 249A.17	 Then they shot in, and he shot out,
 	 The bow brunt Willies hand;
 	 But aye he kissd her ruby lips,
 	 Said, My dear, thinkna lang.
 249A.18	 He set his horn to his mouth,
 	 And has blawn loud and shrill,
 	 And hes calld on his brother John,
 	 In Ringlewood he lay still.
 249A.19	 The first an shot that Lord John shot,
 	 He wound fifty and fifteen;
 	 The next an shot that Lord John shot,
 	 He cad out the sheriffs een.
 249A.20	 O some o you lend me an arm,
 	 Some o you lend me twa;
 	 And they that came for strife this day,
 	 Take horse, ride fast awa.
 249A.21	 But wae mat fa yon, auld Matrons,
 	 An ill death mat ye die!
 	 Ill burn you on yon high hill-head,
 	 Blaw your ashes in the sea.
