 <h1 align="CENTER">38A: The Wee Wee Man</h1>
 <pre>
 
 38A.1	As I was walking all alone,
 	Between a water and a wa,
 	And there I spyd a wee wee man,
 	And he was the least that ere I saw.
 38A.2	His legs were scarce a shathmonts length,
 	And thick and thimber was his thigh;
 	Between his brows there was a span,
 	And between his shoulders there was three.
 38A.3	He took up a meikle stane,
 	And he flangt as far as I could see;
 	Though I had been a Wallace wight,
 	I couldna liftent to my knee.
 38A.4	O wee wee man, but thou be strang!
 	O tell me where thy dwelling be?
 	My dwellings down at yon bonny bower;
 	O will you go with me and see?
 38A.5	On we lap, and awa we rade,
 	Till we came to yon bonny green;
 	We lighted down for to bait our horse,
 	And out there came a lady fine.
 38A.6	Four and twenty at her back,
 	And they were a clad out in green;
 	Though the King of Scotland had been there,
 	The warst o them might hae been his queen.
 38A.7	On we lap, and awa we rade,
 	Till we came to yon bonny ha,
 	Whare the roof was o the beaten gould,
 	And the floor was o the cristal a.
 38A.8	When we came to the stair-foot,
 	Ladies were dancing, jimp and sma,
 	But in the twinkling of an eye,
 	My wee wee man was clean awa.

 38C.1	TWAS down by Carterhaugh, father,

 	There I met wi a wee wee man,
 	The weest man that ere I saw.
 38D.2	Thick and short was his legs,
 	And sma and thin was his thie,
 	And atween his een a flee might gae,
 	And atween his shouthers were inches three.
 38D.3	And he has tane up a muckle stane,
 	And thrown it farther than I coud see;
 	If I had been as strong as ere Wallace was,
 	I coud na lift it to my knie.
 38D.4	O, quo I, But ye be strong!
 	And O where may your dwelling be?
 	Its down in to yon bonnie glen;
 	Gin ye dinna believe, ye can come and see.

 38F.2	His legs they were na a gude inch lang,
 	And thick and nimble was his thie;
 	Between his een there was a span,
 	And between his shouthers there were ells three.
 38F.3	I asked at this wee wee mannie
 	Whare his dwelling place might be;
 	The answer that he gied to me
 	Was, Cum alang, and ye shall see.
 38F.4	So well awa, and on we rade,

 	The less o him I never saw.
 38G.2	His legs were but a finger lang,
 	And thick and nimle was his knee;
 	Between his brows there was a span,
 	Between his shoulders ells three.
 38G.3	He lifted a stane sax feet in hight,
 	He lifted it up till his right knee,
 	And fifty yards and mair, Im sure,
 	I wyte he made the stane to flee.
 38G.4	O little wee man, but ye be wight!
 	Tell me whar your dwelling be;
 	I hae a bower, compactly built,
 	Madam, gin yell cum and see.
 38G.5	Sae on we lap, and awa we rade,
 	Till we come to yon little ha;
 	The kipples ware o the gude red gowd,
 	The reef was o the proseyla.
 38G.6	Pipers were playing, ladies dancing,
 	The ladies dancing, jimp and sma;
 	At ilka turning o the spring,
 	The little man was wearins wa.
 38G.7	Out gat the lights, on cam the mist,
 	Ladies nor mannie mair coud see
 	I turnd about, and gae a look,
 	Just at the foot o Benachie.
