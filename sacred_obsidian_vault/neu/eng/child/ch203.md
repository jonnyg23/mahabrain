 <pre>
 
 203A.1	 Inverey cam doun Deeside, whistlin and playin,
 	 He was at brave Braikleys yett ere it was dawin.
 203A.2	 He rappit fu loudly and wi a great roar,
 	 Cried, Cum doun, cum doun, Braikley, and open the door.
 203A.3	 Are ye sleeping, Baronne, or are ye wakin?
 	 Thers sharpe swords at your yett, will gar your blood spin.
 203A.4	 Open the yett, Braikley, and lat us within,
 	 Till we on the green turf gar your bluid rin.
 203A.5	 Out spak the brave baronne, owre the castell-wa:
 	 Are ye cum to spulyie and plunder mi ha?
 203A.6	 But gin ye be gentlemen, licht and cum in:
 	 Gin ye drink o my wine, yell nae gar my bluid spin.
 203A.7	 Gin ye be hird widifus, ye may gang by,
 	 Ye may gang to the lawlands and steal their fat ky.
 203A.8	 Ther spulyie like rievers o wyld kettrin clan,
 	 Who plunder unsparing baith houses and lan.
 203A.9	 Gin ye be gentlemen, licht an cum [in],
 	 Thers meat an drink i my ha for every man.
 203A.10	 Gin ye bird widifus, ye may gang by,
 	 Gang doun to the lawlands, and steal horse and ky.
 203A.11	 Up spak his ladie, at his bak where she lay,
 	 Get up, get up, Braikley, and be not afraid;
 	 Ther but young hird widifus wi belted plaids.
 203A.12	 Cum kiss me, mi Peggy, Ile nae langer stay,
 	 For I will go out and meet Inverey.
 203A.13	 But haud your tongue, Peggy, and mak nae sic din,
 	 For yon same hird widifus will prove themselves men.
 203A.14	 She called on her marys, they cam to her hand;
 	 Cries, Bring me your rocks, lassies, we will them command.
 203A.15	 Get up, get up, Braikley, and turn bak your ky,
 	 Or me an mi women will them defy.
 203A.16	 Cum forth then, mi maidens, and show them some play;
 	 Well ficht them, and shortly the cowards will fly.
 203A.17	 Gin I had a husband, whereas I hae nane,
 	 He woud nae ly i his bed and see his ky taen.
 203A.18	 Thers four-and-twenty milk-whit calv5s, tw1l o them ky,
 	 In the woods o Glentanner, its ther thei a ly.
 203A.19	 Thers goat i the Etnach, and sheep o the brae,
 	 An a will be plunderd by young Inverey.
 203A.20	 Now haud your tongue, Peggy, and gie me a gun,
 	 Yell see me gae furth, but Ill never cum in.
 203A.21	 Call mi brother William, mi unkl also,
 	 Mi cousin James Gordon; well mount and well go.
 203A.22	 When Braikley was ready and stood i the closs,
 	 He was the bravest baronne that eer mounted horse.
 203A.23	 Whan all wer assembld o the castell green,
 	 No man like brave Braikley was ther to be seen
 203A.24	 . . . . .
 	 Turn bak, brother William, ye are a bridegroom;
 203A.25	 Wi bonnie Jean Gordon, the maid o the mill;
 	 O sichin and sobbin shell soon get her fill.
 203A.26	 Im no coward, brother, tis kend Im a man;
 	 Ill ficht i your quarral as langs I can stand.
 203A.27	 Ill ficht, my dear brother, wi heart and gude will,
 	 And so will young Harry that lives at the mill.
 203A.28	 But turn, mi dear brother, and nae langer stay:
 	 Whatll cum o your ladie, gin Braikley thei slay?
 203A.29	 Whatll cum o your ladie and bonnie young son?
 	 O whatll cum o them when Braikley is gone?
 203A.30	 I never will turn: do you think I will fly?
 	 But here I will ficht, and here I will die.
 203A.31	 Strik dogs, crys Inverey, a+end ficht till yere slayn,
 	 For we are four hundered, ye are but four men.
 203A.32	 Strik, strik, ye proud boaster, your honour is gone,
 	 Your lands we will plunder, your castell well burn.
 203A.33	 At the head o the Etnach the battel began,
 	 At Little Auchoilzie thei killd the first man.
 203A.34	 First thei killd ane, and soon they killd twa,
 	 Thei killd gallant Braikley, the flour o them a.
 203A.35	 Thei killd William Gordon, and James o the Knox,
 	 And brave Alexander, the flour o Glenmuick.
 203A.36	 What sichin and moaning was heard i the glen,
 	 For the Baronne o Braikley, who basely was slayn!
 203A.37	 Cam ye bi the castell, and was ye in there?
 	 Saw ye pretty Peggy tearing her hair?
 203A.38	 Yes, I cam by Braikley, and I gaed in there,
 	 And there [saw] his ladie braiding her hair.
 203A.39	 She was rantin, and dancin, and singin for joy,
 	 And vowin that nicht she woud feest Inverey.
 203A.40	 She eat wi him, drank wi him, welcomd him in,
 	 Was kind to the man that had slayn her baronne.
 203A.41	 Up spake the son on the nourices knee,
 	 Gin I live to be a man, revenged Ill be.
 203A.42	 Thers dool i the kitchin, and mirth i the ha,
 	 The Baronne o Braikley is dead and awa.

 	 Hes landed at Braiklys yates at the day dawing.
 203C.2	 Says, Baron of Braikly, are ye within?
