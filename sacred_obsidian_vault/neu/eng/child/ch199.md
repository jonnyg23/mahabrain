 <h1 align="CENTER">199A: Bonnie House o Airlie</h1>
 <pre>
 
 199A.1	 IT fell on a day, and a bonny simmer day,
 	 When green grew aits and barley,
 	 That there fell out a great dispute
 	 Between Argyll and Airlie.
 199A.2	 Argyll has raised an hunder men,
 	 An hunder harnessd rarely,
 	 And hes awa by the back of Dunkell,
 	 To plunder the castle of Airlie.
 199A.3	 Lady Ogilvie looks oer her bower-window.
 	 And oh, but she looks weary!
 	 And there she spyd the great Argyll,
 	 Come to plunder the bonny house of Airlie.
 199A.4	 Come down, come down, my Lady Ogilvie,
 	 Come down, and kiss me fairly:
 	 O I winna kiss the fause Argyll,
 	 If he should na leave a standing stane in Airlie.
 199A.5	 He hath taken her by the left shoulder,
 	 Says, Dame where lies thy dowry?
 	 O its east and west yon wan water side,
 	 And its down by the banks of the Airlie.
 199A.6	 They hae sought it up, they hae sought it down,
 	 They hae sought it maist severely,
 	 Till they fand it in the fair plumb-tree
 	 That shines on the bowling-green of Airlie.
 199A.7	 He hath taken her by the middle sae small,
 	 And O but she grat sairly!
 	 And laid her down by the bonny burn-side,
 	 Till they plundered the castle of Airlie.
 199A.8	 Gif my gude lord war here this night,
 	 As he is with King Charlie,
 	 Neither you, nor ony ither Scottish lord,
 	 Durst avow to the plundering of Airlie.
 199A.9	 Gif my gude lord war now at hame,
 	 As he is with his king,
 	 There durst nae a Campbell in a Argyll
 	 Set fit on Airlie green.
 199A.10	 Ten bonny sons I have born unto him,
 	 The eleventh neer saw his daddy;
 	 But though I had an hundred mair,
 	 Id gie them a to King Charlie.

 199B.1	 IT fell on a day, a clear summer day,
 	 When the corn grew green and bonny,
 	 That there was a combat did fall out
 	 Tween Argyle and the bonny house of Airly.
 199B.2	 Argyle he did raise five hundred men,
 	 Five hundred men, so many,
 	 And he did place them by Dunkeld,
 	 Bade them shoot at the bonny house of Airly.

 	 And oh, but she looked weary!
 	 And there she espied the gleyed Argyle,
 	 Come to plunder the bonny house of Airly.
 199B.4	 Come down the stair now, Madam Ogilvie,
 	 And let me kiss thee kindly;
 	 Or I vow and I swear, by the sword that I wear,
 	 That I winna leave a standing stone at Airly.
 199B.5	 O how can I come down the stair,
 	 And how can I kiss thee kindly,
 	 Since you vow and you swear, by the sword that you wear,
 	 That you winna leave a standing stone on Airly?
 199B.6	 Come down the stair then, Madam Ogilvie,
 	 And let me see thy dowry;
 	 O tis east and it is west, and tis down by yon burn-side,
 	 And it stands at the planting sae bonny.
 199B.7	 But if my brave lord had been at hame this day,
 	 As he is wi Prince Charlie,
 	 There durst na a Campbell in all Scotland
 	 Set a foot on the bowling-green of Airly
 199B.8	 O I hae born him seven, seven sons,
 	 And an eighth neer saw his daddy,
 	 And tho I were to bear him as many more,
 	 They should a carry arms for Prince Charlie.

 	 And not to keep his men at hame,
 	 But to come and plunder bonnie Airly.
 199D.3	 The lady was looking oer her castle-wa,
 	 She was carrying her courage sae rarely,
 	 And there she spied him gleyd Arguill,
 	 Was coming for to plunder bonnie Airly.
 199D.4	 Wae be to ye, gleyd Argyll!
 	 And are ye there sae rarely?
 	 Ye might hae kept your men at hame,
 	 And not come to plunder bonnie Airly.
 199D.5	 And wae be to ye, Lady Ogilvie!
 	 And are ye there sae rarely?
 	 Gin ye had bowed when first I bade,
 	 I never wad hae plunderd bonnie Airly.
 199D.6	 But gin my guid lord had been at hame,
 	 As he is wi Prince Charlie,
 	 There durst not a rebel on a Scotch ground
 	 Set a foot on the bonnie green of Airly.
 199D.7	 But yell tak me by the milk-white hand,
 	 And yell lift me up sae rarely,
 	 And yell throw me outoure my [ain] castle-wa,
 	 Let me neuer see the plundering of Airly.
 199D.8	 Hes taen her by the milk-white hand,
 	 And hes lifted her up sae rarely,
 	 And hes thrown her outoure her ain castle-wa,
 	 And she neuer saw the plundering of Airly.
 199D.9	 Now gleyd Argyll he has gane hame,
 	 Awa frae the plundering of Airly,
 	 And there he has met him Captain Ogilvie,
 	 Coming over the mountains sae rarely.
 199D.10	 O wae be to ye, gleyd Argyll!
 	 And are you there sae rarely?
 	 Ye might hae kept your men at hame,
 	 And no gane to plunder bonnie Airly.

 	 And are you there sae rarely?
 	 Gin ye wad hae bowed when first I bade,
 	 I neer wad hae plunderd bonnie Airly.
