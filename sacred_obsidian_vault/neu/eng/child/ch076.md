 <h1 align="CENTER">76A: The Lass of Roch Royal</h1>
 <pre>
 
 76A.1	FAIR ISABELL of Rochroyall,
 	She dreamed where she lay,
 	She dreamd a dream of her love Gregory,
 	A litle before the day.
 76A.2	O huly, huly rose she up,
 	And huly she put on,
 	And huly, huly she put on
 	The silks of crimsion.
 76A.3	Gar sadle me the black, she sayes,
 	Gar sadle me the broun;
 	Gar sadle me the swiftest steed
 	That ever rode the toun.
 76A.4	Gar shoe him with the beat silver,
 	And grind him with the gold;
 	Gar put two bells on every side,
 	Till I come to some hold.
 76A.5	She had not rode a mile, a mile,
 	A mile but barely three,
 	Till that she spyed a companie
 	Come rakeing oere the lee.
 76A.6	O whether is this the first young may,
 	That lighted and gaed in;
 	Or is this the second young may,
 	That neer the sun shined on?
 	Or is this Fair Isabell of Roch Royall,
 	Banisht from kyth and kin.
 76A.7	O I am not the first young may,
 	That lighted and gaed in;
 	Nor neither am I the second young may,
 	That neer the sun shone on;
 76A.8	But Im Fair Isabell of Roch Royall
 	Banisht from kyth and kin;
 	Im seeking my true-love Gregory,
 	And I woud I had him in.
 76A.9	O go your way to yon castle,
 	And ride it round about,
 	And there youll find Love Gregory;
 	Hes within, without any doubt.
 76A.10	O shes away to yon castle,
 	Shes tirled at the pin:
 	O open, open, Love Gregory,
 	And let your true-love in.
 76A.11	If you be the lass of the Rochroyall,
 	As I trow not you be,
 	You will tell me some of our love-tokens,
 	That was betwixt you and me.
 76A.12	Have you not mind, Love Gregory,
 	Since we sat at the wine;
 	When we changed the rings off our fingers,
 	And ay the worst fell mine?
 76A.13	Mine was of the massy gold,
 	And thine was of the tin;
 	Mine was true and trusty both,
 	And thine was false within.
 76A.14	If you be [the] lass of the Roch Royall,
 	As I trow not you be,
 	You will tell me some other love-token
 	That was betwixt you and me.
 76A.15	Have you not mind, Love Gregory,
 	Since we sat at the wine,
 	We changed the smocks off our two backs,
 	And ay the worst fell mine?
 76A.16	Mine was of the holland fine,
 	And thine was course and thin;
 	So many blocks have we two made,
 	And ay the worst was mine.
 76A.17	Love Gregory, he is not at home,
 	But he is to the sea;
 	If you have any word to him,
 	I pray you leavet with me.
 	* * * * *
 76A.18	O who will shoe my bony foot?
 	Or who will glove my hand?
 	Or who will bind my midle jimp
 	With the broad lilly band?
 76A.19	Or who will comb my bony head
 	With the red river comb?
 	Or who will be my bairns father
 	Ere Gregory he come home?
 76A.20	O Is gar shoe thy bony foot,
 	And Is gar glove thy hand,
 	And Is gar bind thy midle jimp
 	With the broad lilly band.
 76A.21	And Is gar comb thy bony head
 	With the red river comb;
 	But there is none to be thy bairns father
 	Till Love Gregory he come home.
 76A.22	Ill set my foot on the ship-board,
 	God send me wind and more!
 	For theres never a woman shall bear a son
 	Shall make my heart so sore.
 76A.23	I dreamed a dream now since yestreen,
 	That I never dreamed before;
 	I dreamd that the lass of the Rochroyall
 	Was knocking at the door.
 76A.24	Ly still, ly still, my   dear son,
 	Ly still, and take a sleep;
 	For its neither ane hour, nor yet a half,
 	Since she went from the gate.
 76A.25	O wo be to you, ill woman,
 	And ane ill death mott you die!
 	For you might have come to my bed-side,
 	And then have wakened me.
 76A.26	Gar sadle me the black, he sayes,
 	Gar sadle me the broun;
 	Gar sadle me the swiftest steed
 	That ever rode the toun.
 76A.27	Gar shoe him with the beat silver,
 	Gar grind him with the gold;
 	Cause put two bells on every side,
 	Till I come to some hold.
 76A.28	They sadled him the black, the black,
 	So did they him the broun;
 	So did they him the swiftest steed
 	That ever rode to toun.
 76A.29	They shoed him with the beat silver,
 	They grind him with the gold;
 	They put two bells on every side,
 	Till he came to some hold.
 76A.30	He had not rode a mile, a mile,
 	A mile but barely three,
 	Till that he spyed her comely corps
 	Come raking oere the lee.
 76A.31	Set doun, set doun these comely corps,
 	Let me look on the dead:
 	And out hes taen his little pen-knife,
 	And slitted her winding sheet.
 76A.32	And first he kist her cheek, her cheek,
 	And then he kist her chin;
 	And then he kist her rosy lips,
 	But there was no breath within.
 76A.33	Gar deall, gar deall for my love sake
 	The spiced bread and the wine;
 	For ere the morn at this time
 	So shall you deall for mine.
 76A.34	Gar deall, gar deall for my love sake
 	The pennys that are so small;
 	For ere the morn at this time,
 	So shall you deall for all.
 76A.35	The one was buried in Mary kirk,
 	The other in Mary quire;
 	Out of the one there sprung a birk,
 	Out of the other a bryar;
 	So thus you may well know by that
 	They were two lovers dear.

 76B.1	O WHA will shoe thy bonny feet?
 	Or wha will glove thy hand?
 	Or wha will lace thy midle jimp,
 	With a lang, lang London whang?
 76B.2	And wha will kame thy bonny head,
 	With a tabean brirben kame?
 	And wha will be my bairns father,
 	Till Love Gregory come hame?
 76B.3	Thy fatherll shoe his bonny feet,
 	Thy mitherll glove his hand;
 	Thy brither will lace his middle jimp,
 	With a lang, lang London whang.
 76B.4	Mysel will kame his bonny head,
 	With a tabean brirben kame;
 	And the Lord will be the bairns father,
 	Till Love Gregory come hame.
 76B.5	Then shes gart build a bonny ship,
 	Its a cored oer with pearl,
 	And at every needle-tack was int
 	There hang a siller bell.
 76B.6	And shes awa . . .
 	To sail upon the sea;
 	Shes gane to seek Love Gregory,
 	In lands whereer he be.
 76B.7	She hadna saild a league but twa,
 	O scantly had she three,
 	Till she met with a rude rover,
 	Was sailing on the sea.
 76B.8	O whether is thou the Queen hersel,
 	Or ane o her maries three?
 	Or is thou the lass of Lochroyan,
 	Seeking Love Gregory?
 76B.9	O I am not the Queen hersell,
 	Nor ane o her maries three;
 	But I am the lass o Lochroyan,
 	Seeking Love Gregory.
 76B.10	O sees na thou yone bonny bower?
 	Its a cored oer with tin;
 	When thou hast saild it round about,
 	Love Gregory is within.
 76B.11	When she had saild it round about,
 	She tirled at the pin:
 	O open, open, Love Gregory,
 	Open, and let me in!
 	For I am the lass of Lochroyan,
 	Banisht frae a my kin.
 76B.12	If thou be the lass of Lochroyan,
 	As I know no thou be,
 	Tell me some of the true tokens
 	That past between me and thee.
 76B.13	Hast thou na mind, Love Gregory,
 	As we sat at the wine,
 	We changed the rings aff ithers hands,
 	And ay the best was mine?
 76B.14	For mine was o the gude red gould,
 	But thine was o the tin;
 	And mine was true and trusty baith,
 	But thine was fase within.
 76B.15	If thou be the lass of Lochroyan,
 	As I know na thou be,
 	Tell me some mair o the true tokens
 	Past between me and thee.
 76B.16	And has na thou na mind, Love Gregory,
 	As we sat on yon hill,
 	Thou twind me of my [maidenhead,]
 	Right sair against my will?
 76B.17	Now open, open, Love Gregory,
 	Open, and let me in!
 	For the rain rains on my gude cleading,
 	And the dew stands on my chin.
 76B.18	Then she has turnd her round about:
 	Well, since that it be sae,
 	Let never woman that has born a son
 	Hae a heart sae full of wae.
 76B.19	Take down, take down that mast o gould,
 	Set up a mast of tree;
 	For it dinna become a forsaken lady
 	To sail so royallie.
 76B.20	I dreamt a dream this night, mother,
 	I wish it may prove true,
 	That the bonny lass of Lochroyan
 	Was at the gate just now.
 76B.21	Lie still, lie still, my only son,
 	And sound sleep mayst thou get,
 	For its but an hour or little mair
 	Since she was at the gate.
 76B.22	Awa, awa, ye wicket woman,
 	And an ill dead may ye die!
 	Ye might have ither letten her in,
 	Or else have wakened me.
 76B.23	Gar saddle to me the black, he said,
 	Gar saddle to me the brown;
 	Gar saddle to me the swiftest steed
 	That is in a the town.
 76B.24	Now the first town that he cam to,
 	The bells were ringing there;
 	And the neist toun that he cam to,
 	Her corps was coming there.
 76B.25	Set down, set down that comely corp,
 	Set down, and let me see
 	Gin that be the lass of Lochroyan,
 	That died for love o me.
 76B.26	And he took out the little penknife
 	That hang down by his gare,
 	And hes rippd up her winding-sheet,
 	A lang claith-yard and mair.
 76B.27	And first he kist her cherry cheek,
 	And syne he kist her chin,
 	And neist he kist her rosy lips;
 	There was nae breath within.
 76B.28	And he has taen his little penknife,
 	With a heart that was fou sair,
 	He has given himself a deadly wound,
 	And word spake never mair.

 76C.1	* * * *
 	SHE sailed west, she sailed east,
 	She sailed mony a mile,
 	Until she cam to Lord Gregors yett,
 	And she tirled at the pin.
 76C.2	Its open, open, Lord Gregory,
 	Open, and let me in;
 	For the rain drops on my gouden hair,
 	And drops upon your son.
 76C.3	Are you the Queen of Queensberry?
 	Or one of the marys three?
 	Or are you the lass of Ruchlaw hill,
 	Seeking Lord Gregory?
 76C.4	Im not the Queen of Queensberry,
 	Nor one of the marys three;
 	But I am the bonny lass of Ruchlawhill,
 	Seeking Lord Gregory.
 76C.5	Awa, awa, ye fause thief,
 	I will not open to thee
 	Till you tell me the first token
 	That was tween you and me.
 76C.6	Do not you mind, Lord Gregory,
 	When we birled at the wine,
 	We changed the rings of our fingers,
 	And ay the best was mine?
 76C.7	For mine was true and trusty goud,
 	But yours it was of tin;
 	Mine was of the true and trusty goud,
 	But yours was fause within.
 76C.8	She turned about her bonny ship,
 	Awa then did she sail:
 	The sun shall never shine on man
 	That made my heart so sare.
 76C.9	Then up the old mother she got,
 	And wakened Lord Gregory:
 	Awa, awa, ye fause gudeson,
 	A limmer was seeking thee.
 76C.10	Its woe be to you, witch-mother,
 	An ill death may you die!
 	For you might hae set the yet open,
 	And then hae wakened me.
 76C.11	Its up he got, and put on his clothes,
 	And to the yet he ran;
 	The first sight of the ship he saw,
 	He whistled and he sang.
 76C.12	But whan the bonny ship was out o sight,
 	He clapped his hands and ran,
 	. . . . .
 	. . . . .
 76C.13	The first kirktoun he cam to,
 	He heard the death-bell ring,
 	The second kirktoun he cam to,
 	He saw her corpse come in.
 76C.14	Set down, set down this bonny corpse,
 	That I may look upon;
 	If she died late for me last night,
 	Ill die for her the morn.
 76C.15	Be merry, merry, gentlemen,
 	Be merry at the bread and wine;
 	For by the morn at this time o day
 	Youll drink as much at mine.
 76C.16	The one was buried in Marys isle,
 	The other in Marys quire;
 	Out of the one there grew a thorn,
 	And out of the other a brier.
 76C.17	And aye they grew, and aye they blew,
 	Till their twa taps did meet;
 	And every one that passed thereby
 	Might see they were lovers sweet.

 76D.4	Her brother kembd her yallow hair,

 76D.7	She had na been o the sea saillin

 76D.14	O dinna ye mind, Love Gregor, she says,
 	Whan we sat at the wine,
 	How we changed the napkins frae our necks,
 	Its na sae lang sin syne?
 76D.15	An yours was good, an good enough,
 	But nae sae good as mine;
 	For yours was o the cumbruk clear,
 	But mine was silk sae fine.

 	But mine o the diamonds fine.
 76D.18	Sae open the door now, Love Gregor,
 	An open it wi speed,
 	Or your young son that is in my arms
 	For cauld will soon be dead.
 76D.19	Awa, awa, you ill woman,

 76D.20	O hae you gotten another fair love,
 	For a the oaths you sware?
 	Then fair you well now, fase Gregor,
 	For me yous never see mair.
 76D.21	O heely, heely gid she back,
 	As the day began to peep;
 	She set her foot on good ship-board,
 	An sair, sair did she weep.
 76D.22	Love Gregor started frae his sleep,
 	An to his mither did say,
 	I dreamd a dream this night, mither,
 	That maks my heart right wae.
 76D.23	I dreamd that Anny of Roch-royal,
 	The flowr o a her kin,
 	Was standin mournin at my door,
 	But nane would lat her in.
 76D.24	O there was a woman stood at the door,
 	Wi a bairn intill her arms,
 	But I woud na lat her within the bowr,
 	For fear she had done you harm.

 	But ay the langer that he cried Anny,
 	The higher roard the tide.
 76D.28	The win grew loud, an the sea grew rough,
 	An the ship was rent in twain,
 	An soon he saw her Fair Anny
 	Come floating oer the main.
 76D.29	He saw his young son in her arms,
 	Baith tossd aboon the tide;
 	He wrang his hands, than fast he ran,
 	An plungd i the sea sae wide.
 76D.30	He catchd her by the yallow hair,
 	An drew her to the strand,
 	But cauld an stiff was every limb
 	Before he reachd the land.
 76D.31	O first he kissd her cherry cheek,
 	An then he kissd her chin;
 	An sair he kissd her ruby lips,
 	But there was nae breath within.
 76D.32	O he has mournd oer Fair Anny
 	Till the sun was gaing down,
 	Then wi a sigh his heart it brast,
 	An his soul to heaven has flown.

 	The louder roard the sea.
 76E.24	The wind blew loud, the sea grew rough,
 	And dashd the boat on shore;
 	Fair Annie floats on the raging sea,
 	But her young son raise no more.
 76E.25	Love Gregor tare his yellow hair,
 	And made a heavy moan;
 	Fair Annies corpse lay at his feet,
 	But his bonny young son was gone.
 76E.26	O cherry, cherry was her cheek,
 	And gowden was her hair,
 	But clay cold were her rosey lips,
 	Nae spark of life was there.
 76E.27	And first hes kissd her cherry cheek,
 	And neist hes kissed her chin;
 	And saftly pressd her rosey lips,
 	But there was nae breath within.
 76E.28	O wae betide my cruel mother,
 	And an ill dead may she die!
 	For she turnd my true-love frae my door,
 	When she came sae far to me.
