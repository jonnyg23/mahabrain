 <h1 align="CENTER">202A: The Battle of Philiphaugh</h1>
 <pre>
 
 202A.1	 ON Philiphaugh a fray began,
 	 At Hairheadwood it ended;
 	 The Scots outoer the Gra+emes they ran,
 	 Sae merrily they bended.
 202A.2	 Sir David frae the Border came,
 	 Wi heart an hand came he;
 	 Wi him three thousand bonny Scots,
 	 To bear him company.
 202A.3	 Wi him three thousand valiant men,
 	 A noble sight to see!
 	 A cloud o mist them weel conceald,
 	 As close as eer might be.
 202A.4	 When they came to the Shaw burn,
 	 Said he, Sae weel we frame,
 	 I think it is convenient
 	 That we should sing a psalm.
 202A.5	 When they came to the Lingly burn,
 	 As daylight did appear,
 	 They spyd an aged father,
 	 And he did draw them near.
 202A.6	 Come hither, aged father,
 	 Sir David he did cry,
 	 And tell me where Montrose lies,
 	 With al his great army.
 202A.7	 But first you must come tell to me,
 	 If friends or foes you be;
 	 I fear you are Montroses men,
 	 Come frae the north country.
 202A.8	 No, we are nane o Montroses men,
 	 Nor eer intend to be;
 	 I am Sir David Lesly,
 	 Thats speaking unto thee.
 202A.9	 "[If youre Sir David Lesly,
 	 As I think weel ye be,
 	 I am sorry ye hae brought so few
 	 Into your company.
 202A.10	 Theres fifteen thousand armed men
 	 Encamped on yon lee;
 	 Yell never be a bite to them,
 	 For aught that I can see.
 202A.11	 But halve your men in equal parts,
 	 Your purpose to fulfill;
 	 Let ae half keep the water-side,
 	 The rest gae round the hill.
 202A.12	 Your nether party fire must,
 	 Then beat a flying drum;
 	 And then theyll think the days their ain,
 	 And frae the trench theyll come.
 202A.13	 Then, those that are behind them maun
 	 Gie shot, baith grit and sma;
 	 And so, between your armies twa,
 	 Ye may make them to fa.
 202A.14	 O were ye ever a soldier?
 	 Sir David Lesly said;
 	 O yes; I was at Solway Flow,
 	 Where we were all betrayd.
 202A.15	 Again I was at curst Dunbar,
 	 And was a prisner taen,
 	 And many weary night and day
 	 In prison I hae lien.
 202A.16	 If ye will lead these men aright,
 	 Rewarded shal ye be;
 	 But, if that ye a traitor prove,
 	 Ill hang thee on a tree.
 202A.17	 Sir, I will not a traitor prove;
 	 Montrose has plunderd me;
 	 Ill do my best to banish him
 	 Away frae this country.
 202A.18	 He halvd his men in equal parts,
 	 His purpose to fulfill;
 	 The one part kept the water-side,
 	 The other gaed round the hill.
 202A.19	 The nether party fired brisk,
 	 Then turnd and seemd to rin;
 	 And then they a came frae the trench,
 	 And cryd The days our ain!
 202A.20	 The rest then ran into the trench,
 	 And loosd their cannons a:
 	 And thus, between his armies twa,
 	 He made them fast to fa.
 202A.21	 Now let us a for Lesly pray
 	 And his brave company,
 	 For they hae vanquishd great Montrose,
 	 Our cruel enemy.
