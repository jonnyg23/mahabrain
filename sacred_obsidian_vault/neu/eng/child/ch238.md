 <h3 align="CENTER">238E: Glenlogie or Jean o Bethalnie</h3>
 <pre>
 
 238E.1	 THERE were four-and-twenty ladies dined i the Queens ha,
 	 And Jean o Bethelnie was the flower o them a.
 238E.2	 Four-and-twenty gentlemen rode thro Banchory fair,
 	 But bonny Glenlogie was the flower that was there.
 238E.3	 Young Jean at a window she chanced to sit nigh,
 	 And upon Glenlogie she fixed an eye.
 238E.4	 She calld on his best man, unto him did say,
 	 O what is that knights name? or where does he stay?
 238E.5	 Hes of the noble Gordons, of great birth and fame;
 	 He stays at Glenlogie, Sir George is his name.
 238E.6	 Then she wrote a broad letter, and wrote it in haste;
 	 To send it Glenlogie, she thought it was best.
 238E.7	 Says, O brave Glenlogie, unto me be kind;
 	 Ive laid my love on you, and told you my mind.
 238E.8	 Then reading the letter, as he stood on the green,
 	 Says, I leave you to judge, sirs; what does women mean?
 238E.9	 Then turnd about sprightly, as the Gordons do a:
 	 Lay not your love on me, Im promisd awa.
 238E.10	 When she heard this answer, her heart was like to break,
 	 That she laid her love on him, and him so ungrate.
 238E.11	 Then she calld on her maidens to lay her to bed,
 	 And take her fine jewels and lay them aside.
 238E.12	 My seals and my signets, no more shall I crave;
 	 But linen and trappin, a chest and a grave.
 238E.13	 Her father stood by her, possess d with fear,
 	 To see his dear daughter, possess d with care.
 238E.14	 Says, Hold your tongue, Jeannie, let all your folly be;
 	 Ill wed you to Dumfedline, he is better than he.
 238E.15	 O hold your tongue, father, and let me alane;
 	 If I getna Glenlogie, Ill never have ane.
 238E.16	 His bonny jimp middle, his black rolling eye,
 	 If I getna Glenlogie, Im sure I shall die.
 238E.17	 But her fathers old chaplain, a man of great skill,
 	 He wrote a broad letter, and penned it well.
 238E.18	 Saying, O brave Glenlogie, why must it be so?
 	 A maids love laid on you, shall she die in her woe?
 238E.19	 Then reading the letter, his heart was like to break
 	 That such a leal virgin should die for his sake.
 238E.20	 Then he calld on his footman, and likewise his groom,
 	 Says, Get my horse saddled and bridl d soon.
 238E.21	 Before the horse was saddled and brought to the yate,
 	 Bonnie Glenlogie was five miles on foot.
 238E.22	 When he came to Bethelnie, he saw nothing there
 	 But weeping and wailing, vexation and care.
 238E.23	 Then out spake her father, with the tear in his ee,
 	 Youre welcome, Glenlogie, youre welcome to me.
 238E.24	 If ye make me welcome, as welcomes ye say,
 	 Yell show me the chamber where Jeannie does lay.
 238E.25	 Then one o her maidens took him by the hand,
 	 To show him the chamber where Jeannie lay in.
 238E.26	 Before that she saw him, she was pale and wan;
 	 But when she did see him, she grew ruddy again.
 238E.27	 O turn, bonny Jeannie, turn you to your side;
 	 For Ill be the bridegroom, and yell be the bride.
 238E.28	 When Jeannie was married, her tocher down tauld,
 	 Bonny Jean o Bethelnie was fifteen years auld.

 238F.1	 FOURSCORE nobles ride in the kings court,
 	 And bonny Earl Ogies the flower of the rout;
 	 Fourscore lean oer the castle-wa,
 	 But Jean of Bethelnies the flower of em a.
 238F.2	 She writ a broad letter, and pennd it fou lang,
 	 And sent it Earl Ogie as fast as t can gang:
 	 Bonny Earl Ogie, be courteous and kind;
 	 Ive laid my love on thee; maun I die in my prime?
 238F.3	 O pox on thee, Jenny, for being sae slaw!
 	 Bonny Earl Ogie is promisd awa:
 	 This letter was like to mak her heart break,
 	 For revealing her mind to a man so ingrate.
 238F.4	 Come here, all my handmaids, O do this with speed,
 	 Take my gowns and my passments, and lay me to bed;
 	 Lay me to bed, it is all that I crave;
 	 Wi my sark in my coffin, lay me in my grave.
 238F.5	 Her father beheld her with heart full of grief,
 	 And spoke these words to her, to gi her relief:
 	 Hawd your tongue, Jenny, your mourning let be,
 	 You shall have drumfinely, whos as good as he.
 238F.6	 Haud your tongue, father, your words make me sad;
 	 If I get not Earl Ogie, I still shall be bad;
 	 With his bonny streight body, and black rolling eee,
 	 If I get not Earl Ogie, for him I mun dee.
 238F.7	 Her father, kings chaplain, and one of great skill,
 	 Did write a broad letter, and pennd it fou weel;
 	 He as writ a broad letter, and pennd it fou lang,
 	 And sent it Earl Ogie as fast as t can gang.
 238F.8	 Bonny Earl Ogie, be courteous and kind;
 	 My daughter loves you; must she die in her prime?
 	 When he read the first lines, a loud laugh gave he;
 	 But or he redd the middle, the tear filld his ee,
 238F.9	 Come here, all my footmen, and also my groom,
 	 Go saddle my horses, and saddle them soon:
 	 They were not weel saddled and set on the green
 	 Or bonny Earl Ogie was twa mile his lain.
 238F.10	 When he came to Bethelnie, he nothing saw there
 	 But mourning and weeping, lamentation and care:
 	 O you thats her handmaid, take me by the hand,
 	 Lead me to the chamber that Jenny lies in.
 238F.11	 When thither he came, she was pale and half dead;
 	 As soon as she saw him, her cheeks they grew red:
 	 Come, turn thee, my Jenny, come, turn on thy side,
 	 Ill be the bridegroom, you shall be the bride.
 238F.12	 Her spirit revived to hear him say sae,
 	 And thus ended luckily all her great wae;
 	 Then streight were they married, with joy most profound,
 	 And Jean of Bethelnie was savd from the ground.

 238G.2	 She speered at his footman that rode by his side
 	 His name an his surname an whare he did bide:

 	 He is of the gay Gordons, an John is his name.
 238G.3	 Oh, Logie, Glenlogie, Ill tell you my mind;
 	 My luve is laid on you, O wad ye prove kind!
 	 He turned him about, as the Gordons do a,
 	 I thank [you], fair ladye, but Im promised awa.
 238G.4	 She called on her maidens her hands for to take,
 	 An the rings on her fingers she did them a break:

 238G.6	 Her father wrote a broad letter wi speed,
 	 And ordered his footman to run and ride;
 	 He wrote a broad letter, he wrote it wi skill,
 	 An sent it to Glenlogie, who had dune her the ill.

 	 When Glenlogie was on the road three miles his lane.
 238G.9	 When he came to her fathers, he saw naething there
 	 But weeping an wailing an sobbing fu sair:

 	 But red and ruddie grew she when Logie gaed ben.
 238G.10	 O turn, Ladye Jeany, turn ye to your side,

 238H.1	 SIX and six nobles gaed to Behelvie fair,
 	 But bonnie Glenlogie was flowr o a there;
 	 Bonnie Jean o Belhelvie gaed tripping doun the stair,
 	 And fancied Glenlogie afore a that was there.
 238H.2	 She said to his serving-man, as he stood aside,
 	 O what is that mans name, and whare does he bide?
 	 They call him Glenlogie whan he goes frae home,
 	 But hes come o the grand gordons, and [h]is name is Lord John.
 238H.3	 Glenlogie, Glenlogie, be constant and kind;

 238H.4	 She called for the servant to show her a room,
 	 Likewise for a handmaid to mak her bed doun;
 	 Wi that Jeanies father cam stepping on the floor,
 	 Says, What is the matter my dochter lies here?
 238H.5	 Forgie, honourd father, my folly, said she,
 	 But for the sake o Glenlogie your dochter will dee:
 	 O cheer up, my dochter, for Ill gie ye my hand

 	 I wad rather tak Glenlogie wi his staff in his hand
 	 Afore I wad tak Glenforbar wi an earldom of land.
 238H.7	 Jeanies father was a scholar, and a man o grit wit,

 238I.2	 Where will I get a bonny boy, to win hose and shoon,
 	 To go to Glenlogie and bid Logie come?
 	 Here am I pretty boy, to win baith hose and shoon,

 238I.3	 When he came to Glenlogie, it was wash and go dine:
 	 Come in, my pretty boy, wash and go dine:
 	 It was no my fathers fashion, and I hope itll no be mine,
 	 To run a ladys hasty errand, then to go dine.
 238I.4	 Here take this letter, Glenlogie, said he.
 	 The first ane line that he read, a low smile gave he;
 	 The next ane line that he read, the tear blinded his ee;
 	 But the next line that he read he garrd the table flee.
 238I.5	 O saddle to me the black horse, saddle to me the brown,
