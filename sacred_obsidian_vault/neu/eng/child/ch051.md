 <pre>
 
 51A.1	LIZIE WAN sits at her fathers bower-door,
 	Weeping and making a mane,
 	And by there came her father dear:
 	What ails thee, Lizie Wan?
 51A.2	I ail, and I ail, dear father, she said,
 	And Ill tell you a reason for why;
 	There is a child between my twa sides,
 	Between my dear billy and I.
 51A.3	Now Lizie Wan sits at her fathers bower-door,
 	Sighing and making a mane,
 	And by there came her brother dear:
 	What ails thee, Lizie Wan?
 51A.4	I ail, I ail, dear brither, she said,
 	And Ill tell you a reason for why;
 	There is a child bewteen my twa sides,
 	Between you, dear billy, and I.
 51A.5	And hast thou tald father and mother o that?
 	And hast thou tald sae o me?
 	And he has drawn his gude braid sword,
 	That hung down by his knee.
 
 51A.6	And he has cutted aff Lizie Wans head,
 	And her fair body in three,
 	And hes awa to his mothers bower,
 	And sair aghast was he.
 51A.7	What ails thee, what ails thee, Geordy Wan?
 	What ails thee sae fast to rin?
 	For I see by thy ill colour
 	Some fallows deed thou hast done.
 51A.8	Some fallows deed I have done, mother,
 	And I pray you pardon me;
 	For Ive cutted aff my greyhounds head;
 	He wadna rin for me.
 51A.9	Thy greyhounds bluid was never sae red,
 	O my son Geordy Wan!
 	For I see by thy ill colour
 	Some fallows deed thou hast done.
 51A.10	Some fallows deed I hae done, mother,
 	And I pray you pardon me;
 	For I hae cutted aff Lizie Wans head
 	And her fair body in three.
 51A.11	O what wilt thou do when thy father comes hame,
 	O my son Geordy Wan?
 	Ill set my foot in a bottomless boat,
 	And swim to the sea-ground.
 51A.12	And when will thou come hame again,
 	O my son Geordy Wan?
 	The sun and the moon shall dance on the green
 	That night when I come hame.
