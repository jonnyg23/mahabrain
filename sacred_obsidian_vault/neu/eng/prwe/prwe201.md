 <p align="CENTER">THE PHANTOM SHIP.</p>
 <p>YEARS long ago, one night, a gig's crew was called to go
 off to a "hobble," to the westwards of St Ives Head. No sooner was one boat
 launched than several others were put off from the shore, and a stiff chase
 was maintained, each one being eager to get to the ship, as she had the
 appearance of a foreign trader. The hull was clearly visible, she was a
 schooner-rigged vessel, with a light over her bows.</p>
 <p>Away they pulled, and the boat which had been first
 launched still kept ahead by dint of mechanical power and skill. All the men
 had thrown off their jackets to row with more freedom. At length the
 helmsman cried out, "Stand ready to board her." The sailor rowing the bow
 oar slipped it out of the row-lock, and stood on the forethought, taking his
 jacket on his arm, ready to spring aboard.</p>
 <p>The vessel came so close to the boat that they could see
 the men, and the bow-oar man made a grasp at her bulwarks. His hand found
 nothing solid, and he fell, being caught by one of his mates, back into the
 boat, instead of into the water. Then ship and lights disappeared. The next
 morning the <i>Neptune </i>of London, Captain Richard Grant, was wrecked at
 Gwithian, and all perished. The captain's body was picked up after a few
 days, and that of his son also. They were both buried in Gwithian
 churchyard.</p>
