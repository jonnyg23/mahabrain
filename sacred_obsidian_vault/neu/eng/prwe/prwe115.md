 <p align="CENTER">THE WARNING.</p>
 <p>THE following instance is given me, as from the party to
 whom it happened, "a respectable person, of undoubted veracity." "When a
 young man, fearing and caring for no one, I was in the habit of visiting
 Sancreed from Penzance, and of returning in the evening. One night I took up
 my hat to return, and went out at the door. It was a most beautiful night,
 when, without the most remote assignable reason, I was seized in a manner I
 never experienced either before or since. I was absolutely
 'terror-stricken,' so that I was compelled to turn back to the house, a
 thing I had never done before, and say, 'I must remain here for the night.'
 I could never account for it; and without caring to be called superstitious,
 have regarded it as a special interposition of Providence. It was reported
 that shortly before, a lad, who had driven home a farmer's daughter to her
 father's house in the neighbourhood, had suddenly been missed, and no clue
 to his whereabouts had ever been found. About four or six weeks after my
 adventure, a gang of sheep-stealers who had carried on their depredations
 for a long time previous, were discovered in the neighbourhood; their abode,
 indeed, adjoined the road from Sancreed to Penzance, and I cannot help
 believing it probable, that had I returned that night I should have
 encountered the gang, and perhaps lost my life. Years afterwards, one of the
 gang confessed that the boy had come suddenly upon them during one of their
 nefarious expeditions. He was seized, and injudiciously said, 'Well, you may
 get off once or twice, but you 're sure to be hanged in the end.' 'Thee
 shan't help to do it,' said one, and the poor boy was murdered, and his body
 thrown into a neighbouring shaft."</p>
