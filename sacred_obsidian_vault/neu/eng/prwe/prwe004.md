 <p align="CENTER">CORINEUS AND GOGMAGOG.</p>
 <p><br>
 WHO can dare question such an authority as John Milton? In his "History of
 Britain, that part especially now called England. From the first Traditional
 beginning continued to the Norman Conquest. Collected out of the antientest
 and best authors thereof." he gives us the story of Brutus and of Corineus,
 "who with the battele Ax which he was wont to manage against the <i>Tyrrhen
 Giants</i>, is said to have done marvells." With the adventures of these
 heroes in <i>Africa</i> and in <i>Aquitania</i> we have little concern. They
 suffer severe defeats; and then "Brutus, finding now his powers much lessn'd,
 and this not yet the place foretold him, leaves Aquitain, and with an easy
 course arriving at Totness in <i>Dev'nshire</i>, quickly perceivs heer to be
 the promis'd end of his labours." The following matters interest us more
 closely: [a]--</p>
 <p>"The Iland, not yet <i>Britain</i>, but <i>Albion</i>, was
 in a manner desert and inhospitable, kept only by a remnant of <i>Giants</i>,
 whose excessive Force and Tyrannie had consumed the rest. Them Brutus
 destroies, and to his people divides the land, which, with some reference to
 his own name, he thenceforth calls <i>Britain</i>. To <i>Corincus</i>, <i>
 Cornwall</i>, as now we call it, fell by lot; the rather by him lik't, for
 that the hugest Giants in Rocks and Caves were said to lurk still there; which
 kind of Monsters to deal with was his old exercise.</p>
 <p>"And heer, with leave bespok'n to recite a grand fable,
 though dignify'd by our best Poets: While Brutus, on a certain Festival day,
 solemnly kept on that shoar where he first landed (Totness), was with the
 People in great jollity and mirth, a crew of these savages, breaking in upon
 them, began on the sudden another sort of Game than at such a meeting was
 expected. But at length by many hands overcome, <i>Goemagog</i>, the hugest,
 in hight twelve cubits, is reserved alive; that with him Corineus, who desired
 nothing more, might try his strength, whom in a Wrestle the Giant catching
 aloft, with a terrible bugg broke three of his Ribs: Nevertheless Corineus,
 enraged, heaving him up by main force, and on his shoulders bearing him to the
 next high rock, threw him hedlong all shatter'd into the sea, and left his
 name on the cliff, called ever since <i>Langoemagog</i>, which is to say, the
 Giant's Leap." The same story has been somewhat differently told, although
 there is but little variation in the main incidents. When Brutus and Corineus,
 with their Trojan hosts, landed at Plymouth, these chiefs wisely sent parties
 into the interior to explore the country, and to learn something of the
 people. At the end of the first day, all the soldiers who had been sent out as
 exploring parties, returned in great terror, pursued by several terrific
 giants. Brutus and Corineus were not, however, to be terrified by the immense
 size of their enemies, nor by the horrid noises which they made, hoping to
 strike terror into the armed hosts. These chieftains rallied their hosts and
 marched to meet the giants, hurling their spears and flinging their darts
 against their huge bodies. The assault was so unexpected that the giants gave
 way, and eventually fled to the hills of Dartmoor. Gogmagog, the captain of
 the giants, who was sadly wounded in the leg, and, unable to proceed, hid 
 himself in a bog; but there, by the light of the moon, he was found by the
 Trojan soldiers, bound with strong cords, and carried back to the Hoe at
 Plymouth, where the camp was. Gogmagog was treated nobly by his victors, and
 his wounds were speedily healed. Brutus desired to make terms with the giants;
 and it was at length proposed by Gogmagog to try a fall with the strongest in
 the host, and that whoever came off the conqueror should be proclaimed king of
 Cornwall, and hold possession of all the western land. Corineus at once
 accepted the challenge of the monster. Notwithstanding, the giant,</p>
 <p>"Though bent with woes, <br>
 Full eighteen feet in height he rose;<br>
 His hair; exposed to sun and wind, <br>
 Like wither'd heath, his head entwined,"</p>
 <p>and that Corineus was but little above the ordinary size of
 man, the Trojan chief felt sure of a victory. The day for the wrestling was
 fixed. The huge Gogmagog was allowed to send for the giants, and they
 assembled on one side of a cleared space on Plymouth Hoe, while the Trojan
 soldiers occupied the other. All arms were thrown aside; and fronting each
 other, naked to the waist, stood the most lordly of the giants, and the most
 noble of men. The conflict was long, and it appeared for sometime doubt ful.
 Brute strength was exerted on one side, and trained skill on the other. At
 length Corineus succeeded in seizing Gogmagog by the girdle, and by
 regularly-repeated impulses he made the monster undulate like a tree shaken by
 a winter storm, until at length, gathering all his strength into one effort,
 the giant was forced to his back on the ground, the earth shaking with his
 weight, and the air echoing with the thunder of his mighty groan, as the
 breath was forced from his body by the terrible momentum of his fall. There
 lay the giant, and there were all the other giants, appalled at the power
 which they could not understand, but which convinced them that there was
 something superior to mere animal strength. Corineus breathed for a minute,
 then he rushed upon his prostrate foe, and seizing him by the legs, he dragged
 him to the edge of the cliff; and precipitated him into the sea. The giant
 fell on the rocks below, and his body was broken into fragments by the fall;
 while the</p>
 <p>"Fretted flood<br>
 Roll'd frothy waves of purple blood."</p>
 <p>"Gogmagog's. Leap" has been preserved near the spot which
 now presents a fortress to the foes of Britain; and there are those "who say
 that, at the last digging on the Haw for the foundation of the citadel of
 Plymouth, the great jaws and teeth therein found were those of Gogmagog." [b]</p>
