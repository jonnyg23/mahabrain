 <p align="CENTER">DANDO AND HIS DOGS.</p>
 <p><br>
 IN the neighbourhood of the lovely village of St Germans formerly lived a
 priest connected with the old priory church of this parish, whose life does
 not appear to have been quite consistent with his vows.</p>
 <p>He lived the life of the traditional "jolly friar." He ate
 and drank of the best the land could give him, or money buy; and it is said
 that his indulgences extended far beyond the ordinary limits of good living.
 The priest Dando was, notwithstanding all his vices, a man liked by the
 people. He was good-natured, and therefore blind to many of their sins.
 Indeed, he threw a cloak over his own iniquities, which was inscribed
 "charity," and he freely forgave all those who came to his confessional.</p>
 <p>As a man increases in years he becomes more deeply dyed
 with the polluted waters through which he may have waded. It rarely happens
 that an old sinner is ever a repentant one, until the decay of nature has
 reduced him to a state of second childhood. As long as health allows him to
 enjoy the sensualities of life, he continues to gratify his passions,
 regardless of the cost. He becomes more selfish, and his own gratification is
 the rule of his existence. So it has ever been, and so was it with Dando.</p>
 <p>The sinful priest was a capital huntsman, and scoured the
 country far and near in pursuit of game, which was in those days abundant and
 varied, over this well-wooded district. Dando, in the eagerness of the chase,
 paid no regard to any kind of property. Many a corn-field has been trampled
 down, and many a cottage garden destroyed by the horses and dogs which this
 impetuous hunter would lead unthinkingly over them. Curses deep, though not
 loud, would follow the old man, as even those who suffered by his excesses
 were still in fear of his priestly power.</p>
 <p>Any man may sell his soul to the devil without going
 through the stereotyped process of signing a deed with his blood. Give up your
 soul to Satan's daring sins, and he will help you for a season, until he has
 his chains carefully wound around you, when the links are suddenly closed, and
 he seizes his victim, who has no power to resist.</p>
 <p>Dando worshipped the sensual gods which he had created, and
 his external worship of the God of truth became every year more and more a
 hypocritical lie. The devil looked carefully after his prize. Of course, to
 catch a dignitary of the church was a thing to cause rejoicings amongst the
 lost; and Dando was carefully lured to the undoing of his soul. Health and 
 wealth were secured to him, and by and by the measure of his sins was full,
 and he was left the victim to self-indulgences--a doomed man. With increasing
 years, and the immunities he enjoyed, Dando became more reckless. Wine and
 wassail, a board groaning with dishes which stimulated the sated appetite, and
 the company of both sexes of dissolute habits, exhausted his nights. His days
 were devoted to the pursuits of the field; and to maintain the required
 excitement, ardent drinks were supplied him by his wicked companions. It
 mattered not to Dando,--provided the day was an auspicious one, if the scent
 would lie on the ground,--even on the Sabbath, horses and hounds were ordered
 out, and the priest would be seen in full cry.</p>
 <p>One Sabbath morning, Dando and his riotous rout were hunting
 over the Earth estate; game was plenty, and sport first-rate. Exhausted with a
 long and eager run, Dando called for drink. He had already exhausted the
 flasks of the attendant hunters.</p>
 <p>"Drink, I say; give me drink," he cried.</p>
 <p>"Whence can we get it?" asked one of the gang.</p>
 <p>"Go to hell for it, if you can't get it on Earth," said the
 priest, with a bitter laugh at his own joke on the Earth estate.</p>
 <p>At the moment, a dashing hunter, who had mingled with the
 throng unobserved, came forward, and presented a richly-mounted flask to
 Dando, saying,-- </p>
 <p>"Here is some choice liquor distilled in the establishment you
 speak of. It will warm and revive you, I'll warrant. Drink deep, friend,
 drink."</p>
 <p>Dando drank deep; the flask appeared to cling to his lips. The
 strange hunter looked on with a rejoicing yet malignant expression, a wicked
 smile playing over an otherwise tranquil face.</p>
 <p>By and by Dando fetched a deep sigh, and removed the flask,
 exclaiming, "By hell! that was a drink indeed. Do the gods drink such nectar
 ?"</p>
 <p>"Devils do," said the hunter.</p>
 <p>"An they do, I wish I were one," said Dando, who now rocked to
 and fro in a state of thorough intoxication; "methinks the drink is very like
 "--The impious expression died upon his lips. </p>
 <p>Looking round with a half-idiotic stare, Dando saw that his
 new friend had appropriated several head of game. Notwithstanding his stupid
 intoxication, his selfishness asserted its power, and he seized the game,
 exclaiming, in a guttural, half-smothered voice, "None of these are thine."</p>
 <p>"What I catch I keep," said the hunter.</p>
 <p>"By all the devils they 're mine," stammered Dando.</p>
 <p>The hunter quietly bowed.</p>
 <p>Dando's wrath burst at once into a burning flame,
 uncontrolled by reason. He rolled himself off his horse, and rushed,
 staggering as he went, at the steed of his unknown friend, uttering most
 frightful oaths and curses.</p>
 <p>The strange hunter's horse was a splendid creature, black
 as night, and its eyes gleamed like the brightest stars with unnatural lustre.
 The horse was turned adroitly aside, and Dando fell to the earth with much
 force. The fall appeared to add to his</p>
 <p>fury, and he roared with rage. Aided by his attendants, he
 was 'speedily on his legs, and again at the side of the hunter, who shook with
 laughter, shaking the game in derision, and quietly uttering, "They 're mine."</p>
 <p>"I 'll go to hell after them, but I'll get them from thee,"
 shouted Dando.</p>
 <p>"So thou shalt," said the hunter; and seizing Dando by the
 collar, he lifted him from the ground, and placed him, as though he were a
 child, before him on the horse.</p>
 <p>With a dash, the horse passed down the hill, its hoofs
 striking fire at every tread, and the dogs, barking furiously, followed
 impetuously. These strange riders reached the banks of the Lynher, and with a
 terrific leap, the horse and its riders, followed by the hounds, went out far
 in its waters, disappearing at length in a blaze of fire, which caused the
 stream to boil for a moment, and then the waters flowed on as tranquilly as
 ever over the doomed priest. All this happened in the sight of the assembled
 peasantry. Dando never more was seen, and his fearful death was received as a
 warning by many, who gave gifts to the church. One amongst them carved a chair
 for the bishop, and on it he represented Dando and his dogs, that the memory
 of his wickedness might be always renewed. There, in St German's Church,
 stands to this day the chair, and all who doubt the truth of this tradition
 may view the story carved in enduring oak. If they please, they can sit in the
 chair until their faith is so far quickened that they become true believers.
 On Sunday mornings early, the dogs of the priest have been often heard as - if
 in eager pursuit of game. Cheney's hounds and the Wish hounds of Dartmoor are
 but other versions of the same legend.[a]</p>
 <p>Mr T. Q. Couch, in his "Folk Lore of a Cornish Village," tells
 the story in a somewhat different form:-- </p>
