 <p align="CENTER">CRYING THE NECK.</p>
 <p>OWING to the uncertain character of the climate of
 Cornwall, the farmers have adopted the plan of gathering the sheaves of
 wheat, as speedily as possible, into "arishmows." These are solid cones from
 ten to twelve feet high, the heads of the stalks turned inwards, and the
 whole capped with a sheaf of corn inverted. Whence the term, I know not; but
 "arish" is commonly applied to a field of corn recently cut, as, "Turn the
 geese in upon the 'arish' "-- that is, the short stubble left in the ground.</p>
 <p>After the wheat is all cut on most farms in Cornwall and
 Devon, the harvest people have a custom of " crying the neck." I believe
 that this practice is seldom omitted on any large farm in these counties. It
 is done in this way. An old man, or some one else well acquainted with the
 ceremonies used on the occasion (when the labourers are reaping the last
 field of wheat), goes round to the shocks and sheaves, arid picks out a
 little bundle of all the best ears he can find; this bundle he ties up very
 neat and trim, and plaits and arranges the straws very tastefully. This is
 called "the neck" of wheat, or wheaten-ears. After the field is cut out, and
 the pitcher once more circulated, the reapers, binders, and the women stand
 round in a circle. The person with "the neck" stands in the centre, grasping
 it with both his hands. He first stoops and holds it near the ground, and
 all the men forming the ring take off their hats, stooping and holding them
 with both hands towards the ground. They then all begin at once, in a very
 pro-longed and harmonious tone, to cry, "The neck !" at the same time slowly
 raising themselves upright, and elevating their arms and hats above their
 heads; the person with the neck also raising it on high. This is done three
 times. They then change their cry to "We yen ! we yen !" which they sound in
 the same prolonged and slow manner as before, with singular harmony and
 effect, three times. This last cry is accompanied by the same movements of
 the body and arms as in crying "the neck." I know nothing of vocal music,
 but I think I may convey some idea of the sound by giving you the following
 notes in gamut --</p>

 <p>Let these notes be played on a flute with perfect
 crescendoes and diminuendoes, and perhaps some notion of this wild-sounding
 cry may be formed. Well, after this they all burst out into a kind of loud,
 joyous laugh, flinging up their hats and caps into the air, capering about,
 and perhaps kissing the girls. One of them then gets "the neck," and runs as
 hard as he can down to the farmhouse, 'where the dairy-maid, or one of the
 young female domestics, stands at the door prepared with a pail of water. If
 he who holds "the neck" can manage to get into the house in any way unseen,
 or openly by any other way than the door at which the girl stands with the
 pail of water, then he may lawfully kiss her; but, if otherwise he is
 regularly soused with the contents of the bucket. I think this practice is
 beginning to decline of late, and many farmers and their men do not care
 about keeping up this old custom. The object of crying "the neck" is to give
 notice to the surrounding country of the end of the harvest, and the meaning
 of" we yen" is "we have ended." It may probably mean "we end," which the
 uncouth and provincial pronunciation has corrupted into "we yen." The "neck"
 is generally hung up in the farmhouse, where it often remains for three or
 four years.</p>
