 <p align="CENTER">ST KEA'S BOAT.</p>
 <p>ST KEA, a young Irish saint, stood on the southern shores
 of Ireland and saw the Christian missionaries departing to carry the blessed
 Word to the heathens of Western England. He watched their barks fade beneath
 the horizon, and he felt that he was left to a solitude which was not fitted
 to one in the full energy of young life, and burning with zeal.</p>
 <p>The saint knelt on a boulder of granite lying on the
 shore, and he prayed with fervour that Heaven would order it so that he
 might diffuse his religious fervour amongst the barbarians of Cornwall, He
 prayed on for some time, not observing the rising of the tide. When he had
 poured out his full soul, he awoke to the fact, not only that the waves were
 washing around the stone on which he knelt, but that the stone was actually
 floating on the water. Impressed with the miracle, St Kea sprang to his
 feet, and looking towards the setting sun, with his cross uplifted, he
 exclaimed, "To Thee, and only to Thee, my God, do I trust my soul !"</p>
 <p>Onward floated the granite, rendered buoyant by
 supernatural power. Floated hither and thither by the tides, it swam on;
 blown sometimes in one direction, and sometimes in another, by the varying
 winds, days and nights were spent upon the waters. The faith of St Kea
 failed not; three times a day he knelt in prayer to God. At all other times
 he stood gazing on the heavens. At length the faith of the saint being
 fairly tried, the moorstone boat floated steadily up the river, and landed
 at St Kea, which place he soon Christianised; and there stands to this day
 this monument of St Kea's sincere belief.</p>
