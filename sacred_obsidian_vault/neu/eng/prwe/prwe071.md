 <p align="CENTER">THE DANCING STONES, THE HURLERS, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><br>
 IN many parts of Cornwall we find, more or less perfect, circles of stones,
 which the learned ascribe to the Druids. Tradition, and the common people, who
 have faith in all that their fathers have taught them, tell us another tale.
 These stones are everlasting marks of the Divine displeasure, being maidens or
 men, who were changed into stone for some wicked profanation of the
 Sabbath-day. These monuments of impiety are scattered over the county; they
 are to be found, indeed, to the extremity of Old Cornwall, many of those
 circles being upon Dartmoor. It is not necessary to name them all. Every
 purpose will be served if the tourist is directed to those which lie more
 directly in the route which is usually prescribed. In the parish of Burian are
 the "<i>Dawns Myin</i>" or Mên--the dancing stones--commonly called "The
 Merry Maidens;" and near them are two granite pillars, named the "Pipers." One
 Sabbath evening some of the thought. less maidens of the neighbouring village,
 instead of attending vespers, strayed into the fields, and two evil spirits,
 assuming the guise of pipers, began to play some dance tunes. The young people
 yielded to the temptation; and, forgetting the holy day, commenced dancing.
 The excitement increased with the exercise, and soon the music and the dance
 became extremely wild; when, lo a flash of lightning from the clear sky
 transfixed them all, the tempters and the tempted, and there in stone they
 stand.</p>
 <p>The celebrated circle of nineteen stones,--which is seen
 on the road to the Land's End,--known as the "Boscawen un Circle," is another
 example. The "Nine Maids," or the "Virgin Sisters," in Stithians, and other
 "Nine Maids," or, as called in Cornish, Naw-whoors, in St Colomb-Major parish,
 should also be seen, in the hope of impressing the moral lesson they convey
 yet more strongly on the mind. [a]</p>
 <p>The three circles, which are seen on the moors not far from
 the Cheesewring, in the parish of St Cleer, are also notable examples of the
 punishment of Sabbath-breaking. These are called the Hurlers," and they
 preserve the position in which the several parties stood in the full
 excitement of the game of hurling, when, for the crime of profaning the
 Sabbath, they were changed into stone. [b]</p>
 <p>[a] The following quotations are
 front Davies Gilbert. It must not be forgotten that this gentleman was
 President of the Royal Society, and therefore a sceptic in local tradutionary
 story:-- -</p>
 <p>"On the south-west part of the parish
 of Stithians, towards Gwendron, are still to be seen nine Stones set
 perpendicularly erect in the earth, in a direct manner, about ten feet apart,
 called the Nine Maids, probably set up there in memory of nine religious
 sisters or nuns in that place before the fifth century; not women turned into
 stone, as the English name implies, and as the country people thereabout will
 tell you"</p>
 <p>"The Nine Maids--in Cornish,
 Naw-voz, <i>alias</i> the nine sisters--in Cornish, Nawwhoors--which very
 name informs us that they were sepulchral stones, erected in memory either of
 suns natural or spiritual Sisters of some religious house, and not so many
 maids turned into stones for dancing on the Sabbath-day, as the country people
 will tell you. Those stones are set in order by a line, as is such another
 monument, also called the Nine Maids, in Gwendron, by the highway, about
 twenty-five feet distance Irons each other."</p>
 <p>[b] "With respect to the stones
 called the 'Hurlers' being once men, I will say with Hals, 'Did hut the ball
 which these Hurlers used when flesh and blood appear directly over them,
 immovably pendant in the air, one might he apt to credit some little of the
 tale;' but as this is not the case, I must add icy belief of their being
 erected by the</p>
 <p>Druids for some purpose or other --
 probably a court of justice; bog subsequent to which erection, however, they
 may have served as a goal for hurl-players."--<i>Topographical and Historical
 Sketches of the Boroughs of East and West Love</i>, by Thomas Bond.</p>
 <p>May we not address Mr Bond, "O ye of
 little faith!" A very small amount of which would have found the ball, fixed
 as a boulder of granite, not as it passed through the air, but as it rolled
 along the ground.</p>
 <p>That an ancient priesthood, endeavouring
 to reach the minds of an ignorant people through their sensations, should
 endeavour to persuade the old Celtic population that God's vengeance had
 fallen on the Sabbath-breaker, is not to be wondered at. Up to a very recent
 period, hurling matches usually came off on the Sunday--See "Hurling," in the
 chapter on Cornish Customs</p>
