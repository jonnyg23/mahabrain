 <p align="CENTER">ST MICHAEL'S MOUNT--THE WHITE ROCK IN THE
 WOOD.</p>
 <p>
  <br>
 "An old legend of St Michael speaketh of a tounelet in this part
 (between Pensandes and Mousehole), now defaced, and lying under the water."
 .Leland's Itinerary.</p>
 <p>ALREADY it has been told how St Michael's Mount was built
 by the giants. So much for its Titanic origin. The tradition that the Mount
 was formerly called in old Cornish, <i>Careg-luz en kuz</i>, [a] and that it
 rose from the midst of an extensive forest, is very prevalent. "A forest is
 supposed to have extended along the coast to St Michael's Mount, which was
 described as a 'hoare rock in a wood,' and stood five or six miles from the
 sea. The bay was said to have been a plain of five or six miles in extent,
 formed into parishes, each having its church, and laid out in meadows,
 corn-fields, and woods." [b] A similar tradition attaches itself to Mont St
 Michel, in Normandy.</p>
 <p>By and by, when the Saxon rule was extended into Cornwall,
 this remarkable hill is seized upon, in common with many other such hills, as
 the residence of some anchorite. This holy recluse is visited by St Michael,
 who had an especial fondness for hill churches, and the hermit is directed to
 build a church on the summit, and dedicate it to St Michael.</p>
 <p>"In evile howre thou hentst in hond,<br>
 Thus holy hills to blame;<br>
 For sacred unto saints they stand,<br>
 And of them have their name.<br>
 St Michael's Mount, who does not know,<br>
 That wards the western coast."<br>
 -- SPENSER</p>
 <p>Milton, in his delicately beautiful poem of "Lycidas," makes
 especial illusion to thiis monkish legend:-- </p>
 <p>"Where'er thy bones are hurl'd,<br>
 Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,<br>
 Where thou, perhaps, under the whelming tide,<br>
 Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world,<br>
 Or, whether thou, to our moist vows denied,<br>
 Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old, [c]<br>
 Where the <i>great vision of the guarded mount,<br>
 </i>Look towards Namancos, and Bayona's hold;<br>
 Look homeward, angel, now, and melt with ruth,<br>
 And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth."<br>
 -- MILTON's <i>Lycidas</i>.</p>
 <p>Warner, in his "Tour through Cornwall," with much
 assumption of learning, attempts to explain these lines. He tells us that the
 Land's End was called <i>Bellerium</i>, "so named from Bellerus, a Cornish
 giant. No such giant ever existed in Cornish fable, as far as can be
 ascertained. It is far more probable that Milton used the poet's license, and,
 from the name of the Land's End, Bellerium, created 'the fable of Bellerus
 old.'" What follows in Warner is worth extracting:-- </p>
 <p>"We learn from ' Caston's Golden Legende,' under the
 history of the Angel Michael, that, 'Th' apparacyon of this angell is
 many-fold. The fyrst is when he appeared in Mount of Gargan, &amp;c.,' (edit.
 1493, fol. cclxxxii. a). William of Worcester, who wrote his travels over
 England about 1490, says, in describing St Michael's Mount, there was an
 'Apparicio Sancti Michaelis in monte Tumba antea vocato <i>Le Hore Rok in the
 Wodd'</i> (Itinerar., edit. Cantab., 1778, p. 102). The <i>Hoar Rock in Ike
 Wood</i> is this Mount or Rock of St Michael, anciently covered with thick
 wood, as we learn from Drayton and Carew. There is still a tradition, that a
 vision of St Michael seated on this crag, or St Michael's Chair, appeared to.
 some hermits; and that this circumstance occasioned the foundation of the
 monastery dedicated to St Michael. And hence this place was long renowned for
 its sanctity, and the object of frequent pilgrimages. Carew quotes some old
 rhymes much to our purpose, p. 154, <i>ut supra</i></p>
 
 <p>'Who knows not Mighel's Mount and Chaire,<br>
 The pilgrim's holy vaunt?'</p>
 <p>Nor should it be forgot that this monastery was a cell to
 another on a St Michael's Mount in Normandy, where was also a vision of St
 Michael. But to apply what has been said to Milton. This great vision is the
 famous apparition of St Michael, whom he, with much sublimity of imagination,
 supposes to be still throned on this lofty crag of St Michael's Mount in
 Cornwall, looking towards the Spanish coast. The guarded mount on which this
 great vision appeared is simply the <i>fortified</i> mount, implying the
 fortress above mentioned. And let us observe, that Mount is the peculiar
 appropriated appellation of this promontory. So in Daniel's Panegyricke on the
 King, st. 19, 'From Dover to the Mount.' "--P. 180.</p>
 <p>"In the very corner is Michael's Mount, which gives name to
 the bay (the Mount's Bay) anciently called <i>DINSOL</i>, as in the book of
 Llandaff, called by the inhabitants <i>Careg.Cowse</i>, or the Gray Rock--in
 Saxon, Mychelyroz, or Michael's Place." [d]</p>
 <p>From Hals, Tonkin, and Gilbert, we learn yet further that
 "St Michael's Mount is so called, because our fathers, the Britons, believed
 that the appearance of the archangel St Michael in the year of our Lord 495
 was in this place; though in other countries they believe differently."</p>
 <p>"Edward the Confessor, finding the place already celebrated
 for its holiness, founded an abbey of Benedictine monks, A.D. 1044, and also a
 chapel, which still stand, part of which is now converted into a
 dwelling-house. Upon the tower of the chapel is the celebrated Kader Migell, --
 <i>i.e</i>., Michael's Chair,--a seat artificially cut in the stone, very
 dangerous in the access, therefore holy for the adventure.</p>
 <p>" 'Who knows not Mighel's Mount and Chaire,<br>
 The pilgrim's holy vaunt;<br>
 Both land and island twice a day, -<br>
 Both fort and port of haunt?'"</p>
 <p>It is supposed by many persons to have been placed there
 for the pilgrims to complete their devotions at the Mount, by sitting in this
 chair, and showing themselves to the country around as pilgrims. St Kenna,
 doubtless the same as St Keyna, once visited this Mount,--although the time
 of her visitation is not precisely known,--and she imparted the very same
 virtue to the chair as she bestowed on St Keyna's Well. It is whichever, man
 or wife, sits in this chair first shall rule through life, and as it requires
 great resolution and steadiness of head to obtain the seat, one may be
 inclined to anticipate the supposed effect with greater certainty from its
 achievement, than from drinking water from St Keyna's Well.</p>
 <p>It is not pleasant to destroy the romance of ages, but
 honesty compels me to pronounce this so-called chair to be nothing more than
 the remains of a stone lantern, built at the south-western angle of the tower.
 The good monks, without doubt, placing a light therein, it could be seen by
 the fishermen far off at sea; and probably they received some tribute of
 either fish or money for the support of this useful guide to the shore.</p>
 <p>It is evident, from the following passage in Carew's
 Survey, that the "chair" formerly was not within the building at all, but on
 some rocks without the walls - </p>
 <p>"A little without the castle there is a bad seat in a
 craggy place called St Michael's Chaire, somewhat dangerous for accesse, and
 therefore holy for the adventure." [e]</p>
