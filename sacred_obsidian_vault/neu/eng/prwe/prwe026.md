 <p align="CENTER">THE LOST CHILD.</p>
 <p><br>
 IN the little hamlet of Treonike, in the parish of St Allen, has long lingered
 the story of a lost child, who was subsequently found. All the stories agree
 in referring the abduction of the child to supernatural agency, and in some
 cases it is referred to the "Small People or Piskies,"--in others, to less
 amiable spiritual creatures. Mr Hals [a] has given one version of this story,
 which differs in some respects from the tale as I heard it, from an old woman
 some thirty years since, who then lived in this parish. Her tale was to the
 following effect. It was a lovely evening, and the little boy was gathering
 flowers in the fields, near a wood. The child was charmed by hearing some
 beautiful music, which he at first mistook for the song of birds; but, being a
 sharp boy, he was not long deceived, and he went towards the wood to ascertain
 from whence the melodious sounds came. When he reached the verge of the wood,
 the music was of so exquisite a character, that he was compelled to follow the
 sound, which appeared to travel before him. Lured in this way, the boy
 penetrated to the dark centre of the grove, and here, meeting with some
 difficulties, owing to the thick growth of underwood, he paused and began to
 think of returning. The music, however, became more ravishing than before, and
 some invisible being appeared to crush down all the low and tangled plants,
 thus forming for him a passage, over which he passed without any difficulty.
 At length he found himself on the edge of a small lake, and, greatly to his
 astonishment, the darkness of night was around him, but the heavens were thick
 with stars. The music ceased, and, wearied with his wanderings, the boy fell
 asleep on a bed of ferns. He related, on his restoration to his parents, that
 he was taken by a beautiful lady through palaces of the most gorgeous
 description. Pillars of glass supported arches which glistened with every
 colour, and these were hung with crystals far exceeding anything which were
 ever seen in the caverns of a Cornish mine. It is, however, stated that many
 days passed away before the child was found by his friends, and that at length
 he was discovered, one lovely morning, sleeping on the bed of ferns, on which
 he was supposed to have fallen asleep on the first adventurous evening. There
 was no reason given by the narrator why the boy was "spirited away" in the
 first instance, or why he was returned. Her impression was, that some sprites,
 pleased with the child's innocence and beauty, had entranced him. That when
 asleep he had been carried through the waters to the fairy abodes beneath
 them; and she felt assured that a child so treated would be kept under the
 especial guardianship of the sprites for ever afterwards. Of this, however,
 tradition leaves us in ignorance.</p>
