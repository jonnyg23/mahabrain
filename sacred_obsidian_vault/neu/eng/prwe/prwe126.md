 <p align="CENTER">THE ST LEVEN STONE.</p>
 <p>
  On the south side of the church, to the east of the porch,
 is a rock known by the above name. It is broken in two, and the fissure is
 filled in with ferns and wild flowers, while the grass grows rank around it.
 On this rock St Leven often sat to rest after the fatigue of fishing; and
 desiring to leave some enduring memento of himself in connection with this
 his rude but favourite seat, he one day gave it a blow with his fist and
 cracked it through. He prayed over the rock and uttered the following
 prophecy :-- </p>
 <p>"When, with panniers astride, <br>
 A pack-horse one can ride <br>
 Through St Leven's Stone, <br>
 The world will be done."</p>
 <p>This stone must have been venerated for the saint's sake
 when the church was built, or it would certainly have been employed for the
 building. It is more than fifty years since I first made acquaintance, as a
 child, with the St Leven Stone, and it may be a satisfaction' to many to
 know that the progress of separation is an exceedingly slow one. I cannot
 detect the slightest difference in the width of the fissure now and then. At
 the present slow rate of opening, the pack-horse and panniers will not be
 able to pass through the rock for many thousands of years to come. We need
 not, therefore, place much reliance on those prophecies which give but a
 limited duration to this planet.</p>
