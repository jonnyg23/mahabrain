 <p align="CENTER">THE GIANT OF ST MICHAEL'S MOUNT LOSES HIS WIFE.</p>
 <p><br>
 THE giant on the Mount and the giant on Trecrobben Hill were very friendly.
 They had only one cobbling-hammer between them, which they would throw from
 one to the other, as either required it. One day the giant on the Mount wanted
 the hammer in a great hurry, so he shouted, " Holloa, up there! Trecrobben,
 throw us down the hammer, woost a'?"</p>
 <p>"To be sure," sings out Trecrobben; "here! look out, and
 catch 'm."</p>
 <p>Now, nothing would do but the giant's wife, who was very
 nearsighted, must run out of her cave to see Trecrobben throw the hammer. She
 had no hat on; and coming at once out into the light, she could not 
 distinguish objects. Consequently, she did not see the hammer coming through
 the air, and received it between her eyes. The force with which it was flung
 was so great that the massive bone of the forehead of the giantess was
 crushed, and she fell dead at the giant's feet. You may be sure there was a
 great to-do between the two giants. They sat wailing over the dead body, and
 with their sighs they produced a tempest. These were unavailing to restore the
 old lady, and all they had to do was to bury her. Some say they lifted the
 Chapel Rock and put her under it, others, that she is buried beneath the
 castle court, while some--no doubt the giants' detractors--declare that they
 rolled the body down into the sea, and took no more heed of it.</p>
