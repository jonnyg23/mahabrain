 <p align="CENTER">THE DEATH FETCH OF WILLIAM RUFUS.</p>
 <p>ROBERT, Earl of Moreton, in Normandy,--who always
 carried the standard of St Michael before him in battle,--was made Earl of
 Cornwall by William the Conqueror. He was remarkable for his valour and for
 his virtue, for the exercise of his power, and his benevolence to the
 priests. This was the Earl of Cornwall who gave the Mount in Cornwall to the
 monks of Mont St Michel in Normandy. He seized upon the priory of St Petroc
 at Bodmin, and converted all the lands to his own use.</p>
 <p>This Earl of Cornwall was an especial friend of William
 Rufus. It happened that Robert, the earl, was hunting in the extensive woods
 around Bodmin--of which some remains are still to be found in the Glyn
 Valley. The chase had been a severe one; a fine old red deer had baffled the
 huntsmen, and they were dispersed through the intricacies of the forest, the
 Earl of Cornwall being left alone. He advanced beyond the shades of the
 woods on to the moors above them, and he was surprised to see a very large
 black goat advancing over the plain. As it approached him, which it did
 rapidly, he saw that it bore on its back "King Rufus," all black and naked,
 and wounded through in the midst of his breast. Robert adjured the goat, in
 the name of the Holy Trinity, to tell what it was he carried so strangely.
 He answered, "I am carrying your king to judgment; yea, that tyrant William
 Rufus, for I am an evil spirit, and the revenger of his malice which he bore
 to the Church of God. It was I that did cause this slaughter; the
 protomartyr of England, St Albyn, commanding me so to do, who complained to
 God of him, for his grievous oppression in this Isle of Britain, which he
 first hallowed." Having so spoken, the spectre vanished. Robert, the earl,
 related the circumstance to his followers, and they shortly after learned
 that at that very hour William Rufus had been slain in the New Forest by the
 arrow of Walter Tirell.</p>
