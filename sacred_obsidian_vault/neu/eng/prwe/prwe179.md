 <p align="CENTER">KENIDZHEK WITCH.</p>
 <p>ON the tract called the "Gump," near Kenidzhek, is a
 beautiful well of clear water, not far from which was a miner's Cot, in
 which dwelt two miners with their sister. They told her never to go to the
 well after daylight; they would fetch the water for her. However, on one
 Saturday night she had forgotten to get in a supply for the morrow, so she
 went off to the well. Passing by a gap in a broken-down hedge (called a <i>
 gurgo) </i>near the well, she saw an old woman sitting down, wrapped in a
 red shawl; she asked her what she did there at that time of night, but
 received no reply; she thought this rather strange, but plunged her pitcher
 in the well; when she drew it up, though a perfectly sound vessel, it
 contained no water; she tried again and again, and, though she saw the water
 rushing in at the mouth of the pitcher, it was sure to be empty when lifted
 out. She then became rather frightened; spoke again to the old woman, but
 receiving no answer, hastened away, and came in great alarm to her brothers.
 They told her that it was on account of this old woman they did not wish her
 to go to the well at night. What she saw was the ghost of old Moll, a witch
 who had been a great terror to the people in her lifetime, and had laid many
 fearful spells on them. They said they saw her sitting in the gap by the
 wall every night when going to bed.</p>
