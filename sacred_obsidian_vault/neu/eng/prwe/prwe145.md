 <p align="CENTER">THE WELL OF ST LUDGVAN.</p>
 <p>AT LUDGVAN, an Irish missionary, had finished his work. On
 the hill-top, looking over the most beautiful of bays, the church stood with
 all its blessings. Yet the saint, knowing human nature, determined on
 associating with it some object of a miraculous character, which should draw
 people from all parts of the world to Ludgvan. The saint prayed over the dry
 earth, which was beneath him, as he knelt on the church stile. His prayer was
 for water, and presently a most beautiful crystal stream welled up from below.
 The holy man prayed on, and then, to try the virtues of the water, he washed
 his eyes. They were rendered at once more powerful, so penetrating, indeed, as
 to enable him to see microscopic objects. The saint prayed again, and then he
 drank of the water. He discovered that his powers of utterance were greatly
 improved, his tongue formed words with scarcely any effort of his will. The
 saint now prayed, that all children baptized in the waters of this well might
 be protected against the hangman and his hempen cord; and an angel from heaven
 came down into the water, and promised the saint that his prayers should be
 granted. Not long after this, a good farmer and his wife brought their babe to
 the saint, that it might derive all the blessings belonging to this holy well.
 The priest stood at the baptismal font, the parents, with their friends
 around. The saint proceeded with the baptismal ceremonial, and at length the
 time arrived when he took the tender babe into his holy arms. He signed the
 sign of the cross over the child, and when he sprinkled water on the face of
 the infant its face glowed with a divine intelligence. The priest then
 proceeded with the prayer; but, to the astonishment of all, whenever he used
 the name of Jesus, the child, who had received the miraculous power of speech,
 from the water, pronounced distinctly the name of the devil, much to the
 consternation of all present. The saint knew that an evil spirit had taken
 possession of the child, and he endeavoured to cast him out; but the devil
 proved stronger than the saint for some time. St Ludgvan was not to be beaten;
 he knew that the spirit was a restless soul, which had been exorcised from
 Treassow, and he exerted all his energies in prayer. At length the spirit
 became obedient, and left the child. He was now commanded by the saint to take
 his flight to the Red Sea. He rose, before the terrified spectators, into a
 gigantic size; he then spat into the well ; he laid hold of the pinnacles of
 the tower, and shook the church until they thought it would fall. The saint
 was alone unmoved. He prayed on, until, like a flash of lightning, the demon
 vanished, shaking down a pinnacle in his flight. The demon, by spitting in the
 water, destroyed the spells of the water upon the eyes [a] and the tongue too;
 but it fortunately retains its virtue of preventing any child baptized in it
 from being hanged with a cord of hemp. Upon a cord of silk it is stated to
 have no power.</p>
 <p>This well had nearly lost its reputation once--a Ludgvan
 woman was hanged, under the circumstances told in the following narrative :-- A
 small farmer, living in one of the most western districts of the county, died
 some years back of what was supposed at that time to be "English cholera." A
 few weeks after his decease his wife married again. This circumstance excited
 some attention in the neighbourhood. It was remembered that the woman had
 lived on very bad terms with her late husband, that she had on many occasions
 exhibited strong symptoms of possessing a very vindictive temper, and that
 during the farmer's lifetime she had openly manifested rather more than a
 Platonic preference for the man whom she subsequently married. Suspicion was
 generally excited; people began to doubt whether the first husband had died
 fairly. At length the proper order was applied for, and his body was
 disinterred. On examination, enough arsenic to have poisoned three men was
 found in the stomach. The wife was accused of murdering her husband, was
 tried, convicted on the clearest evidence, and hanged. Very shortly after she
 had suffered capital punishment horrible stories of a ghost were widely
 circulated. Certain people declared that they had seen a ghastly resemblance
 of the murderess, robed in her winding-sheet, with the black mark of the rope
 round her swollen neck, standing on stormy nights upon her husband's grave,
 and digging there with a spade, in hideous imitation of the actions of the men
 who had disinterred the corpse for medical examination. This was fearful
 enough; nobody dared go near the place after nightfall. But soon another
 circumstance was talked of in connection with the poisoner, which affected the
 tranquillity of people's minds in the village where she had lived, and where
 it was believed she had been born, more to this day seriously than even the
 ghost story itself. The well of St Ludgvan, celebrated among the peasantry of
 the district for its one remarkable property, that every child baptized in its
 water (with which the church was duly supplied on christening occasions) was
 secure from ever being hanged.</p>
 <p>No one doubted that all the babies fortunate enough to be born
 and baptized in the parish, though they might live to the age of Methuselah,
 and might during that period commit all the capital crimes recorded in the
 "Newgate Calendar," were still destined to keep quite clear of the summary
 jurisdiction of Jack Ketch. No one doubted this until the story of the
 apparition of the murderess began to be spread abroad; then awful misgivings
 arose in the popular mind.</p>
 <p>A woman who had been born close by the magical well, and who
 had therefore in all probability been baptized in its water, like her
 neighbours of the parish, had nevertheless been publicly and unquestionably
 hanged. However, probability is not always the truth. Every parishioner
 determined that the baptismal register of the poisoner should be sought for,
 and that it should be thus officially ascertained whether she had been
 christened with the well water or not. After much trouble, the important
 document was discovered--not where it was at first looked after, but in a
 neighbouring parish. A mistake had been made about the woman's birthplace; she
 had not been baptized in St Ludgvan Church, and had therefore not been
 protected by the marvellous virtue of the local water. Unutterable was the joy
 and triumph at this discovery.' The wonderful character of the parish well was
 wonderfully vindicated; its celebrity immediately spread wider than ever. The
 peasantry of the neighbouring districts began to send for the renowned water
 before christenings; and many of them actually' continue, to this day, to
 bring it corked up in bottles to their churches, and to beg particularly that
 it may be used whenever they present their children to be baptized. [b]</p>
 <p>[a] It<i> </i>is curious that the farm
 overwhich some of this water flows is called "Colturian"</p>
