 <p align="CENTER">NOTES ON WITCHCRAFT.</p>
 <p>IN confirmation of the melancholy facts related of the
 continuance of the belief in witchcraft, I would give the accompanying
 cuttings from the <i>West Briton </i>newspaper of a very recent date</p>
 <p align="CENTER">GROSS SUPERSTITION.</p>
 <p>"During the week ending Sunday last, a 'wise man' from
 Illogan has been engaged with about half-a-dozen witchcraft cases, one a
 young trades-man, and another a sea-captain. It appears that the 'wise man'
 was in the first place visited at his home by these deluded people at
 different times, and he declared the whole of them to be spell-bound. In one
 case he said that if the person had not come so soon, in about a fortnight
 he would have been in the asylum; another would have had his leg broken; and
 in every case something very direful would have happened. Numerous
 incantations have been performed. In the case of a captain of a vessel, a
 visit as paid to the sea-side, and while the 'wise man' uttered some
 unintelligible gibberish, the captain had to threw a stone into the sea. So
 heavy was the spell under which he laboured, and which immediately fell upon
 the 'wise man,' that the latter pretended that he could scarcely walk back
 to Hayle. The most abominable part of the incantations is performed during
 the hours of midnight, and for that purpose the wretch sleeps with his
 victims, and for five nights following he had five different bedfellows.
 Having no doubt reaped a pretty good harvest during the week, he returned to
 his home on Monday; but such was the pretended effect produced by the
 different spells and witchcraft that tell upon him from his many dupes, that
 two of the young men who had been under his charge were obliged to obtain a
 horse and cart and carry him to the Hayle station. One of the men, having
 had 'two spells' resting on him, the 'wise man' was obliged to, sleep with
 him on Saturday and Sunday nights, having spent the whole of the Sunday in
 his diabolical work. It is time that the police, or some other higher
 authorities, should take the matter up, as the person alluded to is well
 known, and frequently visited by the ignorant and superstitious."</p>
 <p align="CENTER">THE CASE OF GROSS SUPERSTITION AT
 HAYLE.</p>
 <p>"In the <i>West Briton </i>of the 27th ult. we gave some
 particulars of several cases of disgraceful fraud and delusion which had
 been practised by a pretended 'wise man' from Illogan, and of gross
 superstition and gullibility on the part of his dupes. A correspondent has
 furnished us with the following particulars relative to the antecedents of
 the 'pretended conjurer. He states that James Thomas, the conjurer from the
 parish of Illogan, married, some titue since the late celebrated Tammy Blee,
 of Redruth, who afterwards removed to Helston and carried on as a
 fortune-teller, but parted from her husband, James Thomas, on account of a
 warrant for his apprehension having been issued against him by the
 magistrates of St Ivea, for attempting to take a spell from Mrs Paynter,
 through her husband, William Paynter, who stated before the magistrates that
 he wanted to commit a disgraceful offence. Thomas then absconded, and was
 absent from the west of Cornwall for upwards of two years. His wife then
 stated that the virtue was in her and not in him; that she was of the real
 'Pellar' blood; and that he could tell nothing but through her. His greatest
 dupes have been at St Just and Hayle, and other parts of the west of
 Cornwall. He has been in the habit of receiving money annually for keeping
 witchcraft from vessels sailing out of Hayle. He slept with several of his
 dupes recently; and about a fortnight since he stated that he must sleep
 with certain young men at Copperhouse, Hayle, in order to protect them from
 something that was hanging over them, one of them being a mason and another
 a miner, the two latter lately from St Just. He said himself this week at
 Truro that he had cured a. young man of St Erth, and was going on Saturday
 again to take a spell froth the father, a tin-smelter. He baa caused ka
 great disturbance amongst the neighbours, by charging some with having
 bewitched others. He is a drunken, disgraceful, beastly fellow, and ought to
 be sent to the treadmill. One of the young men is now thoroughly ashamed of
 himself to think he has been duped so by this scoundrel. We have purposely
 withheld the names of a number of Thomas's egregious dupes, with which our
 correspondent has furnished us, believing that the badgering which they have
 doubtless received from their friends has proved a sufficient punishment to
 them, and that their eyes are now thoroughly opened to the gross and
 disgraceful imposture that has been practised upon them."</p>
 <p>The following is from the <i>Western Morning News</i></p>
 
 <p align="CENTER">CALLING A WOMAN A WITCH.</p>
 <p>"At the Liskeard police court, on Monday, Harriet King
 appeared before the sitting magistrates charged with an assault on Elizabeth
 Wellington. The complainant had called the mother of defendant a witch, and
 said she had ill-wished a person, and the ill wish fell on the cat, and the
 cat died. This annoyed the daughter, who retaliated by bad words and blows.
 The magistrates expressed surprise at the cause of the assault, h as that
 had been proved, they fined defendant Is. and the costs, £1 in all.</p>
