 <p align="CENTER">ADDERS, AND THE MILPREVE</p>
 <p>
  THE country people around the Land's End say that in old I
 times no one could live in the low grounds, which were then covered with
 thickets, and these swarming with adders. Even at a much later period, in
 the summer-time, it was not safe to venture amongst the furze on the Downs without a <i>milpreve</i>. (I have never seen a milpreve; but it is
 described to me as being about the size of a pigeon's egg, and I am told
 that it is made by 'the adders when they get together in great numbers. Is
 it not pro­bable that the milpreve may be one of the madrepore corals--<i>
 millepore</i>-- found sometimes on the beaches around
 Land's End ?)</p>
 <p>
  A friend writes me :--" I was once
 shown a milpreve; it was nothing more than a beautiful ball of coralline
 lime-stone, the section of the coral being thought to be entangled young
 snakes."</p>
 <p>
  When some old men were streaming the
 "Bottoms" up near Partimey, they were often obliged to leave work on
 account of the number of adders that would get together as if by
 agreement, and advance upon them.</p>
 <p>
  One day one of the tin streamers chanced
 to leave his pot of milk, uncovered, out of the moor-house, when an adder
 got into it. The man cut a turf and put over the pot to prevent the
 reptile from escaping. In a few minutes the tinners saw "the ugly things
 crawling and leaping from all quarters towards the pot." The streamers
 were obliged to run, and take which way they would, the adders seemed to
 be coming from every direction, further and further off.</p>
 <p>
  At last "they formed a heap round the pot
 as large as a pook  [cock] of hay." Towards night all the reptiles were
 quite still then the men gathered together, around the mass of adders, a
 great  quantity of furze (being summer, there was plenty cut and dry
 close at hand), and piled it up like sheaves to make a mow, laying  a
 circle of well-dried turf without it. They then fired the turf on every
 side, and when it was well ignited, they fired the furze. "Oh,  it
 was a sight to see the adders when they felt the smoke and the flame !
 they began to boil, as it were, all in a heap, and fell back <br>
 into the flaming furze ; those which leaped through perishing on the
 brilliant ring of burning peat. Thus were killed thousands upon thousands
 of adders, and the moors were clear for a long,  long period."</p>
 <p>
 This is related nearly as the story was told ; but it appears necessary to
 make some allowance for that spirit of exaggeration which is a
 characteristic of all Celtic people, ere they have been  tutored to
 know the dignity of truth.<br>
 <br>
 The country people retaine a conceite, that the snakes, by  their
 breathing upon a hazel-wand, doe make a stone ring of blew colour, in
 which there appeareth the yellow figure of a snake, and  that beasts
 which are stung, being given to drink of the water wherein this stone hath
 bene socked, will there-through recover." [a]  This was clearly one
 of the so-called "Druidic rings,"-examples of which may be seen in our
 museums,-which have been found in  England and in Ireland. It is
 curious that at the glassworks of  Murano, near Venice, they still
 make rings, or beads, precisely  resembling the ancient ones, and
 these are used largely as money  in Africa.<br>
 <br>
 Snakes were formerly held in great reverence ; and Camden asserts that one
 of the prevailing superstitions concerning them was that, about
 midsummer-eve, they all met together in companies, and, joining their
 heads, began a general hiss, which they continued until a kind of bubble
 was formed, which immediately  hardened, and gave to the finder
 prosperity in all his undertakings. [b]</p>
 <p>
 Lhuyd, in a letter written in 1701, gives a curious account of the then
 superstitious character of the people in this district. " The Cornish
 retain variety of charms, and have still towards the Land's End the
 amulets of <i>Maen Magal</i> and <i>Glain-neider,</i> which latter they
 call a <i>Melprer</i>, a thousand worms, and have a charm  for the
 snake to make it, when they have found one asleep, and struck a hazel-wand
 in the centre of its <i>spirae</i>." Camden mentions <br>
 the use of snake-stones as a Cornish superstition.</p>
 <p>"The very same story, in fact, is told of the <i>Alder-stane</i>
 in the popular legends of the Scottish Lowlands, as Pliny records of the
 origin of the <i>Ovum Anguinum</i>. The various names by which these
 relics are designated all point to their estimation as amulets or
 superstitious charms; and the fact of their occurrence, most frequently
 singly, in the sepulchral cist or urn, seems to prove that it was as such,
 and not merely as personal ornaments, that they were deposited with the
 ashes of the dead. They are variously known as adder-beads,
 serpent-stones, Druidical beads; and, amongst the Welsh and Irish, by the
 synonymous terms of <i>Gleim na Droedh</i> and <i>Glaine nan Druidhe</i>,
 signifying the magician's or Druid's glass."--Wilson's Archaeology and
 Prehistoric Annals of Scotland, p. 304.</p>
