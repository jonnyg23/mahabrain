 THE LORD OF PENGERSWICK AND THE GIANT OF ST
 MICHAEL'S MOUNT.</p>
 <p><br>
 THE giant who dwelt on St Michael's Mount had grown very old, and had
 lost all his teeth; still he was the terror of the neighbouring villages. The
 horrid old monster--who had but one eye, and that one in the middle of his
 forehead--would, whenever he required food--which was pretty often--walk or
 wade across to Market-Jew, as the tide might be, select the best cow in the
 neighbourhood, and, swinging it over his shoulders, return to his island. This
 giant had often taken cattle from the Pengerswick estate; and one day he
 thought he should like another of this choice breed. Accordingly, away he
 went, across the sea, to Pengerswick Cove. The giant did not know that the
 lord of Pengerswick had returned from the East, a master of
 "white-witchcraft," or magic. The lord had seen the giant coming, and he began
 to work his spells. The giant was bewildered, yet he knew not how. At last,
 after much trouble, he caught a fine calf tied its four feet together, passed
 his great head between the fore and hind legs, and, with the calf hanging on
 his shoulders, he trod in joy towards the shore. He wandered on in perfect
 unconsciousness of the path, and eventually he found himself on the
 precipitous edge of the great black rock which still marks the western side of
 Pengerswick Cove. As if the rock had been a magnet, the giant was chained
 fast. He twisted, turned, and struggled in vain. He found himself gradually
 becoming stiff, so that at last he could neither move hand nor foot; yet were
 his senses more keenly alive than ever. The giant had to remain thus, during a
 long winter's night, with the calf bleating, as never calf bleated before,
 into his ear. In the morning when the enchanter thought he had punished the
 giant sufficiently, he mounted his mare, and rode down to the shore. He
 disenchanted the giant, by giving him a severe horse­whipping, and he then
 made him drop the calf. He continued to flog the giant until he leaped off the
 rock into the sea, through which in great agony he waded to the Mount; and
 from that day to this he has never ventured on the mainland.</p>
 <p>
  We learn, however, from undoubted
 authority, that some time after this, Tom, the giant of Lelant, visited the
 giant on the Mount, and, finding him half starved, he took his aunt Nancy from
 Gulval to see his friend, with a large supply of butter and eggs. The old
 giant was exceedingly glad to see the farmer's wife, bought all her store at a
 very extravagant price, and bargained and paid in advance for more. He had a
 store of wealth in the caverns of the Mount. The knowing old woman kept him
 well supplied as long as the giant had money to pay her; and aunt Nancy's
 family became the wealthiest in the parish of Gulval.</p>
