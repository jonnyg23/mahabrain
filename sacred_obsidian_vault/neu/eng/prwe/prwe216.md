 <p align="CENTER">SIR JOHN ARUNDELL.</p>
 <p>IN the first year of the reign of Edward IV., the brave
 Sir John Arundell dwelt on the north coast of Cornwall, at a place called
 Efford, on the coast near Stratton. He was a magistrate, and greatly
 esteemed amongst men for his honourable conduct. He had, however, in his
 official capacity, given offence to a wild shepherd, who had by some means
 acquired considerable influence over the minds of the people, under the
 impression of his possessing some supernatural powers. This man had been
 imprisoned by Arundell, and on his return home he constantly waylaid the
 knight, and, always looking threateningly at him, slowly muttered,--</p>
 <p>"When upon the yellow sand,<br>
 Thou shalt die by human hand."</p>
 <p>Notwithstanding the bravery of Sir John Arundell, he was
 not free from the superstitions of the period. He might, indeed, have been
 impressed with the idea that this man intended to murder him. It is,
 however, certain that he removed from Efford on the sands, to the wood-clad
 hills of Trerice, and here he lived for some years without the annoyance of
 meeting his old enemy. In the tenth year of Edward IV., Richard de Vere,
 Earl of Oxford, seized St Michael's Mount. Sir John Arundell, then sheriff
 of Cornwall, gathered together his own retainers and a large host of
 volunteers, and led them to the attack on St Michael's Mount. The retainers
 of the Earl of Oxford, on one occasion, left the castle, and made a sudden
 rush upon Arundell's followers, who were encamped on the sands near
 Marazion. Arundell then received his death-wound. Although he left Efford
 "to counteract the will of fate," the prophecy was fulfilled; and in his
 dying moments, it is said his old enemy appeared, singing joyously,-- </p>
 <p>"When upon the yellow sand,<br>
 Thou shalt die by human hand."</p>
