 <p align="CENTER">BEWITCHED CATTLE.</p>
 <p>FARMER, who possessed broad acres, and who was in many
 respects a sensible man, was greatly annoyed to find that his cattle became
 diseased in the spring. Nothing could satisfy him but that they were
 bewitched, and he was resolved to find out the person who had cast the evil
 eye on his oxen. According to an anciently prescribed rule, the farmer took
 one of his bullocks and bled it to death, catching all the blood on bundles
 of straw. The bloody straw was then piled into a heap, and set on fire.
 Burning with a vast quantity of smoke the farmer expected to see the witch
 either in reality or in shadow, amidst the smoke.</p>
 <p>In this particular case he was to some extent gratified.
 An old woman who lived in the adjoining village noticing the fire and smoke,
 --with all a woman's curiosity, - went to Farmer --'s field to see what was
 going on. She was instantly pounced on by this superstitious man, and he
 would no doubt have seriously ill-treated her, had not the poor, and now
 terrified, old soul, who roused her neighbours by her cries, been rescued by
 them. Every person knew this poor woman to be a most inoffensive and good
 creature, and consequently the farmer was only laughed at for sacrificing
 thus foolishly one of his oxen.</p>
 <p>Another farmer living in one of the western parishes was
 constantly losing his cattle in the spring. Many persons said this was
 because they were nearly starved during, the winter, but he insisted upon it
 that he was ill-wished, and that a blight was upon him.</p>
 <p>At length, to break the spell, and discover the witch, he
 betook himself to a conjurer' (white witch) who lived near the Lizard Point.
 This learned person, of whom several other facts are told in these pages,
 told the farmer to bleed the next animal when taken ill, and to receive the
 blood upon straw, being careful not to lose any of it. Then the straw and
 blood were to be burnt, and whilst the blood was burning he would be certain
 of seeing. the witch pass through the smoke.</p>
 <p>A young steer fell ill first; it was bled as ordered, the
 blood caught upon the straw, and both carefully burnt. While this was going
 on, female curiosity induced a poor weak old woman to go into the field and
 see what was going on. She was well known to all, and as guiltless as a
 child of ill-wishing anybody, but she was seen through the smoke, darted
 upon by the farmer, and cruelly ill-treated.</p>
