  </p>
 <p>ANNE JEFFERIES was the daughter of a poor labouring man,
 who lived in the parish of St Teath. She was born in 1626, and is supposed to
 have died in 1698.</p>
 <p>When she was nineteen years old, Anne, who was a remarkably
 sharp and clever girl, went to live as a servant in the family of Mr Moses
 Pitt. Anne was an unusually bold girl, and would do things which even boys
 feared to attempt. Of course, in those days every one believed in fairies, and
 everybody feared those little airy beings. They were constantly the talk of
 the people, and this set Anne longing anxiously to have an interview with some
 of them. So Anne was often abroad after sundown, turning up the fern leaves,
 and looking into the bells of the foxglove to find a fairy, singing all the
 time--</p>
 <p>"Fairy fair and fairy bright;<br>
 Come and be my chosen sprite."</p>
 <p>She never allowed a moonlight night to pass without going down
 into the valley, and walking against the stream, singing--</p>
 <p>"Moon shines bright, waters run clear,<br>
 I am here, but where's my fairy dear?"</p>
 <p>The fairies were a long time trying this poor girl; for, as
 they told her afterwards, they never lost sight of her; but there they would
 be, looking on when she was seeking them, and they would run from frond to
 frond of the ferns, when she was turning them up its her anxious search.</p>
 <p>One day Anne, having finished her morning's work, was
 sitting in the arbour in her master's garden, when she fancied she heard some
 one moving aside the branches, as though endeavouring to look in upon her; and
 she thought it must be her sweetheart, so she resolved to take no notice. Anne
 went on steadily with her work, no sound was heard but the regular beat of the
 knitting-needles one upon the other. Presently she heard a suppressed laugh,
 and then again a rustle amidst the branches. The back of the arbour was
 towards the lane, and to enter the garden it was necessary to walk down the
 lane to the gate, which was, however, not many yards off.</p>
 <p>Click, click went the needles, click, click, click. At last
 Anne began to feel vexed that the intruder did not show himself, and she
 pettishly said, half aloud --</p>
 <p>"You may stay there till the kueney [a] grows on the gate,
 ere I 'll come to 'ee."</p>
 <p>There was immediately a peculiar ringing and very music
 laugh. Anne knew this was not her lover's laugh, and she felt afraid. But it
 was bright day, and she assured herself that no one would do her any mischief,
 as she knew herself to be a general favourite in the parish. Presently Anne
 felt assured that the garden gate had been carefully opened and again closed,
 so she wait anxiously the result. In a few moments she perceived at the
 entrance of the arbour six little men, all clothed very handsome in green.
 They were beautiful little figures, and had very charming faces, and such
 bright eyes. The grandest of these little visitors, who wore a red feather in
 his cap, advanced in front the others, and, making a most polite bow to Anne,
 addressed her familiarly in the kindest words.</p>
 <p>This gentleman looked so sweetly on Anne that she was
 charmed beyond measure, and she put down her hand as if shake hands with her
 little friend, when he jumped into her palm and she lifted him into her lap.
 He then, without any more ad clambered upon her bosom and neck, and began
 kissing her. Anne never felt so charmed in her life as while this one little
 gentleman was playing with her; but presently he called his companion and they
 all clambered up by her dress as best they could, and kissed her neck, her
 lips, and her eyes. One of them ran his fingers over her eyes, and she felt as
 if they had been pricked with a pin. Suddenly Anne became blind, and she felt
 herself whirled through the air at a great rate. By and by, one of her little
 companions said something which sounded like "Tear away," and lo! Anne had
 her sight at once restored. She was in one of the most beautiful places --
 temples and palaces of gold and silver. Trees laden with fruits and flowers.
 Lakes full of gold and silver fish and the air full of birds of the sweetest
 song, and the more brilliant colours. Hundreds of ladies and gentlemen were
 walking about. Hundreds more were idling in the most luxurious bowers, the
 fragrance of the flowers oppressing them with sense of delicious repose.
 Hundreds were also dancing, engaged in sports of various kinds. Anne was,
 however, surprised to find that these happy people were no longer the small
 people she had previously seen. There was now no more than the difference
 usually seen in a crowd, between their height and her own. Anne found herself
 arrayed in the most highly-decorated clothes. So grand, indeed, did she
 appear, that she doubted her identity. Anne was constantly attended by her six
 friends; but the finest gentleman, who was the first to address her, continued
 her favourite, at which the others appeared to be very jealous. Eventually
 Anne and her favourite contrived to separate themselves, and they retired into
 some most lovely gardens, where they were hidden by the luxuriance of the
 flowers. Lovingly did they pass the time, and Anne desired that this should
 continue for ever. However, when they were at the happiest, there was heard a
 great noise, and presently the five other fairies at the head of a great crowd
 came after them in a violent rage. Her lover drew his sword to defend her, but
 this was soon beaten down, and he lay wounded at her feet. Then the fairy who
 had blinded her again placed his hands upon her eyes, and all was dark. She
 heard strange noises, and felt herself whirled about and about, and as if a
 thousand flies were buzzing around her.</p>
 <p>At length her eyes were opened, and Anne found herself on
 the ground in the arbour where she had been sitting in the morning, and many
 anxious faces were around her, all conceiving that she was recovering from a
 convulsion fit. [b]</p>
