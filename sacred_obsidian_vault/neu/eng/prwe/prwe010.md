 <p align="CENTER">HOLIBURN OF THE CAIRN. [a]</p>
 <p><br>
 HOLIBURN, according to tradition, was a very amiable and somewhat sociable
 gentleman; but, like his brethren, he loved to dwell amongst the rocks of
 Cairn Galva. He made his home in this remote region, and relied for his
 support on the gifts of sheep and oxen from the farmers around--he, in
 return, protecting them from the predatory incursions of the less
 conscientious giants of Trecrobben. It is said that he fought many a battle in
 the defence of his friends, and that he injured but one of his neighbours
 during his long lifetime. This was, however, purely an accident. The giant was
 at play with the human pigmies, and in the excitement of the moment, being
 delighted at the capital game made by a fine young peasant, he tapped him on
 the head, and scattered his brains on the grass. I once heard that Holiburn
 had married a farmer's daughter, and that a very fine race, still bearing a
 name not very dissimilar, was the result of this union. Holiburn, like his
 brethren, was remarkably fond of quoits; indeed, go where we will within the
 Land's End district, the "Giant's Quoit" is still shown. Other--shall we call
 them <i>household</i>--relics of the giants occur. From Cairn Galva to Zennor
 we find a series of "Giant's Chairs;" and, careful to preserve each remarkable
 relic ot this interesting race, here is also the "Giant's Dinner-plate." That
 St Ives, too, was not without its giant, although the record of his name is
 lost, is evident from the fact that a tooth, an inch broad, was taken from a
 "Giant's Grave." [b]</p>
 <p>[a] "Somewhere amongst the rocks in
 this cairn is the Giant's Cave--in ages long gone by the abode of a giant named
 Holiburn."--HALLIWELL. Mr Halliwell was fortunate in securing a name. I have
 often heard of the giant in question, but I never heard his name.</p>
 <p>[b] The following extract from a note
 written by the late Zennor postman and poet, shows how enduringly the giants
 have left their names on the rocks of Cornwall:--.</p>
 <p>"Some districts in Cornwall were said
 to have been peopled in olden times by giants, and even Zennor district
 possesses the largest quoit--three Logan rocks--whilst Trecrobben Hill still
 exhibits the bowl in which the giants of the west used to wash. The large
 granite boulder near to the residence of the Rev. Mr S--, curate of Morva, is
 said to be the Giant's Dinner plate. Farther down the hill, and hard by the
 Zennor vicarage, the Seats of the giants are still shown by the inhabitants,
 Indeed, so strong is the belief that giants inhabited the hills of the west,
 that a young lady in this neighbourhood essayed a month or two ago, to deliver a
 lecture, or address, on the subject, taking for her text, 'There were giants in
 those days.' But the giants were not immortal; colossal as were their frames,
 they too had to 'sleep with their fathers.' Whether Jack the Giant-killer took
 any part in ridding the earth of this wonderful race of men we cannot positively
 state; but thus much is certain, the giants were succeeded by a numerous race of
 small people, and so small as not to be observable by the eye."</p>
