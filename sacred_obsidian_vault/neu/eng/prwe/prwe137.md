 ST NEOT AND THE DOE.</p>
 <p>
  Again, on another day, when the hermit was in his fountain, a lovely doe,
 flying from the huntsmen, fell down on the edge of the well, imploring, 'with
 tearful eyes and anxious pantings, the aid of St Neot. The dogs followed in
 full chase, ready to pounce on the trembling doe, and eager to tear her in
 pieces. They saw the saint, and one look from his holy eyes sent them flying
 back into the wood, more speedily, if possible, than they rushed out of it.</p>
 <p>
  The huntsman too came on, ready to discharge his arrow into the heart of
 the doe; but, impressed with the sight he saw, he fell on his knees, cast away
 his quiver, and became from that day a follower of the saint's, giving him his
 horn to hang, as a memorial, in the church, where it was long to be seen. The
 huntsman be­came eventually one of the monks of the neighbouring house of St
 Petroch.</p>
