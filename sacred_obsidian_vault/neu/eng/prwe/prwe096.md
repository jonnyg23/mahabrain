 <p align="CENTER">THE GARRICK ZANS, OR HOLY ROCK.</p>
 <p>FEW years--really but a few years--since, the stone
 altars on which the first inhabitants of these islands lit their holy fires
 had yet a place amongst us. In the village of Roskestall stood one such altar;
 in Treen was to be found another. These huge masses of rock, rendered sacred
 by the memories surrounding them, have been wantonly removed, and employed in
 most cases in furnishing pillars at the "grand entrances" of the houses of the
 squire farmers of the Land's End district; or they have been yet more rudely
 served, and are to be found at the entrance to a pigsty, or in the gate-posts
 to a potato-field.</p>
 <p>The extinction of several of the old families is, to the
 present day, ascribed by the peasantry to the unholy act of removing or
 breaking up of the Garrick Zans in the village of Escols. The rock in the
 village of Mayon was called indifferently <i>table-mayon</i> (mön), or the
 Garrack Zans. Within our memory is the gathering of the villagers around the
 Holy Rock. It was their custom, when anything was stolen, or a misdemeanour
 committed, to light a fire on this altar, and when the fagots were in full
 blaze, all those who sought to prove their innocence took a burning stick from
 the rock and spat on the blazing end. If they could extinguish the fire by
 spitting on the stick, they were declared innocent; but if the mouth was so
 dry as not to generate sufficient moisture to be heard "frizzing" on it, that
 unfortunate individual was suspected, if not declared, to be guilty. [a] The
 Midsummer bonfire was first lighted on the rock in Escols, next on the Chapel 
 Hill; then all the other beacon hills were soon ablaze. Many superstitious
 rites were formerly performed on the Garrack Zans, which are only found now as
 the amusements of young people on the eves of St Agnes and Midsummer.</p>
 <p>[a] Boys at school, to prove the truth or falsehood of any
 charge, will take a stick from the fire and practise upon it in the same
 manner. May not the custom of joining hands and passing through the embers of
 a dying bonfire, for good luck, be a vestige of the same ritual?</p>
