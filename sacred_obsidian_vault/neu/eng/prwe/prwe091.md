 <p align="CENTER">THE SANDS AT LELANT AND PHILLACK.</p>
 <p>
  <br>
 THERE is a tradition that Lelant and Phillack towns were all meadow
 land, and that the whole was covered with sand in a single night. Also that
 the low tract of land extended on both sides of Hayle far beyond the present
 bar, so that the sea has swallowed up some hundreds of acres. The people say
 that the sight of the ancient church and village of Lelant was somewhere
 seaward of the Black Rock;--the ancient burial-ground has been long washed
 away,--and that human teeth are still frequently found on the shore after a
 great <i>undertoe</i>, that takes the sand out to sea. Many circumstances seem
 to confirm the probability of the tradition. The sand was drifting inland at
 such a rate before the reed-like plant called by the present inhabitants the
 <i>spire</i> was planted, that the whole of the land about the village would
 have been rendered worthless ere this, but for the stability given to it. The
 land from which the sand has been cleared, on the sea side of the church, has
 evidently been ploughed, as the furrows are quite apparent between the ridges.
 They say that there was a market held in Lelant when St Ives was scarcely a
 village. Lelant being the mother church, would seem to prove this. One can
 easily understand how a large tract of land of the nature of that under Lelant
 sand-hills would be washed away in a comparatively short time, as the soil at
 the low-water level is a many clay. This is constantly being washed down by
 high tides, and carried away by the undercurrent, as it contains no stone to
 form a pebbly beach, and therefore there is nothing left to protect the shore.</p>
