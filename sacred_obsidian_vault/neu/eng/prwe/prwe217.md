 <p align="CENTER">PHANTOMS OF THE DYING.</p>
 <p>GAY party were assembled one afternoon, in the latter
 days of January, in the best parlour of a farmhouse near the Land's-End. The
 inhabitants of this district were, in many respects, peculiar. Nearly all
 the land was divided up between, comparatively, a few owners, and every
 owner lived on and farmed his own land.</p>
 <p>This circumstance, amongst others, led to a certain
 amount of style in many of the old farmhouses of the Land's-End district;
 and even now, in some of them, from which, alas! the. glory has departed,
 may be seen the evidences of taste beyond that which might have been
 expected in so remote a district.</p>
 <p>The "best parlour" was frequently panelled with carved
 oak, and the ceiling, often highly, though it must be admitted, heavily
 decorated. In such a room, in the declining light of a January afternoon,
 were some ten or a dozen farmers' daughters, all of them unmarried, and many
 of them having an eye on the farmer's eldest son, a fine, young man about
 twenty years of age, called Joseph.</p>
 <p>This farmer and his wife, at the time of which we speak,
 had three sons and two daughters. The eldest son was an excellent and
 amiable young man, possessed of many personal attractions, and especially
 fond of the society of his sisters and their friends. The next son was of a
 very different stamp, and was more frequently found in the inn at
 Church-town than in his father's house; the younger son was an apprentice at
 Penzance. The two daughters, Mary and Honour, had coaxed their mother into
 "a tea and heavy cake" party, and Joseph was especially retained, to be, as
 every one said he was, "the life of the company."</p>
 <p>In those days, when, especially in those parts, every one
 took dinner at noon, and tea not much after four o'clock, the party had
 assembled early.</p>
 <p>There had been the usual preliminary gossip amongst the
 young people, when they began to talk about the wreck of a fruit-ship, which
 had occurred but a few days before, off the Land's-End, and it was said that
 considerable quantities of oranges were washing into Nangisseil Cove. Upon
 this, Joseph said he would take one of the, men from the farm, and go down
 to the Cove--which was not far off--and see if they could not find some
 oranges for the ladies.</p>
 <p>The day had faded into twilight, the western sky was
 still bright with the light of the setting sun, and the illuminated clouds
 shed a certain portion of their splendour into the room in which the party
 were assembled. The girls were divided up into groups, having their own
 pretty little bits of gossip, often truly delightful from its entire freedom
 and its innocence; and the mother oI Joseph was seated near the fireplace,
 looking with some anxiety through the windows, from which you commanded a
 view of the Atlantic Ocean. The old lady was restless; sometimes she had to
 whisper something to Mary, and then some other thing to Honour. Her anxiety,
 at length, was expressed in her wondering where Joseph could be tarrying so
 long. All the young ladies sought to ease her mind by saying that there were
 no doubt so many orange-gatherers in the Cove, that Joseph and the man could
 not get so much fruit as he desired.</p>
 <p>Joseph was the favourite son of 'his mother, and her
 anxiety evidently increased. Eventually, starting from her 'chair, the old
 lady exclaimed, "Oh, here he is; now I 'll see about the tea."</p>
 <p>With a pleased smile on her face, she left the room, to
 return, however, to it in deeper sorrow.</p>
 <p>The mother expected to meet her son at the door--he came
 not. Thinking that he might possibly have beep wetted by the sea, and that
 he had gone round the house to another door leading directly into the
 kitchen, for the purpose of drying himself or of changing his boots, she
 went into the dairy to fetch the basin of clotted cream,--which had been
 "taken up" with unusual care,--to see if the junket was properly set, and
 to spread the flaky cream thickly upon its surface.</p>
 <p>Strange,--as the old lady subsequently related,--all
 the pans of milk were agitated--" the milk rising up and down like the waves
 of the sea."</p>
 <p>The anxious mother returned to the parlour with her basin
 of cream, but with an indescribable feeling of an unknown terror. She
 commanded herself, and, in her usual quiet way, asked if Joseph had been in.
 When they answered her "No," she sighed heavily, and sank senseless into a
 chair.</p>
 <p>Neither Joseph nor the servant ever returned alive. They
 were seen standing together upon a rock, stooping to gather oranges as they
 came with each wave up to their feet, when one of the heavy swells--the
 lingering undulations of a tempest, so well known on this coast--came
 sweeping onward, and carried them both away in its- cave of waters, as the
 wave curved to engulf them.</p>
 <p>The undertow of the tidal current was so strong that,
 though powerful men and good swimmers, they were carried at once beyond all
 human aid, and speedily perished.</p>
 <p>The house of joy became a house of mourning, and sadness
 rested on it for years. Day after day passed by, and, although a constant
 watch was kept along the coast, it was not until the fated ninth day that
 the bodies were discovered, and they were then found in a sadly mutilated
 state.</p>
 <p>Often after long years, and when the consolations
 derivable from pure religious feeling had brought that tranquillity upon the
 mind of this loving mother,--which so much resembles the poetical repose of
 an autumnal evening,--has she repeated to me the sad tale.</p>
 <p>Again and again have I heard her declare that she saw
 Joseph, her son, as distinctly as ever she saw him in her life, and that, as
 he passed the parlour windows, he looked in upon her and smiled.</p>
 <p>This is not given as a superstition belonging in any
 peculiar way to Cornwall. In every part of the British Isles it exists; but
 I have never met with any people who so firmly believed in the appearance of
 the phantoms of the dying to those upon whom the last thoughts are centred,
 as the Cornish did.</p>
 <p>Another case is within my knowledge. </p>
 <p>A lady, the wife of an officer in the navy, had been with
 her husband's sister, on a summer evening, to church. The husband was in the
 Mediterranean, and there was no reason to expect his return for many months.</p>
 <p>These two ladies returned home, and the wife, ascending
 the; stairs before her sister-in, law, went into the drawing-room--her
 intention being to close the windows, which, as the weather had been warm
 and fine, had been thrown open.</p>
 <p>She had proceeded about half way across the room, when
 she shrieked, ran back, and fell into her sister-in-law's arms. Upon
 recovery, she stated that a figure, like that of her husband, enveloped in a
 mist, appeared to her to fill one of the windows.</p>
 <p>By her friends, the wife's fancies were laughed at; and,
 if not forgotten, the circumstance was no longer spoken of.</p>
 <p>Month after month glided by, without intelligence of the
 ship to which that officer belonged. At length the Government became
 anxious, and searching inquiries were made. Some time still elapsed, but
 eventually it was ascertained that this sloop of war had perished in a white
 squall, in which she became involved, near the Island of Mitylene, in the
 Grecian Archipelago, on the Sunday evening when the widow fancied she saw
 her husband.</p>
