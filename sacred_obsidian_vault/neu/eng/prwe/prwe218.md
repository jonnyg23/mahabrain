 <p align="CENTER">THE WHITE HARE</p>
 <p>IT is a very popular fancy that when a maiden, who has
 loved not wisely but too well, dies forsaken and broken-hearted, that she
 comes back to haunt her deceiver in the shape of a white hare.</p>
 <p>This phantom follows the false one everywhere, mostly
 invisible to all but him. It sometimes saves him from danger, but invariably
 the white hare causes the death of the betrayer in the end.</p>
 <p>The following story of the white hare is a modification
 of several tales of the same kind which have been told me. Many, many years
 have passed away, and all who were in any way connected with my story have
 slept for generations in the quiet churchyard of --.</p>
 <p>A large landed proprietor engaged a fine, handsome young
 fellow to manage his farm, which was a very extensive as well- as a
 high-class one. When the young farmer was duly settled in his new farmhouse,
 there came to live with him, to take the management of the dairy, a
 peasant's daughter. She was very handsome, and of a singularly fine figure,
 but entirely without education.</p>
 <p>The farmer became desperately in love with this young
 creature, and eventually their love passed all the bounds of discretion. It
 became the policy of the young farmer's family to put down this unfortunate
 passion, by substituting a more legitimate and endearing object</p>
 <p>After a long trial, they thought they were successful,
 and the young farmer was married.</p>
 <p>Many months had not passed away when the discharged dairy
 maid was observed to suffer from illness, which, however, she constantly
 spoke of as nothing; but knowing dames saw too clearly the truth. One
 morning there was found in a field a newly-born babe strangled. The
 unfortunate girl was at once suspected as being the parent, and the evidence
 was soon sufficient to charge her with the murder. She was tried, and,
 chiefly by the evidence of the young farmer and his family, convicted of,
 and executed for, the murder.</p>
 <p>Everything now went wrong in the farm, and the young man
 suddenly left it and went into another part of the country.</p>
 <p>Still nothing prospered, and gradually he took to drink
 to drown some secret sorrow. He was more frequently on the road by night
 than by day; and, go where he would, a white hare was constantly crossing
 his path. The white hare was often seen by others, almost always under the
 feet of his horse; and the poor terrified animal would go like the wind to.
 avoid the strange apparition.</p>
 <p>One morning the young farmer was found drowned in a
 forsaken mine; and the horse, which had evidently suffered extreme terror,
 was grazing near the corpse. Beyond all doubt the white hare, which is known 
 to hunt the perjured and the false-hearted to death, had terrified the horse
 to such a degree, that eventually the rider was thrown into the mine-waste
 in which the body was found.</p>
