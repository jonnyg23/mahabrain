 <p align="CENTER">THE TWELVE-O'CLOCK STONE.</p>
 <p><br>
 NUMBERS of people would formerly visit a remarkable Logan stone, near
 Nancledrea, which had been, by supernatural power, impressed with some
 peculiar sense at midnight. Although it was quite impossible to move this
 stone during daylight, or indeed by human power at any other time, it would
 rock like a cradle exactly at midnight. Many a child has been cured of rickets
 by being placed naked at this hour on the twelve-o'clock stone. If, however,
 the child was "misbegotten," or, if it was the offspring of dissolute parents,
 the stone would not move, and consequently no cure was effected. On the Cuckoo
 Hill, eastward of Nancledrea, there stood, but a few years since, two piles of
 rock about eight feet apart, and these were united by a large flat stone
 carefully placed upon them,--thus forming a doorway which was, as my
 informant told me, "large and high enough to drive a horse and cart through."
 It was formerly the custom to march in procession through this "doorway" in
 going to the twelve-o'clock stone.</p>
 <p>The stone-mason has, however, been busy hereabout; and
 every mass of granite, whether rendered notorious by the Giants or holy by the
 Druids, if found to be of the size required, has been removed. [a]</p>
 <p>[a] The following are a few of the
 interesting remains of old Cornwall which have entirely disappeared from the
 neighbourhood within a few years--</p>
 <p>Between St Ives and Zennor, on the
 lower road over Tregarthen Down and a Logan rock. An old man, perhaps ninety
 years of age, told me he had often logged it, and that it would make a noise
 which could be heard for miles.</p>
 <p>At Balnoon, between Nancledrea and
 Knill's Steeple, some miners came upon "two slabs of granite cemented together,"
 which covered a walled grave three feet square--an ancient kistvean. In it they
 found an earthenware vessel containing some black earth, and a leaden spoon. The
 spoon was given to Mr Praed of Trevetha, and may possibly be in the possession
 of the present proprietor. The kistvean was utterly destroyed.</p>
 <p>At Brunnion, not far from St Ives, in
 the garden attached to the house which is occupied by the Hoskings, is an arched
 doorway of carefully-worked granite. Tradition said this doorway belonged to an
 ancient church, and that the present garden was the burial-ground. Close by, at
 Treveerack, is a field known as the "Chapel Field," in which the plough is
 constantly turning up stones which have been carefully chiselled.</p>
 <p>In Bosprenis Croft there was a very
 large colt or cromlech. It is said to have been fifteen feet square, and not
 more than one foot thick in any part. This was broken in two parts some years
 since, and taken to Penzance to form the beds for two ovens.</p>
