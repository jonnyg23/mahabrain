 <p align="CENTER">PRUSSIA COVE AND SMUGGLERS' HOLES</p>
 <p>SMUGGLERS' hiding-places (now, of course, unused) are
 numerous. On the banks of the Helford river are several, and two or three
 have lately been discovered on the coast about St Keverne by the falling in
 of their roofs. In a part of Penzance harbour, nine years ago, a
 hiding-place of this kind was discovered; it still contained one or two
 kegs, and the skeleton of a man, with his clothes in good preservation. It
 is presumed that the poor fellow while intoxicated was shut in, and the
 place never more opened by his companions. Speaking of Penzance,--about
 fifty years since, in the back of the harbour, was an old adit called "Gurmer's
 Hole," and in the cliff over its entrance, <i>on a dark night, </i>a
 phosphorescent appearance was always visible from the opposite side. It
 could not be seen from beneath, owing to the projection of the face of the
 cliff. A fall of the part taking place, the phenomenon disappeared.</p>
 <p>Sixty or seventy years since, a native of Breage called"
 Carter," but better known, from a most remarkable personal resemblance to
 Frederick the Great, as the "King of Prussia," monopolised most of the
 smuggling trade of the west. By all accounts he was a man of uncommon mental
 power, and chose as the seat of his business a sequestered rocky cove about
 two miles east of Marazion, which continues to bear the name of " Prussia
 Cove," and where deep channels, cut in hard rock, to allow of the near
 approach of their boats, still show the determination of the illicit
 traders. Although constantly visited by the excise officers, the "king"
 rarely failed to remove his goods, the stocks of which were at times very
 large, suffering for a long period comparatively little from "seizures." On
 one occasion his boats, while landing a cargo, being hard pressed by the
 revenue cutter, Carter had some old cannon brought to the edge of the cliff
 and opened fire on the unwelcome intruder, and after a short but sharp
 engagement, fairly beat her off. The cutter was, of course, back again early
 in the morning, and part of the crew, with the captain, landed; the only
 traces, however, of the engagement to be seen was the trampled ground. On
 approaching Carter's house, the officer was met by the "king" himself, with
 an angry remonstrance about practising the cutter's guns at midnight so near
 the shore, and disturbing his family at such unseemly hours. Although the
 principal parties concerned were well known, no evidence could be obtained,
 and the matter was allowed to drop. Toward the close of his career Carter
 "ventured" in larger ships, became less successful, and was at last
 exchequered. He died, at a very advanced age, in poor circumstances.</p>
