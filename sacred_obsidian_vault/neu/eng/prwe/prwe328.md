 <p align="CENTER">SAINT GERENNIUS</p>
 <p>THIS reached me, at too late a period to be included with
 the legends of the saints <b>:--</b></p>
 
 <p>"The beacon at Veryan stands on the highest ground in
 Roseland, at a short distance from the cliff which overlooks Pendower
 and Gerrans Bay. Dr Whitaker, in his 'Cathedral of Cornwall,' states <b>
 it </b>to be one of the largest tumuli in the kingdom. Its present
 height above the level of the field in which it stands is about
 twenty-eight feet, and its circumference at the base three hundred and
 fifty feet; but <b>it </b>must have been originally much larger, as a
 considerable portion on one side has been removed, its summit being now
 about' eighty feet from the base on the south side, and only fifty feet
 on the north, whilst the top of the cairn which was discovered in <b>it,
 </b>and which 'was, no doubt, placed exactly in the original centre of
 the mound, is at least ten feet still farther north than the present
 summit.</p>
 <p>"A<b> </b>tradition has been preserved in the
 neighbourhood, that Gerennius, an old Cornish saint and king, whose
 palace stood on the other side of Gerrans Bay, between Trewithian and
 the sea, was buried in this mound many centuries ago, and that a golden
 boat with silver oars were used in conveying his corpse across the hay,
 and were interred with him. Part of this tradition receives confirmation
 from an account incidentally given of King Gerennius, in an old book
 called the 'Register of Llandaff.' It is there stated that, A.D<b>. </b>
 588, Teliau, bishop of Llandaff, with some of his suffragan bishops, and
 many of his followers, fled from Wales, to escape an epidemic called the
 yellow plague, and migrated to Dole in Brittany, to visit Sampson, the
 archbishop of that place, who was a countryman and friend of Teliau's.
 'On his way thither,' says the old record, 'he came first to the region
 of Cornwall, and was well received by Gerennius, the king of that
 country, who treated him and his people with all honour. From thence he
 proceeded to Armories, and remained there seven years and seven months;
 when, hearing that the plague had ceased in Britain, he collected his
 followers, -caused a large bark to be prepared, and returned to Wales.'
 'In this,' the record proceeds, 'they all arrived at the port called
 Din.Gerein, king Gerennius lying in the last extreme of life, who when
 he had received the body of the Lord from the hand of St Teliau,
 departed in joy to the Lord.' 'Probably,' says Whitaker, in his remarks
 on this quotation, 'the royal remains were brought in great pomp by
 water from Din-Gerein, on the western shore of the port, to Came, about
 two miles off on the northern; the barge with the royal body was plated,
 perhaps, with gold in places; perhaps, too, rowed with oars having
 equally plates of silver upon them; and the pomp of the procession has
 mixed confusedly with the interment of the body in the memory of
 tradition.' "</p>
