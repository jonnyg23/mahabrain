 <p align="CENTER">MADDERN OR MADRON WELL.</p>
 <p>"Plunge thy right hand in St Maciron's spring, <br>
 If true to its troth be the palm you bring;<br>
 But if a false digit thy fingers bear,<br>
 Lay them at once on the burning share."</p>
 <p>OF the holy well at St Maddern, Carne [a] writes thus --</p>
 <p>"It has been contended that a virgin was the patroness of
 this church--that she was buried at Minster--and that many miracles were
 performed at her grave. A learned commentator, however, is satisfied that it
 was St Motran, who was one of the large company that came from Ireland with St
 Buriana, and he was slain at the mouth of the Hayle; the body was begged, and
 afterwards buried here. Near by was the miraculous Well of St Maddern, over
 which a chapel was built, so sacred was it held, (This chapel was destroyed by
 the fanaticism of Major Ceely in the days of Cromwell.) It stood at no great
 distance on the moor, and the soil around it was black and boggy, mingled with
 a gray moorstone. . . .</p>
 <p>"The votaries bent awfully and tremblingly over its sedgy
 bank, and gazed on its clear bosom for a few minutes ere they proved the fatal
 ordeal; then an imploring look was cast towards the figure of St Motran, many
 a crossing was repeated, and at last the pin or pebble held aloof was dropped
 into the depth beneath. Often did the rustic beauty fix her eye intently on
 the bubbles that rose, and broke, and disappeared; for in that moment the
 lover was lost, or the faithful husband gained. It was only on particular
 days, however, according to the increase or decrease of the moon, that the
 hidden virtues of the well were consulted." [b]</p>
 <p>Of this well we have the following notice by William
 Scawen, Esq., Vice-Warden of the Stannaries. The paper from which we extract
 it was first printed by Davies Gilbert, Esq., F.R.S., as an appendix to his
 "Parochial History of Cornwall." Its complete title is, "Observations on an
 Ancient Manuscript, entitled 'Passio Christo," written in the Cornish
 Language, and now preserved in the Bodleian Library; with an Account of the
 Language, Manners, and Customs of the People of Cornwall, (from a Manuscript
 in the Library of Thomas Artle, Esq., 1777)" --</p>
 <p>"Of St Mardren's Well (which is a parish west to the
 Mount), a fresh true story of two persons, both of them lame and decrepit,
 thus recovered from their infirmity. These two persons, after they had applied
 themselves to divers physicians and chirurgeons, for cure, and finding no
 success by them, they resorted to St Mardren's Well, and according to the
 ancient custom which they had heard of, the same which was once in a year--to
 wit, on Corpus Christi evening--to lay some small offering on the altar
 there, and to lie on the ground all night, drink of the water there, and in
 the morning after to take a good draught more, and to take and carry away some
 of the water, each of them in a bottle, at their departure. This course these
 two men followed, and within three weeks they found the effect of it, and, by
 degrees their strength increasing, were able to move themselves on crutches.
 The year following they took the same course again, after which they were able
 to go with the help of a stick; and at length one of them, John Thomas, being
 a fisherman, was, and is at this day, able to follow his fishing craft. The
 other, whose name was William Cork, was a soldier under the command of my
 kinsman, Colonel William Godolphin (as he has often told me), was able to
 perform his duty, and died in the service of his majesty King Charles. But
 herewith take also this :-- </p>
 <p>"One Mr Hutchens, a person well known in those parts, and
 now lately dead, being parson of Ludgvan, a near neighbouring parish to St
 Mardren's Well, he observed that many of his parishioners often frequented,
 this well superstitiously, for which he reproved them privately, and sometimes
 publicly, in his sermons; but afterwards he, the said Mr Hutchens, meeting
 with a woman coming from the well with a bottle in her hand, desired her
 earnestly that he might drink thereof, being then troubled with colical pains,
 which accordingly he did, and was eased of his infirmity. The latter story is
 a full confutation of the former; for, if the taking the water accidentally
 thus prevailed upon the party to his cure, as it is likely it did, then the
 miracle which was intended to be by the ceremony of lying on the ground and
 offering is wholly fled, and it leaves the virtue of the water to be the true
 cause of the cure. And we have here, as in many places of the land, great
 variety of salutary springs, which have diversity of<i> </i>operations, which
 by natural reason have been found to be productive of good effects, and not by
 miracle, as the vain fancies of monks and friars have been exercised in
 heretofore."</p>
 <p>Bishop Hale, of Exeter, in his "Great Mystery of
 Godliness," says --</p>
 <p>"Of which kind was that noe less than miraculous cure,
 which, at St Maddern's Well, in Cornwall, was wrought upon a poore cripple;
 whereof, besides the attestation of many hundreds of the neighbours, I tooke a
 strict and impartial examination in my last triennial visitation there. This
 man, for sixteen years, was forced to walke upon his hands, by reason of the
 sinews of his Ieggs were soe contracted that he cold not goe or walke on his
 feet, who upon monition in a dream to wash in that well, which accordingly he
 did, was suddainly restored to the use of his limbs; and I sasve him both able
 to walk and gett his owne maintenance. I found here was neither art nor
 collusion,--the cure done, the author our invisible God," &amp;c.</p>
 <p>In Madron Well--and, I have no doubt, in many others--may
 be found frequently the pins which have been dropped by maidens desirous of
 knowing "when they were to be married." I once witnessed the whole ceremony
 performed by a group of beautiful girls, who had walked on a May morning from
 Penzance. Two pieces of straw, about an inch long each, were crossed and the
 pin run through them. This cross was then dropped into the water, and the
 rising bubbles carefully counted, as they marked the number of years which
 would pass ere the arrlval of the happy day. This practice also prevailed
 amongst the visitors to the well at the foot of Monacuddle Grove, near St
 Austell.</p>
 <p>On approaching the Waters, each visitor is expected to
 throw in a crooked pin; and, if you are lucky, you may possibly see the other
 pins rising from the bottom to meet the most recent offering. Rags and- votive
 offerings to the genius of the waters are hung around many of the wells. Mr
 Couch says :-- "At Maciron Well, near Penzance, I observed the custom of
 hang-jog rags on the thorns which grew in the enclosure."</p>
 <p>Crofton Croker tells us the same custom prevails in
 Ireland; and Dr O'Connor, in his "Travels in Persia," describes the prevalence
 of this custom.</p>
 <p>Mr Campbell,[c] on this subject, writes :--" Holy healing
 wells are common all over the Highlands, and people still leave offerings of
 pins and nails, and bits of rag, though few would confess it. There is a well
 in Islay where I myself have, after drinking, deposited copper caps amongst a
 hoard of pins and buttons, and similar gear, placed in chinks in the rocks and
 trees at the edge of the 'Witches' Well.' There is another well with similar
 offerings freshly placed beside it, in an island in Loch Maree, in Ross-shire,
 and many similar wells are to be found in other places in Scotland. For
 example, I learn from Sutherland that a well in the Black Isle of Cromarty.,
 near Rosehaugh, has miraculous healing powers. A country woman tells me, that
 abput forty years ago, she remembers it being surrounded by a crowd of people
 every first Tuesday its June, who bathed and drank of it before sunrise. Each
 patient tied a string or rag to one of the trees that overhung it before
 leaving. It was sovereign for headaches. Mr--remembers to have seen a well
 here, called Mary's Well, hung round with votive rags.'"</p>
 <p>Well-worship is mentioned by Martin. The custom, in his
 day, in the Hebrides, was to walk south round about the well.</p>
 <p>Sir William Betham, in his "Gael and Cymbri" (Dublin: W.
 Curry, Jun., &amp; Co., 1834), says, at page 235 :-- "The Celtae were much addicted
 to the worship of fountains and rivers as divinities. They had a deity called
 Divona, or the river-god."</p>
