 <p align="CENTER">THE PARSON AND CLERK.</p>
 <p>NEAR Dawlish stand, out in the sea, two rocks, of red
 sand-stone conglomerate, to which the above name is given.</p>
 <p>Seeing that this forms a part of Old Cornwall, I do not
 go beyond my limits in telling the true story of these singular rocks.</p>
 <p>The Bishop of Exeter was sick unto death at Dawlish. An
 ambitious priest, from the east, frequently rode with his clerk to make
 anxious inquiries after the condition of the dying bishop. It is whispered
 that this priest had great hopes of occupying the bishop's throne in Exeter
 Cathedral.</p>
 <p>The clerk was usually the priest's guide; but somehow or
 other, on a particularly stormy night, he lost the road, and they were
 wandering over Haldon. Excessively angry was the priest, and very provoking
 was the clerk. He led his master this way and that way, but they were yet
 upon the elevated country of Haldon.</p>
 <p>At length the priest, in a great rage, exclaimed, " I
 would rather have the devil for a guide than you." Presently the clatter of
 horse's hoofs were heard, and a peasant, on a moor pony, rode up. The priest
 told of his condition, and the peasant volunteered to guide them. On rode
 peasant, priest, and clerk, and presently they were at Dawlish. The night
 was tempestuous, the ride had quickened the appetite of the priest, and he
 was wet through,--therefore, when his friend asked him to supper, as they
 approached an old ruined house, through the windows of which bright lights
 were shining, there, was no hesitation in accepting the invitation.</p>
 <p>There were a host of friends gathered together--a
 strange, wild-looking lot of men. But as the tables were laden with
 substantial dishes, and black-jacks were standing thick around, the parson,
 and the clerk too, soon made friends with all.</p>
 <p>They ate and drank, and became most irreligiously
 uproarious. The parson sang hunting songs, and songs in praise of a certain
 old gentleman, with whom a priest should not have maintained any
 acquaintance. These were very highly appreciated, and every man joined
 loudly in the choruses. Night wore away, and at last news was brought that
 the bishop was dead. This appeared to rouse up the parson, who was only too
 eager to get the first intelligence, and go to work to secure the hope of
 his ambition. So master and man mounted their horses, and bade adieu to
 their hilarious friends.</p>
 <p>They were yet at the door of the mansion--somehow or
 other the horses did not appear disposed to move. They were whipped and
 spurred, but to no purpose.</p>
 <p>"The devil 's in the horses," said the priest.</p>
 <p>"I b'lieve he is," said the clerk.</p>
 <p>"Devil or no devil, they shall go," said the parson,
 cutting his horse madly with his heavy whip.</p>
 <p>There was a roar of unearthly laughter.</p>
 <p>The priest looked round--his drinking friends were all
 turned into demons, wild with glee, and the peasant guide was an arch little
 devil, looking on with a marvelously curious twinkle in his eyes. The noise
 of waters was around them; and now the priest discovered that the mansion
 had disappeared, and that waves beat heavy upon his horse's flanks, and
 rushed over the smaller horse of his man.</p>
 <p>Repentance was too late.</p>
 <p>In the morning following this stormy night, two horses
 were found straying on the sands at Dawlish; and clinging with the grasp of
 death to two rocks, were found the parson and the clerk, There stand the
 rocks to which the devil had given the forms of horses--an enduring
 monument to all generations.</p>
