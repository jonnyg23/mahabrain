 <p align="CENTER">THE SAILOR WIZARD.</p>
 <p>THIS appears to have been, and it may still be, a very
 common superstition. I have lately received from Mr T. Q. Couch of Bodmin
 the story of some sailors, who had reason to suspect that one of their body
 was a wizard. This was eventually proved to have been the case, by
 circumstances in every way resembling those of our old witch. There had been
 a quarrel, and revenge had been talked of. The sailors were all grouped
 together in the forepart of the ship, except the suspected one, and a toad
 fell sprawling amongst them. One of the men flung the creature into the fire
 in the caboose. It struggled for a moment in the fire, and then by a
 convulsive effort flung itself out. Immediately the toad was caught up by
 one of the men, and flung into the sea.</p>
 <p>In the course of some little time the absent sailor made his
 appearance dripping wet. In a drunken frolic he had first fallen into the
 fire at a low beer shop or "Kiddle-e-wink," and subsequently he fell out of
 the boat into the sea.</p>
