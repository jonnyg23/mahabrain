 <p align="CENTER">TREWA, OR TREWE, THE HOME OF WITCHES.</p>
 <p>AS we walk from Nancledrea Bottoms towards Zennor we pass
 Trewa (pronounced <i>Truee), </i>which is said to have been the place where
 at Midsummer all the witches of the west met. Here are the remains of very
 ancient tin stream works, and these, I<i> </i>was informed, "were the
 remains of bals which had been worked before the deluge; there was nothing
 so old anywhere else in Cornwall." Around us, on the hill-sides and up the
 bottoms~ huge boulders of granite are most fantastically scattered. All
 these rocks sprang from the ground at the call of the giants. At Embla Green
 we still see the ruins of the Giant's House, but all we know of this Titan
 is that he was the king. On one side we have the "Giant's Well," and not far
 off the "Druid's Well," and a little before us is Zennor coit or cromlech.</p>
 <p>From this point the scenery is of the wildest
 description. The granite cairns are spread around in every direction, and
 many of those masses are so strangely fashioned by the atmospheric
 influences ever acting on them, that fancy can readily fashion them into
 tombs and temples. Rock basins abound on these hills, and of ruined
 cromlechs there are many. Whatever the local historians may say, local
 traditions assure us that on Midsummer Eve all the witches in Penwith
 gathered here, and that they lit fires on every cromlech, and in every rock
 basin, until the' hills were alive with flame, and renewed their vows to the
 evil ones from whom they derived their power. Hence, to this day this place
 is called Burn Downs. Amidst these rock masses there was one pile remarkable
 amidst all the others for its size, and--being formed of cubical masses--
 for its square character. This was known as the Witches' Rock, and here it
 was said they assembled at midnight to carry on their wicked deeds. This
 rock has been removed, and with it the witches have died; the last real
 witch in Zennor having passed away, as I have been told, about thirty years
 since, and with her, some say, the fairies fled. I have, however, many
 reasons for believing that our little friends have still a few 'haunts in
 this locality. There is but one reason why we should regret the
 disappearance of the Witches' Rock. <i>Any one touching this rock nine times
 at midnight was insured against bad luck.</i></p>
