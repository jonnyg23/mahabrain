 <p align="CENTER">THE SPECTRE BRIDEGROOM.</p>
 <p>LONG, long ago a farmer named Lenine lived in Boscean. He
 had but one son, Frank Lenine, who was indulged into waywardness by both his
 parents. In addition to the farm servants, there was one, a young girl,
 Nancy Trenoweth, who especially assisted Mrs Lenine in all the various
 duties of a small farmhouse.</p>
 <p>Nancy Trenoweth was very pretty, and although perfectly
 uneducated, in the sense in which we now employ the term education, she
 possessed many native graces, and she had acquired much knowledge, really
 useful to one whose aspirations would probably never rise higher than to be
 mistress of a farm of a few acres. Educated by parents who had certainly
 never seen the world beyond Penzance, her ideas of the world were limited to
 a few miles around the Land's End. But although her book of nature was a
 small one, it had deeply impressed her mind with its influences. The wild
 waste, the small but fertile valley, the rugged hills, with their crowns of
 cairns, the moors rich in the golden furze and the purple heath, the
 sea-beaten cliffs, and the silver sands, were the pages she had studied,
 under the guidance of a mother who conceived, in the sublimity of her
 ignorance, that everything in nature was the home of some spirit form. The
 soul of the girl was imbued with the deeply religious dye of her mother's
 mind, whose religion was only a sense of an unknown world immediately beyond
 our own. The elder Nancy Trenoweth exerted over the villagers around her
 considerable power. They did not exactly fear her. She was too free from
 evil for that; but they were conscious of a mental superiority, and yielded
 without complaining to her sway.</p>
 <p>The result of this was, that the younger Nancy, although
 compelled to service, always exhibited some pride, from a feeling that her
 mother was a superior woman to any around her.</p>
 <p>She never felt herself inferior to her master and
 mistress, yet she complained not of being in subjection to them. There were
 so many interesting features in the character of this young servant girl
 that she became in many respects like a daughter to her mistress. There was
 no broad line of division in those days, in even the manorial hall, between
 the lord and his domestics, and still less defined was the position of the
 employer and the employed in a small farmhouse. Consequent on this condition
 of things, Frank Lenine and Nancy were thrown as much together as if they
 had been brother and sister. Frank was rarely checked in anything by his
 over-fond parents, who were especially proud of their son, since he was
 regarded as the handsomest young man in the parish. Frank conceived a very
 warm attachment for Nancy, and she was not a little proud of her lover.
 Although it was evident to all the parish that Frank and Nancy were
 seriously devoted to each other, the young man's parents were blind to it,
 and were taken by surprise when one day Frank asked his father and mother to
 consent to his marrying Nancy.</p>
 <p>The Lenines had allowed their son to have his own way
 from his youth up; and now, in a matter which brought into play the
 strongest of human feelings, they were angry because he refused to bend to
 their wills.</p>
 <p>The old man felt it would be a degradation for a Lenine
 to marry a Trenoweth, and, in the most unreasoning manner, he resolved it
 should never be.</p>
 <p>The first act was to send Nancy home to Alsia Mill, where
 her parents resided; the next was an imperious command to his son never
 again to see the girl.</p>
 <p>The commands of the old are generally powerless upon the
 young where the affairs of the heart are concerned. So were they upon Frank.
 He, who was rarely seen of an evening beyond the garden of his father's
 cottage, was now as constantly absent from his home. The house, which was
 wont to be a pleasant one, was strangely altered. A gloom had fallen over
 all things; the father and son rarely met as friends--the mother and her
 boy had now a feeling of reserve. Often there were angry altercations
 between the father and son, and the mother felt she could not become the
 defender of her boy in his open acts of disobedience, his bold defiance of
 his parents' commands.</p>
 <p>Rarely an evening passed that did not find Nancy and
 Frank together in some retired nook. The Holy Well was a favourite
 meeting-place, and here the most solemn vows were made. Locks of hair were
 exchanged; a wedding-ring, taken from the finger of a corpse, was broken,
 when they vowed that they would be united either dead or alive; and they
 even climbed at night the granite-pile at Treryn, and swore by the Logan
 Rock the same strong vow.</p>
 <p>Time passed onward thus unhappily, and, as the result of
 the endeavours to quench out the passion by force, it grew stronger under
 the repressing power, and, like imprisoned steam, eventually burst through
 all restraint.</p>
 <p>Nancy's parents discovered at length that moonlight
 meetings between two untrained, impulsive youths, had a natural result, and
 they were now doubly earnest in their endeavours to compel Frank to marry
 their daughter.</p>
 <p>The elder Lenine could not be brought to consent to this,
 and he firmly resolved to remove his son entirely from what he considered
 the hateful influences of the Trenoweths. He resolved to go to Plymouth, to
 take his son with him, and, if possible, to send him away to sea, hoping
 thus to wean him from his folly, as he considered this love-madness. Frank,
 poor fellow, with the best intentions, was not capable of any sustained
 effort, and consequently he at length succumbed to his father; and, to
 escape his persecution, he entered a ship bound for India, and bade adieu to
 his native land.</p>
 <p>Frank could not write, and this happened in days when
 letters could be forwarded only with extreme difficulty, consequently Nancy
 never heard from her lover.</p>
 <p>A baby had been born into a troublesome world, and the
 infant became a real solace to the young mother. As the child grew, it
 became an especial favourite with its grandmother; the elder Nancy rejoiced
 over the little prattler, and forgot her cause of sorrow. Young Nancy lived
 for her child, and on the memory of its father. Subdued in spirit she was,
 but her affliction had given force to her character, and she had been heard
 to declare that wherever Frank might be she was ever present with him;
 whatever might be the temptations of the hour, that her influence was
 all-powerful over him for good. She felt that no distance could separate
 their souls, that no time could be long enough to destroy the bond between
 them.</p>
 <p>A period of distress fell upon the Trenoweths, and it was
 necessary that Nancy should leave her home once more, and go again into
 service. Her mother took charge of the babe, and she found a situation in
 the village of Kimyall, in the parish of Paul. Nancy, like her mother,
 contrived by force of character to maintain an ascendancy amongst her
 companions. She had formed an acquaintance, which certainly never grew into
 friendship, with some of the daughters of the small farmers around. These
 girls were all full of the superstitions of the time and place.</p>
 <p>The winter was coming on, and nearly three years had
 passed away since Frank Lenine left his country. As yet there was no sign.
 Nor father, nor mother, nor maiden had heard of him, and they all sorrowed
 over his absence. The Lenines desired to have Nancy's child, but the
 Trenoweths would not part with it. They went so far even as to endeavour to
 persuade Nancy to live again with them, but Nancy was not at all disposed to
 submit to their wishes.</p>
 <p>It was All-hallows Eve, and two of Nancy's companions
 persuaded her--no very difficult task--to go with them and sow hemp-seed.</p>
 <p>At midnight the three maidens stole out unperceived into
 Kimyall town-place to perform their incantation. Nancy was the first to sow,
 the others being less bold than she.</p>
 <p>Boldly she advanced, saying, as she scattered the seed,--
 </p>
 <p>"Hemp-seed I sow thee,<br>
 Hemp.seed grow thee;<br>
 And he who wilt my true love be,<br>
 Come after me<br>
 And shaw thee."</p>
 <p>This was repeated three times, when, looking back over
 her left shoulder, she saw Lenine; but he looked so angry that she shrieked
 with fear, and broke the spell. One of the other girls, however, resolved
 now to make trial of the spell, and the result of her labours was the vision
 of a white coffin. Fear now fell on all, and they went home sorrowful, to
 spend each one a sleepless night.</p>
 <p>November came with its storms, and during one terrific
 night a large vessel was thrown upon the rocks in Bernowhall Cliff, and,
 beaten by the impetuous waves, she was soon in pieces. Amongst the bodies of
 the crew washed ashore, nearly all of whom had perished, was Frank Lenine. -
 He was not dead when found, but the only words he lived to speak were
 begging the people to send for Nancy Trenoweth, that he might make her his
 wife before he died.</p>
 <p>Rapidly sinking, Frank was borne by his friends on a
 litter to Boscean, but he died as he reached the town-place. His parents,
 overwhelmed in their own sorrows, thought nothing of Nancy, and without her
 knowing that Lenine had returned, the poor fellow was laid in his last bed,
 in Burian Churchyard.</p>
 <p>On the night of the funeral, Nancy went, as was her
 custom, to lock the door of the house, and as was her custom too, she looked
 out into the night. At this instant a horseman rode up in hot haste, called
 her by name, and hailed her in a voice that made her blood boil.</p>
 <p>The voice was the voice of Lenine. She could never forget
 that; and the horse she now saw was her sweetheart's favourite colt, on
 which he had often ridden at night to Alsia.</p>
 <p>The rider was imperfectly seen; but he looked very
 sorrowful, and deadly pale, still Nancy knew him to be Frank Lenine.</p>
 <p>He told her that he had just arrived home, and that the
 first moment he was at liberty he had taken horse to fetch his loved one,
 and to make her his bride.</p>
 <p>Nancy's excitement was so great, that she was easily
 persuaded to spring on the horse behind him, that they might reach his home
 before the morning.</p>
 <p>When she took Lenine's hand a cold shiver passed through
 her, and as she grasped his waist to secure herself in her seat, her arm
 became as stiff as ice. She lost all power of speech, and suffered deep
 fear, yet she knew not why. The moon had arisen, and now burst out in a full
 flood of light, through the heavy clouds which had obscured it. The horse
 pursued its journey with great rapidity, and whenever in weariness it
 slackened its speed, the peculiar voice of the rider aroused its drooping
 energies. Beyond this no word was spoken since Nancy had mounted behind her
 lover. They now came to Trove Bottom, where there was no bridge at that
 time; they dashed into the river. The moon shone full in their faces. Nancy
 looked into the stream, and saw that the rider was in a shroud and other
 grave-clothes. She now knew that she was being carried away by a spirit, yet
 she had no power to save herself; indeed, the inclination to do so did not
 exist.</p>
 <p>On went the horse at a furious pace, until they came to
 the blacksmith's shop near Burian Church-town, when she knew by the light
 from the forge fire thrown across the road that the smith was still at his
 labours. She now recovered speech. "Save me! save me! save me I" she cried
 with all her might. The smith sprang from the door of the smithy, with a
 red-hot iron in his hand, and as the horse rushed by, caught the woman's
 dress and pulled her to the ground. The spirit, however, also seized Nancy's
 dress in one hand, and his grasp was like that of a vice. The horse passed
 like the wind, and Nancy and the smith were pulled down as far as the old
 Almshouses, near the churchyard. Here the horse for a moment stopped. The
 smith seized that moment, and with his hot iron burned off the dress from
 the rider's hand, thus saving Nancy, more dead than alive; while the rider
 passed over the wall of the churchyard, and vanished on the grave in which
 Lenine had been laid but a few hours before.</p>
 <p>The smith took Nancy into his shop, and he soon aroused
 some of his neighbours, who took the poor girl back to Alsia. Her parents
 laid her on her bed. She spoke no word, but to ask for her child, to request
 her mother to give up her child to Lenine's parents, and her desire to be
 buried in his grave. Before the morning light fell on the world, Nancy had
 breathed her last breath.</p>
 <p>A horse was seen that night to pass through the
 Church-town like a ball from a musket, and in the morning Lenine's colt was
 found dead in Bernowhall Cliff, covered with foam, its eyes forced from its
 head, and its swollen tongue hanging out of its mouth. On Lenine's grave was
 found the piece of Nancy's dress which was left in the spirit's hand when
 the smith burnt her from his grasp.</p>
 <p>It is said that one or two of the sailors who survived
 the wreck related after the funeral, how, on the 30th of October, at night,
 Lenine was like one mad; they could scarcely keep him in the ship. He seemed
 more asleep than awake, and, after great excitement, he fell as if dead upon
 the deck, and lay so for hours.</p>
 <p>When he came to himself, he told them that he had been
 taken to the village of Kimyall, and that if he ever married the woman who
 had cast the spell, he would make her suffer the longest day she had to live
 for drawing his soul out of his body.</p>
 <p>Poor Nancy was buried in Lenine's grave, and her companion
 in sowing hemp-seed, who saw the white coffin, slept beside her within the
 year.</p>
 <p>This story bears a striking resemblance to the "Lenore" of
 Burger, which remarkable ballad can scarcely have found its way, even yet,
 to Boscean.</p>
