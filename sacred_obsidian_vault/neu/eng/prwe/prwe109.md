 <p align="CENTER">DUFFY AND THE DEVIL.[a]</p>
 <p>MANY of the superstitions of our ancestors are preserved
 in quaint, irregular rhymes, the recitation of which was the amusement of
 the people in the long nights of winter. These were sung, or rather said, in
 a monotone, by the professional Drolls, who doubtless added such things as
 they fancied would increase the interest of the story to the listeners.
 Especially were they fond of introducing known characters on the scene, and
 of mixing up events which had occurred within the memory of the old people,
 with the more ancient legend. The following story, or rather parts of it,
 formed the subject of one of the Cornish Christmas plays. When I was a boy,
 I well remember being much delighted with the coarse acting of a set of
 Christmas players, who exhibited in the "great hall" of a farmhouse at which
 I was visiting, and who gave us the principal incidents of Duffy and the
 Devil Terrytop; one of the company doing the part of Chorus, and filling up
 by rude descriptions--often in rhyme--the parts which the players could
 not represent.</p>
 <p>It was in cider-making time. Squire Lovel of Trove, or more
 correctly, Trewoof, rode up to Burian Church-town to procure help. Boys and
 maidens were in request, some to gather the apples from the trees, others
 to. carry them to the cider-mill. Passing along the village as hastily as
 the dignity of a squire would allow him, his attention was drawn to a great
 noise--scolding in a shrill treble voice, and crying--proceeding from
 Janey Chygwin's door. The squire rode up to the cottage, and he saw the old
 woman beating her step-daughter Duffy about the head with the skirt of her
 swing-tail gown, in which she had been carrying out the ashes. She made such
 a dust, that the squire was nearly choked and almost blinded with the wood
 ashes.</p>
 <p>"What cheer, Janey?" cries the squire; "what's the to-do
 with you and Duffy?"</p>
 <p>"Oh, the lazy hussy!" shouts Janey, "is all her time
 courseying and courranting with the boys! she will never stay in to boil
 the porridge, knit the stockings, or spin the yarn."</p>
 <p>"Don't believe her, your honour," exclaims Duffy; "my
 knitting and spinning is the best in the parish."</p>
 <p>The war of tongues continued in this strain for some
 time, the old squire looking calmly on, and resolving in his mind to take
 Duffy home with him to Trove, her appearance evidently pleasing him greatly.
 Squire Level left the old and young woman to do the best they could, and
 went round the village to complete his hiring. When he returned, peace had
 been declared between them; but when Lovel expressed his desire to take
 Duffy home to his house to help the housekeeper to do the spinning, "A
 pretty spinner she is I" shouted old Janey at the top of her voice. "Try me,
 your honour," said Duffy, curtsying very low; "my yarns are the best in the
 parish."</p>
 <p>"We 'll soon try that," said the squire; "Janey will be
 glad to get quits of thee, I see, and thou'It be nothing loath to leave her;
 so jump up behind me, Duffy."</p>
 <p>No sooner said than done. The maid Duffy, without
 ceremony, mounted behind the squire on the horse, and they jogged silently
 down to Trove.</p>
 <p>Squire Lovel's old housekeeper was almost blind--one eye
 had been put out by an angry old wizard, and through sympathy she was
 rapidly losing the power of seeing with the other.</p>
 <p>This old dame was consequently very glad of some one to
 help her in spinning and knitting.</p>
 <p>The introduction over, the housekeeper takes Duffy up
 into the garret where the wool was kept, and where the spinning .was done in
 the summer, and requests her to commence her work.</p>
 <p>The truth must be told; Duffy was an idle slut, she could
 neither knit nor spin. Well, here she was left alone, and, of course,
 expected to produce a good specimen of her work.</p>
 <p>The garret was piled from the floor to the key-beams with
 fleeces of wool. Duffy looked despairingly at them, and then sat herself
 down on the "turn "--the spinning-wheel--and cried out,</p>
 <p>"Curse the spinning and knitting! The devil may spin and
 knit for the squire for what I care."</p>
 <p>Scarcely had Duffy spoken these words than she heard a
 rustling, noise behind some woolpacks, and forth walked a queer-looking
 little man, with a remarkable pair of eyes, which seemed to send out flashes
 of light. There was something uncommonly knowing in the twist of his mouth,
 and his curved nose had an air of curious intelligence. He was dressed in
 black, and moved towards Duffy with a jaunty air, knocking something against
 the floor at every step he took.</p>
 <p>"Duffy dear," said this little gentleman, "I 'll do all
 the spinning and knitting for thee."</p>
 <p>"Thank 'e," says Duffy, quite astonished.</p>
 <p>"Duffy dear, a lady shall you be."</p>
 <p>"Thank 'e, your honour," smiled Duffy.</p>
 <p>"But, Duffy dear, remember," coaxingly said the queer
 little man,--" remember, that for all this, at the end of three years, you
 must go with me, unless you can find out my name."</p>
 <p>Duffy was not the least bit frightened, nor did she
 hesitate long, but presently struck a bargain with her kind but unknown
 friend, who told her she had only to wish, and her every wish should be
 fulfilled; and as for the spinning and knitting, she would find all she
 required under the black ram's fleece.</p>
 <p>He then departed. How, Duffy could not tell, but in a
 moment the queer little gentleman was gone.</p>
 <p>Duffy sung in idleness, and slept until it was time for
 her to make her appearance. So she wished for some yarns, and looking under
 the black fleece she found them.</p>
 <p>Those were shown by the housekeeper to the squire, and
 both declared "they had never seen such beautiful yarns."</p>
 <p>The next day Duffy was to knit this yarn into stockings.
 Duffy idled, as only professed idlers can idle; but in due time, as if she
 had been excessively industrious, she produced a pair of stockings for the
 old squire.</p>
 <p>If the yarn was beautiful, the stockings were beyond all
 praise. They were as fine as silk, and as strong as leather.</p>
 <p>Squire Lovel soon gave them a trial; and when he came
 home at night after hunting, he declared he would never wear any other than
 Duffy's stockings. He had wandered all day through brake and briar, furze
 and brambles; there was not a scratch on his legs, and he was as dry as a
 bone. There was no end to his praise of Duffy's stockings.</p>
 <p>Duffy had a rare time of it now--she could do what she
 pleased, and rove where she willed. </p>
 <p>She was dancing on the mill-bed half the day, with all
 the gossiping women who brought their grist to be ground.</p>
 <p>In those "good old times" the ladies of the parish would
 take their corn to mill, and serge the flour themselves. When a few of them
 met together, they would either tell stories or dance whilst the corn was
 grinding. Sometimes the dance would be on the mill-bed, sometimes out on the
 green. On some occasions the miller's fiddle would be in request, at others
 the "crowd" [b] was made to do the duty of a tambourine.</p>
 <p>So Duffy was always finding excuses to go to mill, and
 many "a round" would she dance with the best people in the parish.</p>
 <p>Old Bet, the miller's wife, was a witch, and she found
 out who did Duffy's work for her, Duffy and old Bet were always the best of
 friends, and she never told any one about Duffy's knitting friend, nor did
 she ever say a word about the stockings being unfinished. There was always a
 stitch down.</p>
 <p>On Sundays the people went to Burian Church, from all
 parts, to look at the squire's stockings; and the old squire would stop at
 the Cross, proud enough to show them. He could hunt</p>
 <p align="CENTER">"Through brambles and furze in all sorts of weather;<br>
 His old shanks were as sound as if bound up in leather."</p>
 <p>Duffy was now sought after by all the young men of the
 country; and at last the squire, fearing to lose a pretty girl, and one who
 was so useful to him, married her himsçlf, and she became, according to the
 fashion of the time and place, Lady Lovel; but she was commonly known by her
 neighbours as the Duffy Lady.</p>
 <p>Lady Lovel kept the devil hard at work. Stockings, all
 sorts of fine underclothing, bedding, and much ornamental work, the like of
 which was never seen, was produced at command, and passed off as her own.</p>
 <p>Duffy passed a merry time of it, but somehow or other she
 was never happy when she was compelled to play the lady. She passed much
 more of her time with the old crone at the mill, than in the drawing-room at
 Trove. The squire sported and drank, and cared little about Duffy, so long
 as she provided him with knitted garments.</p>
 <p>The three years were nearly at an end, Duffy had tried
 every plan to find out the devil's name, but had failed in all.</p>
 <p>She began to fear that she should have to go off with her
 queer friend, and Duffy became melancholy. Old Bet endeavoured to rouse her,
 persuading her that she could from her long experience and many dealings
 with the imps of darkness, at the last moment put her in the way of escaping
 her doom.</p>
 <p>Duffy went day after day to her garret, and there each
 day was the devil gibing and jeering till she was almost mad.</p>
 <p>There was but another day. Bet was seriously consulted
 now, and, as good as her word, she promised to use her power.</p>
 <p>Duffy Lady was to bring down to the mill that very
 evening a jack of the strongest beer she had in the cellar. She was not to
 go to bed until the squire returned from hunting, no matter how late, and
 she was to make no remark in reply to anything the squire might tell her.</p>
 <p>The jack of beer was duly carried to the mill, and Duffy
 returned home very melancholy to wait up for the squire.</p>
 <p>No sooner had Lady Lovel left the mill than old Bet came
 out with the "crowd" over her shoulders, and the blackjack in her hand. She
 shut the door, and turned the water off the mill-wheel,--threw her red
 cloak about her, and away.</p>
 <p>She was seen by her neighbours going towards Boleit. A
 man saw the old woman trudging past the Pipers, and through the Dawnse Main
 into the downs, but there he lost sight of her, and no one could tell where
 old Bet was gone to at that time of night.</p>
 <p>Duffy waited long and anxiously. By and by the dogs came
 home alone. They were covered with foam, their tongues were hanging out of
 their mouths, and all the servants said they must have met the devil's
 hounds without heads.</p>
 <p>Duffy was seriously alarmed. Midnight came but no squire. At
 last he arrived, but like a crazy, crack-brained man, he kept singing,--</p>
 <p>"Here's to the devil,<br>
 With his wooden pick and shovel."</p>
 <p>He was neither drunk nor frightened, but wild with some
 strange excitement. After a long time Squire Lovel sat down, and began, "My
 dear Duffy, you haven't smiled this long time; but now I'll tell 'e
 something that would make ye laugh if ye're dying. If you'd seen what I 'ye
 seen to-night, ha, ha, ha!</p>
 <p>'Here's to the devil,<br>
 With his wooden pick and shovel"</p>
 <p>True to her orders, Duffy said not a word, but allowed
 the squire to ramble on as he pleased. At length he told her the following
 story of his adventures, with interruptions which have not been retained,
 and with numerous coarse expressions which are best forgotten - </p>
 <p align="CENTER">THE SQUIRE'S STORY OF THE MEETING OF
 THE WITCHES IN THE<br>
 FUGOE HOLE.</p>
 <p>"Duffy dear, I left home at break of day this morning. I
 hunted all the moors from Trove to Trevider, and never started a hare all
 the livelong day. I determined to hunt all night, but that I 'd have a brace
 to bring home. So, at nightfall I went down Lemorna Bottoms, then up Brene
 Downses, and as we passed the Dawnse Main up started a hare, as fine a hare
 as ever was seen. She passed the Pipers, down through the Reens, in the
 mouth of the dogs half the time, yet they couldn't catch her at all. As fine
 a chase as ever was seen, until she took into the Fugoe Hole. [c] In went
 the dogs after her, and I followed, the owls and bats flying round my head.
 On we went, through water and mud, a mile or more, I 'm quite certain. I
 didn't know the place was so long before. At last we came to a broad pool of
 water, when the dogs lost the scent, and ran back past me howling and
 jowling, terrified almost to death! A little farther on I turned round a
 corner, and saw a glimmering fire on the other side the water, and there
 were St Leven witches in scores. Some were riding on ragwort, some on
 brooms, some were floating on their three-legged stools, and some, who had
 been milking the little good cows in Wales, had come back astride of the
 largest leeks they could find. Amongst the rest there was our Bet of the
 Mill, with her 'crowd' in her hand, and my own blackjack slung across her
 shoulders.</p>
 <p>"In a short time the witches gathered round the fire, and
 blowed it up, after a strange fashion, till it burned up into a 
 brilliant blue flame. Then I saw amongst the rest a queer little man in
 black, with a  long forked tail, which he held high in the air, and
 twirled around. Bet struck her  'crowd' as soon as he appeared, and
 beat up the tune,--</p>
 <p>'Here 'a to the devil<br>
 With his wooden pick and shovel, <br>
 Digging tin by the bushel, <br>
 With his tail cock'd up!'</p>
 <p>Then the queer little devil and all danced like the wind,
 and went faster and faster, making such a clatter, 'as if they had on each
 foot a pewter platter.'</p>
 <p>"Every time the man in black came round by old Bet, he
 took a good pull from my own blackjack, till at last, as if he had been
 drinking my best beer, he seemed to have lost his head, when he jumped up
 and down, turned round and round, and roaring with laughter, sung,-- </p>
 <p>'Duffy, my lady, you'll never know--what? --<br>
 That my name is Terrytop, Terrytop--top!'"</p>
 <p>When the squire sung those lines, he stopped suddenly,
 thinking that Duffy was going to die. She turned pale and red, and pale
 again. However, Duffy said nothing, and the squire proceeded:-- </p>
 <p>"After the dance, all the witches made a ring around the
 fire, and again blew it up, until the blue flames reached the top of the
 'Zawn.' [d] Then the devil danced through and through the fire, and
 springing ever and anon amongst the witches, kicked them soundly. At last--I
 was shaking with laughter at the fun--I shouted, 'Go it, Old Nick!' and,
 lo, the lights went out, and I had to fly with all my speed, for every one
 of the witches were after me. I scampered home somehow, and here I am. Why
 don't you laugh, Duffy?" Duffy did laugh, and laugh right heartily now, and
 when tired of their fun, the squire and the lady went to bed.</p>
 <p>The three years were up within an hour. Duffy had willed
 for an abundant supply of knitted things, and filled every chest in the
 house. She was in the best chamber trying to cram some more stockings into a
 big chest, when the queer little man in black appeared before her.</p>
 <p>"Well, Duffy, ray dear," said he, "I have been to my
 word, and served you truly for three years as we agreed, so now I hope you
 will go with me, and make no objection." He bowed very obsequiously, almost
 to the ground, and regarded Duffy Lady with a very offensive leer.</p>
 <p>"I fear," smiled Duffy, "that your country is rather
 warm, and might spoil my fair complexion."</p>
 <p>"It is not so hot as some people say, Duffy," was his
 reply; "but come along, I 'ye kept my word, and of course a lady of your
 standing will keep your word also. Can you tell me my name?"</p>
 <p>Duffy curtsied, and smilingly said, "You have behaved
 like a true gentlemen; yet I wouldn't like to go so far." The devil frowned,
 and approached as if he would lay forcible hands upon her. "Maybe your name
 is Lucifer?"</p>
 <p>He stamped his loot and grinned horridly. "Lucifer!
 Lucifer! He's no other than a servant to me in my own country." Suddenly
 calming again, he said, quietly, "Lucifer! I would scarcely be seen
 speaking to him at court. But come along. When I spin for ladies I expect
 honourable treatment at their hands. You 'ye two guesses more. But they 're
 of little use; my name is not generally known on earth."</p>
 <p>"Perhaps," smiled Duffy again, "my lord's name is
 Beelzebub?"</p>
 <p>How he grinned, and his sides shook with convulsive joy.</p>
 <p>"Beelzebub!" says he; "why, he's little better than the
 other, a common devil he. I believe he 's some sort of a cousin--a Cornish
 cousin, you know."</p>
 <p>"I hope your honour," curtsied Duffy, "will not take
 offence. Impute my mistake to ignorance."</p>
 <p>Our Demon was rampant with joy; he danced around Duffy
 with delight, and was, seeing that she hesitated, about to seize her
 somewhat roughly.</p>
 <p>"Stop! stop!" shouts Duffy; "perhaps you will be honest
 enough to admit that your name is Terrytop."</p>
 <p>The gentleman in black looked at Duffy, and she steadily
 looked him in the face. " Terrytop! deny it if you dare," says she.</p>
 <p>"A gentleman never denies his name," replied Terrytop,
 drawing himself up with much dignity. "I did not expect to be beaten by a
 young minx like you, Duffy; but the pleasure of your company is merely
 postponed." With this Terrytop departed in fire and smoke, and all the
 devil's knitting suddenly turned to ashes.</p>
 <p>Squire Lovel was out hunting, away far on the moors; the
 day was cold and the winds piercing. Suddenly the stockings dropped from his
 legs and the homespun from his back, so that he came home with nothing on
 but his shirt and his shoes, almost dead with cold. All this was attributed
 by the squire to the influence of old Bet, who, he thought, had punished him
 for pursuing her with his dogs when she had assumed the form of a hare.</p>
 <p><br>
 The story, as told by the Drolls, now rambles on. Duffy cannot furnish
 stockings. The squire is very wroth. There are many quarrels--mutual
 recriminations. Duffy's old sweetheart is called in to beat the squire, and
 eventually peace is procured, by a stratagem of old Bet's, which would
 rather shock the sense of propriety in these our days.</p>
 <p>[a] The incidents of this story are strikingly similar to
 those in "Rumpel-stlitshen." The maiden in that tale has to spin straw into
 gold thread, and she, like Duffy, has to discover the name of the spirit who
 has befriended her.</p>
 <p>Mr Robert Chambers, is his "Popular Rhymes of Scotland," has
 a fairy tale in which the fairy threatens the mother that she will have her
 "lad bairn" unless "ye can tell me my right name." The anxious mother takes
 a walk in the wood, and she hears the fairy singing--</p>
 <p>"Little kens our gude dame at hame<br>
 That 'whuppity Stoorie' is my name."</p>
 <p>Of course, when the fairy comes to claim the "lad hairs,"
 she is addressed as "Whuppity Stoorie," and she at once disappears.</p>
 <p>In "Who Built Reynir Church?" in the "Icelandic Legends" of
 Jon Arnason, the story turns on the discovery of the name of the builder. --
 Icelandic Legends, p. 49.</p>
 <p>[b] Crowd,--a sieve covered with sheep-skin.</p>
 <p>[c] There is a tradition, firmly believed on the lower
 side of Burian, that the Fugoe Hole extends from the cliffs uoderground so
 far that the end of it is under the parlour of the Tremewen's house in
 Trove, which is the only remaining portion of the old mansion of the Lovela.</p>
 <p>Here the witches were in the habit of meeting the devil,
 and holding their Sabbath. Often his dark Highness has been heard piping,
 while the witches danced to his music. A pool of water some distance from
 the entrance prevents any adventurer from exploring the "Hole" to its
 termination.</p>
 <p>Hares often take refuge in the Fugoe Hole, from which
 they have never been known to return.</p>
