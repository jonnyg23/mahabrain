 <p align="CENTER">THE TINNER OF CHYANNOR [a]</p>
 <p>THE village of Trereen, near the Logan Stone, was at one
 time an important market-town. Here came all the tin-streamers who worked
 from Penberth to the hills, and to protect the place and the valuable
 property which was accumulated here, Castle Trereen was built. Here came--
 or rather into the cove near it came--the Tyrian merchants. They were not
 allowed to advance beyond the shores, lest they should discover the country
 from which the tin was brought. But it is not of them that we have now to
 tell, but of a knot of tinners who came from the low country between
 Chyannor and Trengothal. These were assembled round the Garrack Zans, which
 then stood in the centre of the market-place of Trereen. Times had been bad,
 and they were consulting together what they had better do. The "streams" had
 failed them, and they believed all the tin was worked out. Some of them had
 heard that there was tin in "the country a long way off." some miles beyond
 Market-Jew; but they had but a very dim idea of the place or of the people.
 One of them, who, though an old man, was more adventurous than any of his
 comrades, said he would travel there and see what could be done. It was then
 determined that Tom Trezidder should try his fortune, and the others would
 wait until he came home again, or sent for them to come to him. This was
 soon noised about, and all the women, old and young, came to say" Good-bye"
 to Tom. His parting with his wife was brief but bitter. He bore up well, and
 with a stout heart started on his adventure. Tom Trezidder arrived at length
 at a place not far from Goldsythney, and here he found one of the Jew
 merchants, who farmed the tin ground, and sold the tin at St Michael's
 Mount; and the Jew was very anxious to engage so experienced a "streamer" as
 Tom was. Tom, nothing loath, took service for a year. He was to have just
 enough to live on, and a share of profits at the year's end. Tom worked
 diligently, and plenty of tin was the result of his experienced labour. The
 year expired, and Tom looked for his share of the profits. The Jew contrived
 to put Tom off, and promised Tom great things if he would stop for another
 year, and persuaded him to send for some of his old comrades, clenching
 every argument which he employed with a small piece of advice, "Never leave
 an old road for a new one,"</p>
 <p>The other tiriners were shy of venturing so far, so that two
 or three only could be persuaded to leave the West Country. With Tom and
 with his brethren the year passed by, and at the end he got no money, but
 only the same piece of advice, "Never leave an old road for a new one." This
 went on for a third year, when all of them, being naturally tired of this
 sort of thing, resolved to go home again.</p>
 <p>Tom Trezidder was a favourite with his master, and was
 greatly esteemed for his honesty and industry by his mistress.</p>
 <p>When they left she gave Tom a good currant cake to take home
 to his old woman, and told him to remember the advice, "Never leave an old
 road for a new one."</p>
 <p>The tinners trudged on together until they were on the
 western side of Penzance. They were weary, and they found that since they
 had left home a new road had been made over the hills, which saved them a
 considerable distance--in fact it was a "short cut." On they went. "No,"
 says Tom; "never leave an old road for a new one." They all laughed at him,
 and trudged on. But Tom kept in the old road along the valley round the
 hill. When Torn reached the other end of the "short cut" he thought he would
 rest a bit, and he sat down by the road-side and ate his <i>fuggan. </i>This
 his mistress had given him, that he might not break his cake until he got
 home.</p>
 <p>He had not sat long when he heard a noise, and, looking up
 the hill, he saw his comrades, who he thought were miles in advance of him,
 slowly and sorrowfully descending it. They came at last to where Tom was
 seated, and a sad tale had they to tell, They had scarcely got into the new
 road when they were set upon by robbers, who took from them "all their
 little bit of money," and then beat them because they had no more.</p>
 <p>Tom, you may be sure, thought the piece of advice worth
 something now, as it had saved his bacon.</p>
 <p>Tom arrived home at last, and glad was the old woman to see
 her old man once again; so she made him some "herby tea" at once. He showed
 his wife the cake, and told her that all he had received for his share of
 profits was the piece of advice already given.</p>
 <p>The ladies who read this story will understand how vexed was
 Tom's wife,--there are but few of them who would not have done as she did,
 that was to seize the cake from the table and fling it at her husband's
 head, calling him an old fool. Tom Trezidder stooped to avoid the blow. Slap
 against the corner of the dresser went the cake, breaking in pieces with the
 blow, and out on the lime-ash floor rolled a lot of gold coins.</p>
 <p>This soon changed the aspect of things; the storm rolled
 back, and sunshine was once more in the cottage. The coins were all gathered
 up, and they found a scrap of paper, on which, when they got the priest to
 read it, they discovered was written an exact account of each year's
 profits, and Tom's share. The three years' shares had been duly hoarded for
 him by his master and mistress; and now this old couple found they had
 enough to make them comfortable for the rest of their days. Many were the
 prayers said by Tom and his wife for the happiness and health of the honest
 Jew tin merchant and his wife.</p>
