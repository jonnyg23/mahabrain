 <p align="CENTER">THE CITY OF LANCARROW OR LANGONA [a]</p>
 <p>
  <br>
 WE cannot say how many years since, but once there stood on the
 northern shores of Cornwall, extending over all that country between the
 Ganrell and Perranporth, a large city called Langarrow or Langona. The
 sand-hills which now extend over this part of the coast cover that great city,
 and the memory of the sad and sudden catastrophe still lingers among the
 peasantry. So settled is tradition, that no other time than 900 years since is
 ever mentioned as the period at which Langarrow was buried. This city in its
 prime is said to have been the largest in England, and to have had seven
 churches, which were alike remarkable for their beauty and their size. The
 inhabitants were wealthy, and according to received accounts, they drew their 
 wealth from a large tract of level land, thickly wooded in some parts, and
 highly cultivated in others--from the sea, which was overflowing with fish of
 all kinds--and from mines, which yielded them abundance of tin and lead.</p>
 <p>To this remote city, in those days, criminals were
 transported from other parts of Britain. They were made to work in the mines
 on the coast, in constructing a new harbour in the Gannell, and clearing it of
 sand, so that ships of large burden could in those days sail far inland.
 Numerous curious excavations in the rocks, on either side of this estuary, are
 still pointed out as being evidences of the works of the convicts. This
 portion of the population of Langarrow were not allowed to dwell within the
 city. The convicts and their families had to construct huts or dig caves on
 the wild moors of this unsheltered northern shore, and to this day evidences
 of their existence are found under the sand, in heaps of wood-ashes, amidst
 which are discovered considerable quantities of mussel and cockle shells,
 which we may suppose was their principal food. As far as I know, these are the
 first indications of anything resembling the Kjokkenmöddings, or refuse-heaps
 of Denmark, which have been discovered in this country.</p>
 <p>For a long period this city flourished in its prime, and
 its inhabitants were in the enjoyment of every luxury which industry could
 obtain or wealth could purchase. Sin, in many of its worst forms, was however
 present amongst the people. The convicts sent to Langarrow were of the vilest.
 They were long kept widely separated; but use breeds familiarity, and
 gradually the more designing of the convicts persuaded their masters to employ
 them within the city. The result of' this was, after a few years, an
 amalgamation of the two classes of the population. The daughters of Langarrow
 were married to the criminals, and thus crime became the familiar spirit of
 the place. The progress of this may have been slow--the result was, however,
 sure; and eventually, when vice was dominant, and the whole population sunk in
 sensual pleasures, the anger of the Lord fell upon them. A storm of unusual
 violence arose, and continued blowing, without intermitting its violence for
 one moment, for three days and nights. In that period the hills of blown sand,
 extending, with few intervals, from Crantock to Perran were formed, burying
 the city, its churches, and its inhabitants in a common grave. To the present
 time those sand-hills stand a monument of God's wrath; and in several places
 we certainly find considerable quantities of bleached human bones, which are
 to many strong evidence of the correctness of tradition.</p>
 <p>Crantock was, according to tradition, once a trading town,
 and it then had a religious house, with a dean and nine prebends. The Gannell
 filling up ruined the town. This must have happened when Langarrow was
 destroyed.</p>
 <p>On Gwithian Sands the remains of what is supposed to have been
 a church has been discovered, and according to Hals and Gilbert, a similar
 tradition exists here of a buried town. Gilbert writes thus:-- </p>
 <p>"There has always existed a traditional account of the
 inundation of sand in this parish, corroborated by the ecclesiastical
 valuations, which are far too high for the actual extent of the land, and also
 said to be confirmed by documents preserved in the Arundel family, carrying
 back the commencement of the evil nearly to the period of their acquiring the
 property.</p>
 <p>"With respect to more recent inundations, Mr Hockin states
 to Mr Lysons, that the Barton of Upton, one of the principal farms, was
 suddenly overwhelmed; that his great-grandfather remembered the occupier
 residing in the farmhouse, which was nearly buried in one night, the family
 being obliged to make their escape through the chamber windows; and that in
 consequence of the wind producing a shifting of the sand, in the winter of
 1808-9, the house, after having disappeared for more than a century, came
 again to view.</p>
 <p>"The rector further stated that he himself remembered two
 fields being lost at Gwithian, and that they are now covered with sand to the
 depth of ten or twelve feet, and that the church-town would have been also
 lost, if the parish officers had not promptly resorted to the expedient of
 planting rushes. These stop the complete progress of sand, and greatly
 facilitate the growth of other vegetation on the surface, so as to create a
 thin turf, The hillocks of sand exhibit a model in miniature of the
 Alps."--Gilbert, vol. ii, p. 149.</p>
 <p>[a] '"The vicarage church of Crantock is commonly called
 Languna or Langona,--that is to say, the hay temple or church,--and is
 suitable to its name, situate in a large hay meadow of rich land, containing
 about three acres, where, by ancient custom, the vicar's, cattle all pasture
 over the dead bodies interred thereinto."--Hals, as given by Gilbert. See
 Appendix Q.</p>
