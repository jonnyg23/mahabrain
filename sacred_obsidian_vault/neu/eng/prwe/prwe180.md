 THE WITCHES OF THE LOGAN
 STONE.</p>
 <p>WHO that has travelled into Cornwall but has visited the
 Logan Stone ? Numerous Logan rocks exist on the granite hills of the county,
 but that remarkable mass which is poised on the cubical masses forming its
 Cyclopean support, at Trereen, is beyond all others "The Logan Stone."</p>
 <p>A more sublime spot could not have been chosen by the
 Bardic priesthood for any ordeal connected with their worship; and even
 admitting that nature may have disposed the huge mass to. wear away, so as
 to rest delicately poised on a pivot, it is highly probable that the, wild
 worship of the untrained tribes, who had passed to those islands' from the
 shores of the Mediterranean Sea, may have led them to believe that some'
 superhuman power belonged to such a strangely-balanced mass of rock.</p>
 <p>Nothing can be more certain than that through all time,
 passing on from father to son, there has been a wild reverence of this mass
 of rock; and long after the days when the Druid ceased to be there is every
 reason for believing that the Christian priests, if the) did not encourage,
 did not forbid, the use of this and similar rocks to be used as places of
 ordeal by the uneducated and superstitious people around.</p>
 <p>Hence the mass of rock on which is poised the Logan Stone
 has ever been connected with the supernatural. To the south of the Logan
 Rock is a high peak of granite, towering above the other rocks; this is
 known as the Castle Peak.</p>
 <p>No one can say for how long a period, but most certainly
 for ages, this peak has been the midnight rendezvous for witches, Many a
 man, and woman too, now sleeping quietly in the church yard of St Levan,
 would, had they the power, attest to have seer the witches flying into the
 Castle Peak on moonlight nights mounted on the stems of the ragwort <i>
 (Senecia Jacoboea Linn.) </i>and bringing with them the things necessary to
 make their charms potent and strong.</p>
 <p>This place was long nøted as the gathering place of the
 army of witches who took their departure for Wales, where they would
 luxuriate at the most favoured seasons of the year upon the mill of the
 Welshmen's cows. From this peak many a struggling ship has been watched by a
 malignant crone, while she has been brewing the tempest to destroy it; and
 many a rejoicing chorus has been echoed, in horror, by the cliffs around,
 when the witches have been croaking their miserable delight over the
 perishing crews, as they have watched man, woman, and child drowning whom
 they were presently to rob of the treasures they were bringing home from
 other lands.</p>
 <p>Upon the rocks behind the Logan Rock it would appear that
 every kind of mischief which can befall man or beast was once brewed by the
 St Levan witches.</p>
