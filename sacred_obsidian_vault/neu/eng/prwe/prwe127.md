 <p align="CENTER">THE TWO BREAMS.</p>
 <p>
  Although in common with many of the churches in the remote
 districts of Cornwall, "decay's effacing fingers" have been allowed to do
 their work in St Leven Church, yet there still remains some of the
 ornamental work which once adorned it. Much of the carving is irremediably
 gone; but still the inquirer will find that it once told the story of
 important events in the life of the good St Leven. Two fishes on the same
 hook form the device, which appears at one time to have prevailed in this
 church. These are to commemorate a remarkable incident in St Leven's life.
 One lovely evening about sunset, St Leven was on his rocks fishing. There
 was a heavy pull upon his line, and drawing it in, he found two breams on
 the same hook. The good saint, anxious to serve both alike, to avoid,
 indeed, even the appearance of partiality, took both the fishes off the
 hook, and cast them back into the sea. Again they came to the hook, and
 again were they returned to their native element. The line was no sooner
 cast a third time than the same two fishes hooked themselves once more. St
 Leven thought there must be some reason unknown to him for this strange
 occurrence, so he took both the fishes home with him. When the saint reached
 Bodellen, he found his sister, St Breage, [a] had come to visit him with two
 children. Then he thought he saw the hand of Providence at work in guiding
 the fish to his hook.</p>
 <p>Even saints are blind when they attempt to fathom the
 ways of the Unseen. The fish were, of course, cooked for supper; and the
 saint having asked a blessing upon their savory meal, all sat down to
 partake of it. The children had walked far, and they were ravenously hungry.
 They ate their suppers with rapidity, and, not taking time to pick out the
 bones of the fish, they were both choked. The apparent blessing was thus
 transformed into a curse, and the bream has from that day forward ever gone
 by the name, amongst fishermen, of "choke children."</p>
 <p>There are many disputes as to the fish concerned in this
 legend. Some of the fishermen of St Leven parish have insisted upon their
 being "chad"(the shad, <i>clupeida alosa); </i>while others, with the strong
 evidence afforded by the bony structure of the fish, will have it to have
 been the bream <i>(cyprinus brama). </i>My young readers, warned by the
 name, should be equally careful in eating either of these fish.</p>
 <p>[a] St Breock or Briock, a bishop
 of a diocese in Armorics, is said to have been the patron saint of St
 Breage. But there is a Cornish distict, "Germow Mathern, Breoga Lavethas."
 Germoe was a king, Brasga a midwife, which rather favours the statement that
 St Breage 'was a sister of St Leven. Breage and Germoe are adjoining
 parishes, having the shores of the Mount's Bay for their southen boundaries.
 When the uncultivated inhabitants of this remote region regarded a wreck as
 a "God-send," and plundered without hesitation every body, living or dead,
 thrown upon the shore, these parishes acquired a melancholy notoriety. The
 sailors popular prayer being,</p>
 <p>"God keep us from rocks and
 shelving sands,<br>
 And save us from Breage and Germoe men's lands."</p>
 <p>Happily those days are almost
 forgotten. The ameliorating influences of the Christian faith, which was let
 in upon a most benighted people by John Wesley, like a sunbeams, dispelled
 those evil principles, and gave birth to pore and simple virtues.</p>
