 <p align="CENTER">GWAVAS LAKE.</p>
 <p>
  <br>
 ON the western side of the Mount's Bay, between the fishing. towns of
 Newlyn and Mousehole, is the well-known anchoring-place known by the above
 name. It is not a little curious that any part of the ocean should have been
 called a lake. Tradition, however, helps us to an explanation. Between the
 land on the western side of the bay, and St Michael's Mount on the eastern
 side, there, at one time, extended a forest of beech-trees. Within this
 forest, on the western side, was a large lake, and on its banks a hermitage.
 The saint of the lake was celebrated far and near for his holiness, and his
 small oratory was constantly resorted to by the diseased in body and the
 afflicted in mind. None ever came in the true spirit who failed to find
 relief. The prayers of the saint and the waters of the lake removed the
 severest pains from the limbs and the deepest sorrows from the mind. The young
 were strengthened and the old revived by their influences. The great flood,
 however, which separated the Islands of Scilly from England, submerged the
 forest, and destroyed the lands enclosing this lovely and almost holy lake,
 burying beneath the waters church and houses, and destroying alike the people
 and the priest. Those who survived this sad catastrophe built a church on the
 hill and dedicated it to the saint of the lake--or in Cornish, St Pol --
 modernised into St Paul. [a]</p>
 <p>In support of this tradition, we may see, of a fine
 summer day, when the tide is low and the waters clear, the remains of a
 forest in the line passing from St Michael's Mount to Gwavas. At, neap-tides
 the author has gathered beech-nuts from the sands below Chyandour, and cut
 the wood from the trees embedded in the sand. [b]</p>
 <p>[a] Gwavas Lake. It is said that
 within historic times, tithes, or an equivalent for them, were collected from
 the land which surrounded this lake. I have been informed that the parish
 books of St Paul record the collection of tithes from lands which have
 disappeared. I applied for information on this point to the rector of the
 parish, but he has not yet favoured me with a reply.</p>
 <p>[b] I have passed in a boat from St
 Michael's Mount to Penzance on a summer day, when the waters were very clear,
 and the tide low, and seen the black masses of trees in the white sands
 extending far out into the bay. On one occasion, while I was at school at
 Penzance, after a violent equinactial gale, large trunks of trees were thrown
 up on the shore, just beyond Cbyandour, and then with the other boys I went,
 at the lowest of the tide, far out over the sands, and saw scores of trees
 embedded iu the sands. We gathered nuts--they were beech-nuts--and leaves in
 abundance. It is not a little remarksble,--if it be true, as I am informed it
 is,--that the trees found in the Pentuan Stream Works, under some fifty or
 sixty feet of sand and silt, are beech-trees, and that they were destroyed
 when the fruit was upon them. I learn, that not far from Hull in Yorkshire
 there exists a submerged forest, where also the beech-trees evidently perished
 in the autumn. In Cardigan Bay a large tract of country in said to have been
 lost. May not all these traditions and evidences relate to one great
 cataclysm? See "A Week at the Land's End," by J. T. Blight, for an account of
 the submerged wood near Lariggan Rocks, between Penzance and Newlyn.</p>
