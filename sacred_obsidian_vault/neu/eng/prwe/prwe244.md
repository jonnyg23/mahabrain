 <p align="CENTER">FORTUNE-TELLING, CHARMS, ETC.</p>
 <p>
  IN relation to this subject,
 and confirming an opinion already expressed in the existence still of a
 belief in magic and charms, I print the following communication from a
 lady of considerable literary ability -</p>
 <p>"Every country, it may be safely inferred, has its own
 individual, perhaps characteristic, Charm-record; and inquiry into it
 would more than probably recompense the labour, by the light it would let
 in on the still but little investigated philosophy of the human mind, and
 the growth of popular superstitions. The portion of our country best known
 to the writer of these remarks is Cornwall, remarkable for the picturesque
 wild-ness of its scenery, and not less so for its numerous superstitions.
 The Rev. Charles Kingsley, in his 'Yeast,' has availed himself, with his
 usual tact and power, of one of the most striking of these, having
 reference to the cruel treatment of the Jews, who were sold as slaves to
 work in the mines; the evil treatment they experienced being avenged on
 modem miners, by the terrors the souls of the departed Hebrews inflicted,
 in returning to the scene of their former compulsory toil, and echoing the
 sounds of the workmen now labouring in flesh and blood. But this is a
 digression from the main object of this article--viz., the belief in
 charms. Several years ago, while residing at Falmouth, I remember to have
 heard of a man in humble life, named Thomas Martin, whose abode was said
 to be at a village in the neighbourhood of Redruth, and who accomplished
 wonderful cures of children subject to fits, or personally injured by any
 deformity, by his power of charming. This man also practised soothsaying
 to a considerable extent, and revealed, with unquestionable accuracy,
 where articles mysteriously abstracted were concealed. If a cow suddenly
 lost her milk, whether witchcraft had exerted its malignant influence on
 the non-producing animal or no, such a personage could not but exercise an
 important power over the rustic population of the neighbourhood. But
 belief in the mysterious intelligence of Martin was by no means confined
 to the peasant class. .k highly-respected and even ladylike person told
 the writer, with all the gravity becoming such a communication, that she
 had once made an appointment with Thomas Martin to meet him at a certain
 stile, for the purpose of receiving from him the prediction of her future
 lot,--in other words, having her fortune told; and hastening thither at
 the time appointed, was horrified to find the stile occupied by a large
 black snake. As Martin did not make his appearance, she inferred that he
 had assumed the serpent form, and not being disposed to hold any
 intercourse with a being of such questionable exterior, she hastened away,
 determined never more to risk the attainment of the knowledge she coveted
 through a probably diabolic channel.</p>
 <p>"This anecdote is given as veritable experience of the
 belief which may prevail in a mind fairly intelligent, and generally
 rational in conducting the ordinary business of life.</p>
 <p>"Martin's reputation was disputed by no one, and that
 it continued unimpaired to the close of his life reflects no
 inconsiderable credit on the shrewdness and sagacity of his mind and his
 power of guessing.</p>
 <p>"In the town where the writer has been residing for the
 last four months, there is a female, advanced in years and of good
 character, who, according to the report of many persons,--one a relative
 of her own,--is peculiarly endowed with the power of charming away the
 disease called the 'kennel,' an affection of the eye which causes extreme
 pain. A young lady's father was one evening suffering severe pain in the
 right eye, and after trying various remedies without effect (the agony
 having greatly increased), in her despair she sought an occasion to leave
 the house, and hastened at once to the abode of the charmer. She told her
 errand to the woman, who said that many had come to her for the purpose of
 ridiculing her, and she did not like to say anything about charming,-- she
 did not wish to be laughed at. On this the young lady assured her that her
 object in true faith was to obtain relief for her suffering father, and by
 no means to indulge the spirit of ridicule. On this representation she was
 satisfied, and desired to know the <i>kind</i> of kennel which affected
 the gentleman's eye. This information the daughter was unable to give her,
 being unacquainted with their peculiarities; 'because,' said the charmer,
 'there are nine kinds of kennels,' intimating at the same time that a
 different charm might be said or applied to each,-- so that, to avoid
 omitting any, she must say the charms for all, in order that the one
 especially affecting the diseased eye should be certainly included in the
 charm. She went up-stairs, and remained about half an hour. On her return
 she addressed the young lady, and told her she might go home, where she
 would learn whether the eye had been relieved. She took no money for her
 incantation. Any little present might be offered at a subsequent visit,
 but no direct payment was ever requested, and indeed would have been
 declined. The amazement and pleasure of the anxious daughter, on her
 arrival at home, will be imagined, on learning from her father that the
 intense pain in the eye had ceased during her absence, though he had not
 been made acquainted with her errand. The influence of the faith of
 another, in this case, on the relief of the afflicted person, has no
 verisimilitude save with that of the father of the demoniac in the gospel,
 or the removal of the son's fever in consequence of the faith of the
 father. I have no reason whatever to question the truth of this story,
 which was confirmed by the wife of the gentleman thus relieved.</p>
 <p>"A still more curious instance of the effect of charm,
 though quite of another character, was related to me by the same party.
 The gentleman referred to being much afflicted with cramp, his wife was
 earnestly advised, by a country woman to whom she mentioned the
 circumstance, to request her husband to place his slippers, with the toes
 turned upward, at the foot of the bed. Half smiling at the wise counsel,
 yet perhaps not altogether incredulous, he followed the good woman's
 advice, and to his great comfort found himself unaffected by his dreaded
 enemy throughout the night. His faith being thus established in the
 anti-cramp influence of upturned slippers, he took care to place them, or
 to have them placed, in the prescribed attitude on several successive
 nights. One night, however, he was again seized with some appalling
 twinges, and bethinking himself of the cause, suddenly recollected that in
 hastening into bed he had not observed the important rule; instantly he
 had the slippers restored to their proper position, and, to his
 astonishment and delight, the pain ceased, and visited him no more. After
 this experience of the wonderful effects that followed so simple a
 specific, it may be easily imagined that he did not again risk the return
 of the cramp from neglecting it. Such phenomena seem beyond the power of
 explanation on any known medical principles. If any one more than usually
 versed in the subtle power exercised on the body by the mind, can throw
 light on the slipper cure of the cramp, he will deserve much at the hands
 of physiological and mental science." S. E. M.</p>
