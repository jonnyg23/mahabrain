 <p align="CENTER">THE OLD WOMAN WHO TURNED HER SHIFT</p>
 <p><br>
 IN a lone house--situated not far from the hill on which now stands Knill's
 Steeple, as it is called--which was then known as Chyanwheal, or the <i>House
 on the Mine</i>, lived a lone woman, the widow of a miner, said to have been
 killed in one of the very ancient "coffens," as the open mine-workings
 existing in this hill are termed. A village now bears this name, but it has
 derived it from this lone house. Whether it was that they presumed upon her
 solitude, or whether the old lady had given them some inducement, is not now
 known, but the spriggans of Trencrom Hill were in the habit of meeting almost
 every night in her cottage to divide their plunder. The old woman usually
 slept, or at least she pretended to sleep, during the visit of the spriggans.
 When they left, they always placed a small coin on the table by her bedside,
 and with this indeed the old woman was enabled to provide herself with not
 merely the necessaries of life, but to add thereto a few of those things which
 were luxuries to one iii her position. The old lady, however, was not
 satisfied with this. She resolved to bide her time, and when the spriggans had
 an unusually large amount of plunder, to make herself rich at once and for
 ever at their expense. Such a time at last arrived. The spriggans had
 gathered, we know not how much valuable gold and jewellery. It gleamed and
 glistened on the floor, and the old woman in bed looked on with a most
 covetous eye. After a while, it appears, the spriggans were not able to settle
 the question of division with their usual amicability. The little thieves
 began to quarrel amongst themselves.</p>
 <p>Now, thought the old woman, is my time. Therefore huddling
 herself up under the bedclothes, she very adroitly contrived to turn her
 shift, and having completed the unfailing charm, she jumped from her bed,
 placed her hand on a gold cup, and exclaimed, "Thee shusn't hae one on 'em!"</p>
 <p>In affright the spriggans all scampered away, leaving their
 stolen treasure behind them. The last and boldest of the spriggans, however,
 swept his hand over the old woman's only garment as he left the house. The old
 woman, now wealthy, removed in a little time from Chyanwheal to St Ives, and,
 to the surprise of every one, purchased property and lived like a gentlewoman.
 Whenever, however, she put on the shift which had secured her her wealth, she
 was tortured beyond endurance. The doctors and all the learned people used
 hard names to describe her pains, but the wise women knew all along that they
 came of the spriggans.</p>
