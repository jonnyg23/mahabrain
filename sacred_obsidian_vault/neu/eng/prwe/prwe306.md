 <p align="CENTER">THE TOWER OF MINSTER CHURCH.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">"The Minster of the Trees! a lonely dell,<br>
 Deep with old oaks, and 'mid their quiet shade,<br>
 Gray with the moss of years, yon antique cell !<br>
 Sad are those walls: the cloister lowly laid,<br>
 Where pacing monks at solemn evening made<br>
 Their chanted orisons: and as the breeze<br>
 Came up the vale,<sup> </sup>by rock and tree delay'd,<br>
 They heard the awful voice of many seas<br>
 Blend with thy pausing hymn, thou Minister of the
 Trees !"<br>
 HAWKER.</p>
 <p>ON a visit to this old church, which is allowed to
 perish under the influences of damp and the accompanying vegetable growth,
 in a way which is but little creditable to the parishioners, I was struck
 at the evidence that the tower had either been taken down or that it had
 fallen. Amidst the long grass of the churchyard I found many remains of
 carved stones, which clearly belonged at one time to the tower. I sought
 for some information, but I could obtain none. The officiating clergyman,
 and several gentlemen of Boscastle, were alike ignorant of any tradition
 connected with the tower--the prevalent idea being that it was left
 unfinished.</p>
 <p>At length, the ostler at the inn informed me that the
 story of the destruction of the tower ran thus:</p>
 <p>The tower of the church of the ancient abbey was seen
 through the gorge which now forms the harbour of Boscastle, far out at
 sea. The monks were in the habit of placing a light in one of the windows
 of the tower to guide the worshippers at night to the minster.</p>
 <p>Frequently sailors mistook this, by day for some
 land-mark, and at night for a beacon, and were thus led into a trap from
 which they could not easily extricate themselves, and within which they
 often perished. This accident occurred so frequently that the sailors
 began at last to declare their belief that the monks purposely beguiled
 them to their fate, hinting, indeed, that plunder was their object.
 Eventually, a band of daring men, who had been thus lured into Boscastle,
 went to the abbey, and, in spite of the exertions made by the monks, they
 pulled down the tower, since which time it has never been rebuilt.</p>
