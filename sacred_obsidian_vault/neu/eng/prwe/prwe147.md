 <p align="CENTER">THE WELL OF ST KEYNE.</p>
 <p>ST KEYNE came to this well about five hundred years before
 the Norman Conquest, and imparted a strange virtue to its waters--namely,
 that whichever of a newly-married couple should first drink thereof, was to
 enjoy the sweetness of domestic sovereignty ever after.</p>
 <p>Situated in a thickly-wooded district, the well of St Keyne
 presents a singularly picturesque appearance. "Four trees of divers kinds"
 grow over the well, imparting a delightful shade, and its clear waters spread
 an emerald luxuriance around. Once, and once only, have I paid a visit to this
 sacred spot. Then and there I found a lady drinking of the waters from her
 thimble, and eagerly contending with her husband that the right to rule was
 hers. The man, however, mildly insisted upon it that he had had the first
 drink, as he had rushed before his wife, and dipping his fingers into the
 water had sucked them. This the lady contended was not drinking, and she, I
 have no doubt, through life had the best of the argument.</p>
 <p>Tonkin says, in his "History of Cornwall," "Did it retain
 this wondrous quality, as it does to this day the shape, I believe there would
 be to it a greater resort of both sexes than either to Bath or Tunbridge; for
 who would not be fond of attaining this longed for sovereignty ?" He then
 adds, "Since the writing of this, the. trees were blown down by a violent
 storm, and in their place Mr Rashleigh, in whose land it is, has planted two
 oaks, an ash, and an elm, which thrive well; but the wonderful arch is
 destroyed." The author can add to this that (as he supposes, owing to the
 alteration made in the trees) the sovereign virtues of the waters have
 perished.</p>
 <p>Southey's ballad will be remembered by most readers
 :-- </p>
 <p>"A well there is in the west country,<br>
 And a clearer one never was seen;<br>
 There is not a wife in the west country<br>
 But has heard of the Well of St Keyne.</p>
 <p>"An oak and an elm-tree stand beside,<br>
 And behind doth an ash-tree grow,<br>
 And a willow from the bank above<br>
 Droops to the water below."</p>
 <p>It has been already stated that, sitting in St Michael's
 Chair, on the tower of the church of St Michael's Mount, has the same virtue
 as the waters of this well; and that this remarkable power was the gift of the
 same St Keyne who imparted such wonderful properties to this well.</p>
