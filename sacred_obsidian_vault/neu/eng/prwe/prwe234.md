 <p align="CENTER">CHRISTMAS AT ST IVES.</p>
 <p align="CENTER">"THE GUISE-DANCING."</p>
 <p>"WE doubt if there is a spot in 'merrie England' where
 Christmas receives so hearty a welcome, and is 'made so much of,' as in the
 old-fashioned 'antient borough of beloved St Ives.' It is often said that
 'extremes meet;' but as well might we expect the extremities of Britain--
 John o'Groat's and Cape Cornwall--to meet, as that the frolic-loving
 descendants of Albion will ever imitate the cold, mountain-nurtured
 Caledonians in their observance of Christmas time. For months previous to
 the merry-making time, preparations are made for the approaching 'carnival;'
 we can assure our readers that never were the real 'carnivals' ushered in
 with greater festivities at Rome or Venice, in the zenith of their glory,
 than is observed here at Christmas. Were many of the denizens of our large
 towns to witness the making up of the scores of 'sugar loaf,'
 'three-cocked,' and indescribable-shaped hats, caps, bonnets, bloomer
 skirts, leggings, jackets, &amp;c., numberless <i>et ceteras </i>of the most
 grotesque and pantomimic character, colour, and shape, which goes on in
 October and November, they would imagine there was to be a <i>bal masque </i>
 on a large scale, or a pantomime at 'the theatre,' of metropolitan
 proportions. But not so, for there is not even a singing-class in the town,
 if we except the choirs of the various congregations; and all 'this wilful
 waste' of long cloth, scarlet, ringstraked, and speckled, is to do honour to
 King Christmas during the twelve nights which intervene 'twixt the birth of
 Christmas common and Christmas proper, which said outward manifestations of
 honour are known in the neighbourhood as 'Christmas geezze-daancing,' or
 guise-dancing; but of this presently. Not only are the 'lovers of pleasure'
 on the alert, but the choirs of the different places of worship strive to
 'get up' a piece or two to tickle the ears of their hearers on
 Christmas-night, and the house that boasts the best 'singing seat' is sure
 to be crammed by persons attracted by the twofold advantage of a short
 sermon and a good lively tune. A pretty brisk trade is carried on by
 children in the retailing unquenched lime, in small quantities to suit the
 convenience of purchasers; and few are the domiciles but have had a lick of
 the lime brush, either on the wall, window-sill; door-post, or chimney. 'A
 slut, indeed,' is she declared who refuses to have a thorough clean out
 before Christmas. New shoes and clothes are worn for the first .time on the
 great holiday; and woe betide the unlucky Crispin who, by some unaccountable
 oversight, has neglected to make Jennifer's bran new shoes, for, her to go
 and see how Smart the church is on Christmas-day. As in other parts of
 England, a pretty large sum is spent in evergreens, such as holly, or, as it
 is called here, 'prickly Christmas,' bays, and laurels. Of mistletoe and
 cypress there is very little in the neighbourhood, and the windows of shops
 and private dwellings, as well as the parish church, are profusely and
 tastefully decorated. As to provisions, there is no lack. Many a flock of
 geese has been bespoken and set apart for private customers; whilst the ears
 of the grocers, who generally do a supplementary trade in swine's flesh, are
 so accustomed to receive a month's notice for 'a nice bit of flea (spare)
 rib,' that they are loath to engage any of the porcine fraternity that are
 not all rib. The Christmas market is not a mean affair at St Ives; if the
 butchers cannot boast of many prize oxen or 'South Downs,' they generally
 manage to make the best of their 'home-raised' and well-fed cattle, and the
 stalls are 'titivated off' nicely too. This year, however, the inspector of
 nuisances, who is also market-toll collector and police constable, sergeant,
 and inspector, actually refused to clean, or allow to be cleaned, the St
 Ives Market on Tuesday for the Christmas-eve market, because there was no
 extra tolls payable for the Christmas markets, and, as may be expected, the
 epithets bestowed on him were by no means flattering or complimentary--we
 did hear of a suggestion to put the 'gentleman' policeman in an aldermanic
 stall on the 5th of next November, or maybe during the guise-dancing.
 Tradesmen have for the most part 'cacht their jobs,' and the good house'
 wife 'done her churs in season' on Christmas-eve. In many families, a crock
 of ' fish and tatees' is discussed in West-Cornwall style before the
 'singers' commence their time-honoured carol, 'While Shepherds,' which is
 invariably sung to 'the same old tune,' struck by some novice in <i>u </i>
 flat. There is usually a host of young men and maidens to accompany the
 'singers;' these are composed of the choirs of two or three dissenting
 bodies, who chiefly select the members of their respective congregations for
 the honour of being disturbed from a sound nap on the eventful morning. The
 last two or three years the choirs have done their carolling amongst the
 most respectable of the inhabitants on the evening of Christmas-day, after
 divine service.</p>
 <p>"On Christmas-day the mayor, aldermen, and councillors walk
 in pro. cession to church from the house of the mayor for the time being.
 The church is, as we have before remarked, gaily decked with evergreens. Two
 or three days after the singers make a call 'for something for singing,' the
 proceeds, which are pretty handsome, being spent in a substantial supper for
 the choir.</p>
 <p>"But of the 'guise-dancing,' which has found a last retreat
 at St Ives,--this is the only town in the country where the old Cornish
 Christmas revelry is kept up with spirit. The guise-dancing time is the
 twelve nights after Christmas, <i>i.e., </i>from Christmas-day to
 Twelfth-day. Guise-dancing at St Ives is no more nor less than a pantomimic
 representation or <i>bal masque </i>on an extensive scale, the performers
 outnumbering the audience, who in this case take their stand at the corners
 of the streets, which are but badly lighted with gas, and rendered still
 more dismal of late years by the closing of the tradesmen's shops after 
 sunset during this season, on account of the noise and uproar occasioned,
 the town being literally given up to a lawless mob, who go about yelling and
 hooting in an unearthly manner, itt a tone between a screech and a howl, so
 as to render their voices as undistinguishable as their buffoon-looking
 dresses. Here a Chinese is exhibiting 'vite mishe' and 'Dutch dops;' there a
 turbaned Indian asks you if you 'vant a silver vatch.' A little further on
 you meet with a Highlander with 'dops to cure the gout.' The
 home-impoverishing packman, or duffer, has also his representative, urging
 to be allowed just to leave 'a common low-price dress at an uncommon high
 price, and a quartern of his 6s. sloe-leaves of the best quality.' Faithless 
 swains not infrequently get served out by the friends of the discarded one
 at this time, whilst every little peccadillo meets with a just rebuke and
 exposure. About eighteen years ago, a party of youngsters, to give more
 variety to the sports, constructed a few nice representations of elephants,
 horses, and--start not gentle reader--lifelike facsimiles of that
 proverbially stupid brute, the ass. For several seasons it was quite a treat
 to witness the antics of the self-constituted elephants, horses, and asses,
 in the thoroughfares of this little town. On the whole, the character of the
 guise-dancing has degenerated very much this last twenty years. It was
 formerly the custom for parties to get up a little play, and go from house
 to house to recite their droll oddities, and levy contributions on their
 hearers in the form of cake or plum-pudding. Wassailing, as far as I can
 learn, never obtained much in this neighbourhood. Old Father Christmas and
 bold King George were favourite characters. It is not uncommon to see a most
 odiously-disguised person with a bedroom utensil, asking the blushing
 bystanders if there is 'any need of me.' Some of the dresses are, indeed,
 very smart, and even costly; but for the most part they consist of old
 clothes, arranged in the oddest manner, even frightfully ugly. It is
 dangerous for children, and aged or infirm persons, to venture out after
 dark, as the roughs generally are armed with a sweeping-rush or a
 shillalagh. The uproar at times is so tremendous as to be only equalled in a
 'rale Irish row.' As may be anticipated, these annual diversions have a very
 demoralising influence on the young, on account of the licentious nature of
 the conversation indulged in, though we really wonder that there are not
 many more instances of annoyance and insult than now take place, when we
 consider that but for such times as Christmas and St Ives feast, the
 inhabitants have no place of amusement, recreation, or public instruction;
 there being no library, reading-room, institution, literary or scientific,
 or evening class; and unless there is one at the National School room, not a
 night school or even a working-men's institution is in the town.</p>
 <p>"We should not omit that one of the old customs still
 observed is the giving apprentices three clear holidays (not including
 Sunday) after Christmas-day, though we hear of attempts being made to lessen
 this treat to the youngsters. If we don't wish success to these efforts, we
 do desire those should succeed who will endeavour to impart to our rising
 population a thorough contempt for guise-dancing and all such unmeaning
 buffoonery. There is one thing which must not be overlooked--viz., the few
 drunken brawls that occur at such times. Cases of drunkenness certainly
 occur, but these are far below the average of towns of its size, the
 population being in 1861 (parliamentary limits) 10,354."--St <i>lves:
