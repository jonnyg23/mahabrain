 <p align="CENTER">BET TY STOGS AND JAN THE MOUNSTER.</p>
 <p><br>
 IN the "high countries," as the parishes of Morva, Zennor, and Towednack are
 called, there has long existed a tradition that the children of dirty, lazy,
 "courseying" women are often taken away by the Small People, carefully
 cleansed, and then returned--of course all the more beautiful for being
 washed by the fairies in morning-dew. This notion has evidently prevailed for
 many ages, and, like many an old tradition, it has been remodelled in each
 generation to adapt it to the conditions of the time. The following is but
 slightly modified in its principal characteristics from a story somewhat
 coarsely told, and greatly extended, by an old woman in Morva. A woman, up the
 higher side, called Betty Stogs, very nearly lost her baby a few months ago.
 Stogs was only a nickname, but every one knew her by that and no other. It was
 given to her because she was so untidy about the feet and legs. She could not
 darn a hole in her stocking--the lazy sluit could never knit one. Betty was
 always pulling the legs of her stockings down under her feet, that the holes
 in her heels might not be seen--as long as the tops would come under the
 garter--and she often gartered half-way down the leg to meet the necessities
 of the case. Betty was reared up in Towednack, at no great distance from Wheal
 Reeth, at which Bal the old man, her father, worked. He also farmed a few
 acres of land, and, "out of core," he and his daughter worked on it. The old
 people used to say--they wouldn't put the poor innocent chield to work to
 Bal, for fear the great rough heathens from Lelant might overcome her; so they
 kept her at home, and the old man would brag how his Betty could cut furze and
 turf. Instead of staying at home in the evenings, Betty was always racing
 round the lanes to class-meetings; for she had been a "professor ever since'
 she was a chield." Betty was an only child, and the old people had saved a
 little money, and they hoped some one "above the common" would marry her. In
 Higher Side there lived a man called Jan the Mounster (monster), and, tempted
 by the bit of money, he resolved to lay himself out to catch Betty. Jan became
 a converted character--he met in the same class with Betty, a expressed
 himself as being "so fond of the means of grace." Things went on in this way
 for some time, and it was found that Betty "had met with a misfortune." The
 old people were now in a great hurry to marry their daughter, and promised Jan
 money enough. to buy a set of cheene (china), and lots of beautiful clome
 (earthenware); but Mounster required more than this, and fought off. He left
 the "people," that he mightn't be read out. He said he was heartily sick of
 the lot, told strange stories about their doings, and became as bad a
 character as ever. Time advanced, and Betty 's mother--who was herself a
 wretchedly dirty woman, and, as people said, too fond of the "drop of drink "--
 saw that she must lose no chance of making her daughter an honest woman. So
 she went to Penzance and bought a new bed--a real four-poster--a new
 dresser, painted bright lead and liver colour--an eight-day clock, in a
 painted mahogany case--a mass of beautiful clome--and a glass milk-cup. When
 all these things were ranged in cottage, Jan was well enough pleased with
 them, and hung his "great turnip of a watch" up in the middle of the dresser,
 to see how it would look. When he had satisfied himself he told the old woman
 he would marry Betty out of hand, if she would give them their great pretty,
 bright, warming-pan to hang opposite the door. This was soon settled, and Jan
 the Mounster and Betty Stogs were married.</p>
 <p>In a little time the voice of a baby was heard in Jan's
 cottage, but the poor child had no cradle, only a "costan" (a straw and
 bramble basket); and, in addition to the ordinary causes of neglect, another
 cause was introduced--Betty took to drink. A great, nasty suss of a woman,
 who went about pretending to sell crochet-work, but in reality to sell gin --
 which she kept in a bottle under the dirty rags, which she called "the most
 beautiful croshar-work collars and cuffs, that all the ladies in the towns and
 up the country wear on Sundays and high holidays "--formed a close
 acquaintance with Jan's wife. The result was, things went from bad to worse.
 Jan was discontented, and went to Bal, and returned from Bal always a sullen
 man. One day Betty had to bake some bread--she had never before done so, as
 her mother had always attended to that job. Jan had left his watch hanging to
 the dresser, that Betty might know the time. All went well till the middle of
 the day; and, just as the bread was ready to put down, in came the
 crochet-woman. First Betty had a noggin of gin--she then had her fortune told
 -- and because she was promised no end of good luck and the handsomest children
 in the country, and Jan the best luck in tribute-pitches, the kettle was
 boiled, and some pork fried for the fortune-teller.</p>
 <p>All this time the dough was forgotten, and it was getting
 sour and heavy. At last, when the woman went away, the lump of sour "leven"
 was put down to bake. The neglected child got troublesome, and as Jan would be
 home early to supper, Betty was in a great hurry to get things done. To quiet
 the child, she gave it Jan's watch; and, that it might be the better pleased,
 she opened it, "that the dear chield might see the pretty little wheels
 spinning round." In a short time the "machine" was thrown down in the ashes,
 and it, of course, stopped. Betty, at last, wished to know the time; she then
 found the watch clogged full of dirt. To put the thing to rights she washed it
 out in the kettle of dish-water, which had not been changed for two or three
 days, and was thick with salt pilchard-bones, and potato-skins. She did her
 best to clean the watch, for she was now terribly afraid of Jan, and she wiped
 all the little wheels, as far as she could reach, with the corner of the
 dishcloth, but the confounded thing would not go. She had to bake the bread by
 guess; and, therefore, when she took it up, it was as black as soot, and as
 hard as a stone.</p>
 <p>Jan came home; and you may judge the temper he was in at
 finding things as they were, and his watch stopped. Betty swore to the deepest
 that she had never taken the thing into her hands. Next morning Jan got up
 early to go to Bal; and taking the burnt loaf, he tried to cut it with a
 knife, but it was in vain--as well try to cut a stone; next he tried the dag
 (axe), and Mounster said it strook fire, and the dag never made the least mark
 in the crust.</p>
 <p>The poor fellow had to go to his work without his
 breakfast, and to depend upon the share of a comrade's fuggun for dinner.</p>
 <p>Next day, Friday, was pay-day, and Jan having got his pay,
 went to St Ives for bread, and took the precious watch with him to be set to
 rights. The watchmaker soon found out the complaint; here was a bit of
 fish-bone, there a piece of potato-paring; in one tooth a piece of worsted
 from a dishcloth, in another a particle of straw, and ashes everywhere.</p>
 <p>The murder was out; and that night Jan, having first drunk
 to excess in St Ives, went home and nearly murdered his wife. From this time
 Jan was drunk every day, and Betty was so as often as she could get gin. The
 poor child was left half the day to suck his thumbs, and to tumble and loss on
 the filthy rags in the old costan, without any one to look after it.</p>
 <p>One day Betty was in a "courseying" mood, and went from
 house to house, wherever she could find a woman idle enough to gossip with
 her. Betty stayed away till dark--it was Jan's last core by day--and the
 poor child was left all alone.</p>
 <p>When she came home she was surprised not to hear the child,
 but she thought it might have cried itself to sleep, and was not concerned. At
 last, having lit the candle, she looked in the costan, and there was no child
 to be seen. Betty searched about, in and out, every place she could think of;
 still there were no signs of the child. This pretty well sobered Betty, and
 she remembered that she had to unlock the door to get into the cottage.</p>
 <p>While yet full of fear and trembling to meet her husband,
 Jan came home from Bal. He was, of course, told that his "croom of a chield
 was lost." He didn't believe a word of what Betty told him, but he went about
 and called up all the neighbours, who joined him in the search. They spent the 
 night in examining every spot around the house and in the village--all in
 vain.</p>
 <p>After daybreak they were all assembled in deep and earnest
 consultation, when the cat came running into the house, with her tail on end,
 and mewing anxiously. She ran forth and back round a brake of furze,
 constantly crying, as if she wished the people to follow her. After a long
 time some one thought of going after the cat, and in the middle of the
 furze-brake, on a beautiful green, soft spot of mossy grass, was the baby
 sleeping, "as sweet as a little nut," wrapped carefully up in some old dry
 gowns, and all its clothes clean and dry. When they unwrapped the child, they
 found he was covered over with bright flowers, as we place them round a babe
 in the coffin. He had a bunch of violets in his dear little hands, and there
 were wallflowers and primroses, and balm and mint spread over his body. The
 furze was high all around, so that no cold wind could reach the infant. Every
 one declared that the child never looked so handsome before. It was plain
 enough, said the old women, that the Small People had taken the child and
 washed it from top to toe; that their task of cleansing the babe was a long
 one, and that the sun arose before they could finish it; that they had placed
 the child where it was found, intending to take it away the next night.</p>
 <p>They were never known to come for the babe, but every one
 said that this affair worked a great change in Betty Stogs and in Jan the
 Mounster. The cottage was kept tidy, the child clean; and its father and
 mother drank less, and lived happier, for ever afterwards.</p>
