 <p align="CENTER">THE DISCOVERY OF TIN.</p>
 <p>St Piran, or St Perran, leading his lonely life on the
 plains which now bear his name, devoted himself to the study of the objects
 which presented themselves to his notice. The good saint decorated the altar
 in his church with the choicest flowers, and his cell was adorned with the
 crystals which he could collect from the neighbouring rocks. In his wanderings
 on the sea-shore, St Perran could not but observe the numerous mineral, veins
 running through the slate-rocks forming the beautiful cliffs on this coast.
 Examples of every kind he collected; and on one occasion, when preparing his
 humble meal, a heavy black stone was employed to form a pan of the fireplace.
 The fire was more intense than usual, and a stream of beautiful white metal
 flowed out of the fire. Great was the joy of the saint; he perceived that God,
 in His goodness, had discovered to him something which would be useful to man.
 St Perran communicated his discovery to St Chiwidden. [a] They examined the
 shores together, and Chiwidden, who was learned in the learning of the East,
 soon devised a process for producing this metal in large quantities. The two
 saints called the Cornish men together. They told them of their treasures, and
 they taught them how to dig the ore from the earth, and how, by the agency of
 fire, to obtain the metal. Great was the joy in Cornwall, and many days of
 feasting followed the announcement. Mead and metheglin, with other drinks,
 flowed in abundance; and vile rumour says the saints and their people were
 rendered equally unstable thereby. "Drunk as a Perraner," has certainly passed
 into a proverb from that day.</p>
 <p>The riot of joy at length came to an end, and steadily,
 seriously, the tribes of</p>
 <p>Perran and St Agnes set to work. They soon accumulated a
 vast quantity of this precious metal; and when they carried it to the southern
 coasts, the merchants from Gaul eagerly purchased it of them. The noise of the
 discovery, even in those days, rapidly extended itself; and even the cities of
 Tyre learned that a metal, precious to them, was to be obtained in a country
 far to the west. The Phoenician navigators were not long in finding out the
 Tin Islands; and great was the alarm amidst the Cornish Britons lest the
 source of their treasure should be discovered. Then it was they intrenched the
 whole of St Agnes beacon; then it was they built the numerous hill castles
 which have puzzled the antiquarian; then it was that they constructed the
 rounds,--amongst which the Perran Round remains as a remarkable example, --
 all of them to protect their tin ground. So resolved were the whole of the
 population of the district to preserve the tin workings, that they prevented
 any foreigner from landing on the mainland, and they established tin markets
 on the islands on the coast. On these islands were hoisted the standard of
 Cornwall, a white cross on a black ground, which was the device of St Perran
 and St Chiwidden, symbolising the black tin ore and the white metal. [b]</p>
