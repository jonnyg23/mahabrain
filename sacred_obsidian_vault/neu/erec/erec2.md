 <h1 align="CENTER">EREC ET ENIDE</h1>
 
 <h2 align="CENTER">Part II: Vv. 2293 - Vv. 4579</h2>
 
 <br>
  
 (Vv. 2293-2764.)  Erec wished to delay no longer.  As soon as he
 had the King's leave, he bid his wife make her preparations, and
 he retained as his escort sixty knights of merit with horses and
 with dappled and grey furs.  As soon as he was ready for his
 journey, he tarried little further at court, but took leave of
 the Queen and commended the knights to God.  The Queen grants him
 leave to depart.  At the hour of prime he set out from the royal
 palace.  In the presence of them all he mounted his steed, and
 his wife mounted the dappled horse which she had brought from her
 own country; then all his escort mounted.  Counting knights and
 squires, there were full seven score in the train.  After four
 long days' journey over hills and slopes, through forests,
 plains, and streams, they came on the fifth day to Camant, where
 King Lac was residing in a very charming town.  No one ever saw
 one better situated; for the town was provided with forests and
 meadow-land, with vineyards and farms, with streams and orchards,
 with ladies and knights, and fine, lively youths, and polite,
 well-mannered clerks who spent their incomes freely, with fair
 and charming maidens, and with prosperous burghers.  Before Erec
 reached the town, he sent two knights ahead to announce his
 arrival to the King.  When he heard the news, the King had
 clerks, knights, and damsels quickly mount, and ordered the bells
 to be rung, and the streets to be hung with tapestries and silken
 stuffs, that his son might be received with joy; then he himself
 got on his horse.  Of clerks there were present fourscore, gentle
 and honourable men, clad in grey cloaks bordered with sable.  Of
 knights there were full five hundred, mounted on bay, sorrel, or
 white-spotted steeds.  There were so many burghers and dames that
 no one could tell the number of them.  The King and his son
 galloped and rode on till they saw and recognised each other.
 They both jump down from their horses and embrace and greet each
 other for a long time, without stirring from the place where they
 first met.  Each party wished the other joy: the King makes much
 of Erec, but all at once breaks off to turn to Enide.  On all
 sides he is in clover: he embraces and kisses them both, and
 knows not which of the two pleases him the more.  As they gaily
 enter the castle, the bells all ring their peals to honour Erec's
 arrival.  The streets are all strewn with reeds, mint, and iris.
 and are hung overhead with curtains and tapestries of fancy silk
 and satin stuffs.  There was great rejoicing; for all the people
 came together to see their new lord, and no one ever saw greater
 happiness than was shown alike by young and old.  First they came
 to the church, where very devoutly they were received in a
 procession.  Erec kneeled before the altar of the Crucifix, and
 two knights led his wife to the image of Our Lady.  When she had
 finished her prayer, she stepped back a little and crossed
 herself with her right hand, as a well-bred dame should do.  Then
 they came out from the church and entered the royal palace, when
 the festivity began.  That day Erec received many presents from
 the knights and burghers: from one a palfrey of northern stock,
 and from another a golden cup.  One presents him with a golden
 pigeon-hawk, another with a setter-dog, this one a greyhound,
 this other a sparrowhawk, and another a swift Arab steed, this
 one a shield, this one an ensign, this one a sword, and this a
 helmet.  Never was a king more gladly seen in his kingdom, nor
 received with greater joy, as all strove to serve him well.  Yet
 greater joy they made of Enide than of him, for the great beauty
 which they saw in her, and still more for her open charm.  She
 was seated in a chamber upon a cushion of brocade which had been
 brought from Thessaly.  Round about her was many a fair lady; yet
 as the lustrous gem outshines the brown flint, and as the rose
 excels the poppy, so was Enide fairer than any other lady or
 damsel to be found in the world, wherever one might search.  She
 was so gentle and honourable, of wise speech and affable, of
 pleasing character and kindly mien.  No one could ever be so
 watchful as to detect in her any folly, or sign of evil or
 villainy.  She had been so schooled in good manners that she had
 learned all virtues which any lady can possess, as well as
 generosity and knowledge.  All loved her for her open heart, and
 whoever could do her any service was glad and esteemed himself
 the more.  No one spoke any ill of her, for no one could do so.
 In the realm or empire there was no lady of such good manners.
 But Erec loved her with such a tender love that he cared no more
 for arms, nor did he go to tournaments, nor have any desire to
 joust; but he spent his time in cherishing his wife.  He made of
 her his mistress and his sweetheart.  He devoted all his heart
 and mind to fondling and kissing her, and sought no delight in
 other pastime.  His friends grieved over this, and often
 regretted among themselves that he was so deep in love.  Often it
 was past noon before he left her side; for there he was happy,
 say what they might.  He rarely left her society, and yet he was
 as open-handed as ever to his knights with arms, dress, and
 money.  There was not a tournament anywhere to which he did not
 send them well apparelled and equipped.  Whatever the cost might
 be, he gave them fresh steeds for the tourney and joust.  All the
 knights said it was a great pity and misfortune that such a
 valiant man as he was wont to be should no longer wish to bear
 arms.  He was blamed so much on all sides by the knights and
 squires that murmurs reached Enide's ears how that her lord had
 turned craven about arms and deeds of chivalry, and that his
 manner of life was greatly changed. (26)  She grieved sorely over
 this, but she did not dare to show her grief; for her lord at
 once would take affront, if she should speak to him.  So the
 matter remained a secret, until one morning they lay in bed where
 they had had sport together.  There they lay in close embrace,
 like the true lovers they were.  He was asleep, but she was
 awake, thinking of what many a man in the country was saying of
 her lord.  And when she began to think it all over, she could not
 keep back the tears.  Such was her grief and her chagrin that by
 mischance she let fall a word for which she later felt remorse,
 though in her heart there was no guile.  She began to survey her
 lord from head to foot, his well-shaped body and his clear
 countenance, until her tears fell fast upon the bosom of her
 lord, and she said: "Alas, woe is me that I ever left my country!
 What did I come here to seek?  The earth ought by right to
 swallow me up when the best knight, the most hardy, brave, fair,
 and courteous that ever was a count or king, has completely
 abjured all his deeds of chivalry because of me.  And thus, in
 truth, it is I who have brought shame upon his head, though I
 would fain not have done so at any price."  Then she said to him:
 "Unhappy thou!"  And then kept silence and spoke no more.  Erec
 was not sound asleep and, though dozing, heard plainly what she
 said.  He aroused at her words, and much surprised to see her
 weeping, he asked her: "Tell me, my precious beauty, why do you
 weep thus?  What has caused you woe or sorrow?  Surely it is my
 wish to know.  Tell me now, my gentle sweetheart; and raise care
 to keep nothing back, why you said that woe was me?  For you said
 it of me and of no one else.  I heard your words plainly enough."
 Then was Enide in a great plight, afraid and dismayed.  "Sire,"
 says she, "I know nothing of what you say."  "Lady, why do you
 conceal it?  Concealment is of no avail.  You hare been crying; I
 can see that, and you do not cry for nothing.  And in my sleep I
 heard what you said."  "Ah!  fair sire, you never heard it, and I
 dare say it was a dream."  "Now you are coming to me with lies. 
 I hear you calmly lying to me.  But if you do not tell me the
 truth now, you will come to repent of it later."  "Sire, since
 you torment me thus, I will tell you the whole truth, and keep
 nothing back.  But I am afraid that you will not like it.  In
 this land they all say -- the dark, the fair, and the ruddy --
 that it is a great pity that you should renounce your arms; your
 reputation has suffered from it.  Every one used to say not long
 ago that in all the world there was known no better or more
 gallant knight.  Now they all go about making game of you -- old
 and young, little and great -- calling you a recreant.  Do you
 suppose it does not give me pain to hear you thus spoken of with
 scorn?  It grieves me when I hear it said, and yet it grieves me
 more that they put the blame for it on me.  Yes, I am blamed for
 it, I regret to say, and they all assert it is because I have so
 ensnared and caught you that you are losing all your merit, and
 do not care for aught but me.  You must choose another course, so
 that you may silence this reproach and regain your former fame;
 for I have heard too much of this reproach, and yet I did not
 dare to disclose it to you.  Many a time, when I think of it, I
 have to weep for very grief.  Such chagrin I felt just now that I
 could not keep myself from saying that you were ill-starred."
 "Lady," said he, "you were in the right, and those who blame me
 do so with reason.  And now at once prepare yourself to take the
 road.  Rise up from here, and dress yourself in your richest
 robe, and order your saddle to be put on your best palfrey."  Now
 Enide is in great distress: very sad and pensive, she gets up,
 blaming and upbraiding herself for the foolish words she spoke:
 she had now made her bed, and must lie in it.  "Ah!" said she,
 "poor fool!  I was too happy, for there lacked me nothing.  God!
 why was I so forward as to dare to utter such folly?  God!  did
 not my lord love me to excess?  In faith, alas, he was too fond
 of me.  And now I must go away into exile.  But I have yet a
 greater grief, that I shall no longer see my lord, who loved me
 with such tenderness that there was nothing he held so dear.  The
 best man that was ever born had become so wrapped up in me that
 he cared for nothing else.  I lacked for nothing then.  I was
 very happy.  But pride it is that stirred me up: because of my
 pride, I must suffer woe for telling him such insulting words,
 and it is right that I should suffer woe.  One does not know what
 good fortune is until he has made trial of evil."  Thus the lady
 bemoaned her fate, while she dressed herself fitly in her richest
 robe.  Yet nothing gave her any pleasure, but rather cause for
 deep chagrin.  Then she had a maid call one of her squires, and
 bids him saddle her precious palfrey of northern stock, than
 which no count or king ever had a better.  As soon as she had
 given him the command, the fellow asked for no delay, but
 straightway went and saddled the dappled palfrey. And Erec
 summoned another squire and bade him bring his arms to arm his
 body withal.  Then he went up into a bower, and had a Limoges rug
 laid out before him on the floor.  Meanwhile, the squire ran to
 fetch the arms and came back and laid them on the rug.  Erec took
 a seat opposite, on the figure of a leopard which was portrayed
 on the rug.  He prepares and gets ready to put on his arms:
 first, he had laced on a pair of greaves of polished steel; next,
 he dons a hauberk, which was so fine that not a mesh could be cut
 away from it.  This hauberk of his was rich, indeed, for neither
 inside nor outside of it was there enough iron to make a needle,
 nor could it gather any rust; for it was all made of worked
 silver in tiny meshes triple-wove; and it was made with such
 skill that I can assure you that no one who had put it on would
 have been more uncomfortable or sore because of it, than if he
 had put on a silk jacket over his undershirt.  The knights and
 squires all began to wonder why he was being armed; but no one
 dared to ask him why.  When they had put on his hauberk, a valet
 laces about his head a helmet fluted with a band of gold, shining
 brighter than a mirror.  Then he takes the sword and girds it on,
 and orders them to bring him saddled his bay steed of Gascony.
 Then he calls a valet to him, and says: "Valet, go quickly, run
 to the chamber beside the tower where my wife is, and tell her
 that she is keeping me waiting here too long.  She has spent too
 much time on her attire.  Tell her to come and mount at once, for
 I am awaiting her."  And the fellow goes and finds her all ready,
 weeping and making moan: and he straightway addressed her thus:
 "Lady, why do you so delay?  My lord is awaiting you outside
 yonder, already fully armed.  He would have mounted some time
 ago, had you been ready."  Enide wondered greatly what her lord's
 intention was; but she very wisely showed herself with as
 cheerful a countenance as possible, when she appeared before him.
 In the middle of the courtyard she found him, and King Lac comes
 running out.  Knights come running, too, striving with each other
 to reach there first.  There is neither young nor old but goes to
 learn and ask if he will take any of them with him.  So each
 offers and presents himself.  But he states definitely and
 affirms that he will take no companion except his wife, asserting
 that he will go alone.  Then the King is in great distress. 
 "Fair son," says he, "what dost thou intend to do?  Thou shouldst
 tell me thy business and keep nothing back.  Tell me whither thou
 will go; for thou art unwilling on any account to be accompanied
 by an escort of squires or knights.  If thou hast undertaken to
 fight some knight in single combat, yet shouldst thou not for
 that reason fail to take a part of thy knights with thee to
 betoken thy wealth and lordship.  A king's son ought not to fare
 alone.  Fair son, have thy sumpters loaded now, and take thirty
 or forty or more of thy knights, and see that silver and gold is
 taken, and whatever a gentleman needs."  Finally Erec makes reply
 and tells him all in detail how he has planned his journey.
 "Sire," says he, "it must be so.  I shall take no extra horse,
 nor have I any use for gold or silver, squire or sergeant; nor do
 I ask for any company save that of my wife alone.  But I pray
 you, whatever may happen, should I die and she come back, to love
 her and hold her dear for love of me and for my prayer, and give
 her so long as she live, without contention or any strife, the
 half of your land to be her own."  Upon hearing his son's
 request, the King said: "Fair son, I promise it.  But I grieve
 much to see thee thus go off without escort, and if I had my way,
 thou shouldst not thus depart."  "Sire, it cannot be otherwise. 
 I go now, and to God commend you.  But keep in mind my
 companions, and give them horses and arms and all that knight may
 need."  The King cannot keep back the tears when he is parted
 from his son.  The people round about weep too; the ladies and
 knights shed tears and make great moan for him.  There is not one
 who does not mourn, and many a one in the courtyard swoons.
 Weeping, they kiss and embrace him, and are almost beside
 themselves with grief.  I think they would not have been more sad
 if they had seen him dead or wounded.  Then Erec said to comfort
 them: "My lords, why do you weep so sore?  I am neither in prison
 nor wounded.  You gain nothing by this display of grief.  If I go
 away, I shall come again when it please God and when I can.  To
 God I commend you one and all; so now let me go; too long you
 keep me here.  I am sorry and grieved to see you weep."  To God
 he commends them and they him.
 <p>
 (Vv. 2765-2924.)  So they departed, leaving sorrow behind them.
 Erec starts, and leads his wife he knows not whither, as chance
 dictates.  "Ride fast," he says, "and take good care not to be so
 rash as to speak to me of anything you may see.  Take care never
 to speak to me, unless I address you first.  Ride on now fast and
 with confidence."  "Sire," says she, "it shall be done."  She
 rode ahead and held her peace.  Neither one nor the other spoke a
 word.  But Enide's heart is very sad, and within herself she thus
 laments, soft and low that he may not hear: "Alas," she says,
 "God had raised and exalted me to such great joy; but now He has
 suddenly cast me down.  Fortune who had beckoned me has quickly
 now withdrawn her hand.  I should not mind that so much, alas, if
 only I dared to address my lord.  But I am mortified and
 distressed because my lord has turned against me, I see it
 clearly, since he will not speak to me.  And I am not so bold as
 to dare to look at him."  While she thus laments, a knight who
 lived by robbery issued forth from the woods.  He had two
 companions with him, and all three were armed.  They covet the
 palfrey which Enide rides.  "My lords, do you know the news I
 bring?" says he to his two companions.  "If we do not now make a
 haul, we are good-for-nothing cowards and are playing in bad
 luck.  Here comes a lady wondrous fair, whether married or not I
 do not know, but she is very richly dressed.  The palfrey and
 saddle, with the breast-strap and reins, are worth a thousand
 livres of Chartres.  I will take the palfrey for mine, and the
 rest of the booty you may have.  I don't want any more for my
 share.  The knight shall not lead away the lady, so help me God.
 For I intend to give him such a thrust as he will dearly pay.  I
 it was who saw him first, and so it is my right to go the first
 and offer battle."  They give him leave and he rides off,
 crouching well beneath his shield, while the other two remain
 aloof.  In those days it was the custom and practice that in an
 attack two knights should not join against one; thus if they too
 had assailed him, it would seem that they had acted
 treacherously.  Enide saw the robbers, and was seized with great
 fear.  "God," says she, "what can I say?  Now my lord will be
 either killed or made a prisoner; for there are three of them and
 he is alone.  The contest is not fair between one knight and
 three.  That fellow will strike him now at a disadvantage; for my
 lord is off his guard.  God, shall I be then such a craven as not
 to dare to raise my voice?  Such a coward I will not be: I will
 not fail to speak to him."  On the spot she turns about and calls
 to him: "Fair sire, of what are you thinking?  There come riding
 after you three knights who press you hard.  I greatly fear they
 will do you harm."  "What?" says Erec, "what's that you say?  You
 have surely been very bold to disdain my command and prohibition.
 This time you shall be pardoned; but if it should happen another
 time, you would not be forgiven."  Then turning his shield and
 lance, he rushes at the knight.  The latter sees him coming and
 challenges him.  When Erec hears him, he defies him.  Both give
 spur and clash together, holding their lances at full extent. 
 But he missed Erec, while Erec used him hard; for he knew well
 the right attack.  He strikes him on the shield so fiercely that
 he cracks it from top to bottom.  Nor is his hauberk any
 protection: Erec pierces and crushes it in the middle of his
 breast, and thrusts a foot and a half of his lance into his body.
 When he drew back, he pulled out the shaft.  And the other fell
 to earth.  He must needs die, for the blade had drunk of his
 life's blood.  Then one of the other two rushes forward, leaving
 his companion behind, and spurs toward Erec, threatening him.
 Erec firmly grasps his shield, and attacks him with a stout
 heart.  The other holds his shield before his breast.  Then they
 strike upon the emblazoned shields.  The knight's lance flies
 into two bits, while Erec drives a quarter of lance's length
 through the other's breast.  He will give him no more trouble.
 Erec unhorses him and leaves him in a faint, while he spurs at an
 angle toward the third robber.  When the latter saw him coming on
 he began to make his escape.  He was afraid, and did not dare to
 face him; so he hastened to take refuge in the woods.  But his
 flight is of small avail, for Erec follows him close and cries
 aloud: "Vassal, vassal, turn about now, and prepare to defend
 yourself, so that I may not slay you in act of flight.  It is
 useless to try to escape."  But the fellow has no desire to turn
 about, and continues to flee with might and main.  Following and
 overtaking him, Erec hits him squarely on his painted shield, and
 throws him over on the other side.  To these three robbers he
 gives no further heed: one he has killed, another wounded, and of
 the third he got rid by throwing him to earth from his steed.  He
 took the horses of all three and tied them together by the
 bridles.  In colour they were not alike: the first was white as
 milk, the second black and not at all bad looking, while the
 third was dappled all over.  He came back to the road where Enide
 was awaiting him.  He bade her lead and drive the three horses in
 front of her, warning her harshly never again to be so bold as to
 speak a single word unless he give her leave.  She makes answer:
 "I will never do so, fair sire, if it be your will."  Then they
 ride on, and she holds her peace.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2925-3085.)  They had not yet gone a league when before them
 in a valley there came five other knights, with lances in rest,
 shields held close in to the neck, and their shining helmets
 laced up tight; they, too, were on plunder bent.  All at once
 they saw the lady approach in charge of the three horses, and
 Erec who followed after.  As soon as they saw them, they divided
 their equipment among themselves, just as if they had already
 taken possession of it.  Covetousness is a bad thing.  But it did
 not turn out as they expected; for vigorous defence was made.
 Much that a fool plans is not executed, and many a man misses
 what he thinks to obtain.  So it befell them in this attack.  One
 said that he would take the maid or lose his life in the attempt;
 and another said that the dappled steed shall be his, and that he
 will be satisfied with that.  The third said that he would take
 the black horse.  "And the white one for me," said the fourth.
 The fifth was not at all backward, and vowed that he would have
 the horse and arms of the knight himself.  He wished to win them
 by himself, and would fain attack him first, if they would give
 him leave: and they willingly gave consent.  Then he leaves them
 and rides ahead on a good and nimble steed.  Erec saw him, but
 made pretence that he did not yet notice him.  When Enide saw
 them, her heart jumped with fear and great dismay.  "Alas!" said
 she, "I know not what to say or do; for my lord severely
 threatens me, and says that he will punish me, if I speak a word
 to him.  But if my lord were dead now, there would be no comfort
 for me.  I should be killed and roughly treated.  God!  my lord
 does not see them!  Why, then, do I hesitate, crazed as I am?  I
 am indeed too chary of my words, when I have not already spoken
 to him.  I know well enough that those who are coming yonder are
 intent upon some wicked deed.  And God!  how shall I speak to
 him?  He will kill me.  Well, let him kill me!  Yet I will not
 fail to speak to him."  Then she softly calls him: "Sire!" 
 "What?" says he, "what do you want?"  "Your pardon, sire.  I want
 to tell you that five knights have emerged from yonder thicket,
 of whom I am in mortal fear.  Having noticed them, I am of the
 opinion that they intend to fight with you.  Four of them have
 stayed behind, and the other comes toward you as fast as his
 steed can carry him.  I am afraid every moment lest he will
 strike you.  'Tis true, the four have stayed behind; but still
 they are not far away, and will quickly aid him, if need arise."
 Erec replies: "You had an evil thought, when you transgressed my
 command -- a thing which I had forbidden you.  And yet I knew all
 the time that you did not hold me in esteem.  Your service has
 been ill employed; for it has not awakened my gratitude, but
 rather kindled the more my ire.  I have told you that once, and I
 say it again.  This once again I will pardon you; but another
 time restrain yourself, and do not again turn around to watch me:
 for in doing so you would be very foolish.  I do not relish your
 words."  Then he spurs across the field toward his adversary, and
 they come together.  Each seeks out and assails the other.  Erec
 strikes him with such force that his shield flies from his neck,
 and thus he breaks his collar-bone.  His stirrups break, and he
 falls without the strength to rise again, for he was badly
 bruised and wounded.  One of the others then appeared, and they
 attack each other fiercely.  Without difficulty Erec thrusts the
 sharp and well forged steel into his neck beneath the chin,
 severing thus the bones and nerves.  At the back of his neck the
 blade protrudes, and the hot red blood flows down on both sides
 from the wound.  He yields his spirit, and his heart is still.
 The third sallies forth from his hiding-place on the other side
 of a ford.  Straight through the water, on he comes.  Erec spurs
 forward and meets him before he came out of the water, striking
 him so hard that he beats down flat both rider and horse.  The
 steed lay upon the body long enough to drown him in the stream,
 and then struggled until with difficulty he got upon his feet.
 Thus he conquered three of them, when the other two thought it
 wise to quit the conflict and not to strive with him.  In flight
 they follow the stream, and Erec after them in hot pursuit, until
 he strikes one upon the spine so hard that he throws him forward
 upon the saddle-bow.  He put all his strength into the blow, and
 breaks his lance upon his body, so that the fellow fell head
 foremost.  Erec makes him pay dearly for the lance which he has
 broken on him, and drew his sword from the scabbard.  The fellow
 unwisely straightened up; for Erec gave him three such strokes
 that he slaked his sword's thirst in his blood.  He severs the
 shoulder from his body, so that it fell down on the ground. 
 Then, with sword drawn, he attacked the other, as he sought to
 escape without company or escort.  When he sees Erec pursuing
 him, he is so afraid that he knows not what to do: he does not
 dare to face him, and cannot turn aside; he has to leave his
 horse, for he has no more trust in him.  He throws away his
 shield and lance, and slips from his horse to earth.  When he saw
 him on his feet, Erec no longer cared to pursue him, but he
 stooped over for the lance, not wishing to leave that, because of
 his own which had been broken.  He carries off his lance and goes
 away, not leaving the horses behind: he catches all five of them
 and leads them off.  Enide had hard work to lead them all; for he
 hands over all five of them to her with the other three, and
 commands her to go along smartly, and to keep from addressing him
 in order that no evil or harm may come to her.  So not a word
 does she reply, but rather keeps silence; and thus they go,
 leading with them all the eight horses.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3086-3208.)  They rode till nightfall without coming to any
 town or shelter.  When night came on, they took refuge beneath a
 tree in an open field.  Erec bids his lady sleep, and he will
 watch.  She replies that she will not, for it is not right, and
 she does not wish to do so.  It is for him to sleep who is more
 weary.  Well pleased at this, Erec accedes.  Beneath his head he
 placed his shield, and the lady took her cloak, and stretched it
 over him from head to foot.  Thus, he slept and she kept watch,
 never dozing the whole night, but holding tight in her hand by
 the bridle the horses until the morning broke; and much she
 blamed and reproached herself for the words which she had
 uttered, and said that she acted badly, and was not half so ill-
 treated as she deserved to be. "Alas," said she, "in what an evil
 hour have I witnessed my pride and presumption!  I might have
 known without doubt that there was no knight better than, or so
 good as, my lord.  I knew it well enough before, but now I know
 it better.  For I have seen with my own eyes how he has not
 quailed before three or even five armed men.  A plague for ever
 upon my tongue for having uttered such pride and insult as now
 compel me to suffer shame!"  All night long she thus lamented
 until the morning dawned.  Erec rises early, and again they take
 the road, she in front and he behind.  At noon a squire met them
 in a little valley, accompanied by two fellows who were carrying
 cakes and wine and some rich autumn cheeses to those who were
 mowing the hay in the meadows belonging to Count Galoain.  The
 squire was a clever fellow, and when he saw Erec and Enide, who
 were coming from the direction of the woods, he perceived that
 they must have spent the night in the forest and had had nothing
 to eat or drink; for within a radius of a day's journey there was
 no town, city or tower, no strong place or abbey, hospice or
 place of refuge.  So he formed an honest purpose and turned his
 steps toward them, saluting them politely and saving: "Sire, I
 presume that you have had a hard experience last night.  I am
 sure you have had no sleep and have spent the night in these
 woods.  I offer you some of this white cake, if it please you to
 partake of it.  I say it not in hope of reward: for I ask and
 demand nothing of you.  The cakes are made of good wheat; I have
 good wine and rich cheeses, too, a white cloth and fine jugs.  If
 you feel like taking lunch, you need not seek any farther.
 Beneath these white beeches, here on the greensward, you might
 lay off your arms and rest yourself a while.  My advice is that
 you dismount."  Erec got down from his horse and said: "Fair
 gentle friend, I thank you kindly: I will eat something, without
 going farther."  The young man knew well what to do: he helped
 the lady from her horse, and the boys who had come with the
 squire held the steeds.  Then they go and sit down in the shade.
 The squire relieves Erec of his helmet, unlaces the mouth-piece
 from before his face; then he spreads out the cloth before them
 on the thick tuff.  He passes them the cake and wine, and
 prepares and cuts a cheese.  Hungry as they were, they helped
 themselves, and gladly drank of the wine.  The squire serves them
 and omits no attention.  When they had eaten and drunk their
 fill, Erec was courteous and generous.  "Friend," says he, "as a
 reward, I wish to present you with one of my horses.  Take the
 one you like the best.  And I pray it may be no hardship for you
 to return to the town and make ready there a goodly lodging." 
 And he replies that he will gladly do whatever is his will.  Then
 he goes up to the horses and, untying them, chooses the dapple,
 and speaks his thanks; for this one seems to be the best.  Up he
 springs by the left stirrup, and leaving them both there, he rode
 off to the town at top speed, where he engaged suitable quarters.
 Now behold!  he is back again: "Now mount, sire, quickly," says
 he, "for you have a good fine lodging ready."  Erec mounted, and
 then his lady, and, as the town was hard by, they soon had
 reached their lodging-place.  There they were received with joy.
 The host with kindness welcomed them, and with joy and gladness
 made generous provision for their needs.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3209-3458.)  When the squire had done for them all the
 honour that he could do, he came and mounted his horse again,
 leading it off in front of the Count's bower to the stable.  The
 Count and three of his vassals were leaning out of the bower,
 when the Count, seeing his squire mounted on the dappled steed,
 asked him whose it was.  And he replied that it was his.  The
 Count, greatly astonished, says: "How is that?  Where didst thou
 get him?"  "A knight whom I esteem highly gave him to me, sire,"
 says he. "I have conducted him within this town, and he is lodged
 at a burgher's house.  He is a very courteous knight and the
 handsomest man I ever saw.  Even if I had given you my word and
 oath, I could not half tell you how handsome he is."  The Count
 replies: "I suppose and presume that he is not more handsome than
 I am."  "Upon my word, sire," the sergeant says, "you are very
 handsome and a gentleman.  There is not a knight in this country,
 a native of this land, whom you do not excel in favour.  But I
 dare maintain concerning this one that he is fairer than you, if
 he were not beaten black and blue beneath his hauberk, and
 bruised.  In the forest he has been fighting single-handed with
 eight knights, and leads away their eight horses.  And there
 comes with him a lady so fair that never lady was half so fair as
 she." (28)  When the Count hears this news, the desire takes him
 to go and see if this is true or false.  "I never heard such a
 thing," says he; "take me now to his lodging-place, for certainly
 I wish to know if thou dost lie or speak the truth."  He replies:
 "Right gladly, sire.  This is the way and the path to follow, for
 it is not far from here."  "I am anxious to see them," says the
 Count.  Then he comes down, and the squire gets off his horse,
 and makes the Count mount in his place.  Then he ran ahead to
 tell Erec that the Count was coming to visit him.  Erec's lodging
 was rich indeed -- the kind to which he was accustomed.  There
 were many tapers and candles lighted all about.  The Count came
 attended by only three companions.  Erec, who was of gracious
 manners, rose to meet him, and exclaimed: "Welcome, sire!"  And
 the Count returned his salutation.  They both sat down side by
 side upon a soft white couch, where they chat with each other. 
 The Count makes him an offer and urges him to consent to accept
 from him a guarantee for the payment of his expenses in the town. 
 But Erec does not deign to accept, saying he is well supplied
 with money, and has no need to accept aught from him.  They speak
 long of many things, but the Count constantly glances about in
 the other direction, where he caught sight of the lady.  Because
 of her manifest beauty, he fixed all his thought on her.  He
 looked at her as much as he could; he coveted her, and she
 pleased him so that her beauty filled him with love.  Very
 craftily he asked Erec for permission to speak with her.  "Sire,"
 he says "I ask a favour of you, and may it not displease you.  As
 an act of courtesy and as a pleasure, I would fain sit by yonder
 lady's side.  With good intent I came to see you both, and you
 should see no harm in that.  I wish to present to the lady my
 service in all respects.  Know well that for love of you I would
 do whatever may please her."  Erec was not in the least jealous
 and suspected no evil or treachery.  "Sire," says he, "I have no
 objection.  You may sit down and talk with her.  Don't think that
 I have any objection.  I give you permission willingly."  The
 lady was seated about two spear-lengths away from him.  And the
 Count took his seat close beside her on a low stool.  Prudent and
 courteous, the lady turned toward him.  "Alas," quoth he, "how
 grieved I am to see you in such humble state!  I am sorry and
 feel great distress.  But if you would believe my word, you could
 have honour and great advantage, and much wealth would accrue to
 you.  Such beauty as yours is entitled to great honour and
 distinction.  I would make you my mistress, if it should please
 you and be your will; you would be my mistress dear and lady over
 all my land.  When I deign to woo you thus, you ought not to
 disdain my suit.  I know and perceive that your lord does not
 love and esteem you.  If you will remain with me, you would be
 mated with a worthy lord."  "Sire," says Enide, "your proposal is
 vain.  It cannot be.  Ah!  better that I were yet unborn, or
 burnt upon a fire of thorns and my ashes scattered abroad than
 that I should ever in any wise be false to my lord, or conceive
 any felony or treachery toward him.  You have made a great
 mistake in making such a proposal to me.  I shall not agree to it
 in any wise."  The Count's ire began to rise.  "You disdain to
 love me, lady?" says he; "upon my word, you are too proud. 
 Neither for flattery nor for prayer you will do my will?  It is
 surely true that a woman's pride mounts the more one prays and
 flatters her; but whoever insults and dishonours her will often
 find her more tractable.  I give you my word that if you do not
 do my will there soon will be some sword-play here.  Rightly or
 wrongly, I will have your lord slain right here before your
 eyes."  "Ah, sire," says Enide, "there is a better way than that
 you say.  You would commit a wicked and treacherous deed if you
 killed him thus.  Calm yourself again, I pray; for I will do your
 pleasure.  You may regard me as all your own, for I am yours and
 wish to be.  I did not speak as I did from pride, but to learn
 and prove if I could find in you the true love of a sincere
 heart.  But I would not at any price have you commit an act of
 treason.  My lord is not on his guard; and if you should kill him
 thus, you would do a very ugly deed, and I should have the blame
 for it.  Every one in the land would say that it had been done
 with my consent.  Go and rest until the morrow, when my lord
 shall be about to rise.  Then you can better do him harm without
 blame and without reproach."  With her heart's thoughts her words
 do not agree.  "Sire," says she, "believe me now!  Have no
 anxiety; but send here to-morrow your knights and squires and
 have me carried away by force.  My lord will rush to my defence,
 for he is proud and bold enough.  Either in earnest or in jest,
 have him seized and treated ill, or strike his head off, if you
 will.  I have led this life now long enough; to tell the truth. 
 I like not the company of this my lord.  Rather would I feel your
 body lying beside me in a bed.  And since we have reached this
 point, of my love you may rest assured."  The Count replies: "It
 is well, my lady!  God bless the hour that you were born; in
 great estate you shall be held."  "Sire," says she, "indeed, I
 believe it.  And yet I would fain have your word that you will
 always hold me dear; I could not believe you otherwise."  Glad
 and merry, the Count replies: "See here, my faith I will pledge
 to you loyally as a Count, Madame, that I shall do all your
 behests.  Have no further fear of that.  All you want you shall
 always have."  Then she took his plighted word; but little she
 valued or cared for it, except therewith to save her lord.  Well
 she knows how to deceive a fool, when she puts her mind upon it. 
 Better it were to lie to him than that her lord should be cut
 off.  The Count now rose from her side, and commends her to God a
 hundred times.  But of little use to him will be the faith which
 she has pledged to him.  Erec knew nothing at all of this that
 they were plotting to work his death; but God will be able to
 lend him aid, and I think He will do so.  Now Erec is in great
 peril, and does not know that he must be on his guard.  The
 Count's intentions are very base in planning to steal away his
 wife and kill him when he is without defence.  In treacherous
 guise he takes his leave: "To God I commend you," says he, and
 Erec replies: "And so do I you, sire."  Thus they separated. 
 Already a good part of the night was passed.  Out of the way, in
 one of the rooms, two beds were made upon the floor.  In one of
 them Erec lays him down, in the other Enide went to rest.  Full
 of grief and anxiety, she never closed her eyes that night, but
 remained on watch for her lord's sake; for from what she had seen
 of the Count, she knew him to be full of wickedness.  She knows
 full well that if he once gets possession of her lord, he will
 not fail to do him harm.  He may be sure of being killed: so for
 his sake she is in distress.  All night she must needs keep her
 vigil; but before the dawn, if she can bring it about, and if her
 lord will take her word, they will be ready to depart.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3459-3662.)  Erec slept all night long securely until
 daylight.  Then Enide realised and suspected that she might
 hesitate too long.  Her heart was tender toward her lord, like a
 good and loyal lady.  Her heart was neither deceitful nor false.
 So she rises and makes ready, and drew near to her lord to wake
 him up.  "Ah, sire," says she, "I crave your pardon.  Rise
 quickly now, for you are betrayed beyond all doubt, though
 guiltless and free from any crime.  The Count is a proven
 traitor, and if he can but catch you here, you will never get
 away without his having cut you in pieces.  He hates you because
 he desires me. But if it please God, who knows all things, you
 shall be neither slain nor caught.  Last evening he would have
 killed you had I not assured him that I would be his mistress and
 his wife.  You will see him return here soon: he wants to seize
 me and keep me here and kill you if he can find you."  Now Erec
 learns how loyal his wife is to him.  "Lady," says he, "have our
 horses quickly saddled; then run and call our host, and tell him
 quickly to come here.  Treason has been long abroad."  Now the
 horses are saddled, and the lady summoned the host.  Erec has
 armed and dressed himself, and into his presence came the host.
 "Sire," said he, "what haste is this, that you are risen at such
 an hour, before the day and the sun appear?"  Erec replies that
 he has a long road and a full day before him, and therefore he
 has made ready to set out, having it much upon his mind; and he
 added: "Sire, you have nor yet handed me any statement of my
 expenses.  You have received me with honour and kindness, and
 therein great merit redounds to you.  Cancel my indebtedness with
 these seven horses that I brought here with me.  Do not disdain
 them, but keep them for your own.  I cannot increase my gift to
 you by so much as the value of a halter."  The burgher was
 delighted with this gift and bowed low, expressing his thanks and
 gratitude.  Then Erec mounts and takes his leave, and they set
 out upon their way.  As they ride, he frequently warns Enide that
 if she sees anything she should not be so bold as to speak to him
 about it.  Meanwhile, there entered the house a hundred knights
 well armed, and very much dismayed they were to find Erec no
 longer there.  Then the Count learned that the lady had deceived
 him.  He discovered the footsteps of the horses, and they all
 followed the trail, the Count threatening Erec and vowing that,
 if he can come up with him, nothing can keep him from having his
 head on the spot.  "A curse on him who now hangs back, and does
 not spur on fast!" quoth he; "he who presents me with the head of
 the knight whom I hate so bitterly, will have served me to my
 taste."  Then they plunge on at topmost speed, filled with
 hostility toward him who had never laid eyes on them and had
 never harmed them by deed or word.  They ride ahead until they
 made him out; at the edge of a forest they catch sight of him
 before he was hid by the forest trees.  Not one of them halted
 then, but all rushed on in rivalry.  Enide hears the clang and
 noise of their arms and horses, and sees that the valley is full
 of them.  As soon as she saw them, she could not restrain her
 tongue.  "Ah, sire," she cries. "alas, how this Count has
 attacked you, when he leads against you such a host!  Sire, ride
 faster now, until we be within this wood.  I think we can easily
 distance them, for they are still a long way behind.  If you go
 on at this pace, you can never escape from death, for you are no
 match for them."  Erec replies: "Little esteem you have for me,
 and lightly you hold my words.  It seems I cannot correct you by
 fair request.  But as the Lord have mercy upon me until I escape
 from here, I swear that you shall pay dearly for this speech of
 yours; that is, unless my mind should change."  Then he
 straightway turns about, and sees the seneschal drawing near upon
 a horse both strong and fleet.  Before them all he takes his
 stand at the distance of four cross-bow shots.  He had not
 disposed of his arms, but was thoroughly well equipped.  Erec
 reckons up his opponents' strength, and sees there are fully a
 hundred of them.  Then he who thus is pressing him thinks he had
 better call a hair.  Then they ride to meet each other, and
 strike upon each other's shield great blows with their sharp and
 trenchant swords.  Erec caused his stout steel sword to pierce
 his body through and through, so that his shield and hauberk
 protected him no more than a shred of dark-blue silk.  And next
 the Count comes spurring on, who, as the story tells, was a
 strong and doughty knight.  But the Count in this was ill advised
 when he came with only shield and lance.  He placed such trust in
 his own prowess that he thought that he needed no other arms.  He
 showed his exceeding boldness by rushing on ahead of all his men
 more than the space of nine acres.  When Erec saw him stand
 alone, he turned toward him; the Count is not afraid of him, and
 they come together with clash of arms.  First the Count strikes
 him with such violence upon the breast that he would have lost
 his stirrups if he had not been well set.  He makes the wood of
 his shield to split so that the iron of his lance protrudes on
 the other side.  But Erec's hauberk was very solid and protected
 him from death without the tear of a single mesh.  The Count was
 strong and breaks his lance; then Erec strikes him with such
 force on his yellow painted shield that he ran more than a yard
 of his lance through his abdomen, knocking him senseless from his
 steed.  Then he turned and rode away without further tarrying on
 the spot.  Straight into the forest he spurs at full speed.  Now
 Erec is in the woods, and the others paused a while over those
 who lay in the middle of the field.  Loudly they swear and vow
 that they will rather follow after him for two or three days than
 fail to capture and slaughter him.  The Count, though grievously
 wounded in the abdomen, hears what they say.  He draws himself up
 a little and opens his eyes a tiny bit.  Now he realises what an
 evil deed he had begun to execute.  He makes the knights step
 back, and says: "My lords, I bid you all, both strong and weak,
 high and low, that none of you be so bold as to dare to advance a
 single step.  All of you return now quickly!  I have done a
 villainous deed, and I repent me of my foul design.  The lady who
 outwitted me is very honourable, prudent, and courteous.  Her
 beauty fired me with love for her; because I desired her, I
 wished to kill her lord and keep her back with me by force.  I
 well deserved this woe, and now it has come upon me.  How
 abominably disloyal and treacherous I was in my madness!  Never
 was there a better knight born of mother than he.  Never shall he
 receive harm through me if I can in any way prevent it.  I
 command you all to retrace your steps."  Back they go
 disconsolate, carrying the lifeless seneschal on the shield
 reversed.  The Count, whose wound was not mortal, lived on for
 some time after.  Thus was Erec delivered.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3663-3930.)  Erec goes off at full speed down a road between
 two hedgerows -- he and his wife with him.  Both putting spurs to
 their horses, they rode until they came to a meadow which had
 been mown.  After emerging from the hedged enclosure they came
 upon a drawbridge before a high tower, which was all closed about
 with a wall and a broad and deep moat.  They quickly pass over
 the bridge, but had not gone far before the lord of the place
 espied them from up in his tower.  About this man I can tell you
 the truth: that he was very small oú stature, but very courageous
 of heart.  When he sees Erec cross the bridge, he comes down
 quickly from his tower, and on a great sorrel steed of his he
 causes a saddle to be placed, which showed portrayed a golden
 lion.  Then he orders to be brought his shield, his stiff,
 straight lance, a sharp polished sword, his bright shining
 helmet, his gleaming hauberk, and triple-woven greaves; for he
 has seen an armed knight pass before his list against whom he
 wishes to strive in arms, or else this stranger will strive
 against him until he shall confess defeat.  His command was
 quickly done: behold the horse now led forth; a squire brought
 him around already bridled and with saddle on.  Another fellow
 brings the arms.  The knight passed out through the gate, as
 quickly as possible, all alone, without companion.  Erec is
 riding along a hill-side, when behold the knight comes tearing
 down over the top of the hill, mounted upon a powerful steed
 which tore along at such a pace that he crushed the stones
 beneath his hoofs finer than a millstone grinds the corn; and
 bright gleaming sparks flew off in all directions, so that it
 seemed as if his four feet were all ablaze with fire.  Enide
 heard the noise and commotion, and almost fell from her palfrey,
 helpless and in a faint.  There was no vein in her body in which
 the blood did not turn, and her face became all pale and white as
 if she were a corpse.  Great is her despair and dismay, for she
 does not dare to address her lord, who often threatens and chides
 at her and charges her to hold her peace.  She is distracted
 between two courses to pursue, whether to speak or to hold her
 peace.  She takes counsel with herself, and often she prepares to
 speak, so that her tongue already moves, but the voice cannot
 issue forth; for her teeth are clenched with fear, and thus shut
 up her speech within.  Thus she admonishes and reproaches
 herself, but she closes her mouth and grits her teeth so that her
 speech cannot issue forth.  At strife with herself, she said: "I
 am sure and certain that I shall incur a grievous loss, if here I
 lose my lord.  Shall I tell him all, then, openly?  Not I.  Why
 not?  I would not dare, for thus I should enrage my lord.  And if
 my lord's ire is once aroused, he will leave me in this wild
 place alone, wretched and forlorn.  Then I shall be worse off
 than now. Worse off?  What care I?  May grief and sorrow always
 be mine as long as I live, if my lord does not promptly escape
 from here without being delivered to a violent death.  But if I
 do not quickly inform him, this knight who is spurring hither
 will have killed him before he is aware; for he seems of very
 evil intent.  I think I have waited too long from fear of his
 vigorous prohibition.  But I will no longer hesitate because of
 his restraint.  I see plainly that my lord is so deep in thought
 that he forgets himself; so it is fight that I should address
 him."  She spoke to him.  He threatens her, but has no desire to
 do her harm, for he realises and knows full well that she loves
 him above all else, and he loves her, too, to the utmost.  He
 rides toward the knight, who challenges him to battle, and they
 meet at the foot of the hill, where they attack and defy each
 other.  Both smite each other with their iron-tipped lances with
 all their strength.  The shields that hang about their necks are
 not worth two coats of bark: the leather tears, and they split
 the wood, and they shatter the meshes of the hauberks.  Both are
 pierced to the vitals by the lances, and the horses fall to
 earth.  Now, both the warriors were doughty.  Grievously, but not
 mortally, wounded, they quickly got upon their feet and grasped
 afresh their lances, which were not broken nor the worse for
 wear.  But they cast them away on the ground, and drawing their
 swords from the scabbard, they attack each other with great fury.
 Each wounds and injures the other, for there is no mercy on
 either side.  They deal such blows upon the helmets that gleaming
 sparks fly out when their swords recoil.  They split and splinter
 the shields; they batter and crush the hauberks.  In four places
 the swords are brought down to the bare flesh, so that they are
 greatly weakened and exhausted.  And if both their swords had
 lasted long without breaking, they would never have retreated,
 nor would the battle have come to an end before one of them
 perforce had died.  Enide, who was watching them, was almost
 beside herself with grief.  Whoever could have seen her then, as
 she showed her great woe by wringing her hands, tearing her hair
 and shedding tears, could have seen a loyal lady.  And any man
 would have been a vulgar wretch who saw and did not pity her. 
 And the knights still fight, knocking the jewels from the helmets
 and dealing at each other fearful blows.  From the third to the
 ninth hour the battle continued so fierce that no one could in
 any wise make out which was to have the better of it.  Erec
 exerts himself and strives; he brought his sword down upon his
 enemy's helmet, cleaving it to the inner lining of mail and
 making him stagger; but he stood firmly and did not fall.  Then
 he attacked Erec in turn, and dealt him such a blow upon the
 covering of his shield that his strong and precious sword broke
 when he tried to pull it out.  When he saw that his sword was
 broken, in a spite he threw as far away as he could the part that
 remained in his hand.  Now he was afraid and must needs draw
 back; for any knight that lacks his sword cannot do much
 execution in battle or assault.  Erec pursues him until he begs
 him, for God's sake, not to kill him.  "Mercy, noble knight," he
 cries, "be not so cruel and harsh toward me.  Now that I am left
 without my sword, you have the strength and the power to take my
 life or make me your prisoner, for I have no means of defence."
 Erec replies: "When thou thus dost petition me I fain would hear
 thee admit outright whether thou art defeated and overcome.  Thou
 shalt not again be touched by me if thou dost surrender at my
 discretion."  The knight was slow to make reply.  So, when Erec
 saw him hesitate, in order to further dismay him, he again
 attacked him, rushing at him with drawn sword; whereupon,
 thoroughly terrified, he cried: "Mercy, sire!  Regard me as your
 captive, since it cannot be otherwise."  Erec answers: "More than
 that is necessary.  You shall not get off so easily as that. 
 Tell me your station and your name, and I in turn will {t tell
 you mine."  "Sire," says he, "you are right.  I am king of this
 country.  My liegemen are Irishmen, and there is none who does
 not have to pay me rent. (29)  My name is Guivret the Little.  I
 am very rich and powerful; for there is no landholder whose lands
 touch mine in any direction who ever transgresses my command and
 who does not do my pleasure.  I have no neighbour who does not
 fear me, however proud and bold he may be.  But I greatly desire
 to be your confidant and friend from this time on."  Erec
 replies: "I, too, can boast that I am a noble man.  My name is
 Erec, son of King Lac.  My father is king of Farther Wales, and
 has many a rich city, fine hall, and strong town; no king or
 emperor has more than he, save only King Arthur.  Him, of course,
 I except; for with him none can compare."  Guivret is greatly
 astonished at this, and says: "Sire, a great marvel is this I
 hear.  I was never so glad of anything as of your acquaintance. 
 You may put full trust in me!  And should it please you to abide
 in my country within my estates, I shall have you treated with
 great honour.  So long as you care to remain here, you shall be
 recognised as my lord.  We both have need of a physician, and I
 have a castle of mine near here, not eight leagues away, nor even
 seven.  I wish to take you thither with me, and there we shall
 have our wounds tended."  Erec replies: "I thank you for what I
 have heard you say.  However, I will not go, thank you.  But only
 so much I request of you, that if I should be in need, and you
 should hear that I had need of aid, you would not then forget
 me."  "Sire" says he, "I promise you that never, so long as I am
 alive, shall you have need of my help but that I shall go at once
 to aid you with all the assistance I can command."  "I have
 nothing more to ask of you," says Erec; "you have promised me
 much.  You are now my lord and friend, if your deed is as good as
 your word."  Then each kisses and embraces the other.  Never was
 there such an affectionate parting after such a fierce battle;
 for from very affection and generosity each one cut off long,
 wide strips from the bottom of his shirt and bound up the other's
 wounds.  When they had thus bandaged each other, they commended
 each other to God.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3931-4280.)  So thus they parted.  Guivret takes his way
 back alone, while Erec resumed his road, in dire need of plaster
 wherewith to heal his wounds.  He did not cease to travel until
 he came to a plain beside a lofty forest all full of stags,
 hinds, deer, does, and other beasts, and all sorts of game.  Now
 King Arthur and the Queen and the best of his barons had come
 there that very day.  The King wished to spend three or four days
 in the forest for pleasure and sport, and had commanded tents,
 pavilions, and canopies to be brought.  My lord Gawain had
 stepped into the King's tent, all tired out by a long ride.  In
 front of the tent a white beech stood, and there he had left a
 shield of his, together with his ashen lance.  He left his steed,
 all saddled and bridled, fastened to a branch by the rein.  There
 the horse stood until Kay the seneschal came by. (30)  He came up
 quickly and, as if to beguile the time, took the steed and
 mounted, without the interference of any one.  He took the lance
 and the shield, too, which were close by under the tree. 
 Galloping along on the steed, Kay rode along a valley until it
 came about by chance that Erec met him.  Now Erec recognised the
 seneschal, and he knew the arms and the horse, but Kay did not
 recognise him, for he could not be distinguished by his arms.  So
 many blows of sword and lance had he received upon his shield
 that all the painted design had disappeared from it.  And the
 lady, who did not wish to be seen or recognised by him, shrewdly
 held her veil before her face, as if she were doing it because of
 the sun's glare and the dust.  Kay approached rapidly and
 straightway seized Erec's rein, without so much as saluting him. 
 Before he let him move, he presumptuously asked him: "Knight,"
 says he, "I wish to know who you are and whence you come."  "You
 must be mad to stop me thus," says Erec; "you shall not know that
 just now."  And the other replies: "Be not angry; I only ask it
 for your good.  I can see and make out clearly that you are
 wounded and hurt.  If you will come along with me you shall have
 a good lodging this night; I shall see that you are well cared
 for, honoured and made comfortable: for you are in need of rest. 
 King Arthur and the Queen are close by here in a wood, lodged in
 pavilions and tents.  In all good faith, I advise you to come
 with me to see the Queen and King, who will take much pleasure in
 you and will show you great honour."  Erec replies: "You say
 well; yet will I not go thither for anything.  You know not what
 my business is: I must yet farther pursue my way.  Now let me go;
 too long I stay.  There is still some daylight left."  Kay makes
 answer: "You speak madness when you decline to come.  I trow you
 will repent of it.  And however much it may be against your will,
 you shall both go, as the priest goes to the council, willy-
 nilly.  To-night you will be badly served, if, unmindful of my
 advice, you go there as strangers.  Come now quickly, for I will
 take you."  At this word Erec's ire was roused.  "Vassal," says
 he, "you are mad to drag me thus after you by force.  You have
 taken me quite off my guard.  I tell you you have committed an
 offence.  For I thought to be quite safe, and was not on my guard
 against you."  Then he lays his hand upon his sword and cries:
 "Hands off my bridle, vassal!  Step aside.  I consider you proud
 and impudent.  I shall strike you, be sure of that, if you drag
 me longer after you.  Leave me alone now."  Then he lets him go,
 and draws off across the field more than an acre's width; then
 turns about and, as a man with evil intent, issues his challenge. 
 Each rushed at the other.  But, because Kay was without armour,
 Erec acted courteously and turned the point of his lance about
 and presented the butt-end instead.  Even so, he gave him such a
 blow high up on the broad expanse of his shield that he caused it
 to wound him on the temple, pinning his arm to his breast: all
 prone he throws him to the earth.  Then he went to catch the
 horse and hands him over by the bridle to Enide.  He was about to
 lead it away, when the wounded man with his wonted flattery begs
 him to restore it courteously to him.  With fair words he
 flatters and wheedles him.  "Vassal," says he, "so help me God,
 that horse is not mine.  Rather does it belong to that knight in
 whom dwells the greatest prowess in the world, my lord Gawain the
 Bold.  I tell you so much on his behalf, in order that you may
 send it back to him and thus win honour.  So shall you be
 courteous and wise, and I shall be your messenger."  Erec makes
 answer: "Take the horse, vassal, and lead it away.  Since it
 belongs to my lord Gawain it is not meet that I should
 appropriate it."  Kay takes the horse, remounts, and coming to
 the royal tent, tells the King the whole truth, keeping nothing
 back.  And the King summoned Gawain, saying: "Fair nephew Gawain,
 if ever you were true and courteous, go quickly after him and ask
 him in winsome wise who he is and what his business.  And if you
 can influence him and bring him along with you to us, take care
 not to fail to do so."  Then Gawain mounts his steed, two squires
 following after him.  They soon made Erec out, but did not
 recognise him.  Gawain salutes him, and he Gawain: their
 greetings were mutual.  Then said my lord Gawain with his wonted
 openness: "Sire," says he, "King Arthur sends me along this way
 to encounter you.  The Queen and King send you their greeting,
 and beg you urgently to come and spend some time with them (it
 may benefit you and cannot harm), as they are close by."  Erec
 replies: "I am greatly obliged to the King and Queen and to you
 who are, it seems, both kind of heart and of gentle mien.  I am
 not in a vigorous state; rather do I bear wounds within my body:
 yet will I not turn aside from my way to seek a lodging-place. 
 So you need not longer wait: I thank you, but you may be gone. 
 Now Gawain was a man of sense.  He draws back and whispers in the
 ear of one of the squires, bidding him go quickly and tell the
 King to take measures at once to take down and lower his tents
 and come and set them up in the middle of the road three or four
 leagues in advance of where they now are.  There the King must
 lodge to-night, if he wishes to meet and extend hospitality to
 the best knight in truth whom he can ever hope to see; but who
 will not go out of his way for a lodging at the bidding of any
 one.  The fellow went and gave his message.  The King without
 delay causes his tents to be taken down.  Now they are lowered,
 the sumpters loaded, and off they set.  The King mounted Aubagu,
 and the Queen afterwards mounted a white Norse palfrey.  All this
 while, my lord Gawain did not cease to detain Erec, until the
 latter said to him: "Yesterday I covered more ground than I shall
 do to-day.  Sire, you annoy me; let me go.  You have already
 disturbed a good part of my day."  And my lord Gawain answers
 him: "I should like to accompany you a little way, if you do not
 object; for it is yet a long while until night.  They spent so
 much time in talking that all the tents were set up before them,
 and Erec sees them, and perceives that his lodging is arranged
 for him.  "Ah!  Gawain," he says, "your shrewdness has outwitted
 me.  By your great cunning you have kept me here.  Since it has
 turned out thus, I shall tell you my name at once.  Further
 concealment would be useless.  I am Erec, who was formerly your
 companion and friend."  Gawain hears him and straightway embraces
 him.  He raised up his helmet and unlaced his mouthpiece. 
 Joyfully he clasps him in his embrace, while Erec embraces him in
 turn.  Then Gawain leaves him, saying, "Sire, this news will give
 great pleasure to my lord; he and my lady will both be glad, and
 I must go before to tell them of it.  But first I must embrace
 and welcome and speak comfortably to my lady Enide, your wife. 
 My lady the Queen has a great desire to see her.  I heard her
 speak of her only yesterday."  Then he steps up to Enide and asks
 her how she is, if she is well and in good case.  She makes
 answer courteously: "Sire, I should have no cause for grief, were
 I not in great distress for my lord; but as it is, I am in
 dismay, for he has hardly a limb without a wound."  Gawain
 replies: "This grieves me much.  It is perfectly evident from his
 face, which is all pale and colourless.  I could have wept myself
 when I saw him so pale and wan, but my joy effaced my grief, for
 at sight of him I felt so glad that I forgot all other pain.  Now
 start and ride along slowly.  I shall ride ahead at top-speed to
 tell the Queen and the King that you are following after me.  I
 am sure that they will both be delighted when they hear it." 
 Then he goes, and comes to the King's tent.  "Sire," he cries,
 "now you and my lady must be glad, for here come Erec and his
 wife."  The King leaps to his feet with joy.  "Upon my word!" he
 says, "right glad I am.  I could hear no news which could give me
 so much happiness."  The Queen and all the rest rejoice, and come
 out from the tents as fast as they may.  Even the King comes
 forth from his pavilion, and they met Erec near at band.  When
 Erec sees the King coming, he quickly dismounts, and Enide too. 
 The King embraces and meets them, and the Queen likewise tenderly
 kisses and embraces them: there is no one that does not show his
 joy.  Right there, upon the spot, they took off Erec's armour;
 and when they saw his wounds, their joy turned to sadness.  The
 King draws a deep sigh at the sight of them, and has a plaster
 brought which Morgan, his sister, had made.  This piaster, which
 Morgan had given to Arthur, was of such sovereign virtue that no
 wound, whether on nerve or joint, provided it were treated with
 the piaster once a day, could fail to be completely cured and
 healed within a week.  They brought to the King the piaster which
 gave Erec great relief.  When they had bathed, dried, and bound
 up his wounds, the King leads him and Enide into his own royal
 tent, saying that he intends, out of love for Erec, to tarry in
 the forest a full fortnight, until he be completely restored to
 health.  For this Erec thanks the King, saying: "Fair sire, my
 wounds are not so painful that I should desire to abandon my
 journey.  No one could detain me; to-morrow, without delay, I
 shall wish to get off in the morning, as soon as I see the dawn." 
 At this the King shook his head and said: "This is a great
 mistake for you not to remain with us.  I know that you are far
 from well.  Stay here, and you will do the right thing.  It will
 be a great pity and cause for grief if you die in this forest. 
 Fair gentle friend, stay here now until you are quite yourself
 again."  Erec replies: "Enough of this.  I have undertaken this
 journey, and shall not tarry in any wise."  The King hears that
 he would by no means stay for prayer of his; so he says no more
 about it, and commands the supper to be prepared at once and the
 tables to be spread.  The servants go to make their preparations. 
 It was a Saturday night; so they ate fish and fruit, pike and
 perch, salmon and trout, and then pears both raw and cooked. (31) 
 Soon after supper they ordered the beds to be made ready.  The
 King, who held Erec dear, had him laid in a bed alone; for he did
 not wish that any one should lie with him who might touch his
 wounds.  That night he was well lodged.  In another bed close by
 lay Enide with the Queen under a cover of ermine, and they all
 slept in great repose until the day broke next morning.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4281-4307.)  Next day, as soon as it is dawn.  Erec arises,
 dresses, commands his horses to be saddled, and orders his arms
 to be brought to him.  The valets run and bring them to him. 
 Again the King and all the knights urge him to remain; but
 entreaty is of no avail, for he will not stay for anything.  Then
 you might have seen them all weep and show such grief as if they
 already saw him dead.  He puts on his arms, and Enide arises. 
 All the knights are sore distressed, for they think they will
 never see them more.  They follow them out from the tents, and
 send for their own horses, that they may escort and accompany
 them.  Erec said to them: "Be not angry!  but you shall not
 accompany me a single step.  I'll thank you if you'll stay
 behind!"  His horse was brought to him, and he mounts without
 delay.  Taking his shield and lance, he commends them all to God,
 and they in turn wish Erec well.  Then Enide mounts, and they
 ride away.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4308-4380.)  Entering a forest, they rode on without halting
 till hour of prime.  While they thus traversed the wood, they
 heard in the distance the cry of a damsel in great distress. 
 When Erec heard the cry, he felt sure from the sound that it was
 the voice of one in trouble and in need of help.  Straightway
 calling Enide, he says: "Lady, there is some maiden who goes
 through the wood calling aloud.  I take it that she is in need of
 aid and succour.  I am going to hasten in that direction and see
 what her trouble is.  Do you dismount and await me here, while I
 go yonder."  "Gladly, sire," she says.  Leaving her alone, he
 makes his way until he found the damsel, who was going through
 the wood, lamenting her lover whom two giants had taken and were
 leading away with very cruel treatment.  The maiden was rending
 her garments, and tearing her hair and her tender crimson face. 
 Erec sees her and, wondering greatly, begs her to tell him why
 she cries and weeps so sore.  The maiden cries and sighs again,
 then sobbing, says: "Fair sire, it is no wonder if I grieve, for
 I wish I were dead.  I neither love nor prize my life, for my
 lover has been led away prisoner by two wicked and cruel giants
 who are his mortal enemies.  God!  what shall I do?  Woe is me! 
 deprived of the best knight alive, the most noble and the most
 courteous.  And now he is in great peril of death.  This very
 day, and without cause, they will bring him to some vile death. 
 Noble knight, for God's sake, I beg you to succour my lover, if
 now you can lend him any aid.  You will not have to run far, for
 they must still be close by."  "Damsel," says Erec, "I will
 follow them, since you request it, and rest assured that I shall
 do all within my power: either I shall be taken prisoner along
 with him, or I shall restore him to you safe and sound.  If the
 giants let him live until I can find him, I intend to measure my
 strength with theirs."  "Noble knight," the maiden said, "I shall
 always be your servant if you restore to me my lover.  Now go in
 God's name, and make haste, I beseech you."  "Which way lies
 their path?"  "This way, my lord.  Here is the path with the
 footprints.  Then Erec started at a gallop, and told her ro await
 him there.  The maid commends him to the Lord, and prays God very
 fervently that He should give him force by His command to
 discomfit those who intend evil toward her lover.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4381-4579.)  Erec went off along the trail, spurring his
 horse in pursuit of the giants.  He followed in pursuit of them
 until he caught sight of them before they emerged from the wood;
 he saw the knight with bare limbs mounted naked on a nag, his
 hands and feet bound as if he were arrested for highway robbery. 
 The giants had no lances, shields or whetted swords; but they
 both had clubs and scourges, with which they were beating him so
 cruelly that already they had cut the skin on his back to the
 bone.  Down his sides and flanks the blood ran, so that the nag
 was all covered with blood down to the belly. (32)  Erec came
 along alone after them.  He was very sad and distressed about the
 knight whom he saw them treat so spitefully.  Between two woods
 in an open field he came up with them, and asks: "My lords," says
 he, "for what crime do you treat this man so ill and lead him
 along like a common thief?  You are treating him too cruelly. 
 You are driving him just as if he had been caught stealing.  It
 is a monstrous insult to strip a knight naked, and then bind him
 and beat him so shamefully.  Hand him over to me, I beg of you
 with all good-will and courtesy.  I have no wish to demand him of
 you forcibly."  "Vassal," they say, "what business is this of
 yours?  You must be mad to make any demand of us.  If you do not
 like it, try and improve matters."  Erec replies: "Indeed, I like
 it not, and you shall not lead him away so easily.  Since you
 have left the matter in my hands, I say whoever can get
 possession of him let him keep him.  Take your positions.  I
 challenge you.  You shall not take him any farther before some
 blows have been dealt."  "Vassal," they reply, "you are mad,
 indeed, to wish to measure your strength with us.  If you were
 four instead of one, you would have no more strength against us
 than one lamb against two wolves."  "I do not know how it will
 turn out," Erec replies; "if the sky fails and the earth melts,
 then many a lark will be caught.  Many a man boasts loudly who is
 of little worth.  On guard now, for I am going to attack you." 
 The giants were strong and fierce, and held in their clenched
 hands their big clubs tipped with iron.  Erec went at them lance
 in rest.  He fears neither of them, in spite of their menace and
 their pride, and strikes the foremost of them through the eye so
 deep into the brain that the blood and brains spurt out at the
 back of his neck; that one lies dead and his heart stops beating. 
 When the other saw him dead, he had reason to be sorely grieved. 
 Furious, he went to avenge him: with both hands he raised his
 club on high and thought to strike him squarely upon his
 unprotected head: but Erec watched the blow, and received it on
 his shield.  Even so, the giant landed such a blow that it quite
 stunned him, and almost made him fall to earth from his steed. 
 Erec covers himself with his shield and the giant, recovering
 himself, thinks to strike again quickly upon his head.  But Erec
 had drawn his sword, and attacked him with such fierceness that
 the giant was severely handled: he strikes him so hard upon the
 neck that he splits him down to the saddle-bow.  He scatters his
 bowels upon the earth, and the body falls full length, split in
 two halves.  The knight weeps with joy and, worshipping, praises
 God who has sent him this aid.  Then Erec unbound him, made him
 dress and arm himself, and mount one of the horses; the other he
 made him lead with his right hand, and asks him who he is.  And
 he replied: "Noble knight, thou art my liege lord.  I wish to
 regard thee as my lord, as by right I ought to do, for thou hast
 saved my life, which but now would have been cut off from my body
 with great torment and cruelty.  What chance, fair gentle sire,
 in God's name, guided thee hither to me, to free me by thy
 courage from the hands of my enemies?  Sire, I wish to do thee
 homage.  Henceforth, I shall always accompany thee and serve thee
 as my lord."  Erec sees that he is disposed to serve him gladly,
 if he may, and says: "Friend, for your service I have no desire;
 but you must know that I came hither to succour you at the
 instance of your lady, whom I found sorrowing in this wood. 
 Because of you, she grieves and moans; for full of sorrow is her
 heart.  I wish to present you to her now.  As soon as I have
 reunited you with her, I shall continue my way alone; for you
 have no call to go with me.  I have no need cf your company; but
 I fain would know your name."  "Sire," says he, "as you wish. 
 Since you desire to know my name, it must not be kept from you. 
 My name is Cadoc of Tabriol: know that thus I am called.  But
 since I must part from you.  I should like to know, if it may be,
 who you are and of what land, where I may sometime find and
 search for you, when I shall go a way from here."  Erec replies:
 "Friend, that I will never confide to you.  Never speak of it
 again; but if you wish to find it out and do me honour in any
 wise go quickly now without delay to my lord, King Arthur, who
 with might and main is hunting the stag in yonder wood, as I take
 it, not five short leagues from here.  Go thither quickly and
 take him word that you are sent to him as a gift by him whom
 yesterday within his tent he joyfully received and lodged.  And
 be careful not to conceal from him from what peril I set free
 both your life and body.  I am dearly cherished at the court, and
 if you present yourself in my name you will do me a service and
 honour.  There you shall ask who I am; but you cannot know it
 otherwise."  "Sire," says Cadoc, "I will follow your bidding in
 all respects.  You need never have any fear that I do not go with
 a glad heart.  I shall tell the King the full truth regarding the
 battle which you have fought on my behalf."  Thus speaking, they
 continued their way until they came to the maiden where Erec had
 left her.  The damsel's joy knew no bounds when she saw coming
 her lover whom she never thought to see again.  Taking him by the
 hand, Erec presents him to her with the words: "Grieve no longer,
 demoiselle!  Behold your lover glad and joyous."  And she with
 prudence makes reply: "Sire, by right you have won us both. 
 Yours we should be, to serve and honour.  But who could ever
 repay half the debt we owe you?"  Erec makes answer: "My gentle
 lady, no recompense do I ask of you.  To God I now commend you
 both, for too long, methinks, I have tarried here."  Then he
 turns his horse about, and rides away as fast as he can.  Cadoc
 of Tabriol with his damsel rides off in another direction; and
 soon he told the news to King Arthur and the Queen.

 (26) This sentence contains the motive for all the action in the
      sequel.  The same situation is threatened in "Yvain", but
      there Gawain rescues the hero from the lethargy, ignoble in
      the eyes of a feudal audience, into which he was falling. 
      Cf. also "Marques de Rome" ("Lit. Verein in Stuttgart",
      Tubingen, 1889), p. 36, where the Empress of Rome thus
      incites her husband to the chase: "Toz jors cropez vos a
      Postel; vos n'estes point chevalereus, si come vos deussiez
      estre, si juenes hom come vos estes"; also J. Gower, "Le
      Mirour de l'omme, 22, 813 ff.:
           "Rois est des femmes trop decu,
           Qant plus les ayme que son dieu,
           Dont laist honour pour foldelit:
           Cil Rois ne serra pas cremu,
           Q'ensi voet laisser sou escu
           Et querre le bataille ou lit."
 <p>
 (27) This brusque command, implying so sudden a change in Erec's
      attitude toward his wife, initiates a long series of tests
      of Enide's devotion, which fill the rest of the romance. 
      Why did Erec treat his wife with such severity?  In the
      Mabinogi of "Geraint the Son of Erbin", it is plain that
      jealousy was the hero's motive.  The reader of "Erec" may
      judge whether, as we believe, the hero's sudden resolve is
      not rather that of a man piqued at being justly reproved by
      his wife for a delinquency he had not himself remarked;
      irate at his wife's imputation, and fearful of having
      forfeited her respect, he starts out to redeem his
      reputation in her eyes, and to maker her retract any
      insinuation she had made.  Erec is simply angry with
      himself, but he expends his wrath upon his defenceless wife
      until he is reassured of her love and respect for him.
 </p><p>
 (28) The situation here is a common one.  Parallels will be found
      in the "Voyage de Charlemagne", in the first tale of the
      "Arabian Nights", in the poem "Biterolf and Dietlieb", and
      in the English ballad of "King Arthur and King Cornwall". 
      Professor Child, in his "English and Scotch Ballads",
      indexes the ballads in his collection, which present this
      motive, under the following caption: "King who regards
      himself as the richest, most magnificent, etc., in the
      world, is told that there is one who outstrips him, and
      undertakes to see for himself whether this is so,
      threatening death to the person who has affirmed his
      inferiority in case this is disproved."

      G. Paris in "Romania", xx. 149.

 (30) Kay the Seneschal appears here for the first time in
      Chretien's poems with the character which he regularly
      ascribes to him.  Readers of Arthurian romance are all
      familiar with Sir Kay; they will find that in Chretien, the
      seneschal, in addition to his undeniable qualities of
      bravery and frankness, has less pleasing traits; he is
      foolhardy, tactless, mean, and a disparager of others'
      merit.  He figures prominently in "Yvain" and "Lancelot". 
      His poetic history has not yet been written.  His role in
      the German romances has been touched upon by Dr. Friedrich
      Sachse, "Ueber den Ritter Kei" (Berlin, 1860).

 (32) In the French epic poems and romances of adventure alike it
      is customary for giants and all manner of rustic boors to
      carry clubs, the arms of knighthood being appropriate for
      such ignoble creatures.  Other instances of this convention
      will be remarked in the text.
