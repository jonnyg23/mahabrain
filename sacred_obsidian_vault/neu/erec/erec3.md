 <h1 align="CENTER">EREC ET ENIDE</h1>
 
 <h2 align="CENTER">Part III: Vv. 4580 - Vv. 6598</h2>
 
 <br>
 (Vv. 4580-4778.)  Erec continues to ride at great speed to the
 place where Enide was awaiting him in great concern, thinking
 that surely he had completely deserted her.  And he, too, was in
 great fear lest some one, finding her alone, might have carried
 her off.  So he made all haste to return.  But the heat of the
 day was such, and his arms caused him such distress, that his
 wounds broke open and burst the bandages.  His wounds never
 stopped bleeding before he came directly to the spot where Enide
 was waiting for him.  She espied him and rejoiced: but she did
 not realise or know the pain from which he was suffering; for all
 his body was bathed in blood, and his heart hardly had strength
 to beat.  As he was descending a hill he fell suddenly over upon
 his horse's neck.  As he tried to straighten up, he lost his
 saddle and stirrups, falling, as if lifeless, in a faint.  Then
 began such heavy grief, when Enide saw him fall to earth.  Full
 of fear at the sight of him, she runs toward him like one who
 makes no concealment of her grief.  Aloud she cries, and wrings
 her hands: not a shred of her robe remains untorn across her
 breast.  She begins to tear her hair and lacerate her tender
 face. (33)  "Ah God!" she cries, "fair gentle Lord, why dost Thou
 let me thus live on?  Come Death, and kill me hastily!"  With
 these words she faints upon his body.  When she recovered, she
 said to herself reproachfully: "Woe is me, wretched Enide; I am
 the murderer of my lord, in having killed him by my speech.  My
 lord would still be now alive, if I in my mad presumption had not
 spoken the word which engaged him in this adventure.  Silence
 never harmed any one, but speech often worketh woe.  The truth of
 this I have tried and proved in more ways than one."  Beside her
 lord she took her seat, holding his head upon her lap.  Then she
 begins her dole anew.  "Alas," she says, "my lord, unhappy thou,
 thou who never hadst a peer; for in thee was beauty seen and
 prowess was made manifest; wisdom had given thee its heart, and
 largess set a crown upon thee, without which no one is esteemed.
 But what did I say?  A grievous mistake I made in uttering the
 word which has killed my lord -- that fatal poisoned word for
 which I must justly be reproached; and I recognise and admit that
 no one is guilty but myself; I alone must be blamed for this."
 Then fainting she falls upon the ground, and when she later sat
 up again, she only moans again the more: "God, what shall I do,
 and why live on?  Why does Death delay and hesitate to come and
 seize me without respite?  Truly, Death holds me in great
 contempt!  Since Death does not deign to take my life, I must
 myself perforce achieve the vengeance for my sinful deed.  Thus
 shall I die in spite of Death, who will not heed my call for aid.
 Yet, I cannot die through mere desire, nor would complaining
 avail me aught.  The sword, which my lord had gilded on, ought by
 right to avenge his death.  I will not longer consume myself in
 distress, in prayer, and vain desire."  She draws the sword forth
 from its sheath and begins to consider it.  God, who is full of
 mercy, caused her to delay a little; and while she passes in
 review her sorrow and her misfortune, behold there comes riding
 apace a Count with numerous suite, who from afar had heard the
 lady's loud outcry.  God did not wish to desert her; for now she
 would have killed herself, had she not been surprised by those
 who took away from her the sword and thrust it back into its
 sheath.  The Count then dismounted from his horse and began to
 inquire of her concerning the knight, and whether she was his
 wife or his lady-love.  "Both one and the other, sire," she says,
 "my sorrow is such as I cannot tell.  Woe is me that I am not
 dead."  And the Count begins to comfort her: "Lady," he says, "by
 the Lord, I pray you, to take some pity on yourself!  It is meet
 that you should mourn, but it is no use to be disconsolate; for
 you may yet rise to high estate.  Do not sink into apathy, but
 comfort yourself; that will be wise, and God will give you joy
 again.  Your wondrous beauty holds good fortune in store for you;
 for I will take you as my wife, and make you a countess and dame
 of rank: this ought to bring you much consolation.  And I shall
 have the body removed and laid away with great honour.  Leave off
 now this grief of yours which in your frenzy you display."  And
 she replies: "Sire, begone!  For God's sake, let me be!  You can
 accomplish nothing here.  Nothing that one could say or do could
 ever make me glad again."  At this the Count drew back and said:
 "Let us make a bier, whereon to carry away this body with the
 lady to the town of Limors.  There the body shall be interred.
 Then will I espouse the lady, whether or not she give consent:
 for never did I see any one so fair, nor desire any as I do her.
 Happy I am to have met with her.  Now make quickly and without
 delay a proper bier for this dead knight.  Halt not for the
 trouble, nor from sloth."  Then some of his men draw out their
 swords and soon cut two saplings, upon which they laid branches
 cross-wise.  Upon this litter they laid Erec down; then hitched
 two horses to it.  Enide rides alongside, not ceasing to make
 lament, and often fainting and falling back; but the horsemen
 hold her tight, and try to support her with their arms, and raise
 her up and comfort her.  All the way to Limors they escort the
 body, until they come to the palace of the Count.  All the people
 follow up after them -- ladies, knights, and townspeople.  In the
 middle off the hall upon a dais they stretched the body out full
 length, with his lance and shield alongside.  The hall is full,
 the crowd is dense.  Each one is anxious to inquire what is this
 trouble, what marvel here.  Meanwhile the Count takes counsel
 with his barons privily.  "My lords," he says, "upon the spot I
 wish to espouse this lady here.  We can plainly judge by her
 beauty and prudent mien that she is of very gentle rank.  Her
 beauty and noble bearing show that the honour of a kingdom or
 empire might well be bestowed upon her.  I shall never suffer
 disgrace through her; rather I think to win more honour.  Have my
 chaplain summoned now, and do you go and fetch the lady.  The
 half of all my land I will give her as her dower if she will
 comply with my desire."  Then they bade the chaplain come, in
 accordance with the Count's command, and the dame they brought
 there, too, and made her marry him perforce; for she flatly
 refused to give consent.  But in spite of all, the Count married
 her in accordance with his wish.  And when he had married her,
 the constable at once had the tables set in the palace, and had
 the food prepared; for already it was time for the evening meal.
 <p>
 (Vv. 4779-4852.)  After vespers, that day in May, Enide was in
 sore distress, nor did her grief cease to trouble her.  And the
 Count urged her mildly by prayer and threat to make her peace and
 be consoled, and he made her sit down upon a chair, though it was
 against her will.  In spite of her, they made her take a seat and
 placed the table in front of her.  The Count takes his place on
 the other side, almost beside himself with rage to find that he
 cannot comfort her.  "Lady," he says, "you must now leave off
 this grief and banish it.  You can have full trust in me, that
 honour and riches will be yours.  You must surely realise that
 mourning will not revive the dead; for no one ever saw such a
 thing come about.  Remember now, though poor you were, that great
 riches are within your reach.  Once you were poor; rich now you
 will be.  Fortune has not been stingy toward you, in bestowing
 upon you the honour of being henceforth hailed as Countess.  It
 is true that your lord is dead.  If you grieve and lament because
 of this, do you think that I am surprised?  Nay.  But I am giving
 you the best advice I know how to give.  In that I have married
 you, you ought to be content.  Take care you do not anger me! 
 Eat now, as I bid you do."  And she replies: "Not I, my lord.  In
 faith, as long as I live I will neither eat nor drink unless I
 first see my lord eat who is lying on yonder dais"  "Lady, that
 can never be.  People will think that you are mad when you talk
 such great nonsense.  You will receive a poor reward if you give
 occasion to-day for further reproof."  To this she vouchsafed no
 reply, holding his threats in slight esteem, and the Count
 strikes her upon the face.  At this she shrieks, and the barons
 present blame the Count.  "Hold. sire!" they cry to the Count;
 "you ought to be ashamed of having struck this lady because she
 will not eat.  You have done a very ugly deed.  If this lady is
 distressed because of her lord whom she now sees dead, no one
 should say that she is wrong."  "Keep silence, all." the Count
 replies; "the dame is mine and I am hers, and I will do with her
 as I please."  At this she could not hold her peace, but swears
 she will never be his.  And the Count springs up and strikes her
 again, and she cries out aloud.  "Ha!  wretch," she says, "I care
 not what thou say to me, or what thou do!  I fear not thy blows,
 nor yet thy threats.  Beat me and strike me, as thou wilt.  I
 shall never heed thy power so much as to do thy bidding more or
 less, even were thou with thy hands fight now to snatch out my
 eyes or flay me alive."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4853-4938.)  In the midst of these words and disputes Erec
 recovered from his swoon, like a man who awakes from sleep.  No
 wonder that he was amazed at the crowd of people he saw around.
 But great was his grief and great his woe when he heard the voice
 of his wife.  He stepped to the floor from off the dais and
 quickly drew his sword.  Wrath and the love he bore his wife gave
 him courage.  He runs thither where he sees her, and strikes the
 Count squarely upon the head, so that he beats out his brains
 and, knocking in his forehead, leaves him senseless and
 speechless; his blood and brains flow out.  The knights spring
 from the tables, persuaded that it is the devil who had made his
 way among them there.  Of young or old there none remains, for
 all were thrown in great dismay.  Each one tries to outrun the
 other in beating a hasty retreat.  Soon they were all clear of
 the palace, and cry aloud, both weak and strong: "Flee, flee,
 here comes the corpse!"  At the door the press is great: each one
 strives to make his escape, and pushes and shoves as best he may.
 He who is last in the surging throng would fain get into the
 foremost line.  Thus they make good their escape in flight, for
 one dares not stand upon another's going.  Erec ran to seize his
 shield, hanging it about his neck by the strap, while Enide lays
 hands upon the lance.  Then they step out into the courtyard.
 There is no one so bold as to offer resistance; for they did not
 believe it could be a man who had thus expelled them, but a devil
 or some enemy who had entered the dead body.  Erec pursues them
 as they flee, and finds outside in the castle-yard a stable-boy
 in the act of leading his steed to the watering-place, all
 equipped with bridle and saddle.  This chance encounter pleased
 Erec well: as he steps up quickly to the horse, the boy in fear
 straightway yields him up.  Erec takes his seat between the
 saddle-bows, while Enide, seizing the stirrup, springs up on to
 the horse's neck, as Erec, who bade her mount, commanded and
 instructed her to do.  The horse bears them both away; and
 finding open the town gate, they make their escape without
 detention.  In the town there was great anxiety about the Count
 who had been killed; but there is no one, however brave, who
 follows Erec to take revenge.  At his table the Count was slain;
 while Erec, who bears his wife away, embraces and kisses and
 gives her cheer.  In his arms he clasps her against his heart,
 and says: "Sweet sister mine, my proof of you has been complete!
 Be no more concerned in any wise, for I love you now more than
 ever I did before; and I am certain and rest assured that you
 love me with a perfect love.  From this time on for evermore, I
 offer myself to do your will just as I used to do before.  And if
 you have spoken ill of me, I pardon you and call you quit of both
 the offence and the word you spoke."  Then he kisses her again
 and clasps her tight.  Now Enide is not ill at ease when her lord
 clasps and kisses her and tells her again that he loves her
 still.  Rapidly through the night they ride, and they are very
 glad that the moon shines bright.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4939-5058.)  Meanwhile, the news has travelled fast, and
 there is nothing else so quick.  The news had reached Guivret the
 Little that a knight wounded with arms had been found dead in the
 forest, and that with him was a lady making moan, and so wondrous
 fair that Iseut would have seemed her waiting-maid.  Count
 Oringle of Limors had found them both, and had caused the corpse
 to be borne away, and wished himself to espouse the lady; but she
 refused him.  When Guivret heard this news, he was by no means
 pleased; for at once the thought of Erec occurred to him.  It
 came into his heart and mind to go and seek out the lady, and to
 have the body honourably interred. if it should turn out to be
 he.  He assembled a thousand men-at-arms and knights to take the
 town.  If the Count would not surrender of his own accord the
 body and the lady, he would put all to fire and flame.  In the
 moonlight shining clear he led his men on toward Limors, with
 helmets laced, in hauberks clad, and from their necks the shields
 were hung.  Thus, under arms, they all advanced until nearly
 midnight, when Erec espied them.  Now he expects to be ensnared
 or killed or captured inevitably.  He makes Enide dismount beside
 a thicket-hedge.  No wonder if he is dismayed.  "Lady, do you
 stay here," he says, "beside this thicket-hedge a while, until
 these people shall have passed.  I do not wish them to catch
 sight of you, for I do not know what manner of people they are,
 nor of what they go in search.  I trust we may not attract their
 attention.  But I see nowhere any place where we could take
 refuge, should they wish to injure us.  I know not if any harm
 may come to me, but not from fear shall I fail to sally out
 against them.  And if any one assails me, I shall not fail to
 joust with him.  Yet, I am so sore and weary that it is no wonder
 if I grieve.  Now to meet them I must go, and do you stay quiet
 here.  Take care that no one see you, until they shall have left
 you far behind."  Behold now Guivret, with lance outstretched,
 who espied him from afar.  They did not recognise each other, for
 the moon had gone behind the shadow of a dark cloud.  Erec was
 weak and exhausted, and his antagonist was quite recovered from
 his wounds and blows.  Now Erec will be far from wise if he does
 not promptly make himself known.  He steps out from the hedge.
 And Guivret spurs toward him without speaking to him at all, nor
 does Erec utter a word to him: he thought he could do more than
 he could.  Whoever tries to run farther than he is able must
 perforce give up or take a rest.  They clash against each other;
 but the fight was unequal, for one was weak and the other strong.
 Guivret strikes him with such force that he carries him down to
 earth from his horse's back.  Enide, who was in hiding, when she
 sees her lord on the ground, expects to be killed and badly used.
 Springing forth from the hedge, she runs to help her lord.  If
 she grieved before, now her anguish is greater.  Coming up to
 Guivret, she seized his horse's rein, and then said: "Cursed be
 thou, knight!  For thou hast attacked a weak and exhausted man,
 who is in pain and mortally wounded, with such injustice that
 thou canst not find reason for thy deed.  If thou hadst been
 alone and helpless, thou wouldst have rued this attack, provided
 my lord had been in health.  Now be generous and courteous, and
 kindly let cease this battle which thou hast begun.  For thy
 reputation would be no better for having killed or captured a
 knight who has not the strength to rise, as thou canst see.  For
 he has suffered so many blows of arms that he is all covered with
 wounds"  And he replies: "Fear not, lady!  I see that loyally you
 love your lord, and I commend you for it.  Have no fear
 whatsoever of me or of my company.  But tell me now without
 concealment what is the name of your lord; for only advantage
 will you get from telling me.  Whoever he be, tell me his name;
 then he shall go safe and unmolested.  Neither he nor you have
 aught to fear, for you are both in safe hands."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5059-5172.)  Then Enide learns that she is safe, she answers
 him briefly in a word: "His name is Erec; I ought not to lie, for
 I see you are honest and of good intent."  Guivret, in his
 delight, dismounts and goes to fall at Erec's feet, where he was
 lying on the ground.  "My lord," he says, "I was going to seek
 for you, and was on my way to Limors, where I expected to find
 you dead.  It was told and recounted to me as true that Count
 Oringle had carried off to Limors a knight who was mortally
 wounded, and that he wickedly intended to marry a lady whom he
 had found in his company; but that she would have nothing to do
 with him.  And I was coming urgently to aid and deliver her.  If
 he refused to hand over to me both the lady and you without
 resistance, I should esteem myself of little worth if I left him
 a foot of earth to stand upon.  Be sure that had I not loved you
 dearly I should never have taken this upon myself.  I am Guivret,
 your friend; but if I have done you any hurt through my failure
 to recognise you, you surely ought to pardon me."  At this Erec
 sat up, for he could do no more, and said: "Rise up, my friend.
 Be absolved of the harm you have done me, since you did not
 recognise me."  Guivret gets up, and Erec tells him how he has
 killed the Count while he sat at meat, and how he had gained
 possession again of his steed in front of the stable, and how the
 sergeants and the squires had fled across the yard, crying:
 "Flee, flee, the corpse is chasing us;" then, how he came near
 being caught, and how he escaped through the town and down the
 hill, carrying his wife on his horse's neck: all this adventure
 of his he told him.  Then Guivret said, "Sire, I have a castle
 here close by, which is well placed in a healthful site.  For
 your comfort and benefit I wish to take you there to-morrow and
 have your wounds cared for.  I have two charming and sprightly
 sisters who are skilful in the care of wounds: they will soon
 completely cure you. (34)  To-night we shall let our company
 lodge here in the fields until morning; for I think a little rest
 to-night will do you much good.  My advice is that we spend the
 night here."  Erec replies: "I am in favour of doing so."  So
 there they stayed and spent the night.  They were not reluctant
 to prepare a lodging-place, but they found few accommodations,
 for the company was quite numerous.  They lodge as best they may
 among the bushes: Guivret had his tent set up, and ordered tinder
 to be kindled, that they might have light and cheer.  He has
 tapers taken out from the boxes, and they light them within the
 tent.  Now Enide no longer grieves, for all has turned out well.
 She strips her lord of his arms and clothes, and having washed
 his wounds, she dried them and bound them up again; for she would
 let no one else touch him.  Now Erec knows no further reason to
 reproach her, for he has tried her well and found that she bears
 great love to him.  And Guivret, who treats them kindly, had a
 high, long bed constructed of quilted coverlids, laid upon grass
 and reed, which they found in abundance.  There they laid Erec
 and covered him up.  Then Guivret opened a box and took out two
 patties.  "Friend," says he, "now try a little of these cold
 patties, and drink some wine mixed with water.  I have as much as
 six barrels of it, but undiluted it is not good for you; for you
 are injured and covered with wounds.  Fair sweet friend, now try
 to eat; for it will do you good.  And my lady will eat some too
 -- your wife who has been to-day in sore distress on your
 account.  But you have received full satisfaction for all that,
 and have escaped.  So eat now, and I will eat too, fair friend."
 Then Guivret sat down by Erec's side, and so did Enide who was
 much pleased by all that Guivret did.  Both of them urge him to
 eat, giving him wine mixed with water'; for unmixed it is too
 strong and heating.  Erec ate as a sick man eats, and drank a
 little -- all he dared.  But he rested comfortably and slept all
 night; for on his account no noise or disturbance was made.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5173-5366.)  In the early morning they awoke, and prepared
 again to mount and ride.  Erec was so devoted to his own horse
 that he would ride no other.  They gave to Enide a mule, for she
 had lost her palfrey.  But she was not concerned; to judge by her
 looks, she gave the matter no thought. She had a good mule with
 an easy gait that bore her very comfortably.  And it gave her
 great satisfaction that Erec was not cast down, but rather
 assured them that he would recover completely.  Before the third
 hour they reached Penevric, a strong castle, well and handsomely
 situated.  There dwelt the two sisters of Guivret; for the place
 was agreeable enough.  Guivret escorted Erec to a delightful,
 airy room in a remote part of the castle.  His sisters, at his
 request, exerted themselves to cure Erec; and Erec placed himself
 in their hands, for they inspired him with perfect confidence.
 First, they removed the dead flesh, then applied plaster and
 lint, devoting to his care all their skill, like women who knew
 their business well.  Again and again they washed his wounds and
 applied the plaster.  Four times or more each day they made him
 eat and drink, allowing him, however, no garlic or pepper.  But
 whoever might go in or out Enide was always with him, being more
 than any one else concerned.  Guivret often came in to ask and
 inquire if he wanted anything.  He was well kept and well served,
 and everything that he wished was willingly done.  But the
 damsels cheerfully and gladly showed such devotion in caring for
 him that by the end of a fortnight he felt no hurt or pain. 
 Then, to bring his colour back, they began to give him baths.
 There was no need to instruct the damsels, for they understood
 the treatment well.  When he was able to walk about. Guivret had
 two loose gowns made of two different kinds of silk, one trimmed
 with ermine, the other with vair.  One was of a dark purple
 colour, and the other striped, sent to him as a present by a
 cousin of his from Scotland.  Enide had the purple gown trimmed
 with ermine, which was very precious, while Erec had the striped
 stuff with the fur, which was no less valuable.  Now Erec was
 strong and well, cured and recovered.  Now that Enide was very
 happy and had everything she desired, her great beauty returned
 to her; for her great distress had affected her so much that she
 was very pale and wan.  Now she was embraced and kissed, now she
 was blessed with all good things, now she had her joy and
 pleasures; for unadorned they lie in bed and each enfolds and
 kisses the other; nothing gives them so much joy.  They have had
 so much pain and sorrow, he for her, and she for him, that now
 they have their satisfaction.  Each vies in seeking to please the
 other.  Of their further sport I must not speak.  Now they have
 so welded their love and forgotten their grief that they scarcely
 remember it any more.  But now they must go on their way; so they
 asked his leave to depart from Guivret, in whom they had found a
 friend indeed; for he had honoured and served them in every way.
 When he came to take leave, Erec said: "Sire, I do not wish to
 delay longer my departure for my own land.  Order everything to
 be prepared and collected, in order that I may have all I need. 
 I shall wish to start to-morrow morning, as soon as it is day.  I
 have stayed so long with you that I feel strong and vigorous. 
 God grant, if it please Him, that I may live to meet you again
 somewhere, when I may be able in my turn to serve and honour you.
 Unless I am captured or detained, I do not expect to tarry
 anywhere until I reach the court of King Arthur, whom I hope to
 find either at Robais or Carduel."  To which Guivret makes prompt
 reply, "Sire, you shall not go off alone!  For I myself shall go
 with you and shall take companions with us, if it be your
 pleasure."  Erec accedes to this advice, and says that, in
 accordance with his plans, he wishes the journey to be begun. 
 That night they make preparations for their journey, not wishing
 to delay there longer.  They all make ready and prepare.  In the
 early morning, when they awake, the saddles are placed upon the
 steeds.  Before he leaves, Erec goes to bid farewell to the
 damsels in their rooms; and Enide (who was glad and full of joy)
 thither follows him.  When their preparations for departure were
 made, they took their leave of the damsels.  Erec, who was very
 courteous, in taking leave of them, thanks them for his health
 and life, and pledges to them his service.  Then he took one of
 them by the hand she who was the nearer to him and Enide took the
 other's hand: hand in hand they came up from the bedroom into the
 castle hall.  Guivret urges them to mount at once without delay.
 Enide thinks the time will never come for them to mount.  They
 bring around to the block for her a good-tempered palfrey, a soft
 stepper, handsome and well shaped.  The palfrey was of fine
 appearance and a good mount: it was no less valuable than her own
 which had stayed behind at Limors.  That other one was dappled,
 this one was sorrel; but the head was of another colour: it was
 marked in such a way that one cheek was all white, while the
 other was raven black.  Between the two colours there was a line,
 greener than a grape-vine leaf, which separated the white from
 the black.  Of the bridle, breast-strap, and saddle I can surely
 say that the workmanship was rich and handsome.  All the breast-
 strap and bridle was of gold set with emeralds.  The saddle was
 decorated in another style, covered with a precious purple cloth.
 The saddle-bows were of ivory, on which was carved the story of
 how Aeneas came from Troy, how at Carthage with great joy Dido
 received him to her bed, how Aeneas deceived her, and how for him
 she killed herself, how Aeneas conquered Laurentum and all
 Lombardy, of which he was king all his life. (35)  Cunning was
 the workmanship and well carved, all decorated with fine gold.  A
 skilful craftsman, who made it spent more than seven years in
 carving it, without touching any other piece of work.  I do not
 know whether he sold it; but he ought to have obtained a good
 price for it.  Now that Enide was presented with this palfrey,
 she was well compensated for the loss of her own.  The palfrey, 
 thus richly apparelled, was given to her and she mounted it
 gladly; then the gentlemen and squires quickly mounted too.  For
 their pleasure and sport Guivret caused to be taken with them
 rich falcons, both young and moulted, many a tercel and
 sparrow-hawk, and many a setter and greyhound.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5367-5446.) (36) They rode straight on from morn till eve
 more than thirty Welsh leagues, and then came to the towers of a
 stronghold, rich and fair, girt all about with a new wall.  And
 all around, beneath this wall, ran a very deep stream, roaring
 rushing like a storm.  Erec stops to look at it, and ask and find
 out if any one could truly tell him who was the lord of this
 town.  "Friend," said he to his kind companion, "could you tell
 me the name of this town, and whose it is?  Tell me if it belongs
 to a count or a king.  Since you have brought me here, tell me,
 if you know."  "Sire," he says, "I know very well, and will tell
 you the truth about it.  The name of the town is Brandigant, and
 it is so strong and fine that it fears neither king nor emperor.
 If France, and all of England, and all who live from here to
 Liege were ranged about to lay a siege, they would never take it
 in their lives; for the isle on which the town stands stretches
 away four leagues or more, and within the enclosure grows all
 that a rich town needs: fruit and wheat and wine are found; and
 of wood and water there is no lack.  It fears no assault on any
 side, nor could anything reduce it to starvation.  King Evrain
 had it fortified, and he has possessed it all his days
 unmolested, and will possess it all his life.  But not because he
 feared any one did he thus fortify it; but the town is more
 pleasing so.  For if it had no wall or tower, but only the stream
 that encircles it, it would still be so secure and strong that it
 would have no fear of the whole world."  "God!" said Erec, "what
 great wealth!  Let us go and see the fortress, and we shall take
 lodging in the town, for I wish to stop here."  "Sire," said the
 other in great distress, "were it not to disappoint you, we
 should not stop here.  In the town there is a dangerous passage."
 "Dangerous?" says Erec; "do you know about it?  Whatever it be,
 tell us about it; for very gladly would I know."  "Sire," says
 he, "I should fear that you might suffer some harm there.  I know
 there is so much boldness and excellence in your heart that, were
 I to tell you what I know of the perilous and hard adventure, you
 would wish to enter in.  I have often heard the story, and more
 than seven years have passed since any one that went in quest of
 the adventure has come back from the town; yet, proud, bold
 knights have come hither from many a land.  Sire, do not treat
 this as a jest: for you will never learn the secret from me until
 you shall have promised me, by the love you have sworn to me,
 that never by you will be undertaken this adventure, from which
 no one escapes without receiving shame or death."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5447-5492.)  Now Erec hears what pleases him, and begs
 Guivret not to be grieved, saying: "Ah, fair sweet friend, permit
 that our lodging be made in the town, and do not be disturbed. 
 It is time to halt for the night, and so I trust that it will not
 displease you; for if any honour comes to us here you ought to be
 very glad.  I appeal to you conceding the adventure that you tell
 me just the name of it, and I'll not insist upon the rest." 
 "Sire." he says, "I cannot be silent and refuse the information
 you desire.  The name is very fair to say, but the execution is
 very hard: for no one can come from it alive.  The adventure,
 upon my word, is called `the Joy of the Court.'"  "God!  there
 can be nothing but good in joy," says Erec; "I go to seek it.
 Don't go now and discourage me about this or anything else, fair
 gentle friend; but let us have our lodgings taken, for great good
 may come to us of this.  Nothing could restrain me from going to
 seek the Joy."  "Sire," says he, "God grant your prayer, that you
 may find joy and return without mishap.  I clearly see that we
 must go in.  Since otherwise it may not be, let us go in.  Our
 lodging is secured; for no knight of high degree, as I have heard
 it said and told, can enter this castle with intent to lodge here
 but that King Evrain offers to shelter him.  So gentle and
 courteous is the King that he has given notice to all his
 townsmen, appealing to their love for him, that any gentleman
 from afar should not find lodging in their houses, so that he
 himself may do honour to all gentlemen who may wish to tarry
 here."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5493-5668.) (37) Thus they proceed toward the castle,
 passing the list and the drawbridge; and when they passed the
 listing-place, the people who were gathered in the streets in
 crowds see Erec in all his beauty, and apparently they think and
 believe that all the others are in his train.  Marvelling much,
 they stare at him; the whole town was stirred and moved, as they
 take counsel and discuss about him.  Even the maidens at their
 song leave off their singing and desist, as all together they
 look at him; and because of his great beauty they cross
 themselves, and marvellously they pity him.  One to another
 whispers low: "Alas!  This knight, who is passing, is on his way
 to the `Joy of the Court.'  He will be sorry before he returns;
 no one ever came from another land to claim the `Joy of the
 Court' who did not receive shame and harm, and leave his head
 there as a forfeit."  Then, that he may hear their words, they
 cry-aloud: "God defend thee, knight, from harm; for thou art
 wondrously handsome, and thy beauty is greatly to be pitied, for
 to-morrow we shall see it quenched.  Tomorrow thy death is come;
 to-morrow thou shalt surely die if God does not guard and defend
 thee."  Erec hears and understands that they are speaking of him
 through the lower town: more than two thousand pitied him; but
 nothing causes him dismay.  He passes on without delay, bowing
 gaily to men and women alike.  And they all salute him too; and
 most of them swear with anxiety, fearing more than he does
 himself, for his shame and for his hurt.  The mere sight of his
 countenance, his great beauty and his bearing, has so won to him
 the hearts of all, that knights, ladies, and maids alike fear his
 harm.  King Evrain hears the news that men were arriving at his
 court who brought with them a numerous train, and by his harness
 it appeared that their leader was a count or king.  King Evrain
 comes down the street to meet them, and saluting them he cries:
 "Welcome to this company, both to the master and all his suite. 
 Welcome, gentlemen!  Dismount."  They dismounted, and there were
 plenty to receive and take their horses.  Nor was King Evrain
 backward when he saw Enide coming; but he straightway saluted her
 and ran to help her to dismount.  Taking her white and tender
 hand, he led her up into the palace, as was required by courtesy,
 and honoured her in every way he could, for he knew right well
 what he ought to do, without nonsense and without malice.  He
 ordered a chamber to be scented with incense, myrrh, and aloes. 
 When they entered, they all complimented King Evrain on its fine
 appearance.  Hand in hand they enter the room, the King escorting
 them and taking great pleasure in them.  But why should I
 describe to you the paintings and the silken draperies with which
 the room was decorated?  I should only waste time in folly, and I
 do not wish to waste it, but rather to hasten on a little; for he
 who travels the straight road passes him who turns aside;
 therefore I do not wish to tarry.  When the time and hour
 arrived, the King orders supper to be prepared; but I do not wish
 to stop over that if I can find some more direct way.  That night
 they had in abundance all that heart desires and craves: birds,
 venison, and fruit, and wines of different sorts.  But better
 than all is a happy cheer!  For of all dishes the sweetest is a
 joyful countenance and a happy face.  They were very richly
 served until Erec suddenly left off eating and drinking, and
 began speaking of what rested most upon his heart: he remembered
 `the Joy', and began a conversation about it in which King Evrain
 joined.  "Sire" says he, "it is time now to tell you what I
 intend, and why I have come here.  Too long I have refrained from
 speech, and now can no longer conceal my object.  I ask you for
 `the Joy' of the Court, for I covet nothing else so much.  Grant
 it to me, whatever it be, if you are in control of it."  "In
 truth, fair friend." the King replies, "I hear you speak great
 nonsense.  This is a very parlous thing, which has caused sorrow
 to many a worthy man; you yourself will eventually be killed and
 undone if you will not heed my counsel.  But if you were willing
 to take my word, I should advise you to desist from soliciting so
 grievous a thing in which you would never succeed.  Speak of it
 no more!  Hold your peace!  It would be imprudent on your part
 not to follow my advice.  I am not at all surprised that you
 desire honour and fame; but if I should see you harmed or injured
 in your body I should be distressed at heart.  And know well that
 I have seen many a man ruined who solicited this joy.  They were
 never any the better for it, but rather did they all die and
 perish.  Before to-morrow's evening come you may expect a like
 reward.  If you wish to strive for the Joy, you shall do so,
 though it grieve me sore.  It is something from which you are
 free to retreat and draw back if you wish to work your welfare. 
 Therefore I tell you, for I should commit treachery and do you
 wrong were I not to tell you all the truth."  Erec hears him and
 admits that the King with reason counsels him.  But the greater
 the wonder and the more perilous the adventure, the more he
 covets it and yearns for it, saying: "Sire, I can tell you that I
 find you a worthy and a loyal man, and I can put no blame on you. 
 I wish to undertake {his boon, however it may fall out with me. 
 The die is cast, for I shall never draw back from anything I have
 undertaken without exerting all my strength before I quit the
 field."  "I know that well," the King replied; "you are acting
 against my will.  You shall have the Joy which you desire.  But I
 am in great despair; for I greatly fear you will be undone.  But
 now be assured that you shall have what you desire.  If you come
 out of it happily, you will have won such great honour that never
 did man win greater; and may God, as I desire, grant you a joyous
 deliverance."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5669-5738.)  All that night they talked of it, until the
 beds were prepared and they went to rest.  In the morning, when
 it was daylight, Erec, who was on the watch, saw the clear dawn
 and the sun, and quickly rising, clothed himself.  Enide again is
 in distress, very sad and ill at ease; all night she is greatly
 disquieted with the solicitude and fear which she felt for her
 lord, who is about to expose himself to great peril.  But
 nevertheless he equips himself, for no one can make him change
 his mind.  For his equipment the King sent him, when he arose,
 arms which he put to good use.  Erec did not refuse them, for his
 own were worn and impaired and in bad state.  He gladly accepted
 the arms and had himself equipped with them in the hall.  When he
 was armed, he descends the steps and finds his horse saddled and
 the King who had mounted.  Every one in the castle and in the
 houses of the town hastened to mount.  In all the town there
 remained neither man nor woman, erect or deformed, great or
 small, weak or strong, who is able to go and does not do so. 
 When they start, there is a great noise and clamour in all the
 streets; for those of high and low degree alike cry out: "Alas,
 alas!  oh knight, the Joy that thou wishest to win has betrayed
 thee, and thou goest to win but grief and death."  And there is
 not one but says: "God curse this joy!  which has been the death
 of so many gentlemen.  To-day it will wreak the worst woe that it
 has ever yet wrought."  Erec hears well and notes that up and
 down they said of him: "Alas, alas, ill-starred wert thou, fair,
 gentle, skilful knight!  Surely it would not be just that thy
 life should end so soon, or that harm should come to wound and
 injure thee."  He hears clearly the words and what they said; but
 notwithstanding, he passes on without lowering his head, and
 without the bearing of a craven.  Whoever may speak, he longs to
 see and know and understand why they are all in such distress,
 anxiety, and woe.  The King leads him without the town into a
 garden that stood near by; and all the people follow after,
 praying that from this trial God may grant him a happy issue. 
 But it is not meet that I should pass on, from weariness and
 exhaustion of tongue, without telling you the whole truth about
 the garden, according as the story runs.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5739-5826.) (38) The garden had around it no wall or fence
 except of air: yet, by a spell, the garden was on all sides so
 shut in by the air that nothing could enter there any more than
 if the garden were enclosed in iron, unless it flew in over the
 top.  And all through the summer and the winter, too, there were
 flowers and ripe fruits there; and the fruit was of such a nature
 that it could be eaten inside; the danger consisted in carrying
 it out; for whoever should wish to carry out a little would never
 be able to find the gate, and never could issue from the garden
 until he had restored the fruit to its place.  And there is no
 flying bird under heaven, pleasing to man, but it sings there to
 delight and to gladden him, and can be heard there in numbers of
 every kind.  And the earth, however far it stretch, bears no
 spice or root of use in making medicine, but it had been planted
 there, and was to be found in abundance.  Through a narrow
 entrance the people entered -- King Evrain and all the rest. 
 Erec went riding, lance in rest, into the middle of the garden,
 greatly delighting in the song of the birds which were singing
 there; they put him in mind of his Joy the thing he most was
 longing for.  But he saw a wondrous thing, which might arouse
 fear in the bravest warrior of all whom we know, be it Thiebaut
 the Esclavon, (39) or Ospinel, or Fernagu.  For before them, on
 sharpened stakes, there stood bright and shining helmets, and
 each one had beneath the rim a man's head.  But at the end there
 stood a stake where as yet there was nothing but a horn. (40)  He
 knows not what this signifies, yet draws not back a step for
 that; rather does he ask the King, who was beside him at the
 right, what this can be.  The King speaks and explains to him:
 "Friend," he says, "do you know the meaning of this thing that
 you see here?  You must be in great terror of it, if you care at
 all for your own body; for this single stake which stands apart,
 where you see this horn hung up, has been waiting a very long
 time, but we know not for whom, whether for you or someone else.
 Take care lest thy head be set up there; for such is the purpose
 of the stake.  I had warned you well of that before you came
 here.  I do not expect that you will escape hence, but that you
 will be killed and rent apart.  For this much we know, that the
 stake awaits your head.  And if it turns out that it be placed
 there, as the matter stands agreed, as soon as thy head is fixed
 upon it another stake will be set up beside it which will await
 the arrival of some one else -- I know not when or whom.  I will
 tell you nothing of the horn; but never has any one been able to
 blow it. (41)  However, he who shall succeed in blowing it his
 fame and honour will grow until it distance all those of his
 country, and he shall find such renown that all will come to do
 him honour, and will hold him to be the best of them all.  Now
 there is no more of this matter.  Have your men withdraw; for
 `the Joy' will soon arrive, and will make you sorry, I suspect."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 5827-6410.)  Meanwhile King Evrain leaves his side, and Erec
 stoops over before Enide, whose heart was in great distress,
 although she held her peace; for grief on lips is of no account
 unless it also touch the heart.  And he who well knew her heart,
 said to her: "Fair sister dear, gentle, loyal, and prudent lady,
 I am acquainted with your thoughts.  You are in fear, I see that
 well, and yet you do not know for what; but there is no reason
 for your dismay until you shall see that my shield is shattered
 and that my body is wounded, and until you see the meshes of my
 bright hauberk covered with blood, and my helmet broken and
 smashed, and me defeated and weary, so that I can no longer
 defend myself, but must beg and sue for mercy against my will;
 then you may lament, but now you have begun too soon.  Gentle
 lady, as yet you know not what this is to be; no more do I.  You
 are troubled without cause.  But know this truly: if there were
 in me only so much courage as your love inspires, truly I should
 not fear to face any man alive.  But I am foolish to vaunt
 myself; yet I say it not from any pride, but because I wish to
 comfort you.  So comfort yourself, and let it be!  I cannot
 longer tarry here, nor can you go along with me; for, as the King
 has ordered, I must not take you beyond this point."  Then he
 kisses her and commends her to God, and she him.  But she is much
 chagrined that she cannot follow and escort him, until she may
 learn and see what this adventure is to be, and how he will
 conduct himself.  But since she must stay behind and cannot
 follow him, she remains sorrowful and grieving.  And he went off
 alone down a path, without companion of any sort, until he came
 to a silver couch with a cover of gold-embroidered cloth, beneath
 the shade of a sycamore; and on the bed a maiden of comely body
 and lovely face, completely endowed with all beauty, was seated
 all alone.  I intended to say no more of her; but whoever could
 consider well all her attire and her beauty might well say that
 never did Lavinia of Laurentum, who was so fair and comely,
 possess the quarter of her beauty.  Erec draws near to her,
 wishing to see her more closely, and the onlookers go and sit
 down under the trees in the orchard.  Then behold, there comes a
 knight armed with vermilion arms, and he was wondrous tall; and
 if he were not so immeasurably tall, under the heavens there
 would be none fairer than he; but, as every one averred, he was a
 foot taller than any knight he knew.  Before Erec caught sight of
 him, he cried out: "Vassal, vassal!  You are mad, upon my life,
 thus to approach my damsel.  I should say you are not worthy to
 draw near her.  You will pay dearly for your presumption, by my
 head!  Stand back!"  And Erec stops and looks at him, and the
 other, too, stood still.  Neither made advance until Erec had
 replied all that he wished to say to him.  "Friend," he says,
 "one can speak folly as well as good sense.  Threaten as much as
 you please, and I will keep silence; for in threatening there is
 no sense.  Do you know why?  A man sometimes thinks he has won
 the game who afterward loses it.  So he is manifestly a fool who
 is too presumptuous and who threatens too much.  If there are
 some who flee there are plenty who chase, but I do not fear you
 so much that I am going to run away yet.  I am ready to make such
 defence, if there is any who wishes to offer me battle, that he
 will have to do his uttermost, or otherwise he cannot escape."
 "Nay," quoth he, "so help me God!  know that you shall have the
 battle, for I defy and challenge you."  And you may know, upon my
 word, that then the reins were not held in.  The lances they had
 were not light, but were big and square; nor were they planed
 smooth, but were rough and strong.  Upon the shields with mighty
 strength they smote each other with their sharp weapons, so that
 a fathom of each lance passes through the gleaming shields.  But
 neither touches the other's flesh, nor was either lance cracked;
 each one, as quickly as he could, draws back his lance, and both
 rushing together, return to the fray.  One against the other
 rides, and so fiercely they smite each other that both lances
 break and the horses fall beneath them.  But they, being seated
 on their steeds, sustain no harm; so they quickly rise, for they
 were strong and lithe.  They stand on foot in the middle of the
 garden, and straightway attack each other with their green swords
 of German steel, and deal great wicked blows upon their bright
 and gleaming helmets, so that they hew them into bits, and their
 eyes shoot out flame.  No greater efforts can be made than those
 they make in striving and toiling to injure and wound each other.
 Both fiercely smite with the gilded pommel and the cutting edge.
 Such havoc did they inflict upon each other's teeth, cheeks,
 nose, hands, arms, and the rest, upon temples, neck, and throat
 that their bones all ache.  They are very sore and very tired;
 yet they do not desist, but rather only strive the more.  Sweat,
 and the blood which flows down with it, dim their eves, so that
 they can hardly see a thing; and very often they missed their
 blows, like men who did not see to wield their swords upon each
 other.  They can scarcely harm each other now; yet, they do not
 desist at all from exercising all their strength.  Because their
 eyes are so blinded that they completely lose their sight, they
 let their shields fall to the ground, and seize each other
 angrily.  Each pulls and drags the other, so that they fall upon
 their knees.  Thus, long they fight until the hour of noon is
 past, and the big knight is so exhausted that his breath quite
 fails him.  Erec has him at his mercy, and pulls and drags so
 that he breaks all the lacing of his helmet, and forces him over
 at his feet.  He falls over upon his face against Erec's breast,
 and has not strength to rise again.  Though it distresses him, he
 has to say and own: "I cannot deny it, you have beaten me; but
 much it goes against my will.  And yet you may be of such degree
 and fame that only credit will redound to me; and insistently I
 would request, if it may be in any way, that I might know your
 name, and he thereby somewhat comforted.  If a better man has
 defeated me, I shall be glad, I promise you; but if it has so
 fallen out that a baser man than I has worsted me, then I must
 feel great grief indeed."  "Friend, dost thou wish to know my
 name?" says Erec; "Well, I shall tell thee ere I leave here; but
 it will be upon condition that thou tell me now why thou art in
 this garden.  Concerning that I will know all what is thy name
 and what the Joy; for I am very anxious to hear the truth from
 beginning to end of it."  "Sire," says he, "fearlessly I will
 tell you all you wish to know."  Erec no more withholds his name,
 but says: "Didst thou ever hear of King Lac and of his son Erec?"
 "Yea, sire, I knew him well; for I was at his father's court for
 many a day before I was knighted, and, if he had had his will, I
 should never have left him for anything."  "Then thou oughtest to
 know me well, if thou weft ever with me at the court of my
 father, the King."  "Then, upon my faith, it has turned out well.
 Now hear who has detained me so long in this garden.  I will tell
 the truth in accordance with your injunction, whatever it may
 cost me.  That damsel who yonder sits, loved me from childhood
 and I loved her.  It pleased us both, and our love grew and
 increased, until she asked a boon of me, but did not tell me what
 it was.  Who would deny his mistress aught?  There is no lover
 but would surely do all his sweet-heart's pleasure without
 default or guile, whenever he can in any way.  I agreed to her
 desire; but when I had agreed, she would have it, too, that I
 should swear.  I would have done more than that for her, but she
 took me at my word.  I made her a promise, without knowing what.
 Time passed until I was made a knight.  King Evrain, whose nephew
 I am, dubbed me a knight in the presence of many honourable men
 in this very garden where we are.  My lady, who is sitting there,
 at once recalled to me my word, and said that I had promised her
 that I would never go forth from here until there should come
 some knight who should conquer me by trial of arms.  It was right
 that I should remain, for rather than break my word, I should
 never have pledged it.  Since I knew the good there was in her, I
 could nor reveal or show to the one whom I hold most dear that in
 all this I was displeased; for if she had noticed it, she would
 have withdrawn her heart, and I would not have had it so for
 anything that might happen.  Thus my lady thought to detain me
 here for a long stay; she did not think that there would ever
 enter this garden any vassal who could conquer me.  In this way
 she intended to keep me absolutely shut up with her all the days
 of my life.  And I should have committed an offence if I had had
 resort to guile and not defeated all those against whom I could
 prevail; such escape would have been a shame.  And I dare to
 assure you that I have no friend so dear that I would have
 feigned at all in fighting with him.  Never did I weary of arms,
 nor did I ever refuse to fight.  You have surely seen the helmets
 of those whom I have defeated and put to death; but the guilt of
 it is not mine, when one considers it aright.  I could not help
 myself, unless I were willing to be false and recreant and
 disloyal.  Now I have told you the truth, and be assured that it
 is no small honour which you have gained.  You have given great
 joy to the court of my uncle and my friends; for now I shall be
 released from here; and because all those who are at the court
 will have joy of it, therefore those who awaited the joy called
 it `Joy of the Court'.  They have awaited it so long that now it
 will be granted them by you who have won it by your fight.  You
 have defeated and bewitched my prowess and my chivalry.  Now it
 is right that I tell you my name, if you would know it.  I am
 called Mabonagrain; but I am not remembered by that name in any
 land where I have been, save only in this region; for never, when
 I was a squire, did I tell or make known my name.  Sire, you knew
 the truth concerning all that you asked me.  But I must still
 tell you that there is in this garden a horn which I doubt not
 you have seen.  I cannot issue forth from here until you have
 blown the horn; but then you will have released me, and then the
 Joy will begin.  Whoever shall hear and give it heed no hindrance
 will detain him, when he shall hear the sound of the horn, from
 coming straight-way to the court.  Rise up, sire!  Go quickly
 now!  Go take the horn right joyfully; for you have no further
 cause to wait; so do that which you must do."  Now Erec rose, and
 the other rises with him, and both approach the horn.  Erec takes
 it and blows it, putting into it all his strength, so that the
 sound of it reaches far.  Greatly did Enide rejoice when she
 heard the note, and Guivret was greatly delighted too.  The King
 is glad, and so are his people; there is not one who is not well
 suited and pleased at this.  No one ceases or leaves off from
 making merry and from song.  Erec could boast that day, for never
 was such rejoicing made; it could not be described or related by
 mouth of man, but I will tell you the sum of it briefly and with
 few words.  The news spreads through the country that thus the
 affair has turned out.  Then there was no holding back from
 coming to the court.  All the people hasten thither in confusion,
 some on foot and some on horse, without waiting for each other.
 And those who were in the garden hastened to remove Erec's arms,
 and in emulation they all sang a song about the Joy; and the
 ladies made up a lay which they called `the Lay of Joy', (42) but
 the lay is not well known.  Erec was well sated with joy and well
 served to his heart's desire; but she who sat on the silver couch
 was not a bit pleased.  The joy which she saw was not at all to
 her taste.  But many people have to keep still and look on at
 what gives them pain.  Enide acted graciously; because she saw
 her sitting pensive, alone on the couch, she felt moved to go and
 speak with her and tell her about her affairs and about herself,
 and to strive, if possible, to make her tell in return about
 herself, if it did not cause her too great distress.  Enide
 thought to go alone, wishing to take no one with her, but some of
 the most noble and fairest dames and damsels followed her out of
 affection to bear her company, and also to comfort her to whom
 the joy brings great chagrin; for she assumed that now her lover
 would be no longer with her so much as he had been, inasmuch as
 he desired to leave the garden.  However disappointing it may be,
 no one can prevent his going away, for the hour and the time have
 come.  Therefore the tears ran down her face from her eyes.  Much
 more than I can say was she grieving and distressed; nevertheless
 she sat up straight.  But she does not care so much for any of
 those who try to comfort her that she ceases her moan.  Enide
 salutes her kindly; but for a while the other could not reply a
 word, being prevented by the sighs and sobs which torment and
 distress her.  Some time it was before the damsel returned her
 salutation, and when she had looked at her and examined her for a
 while, it seemed that she had seen and known her before.  But not
 being very certain of it, she was not slow to inquire from whence
 she was, of what country, and where her lord was born; she
 inquires who they both are.  Enide replies briefly and tells her
 the truth, saying: "I am the niece of the Count who holds sway
 over Lalut, the daughter of his own sister; at Lalut I was born
 and brought up."  The other cannot help smiling, without hearing
 more, for she is so delighted that she forgets her sorrow.  Her
 heart leaps with joy which she cannot conceal.  She runs and
 embraces Enide, saying: "I am your cousin!  This is the very
 truth, and you are my father's niece; for he and your father are
 brothers.  But I suspect that you do not know and have never
 heard how I came into this country.  The Count, your uncle, was
 at war, and to him there came to fight for pay knights of many
 lands.  Thus, fair cousin, it came about, that with these
 hireling knights there came one who was the nephew of the king of
 Brandigan.  He was with my father almost a year.  That was, I
 think, twelve years ago, and I was still but a little child.  He
 was very handsome and attractive.  There we had an understanding
 between us that pleased us both.  I never had any wish but his,
 until at last he began to love me and promised and swore to me
 that he would always be my lover, and that he would bring me
 here; that pleased us both alike.  He could not wait, and I was
 longing to come hither with him; so we both came away, and no one
 knew of it but ourselves.  In those days you and I were both
 young and little girls.  I have told you the truth; so now tell
 me in turn, as I have told you, all about your lover, and by what
 adventure he won you."  "Fair cousin, he married me in such a way
 that my father knew all about it, and my mother was greatly
 pleased.  All our relatives knew it and rejoiced over it, as they
 should do.  Even the Count was glad.  For he is so good a knight
 that better cannot be found, and he does not need to prove his
 honour and knighthood, and he is of very gentle birth: I do not
 think that any can be his equal.  He loves me much, and I love
 him more, and our love cannot be greater.  Never yet could I
 withhold my love from him, nor should I do so.  For is not my
 lord the son of a king?  For did he not take me when I was poor
 and naked?  Through him has such honour come to me that never was
 any such vouchsafed to a poor helpless girl.  And if it please
 you, I will tell you without lying how I came to be thus raised
 up; for never will I be slow to tell the story."  Then she told
 and related to her how Erec came to Lalut; for she had no desire
 to conceal it.  She told her the adventure word for word, without
 omission.  But I pass over it now, because he who tells a story
 twice makes his tale now tiresome.  While they were thus
 conversing, one lady slipped away alone, who sent and told it all
 to the gentlemen, in order to increase and heighten their
 pleasure too.  All those who heard it rejoiced at this news.  And
 when Mabonagrain knew it he was delighted for his sweetheart
 because now she was comforted.  And she who bore them quickly the
 news made them all happy in a short space.  Even the King was
 glad for it; although he was very happy before, yet now he is
 still happier, and shows Erec great honour.  Enide leads away her
 fair cousin, fairer than Helen, more graceful and charming.  Now
 Erec and Mabonagrain, Guivret and King Evrain, and all the others
 run to meet them and salute them and do them honour, for no one
 is grudging or holds back.  Mabonagrain makes much of Enide, and
 she of him.  Erec and Guivret, for their part, rejoice over the
 damsel as they all kiss and embrace each other.  They propose to
 return to the castle, for they have stayed too long in the
 garden.  They are all prepared to go out; so they sally forth
 joyfully, kissing each other on the way.  All go out after the
 King, but before they reached the castle, the nobles were
 assembled from all the country around, and all those who knew of
 the Joy, and who could do so, came hither.  Great was the
 gathering and the press.  Every one, high and low, rich and poor,
 strives to see Erec.  Each thrusts himself before the other, and
 they all salute him and bow before him, saying constantly: "May
 God save him through whom joy and gladness come to our court! 
 God save the most blessed man whom God has ever brought into
 being!"  Thus they bring him to the court, and strive to show
 their glee as their hearts dictate.  Breton zithers, harps, and
 viols sound, fiddles, psalteries, and other stringed instruments,
 and all kinds of music that one could name or mention.  But I
 wish to conclude the matter briefly without too long delay.  The
 King honours him to the extent of his power, as do all the others
 ungrudgingly.  There is no one who does not gladly offer to do
 his service.  Three whole days the Joy lasted, before Erec could
 get away.  On the fourth he would no longer tarry for any reason
 they could urge.  There was a great crowd to accompany him and a
 very great press when it came to taking leave.  If he had wished
 to reply to each one, he would not have been able in half a day
 to return the salutations individually.  The nobles he salutes
 and embraces; the others he commends to God in a word, and
 salutes them.  Enide, for her part, is not silent when she takes
 leave of the nobles.  She salutes them all by name, and they in
 turn do the like.  Before she goes, she kisses her cousin very
 tenderly and embraces her.  Then they go and the Joy is over.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 6411-6509.)  They go off and the others return.  Erec and
 Guivret do not tarry, but keep joyfully on their way, until they
 came in nine days to Robais, where they were told the King was.
 The day before he had been bled privately in his apartments; with
 him he had only five hundred nobles of his household.  Never
 before at any time was the King found so alone, and he was much
 distressed that he had no more numerous suite at his court.  At
 that time a messenger comes running, whom they had sent ahead to
 apprise the King of their approach.  This man came in before the
 assembly, found the King and all his people, and saluting him
 correctly, said: "I am a messenger of Erec and of Guivret the
 Little."  Then he told him how they were coming to see him at his
 court.  The King replies: "Let them be welcome, as valiant and
 gallant gentlemen!  Nowhere do I know of any better than they
 two.  By their presence my court will be much enhanced."  Then he
 sent for the Queen and told her the news.  The others have their
 horses saddled to go and meet the gentlemen.  In such haste are
 they to mount that they did not put on their spurs.  I ought to
 state briefly that the crowd of common people, including squires,
 cooks, and butlers, had already entered the town to prepare for
 the lodgings.  The main party came after, and had already drawn
 so near that they had entered the town.  Now the two parties have
 met each other, and salute and kiss each other.  They come to the
 lodgings and make themselves comfortable, removing their hose and
 making their toilet by donning their rich robes.  When they were
 completely decked out, they took their way to the court.  They
 come to court, where the King sees them, and the Queen, who is
 beside herself with impatience to see Erec and Enide.  The King
 makes them take seats beside him, kisses Erec and Guivret; about
 Enide's neck he throws his arms and kisses her repeatedly, in his
 great joy.  Nor is the Queen slow in embracing Erec and Enide.
 One might well rejoice to see her now so full of joy.  Every one
 enters with spirit into the merry-making.  Then the King causes
 silence to be made, and appeals to Erec and asks news of his
 adventures.  When the noise had ceased, Erec began his story,
 telling him of his adventures, without forgetting any detail.  Do
 you think now that I shall tell you what motive he had had in
 starting out?  Nay, for you know the whole truth about this and
 the rest, as I have revealed it to you.  To tell the story again
 would burden me; for the tale is not short, that any one should
 wish to begin it afresh and re-embelish it, as he told and
 related it: of the three knights whom he defeated, and then of
 the five, and then of the Count who strove to do him harm, and
 then of the two giants -- all in order, one after the other, he
 told him of his adventures up to the point where he met Count
 Oringle of Limors.  "Many a danger have you gone through, fair
 gentle friend," said the King to him; "now tarry in this country
 at my court, as you are wont to do."  "Sire, since you wish it, I
 shall remain very gladly three or four years entire.  But ask
 Guivret to remain here too a request in which I would fain join."
 The King prays him to remain, and he consents to stay.  So they
 both stay: the King kept them with him, and held them dear and
 honoured them.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 6510-6712.)  Erec stayed at court, together with Guivret and
 Enide, until the death of his father, the king, who was an old
 man and full of years.  The messengers then started out: the
 nobles who went to seek him, and who were the greatest men of the
 land, sought and searched for him until they found him at
 Tintagel three weeks before Christmas; they told him the truth
 what had happened to his old, white-haired father, and how he now
 was dead and gone.  This grieved Erec much more than he showed
 before the people.  But sorrow is not seemly in a king, nor does
 it become a king to mourn.  There at Tintagel where he was, he
 caused vigils for the dead and Masses to be sung; he promised and
 kept his promises, as he had vowed to the religious houses and
 churches; he did well all that he ought to do: he chose out more
 than one hundred and sixty-nine of the wretched poor, and clothed
 them all in new garments.  To the poor clerks and priors he gave,
 as was right, black copes and warm linings to wear beneath.  For
 God's sake he did great good to all: to those who were in need he
 distributed more than a barrel of small coins.  When he had
 shared his wealth, he then did a very wise thing in receiving his
 land from the King's hand; and then he begged the King to crown
 him at his court.  The King bade him quickly be prepared; for
 they shall both be crowned, he together with his wife, at the
 approaching Christmastide; and he added: "You must go hence to
 Nantes in Brittany; there you shall carry a royal ensign with
 crown on head and sceptre in hand; this gift and privilege I
 bestow upon you."  Erec thanked the King, and said that that was
 a noble gift.  At Christmas the King assembles all his nobles,
 summoning them individually and commanding them to come to
 Nantes.  He summoned them all, and none stayed behind.  Erec,
 too, sent word to many of his followers, and summoned them to
 come thither; but more came than he had bidden, to serve him and
 do him honour.  I cannot tell you or relate who each one was, and
 what his name; but whoever came or did not come, the father and
 mother of my lady Enide were not forgotten.  Her father was sent
 for first of all, and he came to court in handsome style, like a
 great lord and a chatelain.  There was no great crowd of
 chaplains or of silly, gaping yokels, but of excellent knights
 and of people well equipped.  Each day they made a long day's
 journey, and rode on each day with great joy and great display,
 until on Christmas eve they came to the city of Nantes.  They
 made no halt until they entered the great hall where the King and
 his courtiers were.  Erec and Enide see them, and you may know
 how glad they were.  To meet them they quickly make their way,
 and salute and embrace them, speaking to them tenderly and
 showing their delight as they should.  When they had rejoiced
 together, taking each other by the hand, they all four came
 before the King, saluting him and likewise the Queen, who was
 sitting by his side.  Taking his host by the hand, Erec said:
 "Sire, behold my good host, my kind friend, who did me such
 honour that he made me master in his own house.  Before he knew
 anything about me, he lodged me well and handsomely.  All that he
 had he made over to me, and even his daughter he bestowed upon
 me, without the advice or counsel of any one."  "And this lady
 with him," the King inquires, "who is she?"  Erec does not
 conceal the truth: "Sire," says he, "of this lady I may say that
 she is the mother of my wife."  "Is she her mother?"  "Yes,
 truly, sire."  "Certainly, I may then well say that fair and
 comely should be the flower born of so fair a stem, and better
 the fruit one picks; for sweet is the smell of what springs from
 good.  Fair is Enide and fair she should be in all reason and by
 right; for her mother is a very handsome lady, and her father is
 a goodly knight.  Nor does she in aught belie them; for she
 descends and inherits directly from them both in many respects."
 Then the King ceases and sits down, bidding them be seated too.
 They do not disobey his command, but straightway take seats.  Now
 is Enide filled with joy when she sees her father and mother, for
 a very long time had passed since she had seen them.  Her
 happiness now is greatly increased, for she was delighted and
 happy, and she showed it all she could, but she could not make
 such demonstration but that her joy was yet greater.  But I wish
 to say no more of that, for my heart draws me toward the court
 which was now assembled in force.  From many a different country
 there were counts and dukes and kings, Normans, Bretons. Scotch,
 and Irish: from England and Cornwall there was a very rich
 gathering of nobles; for from Wales to Anjou, in Maine and in
 Poitou, there was no knight of importance, nor lady of quality,
 but the best and the most elegant were at the court at Nantes, as
 the King had bidden them.  Now hear, if you will, the great joy
 and grandeur, the display and the wealth, that was exhibited at
 the court.  Before the hour of nones had sounded, King Arthur
 dubbed four hundred knights or more all sons of counts and of
 kings.  To each one he gave three horses and two pairs of suits,
 in order that his court may make a better showing.  Puissant and
 lavish was the King; for the mantles he bestowed were not of
 serge, nor of rabbit-skins, nor of cheap brown fur, but of heavy
 silk and ermine, of spotted fur and flowered silks, bordered with
 heavy and stiff gold braid.  Alexander, who conquered so much
 that he subdued the whole world, and who was so lavish and rich,
 compared with him was poor and mean.  Caesar, the Emperor of
 Rome, and all the kings whose names you hear in stories and in
 epic songs, did not distribute at any feast so much as Arthur
 gave on the day that he crowned Erec; nor would Caesar and
 Alexander dare to spend so much as he spent at the court.  The
 raiment was taken from the chests and spread about freely through
 the halls; one could take what he would, without restraint.  In
 the midst of the court, upon a rug, stood thirty bushels of
 bright sterlings; (43) for since the time of Merlin until that
 day sterlings had currency throughout Britain. There all helped
 themselves, each one carrying away that night all that he wanted
 to his lodging-place.  At nine o'clock on Christmas day, all came
 together again at court.  The great joy that is drawing near for
 him had completely filched Erec's heart away.  The tongue and the
 mouth of no man, however skilful, could describe the third, or
 the fourth, or the fifth part of the display which marked his
 coronation.  So it is a mad enterprise I undertake in wishing to
 attempt to describe it.  But since I must make the effort, come
 what may, I shall not fail to relate a part of it, as best I may.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 6713-6809.)  The King had two thrones of white ivory, well
 constructed and new, of one pattern and style.  He who made them
 beyond a doubt was a very skilled and cunning craftsman.  For so
 precisely did he make the two alike in height, in breadth, and in
 ornamentation, that you could nor look at them from every side to
 distinguish one from the other and find in one aught that was not
 in the other.  There was no part of wood, but all of gold and
 fine ivory.  Well were they carved with great skill, for the two
 corresponding sides of each bore the representation of a leopard,
 and the other two a dragon's shape.  A knight named Bruiant of
 the Isles had made a gift and present of them to King Arthur and
 the Queen.  King Arthur sat upon the one, and upon the other he
 made Erec sit, who was robed in watered silk.  As we read in the
 story, we find the description of the robe, and in order that no
 one may say that I lie, I quote as my authority Macrobius, (44)
 who devoted himself to the description of it.  Macrobius
 instructs me how to describe, according as I have found it in the
 book, the workmanship and the figures of the cloth.  Four fairies
 had made it with great skill and mastery. (45)  One represented
 there geometry, how it estimates and measures the extent of the
 heavens and the earth, so that nothing is lacking there; and then
 the depth and the height, and the width, and the length; then it
 estimates, besides, how broad and deep the sea is, and thus
 measures the whole world.  Such was the work of the first fairy. 
 And the second devoted her effort to the portrayal of arithmetic,
 and she strove hard to represent clearly how it wisely enumerates
 the days and the hours of time, and the water of the sea drop by
 drop, and then all the sand, and the stars one by one, knowing
 well how to tell the truth, and how many leaves there are in the
 woods: such is the skill of arithmetic that numbers have never
 deceived her, nor will she ever be in error when she wishes to
 apply her sense to them.  The third design was that of music,
 with which all merriment finds itself in accord, songs and
 harmonies, and sounds of string: of harp, of Breton violin, and
 of viol.  This piece of work was good and fine; for upon it were
 portrayed all the instruments and all the pastimes.  The fourth,
 who next performed her task, executed a most excellent work; for
 the best of the arts she there portrayed.  She undertook
 astronomy, which accomplishes so many marvels and draws
 inspiration from the stars, the moon, and the sun.  Nowhere else
 does it seek counsel concerning aught which it has to do.  They
 give it good and sure advice.  Concerning whatever inquiry it
 make of them, whether in the past or in the future, they give it
 information without falsehood and without deception.  This work
 was portrayed on the stuff of which Erec's robe was made, all
 worked and woven with thread of gold.  The fur lining that was
 sewed within, belonged to some strange beasts whose heads are all
 white, and whose necks are as black as mulberries, and which have
 red backs and green bellies, and dark blue tail.  These beasts
 live in India and they are called "barbiolets".  They eat nothing
 but spices, cinnamon, and fresh cloves.  What shall I tell you of
 the mantle?  It was very rich and fine and handsome; it had four
 stones in the tassels -- two chrysolites on one side, and two
 amethysts on the other, which were mounted in gold.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 6810-6946.)  As yet Enide had not come to the palace.  When
 the King sees that she delays, he bids Gawain go quickly to bring
 her and the Queen.  Gawain hastens and was not slow, and with him
 King Cadoalant and the generous King of Galloway.  Guivret the
 Little accompanies them, followed by Yder the son of Nut.  So
 many of the other nobles ran thither to escort the two ladies
 that they would have sufficed to overcome a host; for there were
 more than a thousand of them.  The Queen had made her best effort
 to adorn Enide.  Into the palace they brought her the courteous
 Gawain escorting her on one side, and on the other the generous
 King of Galloway, who loved her dearly on account of Erec who was
 his nephew.  When they came to the palace, King Arthur came
 quickly toward them, and courteously seated Enide beside Erec;
 for he wished to do her great honour.  Now he orders to be
 brought forth from his treasure two massive crowns of fine gold.
 As soon as he had spoken and given the command, without delay the
 crowns were brought before him, all sparkling with carbuncles, of
 which there were four in each.  The light of the moon is nothing
 compared with the light which the least of the carbuncles could
 shed.  Because of the radiance which they shed, all those who
 were in the palace were so dazzled that for a moment they could
 see nothing; and even the King was amazed, and yet filled with
 satisfaction, when he saw them to be so clear and bright.  He had
 one of them held by two damsels, and the other by two gentlemen.
 Then he bade the bishops and priors and the abbots of the Church
 step forward and anoint the new King, as the Christian practice
 is.  Now all the prelates, young and old, came forward; for at
 the court there were a great number of bishops and abbots.  The
 Bishop of Nantes himself, who was a very worthy and saintly man,
 anointed the new King in a very holy and becoming manner, and
 placed the crown upon his head.  King Arthur had a sceptre
 brought which was very fine.  Listen to the description of the
 sceptre, which was clearer than a pane of glass, all of one solid
 emerald, fully as large as your fist.  I dare to tell you in very
 truth that in all the world there is no manner of fish, or of
 wild behest, or of man, or of flying bird that was not worked and
 chiselled upon it with its proper figure.  The sceptre was handed
 to the King, who looked at it with amazement; then he put it
 without delay into King Erec's right hand; and now he was King as
 he ought to be.  Then he crowned Enide in turn.  Now the bells
 ring for Mass, and they go to the main church to hear the Mass
 and service; they go to pray at the cathedral.  You would have
 seen weeping with joy the father of Queen Enide and her mother,
 Carsenefide.  In truth this was her mother's name, and her
 father's name was Liconal.  Very happy were they both.  When they
 came to the cathedral, the procession came out from the church
 with relics and treasures to meet them.  Crosses and prayerbooks
 and censers and reliquaries, with all the holy relics, of which
 there were many in the church, were all brought out to meet them;
 nor was there any lack of chants made.  Never were seen so many
 kings, counts, dukes, and nobles together at a Mass, and the
 press was so great and thick that the church was completely
 filled.  No low-born man could enter there, but only ladies and
 knights.  Outside the door of the church a great number still
 remained, so many were there come together who could not get
 inside the church.  When they had heard all the Mass they
 returned to the palace.  It was all prepared and decorated:
 tables set and cloths spread five hundred tables and more were
 there; but I do not wish to make you believe a thing which does
 not seem true.  It would seem too great a lie were I to say that
 five hundred tables were set in rows in one palace, so I will not
 say it; rather were there five hails so filled with them that
 with great difficulty could one make his way among the tables. 
 At each table there was in truth a king or a duke or a count; and
 full a hundred knights were seated at each table.  A thousand
 knights served the bread, and a thousand served the wine, and a
 thousand the meat -- all of them dressed in fresh fur robes of
 ermine.  All are served with divers dishes.  Even if I did not
 see them, I might still be able to tell you about them; but I
 must attend to something else than to tell you what they had to
 eat.  They had enough, without wanting more; joyfully and
 liberally they were served to their heart's desire.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 6947-6958.)  When this celebration was concluded, the King
 dismissed the assemblage of kings, dukes, and counts, of which
 the number was immense, and of the other humble folk who had come
 to the festival.  He rewarded them liberally with horses, arms
 and silver, cloths and brocades of many kinds, because of his
 generosity, and because of Erec whom he loved so much.  Here the
 story ends at last.

 (33) There follows and excellent example of an old French lament
      for the dead.  Such a wail was known in old French as a
      "regret", a word which has lost its specific meaning in
      English.

 (34) Many examples will be met of women skilled in the practice
      of medicine and surgery.  On the subject, cf. A. Hertel,
      "Versauberte Oertlichkeiten und Gegenstande in der
      altfranzosschen Dichtung" (Hanover, 1908); Georg Manheimer,
      "Etwas liber die Aerzte im alten Frankreich" in "Romanische
      Forschungen", vi. 581-614.
 </p><p>
 (35) The reference here and in v.5891 is probably suggested by
      the "Roman d'Eneas", which tells the same story as Virgil's
      "Aeneid", in old French eight-syllable rhymed couplets, and
      which is dated by the most recent scholarship 1160 circ. 
      Cf. F.M. Warren in "Modern Philology", iii. 179-209; iii.
      513-539; iv. 655-675.  Also M. Wilmotte, "L'Evolution du
      roman francais aux environs de 1150" (Paris, 1903).  Scenes
      from classical and medieval romance were for a long time
      favourite subject of portrayal upon cloths and tapestries,
      as well as of illuminations for manuscripts.

 (36) Various conjectures have been advanced concerning the
      significance of this strange adventure and its mysterious
      name "La Joie de la cour".  It is a quite extraneous
      episode, and Tennyson in his artistic use of our hero and
      heroine in the Idyl of "Geraint and Enid" did well to omit
      it.  Chretien's explanation, a little farther on, of "La
      Joie de la cour" is lame and unsatisfactory, as if he
      himself did not understand the significance of the matter
      upon which he was working.  Cf. E. Philipot in "Romania",
      xxv. 258-294; K. Othmer, "Ueber das Verhaltnis Chrestiens
      Erec und Enide zu dem Mabinogion des rothen Buch von
      Hergest" (Bonn, 1889); G. Paris in "Romania", xx. 152 f.

 (39) Tiebaut li Esclavon, frequently mentioned in the epic poems,
      was a Saracen king, the first husband of Guibourne, who
      later married the Christian hero Guillaume d'Orange.  Opinel
      was also a Saracen, mentioned in "Gaufrey", p. 132, and the
      hero of a lost epic poem (see G. Paris, "Historie poetique
      de Charlemagne", p. 127).  Fernagu was another Saracen king,
      killed in a famous encounter by Roland, "Otinel", p. 9 (F.). 
      For further references to these characters, see E. Langlois,
      "Table des noms propres de toute nature compris dans les
      chansons de geste" (Paris, 1904).

      existed.  For a recent definition of "lai", se L. Foulet in

 (43) The sterling was the English silver penny, 240 of which
      equalled 1 Pound Sterling of silver of 5760 grains 925 fine. 
      It is early described as "denarius Angliae qui vocatur
      sterlingus" ("Ency. Brit").

 (44) Macrobus was a Neoplatonic philosopher and Latin grammarian
      of the early part of the 5th century A.D.  He is best known
      as the author of the "Saturnalia" and of a commentary upon
      Cicero's "Somnium Scipionis" in that author's "De
      republica".  It is this latter work that is probably in the
      mind of Chretien, as well as of Gower, who refers to him in
      his "Mirour l'omme", and of Jean de Meun, the author of the
      second part of the "Roman de la Rose".
