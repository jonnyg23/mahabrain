 <h2 align="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <br> 
 
 Chretien De Troyes has had the peculiar fortune of becoming the
 best known of the old French poets to students of mediaeval
 literature, and of remaining practically unknown to any one else.
 The acquaintance of students with the work of Chretien has been
 made possible in academic circles by the admirable critical
 editions of his romances undertaken and carried to completion
 during the past thirty years by Professor Wendelin Foerster of
 Bonn.  At the same time the want of public familiarity with
 Chretien's work is due to the almost complete lack of
 translations of his romances into the modern tongues.  The man
 who, so far as we know, first recounted the romantic adventures
 of Arthur's knights, Gawain. Yvain, Erec, Lancelot, and Perceval,
 has been forgotten; whereas posterity has been kinder to his
 debtors, Wolfram yon Eschenbach, Malory, Lord Tennyson, and
 Richard Wagner.  The present volume has grown out of the desire
 to place these romances of adventure before the reader of English
 in a prose version based directly upon the oldest form in which
 they exist.
 <p>
 Such extravagant claims for Chretien's art have been made in some
 quarters that one feels disinclined to give them even an echo
 here.  The modern reader may form his own estimate of the poet's
 art, and that estimate will probably not be high.  Monotony, lack
 of proportion, vain repetitions, insufficient motivation,
 wearisome subtleties, and threatened, if not actual, indelicacy
 are among the most salient defects which will arrest, and mayhap
 confound, the reader unfamiliar with mediaeval literary craft. 
 No greater service can be performed by an editor in such a case
 than to prepare the reader to overlook these common faults, and
 to set before him the literary significance of this twelfth-
 century poet.
 </p><p>
 Chretien de Troyes wrote in Champagne during the third quarter of
 the twelfth century.  Of his life we know neither the beginning
 nor the end, but we know that between 1160 and 1172 he lived,
 perhaps as herald-at-arms (according to Gaston Paris, based on
 "Lancelot" 5591-94) at Troyes, where was the court of his
 patroness, the Countess Marie de Champagne.  She was the daughter
 of Louis VII, and of that famous Eleanor of Aquitaine, as she is
 called in English histories, who, coming from the South of France
 in 1137, first to Paris and later to England, may have had some
 share in the introduction of those ideals of courtesy and woman
 service which were soon to become the cult of European society.
 The Countess Marie, possessing her royal mother's tastes and
 gifts, made of her court a social experiment station, where these
 Provencal ideals of a perfect society were planted afresh in
 congenial soil.  It appears from contemporary testimony that the
 authority of this celebrated feudal dame was weighty, and widely
 felt.  The old city of Troyes, where she held her court, must be
 set down large in any map of literary history.  For it was there
 that Chretien was led to write four romances which together form
 the most complete expression we possess from a single author of
 the ideals of French chivalry.  These romances, written in
 eight-syllable rhyming couplets, treat respectively of Erec and
 Enide, Cliges, Yvain, and Lancelot.  Another poem, "Perceval le
 Gallois", was composed about 1175 for Philip, Count of Flanders,
 to whom Chretien was attached during his last years.  This last
 poem is not included in the present translation because of its
 extraordinary length of 32,000 verses, because Chretien wrote
 only the first 9000 verses, and because Miss Jessie L. Weston has
 given us an English version of Wolfram's wellknown "Parzival",
 which tells substantially the same story, though in a different
 spirit.  To have included this poem, of which he wrote less than
 one-third, in the works of Chretien would have been unjust to
 him.  It is true the romance of "Lancelot" was not completed by
 Chretien, we are told, but the poem is his in such large part
 that one would be over-scrupulous not to call it his.  The other
 three poems mentioned are his entire.  In addition, there are
 quite generally assigned to the poet two insignificant lyrics,
 the pious romance of "Guillaume d'Angleterre", and the
 elaboration of an episode from Ovid's "Metamorphoses" (vi., 426-
 674) called "Philomena" by its recent editor (C. de Boer, Paris,
 1909).  All these are extant and accessible.  But since
 "Guillaume d'Angleterre" and "Philomena" are not universally
 attributed to Chretien, and since they have nothing to do with
 the Arthurian material, it seems reasonable to limit the present
 enterprise to "Erec and Enide", "Cliges", "Yvain", and
 "Lancelot".
 </p><p>
 Professor Foerster, basing his remark upon the best knowledge we
 possess of an obscure matter, has called "Erec and Enide" the
 oldest Arthurian romance extant.  It is not possible to dispute
 this significant claim, but let us make it a little more
 intelligible.  Scholarship has shown that from the early Middle
 Ages popular tradition was rife in Britain and Brittany.  The
 existence of these traditions common to the Brythonic peoples was
 called to the attention of the literary world by William of
 Malmesbury ("Gesta regum Anglorum") and Geoffrey of Monmouth
 ("Historia regum Britanniae") in their Latin histories about 1125
 and 1137 respectively, and by the Anglo-Norman poet Wace
 immediately afterward.  Scholars have waged war over the theories
 of transmission of the so-called Arthurian material during the
 centuries which elapsed between the time of the fabled
 chieftain's activity in 500 A.D. and his appearance as a great
 literary personage in the twelfth century.  Documents are lacking
 for the dark ages of popular tradition before the Norman
 Conquest, and the theorists may work their will.  But Arthur and
 his knights, as we see them in the earliest French romances, have
 little in common with their Celtic prototypes, as we dimly catch
 sight of them in Irish, Welsh, and Breton legend.  Chretien
 belonged to a generation of French poets who rook over a great
 mass of Celtic folk-lore they imperfectly understood, and made of
 what, of course, it had never been before: the vehicle to carry a
 rich freight of chivalric customs and ideals.  As an ideal of
 social conduct, the code of chivalry never touched the middle and
 lower classes, but it was the religion of the aristocracy and of
 the twelfth-century "honnete homme".  Never was literature in any
 age closer to the ideals of a social class.  So true is this that
 it is difficult to determine whether social practices called
 forth the literature, or whether, as in the case of the
 seventeenth-century pastoral romance in France, it is truer to
 say that literature suggested to society its ideals.  Be that as
 it may, it is proper to observe that the French romances of
 adventure portray late mediaeval aristocracy as it fain would be.
 For the glaring inconsistencies between the reality and the
 ideal, one may turn to the chronicles of the period.  Yet, even
 history tells of many an ugly sin rebuked and of many a gallant
 deed performed because of the courteous ideals of chivalry.  The
 debt of our own social code to this literature of courtesy and
 frequent self-sacrifice is perfectly manifest.
 </p><p>
 What Chretien's immediate and specific source was for his
 romances is of deep interest to the student.  Unfortunately, he
 has left us in doubt.  He speaks in the vaguest way of the
 materials he used.  There is no evidence that he had any Celtic
 written source.  We are thus thrown back upon Latin or French
 literary originals which are lost, or upon current continental
 lore going back to a Celtic source.  This very difficult problem
 is as yet unsolved in the case of Chretien, as it is in the case
 of the Anglo-Norman Beroul, who wrote of Tristan about 1150.  The
 material evidently was at hand and Chretien appropriated it,
 without much understanding of its primitive spirit, but
 appreciating it as a setting for the ideal society dreamed of but
 not realised in his own day.  Add to this literary perspicacity,
 a good foundation in classic fable, a modicum of ecclesiastical
 doctrine, a remarkable facility in phrase, figure, and rhyme and
 we have the foundations for Chretien's art as we shall find it
 upon closer examination.
 </p><p>
 A French narrative poet of the twelfth century had three
 categories of subject-matter from which to choose: legends
 connected with the history of France ("matiere de France"),
 legends connected with Arthur and other Celtic heroes ("matiere
 de Bretagne"), and stories culled from the history or mythology
 of Greece and Rome, current in Latin and French translations
 ("matiere de Rome le grand").  Chretien tells us in "Cliges" that
 his first essays as a poet were the translations into French of
 certain parts of Ovid's most popular works: the "Metamorphoses",
 the "Ars Amatoria", and perhaps the "Remedia Amoris".  But he
 appears early to have chosen as his special field the stories of
 Celtic origin dealing with Arthur, the Round Table, and other
 features of Celtic folk-lore.  Not only was he alive to the
 literary interest of this material when rationalised to suit the
 taste of French readers; his is further the credit of having
 given to somewhat crude folk-lore that polish and elegance which
 is peculiarly French, and which is inseparably associated with
 the Arthurtan legends in all modern literature.  Though Beroul,
 and perhaps other poets, had previously based romantic poems upon
 individual Celtic heroes like Tristan, nevertheless to Chretien,
 so far as we can see, is due the considerable honour of having
 constituted Arthur's court as a literary centre and rallying-
 point for an innumerable company of knights and ladies engaged in
 a never-ending series of amorous adventures and dangerous quests.
 Rather than unqualifiedly attribute to Chretien this important
 literary convention, one should bear in mind that all his poems
 imply familiarity on the part of his readers with the heroes of
 the court of which he speaks.  One would suppose that other
 stories, told before his versions, were current.  Some critics
 would go so far as to maintain that Chretien came toward the
 close, rather than at the beginning, of a school of French
 writers of Arthurian romances.  But, if so, we do not possess
 these earlier versions, and for lack of rivals Chretien may be
 hailed as an innovator in the current schools of poetry.
 </p><p>
 And now let us consider the faults which a modern reader will not
 be slow to detect in Chretien's style.  Most of his salient
 faults are common to all mediaeval narrative literature.  They
 may be ascribed to the extraordinary leisure of the class for
 whom it was composed -- a class which was always ready to read an
 old story told again, and which would tolerate any description,
 however detailed.  The pastimes of this class of readers were
 jousting, hunting, and making love.  Hence the preponderance of
 these matters in the literature of its leisure hours.  No detail
 of the joust or hunt was unfamiliar or unwelcome to these
 readers; no subtle arguments concerning the art of love were too
 abstruse to delight a generation steeped in amorous casuistry and
 allegories.  And if some scenes seem to us indelicate, yet after
 comparison with other authors of his times, Chretien must be let
 off with a light sentence.  It is certain he intended to avoid
 what was indecent, as did the writers of narrative poetry in
 general.  To appreciate fully the chaste treatment of Chretien
 one must know some other forms of mediaeval literature, such as
 the fabliaux, farces, and morality plays, in which courtesy
 imposed no restraint.  For our poet's lack of sense of
 proportion, and for his carelessness in the proper motivation of
 many episodes, no apology can be made.  He is not always guilty;
 some episodes betoken poetic mastery.  But a poet acquainted, as
 he was, with some first-class Latin poetry, and who had made a
 business of his art, ought to have handled his material more
 intelligently, even in the twelfth century.  The emphasis is not
 always laid with discrimination, nor is his yarn always kept free
 of tangles in the spinning.
 </p><p>
 Reference has been made to Chretien's use of his sources.  The
 tendency of some critics has been to minimise the French poet's
 originality by pointing out striking analogies in classic and
 Celtic fable.  Attention has been especially directed to the
 defence of the fountain and the service of a fairy mistress in
 "Yvain", to the captivity of Arthur's subjects in the kingdom of
 Gorre, as narrated in "Lancelot", reminding one so insistently of
 the treatment of the kingdom of Death from which some god or hero
 finally delivers those in durance, and to the feigned death of
 Fenice in "Cliges", with its many variants.  These episodes are
 but examples of parallels which will occur to the observant
 reader.  The difficult point to determine, in speaking of
 conceptions so widespread in classic and mediaeval literature, is
 the immediate source whence these conceptions reached Chretien.
 The list of works of reference appended to this volume will
 enable the student to go deeper into this much debated question,
 and will permit us to dispense with an examination of the
 arguments in this place.  However, such convincing parallels for
 many of Chretien's fairy and romantic episodes have been adduced
 by students of Irish and Welsh legend that one cannot fail to be
 impressed by the fact that Chretien was in touch, either by oral
 or literary tradition, with the populations of Britain and of
 Brittany, and that we have here his most immediate inspiration.
 Professor Foerster, stoutly opposing the so-called Anglo-Norman
 theory which supposes the existence of lost Anglo-Norman romances
 in French as the sources of Chretien de Troyes, is, nevertheless,
 well within the truth when he insists upon what is, so far as we
 are concerned, the essential originality of the French poet.  The
 general reader will to-day care as little as did the reader of
 the twelfth century how the poet came upon the motives and
 episodes of his stories, whether he borrowed them or invented
 them himself.  Any poet should be judged not as a "finder" but as
 a "user" of the common stock of ideas.  The study of sources of
 mediaeval poetry, which is being so doggedly carried on by
 scholars, may well throw light upon the main currents of literary
 tradition, but it casts no reflection, favourable or otherwise,
 upon the personal art of the poet in handling his stuff.  On that
 count he may plead his own cause before the jury.
 </p><p>
 Chretien's originality, then, consists in his portrayal of the
 social ideal of the French aristocracy in the twelfth century. 
 So far as we know he was the first to create in the vulgar
 tongues a vast court, where men and women lived in conformity
 with the rules of courtesy, where the truth was told, where
 generosity was open-handed, where the weak and the innocent were
 protected by men who dedicated themselves to the cult of honour
 and to the quest of a spotless reputation.  Honour and love
 combined to engage the attention of this society; these were its
 religion in a far more real sense than was that of the Church.
 Perfection was attainable under this code of ethics: Gawain, for
 example, was a perfect knight.  Though the ideals of this court
 and those of Christianity are in accord at many points, vet
 courtly love and Christian morality are irreconcilable.  This
 Arthurian material, as used by Chretien, is fundamentally immoral
 as judged by Christian standards.  Beyond question, the poets and
 the public alike knew this to be the case, and therein lay its
 charm for a society in which the actual relations of the sexes
 were rigidly prescribed by the Church and by feudal practice,
 rather than by the sentiments of the individuals concerned.  The
 passionate love of Tristan for Iseut, of Lancelot for Guinevere,
 of Cliges for Fenice, fascinate the conventional Christian
 society of the twelfth century and of the twentieth century
 alike, but there-is only one name among men for such relations as
 theirs, and neither righteousness nor reason lie that way.  Even
 Tennyson, in spite of all he has done to spiritualise this
 material, was compelled to portray the inevitable dissolution and
 ruin of Arthur's court.  Chretien well knew the difference
 between right and wrong, between reason and passion, as the
 reader of "Cliges" may learn for himself.  Fenice was not Iseut,
 and she would not have her Cliges to be a Tristan.  Infidelity,
 if you will, but not "menage a trois".  Both "Erec" and "Yvain"
 present a conventional morality.  But "Lancelot" is flagrantly
 immoral, and the poet is careful to state that for this
 particular romance he is indebted to his patroness Marie de
 Champagne.  He says it was she who furnished him with both the
 "matiere" and the "sens", the material of the story and its method
 of treatment.
 </p><p>
 Scholars have sought to fix the chronology of the poet's works,
 and have been tempted to speculate upon the evolution of his
 literary and moral ideas.  Professor Foerster's chronology is
 generally accepted, and there is little likelihood of his being
 in error when he supposes Chretien's work to have been done as
 follows: the lost "Tristan" (the existence of which is denied by
 Gaston Paris in "Journal des Savants", 1902, pp. 297 f.), "Erec
 and Enide", "Cliges", "Lancelot", "Yvain", "Perceval".  The
 arguments for this chronology, based upon external as well as
 internal criticism, may be found in the Introductions to
 Professor Foerster's recent editions.  When we speculate upon the
 development of Chretien's moral ideas we are not on such sure
 ground.  As we have seen, his standards vary widely in the
 different romances.  How much of this variation is due to chance
 circumstance imposed by the nature of his subject or by the taste
 of his public, and how much to changing conviction it is easy to
 see, when we consider some contemporary novelist, how dangerous
 it is to judge of moral convictions as reflected in literary
 work.  "Lancelot" must be the keystone of any theory constructed
 concerning the moral evolution of Chretien.  The following
 supposition is tenable, if the chronology of Foerster is correct.
 After the works of his youth, consisting of lyric poems and
 translations embodying the ideals of Ovid and of the school of
 contemporary troubadour poets, Chretien took up the Arthurian
 material and started upon a new course.  "Erec" is the oldest
 Arthurinn romance to have survived in any language, but it is
 almost certainly not the first to have been written.  It is a
 perfectly clean story: of love, estrangement, and reconciliation
 in the persons of Erec and his charming sweetheart Enide.  The
 psychological analysis of Erec's motives in the rude testing of
 Enide is worthy of attention, and is more subtle than anything
 previous in French literature with which we are acquainted.  The
 poem is an episodical romance in the biography of an Arthurinn
 hero, with the usual amount of space given to his adventures.
 "Cliges" apparently connects a Byzantine tale of doubtful origin
 in an arbitrary fashion with the court of Arthur.  It is thought
 that the story embodies the same motive as the widespread tale of
 the deception practised upon Solomon by his wife, and that
 Chretien's source, as he himself claims, was literary (cf. Gaston
 Paris in "Journal des Savants", 1902, pp. 641-655).  The scene
 where Fenice feigns death in order to rejoin her lover is a
 parallel of many others in literary history, and will, of course,
 suggest the situation in Romeo and Juliet.  This romance well
 illustrates the drawing power of Arthur's court as a literary
 centre, and its use as a rallying-point for courteous knights of
 whatever extraction.  The poem has been termed an "Anti-Tristan",
 because of its disparaging reference to the love of Tristan and
 Iseut, which, it is generally supposed, had been narrated by
 Chretien in his earlier years.  Next may come "Lancelot", with
 its significant dedication to the Countess of Champagne.  Of all
 the poet's work, this tale of the rescue of Guinevere by her
 lover seems to express most closely the ideals of Marie's court
 ideals in which devotion and courtesy but thinly disguise free
 love.  "Yvain" is a return to the poet's natural bent, in an
 episodical romance, while "Perceval" crowns his production with
 its pure and exalted note, though without a touch of that
 religious mysticism which later marked Wolfram yon Eschenbach's
 "Parzival".  "Guillaime d'Angleterre" is a pseudo-historical
 romance of adventure in which the worldly distresses and the
 final reward of piety are conventionally exposed.  It is
 uninspired, its place is difficult to determine, and its
 authorship is questioned by some.  It is aside from the Arthurian
 material, and there is no clue to its place in the evolution of
 Chretien's art, if indeed it be his work.
 </p><p>
 A few words must be devoted to Chretien's place in the history of
 mediaeval narrative poetry.  The heroic epic songs of France,
 devoted either to the conflict of Christendom under the
 leadership of France against the Saracens, or else to the strife
 and rivalry of French vassals among themselves, had been current
 for perhaps a century before our poet began to write.  These
 epic poems, of which some three score have survived, portray a
 warlike, virile, unsentimental feudal society, whose chief
 occupation was fighting, and whose dominant ideals were faith in
 God, loyalty to feudal family ties, and bravery in battle. 
 Woman's place is comparatively obscure, and of love-making there
 is little said.  It is a poetry of vigorous manhood, of
 uncompromising morality, and of hard knocks given and taken for
 God, for Christendom, and the King of France.  This poetry is
 written in ten- or twelve- syllable verses grouped, at first in
 assonanced, later in rhymed, "tirades" of unequal length.  It was
 intended for a society which was still homogeneous, and to it at
 the outset doubtless all classes of the population listened with
 equal interest.  As poetry it is monotonous, without sense of
 proportion, padded to facilitate memorisation by professional
 reciters, and unadorned by figure, fancy, or imagination.  Its
 pretention to historic accuracy begot prosaicness in its approach
 to the style of the chronicles.  But its inspiration was noble,
 its conception of human duties was lofty.  It gives a realistic
 portrayal of the age which produced it, the age of the first
 crusades, and to this day we would choose as our models of
 citizenship Roland and Oliver rather than Tristan and Lancelot.
 The epic poems, dealing with the pseudo-historical characters who
 had fought in civil and foreign wars under Charlemagne, remained
 the favourite literary pabulum of the middle classes until the
 close of the thirteenth century.  Professor Bedier is at present
 engaged in explaining the extraordinary hold which these poems
 had upon the public, and in proving that they exercised a
 distinct function when exploited by the Church throughout the
 period of the crusades to celebrate local shrines and to promote
 muscular Christianity.  But the refinement which began to
 penetrate the ideals of the French aristocracy about the middle
 of the twelfth century craved a different expression in narrative
 literature.  Greek and Roman mythology and history were seized
 upon with some effect to satisfy the new demand.  The "Roman de
 Thebes", the "Roman d'Alexandre", the "Roman de Troie", and its
 logical continuation, the "Roman d'Eneas", are all twelfth-
 century attempts to clothe classic legend in the dress of
 mediaeval chivalry.  But better fitted to satisfy the new demand
 was the discovery by the alert Anglo-Normans, perhaps in Brittany,
 perhaps in the South of England, of a vast body of legendary
 material which, so far as we know, had never before this century
 received any elaborate literary treatment.  The existence of the
 literary demand and this discovery of the material for its prompt
 satisfaction is one of the most remarkable coincidences in
 literary history.  It would seem that the pride of the Celtic
 populations in a Celtic hero, aided and abetted by Geoffrey of
 Monmouth, who first showed the romantic possibilities of the
 material, made of the obscure British chieftain Arthur a world
 conqueror.  Arthur thus became already in Geoffrey's "Historia
 regum Britaniae" a conscious protagonist of Charlemagne and his
 rival in popularity.  This grandiose conception of Arthur
 persisted in England, but this conception of the British
 chieftain did not interest the French.  For Chretien Arthur had
 no political significance.  He is simply the arbiter of his court
 in all affairs of justice and courtesy.  Charlemagne's very
 realistic entourage of virile and busy barons is replaced by a
 court of elegant chevaliers and unemployed ladies.  Charlemagne's
 setting is historical and geographical; Arthur's setting is ideal
 and in the air.  In the oldest epic poems we find only God-
 fearing men and a few self-effacing women; in the Arthurian
 romances we meet gentlemen and ladies, more elegant and seductive
 than any one in the epic poems, but less fortified by faith and
 sense of duty against vice because breathing an enervating
 atmosphere of leisure and decadent morally.  Though the Church
 made the attempt in "Parzival", it could never lay its hands so
 effectively upon this Celtic material, because it contained too
 many elements which were root and branch inconsistent with the
 essential teachings of Christianity.  A fleeting comparison of
 the noble end of Charlemagne's Peers fighting for their God and
 their King at Ronceval with the futile and dilettante careers of
 Arthur's knights in joust and hunt, will show better than mere
 words where the difference lies.
 </p><p>
 The student of the history of social and moral ideals will find
 much to interest him in Chretien's romances.  Mediaeval
 references show that he was held by his immediate successors, as
 he is held to-day when fairly viewed, to have been a master of
 the art of story-telling.  More than any other single narrative
 poet, he was taken as a model both in France and abroad.
 Professor F. M. Warren has set forth in detail the finer points
 in the art of poetry as practised by Chretien and his
 contemporary craftsmen (see "Some Features of Style in Early
 French Narrative Poetry, 1150-1170¯ in "Modern Philology", iii.,
 179-209; iii., 513-539; iv., 655-675). Poets in his own land
 refer to him with reverence, and foreign poets complimented him
 to a high degree by direct translation and by embroidering upon
 the themes which he had made popular.  The knights made famous by
 Chretien soon crossed the frontiers and obtained rights of
 citizenship in counties so diverse as Germany, England,
 Scandinavia, Holland, Italy, and to a lesser extent in Spain and
 Portugal.  The inevitable tendency of the fourteenth and
 fifteenth centuries to reduce poetry to prose affected the
 Arthurian material; vast prose compilations finally embodied in
 print the matter formerly expressed in verse, and it was in this
 form that the stories were known to later generations until
 revived interest in the Middle Ages brought to light the
 manuscripts in verse.
 </p><p>
 Aside from certain episodes of Chretien's romances, the student
 will be most interested in the treatment of love as therein
 portrayed.  On this topic we may hear speaking the man of his
 time. "Cliges" contains the body of Chretien's doctrine of love,
 while Lancelot is his most perfect lover.  His debt to Ovid has
 not yet been indicated with sufficient preciseness.  An elaborate
 code to govern sentiment and its expression was independently
 developed by the troubadours of Provence in the early twelfth
 century.  These Provencal ideals of the courtly life were carried
 into Northern France partly as the result of a royal marriage in
 1137 and of the crusade of 1147, and there by such poets as
 Chretien they were gathered up and fused with the Ovidian
 doctrine into a highly complicated but perfectly definite
 statement of the ideal relations of the sexes.  Nowhere in the
 vulgar tongues can a better statement of these relations be found
 than in "Cliges."
 </p><p>
 So we leave Chretien to speak across the ages for himself and his
 generation.  He is to be read as a story-teller rather than as a
 poet, as a casuist rather than as a philosopher.  But when all
 deductions are made, his significance as a literary artist and as
 the founder of a precious literary tradition distinguishes him
 from all other poets of the Latin races between the close of the
 Empire and the arrival of Dante.
