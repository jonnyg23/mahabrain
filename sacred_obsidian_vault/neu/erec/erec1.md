 EREC ET ENIDE (1)
 <p>
 (Vv. 1-26.)  The rustic's proverb says that many a thing is
 despised that is worth much more than is supposed.  Therefore he
 does well who makes the most of whatever intelligence he may
 possess.  For he who neglects this concern may likely omit to say
 something which would subsequently give great pleasure.  So
 Chretien de Troyes maintains that one ought always to study and
 strive to speak well and teach the right; and he derives from a
 story of adventure a pleasing argument whereby it may be proved
 and known that he is not wise who does not make liberal use of
 his knowledge so long as God may give him grace.  The story is
 about Erec the son of Lac -- a story which those who earn a
 living by telling stories are accustomed to mutilate and spoil in
 the presence of kings and counts.  And now I shall begin the tale
 which will be remembered so long as Christendom endures.  This is
 Chretien's boast.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 27-66.)  One Easter Day in the Springtime, King Arthur held
 court in his town of Cardigan.  Never was there seen so rich a
 court; for many a good knight was there, hardy, bold, and brave,
 and rich ladies and damsels, gentle and fair daughters of kings.
 But before the court was disbanded, the King told his knights
 that he wished to hunt the White Stag, (2) in order to observe
 worthily the ancient custom.  When my lord Gawain heard this, he
 was sore displeased. and said: "Sire, you will derive neither
 thanks nor goodwill from this hunt.  We all know long since what
 this custom of the White Stag is: whoever can kill the White Stag
 must forsooth kiss the fairest maiden of your court, come what
 may.  But of this there might come great ill, for there are here
 five hundred damsels of high birth, gentle and prudent daughters
 of kings, and there is none of them but has a bold and valiant
 knight for her lover who would be ready to contend, whether fight
 or wrong, that she who is his lady is the fairest and gentlest of
 them all."  The King replies: "That I know well; yet will I not
 desist on that account; for a king's word ought never to be
 gainsaid.  To-morrow morning we shall all gaily go to hunt the
 White Stag in the forest of adventure.  And very delightful this
 hunt will be."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 67-114.)  And so the affair is arranged for the next morning
 at daybreak.  The morrow, as soon as it is day, the King gets up
 and dresses, and dons a short jacket for his forest ride.  He
 commands the knights to be aroused and the horses to be made
 ready.  Already they are ahorse, and off they go, with bows and
 arrows.  After them the Queen mounts her horse, taking a damsel
 with her.  A maid she was, the daughter of a king, and she rode a
 white palfrey.  After them there swiftly followed a knight, named
 Erec, who belonged to the Round Table, and had great fame at the
 court. (3)  Of all the knights that ever were there, never one
 received such praise; and he was so fair that nowhere in the
 world need one seek a fairer knight than he.  He was very fair,
 brave, and courteous, though not yet twenty-five years old. 
 Never was there a man of his age of greater knighthood.  And what
 shall I say of his virtues?  Mounted on his horse, and clad in an
 ermine mantle, he came galloping down the road, wearing a coat of
 splendid flowered silk which was made at Constantinople.  He had
 put on hose of brocade, well made and cut, and when his golden
 spurs were well attached, he sat securely in his stirrups.  He
 carried no arm with him but his sword.  As he galloped along, at
 the corner of a street he came up with the Queen, and said: "My
 lady, if it please you, I should gladly accompany you along this
 road, having come for no other purpose than to bear you company."
 And the Queen thanks him: "Fair friend, I like your company well,
 in truth; for better I could not have."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 115-124.)  Then they ride along at full speed until they
 come into the forest, where the party who had gone before them
 had already started the stag.  Some wind the horns and others
 shout; the hounds plunge ahead after the stag, running,
 attacking, and baying; the bowmen shoot amain.  And before them
 all rode the King on a Spanish hunter.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 125-154.)  Queen Guinevere was in the wood listening for the
 dogs; beside her were Erec and the damsel, who was very courteous
 and fair.  But those who had pursued the stag were so far from
 them that, however intently they might listen to catch the sound
 of horn or baying of hound, they no longer could hear either
 horse, huntsman, or hound.  So all three of them drew rein in a
 clearing beside the road.  They had been there but a short time
 when they saw an armed knight along on his steed, with shield
 slung about his neck, and his lance in hand.  The Queen espied
 him from a distance By his right side rode a damsel of noble
 bearing, and before them, on a hack, came a dwarf carrying in his
 hand a knotted scourge.  When Queen Guinevere saw the comely and
 graceful knight, she desired to know who he and his damsel were.
 So she bid her damsel go quickly and speak to him,
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 155-274.)  "Damsel," says the Queen, "go and bid yonder
 knight come to me and bring his damsel with him."  The maiden
 goes on amble straight toward the knight.  But the spiteful dwarf
 sallies forth to meet her with his scourge in hand, crying:
 "Halt, maiden, what do you want here?  You shall advance no
 farther."  "Dwarf," says she, "let me pass.  I wish to speak with
 yonder knight; for the Queen sends me hither."  The dwarf, who
 was rude and mean, took his stand in the middle of the road. and
 said: "You have no business here.  Go back.  It is not meet that
 vou should speak to so excellent a knight."  The damsel advanced
 and tried to pass him by force, holding the dwarf in slight
 esteem when she saw that he was so small.  Then the dwarf raised
 his whip, when he saw her coming toward him and tried to strike
 her in the face.  She raised her arm to protect herself, but he
 lifted his hand again and struck her all unprotected on her bare
 hand: and so hard did he strike her on the back of her hand that
 it turned all black and blue.  When the maiden could do nothing
 else, in spite of herself she must needs return.  So weeping she
 turned back.  The tears came to her eyes and ran down her cheeks.
 When the Queen sees her damsel wounded, she is sorely grieved and
 angered and knows not what to do.  "Ah, Erec, fair friend," she
 says, "I am in great sorrow for my damsel whom that dwarf has
 wounded.  The knight must be discourteous indeed, to allow such a
 monster to strike so beautiful a creature.  Erec, fair friend, do
 you go to the knight and bid him come to me without delay.  I
 wish to know him and his lady."  Erec starts off thither, giving
 spurs to his steed, and rides straight toward the knight.  The
 ignoble dwarf sees him coming and goes to meet him.  "Vassal,"
 says he, "stand back!  For I know not what business you have
 here.  I advise you to withdraw."  "Avaunt," says Erec,
 "provoking dwarf!  Thou art vile and troublesome.  Let me pass."
 "You shall not."  "That will I."  "You shall not."  Erec thrusts
 the dwarf aside.  The dwarf had no equal for villainy: he gave
 him a great blow with his lash right on the neck, so that Erec's
 neck and face are scarred with the blow of the scourge; from top
 to bottom appear the lines which the thongs have raised on him.
 He knew well that he could not have the satisfaction of striking
 the dwarf; for he saw that the knight was armed, arrogant, and
 of evil intent, and he was afraid that he would soon kill him,
 should he strike the dwarf in his presence.  Rashness is not
 bravery.  So Erec acted wisely in retreating without more ado.
 "My lady," he says, "now matters stand worse; for the rascally
 dwarf has so wounded me that he has badly cut my face.  I did not
 dare to strike or touch him; but none ought to reproach me, for I
 was completely unarmed.  I mistrusted the armed knight, who,
 being an ugly fellow and violent, would take it as no jest, and
 would soon kill me in his pride.  But this much I will promise
 you; that if I can, I shall yet avenge my disgrace, or increase
 it.  But my arms are too far away to avail me in this time of
 need; for at Cardigan did I leave them this morning when I came
 away.  And if I should go to fetch them there, peradventure I
 should never again find the knight who is riding off apace.  So I
 must follow him at once, far or near, until I find some arms to
 hire or borrow.  If I find some one who will lend me arms, the
 knight will quickly find me ready for battle.  And you may be
 sure without fail that we two shall fight until he defeat me, or
 I him.  And if possible, I shall be back by the third day, when
 you will see me home again either joyous or sad, I know not
 which.  Lady, I cannot delay longer, for I must follow after the
 knight.  I go.  To God I commend you."  And the Queen in like
 manner more than five hundred rimes commends him to God, that he
 may defend him from harm.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 275-310.)  Erec leaves the Queen and ceases not to pursue
 the knight.  The Queen remains in the wood, where now the King
 had come up with the Stag.  The King himself outstripped the
 others at the death.  Thus they killed and took the White Stag,
 and all returned, carrying the Stag, till they came again to
 Cardigan.  After supper, when the knights were all in high
 spirits throughout the hall, the King, as the custom was, because
 he had taken the Stag, said that he would bestow the kiss and
 thus observe the custom of the Stag.  Throughout the court a
 great murmur is heard: each one vows and swears to his neighbour
 that it shall not be done without the protest of sword or ashen
 lance.  Each one gallantly desires to contend that his lady is
 the fairest in the hall.  Their conversation bodes no good, and
 when my lord Gawain heard it, you must know that it was not to
 his liking.  Thus he addressed the King: "Sire," he says, "your
 knights here are greatly aroused, and all their talk is of this
 kiss.  They say that it shall never be bestowed without
 disturbance and a fight."  And the King wisely replied to him:
 "Fair nephew Gawain, give me counsel now, sparing my honour and
 my dignity, for I have no mind for any disturbance."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 311-341.)  To the council came a great part of the best
 knights of the court.  King Yder (4) arrived, who was the first
 to be summoned, and after him King Cadoalant, who was very wise
 and bold.  Kay and Girflet came too, and King Amauguin was there,
 and a great number of other knights were there with them.  The
 discussion was in process when the Queen arrived and told them of
 the adventure which she had met in the forest, of the armed
 knight whom she saw, and of the malicious little dwarf who had
 struck her damsel on the bare hand with his whip, and who struck
 Erec, too, in the same way an ugly blow on the face; but that
 Erec followed the knight to obtain vengeance, or increase his
 shame, and how he said that if possible he would be back by the
 third day.  "Sire," says the Queen to the King, "listen to me a
 moment.  If these knights approve what I say, postpone this kiss
 until the third day, when Erec will be back."  There is none who
 does not agree with her, and the King himself approves her words.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 342-392.)  Erec steadily follows the knight who was armed
 and the dwarf who had struck him until they come to a well placed
 town, strong and fine (5).  They enter straight through the gate.
 Within the town there was great joy of knights and ladies, of
 whom there were many and fair.  Some were feeding in the streets
 their sparrow-hawks and moulting falcons; others were giving an
 airing to their tercels, (6) their mewed birds, and young yellow
 hawks; others play at dice or other game of chance, some at
 chess, and some at backgammon.  The grooms in front of the
 stables are rubbing down and currying the horses.  The ladies are
 bedecking themselves in their boudoirs.  As soon as they see the
 knight coming, whom they recognised with his dwarf and damsel,
 they go out three by three to meet him.  The knight they all
 greet and salute, but they give no heed to Erec, for they did not
 know him.  Erec follows close upon the knight through the town,
 until he saw him lodged.  Then, very joyful, he passed on a
 little farther until he saw reclining upon some steps a vavasor
 (7) well on in years.  He was a comely man, with white locks,
 debonair, pleasing, and frank.  There he was seated all alone,
 seeming to be engaged in thought.  Erec took him for an honest
 man who would at once give him lodging.  When he turned through
 the gate into the yard, the vavasor ran to meet him, and saluted
 him before Erec had said a word.  "Fair sir," says he, "be
 welcome.  If you will deign to lodge with me, here is my house
 all ready for you."  Erec replies: "Thank you!  For no other
 purpose have I come; I need a lodging place this night."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 393-410.)  Erec dismounts from his horse, which the host
 himself leads away by the bridle, and does great honour to his
 guest.  The vavasor summons his wife and his beautiful daughter,
 who were busy in a work-room -- doing I know not what.  The lady
 came out with her daughter, who was dressed in a soft white
 under-robe with wide skirts hanging loose in folds.  Over it she
 wore a white linen garment, which completed her attire.  And this
 garment was so old that it was full of holes down the sides.
 Poor, indeed, was her garb without, but within her body was fair.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 411-458.)  The maid was charming, in sooth, for Nature had
 used all her skill in forming her.  Nature herself had marvelled
 more than five hundred times how upon this one occasion she had
 succeeded in creating such a perfect thing.  Never again could
 she so strive successfully to reproduce her pattern.  Nature
 bears witness concerning her that never was so fair a creature
 seen in all the world.  In truth I say that never did Iseut the
 Fair have such radiant golden tresses that she could be compared
 with this maiden. (8)  The complexion of her forehead and face
 was clearer and more delicate than the lily.  But with wondrous
 art her face with all its delicate pallor was suffused with a
 fresh crimson which Nature had bestowed upon her.  Her eyes were
 so bright that they seemed like two stars.  God never formed
 better nose, mouth, and eyes.  What shall I say of her beauty? 
 In sooth, she was made to be looked at; for in her one could have
 seen himself as in a mirror.  So she came forth from the work-
 room: and when she saw the knight whom she had never seen before,
 she drew back a little, because she did not know him, and in her
 modesty she blushed.  Erec, for his part, was amazed when he
 beheld such beauty in her, and the vavasor said to her: "Fair
 daughter dear, take this horse and lead him to the stable along
 with my own horses.  See that he lack for nothing: take off his
 saddle and bridle, give him oats and hay, look after him and
 curry him, that he may be in good condition."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 459-546)  The maiden takes the horse, unlaces his breast-
 strap, and takes off his bridle and saddle.  Now the horse is in
 good hands, for she takes excellent care of him.  She throws a
 halter over his head, rubs him down, curries him, and makes him
 comfortable.  Then she ties him to the manger and puts plenty of
 fresh sweet hay and oats before him.  Then she went back to her
 father, who said to her: "Fair daughter dear, take now this
 gentleman by the hand and show him all honour.  Take him by the
 hand upstairs."  The maiden did not delay (for in her there was
 no lack of courtesy) and led him by the hand upstairs.  The lady
 had gone before and prepared the house.  She had laid embroidered
 cushions and spreads upon the couches, where they all three sat
 down Erec with his host beside him, and the maiden opposite.
 Before them, the fire burns brightly.  The vavasor had only one
 man-servant, and no maid for chamber or kitchen work.  This one
 man was busy in the kitchen preparing meat and birds for supper.
 A skilful cook was he, who knew how to prepare meal in boiling
 water and birds on the spit.  When he had the meal prepared in
 accordance with the orders which had been given him, he brought
 them water for washing in two basins.  The table was soon set,
 cloths, bread, and wine set out, and they sat down to supper.
 They had their fill of all they needed.  When they had finished
 and when the table was cleared, Erec thus addressed his host, the
 master of the house: "Tell me, fair host." he asked, "why your
 daughter, who is so passing fair and clever, is so poorly and
 unsuitably attired."  "Fair friend," the vavasor replies, "many a
 man is harmed by poverty, and even so am I.  I grieve to see her
 so poorly clad, and yet I cannot help it, for I have been so long
 involved in war that I have lost or mortgaged or sold all my
 land. (9)  And yet she would be well enough dressed if I allowed
 her to accept everything that people wish to give her.  The lord
 of this castle himself would have dressed her in becoming fashion
 and would have done her every manner of favour, for she is his
 niece and he is a count.  And there is no nobleman in this
 region, however rich and powerful, who would not willingly have
 taken her to wife had I given my consent.  But I am waiting yet
 for some better occasion, when God shall bestow still greater
 honour upon her, when fortune shall bring hither some king or
 count who shall lead her away, for there is under Heaven no king
 or count who would be ashamed of my daughter, who is so wondrous
 fair that her match cannot be found.  Fair, indeed, she is; but
 yet greater far than her beauty, is her intelligence.  God never
 created any one so discreet and of such open heart.  When I have
 my daughter beside me, I don't care a marble about all the rest
 of the world.  She is my delight and my pastime, she is my joy
 and comfort, my wealth and my treasure, and I love nothing so
 much as her own precious self."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 547-690.)  When Erec had listened to all that his host told
 him, he asked him to inform him whence came all the chivalry that
 was quartered in the town.  For there was no street or house so
 poor and small but it was full of knights and ladies and squires.
 And the vavasor said to him: "Fair friend, these are the nobles
 of the country round; all, both young and old, have come to a
 fete which is to be held in this town tomorrow; therefore the
 houses are so full.  When they shall all have gathered, there
 will be a great stir to-morrow; for in the presence of all the
 people there will be set upon a silver perch a sparrow-hawk of
 five or six moultings -- the best you can imagine.  Whoever
 wishes to gain the hawk must have a mistress who is fair,
 prudent, and courteous.  And if there be a knight so bold as to
 wish to defend the worth and the name of the fairest in his eyes,
 he will cause his mistress to step forward and lift the hawk from
 the perch, if no one dares to interpose.  This is the custom they
 are observing, and for this each year they gather here."
 Thereupon Erec speaks and asks him: "Fair host, may it not
 displease you, but tell me, if you know, who is a certain knight
 bearing arms of azure and gold, who passed by here not long ago,
 having close beside him a courtly damsel, preceded by a hump-
 backed dwarf."  To him the host then made reply: "That is he who
 will win the hawk without any opposition from the other knights.
 I don't believe that any one will offer opposition; this time
 there will be no blows or wounds.  For two years already he has
 won it without being challenged; and if he wins it again this
 year, he will have gained permanent possession of it.  Every
 succeeding year he may keep it without contest or challenge."
 Quickly Erec makes reply: "I do not like that knight.  Upon my
 word, had I some arms I should challenge him for the hawk.  Fair
 host, I beg you as a boon to advise me how I may be equipped with
 arms whether old or new, poor or rich, it matters not."  And he
 replies to him generously: "It were a pity for you to feel
 concern on that score!  I have good fine arms which I shall be
 glad to lend you.  In the house I have a triple-woven hauberk,
 (10) which was selected from among five hundred.  And I have some
 fine valuable greaves, polished, handsome, and light in weight. 
 The helmet is bright and handsome, and the shield fresh and new.
 Horse, sword, and lance all I will lend you, of course; so let no
 more be said."  "Thank you kindly, fair gentle host!  But I wish
 for no better sword that this one which I have brought with me,
 nor for any other horse than my own, for I can get along well
 enough with him.  If you will lend me the rest, I shall esteem it
 a great favour.  But there is one more boon I wish to ask of you,
 for which I shall make just return if God grant that I come off
 from the battle with honour."  And frankly he replies to him:
 "Ask confidently for what you want, whatever it be, for nothing
 of mine shall lack you."  Then Erec said that he wished to defend
 the hawk on behalf of his daughter; for surely there will be no
 damsel who is one hundredth part as beautiful as she.  And if he
 takes her with him, he will have good and just reason to maintain
 and to prove that she is entitled to carry away the hawk.  Then
 he added: "Sire, you know not what guest you have sheltered here,
 nor do you know my estate and kin.  I am the son of a rich and
 puissant king: my father's name is King Lac, and the Bretons call
 me Erec.  I belong to King Arthur's court, and have been with him
 now three years.  I know not if any report of my father or of me
 has ever reached this land.  But I promise you and vow that if
 you will fit me out with arms, and will give me your daughter
 to-morrow when I strive for the hawk, I will take her to my
 country, if God grant me the victory, and I will give her a crown
 to wear, and she shall be queen of three cities."  "Ah, fair sir!
 Is it true that you are Erec, the son of Lac?"  "That is who I
 am, indeed" quoth he.  Then the host was greatly delighted and
 said: "We have indeed heard of you in this country.  Now I think
 all the more of you, for you are very valiant and brave.  Nothing
 now shall you be refused by me.  At your request I give you my
 fair daughter."  Then taking her by the hand, he says: "Here, I
 give her to you."  Erec received her joyfully, and now has all he
 desired.  Now they are all happy there: the father is greatly
 delighted, and the mother weeps for joy.  The maiden sat quiet;
 but she was very happy and glad that she was betrothed to him,
 because he was valiant and courteous: and she knew that he would
 some day be king, and she should receive honour and be crowned
 rich queen.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 691-746.)  They had sat up very late that night.  But now
 the beds were prepared with white sheets and soft pillows, and
 when the conversation flagged they all went to bed in happy
 frame.  Erec slept little that night, and the next morn, at crack
 of dawn, he and his host rose early.  They both go to pray at
 church, and hear a hermit chant the Mass of the Holy Spirit, not
 forgetting to make an offering.  When they had heard Mass both
 kneel before the altar and then return to the house.  Erec was
 eager for the battle; so he asks for arms, and they are given to
 him.  The maiden herself puts on his arms (though she casts no
 spell or charm), (11) laces on his iron greaves, and makes them
 fast with thong of deer-hide.  She puts on his hauberk with its
 strong meshes, and laces on his ventail.  The gleaming helmet she
 sets upon his head, and thus arms him well from tip to toe.  At
 his side she fastens his sword, and then orders his horse to be
 brought, which is done.  Up he jumped clear of the ground.  The
 damsel then brings the shield and the strong lance: she hands him
 the shield, and he takes it and hangs it about his neck by the
 strap.  She places the lance in his hand, and when he had grasped
 it by the butt-end, he thus addressed the gentle vavasor: "Fair
 sire," quoth he, "if you please, make your daughter ready now;
 for I wish to escort her to the sparrow-hawk in accordance with
 our agreement."  The vavasor then without delay had saddled a bay
 palfrey.  There can nothing be said of the harness because of the
 dire poverty with which the vavasor was afflicted.  Saddle and
 bridle were put on, and up the maiden mounted all free and in
 light attire, without waiting to be urged.  Erec wished to delay
 no longer; so off he starts with the host's daughter by his side,
 followed by the gentleman and his lady.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 747-862.)  Erec rides with lance erect and with the comely
 damsel by his side.  All the people, great and small, gaze at
 them with wondering eyes as they pass through the streets.  And
 thus they question each other: "Who is yonder knight?  He must be
 doughty and brave, indeed, to act as escort for this fair maid.
 His efforts will be well employed in proving that this damsel is
 the fairest of them all."  One man to another says: "In very
 truth, she ought to have the sparrow-hawk."  Some praised the
 maid, while many said: "God!  who can this knight be, with the
 fair damsel by his side?"  "I know not."  "Nor I."  Thus spake
 each one.  "But his gleaming helmet becomes him well, and the
 hauberk, and shield, and his sharp steel sword.  He sits well
 upon his steed and has the bearing of a valiant vassal, well-
 shapen in arm, in limb and foot."  While all thus stand and gaze
 at them, they for their part made no delay to take their stand by
 the sparrow-hawk, where to one side they awaited the knight.  And
 now behold!  they see him come, attended by his dwarf and his
 damsel.  He had heard the report, that a knight had come who
 wished to obtain the sparrow-hawk, but he did not believe there
 could be in the world a knight so bold as to dare to fight with
 him.  He would quickly defeat him and lay him low.  All the
 people knew him well, and all welcome him and escort him in a
 noisy crowd: knights, squires, ladies, and damsels make haste to
 run after him.  Leading them all the knight rides proudly on,
 with his damsel and his dwarf at his side, and he makes his way
 quickly to the sparrow-hawk.  But all about there was such a
 press of the rough and vulgar crowd that it was impossible to
 touch the hawk or to come near where it was.  Then the Count
 arrived on the scene, and threatened the populace with a switch
 which he held in his hand.  The crowd drew back, and the knight
 advanced and said quietly to his lady: "My lady, this bird, which
 is so perfectly moulted and so fair, should be yours as your just
 portion; for you are wondrous fair and full of charm.  Yours it
 shall surely be so long as I live.  Step forward, my dear, and
 lift the hawk from the perch."  The damsel was on the point of
 stretching forth her hand when Erec hastened to challenge her,
 little heeding the other's arrogance.  "Damsel," he cries, "stand
 back!  Go dally with some other bird, for to this one you have no
 right.  In spite of all, I say this hawk shall never be yours.
 For a better one than you claims it -- aye, much more fair and
 more courteous."  The other knight is very wroth; but Erec does
 not mind him, and bids his own maiden step forward.  "Fair one."
 he cries, "come forth.  Lift the bird from the perch, for it is
 right that you should have it.  Damsel, come forth!  For I will
 make boast to defend it if any one is so bold as to intervene.
 For no woman excels you in beauty or worth, in grace or honour
 any more than the moon outshines the sun."  The other could
 suffer it no longer, when he hears him so manfully offer himself
 to do battle.  "Vassal," he cries, "who art thou who dost thus
 dispute with me the hawk?"  Erec boldly answers him: "A knight I
 am from another land.  This hawk I have come to obtain; for it is
 right, I say it in spite of all, that this damsel of mine should
 have it."  "Away!" cries the other, "it shall never be.  Madness
 has brought thee here.  If thou dost wish to have the hawk, thou
 shalt pay fight dearly for it."  "Pay, vassal; and how?"  "Thou
 must fight with me, if thou dost not resign it to me."  "You talk
 madness," cries Erec; "for me these are idle threats; for little
 enough do I fear you."  "Then I defy thee here and now.  The
 battle is inevitable."  Erec replies: "God help me now; for never
 did I wish for aught so much."  Now soon you will hear the noise
 of battle.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 863-1080.)  The large place was cleared, with the people
 gathered all around.  They draw off from each other the space of
 an acre, then drive their horses together; they reach for each
 other with the tips of their lances, and strike each other so
 hard that the shields are pierced and broken; the lances split
 and crack; the saddle-bows are knocked to bits behind.  They must
 needs lose their stirrups, so that they both fall to the ground,
 and the horses run off across the field.  Though smitten with the
 lances, they are quickly on their feet again, and draw their
 swords from the scabbards.  With great fierceness they attack
 each other, and exchange great sword blows, so that the helmets
 are crushed and made to ring.  Fierce is the clash of the swords,
 as they rain great blows upon neck and shoulders.  For this is no
 mere sport: they break whatever they touch, cutting the shields
 and shattering the hauberks.  The swords are red with crimson
 blood.  Long the battle lasts; but they fight so lustily that
 they become weary and listless.  Both the damsels are in tears,
 and each knight sees his lady weep and raise her hands to God and
 pray that He may give the honours of the battle to the one who
 strives for her.  "Ha!  vassal," quoth the knight to Erec, "let
 us withdraw and rest a little; for too weak are these blows we
 deal.  We must deal better blows than these; for now it draws
 near evening.  It is shameful and highly discreditable that this
 battle should last so long.  See yonder that gentle maid who
 weeps for thee and calls on God.  Full sweetly she prays for
 thee, as does also mine for me.  Surely we should do our best
 with our blades of steel for the sake of our lady-loves."  Erec
 replies: "You have spoken well."  Then they take a little rest,
 Erec looking toward his lady as she softly prays for him.  While
 he sat and looked on her, great strength was recruited within
 him.  Her love and beauty inspired him with great boldness.  He
 remembered the Queen, to whom he pledged his word that he would
 avenge the insult done him, or would make it greater yet.  "Ah!
 wretch," says he, "why do I wait?  I have not yet taken vengeance
 for the injury which this vassal permitted when his dwarf struck
 me in the wood."  His anger is revived within him as he summons
 the knight: "Vassal," quoth he, "I call you to battle anew.  Too
 long we have rested; let us now renew our strife."  And he
 replies: "That is no hardship , to me."  Whereupon, they again
 fall upon each other.  They were both expert fencers.  At his
 first lunge the knight would have wounded Erec had he not
 skilfully parried.  Even so, he smote him so hard over the shield
 beside his temple that he struck a piece from his helmet. 
 Closely shaving his white coif, the sword descends, cleaving the
 shield through to the buckle, and cutting more than a span from
 the side of his hauberk.  Then he must have been well stunned, as
 the cold steel penetrated to the flesh on his thigh.  May God
 protect him now!  If the blow had not glanced off, it would have
 cut right through his body.  But Erec is in no wise dismayed: he
 pays him back what is owing him, and. attacking him boldly,
 smites him upon the shoulder so violently a blow that the shield
 cannot withstand it, nor is the hauberk of any use to prevent the
 sword from penetrating to the bone.  He made the crimson blood
 flow down to his waist-band.  Both of the vassals are hard
 fighters: they fight with honours even, for one cannot gain from
 the other a single foot of ground.  Their hauberks are so torn
 and their shields so hacked, that there is actually not enough of
 them left to serve as a protection.  So they fight all exposed.
 Each one loses a deal of blood, and both grow weak.  He strikes
 Erec and Erec strikes him.  Erec deals him such a tremendous blow
 upon the helmet that he quite stuns him.  Then he lets him have
 it again and again, giving him three blows in quick succession,
 which entirely split the helmet and cut the coif beneath it.  The
 sword even reaches the skull and cuts a bone of his head, but
 without penetrating the brain.  He stumbles and totters, and
 while he staggers, Erec pushes him over, so that he falls upon
 his right side.  Erec grabs him by the helmet and forcibly drags
 it from his head, and unlaces the ventail, so that his head and
 face are completely exposed.  When Erec thinks of the insult done
 him by the dwarf in the wood, he would have cut off his head, had
 he not cried for mercy.  "Ah! vassal," says he, "thou hast
 defeated me.  Mercy now, and do not kill me, after having
 overcome me and taken me prisoner: that would never bring thee
 praise or glory.  If thou shouldst touch me more, thou wouldst do
 great villainy.  Take here my sword; I yield it thee." Erec,
 however, does not take it, but says in reply: "I am within an ace
 of killing thee."  "Ah!  gentle knight, mercy!  For what crime,
 indeed, or for what wrong shouldst thou hate me with mortal
 hatred?  I never saw thee before that I am aware, and never have
 I been engaged in doing thee any shame or wrong."  Erec replies:
 "Indeed you have."  "Ah, sire, tell me when!  For I never saw
 you, that I can remember, and if I have done you any wrong, I
 place myself at your mercy."  Then Erec said: "Vassal, I am he
 who was in the forest yesterday with Queen Guinevere, when thou
 didst allow thy ill-bred dwarf to strike my lady's damsel.  It is
 disgraceful to strike a woman.  And afterwards he struck me,
 taking me for some common fellow.  Thou wast guilty of too great
 insolence when thou sawest such an outrage and didst complacently
 permit such a monster of a lout to strike the damsel and myself.
 For such a crime I may well hate thee; for thou hast committed a
 grave offence.  Thou shalt now constitute thyself my prisoner,
 and without delay go straight to my lady whom thou wilt surely
 find at Cardigan, if thither thou takest thy way.  Thou wilt
 reach there this very night, for it is not seven leagues from
 here, I think.  Thou shalt hand over to her thyself, thy damsel,
 and thy dwarf, to do as she may dictate; and tell her that I send
 her word that to-morrow I shall come contented, bringing with me
 a damsel so fair and wise and fine that in all the world she has
 not her match.  So much thou mayst tell her truthfully.  And now
 I wish to know thy name."  Then he must needs say in spite of
 himself: "Sire, my name is Yder, son of Nut.  This morning I had
 not thought that any single man by force of arms could conquer
 me.  Now I have found by experience a man who is better than I.
 You are a very valiant knight, and I pledge you my faith here and
 now that I will go without delay and put myself in the Queen's
 hands.  But tell me without reserve what your name may be.  Who
 shall I say it is that sends me?  For I am ready to start."  And
 he replies: "My name I will tell thee without disguise: it is
 Erec.  Go, and tell her that it is I who have sent thee to her."
 "Now I'll go, and I promise you that I will put my dwarf, my
 damsel, and myself altogether at her disposal (you need have no
 fear), and I will give her news of you and of your damsel."  Then
 Erec received his plighted word, and the Count and all the people
 round about the ladies and the gentlemen were present at the
 agreement.  Some were joyous, and some downcast; some were sorry,
 and others glad.  The most rejoiced for the sake of the damsel
 with the white raiment, the daughter of the poor vavasor she of
 the gentle and open heart; but his damsel and those who were
 devoted to him were sorry for Yder.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1081-1170.)  Yder, compelled to execute his promise, did not
 wish to tarry longer, but mounted his steed at once.  But why
 should I make a long story?  Taking his dwarf and his damsel,
 they traversed the woods and the plain, going on straight until
 they came to Cardigan.  In the bower (12) outside the great hall,
 Gawain and Kay the seneschal and a great number of other lords
 were gathered.  The seneschal was the first to espy those
 approaching, and said to my lord Gawain: "Sire, my heart divines
 that the vassal who yonder comes is he of whom the Queen spoke as
 having yesterday done her such an insult.  If I am not mistaken,
 there are three in the party, for I see the dwarf and the
 damsel."  "That is so," says my lord Gawain; "it is surely a
 damsel and a dwarf who are coming straight toward us with the
 knight.  The knight himself is fully armed, but his shield is not
 whole.  If the Queen should see him, she would know him.  Hello,
 seneschal, go call her now!"  So he went straightway and found
 her in one of the apartments.  "My lady," says he, "do you
 remember the dwarf who yesterday angered you by wounding your
 damsel?"  "Yes, I remember him right well.  Seneschal, have you
 any news oú him?  Why have you mentioned him?"  "Lady, because I
 have seen a knight-errant armed coming upon a grey horse, and if
 my eyes have not deceived me, I saw a damsel with him; and it
 seems to me that with him comes the dwarf, who still holds the
 scourge from which Erec received his lashing."  Then the Queen
 rose quickly and said: "Let us go quickly, seneschal, to see if
 it is the vassal.  If it is he, you may be sure that I shall tell
 you so, as soon as I see him."  And Kay said: "I will show him to
 you.  Come up into the bower where your knights are assembled. 
 It was from there we saw him coming, and my lord Gawain himself
 awaits you there.  My lady, let us hasten thither, for here we
 have too long delayed."  Then the Queen bestirred herself, and
 coming to the windows she took her stand by my lord Gawain, and
 straightway recognised the knight.  "Ha! my lords," she cries,
 "it is he.  He has been through great danger.  He has been in a
 battle.  I do not know whether Erec has avenged his grief, or
 whether this knight has defeated Erec.  But there is many a dent
 upon his shield, and his hauberk is covered with blood, so that
 it is rather red than white."  "In sooth, my lady," quoth my lord
 Gawain, "I am very sure that you are quite right.  His hauberk is
 covered with blood, and pounded and beaten, showing plainly that
 he has been in a fight.  We can easily see that the battle has
 been hot.  Now we shall soon hear from him news that will give us
 joy or gloom: whether Erec sends him to you here as a prisoner at
 your discretion, or whether he comes in pride of heart to boast
 before us arrogantly that he has defeated or killed Erec.  No
 other news can he bring, I think."  The Queen says: "I am of the
 same opinion."  And all the others say: "It may well be so."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1171-1243.)  Meanwhile Yder enters the castle gate, bringing
 them news.  They all came down from the bower, and went to meet
 him.  Yder came up to the royal terrace and there dismounted from
 his horse.  And Gawain took the damsel and helped her down from
 her palfrey; the dwarf, for his part, dismounted too.  There were
 more than one hundred knights standing there, and when the three
 newcomers had all dismounted they were led into the King's
 presence.  As soon as Yder saw the Queen, he bowed low and first
 saluted her, then the King and his knights, and said: "Lady, I am
 sent here as your prisoner by a gentleman, a valiant and noble
 knight, whose face yesterday my dwarf made smart with his knotted
 scourge.  He has overcome me at arms and defeated me.  Lady, the
 dwarf I bring you here: he has come to surrender to you at
 discretion.  I bring you myself, my damsel, and my dwarf to do
 with us as you please."  The Queen keeps her peace no longer, but
 asks him for news of Erec: "Tell me," she says, "if you please,
 do you know when Erec will arrive?"  "To-morrow, lady, and with
 him a damsel he will bring, the fairest of all I ever knew." 
 When he had delivered his message, the Queen, who was kind and
 sensible, said to him courteously: "Friend, since thou hast
 thrown thyself upon my mercy, thy confinement shall be less
 harsh; for I have no desire to seek thy harm.  But tell me now,
 so help thee God, what is thy name?"  And he replies: "Lady, my
 name is Yder, son of Nut."  And they knew that he told the truth.
 Then the Queen arose, and going before the King, said: "Sire, did
 you hear?  You have done well to wait for Erec, the valiant
 knight.  I gave you good advice yesterday, when I counselled you
 to await his return.  This proves that it is wise to take
 advice."  The King replies: "That is no lie; rather is it
 perfectly true that he who takes advice is no fool.  Happily we
 followed your advice yesterday.  But if you care anything for me,
 release this knight from his durance, provided he consent to join
 henceforth my household and court; and if he does not consent,
 let him suffer the consequence."  When the King had thus spoken,
 the Queen straightway released the knight; but it was on this
 condition, that he should remain in the future at the court.  He
 did not have to be urged before he gave his consent to stay.  Now
 he was of the court and household to which he had not before
 belonged.  Then valets were at hand to run and relieve him of his
 arms.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1244-1319.)  Now we must revert to Erec, whom we left in the
 field where the battle had taken place.  Even Tristan, when he
 slew fierce Morhot on Saint Samson's isle (13), awakened no such
 jubilee as they celebrated here over Erec.  Great and small, thin
 and stout -- all make much of him and praise his knighthood.
 There is not a knight but cries: "Lord what a vassal!  Under
 Heaven there is not his like!"  They follow him to his lodgings,
 praising him and talking much.  Even the Count himself embraces
 him, who above the rest was glad, and said: "Sire, if you please,
 you ought by right to lodge in my house, since you are the son of
 King Lac.  If you would accept of my hospitality you would do me
 a great honour, for I regard you as my liege.  Fair sire, may it
 please you, I beg you to lodge with me."  Erec answers: "May it
 not displease you, but I shall not desert my host to-night, who
 has done me much honour in giving me his daughter.  What say you,
 sir?  Is it not a fair and precious gift?"  "Yes, sire," the
 Count replies; "the gift, in truth, is fine and good.  The maid
 herself is fair and clever, and besides is of very noble birth.
 You must know that her mother is my sister.  Surely, I am glad at
 heart that you should deign to take my niece.  Once more I beg
 you to lodge with me this night."  Erec replies: "Ask me no more.
 I will not do it."  Then the Count saw that further insistence
 was useless, and said: "Sire, as it please you!  We may as well
 say no more about it; but I and my knights will all be with you
 to-night to cheer you and bear you company."  When Erec heard
 that, he thanked him, and returned to his host's dwelling, with
 the Count attending him.  Ladies and knights were gathered there,
 and the vavasor was glad at heart.  As soon as Erec arrived, more
 than a score of squires ran quickly to remove his arms.  Any one
 who was present in that house could have witnessed a happy scene.
 Erec went first and took his seat; then all the others in order
 sit down upon the couches, the cushions, and benches.  At Erec's
 side the Count sat down, and the damsel with her radiant face,
 who was feeding the much disputed hawk upon her wrist with a
 plover's wing. (14)  Great honour and joy and prestige had she
 gained that day, and she was very glad at heart both for the bird
 and for her lord.  She could not have been happier, and showed it
 plainly, making no secret of her joy.  All could see how gay she
 was, and throughout the house there was great rejoicing for the
 happiness of the maid they loved.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1320-1352.)  Erec thus addressed the vavasor: "Fair host,
 fair friend, fair sire!  You have done me great honour, and
 richly shall it be repaid you.  To-morrow I shall take away your
 daughter with me to the King's court, where I wish to take her as
 my wife; and if you will tarry here a little, I shall send
 betimes to fetch you.  I shall have you escorted into the country
 which is my father's now, but which later will be mine.  It is
 far from here -- by no means near.  There I shall give you two
 towns, very splendid, rich, and fine.  You shall be lord of
 Roadan, which was built in the time of Adam, and of another town
 close by, which is no less valuable.  The people call it
 Montrevel, and my father owns no better town. (15)  And before
 the third day has passed, I shall send you plenty of gold and
 silver, of dappled and grey furs, and precious silken stuffs
 wherewith to adorn yourself and your wife my dear lady. 
 To-morrow at dawn I wish to take your daughter to court, dressed
 and arrayed as she is at present.  I wish my lady, the Queen, to
 dress her in her best dress of satin and scarlet cloth."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1353-1478.)  There was a maiden near at hand, very
 honourable, prudent, and virtuous.  She was seated on a bench
 beside the maid with the white shift, and was her own cousin the
 niece of my lord the Count.  When she heard how Erec intended to
 take her cousin in such very poor array to the Queen's court, she
 spoke about it to the Count.  "Sire," she says, "it would be a
 shame to you more than to any one else if this knight should take
 your niece away with him in such sad array."  And the Count made
 answer: "Gentle niece, do you give her the best of your dresses."
 But Erec heard the conversation, and said: "By no means, my lord.
 For be assured that nothing in the world would tempt me to let
 her have another robe until the Queen shall herself bestow it
 upon her."  When the damsel heard this, she replied: "Alas!  fair
 sire, since you insist upon leading off my cousin thus dressed in
 a white shift and chemise, and since you are determined that she
 shall have none of my dresses, a different gift I wish to make
 her.  I have three good palfreys, as good as any of king or
 count, one sorrel, one dappled, and the other black with white
 forefeet.  Upon my word, if you had a hundred to pick from, you
 would not find a better one than the dappled mount.  The birds in
 the air do not fly more swiftly than the palfrey; and he is not
 too lively, but just suits a lady.  A child can ride him, for he
 is neither skittish nor balky, nor does he bite nor kick nor
 become unmanageable.  Any one who is looking for something better
 does not know what he wants.  And his pace is so easy and gentle
 that a body is more comfortable and easy on his back than in a
 boat."  Then said Erec: "My dear, I have no objection to her
 accepting this gift; indeed, I am pleased with the offer, and do
 not wish her to refuse it."  Then the damsel calls one of her
 trusty servants, and says to him: "Go, friend, saddle my dappled
 palfrey, and lead him here at once."  And he carries out her
 command: he puts on saddle and bridle and strives to make him
 appear well.  Then he jumps on the maned palfrey, which is now
 ready for inspection.  When Erec saw the animal, he did not spare
 his praise, for he could see that he was very fine and gentle. 
 So he bade a servant lead him back and hitch him in the stable
 beside his own horse.  Then they all separated, after an evening
 agreeably spent.  The Count goes off to his own dwelling, and
 leaves Erec with the vavasor, saying that he will bear him
 company in the morning when he leaves.  All that night they slept
 well.  In the morning, when the dawn was bright, Erec prepares to
 start, commanding his horses to be saddled.  His fair sweetheart,
 too, awakes, dresses, and makes ready.  The vavasor and his wife
 rise too, and every knight and lady there prepares to escort the
 damsel and the knight.  Now they are all on horseback, and the
 Count as well.  Erec rides beside the Count, having beside him
 his sweetheart ever mindful of her hawk.  Having no other riches,
 she plays with her hawk.  Very merry were they as they rode
 along; but when the time came to part, the Count wished to send
 along with Erec a party of his knights to do him honour by
 escorting him.  But he announced that none should bide with him,
 and that he wanted no company but that of the damsel.  Then, when
 they had accompanied them some distance, he said: "In God's name,
 farewell!"  Then the Count kisses Erec and his niece, and
 commends them both to merciful God.  Her father and mother, too,
 kiss them again and again, and could not keep back their tears:
 at parting, the mother weeps, the father and the daughter too.
 For such is love and human nature, and such is affection between
 parents and children.  They wept from sorrow, tenderness, and
 love which they had for their child; yet they knew full well that
 their daughter was to fill a place from which great honour would
 accrue to them.  They shed tears of love and pity when they
 separated from their daughter, but they had no other cause to
 weep.  They knew well enough that eventually they would receive
 great honour from her marriage.  So at parting many a tear was
 shed, as weeping they commend one another to God, and thus
 separate without more delay.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1479-1690.)  Erec quit his host; for he was very anxious to
 reach the royal court.  In his adventure he took great
 satisfaction; for now he had a lady passing fair, discreet,
 courteous, and debonair.  He could not look at her enough: for
 the more he looks at her, the more she pleases him.  He cannot
 help giving her a kiss.  He is happy to ride by her side, and it
 does him good to look at her.  Long he gazes at her fair hair,
 her laughing eyes, and her radiant forehead, her nose, her face,
 and mouth, for all of which gladness fills his heart.  He gazes
 upon her down to the waist, at her chin and her snowy neck, her
 bosom and sides, her arms and hands.  But no less the damsel
 looks at the vassal with a clear eye and loyal heart, as if they
 were in competition.  They would not have ceased to survey each
 other even for promise of a reward!  A perfect match they were in
 courtesy, beauty, and gentleness.  And they were so alike in
 quality, manner, and customs, that no one wishing to tell the
 truth could choose the better of them, nor the fairer, nor the
 more discreet.  Their sentiments, too, were much alike; so that
 they were well suited to each other.  Thus each steals the
 other's heart away.  Law or marriage never brought together two
 such sweet creatures.  And so they rode along until just on the
 stroke of noon they approached the castle of Cardigan, where they
 were both expected.  Some of the first nobles of the court had
 gone up to look from the upper windows and see if they could see
 them.  Queen Guinevere ran up, and even the King came with Kay
 and Perceval of Wales, and with them my lord Gawain and Tor, the
 son of King Ares; Lucan the cupbearer was there, too, and many
 another doughty knight.  Finally, they espied Erec coming along
 in company with his lady.  They all knew him well enough from as
 far as they could see him.  The Queen is greatly pleased, and
 indeed the whole court is glad of his coming, because they all
 love him so.  As soon as he was come before the entrance hall,
 the King and Queen go down to meet him, all greeting him in God's
 name.  They welcome Erec and his maiden, commending and praising
 her great beauty.  And the King himself caught her and lifted her
 down from her palfrey.  The King was decked in fine array and was
 then in cheery mood.  He did signal honour to the damsel by
 taking her hand and leading her up into the great stone hall.
 After them Erec and the Queen also went up hand in hand, and he
 said to her: "I bring you, lady, my damsel and my sweetheart
 dressed in poor garb.  As she was given to me, so have I brought
 her to you.  She is the daughter of a poor vavasor.  Through
 poverty many an honourable man is brought low: her father, for
 instance, is gentle and courteous, but he has little means.  And
 her mother is a very gentle lady, the sister of a rich Count. 
 She has no lack of beauty or of lineage, that I should not marry
 her.  It is poverty that has compelled her to wear this white
 linen garment until both sleeves are torn at the side.  And yet,
 had it been my desire, she might have had dresses rich enough.
 For another damsel, a cousin of hers, wished to give her a robe
 of ermine and of spotted or grey silk.  But I would not have her
 dressed in any other robe until you should have seen her.  Gentle
 lady, consider the matter now and see what need she has of a fine
 becoming gown."  And the Queen at once replies: "You have done
 quite right; it is fitting that she should have one of my gowns,
 and I will give her straightway a rich, fair gown, both fresh and
 new."  The Queen then hastily took her off to her own private
 room, and gave orders to bring quickly the fresh tunic and the
 greenish-purple mantle, embroidered with little crosses, which
 had been made for herself.  The one who went at her behest came
 bringing to her the mantle and the tunic, which was lined with
 white ermine even to the sleeves.  At the wrists and on the neck-
 band there was in truth more than half a mark's weight of beaten
 gold, and everywhere set in the gold there were precious stones
 of divers colours, indigo and green, blue and dark brown.  This
 tunic was very rich, but not a writ less precious, I trow, was
 the mantle.  As yet, there were no ribbons on it; for the mantle
 like the tunic was brand new.  The mantle was very rich and fine:
 laid about the neck were two sable skins, and in the tassels
 there was more than an ounce of gold; on one a hyacinth, and on
 the other a ruby flashed more bright than burning candle.  The
 fur lining was of white ermine; never was finer seen or found.
 The cloth was skilfully embroidered with little crosses, all
 different, indigo, vermilion, dark blue, white, green, blue, and
 yellow.  The Queen called for some ribbons four ells long, made
 of silken thread and gold.  The ribbons are given to her,
 handsome and well matched.  Quickly she had them fastened to the
 mantle by some one who knew how to do it, and who was master of
 the art.  When the mantle needed no more touches, the gay and
 gentle lady clasped the maid with the white gown and said to her
 cheerily: "Mademoiselle, you must change this frock for this
 tunic which is worth more than a hundred marks of silver.  So
 much I wish to bestow upon you.  And put on this mantle, too.
 Another time I will give you more."  Not able to refuse the gift,
 she takes the robe and thanks her for it.  Then two maids took
 her aside into a room, where she took off her frock as being of
 no further value; but she asked and requested that it be given
 away (to some poor woman) for the love of God.  Then she dons the
 tunic, and girds herself, binding on tightly a golden belt, and
 afterwards puts on the mantle.  Now she looked by no means ill;
 for the dress became her so well that it made her look more
 beautiful than ever.  The two maids wove a gold thread in amongst
 her golden hair: but her tresses were more radiant than the
 thread of gold, fine though it was.  The maids, moreover, wove a
 fillet of flowers of many various colours and placed it upon her
 head.  They strove as best they might to adorn her in such wise
 that no fault should be found with her attire.  Strung upon a
 ribbon around her neck, a damsel hung two brooches of enamelled
 gold.  Now she looked so charming and fair that I do not believe
 that you could find her equal in any land, search as you might,
 so skilfully had Nature wrought in her.  Then she stepped out of
 the dressing-room into the Queen's presence.  The Queen made much
 of her, because she liked her and was glad that she was beautiful
 and had such gentle manners.  They took each other by the hand
 and passed into the King's presence.  And when the King saw them,
 he got up to meet them.  When they came into the great hall,
 there were so many knights there who rose before them that I
 cannot call by name the tenth part of them, or the thirteenth, or
 the fifteenth.  But I can tell you the names of some of the best
 of the knights who belonged to the Round Table and who were the
 best in the world.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1691-1750.)  Before all the excellent knights, Gawain ought
 to be named the first, and second Erec the son of Lac, and third
 Lancelot of the Lake. (16)  Gornemant of Gohort was fourth, and
 the fifth was the Handsome Coward.  The sixth was the Ugly Brave,
 the seventh Meliant of Liz, the eighth Mauduit the Wise, and the
 ninth Dodinel the Wild.  Let Gandelu be named the tenth, for he
 was a goodly man.  The others I shall mention without order,
 because the numbers bother me.  Eslit was there with Briien, and
 Yvain the son of Uriien.  And Yvain of Loenel was there, as well
 as Yvain the Adulterer.  Beside Yvain of Cavaliot was Garravain
 of Estrangot.  After the Knight with the Horn was the Youth with
 the Golden Ring.  And Tristan who never laughed sat beside
 Bliobleheris, and beside Brun of Piciez was his brother Gru the
 Sullen.  The Armourer sat next, who preferred war to peace.  Next
 sat Karadues the Shortarmed, a knight of good cheer; and Caveron
 of Robendic, and the son of King Quenedic and the Youth of
 Quintareus and Yder of the Dolorous Mount.  Gaheriet and Kay of
 Estraus, Amauguin and Gales the Bald, Grain, Gornevain, and
 Carabes, and Tor the son of King Aras, Girflet the son of Do, and
 Taulas, who never wearied of arms: and a young man of great
 merit, Loholt the son of King Arthur, (17) and Sagremor the
 Impetuous, who should not be forgotten, nor Bedoiier the Master
 of the Horse, who was skilled at chess and trictrac, nor Bravain,
 nor King Lot, nor Galegantin of Wales, nor Gronosis, versed in
 evil, who was son of Kay the Seneschal, nor Labigodes the
 Courteous, nor Count Cadorcaniois. nor Letron of Prepelesant,
 whose manners were so excellent, nor Breon the son of Canodan,
 nor the Count of Honolan who had such a head of fine fair hair;
 he it was who received the King's horn in an evil day; (18) he
 never had any care for truth.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1751-1844.)  When the stranger maiden saw all the knights
 arrayed looking steadfastly at her, she bowed her head in
 embarrassment; nor was it strange that her face blushed all
 crimson.  But her confusion was so becoming to her that she
 looked all the more lovely.  When the King saw that she was
 embarrassed, he did not wish to leave her side.  Taking her
 gently by the hand, he made her sit down on his right hand; and
 on his left sat the Queen, speaking thus to the King the while.
 "Sire, in my opinion he who can win such a fair lady by his arms
 in another land ought by right to come to a royal court.  It was
 well we waited for Erec; for now you can bestow the kiss upon the
 fairest of the court.  I should think none would find fault with
 you!  for none can say, unless he lie, that this maiden is not
 the most charming of all the damsels here, or indeed in all the
 world."  The King makes answer: "That is no lie; and upon her, if
 there is no remonstrance, I shall bestow the honour of the White
 Stag."  Then he added to the knights: "My lords, what say you?
 What is your opinion?  In body, in face, and in whatever a maid
 should have, this one is the most charming and beautiful to be
 found, as I may say, before you come to where Heaven and earth
 meet.  I say it is meet that she should receive the honour of the
 Stag.  And you, my lords, what do you think about it?  Can you
 make any objection?  If any one wishes to protest, let him
 straightway speak his mind.  I am King, and must keep my word and
 must not permit any baseness, falsity, or arrogance.  I must
 maintain truth and righteousness.  It is the business of a loyal
 king to support the law, truth, faith, and justice.  I would not
 in any wise commit a disloyal deed or wrong to either weak or
 strong.  It is not meet that any one should complain of me; nor
 do I wish the custom and the practice to lapse, which my family
 has been wont to foster.  You, too, would doubtless regret to see
 me strive to introduce other customs and other laws than those my
 royal sire observed.  Regardless of consequences, I am bound to
 keep and maintain the institution of my father Pendragon, who was
 a just king and emperor.  Now tell me fully what you think!  Let
 none be slow to speak his mind, if this damsel is not the fairest
 of my household and ought not by right to receive the kiss of the
 White Stag: I wish to know what you truly think."  Then they all
 cry with one accord: "Sire, by the Lord and his Cross! you may
 well kiss her with good reason, for she is the fairest one there
 is.  In this damsel there is more beauty than there is of
 radiance in the sun.  You may kiss her freely, for we all agree
 in sanctioning it."  When the King hears that this is well
 pleasing to them all, he will no longer delay in bestowing the
 kiss, but turns toward her and embraces her.  The maid was
 sensible, and perfectly willing that the King should kiss her;
 she would have been discourteous, indeed, to resent it.  In
 courteous fashion and in the presence of all his knights the King
 kissed her, and said: "My dear.  I give you my love in all
 honesty.  I will love you with true heart, without malice and
 without guile."  By this adventure the King carried out the
 practice and the usage to which the White Stag was entitled at
 his court.
 </p><p>
 Here ends the first part of my story. (19)
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1845-1914.)  When the kiss of the Stag was taken according
 to the custom of the country, Erec, like a polite and kind man,
 was solicitous for his poor host.  It was not his intention to
 fail to execute what he had promised.  Hear how he kept his
 covenant: for he sent him now five sumpter mules, strong and
 sleek, loaded with dresses and clothes, buckrams and scarlets,
 marks of gold and silver plate, furs both vair and grey, skins of
 sable, purple stuffs, and silks.  When the mules were loaded with
 all that a gentleman can need, he sent with them an escort of ten
 knights and sergeants chosen from his own men, and straightly
 charged them to salute his host and show great honour both to him
 and to his lady, as if it were to himself in person; and when
 they should have presented to them the sumpters which they
 brought them, the gold, the silver, and money, and all the other
 furnishings which were in the boxes, they should escort the lady
 and the vavasor with great honour into his kingdom of Farther
 Wales. (20)  Two towns there he had promised them, the most
 choice and the best situated that there were in all his land,
 with nothing to fear from attack.  Montrevel was the name of one,
 and the other's name was Roadan.  When they should arrive in his
 kingdom, they should make over to them these two towns, together
 with their rents and their jurisdiction, in accordance with what
 he had promised them.  All was carried out as Erec had ordered. 
 The messengers made no delay, and in good time they presented to
 his host the gold and the silver and the sumpters and the robes
 and the money, of which there was great plenty.  They escorted
 them into Erec's kingdom, and strove to serve them well.  They
 came into the country on the third day, and transferred to them
 the towers of the towns; for King Lac made no objection.  He gave
 them a warm welcome and showed them honour, loving them for the
 sake of his son Erec.  He made over to them the title to the
 towns, and established their suzerainty by making knights and
 bourgeois swear that they would reverence them as their true
 liege lords.  When this was done and accomplished, the messengers
 returned to their lord Erec, who received them gladly.  When he
 asked for news of the vavasor and his lady, of his own father and
 of his kingdom, the report they gave him was good and fair.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 1915-2024.)  Not long after this, the time drew near when
 Erec was to celebrate his marriage.  The delay was irksome to
 him, and he resolved no longer to suffer and wait.  So he went
 and asked of the King that it might please him to allow him to be
 married at the court.  The King vouchsafed him the boon, and sent
 through all his kingdom to search for the kings and counts who
 were his liege-men, bidding them that none be so bold as not to
 be present at Pentecost.  None dares to hold back and not go to
 court at the King's summons.  Now I will tell you, and listen
 well, who were these counts and kings.  With a rich escort and
 one hundred extra mounts Count Brandes of Gloucester came.  After
 him came Menagormon, who was Count of Clivelon.  And he of the
 Haute Montagne came with a very rich following.  The Count of
 Treverain came, too, with a hundred of his knights, and Count
 Godegrain with as many more.  Along with those whom I have just
 mentioned came Maheloas, a great baron, lord of the Isle of
 Voirre.  In this island no thunder is heard, no lightning
 strikes, nor tempests rage, nor do toads or serpents exist there,
 nor is it ever too hot or too cold. (21)  Graislemier of Fine
 Posterne brought twenty companions, and had with him his brother
 Guigomar, lord of the Isle of Avalon.  Of the latter we have
 heard it said that he was a friend of Morgan the Fay, and such he
 was in very truth.  Davit of Tintagel came, who never suffered
 woe or grief.  Guergesin, the Duke of Haut Bois, came with a very
 rich equipment.  There was no lack of counts and dukes, but of
 kings there were still more.  Garras of Cork, a doughty king, was
 there with five hundred knights clad in mantles, hose, and tunics
 of brocade and silk.  Upon a Cappadocian steed came Aguisel, the
 Scottish king, and brought with him his two sons, Cadret and Coi
 -- two much respected knights.  Along with those whom I have
 named came King Ban of Gomeret, and he had in his company only
 young men, beardless as yet on chin and lip.  A numerous and gay
 band he brought two hundred of them in his suite; and there was
 none, whoever he be, but had a falcon or tercel, a merlin or a
 sparrow-hawk, or some precious pigeon-hawk, golden or mewed.
 Kerrin, the old King of Riel, brought no youth, but rather three
 hundred companions of whom the youngest was seven score years
 old.  Because of their great age, their heads were all as white
 as snow, and their beards reached down to their girdles.  Arthur
 held them in great respect.  The lord of the dwarfs came next,
 Bilis, the king of Antipodes.  This king of whom I speak was a
 dwarf himself and own brother of Brien.  Bilis, on the one hand,
 was the smallest of all the dwarfs, while his brother Brien was a
 half-foot or full palm taller than any other knight in the
 kingdom.  To display his wealth and power, Bilis brought with him
 two kings who were also dwarfs and who were vassals of his,
 Grigoras and Glecidalan.  Every one looked at them as marvels.
 When they had arrived at court, they were treated with great
 esteem.  All three were honoured and served at the court like
 kings, for they were very perfect gentlemen.  In brief, when King
 Arthur saw all his lords assembled, his heart was glad.  Then, to
 heighten the joy, he ordered a hundred squires to be bathed whom
 he wished to dub knights.  There was none of them but had a
 parti-coloured robe of rich brocade of Alexandria, each one
 choosing such as pleased his fancy.  All had arms of a uniform
 pattern, and horses swift and full of mettle, of which the worst
 was worth a hundred livres.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2025-2068.)  When Erec received his wife, he must needs call
 her by her right name.  For a wife is not espoused unless she is
 called by her proper name.  As yet no one knew her name, but now
 for the first time it was made known: Enide was her baptismal
 name. (22)  The Archbishop of Canterbury, who had come to the
 court, blessed them, as is his right.  When the court was all
 assembled, there was not a minstrel in the countryside who
 possessed any pleasing accomplishment that did not come to the
 court.  In the great hall there was much merry-making, each one
 contributing what he could to the entertainment: one jumps,
 another tumbles, another does magic; there is story-telling,
 singing, whistling, playing from notes; they play on the harp,
 the rote, the fiddle, the violin, the flute, and pipe.  The
 maidens sing and dance, and outdo each other in the merry-making. 
 At the wedding that day everything was done which can give joy
 and incline man's heart to gladness.  Drums are beaten, large and
 small, and there is playing of pipes, fifes, horns, trumpets, and
 bagpipes.  What more shall I say?  There was not a wicket or a
 gate kept closed; but the exits and entrances all stood ajar, so
 that no one, poor or rich, was turned away.  King Arthur was not
 miserly, but gave orders to the bakers, the cooks, and the
 butlers that they should serve every one generously with bread,
 wine, and venison.  No one asked anything whatever to be passed
 to him without getting all he desired.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2069-2134.)  There was great merriment in the palace.  But I
 will pass over the rest, and you shall hear of the joy and
 pleasure in the bridal chamber.  Bishops and archbishops were
 there on the night when the bride and groom retired.  At this
 their first meeting, Iseut was not filched away, nor was Brangien
 put in her place. (23)  The Queen herself took charge of their
 preparations for the night; for both of them were dear to her.
 The hunted stag which pants for thirst does not so long for the
 spring, nor does the hungry sparrow-hawk return so quickly when
 he is called, as did these two come to hold each other in close
 embrace.  That night they had full compensation for their long
 delay.  After the chamber had been cleared, they allow each sense
 to be gratified: the eyes, which are the entrance-way of love,
 and which carry messages to the heart, take satisfaction in the
 glance, for they rejoice in all they see; after the message of
 the eyes comes the far surpassing sweetness of the kisses
 inviting love; both of them make trial of this sweetness, and let
 their hearts quaff so freely that hardly can they leave off.
 Thus, kissing was their first sport.  And the love which is
 between them emboldened the maid and left her quite without her
 fears; regardless of pain, she suffered all.  Before she rose,
 she no longer bore the name of maid; in the morning she was a
 new-made dame.  That day the minstrels were in happy mood, for
 they were all well paid.  They were fully compensated for the
 entertainment they had given, and many a handsome gift was
 bestowed upon them: robes of grey squirrel skin and ermine, of
 rabbit skins and violet stuffs, scarlets and silken stuffs. 
 Whether it be a horse or money, each one got what he deserved
 according to his skill.  And thus the wedding festivities and the
 court lasted almost a fortnight with great joy and magnificence.
 For his own glory and satisfaction, as well as to honour Erec the
 more, King Arthur made all the knights remain a full fortnight.
 When the third week began, all together by common consent agreed
 to hold a tournament.  On the one side, my lord Gawain offered
 himself as surety that it would take place between Evroic and
 Tenebroc: and Meliz and Meliadoc were guarantors on the other
 side.  Then the court separated.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2135-2292.)  A month after Pentecost the tournament
 assembled, and the jousting began in the plain below Tenebroc.
 Many an ensign of red, blue, and white, many a veil and many a
 sleeve were bestowed as tokens of love.  Many a lance was carried
 there, flying the colours argent and green, or gold and azure
 blue.  There were many, too, with different devices, some with
 stripes and some with dots.  That day one saw laced on many a
 helmet of gold or steel, some green, some yellow, and others red,
 all aglowing in the sun; so many scutcheons and white hauberks;
 so many swords girt on the left side; so many good shields, fresh
 and new, some resplendent in silver and green, others of azure
 with buckles of gold; so many good steeds marked with white, or
 sorrel, tawny, white, black, and bay: all gather hastily.  And
 now the field is quite covered with arms.  On either side the
 ranks tremble, and a roar rises from the fight.  The shock of the
 lances is very great.  Lances break and shields are riddled, the
 hauberks receive bumps and are torn asunder, saddles go empty and
 horsemen ramble, while the horses sweat and foam.  Swords are
 quickly drawn on those who tumble noisily, and some run to
 receive the promise of a ransom, others to stave off this
 disgrace.  Erec rode a white horse, and came forth alone at the
 head of the line to joust, if he may find an opponent.  From the
 opposite side there rides out to meet him Orguelleus de la Lande,
 mounted on an Irish steed which bears him along with marvellous
 speed.  On the shield before his breast Erec strikes him with
 such force that he knocks him from his horse: he leaves him prone
 and passes on.  Then Raindurant opposed him, son of the old dame
 of Tergalo, covered with blue cloth of silk; he was a knight of
 great prowess.  Against one another now they charge and deal
 fierce blows on the shields about their neck.  Erec from lance's
 length lays him over on the hard ground.  While riding back he
 met the King of the Red City, who was very valiant and bold. 
 They grasp their reins by the knots and their shields by the
 inner straps.  They both had fine arms, and strong swift horses,
 and good shields, fresh and new.  With such fury they strike each
 other that both their lances fly in splinters.  Never was there
 seen such a blow.  They rush together with shields, arms, and
 horses.  But neither girth nor rein nor breast-strap could
 prevent the king from coming to earth.  So he flew from his
 steed, carrying with him saddle and stirrup, and even the reins
 of his bridle in his hand.  All those who witnessed the jousting
 were filled with amazement, and said it cost him dear to joust
 with such a goodly knight.  Erec did not wish to stop to capture
 either horse or rider, but rather to joust and distinguish
 himself in order that his prowess might appear.  He thrills the
 ranks in front of him.  Gawain animates those who were on his
 side by his prowess, and by winning horses and knights to the
 discomfiture of his opponents.  I speak of my lord Gawain, who
 did right well and valiantly.  In the fight he unhorsed Guincel,
 and took Gaudin of the Mountain; he captured knights and horses
 alike: my lord Gawain did well.  Girtlet the son of Do, and
 Yvain, and Sagremor the Impetuous, so evilly entreated their
 adversaries that they drove them back to the gates, capturing and
 unhorsing many of them.  In front of the gate of the town the
 strife began again between those within and those without.  There
 Sagremor was thrown down, who was a very gallant knight.  He was
 on the point of being detained and captured, when Erec spurs to
 rescue him, breaking his lance into splinters upon one of the
 opponents.  So hard he strikes him on the breast that he made him
 quit the saddle.  Then he made of his sword and advances upon
 them, crushing and splitting their helmets.  Some flee, and
 others make way before him, for even the boldest fears him.
 Finally, he distributed so many blows and thrusts that he rescued
 Sagremor from them, and drove them all in confusion into the
 town.  Meanwhile, the vesper hour drew to a close.  Erec bore
 himself so well that day that he was the best of the combatants.
 But on the morrow he did much better yet: for he took so many
 knights and left so many saddles empty that none could believe it
 except those who had seen it.  Every one on both sides said that
 with his lance and shield he had won the honours of the
 tournament.  Now was Erec's renown so high that no one spoke save
 of him, nor was any one of such goodly favour.  In countenance he
 resembled Absalom, in language he seemed a Solomon, in boldness
 he equalled Samson, (24) and in generous giving and spending he
 was the equal of Alexander.  On his return from the tourney Erec
 went to speak with the King.  He went to ask him for leave to go
 and visit his own land; but first he thanked him like a frank,
 wise, and courteous man for the honour which he had done him; for
 very deep was his gratitude.  Then he asked his permission to
 leave, for he wished to visit his own country, and he wished to
 take his wife with him.  This request the King could not deny,
 and yet he would have had him stay.  He gives him leave and begs
 him to return as soon as possible: for in the whole court there
 was no better or more gallant knight, save only his dear nephew
 Gawain; (25) with him no one could be compared.  But next after
 him, he prized Erec most, and held him more dear than any other
 knight.

 (1)  A Welsh version, "Geraint the Son of Erbin", included in
      Lady Charlotte Guest's translation of "The Mabinogion"
      (London, 1838-49; a modern edition will be found in Everyman
      Library, London, 1906), tells the same story as "Erec et
      Enide" with some variations.  This Welsh version has also
      been translated into modern French by J. Loth ("Les
      Mabinogion", Paris, 1889), where it may be consulted with
      the greatest confidence.  The relation of the Welsh prose to
      the French poem is a moot point.  Cf. E. Philipot in
      "Romania", XXV. 258-294, and earlier, K. Othmer, "Ueber das
      Verhaltnis Chrestiens Erec und Enide zu dem Mabinogion des
      rothen Buch von Hergest" (Koln, 1889); G. Paris in
      "Romania", XIX. 157, and id. XX. 148-166.

 (2)  We frequently read in the romances of a hunt at Easter (F.). 
      As here, so in "Fergus" (ed. Martin, Halle, 1872), p. 2 f.,
      the knights hunt a white stag, which Perceval finally slays,
      but there is no mention of the ceremony of the bestowal of a
      kiss.
 </p><p>
 (3)  Chretien nowhere gives any description of the nature of the
      Round Table.  With him, it is an institution.  Layamon in
      "Brut" and Wace in "Le Roman de Brut" are more specific in
      their accounts of this remarkable piece of furniture.  From
      their descriptions, and from other sources in Welsh and
      Irish literature, it is reasonable to suppose that the Round
      Table had a place in primitive Celtic folk-lore.  Cf. L.F.
      Mott, "The Round Table" in "Pub. of the Modern Language
      Association of America", XX. 231-264; A.C.L. Brown, "The
      Round Table before Wace" in "Harvard Studies and Notes in
      Philology and Literature", vii. 183-205 (Boston, 1900); Miss
      J.L Weston, "A Hitherto Unconsidered Aspect of the Round
      Table" in "Melanges de philologie romane offerts a M.
      Wilmotte", ii. 883-894, 2 vols. (Paris, 1910).
 </p><p>
 (4)  There exists a romance devoted to Yder, of which G. Paris
      printed a resume in "Hist. Litt. de la France", XXX., and
      which has been recently edited by Heinrich Gelzer: "Der
      altfranzosische Yderroman" (Dresden, 1913).  There are
      apparently three different knight of this name in the old
      French romances (F.).
 </p><p>
 (5)  The word "chastel" (from "castellum") is usually to be
      translated as "town" or strong place within fortifications. 
      Only where it plainly refers to a detached building will the
      word "castle" be used.
 </p><p>
 (6)  A "tercel" is a species of falcon, of which the male bird is
      one-third smaller than the female.
 </p><p>
 (7)  A "vavasor" (from "vassus vassallorum") was a low order of
      vassal, but a freeman.  The vavasors are spoken of with
      respect in the old French romances, as being of honourable
      character, though not of high birth.
 </p><p>
 (8)  The numerous references to the story of King Mark, Tristan,
      and Iseut in the extant poems of Chretien support his own
      statement, made at the outset of "Cliges", that he himself
      composed a poem on the nephew and wife of the King of
      Cornwall.  We have fragments of poems on Tristan by the
      Anglo-Norman poets Beroul and Thomas, who were
      contemporaries of Chretien.  Foerster's hypothesis that the
      lost "Tristan" of Chretien antedated "Erec" is doubtless
      correct.  That the poet later treated of the love of Cliges
      and Fenice as a sort of literary atonement for the
      inevitable moral laxity of Tristan and Iseut has been held
      by some, and the theory is acceptable in view of the
      references to be met later in "Cliges".  For the contrary
      opinion of Gaston Paris see "Journal des Savants" (1902), p.
      297 f.
 </p><p>
 (9)  In the Mabinogi "Geraint the Son of Erbin", the host
      explains that he had wrongfully deprived his nephew of his
      possessions, and that in revenge the nephew had later taken
      all his uncle's property, including an earldom and this
      town.  See Guest, "The Mabinogion".
 </p><p>
 (10) The hauberk was a long shirt of mail reaching to the knees,
      worn by knights in combat.  The helmet, and the "coiffe"
      beneath it, protected the head; the "ventail" of linked
      meshes was worn across the lower part of the face, and was
      attached on each side of the neck to the "coiffe", so that
      it protected the throat; the greaves covered the legs.  The
      body of the knight was thus well protected against blow of
      sword or lance.  Cf. Vv.711 f.
 </p><p>
 (11) This passage seems to imply that charms and enchantments
      were sometimes used when a knight was armed (F.).
 </p><p>
 (12) The "loges", so often mentioned in old French romances, were
      either window-balconies or architectural points of vantage
      commanding some pleasing prospect.  The conventional
      translation in the old English romances is "bower".
 </p><p>
 (13) Tristan killed Morholt, the uncle of Iseut, when he came to
      claim tribute form King Mark (cf. Bedier, "Le Roman de
      Tristan", etc., i. 85 f., 2 vols., Paris, 1902).  The combat
      took place on an island, unnamed in the original text (id.
      i. 84), but later identified with St. Samson's Isle, one of
      the Scilly Isles.
 </p><p>
 (14) The same act of feeding a hunting-bird with a plover's wing
      is mentioned in "Le Roman de Thebes", 3857-58 (ed. "Anciens
      Textes").
 </p><p>
 (15) For such figurative expressions used to complement the
      negative, cf. Gustav Dreyling, "Die Ausdruckweise der
      ubertriebenen Verkleinerung im altfranzosischen Karlsepos",
      in Stengel's "Ausgaben und Abhandlungen", No. 82 (Marsburg,
      1888); W.W. Comfort in "Modern Language Notes" (Baltimore,
      February 1908).
 </p><p>
 (16) Chretien in his later romances will avoid compiling such a
      prosaic blue-book as is found in this passage, though
      similar lists of knights occur in the old English romances
      as late as Malory, though of some of them but little is
      known.  Unfortunately, we have for the old French romances
      no such complete work as that furnished for the epic poems
      by E. Langois, "Table des noms propres de toute nature
      compris dans les chansons de geste" (Paris, 1904).
 </p><p>
 (17) The only mention by Chretien of this son of Arthur, whose
      role is absolutely insignificant in the Arthurian romances.
 </p><p>
 (18) What was this drinking-cup, and who sent it to Arthur?  We
      have "Le Lai du cor" (ed. Wulff, Lund, 1888), which tells
      how a certain King Mangount of Moraine sent a magic
      drinking-cup to Arthur.  No one could drink of this cup
      without spilling the contents if he were a cuckold. 
      Drinking from this cup was, then, one of the many current
      tests of chastity.  Further light may be thrown on the
      passage in our text by the English poem "The Cokwold's
      Daunce" (in C.H. Hartshorne's "Ancient Metrical Ballads",
      London, 1829), where Arthur is described as a cuckold
      himself and as having always by him a horn (cup) which he
      delights in trying on his knights as a test of their ladies'
      chastity.  For bibliography see T.P. Cross, "Notes on the
      Chastity-Testing Horns and Mantle" in "Modern Philology", x.
      289-299.
 </p><p>
 (19) A unique instance of such a division of the material in
      Chretien's poems (F.).
 </p><p>
 (20) Outre-Gales=Estre-Gales (v.3883)=Extra-Galliam.
 </p><p>
 (21) Such fanciful descriptions of men and lands are common in
      the French epic poems, where they are usually applied to the
      Saracens (F.).  Cf. W.w. Comfort, "The Saracens in Christian
      Poetry" in "The Dublin Review", July 1911; J. Malsch, "Die
      Charakteristik der Volker im altfranzosischen nationalen
      Epos" (Heidelberg, 1912).
 </p><p>
 (22) With what seems to us mistaken taste, Chretien frequently
      thus delays mentioning the name of his leading charecters. 
      The father and mother of Enide remain anonymous until the
      end of this poem.  The reader will remark other instances of
      this peculiarity in "Yvain" and "Lancelot".

 (23) The maid Brangien was substituted for Iseut, the bride, upon
      the first night after her marriage with Mark.  Similar
      traditions are associated with the marriage of Arthur and
      Guinevere, and of Pepin and Berte aus grans pies, the
      parents of Charlemagne.  Adenet le Roi toward the end of the
      13th century is the author of the most artistic treatments
      of Berte's history (ed. A. Scheler, Bruxelles, 1874).  Cf.
      W.W. Comfort, "Adenet le Roi: The End of a Literary Era" in
      "The Quarterly Review", April 1913.

      (1904) suggestion to replace the word "lion" which stands in
      all the MSS.  Solomon's name has always been syonymous with
      wisdom, and Alexander's generosity was proverbial in the
      Middle Ages.  For Alexander, cf. Paul Meyer, "Alexandre le
      Grand dans la litterature francaise du moyen age", 2 vols.
      (Paris, 1886), vol ii., pp. 372-376, and Paget Toynbee,
      "Dante Studies and Researches" (London, 1902), p. 144.

 (25) Of Arthur's several nephews, Gawain is represented by
      Chretien as peerless in respect of courage and courtesy.  In
      the English romances his character steadily deteriorates.
