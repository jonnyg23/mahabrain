 <p>WAINAMOINEN, thus encouraged,<br> Quickly rises in his snow-sledge,<br> Asking no one for assistance,<br> Straightway hastens to the cottage,<br> Takes a seat within the dwelling.<br> Come two maids with silver pitchers,<br> Bringing also golden goblets;<br> Dip they up a very little,<br> But the very smallest measure<br> Of the blood of the magician,<br> From the wounds of Wainamoinen.</p> 
 <p>From the fire-place calls the old man,<br> Thus the gray-beard asks the minstrel:<br> "Tell me who thou art of heroes,<br> Who of all the great magicians?<br> Lo! thy blood fills seven sea-boats,<br> Eight of largest birchen vessels,<br> Flowing from some hero's veinlets,<br> From the wounds of some magician.<br> Other matters I would ask thee;<br> Sing the cause of this thy trouble,<br> Sing to me the source of metals,<br> Sing the origin of iron,<br> How at first it was created."</p> 
 <p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Made this answer to the gray-beard:<br> "Know I well the source of metals,<br> Know the origin of iron;<br> f can tell bow steel is fashioned.<br> Of the mothers air is oldest,<br> Water is the oldest brother,<br> And the fire is second brother,<br> And the youngest brother, iron;<br> Ukko is the first creator.<br> Ukko, maker of the heavens,<br> Cut apart the air and water,<br> Ere was born the metal, iron.<br> Ukko, maker of the heavens,<br> Firmly rubbed his hands together,<br> Firmly pressed them on his knee-cap,<br> Then arose three lovely maidens,<br> Three most beautiful of daughters;<br> These were mothers of the iron,<br> And of steel of bright-blue color.<br> Tremblingly they walked the heavens,<br> Walked the clouds with silver linings,<br> With their bosoms overflowing<br> With the milk of future iron,<br> Flowing on and flowing ever,<br> From the bright rims of the cloudlets<br> To the earth, the valleys filling,<br> To the slumber-calling waters.</p> 
 <p>"Ukko's eldest daughter sprinkled<br> Black milk over river channels<br> And the second daughter sprinkled<br> White milk over hills and mountains,<br> While the youngest daughter sprinkled<br> Red milk over seas and oceans.<br> Whero the black milk had been sprinked,<br> Grew the dark and ductile iron;<br> Where the white milk had been sprinkled.<br> Grew the iron, lighter-colored;<br> Where the red milk had been sprinkled,<br> Grew the red and brittle iron.</p> 
 <p>"After Time had gone a distance,<br> Iron hastened Fire to visit,<br> His beloved elder brother,<br> Thus to know his brother better.<br> Straightway Fire began his roarings,<br> Labored to consume his brother,<br> His beloved younger brother.<br> Straightway Iron sees his danger,<br> Saves himself by fleetly fleeing,<br> From the fiery flame's advances,<br> Fleeing hither, fleeing thither,<br> Fleeing still and taking shelter<br> In the swamps and in the valleys,<br> In the springs that loudly bubble,<br> By the rivers winding seaward,<br> On the broad backs of the marshes,<br> Where the swans their nests have builded,<br> Where the wild geese hatch their goslings.</p> 
 <p>"Thus is iron in the swamp-lands,<br> Stretching by the water-courses,<br> Hidden well for many ages,<br> Hidden in the birchen forests,<br> But he could not hide forever<br> From the searchings of his brother;<br> Here and there the fire has caught him,<br> Caught and brought him to his furnace,<br> That the spears, and swords, and axes,<br> Might be forged and duly hammered.<br> In the swamps ran blackened waters,<br> From the heath the bears came ambling,<br> And the wolves ran through the marshes.<br> Iron then made his appearance,<br> Where the feet of wolves had trodden,<br> Where the paws of bears had trampled.</p> 
 <p>"Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Came to earth to work the metal;<br> He was born upon the Coal-mount,<br> Skilled and nurtured in the coal-fields;<br> In one hand, a copper hammer,<br> In the other, tongs of iron;<br> In the night was born the blacksmith,<br> In the morn he built his smithy,<br> Sought with care a favored hillock,<br> Where the winds might fill his bellows;<br> Found a hillock in the swamp-lands,<br> Where the iron hid abundant;<br> There he built his smelting furnace,<br> There he laid his leathern bellows,<br> Hastened where the wolves had travelled,<br> Followed where the bears had trampled,<br> Found the iron's young formations,<br> In the wolf-tracks of the marshes,<br> In the foot-prints of the gray-bear.</p> 
 <p>"Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> 'Thus addressed the sleeping iron:<br> Thou most useful of the metals,<br> Thou art sleeping in the marshes,<br> Thou art hid in low conditions,<br> Where the wolf treads in the swamp-lands,<br> Where the bear sleeps in the thickets.<br> Hast thou thought and well considered,<br> What would be thy future station,<br> Should I place thee in the furnace,<br> Thus to make thee free and useful?'</p> 
 <p>"Then was Iron sorely frightened,<br> Much distressed and filled with horror,<br> When of Fire he heard the mention,<br> Mention of his fell destroyer.</p> 
 <p>"Then again speaks Ilmarinen,<br> Thus the smith addresses Iron:<br> 'Be not frightened, useful metal,<br> Surely Fire will not consume thee,<br> Will not burn his youngest brother,<br> Will not harm his nearest kindred.<br> Come thou to my room and furnace,<br> Where the fire is freely burning,<br> Thou wilt live, and grow, and prosper,<br> Wilt become the swords of heroes,<br> Buckles for the belts of women.'</p> 
 <p>"Ere arose the star of evening,<br> Iron ore had left the marshes,<br> From the water-beds had risen,<br> Had been carried to the furnace,<br> In the fire the smith had laid it,<br> Laid it in his smelting furnace.<br> Ilmarinen starts the bellows,<br> Gives three motions of the handle,<br> And the iron flows in streamlets<br> From the forge of the magician,<br> Soon becomes like baker's leaven,<br> Soft as dough for bread of barley.<br> Then out-screamed the metal, Iron:<br> 'Wondrous blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Take, O take me from thy furnace,<br> From this fire and cruel torture.'</p> 
 <p>"Ilmarinen thus made answer:<br> 'I will take thee from my furnace,<br> 'Thou art but a little frightened,<br> Thou shalt be a mighty power,<br> Thou shalt slay the best of heroes,<br> Thou shalt wound thy dearest brother.'<br> "Straightway Iron made this promise,<br> Vowed and swore in strongest accents,<br> By the furnace, by the anvil,<br> By the tongs, and by the hammer,<br> These the words he vowed and uttered:<br> 'Many trees that I shall injure,<br> Shall devour the hearts of mountains,<br> Shall not slay my nearest kindred,<br> Shall not kill the best of heroes,<br> Shall not wound my dearest brother;<br> Better live in civil freedom,<br> Happier would be my life-time,<br> Should I serve my fellow-beings,<br> Serve as tools for their convenience,<br> Than as implements of warfare,<br> Slay my friends and nearest. kindred,<br> Wound the children of my mother.'</p> 
 <p>"Now the master, Ilmarinen,<br> The renowned and skilful blacksmith,<br> From the fire removes the iron,<br> Places it upon the anvil,<br> Hammers well until it softens,<br> Hammers many fine utensils,<br> Hammers spears, and swords, and axes,<br> Hammers knives, and forks, and hatchets,<br> Hammers tools of all descriptions.</p> 
 <p>"Many things the blacksmith needed,<br> Many things he could not fashion,<br> Could not make the tongue of iron,<br> Could not hammer steel from iron,<br> Could not make the iron harden.<br> Well considered Ilmarinen,<br> Deeply thought and long reflected.<br> Then he gathered birchen ashes,<br> Steeped the ashes in the water,<br> Made a lye to harden iron,<br> Thus to form the steel most needful.<br> With his tongue he tests the mixture,<br> Weighs it long and well considers,<br> And the blacksmith speaks as follows:<br> 'All this labor is for nothing,<br> Will not fashion steel from iron,<br> Will not make the soft ore harden.'</p> 
 <p>"Now a bee flies from the meadow,<br> Blue-wing coming from the flowers,<br> Flies about, then safely settles<br> Near the furnace of the smithy.</p> 
 <p>"'Thus the smith the bee addresses,<br> These the words of Ilmarinen:<br> 'Little bee, thou tiny birdling,<br> Bring me honey on thy winglets,<br> On thy tongue, I pray thee, bring me<br> Sweetness from the fragrant meadows,<br> From the little cups of flowers,<br> From the tips of seven petals,<br> That we thus may aid the water<br> To produce the steel from iron.'</p> 
 <p>"Evil Hisi's bird, the hornet,<br> Heard these words of Ilmarinen,<br> Looking from the cottage gable,<br> Flying to the bark of birch-trees,<br> While the iron bars were heating<br> While the steel was being tempered;<br> Swiftly flew the stinging hornet,<br> Scattered all the Hisi horrors,<br> Brought the blessing of the serpent,<br> Brought the venom of the adder,<br> Brought the poison of the spider,<br> Brought the stings of all the insects,<br> Mixed them with the ore and water,<br> While the steel was being, tempered.</p> 
 <p>"Ilmarinen, skilful blacksmith,<br> First of all the iron-workers,<br> Thought the bee had surely brought him<br> Honey from the fragrant meadows,<br> From the little cups of flowers,<br> From the tips of seven petals,<br> And he spake the words that follow:<br> 'Welcome, welcome, is thy coming,<br> Honeyed sweetness from the flowers<br> Thou hast brought to aid the water,<br> Thus to form the steel from iron!'</p> 
 <p>"Ilmarinen, ancient blacksmith,<br> Dipped the iron into water,<br> Water mixed with many poisons,<br> Thought it but the wild bee's honey;<br> Thus he formed the steel from iron.<br> When he plunged it into water,<br> Water mixed with many poisons,<br> When be placed it in the furnace,<br> Angry grew the hardened iron,<br> Broke the vow that he had taken,<br> Ate his words like dogs and devils,<br> Mercilessly cut his brother,<br> Madly raged against his kindred,<br> Caused the blood to flow in streamlets<br> From the wounds of man and hero.<br> This, the origin of iron,<br> And of steel of light blue color."</p> 
 <p>From the hearth arose the gray-beard,<br> Shook his heavy looks and answered:<br> "Now I know the source of iron,<br> Whence the steel and whence its evils;<br> Curses on thee, cruel iron,<br> Curses on the steel thou givest,<br> Curses on thee, tongue of evil,<br> Cursed be thy life forever!<br> Once thou wert of little value,<br> Having neither form nor beauty,<br> Neither strength nor great importance,<br> When in form of milk thou rested,<br> When for ages thou wert hidden<br> In the breasts of God's three daughters,<br> Hidden in their heaving bosoms,<br> On the borders of the cloudlets,<br> In the blue vault of the heavens.</p> 
 <p>"Thou wert once of little value,<br> Having neither form nor beauty,<br> Neither strength nor great importance,<br> When like water thou wert resting<br> On the broad back of the marshes,<br> On the steep declines of mountains,<br> When thou wert but formless matter,<br> Only dust of rusty color.</p> 
 <p>"Surely thou wert void of greatness,<br> Having neither strength nor beauty,<br> When the moose was trampling on thee,<br> When the roebuck trod upon thee,<br> When the tracks of wolves were in thee,<br> And the bear-paws scratched thy body.<br> Surely thou hadst little value<br> When the skilful Ilmarinen,<br> First of all the iron-workers,<br> Brought thee from the blackened swamp-lands,<br> Took thee to his ancient smithy,<br> Placed thee in his fiery furnace.<br> Truly thou hadst little vigor,<br> Little strength, and little danger,<br> When thou in the fire wert hissing,<br> Rolling forth like seething water,<br> From the furnace of the smithy,<br> When thou gavest oath the strongest,<br> By the furnace, by the anvil,<br> By the tongs, and by the hammer,<br> By the dwelling of the blacksmith,<br> By the fire within the furnace.</p> 
 <p>"Now forsooth thou hast grown mighty,<br> Thou canst rage in wildest fury;<br> Thou hast broken all thy pledges,<br> All thy solemn vows hast broken,<br> Like the dogs thou shamest honor,<br> Shamest both thyself and kindred,<br> Tainted all with breath of evil.<br> Tell who drove thee to this mischief,<br> Tell who taught thee all thy malice,<br> Tell who gavest thee thine evil!<br> Did thy father, or thy mother,<br> Did the eldest of thy brothers,<br> Did the youngest of thy sisters,<br> Did the worst of all thy kindred<br> Give to thee thine evil nature?<br> Not thy father, nor thy mother,<br> Not the eldest of thy brothers,<br> Not the youngest of thy sisters,<br> Not the worst of all thy kindred,<br> But thyself hast done this mischief,<br> Thou the cause of all our trouble.<br> Come and view thine evil doings,<br> And amend this flood of damage,<br> Ere I tell thy gray-haired mother,<br> Ere I tell thine aged father.<br> Great indeed a mother's anguish,<br> Great indeed a father's sorrow,<br> When a son does something evil,<br> When a child runs wild and lawless.</p> 
 <p>"Crimson streamlet, cease thy flowing<br> From the wounds of Wainamoinen;<br> Blood of ages, stop thy coursing<br> From the veins of the magician;<br> Stand like heaven's crystal pillars,<br> Stand like columns in the ocean,<br> Stand like birch-trees in the forest,<br> Like the tall reeds in the marshes,<br> Like the high-rocks on the sea-coast,<br> Stand by power of mighty magic!</p> 
 <p>"Should perforce thy will impel thee,<br> Flow thou on thine endless circuit,<br> Through the veins of Wainamoinen,<br> Through the bones, and through the muscles,<br> Through the lungs, and heart, and liver,<br> Of the mighty sage and singer;<br> Better be the food of heroes,<br> Than to waste thy strength and virtue<br> On the meadows and the woodlands,<br> And be lost in dust and ashes.<br> Flow forever in thy circle;<br> Thou must cease this crimson out-flow;<br> Stain no more the grass and flowers,<br> Stain no more these golden hill-tops,<br> Pride and beauty of our heroes.<br> In the veins of the magician,<br> In the heart of Wainamoinen,<br> Is thy rightful home and storehouse.<br> Thither now withdraw thy forces,<br> Thither hasten, swiftly flowing;<br> Flow no more as crimson currents,<br> Fill no longer crimson lakelets,<br> Must not rush like brooks in spring-tide,<br> Nor meander like the rivers.</p> 
 <p>"Cease thy flow, by word of magic,<br> Cease as did the falls of Tyrya,<br> As the rivers of Tuoni,<br> When the sky withheld her rain-drops,<br> When the sea gave up her waters,<br> In the famine of the seasons,<br> In the years of fire and torture.<br> If thou heedest not this order,<br> I shall offer other measures,<br> Know I well of other forces;<br> I shall call the Hisi irons,<br> In them I shall boil and roast thee,<br> Thus to check thy crimson flowing,<br> Thus to save the wounded hero.</p> 
 <p>"If these means be inefficient,<br> Should these measures prove unworthy,<br> I shall call omniscient Ukko,<br> Mightiest of the creators,<br> Stronger than all ancient heroes,<br> Wiser than the world-magicians;<br> He will check the crimson out-flow,<br> He will heal this wound of hatchet.</p> 
 <p>"Ukko, God of love and mercy,<br> God and Master Of the heavens,<br> Come thou hither, thou art needed,<br> Come thou quickly I beseech thee,<br> Lend thy hand to aid thy children,<br> Touch this wound with healing fingers,<br> Stop this hero's streaming life-blood,<br> Bind this wound with tender leaflets,<br> Mingle with them healing flowers,<br> Thus to check this crimson current,<br> Thus to save this great magician,<br> Save the life of Wainamoinen."</p> 
 <p>Thus at last the blood-stream ended,<br> As the magic words were spoken.<br> Then the gray-beard, much rejoicing,<br> Sent his young son to the smithy,<br> There to make a healing balsam,<br> From the herbs of tender fibre,<br> From the healing plants and flowers,<br> From the stalks secreting honey,<br> From the roots, and leaves, and blossoms.</p> 
 <p>On the way he meets an oak-tree,<br> And the oak the son addresses:<br> "Hast thou honey in thy branches,<br> Does thy sap run full of sweetness?"<br> Thus the oak-tree wisely answers:<br> "Yea, but last night dripped the honey<br> Down upon my spreading branches,<br> And the clouds their fragrance sifted,<br> Sifted honey on my leaflets,<br> From their home within the heavens."</p> 
 <p>Then the son takes oak-wood splinters,<br> Takes the youngest oak-tree branches,<br> Gathers many healing grasses,<br> Gathers many herbs and flowers,<br> Rarest herbs that grow in Northland,<br> Places them within the furnace<br> In a kettle made of copper;<br> Lets them steep and boil together,<br> Bits of bark chipped from the oak-tree,<br> Many herbs of healing virtues;<br> Steeps them one day, then a second,<br> Three long days of summer weather,<br> Days and nights in quick succession;<br> Then he tries his magic balsam,<br> Looks to see if it is ready,<br> If his remedy is finished;<br> But the balsam is unworthy.</p> 
 <p>Then he added other grasses,<br> Herbs of every healing virtue,<br> That were brought from distant nations,<br> Many hundred leagues from Northland,<br> Gathered by the wisest minstrels,<br> Thither brought by nine enchanters.<br> Three days more be steeped the balsam,<br> Three nights more the fire be tended,<br> Nine the days and nights be watched it,<br> Then again be tried the ointment,<br> Viewed it carefully and tested,<br> Found at last that it was ready,<br> Found the magic balm was finished.</p> 
 <p>Near by stood a branching birch-tree.<br> On the border of the meadow,<br> Wickedly it had been broken,<br> Broken down by evil Hisi;<br> Quick he takes his balm of healing,<br> And anoints the broken branches,<br> Rubs the balsam in the fractures,<br> Thus addresses then the birch-tree:<br> "With this balsam I anoint thee,<br> With this salve thy wounds I cover,<br> Cover well thine injured places;<br> Now the birch-tree shall recover,<br> Grow more beautiful than ever."</p> 
 <p>True, the birch-tree soon recovered,<br> Grew more beautiful than ever,<br> Grew more uniform its branches,<br> And its bole more strong and stately.<br> Thus it was be tried the balsam,<br> Thus the magic salve he tested,<br> Touched with it the splintered sandstone,<br> Touched the broken blocks of granite,<br> Touched the fissures in the mountains,<br> And the broken parts united,<br> All the fragments grew together.</p> 
 <p>Then the young boy quick returning<br> With the balsam he had finished,<br> To the gray-beard gave the ointment,<br> And the boy these measures uttered<br> "Here I bring the balm of healing,<br> Wonderful the salve I bring thee;<br> It will join the broken granite,<br> Make the fragments grow together,<br> Heat the fissures in the mountains,<br> And restore the injured birch-tree."</p> 
 <p>With his tongue the old man tested,<br> Tested thus the magic balsam,<br> Found the remedy effective,<br> Found the balm had magic virtues;<br> Then anointed he the minstrel,<br> Touched the wounds of Wainamoinen,<br> Touched them with his magic balsam,<br> With the balm of many virtues;<br> Speaking words of ancient wisdom,<br> These the words the gray-beard uttered:<br> "Do not walk in thine own virtue,<br> Do not work in thine own power,<br> Walk in strength of thy Creator;<br> Do not speak in thine own wisdom,<br> Speak with tongue of mighty Ukko.<br> In my mouth, if there be sweetness,<br> It has come from my Creator;<br> If my bands are filled with beauty,<br> All the beauty comes from Ukko."</p> 
 <p>When the wounds had been anointed,<br> When the magic salve had touched them,<br> Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<br> Suffered fearful pain and anguish,<br> Sank upon the floor in torment,<br> Turning one way, then another,<br> Sought for rest and found it nowhere,<br> Till his pain the gray-beard banished,<br> Banished by the aid of magic,<br> Drove away his killing torment<br> To the court of all our trouble,<br> To the highest hill of torture,<br> To the distant rocks and ledges,<br> To the evil-bearing mountains,<br> To the realm of wicked Hisi.<br> Then be took some silken fabric,<br> Quick he tore the silk asunder,<br> Making equal strips for wrapping,<br> Tied the ends with silken ribbons,<br> Making thus a healing bandage;<br> Then he wrapped with skilful fingers<br> Wainamoinen's knee and ankle,<br> Wrapped the wounds of the magician,<br> And this prayer the gray-beard uttered<br> "Ukko's fabric is the bandage,<br> Ukko's science is the surgeon,<br> These have served the wounded hero,<br> Wrapped the wounds of the magician.<br> Look upon us, God of mercy,<br> Come and guard us, kind Creator,<br> And protect us from all evil!<br> Guide our feet lest they may stumble,<br> Guard our lives from every danger,<br> From the wicked wilds of Hisi."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br> Felt the mighty aid of magic,<br> Felt the help of gracious Ukko,<br> Straightway stronger grew in body,<br> Straightway were the wounds united,<br> Quick the fearful pain departed.<br> Strong and hardy grew the hero,<br> Straightway walked in perfect freedom,<br> Turned his knee in all directions,<br> Knowing neither pain nor trouble.</p> 
 <p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Raised his eyes to high Jumala,<br> Looked with gratitude to heaven,<br> Looked on high, in joy and gladness,<br> Then addressed omniscient Ukko,<br> This the prayer the minstrel uttered:<br> "O be praised, thou God of mercy,<br> Let me praise thee, my Creator,<br> Since thou gavest me assistance,<br> And vouchsafed me thy protection,<br> Healed my wounds and stilled mine anguish,<br> Banished all my pain and trouble,<br> Caused by Iron and by Hisi.<br> O, ye people of Wainola,<br> People of this generation,<br> And the folk of future ages,<br> Fashion not in emulation,<br> River boat, nor ocean shallop,<br> Boasting of its fine appearance,<br> God alone can work completion,<br> Give to cause its perfect ending,<br> Never hand of man can find it,<br> Never can the hero give it,<br> Ukko is the only Master."</p>
