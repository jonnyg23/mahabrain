 <p>WAINAMOINEN, ancient minstrel,<br> Long reflecting, sang these measures:<br> "It is now the time befitting<br> To awaken joy and gladness,<br> Time for me to touch the harp-strings,<br> Time to sing the songs primeval,<br> In these spacious halls and mansions,<br> In these homes of Kalevala;<br> But, alas! my harp lies hidden,<br> Sunk upon the deep-sea's bottom,<br> To the salmon's hiding-places,<br> To the dwellings of the whiting,<br> To the people of Wellamo,<br> Where the Northland-pike assemble.<br> Nevermore will I regain it,<br> Ahto never will return it,<br> Joy and music gone forever!</p> 
 <p>"O thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Forge for me a rake of iron,<br> Thickly set the teeth of copper,<br> Many fathoms long the handle;<br> Make a rake to search the waters,<br> Search the broad-sea to the bottom,<br> Rake the weeds and reeds together,<br> Rake them to the curving sea-shore,<br> That I may regain my treasure,<br> May regain my harp of fish-bow<br> From the whiting's place of resting,<br> From the caverns of the salmon,<br> From the castles of Wellamo."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon young Ilmarinen,<br> The eternal metal-worker,<br> Forges well a rake of iron,<br> Teeth in length a hundred fathoms,<br> And a thousand long the handle,<br> Thickly sets the teeth of copper.<br> Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<br> Takes the rake of magic metals,<br> Travels but a little distance,<br> To the cylinders of oak-wood,<br> To the copper-banded rollers,<br> Where be finds two ships awaiting,<br> One was new, the other ancient.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<br> Thus addressed the new-made vessel:<br> "Go, thou boat of master-magic,<br> Hasten to the willing waters,<br> Speed away upon the blue-sea,<br> And without the hand to move thee;<br> Let my will impel thee seaward."</p> 
 <p>Quick the boat rolled to the billows<br> On the cylinders of oak-wood,<br> Quick descended to the waters,<br> Willingly obeyed his master.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, the magician,<br> Then began to rake the sea-beds,<br> Raked up all the water-flowers,<br> Bits of broken reeds and rushes,<br> Deep-sea shells and colored pebbles,<br> Did not find his harp of fish-bone,<br> Lost forever to Wainola!</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the ancient minstrel<br> Left the waters, homeward hastened,<br> Cap pulled clown upon his forehead,<br> Sang this song with sorrow laden:<br> "Nevermore shall I awaken<br> With my harp-strings, joy and gladness!<br> Nevermore will Wainamoinen<br> Charm the people of the Northland<br> With the harp of his creation!<br> Nevermore my songs will echo<br> O'er the hills of Kalevala!"</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the ancient singer<br> Went lamenting through the forest,<br> Wandered through the sighing pine-woods,<br> Heard the wailing of a birch-tree,<br> Heard a juniper complaining;<br> Drawing nearer, waits and listens,<br> Thus the birch-tree he addresses:<br> "Wherefore, brother, art thou weeping,<br> Merry birch enrobed in silver,<br> Silver-leaved and silver-tasselled?<br> Art thou shedding tears of sorrow,<br> Since thou art not led to battle,<br> Not enforced to war with wizards?<br> Wisely does the birch make answer:<br> "This the language of the many,<br> Others speak as thou, unjustly,<br> That I only live in pleasure,<br> That my silver leaves and tassels<br> Only whisper my rejoicings;<br> That I have no cares, no sorrows,<br> That I have no hours unhappy,<br> Knowing neither pain nor trouble.<br> I am weeping for my smallness,<br> Am lamenting for my weakness,<br> Have no sympathy, no pity,<br> Stand here motionless for ages,<br> Stand alone in fen and forest,<br> In these woodlands vast and joyless.<br> Others hope for coming summers,<br> For the beauties of the spring-time;<br> I, alas! a helpless birch-tree,<br> Dread the changing of the seasons,<br> I must give my bark to, others,<br> Lose my leaves and silken tassels.<br> Men come the Suomi children,<br> Peel my bark and drink my life-blood:<br> Wicked shepherds in the summer,<br> Come and steal my belt of silver,<br> Of my bark make berry-baskets,<br> Dishes make, and cups for drinking.<br> Oftentimes the Northland maidens<br> Cut my tender limbs for birch-brooms,'<br> Bind my twigs and silver tassels<br> Into brooms to sweep their cabins;<br> Often have the Northland heroes<br> Chopped me into chips for burning;<br> Three times in the summer season,<br> In the pleasant days of spring-time,<br> Foresters have ground their axes<br> On my silver trunk and branches,<br> Robbed me of my life for ages;<br> This my spring-time joy and pleasure,<br> This my happiness in summer,<br> And my winter days no better!<br> When I think of former troubles,<br> Sorrow settles on my visage,<br> And my face grows white with anguish;<br> Often do the winds of winter<br> And the hoar-frost bring me sadness,<br> Blast my tender leaves and tassels,<br> Bear my foliage to others,<br> Rob me of my silver raiment,<br> Leave me naked on the mountain,<br> Lone, and helpless, and disheartened!"<br> Spake the good, old Wainamoinen:<br> "Weep no longer, sacred birch-tree,<br> Mourn no more, my friend and brother,<br> Thou shalt have a better fortune;<br> I will turn thy grief to joyance,<br> Make thee laugh and sing with gladness."</p> 
 <p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Made a harp from sacred birch-wood,<br> Fashioned in the days of summer,<br> Beautiful the harp of magic,<br> By the master's hand created<br> On the fog-point in the Big-Sea,<br> On the island forest-covered,<br> Fashioned from the birch the archings,<br> And the frame-work from the aspen.<br> These the words of the magician:<br> "All the archings are completed,<br> And the frame is fitly finished;<br> Whence the hooks and pins for tuning,<br> That the harp may sing in concord?"</p> 
 <p>Near the way-side grew an oak-tree,<br> Skyward grew with equal branches,<br> On each twig an acorn growing,<br> Golden balls upon each acorn,<br> On each ball a singing cuckoo.<br> As each cuckoo's call resounded,<br> Five the notes of song that issued<br> From the songster's throat of joyance;<br> From each throat came liquid music,<br> Gold and silver for the master,<br> Flowing to the hills and hillocks,<br> To the silvery vales and mountains;<br> Thence he took the merry harp-pins,<br> That the harp might play in concord.<br> Spake again wise Wainamoinen:<br> "I the pins have well completed,<br> Still the harp is yet unfinished;<br> Now I need five strings for playing,<br> Where shall I procure the harp-strings?"<br> Then the ancient bard and minstrel<br> Journeyed through the fen and forest.<br> On a hillock sat a maiden,<br> Sat a virgin of the valley;<br> And the maiden was not weeping,<br> Joyful was the sylvan daughter,<br> Singing with the woodland songsters,<br> That the eventide might hasten,<br> In the hope that her beloved<br> Would the sooner sit beside her.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and trusted,<br> Hastened, tripping to the virgin,<br> Asked her for her golden ringleta,<br> These the words of the magician.<br> "Give me, maiden, of thy tresses,<br> Give to me thy golden ringlets;<br> I will weave them into harp-strings,<br> To the joy of Wainamoinen,<br> To the pleasure of his people."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the forest-maiden<br> Gave the singer of her tresses,<br> Gave him of her golden ringlets,<br> And of these he made the harp-strings.<br> Sources of eternal pleasure<br> To the people of Wainola.</p> 
 <p>Thus the sacred harp is finished,<br> And the minstrel, Wainamoinen,<br> Sits upon the rock of joyance,<br> Takes the harp within his fingers,<br> Turns the arch up, looking skyward;<br> With his knee the arch supporting,<br> Sets the strings in tuneful order,<br> Runs his fingers o'er the harp-strings,<br> And the notes of pleasure follow.<br> Straightway ancient Wainamoinen,<br> The eternal wisdom-singer,<br> Plays upon his harp of birch-wood.<br> Far away is heard the music,<br> Wide the harp of joy re-echoes;<br> Mountains dance and valleys listen,<br> Flinty rocks are tom asunder,<br> Stones are hurled upon the waters,<br> Pebbles swim upon the Big-Sea,<br> Pines and lindens laugh with pleasure,<br> Alders skip about the heather,<br> And the aspen sways in concord.</p> 
 <p>All the daughters of Wainola<br> Straightway leave their shining needles,<br> Hasten forward like the current,<br> Speed along like rapid rivers,<br> That they may enjoy and wonder.<br> Laugh the younger men and maidens,<br> Happy-hearted are the matrons<br> Flying swift to bear the playing,<br> To enjoy the common pleasure,<br> Hear the harp of Wainamoinen.<br> Aged men and bearded seniors,<br> Gray-haired mothers with their daughters<br> Stop in wonderment and listen.<br> Creeps the babe in full enjoyment<br> As he hears the magic singing,<br> Hears the harp of Wainamoinen.<br> All of Northland stops in wonder,<br> Speaks in unison these measures:<br> "Never have we heard such playing,<br> Never heard such strains of music,<br> Never since the earth was fashioned,<br> As the songs of this magician,<br> This sweet singer, Wainamoinen!"</p> 
 <p>Far and wide the sweet tones echo,<br> Ring throughout the seven hamlets,<br> O'er the seven islands echo;<br> Every creature of the Northland<br> Hastens forth to look and listen,<br> Listen to the songs of gladness,<br> To the harp of Wainamoinen.<br> All the beasts that haunt the woodlands<br> Fall upon their knees and wonder<br> At the playing of the minstrel,<br> At his miracles of concord.<br> All the songsters of the forests<br> Perch upon the trembling branches,<br> Singing to the wondrous playing<br> Of the harp of Wainamoinen.<br> All the dwellers of the waters<br> Leave their beds, and eaves, and grottoes,<br> Swim against the shore and listen<br> To the playing of the minstrel,<br> To the harp of Wainamoinen.<br> All the little things in nature,<br> Rise from earth, and fall from ether,<br> Come and listen to the music,<br> To the notes of the enchanter,<br> To the songs of the magician,<br> To the harp of Wainamoinen.</p> 
 <p>Plays the singer of the Northland,<br> Plays in miracles of sweetness,<br> Plays one day, and then a second,<br> Plays the third from morn till even;<br> Plays within the halls and cabins,<br> In the dwellings of his people,<br> Till the floors and ceilings echo,<br> Till resound the roofs of pine-wood,<br> Till the windows speak and tremble,<br> Till the portals echo joyance,<br> And the hearth-stones sing in pleasure.<br> As he journeys through the forest,<br> As he wanders through the woodlands,<br> Pine and sorb-tree bid him welcome,<br> Birch and willow bend obeisance,<br> Beech and aspen bow submission;<br> And the linden waves her branches<br> To the measure of his playing,<br> To the notes of the magician.<br> As the minstrel plays and wanders,<br> Sings upon the mead and heather,<br> Glen and hill his songs re-echo,<br> Ferns and flowers laugh in pleasure,<br> And the shrubs attune their voices<br> To the music of the harp-strings,<br> To the songs of Wainamoinen.</p>
