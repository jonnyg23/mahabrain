 <p>SPAKE the ancient Lemminkainen<br> To the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "Give to me thy lovely daughter,<br> Bring me now thy winsome maiden,<br> Bring the best of Lapland virgins,<br> Fairest virgin of the Northland."</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Answered thus the wild magician:<br> "I shall never give my daughter,<br> Never give my fairest maiden,<br> Not the best one, nor the worst one,<br> Not the largest, nor the smallest;<br> Thou hast now one wife-companion,<br> Thou has taken hence one hostess,<br> Carried off the fair Kyllikki."</p> 
 <p>This is Lemminkainen's answer:<br> To my home I took Kyllikki,<br> To my cottage on the island,<br> To my entry-gates and kindred;<br> Now I wish a better hostess,<br> Straightway bring thy fairest daughter,<br> Worthiest of all thy virgins,<br> Fairest maid with sable tresses."<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "Never will I give my daughter<br> To a hero false and worthless,<br> To a minstrel vain and evil;<br> Therefore, pray thou for my maiden,<br> Therefore, woo the sweet-faced flower,<br> When thou bringest me the wild-moose<br> From the Hisi fields and forests."</p> 
 <p>Then the artful Lemminkainen<br> Deftly whittled out his javelins,<br> Quickly made his leathern bow-string,<br> And prepared his bow and arrows,<br> And soliloquized as follows:<br> "Now my javelins are made ready,<br> All my arrows too are ready,<br> And my oaken cross-bow bended,<br> But my snow-shoes are not builded,<br> Who will make me worthy snow-shoes?"</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen, grave and thoughtful,<br> Long reflected, well considered,<br> Where the snow-shoes could be fashioned,<br> Who the artist that could make them;<br> Hastened to the Kauppi-smithy,<br> To the smithy of Lylikki,<br> Thus addressed the snow-shoe artist:<br> "O thou skilful Woyalander,<br> Kauppi, ablest smith of Lapland,<br> Make me quick two worthy snow-shoes,<br> Smooth them well and make them hardy,<br> That in Tapio the wild-moose,<br> Roaming through the Hisi-forests,<br> I may catch and bring to Louhi,<br> As a dowry for her daughter."</p> 
 <p>Then Lylikki thus made answer,<br> Kauppi gave this prompt decision:<br> "Lemminkainen, reckless minstrel,<br> Thou wilt hunt in vain the wild-moose,<br> Thou wilt catch but pain and torture,<br> In the Hisi fens and forests."</p> 
 <p>Little heeding, Lemminkainen<br> Spake these measures to Lylikki<br> "Make for me the worthy snow-shoes,<br> Quickly work and make them ready;<br> Go I will and catch the blue-moose<br> Where in Tapio it browses,<br> In the Hisi woods and snow-fields."</p> 
 <p>Then Lylikki, snow-shoe-maker,<br> Ancient Kauppi, master artist,<br> Whittled in the fall his show-shoes,<br> Smoothed them in the winter evenings,<br> One day working on the runners,<br> All the next day making stick-rings,<br> Till at last the shoes were finished,<br> And the workmanship was perfect.<br> Then he fastened well the shoe-straps,<br> Smooth as adder's skin the woodwork,<br> Soft as fox-fur were the stick-rings;<br> Oiled he well his wondrous snow-shoes<br> With the tallow of the reindeer;<br> When he thus soliloquizes,<br> These the accents of Lylikki:<br> "Is there any youth in Lapland,<br> Any in this generation,<br> That can travel in these snow-shoes,<br> That can move the lower sections?"</p> 
 <p>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<br> Full of hope, and life, and vigor:<br> Surely there is one in Lapland.<br> In this rising generation,<br> That can travel in these snow-shoes,<br> That the right and left can manage."</p> 
 <p>To his back he tied the quiver,<br> Placed the bow upon his shoulder,<br> With both hands he grasped his snow-cane,<br> Speaking meanwhile words as follow:<br> "There is nothing in the woodlands,<br> Nothing in the world of Ukko,<br> Nothing underneath the heavens,<br> In the uplands, in the lowlands,<br> Nothing in the snow-fields running,<br> Not a fleet deer of the forest,<br> That could not be overtaken<br> With the snow-shoes of Lylikki,<br> With the strides of Lemminkainen."</p> 
 <p>Wicked Hisi heard these measures,<br> Juntas listened to their echoes;<br> Straightway Hisi called the wild-moose,<br> Juutas fashioned soon a reindeer,<br> And the head was made of punk-wood,<br> Horns of naked willow branches,<br> Feet were furnished by the rushes,<br> And the legs, by reeds aquatic,<br> Veins were made of withered grasses,<br> Eyes, from daisies of the meadows,<br> Ears were formed of water-flowers,<br> And the skin of tawny fir-bark,<br> Out of sappy wood, the muscles,<br> Fair and fleet, the magic reindeer.</p> 
 <p>Juutas thus instructs the wild-moose,<br> These the words of wicked Hisi:<br> Flee away, thou moose of Juutas,<br> Flee away, thou Hisi-reindeer,<br> Like the winds, thou rapid courser,<br> To the snow-homes of the ranger,<br> To the ridges of the mountains,<br> To the snow-capped hills of Lapland,<br> That thy hunter may be worn out,<br> Thy pursuer be tormented,<br> Lemminkainen be exhausted."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the Hisi-reindeer,<br> Juutas-moose with branching antlers,<br> Fleetly ran through fen and forest,<br> Over Lapland's hills and valleys,<br> Through the open fields and court-yards,<br> Through the penthouse doors and gate-ways,<br> Turning over tubs of water,<br> Threw the kettles from the fire-pole,<br> And upset the dishes cooking.<br> Then arose a fearful uproar,<br> In the court-yards of Pohyola,<br> Lapland-dogs began their barking,<br> Lapland-children cried in terror,<br> Lapland-women roared with laughter,<br> And the Lapland-heroes shouted.</p> 
 <p>Fleetly followed Lemminkainen,<br> Followed fast, and followed faster,<br> Hastened on behind the wild-moose,<br> Over swamps and through the woodlands,<br> Over snow-fields vast and pathless,<br> Over high uprising mountains,<br> Fire out-shooting from his runners,<br> Smoke arising from his snow-cane:<br> Could not hear the wild-moose bounding,<br> Could not sight the flying fleet-foot;<br> Glided on through field and forest,<br> Glided over lakes and rivers,<br> Over lands beyond the smooth-sea,<br> Through the desert plains of Hisi,<br> Glided o'er the plains of Kalma,<br> Through the kingdom of Tuoni,<br> To the end of Kalma's empire,<br> Where the jaws of Death stand open,<br> Where the head of Kalma lowers,<br> Ready to devour the stranger,<br> To devour wild Lemminkainen;<br> But Tuoni cannot reach him,<br> Kalma cannot overtake him.</p> 
 <p>Distant woods are yet untraveled,<br> Far away a woodland corner<br> Stands unsearched by Kaukomieli,<br> In the North's extensive, borders,<br> In the realm of dreary Lapland.<br> Now the hero, on his snow-shoes,<br> Hastens to the distant woodlands,<br> There to hunt the moose of Piru.<br> As he nears the woodland corner,<br> There he bears a frightful uproar,<br> From the Northland's distant borders,<br> From the dreary fields of Lapland,<br> Hears the dogs as they are barking,<br> Hears the children loudly screaming,<br> Hears the laughter or the women,<br> Hears the shouting of the heroes.<br> Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<br> Hastens forward on his snow-shoes,<br> To the place where dogs are barking,<br> To the distant woods of Lapland.</p> 
 <p>When the reckless Kaukomieli<br> Had approached this Hisi corner,<br> Straightway he began to question:<br> "Why this laughter or the women,<br> Why the screaming of the children,<br> Why the shouting of the heroes,<br> Why this barking of the watch-dogs?<br> This reply was promptly given:<br> "This the reason for this uproar,<br> Women laughing, children screaming,<br> Heroes shouting, watch-dogs barking<br> Hisi's moose came running hither,<br> Hither came the Piru-Reindeer,<br> Hither came with hoofs of silver,<br> Through the open fields and court-yards,<br> Through the penthouse doors and gate-ways,<br> Turning over tubs or water,<br> Threw the kettles from the fire-pole,<br> And upset the dishes cooking."</p> 
 <p>Then the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Straightway summoned all his courage,<br> Pushed ahead his mighty snow-shoes,<br> Swift as adders in the stubble,<br> Levelled bushes in the marshes,<br> Like the swift and fiery serpents,<br> Spake these words of magic import,<br> Keeping balance with his snow-staff:<br> Come thou might of Lapland heroes,<br> Bring to me the moose of Juutas;<br> Come thou strength of Lapland-women,<br> And prepare the boiling caldron;<br> Come, thou might of Lapland children,<br> Bring together fire and fuel;<br> Come, thou strength of Lapland-kettles,<br> Help to boil the Hisi wild-moose."</p> 
 <p>Then with mighty force and courage,<br> Lemminkainen hastened onward,<br> Striking backward, shooting forward;<br> With a long sweep of his snow-shoe,<br> Disappeared from view the hero;<br> With the second, shooting further,<br> Was the hunter out of hearing,<br> With the third the hero glided<br> On the shoulders of the wild-moose;<br> Took a pole of stoutest oak-wood,<br> Took some bark-strings from the willow,<br> Wherewithal to bind the moose-deer,<br> Bind him to his oaken hurdle.<br> To the moose he spake as follows:<br> "Here remain, thou moose of Juutas<br> Skip about, my bounding courser,<br> In my hurdle jump and frolic,<br> Captive from the fields of Piru,<br> From the Hisi glens and mountains."</p> 
 <p>Then he stroked the captured wild-moose,<br> Patted him upon his forehead,<br> Spake again in measured accents:<br> "I would like awhile to linger,<br> I would love to rest a moment<br> In the cottage of my maiden,<br> With my virgin, young and lovely."</p> 
 <p>Then the Hisi-moose grew angry,<br> Stamped his feet and shook his antlers,<br> Spake these words to Lemminkainen:<br> "Surely Lempo soon will got thee,<br> Shouldst thou sit beside the maiden,<br> Shouldst thou linger by the virgin."</p> 
 <p>Now the wild-moose stamps and rushes,<br> Tears in two the bands of willow,<br> Breaks the oak-wood pole in pieces,<br> And upturns the hunter's hurdle,<br> Quickly leaping from his captor,<br> Bounds away with strength of freedom,<br> Over hills and over lowlands,<br> Over swamps and over snow-fields,<br> Over mountains clothed in heather,<br> That the eye may not behold him,<br> Nor the hero's ear detect him.</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the mighty hunter<br> Angry grows, and much disheartened,<br> Starts again the moose to capture,<br> Gliding off behind the courser.<br> With his might he plunges forward;<br> At the instep breaks his snow-shoe,<br> Breaks the runners into fragments,<br> On the mountings breaks his javelins,<br> In the centre breaks his snow-staff,<br> And the moose bounds on before him,<br> Through the Hisi-woods and snow-fields,<br> Out of reach of Lemminkainen.</p> 
 <p>Then the reckless Kaukomieli<br> Looked with bended head, ill-humored,<br> One by one upon the fragments,<br> Speaking words of ancient wisdom:<br> "Northland hunters, never, never,<br> Go defiant to thy forests,<br> In the Hisi vales and mountains,<br> There to hunt the moose of Juutas,<br> Like this senseless, reckless hero;<br> I have wrecked my magic snow-shoes,<br> Ruined too my useful snow-staff,<br> And my javelins I have broken,<br> While the wild-moose runs in safety<br> Through the Hisi fields and forests."</p>
