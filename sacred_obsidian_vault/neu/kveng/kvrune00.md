 <p>MASTERED by desire impulsive,<br> By a mighty inward urging,<br> I am ready now for singing,<br> Ready to begin the chanting<br> Of our nation's ancient folk-song<br> Handed down from by-gone ages.<br> In my mouth the words are melting,<br> From my lips the tones are gliding,<br> From my tongue they wish to hasten;<br> When my willing teeth are parted,<br> When my ready mouth is opened,<br> Songs of ancient wit and wisdom<br> Hasten from me not unwilling.</p> 
 <p>Golden friend, and dearest brother,<br> Brother dear of mine in childhood,<br> Come and sing with me the stories,<br> Come and chant with me the legends,<br> Legends of the times forgotten,<br> Since we now are here together,<br> Come together from our roamings.<br> Seldom do we come for singing,<br> Seldom to the one, the other,<br> O'er this cold and cruel country,<br> O'er the poor soil of the Northland.<br> Let us clasp our hands together<br> That we thus may best remember.<br> Join we now in merry singing,<br> Chant we now the oldest folk-lore,<br> That the dear ones all may hear them,<br> That the well-inclined may hear them,<br> Of this rising generation.<br> These are words in childhood taught me,<br> Songs preserved from distant ages,<br> Legends they that once were taken<br> From the belt of Wainamoinen,<br> From the forge of Ilmarinen,<br> From the sword of Kaukomieli,<br> From the bow of Youkahainen,<br> From the pastures of the Northland,<br> From the meads of Kalevala.<br> These my dear old father sang me<br> When at work with knife and hatchet<br> These my tender mother taught me<br> When she twirled the flying spindle,<br> When a child upon the matting<br> By her feet I rolled and tumbled.</p> 
 <p>Incantations were not wanting<br> Over Sampo and o'er Louhi,<br> Sampo growing old in singing,<br> Louhi ceasing her enchantment.<br> In the songs died wise Wipunen,<br> At the games died Lemminkainen.<br> There are many other legends,<br> Incantations that were taught me,<br> That I found along the wayside,<br> Gathered in the fragrant copses,<br> Blown me from the forest branches,<br> Culled among the plumes of pine-trees,<br> Scented from the vines and flowers,<br> Whispered to me as I followed<br> Flocks in land of honeyed meadows,<br> Over hillocks green and golden,<br> After sable-haired Murikki,<br> And the many-colored Kimmo.<br> Many runes the cold has told me,<br> Many lays the rain has brought me,<br> Other songs the winds have sung me;<br> Many birds from many forests,<br> Oft have sung me lays n concord<br> Waves of sea, and ocean billows,<br> Music from the many waters,<br> Music from the whole creation,<br> Oft have been my guide and master.<br> Sentences the trees created,<br> Rolled together into bundles,<br> Moved them to my ancient dwelling,<br> On the sledges to my cottage,<br> Tied them to my garret rafters,<br> Hung them on my dwelling-portals,<br> Laid them in a chest of boxes,<br> Boxes lined with shining copper.<br> Long they lay within my dwelling<br> Through the chilling winds of winter,<br> In my dwelling-place for ages.</p> 
 <p>Shall I bring these songs together<br> From the cold and frost collect them?<br> Shall I bring this nest of boxes,<br> Keepers of these golden legends,<br> To the table in my cabin,<br> Underneath the painted rafters,<br> In this house renowned and ancient?<br> Shall I now these boxes open,<br> Boxes filled with wondrous stories?<br> Shall I now the end unfasten<br> Of this ball of ancient wisdom,<br> These ancestral lays unravel?<br> Let me sing an old-time legend,<br> That shall echo forth the praises<br> Of the beer that I have tasted,<br> Of the sparkling beer of barley.<br> Bring to me a foaming goblet<br> Of the barley of my fathers,<br> Lest my singing grow too weary,<br> Singing from the water only.<br> Bring me too a cup of strong-beer,<br> It will add to our enchantment,<br> To the pleasure of the evening,<br> Northland's long and dreary evening,<br> For the beauty of the day-dawn,<br> For the pleasure of the morning,<br> The beginning of the new-day.</p> 
 <p>Often I have heard them chanting,<br> Often I have heard them singing,<br> That the nights come to us singly,<br> That the Moon beams on us singly,<br> That the Sun shines on us singly;<br> Singly also, Wainamoinen,<br> The renowned and wise enchanter,<br> Born from everlasting Ether<br> Of his mother, Ether's daughter.</p>
