 <p>LOUHI, hostess of the Northland,<br> Heard the word in Sariola,<br> Heard the Dews with ears of envy,<br> That Wainola lives and prospers,<br> That Osmoinen's wealth increases,<br> Through the ruins of the Sampo,<br> Ruins of the lid in colors.<br> Thereupon her wrath she kindled,<br> Well considered, long reflected,<br> How she might prepare destruction<br> For the people of Wainola,<br> For the tribes of Kalevala.</p> 
 <p>With this prayer she turns to Ukko,<br> Thus entreats the god of thunder:<br> "Ukko, thou who art in heaven,<br> Help me slay Wainola's people<br> With thine iron-hail of justice,<br> With thine arrows tipped with lightning,<br> Or from sickness let them perish,<br> Let them die the death deserving;<br> Let the men die in the forest,<br> And the women in the hurdles!"</p> 
 <p>The blind daughter of Tuoni,<br> Old and wicked witch, Lowyatar,<br> Worst of all the Death-land women,<br> Ugliest of Mana's children,<br> Source of all the host of evils,<br> All the ills and plagues of Northland,<br> Black in heart, and soul, and visage,<br> Evil genius of Lappala,<br> Made her couch along the wayside,<br> On the fields of sin and sorrow;<br> Turned her back upon the East-wind,<br> To the source of stormy weather,<br> To the chilling winds of morning.</p> 
 <p>When the winds arose at evening,<br> Heavy-laden grew Lowyatar,<br> Through the east-wind's impregnation,<br> On the sand-plains, vast and barren.<br> Long she bore her weight of trouble,<br> Many morns she suffered anguish,<br> Till at last she leaves the desert,<br> Makes her couch within the forest,<br> On a rock upon the mountain;<br> Labors long to leave her burden<br> By the mountain-springs and fountains,<br> By the crystal waters flowing,<br> By the sacred stream and whirlpool,<br> By the cataract and fire-stream;<br> But her burden does not lighten.<br> Blind Lowyatar, old and ugly,<br> Knew not where to look for succor,<br> How to lose her weight of sorrow,<br> Where to lay her evil children.</p> 
 <p>Spake the Highest from the heavens,<br> These, the words of mighty Ukko:<br> "Is a triangle in Swamp-field,<br> Near the border of the ocean,<br> In the never-pleasant Northland,<br> In the dismal Sariola;<br> Thither go and lay thy burden,<br> In Pohyola leave thine offspring;<br> There the Laplanders await thee,<br> There will bid thy children welcome."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the blind Lowyatar,<br> Blackest daughter of Tuoni,<br> Mana's old and ugly maiden,<br> Hastened on her journey northward,<br> To the chambers of Pohyola,<br> To the ancient halls of Louhi,<br> There to lay her heavy burdens,<br> There to leave her evil offspring.</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br> Old and toothless witch of Pohya,<br> Takes Lowyatar to her mansion;<br> Silently she leads the stranger<br> To the bath-rooms of her chamber,<br> Pours the foaming beer of barley,<br> Lubricates the bolts and hinges,<br> That their movements may be secret,<br> Speaks these measures to Lowyatar:<br> "Faithful daughter of Creation,<br> Thou most beautiful of women,<br> First and last of ancient mothers,<br> Hasten on thy feet to ocean,<br> To the ocean's centre hasten,<br> Take the sea-foam from the waters,<br> Take the honey of the mermaids,<br> And anoint thy sacred members,<br> That thy labors may be lightened.</p> 
 <p>"Should all this be unavailing,<br> Ukko, thou who art in heaven,<br> Hasten hither, thou art needed,<br> Come thou to thy child in trouble,<br> Help the helpless and afflicted.<br> Take thy golden-colored sceptre,<br> Charm away opposing forces,<br> Strike the pillars of the stronghold,<br> Open all resisting portals,<br> That the great and small may wander<br> From their ancient hiding-places,<br> Through the courts and halls of freedom."</p> 
 <p>Finally the blind Lowyatar,<br> Wicked witch of Tuonela,<br> Was delivered of her burden,<br> Laid her offspring in the cradle,<br> Underneath the golden covers.<br> Thus at last were born nine children,<br> In an evening of the summer,<br> From Lowyatar, blind and ancient,<br> Ugly daughter of Tuoni.<br> Faithfully the virgin-mother<br> Guards her children in affection,<br> As an artist loves and nurses<br> What his skillful hands have fashioned.</p> 
 <p>Thus Lowyatar named her offspring,<br> Colic, Pleurisy, and Fever,<br> Ulcer, Plague, and dread Consumption,<br> Gout, Sterility, and Cancer.<br> And the worst of these nine children<br> Blind Lowyatar quickly banished,<br> Drove away as an enchanter,<br> To bewitch the lowland people,<br> To engender strife and envy.</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Banished all the other children<br> To the fog-point in the ocean,<br> To the island forest-covered;<br> Banished all the fatal creatures,<br> Gave these wicked sons of evil<br> To the people of Wainola,<br> To the youth of Kalevala,<br> For the Kalew-tribe's destruction.<br> Quick Wainola's maidens sicken,<br> Young and aged, men and heroes,<br> With the worst of all diseases,<br> With diseases new and nameless;<br> Sick and dying is Wainola.</p> 
 <p>Thereupon old Wainamoinen,<br> Wise and wonderful enchanter,<br> Hastens to his people's rescue,<br> Hastens to a war with Mana,<br> To a conflict with Tuoni,<br> To destroy the evil children<br> Of the evil maid, Lowyatar.<br> Wainamoinen heats the bath-rooms,<br> Heats the blocks of healing-sandstone<br> With the magic wood of Northland,<br> Gathered by the sacred river;<br> Water brings in covered buckets<br> From the cataract and whirlpool;<br> Brooms he brings enwrapped with ermine,<br> Well the bath the healer cleanses,<br> Softens well the brooms of birch-wood;<br> Then a honey-heat be wakens,<br> Fills the rooms with healing vapors,<br> From the virtue of the pebbles<br> Glowing in the heat of magic,<br> Thus he speaks in supplication:<br> "Come, O Ukko, to my rescue,<br> God of mercy, lend thy presence,<br> Give these vapor-baths new virtues,<br> Grant to them the powers of healing,<br> And restore my dying people;<br> Drive away these fell diseases,<br> Banish them to the unworthy,<br> Let the holy sparks enkindle,<br> Keep this heat in healing limits,<br> That it may not harm thy children,<br> May not injure the afflicted.<br> When I pour the sacred waters<br> On the heated blocks of sandstone,<br> May the water turn to honey<br> Laden with the balm of healing.<br> Let the stream of magic virtues<br> Ceaseless flow to all my children,<br> From this bath enrolled in sea-moss,<br> That the guiltless may not suffer,<br> That my tribe-folk may not perish,<br> Till the Master gives permission,<br> Until Ukko sends his minions,<br> Sends diseases of his choosing,<br> To destroy my trusting people.<br> Let the hostess of Pohyola,<br> Wicked witch that sent these troubles,<br> Suffer from a gnawing conscience,<br> Suffer for her evil doings.<br> Should the Master of Wainola<br> Lose his magic skill and weaken,<br> Should he prove of little service<br> To deliver from misfortune,<br> To deliver from these evils,<br> Then may Ukko be our healer,<br> Be our strength and wise Physician.</p> 
 <p>"Omnipresent God of mercy,<br> Thou who livest in the heavens,<br> Hasten hither, thou art needed,<br> Hasten to thine ailing children,<br> To observe their cruel tortures,<br> To dispel these fell diseases,<br> Drive destruction from our borders.<br> Bring with thee thy mighty fire-sword,<br> Bring to me thy blade of lightning,<br> That I may subdue these evils,<br> That these monsters I may banish,<br> Send these pains, and ills, and tortures,<br> To the empire of Tuoni,<br> To the kingdom of the east-winds,<br> To the islands of the wicked,<br> To the caverns of the demons,<br> To the rocks within the mountains,<br> To the hidden beds of iron,<br> That the rocks may fall and sicken,<br> And the beds of iron perish.<br> Rocks and metals do not murmur<br> At the hands of the invader.</p> 
 <p>"Torture-daughter of Tuoni,<br> Sitting on the mount of anguish,<br> At the junction of three rivers,<br> Turning rocks of pain and torture,<br> Turn away these fell diseases<br> Through the virtues of the blue-stone;<br> Lead them to the water-channels,<br> Sink them in the deeps of ocean,<br> Where the winds can never find them,<br> Where the sunlight never enters.</p> 
 <p>"Should this prayer prove unavailing,<br> O, Health-virgin, maid of beauty<br> Come and heal my dying people,<br> Still their agonies and anguish.,<br> Give them consciousness and comfort,<br> Give them healthful rest and slumber;<br> These diseases take and banish,<br> Take them in thy copper vessel,<br> To thy eaves within the mountains,<br> To the summit of the Pain-rock,<br> Hurl them to thy boiling caldrons.<br> In the mountain is a touch-stone,<br> Lucky-stone of ancient story,<br> With a hole bored through the centre,<br> Through this pour these pains and tortures,<br> Wretched feelings, thoughts of evil,<br> Human ailments, days unlucky,<br> Tribulations, and misfortunes,<br> That they may not rise at evening,<br> May not see the light of morning."</p> 
 <p>Ending thus, old Wainamoinen,<br> The eternal, wise enchanter,<br> Rubbed his sufferers with balsams,<br> Rubbed the tissues, red and painful,<br> With the balm of healing flowers,<br> Balsams made of herbs enchanted,<br> Sprinkled all with healing vapors,<br> Spake these words in supplication.<br> "Ukko, thou who art in heaven,<br> God of justice, and of mercy,<br> Send us from the east a rain-cloud,<br> Send a dark cloud from the North-west,<br> From the north let fall a third one,<br> Send us mingled rain and honey,<br> Balsam from the great Physician,<br> To remove this plague of Northland.<br> What I know of healing measures,<br> Only comes from my Creator;<br> Lend me, therefore, of thy wisdom,<br> That I may relieve my people,<br> Save them from the fell destroyer,<br> If my hands should fall in virtue,<br> Let the hands of Ukko follow,<br> God alone can save from trouble.<br> Come to us with thine enchantment,<br> Speak the magic words of healing,<br> That my people may not perish;<br> Give to all alleviation<br> From their sicknesses and sorrows;<br> In the morning, in the evening,<br> Let their wasting ailments vanish;<br> Drive the Death-child from Wainola,<br> Nevermore to visit Northland,<br> Never in the course of ages,<br> Never while the moonlight glimmers<br> O'er the lakes of Kalevala."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, the enchanter,<br> The eternal wisdom-singer,<br> Thus expelled the nine diseases,<br> Evil children or Lowyatar,<br> Healed the tribes of Kalevala,<br> Saved his people from destruction.</p>
