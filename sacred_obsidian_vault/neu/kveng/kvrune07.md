 <p>WAINAMOINEN, old and truthful,<br> Swam through all the deep-sea waters,<br> Floating like a branch of aspen,<br> Like a withered twig of willow;<br> Swam six days in summer weather,<br> Swam six nights in golden moonlight;<br> Still before him rose the billows,<br> And behind him sky and ocean.<br> Two days more he swam undaunted,<br> Two long nights be struggled onward.<br> On the evening of the eighth day,<br> Wainamoinen grew disheartened,<br> Felt a very great discomfort,<br> For his feet had lost their toe-nails,<br> And his fingers dead and dying.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Sad and weary, spake as follows:<br> "Woe is me, my old life fated!<br> Woe is me, misfortune's offspring!<br> Fool was I when fortune, favored,<br> To forsake my home and kindred,<br> For a maiden fair and lovely,<br> Here beneath the starry heavens,<br> In this cruel waste of waters,<br> Days and nights to swim and wander,<br> Here to struggle with the storm-winds,<br> To be tossed by heaving billows,<br> In this broad sea's great expanses,<br> In this ocean vast and boundless.</p> 
 <p>"Cold my life and sad and dreary,<br> Painful too for me to linger<br> Evermore within these waters,<br> Thus to struggle for existence!<br> Cannot know how I can prosper,<br> How to find me food and shelter,<br> In these cold and lifeless waters,<br> In these days of dire misfortune.<br> Build I in the winds my dwelling?<br> It will find no sure foundation.<br> Build my home upon the billows?<br> Surely would the waves destroy it."</p> 
 <p>Comes a bird from far Pohyola,<br> From the occident, an eagle,<br> Is not classed among the largest,<br> Nor belongs he to the smallest;<br> One wing touches on the waters,<br> While the other sweeps the heavens;<br> O'er the waves he wings his body,<br> Strikes his beak upon the sea-cliffs,<br> Flies about, then safely perches,<br> Looks before him, looks behind him,<br> There beholds brave Wainamoinen,<br> On the blue-back of the ocean,<br> And the eagle thus accosts him:<br> "Wherefore art thou, ancient hero,<br> Swimming in the deep-sea billows?<br> Thus the water-minstrel answered:<br> "I am ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Friend and fellow of the waters<br> I, the famous wisdom-singer;<br> Went to woo a Northland maiden,<br> Maiden from the dismal Darkland,<br> Quickly galloped on my journey,<br> Riding on the plain of ocean.<br> I arrived one morning early,<br> At the breaking of the day-dawn.<br> At the bay of Luotola,<br> Near Youkola's foaming river,<br> Where the evil Youkahainen<br> Slew my steed with bow and arrow,<br> Tried to slay me with his weapons.<br> On the waters fell I headlong,<br> Plunged beneath the salt-sea's surface,<br> From the saddle of the courser,<br> From my dappled steed of magic.</p> 
 <p>"Then arose a mighty storm-wind,<br> From the East and West a whirlwind,<br> Washed me seaward on the surges,<br> Seaward, seaward, further, further,<br> Where for many days I wandered,<br> Swam and rocked upon the billows,<br> Where as many nights I struggled,<br> In the dashing waves and sea-foam,<br> With the angry winds and waters.</p> 
 <p>"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<br> Cannot solve this heavy problem,<br> How to live nor how to perish<br> In this cruel salt-sea water.<br> Build I in the winds my dwelling?<br> It will find no sure foundation.<br> Build my home upon the waters?<br> Surely will the waves destroy it.<br> Must I swim the sea forever,<br> Must I live, or must I perish?<br> What will happen if I perish,<br> If I sink below the billows,<br> Perish here from cold and hunger?"<br> Thus the bird of Ether answered<br> "Be not in the least disheartened,<br> Place thyself between my shoulders,<br> On my back be firmly seated,<br> I will lift thee from the waters,<br> Bear thee with my pinions upward,<br> Bear thee wheresoe'er thou willest.<br> Well do I the day remember<br> Where thou didst the eagle service,<br> When thou didst the birds a favor.<br> Thou didst leave the birch-tree standing,<br> When were cleared the Osmo-forests,<br> From the lands of Kalevala,<br> As a home for weary song-birds,<br> As a resting-place for eagles."</p> 
 <p>Then arises Wainamoinen,<br> Lifts his head above the waters,<br> Boldly rises from the sea-waves,<br> Lifts his body from the billows,<br> Seats himself upon the eagle,<br> On the eagle's feathered shoulders.<br> Quick aloft the huge bird bears him,<br> Bears the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Bears him on the path of zephyrs,<br> Floating on the vernal breezes,<br> To the distant shore of Northland,<br> To the dismal Sariola,<br> Where the eagle leaves his burden,<br> Flies away to join his fellows.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, lone and weary,<br> Straightway fell to bitter weeping,<br> Wept and moaned in heavy accents,<br> On the border of the blue-sea.<br> On a cheerless promontory,<br> With a hundred wounds tormented,<br> Made by cruel winds and waters,<br> With his hair and beard dishevelled<br> By the surging of the billows.<br> Three long days he wept disheartened<br> Wept as many nights in anguish,<br> Did not know what way to journey,<br> Could not find a woodland foot-print,<br> That would point him to the highway,<br> To his home in Kalevala,<br> To his much-loved home and kindred.</p> 
 <p>Northland's young and slender maiden,<br> With complexion fair and lovely,<br> With the Sun had laid a wager,<br> With the Sun and Moon a wager,<br> Which should rise before the other,<br> On the morning of the morrow.<br> And the maiden rose in beauty,<br> Long before the Sun had risen,<br> Long before the Moon bad wakened,<br> From their beds beneath the ocean.<br> Ere the cock had crowed the day-break,<br> Ere the Sun had broken slumber<br> She had sheared six gentle lambkins,<br> Gathered from them six white fleeces,<br> Hence to make the rolls for spinning,<br> Hence to form the threads for weaving,<br> Hence to make the softest raiment,<br> Ere the morning dawn had broken,<br> Ere the sleeping Sun had risen.</p> 
 <p>When this task the maid had ended,<br> Then she scrubbed the birchen tables,<br> Sweeps the ground-floor of the stable,<br> With a broom of leaves and branches<br> From the birches of the Northland,<br> Scrapes the sweepings well together<br> On a shovel made of copper,<br> Carries them beyond the stable,<br> From the doorway to the meadow,<br> To the meadow's distant border,<br> Near the surges of the great-sea,<br> Listens there and looks about her,<br> Hears a wailing from the waters,<br> Hears a weeping from the sea-shore,<br> Hears a hero-voice lamenting.</p> 
 <p>Thereupon she hastens homeward,<br> Hastens to her mother's dwelling,<br> These the words the maiden utters:<br> "I have heard a wail from ocean,<br> Heard a weeping from the sea-coast,<br> On the shore some one lamenting."</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Ancient, toothless dame of Northland,<br> Hastens from her door and court-yard,<br> Through the meadow to the sea-shore,<br> Listens well for sounds of weeping,<br> For the wail of one in sorrow;<br> Hears the voice of one in trouble,<br> Hears a hero-cry of anguish.<br> Thus the ancient Louhi answers:<br> "This is not the wail of children,<br> These are not the tears of women,<br> In this way weep bearded heroes;<br> This the hero-cry of anguish."</p> 
 <p>Quick she pushed her boat to water,<br> To the floods her goodly vessel,<br> Straightway rows with lightning swiftness,<br> To the weeping Wainamoinen;<br> Gives the hero consolation,<br> Comfort gives she to the minstrel<br> Wailing in a grove of willows,<br> In his piteous condition,<br> Mid the alder-trees and aspens,<br> On the border of the salt-sea,<br> Visage trembling, locks dishevelled.<br> Ears, and eyes, and lips of sadness.</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Thus addresses Wainamoinen:<br> "Tell me what has been thy folly,<br> That thou art in this condition."</p> 
 <p>Old and truthful Wainamoinen<br> Lifts aloft his bead and answers:<br> "Well I know that it is folly<br> That has brought me all this trouble,<br> Brought me to this land of strangers,<br> To these regions unbefitting<br> Happy was I with my kindred,<br> In my distant home and country,<br> There my name was named in honor."</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Thus replied to Wainamoinen:<br> "I would gain the information,<br> Should I be allowed to ask thee,<br> Who thou art of ancient heroes,<br> Who of all the host of heroes?<br> This is Wainamoinen's answer:<br> "Formerly my name was mentioned,<br> Often was I heard and honored,<br> As a minstrel and magician,<br> In the long and dreary winters,<br> Called the 'Singer of the Northland,<br> In the valleys of Wainola,<br> On the plains of Kalevala;<br> No one thought that such misfortune<br> Could befall wise Wainamoinen."</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Thus replied in cheering accents<br> "Rise, O hero, from discomfort,<br> From thy bed among the willows;<br> Enter now upon the new-way,<br> Come with me to yonder dwelling,<br> There relate thy strange adventures,<br> Tell the tale of thy misfortunes."</p> 
 <p>Now she takes the hapless hero,<br> Lifts him from his bed of sorrow,<br> In her boat she safely seats him,<br> And begins at once her rowing,<br> Rows with steady hand and mighty<br> To her home upon the sea-shore,<br> To the dwellings of Pohyola.<br> There she feeds the starving hero,<br> Rests the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Gives him warmth, and food, and shelter,<br> And the hero soon recovers.</p> 
 <p>Then the hostess of Pohyola<br> Questioned thus the ancient singer:<br> "Wherefore didst thou, Wainamoinen,<br> Friend and fellow of the waters,<br> Weep in sad and bitter accents,<br> On the border of the ocean,<br> Mid the aspens and the willows?"</p> 
 <p>This is Wainamoinen's answer:<br> Had good reason for my weeping,<br> Cause enough for all my sorrow;<br> Long indeed had I been swimming,<br> Had been buffeting the billows,<br> In the far outstretching waters.<br> This the reason for my weeping;<br> I have lived in toil and torture,<br> Since I left my home and country,<br> Left my native land and kindred,<br> Came to this the land of strangers,<br> To these unfamiliar portals.<br> All thy trees have thorns to wound me,<br> All thy branches, spines to pierce me,<br> Even birches give me trouble,<br> And the alders bring discomfort,<br> My companions, winds and waters,<br> Only does the Sun seem friendly,<br> In this cold and cruel country,<br> Near these unfamiliar portals."</p> 
 <p>Louhi thereupon made answer,<br> Weep no longer, Wainamoinen,<br> Grieve no more, thou friend of waters,<br> Good for thee, that thou shouldst linger<br> At our friendly homes and firesides;<br> Thou shalt live with us and welcome,<br> Thou shalt sit at all our tables,<br> Eat the salmon from our platters,<br> Eat the sweetest of our bacon,<br> Eat the whiting from our waters."</p> 
 <p>Answers thus old Wainamoinen,<br> Grateful for the invitation:<br> "Never do I court strange tables,<br> Though the food be rare and toothsome;<br> One's own country is the dearest,<br> One's own table is the sweetest,<br> One's own home, the most attractive.<br> Grant, kind Ukko, God above me,<br> Thou Creator, full of mercy,<br> Grant that I again may visit<br> My beloved home and country.<br> Better dwell in one's own country,<br> There to drink Its healthful waters<br> From the simple cups of birch-wood,<br> Than in foreign lands to wander,<br> There to drink the rarest liquors<br> From the golden bowls of strangers."</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Thus replied to the magician:<br> "What reward wilt thou award me,<br> Should I take thee where thou willest,<br> To thy native land and kindred,<br> To thy much-loved home and fireside,<br> To the meadows of Wainola,<br> To the plains of Kalevala?"</p> 
 <p>These the words of Wainamoinen:<br> "What would be reward sufficient,<br> Shouldst thou take me to my people,<br> To my home and distant country,<br> To the borders of the Northland,<br> There to hear the cuckoo singing,<br> Hear the sacred cuckoo calling?<br> Shall I give thee golden treasures,<br> Fill thy cups with finest silver?"</p> 
 <p>This is Louhi's simple answer:<br> "O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Only true and wise magician,<br> Never will I ask for riches,<br> Never ask for gold nor silver;<br> Gold is for the children's flowers,<br> Silver for the stallion's jewels.<br> Canst thou forge for me the Sampo,<br> Hammer me the lid in colors,<br> From the tips of white-swan feathers<br> From the milk of greatest virtue,<br> From a single grain of barley,<br> From the finest wool of lambkins?</p> 
 <p>"I will give thee too my daughter,<br> Will reward thee through the maiden,<br> Take thee to thy much-loved home-land,<br> To the borders of Wainola,<br> There to hear the cuckoo singing,<br> Hear the sacred cuckoo calling."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, much regretting,<br> Gave this answer to her question:<br> "Cannot forge for thee the Sampo,<br> Cannot make the lid in colors.<br> Take me to my distant country,<br> I will send thee Ilmarinen,<br> He will forge for thee the Sampo,<br> Hammer thee the lid in colors,<br> He may win thy lovely maiden;<br> Worthy smith is Ilmarinen,<br> In this art is first and master;<br> He, the one that forged the heavens.<br> Forged the air a hollow cover;<br> Nowhere see we hammer-traces,<br> Nowhere find a single tongs-mark."</p> 
 <p>Thus replied the hostess, Louhi:<br> "Him alone I'll give my daughter,<br> Promise him my child in marriage,<br> Who for me will forge the Sampo,<br> Hammer me the lid in colors,<br> From the tips of white-swan feathers,<br> From the milk of greatest virtue,<br> From a single grain of barley,<br> From the finest wool of lambkins."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the hostess Louhi,<br> Harnessed quick a dappled courser,<br> Hitched him to her sledge of birch-wood,<br> Placed within it Wainamoinen,<br> Placed the hero on the cross-bench,<br> Made him ready for his journey;<br> Then addressed the ancient minstrel,<br> These the words that Louhi uttered:<br> "Do not raise thine eyes to heaven,<br> Look not upward on thy journey,<br> While thy steed is fresh and frisky,<br> While the day-star lights thy pathway,<br> Ere the evening star has risen;<br> If thine eyes be lifted upward,<br> While the day-star lights thy pathway,<br> Dire misfortune will befall thee,<br> Some sad fate will overtake thee."</p> 
 <p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Fleetly drove upon his journey,<br> Merrily he hastened homeward,<br> Hastened homeward, happy-hearted<br> From the ever-darksome Northland<br> From the dismal Sariola.</p>
