 <p>FAR and wide the tidings travelled,<br> Far away men heard the story<br> Of the flight and death of Aino,<br> Sister dear of Youkahainen,<br> Fairest daughter of creation.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, brave and truthful,<br> Straightway fell to bitter weeping,<br> Wept at morning, wept at evening,<br> Sleepless, wept the dreary night long,<br> That his Aino had departed,<br> That the maiden thus had vanished,<br> Thus had sunk upon the bottom<br> Of the blue-sea, deep and boundless.</p> 
 <p>Filled with grief, the ancient singer,<br> Wainamoinen of the Northland,<br> Heavy-hearted, sorely weeping,<br> Hastened to the restless waters,<br> This the suitor's prayer and question:<br> "Tell, Untamo, tell me, dreamer,<br> Tell me, Indolence, thy visions,<br> Where the water-gods may linger,<br> Where may rest Wellamo's maidens?"</p> 
 <p>Then Untamo, thus made answer,<br> Lazily he told his dreamings:<br> "Over there, the mermaid-dwellings,<br> Yonder live Wellamo's maidens,<br> On the headland robed in verdure,<br> On the forest-covered island,<br> In the deep, pellucid waters,<br> On the purple-colored sea-shore;<br> Yonder is the home or sea-maids,<br> There the maidens of Wellamo,<br> Live there in their sea-side chambers,<br> Rest within their water-caverns,<br> On the rocks of rainbow colors,<br> On the juttings of the sea-cliffs."</p> 
 <p>Straightway hastens Wainamoinen<br> To a boat-house on the sea-shore,<br> Looks with care upon the fish-hooks,<br> And the lines he well considers;<br> Lines, and hooks, and poles, arid fish-nets,<br> Places in a boat of copper,<br> Then begins he swiftly rowing<br> To the forest-covered island,<br> To the point enrobed In verdure,<br> To the purple-colored headland,<br> Where the sea-nymphs live and linger.<br> Hardly does he reach the island<br> Ere the minstrel starts to angle;<br> Far away he throws his fish-hook,<br> Trolls it quickly through the waters,<br> Turning on a copper swivel<br> Dangling from a silver fish-line,<br> Golden is the hook he uses.</p> 
 <p>Now he tries his silken fish-net,<br> Angles long, and angles longer,<br> Angles one day, then a second,<br> In the morning, in the evening,<br> Angles at the hour of noontide,<br> Many days and nights he angles,<br> Till at last, one sunny morning,<br> Strikes a fish of magic powers,<br> Plays like salmon on his fish-line,<br> Lashing waves across the waters,<br> Till at length the fish exhausted<br> Falls a victim to the angler,<br> Safely landed in the bottom<br> Of the hero's boat of copper.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, proudly viewing,<br> Speaks these words in wonder guessing:<br> "This the fairest of all sea-fish,<br> Never have I seen its equal,<br> Smoother surely than the salmon,<br> Brighter-spotted than the trout is,<br> Grayer than the pike of Suomi,<br> Has less fins than any female,<br> Not the fins of any male fish,<br> Not the stripes of sea-born maidens,<br> Not the belt of any mermaid,<br> Not the ears of any song-bird,<br> Somewhat like our Northland salmon<br> From the blue-sea's deepest caverns."</p> 
 <p>In his belt the ancient hero<br> Wore a knife insheathed with silver;<br> From its case he drew the fish-knife,<br> Thus to carve the fish in pieces,<br> Dress the nameless fish for roasting,<br> Make of it a dainty breakfast,<br> Make of it a meal at noon-day,<br> Make for him a toothsome supper,<br> Make the later meal at evening.</p> 
 <p>Straightway as the fish he touches,<br> Touches with his knife of silver,<br> Quick it leaps upon the waters,<br> Dives beneath the sea's smooth surface,<br> From the boat with copper bottom,<br> From the skiff of Wainamoinen.</p> 
 <p>In the waves at goodly distance,<br> Quickly from the sea it rises<br> On the sixth and seventh billows,<br> Lifts its head above the waters,<br> Out of reach of fishing-tackle,<br> Then addresses Wainamoinen,<br> Chiding thus the ancient hero:<br> "Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Do not think that I came hither<br> To be fished for as a salmon,<br> Only to be chopped in pieces,<br> Dressed and eaten like a whiting<br> Make for thee a dainty breakfast,<br> Make for thee a meal at midday,<br> Make for thee a toothsome supper,<br> Make the fourth meal of the Northland."<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Wherefore didst thou then come hither,<br> If it be not for my dinner?"<br> Thus the nameless fish made answer:<br> "Hither have I come, O minstrel,<br> In thine arms to rest and linger,<br> And thyself to love and cherish,<br> At thy side a life-companion,<br> And thy wife to be forever;<br> Deck thy couch with snowy linen,<br> Smooth thy head upon the pillow,<br> Sweep thy rooms and make them cheery,<br> Keep thy dwelling-place in order,<br> Build a fire for thee when needed,<br> Bake for thee the honey-biscuit,<br> Fill thy cup with barley-water,<br> Do for thee whatever pleases.</p> 
 <p>"I am not a scaly sea-fish,<br> Not a trout of Northland rivers,<br> Not a whiting from the waters,<br> Not a salmon of the North-seas,<br> I, a young and merry maiden,<br> Friend and sister of the fishes,<br> Youkahainen's youngest sister,<br> I, the one that thou dost fish for,<br> I am Aino whom thou lovest.</p> 
 <p>"Once thou wert the wise-tongued hero,<br> Now the foolish Wainamoinen,<br> Scant of insight, scant of judgment,<br> Didst not know enough to keep me,<br> Cruel-hearted, bloody-handed,<br> Tried to kill me with thy fish-knife,<br> So to roast me for thy dinner;<br> I, a mermaid of Wellamo,<br> Once the fair and lovely Aino,<br> Sister dear of Youkahainen."</p> 
 <p>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Filled with sorrow, much regretting:<br> "Since thou'rt Youkahainen's sister,<br> Beauteous Aino of Pohyola,<br> Come to me again I pray thee!"</p> 
 <p>Thus the mermaid wisely answered;<br> Nevermore will Aino's spirit<br> Fly to thee and be ill-treated."</p> 
 <p>Quickly dived the water-maiden<br> From the surface of the billow<br> To the many-colored pebbles,<br> To the rainbow-tinted grottoes<br> Where the mermaids live and linger.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, not discouraged,<br> Thought afresh and well reflected,<br> How to live, and work, and win her;<br> Drew with care his silken fish-net,<br> To and fro through foam and billow,<br> Through the bays and winding channels,<br> Drew it through the placid waters,<br> Drew it through the salmon-dwellings,<br> Through the homes of water-maidens,<br> Through the waters of Wainola,<br> Through the blue-back of the ocean,<br> Through the lakes of distant Lapland,<br> Through the rivers of Youkola,<br> Through the seas of Kalevala,<br> Hoping thus to find his Aino.<br> Many were the fish be landed,<br> Every form of fish-like creatures,<br> But be did not catch the sea-maid,<br> Not Wellamo's water-maiden,<br> Fairest daughter of the Northland.</p> 
 <p>Finally the ancient minstrel,<br> Mind depressed, and heart discouraged,<br> Spake these words, immersed in sorrow:<br> "Fool am I, and great my folly,<br> Having neither wit nor judgment;<br> Surely once I had some knowledge,<br> Had some insight into wisdom,<br> Had at least a bit of instinct;<br> But my virtues all have left me<br> In these mournful days of evil,<br> Vanished with my youth and vigor,<br> Insight gone, and sense departed,<br> All my prudence gone to others!<br> Aino, whom I love and cherish,<br> All these years have sought to honor,<br> Aino, now Wellamo's maiden,<br> Promised friend of mine when needed,<br> Promised bride of mine forever,<br> Once I had within my power,<br> Caught her in Wellamo's grottoes,<br> Led her to my boat of copper,<br> With my fish-line made of silver;<br> But alas! I could not keep her,<br> Did not know that I had caught her<br> Till too late to woo and win her;<br> Let her slip between my fingers<br> To the home of water-maidens,<br> To the kingdom of Wellamo."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen then departed,<br> Empty-handed, heavy-hearted,<br> Straightway hastened to his country,<br> To his home in Kalevala,<br> Spake these words upon his journey:<br> "What has happened to the cuckoo,<br> Once the cuckoo bringing gladness,<br> In the morning, in the evening,<br> Often bringing joy at noontide?<br> What has stilled the cuckoo's singing,<br> What has changed the cuckoo's calling?<br> Sorrow must have stilled his singing,<br> And compassion changed his calling,<br> As I hear him sing no longer,<br> For my pleasure in the morning,<br> For my happiness at evening.<br> Never shall I learn the secret,<br> How to live and how to prosper,<br> How upon the earth to rest me,<br> How upon the seas to wander!<br> Only were my ancient mother<br> Living on the face of Northland,<br> Surely she would well advise me,<br> What my thought and what my action,<br> That this cup of grief might pass me,<br> That this sorrow might escape me,<br> And this darkened cloud pass over."</p> 
 <p>In the deep awoke his mother,<br> From her tomb she spake as follows:<br> "Only sleeping was thy mother,<br> Now awakes to give thee answer,<br> What thy thought and what thine action,<br> That this cup of grief may pass thee,<br> That this sorrow may escape thee,<br> And this darkened cloud pass over.<br> Hie thee straightway to the Northland,<br> Visit thou the Suomi daughters;<br> Thou wilt find them wise and lovely,<br> Far more beautiful than Aino,<br> Far more worthy of a husband,<br> Not such silly chatter-boxes,<br> As the fickle Lapland maidens.<br> Take for thee a life-companion,<br> From the honest homes of Suomi,<br> One of Northland's honest daughters;<br> She will charm thee with her sweetness,<br> Make thee happy through her goodness,<br> Form perfection, manners easy,<br> Every step and movement graceful,<br> Full of wit and good behavior,<br> Honor to thy home and kindred."</p>
