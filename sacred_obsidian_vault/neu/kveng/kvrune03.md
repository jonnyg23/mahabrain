 <p>WAINAMOINEN, ancient minstrel,<br> Passed his years in full contentment,<br> On the meadows of Wainola,<br> On the plains of Kalevala,<br> Singing ever wondrous legends,<br> Songs of ancient wit and wisdom,<br> Chanting one day, then a second,<br> Singing in the dusk of evening,<br> Singing till the dawn of morning,<br> Now the tales of old-time heroes,<br> Tales of ages long forgotten,<br> Now the legends of creation,<br> Once familiar to the children,<br> By our children sung no longer,<br> Sung in part by many heroes,<br> In these mournful days of evil,<br> Evil days our race befallen.<br> Far and wide the story travelled,<br> Far away men spread the knowledge<br> Of the chanting of the hero,<br> Of the song of Wainamoinen;<br> To the South were heard the echoes,<br> All of Northland heard the story.</p> 
 <p>Far away in dismal Northland,<br> Lived the singer, Youkahainen,<br> Lapland's young and reckless minstrel,<br> Once upon a time when feasting,<br> Dining with his friends and fellows,<br> Came upon his ears the story<br> That there lived a sweeter singer,<br> On the meadows of Wainola,<br> On the plains of Kalevala,<br> Better skilled in chanting legends,<br> Better skilled than Youkahainen,<br> Better than the one that taught him.</p> 
 <p>Straightway then the bard grew angry,<br> Envy rose within his bosom,<br> Envy of this Wainamoinen,<br> Famed to be a sweeter singer;<br> Hastes he angry to his mother,<br> To his mother, full of wisdom,<br> Vows that he will southward hasten,<br> Hie him southward and betake him<br> To the dwellings of Wainola,<br> To the cabins of the Northland,<br> There as bard to vie in battle,<br> With the famous Wainamoinen.</p> 
 <p>"Nay," replies the anxious father,<br> "Do not go to Kalevala."</p> 
 <p>"Nay," replies the fearful mother,<br> "Go not hence to Wainamoinen,<br> There with him to offer battle;<br> He will charm thee with his singing<br> Will bewitch thee in his anger,<br> He will drive thee back dishonored,<br> Sink thee in the fatal snow-drift,<br> Turn to ice thy pliant fingers,<br> Turn to ice thy feet and ankles."<br> These the words of Youkahainen:<br> Good the judgement of a father,<br> Better still, a mother's counsel,<br> Best of all one's own decision.<br> I will go and face the minstrel,<br> Challenge him to sing in contest,<br> Challenge him as bard to battle,<br> Sing to him my sweet-toned measures,<br> Chant to him my oldest legends,<br> Chant to him my garnered wisdom,<br> That this best of boasted singers,<br> That this famous bard of Suomi,<br> Shall be worsted in the contest,<br> Shall become a hapless minstrel;<br> By my songs shall I transform him,<br> That his feet shall be as flint-stone,<br> And as oak his nether raiment;<br> And this famous, best of singers,<br> Thus bewitched, shall carry ever,<br> In his heart a stony burden,<br> On his shoulder bow of marble,<br> On his hand a flint-stone gauntlet,<br> On his brow a stony visor."</p> 
 <p>Then the wizard, Youkahainen,<br> Heeding not advice paternal,<br> Heeding not his mother's counsel,<br> Leads his courser from his stable,<br> Fire outstreaming from his nostrils,<br> From his hoofs, the sparks outshooting,<br> Hitches to his sledge, the fleet-foot,<br> To his golden sledge, the courser,<br> Mounts impetuous his snow-sledge,<br> Leaps upon the hindmost cross-bench,<br> Strikes his courser with his birch-whip,<br> With his birch-whip, pearl-enamelled.<br> Instantly the prancing racer<br> Springs away upon his journey;<br> On he, restless, plunges northward,<br> All day long be onward gallops,<br> All the next day, onward, onward,<br> So the third from morn till evening,<br> Till the third day twilight brings him<br> To the meadows of Wainola,<br> To the plains of Kalevala.</p> 
 <p>As it happened, Wainamoinen,<br> Wainamoinen, the magician,<br> Rode that sunset on the highway,<br> Silently for pleasure driving<br> Down Wainola's peaceful meadows,<br> O'er the plains of Kalevala.</p> 
 <p>Youkahainen, young and fiery,<br> Urging still his foaming courser,<br> Dashes down upon the singer,<br> Does not turn aside in meeting,<br> Meeting thus in full collision;<br> Shafts are driven tight together,<br> Hames and collars wedged and tangled,<br> Tangled are the reins and traces.<br> Thus perforce they make a stand-still,<br> Thus remain and well consider;<br> Water drips from hame and collar,<br> Vapors rise from both their horses.<br> Speaks the minstrel, Wainamoinen:<br> "Who art thou, and whence? Thou comest<br> Driving like a stupid stripling,<br> Wainamoinen and Youkahainen.<br> Careless, dashing down upon me.<br> Thou hast ruined shafts and traces;<br> And the collar of my racer<br> Thou hast shattered into ruin,<br> And my golden sleigh is broken,<br> Box and runners dashed to pieces."</p> 
 <p>Youkahainen then make answer,<br> Spake at last the words that follow:<br> "I am youthful Youkahainen,<br> But make answer first, who thou art,<br> Whence thou comest, where thou goest,<br> From what lowly tribe descended?"</p> 
 <p>Wainamolinen, wise and ancient,<br> Answered thus the youthful minstrel:<br> "If thou art but Youkahainen,<br> Thou shouldst give me all the highway;<br> I am many years thy senior."</p> 
 <p>Then the boastful Youkahainen<br> Spake again to Wainamoinen:<br> "Young or ancient, little matter,<br> Little consequence the age is;<br> He that higher stands in wisdom,<br> He whose knowledge is the greater,<br> He that is the sweeter singer,<br> He alone shall keep the highway,<br> And the other take the roadside.<br> Art thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Famous sorcerer and minstrel?<br> Let us then begin our singing,<br> Let us sing our ancient legends,<br> Let us chant our garnered wisdom,<br> That the one may hear the other,<br> That the one may judge the other,<br> In a war of wizard sayings."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<br> Thus replied in modest accents:<br> "What I know is very little,<br> Hardly is it worth the singing,<br> Neither is my singing wondrous:<br> All my days I have resided<br> In the cold and dreary Northland,<br> In a desert land enchanted,<br> In my cottage home for ayes;<br> All the songs that I have gathered,<br> Are the cuckoo's simple measures,<br> Some of these I may remember;<br> But since thou perforce demandest,<br> I accept thy boastful challenge.<br> Tell me now, my golden youngster,<br> What thou knowest more than others,<br> Open now thy store of wisdom."</p> 
 <p>Thus made answer Youkahainen,<br> Lapland's young and fiery minstrel:<br> "Know I many bits of learning<br> This I know in perfect clearness:<br> Every roof must have a chimney,<br> Every fire-place have a hearth-stone;<br> Lives of seal are free and merry,<br> Merry is the life of walrus,<br> Feeding on incautious salmon,<br> Daily eating perch and whiting;<br> Whitings live in quiet shallows,<br> Salmon love the level bottoms;<br> Spawns the pike in coldest weather,<br> And defies the storms of winter.</p> 
 <p>Slowly perches swim in Autumn,<br> Wry-backed, hunting deeper water,<br> Spawn in shallows in the summer,<br> Bounding on the shore of ocean.<br> Should this wisdom seem too little,<br> I can tell thee other matters,<br> Sing thee other wizard sayings:<br> All the Northmen plow with reindeer,<br> Mother-horses plow the Southland,<br> Inner Lapland plows with oxen;<br> All the trees on Pisa-mountain,<br> Know I well in all their grandeur;<br> On the Horna-rock are fir-trees,<br> Fir-trees growing tall and slender;<br> Slender grow the trees on mountains.<br> Three, the water-falls in number,<br> Three in number, inland oceans,<br> Three in number, lofty mountains,<br> Shooting to the vault of heaven.<br> Hallapyora's near to Yaemen,<br> Katrakoski in Karyala;<br> Imatra, the falling water,<br> Tumbles, roaring, into Wuoksi."</p> 
 <p>Then the ancient Wainimoinen:<br> "Women's tales and children's wisdom<br> Do not please a bearded hero,<br> Hero, old enough for wedlock;<br> Tell the story of creation,<br> Tell me of the world's beginning,<br> Tell me of the creatures in it,<br> And philosophize a little."</p> 
 <p>Then the youthful Youkahainen<br> Thus replied to Wainamoinen:<br> "Know I well the titmouse-fountains,<br> Pretty birdling is the titmouse;<br> And the viper, green, a serpent;<br> Whitings live in brackish waters;<br> Perches swim in every river;<br> Iron rusts, and rusting weakens;<br> Bitter is the taste of umber;<br> Boiling water is malicious;<br> Fire is ever full of danger;<br> First physician, the Creator;<br> Remedy the oldest, water;<br> Magic is the child of sea-foam;<br> God the first and best adviser;<br> Waters gush from every mountain;<br> Fire descended first from heaven;<br> Iron from the rust was fashioned;<br> Copper from the rocks created;<br> Marshes are of lands the oldest;<br> First of all the trees, the willow;<br> Fir-trees were the first of houses;<br> Hollowed stones the first of kettles."</p> 
 <p>Now the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Thus addresses Youkahainen:<br> "Canst thou give me now some wisdom,<br> Is this nonsense all thou knowest?"<br> Youkahainen thus made answer:<br> "I can tell thee still a trifle,<br> Tell thee of the times primeval,<br> When I plowed the salt-sea's bosom,<br> When I raked the sea-girt islands,<br> When I dug the salmon-grottoes,<br> Hollowed out the deepest caverns,<br> When I all the lakes created,<br> When I heaped the mountains round them,<br> When I piled the rocks about them.<br> I was present as a hero,<br> Sixth of wise and ancient heroes,<br> Seventh of all primeval heroes,<br> When the heavens were created,<br> When were formed the ether-spaces,<br> When the sky was crystal-pillared,<br> When was arched the beauteous rainbow,<br> When the Moon was placed in orbit,<br> When the silver Sun was planted,<br> When the Bear was firmly stationed,<br> And with stars the heavens were sprinkled."<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Thou art surely prince of liars,<br> Lord of all the host of liars;<br> Never wert thou in existence,<br> Surely wert thou never present,<br> When was plowed the salt-sea's bosom,<br> When were raked the sea-girt islands,<br> When were dug the salmon-grottoes,<br> When were hollowed out the caverns,<br> When the lakes were all created,<br> When were heaped the mountains round them,<br> When the rocks were piled about them.<br> Thou wert never seen or heard of<br> When the earth was first created,<br> When were made the ether-spaces,<br> When the air was crystal-pillared,<br> When the Moon was placed in orbit,<br> When the silver Sun was planted,<br> When the Bear was firmly stationed,<br> When the skies with stars were sprinkled."</p> 
 <p>Then in anger Youkahainen<br> Answered ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Then, sir, since I fail in wisdom,<br> With the sword I offer battle;<br> Come thou, famous bard and minstrel,<br> Thou the ancient wonder-singer,<br> Let us try our strength with broadswords,<br> let our blades be fully tested."<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Not thy sword and not thy wisdom,<br> Not thy prudence, nor thy cunning,<br> Do I fear a single moment.<br> Let who may accept thy challenge,<br> Not with thee, a puny braggart,<br> Not with one so vain and paltry,<br> Will I ever measure broadswords."</p> 
 <p>Then the youthful Youkahainen,<br> Mouth awry and visage sneering,<br> Shook his golden locks and answered:<br> "Whoso fears his blade to measure,<br> Fears to test his strength at broadswords,<br> Into wild-boar of the forest,<br> Swine at heart and swine in visage,<br> Singing I will thus transform him;<br> I will hurl such hero-cowards,<br> This one hither, that one thither,<br> Stamp him in the mire and bedding,<br> In the rubbish of the stable."</p> 
 <p>Angry then grew Wainamoinen,<br> Wrathful waxed, and fiercely frowning,<br> Self-composed he broke his silence,<br> And began his wondrous singing.<br> Sang he not the tales of childhood,<br> Children's nonsense, wit of women,<br> Sang he rather bearded heroes,<br> That the children never heard of,<br> That the boys and maidens knew not<br> Known but half by bride and bridegroom,<br> Known in part by many heroes,<br> In these mournful days of evil,<br> Evil times our race befallen.<br> Grandly sang wise Wainamoinen,<br> Till the copper-bearing mountains,<br> And the flinty rocks and ledges<br> Heard his magic tones and trembled;<br> Mountain cliffs were torn to pieces,<br> All the ocean heaved and tumbled;<br> And the distant hills re-echoed.<br> Lo! the boastful Youkahainen<br> Is transfixed in silent wonder,<br> And his sledge with golden trimmings<br> Floats like brushwood on the billows;<br> Sings his braces into reed-grass,<br> Sings his reins to twigs of willow,<br> And to shrubs his golden cross-bench.<br> Lo! his birch-whip, pearl-enameled,<br> Floats a reed upon the border;<br> Lo! his steed with golden forehead,<br> Stands a statue on the waters;<br> Hames and traces are as fir-boughs,<br> And his collar, straw and sea-grass.<br> Still the minstrel sings enchantment,<br> Sings his sword with golden handle,<br> Sings it into gleam of lightning,<br> Hangs it in the sky above him;<br> Sings his cross-bow, gaily painted,<br> To a rainbow o'er the ocean;<br> Sings his quick and feathered arrows<br> Into hawks and screaming eagles;<br> Sings his dog with bended muzzle,<br> Into block of stone beside him;<br> Sings his cap from off his forehead,<br> Sings it into wreaths of vapor;<br> From his hands he sings his gauntlets<br> Into rushes on the waters;<br> Sings his vesture, purple-colored,<br> Into white clouds in the heavens;<br> Sings his girdle, set with jewels,<br> Into twinkling stars around him;<br> And alas! for Youkahainen,<br> Sings him into deeps of quick-sand;<br> Ever deeper, deeper, deeper,<br> In his torture, sinks the wizard,<br> To his belt in mud and water.<br> Now it was that Youkahainen<br> Comprehended but too clearly<br> What his folly, what the end was,<br> Of the journey he had ventured,<br> Vainly he had undertaken<br> For the glory of a contest<br> With the grand, old Wainamoinen.</p> 
 <p>When at last young Youkahainen,<br> Pohyola's old and sorry stripling,<br> Strives his best to move his right foot,<br> But alas! the foot obeys not;<br> When he strives to move his left foot,<br> Lo! he finds it turned to flint-stone.</p> 
 <p>Thereupon sad Youkahainen,<br> In the deeps of desperation,<br> And in earnest supplication,<br> Thus addresses Wainamoinen:<br> "O thou wise and worthy minstrel,<br> Thou the only true, magician,<br> Cease I pray thee thine enchantment,.<br> Only turn away thy magic,<br> Let me leave this slough of horror,<br> Loose me from this stony prison,<br> Free me from this killing torment,<br> I will pay a golden ransom."<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "What the ransom thou wilt give me<br> If I cease from mine enchantment,<br> If I turn away my magic,<br> Lift thee from thy slough of horror,<br> Loose thee from thy stony prison,<br> Free thee from thy killing torment?"<br> Answered youthful Youkahainen:<br> "Have at home two magic cross-bows,<br> Pair of bows of wondrous power,<br> One so light a child can bend it,<br> Only strength can bend the other,<br> Take of these the one that pleases."<br> Then the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Do not wish thy magic cross-bows,<br> Have a few of such already,<br> Thine to me are worse than useless<br> I have bows in great abundance,<br> Bows on every nail and rafter,<br> Bows that laugh at all the hunters,<br> Bows that go themselves a-hunting."</p> 
 <p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Sang alas! poor Youkahainen<br> Deeper into mud and water,<br> Deeper in the slough of torment.<br> Youkahainen thus made answer:<br> "Have at home two magic shallops,<br> Beautiful the boats and wondrous;<br> One rides light upon the ocean,<br> One is made for heavy burdens;<br> Take of these the one that pleases."<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Do not wish thy magic shallops,<br> Have enough of such already;<br> All my bays are full of shallops,<br> All my shores are lined with shallops,<br> Some before the winds are sailors,<br> Some were built to sail against them."</p> 
 <p>Still the Wainola bard and minstrel<br> Sings again poor Youkahainen<br> Deeper, deeper into torment,<br> Into quicksand to his girdle,<br> Till the Lapland bard in anguish<br> Speaks again to Wainamoinen:<br> "Have at home two magic stallions,<br> One a racer, fleet as lightning,<br> One was born for heavy burdens;<br> Take of these the one that pleases."<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Neither do I wish thy stallions,<br> Do not need thy hawk-limbed stallions,<br> Have enough of these already;<br> Magic stallions swarm my stables,<br> Eating corn at every manger,<br> Broad of back to hold the water,<br> Water on each croup in lakelets."</p> 
 <p>Still the bard of Kalevala<br> Sings the hapless Lapland minstrel<br> Deeper, deeper into torment,<br> To his shoulders into water.<br> Spake again young Youkahainen:<br> "O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Thou the only true magician,<br> Cease I pray thee thine enchantment,<br> Only turn away thy magic,<br> I will give thee gold abundant,<br> Countless stores of shining silver;<br> From the wars my father brought it,<br> Brought it from the hard-fought battles."<br> Spake the wise, old Wainamoinen:<br> "For thy gold I have no longing,<br> Neither do I wish thy silver,<br> Have enough of each already;<br> Gold abundant fills my chambers,<br> On each nail hang bags of silver,<br> Gold that glitters in the sunshine,<br> Silver shining in the moonlight."</p> 
 <p>Sank the braggart, Youkahainen,<br> Deeper in his slough of torment,<br> To his chin in mud and water,<br> Ever praying, thus beseeching:<br> "O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Greatest of the old magicians,<br> Lift me from this pit of horror,<br> From this prison-house of torture;<br> I will give thee all my corn-fields,<br> Give thee all my corn in garners,<br> Thus my hapless life to ransom,<br> Thus to gain eternal freedom."<br> Wainamoinen thus made answer:<br> "Take thy corn to other markets,<br> Give thy garners to the needy;<br> I have corn in great abundance,<br> Fields have I in every quarter,<br> Corn in all my fields is growing;<br> One's own fields are always richer,<br> One's own grain is much the sweeter."</p> 
 <p>Lapland's young and reckless minstrel,<br> Sorrow-laden, thus enchanted,<br> Deeper sinks in mud and water,<br> Fear-enchained and full of anguish,<br> In the mire, his beard bedrabbled,<br> Mouth once boastful filled with sea-weed,<br> In the grass his teeth entangled,<br> Youkahainen thus beseeches:<br> "O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Wisest of the wisdom-singers,<br> Cease at last thine incantations,<br> Only turn away thy magic,<br> And my former life restore me,<br> Lift me from this stifling torment,<br> Free mine eyes from sand and water,<br> I will give thee sister, Aino,<br> Fairest daughter of my mother,<br> Bride of thine to be forever,<br> Bride of thine to do thy pleasure,<br> Sweep the rooms within thy cottage,<br> Keep thy dwelling-place in order,<br> Rinse for thee the golden platters,<br> Spread thy couch with finest linens,<br> For thy bed, weave golden covers,<br> Bake for thee the honey-biscuit."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br> Finds at last the wished-for ransom,<br> Lapland's young and fairest daughter,<br> Sister dear of Youkahainen;<br> Happy he, that he has won him,<br> In his age a beauteous maiden,<br> Bride of his to be forever,<br> Pride and joy of Kalevala.<br> Now the happy Wainamoinen,<br> Sits upon the rock of gladness,<br> Joyful on the rock of music,<br> Sings a little, sings and ceases,<br> Sings again, and sings a third time,<br> Thus to break the spell of magic,<br> Thus to lessen the enchantment,<br> Thus the potent charm to banish.<br> As the magic spell is broken,<br> Youkahainen, sad, but wiser,<br> Drags his feet from out the quicksand,<br> Lifts his beard from out the water,<br> From the rocks leads forth his courser,<br> Brings his sledge back from the rushes,<br> Calls his whip back from the ocean,<br> Sets his golden sledge in order,<br> Throws himself upon the cross-bench,<br> Snaps his whip and hies him homeward,<br> Hastens homeward, heavy-hearted,<br> Sad indeed to meet his mother,<br> Aino's mother, gray and aged.<br> Careless thus be hastens homeward,<br> Nears his home with noise and bustle,<br> Reckless drives against the pent-house,<br> Breaks the shafts against the portals,<br> Breaks his handsome sledge in pieces.</p> 
 <p>Then his mother, quickly guessing,<br> Would have chided him for rashness,<br> But the father interrupted:<br> "Wherefore dost thou break thy snow-sledge,<br> Wherefore dash thy thills in fragments,<br> Wherefore comest home so strangely,<br> Why this rude and wild behavior?"</p> 
 <p>Now alas! poor Youkahainen,<br> Cap awry upon his forehead,<br> Falls to weeping, broken-hearted,<br> Head depressed and mind dejected,<br> Eyes and lips expressing sadness,<br> Answers not his anxious father.</p> 
 <p>Then the mother quickly asked him,<br> Sought to find his cause for sorrow:<br> "Tell me, first-born, why thou weepest,<br> Why thou weepest, heavy-hearted,<br> Why thy mind is so dejected,<br> Why thine eyes express such sadness."<br> Youkahainen then made answer:<br> "Golden mother, ever faithful,<br> Cause there is to me sufficient,<br> Cause enough in what has happened,<br> Bitter cause for this my sorrow,<br> Cause for bitter tears and murmurs:<br> All my days will pass unhappy,<br> Since, O mother of my being,<br> I have promised beauteous Aino,<br> Aino, thy beloved daughter,<br> Aino, my devoted sister,<br> To decrepit Wainamoinen,<br> Bride to be to him forever,<br> Roof above him, prop beneath him,<br> Fair companion at his fire-side."</p> 
 <p>Joyful then arose the mother,<br> Clapped her hands in glee together,<br> Thus addressing Youkahainen:<br> "Weep no more, my son beloved,<br> Thou hast naught to cause thy weeping,<br> Hast no reason for thy sorrow,<br> Often I this hope have cherished;<br> Many years have I been praying<br> That this mighty bard and hero,<br> Wise and valiant Wainamoinen,<br> Spouse should be to beauteous Aino,<br> Son-in-law to me, her mother."</p> 
 <p>But the fair and lovely maiden,<br> Sister dear of Youkahainen,<br> Straightway fell to bitter weeping,<br> On the threshold wept and lingered,<br> Wept all day and all the night long,<br> Wept a second, then a third day,<br> Wept because a bitter sorrow<br> On her youthful heart had fallen.<br> Then the gray-haired mother asked her:<br> "Why this weeping, lovely Aino?<br> Thou hast found a noble suitor,<br> Thou wilt rule his spacious dwelling,<br> At his window sit and rest thee,<br> Rinse betimes his golden platters,<br> Walk a queen within his dwelling."<br> Thus replied the tearful Aino:<br> "Mother dear, and all-forgiving,<br> Cause enough for this my sorrow,<br> Cause enough for bitter weeping:<br> I must loose my sunny tresses,<br> Tresses beautiful and golden,<br> Cannot deck my hair with jewels,<br> Cannot bind my head with ribbons,<br> All to be hereafter hidden<br> Underneath the linen bonnet<br> That the wife. must wear forever;<br> Weep at morning, weep at evening,<br> Weep alas! for waning beauty,<br> Childhood vanished, youth departed,<br> Silver sunshine, golden moonlight,<br> Hope and pleasure of my childhood,<br> Taken from me now forever,<br> And so soon to be forgotten<br> At the tool-bench of my brother,<br> At the window of my sister,<br> In the cottage of my father."</p> 
 <p>Spake again the gray-haired mother<br> To her wailing daughter Aino:<br> "Cease thy sorrow, foolish maiden,<br> By thy tears thou art ungrateful,<br> Reason none for thy repining,<br> Not the slightest cause for weeping;<br> Everywhere the silver sunshine<br> Falls as bright on other households;<br> Not alone the moonlight glimmers<br> Through thy father's open windows,<br> On the work-bench of thy brother;<br> Flowers bloom in every meadow,<br> Berries grow on every mountain;<br> Thou canst go thyself and find them,<br> All the day long go and find them;<br> Not alone thy brother's meadows<br> Grow the beauteous vines and flowers;<br> Not alone thy father's mountains<br> Yield the ripe, nutritious berries;<br> Flowers bloom in other meadows,<br> Berries grow on other mountains,<br> There as here, my lovely Aino."</p>
