 <p>WAINAMOINEN, old and faithful,<br> Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<br> "O thou wonder-working brother,<br> Let us go to Sariola,<br> There to gain the magic Sampo,<br> There to see the lid in colors."<br> Ilmarinen gave this answer:<br> "Hard indeed to seize the Sampo,<br> Neither can the lid be captured<br> From the never-pleasant Northland,<br> From the dismal Sariola.<br> Louhi took away the Sampo,<br> Carried off the lid in colors<br> To the stone-mount of Pohyola;<br> Hid it in the copper mountain,<br> Where nine locks secure the treasure.<br> Many young roots sprout around it,<br> Grow nine fathoms deep in sand-earth,<br> One great root beneath the mountain,<br> In the cataract a second,<br> And a third beneath the castle<br> Built upon the mount of ages."<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Brother mine, and wonder-worker,<br> Let us go to Sariola,<br> That we may secure the Sampo;<br> Let us build a goodly vessel,<br> Bring the Sampo to Wainola,<br> Bring away the lid in colors,<br> From the stone-berg of Pohyola,<br> From the copper-bearing mountain.<br> Where the miracle lies anchored."<br> Ilmarinen thus made answer:<br> "By the land the way is safer,<br> Lempo travels on the ocean,<br> Ghastly Death upon his shoulder;<br> On the sea the waves will drift us,<br> And the storm-winds wreck our vessel;<br> Then our bands must do the rowing,<br> And our feet must steer us homeward."<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Safe indeed by land to journey,<br> But the way is rough and trying,<br> Long the road and full of turnings;<br> Lovely is the ship on ocean,<br> Beautiful to ride the billows,<br> Journey easy o'er the waters,<br> Sailing in a trusty vessel;<br> Should the West-wind cross our pathway,<br> Will the South-wind drive us northward.<br> Be that as it may, my brother,<br> Since thou dost not love the water,<br> By the land then let us journey.<br> Forge me now the sword of battle,<br> Forge for me the mighty fire-sword,<br> That I may destroy the wild-beasts,<br> Frighten all the Northland people,<br> As we journey for the Sampo<br> To the cold and dismal village,<br> To the never-pleasant Northland,<br> To the dismal Sariola."</p> 
 <p>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> The eternal forger-artist,<br> Laid the metals in the furnace,<br> In the fire laid steel and iron,<br> In the hot-coals, gold and silver,<br> Rightful measure of the metals;<br> Set the workmen at the furnace,<br> Lustily they plied the bellows.<br> Like the wax the iron melted,<br> Like the dough the hard steel softened,<br> Like the water ran the silver,<br> And the liquid gold flowed after.</p> 
 <p>Then the minstrel, Ilmarinen,<br> The eternal wonder-forger,<br> Looks within his magic furnace,<br> On the border of his oven,<br> There beholds the fire-sword forming,<br> Sees the blade with golden handle;<br> Takes the weapon from the furnace,<br> Lays it on his heavy anvil<br> For the falling of the hammer;<br> Forges well the blade of magic,<br> Well the heavy sword be tempers,<br> Ornaments the hero-weapon<br> With the finest gold and silver.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, the magician,<br> Comes to view the blade of conquest,<br> Lifts admiringly the fire-sword,<br> Then these words the hero utters:<br> "Does the weapon match the soldier,<br> Does the handle suit the bearer?<br> Yea, the blade and hilt are molded<br> To the wishes of the minstrel."</p> 
 <p>On the sword-point gleams the moonlight,<br> On the blade the sun is shining,<br> On the hilt the bright stars twinkle,<br> On the edge a horse is neighing,<br> On the handle plays a kitten,<br> On the sheath a dog is barking.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen wields his fire-sword,<br> Tests it on the iron-mountain,<br> And these words the hero utters:<br> "With this broadsword I could quickly<br> Cleave in twain the mount of Pohya,<br> Cut the flinty rocks asunder."<br> Spake the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:<br> "Wherewith shall I guard from danger,<br> How protect myself from evil,<br> From the ills by land and water?<br> Shall I wear an iron armor,<br> Belt of steel around my body?<br> Stronger is a man in armor,<br> Safer in a mail of copper."</p> 
 <p>Now the time has come to journey<br> To the never-pleasant Northland;<br> Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> And his brother, Ilmarinen,<br> Hasten to the field and forest,<br> Searching for their fiery coursers,<br> In each shining belt a bridle,<br> With a harness on their shoulders.<br> In the woods they find a race;<br> In the glen a steed of battle,<br> Ready for his master's service.<br> Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<br> And the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Throw the harness on the courser,<br> Hitch him to the sledge of conquest,<br> Hasten on their journey Northward;<br> Drive along the broad-sea's margin<br> Till they bear some one lamenting<br> On the strand hear something wailing<br> Near the landing-place of vessels.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Speaks these words in wonder, guessing,<br> "This must be some maiden weeping,<br> Some fair daughter thus lamenting;<br> Let us journey somewhat nearer,<br> To discover whence this wailing."</p> 
 <p>Drew they nearer, nearer, nearer,<br> Hoping thus to find a maiden<br> Weeping on the sandy sea-shore.<br> It was not a maiden weeping,<br> But a vessel, sad, and lonely,<br> Waiting on the shore and wailing.<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Why art weeping, goodly vessel,<br> What the cause of thy lamenting?<br> Art thou mourning for thy row-locks,<br> Is thy rigging ill-adjusted?<br> Dost thou weep since thou art anchored<br> On the shore in times of trouble?"<br> Thus the war-ship spake in answer:<br> "To the waters would this vessel<br> Haste upon the well-tarred rollers,<br> As a happy maiden journeys<br> To the cottage of her husband.<br> I, alas! a goodly vessel,<br> Weep because I lie at anchor,<br> Weep and wail because no hero<br> Sets me free upon the waters,<br> Free to ride the rolling billows.<br> It was said when I was fashioned,<br> Often sung when I was building,<br> That this bark should be for battle,<br> Should become a mighty war-ship,<br> Carry in my hull great treasures,<br> Priceless goods across the ocean.<br> Never have I sailed to conquest,<br> Never have I carried booty;<br> Other vessels not as worthy<br> To the wars are ever sailing,<br> Sailing to the songs of battle.<br> Three times in the summer season<br> Come they home with treasures laden,<br> In their hulls bring gold and silver;<br> I, alas! a worthy vessel,<br> Many months have lain at anchor,<br> I, a war-ship well constructed,<br> Am decaying in the harbor,<br> Never having sailed to conquest;<br> Worms are gnawing at my vitals,<br> In my hull their dwelling-places,<br> And ill-omened birds of heaven<br> Build their nests within my rigging;<br> Frogs and lizards of the forest<br> Play about my oars and rudder;<br> Three times better for this vessel<br> Were he but a valley birch-tree,<br> Or an aspen on the heather,<br> With the squirrels in his branches,<br> And the dogs beneath them barking!"</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and faithfull<br> Thus addressed the ship at anchor:<br> "Weep no more, thou goodly vessel,<br> Man-of-war, no longer murmur;<br> Thou shalt sail to Sariola,<br> Sing the war-songs of the Northland,<br> Sail with us to deadly combat.<br> Wert thou built by the Creator,<br> Thou canst sail the roughest waters,<br> Sidewise journey o'er the ocean;<br> Dost not need the hand to touch thee,<br> Dost not need the foot to turn thee,<br> Needing nothing to propel thee."<br> Thus the weeping boat made answer:<br> "Cannot sail without assistance,<br> Neither can my brother-vessels<br> Sail unaided o'er the waters,<br> Sail across the waves undriven."<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Should I lead thee to the broad-sea,<br> Wilt thou journey north unaided,<br> Sail without the help of rowers,<br> Sail without the aid of south-winds,<br> Sail without the b elm to guide thee?<br> Thus the wailing ship replying:<br> Cannot sail without assistance,<br> Neither can my brother-vessels<br> Sail without the aid of rowers,<br> Sail without the help of south-winds,<br> Nor without the helm to guide them."<br> These the words of Wainamoinen:<br> "Wilt thou run with aid of oarsmen<br> When the south-winds give assistance,<br> Guided by a skillful pilot?"<br> This the answer of the war-ship:<br> "Quickly can I course these waters,<br> When my oars are manned by rowers,<br> When my sails are filled with south-winds,<br> All my goodly brother-vessels<br> Sail the ocean with assistance,<br> When the master holds the rudder."</p> 
 <p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Left the racer on the sea-side,<br> Tied him to the sacred birch-tree,<br> Hung the harness on a willow,<br> Rolled the vessel to the waters,<br> Sang the ship upon the broad-sea,<br> Asked the boat this simple question:<br> "O thou vessel, well-appearing<br> From the mighty oak constructed,<br> Art thou strong to carry treasures<br> As in view thou art commanding?<br> Thus the goodly ship made answer:<br> "Strong am I to carry treasures,<br> In my hull a golden cargo;<br> I can bear a hundred oarsmen,<br> And of warriors a thousand."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, the magician,<br> Then began his wondrous singing.<br> On one side the magic vessel,<br> Sang he youth with golden virtues,<br> Bearded youth with strength of heroes,<br> Sang them into mail of copper.<br> On the other side the vessel,<br> Sang he silver-tinselled maidens,<br> Girded them with belts of copper,<br> Golden rings upon their fingers.<br> Sings again the great magician,<br> Fills the magic ship with heroes,<br> Ancient heroes, brave and mighty;<br> Sings them into narrow limits,<br> Since the young men came before them.</p> 
 <p>At the helm himself be seated,<br> Near the last beam of the vessel,<br> Steered his goodly boat in joyance,<br> Thus addressed the willing war-ship:<br> "Glide upon the trackless waters,<br> Sail away, my ship of magic,<br> Sail across the waves before thee,<br> Speed thou like a dancing bubble,<br> Like a flower upon the billows!"</p> 
 <p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Set the young men to the rowing,<br> Let the maidens sit in waiting.<br> Eagerly the youthful heroes<br> Bend the oars and try the row-locks,<br> But the distance is not lessened.<br> Then the minstrel, Wainamoinen,<br> Set the maidens to the rowing,<br> Let the young men rest in waiting.<br> Eagerly the merry maidens<br> Bend the aspen-oars in rowing,<br> But the distance is not lessened.<br> Then the master, Wainamoinen,<br> Set the old men to the rowing,<br> Let the youth remain in waiting.<br> Lustily the aged heroes<br> Bend and try the oars of aspen,<br> But the distance is not lessened.</p> 
 <p>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Grasped the oars with master-magic,<br> And the boat leaped o'er the surges,<br> Swiftly sped across the billows;<br> Far and wide the oars resounded,<br> Quickly was the distance lessened.<br> With a rush and roar of waters<br> Ilmarinen sped his vessel,<br> Benches, ribs, and row-locks creaking,<br> Oars of aspen far resounding;<br> Flap the sails like wings of moor-cocks,<br> And the prow dips like a white-swan;<br> In the rear it croaks like ravens,<br> Loud the oars and rigging rattle.</p> 
 <p>Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<br> Sitting by the bending rudder,<br> Turns his magic vessel landward,<br> To a jutting promontory,<br> Where appears a Northland-village.<br> On the point stands Lemminkainen,<br> Kaukomieli, black magician,<br> Ahti, wizard of Wainola,<br> Wishing for the fish of Pohya,<br> Weeping for his fated dwelling,<br> For his perilous adventures,<br> Hard at work upon a vessel,<br> On the sail-yards of a fish-boat,<br> Near the hunger-point and island,<br> Near the village-home deserted.<br> Good the ears of the magician,<br> Good the wizard's eyes for seeing;<br> Casts his vision to the South-east,<br> Turns his eyes upon the sunset,<br> Sees afar a wondrous rainbow,<br> Farther on, a cloudlet hanging;<br> But the bow was a deception,<br> And the cloudlet a delusion;<br> 'Tis a vessel swiftly sailing,<br> 'Tis a war-ship flying northward,<br> O'er the blue-back of the broad-sea,<br> On the far-extending waters,<br> At the helm the master standing,<br> At the oars a mighty hero.<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "Do not know this wondrous vessel,<br> Not this well-constructed war-ship,<br> Coming from the distant Suomi,<br> Rowing for the hostile Pohya."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<br> Called aloud in tones of thunder<br> O'er the waters to the vessel;<br> Made the distant hills re-echo<br> With the music of his calling:<br> "Whence this vessel on the waters,<br> Whose the war-ship sailing hither?"</p> 
 <p>Spake the master of the vessel<br> To the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "Who art thou from fen or forest,<br> Senseless wizard from the woodlands,<br> That thou dost not know this vessel,<br> Magic war-ship of Wainola?<br> Dost not know him at the rudder,<br> Nor the hero at the row-locks?"<br> Spake the wizard, Lemminkainen:<br> "Well I know the helm-director,<br> And I recognize the rower;<br> Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<br> At the helm directs the vessel;<br> Ilmarinen does the rowing.<br> Whither is the vessel sailing,<br> Whither wandering, my heroes?<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "We are sailing to the Northland,<br> There to gain the magic Sampo,<br> There to get the lid in colors,<br> From the stone-berg of Pohyola,<br> From the copper-bearing mountain."<br> Spake the evil Lemminkainen:<br> "O, thou good, old Wainamoinen,<br> Take me with thee to Pohyola,<br> Make me third of magic heroes,<br> Since thou goest for the Sampo,<br> Goest for the lid in colors;<br> I shall prove a valiant soldier,<br> When thy wisdom calls for fighting;<br> I am skilled in arts of warfare!"</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Gave assent to Ahti's wishes;<br> Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<br> Hastened to Wainola's war-ship,<br> Bringing floats of aspen-timber,<br> To the ships of Wainamoinen.</p> 
 <p>Thus the hero of the Northland<br> Speaks to reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "There is aspen on my vessel,<br> Aspen-floats in great abundance,<br> And the boat is heavy-laden.<br> Wherefore dost thou bring the aspen<br> To the vessel of Wainola?"<br> Lemminkainen gave this answer:<br> "Not through caution sinks a vessel,<br> Nor a hay-stack by its proppings;<br> Seas abound in hidden dangers,<br> Heavy storms arise and threaten<br> Fell destruction to the sailor<br> That would brave the angry billows."<br> Spake the good, old Wainamoinen:<br> "Therefore is this warlike vessel<br> Built of trusty steel and copper,<br> Trimmed and bound in toughest iron,<br> That the winds may, not destroy it,<br> May not harm my ship of magic."</p>
