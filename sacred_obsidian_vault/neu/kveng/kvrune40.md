 <p>WAINAMOINEN, ancient minstrel,<br> Onward steered his goodly vessel,<br> From the isle of Lemminkainen,<br> From the borders of the village;<br> Steered his war-ship through the waters,<br> Sang it o'er the ocean-billows,<br> Joyful steered it to Pohyola.</p> 
 <p>On the banks were maidens standing,<br> And the daughters spake these measures:<br> "List the music on the waters!<br> What this wonderful rejoicing,<br> What this singing on the billows?<br> Far more beautiful this singing,<br> This rejoicing on the waters,<br> Than our ears have heard in Northland."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, the magician,<br> Steered his wonder-vessel onward,<br> Steered one day along the sea-shore,<br> Steered the next through shallow waters,<br> Steered the third day through the rivers.<br> Then the reckless Lemminkainen<br> Suddenly some words remembered,<br> He had heard along the fire-stream<br> Near the cataract and whirlpool,<br> And these words the hero uttered:<br> "Cease, O cataract, thy roaring,<br> Cease, O waterfall, thy foaming!<br> Maidens of the foam and current,<br> Sitting on the rocks in water,<br> On the stone-blocks in the river,<br> Take the foam and white-capped billows<br> In your arms and still their anger,<br> That our ships may pass in safety!<br> Aged dame beneath the eddy,<br> Thou that livest in the sea-foam,<br> Swimming, rise above the waters,<br> Lift thy head above the whirlpool,<br> Gather well the foam and billows<br> In thine arms and still their fury,<br> That our ship may pass in safety!<br> Ye, O rocks beneath the current,<br> Underneath the angry waters,<br> Lower well your heads of danger,<br> Sink below our magic vessel,<br> That our ship may pass in safety!</p> 
 <p>"Should this prayer prove inefficient,<br> Kimmo, hero son of Kammo,<br> Bore an outlet with thine auger,<br> Cut a channel for this vessel<br> Through the rocks beneath the waters,<br> That our ship may pass in safety!<br> Should all this prove unavailing,<br> Hostess of the running water,<br> Change to moss these rocky ledges,<br> Change this vessel to an air-bag,<br> That between these rocks and billows<br> It may float, and pass in safety!</p> 
 <p>"Virgin of the sacred whirlpool,<br> Thou whose home is in the river,<br> Spin from flax of strongest fiber,<br> Spin a thread of crimson color,<br> Draw it gently through the water,<br> That the thread our ship may follow,<br> And our vessel pass in safety!<br> Goddess of the helm, thou daughter<br> Of the ocean-winds and sea-foam,<br> Take thy helm endowed with mercy,<br> Guide our vessel through these dangers,<br> Hasten through these floods enchanted,<br> Passing by the house of envy,<br> By the gates of the enchanters,<br> That our ship may pass in safety!</p> 
 <p>"Should this prayer prove inefficient,<br> Ukko, Ruler of creation, .<br> Guide our vessel with thy fire-sword,<br> Guide it with thy blade of lightning,<br> Through the dangers of these rapids,<br> Through the cataract and whirlpool,<br> That our ship may pass in safety!"</p> 
 <p>Thereupon old Wainamoinen<br> Steered his boat through winds and waters,<br> Through the rocky chinks and channels,<br> Through the surges wildly tossing;<br> And the vessel passed in safety<br> Through the dangers of the current,<br> Through the sacred stream and whirlpool.<br> As it gains the open waters,<br> Gains at length the broad-lake's bosom,<br> Suddenly its motion ceases,<br> On some object firmly anchored.<br> Thereupon young Ilmarinen,<br> With the aid of Lemminkainen,<br> Plunges in the lake the rudder,<br> Struggles with the aid of magic;<br> But he cannot move the vessel,<br> Cannot free it from its moorings.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br> Thus addresses his companion:<br> "O thou hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Stoop and look beneath this war-ship,<br> See on what this boat is anchored,<br> See on what our craft is banging,<br> In this broad expanse of water,<br> In the broad-lake's deepest soundings,<br> If upon some rock or tree-snag,<br> Or upon some other hindrance."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<br> Looked beneath the magic vessel,<br> Peering through the crystal waters,<br> Spake and these the words be uttered:<br> "Does not rest upon a sand-bar,<br> Nor upon a rock, nor tree-snag,<br> But upon the back and shoulders<br> Of the mighty pike of Northland,<br> On the fin-bones of the monster."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<br> Spake these words to Lemminkainen:<br> "Many things we find in water,<br> Rocks, and trees, and fish, and sea-duck;<br> Are we on the pike's broad shoulders,<br> On the fin-bones of the monster,<br> Pierce the waters with thy broadsword,<br> Cut the monster into pieces."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen,<br> Reckless wizard, filled with courage,<br> Pulls his broadsword from his girdle,<br> From its sheath, the bone-divider,<br> Strikes with might of magic hero,<br> Headlong falls into the water;<br> And the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Lifts the wizard from the river,<br> Speaks these words to dripping Ahti:<br> "Accidents will come to mortals,<br> Accidents will come to heroes,<br> By the hundreds, by the thousands,<br> Even to the gods above us!"</p> 
 <p>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Drew his broadsword from his girdle,<br> From its sheath his blade of honor,<br> Tried to slay the pike of Northland<br> With the weapon of his forging;<br> But he broke his sword in pieces,<br> Did not harm the water-monster.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<br> Thus addresses his companions<br> "Poor apologies for heroes!<br> When occasion calls for victors,<br> When we need some great magician,<br> Need a hero filled with valor,<br> Then the arm that comes is feeble,<br> And the mind insane or witless,<br> Strength and reason gone to others!"</p> 
 <p>Straightway ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Miracle of strength and wisdom,<br> Draws his fire-sword from his girdle,<br> Wields the mighty blade of magic,<br> Strikes the waters as the lightning,<br> Strikes the pike beneath the vessel,<br> And impales, the mighty monster;<br> Raises him above the surface,<br> In the air the pike he circles,<br> Cuts the monster into pieces;<br> To the water falls the pike-tail,<br> To the ship the head and body;<br> Easily the ship moves onward.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<br> To the shore directs his vessel,<br> On the strand the boat he anchors,<br> Looks in every nook and corner<br> For the fragments of the monster;<br> Gathers well the parts together,<br> Speaks these words to those about him:<br> "Let the oldest of the heroes<br> Slice for me the pike of Northland,<br> Slice the fish to fitting morsels."</p> 
 <p>Answered all the men and heroes,<br> And the maidens spake, assenting:<br> "Worthier the catcher's fingers,<br> Wainamoinen's hands are sacred!"</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the wise magician<br> Drew a fish-knife from his girdle,<br> Sliced the pike to fitting morsels,<br> Spake again to those about him:<br> "Let the youngest of the maidens<br> Cook for me the pike of Northland,<br> Set for me a goodly dinner!"</p> 
 <p>All the maidens quick responded,<br> All the virgins vied in cooking;<br> Neither could outdo the other,<br> Thus the pike was rendered toothsome.<br> Feasted all the old magicians,<br> Feasted all the younger heroes,<br> Feasted all the men and maidens;<br> On the rocks were left the fish-bones,<br> Only relics of their feasting.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Looked upon the pile of fragments,<br> On the fish-bones looked and pondered,<br> Spake these words in meditation:<br> "Wondrous things might be constructed<br> From the relies of this monster,<br> Were they in the blacksmith's furnace,<br> In the hands of the magician,<br> In the hands of Ilmarinen."<br> Spake the blacksmith of Wainola:<br> "Nothing fine can be constructed<br> From the bones and teeth of fishes<br> By the skillful forger-artist,<br> By the hands of the magician."<br> These the words of Wainamoinen:<br> "Something wondrous might be builded<br> From these jaws, and teeth, and fish-bones;<br> Might a magic harp be fashioned,<br> Could an artist be discovered<br> That could shape them to my wishes."</p> 
 <p>But he found no fish-bone artist<br> That could shape the harp of joyance<br> From the relies of their feasting,<br> From the jaw-bones of the monster,<br> To the will of the magician.<br> Thereupon wise Wainamoinen<br> Set himself at work designing;<br> Quick became a fish-bone artist,<br> Made a harp of wondrous beauty,<br> Lasting joy and pride of Suomi.<br> Whence the harp's enchanting arches?<br> From the jaw-bones of the monster.<br> Whence the necessary harp-pins?<br> From the pike-teeth firmly fastened.<br> Whence the sweetly singing harp-strings?<br> From the tail of Lempo's stallion.<br> Thus was born the harp of magic<br> From the mighty pike of Northland,<br> From the relies from the feasting<br> Of the heroes of Wainola.<br> All the young men came to view it,<br> All the aged with their children,<br> Mothers with their beauteous daughters,<br> Maidens with their golden tresses;<br> All the people on the islands<br> Came to view the harp of joyance,<br> Pride and beauty of the Northland.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Let the aged try the harp-strings,<br> Gave it to the young magicians,<br> To the dames and to their daughters,<br> To the maidens, silver-tinselled,<br> To the singers of Wainola.<br> When the young men touched the harp-strings,<br> Then arose the notes of discord;<br> When the aged played upon it,<br> Dissonance their only music.<br> Spake the wizard, Lemminkainen:<br> "O ye witless, worthless children,<br> O ye senseless, useless maidens,<br> O ye wisdom-lacking heroes,<br> Cannot play this harp of magic,<br> Cannot touch the notes of concord!<br> Give to me this thing or beauty,<br> Hither bring the harp of fish-bones,<br> Let me try my skillful fingers."<br> Lemminkainen touched the harp-strings,<br> Carefully the strings adjusted,<br> Turned the harp in all directions,<br> Fingered all the strings in sequence,<br> Played the instrument of wonder,<br> But it did not speak in concord,<br> Did not sing the notes of joyance.<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "There is none among these maidens,<br> None among these youthful heroes,<br> None among the old magicians<br> That can play the harp of magic,<br> Touch the notes of joy and pleasure.<br> Let us take the harp to Pohya,<br> There to find a skillful player<br> That can touch the strings in concord."</p> 
 <p>Then they sailed to Sariola,<br> To Pohyola took the wonder,<br> There to find the harp a master.<br> All the heroes of Pohyola,<br> All the boys and all the maidens,<br> Ancient dames, and bearded minstrels,<br> Vainly touched the harp of beauty.</p> 
 <p>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br> Took the harp-strings in her fingers;<br> All the youth of Sariola,<br> Youth of every tribe and station,<br> Vainly touched the harp of fish-bone;<br> Could not find the notes of joyance,<br> Dissonance their only pleasure;<br> Shrieked the harp-strings like the whirlwinds,<br> All the tones wore harsh and frightful.</p> 
 <p>In a corner slept a blind man,<br> Lay a gray-beard on the oven,<br> Rousing from his couch of slumber,<br> Murmured thus within his corner:<br> "Cease at once this wretched playing,<br> Make an end of all this discord;<br> It benumbs mine ears for hearing,<br> Racks my brain, despoils my senses,<br> Robs me of the sweets of sleeping.<br> If the harp of Suomi's people<br> True delight cannot engender,<br> Cannot bring the notes of pleasure,<br> Cannot sing to sleep the aged,<br> Cast the thing upon the waters,<br> Sink it in the deeps of ocean,<br> Take it back to Kalevala,<br> To the home of him that made it,<br> To the bands of its creator."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the harp made answer,<br> To the blind man sang these measures:<br> "Shall not fall upon the waters,<br> Shall not sink within the ocean;<br> I will play for my creator,<br> Sing in melody and concord<br> In the fingers of my master."</p> 
 <p>Carefully the harp was carried<br> To the artist that had made it<br> To the hands of its creator,<br> To the feet of Wainamoinen.</p>
