 <p>WAINAMOINEN, old and truthful,<br> Did not learn the words of magic<br> In Tuoni's gloomy regions,<br> In the kingdom of Manala.<br> Thereupon he long debated,<br> Well considered, long reflected,<br> Where to find the magic sayings;<br> When a shepherd came to meet him,<br> Speaking thus to Wainamoinen:<br> "Thou canst find of words a hundred,<br> Find a thousand wisdom-sayings,<br> In the mouth of wise Wipunen,<br> In the body of the hero;<br> To the spot I know the foot-path,<br> To his tomb the magic highway,<br> Trodden by a host of heroes;<br> Long the distance thou must travel,<br> On the sharpened points of needles;<br> Then a long way thou must journey<br> On the edges of the broadswords;<br> Thirdly thou must travel farther<br> On the edges of the hatchets."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and trustful,<br> Well considered all these journeys,<br> Travelled to the forge and smithy,<br> Thus addressed the metal-worker:<br> "Ilmarinen, worthy blacksmith,<br> Make a shoe for me of iron,<br> Forge me gloves of burnished copper,<br> Mold a staff of strongest metal,<br> Lay the steel upon the inside,<br> Forge within the might of magic;<br> I am going on a journey<br> To procure the magic sayings,<br> Find the lost-words of the Master,<br> From the mouth of the magician,<br> From the tongue of wise Wipunen."<br> Spake the artist, Ilmarinen:<br> "Long ago died wise Wipunen,<br> Disappeared these many ages,<br> Lays no more his snares of copper,<br> Sets no longer traps of iron,<br> Cannot learn from him the wisdom,<br> Cannot find in him the lost-words."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, old and hopeful,<br> Little heeding, not discouraged,<br> In his metal shoes and armor,<br> Hastens forward on his journey,<br> Runs the first day fleetly onward,<br> On the sharpened points of needles;<br> 'Wearily he strides the second,<br> On the edges of the broadswords<br> Swings himself the third day forward,<br> On the edges of the hatchets.</p> 
 <p>Wise Wipunen, wisdom-singer,<br> Ancient bard, and great magician,<br> With his magic songs lay yonder,<br> Stretched beside him, lay his sayings,<br> On his shoulder grew the aspen,<br> On each temple grew the birch-tree,<br> On his mighty chin the alder,<br> From his beard grew willow-bushes,<br> From his mouth the dark green fir-tree,<br> And the oak-tree from his forehead.</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, coming closer,<br> Draws his sword, lays bare his hatchet<br> From his magic leathern scabbard,<br> Fells the aspen from his shoulder,<br> Fells the birch-tree from his temples,<br> From his chin he fells the alder,<br> From his beard, the branching willows,<br> From his mouth the dark-green fir-tree,<br> Fells the oak-tree from his forehead.</p> 
 <p>Now he thrusts his staff of iron<br> Through the mouth of wise Wipunen,<br> Pries his mighty jaws asunder,<br> Speaks these words of master-magic:<br> "Rise, thou master of magicians,<br> From the sleep of Tuonela,<br> From thine everlasting slumber!"</p> 
 <p>Wise Wipunen, ancient singer,<br> Quickly wakens from his sleeping,<br> Keenly feels the pangs of torture,<br> From the cruel staff of iron;<br> Bites with mighty force the metal,<br> Bites in twain the softer iron,<br> Cannot bite the steel asunder,<br> Opens wide his mouth in anguish.<br> Wainamoinen of Wainola,<br> In his iron-shoes and armor,<br> Careless walking, headlong stumbles<br> In the spacious mouth and fauces<br> Of the magic bard, Wipunen.<br> Wise Wipunen, full of song-charms,<br> Opens wide his mouth and swallows<br> Wainamoinen and his magic,<br> Shoes, and staff, and iron armor.<br> Then outspeaks the wise Wipunen:<br> "Many things before I've eaten,<br> Dined on goat, and sheep, and reindeer,<br> Bear, and ox, and wolf, and wild-boar,<br> Never in my recollection,<br> Have I tasted sweeter morsels!"<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Now I see the evil symbols,<br> See misfortune hanging o'er me,<br> In the darksome Hisi-hurdles,<br> In the catacombs of Kalma."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen long considered<br> How to live and how to prosper,<br> How to conquer this condition.<br> In his belt he wore a poniard,<br> With a handle hewn from birch-wood,<br> From the handle builds a vessel,<br> Builds a boat through magic science;<br> In this vessel rows he swiftly<br> Through the entrails of the hero,<br> Rows through every gland and vessel<br> Of the wisest of magicians.<br> Old Wipunen, master-singer,<br> Barely feels the hero's presence,<br> Gives no heed to Wainamoinen.<br> Then the artist of Wainola<br> Straightway sets himself to forging,<br> Sets at work to hammer metals;<br> Makes a smithy from his armor,<br> Of his sleeves he makes the bellows,<br> Makes the air-valve from his fur-coat,<br> From his stockings, makes the muzzle,<br> Uses knees instead of anvil,<br> Makes a hammer of his fore-arm;<br> Like the storm-wind roars the bellows,<br> Like the thunder rings the anvil;<br> Forges one day, then a second,<br> Forges till the third day closes,<br> In the body of Wipunen,<br> In the sorcerer's abdomen.</p> 
 <p>Old Wipunen, full of magic,<br> Speaks these words in wonder, guessing:<br> "Who art thou of ancient heroes,<br> Who of all the host of heroes?<br> Many heroes I have eaten,<br> And of men a countless number,<br> Have not eaten such as thou art;<br> Smoke arises from my nostrils,<br> From my mouth the fire is streaming,<br> In my throat are iron-clinkers.</p> 
 <p>"Go, thou monster, hence to wander,<br> Flee this place, thou plague of Northland,<br> Ere I go to seek thy mother,<br> Tell the ancient dame thy mischief;<br> She shall bear thine evil conduct,<br> Great the burden she shall carry;<br> Great a mother's pain and anguish,<br> When her child runs wild and lawless;<br> Cannot comprehend the meaning,<br> Nor this mystery unravel,<br> Why thou camest here, O monster,<br> Camest here to give me torture.<br> Art thou Hisi sent from heaven,<br> Some calamity from Ukko?<br> Art, perchance, some new creation,<br> Ordered here to do me evil?<br> If thou art some evil genius,<br> Some calamity from Ukko,<br> Sent to me by my Creator,<br> Then am I resigned to suffer<br> God does not forsake the worthy,<br> Does not ruin those that trust him,<br> Never are the good forsaken.<br> If by man thou wert created,<br> If some hero sent thee hither,<br> I shall learn thy race of evil,<br> Shall destroy thy wicked tribe-folk.</p> 
 <p>"Thence arose the violation,<br> Thence arose the first destruction,<br> Thence came all the evil-doings:<br> From the neighborhood of wizards,<br> From the homes of the magicians,<br> From the eaves of vicious spirits,<br> From the haunts of fortune-tellers,<br> From the cabins of the witches,<br> From the castles of Tuoni,<br> From the bottom of Manala,<br> From the ground with envy swollen,<br> From Ingratitude's dominions,<br> From the rocky shoals and quicksands,<br> From the marshes filled with danger,<br> From the cataract's commotion,<br> From the bear-caves in the mountains,<br> From the wolves within the thickets,<br> From the roarings of the pine-tree,<br> From the burrows of the fox-dog,<br> From the woodlands of the reindeer,<br> From the eaves and Hisi-hurdles,<br> From the battles of the giants,<br> From uncultivated pastures,<br> From the billows of the oceans,<br> From the streams of boiling waters,<br> From the waterfalls of Rutya,<br> From the limits of the storm-clouds,<br> From the pathways of the thunders,<br> From the flashings of the lightnings,<br> From the distant plains of Pohya,<br> From the fatal stream and whirlpool,<br> From the birthplace of Tuoni.</p> 
 <p>"Art thou coming from these places?<br> Hast thou, evil, hastened hither,<br> To the heart of sinless hero,<br> To devour my guiltless body,<br> To destroy this wisdom-singer?<br> Get thee hence, thou dog of Lempo,<br> Leave, thou monster from Manala,<br> Flee from mine immortal body,<br> Leave my liver, thing of evil,<br> In my body cease thy forging,<br> Cease this torture of my vitals,<br> Let me rest in peace and slumber.</p> 
 <p>"Should I want in means efficient,<br> Should I lack the magic power<br> To outroot thine evil genius,<br> I shall call a better hero,<br> Call upon a higher power,<br> To remove this dire misfortune,<br> To annihilate this monster.<br> I shall call the will of woman,<br> From the fields, the old-time heroes?<br> Mounted heroes from the sand-hills,<br> Thus to rescue me from danger,<br> From these pains and ceaseless tortures.</p> 
 <p>"If this force prove inefficient,<br> Should not drive thee from my body,<br> Come, thou forest, with thy heroes,<br> Come, ye junipers and pine-trees,<br> With your messengers of power,<br> Come, ye mountains, with your wood-nymphs,<br> Come, ye lakes, with all your mermaids,<br> Come, ye hundred ocean-spearmen,<br> Come, torment this son of Hisi,<br> Come and kill this evil monster.</p> 
 <p>"If this call is inefficient,<br> Does not drive thee from my vitals,<br> Rise, thou ancient water-mother,<br> With thy blue-cap from the ocean,<br> From the seas, the lakes, the rivers,<br> Bring protection to thy hero,<br> Comfort bring and full assistance,<br> That I guiltless may not suffer,<br> May not perish prematurely.</p> 
 <p>"Shouldst thou brave this invocation,<br> Kapè, daughter of Creation,<br> Come, thou beauteous, golden maiden,<br> Oldest of the race of women,<br> Come and witness my misfortunes,<br> Come and turn away this evil,<br> Come, remove this biting torment,<br> Take away this plague of Piru.</p> 
 <p>"If this call be disregarded,<br> If thou wilt not leave me guiltless,<br> Ukko, on the arch of heaven,<br> In the thunder-cloud dominions,<br> Come thou quickly, thou art needed,<br> Come, protect thy tortured hero,<br> Drive away this magic demon,<br> Banish ever his enchantment,<br> With his sword and flaming furnace,<br> With his fire-enkindling bellows.</p> 
 <p>"Go, thou demon, hence to wander,<br> Flee, thou plague of Northland heroes;<br> Never come again for shelter,<br> Nevermore build thou thy dwelling<br> In the body of Wipunen;<br> Take at once thy habitation<br> To the regions of thy kindred,<br> To thy distant fields and firesides;<br> When thy journey thou hast ended,<br> Gained the borders of thy country,<br> Gained the meads of thy Creator,<br> Give a signal of thy coming,<br> Rumble like the peals of thunder,<br> Glisten like the gleam of lightning,<br> Knock upon the outer portals,<br> Enter through the open windows,<br> Glide about the many chambers,<br> Seize the host and seize the hostess,<br> Knock their evil beads together,<br> Wring their necks and hurl their bodies<br> To the black-dogs of the forest.</p> 
 <p>"Should this prove of little value,<br> Hover like the bird of battle,<br> O'er the dwellings of the master,<br> Scare the horses from the mangers,<br> From the troughs affright the cattle,<br> Twist their tails, and horns, and forelocks,<br> Hurl their carcasses to Lempo.</p> 
 <p>"If some scourge the winds have sent me,<br> Sent me on the air of spring-tide,<br> Brought me by the frosts of winter,<br> Quickly journey whence thou camest,<br> On the air-path of the heavens,<br> Perching not upon some aspen,<br> Resting not upon the birch-tree;<br> Fly away to copper mountains,<br> That the copper-winds may nurse thee,<br> Waves of ether, thy protection.</p> 
 <p>"Didst those come from high Jumala,<br> From the hems of ragged snow-clouds,<br> Quick ascend beyond the cloud-space,<br> Quickly journey whence thou camest,<br> To the snow-clouds, crystal-sprinkled,<br> To the twinkling stars of heaven<br> There thy fire may burn forever,<br> There may flash thy forked lightnings,<br> In the Sun's undying furnace.</p> 
 <p>"Wert thou sent here by the spring-floods,<br> Driven here by river-torrents?<br> Quickly journey whence thou camest,<br> Quickly hasten to the waters,<br> To the borders of the rivers,<br> To the ancient water-mountain,<br> That the floods again may rock thee,<br> And thy water-mother nurse thee.</p> 
 <p>"Didst thou come from Kalma's kingdom,<br> From the castles of the death-land?<br> Haste thou back to thine own country,<br> To the Kalma-halls and castles,<br> To the fields with envy swollen,<br> Where contending armies perish.</p> 
 <p>"Art thou from the Hisi-woodlands,<br> From ravines in Lempo's forest,<br> From the thickets of the pine-wood,<br> From the dwellings of the fir-glen?<br> Quick retrace thine evil footsteps<br> To the dwellings of thy master,<br> To the thickets of thy kindred;<br> There thou mayest dwell at pleasure,<br> Till thy house decays about thee,<br> Till thy walls shall mould and crumble.</p> 
 <p>Evil genius, thee I banish,<br> Got thee hence, thou horrid monster,<br> To the caverns of the white-bear,<br> To the deep abysm of serpents,<br> To the vales, and swamps, and fenlands,<br> To the ever-silent waters,<br> To the hot-springs of the mountains,<br> To the dead-seas of the Northland,<br> To the lifeless lakes and rivers,<br> To the sacred stream and whirlpool.</p> 
 <p>"Shouldst thou find no place of resting,<br> I will banish thee still farther,<br> To the Northland's distant borders,<br> To the broad expanse of Lapland,<br> To the ever-lifeless deserts,<br> To the unproductive prairies,<br> Sunless, moonless, starless, lifeless,<br> In the dark abyss of Northland;<br> This for thee, a place befitting,<br> Pitch thy tents and feast forever<br> On the dead plains of Pohyola.</p> 
 <p>"Shouldst thou find no means of living,<br> I will banish thee still farther,<br> To the cataract of Rutya,<br> To the fire-emitting whirlpool,<br> Where the firs are ever falling,<br> To the windfalls of the forest;<br> Swim hereafter in the waters<br> Of the fire-emitting whirlpool,<br> Whirl thou ever in the current<br> Of the cataract's commotion,<br> In its foam and boiling waters.</p> 
 <p>Should this place be unbefitting,<br> I will drive thee farther onward,<br> To Tuoni's coal-black river,<br> To the endless stream of Mana,<br> Where thou shalt forever linger;<br> Thou canst never leave Manala,<br> Should I not thy head deliver,<br> Should I never pay thy ransom;<br> Thou canst never safely journey<br> Through nine brother-rams abutting,<br> Through nine brother-bulls opposing<br> Through nine brother-stallions thwarting,<br> Thou canst not re-cross Death-river<br> Thickly set with iron netting,<br> Interlaced with threads of copper.</p> 
 <p>"Shouldst thou ask for steeds for saddle,<br> Shouldst thou need a fleet-foot courser,<br> I will give thee worthy racers,<br> I will give thee saddle-horses;<br> Evil Hisi has a charger,<br> Crimson mane, and tail, and foretop,<br> Fire emitting from his nostrils,<br> As he prances through his pastures;<br> Hoofs are made of strongest iron,<br> Legs are made of steel and copper,<br> Quickly scales the highest mountains,<br> Darts like lightning through the valleys,<br> When a skilful master rides him.</p> 
 <p>"Should this steed be insufficient,<br> I will give thee Lempo's snow-shoes,<br> Give thee Hisi's shoes of elm-wood,<br> Give to thee the staff of Piru,<br> That with these thou mayest journey<br> Into Hisi's courts and castles,<br> To the woods and fields of Juutas;<br> If the rocks should rise before thee,<br> Dash the flinty rocks in pieces,<br> Hurl the fragments to the heavens;<br> If the branches cross thy pathway,<br> Make them turn aside in greeting;<br> If some mighty hero hail thee,<br> Hurl him headlong to the woodlands.</p> 
 <p>"Hasten hence, thou thing of evil,<br> Heinous monster, leave my body,<br> Ere the breaking of the morning<br> Ere the Sun awakes from slumber,<br> Ere the sinning of the cuckoo;<br> Haste away, thou plague of Northland,<br> Haste along the track of' moonbeams,<br> Wander hence, forever wander,<br> To the darksome fields or Pohya.</p> 
 <p>"If at once thou dost not leave me,<br> I will send the eagle's talons,<br> Send to thee the beaks of vultures,<br> To devour thine evil body,<br> Hurl thy skeleton to Hisi.<br> Much more quickly cruel Lempo<br> Left my vitals when commanded,<br> When I called the aid of Ukko,<br> Called the help of my Creator.<br> Flee, thou motherless offendant,<br> Flee, thou fiend of Sariola,<br> Flee, thou hound without a master,<br> Ere the morning sun arises,<br> Ere the Moon withdraws to slumber!"</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, ancient hero,<br> Speaks at last to old Wipunen:<br> "Satisfied am I to linger<br> In these old and spacious caverns,<br> Pleasant here my home and dwelling;<br> For my meat I have thy tissues,<br> Have thy heart, and spleen, and liver,<br> For my drink the blood of ages,<br> Goodly home for Wainamoinen.</p> 
 <p>"I shall set my forge and bellows<br> Deeper, deeper in thy vitals;<br> I shall swing my heavy hammer,<br> Swing it with a greater power<br> On thy heart, and lungs, and liver;<br> I shall never, never leave thee<br> Till I learn thine incantations,<br> Learn thy many wisdom-sayings,<br> Learn the lost-words of the Master;<br> Never must these words be bidden,<br> Earth must never lose this wisdom,<br> Though the wisdom-singers perish."</p> 
 <p>Old Wipunen, wise magician,<br> Ancient prophet, filled with power,<br> Opens fall his store of knowledge,<br> Lifts the covers from his cases,<br> Filled with old-time incantations,<br> Filled with songs of times primeval,<br> Filled with ancient wit and wisdom;<br> Sings the very oldest folk-songs,<br> Sings the origin of witchcraft,<br> Sings of Earth and its beginning<br> Sings the first of all creations,<br> Sings the source of good and evil<br> Sung alas! by youth no longer,<br> Only sung in part by heroes<br> In these days of sin and sorrow.<br> Evil days our land befallen.<br> Sings the orders of enchantment.<br> How, upon the will of Ukko,<br> By command of the Creator,<br> How the air was first divided,<br> How the water came from ether,<br> How the earth arose from water,<br> How from earth came vegetation,<br> Fish, and fowl, and man, and hero.</p> 
 <p>Sings again the wise Wipunen,<br> How the Moon was first created,<br> How the Sun was set in heaven,<br> Whence the colors of the rainbow,<br> Whence the ether's crystal pillars,<br> How the skies with stars were sprinkled.</p> 
 <p>Then again sings wise Wipunen,<br> Sings in miracles of concord,<br> Sings in magic tones of wisdom,<br> Never was there heard such singing;<br> Songs he sings in countless numbers,<br> Swift his notes as tongues of serpents,<br> All the distant hills re-echo;<br> Sings one day, and then a second,<br> Sings a third from dawn till evening,<br> Sings from evening till the morning;<br> Listen all the stars of heaven,<br> And the Moon stands still and listens<br> Fall the waves upon the deep-sea,<br> In the bay the tides cease rising,<br> Stop the rivers in their courses,<br> Stops the waterfall of Rutya,<br> Even Jordan ceases flowing,<br> And the Wuoksen stops and listens.</p> 
 <p>When the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Well had learned the magic sayings,<br> Learned the ancient songs and legends,<br> Learned the words of ancient wisdom,<br> Learned the lost-words of the Master,<br> Well had learned the secret doctrine,<br> He prepared to leave the body<br> Of the wisdom-bard, Wipunen,<br> Leave the bosom of the master,<br> Leave the wonderful enchanter.<br> Spake the hero, Wainamoinen:<br> "O, thou Antero Wipunen,<br> Open wide thy mouth and fauces,<br> I have found the magic lost-words,<br> I will leave thee now forever,<br> Leave thee and thy wondrous singing,<br> Will return to Kalevala,<br> To Wainola's fields and firesides."<br> Thus Wipunen spake in answer:<br> "Many are the things I've eaten,<br> Eaten bear, and elk, and reindeer,<br> Eaten ox, and wolf, and wild-boar,<br> Eaten man, and eaten hero,<br> Never, never have I eaten<br> Such a thing as Wainamoinen;<br> Thou hast found what thou desirest,<br> Found the three words of the Master;<br> Go in peace, and ne'er returning,<br> Take my blessing on thy going."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the bard Wipunen<br> Opens wide his mouth, and wider;<br> And the good, old Wainamoinen<br> Straightway leaves the wise enchanter,<br> Leaves Wipunen's great abdomen;<br> From the mouth he glides and journeys<br> O'er the hills and vales of Northland,<br> Swift as red-deer or the forest,<br> Swift as yellow-breasted marten,<br> To the firesides of Wainola,<br> To the plains of Kalevala.</p> 
 <p>Straightway hastes he to the smithy<br> Of his brother, Ilmarinen,<br> Thus the iron-artist greets him:<br> Hast thou found the long-lost wisdom,<br> Hast thou heard the secret doctrine,<br> Hast thou learned the master magic,<br> How to fasten in the ledges,<br> How the stern should be completed,<br> How complete the ship's forecastle?<br> Wainamoinen thus made answer:<br> "I have learned of words a hundred,<br> Learned a thousand incantations,<br> Hidden deep for many ages,<br> Learned the words of ancient wisdom,<br> Found the keys of secret doctrine,<br> Found the lost-words of the Master."</p> 
 <p>Wainamoinen, magic-builder,<br> Straightway journeys to his vessel,<br> To the spot of magic labor,<br> Quickly fastens in the ledges,<br> Firmly binds the stern together<br> And completes the boat's forecastle.<br> Thus the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Built the boat with magic only,<br> And with magic launched his vessel,<br> Using not the hand to touch it,<br> Using not the foot to move it,<br> Using not the knee to turn it,<br> Using nothing to propel it.<br> Thus the third task was completed,<br> For the hostess of Pohyola,<br> Dowry for the Maid of Beauty<br> Sitting on the arch of heaven,<br> On the bow of many colors.</p>
