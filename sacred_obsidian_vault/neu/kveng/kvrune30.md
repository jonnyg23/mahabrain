 <p>LEMMINKAINEN, reckless ministrel,<i>[sic]</i><br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Hastens as the dawn is breaking,<br> At the dawning of the morning,<br> To the resting-place of vessels,<br> To the harbor of the island,<br> Finds the vessels sorely weeping,<br> Hears the wailing of the rigging,<br> And the ships intone this chorus:<br> "Must we wretched lie forever<br> In the harbor of this island,<br> Here to dry and fall in pieces?<br> Ahti wars no more in Northland,<br> Wars no more for sixty summers,<br> Even should he thirst for silver,<br> Should he wish the gold of battle."</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen struck his vessels<br> With his gloves adorned with copper,<br> And addressed the ships as follows:<br> "Mourn no more, my ships of fir-wood,<br> Strong and hardy is your rigging,<br> To the wars ye soon may hasten,<br> Hasten to the seas of battle;<br> Warriors may swarm your cabins<br> Ere to-morrow's morn has risen.!'"</p> 
 <p>Then the reckless Lemminkainen<br> Hastened to his aged mother,<br> Spake to her the words that follow:<br> "Weep no longer, faithful mother,<br> Do not sorrow for thy hero,<br> Should he leave for scenes of battle,<br> For the hostile fields of Pohya;<br> Sweet revenge has fired my spirit,<br> And my soul is well determined,<br> To avenge the shameful insult<br> That the warriors of Northland<br> Gave to thee, defenseless woman."</p> 
 <p>To restrain him seeks his mother,<br> Warns her son again of danger:<br> "Do not go, my son beloved,<br> To the wars in Sariola;<br> There the jaws of Death await thee,<br> Fell destruction lies before thee!"</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen, little heeding,<br> Still determined, speaks as follows:<br> "Where may I secure a swordsman,<br> Worthy of my race of heroes,<br> To assist me in the combat?<br> Often I have heard of Tiera,<br> Heard of Kura of the islands,<br> This one I will take to help me,<br> Magic hero of the broadsword;<br> He will aid me in the combat,<br> Will protect me from destruction."</p> 
 <p>Then he wandered to the islands,<br> On the way to Tiera's hamlet,<br> These the words that Ahti utters<br> As he nears the ancient dwellings:<br> Dearest friend, my noble Tiera,<br> My, beloved hero-brother,<br> Dost thou other times remember,<br> When we fought and bled together,<br> On the battle-fields of Northland?<br> There was not an island-village<br> Where there were not seven mansions,<br> In each mansion seven heroes,<br> And not one of all these foemen<br> Whom we did not slay with broadswords,<br> Victims of our skill and valor."</p> 
 <p>Near the window sat the father<br> Whittling out a javelin-handle;<br> Near the threshold sat the mother<br> Skimming cream and making butter;<br> Near the portal stood the brother<br> Working on a sledge of birch-wood<br> Near the bridge-pass were the sisters<br> Washing out their varied garments.<br> Spake the father from the window,<br> From the threshold spake the mother,<br> From the portals spake the brother,<br> And the sisters from the bridge-pass:<br> "Tiera has no time for combat,<br> And his broadsword cannot battle;<br> Tiera is but late a bridegroom,<br> Still unveiled his bride awaits him."</p> 
 <p>Near the hearth was Tiera lying,<br> Lying by the fire was Kura,<br> Hastily one foot was shoeing,<br> While the other lay in waiting.<br> From the hook he takes his girdle,<br> Buckles it around his body,<br> Takes a javelin from its resting,<br> Not the largest, nor the smallest,<br> Buckles on his mighty scabbard,<br> Dons his heavy mail of copper;<br> On each javelin pranced a charger,<br> Wolves were howling from his helmet,<br> On the rings the bears were growling.<br> Tiera poised his mighty javelin,<br> Launched the spear upon its errand;<br> Hurled the shaft across the pasture,<br> To the border of the forest,<br> O'er the clay-fields of Pohyola,<br> O'er the green and fragrant meadows,<br> Through the distant bills of Northland.<br> Then great Tiera touched his javelin<br> To the mighty spear of Ahti,<br> Pledged his aid to Lemminkainen,<br> As his combatant and comrade.<br> Thereupon wild Kaukomieli<br> Pushed his boat upon the waters;<br> Like the serpent through the heather,<br> Like the creeping of the adder,<br> Sails the boat away to Pohya,<br> O'er the seas of Sariola.</p> 
 <p>Quick the wicked hostess, Louhi,<br> Sends the black-frost of the heavens<br> To the waters of Pohyola,<br> O'er the far-extending sea-plains,<br> Gave the black-frost these directions:<br> "Much-loved Frost, my son and hero,<br> Whom thy mother has instructed,<br> Hasten whither I may send thee,<br> Go wherever I command thee,<br> Freeze the vessel of this hero,<br> Lemminkainen's bark of magic,<br> On the broad back of the ocean,<br> On the far-extending waters;<br> Freeze the wizard in his vessel,<br> Freeze to ice the wicked Ahti,<br> That he never more may wander,<br> Never waken while thou livest,<br> Or at least till I shall free him,<br> Wake him from his icy slumber!"</p> 
 <p>Frost, the son of wicked parents,<br> Hero-son of evil manners,<br> Hastens off to freeze the ocean,<br> Goes to fasten down the flood-gates,<br> Goes to still the ocean-currents.<br> As he hastens on his journey,<br> Takes the leaves from all the forest,<br> Strips the meadows of their verdure,<br> Robs the flowers of their colors.<br> When his journey he had ended,<br> Gained the border of the ocean,<br> Gained the sea-shore curved and endless,<br> On the first night of his visit,<br> Freezes he the lakes and rivers,<br> Freezes too the shore of ocean,<br> Freezes not the ocean-billows,<br> Does not check the ocean-currents.<br> On the sea a finch is resting,<br> Bird of song upon the waters,<br> But his feet are not yet frozen,<br> Neither is his head endangered.<br> When the second night Frost lingered,<br> He began to grow important,<br> He became a fierce intruder,<br> Fearless grew in his invasions,<br> Freezes everything before him;<br> Sends the fiercest cold of Northland,<br> Turns to ice the boundless waters.<br> Ever thicker, thicker, thicker,<br> Grew the ice on sea and ocean,<br> Ever deeper, deeper, deeper,<br> Fell the snow on field and forest,<br> Froze the hero's ship of beauty,<br> Cold and lifeless bark of Ahti;<br> Sought to freeze wild Lemminkainen,<br> Freeze him lifeless as his vessel,<br> Asked the minstrel for his life-blood,<br> For his ears, and feet, and fingers.</p> 
 <p>Then the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Angry grew and filled with magic,<br> Hurled the black-frost to the fire-god,<br> Threw him to the fiery furnace,<br> Held him in his forge of iron,<br> Then addressed the frost as follows:<br> "Frost, thou evil son of Northland,<br> Dire and only son of Winter,<br> Let my members not be stiffened,<br> Neither ears, nor feet, nor fingers,<br> Neither let my head be frozen.<br> Thou hast other things to feed on,<br> Many other beads to stiffen;<br> Leave in peace the flesh of heroes,<br> Let this minstrel pass in safety,<br> Freeze the swamps, and lakes, and rivers,<br> Fens and forests, bills and valleys;<br> Let the cold stones grow still colder,<br> Freeze the willows in the waters,<br> Let the aspens freeze and suffer,<br> Let the bark peel from the birch-trees,<br> Let the Pines burst on the mountains,<br> Let this hero pass in safety,<br> Do not let his locks be stiffened.</p> 
 <p>"If all these prove insufficient,<br> Feed on other worthy matters;<br> Lot the hot stones freeze asunder,<br> Let the flaming rocks be frozen,<br> Freeze the fiery blocks of iron,<br> Freeze to ice the iron mountains;<br> Stiffen well the mighty Wuoksi,<br> Let Imatra freeze to silence;<br> Freeze the sacred stream and whirlpoo4<br> Let their boiling billows stiffen,<br> Or thine origin I'll sing thee,<br> Tell thy lineage of evil.<br> Well I know thine evil nature,<br> Know thine origin and power,<br> Whence thou camest, where thou goest,<br> Know thine ancestry of evil.<br> Thou wert born upon the aspen,<br> Wert conceived upon the willows,<br> Near the borders of Pohyola,<br> In the courts of dismal Northland;<br> Sin-begotten was thy father,<br> And thy mother was Dishonor.</p> 
 <p>"While in infancy who fed thee<br> While thy mother could not nurse thee?<br> Surely thou wert fed by adders,<br> Nursed by foul and slimy serpents;<br> North-winds rocked thee into slumber,<br> Cradled thee in roughest weather,<br> In the worst of willow-marshes,<br> In the springs forever flowing,<br> Evil-born and evil-nurtured,<br> Grew to be an evil genius,<br> Evil was thy mind and spirit,<br> And the infant still was nameless,<br> Till the name of Frost was given<br> To the progeny of evil.</p> 
 <p>"Then the young lad lived in hedges,<br> Dwelt among the weeds and willows,<br> Lived in springs in days of summer,<br> On the borders of the marshes,<br> Tore the lindens in the winter,<br> Stormed among the glens and forests,<br> Raged among the sacred birch-trees,<br> Rattled in the alder-branches,<br> Froze the trees, the shoots, the grasses,<br> Evened all the plains and prairies,<br> Ate the leaves within the woodlands,<br> Made the stalks drop down their blossoms,<br> Peeled the bark on weeds and willows.</p> 
 <p>"Thou hast grown to large proportions,<br> Hast become too tall and mighty;<br> Dost thou labor to benumb me,<br> Dost thou wish mine ears and fingers,<br> Of my feet wouldst thou deprive me?<br> Do not strive to freeze this hero,<br> In his anguish and misfortune;<br> In my stockings I shall kindle<br> Fire to drive thee from my presence,<br> In my shoes lay flaming faggots,<br> Coals of fire in every garment,<br> Heated sandstones in my rigging;<br> Thus will hold thee at a distance.<br> Then thine evil form I'll banish<br> To the farthest Northland borders;<br> When thy journey is completed,<br> When thy home is reached in safety,<br> Freeze the caldrons in the castle,<br> Freeze the coal upon the hearthstone,<br> In the dough, the hands of women,<br> On its mother's lap, the infant,<br> Freeze the colt beside its mother.</p> 
 <p>"If thou shouldst not heed this order,<br> I shall banish thee still farther,<br> To the carbon-piles of Hisi,<br> To the chimney-hearth of Lempo,<br> Hurl thee to his fiery furnace,<br> Lay thee on the iron anvil,<br> That thy body may be hammered<br> With the sledges of the blacksmith,<br> May be pounded into atoms,<br> Twixt the anvil and the hammer.</p> 
 <p>"If thou shouldst not heed this order,<br> Shouldst not leave me to my freedom,<br> Know I still another kingdom,<br> Know another spot of resting;<br> I shall drive thee to the summer,<br> Lead thy tongue to warmer climates,<br> There a prisoner to suffer,<br> Never to obtain thy freedom<br> Till thy spirit I deliver,<br> Till I go myself and free thee."</p> 
 <p>Wicked Frost, the son of Winter,<br> Saw the magic bird of evil<br> Hovering above his spirit,<br> Straightway prayed for Ahti's mercy,<br> These the words the Frost-fiend uttered:<br> "Let us now agree together,<br> Neither one to harm the other,<br> Never in the course of ages,<br> Never while the moonlight glimmers<br> On the snow-capped hills of Northland.<br> If thou hearest that I bring thee<br> Cold to freeze thy feet and fingers,<br> Hurl me to the fiery furnace,<br> Hammer me upon the anvil<br> Of the blacksmith, Ilmarinen;<br> Lead my tongue to warmer climates,<br> Banish me to lands of summer,<br> There a prisoner to suffer,<br> Nevermore to gain my freedom."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<br> Left his vessel in the ocean,<br> Frozen in the ice of Northland,<br> Left his warlike boat forever,<br> Started on his cheerless journey<br> To the borders of Pohyola,<br> And the mighty Tiera followed<br> In the tracks of his companion.<br> On the ice they journeyed northward<br> Briskly walked upon the ice-plain,<br> Walked one day, and then a second,<br> Till the closing of the third day,<br> When the Hunger-land approached them,<br> When appeared Starvation-island.</p> 
 <p>Here the hardy Lemminkainen<br> Hastened forward to the castle,<br> This the hero's prayer and question;<br> "Is there food within this castle,<br> Fish or fowl within its larders,<br> To refresh us on our journey,<br> Mighty heroes, cold and weary?<br> When the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Found no food within the castle,<br> Neither fish, nor fowl, nor bacon,<br> Thus he cursed it and departed:<br> "May the fire destroy these chambers,<br> May the waters flood this dwelling,<br> Wash it to the seas of Mana!"</p> 
 <p>Then they hastened onward, onward,<br> Hastened on through field and forest,<br> Over by-ways long untrodden,<br> Over unknown paths and snow-fields;<br> Here the hardy Lemminkainen,<br> Reckless hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Pulled the soft wool from the ledges,<br> Gathered lichens from the tree-trunks,<br> Wove them into magic stockings,<br> Wove them into shoes and mittens,<br> On the settles of the hoar-frost,<br> In the stinging cold of Northland.</p> 
 <p>Then he sought to find some pathway,<br> That would guide their wayward footsteps,<br> And the hero spake as follows:<br> "O thou Tiera, friend beloved,<br> Shall we reach our destination,<br> Wandering for days together,<br> Through these Northland fields and forests?<br> Kura thus replies to Ahti:<br> "We, alas! have come for vengeance,<br> Come for blood and retribution,<br> To the battle-fields of Northland,<br> To the dismal Sariola,<br> Here to leave our souls and bodies,<br> Here to starve, and freeze, and perish,<br> In the dreariest of places,<br> In this sun-forsaken country!<br> Never shall we gain the knowledge,<br> Never learn it, never tell it,<br> Which the pathway that can guide us<br> To the forest-beds to suffer,<br> To the Pohya-plains to perish,<br> In the home-land of the ravens,<br> Fitting food for crows and eagles.<br> Often do the Northland vultures<br> Hither come to feed their fledgelings;<br> Hither bring the birds of heaven<br> Bits of flesh and blood of heroes;<br> Often do the beaks of ravens<br> Tear the flesh of kindred corpses,<br> Often do the eagle's talons<br> Carry bones and trembling vitals,<br> Such as ours, to feed their nestlings,<br> In their rocky homes and ledges.</p> 
 <p>"Oh! my mother can but wonder,<br> Never can divine the answer,<br> Where her reckless son is roaming,<br> Where her hero's blood is flowing,<br> Whether in the swamps and lowlands<br> Whether in the heat of battle,<br> Or upon the waves of the ocean,<br> Or upon the hop-feld mountains,<br> Or along some forest by-way.<br> Nothing can her mind discover<br> Of the frailest of her heroes,<br> Only think that he has perished.<br> Thus the hoary-headed mother<br> Weeps and murmurs in her chambers:<br> 'Where is now my son beloved,<br> In the kingdom of Manala?<br> Sow thy crops, thou dread Tuoni,<br> Harrow well the fields of Kalma!<br> Now the bow receives its respite<br> From the fingers of my Tiera;<br> Bow and arrow now are useless,<br> Now the merry birds can fatten<br> In the fields, and fens, and forests;<br> Bears may live in dens of freedom,<br> On the fields may sport the elk-herds.'"<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "Thus it is, mine aged mother,<br> Thou that gavest me existence!<br> Thou hast reared thy broods of chickens,<br> Hatched and reared thy flights of white-swans<br> All of them the winds have scattered,<br> Or the evil Lempo frightened;<br> One flew hither, and one thither,<br> And a third one, lost forever!<br> Think thou of our former pleasures,<br> Of our better days together,<br> When I wandered like the flowers,<br> Like the berry in the meadows.<br> Many saw my form majestic,<br> Many thought me well-proportioned.<br> Now is not as then with Ahti,<br> Into evil days have fallen,<br> Since I see but storms and darkness!<br> Then my eyes beheld but sunshine,<br> Then we did not weep and murmur,<br> Did not fill our hearts with sorrow,<br> When the maids in joy were singing,<br> When the virgins twined their tresses;<br> Then the women joined in joyance,<br> Whether brides were happy-wedded,<br> Whether bridegrooms choose discreetly,<br> Whether they were wise or unwise.</p> 
 <p>"But we must not grow disheartened,<br> Let the Island-maidens cheer us;<br> Here we are not yet enchanted,<br> Not bewitched by magic singing,<br> On the paths not left to perish,<br> Sink and perish on our journey.<br> Full of youth we should not suffer,<br> Strong, we should not die unworthy,<br> Whom the wizards have enchanted,<br> Have bewitched with songs of magic;<br> Sorcerers may charm and conquer,<br> Bury them within their dungeons,<br> Hide them spell-bound in their cabins.<br> Let the wizards charm each other,<br> And bewitch their magic offspring,<br> Bring their tribes to fell destruction.<br> Never did my gray-haired father<br> Bow submission to a wizard,<br> Offer worship to magicians.<br> These the words my father uttered,<br> These the thoughts his son advances:<br> 'Guard us, thou O great Creator,<br> Shield us, thou O God of mercy,<br> With thine arms of grace protect us,<br> Help us with thy strength and wisdom,<br> Guide the minds of all thy heroes,<br> Keep aright the thoughts of women,<br> Keep the old from speaking evil,<br> Keep the young from sin and folly,<br> Be to us a help forever,<br> Be our Guardian and our Father,<br> That our children may not wander<br> From the ways of their Creator,<br> From the path that God has given!'"</p> 
 <p>Then the hero Lemminkainen,<br> Made from cares the fleetest racers,<br> Sable racers from his sorrows,<br> Reins he made from days of evil,<br> From his sacred pains made saddles.<br> To the saddle, quickly springing,<br> Galloped he away from trouble,<br> To his dear and aged mother;<br> And his comrade, faithful Tiera,<br> Galloped to his Island-dwelling.</p> 
 <p>Now departs wild Lemminkainen,<br> Brave and reckless Kaukomieli,<br> From these ancient songs and legends;<br> Only guides his faithful Kura<br> To his waiting bride and kindred,<br> While these lays and incantations<br> Shall be turned to other heroes.</p>
