 <p>AHTI, living on the island, <br> Near the Kauko-point and harbor,<br> Plowed his fields for rye and barley,<br> Furrowed his extensive pastures,<br> Heard with quickened ears an uproar,<br> Heard the village in commotion,<br> Heard a noise along the sea-shore,<br> Heard the foot-steps on the ice-plain,<br> Heard the rattle of the sledges;<br> Quick his mind divined the reason,<br> Knew it was Pohyola's wedding,<br> Wedding of the Rainbow-virgin.<br> Quick he stopped in disappointment,<br> Shook his sable locks in envy,<br> Turned his hero-head in anger,<br> While the scarlet blood ceased flowing<br> Through his pallid face and temples;<br> Ceased his plowing and his sowing,<br> On the field he left the furrows,<br> On his steed he lightly mounted,<br> Straightway galloped fleetly homeward<br> To his well-beloved mother,<br> To his mother old and golden,<br> Gave his mother these directions,<br> These the words of Lemminkainen:<br> "My beloved, faithful mother,<br> Quickly bring me beer and viands,<br> Bring me food for I am hungry,<br> Food and drink for me abundant,<br> Have my bath-room quickly heated,<br> Quickly set the room in order,<br> That I may refresh my body,<br> Dress myself in hero-raiment."</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen's aged mother<br> Brings her hero food in plenty,<br> Beer and viands for the hungry,<br> For her thirsting son and hero;<br> Quick she heats the ancient bath-room,<br> Quickly sets his bath in order.</p> 
 <p>Then the reckless Lemminkainen<br> Ate his meat with beer inspiring,<br> Hastened to his bath awaiting;<br> Only was the bullfinch bathing,<br> With the many-colored bunting;<br> Quick the hero laved his temples,<br> Laved himself to flaxen whiteness,<br> Quick returning to his mother,<br> Spake in haste the words that follow:<br> "My beloved, helpful mother,<br> Go at once to yonder mountain,<br> To the store-house on the hill-top,<br> Bring my vest of finest texture,<br> Bring my hero-coat of purple,<br> Bring my suit of magic colors,<br> Thus to make me look attractive,<br> Thus to robe myself in beauty."</p> 
 <p>First the ancient mother asked him,<br> Asked her son this simple question:<br> "Whither dost thou go, my hero?<br> Dost thou go to hunt the roebuck,<br> Chase the lynx upon the mountains,<br> Shoot the squirrel in the woodlands?"</p> 
 <p>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<br> Also known as Kaukomieli:<br> "Worthy mother of my being,<br> Go I not to hunt the roebuck,<br> Chase the lynx upon the mountains,<br> Shoot the squirrel on the tree-tops;<br> I am going to Pohyola,<br> To the feasting of her people.<br> Bring at once my purple vestments,<br> Straightway bring my nuptial outfit,<br> Let me don it for the marriage<br> Of the maiden of the Northland."</p> 
 <p>But the ancient dame dissented,<br> And the wife forebade the husband;<br> Two of all the best of heroes,<br> Three of nature's fairest daughters,<br> Strongly urged wild Lemminkainen<br> Not to go to Sariola,<br> To Pohyola's great carousal,<br> To the marriage-feast of Northland,<br> "Since thou hast not been invited,<br> Since they do not wish thy presence."</p> 
 <p>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen.<br> These the words of Kaukomieli:<br> "Where the wicked are invited,<br> There the good are always welcome,<br> Herein lies my invitation;<br> I am constantly reminded<br> By this sword of sharpened edges,<br> By this magic blade and scabbard,<br> That Pohyola needs my presence."</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen's aged mother<br> Sought again to stay her hero:<br> "Do not go, my son beloved,<br> To the feasting in Pohyola;<br> Full of horrors are the highways,<br> On the road are many wonders,<br> Three times Death appears to frighten,<br> Thrice destruction hovers over!"</p> 
 <p>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<br> These the words of Kaukomieli:<br> "Death is seen by aged people,<br> Everywhere they see perdition,<br> Death can never frighten heroes,<br> Heroes do not fear the spectre;<br> Be that as it may, dear mother,<br> Tell that I may understand thee,<br> Name the first of all destructions,<br> Name the first and last destroyers!"<br> Lemminkainen's mother answered:<br> "I will tell thee, son and hero,<br> Not because I wish to speak it,<br> But because the truth is worthy;<br> I will name the chief destruction,<br> Name the first of the destroyers.<br> When thou hast a distance journeyed,<br> Only one day hast thou travelled,<br> Comes a stream along the highway,<br> Stream of fire of wondrous beauty,<br> In the stream a mighty fire-spout,<br> In the spout a rock uprising,<br> On the rock a fiery hillock,<br> On the top a flaming eagle,<br> And his crooked beak he sharpens,<br> Sharpens too his bloody talons,<br> For the coming of the stranger,<br> For the people that approach him."</p> 
 <p>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<br> "Women die beneath the eagle,<br> Such is not the death of heroes;<br> Know I well a magic lotion,<br> That will heal the wounds of eagles;<br> Make myself a steed of alders,<br> That will walk as my companion,<br> That will stride ahead majestic;<br> As a duck I'll drive behind him,<br> Drive him o'er the fatal waters,<br> Underneath the flaming eagle,<br> With his bloody beak and talons.<br> Worthy mother of my being,<br> Name the second of destroyers."<br> Lemminkainen's mother answered:<br> "This the second of destroyers:<br> When thou hast a distance wandered,<br> Only two clays hast thou travelled,<br> Comes a pit of fire to meet thee,<br> In the centre of the highway,<br> Eastward far the pit extending,<br> Stretches endless to the westward,<br> Filled with burning coals and pebbles,<br> Glowing with the heat of ages;<br> Hundreds has this monster swallowed,<br> In his jaws have thousands perished,<br> Hundreds with their trusty broadswords,<br> Thousands on their fiery chargers."</p> 
 <p>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<br> "Never will the hero perish<br> In the jaws of such a monster;<br> Know I well the means of safety,<br> Know a remedy efficient:<br> I will make of snow a master,<br> On the snow-clad fields, a hero,<br> Drive the snow-man on before me,<br> Drive him through the flaming vortex,<br> Drive him through the fiery furnace,<br> With my magic broom of copper;<br> I will follow in his shadow,<br> Follow close the magic image,<br> Thus escape the frightful monster,<br> With my golden locks uninjured,<br> With my flowing beard untangled.<br> Ancient mother of my being,<br> Name the last of the destructions,<br> Name the third of the destroyers."<br> Lemminkainen's mother answered:<br> "This the third of fatal dangers:<br> Hast thou gone a greater distance,<br> Hast thou travelled one day longer,<br> To the portals of Pohyola,<br> To the narrowest of gate-ways,<br> There a wolf will rise to meet thee,<br> There the black-bear sneak upon thee-,<br> In Pohyola's darksome portals,<br> Hundreds in their jaws have perished,<br> Have devoured a thousand heroes;<br> Wherefore will they not destroy thee,<br> Since thy form is unprotected?"</p> 
 <p>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<br> "Let them eat the gentle lambkins,<br> Feed upon their tender tissues,<br> They cannot devour this hero;<br> I am girded with my buckler,<br> Girded with my belt of copper,<br> Armlets wear I of the master,<br> From the wolf and bear protected,<br> Will not hasten to Untamo.<br> I can meet the wolf of Lempo,<br> For the bear I have a balsam,<br> For his mouth I conjure bridles,<br> For the wolf, forge chains of iron;<br> I will smite them as the willow,<br> Chop them into little fragments,<br> Thus I'll gain the open court-yard,<br> Thus triumphant end my journey."<br> Lemminkainen's mother answered:<br> "Then thy journey is not ended,<br> Greater dangers still await thee,<br> Great the wonders yet before thee,<br> Horrors three within thy pathway;<br> Three great dangers of the hero<br> Still await thy reckless footsteps,<br> These the worst of all thy dangers:<br> When thou hast still farther wandered,<br> Thou wilt reach the Court of Pohya,<br> Where the walls are forged from iron,<br> And from steel the outer bulwark;<br> Rises from the earth to heaven,<br> Back again to earth returning;<br> Double spears are used for railings,<br> On each spear are serpents winding,<br> On each rail are stinging adders;<br> Lizards too adorn the bulwarks,<br> Play their long tails in the sunlight,<br> Hissing lizards, venomed serpents,<br> Jump and writhe upon the rampart,<br> Turn their horrid heads to meet thee;<br> On the greensward lie the monsters,<br> On the ground the things of evil,<br> With their pliant tongues of venom,<br> Hissing, striking, crawling, writhing;<br> One more horrid than the others,<br> Lies before the fatal gate-way,<br> Longer than the longest rafters,<br> Larger than the largest portals;<br> Hisses with the tongue of anger,<br> Lifts his head in awful menace,<br> Raises it to strike none other<br> Than the hero of the islands."</p> 
 <p>Spake the warlike Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<br> "By such things the children perish,<br> Such is not the death of heroes;<br> Know I well the fire to manage,<br> I can quench the flames of passion,<br> I can meet the prowling wild-beasts,<br> Can appease the wrath of serpents,<br> I can heal the sting of adders,<br> I have plowed the serpent-pastures,<br> Plowed the adder-fields of Northland;<br> While my hands were unprotected,<br> Held the serpents in my fingers,<br> Drove the adders to Manala,<br> On my hands the blood of serpents,<br> On my feet the fat of adders.<br> Never will thy hero stumble<br> On the serpents of the Northland;<br> With my heel I'll crush the monsters,<br> Stamp the horrid things to atoms;<br> I will banish them from Pohya,<br> Drive them to Manala's kingdom,<br> Step within Pohyola's mansion,<br> Walk the halls of Sariola!"<br> Lemminkainen's mother answered:<br> "Do not go, my son beloved,<br> To the firesides of Pohyola,<br> Through the Northland fields and fallows;<br> There are warriors with broadswords,<br> Heroes clad in mail of copper,<br> Are on beer intoxicated,<br> By the beer are much embittered;<br> They will charm thee, hapless creature,<br> On the tips of swords of magic;<br> Greater heroes have been conjured,<br> Stronger ones have been outwitted."<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "Formerly thy son resided<br> In the hamlets of Pohyola;<br> Laplanders cannot enchant me,<br> Nor the Turyalanders harm me<br> I the, Laplander will conjure,<br> Charm him with my magic powers,<br> Sing his shoulders wide asunder,<br> In his chin I'll sing a fissure,<br> Sing his collar-bone to pieces,<br> Sing his breast to thousand fragments."<br> Lemminkainen's mother answered:<br> "Foolish son, ungrateful wizard,<br> Boasting of thy former visit,<br> Boasting of thy fatal journey!<br> Once in Northland thou wert living,<br> In the homesteads of Pohyola;<br> There thou tried to swim the whirlpool,<br> Tasted there the dog-tongue waters,<br> Floated down the fatal current,<br> Sank beneath its angry billows;<br> Thou hast seen Tuoni's river,<br> Thou hast measured Mana's waters,<br> There to-day thou wouldst be sleeping,<br> Had it not been for thy mother!<br> What I tell thee well remember,<br> Shouldst thou gain Pohyola's chambers,<br> Filled with stakes thou'lt find the court-yard,<br> These to hold the heads of heroes;<br> There thy head will rest forever,<br> Shouldst thou go to Sariola."<br> Spake the warlike Lemminkainen:<br> "Fools indeed may heed thy counsel,<br> Cowards too may give attention;<br> Those of seven conquest-summers<br> Cannot heed such weak advising.<br> Bring to me my battle-armor.<br> Bring my magic mail of copper,<br> Bring me too my father's broadsword,<br> Keep the old man's blade from rusting;<br> Long it has been cold and idle,<br> Long has lain in secret places,<br> Long and constantly been weeping,<br> Long been asking for a bearer."</p> 
 <p>Then he took his mail of copper,<br> Took his ancient battle-armor,<br> Took his father's sword of magic,<br> Tried its point against the oak-wood,<br> Tried its edge upon the sorb-tree;<br> In his hand the blade was bended,<br> Like the limber boughs of willow,<br> Like the juniper in summer.<br> Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<br> "There is none in Pohya's hamlets,<br> In the courts of Sariola,<br> That with me can measure broadswords,<br> That can meet this blade ancestral."</p> 
 <p>From the nail he took a cross-bow,<br> Took the strongest from the rafters,<br> Spake these words in meditation:<br> "I shall recognize as worthy,<br> Recognize that one a hero<br> That can bend this mighty cross-bow,<br> That can break its magic sinews,<br> In the hamlets of Pohyola."</p> 
 <p>Lemminkainen, filled with courage,<br> Girds himself in suit of battle,<br> Dons his mighty mail of copper,<br> To his servant speaks as follows:<br> "Trusty slave, and whom I purchased,<br> Whom I bought with gold and silver,<br> Quick prepare my fiery charger,<br> Harness well my steed of battle;<br> I am going to the feasting,<br> To the banquet-fields of Lempo."</p> 
 <p>Quick obeys the faithful servant,<br> Hitches well the noble war-horse,<br> Quick prepares the fire-red stallion,<br> Speaks these words when all is I ready:<br> "I have done what thou hast hidden,<br> Ready harnessed is the charger,<br> Waiting to obey his master."<br> Comes the hour of the departing<br> Of the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Right hand ready, left unwilling,<br> All his anxious fingers pain him,<br> Till at last in full obedience,<br> All his members give permission;<br> Starts the hero on his journey,<br> While the mother gives him counsel,<br> At the threshold of the dwelling,<br> At the highway of the court-yard:<br> "Child of courage, my beloved,<br> Son of strength, my wisdom-hero,<br> If thou goest to the feasting,<br> Shouldst thou reach the great carousal,<br> Drink thou only a half a cupful,<br> Drink the goblet to the middle,<br> Always give the half remaining,<br> Give the worse half to another,<br> To another more unworthy;<br> In the lower half are serpents,<br> Worms, and frogs, and hissing lizards,<br> Feeding on the slimy bottom."</p> 
 <p>Furthermore she tells her hero,<br> Gives her son these sage directions,<br> On the border of the court-yard,<br> At the portals farthest distant:<br> "If thou goest to the banquet,<br> Shouldst thou reach the great carousal,<br> Occupy but half the settle,<br> Take but half a stride in walking,<br> Give the second half to others,<br> To another less deserving;<br> Only thus thou'lt be a hero,<br> Thus become a son immortal;<br> In the guest-rooms look courageous,<br> Bravely move about the chambers,<br> In the gatherings of heroes,<br> With the hosts of magic valor."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<br> Quickly leaped upon the cross-bench<br> Of his battle-sledge of wonder,<br> Raised his pearl-enamelled birch-rod,<br> Snapped his whip above his charger,<br> And the steed flew onward fleetly,<br> Galloped on his distant journey.</p> 
 <p>He had travelled little distance,<br> When a flight of hazel-chickens<br> Quick arose before his coming,<br> Flew before the foaming racer.<br> There were left some feathers lying,<br> Feathers of the hazel-chickens,<br> Lying in the hero's pathway.<br> These the reckless Lemminkainen<br> Gathered for their magic virtues,<br> Put them in his pouch of leather,<br> Did not know what things might happen<br> On his journey to Pohyola;<br> All things have some little value,<br> In a strait all things are useful.</p> 
 <p>Then he drove a little distance,<br> Galloped farther on the highway,<br> When his courser neighed in danger,<br> And the fleet-foot ceased his running.<br> Then the stout-heart, Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Rose upon his seat in wonder,<br> Craned his neck and looked about him<br> Found it as his mother told him,<br> Found a stream of fire opposing;<br> Ran the fire-stream like a river,<br> Ran across the hero's pathway.<br> In the river was a fire-fall,<br> In the cataract a fire-rock,<br> On the rock a fiery hillock,<br> On its summit perched an eagle,<br> From his throat the fire was streaming<br> To the crater far below him,<br> Fire out-shooting from his feathers,<br> Glowing with a fiery splendor;<br> Long he looked upon the hero,<br> Long he gazed on Lemminkainen,<br> Then the eagle thus addressed him:<br> "Whither art thou driving, Ahti,<br> Whither going, Lemminkainen?"<br> Kaukomieli spake in answer:<br> "To the feastings of Pohyola,<br> To the drinking-halls of Louhi,<br> To the banquet of her people;<br> Move aside and let me journey,<br> Move a little from my pathway,<br> Let this wanderer pass by thee,<br> I am warlike Lemminkainen."</p> 
 <p>This the answer of the eagle,<br> Screaming from his throat of splendor:<br> "Though thou art wild Lemminkainen,<br> I shall let thee wander onward,<br> Through my fire-throat let thee journey,<br> Through these flames shall be thy passage<br> To the banquet-halls of Louhi,<br> To Pohyola's great carousal!"</p> 
 <p>Little heeding, Kaukomieli<br> Thinks himself in little trouble,<br> Thrusts his fingers in his pockets,<br> Searches in his pouch of leather,<br> Quickly takes the magic feathers,<br> Feathers from the hazel-chickens,<br> Rubs them into finest powder,<br> Rubs them with his magic fingers<br> Whence a flight of birds arises,<br> Hazel-chickens from the feathers,<br> Large the bevy of the young birds.<br> Quick the wizard, Lemminkainen,<br> Drives them to the eagle's fire-mouth,<br> Thus to satisfy his hunger,<br> Thus to quench the fire out-streaming.<br> Thus escapes the reckless hero,<br> Thus escapes the first of dangers,<br> Passes thus the first destroyer,<br> On his journey to Pohyola.</p> 
 <p>With his whip he strikes his courser,<br> With his birch-whip, pearl-enamelled;<br> Straightway speeds the fiery charger,<br> Noiselessly upon his journey,<br> Gallops fast and gallops faster,<br> Till the flying steed in terror<br> Neighs again and ceases running.<br> Lemminkainen, quickly rising,<br> Cranes his neck and looks about him,<br> Sees his mother's words were truthful,<br> Sees her augury well-taken.<br> Lo! before him yawned a fire-gulf,<br> Stretching crosswise through his pathway;<br> Far to east the gulf extending,<br> To the west an endless distance,<br> Filled with stones and burning pebbles,<br> Running streams of burning matter.</p> 
 <p>Little heeding, Lemminkainen<br> Cries aloud in prayer to Ukko:<br> "Ukko, thou O God above me,<br> Dear Creator, omnipresent,<br> From the north-west send a storm-cloud,<br> From the east, dispatch a second,<br> From the south send forth a third one;<br> Let them gather from the south-west,<br> Sew their edges well together,<br> Fill thou well the interspaces,<br> Send a snow-fall high as heaven,<br> Let it fall from upper ether,<br> Fall upon the flaming fire-pit,<br> On the cataract and whirlpool!"</p> 
 <p>Mighty Ukko, the Creator,<br> Ukko, father omnipresent,<br> Dwelling in the courts of heaven,<br> Sent a storm-cloud from the north-west,<br> From the east he sent a second,<br> From the south despatched a third one,<br> Let them gather from the south-west,<br> Sewed their edges well together,<br> Filled their many interspaces,<br> Sent a snow-fall high as heaven,<br> From the giddy heights of ether,<br> Sent it seething to the fire-pit,<br> On the streams of burning matter;<br> From the snow-fall in the fire-pond,<br> Grows a lake with rolling billows.<br> Quick the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Conjures there of ice a passage<br> From one border to the other,<br> Thus escapes his second danger,<br> Thus his second trouble passes.</p> 
 <p>Then the reckless Lemminkainen<br> Raised his pearl-enamelled birch-rod,<br> Snapped his whip above his racer,<br> And the steed flew onward swiftly,<br> Galloped on his distant journey<br> O'er the highway to Pohyola;<br> Galloped fast and galloped faster,<br> Galloped on a greater distance,<br> When the stallion loudly neighing,<br> Stopped and trembled on the highway,<br> Then the lively Lemminkainen<br> Raised himself upon the cross-bench,<br> Looked to see what else had happened;<br> Lo I a wolf stands at the portals,<br> in the passage-way a black-bear,<br> At the high-gate of Pohyola,<br> At the ending of the journey.</p> 
 <p>Thereupon young Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Thrusts his fingers in his pockets,<br> Seeks his magic pouch of leather,<br> Pulls therefrom a lock of ewe-wool,<br> Rubs it firmly in his fingers,<br> In his hands it falls to powder;<br> Breathes the breath of life upon it,<br> When a flock of sheep arises,<br> Goats and sheep of sable color;<br> On the flock the black-wolf pounces,<br> And the wild-bear aids the slaughter,<br> While the reckless Lemminkainen<br> Rushes by them on his journey;<br> Gallops on a little distance,<br> To the court of Sariola,<br> Finds the fence of molten iron,<br> And of steel the rods and pickets,<br> In the earth a hundred fathoms,<br> To the azure sky, a thousand,<br> Double-pointed spears projecting;<br> On each spear were serpents twisted,<br> Adders coiled in countless numbers,<br> Lizards mingled with the serpents,<br> Tails entangled pointing earthward,<br> While their heads were skyward whirling,<br> Writhing, hissing mass of evil.</p> 
 <p>Then the stout-heart, Kaukomieli,<br> Deeply thought and long considered:<br> "It is as my mother told me,<br> This the wall that she predicted,<br> Stretching from the earth to heaven;<br> Downward deep are serpents creeping,<br> Deeper still the rails extending;<br> High as highest flight of eagles,<br> Higher still the wall shoots upward."</p> 
 <p>But the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Little cares, nor feels disheartened,<br> Draws his broadsword from its scabbard,<br> Draws his mighty blade ancestral,<br> Hews the wall with might of magic,<br> Breaks the palisade in pieces,<br> Hews to atoms seven pickets,<br> Chops the serpent-wall to fragments;<br> Through the breach he quickly passes<br> To the portals of Pohyola.</p> 
 <p>In the way, a serpent lying,<br> Lying crosswise in the entry,<br> Longer than the longest rafters,<br> Larger than the posts of oak-wood;<br> Hundred-eyed, the heinous serpent,<br> And a thousand tongues, the monster,<br> Eyes as large as sifting vessels,<br> Tongues as long as shafts of javelins,<br> Teeth as large as hatchet-handles,<br> Back as broad as skiffs of ocean.<br> Lemminkainen does not venture<br> Straightway through this host opposing,<br> Through the hundred heads of adders,<br> Through the thousand tongues of serpents.<br> Spake the magic Lemminkainen:<br> "Venomed viper, thing of evil,<br> Ancient adder of Tuoni,<br> Thou that crawlest in the stubble,<br> Through the flower-roots of Lempo,<br> Who has sent thee from thy kingdom,<br> Sent thee from thine evil coverts,<br> Sent thee hither, crawling, writhing,<br> In the pathway I would travel?<br> Who bestowed thy mouth of venom,<br> Who insisted, who commanded,<br> Thou shouldst raise thy head toward heaven,<br> Who thy tail has given action?<br> Was this given by the father,<br> Did the mother give this power,<br> Or the eldest of the brothers,<br> Or the youngest of the sisters,<br> Or some other of thy kindred?</p> 
 <p>"Close thy mouth, thou thing of evil,<br> Hide thy pliant tongue of venom,<br> In a circle wrap thy body,<br> Coil thou like a shield in silence,<br> Give to me one-half the pathway,<br> Let this wanderer pass by thee,<br> Or remove thyself entirely;<br> Get thee hence to yonder heather,<br> Quick retreat to bog and stubble,<br> Hide thyself in reeds and rushes,<br> In the brambles of the lowlands.<br> Like a ball of flax enfolding,<br> Like a sphere of aspen-branches,<br> With thy head and tail together,<br> Roll thyself to yonder mountain;<br> In the heather is thy dwelling,<br> Underneath the sod thy caverns.<br> Shouldst thou raise thy head in anger,<br> Mighty Ukko will destroy it,<br> Pierce it with his steel-tipped arrows,<br> With his death-balls made of iron!"</p> 
 <p>Hardly had the hero ended,<br> When the monster, little heeding,<br> Hissing with his tongue in anger,<br> Plying like the forked lightning,<br> Pounces with his mouth of venom<br> At the head of Lemminkainen;<br> But the hero, quick recalling,<br> Speaks the master-words of knowledge,<br> Words that came from distant ages,<br> Words his ancestors had taught him,<br> Words his mother learned in childhood,<br> These the words of Lemminkainen:<br> "Since thou wilt not heed mine order,<br> Since thou wilt not leave the highway,<br> Puffed with pride of thine own greatness,<br> Thou shall burst in triple pieces.<br> Leave thy station for the borders,<br> I will hunt thine ancient mother,<br> Sing thine origin of evil,<br> How arose thy head of horror;<br> Suoyatar, thine ancient mother,<br> Thing of evil, thy creator!"</p> 
 <p>"Suoyatar once let her spittle<br> Fall upon the waves of ocean;<br> This was rocked by winds and waters,<br> Shaken by the ocean-currents,<br> Six years rocked upon the billows,<br> Rocked in water seven summers,<br> On the blue-back of the ocean,<br> On the billows high as heaven;<br> Lengthwise did the billows draw it,<br> And the sunshine gave it softness,<br> To the shore the billows washed it,<br> On the coast the waters left it.</p> 
 <p>"Then appeared Creation's daughters,<br> Three the daughters thus appearing,<br> On the roaring shore of ocean,<br> There beheld the spittle lying,<br> And the daughters spake as follows:<br> 'What would happen from this spittle,<br> Should the breath of the Creator<br> Fall upon the writhing matter,<br> Breathe the breath of life upon it,<br> Give the thing the sense of vision?</p> 
 <p>"The Creator heard these measures,<br> Spake himself the words that follow:<br> 'Evil only comes from evil,<br> This is the expectoration<br> Of fell Suoyatar, its mother;<br> Therefore would the thing be evil,<br> Should I breathe a soul within it,<br> Should I give it sense of vision.'</p> 
 <p>"Hisi heard this conversation,<br> Ever ready with his mischief,<br> Made himself to be creator,<br> Breathed a soul into the spittle,<br> To fell Suoyatar's fierce anger.<br> Thus arose the poison-monster,<br> Thus was born the evil serpent,<br> This the origin of evil.</p> 
 <p>"Whence the life that gave her action'?<br> From the carbon-pile of Hisi.<br> Whence then was her heart created?<br> From the heart-throbs of her mother<br> Whence arose her brain of evil?<br> From the foam of rolling waters.<br> Whence was consciousness awakened?<br> From the waterfall's commotion.<br> Whence arose her head of venom?<br> From the seed-germs of the ivy.<br> Whence then came her eyes of fury?<br> From the flaxen seeds of Lempo.<br> Whence the evil ears for hearing?<br> From the foliage of Hisi.<br> Whence then was her mouth created?<br> This from Suoyatar's foam-currents<br> Whence arose thy tongue of anger r<br> From the spear of Keitolainen.<br> Whence arose thy fangs of poison?<br> From the teeth of Mana's daughter.<br> Whence then was thy back created?<br> From the carbon-posts of Piru.<br> How then was thy tail created?<br> From the brain of the hobgoblin.<br> Whence arose thy writhing entrails?<br> From the death-belt of Tuoni.</p> 
 <p>"This thine origin, O Serpent,<br> This thy charm of evil import,<br> Vilest thing of God's creation,<br> Writhing, hissing thing of evil,<br> With the color of Tuoni,<br> With the shade of earth and heaven,<br> With the darkness of the storm-cloud.<br> Get thee hence, thou loathsome monster,<br> Clear the pathway of this hero.<br> I am mighty Lemminkainen,<br> On my journey to Pohyola,<br> To the feastings and carousals,<br> In the halls of darksome Northland."</p> 
 <p>Thereupon the snake uncoiling,<br> Hundred-eyed and heinous monster,<br> Crawled away to other portals,<br> That the hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Might proceed upon his errand,<br> To the dismal Sariola,<br> To the feastings and carousals<br> In the banquet-halls of Pohya.</p>
