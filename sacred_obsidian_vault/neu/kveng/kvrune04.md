 <p>WHEN the night had passed, the maiden,<br> Sister fair of Youkahainen,<br> Hastened early to the forest,<br> Birchen shoots for brooms to gather,<br> Went to gather birchen tassels;<br> Bound a bundle for her father,<br> Bound a birch-broom for her mother,<br> Silken tassels for her sister.<br> Straightway then she hastened homeward,<br> By a foot-path left the forest;<br> As she neared the woodland border,<br> Lo! the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Quickly spying out the maiden,<br> As she left the birchen woodland,<br> Trimly dressed in costly raiment,<br> And the minstrel thus addressed her:<br> "Aino, beauty of the Northland,<br> Wear not, lovely maid, for others,<br> Only wear for me, sweet maiden,<br> Golden cross upon thy bosom,<br> Shining pearls upon thy shoulders;<br> Bind for me thine auburn tresses,<br> Wear for me thy golden braidlets."<br> Thus the maiden quickly answered:<br> "Not for thee and not for others,<br> Hang I from my neck the crosslet,<br> Deck my hair with silken ribbons;<br> Need no more the many trinkets<br> Brought to me by ship or shallop;<br> Sooner wear the simplest raiment,<br> Feed upon the barley bread-crust,<br> Dwell forever with my mother<br> In the cabin with my father."</p> 
 <p>Then she threw the gold cross from her,<br> Tore the jewels from her fingers,<br> Quickly loosed her shining necklace,<br> Quick untied her silken ribbons,<br> Cast them all away indignant<br> Into forest ferns and flowers.<br> Thereupon the maiden, Aino,<br> Hastened to her mother's cottage.</p> 
 <p>At the window sat her father<br> Whittling on an oaken ax-helve:<br> "Wherefore weepest, beauteous Aino,<br> Aino, my beloved daughter?</p> 
 <p>"Cause enough for weeping, father,<br> Good the reasons for my mourning,<br> This, the reason for my weeping,<br> This, the cause of all my sorrow:<br> From my breast I tore the crosslet,<br> From my belt, the clasp of copper,<br> From my waist, the belt of silver,<br> Golden was my pretty crosslet."</p> 
 <p>Near the door-way sat her brother,<br> Carving out a birchen ox-bow:<br> "Why art weeping, lovely Aino,<br> Aino, my devoted sister?"</p> 
 <p>"Cause enough for weeping, brother,<br> Good the reasons for my mourning<br> Therefore come I as thou seest,<br> Rings no longer on my fingers,<br> On my neck no pretty necklace;<br> Golden were the rings thou gavest,<br> And the necklace, pearls and silver!"</p> 
 <p>On the threshold sat her sister,<br> Weaving her a golden girdle:<br> "Why art weeping, beauteous Aino,<br> Aino, my beloved sister?"</p> 
 <p>"Cause enough for weeping, sister,<br> Good the reasons for my sorrow:<br> Therefore come I as thou seest,<br> On my head no scarlet fillet,<br> In my hair no braids of silver,<br> On mine arms no purple ribbons,<br> Round my neck no shining necklace,<br> On my breast no golden crosslet,<br> In mine ears no golden ear-rings."</p> 
 <p>Near the door-way of the dairy,<br> Skimming cream, sat Aino's mother.<br> "Why art weeping, lovely Aino,<br> Aino, my devoted daughter?"<br> Thus the sobbing maiden answered;<br> "Loving mother, all-forgiving,<br> Cause enough for this my weeping,<br> Good the reasons for my sorrow,<br> Therefore do I weep, dear mother:<br> I have been within the forest,<br> Brooms to bind and shoots to gather,<br> There to pluck some birchen tassels;<br> Bound a bundle for my father,<br> Bound a second for my mother,<br> Bound a third one for my brother,<br> For my sister silken tassels.<br> Straightway then I hastened homeward,<br> By a foot-path left the forest;<br> As I reached the woodland border<br> Spake Osmoinen from the cornfield,<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> 'Wear not, beauteous maid, for others,<br> Only wear for me, sweet maiden,<br> On thy breast a golden crosslet,<br> Shining pearls upon thy shoulders,<br> Bind for me thine auburn tresses,<br> Weave for me thy silver braidlets.'<br> Then I threw the gold-cross from me,<br> Tore the jewels from my fingers,<br> Quickly loosed my shining necklace,<br> Quick untied my silken ribbons,<br> Cast them all away indignant,<br> Into forest ferns and flowers.<br> Then I thus addressed the singer:<br> 'Not for thee and not for others,<br> Hang I from my neck the crosslet,<br> Deck my hair with silken ribbons;<br> Need no more the many trinkets,<br> Brought to me by ship and shallop;<br> Sooner wear the simplest raiment,<br> Feed upon the barley bread-crust,<br> Dwell forever with my mother<br> In the cabin with my father.'"</p> 
 <p>Thus the gray-haired mother answered<br> Aino, her beloved daughter:<br> "Weep no more, my lovely maiden,<br> Waste no more of thy sweet young-life;<br> One year eat thou my sweet butter,<br> It will make thee strong and ruddy;<br> Eat another year fresh bacon,<br> It will make thee tall and queenly;<br> Eat a third year only dainties,<br> It will make thee fair and lovely.<br> Now make haste to yonder hill-top,<br> To the store-house on the mountain,<br> Open there the large compartment,<br> Thou will find it filled with boxes,<br> Chests and cases, trunks and boxes;<br> Open thou the box, the largest,<br> Lift away the gaudy cover,<br> Thou will find six golden girdles,<br> Seven rainbow-tinted dresses,<br> Woven by the Moon's fair daughters,<br> Fashioned by the Sun's sweet virgins.<br> In my young years once I wandered,<br> As a maiden on the mountains,<br> In the happy days of childhood,<br> Hunting berries in the coppice;<br> There by chance I heard the daughters<br> Of the Moon as they were weaving;<br> There I also heard the daughters<br> Of the Sun as they were spinning<br> On the red rims of the cloudlets,<br> O'er the blue edge of the forest,<br> On the border of the pine-wood,<br> On a high and distant mountain.<br> I approached them, drawing nearer,<br> Stole myself within their hearing,<br> Then began I to entreat them,<br> Thus besought them, gently pleading:<br> 'Give thy silver, Moon's fair daughters,<br> To a poor, but worthy maiden;<br> Give thy gold, O Sun's sweet virgins,<br> To this maiden, young and needy.'<br> Thereupon the Moon's fair daughters<br> Gave me silver from their coffers;<br> And the Sun's sweet shining virgins<br> Gave me gold from their abundance,<br> Gold to deck my throbbing temples,<br> For my hair the shining silver.<br> Then I hastened joyful homeward,<br> Richly laden with my treasures,<br> Happy to my mother's cottage;<br> Wore them one day, than a second,<br> Then a third day also wore them,<br> Took the gold then from my temples,<br> From my hair I took the silver,<br> Careful laid them in their boxes,<br> Many seasons have they lain there,<br> Have not seen them since my childhood.<br> Deck thy brow with silken ribbon,<br> Trim with gold thy throbbing temples,<br> And thy neck with pearly necklace,<br> Hang the gold-cross on thy bosom,<br> Robe thyself in pure, white linen<br> Spun from flax of finest fiber;<br> Wear withal the richest short-frock,<br> Fasten it with golden girdle;<br> On thy feet, put silken stockings,<br> With the shoes of finest leather;<br> Deck thy hair with golden braidlets,<br> Bind it well with threads of silver;<br> Trim with rings thy fairy fingers,<br> And thy hands with dainty ruffles;<br> Come bedecked then to thy chamber,<br> Thus return to this thy household,<br> To the greeting of thy kindred,<br> To the joy of all that know thee,<br> Flushed thy cheeks as ruddy berries,<br> Coming as thy father's sunbeam,<br> Walking beautiful and queenly,<br> Far more beautiful than moonlight."</p> 
 <p>Thus she spake to weeping Aino,<br> Thus the mother to her daughter;<br> But the maiden, little bearing,<br> Does not heed her mother's wishes;<br> Straightway hastens to the court-yard,<br> There to weep in bitter sorrow,<br> All alone to weep in anguish.</p> 
 <p>Waiting long the wailing Aino<br> Thus at last soliloquizes:<br> "Unto what can I now liken<br> Happy homes and joys of fortune?<br> Like the waters in the river,<br> Like the waves in yonder lakelet,<br> Like the crystal waters flowing.<br> Unto what, the biting sorrow<br> Of the child of cold misfortune?<br> Like the spirit of the sea-duck,<br> Like the icicle in winter,<br> Water in the well imprisoned.<br> Often roamed my mind in childhood,<br> When a maiden free and merry,<br> Happily through fen and fallow,<br> Gamboled on the meads with lambkins,<br> Lingered with the ferns and flowers,<br> Knowing neither pain nor trouble;<br> Now my mind is filled with sorrow,<br> Wanders though the bog and stubble,<br> Wanders weary through the brambles,<br> Roams throughout the dismal forest,<br> Till my life is filled with darkness,<br> And my spirit white with anguish.<br> Better had it been for Aino<br> Had she never seen the sunlight,<br> Or if born had died an infant,<br> Had not lived to be a maiden<br> In these days of sin and sorrow,<br> Underneath a star so luckless.<br> Better had it been for Aino,<br> Had she died upon the eighth day<br> After seven nights had vanished;<br> Needed then but little linen,<br> Needed but a little coffin,<br> And a grave of smallest measure;<br> Mother would have mourned a little,<br> Father too perhaps a trifle,<br> Sister would have wept the day through,<br> Brother might have shed a tear-drop,<br> Thus had ended all the mourning."</p> 
 <p>Thus poor Aino wept and murmured,<br> Wept one day, and then a second,<br> Wept a third from morn till even,<br> When again her mother asked her:<br> "Why this weeping, fairest daughter,<br> Darling daughter, why this grieving?<br> Thus the tearful maiden answered:<br> Therefore do I weep and sorrow,<br> Wretched maiden all my life long,<br> Since poor Aino, thou hast given,<br> Since thy daughter thou hast promised<br> To the aged Wainamoinen,<br> Comfort to his years declining<br> Prop to stay him when he totters,<br> In the storm a roof above him,<br> In his home a cloak around him;<br> Better far if thou hadst sent me<br> Far below the salt-sea surges,<br> To become the whiting's sister,<br> And the friend of perch and salmon;<br> Better far to ride the billows,<br> Swim the sea-foam as a mermaid,<br> And the friend of nimble fishes,<br> Than to be an old man's solace,<br> Prop to stay him when be totters,<br> Hand to aid him when he trembles,<br> Arm to guide him when he falters,<br> Strength to give him when he weakens;<br> Better be the whiting's sister<br> And the friend of perch and salmon,<br> Than an old man's slave and darling."</p> 
 <p>Ending thus she left her mother,<br> Straightway hastened to the mountain?<br> To the store-house on the summit,<br> Opened there the box the largest,<br> From the box six lids she lifted,<br> Found therein six golden girdles,<br> Silken dresses seven in number.<br> Choosing such as pleased her fancy,<br> She adorned herself as bidden,<br> Robed herself to look her fairest,<br> Gold upon her throbbing temples,<br> In her hair the shining silver,<br> On her shoulders purple ribbons,<br> Band of blue around her forehead,<br> Golden cross, and rings, and jewels,<br> Fitting ornaments to beauty.</p> 
 <p>Now she leaves her many treasures,<br> Leaves the store-house on the mountain,<br> Filled with gold and silver trinkets,<br> Wanders over field and meadow,<br> Over stone-fields waste and barren,<br> Wanders on through fen and forest,<br> Through the forest vast and cheerless,<br> Wanders hither, wanders thither,<br> Singing careless as she wanders,<br> This her mournful song and echo:<br> "Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<br> Woe to Aino, broken-hearted!<br> Torture racks my heart and temples,<br> Yet the sting would not be deeper,<br> Nor the pain and anguish greater,<br> If beneath this weight of sorrow,<br> In my saddened heart's dejection,<br> I should yield my life forever,<br> Now unhappy, I should perish!<br> Lo! the time has come for Aino<br> From this cruel world to hasten,<br> To the kingdom of Tuoni,<br> To the realm of the departed,<br> To the isle of the hereafter.<br> Weep no more for me, O Father,<br> Mother dear, withhold thy censure,<br> Lovely sister, dry thine eyelids,<br> Do not mourn me, dearest brother,<br> When I sink beneath the sea-foam,<br> Make my home in salmon-grottoes,<br> Make my bed in crystal waters,<br> Water-ferns my couch and pillow."</p> 
 <p>All day long poor Aino wandered,<br> All the next day, sad and weary,<br> So the third from morn till evening,<br> Till the cruel night enwrapped her,<br> As she reached the sandy margin,<br> Reached the cold and dismal sea-shore,<br> Sat upon the rock of sorrow,<br> Sat alone in cold and darkness,<br> Listened only to the music<br> Of the winds and rolling billows,<br> Singing all the dirge of Aino.<br> All that night the weary maiden<br> Wept and wandered on the border<br> Through the sand and sea-washed pebbles.</p> 
 <p>As the day dawns, looking round her,<br> She beholds three water-maidens,<br> On a headland jutting seaward,<br> Water-maidens four in number,<br> Sitting on the wave-lashed ledges,<br> Swimming now upon the billows,<br> Now upon the rocks reposing.<br> Quick the weeping maiden, Aino,<br> Hastens there to join the mermaids,<br> Fairy maidens of the waters.<br> Weeping Aino, now disrobing,<br> Lays aside with care her garments,<br> Hangs her silk robes on the alders,<br> Drops her gold-cross on the sea-shore,<br> On the aspen hangs her ribbons,<br> On the rocks her silken stockings,<br> On the grass her shoes of deer-skin,<br> In the sand her shining necklace,<br> With her rings and other jewels.</p> 
 <p>Out at sea a goodly distance,<br> Stood a rock of rainbow colors,<br> Glittering in silver sunlight.<br> Toward it springs the hapless maiden,<br> Thither swims the lovely Aino,<br> Up the standing-stone has clambered,<br> Wishing there to rest a moment,<br> Rest upon the rock of beauty;<br> When upon a sudden swaying<br> To and fro among the billows,<br> With a crash and roar of waters<br> Falls the stone of many colors,<br> Falls upon the very bottom<br> Of the deep and boundless blue-sea.<br> With the stone of rainbow colors,<br> Falls the weeping maiden, Aino,<br> Clinging to its craggy edges,<br> Sinking far below the surface,<br> To the bottom of the blue-sea.<br> Thus the weeping maiden vanished.<br> Thus poor Aino sank and perished,<br> Singing as the stone descended,<br> Chanting thus as she departed:<br> Once to swim I sought the sea-side,<br> There to sport among the billows;<br> With the stone or many colors<br> Sank poor Aino to the bottom<br> Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,<br> Like a pretty son-bird. perished.<br> Never come a-fishing, father,<br> To the borders of these waters,<br> Never during all thy life-time,<br> As thou lovest daughter Aino.</p> 
 <p>"Mother dear, I sought the sea-side,<br> There to sport among the billows;<br> With the stone of many colors,<br> Sank poor Aino to the bottom<br> Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,<br> Like a pretty song-bird perished.<br> Never mix thy bread, dear mother,<br> With the blue-sea's foam and waters,<br> Never during all thy life-time,<br> As thou lovest daughter Aino.<br> Brother dear, I sought the sea-side,<br> There to sport among the billows;<br> With the stone of many colors<br> Sank poor Aino to the bottom<br> Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,<br> Like a pretty song-bird perished.<br> Never bring thy prancing war-horse,<br> Never bring thy royal racer,<br> Never bring thy steeds to water,<br> To the borders of the blue-sea,<br> Never during all thy life-time,<br> As thou lovest sister Aino.</p> 
 <p>"Sister dear, I sought the sea-side,<br> There to sport among the billows;<br> With the stone of many colors<br> Sank poor Aino to the bottom<br> Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,<br> Like a pretty song-bird perished.<br> Never come to lave thine eyelids<br> In this rolling wave and sea-foam,<br> Never during all thy life-time,<br> As thou lovest sister Aino.<br> All the waters in the blue-sea<br> Shall be blood of Aino's body;<br> All the fish that swim these waters<br> Shall be Aino's flesh forever;<br> All the willows on the sea-side<br> Shall be Aino's ribs hereafter;<br> All the sea-grass on the margin<br> Will have grown from Aino's tresses."</p> 
 <p>Thus at last the maiden vanished,<br> Thus the lovely Aino perished.<br> Who will tell the cruel story,<br> Who will bear the evil tidings<br> To the cottage of her mother,<br> Once the home of lovely Aino?<br> Will the bear repeat the story,<br> Tell the tidings to her mother?<br> Nay, the bear must not be herald,<br> He would slay the herds of cattle.<br> Who then tell the cruel story,<br> Who will bear the evil tidings<br> To the cottage of her father,<br> Once the home of lovely Aino?<br> Shall the wolf repeat the story,<br> Tell the sad news to her father?<br> Nay, the wolf must not be herald,<br> He would eat the gentle lambkins.</p> 
 <p>Who then tell the cruel story,<br> Who will bear the evil tidings.<br> To the cottage of her sister?<br> 'Will the fox repeat the story<br> Tell the tidings to her sister?<br> Nay, the fox must not be herald,<br> He would eat the ducks and chickens.</p> 
 <p>Who then tell the cruel story,<br> Who will bear the evil tidings<br> To the cottage of her brother,<br> Once the home of lovely Aino?<br> Shall the hare repeat the story,<br> Bear the sad news to her brother?<br> Yea, the hare shall be the herald,<br> Tell to all the cruel story.<br> Thus the harmless hare makes answer:<br> "I will bear the evil tidings<br> To the former home of Aino,<br> Tell the story to her kindred."</p> 
 <p>Swiftly flew the long-eared herald,<br> Like the winds be hastened onward,<br> Galloped swift as flight of eagles;<br> Neck awry he bounded forward<br> Till he gained the wished-for cottage,<br> Once the home of lovely Aino.<br> Silent was the home, and vacant;<br> So he hastened to the bath-house,<br> Found therein a group of maidens,<br> Working each upon a birch-broom.<br> Sat the hare upon the threshold,<br> And the maidens thus addressed him:<br> "Hie e there, Long-legs, or we'll roast thee,<br> Hie there, Big-eye, or we'll stew thee,<br> Roast thee for our lady's breakfast,<br> Stew thee for our master's dinner,<br> Make of thee a meal for Aino,<br> And her brother, Youkahainen!<br> Better therefore thou shouldst gallop<br> To thy burrow in the mountains,<br> Than be roasted for our dinners."</p> 
 <p>Then the haughty hare made answer,<br> Chanting thus the fate of Aino:<br> "Think ye not I journey hither,<br> To be roasted in the skillet,<br> To be stewed in yonder kettle<br> Let fell Lempo fill thy tables!<br> I have come with evil tidings,<br> Come to tell the cruel story<br> Of the flight and death of Aino,<br> Sister dear of Youkahainen.<br> With the stone of many colors<br> Sank poor Aino to the bottom<br> Of the deep and boundless waters,<br> Like a pretty song-bird perished;<br> Hung her ribbons on the aspen,<br> Left her gold-cross on the sea-shore,<br> Silken robes upon the alders,<br> On the rocks her silken stockings,<br> On the grass her shoes of deer-skin,<br> In the sand her shining necklace,<br> In the sand her rings and jewels;<br> In the waves, the lovely Aino,<br> Sleeping on the very bottom<br> Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,<br> In the caverns of the salmon,<br> There to be the whiting's sister<br> And the friend of nimble fishes."</p> 
 <p>Sadly weeps the ancient mother<br> From her blue-eyes bitter tear-drops,<br> As in sad and wailing measures,<br> Broken-hearted thus she answers:<br> "Listen, all ye mothers, listen,<br> Learn from me a tale of wisdom:<br> Never urge unwilling daughters<br> From the dwellings of their fathers,<br> To the bridegrooms that they love not,<br> Not as I, inhuman mother,<br> Drove away my lovely Aino,<br> Fairest daughter of the Northland."</p> 
 <p>Sadly weeps the gray-haired mother,<br> And the tears that fall are bitter,<br> Flowing down her wrinkled visage,<br> Till they trickle on her bosom;<br> Then across her heaving bosom,<br> Till they reach her garment's border;<br> Then adown her silken stockings,<br> Till they touch her shoes of deer-skin;<br> Then beneath her shoes of deer-skin,<br> Flowing on and flowing ever,<br> Part to earth as its possession,<br> Part to water as its portion.<br> As the tear-drops fall and mingle,<br> Form they streamlets three in number,<br> And their source, the mother's eyelids,<br> Streamlets formed from pearly tear-drops,<br> Flowing on like little rivers,<br> And each streamlet larger growing,<br> Soon becomes a rushing torrent<br> In each rushing, roaring torrent<br> There a cataract is foaming,<br> Foaming in the silver sunlight;<br> From the cataract's commotion<br> Rise three pillared rocks in grandeur;<br> From each rock, upon the summit,<br> Grow three hillocks clothed in verdure;<br> From each hillock, speckled birches,<br> Three in number, struggle skyward;<br> On the summit of each birch-tree<br> Sits a golden cuckoo calling,<br> And the three sing, all in concord:<br> "Love! O Love! the first one calleth;<br> Sings the second, Suitor! Suitor!<br> And the third one calls and echoes,<br> "Consolation! Consolation!"<br> He that "Love! O Love!" is calling,<br> Calls three moons and calls unceasing,<br> For the love-rejecting maiden<br> Sleeping in the deep sea-castles.<br> He that "Suitor! Suitor!" singeth,<br> Sings six moons and sings unceasing<br> For the suitor that forever<br> Sings and sues without a hearing.<br> He that sadly sings and echoes,<br> "Consolation! Consolation!"<br> Sings unceasing all his life long<br> For the broken-hearted mother<br> That must mourn and weep forever.</p> 
 <p>When the lone and wretched mother<br> Heard the sacred cuckoo singing,<br> Spake she thus, and sorely weeping:<br> "When I hear the cuckoo calling,<br> Then my heart is filled with sorrow;<br> Tears unlock my heavy eyelids,<br> Flow adown my, furrowed visage,<br> Tears as large as silver sea pearls;<br> Older grow my wearied elbows,<br> Weaker ply my aged fingers,<br> Wearily, in all its members,<br> Does my body shake in palsy,<br> When I hear the cuckoo singing,<br> Hear the sacred cuckoo calling."</p>
