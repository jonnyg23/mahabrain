One little maid<br>  Companion'd her, a novice in that house,<br>  To whom the Queen in lighter hours of grief--<br>  For sorrow weighs not always equally,<br>  Else there were none could bear--gave listless heed.<br>  As one through blinding mists of care and dole<br>  Might half discern a kitten at its play,<br>  And smile, scarce comprehending why, so she,<br>  The Queen, unto the novice's prattle turn'd<br>  Half ear, dulling, it may be, thus the edge<br>  Of grief, for low the maiden's voice and sweet.<br>  "Sir Feumbras my father was," so said<br>  The maid, "a knight of Arthur's Table Round,<br>  A goodly man, much favor'd of his King.<br>  To him King Arthur gave to wife the fair<br>  Jehanne of Camelot, and I was born<br>  Of these who in the selfsame summer died,<br>  A lustrum since."<br>                          Low to herself the Queen,<br>  "I knew them both, a simple, happy pair,<br>  Who lov'd each other and who knew no sin."<br>  Then spoke again the maid:<br>  <br>                                Thereafter liv'd<br>  I with the kinsfolk of my name until<br>  A twelvemonth back I came to Almesbury.<br>  But oft I sigh for Camelot and think<br>  In dreams I hear my father call my name,<br>  The name himself would give me when I pleas'd<br>  Him well, for yet I had another name."<br>  "Yea, and what was it?" said the sad ey'd Queen.<br>  To whom the novice answer'd,<br>                                                    "Guinevere,<br>  The name that's borne at court by Arthur's Queen."<br>  "A luckless name," the Queen made answer here,<br>  "A name that carries with it shame and tears."<br>  "And think you thus?" in awe the novice said,<br>  "Yet so it seems these latter days, if words<br>  They say of Arthur's Queen indeed be true.<br>  Perchance my father fear'd it when he call'd<br>  Me Muffet in its stead.  Would I might hear<br>  Him call me Muffet now,"--and here the maid<br>  Her sentence broke in air and mus'd a space,<br>  And silence fell upon the twain, and roll'd<br>  Far off the thunder while a summer storm<br>  Drew quickly on.<br>                               Then guilty Guinevere<br>  Past into sadder musings than the maid's,<br>  And nearer crept the storm and darker grew<br>  The cell wherein they sat.  But she, the Queen,<br>  Deep wrapt in bitter thoughts, knew not of this,<br>  But felt at last a pulling at her gown,<br>  And, rousing, saw no form, but heard a cry,--<br>  "The storm! the storm."  Then came a deaf'ning sound,<br>  As if the tow'rs of all the world were thrown<br>  To earth, and in the yellow, quiv'ring flame<br>  She saw the novice's frighten'd face and gleam<br>  Of holy symbols on the wall.  Close clung<br>  The maid, and when the storm grew one fierce roar,<br>  And darting flame one baleful yellow glare,<br>  Shudd'ring, the novice hid an awestruck face<br>  Within the folds of samite black that clothed<br>  The Queen.  Then Guinevere the elder threw<br>  One arm about the younger Guinevere,<br>  And waited for the ceasing of the storm.<br>  Guilt shielding tender Innocence,--thus ran<br>  The bitter thought of Arthur's sinful wife.<br>  So past an hour, until, its passion spent,<br>  The storm rush'd angrily to other lands,<br>  And drew with it the roar and gloom and glare;<br>  And after, through the casement, came a shaft<br>  Of yellow sungleam, that in sport did seem<br>  To move and flicker o'er the rush-spread floor.<br>  Thereat the little novice rais'd her head<br>  From out the sable samite folds, and fell<br>  Again to harmless prattle of herself<br>  And of her simple life before she came<br>  To Almesbury.<br>           "Few mates I had, nor car'd,"<br>  So went the tale, "and happier was I<br>  To sit at home and list to tales of arms<br>  Told by my father and his brother knights<br>  Than roam the city streets unthrift of joy.<br>  And when my mother prais'd my daily task<br>  If done as she would have it, would she place<br>  Upon the board before me curds and whey<br>  With snowy manchet bread for well she knew<br>  What fare of all I deem'd the best.<br>                                             And once<br>  I sat beneath a hanging vine, that made<br>  A cool, green shadow at the farther end<br>  Of the long garden at my father's house.<br>  Over me sang the joyous birds full sweet,<br>  And close beside uprose a lofty wall,<br>  On which the golden moss and lichen slept.<br>  A curious, carven, wooden bowl I held,<br>  Fill'd almost to its brim with curds and whey,<br>  And on the crimson-tufted tuffet where<br>  I sat, with space enow for two, a loaf<br>  Of toothsome manchet lay.  No single care<br>  Had I, the contents of the carven bowl<br>  The limit of my childish wants; but ere<br>  The spoon to lip was lifted, all the song<br>  Above my head was husht and silence crept<br>  Athwart the golden afternoon.  Then I,<br>  With boding fear, turn'd to the lichen'd wall<br>  And on its surface saw a hideous blot<br>  With moving legs, and horny claws, and eyes<br>  Quick darting.  Scarce my father's blazon'd shield<br>  Might hide the creature's bulk, for surely saw<br>  I never yet a spider huge as this<br>  Which from the wall at last, down-dropping, came<br>  And on the crimson-tufted tuffet sat,<br>  And sitting, turn'd its baleful glance on me.<br>  A moment only stay'd I there in fear,<br>  And then the horror of it on me grew<br>  Until I fled in haste, the carven bowl<br>  Rolling before me, and the garden walk<br>  Whit'ning with streaming curds and whey.  And when<br>  I told the tale indoors, Sir Feumbras,<br>  My father, shook his head and fear'd lest this<br>  Might be an omen of dread thing to be,<br>  And went at last to Merlin with the tale,<br>  Whom all men counted wisest of the time."<br>  With mention of the wizard's name, the Queen,<br>  Who had half heard, not wholly lost, the tale,<br>  Rous'd to the full ear as she ask'd, "What said<br>  The sage?"<br>                        "But little we might understand,"<br>  Replied the maid, "for dark his meaning was,<br>  And faint his words behind his winter beard,<br>  But mostly seem'd it like to this: 'Again<br>  In years to come a shape beside the child<br>  Shall sit; not black, like this, but fair to look<br>  Upon, and safer were she by the first<br>  With bowl of curds and whey.'  Thus Merlin spake,<br>  But I,--I know not all he meant."<br>                                                       Thereat<br>  The Queen looked hard upon the maid, in doubt<br>  If she were simple-seeming as her words;<br>  And while she gazed her face grew stern and dark,<br>  The sunshine drew itself from off the floor,<br>  The wind swept sobbing thro' a door ajar,<br>  And, in a sudden horror, from the room<br>  The maid fled shuddering!<br>
