WEIR MITCHELL</h2>  </center>  <br>  <br>  Still she stood in the shunning crowd.<br>  "Is there none," she said, aloud,<br>  "None who knelt to me, great and proud,<br>  Will say one word for me, sad and bowed?<br>  Alas!  it seems to me, if I <br>  Were one of you, who, standing by,<br>  Hear gathered in a woman's cry<br>  The years of such an agony,<br>  It seemeth me that I would take<br>  Sweet pity's side for mine own sake,<br>  And, knowing guilt alone should quake,<br>  For chance of right one battle make."<br>  But, no man heeding her, she stayed <br>  Beneath the linden's trembling shade,<br>  And peered, half hopeful, half afraid,<br>  While passed in silence man and maid.<br>  She, staring on the stone-dry street<br>  Through the long summer-noonday heat,<br>  And, stirring never from her seat,<br>  Half saw men's shadows pass her feet.<br>  "Ah me!"  she murmured, "well I see <br>  How bitter each day's life may be<br>  To them who have not where to flee <br>  And are as one with misery."<br>  But, whether knight to tourney rode,<br>  Or bridal garments past her flowed,<br>  Or by some bier slow mourners trode,<br>  No sign of life the woman showed.<br>  <br>  When as the priestly evening threw <br>  The blessed waters of the dew,<br>  About her head her cloak she drew<br>  And hid her face from every view;<br>  Till, asthe twilight grew to shade,<br>  And passed no more or man or maid,<br>  A sudden hand was on her laid.<br>  <br>  "And who art thou?" she moaned, afraid;<br>  Beside her one of visage sad<br>  Which yet to see made sorrow glad<br>  Stood, in a knight's white raiment clad,<br>  But neither sword nor poniard had.<br>  "One who has loved you well," he said.<br>  "Living I loved you well, and dead<br>  I love you still; when joys were spread<br>  Like flowers, and greatness crowned your head,<br>  None loved you more.  Not Arthur gave--<br>  He will not check me from his grave--<br>  So pure a love; nor Launcelot brave<br>  With deeper love had yearned to save."<br>  "Then," said the woman, still at bay,<br>  "Why do I tremble when you lay<br>  A hand upon my shoulder?  Stay,<br>  What is thy name, sir knight, I pray?<br>  For wheresoever memory chase<br>  I know not one such troubled face,<br>  Nor one that hath such godly grace<br>  Of solemn sweetness any place:<br>  But, whatsoever man thou be,<br>  What is it I should do for thee?"<br>  Whereon, he, smiling cheerily,<br>  Said:  "I would have thee follow me."<br>  <br>  Not any answer did he wait,<br>  But turned towards the city gate;<br>  Not any word said she, but straight <br>  Went after, bent and desolate;<br>  And, as a dream might draw, he drew<br>  Her feet to action, till she knew<br>  That house and palace round her grew,<br>  And some wild revel's reeling crew,<br>  And dame and page and squire and knight,<br>  And torches flashing on the sight,<br>  And fiery jewels flaming bright,<br>  And love and music and delight;<br>  But slow across the spangled green<br>  The stern knight went and went the queen,--<br>  He solemn, silent, and serene,<br>  She bending low with humble mien.<br>  But where he turned the music died,<br>  Love-parted lips no more replied,<br>  And, shrinking back on either side,<br>  Serf and lord stared, wonder-eyed,<br>  Or marveling shrunk swift away<br>  Before that visage solemn, gray,<br>  Till, where the leaping fountains sway,<br>  Thick showed the knights in white array.<br>  There where he passed, though moved no breeze,<br>  The leaves stirred trembling on the trees;<br>  And where he looked, by slow degrees<br>  Fell silence and some strange unease,<br>  Whilst whispers ran:  "Who may it be?<br>  What knight is this?  And who is she?<br>  But only Gawain looked to see,<br>  And, praying, fell upon his knee.<br>  Then said a voice full solemnly:<br>  "Of all the knights that look on me,<br>  If only one of them there be<br>  That never hath sinned wittingly,<br>  Let him the woman first disown,<br>  Let him be first to cast a stone<br>  At one, who, fallen from a throne,<br>  Is sad and weary and alone.<br>  Him, when the lists of God are set,<br>  Him, when the knights of God are met,<br>  If that he lacketh answer yet,<br>  The soul of him shall answer get."<br>  <br>  Then, as a lily bowed with rain<br>  Leaps shedding it, she shed her pain,<br>  And towering looked where men, like grain<br>  Storm-humbled, bent upon the plain;<br>  Whilst over her the cold night air<br>  Throbbed with some awful pulse of prayer,<br>  As, bending low with reverent care,<br>  She kissed the good knight's raiment fair.<br>  When as she trembling rose again,<br>  And felt no more in heart and brain<br>  The weary weight of sin and pain,<br>  For him that healed she looked in vain;<br>  And from the starry heavens immense<br>  Unto her soul with penitence<br>  Came, as if felt by some new sense,<br>  The noise of wings departing thence.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>
