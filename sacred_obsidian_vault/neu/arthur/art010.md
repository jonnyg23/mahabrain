I should be finding<br>    Something alter'd in thy courtly tone.<br> Sit--sit by me!  I will think, we've lived so<br>    In the green wood, all our lives, alone.<br>  <center> <i> Iseult</i> </center>  <br> Alter'd, Tristram?  Not in courts, believe me,<br>    Love like mine is alter'd in the breast;<br> Courtly life is light and cannot reach it--<br>    Ah! it lives, because so deep-suppress'd!<br> <br> What, thou think'st men speak in courtly chambers<br>    Words by which the wretched are consoled?<br> What, thou think'st this aching brow was cooler,<br>    Circled, Tristram, by a band of gold?<br> <br> Royal state with Marc, my deep-wrong'd husband--<br>    That was bliss to make my sorrows flee!<br> Silken courtiers whispering honied nothings--<br>    Those were friends to make me false to thee!<br> <br> Ah, on which, if both our lots were balanced,<br>    Was indeed the heaviest burden thrown--<br> Thee, a pining exile in thy forest,<br>    Me, a smiling queen upon my throne?<br> <br> Vain and strange debate, where both have suffer'd,<br>    Both have pass'd a youth consumed and sad,<br> Both have brought their anxious day to evening,<br>    And have now short space for being glad!<br> <br> Join'd we are henceforth; nor will thy people,<br>    Nor thy younger Iseult take it ill,<br> That a former rival shares her office,<br>    When she sees her humbled, pale, and still.<br> <br> I, a faded watcher by thy pillow,<br>    I, a statue on thy chapel-floor,<br> Pour'd in prayer before the Virgin-Mother,<br>    Rouse no anger, make no rivals more.<br> <br> She will cry: "Is this the foe I dreaded?<br>    This his idol? this that royal bride?<br> Ah, an hour of health would purge his eyesight!<br>    Stay, pale queen! for ever by my side."<br> <br> Hush, no words! that smile, I see, forgives me.<br>    I am now thy nurse, I bid thee sleep.<br> Close thine eyes--this flooding moonlight blinds them!--<br>    Nay, all's well again! thou must not weep.  <center> <i> Tristram</i> </center>  <br> I am happy! yet I feel, there's something<br>    Swells my heart, and takes my breath away.<br> Through a mist I see thee; near--come nearer!<br>    Bend--bend down!--I yet have much to say.<br>  <center> <i> Iseult</i> </center>  <br> Heaven! his head sinks back upon the pillow--<br>    Tristram! Tristram! let thy heart not fail!<br> Call on god and on the holy angels!<br>    What, love, courage!--Christ! he is so pale.  <center> <i> Tristram</i> </center>   Hush, 'tis vain, I feel my end approaching!    This is what my mother said should be, When the fierce pains took her in the forest,    The deep draughts of death, in bearing me.  "Son," she said, "thy name shall be of sorrow;    Tristram art thou call'd for my death's sake." So she said, and died in the drear forest.    Grief since then his home with me doth make.  I am dying.--Start not, nor look wildly!    Me, thy living friend, thou canst not save. But, since living we were ununited,    Go not far, O Iseult! from my grave.  Close mine eyes, then seek the princess Iseult;    Speak her fair, she is of royal blood! Say, I will'd so, that thou stay beside me--    She will grant it; she is kind and good.  Now to sail the seas of death I leave thee--    One last kiss upon the living shore!  <center> <i> Iseult</i> </center>  <br> Tristram!--Tristram!--stay--receive me with thee!<br>    Iseult leaves thee, Tristram! never more.<br> <br> 	*		*		*		*<br> <br> You see them clear--the moon shines bright.<br> Slow, slow and softly, where she stood,<br> She sinks upon the ground;--her hood<br> Had fallen back; her arms outspread<br> Still hold her lover's hand; her head<br> Is bow'd, half-buried, on the bed.<br> O'er the blanch'd sheet her raven hair<br> Lies in disorder'd streams; and there,<br> Strung like white stars, the pearls still are,<br> And the golden bracelets, heavy and rare,<br> Flash on her white arms still.<br> The very same which yesternight<br> Flash'd in the silver sconces' light,<br> When the feast was gay and the laughter loud<br> In Tyntagel's palace proud.<br> But then they deck'd a restless ghost<br> With hot-flush'd cheeks and brilliant eyes,<br> And quivering lips on which the tide<br> Of courtly speech abruptly died,<br> And a glance which over the crowded floor,<br> The dancers, and the festive host,<br> Flew ever to the door.<br> That the knights eyed her in surprise,<br> And the dames whispered scoffingly:<br> "Her moods, good lack, they pass like showers!<br> But yesternight and she would be<br> As pale and still as wither'd flowers,<br> And now to-night she laughs and speaks<br> And has a colour in her cheeks;<br> Christ keep us from such fantasy!"--<br> <br> Yes, now the longing is o'erpast,<br> Which, dogg'd by fear and fought by shame<br> Shook her weak bosom day and night,<br> Consumed her beauty like a flame,<br> And dimm'd it like the desert-blast.<br> And though the bed-clothes hide her face,<br> Yet were it lifted to the light,<br> The sweet expression of her brow<br> Would charm the gazer, till his thought<br> Erased the ravages of time,<br> Fill'd up the hollow cheek, and brought<br> A freshness back as of her prime--<br> So healing is her quiet now.<br> So perfectly the lines express<br> A tranquil, settled loveliness,<br> Her younger rival's purest grace.<br> <br> The air of the December-night<br> Steals coldly around the chamber bright,<br> Where those lifeless lovers be;<br> Swinging with it, in the light<br> Flaps the ghostlike tapestry.<br> And on the arras wrought you see<br> A stately Huntsman, clad in green,<br> And round him a fresh forest-scene.<br> On that clear forest-knoll he stays,<br> With his pack round him, and delays.<br> He stares and stares, with troubled face,<br> At this huge, gleam-lit fireplace,<br> At that bright, iron-figured door,<br> And those blown rushes on the floor.<br> He gazes down into the room<br> With heated cheeks and flurried air,<br> And to himself he seems to say:<br> "What place is this, and who are they?<br> Who is that kneeling Lady fair?<br> And on his pillows that pale Knight<br> Who seems of marble on a tomb?<br> How comes it here, this chamber bright,<br> Through whose mullion'd windows clear<br> The castle-court all wet with rain,<br> The drawbridge and the moat appear,<br> And then the beach, and, mark'd with spray,<br> The sunken reefs, and far away<br> The unquiet bright Atlantic plain?<br> --What, has some glamour made me sleep,<br> And sent me with my dogs to sweep,<br> By night, with boisterous bugle-peal,<br> Through some old, sea-side, knightly hall,<br> Not in the free green wood at all?<br> That Knight's asleep and at her prayer<br> That Lady by the bed doth kneel--<br> Then hush, thou boisterous bugle-peal!"<br> --The wild boar rustles in his lair;<br> The fierce hounds snuff the tainted air;<br> But lord and hounds keep rooted there.<br> <br> Cheer, cheer thy dogs into the brake,<br> O Hunter! and without a fear<br> Thy golden-tassell'd bugle blow,<br> And through the glades thy pastime take--<br> For thou wilt rouse no sleepers here!<br> For these thou seest are unmoved;<br> Cold, cold as those who lived and loved<br> A thousand years ago.   <center>III<br>   ISEULT OF BRITTANY<br>  </center>  <br> A year had flown, and o'er the sea away,<br> In Cornwall, Tristram and Queen Iseult lay;<br> In King Marc's chapel, in Tyntagel old--<br> There in a ship they bore those lovers cold.<br> <br> The young surviving Iseult, one bright day,<br> Had wander'd forth.  Her children were at play<br> In a green circular hollow in the heath<br> Which borders the sea-shore--a country path<br> Creeps over it from the till'd fields behind.<br> The hollow's grassy banks are soft-inclined,<br> And to one standing on them, far and near<br> The lone unbroken view spreads bright and clear<br> Over the waste.  This cirque of open ground<br> Is light and green; the heather, which all round<br> Creeps thickly, grows not here; but the pale grass<br> Is strewn with rocks, and many a shiver'd mass<br> Of vein'd white-gleaming quartz, and here and there<br> Dotted with holly-trees and juniper.<br> In the smooth centre of the opening stood<br> Three hollies side by side, and made a screen,<br> Warm with the winter-sun, of burnish'd green<br> With scarlet berries gemm'd, the fell-fare's food.<br> Under the glittering hollies Iseult stands,<br> Watching her children play; their little hands<br> Are busy gathering spars of quartz, and streams<br> Of stagshorn for their hats; anon, with screams<br> Of mad delight they drop their spoils, and bound<br> Among the holly-clumps and broken ground,<br> Racing full speed, and startling in their rush<br> The fell-fares and the speckled missel-thrush<br> Out of their glossy coverts;--but when now<br> Their cheeks were flush'd, and over each hot brow,<br> Under the feather'd hats of the sweet pair,<br> In blinding masses shower'd the golden hair--<br> Then Iseult call'd them to her, and the three<br> Cluster'd under the holly-screen, and she<br> Told them an old-world Breton history.<br> <br>    Warm in their mantles wrapt the three stood there,<br> Under the hollies, in the clear still air--<br> Mantles with those rich furs deep glistering<br> Which Venice ships do from swart Egypt bring.<br> Long they stay'd still--then, pacing at their ease,<br> Moved up and down under the glossy trees.<br> But still, as they pursued their warm dry road,<br> From Iseult's lips the unbroken story flow'd,<br> And still the children listen'd, their blue eyes<br> Fix'd on their mother's face in wide surprise;<br> Nor did their looks stray once to the sea-side,<br> Nor to the brown heaths round them, bright and wide,<br> Nor to the snow, which, though 't was all away<br> From the open heath, still by the hedgerows lay,<br> Nor to the shining sea-fowl, that with screams<br> Bore up from where the bright Atlantic gleams,<br> Swooping to landward; nor to where, quite clear,<br> The fell-fares settled on the thickets near.<br> And they would still have listen'd, till dark night<br> Came keen and chill down on the heather bright;<br> But, when the red glow on the sea grew cold,<br> And the grey turrets of the castle old<br> Look'd sternly through the frosty evening-air,<br> Then Iseult took by the hand those children fair,<br> And brought her tale to an end, and found the path,<br> And led them home over the darkening heath.<br> <br> And is she happy?  Does she see unmoved<br> The days in which she might have lived and loved<br> Slip without bringing bliss slowly away,<br> One after one, to-morrow like to-day?<br> Joy has not found her yet, nor ever will--<br> Is it this thought which makes her mien so still,<br> Her features so fatigued, her eyes, though sweet,<br> So sunk, so rarely lifted save to meet<br> Her children's?  She moves slow; her voice alone<br> Hath yet an infantine and silver tone.<br> But even that comes languidly; in truth,<br> She seems one dying in a mask of youth.<br> And now she will go home, and softly lay<br> Her laughing children in their beds, and play<br> Awhile with them before they sleep; and then<br> She'll light her silver lamp, which fishermen<br> Dragging their nets through the rough waves, afar,<br> Along this iron coast, know like a star,<br> And take her broidery-frame, and there she'll sit<br> Hour after hour, her gold curls sweeping it;<br> Lifting her soft-bent head only to mind<br> Her children, or to listen to the wind.<br> And when the clock peals midnight, she will move<br> Her work away, and let her fingers rove<br> Across the shaggy brows of Tristram's hound<br> Who lies, guarding her feet, along the ground;<br> Or else she will fall musing, her blue eyes<br> Fixt, her slight hands clasp'd on her lap; then rise,<br> And at her prie-dieu kneel, until she have told<br> Her rosary-beads of ebony tipp'd with gold,<br> Then to her soft sleep--and to-morrow'll be<br> To-day's exact repeated effigy.<br> <br> Yes, it is lonely for her in her hall.<br> The children, and the grey-hair'd seneschal,<br> Her women, and Sir Tristram's aged hound,<br> Are there the sole companions to be found.<br> But these she loves; and noisier life than this<br> She would find ill to bear, weak as she is.<br> She has her children, too, and night and day<br> Is with them; and the wide heaths where they play,<br> The hollies, and the cliff, and the sea-shore,<br> The sand, the sea-birds, and the distant sails,<br> These are to her dear as to them; the tales<br> With which this day the children she beguiled<br> She gleaned from Breton grandames, when a child,<br> In every hut along this sea-coast wild.<br> She herself loves them still, and, when they are told,<br> Can forget all to hear them, as of old.<br> <br> Dear saints, it is not sorrow, as I hear,<br> Not suffering, which shuts up eye and ear<br> To all that has delighted them before,<br> And lets us be what we were once no more.<br> No, we may suffer deeply, yet retain<br> Power to be moved and soothed, for all our pain,<br> By what of old pleased us, and will again.<br> No, 'tis the gradual furnace of the world,<br> In whose hot air our spirits are upcurl'd<br> Until they crumble, or else grow like steel--<br> Which kills in us the bloom, the youth, the spring--<br> Which leaves the fierce necessity to feel,<br> But takes away the power--this can avail,<br> By drying up our joy in everything,<br> To make our former pleasures all seem stale.<br> This, or some tyrannous single thought, some fit<br> Of passion, which subdues our souls to it,<br> Till for its sake alone we live and move--<br> Call it ambition, or remorse, or love--<br> This too can change us wholly, and make seem<br> All which we did before, shadow and dream.<br> <br>    And yet, I swear, it angers me to see<br> How this fool passion gulls men potently;<br> Being, in truth, but a diseased unrest,<br> And an unnatural overheat at best.<br> How they are full of languor and distress<br> Not having it; which when they do possess,<br> They straightway are burnt up with fume and care,<br> And spend their lives in posting here and there<br> Where this plague drives them; and have little ease,<br> Are furious with themselves, and hard to please.<br> Like that bald Caesar, the famed Roman wight,<br> Who wept at reading of a Grecian knight<br> Who made a name at younger years than he;<br> Or that renown'd mirror of chivalry,<br> Prince Alexander, Philip's peerless son,<br> Who carried the great war from Macedon<br> Into the Soudan's realm, and thundered on<br> To die at thirty-five in Babylon.<br> <br> What tale did Iseult to the children say,<br> Under the hollies, that bright winter's day?<br> <br> She told them of the fairy-haunted land<br> Away the other side of Brittany,<br> Beyond the heaths, edged by the lonely sea;<br> Of the deep forest-glades of Broce-liande,<br> Through whose green boughs the golden sunshine creeps,<br> Where Merlin by the enchanted thorn-tree sleeps.<br> For here he came with the fay Vivian,<br> One April, when the warm days first began.<br> He was on foot, and that false fay, his friend,<br> On her white palfrey; here he met his end,<br> In these lone sylvan glades, that April-day.<br> This tale of Merlin and the lovely fay<br> Was the one Iseult chose, and she brought clear<br> Before the children's fancy him and her.<br> <br> Blowing between the stems, the forest-air<br> Had loosen'd the brown locks of Vivian's hair,<br> Which play'd on her flush'd cheek, and her blue eyes<br> Sparkled with mocking glee and exercise.<br> Her palfrey's flanks were mired and bathed in sweat,<br> For they had travell'd far and not stopp'd yet.<br> A brier in that tangled wilderness<br> Had scored her white right hand, which she allows<br> To rest ungloved on her green riding-dress;<br> The other warded off the drooping boughs.<br> But still she chatted on, with her blue eyes<br> Fix'd full on Merlin's face, her stately prize.<br> Her 'haviour had the morning's fresh clear grace,<br> The spirit of the woods was in her face.<br> She look'd so witching fair, that learned wight<br> Forgot his craft, and his best wits took flight;<br> And he grew fond, and eager to obey<br> His mistress, use her empire as she may.<br> <br> They came to where the brushwood ceased, and day<br> Peer'd 'twixt the stems; and the ground broke away,<br> In a sloped sward down to a brawling brook;<br> And up as high as where they stood to look<br> On the brook's farther side was clear, but then<br> The underwood and trees began again.<br> This open glen was studded thick with thorns<br> Then white with blossom; and you saw the horns,<br> Through last year's fern, of the shy fallow-deer<br> Who come at noon down to the water here.<br> You saw the bright-eyed squirrels dart along<br> Under the thorns on the green sward; and strong<br> The blackbird whistled from the dingles near,<br> And the weird chipping of the woodpecker<br> Rang lonelily and sharp; the sky was fair,<br> And a fresh breath of spring stirr'd everywhere.<br> Merlin and Vivian stopp'd on the slope's brow,<br> To gaze on the light sea of leaf and bough<br> Which glistering plays all round them, lone and mild,<br> As if to itself the quiet forest smiled.<br> Upon the brow-top grew a thorn, and here<br> The grass was dry and moss'd, and you saw clear<br> Across the hollow; white anemonies<br> Starr'd the cool turf, and clumps of primroses<br> Ran out from the dark underwood behind.<br> No fairer resting-place a man could find.<br> "Here let us halt," said Merlin then; and she<br> Nodded, and tied her palfrey to a tree.<br> <br> They sate them down together, and a sleep<br> Fell upon Merlin, more like death, so deep.<br> Her finger on her lips, then Vivian rose,<br> And from her brown-lock'd head the wimple throws,<br> And takes it in her hand, and waves it over<br> The blossom'd thorn-tree and her sleeping lover.<br> Nine times she waved the fluttering wimple round,<br> And made a little plot of magic ground.<br> And in that daisied circle, as men say,<br> Is Merlin prisoner till the judgment-day;<br> But she herself whither she will can rove--<br> For she was passing weary of his love.<br>
