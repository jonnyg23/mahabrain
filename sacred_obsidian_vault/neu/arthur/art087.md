With grinning jaws<br> They gape horridly,<br> Bearing him back where body and soul<br> Gnaw juiceless bones continually.<br> Jag-toothed dragons, shutting and opening your eyes<br> With hideous slowness!<br> In my soul, too, is a hunger.<br> Ai, ai!<br> The bite of the tooth in flesh that cannot waste!<br> <br> <b> MAIDENS</b> .  Comfort thee, O our Queen!<br> Sorrow is dear to the wise,<br> Who know that Love is leading,<br> And believe--for have they not seen?<br> Mystery of mysteries!<br> The crowned brow is bleeding.<br> <br> <b> ARGENTE</b> .  Alas, my sisters! you are good to me.<br> Your presence is as starlight to my spirit.<br> Your words are as a bird's song in the trees<br> When all the woodland sorrows under clouds.<br> I know the end is sweet--I see it plain,<br> As the jay yonder the bough to which it flies.<br> But oh, the way is long and the heart weak!<br> Is the physician's wound less sore<br> Because his cunning knows that it will heal?<br> The fallen warrior<br> With the broken shaft of the spear driven as a nail<br> Through muscle, sinew, bone, lung, heart--<br> Feels he not, though Valhalla open<br> And the Valkyrs wait with cup and crown,<br> Sharp anguish, intolerable gaspings that pierce<br> Each with keen torture the frayed nerves, killing him<br> A hundred times for once?<br> Ai, ai!<br> It is not all a good to see the things<br> That shall be.  He that will soar to topmost heaven,<br> Must plunge, too, down to the voiceless lowest of hell.<br> Ye shall not know the good without the evil,<br> Saith the Lord God.<br> Ai, ai!  I see the maiden stand in the choir.<br> The royal robes are girt upon her.  Priests<br> And choristers intone monotonously.<br> The sunlight falling bloodily through the panes,<br> Is dim and thick with incense.  The King comes!<br> I see him take her fatal hand in his.<br> Otototoi!  The breath of the god<br> Tingles on my forehead!<br> My flesh quivers with its power!<br> The dread that hung over me sunders as a cloud.<br> A sunlit garden--lay this behind the gloom?<br> And he--is he my fear?<br> Beautiful as Balder he stands by the beautiful queen,<br> High-thoughted, kingly as a cedar.<br> From the high hills the woe cometh,<br> A desolating avalanche! . . . . <br> The scabbard, Arthur!<br> Quick!  The intriguing fingers close on it.<br> Awake!  The sword itself is less precious.  Ah! . .<br> Woe! woe!<br> The stark bodies of the slain!--<br> Spare me, Spirit that overbroods me!<br> I endure not the vision!<br> I am slain with intense whirling of tumultuous life!<br> Back, bodeful clouds!  Once again, as with inrolling waters,<br> Engulf the insufferable sight!<br> Otototoi!<br> The din of shields and the shouts of the warriors!<br> The death-birds hovering afar off! . . . .<br> Where is he, my king, my beloved?<br> Over the sea-like sparkle of shields I seek him--in vain.<br> Ah, ah!<br> There, in the crest of the war-surf--<br> Arthur, Arthur!<br> He struggles toward the treacherous chief.  Their swords clash.<br> O valiant prince!  O misbegotten traitor! . . . .<br> He falls--the King!  the King!<br> The battle sweeps away like a black cloud.<br> What, ho! a rescue! knights! Kaye!
