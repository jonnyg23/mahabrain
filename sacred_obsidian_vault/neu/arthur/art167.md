Then King Ban<br> Shut in one girdled waist of narrow stones<br> His gold and all his men, and set on them<br> A name, the name of perfect men at need,<br> And over them a seneschal, the man<br> Most inward and entailed upon his soul,<br> That next his will and in his pulses moved<br> As the close blood and purpose of his heart,<br> And laid the place between his hands, and rode<br> North to the wild rims of distempered sea<br> That, crossed to Logres, his face might look red [sic]<br> The face of Arthur, and therein light blood<br> Even to the eyes and to the circled hair<br> For shame of failure in so near a need,<br> Failure in service of so near a man.<br> Because that time King Arthur would not ride,<br> But lay and let his hands weaken to white<br> Among the stray gold of a lady's head.<br> His hands unwedded: neither could bring help<br> To Ban that helped to rend his land for him<br> From the steel wrist of spoilers, but the time<br> A sleep like yellow mould had overgrown,<br> A pleasure sweet and sick as marsh-flowers.<br> Therefore about his marches rode King Ban<br> With eyes that fell between his hands to count<br> The golden inches of the saddle-rim,<br> Strange with rare stones; and in his face there rose<br> A doubt that burnt it with red pain and fear<br> All over it, and plucked upon his heart,<br> The old weak heart that loss had eaten through,<br> Remembering how the seneschal went back<br> At coming out from Claudas in his tent;<br> And how they bound together, chin by chin,<br> Whispered and wagged, and made lean room for words,<br> And a sharp mutter fed the ears of them.<br> And he went in and set no thought thereon<br> To waste; fear had not heart to fear indeed,<br> The king being old, since any fear in such<br> Is as a wound upon the fleshly sense<br> That drains a parcel of his time thereout,<br> Therefore he would not fear that as it fell<br> This thing should fall.  For Claudas the keen thief<br> For some thin rounds and wretched stamps of gold<br> Had bought the tower and men and seneschal,<br> Body and breath and blood, yea, soul and shame.<br> They knew not this, at halt upon a hill.<br> Only surmise was dull upon the sense<br> And thin conjecture sickened in the speech;<br> So they fell silent, riding in the hills.<br> There on a little terrace the good king<br> Reined, and looked out.  Far back the white lands lay;<br> The wind went in them like a broken man,<br> Lamely; the mist had set a bitter lip<br> To the rimmed river, and the moon burnt blank.<br> But outward from the castle of King Ban<br> There blew a sound of trouble, and there clomb<br> A fire that thrust an arm across the air,<br> Shook a rent skirt of dragging flame, and blanched<br> The grey flats to such cruel white as shone<br> Iron against the shadow of the sky<br> Blurred out with its blind stars; for as the sea<br> Gathers to lengthen a bleached edge of foam<br> Whole weights of windy water, and the green<br> Brine flares and hisses as the heap makes up,<br> Till the gaunt wave writhes, trying to breathe,<br> Then turns, and all the whited rims of steel<br> Lean over, and the hollowed round roars in<br> And smites the pebble forward in the mud,<br> And grinds the shingle in cool whirls of white,<br> Clashed through and crossed with blank assault of foam,<br> Filled with hard thunder and drenched dregs of sand--<br> So leant and leapt the many-mouthèd fire,<br> So curled upon the walls, dipt, crawled, smote, clung,<br> Caught like a beast that catches on the flesh,<br> Waxed hoar with sick default, shivered across,<br> Choked out, a snake unfed.<br> 			   Thereat King Ban<br> Trembled for pain in all his blood, and death<br> Under the heart caught him and made his breath<br> Wince, as a worm does, wounded in the head;<br> And fear began upon his flesh, and shook<br> The chaste and inly sufferance of it<br> Almost to ruin; a small fire and keen<br> Eating in muscle and nerve and hinge of joint<br> Perilous way; so bitter was the blow<br> Made on his sense by treason and sharp loss.<br> Then he fell weeping tears, with blood in them,<br> Like that red sweat that stained Gethsemane<br> With witness, when the deadly kiss had put<br> Shame on the mouth of Judas; and he cried,<br> Crying on God, and made out words and said:<br> Fair lord, sweet lord, most pleasant to all men,<br> To me so pleasant in clean days of mine<br> That now are rained upon with heavy rain,<br> Soiled with grey grime and with the dusty years,<br> Because in all those tourneys and hot things<br> I had to do with, in all riding times<br> And noise of work, and on smooth holidays<br> Sitting to see the smiting of hard spears,<br> And spur-smiting of steeds and wrath of men,<br> And gracious measure of the rounded game,<br> I held you in true honour and kept white<br> The hands of my allegiance as a maid's,<br> Being whole of faith and perfect in the will.<br> Therefore I pray you, O God marvellous,<br> See me how I am stricken among men,<br> And how the lip I fed with plenteousness<br> And cooled with wine of liberal courtesy<br> Turns a snake's life to poison me and clings--<br>
