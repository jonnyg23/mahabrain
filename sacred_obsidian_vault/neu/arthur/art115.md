In this way I,<br> <br> With sleepy face bent to the chapel floor,<br>   Kept musing half asleep, till suddenly<br> A sharp bell rang from close beside the door,<br>   And I leapt up when something pass'd me by,<br> <br> Shrill ringing going with it, still half blind<br>   I stagger'd after, a great sense of awe<br> At every step kept gathering on my mind,<br>   Thereat I have no marvel, for I saw<br> <br> One sitting on the altar as a throne,<br>   Whose face no man could say he did not know,<br> And though the bell still rang, he sat alone,<br>   With raiment half blood-red, half white as snow.<br> <br> Right so I fell upon the floor and knelt,<br>   Not as one kneels in church when mass is said,<br> But in a heap, quite nerveless, for I felt<br>   The first time what a thing was perfect dread.<br> <br> But mightily the gentle voice came down:<br>   "Rise up, and look and listen, Galahad,<br> Good knight of God, for you will see no frown<br>   Upon my face; I come to make you glad.<br> <br> "For that you say that you are all alone,<br>   I will be with you always, and fear not<br> You are uncared for, though no maiden moan<br>   Above your empty tomb; for Launcelot,<br> <br> "He in good time shall be my servant too,<br>   Meantime, take note whose sword first made him knight,<br> And who has loved him alway, yea, and who<br>   Still trusts him alway, though in all men's sight,<br> <br> "He is just what you know, O Galahad,<br>   This love is happy even as you say,<br> But would you for a little time be glad,<br>   To make ME sorry long, day after day?<br> <br> "Her warm arms round his neck half throttle ME,<br>   The hot love-tears burn deep like spots of lead,<br> Yea, and the years pass quick: right dismally<br>   Will Launcelot at one time hang his head;<br> <br> "Yea, old and shrivell'd he shall win my love.<br>   Poor Palomydes fretting out his soul!<br> Not always is he able, son, to move<br>   His love, and do it honour: needs must roll<br> <br> "The proudest destrier sometimes in the dust,<br>   And then 'tis weary work; he strives beside<br> Seem better than he is, so that his trust<br>   Is always on what chances may betide;<br> <br> "And so he wears away, my servant, too,<br>   When all these things are gone, and wretchedly<br> He sits and longs to moan for Iseult, who<br>   Is no care now to Palomydes: see,<br> <br> "O good son, Galahad, upon this day,<br>   Now even, all these things are on your side,<br> But these you fight not for; look up, I say,<br>   And see how I can love you, for no pride<br> <br> "Closes your eyes, no vain lust keeps them down.<br>   See now you have ME always; following<br> That holy vision, Galahad, go on,<br>   Until at last you come to ME to sing<br> <br> "In Heaven always, and to walk around<br>   The garden where I am."  He ceased, my face<br> And wretched body fell upon the ground;<br>   And when I look'd again, the holy place<br> <br> Was empty; but right so the bell again<br>   Came to the chapel-door, there entered<br> Two angels first, in white, without a stain,<br>   And scarlet wings, then, after them, a bed<br> <br> Four ladies bore, and set it down beneath<br>   The very altar-step, and while for fear<br> I scarcely dared to move or draw my breath,<br>   Those holy ladies gently came a-near,<br> <br> And quite unarm'd me, saying: "Galahad,<br>   Rest here awhile and sleep, and take no thought<br> Of any other thing than being glad;<br>   Hither the Sangreal will be shortly brought,<br> <br> "Yet must you sleep the while it stayeth here."<br>   Right so they went away, and I, being weary,<br> Slept long and dream'd of Heaven: the bell comes near,<br>   I doubt it grows to morning.  Miserere!<br>  <i> Enter Two Angels in white, with scarlet wings; also, Four Ladies in gowns of red and green; also an Angel, bearing in his hands a surcoat of white, with a red cross.</i> <br>  <br>  <center>AN ANGEL</center> <br> O servant of the high God, Galahad!<br>   Rise and be arm'd: the Sangreal is gone forth<br> Through the great forest, and you must be had<br>   Unto the sea that lieth on the north:<br> <br> There shall you find the wondrous ship wherein<br>   The spindles of King Solomon are laid,<br> And the sword that no man draweth without sin,<br>   But if he be most pure: and there is stay'd,<br> <br> Hard by, Sir Launcelot, whom you will meet<br>   In some short space upon that ship: first, though,<br> Will come here presently that lady sweet,<br>   Sister of Percival, whom you well know,<br> <br> And with her Bors and Percival: stand now,<br>   These ladies will to arm you.<br> FIRST LADY, <i> putting on the hauberk</i> <br> 			Galahad,<br> That I may stand so close beneath your brow,<br>   Margaret of Antioch, am glad.<br> <br> SECOND LADY, <i> girding him with the sword</i> .<br> That I may stand and touch you with my hand,<br>   O Galahad, I, Cecily, am glad.<br> THIRD LADY, <i> buckling on the spurs</i> .<br> That I may kneel while up above you stand,<br>   And gaze at me, O holy Galahad,<br> <br> I, Lucy, am most glad.<br> FOURTH LADY, <i> putting on the basnet</i> .<br> 			O gentle knight,<br>   That you bow down to us in reverence,<br> We are most glad, I, Katherine, with delight<br>   Must needs fall trembling.<br> ANGEL, <i> putting on the crossed surcoat</i> .<br> 			Galahad, we go hence,<br> <br> For here, amid the straying of the snow,<br>   Come Percival's sister, Bors, and Percival.<br> <i> [The Four Ladies carry out the bed,<br> and all go but</i>  Galahad.<br>  <center>GALAHAD.</center>  <br> How still and quiet everything seems now:<br>   They come, too, for I hear the horsehoofs fall.<br> <br> <i> Enter</i>  Sir Bors, Sir Percival <i> and</i>  his Sister.<br> <br> Fair friends and gentle lady, God you save!<br>   A many marvels have been here to-night;<br> Tell me what news of Launcelot you have,<br>   And has God's body ever been in sight?<br>  <center>SIR BORS.</center>  <br> Why, as for seeing that same holy thing,<br>   As we were riding slowly side by side,<br> An hour ago, we heard a sweet voice sing,<br>   And through the bare twigs saw a great light glide,<br> <br> With many-colour'd raiment, but far off;<br>   And so pass'd quickly: from the court nought good;<br> Poor merry Dinadan, that with jape and scoff<br>   Kept us all merry, in a little wood<br> <br> Was found all hack'd and dead: Sir Lionel<br>   And Gauwaine have come back from the great quest,<br> Just merely shamed; and Lauvaine, who loved well<br>   Your father Launcelot, at the king's behest<br> <br> Went out to seek him, but was almost slain,<br>   Perhaps is dead now; everywhere<br> The knights come foil'd from the great quest, in vain;<br>   In vain they struggle for the vision fair.<br>
