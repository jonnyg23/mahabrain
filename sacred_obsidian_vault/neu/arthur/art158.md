align="CENTER">GEORGE AUGUSTUS SIMCOX</h2>  </center>  <br>  Ganore was standing at the convent gate<br>  With Lancelot, and she held him by the hand,<br>  And in the fierce noon of a harvest day<br>  They both looked forth upon a wasted land;<br>  And Queen Ganore was in her royal state<br>  Of widowhood, as when she kept at bay<br>  The rabble, when they hungered for her death,<br>  Saying, "Surely Arthur will not come again<br>  Till that lewd sorceress be foully slain."<br>  But she had stood for her own life and fame<br>  Until from Lyonnesse Sir Lancelot came,<br>  Unblenching, though old memories choked her breath.<br>  Lancelot was travel-stained, and all his face<br>  Was flushed, and clouded by an eager doubt;<br>  His eyes were heavy with the tears of grace,<br>  And, bending to his love, he faltered out<br>  Penitent words, with stifled sobs between,<br>  "Alas, and yet again alas, my Queen,<br>  That ever we met and one another knew;<br>  For all the ill that reckless hate can do,<br>  My loyal, scrupulous love hath done to you;<br>  For through my loyal love your lord is slain,<br>  Your lord and mine, who bred me up to knight;<br>  And on your womanhood is come a stain<br>  Of treason, which no oaths will e'er wash white,<br>  And all your joy is hidden out of sight.<br>  But I will leave my realm of Lyonnesse<br>  In peace, for Galahad my chaste son to rule;<br>  And in the wilderness my sad heart school<br>  To worship God, and pray for you aright;<br>  Because this world is very pitiless,<br>  To make us buy with sin its brief delight."<br>     Trembling he spoke, and looking up to her,<br>  But she stood upright, looking far away,<br>  With a hot glory on her golden head;<br>  Her scarcely sunken cheek was flushed full fair,<br>  Not at his words, but at the fierce sun ray:<br>  Then, bending on him eyes which were not red,<br>  With lofty, motherly regard, she said,<br>  Smoothing his tangled curls with soft cool hand,<br>  "Yea, and is Lyonnesse a peaceful land?<br>  God give you comfort of it, as you grow<br>  Sadly to heaven, in your bleak hermitage,<br>  For surely Britain shall sit down in woe,<br>  Since Arthur died with all his baronage.<br>  Farewell, my friend, whom I shall see no more,<br>  For even in heaven we shall dwell apart<br>  Where God, who came between us heretofore,<br>  Seals up within himself weak heart from heart."<br>     She took him, and she kissed him on the brow,<br>  And bade him go in peace to keep his vow,<br>  And saw him ride away, and did not start,<br>  But listened till his echoing tramp had died<br>  Upon the granite of the bleak hillside;<br>  Then, when she knew that Lancelot would not hear,<br>  She loosed her voice and made complaint aloud.<br>  The nuns behind her shivered in much fear,<br>  Seeing her stand beneath a thundercloud<br>  Which suddenly had overshadowed her;<br>  But where they stood the arch of heaven was clear,<br>  And from the cloud an icy wind, which fell<br>  From heaven to probe the fiery heart of hell,<br>  Through underground, deep-echoing caverns bore<br>  The lamentation of the Queen Ganore:--<br>     "Alone for evermore.<br>  I watched him, and he did not turn his head,<br>  And I shall be alone till I am dead;<br>  Alone for evermore.<br>  And I would weep a little ere I die,<br>  And all the fountain of my tears is dry,<br>  Which heretofore<br>  With many vain desires my true love fed,<br>  While I believed the oaths that Lancelot swore;<br>  But now I do not weep, I feel no pain;<br>  I tell myself aloud my lord is slain,<br>  I tell myself my love is gone away,<br>  Never to come again;<br>  And find no passionate true word to say,<br>  But only this unmeaning cuckoo cry,<br>  Alone until I die.<br>  <br>     "Surely these words are sharp enough to slay<br>  One who did once love well,<br>  Or scourge me out of the bleak, desolate day<br>  Into meek clositer cell;<br>  But I, I loiter still outside the door,<br>  Alone for evermore.<br>  Through me the fiery river of life hath flowed<br>  Hot and clear with love and sin;<br>  Through me and over me, and I have glowed<br>  Body and soul therein.<br>  And then I was not molten in that heat<br>  Nor broken; I was wise and it was sweet.<br>  And now the river hath gone by,<br>  And left me cold and dark and dry,<br>  Cast on a slimy bank accursed.<br>  Also I know that this is not the worst;<br>  But each day will be drearier till I die.<br>  Arthur could weep for me, why cannot I?<br>  O Arthur, O my perfect knight,<br>  And thou didst pity me,<br>  Not knowing that I loved thee even then,<br>  Who love thee now much more, not pitying thee,<br>  Since now thou judgest in God's tender light<br>  Rightly of me and men.<br>  Yes, God will make you understand<br>  Those bitter things I would not say,<br>  Thinking it easier, kinder to deceive.<br>  But now you will not grieve<br>  Where you are sitting by the glassy sea,<br>  On a great ivory throne at God's right-hand,--<br>  God's hand who cut you off from me,<br>  Who made me of such different clay.<br>  I love thee much too well to weep for thee,<br>  Who art gone home,--gone home to thy reward,<br>  Arthur, my Arthur once, my gentle lord.<br>  <br>     "I have desired and I have not attained;<br>  And I have given and I have not received;<br>  And I have lived and nought is gained<br>  Of all those goodly things my youth believed.<br>  I have lived, do I say?<br>  And yet I have to live<br>  Long, very long, before I pass away,<br>  Before my beauty and my strength decay,--<br>  My strength, which hath been helpful heretofore;<br>  My beauty, which no knights shall worship more.<br>  I asked of Arthur what he could not give;<br>  I gave what Lancelot could not repay.<br>  My God, what shall I say?<br>  And Arthur asked of me<br>  To live in dreams, hoping what shall not be;<br>  And Arthur asked in vain.<br>  Because we asked how many have been slain!<br>  Wilt thou require their blood of me?<br>  And Lancelot is parted now in pain,<br>  Because I am less sorrowful than he,<br>  And still could have been happy out of thee;<br>  But thou, it seems, dost otherwise ordain.<br>  And unto earth is sunshine after rain,<br>  But unto us no gladness after pain,<br>  Or none that may endure,<br>  None that is pure.<br>  But when the storm is past,<br>  The sky laughs without stain;<br>  While sorrow doth our spirits overcast<br>  With clouds that do not wash them white again.<br>  Yet how shall I complain<br>  That Arthur loved too little, I too much;<br>  That Lancelot's hot love shrivelled at the touch<br>  Of thy disdain?<br>  Yea, how shall I complain<br>  Of thee, my God, with whom I hope to reign?<br>  For this is all of thee.<br>  I made thee not, thou madest me.<br>  Doubtless I might have striven against the stream,<br>  Labouring to live in Arthur's knightly dream.<br>  He might have folded me in arms of love<br>  More closely, though his eyes were set above.<br>  But not by us the river of our woe<br>  Was fed with vain desires, or learned to flow<br>  Through flowery mountains to a barren plain;<br>  And since we drifted many have been slain,<br>  And very many homes are desolate;<br>  And yet, behold, I curse thee not, O God!<br>  Though men curse me;<br>  Because I do not think it is in hate<br>  That we are beaten down before thy rod,<br>  Which flowers, though late.<br>  And I am tired, and it is rest to wait;<br>  And one grief comes to drive another out,<br>  And turbulent desire is purged by doubt;<br>  And this too is of thee,<br>  To bring us very low and set us free.<br>  For Arthur verily is dead,<br>  So I am not in bondage to his bed;<br>  And Lancelot is gone to keep his vow;<br>  I am not debtor unto any now.<br>  I do not think that I shall tarry here,<br>  To teach these pitiful nuns to hold me dear;<br>  But I will out into the wilds, and know<br>  If Lancelot and the priests have told me true,<br>  If I in very deed am fallen so low<br>  That I should be as they,<br>  Whose very hearts are grey;<br>  And yet Christ is their spouse, they say,<br>  Whose mercy I need too."<br>  <br>     And then she paused in her lament, and sighed,<br>  And spake again, "Men only have I tried,<br>  And they have shallow hearts, and so have I.<br>  I will away from them before I die,<br>  And be a little child and taste the summer-tide.<br>  I will away; the sunny world is wide,--<br>  And desolate," her aching heart replied.<br>  <br>     Yet not the less she bade the nuns farewell<br>  In courteous words, and covered up her pride,<br>  Saying, "O my sisters, it is yours to hide<br>  For ever in your Husband's wounded side.<br>  Yet He, you know, ere he was crucified,<br>  Went forth into the wilderness to dwell,<br>  And taste, before the Cross, the might of Hell;<br>  And I must meet Him there, and there be tried."<br>  Nor knew she whether she spake truth, or lied,<br>  Of some fierce trial which she thought to bide.<br>  So the nuns kissed her, and they shut the door,<br>  Who neither on that day nor any more<br>  Beheld again the beauty of Ganore.<br>  But, as one stealing silently from thrall,<br>  The Queen went softly by the cloister-wall,<br>  Where the green moss deadened her light footfall.<br>  Turning away from the waste harvest-lands,<br>  Which at that time were desolate with war,<br>  Upon whose edge the quaint peaked convent stands<br>  Upon a little knoll of jutting moor,<br>  Jutting into a sea of yellow corn,<br>  Bounded by a grey scoop of granite shore,<br>  Too thinly veiled by withered bents forlorn,<br>  Where Lancelot had ridden, but Ganore<br>  Would have died rather than have followed him.<br>  And round the knoll the fringe of copse was dim<br>  With tangled glades she had not trod before,<br>  And she passed into them, and was content;<br>  For through the copse a leaping river went,<br>  Tawny between the purple-lichened rocks:<br>  Ripe iris-heads were green among the bent,<br>  And here and there a spike of foxglove grew,<br>  Where through the twisted oaks the sun broke through;<br>  And overhead was a soft noise of flocks,<br>  Feeding on purple, overarched with blue.<br>  So she went stumbling softly through the shade,<br>  By a green path made rough with roots and stones,<br>  Where still, I think, the fly of summer drones,<br>  But no queen stumbles upward through the glade.<br>  But then a dreamy queen went fingering<br>  At reddening berries and at fading flowers,<br>  Kissing them often as she wandered on,<br>  In happy memory of those early hours,<br>  Unclouded by the grim dreams of the King,<br>  When she and Lancelot had often gone<br>  Together, in glad lowland woods, in May;<br>  And all that happiness was past away<br>  For ever, and she knew it, but a sleep<br>  Was on her soul; she saw quaint shadows play<br>  Under the leaves, and she forgot to weep;<br>  And something in her heart began to pray,<br>  And magnify God's mother, queen of spring<br>  And harvest, in a little childish lay,<br>  For very gladness of that glorious day.<br>  And from the birckenshaw a milk-white doe<br>  Kissed the Queen's feet, who went on pilgrimage;<br>  Then fluttering out of her fair woodland cage,<br>  Her eyes took wing, seeing a great lake glow<br>  In azure set between two golden hills,<br>  Golden with furze and fading birch below;<br>  Above was purple heath, which fed the rills<br>  That leapt in silver round the rocky head,<br>  With double cirque of green encompassed;<br>  Where grey turf hung between grey crags of stone,<br>  But in the light the grass was golden green.<br>  Then at her left Ganore espied a crone,<br>  Branded as bondmaid to the Holy Grail,<br>  Who wore her white hair woven for a veil,<br>  Crowned with gold rays, for she too was a queen,<br>  And sat upon the black coils of a snake,<br>  And her blue feet hung down in the blue lake,<br>  Nailed to an iron cross, but did not bleed;<br>  And backwards she was spelling out a creed.<br>  But higher up she saw a white flock feed,<br>  And upon each there were three locks of red,<br>  And in the figure of the cross they fed;<br>  Their shepherd was a boy in gay attire<br>  Of many colours, with a crook of gold;<br>  He lay as haply fifteen summers old,<br>  But where his face should be there was a fire,<br>  Whence came a carolling how the stars should pale<br>  Before the radiance of the Holy Grail.<br>  Ganore beheld, and did not think it strange,<br>  For all these sights were fixed in the bright day,<br>  And seemed as if they could not pass away,<br>  But had been uncontaminate by change<br>  Since the world was, abiding in one stay.<br>  Wherefore Ganore, beholding, only sighed,<br>  "How many of the Table would have died,<br>  And held the forfeit of life's earthly bliss<br>  Too cheap a purchase for a sight like this!"<br>  But to the shepherd-boy the old Queen cried,<br>  "When wilt thou take her captive to the Grail?"<br>  But from the fire there came a sighing wail,<br>  "How can I, for her love is crucified?"<br>  Whereat Ganore fled up the steep hillside<br>  Towards the right, but one of that fair flock<br>  Leapt from the shadow of a brambly rock,<br>  And thenceforth went before her for a guide;<br>  But when Ganore laid hand upon its head,<br>  Her hand, and all the wool it touched, were red.<br>  So they pushed on together through the brake,<br>  And ever as they clomb Ganore looked down<br>  Over the steep green slope to the blue lake,<br>  And marvelled, "How if once my steps should slide!"<br>  And thought she saw far off the old Queen frown.<br>  But when they won the crest of that glad slope,<br>  Ganore was disappointed of her hope<br>  To look upon new lands and a new sky;<br>  Only she saw an upward stretching moor,<br>  Where in the treacherous peat the black pools lie,<br>  And no heath grew thereon, but rushes hoar:<br>  And these were autumn hued, and all the green<br>  Was moss, wherethrough the still moor waters run.<br>  And as she journeyed on, the lonely queen<br>  Looked up into the sky, and missed the sun,<br>  And missed the shapely peaks of splintered rock,<br>  And missed the shepherd with his magic flock,<br>  And shuddered in the wailing evening wind,<br>  And saw the country gleam below, behind,<br>  In the warm brilliance of the sun's broad ray;<br>  And said, "Alas for those who walk on high,<br>  Because for them the sun makes haste to set!"<br>  And then she spake again, "O God, forget<br>  My sin, and give me light before I die,"<br>  For the chill purple air was full of death;<br>  Nor knew she how one little ridge of clay<br>  Shut out the glorious deathbed of the day.<br>  And then she went a little further on,<br>  Hanging her head because the light was gone,<br>  And stumbled in the reeds, and caught her breath;<br>  For suddenly she stood against the sky,<br>  And close beneath her lay a breadth of sea,<br>  Plashing against a space of weedy shore,<br>  Still dripping from the ebbing waves, and bright<br>  With bars of purple, flecked with ruddier gold,<br>  For on the left the thunderclouds were rolled<br>  Each upon each, to slumber through the night,<br>  And through their curtains glared the fiery sun.<br>  But in the east, upon the right, Ganore<br>  Saw a dim purple clinging round the sea,<br>  Like a dim veil that clings about a nun;<br>  And a soft rose flushed the chill middle sky,<br>  And in the rose, the young moon rode on high;<br>  But Queen Ganore fell down, and bent the knee,<br>  Trembling alone at God's great majesty.<br>  Then she went down, slowly with knocking knees,<br>  Catching at tufts of grass and stunted trees,<br>  By a dry watercourse, and heard the breeze<br>  Hiss over the steep slope of loose dry stone,<br>  And crossed her bleeding hands, and bowed her head:<br>  "If I die here,--what matter were I dead!<br>  None will lament for me, I am alone."<br>  But she died not, but gained the lonely shore,<br>  And saw the white sheep skipping on before,<br>  And waxed more hopeful following where it led<br>  Still to the west, and it was twilight now,<br>  And in the twilight every rocky brow<br>  Showed sharp and clear against the ghost of day,<br>  Against clear hungry spiritual grey.<br>  But, with the sun, the wind had died away;<br>  So all was peace, and you could scarcely hear<br>  The loving plash of the returning tide,<br>  As though some tender angel hovering near<br>  Made all things to forget their strength and pride.<br>  And so in peace, Ganore turned round a rock<br>  Sharply, and she was in a little bay,<br>  Fronting the perfect circle of the west;<br>  And on the sands a little shallop lay<br>  Ready to float upon the ebb to sea,<br>  Wherein was neither anchor, helm, nor oar,<br>  But one fair sail of purple wrought with gold,<br>  And in the sheets a little crimson fold,<br>  Wherein a scroll in silver words to say,<br>  "For the espousals of the Queen Ganore."<br>  Whereat the queen was troubled when she read,<br>  And knew that she was taken in the bay,<br>  For now on either side the full sea rolled;<br>  So she, adventuring on the mystery,<br>  Sat in the boat, and took upon her knee<br>  The patient firstling of the magic flock,<br>  And waited, bowing down her black veiled head<br>  Over her white hands folded on her breast,<br>  And after her long journey took sweet rest,<br>  Where, on the solitary, rock-bound shore,<br>  The balmy night came down upon Ganore.<br>
