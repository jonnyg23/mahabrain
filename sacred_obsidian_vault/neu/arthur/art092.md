<h2 align="CENTER">SOPHIE JEWETT</h2>  </center>  <br>  <br> Sir Dagonet was sad of heart;<br>    Beneath the city gate<br> He watched King Arthur's knights depart;<br>    He watched in love and hate.<br> <br> He saw great tears fall from the eyes<br>    Of Lancelot and the King;<br> He thought: "Apart the sweet Queen lies,<br>    And knows no comforting."<br> <br> Sir Percivale and Galahad<br>    Rode by in shining mail;<br> He marked their eyes, assured and glad,<br>    And cursed the Holy Grail.<br> <br> Though many passed and saw him not,<br>    He hoarded, in his pain,<br> A smile from sad Sir Lancelot,<br>    Three sweet words from Gawain.<br> <br> King Arthur's fool was Dagonet,<br>    An impish, mocking thing;<br> His wont by day to carp and fret,<br>    At night to dance and sing.<br> <br> The foot and fist of rude Sir Kay<br>    He bore with jest and sneer;<br> But wept to meet on any day<br>    The eyes of Guinevere.<br> <br> That night he sat without the gate,<br>    Close by the city wall,<br> Till King and court, returning late,<br>    Climbed sadly toward the Hall.<br> <br> He thought of all the good knights bent<br>    On unknown, wandering ways;<br> He thought of feast and tournament,<br>    And laughter of old days.<br> <br> He would not enter with his King;<br>    He heard the warder call,<br> Yet waited, crouched and shivering,<br>    Beside the city wall.<br> <br> Crooked and weak was Dagonet,<br>    What might to him avail<br> The hope whereon high hearts were set,<br>    To find the Holy Grail?<br> <br> Yet ice and flame were in his breast;<br>    He hid his curling lip,<br> And wept for fierce desire to quest<br>    With the great Fellowship.<br> <br> On nameless, shining paths afar,<br>    Where'er the vision bade,<br> He saw them ride,-saw like a star<br>    The face of Galahad.<br> <br> Then on his heart fell unforgot,<br>    More soft than April rain,<br> The smile of sad Sir Lancelot,<br>    The sweet words of Gawain.<br> <br> And Dagonet the jester laid<br>    His face against the stone,<br> And prayed to Him who once had prayed<br>    In blood and tears alone;<br> <br> And lo! a strange voice reached his ears,<br>    Borne on soft-drifting wings;<br> 'T was gentler than Queen Guinevere's,<br>    'T was kinglier than the King's.<br> <br> It spake: "Thou foolish one, look up!<br>    Believe, and be thou glad;<br> There waits one vision of the Cup<br>    For thee and Galahad."<br> <br> But Dagonet cried: "Lord, to me<br>    What may thy grace avail,<br> Since, late, in wrath and misery,<br>    I cursed the Holy Grail?"<br> <br> Low in the dust knelt Dagonet;<br>    The sweet voice filled the air:<br> "Thy cursing lips I do forget,<br>    Because of thy heart's prayer."<br> <br> Next day 't was told through Camelot,<br>    With pity or with jest,<br> That Dagonet the dwarf came not<br>    Because he rode the Quest.<br> <br> Next day and next, for many a day,<br>    Sir Dagonet rode hard;<br> Sometimes deep forest blurred his way,<br>    Or swollen torrent barred;<br> <br> But everywhere the bright spring laid<br>    Her gold about his feet;<br> And every hour the high Quest made<br>    Hope at his heart stir sweet.<br> <br> At hermitage and castle gate<br>    He asked, alway in vain:<br> Nor Lancelot had passed of late,<br>    Nor Bors, nor good Gawain.<br> <br> Now once it chanced that his path ran<br>    Along a riverside,<br> Till, where a chestnut wood began,<br>    He saw the ways divide.<br> <br> And close beneath the roadside cross<br>    There lay a wounded knight;<br> His blood was black upon the moss,<br>    And dimmed his armor bright.<br> <br> Sir Dagonet bent low and gazed<br>    In eyes that knew him not;<br> Then, weeping, to his heart he raised<br>    The head of Lancelot.<br> <br>     .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .<br> <br> Past midnight, when the moon was set,<br>    And utter dark the night,<br> Round Lancelot and Dagonet<br>    There shone a sudden light.<br> <br> And in the light, soft-footing, came<br>    Four maidens grave and pale;<br> In lifted hands that burned like flame,<br>    One bore the Holy Grail.<br> <br> Unveiled the Holy Chalice gleamed;<br>    Sweet odors filled the air;<br> The roadside cross an altar seemed,<br>    The winds were chant and prayer.<br> <br> The dwarf knelt low in that blest place,<br>    Adored, and trembled not;<br> Then, with swift sorrow on his face,<br>    He turned to Lancelot.<br> <br> He cried: "My lord, awake and see!<br>    Methinks thy quest is done!<br> The Holy Grail doth shine on thee<br>    More bright than moon or sun!"<br> <br> Sir Lancelot groaned, but spake no word;<br>    He had nor voice, nor will;<br> Perchance the heavy eyelids stirred<br>    One moment, and were still.<br> <br> Swift as it came the vision went;<br>    The dwarf moaned bitterly:<br> "My answered prayer is punishment<br>    Since my lord might not see!"<br> <br> He groped to find where the cross stood,<br>    There was no ray of light;<br> He prayed: "Thou to the fool art good,<br>    Be gracious to the knight."<br> <br> He cried and prayed beneath the cross,<br>    With foolish words and wild;<br> But Lancelot upon the moss<br>    Slept like a little child.<br> <br> And in the dawning of the day<br>    The dwarf forgot to weep,<br> Seeing how fair Sir Lancelot lay,<br>    A-smiling in his sleep.<br> <br> Sir Dagonet fell on his knee;<br>    He fingered head and limb;<br> And said: "The Grail was shown to me,<br>    Its healing was for him.<br> <br> "He will awaken whole and strong<br>    As ever he hath been;<br> He need not know his trance was long,<br>    Nor what the fool hath seen."<br> <br> He sprang to horse: "Farewell, Sir Knight,<br>    Thy high vow shall not fail;<br> Some happier day thou shalt alight<br>    Upon the Holy Grail."<br> <br> When birds from sky and tree and ground<br>    Sang loud and broke his rest,<br> Sir Lancelot rose blithe and sound<br>    To fare upon his quest.<br> <br> But fast while morning hours were cool,<br>    And slow when noon waxed hot,<br> Sir Dagonet, King Arthur's fool,<br>    Rode back to Camelot.<br> <br> At Camelot, with boisterous cries,<br>    Men asked him of his quest,<br> Till something in the rider's eyes<br>    Silenced the merry jest.<br> <br> Sir Dagonet dwelt with the court;<br>    He mused on what had been;<br> By night he made them goodly sport;<br>    By day he served the Queen.<br> <br>     .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .<br> <br> One slow, still morn of summer's prime,<br>    Through fields of yellow grain,<br> With saddened brow, before his time,<br>    Rode back the good Gawain.<br> <br> But when the long nights of the year<br>    Darkened, and word came not,<br> Sir Dagonet and Guinevere<br>    Prayed for Sir Lancelot.<br> <br>     .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .<br> <br> Like swallows when winds first blow sweet,<br>    The knights came one by one;<br> Each told of travail and defeat,<br>    And how his quest was done.<br> <br> Till, when the third bright June befell,<br>    And nightingales were glad,<br> From out the east came Bors to tell<br>    Of young Sir Galahad,<br> <br> How won was the most Holy Quest:<br>    How Percivale and he<br> Were laid 'neath sacred earth to rest<br>    In Sarras over sea.<br> <br> For Galahad brave eyes were wet,<br>    And gentle Percivale;<br> None ever heard how Dagonet<br>    Achieved the Holy Grail.<br>
