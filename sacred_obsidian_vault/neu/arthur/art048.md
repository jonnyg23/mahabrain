You must follow!<br>    And our path is o'er myriads of graves."<br> <br> Then I felt that the black earth was porous<br>    And rotten with dust and with bones;<br> And I knew that the ground that now bore us<br>    Was cadaverous with death as with stones;<br> And I saw burning eyes, heard sonorous<br>    And dolorous sighings and groans.<br> <br> But the night of the tempest and thunder,<br>    The might of the terrible skies,<br> And the fire of Hell, that,--coiled under<br>    The hollow Earth,--smoulders and sighs,<br> And the laughter of stars and their wonder,<br>    Mingled and mixed in her eyes.<br> <br> And we clomb--and the moon, old and sterile,<br>    Clomb with us o'er torrent and scar:<br> And I yearned for her oceans of beryl,<br>    Wan mountains and cities of spar:<br> "'Tis not well," then she said;  "you're in peril<br>    Of falling and failing your star."<br> <br> And we clomb--through a murmur of pinions,<br>    And rattle of talons and plumes;<br> And a sense as of darkest dominions,<br>    Deep, lost, of the dead and their tombs,<br> Swam round us, with all of their minions<br>    Of dreads and of dreams and of dooms.<br> <br> And we clomb--till we stood at the portal<br>    Of the uttermost point of the peak;<br> And she led, with a step more than mortal,<br>    On, upward, where glimmered a streak,<br> A star, a presence immortal,<br>    A planet, whose light was still weak.<br> <br> And we clomb--till the limbo of spirits<br>    Of lusts and of sorrows below<br> Swung nebular;  and we were near its<br>    Starred summit, its glory of glow.<br> And we entered its light and could hear its<br>    White music of silence and snow.<br>
