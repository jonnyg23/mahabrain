Seat thee there, my heart, beneath<br>  Those liberal golden showers, which Spring suspends,<br>   Laburnum's bloom, close by the garden gate.<br>  And with that glory we have purple, too--<br>  The lilac hedge--indisputable gleams<br>  Of Love it brings to us:  soft, fragrant airs,<br>  Creep from the verdant covert--ah, that breath!--<br>  The perfume of the violet of the shade<br>  Which blesses hearts to whom it nothing owes--<br>  It gives us memories lingering of true-love.<br>  <br>  --Yea, here, not otherwhere, I am your bard,<br>  Your scald, your troubadour:  for this our tale<br>  Requires free air--such air as ever breathed<br>  The valiant, loving, master-knights of old.<br>  We shall have music, too, above, around--<br>  The lavrock rains it from the blue; yon larch<br>  Is vocal with the thrush.<br>  <br>                                   We may believe<br>  In full accord each listening heart shall beat<br>  With each event in field or bowers, for we <br>  Are of the lineage we sing.***<br>                                 But, hark,--<br>  Queen of my song!  Think of our happy years,<br>  And take my verse as of their happy growth<br>  A genial portion, for as well as wars,<br>  Of Love I sing:  and let the cynic girl,<br>  And laughing casuist boy, on either side<br>  Sit by thee in a truce of poësy.<br>  Our other friends of grace and older days,<br>  May listen as they choose amongst the trees.<br>  Friends are for judgment, Esther.

These, the words:--<br>  "His hours of life are mingled gold and gloom, <br>  "But hours of gloom o'ercome by golden hours,<br>  "With better speed than fortunes other knights.<br>  "The hours' conclusion--sudden--it may come<br>  "Only from hands o'erburdened with the grace<br>  "And largess of his love:  whene'er the time<br>  "A loyal and affectionate spear shall slake<br>  "Within his heart, thirst for his foeman's blood."<br>  As brave as Launcelot, lacking half his blame,<br>  Heart-noble as the King, without the taint<br>  Which clings to power, he suffered, strove, and shone<br>  The clearest Light of Honour to his times,<br>  And Knight of Love--of Arthur's martial Ring<br>  The Light of Honour, and the Knight of Love.<br>  <center><br> *******</center> <br>  Yet, now he lies within Ierne's bowers <br>  For heal of hurt--ah, yet to find more hurt,<br>  As his more bliss, than comes from spear, or sword,<br>  Or leech with magic herbs.  Strange, errant life<br>  His heretofore.  Or ere of youth its rose<br>  Blanched on his cheeks, his father's second bride,<br>  Whose love towards Tristram was a love sharp-set<br>  To find her sons of birthright dispossessed<br>  By a forerunner pleasing to all hearts,<br>  Twice poisoned she the chalice with intent<br>  On Tristram's life,--whereby, she woke the furies.<br>  Her fairest son, her eldest born, athirst<br>  Partook the drink and languished on her knee<br>  Till death in mercy stilled his pain:  the king,<br>  Had drunk the second, but her conscience moved<br>  Seized the envenomed cup and spake her guilt:<br>  Whereon, she doomed to expiate by fire<br>  The crime of that device, --but saved from thence,<br>  'Twas famed through Lyonesse, his native realm,<br>  In garnished story and domestic song<br>  How Tristram gained a pardon for the queen--<br>  Made her, save twain, his truest fere in life.<br>  That same year, Tristram crossed to France; learned there<br>  All curious arts of sport, for which renown<br>  Through many a century at the jocund feast,<br>  And hot carouse which crowns the hunting day, <br>  Rang loud for him.  Moreover, thence he brought<br>  Rarest of cunning on the harp.  'Tis told,<br>  No mortal ever could withstand the strain!<br>  That bird and beast, yea, fish within the lake<br>  Were charmed on hearing.  Tuneful as benign,<br>  He was a wondrous harper:  known full soon<br>  Through Britain's island precincts, for the youth<br>  As in his knightly prime, wide-wandering sought<br>  Adventurous exploit.  But chiefly this,<br>  Marked his long alien residence; with growth<br>  Of hardihood there was a growth of soul:<br>  With aptitude and clemency in arms,<br>  There was repose of aspect and a low<br>  Affectionate tenderness of voice, which drew<br>  This fair memorial of him:  "Each estate<br>  Did love him wheresoever he did go."<br>  <br>  Returned to Lyonesse, on Tristram came<br>  A change of spirit:  better say, were changed<br>  Its hope and object.  Looking on his life<br>  Amidst the mirth and courtliness of France<br>  Restless, unsatisfied, remorseful, he<br>  As wakening from a futile March-day's dream<br>  Yearned for the full-orbed blazon of a knight.<br>  Hence, grew his story:  hence, his name in song<br>  His fame, as lord of honour:  as the peer,<br>  Peerless in honour and the parleying heart.<br>  First Lyonesse to feel his passion's power<br>  By spear and song--wherein, betimes, were won<br>  Such reverence of his might, such awe, such love,<br>  The kingdom in its peace through all his days<br>  Slept, wotting that his harp still sang, his lance<br>  Was ever-ready. That emprise now closed,<br>  He, at his father's solitary court,<br>  Bemoaned the slowly creeping, vacant months<br>  As Honour lost, because not newly won:<br>  Ill shown in dull despair.<br>  <br>                                      Now, reached him news<br>  From Cornwall's bounds:  its royal head, king Mark,<br>  His father's brother, a slight, suspicious man<br>  One who would give offence for love of harm,<br>  And find offence housed in a kindly deed,<br>  Whose crown was trembling ever in the storm<br>  Of foes once named as friends, one friendship lost,<br>  Born in the honest flowering time of youth.<br>  Ungracious, slanderous, and a viper act,<br>  Which stung and menaced in his scorn that friend<br>  Anguis, imperial head of Ireland's realm,<br>  From Castlehaven, throughout her breadth of green<br>  To Giant's Causeway:  whence retributive,<br>  Before Tintagel's gate now stood the knight<br>  Sir Marhaus, next in fame to him who stood<br>  Chiefest, Sir Launcelot, of the Table Round.<br>  There, in his rocky keep, his royal home,<br>  Tintagel, Mark was kept as is a dog<br>  Kept to his kennel by the keeper's thong.<br>  More than his idle graceless time mourns now<br>  Young Tristram--as at Honour's death.  Spake then,<br>  To save him from himself, with coyest words<br>  The step-dame queen.  In subtle playfulness<br>  She bade him see that Honour was with him<br>  As Love with knights of fame, and honour-sick<br>  None other cure could come save on that field,--<br>  Whence Honour might arise, when heard the call<br>  Of one strong heart--the stricken Cornish realm.<br>  So said, so heard, so done with quickest speed<br>  That thence three days Tintagel knew the youth,<br>  Tristram.<br>  <br>               He, brought within its audience hall,<br>  Beheld a shape--low-statured, quivering, thin,<br>  Bedecked with mis-shaped yellow weeds and crowned.<br>  "The court fool!" thought he:  but he heard it named--<br>  The king.  And that was Mark.  Well might surprise<br>  O'ercome the court as in the silence breathed<br>  Expectancy, beholding there these twain<br>  Contrasted, met by love's election, bound<br>  To weave the sweetest, mournfullest, most strange<br>  Of all love's histories:  that eager, young,<br>  Bright son of valour and of song:  and he<br>  Their stunted king, whose age a wrinkled skin,<br>  Dry, brown as parchments of a ducal house,<br>  Concealed, but in whose deep-set slinking eyes<br>  A heart of fraud lay clear.<br>  <br>                                           On his first watch,<br>  Ensconced within the fosse, the prince beheld<br>  Sir Marhaus ride up from the beach, a god<br>  A very god of battle and of doom<br>  Resplendent in the early sun--and life<br>  Went from his spirit, and he dwelt apart<br>  One abject week.  But dawn of Pentecost<br>  Brought grace of strength in heart, and Tristram bore<br>  The menace of the warrior peaceably.<br>  Next day, defiance:  and the youth implored<br>  Mark make him knight.  Then Mark, amidst his court<br>  Fools in their craven laughter, drew his brand<br>  Muttering--"Shall impotence attend the act?<br>  "Our chapel all devoid of holy rites<br>  "In this extremity, we lack the priest<br>  "For sacrament--Nay, the anointed King<br>  "Suffices!"  Tristram knew a feeble blow<br>  From scathless blade, the consecrating words<br>  With fluttered accents "In the name of God,<br>  "And His archangel, Michael, and His hosts<br>  "Militant, we do dub thee Knight.  Arise!--<br>  "Thus, nephew, hath the valiance of thy tongue<br>  "Brought honour towards thee--but its darling home<br>  "Is in the dangerous quest.  Now, show how keen<br>  "My spur to worthy deed.  Sir Marhaus calls.<br>  "Answer be thine:  and honour in thee show<br>  "Clear, double-edged, twin to thy sword."  Upsprang,<br>  The youth responsive, "By the Evangelists!<br>  "Sir Tristram now is born," with rising voice<br>  Hailing thus soon his quest.  "O, ladies bright,<br>  "Sweet proxies of the beauteous sisterhood<br>  "Irradiating the soul of this dark world<br>  "Refining, cleansing, cheering powers:  pray, learn<br>  "These first words of my knighthood:  hear the scope<br>  "Of its intent.  Know well, ye ladies bright,<br>  "My way in life, shall take your smiles for flowers:<br>  "My way in life, for stars shall seek your eyes;<br>  "The ladies are my charge, and with the law<br>  "And order of the state make up my being.<br>  "My way in life, is towards the Table Round."<br>  <br>  Next morning, saw great Marhaus driven to ship,<br>  Discomfited and wounded unto death.<br>  So soon--for which high festival was held<br>  By Mark--so soon, Sir Tristram's life arrayed <br>  With smiles more sweet than flowers, and moved beneath<br>  A heaven of ladies' eyes more bright than stars,<br>  And felt years nearer to the Table Round.<br>  <br>  But toils, and woes, and wounds are knighthood's price,<br>  And Tristram reckoning with his foeman's lance<br>  Deep hurt received beyond the leech's cure.<br>  One, then, of astral lore, enquiring whence<br>  The knight whose skill bestowed the dolorous wound<br>  And answered Ireland--"Unto Ireland speed,<br>  "The healing power awaits thee there."  Where come,<br>  The knight, as in Love's providence, was lodged<br>  Close by the castle--now the mourning days<br>  For Marhaus ended--where King Anguis held<br>  Free-hearted, courtly state--since heard a voice<br>  That soon an errant, knightly spear of worth<br>  Should fill the vacant quest for Ireland's weal.<br>  <br>  <center>*****</center> <br>  <br>  One mist-clad, breathless noon, as was his wont,<br>  To allay the fierceness of his pain and win<br>  A new and pleasant voyage for his thoughts,<br>  He harped upon his bed.  His memory strayed <br>  O'er blissful times bygone:  insensibly,<br>  As half in dream he lay, his hand awoke<br>  A strain once sung in France:  a strain whereon<br>  Birds, brooklets, leaves and sudden showers would sing<br>  And every heart in hearing would be merry.<br>  Too great its charm for Amicie of Gand; <br>  The minstrel passing with a love unsworn,<br>  Reft of his comforting melody she kept<br>  Her bower and sorrowed to her death.<br>  <br>                                                           That lay,<br>  Harped Tristram now, and as he harped the dusk<br>  Slid from the face of the high jubilant noon.<br>  Commingling noises grew i' th' air, from streams,<br>  Near winged choirs, the tremulous woods and reeds.<br>  The chambers of his lodge brake into laughter.<br>  Up to the castle rose the magical strain,<br>  Swept round its walls, assailed its ports and towers,<br>  Where found one cedarn casement garlanded<br>  With odorous flowers tangled in sprays of green<br>  Wide open to receive the new-born joy,<br>  Entering, it passed through galleries, chambers, halls,<br>  Caught kitchen churls, peers, matrons dull of sprite--<br>  And lo, from forth yon ivied postern steps<br>  The fairest star of maidenhood on earth!<br>  In azure robes; a golden girdle binds<br>  Their fullness close beneath the bosom's rise:<br>  Her tresses, snooded with rare blooms of spring,<br>  Inwardly darkle, as our richest thoughts<br>  Within the soul wanting fit words for day--<br>  Towards the sun, stirring with a shining life<br>  Each several hair--like fine thoughts finding voice<br>  For conquest of the world and praise--such they<br>  To sight of men, these tresses which must shew<br>  The inner nature of her sensitive being.<br>  So comes she, gliding with soft musical grace,<br>  Her countenance as a dawn of early May<br>  Which beautifies the world o'er which it smiles.<br>  The drawbridge crossed--she, down the budding lane,<br>  Into his lodge, into his very room,<br>  When to the faded eyes of Tristram shone<br>  A spirit from sweet mercy's heaven, down-drawn<br>  By his great strain to heal--to solace him <br>  Through many changeful years to come.--I wit, <br>  Ye all know who the starry maiden was,--<br>  La Belle Isonde!<br>  <br>                              The spirit gazed--and fled--<br>  Nor word--nor sign--but soon a helpful band<br>  Of servitors down-speeding from the keep,<br>  Bore him up thither.  There, in chamber cool<br>  Sweetened by every flower and fragrant bush<br>  That in her pleasaunce 'neath her lattice grew,<br>  Isonde was constant in her duteous love,<br>  With divers aids medicinal to bate<br>  His malady.  A gainless task of tears,<br>  Until her mother furnished potent draughts<br>  Educed from shrubs and herbs and mandrake roots<br>  By wizard operation--art, forsooth,<br>  Which mightier ends for both, hereafter, brings.<br>  Thence day by day, his fever ebbed; his eyes<br>  Won their young light again.--O, happy he,<br>  To feel the world grow lovelier morn and even:<br>  Eve sweeter than the morn, the morn more sweet<br>  Than the past eve with all its peace and stars--<br>  And Isonde anxious, passionate and quick<br>  On feeblest sign or sound in this her proud<br>  Triumphant labour of a crescent love.--<br>  O happy Tristram!  Happy Belle Isonde!<br>  <br>  This time, a rumour wandered through the Isle,<br>  Achievements were at hand of dread and death,<br>  Since Palomide, the sable heathen knight<br>  From Upsal's plain, warfarer in his love--<br>  For Belle Isonde drew many subject hearts<br>  From far-off lands to her sea-circled home--<br>  Randing the realm adventurous, on report<br>  Of harbourage of a strange, unproven knight,<br>  Named as the Nameless, now with restless foot<br>  Haunted the castle's purlieus.  Humblest hearts<br>  Can judge of lordliest; simple village maids<br>  Spelled lightly, rightly of the matter's growth<br>  And what should follow:  wedded island folk<br>  Wot wisely, too, these crossing loves would shew<br>  War's blood-red blossoms,<br>  <br>                                               Nor less so it happed.<br>  For one fair dame, the Lady of the Lands,<br>  King Anguis was beholden to let cry<br>  A tournament.  Our maiden Beautiful<br>  Bethought of this, with ample news beguiled<br>  A short spring eve.  But this her story told,<br>  In warlike phrase with silver laughs between,<br>  None answer gave the Nameless, and Isonde<br>  Might not behold beneath the gathering shades <br>  Earnest of fray which gleamed within his eyes<br>  Whilst she had spoken.  Through that wasteful night,<br>  Waking, or dreaming as one half-awake,<br>  Within his ears resounded dash of steeds,<br>  Blasts of the tromp:  before his eyes, the glare<br>  Of lightnings from the shield.  The vacant dark<br>  Shook with accursed taunts, wide flashed the stroke<br>  Of sword blades unaccomplished:  bitter taste<br>  There was of bitterness far worse than death,<br>  Taste of discomfiture most rash, most foul,<br>  And unredeemable.  On him attended<br>  The sprites of horror known of sleepless minds<br>  Which make a tempest of the silent hours.<br>  At earliest dawn with dumb voice cried his soul<br>  And through that day:  "I must acquit myself.<br>  "The shame within me, daughter of disease,<br>  "Not of my nature, may no longer lodge<br>  "Within a heart to honour dedicate<br>  "And love."  Whereon, he gently spake Isonde,<br>  Who light o' heart conspired to prove at full<br>  His growing vigour, as a knight from far,<br>  Mistimed, who seeks the lists with errant spear.<br>  That tourney-day being come:  advanced the jousts;<br>  The court, the vassal-throngs inspired by sight<br>  Of marvellous chevisaunce which made that field<br>  As lustrous in the scroll of chivalry<br>  As famed Caerleon's jousts what time the King<br>  Arthur, achieved his crown against six kings--<br>  Isonde in worship of her nameless lord<br>  Ordained and well-arrayed him all in white<br>  And privily brought him forth.  To churls and court,<br>  'Tis told, he seemed an angel from the skies<br>  Descended on a cause of solemn right.<br>  His face, fresh from the beauty of Isonde,<br>  Shone sunbright through the tourney's dusty air,<br>  Whilst he displayed anew to ruthless fray<br>  The blazon of his shield, first in renown<br>  Henceforth in herald's lore, the argent lion.<br>  Instantly, veered opinion of the day.<br>  As silent as his airy, snow-white plume<br>  Waved o'er his helm, the silence of the throng<br>  Waiting his onset.  Three long wood-wroth hours<br>  The trumpet's urgent call found him to fore,<br>  Rousing the stormy glories of the list.<br>  The keen fang of his spear--his yearning sword--<br>  Made a huge crimson vintage to redeem<br>  His mischance from the stroke of Marhaus:  none,<br>  Prince, baron, peer, whoever couched the lance,<br>  Or lifted brand against him, but o'erthrown<br>  Amidst such wreck of harness as ne'er graced<br>  Cadwor, Geraint, Owaine, those knights elect<br>  For battle, leaders of the Table Round,<br>  Paid homage to his dire puissance, while<br>  Swart Palomide down-beaten was forsword<br>  Of Belle Isonde, unknighted for a year.<br>  The Lady of the Lands, and her demesne<br>  Our knight forewent, again that they should fire<br>  The eagles and the buzzards of the lists.--<br>  So fared the Light of Honour on that day.<br>  <br>  How many months, how many dulcet months--<br>  Nay, curious gentles, ask me not how long<br>  Within the verdant kingdom Tristram held<br>  Bondsman to love:  each jot of knightly will<br>  Meshed in Belle Isonde's wondrous, affluent hair:<br>  His heart intoxicate with joy to note<br>  Her gentle goings.<br>  <br>  <center>*****</center> <br>  <br>                              Then came sudden close.<br>  Secret, imperative, a missive brief<br>  Called on him to depart.  "At once?--and whither?<br>  "And why?" enquired La Belle Isonde, a tear,<br>  The virgin tear of her surpassing love,<br>  Shining within her eye.  'Twas, thereupon,<br>  His name he told--his history--his estate--<br>  And somewhat of his heart--which made Isonde<br>  Tremble as on the forecast of an hour<br>  When love would glorify all ensuing hours.<br>  Thus, farewell on their lips had more than words<br>  For comfort:  words more of the living soul<br>  Than common day-speech:  and with confidence<br>  In love's presiding spirit to bring all good<br>  In near good time, the maiden to her bower,<br>  Tristram before a frolic, singing wind<br>  Sailed to his aim, Tintagel's surge-beat towers.<br>  <br>  That mandate was for service.--This achieved,<br>  Tintagel found a guest much changed from him<br>  Tristram, ere known of reland's court.  Isonde,<br>  Dwelt angel of his spirit everywhere;<br>  Ever upon his lips as in his heart;<br>  Till Mark, infected by his mood and praise,<br>  Longed for the royal maid.  Her knight soul-racked<br>  Held silence, kept apart,--but much too late.<br>  For by great Honour, worship of his soul,<br>  His fealty held a covenant with Mark, whereby<br>  Mark's word became a law unto his soul.<br>  Thus, when Mark spoke his charge, Sir Tristram took<br>  That charge, and loyally sought Ireland's court<br>  To bring the starry maiden thence, Isonde,--<br>  To set her lustre in Mark's clouded throne,<br>  Her light of joy upon his rayless crown.<br>  <br>  Once more, as from the stars, decreed of heaven,<br>  Fortune within misfortune came, now dressed<br>  In war's most dread attire.  Ierne's lands,<br>  Within, without, torn, pillaged by ill friends<br>  Worse than her foes,--tormented now by both--<br>  Through these with prowess, diligence, and skill<br>  Tristram, one long twelve months, that year one war,<br>  Subdued where'er he wandered.  Never still,<br>  That lion-heartedness which made the realm<br>  A threshing-floor for the fury of his spear,<br>  Till foes were whirled from thence as chaff--ill friends<br>  Curbed, chastened, law-bound in the peace--else, smitten<br>  Dead, ta'en of death where most intent on death.<br>  For this the king, the queen, the realm's estates <br>  Welcomed him to their halls with joyous pomp,<br>  Music, and garlands, and triumphant praise<br>  As ne'er before rang through the hearts and homes<br>  Of haughty, laurelled Ireland.  Thus it came,<br>  Our knight-ambassador had gift to mould<br>  His graceless charge into command of grace.<br>  When he must name his boon, he to the king<br>  Full-gazing, calm in aspect, but with voice<br>  Solemn as one renouncing for all years<br>  His best delight,--"From Cornwall have I charge<br>  "To bring thy daughter, that she be its queen."<br>  Grief smote the court.  Belle Isonde's violet eyes--<br>  O, what a heaven of pleading love shone there,<br>  Lovelier, more pitiful, within that shower<br>  Of sacred tears,--spoke to his heart,--but he<br>  Full meekly left the hall.<br>  <br>                                           Whilst king and maid<br>  Fulfilled their sudden woe with weeping sobs<br>  And piteous choking words, around them stole<br>  A breeze of golden sounds--the harp's most high<br>  Immutable language, gentliest tones and strong<br>  To turn the mind from all its dear resolves,<br>  To win from every mood, to every mood,<br>  From smiles to sighs, from mourning unto festal<br>  Merriment.  They were soothed, went forth and reached<br>  A myrtle shade, wherein their knight-guest harped;<br>  And ere the lustrous moon which shone that night<br>  Shed half her silver fire within the dark<br>  Sir Tristram sailed the sea; La Belle Isonde<br>  His charge with nuptial gifts, herself the gift<br>  Beyond the price of gifts, for Cornwall bound.<br>  <br>  Of all the marvels told in prose or song<br>  Of what there happed in Pendragonian times,<br>  Of things mysterious, loving--now appears<br>  That most mysterious, loving, absolute.<br>  The queen, sweet mother of La Belle Isonde,<br>  Disquiet for her daughter's weal, in hours<br>  Secret, when natal stars benignant reigned,<br>  Brewed her a drink which held and amorous charm,<br>  And thus to Isonde's gentlewoman spake:--<br>  "Brengwain, give heed, that blessings close thy care.<br>  "See on the bridal-eve that Cornwall's king<br>  "Partake of this quick draught with our Isonde.<br>  "Therewith, be sure, a love shall grow between<br>  "As never known in any royal house.<br>  "Be wary and be prompt!"<br>  <br>                                              The vessel driven,<br>  Storm-caught by night, leagues to the south below<br>  Tintagel, shelters in these flowery isles<br>  Which front the rocky, bare, wave-smitten end<br>  Of Cornwall:  and to Tristram's glad surprise<br>  In eye-shot of his native Lyonesse,<br>  Since drawn beneath the ocean waves, its towers,<br>  Fields, palaces, and wealth of mighty life,<br>  Where then his name lived as a guardian spell.<br>  <br>  <center>******</center> <br>  <br>  Of sullen brightness, noon, o'erdrowsing all,<br>  As by some sultry toils o'erborne, when he<br>  In fretful humour with these sterile hours<br>  Made speed below--a dolorous haste, to find<br>  The destiny of darkness in the sun--<br>  Searching for cheer.  There, Brengwain's cabin door,<br>  Which to and fro swung sleepily, provoked<br>  His questing eye--but ere his outstretched hand<br>  Could reach it, well, too well, he was aware<br>  Half-hidden in a store of silken gifts<br>  There lay a golden flasket.  Passing in,<br>  Drawn by the shining object, sense and spirit<br>  Were captive.  Carven curiously around,<br>  Beneath, above, the flasket's gold with mystic,<br>  Woven, unintelligible signs, which seemed<br>  Of power and beauty mingled--such as lie<br>  Within the stellar houses, that a man<br>  Unquestioning of astral force is won<br>  To observation, with a dread surmise<br>  Destiny operates in their moving lights:<br>  As lie in flowers, from stigma unto leaf<br>  In form and colour,--so that we exclaim<br>  "O, lovely flower!" all unaware, true joy,--<br>  Of magic resident, the soft mute spell<br>  Kindling the soul,--for science none of man,<br>  May separate the beauty from the signs.<br>  This carven, golden flasket Tristram brought<br>  To Belle Isonde, whose vision strayed from isle<br>  To isle, last rested on the foamless deep.<br>  "Methinks, the best of cheer our servants hold.<br>  "This flasket, sure, has bounteous nourishment<br>  "Worthy its glistering shell," said Tristram.  "I,<br>  "Found it in hiding under Brengwain's care."<br>  Isonde turned from the sea, to find her sight<br>  Caught by the flasket, as though she would read,<br>  Yet failed to read or guess, the hieroglyphs<br>  Wreathed everywhere throughout the carven gold.<br>  "Oft have you urged me to demand a boon--<br>  "And since that much," continued he:  "nay all,<br>  "Of my poor heart shall part for ever from me<br>  "When we shall part; one hour I would remember,<br>  "Last shining rubric in our passing love--<br>  "To other hours as diamond is to sand--<br>  "One radiant hour, when you vouchsafed my boon--<br>  "Let me partake this well-kept draught with thee."<br>  To this Isonde, with moise uplifted eyes,<br>  Wherein the light of love obscurely shone,--<br>  "Yea, be it so, with all this heart of mine<br>  "Which goes with thee whenever thou shalt go."<br>  He oped the carven flasket and poured forth,<br>  With gentle hand, the treasured wine, which gleamed<br>  Golden and danced--a brisk, bright life was in it<br>  To hold the sight and woo the taste.  They pledged.<br>  The pleasing trouble working in the wine<br>  Worked swiftly in each heart.  Their pledge had been<br>  Of that love-drink designed, as you have heard,<br>  By Ireland's queen.<br>  <br>                              The hair of Belle Isonde,<br>  Moved over her a moving haze of gold:<br>  Upon the midnight of her sorrowing soul,<br>  So spake her eyes, love's day-star brightly rose,<br>  And Tristram saw her beauty, heard her voice,<br>  As, ere now, he had never heard or seen.<br>  He gave the kiss of Rimini--she received--<br>  And love between them, there was evermore.<br>  <br>  Unto these twain, in spirit and in sense,<br>  As day is fulfilled of the sun, as night<br>  Is fulfilled of the stars, and spring is fulfilled<br>  Of the primrose and lark, the summer fulfilled<br>  Of the rose--so their love with all of beauty<br>  Of passion and all of pleasure was full<br>  Filled by this mystical flasket of wine,<br>  This golden, and carven, and mystical<br>  Flasket of wine.<br>  <br>                            Here, as one liege to Love,<br>  I ask the favour of all lovers' thoughts,<br>  I ask the favour of all lovers' shades,<br>  The magic, not the sin, as hath been named,<br>  Known by Francesca from Sir Launcelot's kiss,<br>  I call upon it and the poet's heart<br>  Which made it music:  on that name not less,<br>  Poet and lover, whose one word of song<br>  Was Laura--any soul of love reply,<br>  And absolution for this hour is given<br>  Ample as ocean, certain as its tide.<br>  <br>  But never yet mere summer-sport was love.<br>  Proportionate sacrifice it shall exact <br>  For every sprinkling of its meed of grace.<br>  Even as they dallied with love's aloe bloom<br>  The south wind stirred.  When, promptly, Tristram's voice<br>  Commands the sea-browned mariners hoist sail,<br>  Which answering, as with inborn will, the ship<br>  Speeds from those flowery isles to reach their home<br>  Tintagel.  Forth, from paradise of love,<br>  With sharpest speed to sorrow.  Known next morn,<br>  Stranded beneath Dunrabin's rocky hold:<br>  A nest of ruffians with more ruffian lord<br>  Whose mirth was misrule, one elect of evil,<br>  Known as they hound and drew to dungeons deep<br>  This company late frolic o'er bright seas<br>  Sailing to greet their welcome; nor released<br>  Until the guardian-knight evinced his force,<br>  His passion, and his faith, in divers broils<br>  For pleasure of that miscreant chief--pleased first,<br>  But better pleased, anon, to yield a free<br>  Acquittance through a horror of that sword,<br>  That spear, which flamed before him night and day<br>  Slaying his peace, awakening memories<br>  Of murderous years for reckoning ere death's coast <br>  In view.<br>  <br>               With gladness from the keep they went.<br>  But whither?  Deep in trackless, unkenned ways,<br>  The constant light to which the sphered harp<br>  Of Arthur sings, highest in heaven, sole guide<br>  On all their march--awaited many an eve<br>  For safe direction.  Strangely thus they fared<br>  Three fell, bewildered weeks:  Tristram ordained<br>  Each breaking morn, or bright or dim, to break<br>  Upon some high adventure, so his love<br>  Should bear the harrying stress of years of dole,<br>  Before he gave his star into the dark<br>  Of other keeping.  Fortune then or helped <br>  Or marred, by leading them to friendly paths,<br>  Whereof, King Mark apprised, in hast despatched<br>  Barons and squires, for dignity and pomp<br>  Of chivalry, and to regale their spirits<br>  A minstrel troop approved by voice and lute.<br>  These brought unto Tintagel's rest the twain,<br>  With such a pageantry of arms, such storm<br>  Of musical merriment as its hoary walls<br>  Never afore had wot of.--Five long days,<br>  Horns in the forest, lances in the joust<br>  Gave brave delight throughout the sunshine hours:<br>  At eventime, beneath the summer's heaven,<br>  Soft-stringed instruments with varying song<br>  Made ravishing cheer:  and ere the ancient hold<br>  Lost feeling of its younger years, King Mark<br>  Was richly wedded with all nobleness<br>  To Tristram's love, Isonde.<br>  <br>  <center>*****</center> <br>  <br>  But high emprise and Tristram form one name.<br>  Behold at eve, a sombre eve, sad child<br>  Of golden day, before the gate there stands<br>  None other than the paynim Palomide.<br>  Love, or in heathen or in Christian breast,<br>  Works the same bale or bliss.  He, hither drawn<br>  Because Love will not have it otherwise.<br>  Had Belle Isonde been hidden deep within<br>  Matted recesses of the Mercian woods:<br>  Or, midst the fens of Sessoin been immured:<br>  Or, lodged within Avilion's cypress bowers:<br>  There, had this Palomide this instant been<br>  And not before Tintagel's gate.  Urbane,<br>  Obsequious, captivating sight and ear<br>  The castle's latest comer:  framed by Love<br>  For all Love's needs, its pleasure or its end.<br>  Boastful and threatening, one of bloody will,<br>  When thought Isonde might like enough be wooed<br>  By force, or pride in force, which she inspired;<br>  He now shows tender, odorous, subtle-breathed<br>  As breeze which creeps along a hawthorn lane<br>  In white mid-May:  a very lady's page<br>  For low obedience in her flowery pleasaunce,<br>  Or in the chase, or in the jocund hall--<br>  Wherein lie waiting birth, new labours sore<br>  For Tristram, and a warp in life.<br>  <br>                                                     Till Yule,<br>  Till Passion-tide, here rested Palomide.<br>  Nor wist then Mark, the paynim yet should part,<br>  Since now it was his kingdom's beauteous time,<br>  Which kept the guest and drew from neighbour-realms<br>  Knights errant, pilgrims, minstrels, gallant throngs<br>  From courts and halls; when spring with cope of blue,<br>  Spring with its voice of music, and its coat<br>  Of many colours, told to earth once more<br>  Gone was another winter's silver strength<br>  Except for memory's keeping.--Then, arose<br>  Sounds of dismay amidst Tintagel's bowers.<br>  Brengwain was fled:  nor had the general cry<br>  Abated, till obsequious Palomide,<br>  On promised boon, in seven days brought the maid<br>  For Cornwall's queen.<br>  <br>                                      Boon chosen at twilight time,<br>  Rich with the breath of pansy and young leaves<br>  Dew-drenched.  That time, Upsala's knight of craft<br>  Beneath Belle Isonde's balcon then required<br>  Her promised favour.--Later, in the shades<br>  Walking the inner court, Sir Tristram saw<br>  One broad high lattice open, thereby knew<br>  His fond bird's cage unclosed.  Rejoiced in heart,<br>  Wotting his love awaited sweet "Good night!"<br>  He blithely sang, for whisper of "Good night."<br>  No answer:  not a chirp:  he climbed to find<br>  No bird--no bird--and yet the oaken door<br>  Thrice-barred within.  What o' the bird?  No guess--<br>  It has been snared.<br>  <br>                              Grievous were it to learn<br>  This new wayfaring, and its labour sore.<br>  The queen was gone, as wrapped into the dark<br>  By darksome powers:  and Palomide and squire<br>  Gone,--lost as shades within the shadow of night.<br>  Manifold terrors haunted Tristram's quest:<br>  The wolf, the wild-worm, dwellers of the waste,<br>  On open ways, and lurking in the brake<br>  Bandits and heathen swords.  That haggard search<br>  Compassed a life of warlike hardihood: <br>  For his great anguish was a constant spur<br>  Which took rest from him at the golden noon,<br>  Whilst midnight lacked in him her sleepy dues.<br>  Belle Isonde's knight pursued them with the sense <br>  Of passion feverously vigilant,<br>  Which keeps the trail once found.  He overtook<br>  Palomide, near a willow-shaded fount<br>  Reposing:  challenged him to horse--and drave<br>  So vehemently, Mark's treasonous guest o'erwhelmed,<br>  Swooned from the saddle.<br>  <br>                                    &amp;nbsp      This the day far-famed,<br>  Tristram bade Palomide pronounce himself:<br>  When first this Palomide, with eye on death,<br>  Avowed untroubled by its fear, the source<br>  And venture of his heart's regard.  "By Thor!<br>  "Thy spear persuades.  Nay, Knight, withdraw thy point;<br>  "I falter not.  I, of the Aser line:<br>  "But with report in Odin's iron land<br>  "Of one whose beauty known as of the sun,<br>  "To whom as frosted lights all other maids,<br>  "Upon myself I took this quest of love.<br>  "Hence, Ireland found me.  Hence, found I your queen,<br>  "Whose look inspires more than the sacred mead<br>  "Our pontiff-chief, 'neath Upsal's dome of gold,<br>  "Dispenses at the wreathed shrine when she<br>  "Iduna, mother of your laughing Spring,<br>  "Restorer of the flowers of youth to mortals<br>  "And to the gods, claims every heart to drink<br>  "Life's joy and hope.  It was Iduna's month<br>  "I raught your queen.  To perish in my love,<br>  "Far sweeter than upright amid the slain<br>  "The battle-virgins' favour mine.  Nay, strike!<br>  "Strike!--And the pearl-roofed mansion of our skies,<br>  "Wide-shining Breidalblick, receives new guest<br>  "For Balder to console."  With woe at heart,<br>  Fresh knight of worth, had life within him slain<br>  By hapless love, Sir Tristram led her back<br>  Unscarred, unstained, through many a perilous way,<br>  His queen to weak and wily Mark.<br>  <br>                                                        Then love<br>  Took pity on the Lion Knight, his wounds,<br>  His woeful enterprise, that inward fire<br>  Consuming, to behold his Beautiful,<br>  Bride of his heart, bride Beautiful of him <br>  Who masked all meanness with a kingly name.<br>  Mysterious Love, working through fortunes ill<br>  Bestowed its own soft truce, drew him afar<br>  In peaceful sequestration.  Honour's wound,--<br>  A rueful gash and from a venomed blade<br>  Earned in his recent quest--rejecting cure<br>  From potent simples, needs he must repair<br>  Forthright to Howell's court in Brittanie,<br>  Whose daughter in the science of the leech<br>  Bore high repute--but ah, she bore for him<br>  Enchantment in the music of her name,<br>  Which was none other than his queen's--Isonde--<br>  King Howell's daughter--named of the Lily Hands.<br>  <br>  <center>******</center> <br>  Ah, how with Tristram, whose great passionate heart<br>  Here finds the vital word of his best life,<br>  Isonde, clothed with such loveliness, the maid<br>  Might be twin-sister to his Beautiful?<br>  Ah, this, Love's ordination, soon surmised.<br>  What with her delicate charms, whose influence worked <br>  Confederate with the beauty of his queen:<br>  Gifted devotion through his venomous ill,<br>  And that her name gave to his heart of love<br>  Presence and power; and her observance meek,<br>  Yet quick, varying in mood with varying need<br>  Throughout his long recovering hours--these all<br>  Blending their sway, co-operating, brought<br>  Tardy acknowledgment from grateful gaze<br>  To language; thence to reason's deeds.  The maid<br>  Became his virgin spouse.<br>  <br>                                        Leavened by his will<br>  She sowed life's graces throughout Brittanie.<br>  Rich in the knight she loved, thence came her boon<br>  Of sunniest years--most joyous, placid years--<br>  Most bright and placid known to Tristram yet.<br>  And, it may be, that their deep peacefulness<br>  Obtained security from tearful prayers<br>  La Belle Isonde sent to her lowering heaven,<br>  When told of Tristram's nuptials.  Lorn, but true,<br>  Knowing his love for her, she prayed for him<br>  And his fair consort:  did not set her heart <br>  Against him, but at evensong and prime<br>  Prayed that his heart be hardly 'gainst her set,<br>  And that a new love, wider, holier love,<br>  Enrich him with its tokens most divine.<br>  These prayers and tears might have reward to keep<br>  The distant wedded twain as under charge<br>  Angelic:  albeit, tears and prayers of her<br>  To whom their answer had undone her more<br>  Than aught beside--plagued, darkened all her hours,<br>  Drained life, and ta'en the light of hope from death.<br>  <br>  <br>  <center>CHAPTER II.</center> <br>  <br>  <br>  Heavily leaning upon Brengwain's arm,<br>  La Belle Isonde steps gently towards the grove,<br>  Her fairest pleasaunce, a most inward grove,<br>  Her noontide haunt:  behind a lilac bush<br>  Hears rustling garments, noise of flying feet,<br>  And walking round beholds two maids, one churl,<br>  In flight for private entrance to the keep.<br>  Curious, half-roused from out her trance-like mood,<br>  She vainly asks the purpose of that flight:<br>  Then loiters dreamful in the winding paths,<br>  Her eyes in search amidst the border-flowers<br>  For something lost.  "Dull and despoiled these walks,<br>  "Sweet Brengwain," murmurs she, pale queen.  "All's changed<br>  "Since heart's-ease died.  Would evening's hour were come,<br>  "Then we might hear our nightingale.  An yet,<br>  "Our nightingale, methinks, has lost his note<br>  "These many weeks.  All's dead-dull now.  Our blooms<br>  "Were brighter upon Michelmas, of yore--<br>  "But, then, all were together.  Didst thou say,<br>  "That upon noon may come an instant night?"<br>  --"No, no."--On this they reached a shrivelled shape<br>  Lain on the grass:  a creature ragged, sick<br>  Unto the very death; found seven days since<br>  At break of morn by Severn's hermit saint.<br>  Thence to Tintagel brought for friendly care--<br>  And here at noon laid in the sun whose beam,<br>  Perchance, may stir the tides of life anew.<br>  The queen's hand tightened on her maiden's arm,<br>  Regarding him as one with winter-thoughts<br>  Regards the ruin of the summer's green<br>  No more returning:  upon her he looked,<br>  A mystic knowledge gleaming in his eyes,<br>  As they beheld a something more than seen<br>  By earthly vision--wondrous, unspeakable.<br>  Confused in spirit, unsatisfied, the queen<br>  Drew back, and in a winter-wailing tone,--<br>  "Methinks, that form a-many weeks has drunk<br>  "Of sorrow like to mine, and some fair dame<br>  "Saddens upon his absence.  Let us go."<br>  Yet sought she not her inward grove, but strayed<br>  Forlorn, with earthward searching look:  then paused:<br>  Cried in a voice of pain.  "That bunch of leaves--<br>  "Those withered leaves--beneath yon thorn--think you,<br>  "Were once my once-dear flower?--Sweet Brengwain, say,<br>  "Now being apart, and here no listening walls,<br>  "When Tristram back from Brittanie, was't one<br>  "Or two his fellows, played upon my pride<br>  "And drave him to the woods?"--"Sir Palomide,<br>  "Sir Kay, two men, but one in evil mind."--<br>  "Ay, ay!  And they would woo, and I would win<br>  "In fancy, having lost so much in life<br>  "Wearing the name of queen.  But, they be gone?--"<br>  "In truth, Sir Tristram gone, for them to stay<br>  "Had been perdition unto court and king,<br>  "So fierce thy spirit"--"Well!  Ah, but not well--<br>  "For him my sun, and I thus desolate.<br>  "So weak, too, from these suffering, palsying months.<br>  "Fever and pain their tabernacle long<br>  "Have made this quivering frame--Thou, surely, sweet,<br>  "Hast seen our knightly star of late--or wast<br>  "In dream I learned of it?"--"Yea, but in dream.  <br>  "Yet, guided as by dream, I found his haunt,<br>  "A forest, guarded by an iron keep,<br>  "Where, two years gone, the heathen Palomide,<br>  "For gain of thee, foughten his angriest fight<br>  "With Tristram; who, that victory won, his rest<br>  "Took with the castle's dame.  He, as he healed,<br>  "Taught her most featly and most prettily<br>  "To harp.  He left her wiser in that art<br>  "Which wisely she has kept.  Thus, led by me,<br>  "Her music found thy knight and drew him forth,<br>  "Captive of harmony, unto her home,<br>  "Wherein his soul gat peace.  But for three days,<br>  "Misfortunes crossed her--then, the lady's touch<br>  "Failed at the fount of melody and health,<br>  "And by the demon of his madness borne<br>  "Into the icy dawn and shroud of mists,<br>  "Tristram--nor rested, as I wot, until<br>  "The forest's thorn-embrangled inmost heart<br>  "Held him lone guest of sorrow as before,"--<br>  "--O woe, O misery!  Of all mankind,<br>  "Lovers have sharpest doom--not one hath joy<br>  "Of those that thou hast named.--Brengwain, be sure,<br>  "That withered man no long time since hath been<br>  "Somewhat a pleasure to the sight--aye, aye--<br>  "With nobleness of frame and might of limb.<br>  "My dream-wrought mind!  The heart's-ease.--O, this heart!<br>  "Brengwain, be we all dying?  Dimly sense<br>  "Recalls the darling flower.--That withered man,<br>  "His former life within me as a dream<br>  "Floats dimly.  Strange--that withered man, near death,<br>  "Seems, like the flower, familiar once; again,<br>  "My cozening memory fails--the flower--the flower--<br>  "His face?"  She paused, self-questioning--"His face,<br>  "Is as the face of one whom I have seen<br>  "In many places."  Here a hopeless moan<br>  Spake from her heart.  Silence some moments--then,<br>  "Hist, Brengwain.  Hast thou ever loved?"--"Yea, queen."<br>  "And does Love wander wild, as I have talked?"<br>  "I never knew my state in love, sweet queen.<br>  "Your words are very words of love.  My ease<br>  "Of heart would perish in a night.  Ay, lover<br>  "Be nought of lover on a syllable.<br>  "'Tis like nought else."--"Ah, Brengwain, now I think--<br>  --"How sweet to feel one's memory hold again--<br>  "Did I not question thee--or should have done--<br>  "Upon Love's instant?"--"Yestermorn, we spake--<br>  "And now thou bringest me again to talk on't:<br>  "Whenas, I least would have of hope--in years,<br>  "Years long, long past--of love and lover--one<br>  "And both would shine.--O, those sweet years long past--<br>  "More beautiful than in the spring o' love."<br>  --"Such things then come again.  I, too, have found<br>  "That love may in a moment shew new season.<br>  "I ne'er was told--but know--its summer dies<br>  "With all its sighing autumn in an hour:<br>  "Then the cold, deathly winter--deathly cold,<br>  "And long."--Brengwain cried out.--"However long,<br>  "It yields to spring on the instant of a smile.<br>  "There is the word you asked for, my sweet queen."<br>  --"Months, months, I deem, have passed.  And may that instant<br>  "Come here?--to me?"--"It may."--"What time, sayst thou?<br>  --"For life, sweet queen."--"Nay, that was not thy word.<br>  "I said months, months--you spake of an instant--ah,<br>  "That instant of spring birth, may not the months<br>  "Black, icy months in which we now be bound,<br>  "Strangle it?  Ware you, Brengwain, that of love<br>  "Only one thing is certain unto all:<br>  "Being not, it shall not be, though angels crave it:<br>  "And being, as certain as it once was not<br>  "Time comes it shall not be.  There's all."--"Nay, nay!<br>  "Within the radiance of that instant's life<br>  "The past is as the past of night at dawn,<br>  "Forgotten:  the present, glory; and the future<br>  "Secure, serene."  Thus Isonde with her maid<br>  Along the pleasaunce-walks with frequent sighs,<br>  Talked as is need of those of highest place<br>  In grief with faithful servitors--the heart<br>  Being everywhere in everyone the same--<br>  And fellowship of sorrow makes us one.<br>  <br>  Listless, a few steps onward:  then, the queen<br>  Looked on the shrivelled shape again, which lay<br>  With close-shut eyes, and motionless.--"How still<br>  "He lies, as now in the extremity<br>  "Of quiet death," whispered La Belle Isonde.<br>  But scarcely had she wandered three spears' length<br>  Beyond the man, when her full heart brake forth.<br>  "O, Brengwain, Love is very life, I see.<br>  "We'd better love a withered man like that<br>  "Than have no love at all.  And, yet, my knight<br>  "Was glorious as an angel:  ever the same<br>  "Unto my soul, as when in Ireland's jousts--<br>  "Our Tristram!  Grace of arms!  Our Lion Knight!<br>  "Our Light of Honour!"--In her passion's pause<br>  She heard a cry.  "Hark, Hodain finds me here,<br>  "With voice I ever loved next to his lord's."<br>  She turned.  She saw with wild amaze her hound<br>  Leaping around the man--nor hand, nor brow,<br>  Nor cheek it left unkissed:  and then recalled,<br>  Hodain had never left her save for one,<br>  But for that one would ever leave her side,--<br>  He who had given the hound.  Nor could she speak,<br>  Nor move, La Belle Isonde:  and on her, lo,<br>  The man's eyes opened:  knew she wept:  and tears<br>  Can cleanse the foulest wound--and at the sight<br>  His soul healed, and his life gat strength--upsprang<br>  Sir Tristram--caught her--pressed her heart to heart.<br>  And voice was gone from both:  and best for both<br>  A sobbing silence.--Thus, again, the pair<br>  Came to each other:  thus the Spring o' Love<br>  Vanquished the winter in an instant's space.<br>  <br>  <center>*****</center> <br>  <br>                                                                         Long,<br>  She hung upon him as a wilding flower<br>  Hangs on a castle's ruins beautiful<br>  And beautifying.  After parley sweet--<br>  How long they might not know, since Time's fleet wing<br>  Swept past so softly then--with knightly step<br>  Tristram withdrew to seek his bower.  He gone,<br>  The queen with questioning melodious voice<br>  To Brengwain.  "Hath the season changed?  Your eye<br>  "Speaks wickedly.  You may lack grace o' love,<br>  "Yet, let me kiss thee.  Thou wert ever kind,<br>  "And hast forgiveness.--Of a truth, the light<br>  "Grows lovelier in the day:  and my heart sings<br>  "Sweetlier unto me than might any bird.<br>  "The scant flowers smile!  and, look, that willow branch<br>  "Beckons to yonder thorn:  and whispers,--hark,--<br>  "In every bush, to bid hearts'ease upraise<br>  "Its eye of blue again.  Yet tell me, truly,<br>  "Brengwain, dear soul, has it for once been so<br>  "These many, many months?"--"Yes, lovelier far<br>  "To lovers with Love's summer in their souls,<br>  "And nought to cross them."--"Thou art envious, pert, <br>  "Petulant.  A surly maid.  Must ever lack<br>  "Love's grace.  Go!  Lead me to my bower.  Pray, let<br>  "Thy face wear the true colour of thy heart, <br>  "Show not the shine of happiness you know not, <br>  "But take its proper sable."  Haughtily, <br>  Strode Belle Isonde as more than queen that hour: <br>  Triumphing royally in her knight returned. <br>  Tintagel's knight now here, a double pride<br>  Guerdon'd Mark's liberal pains.  'Twas vastly strange<br>  The history of the madman:  then 'twas fine<br>  Self-satisfaction to bestow his care<br>  On soul so desolate, whereon rang praise<br>  Full-voiced from Cornwall's nest of dissolute peers. <br>  And when the lion knight in time assumed<br>  The lion's port, between the four broad seas<br>  What potentate could claim such arm of faith, <br>  And iron will for functions of the field? <br>  Not long, this blithe content.  Barons and squires--<br>  Mark's revelling, craven, shrewd and rare, long-pledged<br>  Companions whilst Sir Marhaus held his gate--<br>  Their owlish spirits could not brook the light<br>  Of Honour shining in their purlieus.  Soon, <br>  Mark's double pride was flustered into hate. <br>  Whispering of Honour night and noon, wrought heat<br>  Of spirit, but when barbed hints and looks, <br>  Slanting at queen and lion-knight, were caught<br>  By Mark in jealous phrensy, men might wot<br>  Fate then abridged a noble life.--Soon done,-- <br>  Within Tintagel's dungeons--or, her waves<br>  Were ready to receive and hide the dead. <br>  But no--fear rules the raging heart--there lived<br>  Camelot's peerage, first estate of arms: <br>  The vengeance, when to Launcelot's heart went up<br>  The cry of Tristram's blood--therefore, his doom, <br>  Away, exiled from Cornwall's boundaries, <br>  Despised, affronted, roving knight-of-green, <br>  For twice five years.  Worse news had never struck<br>  Sir Tristram's soul--and with a voice of tears, <br>  He mourned of his large worship shown to Mark, <br>  Much known to all, but much untold, unknown. <br>  Sleepy neglect forbore to speak of much<br>  And envy hath its silence. <br>  <br>                                           That o'erpast, <br>  The fields of Logris called, awaiting him<br>  With other thoughts and hopes, with other fields<br>  For fame.  The knight-of-green's adventurous hand<br>  Still strenuous through the righteous wrath of love--<br>  Since Belle Isonde within his bosom lived<br>  As all of love in love's own powers and flame<br>  Exceeding, and impelled to deed sublime, <br>  Chastening or hallowed, or by arms or song, <br>  Achieved. <br>  <br>                    But for herself, the Beautiful, <br>  Rest none for her--and of her hot unrest<br>  Brengwain would find for her its errant cause: <br>  And on report of Logris, as domain<br>  Renovate by his roaming enterprise, <br>  Through perils, here not to be rehearsed, but dire, <br>  She found the steerage of his path, and last, <br>  Found him, the knight, in slumber near a spring--<br>  Sate softly by his side, and kept her heart<br>  In patience till he woke, when she resigned<br>  Letters of grace from her, his ladye-love. <br>  <br>  The Dragon King, that time, from Camelot<br>  Let cry a solemn three days' tournament<br>  For Maidens' Castle.  Mindful, Tristram held<br>  The news in keeping.  Upon loneliest hours, <br>  Gladdened his spirit with the fire of hope <br>  Bethinking of the promise of that day. <br>  This told he Brengwain, with request "Sweet dame<br>  "An thou wilt thither with me?"--"Ay, my lord, <br>  "Or whither thou mayst lead, if going I save<br>  "My lady's heart from sorrow, or yield her joy<br>  "To know thy worship."--"Sorrow none for us, <br>  "When heart doth write these letters brought by thee, <br>  "And letters have the welcome of such heart<br>  "As tells thee now its joy.  Thither, with me<br>  "The gainest way which brings us to behold<br>  "The famous fellowship of the Table Round, <br>  "Brave emulation in the Table Round, <br>  "The sun and centre of the Table Round, <br>  "Arthur, and in her throne queen Guinevere." <br>  <br>  O, vanity of Love!  He spoke the maid; <br>  He brought the maid to Maidens' Castle jousts--<br>  For why?  Scarce heard as whisper in his heart; <br>  It was, that seeing nobleness of knights<br>  And ladies beautiful beyond men's praise, <br>  Proclaim his valour, Brengwain soon should bring, <br>  For hearing of Isonde, report with wit<br>  Particular to time, display, and deed. <br>  But when this of the maiden, seen and heard, <br>  Her heart sank, never having yet conceived<br>  Such glory, beauty, power.  All those three days, <br>  Her heart, as in a marvellous vision endured<br>  Such terror for his weal, and, O, such pangs<br>  Of sudden amazing joy, when she beheld<br>  Time after time, his argent lion flare<br>  Before the lists--then the career, the clash, <br>  And prouder for the shock ride forth, his faith<br>  His honour, valour, crowned again.  Yea, fear<br>  Darkened her whilst his prowess kept each day. <br>  Was one so terrible, lord of the jousts, <br>  Crimson from helm to stirrup, truly knight<br>  So debonnair, so gentle in his grace, <br>  Single and simple in his love, as known? <br>  Found in such thought, a giant knight rode in, <br>  Claiming to break a lance.  With sea-like voice, <br>  Scornful he cried:  "From Cornwall's court I come--<br>  "Confess its queen, Isonde, excelling aught<br>  "Of any dame of any knight; announce<br>  "My purpose!  Save her rightful king, shall none<br>  "Exceed my worship:  none divide my claim, <br>  "And here, by me, the lion shall be quelled." <br>  Then Brengwain knew who came as from the shades, <br>  Knight of the King of Terrors,--Palomide, <br>  As he no less in darkest passion came, <br>  With sable panoply on sable steed, <br>  As ever in his quest, to drive to doom<br>  All valour that stood thwart his love, or dulled<br>  His worship of Isonde.  This Brengwain knew, <br>  And knowing swooned.  Her wakening eyes surveyed<br>  In fear the lists below--so long her swoon<br>  The knights had evenly proved two careers,-- <br>  Now came the third.  Or e'er he placed his lance<br>  In rest, Sir Tristram raised him on his steed, <br>  Stretched forth his arms, as though in previous fray<br>  He had been idler, and his limbs of might<br>  Ached for due action.  Then, the thunderous course--<br>  On which, midway, the shattering shock spread wide<br>  The splinters of the spears.  With speed of flame<br>  Tristram laid hands upon his foeman's shield<br>  Burst every strap--upon his charger's mane <br>  Laid prone the knight of Upsal's head, then swift<br>  With shield smote, stunned him--hurled the shield to earth--<br>  Caught at his helm, brake all its brazen bands, <br>  With helm showered wrathful perilous blows--so, bruised, <br>  Bloody, as dead, the peer of Odin sank<br>  Unhorsed, last tribute to that day of deeds, <br>  Since none, of fifty unbreathed knights, none now<br>  Dare trace the field.  The last dread day had closed--<br>  Tristram each day of all those three dread days, <br>  Master of the degree. <br>  <br>                                     Yet with default.-- <br>  In fortune's frolic, shorn of fortune's grace.-- <br>  He came not to dismount, as no knight came<br>  Master of the degree, ere comes a knight<br>  On lusty stammel steed with chiming pace, <br>  Clad in carnation-coloured arms, all o'er<br>  Beset with golden sprays:  upon his helm<br>  Spruce sprays of gold in bloom, with shield's device<br>  One golden blooming spray, and nuts of gold. <br>  His open visor shows a countenance<br>  Lightening with crafty humours, which distrain<br>  The glooming heart of Brengwain, as a torch<br>  Acquires with light within a cave the space<br>  Of darkness it is conquering.  Hark, the steed<br>  Caracoles blithely to its master's wit, <br>  Which tells that in the knight's appointments lie, <br>  Of silver sound some scores of hidden bells<br>  Ringing unto the caracole.  Then rose<br>  From knight, and clown, and laughing voice of dame--<br>  "Now, comes the singing-tilt of Dinadin." <br>  The sturdy stammel steed of Dinadin<br>  Sprang as to get a forward grip of earth, <br>  Whereon it held.  The lion like the wind, <br>  Or whirlwind towards him--missed in his attaint--<br>  Flew back from spear of Dinadin, as he<br>  By naught but violence of his whirlwind speed<br>  Were blown from saddle.  Ere the foiled knight rose,-- <br>  Ringing alway, as though the chivalry<br>  Of Camelot had voice in scornful song, <br>  Dinadin forth had sped, had flown the lists, <br>  With cry, "I ask no blood."  So is it told, <br>  These tilting times lacked not their special play<br>  To ease the crimson passions of the joust. <br>  <br>  Brengwain returned with news, she interwove<br>  Such praise of Dinadin within her speech<br>  And of the singing-tilt, her mournful queen<br>  Impassioned bade her exorcise his name<br>  From history of that jousting--but when all<br>  The puissance, the courtesy of those days<br>  Was heard, rightway that simple heart of love<br>  Swooned in her ecstasies of joy. <br>  <br>                                                                  No need<br>  In her estate for wonder.  Lovers' news<br>  At any time are powers--in misery, <br>  As fallen now upon the Beautiful, <br>  Love's loving news dash down the heart grown weak, <br>  Through abstinence of joy with suffering. <br>  Suffering?  Ay, Mark ere this had made well-known<br>  Beyond surmise, his mean, malignant self. <br>  His ruthless humour grew with passing weeks. <br>  None, in the misrule of his court might blame <br>  Or warn him:  one and all in love alike<br>  And wisdom scant.  Last, in his scornful hate<br>  Bestowed on Belle Isonde, her lord displayed<br>  Polluted taste, a riotous wantonness, <br>  As though each sorry portion of his guilt<br>  Of foulness, was more precious from the foil<br>  Of foulness to the sweetness of his queen: <br>  As, though her hurt and sorrow from his guilt, <br>  Gave to it pleasure's daintiest sting. <br>  <br>                                                           With arm<br>  Free to his twofold cause, now Tristram fared<br>  Once more the Knight of Love:  high Honour's beam<br>  Bare through shy noisome ways, till on an eve<br>  Fog-darkened, weary, and misled, he found, <br>  Deep in the quaking lands of Rueful Dale, <br>  Lodgment within a hold of mystery. <br>  There for a season cloistered, bondsman held<br>  Of wiliest witch that ever wore the form<br>  And beauty of a woman--Morgan le Fay--<br>  His faith was brought to proof.  Ah, but his love<br>  Moved not from Belle Isonde.  The dazzling witch, <br>  Her wiles, her potions, glamour in her gaze, <br>  Stirred not his fealty.  ****<br>  <br>                                                   Abrupt the end, <br>  Blasting enchantment, drawing the far sound<br>  Of the world's voices full upon his soul: <br>  Sanguine that end and sudden, when in mail<br>  The lady's paramour, her confrere tried<br>  In love's expedients and designs of death, <br>  Sought to conclude with Tristram in her grove, <br>  Whose leaves and blossoms had sweet nourishment<br>  From hearts beneath--brave, bounteous, and renowned<br>  Lured hither, buried here.  The mailed man<br>  With words of shame, shamed her--Morgan le Fay--<br>  As stings to rouse the peer--unsheathed his brand<br>  As for immediate outrage.  Then, the knight<br>  Held breath in anguish.  "Surely this be stain<br>  "Upon the virtues of the dame"--that thought<br>  Illumined him with honour's light, he saw<br>  Only a slanderous, intrusive churl--<br>  Leapt on him:  from his gauntlet's nerveless grasp<br>  Wrenching the blade, he clove him to the breast. <br>  Cloven the charm.  One thought, one stroke--the life<br>  Of bestial churl--and cloven was the charm. <br>  A wakening stroke:  a judgment flash had been<br>  The swift white lightning of his flying sword: <br>  And blood of evil broke the evil spell, <br>  And strong and clear of inward vision now, <br>  Still Knight of Honour, Tristram stood.  His bane<br>  Furnished new trophy for his trust in love. <br>  <br>  <center>*****</center> <br>  <br>  Led by that faith in Love, his venturous way<br>  Straight tended to the fair Memorial Stone<br>  Near Camelot, long years desired as place<br>  Dedicate to the sacrifice of love, <br>  Best place for heart sick-sorrowing. <br>  <br>                                                             Gazing there,<br>  O'er its white marble, crossed with crimson streak, <br>  Significant of radiant loves there slain, <br>  There resting--old and memorable words<br>  Of Merlin, from the bud of prophecy <br>  Burst into blossom. <br>  <br>                                      Hither, rode this time<br>  Sir Launcelot of the Lake:  and now was fought, <br>  Unknown of each, that fight of spear and sword, <br>  These gone, the struggle hand to hand, each gripe<br>  Keen as the fang of death.  Had bard been there, <br>  That crested hour were more than Roncesvalles<br>  In battle-blast of song.  Then each confessed<br>  Name to each other, and in knightly love<br>  Paced to the hallowed stone, where kneeling, both<br>  Made covenant of faithfulness and gave, <br>  Last token of consummate knightlihood, <br>  Matchless degree unto each other.  Thus, <br>  Blossomed the words of Merlin's wintry years. <br>  Beside that white Memorial Stone, there met<br>  "The two best knights in all King Arthur's days<br>  "And truest lovers known in any land." <br>  <br>  Now Launcelot's mind, wot that an hour was born<br>  Pre-eminent for worship:  that on him<br>  Was laid the charge of glory to induct<br>  Tristram into that final avenue<br>  Which brings the knight to be true child of fame. <br>  Hence, unto Arthur's court he drew his fere, <br>  Saluted with a jubilance as ne'er<br>  Before that day in Camelot, or known<br>  After, in Pendragonian times.  Once there, <br>  Arthur with pomp and honours brought our knight<br>  To seek the Table Round.  With him, approached<br>  Guinevere, in her lustre, damsels, peers,-- <br>  Soft-shining Pleiades of beauty, bands<br>  Chivalrous, whose appointments, gleaming shewed<br>  Various device of shield.  Then Guinevere<br>  Cried, "Welcome!"  answering, "Welcome!"  cried the dames: <br>  "Welcome!"  the damsels:  thrice the silver cries<br>  Against the clanging "Welcome!" of the knights. <br>  Uprose, the trumpet-greeting of the king, <br>  Whereon the signet of his tongue fulfilled<br>  The vehement joyaunce:--"Welcome!  to our court, <br>  "One of earth's best and gentlest knights, be thou! <br>  "Great hunter of the heathen!--from three realms<br>  "Thrusting their fierce invading hosts.  In chase, <br>  "Bearer of chiefest prize!  The bugle horn, <br>  "Of all its choicest measures:  terms of sport, <br>  "By hawk, and hound, and spear, beginner thou! <br>  "Of all the mystery by river's marge: <br>  "Of all the mystery in woodland ways, <br>  "Pursuit in air, field, holt, thou president! <br>  "Knight of most worship!  we confess and laud<br>  "Thee for thy dues:  and, as excelling other claim, <br>  "Thou music's great magister!  Voice nor hand, <br>  "Like thee hath stirred the spirit's melody, <br>  "Whence are begotten thoughts assuming oft<br>  "Wilful predominance, we lose the sense<br>  "For that indwelling music whence evolved. <br>  "Then, welcome!  Gentlest knight--of noblest deed, <br>  "Of song, master and lord!  Of noblest deed, <br>  "Love, courtesy, liege vassal, and yet lord<br>  "Puissant!  Welcome!" <br>  <br>                                      This being heard, with haste<br>  The martial Order ranged the Table Round. <br>  And Arthur looked on every seat there void, <br>  And one siege lacked its living knight,--that knight<br>  Foiled by young Tristram in his virgin fray<br>  Of knighthood 'neath Tintagel's walls--the siege<br>  Of Marhaus.  Whereupon, the Order's king<br>  Declared the morrow's business, when the tromp, <br>  Brought towards the dragon-throne--imperial work<br>  Of marvellous device from Merlin's hand, <br>  Which raised high o'er its royal seat the head<br>  Vengeful, with flickering tongue and blood-red eyes, <br>  And wound behind the king with folds of steel<br>  Rough-sparkling, and flat underneath his feet <br>  Laid broad its tail endued with arrowy sting; <br>  So Arthur sate as there upon his throne<br>  Protected by the beast, his dragon-helm<br>  Bickering, as though in wrath, himself a fear, <br>  Dragonish to every foe of law or faith; <br>  Around him, on this throne, by sound of tromp<br>  Gathered the pageantry of Table Round, <br>  With priests and saintly servitors in choirs, <br>  At spring of day.  Then to the minister porch. <br>  By hoar, divine Dubricius, there received: <br>  Hence led to the high altar, midst the noise<br>  Of instrument and song in psalmody<br>  Of praise, and incense fumes, with fragrant wreaths<br>  Filling the temple; there, intoned the mass, <br>  Succeeded by the service of the sword, <br>  The oaths of chivalry, the sacred charge--<br>  With benediction, whereupon heaven's hosts<br>  Raise their hosannas for the goodly time<br>  The knight shall strive for on the earth appears--<br>  And welcome of that hour, his good fight fought, <br>  He join the bands celestial.  Arthur, then, <br>  With state illustrious, adjudged the knight<br>  Worthy the vacant siege, with accolade<br>  Of resonant voice confirmed, invested him<br>  With due insignia of the Table Round. <br>  <br>  Closed these solemnities, through knightly throngs, <br>  Whose panoply of bright incessant flashed<br>  Fresh splendours into morn, there mingled groups<br>  Of fair and sweet, like blooms of garden blown<br>  By gentle winds.  All day, there intervened<br>  High tournament of young, and brave and gay, <br>  With minstrel sport which winged the golden hours<br>  With laughing joy.--Such martial nobleness, <br>  Such consecrating pomp, such merriment, <br>  Closed with proud feasting, used the Dragon King<br>  When Tristram entered siege of Table Round. <br>  <br>  <br>  <center>CHAPTER III.</center> <br>  <br>  <br>  This was the spring, with music overflown, <br>  Flower-starred, and odorous as any spring<br>  That smiled across the Logrian isle, or since, <br>  Or ever shall when we are all forgotten. <br>  <br>  <center>****</center> <br>  <br>  Days pleasantly grew into weeks, the weeks<br>  To months, which slid apace with shining feet<br>  Until within the autumn time there slept<br>  A sabbath's lustre upon Camelot. <br>  A day of peace and praise.--What thunderous noise<br>  Travels the vale in hast towards Camelot? <br>  Mark and his knights!--who reck not of the day, <br>  Its dedication, nor the faith whose peace<br>  Enwraps this evening's hour.  With pagan sneer<br>  Riding at morn, he cried,--"This day, fools know, <br>  "Adopts the sun:  and, so, but shine the sun<br>  "To us ripe time to speed our enterprise. <br>  "Matins to-morrow of the sword and spear." <br>  Hence, came the hoofs of these hard-breathing steeds<br>  Of Cornwall and his troop, led by himself<br>  Clanging to Camelot; with grace received<br>  By Arthur and the Order of the Ring, <br>  At close of evensong. <br>  <br>                                    At large, had Mark<br>  Heard of Sir Tristram's worshipful estate, <br>  The Dragon King's esteem, Sir Launcelot's love, <br>  Regard of Guinevere, and Logrian fame <br>  Blown by the wind throughout the land's resorts. <br>  Whereon, his wrath turned from his queen awhile. <br>  Despite the lion's lance, and of its sword<br>  Mindless, he brought his retinue to seek<br>  Favour of evil in the tournament. <br>  Short-coming there, his evil confidence<br>  Full store possessed of foul dishonouring tales<br>  Particular in poisonous hint--or, last, <br>  None better than this heart of fraud, was schooled<br>  In mission of the hidden steel. <br>  <br>                                       But, lo, <br>  What change upon that self-same sabbath's night, <br>  And days succeeding!  Cornwall had receipt <br>  Of bounteous, general greeting, courteousness, <br>  Simplicity of elegance in act, <br>  Imperial consideration, meek, <br>  Mutual, cementing ranks from churl to queen, <br>  That in the sharp air of the chivalrous court<br>  The habit of Mark's mind endured a change--<br>  Passion of peace, of gentleness the power<br>  Known now in Mark, and Arthur had his vow<br>  Within Tintagel pure and lofty life<br>  Should be sustained.  A vow, his noblest given, <br>  Soon secretly unsworn, although its gloss<br>  Held Cornwall still as one redeemed to eyes<br>  Unsharpened by suspicion, blind in trust. <br>  <br>  <center>*****</center> <br>  <br>  Within the noiseless chariots of the clouds, <br>  The spirits of night drave to the setting sun, <br>  And brought for him an hour unsought, prepared<br>  By evil minds.  Within a lonely glade, <br>  Rambling in thought, Mark was aware of twain<br>  Conversing as in grief, who won delight <br>  On his approach.  Mordred and Vivien these, <br>  And he their prey.  That nephew of the king<br>  Mordred, within the court a secret tongue, <br>  Moving with creeping step and humbled face, <br>  Alive to everything:  the fiend in need, <br>  Acknowledging the heaven he had foregone<br>  And sought to discompose:  Mordred, a name<br>  Of shame and death:--Vivien, of wanton gaze, <br>  On Merlin, late withdrawn to hermit cell<br>  As done with life, but prescient that his life<br>  Would strangely suffer from a damsel's wiles; <br>  Prescient a seeming silent tongue would strike<br>  Ruin on glory of the state--a step<br>  Noiseless was creeping upon Arthur's fame, <br>  Nor long to speed him to the silent shores--<br>  Merlin, whose spring of three-score years was gone<br>  And all his mighty summer, now a seer<br>  Hoary, a memory clothed with poësy--<br>  On him intent Vivien, the winsome fair, <br>  Patient his fated, long-deferred return<br>  Awaiting--but, meanwhile, kept her in play: <br>  With frivolous, perilous thoughts in ward, ne'er found<br>  Idling in toils of blame:  or fishing she, <br>  Or mending of her nets, was always found. <br>  Now, her resolve dight her in crimson gleams: <br>  Soft blush of wilding rose at morn, this hour<br>  Of eve brought cramousie, for love's desires<br>  Fancy's best fashion, and to Cornwall's eyes<br>  An amourous trouble.  Either spake to Mark<br>  In interchange of comment:  Mark replied--<br>  Of scandals of the court, of knights, of dames<br>  And wrongs of Mark.--Disloyal speech conceived<br>  Of hate, had brood of murderous thoughts:  delight<br>  Of death, came of this intercourse. <br>  <br>                                                             Days died, <br>  Days rose, and rising now, bright broke the day<br>  Mark shall depart, when faithful to the vow<br>  Kept unto knights and dames, he asks a boon<br>  As sealing vow:  that, for Tintagel's aid, <br>  In pure and lofty life there be conjoined<br>  Sir Tristram--boon upcast on Arthur's wish--<br>  "Let men be in accord, all will be well: <br>  "Without they are accorded, nought is well." <br>  But Launcelot feared for Tristram, feared King Mark, <br>  His dungeons and his secret ministers, <br>  So spake against the temper of his king. <br>  Clear, resolute--drew his anointed sword, <br>  Thrice waved it o'er his head as sacred sign, <br>  Thrice kissed its hilt, as token of the cross, <br>  Therewith, to pledge his worship and his soul, <br>  Should harm befall Sir Tristram on such choice, <br>  Affliction should befall to Cornwall's land<br>  Beyond the scath of heathen or of plague. <br>  Nor trusting to his minatory words, <br>  Nor awe, as told the pallor of the kings, <br>  Launcelot besought his first beloved of knights, <br>  In knightly faith and Love's obeisance, wait<br>  Here in the circuit metropolitan: <br>  Oft, honour calls to hold the kingdom's fame<br>  'Gainst paynim prowess:  here, due residence<br>  For faith and valour; else, let Tristram seek <br>  Emprise promiscuous amidst the wilds<br>  Of lands beyond the seas--only, with Mark<br>  Forbear to go.  Not to Tintagel--no. <br>  On which with slow, half-weeping voice replied<br>  The heart-struck knight of war, "My brother, mine, <br>  "By all that makes our Order as the stars<br>  "Of honour unto dark humanity: <br>  "By all the worship shewn in pageants played, <br>  "Or stiff-fought fields, for favour or defence<br>  "Of ladye-love, my brother, I must go! <br>  "More than to leave the lists of Logris, more, <br>  "Than here renounce the glory-lighted realms<br>  "By paynims held, is to lose thee.  Yet still, <br>  "I go.  Their wish is mine:  its home is here<br>  "And resting place."  Gently, with head abased, <br>  He laid his palm above his heart.  "Here, home<br>  "Of all the kingly wish:  though well you wit, <br>  "Upon an issue of mine own I go. <br>  "Angels are with us all:  but none, the chief<br>  "Gabriel, Archangel, bearer of the divine<br>  "Decrees, may ever bind or loosen love. <br>  "The sorrow in my loss of thee foregone, <br>  "This heart exults with joy.  Thou knowest love. <br>  "So bound, so burdened, yet so light of heart, <br>  "Always our case when ladye-love in view. <br>  "Yet,--nay--without the sight of Belle Isonde, <br>  "My spirit may not endure."  And from that hour, <br>  Till darkness brought him light, he knew not Mark, <br>  From his own eye, or from the voice of friend, <br>  But kept his faith in king, and served him well, <br>  Soul-blind through his o'er-quickened sense of love. <br>  <br>  The winter gone, a damsel from Isonde--<br>  Brengwain, it was, once more--reached Camelot<br>  At glow-worm time, when midst the evening shades, <br>  First seen its lamp of love.  Hers, news of joy: <br>  Letters for Arthur, Launcelot, Guinevere,-- <br>  Letters affecting Mark, Isonde, their weal, <br>  And Tristram's; unto most, a resonant joy. <br>  But twain found in her news a hate disguised,-- <br>  Arthur and Launcelot.  These apart communed, <br>  Shadows upon the common joy:  whence came<br>  An answer royal, one of kindly words<br>  Yet bearing thought, as of Sir Tristram's weal<br>  Doubtful but heedful. <br>  <br>                                         Now it was, the worm<br>  Disclosed his fang before the open day. <br>  Sting, poison went together and at once. <br>  Mark's answer, as with haste of wings, arrived, <br>   The first jar in the music of his life, <br>  Puissant, pure, high-hearted, gentle, proud<br>  And guileless Arthur:--"As we are, we are. <br>  "I bid thee intermit thee with thyself, <br>  "And wife and knight:  as for myself, the power<br>  "I ever had, have now, will ever have<br>  "To rule and keep a wife." <br>  <br>                                              The house of hell<br>  There threw its lurid light on hidden ways<br>  Known not to Arthur's generous, trustful mind--<br>  Which knew alone what honour's sun revealed, <br>  Fair, simple paths on which none went astray. <br>  And as Mark's words of searching fire would burn<br>  Ceaseless within his brain, as clouds on clouds<br>  Rolling and gathering, darkening evils came<br>  In deepening folds, O, that imperial soul<br>  Felt, O, such sadness!  O, such loneliness! <br>  Slackened his spirit, that he may nor write, <br>  Nor think reply to Cornwall:  and his throne<br>  Suffered besieging sorrows, till that fray<br>  Adder-begotten, and of Mordred's work, <br>  Roared through the misty noon, and Arthur's realm<br>  With evening sank in silence by the sea, <br>  And Arthur's saintly soul found final peace. <br>  <br>  But, now, a counter-stroke from Dinadin--<br>  Returned from lengthy embassage--gay sprite. <br>  Ay, certes, as his name rings when ye read<br>  Or hear, his nature tallied with his name. <br>  He was the merry-making knight within <br>  The Table Round--all hurry, sparkle, song. <br>  And, now, an apparition from the halls<br>  Dedicate to victorious mirth, made fly<br>  Arrows of scornful laughter, and re-lit<br>  The courtly joyaunce.  Jaunty muse being his, <br>  Half-pique, half-love, with speedy offspring fit, <br>  In homage to the royal grief--the child, <br>  A ballad to King Mark:  its name, a shaft<br>  That pierced, "Mark is my mark."  Whereon, he called<br>  His harper Elyot, taught him harp this lay--<br>  Ordained him other harpers,--but, enow,-- <br>  Sir Dinadin within his ballad verse<br>  Retorted on Mark's shame a sixfold shame<br>  In phrase so forceful still it lives renowned, <br>  "Worst lay that ever harper sang with harp." <br>  <br>  When Elyot reached Tintagel there to harp<br>  The waspish lay, Sir Tristram then had cleansed<br>  Cornwall from foes once more.  Once more, not one<br>  In Cornwall's buffoon chivalry gave word <br>  Of courage; and the scourge of sword and fire<br>  By Sessoin's raging bands, the dread White Horse, <br>  Christ's bane, the pagan's iron pride, for long<br>  Kept still the music of Sir Tristram's hand--<br>  The lion knight, once more, in fate of arms<br>  Tintagel's help; through strengths of love and faith<br>  The bastion of her towers. <br>  <br>                                              Great Sessoin's lord<br>  He met in view of either host:  when sate<br>  The seigniories of knights to taste the fray; <br>  In midst of Cornwall's powers, its king:  with him, <br>  His queen, the Beautiful, unto the gaze <br>  Of Sessoin's peerage a most marvellous light<br>  Of loveliness.  Each knight her every grace<br>  Computed at war's value:  favouring smile, <br>  Well-worth a spear-thrust:  and that shining cloud<br>  Which dimmed her diadem, that affluent hair<br>  Dazzling, one lock of it well-worth the price<br>  Of venturous quest from Candlemas to Yule: <br>  No soul of Sessoin's barbarous horde but owned<br>  Presence of one of those fine beings rare<br>  Amidst the cloudy centuries they gild, <br>  Well-worth the hazard of a kingdom's rule. <br>  Prompt at the hour of tierce, Sir Ælias rode, <br>  His purport shown in sable panoply, <br>  Straight to the tourney's eastern gate, and there<br>  Paused.  La Belle Isonde's beauty on his tongue<br>  Silenced the challenge.  But by herald's voice<br>  Drawn from his fantasy, his sanguine ire<br>  Re-doubled, Ælias shouted o'er the lists--<br>  "Fair knight, at thy pavilion this dawn<br>  "With my spear point, good iron of Poictou, <br>  "I touched thy shield.  Thou knows't my purpose--death!" <br>  "I answer to the utterance," Tristram cried. <br>  "Our orisons are told, but with the dirge<br>  "My tears will be required for thee.  Fair knight, <br>  "Now thy devoir." <br>  <br>  <center>*****</center> <br>  <br>                                 But Tristram wist not, yet<br>  True danger was to come.  This Sessoin's lord, <br>  Man in the height of arms was he:  inspired<br>  By passion of the war, he was enriched<br>  With skill and hardiment.  On this third bout, <br>  Both spears were splintered, both knights fell unhorsed. <br>  But fallen not their spirits:  with their swords<br>  They fought as there had been a flaming fire<br>  Encompassing.  They fenced, they foigned--keen, quick, <br>  Stout strokes of nimblest play:  traced, traversed, hot<br>  As wild stags full of autumn blood provoked<br>  In lordship of the hind.  Hauberk and helm<br>  Hewn roughly:  shorn, huge cantles of their shields--<br>  Their doughten deeds surpassed all learned from voice, <br>  Or scroll, of fairy land or chivalry. <br>  <br>  Now crimson fall the sands of Tristram's life. <br>  Faint from the heat and anguish of the fray<br>  His head droops o'er his shield:  the draught of death<br>  Proposed for Ælias, Tristram's parting soul<br>  Longs to partake, as o'er his eyes descend<br>  Shades, closing all the bright and noisy scene, <br>  This dread imperial debate, transact<br>  For Mark and Cornwall, and the lists of love, <br>  Late glorious, with the queen of every heart<br>  Presiding.  Then, a mocking laughter sprung<br>  From galleries westward, keener than the edge<br>  Of sword or glaive to Tristram, as he felt<br>  His knighthood was the gazing stock of fools, <br>  Who judge not of event but of the chance. <br>  Awakening sounds.--His soul creeps from the swoon<br>  To feebly grasp at life.  Uncomforted, <br>  And cold, he wots that hosts with revelling jeers<br>  Witness his yielding strength:  whilst others mourn<br>  Doom falling darkly on their lion knight. <br>  On Isonde's throne, he there beholds a face<br>  Pale, with its eyes afire, and o'er it hang<br>  Cumbrous and dun her tresses in the bright<br>  Slant sunshine.  Harken, Love's power, once again!-- <br>  He notes upon her rose-bereaved, worn cheek, <br>  Flashing a sacred and peculiar light, <br>  Tears of wild sorrow, whereupon his soul<br>  Drank courage from them, cast aside the robes<br>  Of palsying faintness, fear and pain.--More brief<br>  Than this brief verse, such fury in his change, <br>  Sir Tristram's finish of the fight.  His sword<br>  Flew on his foe:  a score of blows for one<br>  Confused the lord of Sessoin:  from their force<br>  The shield brake on his arm--his hauberk pierced, <br>  Oped entrance to his heart, his helmet cloven<br>  Brought death on death--to the beholder's gaze<br>  Ælias seemed smitten everywhere at once. <br>  <br>  For all of this, despiser of true worth, <br>  Worship of arms, renown, fidelity, <br>  Mark, when he heard the song of Dinadin<br>  Mark would have slain his champion-knight, sole stay<br>  Of throned authority, the warden spear<br>  Of his dominion.  And when Elyot's lay<br>  Was harped and sung before the languid court, <br>  Mark blazed in angered words--but softly ends, <br>  "Name him who sends thee, and we bide our time<br>  "For chastisement."  But Elyot as he heard, <br>  Bore heedless gaiety of look, and thrummed<br>  An under-note, and gazing on the ground, <br>  Spake as a harper in the privilege<br>  Of song accorded everywhere.  "The name<br>  "I serve beneath?--One you affect, sweet king--<br>  "Sir Dinadin, most debonair of knights, <br>  "My lord, my gentliest lord is Dinadin. <br>  "An, wit ye well, I am a minstrel, sire, <br>  "One who must sing the songs made by his lord<br>  "As he must wear the arms his lord doth wear." <br>  <br>  Thus, Mark the king, the king but newly saved, <br>  Clothed in fair silken raiment, and his word<br>  Soft as the chime for vigils, but within<br>  Dead spirit cased in thrice-proof mail of self<br>  Played the knave-king.  For, this time, Tristram lay<br>  Close chamber-prisoned, sore with many wounds<br>  Begat from Ælias, known when careful leech<br>  Found harness of the war to bring more hurt<br>  Than it might save from.  Silken, chiming Mark, <br>  His trailing step now haunts the corridors<br>  'Tween the sick room and feasting hall, morn, noon, <br>  And midnight--kindly in his watch, with heed<br>  In all required for Tristram's tourney-hurt<br>  And fever--till his time was come.  Then, haste--<br>  When time was come. <br>  <br>                                           Knights, dames, intent on mirth, <br>  Warily brought was Tristram, one still eve, <br>  Through dense dusk woods, lone fields, by moorland heights<br>  And craggy pass:  lodged in a lonesome keep, <br>  Fore-fronting sea, with rear of splintered cliffs, <br>  Flanked, south and north, with black, sharp, high-heaped rocks, <br>  With torrent of its own, whose ceaseless shout<br>  Would drown the noise of battle though hard by. <br>  Thus safely brought and lodged, from potion sooth<br>  Three nights, two days, he fell on sleep, and then<br>  Awoke in darkness.--Well, was Tristram, here, <br>  Withdrawn from notice of his fellowship: <br>  In changeless night imprisoned:  this his grave, <br>  Deep in the heart of the wild water's cry, <br>  Far-hid from any quest, or guess of friend. <br>  <br>  Nothing of Tristram, now, from Mark but pride<br>  Through this event.  He, dungeoned to await<br>  The hour when Mark should end his earthly hours, <br>  Awoke Mark's pride in other hate and love: <br>  Outspoken at the feast when courtly tongues<br>  Talked Camelot--and, there--now, here--now, round--<br>  Flew whispers, with eye-wantonness, when named<br>  One maiden.  Hearing it, the lips of Mark<br>  Stirred with pale spasms, and from them, as would spring, <br>  From covert a wild creature of the woods, <br>  Out of the secret shadows of his mind<br>  To light sprang Vivien's graceless name; wherewith, <br>  Such travail of his love-sick thoughts, with throes<br>  Of husky utterance, waving arms, and cheeks<br>  Red with the haste of passion, came to birth<br>  The burden of his blind adulterous hopes. <br>  "Vivien!  ah, Vivien!  Fondling once of hers, <br>  "Amidst the butterflies of Arthur's court, <br>  "Was he, your king.--Vivien!  her eyes--stars, stars, <br>  "My liegemen, stars--whose random beams abase<br>  "The tempered glances of our dames--her eyes, <br>  "Like planet-stars would ever seek for me<br>  "As her sole sun:  to tell by luminous look, <br>  "Excelling orders, princedoms, royalties, <br>  "Which whirled around in rainbow-throngs, your king<br>  "Within her love's respect."  Mark's shrunken form<br>  Grew with the fever of his mood:  his laugh<br>  Metallic, coarse, now owned a softened tune, <br>  As Vivien's name had learned it music.  "Ah, <br>  "Vivien might not of me, nor I of her: <br>  "But time will come.  Fair ladies, you may smile. <br>  "The evening lustre poured from Vivien's eyes<br>  "Brightens above our dusk of absence:  morn<br>  "Near, and to be awakened by those eyes, <br>  "Both wait in patience.  Ay, my speech is plain.<br>  "'Tis told, that Vivien found a leman since, <br>  "And wons with him in hoar Broceliande. <br>  "Soon be that ended.  Many loves your king<br>  "May have, whilst lacking her."  He paused to hear<br>  A little, hidden, quavering, feminine laugh--<br>  As comes the intermittent note of bird<br>  From thicket ere its month of song arrives, <br>  This mocking trill--and in Mark's pause, its voice, <br>  "The queen!  the queen!"  Mark answered challenge quick, <br>  Vociferous, "Queen!  Which queen?  Of Camelot, <br>  "Or this Tintagel?  or, one yet to be?" <br>  Foul mirth ran round the borders of his court, <br>  Whereon, he adds, "'Tis for one's gain at times<br>  "To clear the mind:  it makes our fellows wise." <br>  To other talk Mark turned, with sad conceit<br>  His tongue had done good work, and not invoked<br>  The fates in altered Belle Isonde.  No word<br>  She uttered; murmured only in her heart, <br>  "He is immured and sigheth unto death!" <br>  The worst was now begun.  With lengthening speech, <br>  The tresses of La Belle Isonde, their bright<br>  Heavily deepening into shade, their shades<br>  Darkening, informed her bosom, now the lodge<br>  Of torments.  Mark had slain her loyalty, <br>  And tolled the advent of his deadliest fear: <br>  Removed the crown from off her heart:  disrobed<br>  Her thoughts of hallowed passiveness:  of queen, <br>  Dismantled every august privilege:-- <br>  No more of queen for her to grace the throne, <br>  Nor on her soul for reverence--nevermore. <br>  Shorn of her comeliness, of smiles, she rose<br>  Speechless, but, as she passed the door, sounds fell<br>  Unconscious from her lips--"Asp of a King!" <br>  Shuddering, the court held silence, and its head<br>  Paled, cowering as he wot the sudden glaive<br>  Gleamed on his last of life.  Thenceforth, his queen<br>  A soul upon cross-currents of dark thoughts, <br>  Which loathed the present, shunned respected right. <br>  Mute-wandering ceaselessly, alone, <br>  A silent presence, she, within his halls--<br>  Cold, waning in her silence, till arose<br>  At midnight, from her ruffled dreams, fierce words<br>  With shrilling shrieks, and with the shrieks the flame<br>  Of phrensy brake upon her countenance: <br>  Her eyes, stabbed at a king within the air: <br>  Her hands, tore at its heart:  her shrilling tongue<br>  Declared the blood, the fury, the content. <br>  Nor waiting dawn, king Mark made speed for France, <br>  Fearing her phrensy kindling--what, where, who? <br>  He knew not:  or, her scorpion words had sting, <br>  Instant to strike, when, where, or how?  he knew not. <br>  A shapeless terror, proper chastisement<br>  Of dastard souls of cruelty, had cleansed<br>  Tintagel of that heart of fraud, its king. <br>  <br>  Some six weeks thence, the angered peril past<br>  For Belle Isonde, her steps fresh-sought her groves, <br>  A queen of sorrow in Tintagel's towers, <br>  With sole and solemn rule.  Within these weeks<br>  Mark had been judged:  his first offence and chief<br>  Against the spiritual powers:  next, wedded pledge <br>  Broken with bruited boastfulness by Mark, <br>  On which, that pious light Dubricius<br>  Pronounced him excommunicate and signed<br>  The writing of divorcement, by his king<br>  Delayed not from Tintagel.  Thus, Isonde, <br>  The sundering words of awe made free--gat gain<br>  Of freedom with no heart in it. <br>  <br>                                                           ***There was--<br>  Believe it, hearts of love, even as ye hear--<br>  A brightening of the star of Jupiter<br>  Upon the vigil of Epiphany, <br>  Sir Tristram's star,--since at his meal that eve<br>  His unseen warder spake him kindly.  Who, <br>  But knows the blessing of the word in season? <br>  For Tristram, more was this than lavrock's song<br>  On darkling hours which sings the sun's approach. <br>  The gentle language of an uncouth voice<br>  Brought to his mind his last bright yesterday, <br>  Awakened hopes of daylight, with mirage<br>  Of glories of the tournament.  And soon<br>  The angel of his Christian valiance cheered<br>  His heart late sorrowful as of the dead<br>  Within the sepulchre.  He sank in dreams<br>  Where fields of noblest guerdon, realms of peace<br>  Prosperous in halls and lists gave starry fame<br>  To worth in arms:  and, clearer than of dreams, <br>  Obtained a star more fair than stars of power, <br>  A visionary form, in smiles and grace<br>  A heavenly womanliness, o'erhung, it seemed, <br>  With golden mists as of resplendent hair, <br>  Clothed with like radiance. <br>  <br>                                              Less than seven days thence, <br>  The dungeoned Tristram knew of nought beside, <br>  Than, loosed from chains and the loud cataract's cry, <br>  Borne from his hideous hold on kindly arms, <br>  Strange freedom claimed him.  With that travel soothed, <br>  He sank on sleep.  Orion rose and fell, <br>  Day came, and ruled with lordly light, and passed--<br>  When wakening, lo, he found himself on sea, <br>  The star of love lightening the evening hour, <br>  The star of love shining above his head: <br>  Isonde the Beautiful, his guardian now, <br>  As she with woman's guile, in this quick time, <br>  Had caused these things to be, and un-queened queen, <br>  Guardian, and free from grim Tintagel's walls. <br>  <br>  Bluff next morn's wind, but sailors of renown<br>  Manned the good ship, so that her prow still kept<br>  A forward voyage:  and when eve brought calm, <br>  Her large full moon revealed the isles, whereby, <br>  On lucid waves life-love was born, as born<br>  Love's queen, well-known, on azure orient seas<br>  Saluted by the hours whose odorous dance<br>  Thereon rings through the world to-day--mope, doubt, <br>  Or moan, whoever, and how many list. <br>  --No time for loitering now.  Love's plumes are spread<br>  To reach its fairest bowers by northern shores. <br>  Swift through the waters, now direct to east<br>  The vessel speeding through that night--next day--<br>  And Tristram's old strong life began to flow<br>  Responsive to the spring-tide's rising wave, <br>  Each moment fledged with song, or song-like talk<br>  Of past delights:  and while the westering sun<br>  Shot crimsoning radiance over all the deeps, <br>  On that supremest of emotion's hours--<br>  Tristram grew restless--saw, anew, his joy<br>  Of Isonde with its rich original powers<br>  Move in the shining mazes of her hair: <br>  Light of all light the blossom, in her eye, <br>  Whose glamour henceforth through all fate to hold, <br>  Till sudden death-mists compassed both their lives. <br>  Moulting his sorrows, on a stronger wing <br>  His freshened spirit gloried as it rose. <br>  Boldness, with deepening dusk--and when the moon<br>  Silvered the myriad-wrinkled seas, and far<br>  The cliffs of Dovre stood out clear, he drew<br>  The master from his place:  his spear-hands took<br>  The helm, put ship about, and set her head<br>  Against the pole-star.  Then, wind-favouring night<br>  Breathed from the south:  before it eager sprang <br>  The ship through star-lit hours:  next day:  next eve--<br>  And when the Great Bear through heavens crystal-bright, <br>  Eternal, wheeled above their eyes, the ship<br>  Veered, as if witting home, to larboard up<br>  Dull Humber's stream--with day-spring touched the land--<br>  Logris was won. <br>  <br>                               Ere long, these news being brought<br>  To Camelot, thence upon the court's desire, <br>  Sealed by the ordinance of the Dragon King, <br>  Launcelot with haste passed through the land to greet<br>  These twain self-banished, yield them royalty<br>  Of courtesy:  which done, as lovers know, <br>  He led them to his famous Joyous Gard. <br>  Northwards, by long and pleasant paths he led<br>  Isonde and Tristram.  Then, approaching near<br>  His fair possession's borders, he with sighs<br>  Bade both farewell, distrustful that its view, <br>  And their large joy in love's estate, might work<br>  His passion to excess. <br>  <br>                                         'Twas primrose time: <br>  Exhilarating then the pomp of spring, <br>  But close in loving intercourse the twain<br>  Fare softly onwards, heeding none the tracts<br>  Of flowery gold, which skirting either side<br>  Lead from their path to fairy lawns wherein<br>  Blue breaks of passionate forget-me-not<br>  Peer bright as spring's own heavens:  unconscious, too, <br>   Of Joyous Gard itself, till by the shore<br>  Within the sun it rises from the sea<br>  Irradiant.  Like some broad, voluminous shape<br>  Of vapour, which upon an autumn eve<br>  Towers in the western skies, with lustre clad<br>  Of varying sunset hues up from its base<br>  To high aërial battlements, no less<br>  Of marvellous and of glorious to their sight<br>  The keep of Joyous Gard.  Then, unawares,-- <br>  As though invisible this lordliest keep<br>  Till now--redoubled wonder in them.  Hope,-- <br>  Sir Tristram won great hope in heart at this, <br>  Remembering what the household legends held: <br>  That Joyous Gard possessed a conscious life<br>  For care of its indwellers:  oft at noon<br>  Fleeting, at midnight it would re-appear<br>  Begirt and crowned with stars, but on the morn<br>  Its station lay concealed.  He cried in joy, <br>  "This truly is the home of love, of us<br>  "Expectant.  Hid from eyes of enmity, <br>  "Hosts in their search discomfited may learn<br>  "Love's bowers sequestered lie in keep of air. <br>  "Love's choicest home, henceforth it shall be ours."<br>  <br>  <br>  <center>CHAPTER IV.</center> <br>  <br>  <br>  Intrusted to the care of Joyous Gard, our song<br>  Must linger with the happy exiles here. <br>  Brave Joyous Gard! or lands, or keep, or town<br>  Be named as Joyous Gard. <br>  <br>  <center>*****</center> <br>  <br>                                                 Look forth,-- <br>  Know Launcelot's province!  Seaward, roughly-edged, <br>  Range beyond range of black volcanic scars, <br>  Thence, westward, verdant undulating lands<br>  Stretch to the folding hills and half-way climb<br>  Their slopes:  within the upper, keener air<br>  The moorland's growth, the crags, green combs, grey screes, <br>  The tarn, the eagle--here the loneliness<br>  Of hills, their terrors, loveliness and glooms. <br>  <br>  Three furlongs from the strand, the little town<br>  Named Joyous Gard lies in a little dell, <br>  Through which the breathings of the sea come fresh<br>  Morning and evening.  Little town, it looks<br>  Up to the Keep, whose station off-shore, east, <br>  Some three-score fathoms.  Cunning its approach<br>  From narrow beach--a frith of pebbles, laid<br>  Between the sharp-cut rocks, whence went the way<br>  Suddenly shelving towards a sinuous path<br>  Hidden at ebb of tide,--access but one, <br>  Which found the portals cavernous and dark. <br>  Above the sea, the steeps high-climbing clothed<br>  With grass, moss, wilding flowers, unto the tall<br>  Columnar cliffs, tower-crowned.--Ah, of these towers! <br>  Along the gaunt, brown pinnacles a growth<br>  Of sparry crags, or unto fancy's eye<br>  The blossoming of the brown, gaunt cliffs, along<br>  Whose crests it glittered, or beneath the sun, <br>  Or during star-lit hours.--Mysterious Keep! <br>  One foot within deep waters, one on land, <br>  Terrible in its beauty, of more fame<br>  Than its haught kindred, lone Tintagel, or<br>  Mount of Defence, when billows of the war<br>  Rolled in from the Atlantic. <br>  <br>                                                 This the work, <br>  In happier years of Merlin, august voice<br>  Prophetic, from whose accents souls of hope<br>  Still trust the Beatific Time to see. <br>  This Gard, once named as Dolorous, now of Joy, <br>  Was edified by him in nights but seven: <br>  A silent, unseen labour of seven nights: <br>  Thence holding near affinity with night, <br>  Its majesties, its glories, and its powers, <br>  Its attributes of peace and mystery. <br>  The sea-mists first would gather o'er its towers, <br>  Last leave them.  At such times, the landsmen cried, <br>  "Lo, Joyous Gard hath disappeared once more!"-- <br>  "Lo, Joyous Gard floats on our waves again!" <br>  But the deceit of absent-mindedness<br>  Augmented wonders:  as we frequent pass<br>  Some scene and see it not--those of the fields<br>  In eye-shot of the Keep, on many a day<br>  Would reap or delve, come, go, with earth-bent head, <br>  Then, some time, looking up,--"Ah, me," would cry. <br>  "This be a blessed hour!  The Gard of Joy, <br>  "Missed this long while, returns to us."  Should one, <br>  A chance wayfarer, walk that road and vow<br>  Before his travels it had been this while, <br>  They would embrace the man:  with fairy gifts<br>  Deem him endowed, and hospitality <br>  Enforce with words of worship--simple race, <br>  As further we to learn. <br>  <br>                                         Miles twain o'er sea, <br>  Out towards the orient, running south and north, <br>  A long, low-crested line of reefs stayed off<br>  The wind-wrought surges--with nor-easter days, <br>  Shattered thereon in cloudlike splendours,--thus, <br>  A slumbrous, inner, ocean-lake retained, <br>  Peculiar watery province of the Gard,-- <br>  Beset with isles, which, here and there a home, <br>  Made bright scenes brighter, each with crescent holt<br>  Of gracious lady-birch, in autumn time<br>  Midst sunlight very bowers of trembling gold. <br>  Upon the furthest northern holm, a fane, <br>  Conspicuous shrine of spiritual power, <br>  Eye, soul of Joyous Gard's humanities, <br>  Caught with one glittering point, whilst valleys slept<br>  And yet the inland heights were darkness, caught<br>  Morn's earliest light shot o'er the eastern seas, <br>  As eager for new promise from that east, <br>  Well-spring of sacred light. <br>  <br>                                                O, Joyous Keep! <br>  O, Royal Gard!  O, happy those its charge! <br>  Bright spirits are their ministers:  for them, <br>  Quietly ocean's waves fall and flow, <br>  Retire and flow again.  If on the sea, <br>  Within the storm if any sorrow rang, <br>  It reaches not these towers:  the tempest's cry<br>  Sounds as a murmuring rill, or when the winds<br>  Mourn in the beechen groves:  all beauteous things<br>  Of sea-birth flourish in the tranquil wave, <br>  Or moving through the crystal deeps, or far<br>  Beneath in clusters grow, a wealth of flowers<br>  As earth's flowers do in air. <br>  <br>                                                Once hither come, <br>  La Belle Isonde and Tristram, bowers apart<br>  Are duly given them:  his outlooking west<br>  Abroad upon the lands and warder hills: <br>  Hers eastward, with the sea lake and its isles, <br>  A pleasaunce all her own.  O, Joyous Gard, <br>  What fervent, dainty times, alive with cheer<br>  Of gentle change, which is the salt of life, <br>  For these our exiled lovers lingering here. <br>  Days grow to weeks:  the weeks mature to months--<br>  Which find them still true acolytes of love, <br>  Enquiring of its secrets, which would own<br>  Elysian birth-right of felicities<br>  Robed in dawn-splendours.  Then, their wanderings--<br>  Whither?  Ah, could we follow them, to learn<br>  The life of those meek dwellers in their land, <br>  And of its leafy privacies, and what<br>  Of grandeur and of awe its mountains hold. <br>  These quick delights, with island journeys, kept<br>  Love-life in pulse and flame of sense and soul<br>  True as the alternation of the tides. <br>  Their talk, heart-eloquence upon the lips, <br>  Its temper fashioned by each scene, most gay<br>  Towards eventime, with fancies rainbow-winged<br>  In flight at objects far or near, as framed<br>  For their peculiar pleasures.  So the months<br>  Slid by delectably.--Then martial rouse<br>  Brake from a brawling trumpet off the shore, <br>  Sounded by squire of Arthur, from whose tongue, <br>  Rough as a war-cry, through these northern lands<br>  Under the ordinance of the Dragon King<br>  A tournament was cried at Lonazep: <br>  And with him, warlike as his precept, rode<br>  Swart Palomide. <br>  <br>                            It was a raw, cross day, <br>  As now and then will creep from Jutland's dunes, <br>  Possess the broad north sea, invade the isles. <br>  Mist, like a vast unrisen cloud clung close <br>  And hid the wave:  the forest-herds, the fields, <br>  Homesteads and mountain falls, as of the mist<br>  Drank silence, save when wet winds drave across<br>  Sharp as the sword of frost, with groans beneath<br>  As of the trouble of a soul.  Such sounds, <br>  Such stillness here, when Odin's knight was led<br>  Hither, as he was ever, by Isonde, <br>  And took his lodgment in the town--soul-sick<br>  And wearying of his weary, forlorn quest, <br>  More grieved to learn within such doleful lands<br>  Lived Belle Isonde. <br>  <br>                                      "She must draw me unto death;" <br>  He thought.  "Within this home of trampling clouds<br>  "It cannot be otherwise.  An if she die, <br>  "Death, and the quickest, were most sweet for me." <br>  At evening, sea-blown midnight took the town, <br>  Sealed hope in darkness, and for his resolve<br>  A demon-phantom travelled on the mist,-- <br>  To his perdition, held his soul in thrall. <br>  "An she must die, I shall die first, and now." <br>  Yet held he back his hand:  maybe, the morn<br>  Less palled with cloud, he might behold the keep<br>  Wherein Isonde:  the view, it might endear<br>  The dagger-thrust.  But with the morning came<br>  Winds from the hills, and clove the Jutland gloom, <br>  Which opening, rolling, closed again, but cleft, <br>  Ceaselessly hither, thither, rolled, till day<br>  Pierced through the mist-clouds' heavenward heights of gold: <br>  Wind, cloud and light, not dallying as at eve<br>  Desiring best to minister to joy: <br>  But strong, and bright, and swift each strove--whilst men<br>  Drew anxious breath as well they wot the fray<br>  Of fierce etherial hosts on their behoof<br>  For night or liberty of sunshine,--last, <br>  Lightness and brightness.  Paynim Palomide, <br>  Beholding with astonied countenance<br>  Mists moving, now revealing, now concealing, <br>  The knight divined a new world was being born. <br>  When last the life, the Joyous edifice, <br>  Flashed various colours o'er the ghostly cliffs, <br>  And at their feet the clinging earth showed rich, <br>  As void it never was that season's month<br>  Of wilding blooms, all floating on a sea, <br>  Which held their shadows as a thought of bliss<br>  Held in a lover's bosom, Palomide, <br>  This mighty and imperial Joyous Gard, <br>  Of glorious things of earth most glorious this, <br>  Unto his knightly soul:  and to his heart, <br>  To hold his heart's-hope in her loveliness<br>  The fitliest pile. <br>  <br>                                  When Tristram gat report<br>  How Upsal's knight was near, in rueful mood<br>  Still questing for Isonde, he sped his squire<br>  With welcome.--Nay.  That essay much too bold. <br>  To enter in the lodgment of his foe<br>  None may, endued with warrior's wariness. <br>  Whereon, the knight of Joyous Gard himself<br>  Brings his own welcome.  Still, the paynim's voice<br>  Wavering, eludes.  "Another time, perchance, <br>  "An this may be,--not now."  To which demur, <br>  Replying without sentence, Tristram's eyes<br>  Quickened with light of blameless Honour, threw<br>  Upon his countenance the strength and shine<br>  Of the heart's morning, whilst he gently caught<br>  The wanderer's left mid-finger, softly led<br>  Forthright to Joyous Gard.  Even thus was he, <br>  Whom iron scarce might hold, even by a touch, <br>  Lightest of any, taken that one way<br>  He needs must go by reason of his love<br>  For Belle Isonde. <br>  <br>                                 O, marvellous Joyous Gard, <br>  For Palomide!  The chambers of the keep; <br>  Aërial towers; their strength invincible; <br>  The sea-domain, its fair innumerous isles, <br>  With frequent waving woodlands clothed, more fai<br>  Than those which beautify thy native streams--<br>  Were all, as Odin for thy quest bestowed<br>  The brightest residence of Himmelberg, <br>  That paradise above the crossing swords, <br>  Of spirits doughtiest in Valkyrian deeds. <br>  O, Joyous Gard!  miraculous realm of joy<br>  For Palomide!  Or, in the morning hunt<br>  Ranging the greenwoods:  thorough sylvan del<br>  Musical as a rebeck from the rills<br>  Glinting amongst their shingles--over glades, <br>  Green velvet breadths whereon the rings were seen<br>  Of fairy revels:  joyous travail now<br>  For steed, and hound, and man to press right on, <br>  Right up the boulder-sprinkled slopes, and last, <br>  The game with slackened pace, hard breathed, finds last<br>  The roaring, rocky, eagle-haunted gorge<br>  Where closed abrupt the chase,--a gainless toil, <br>  For mirthful wonder,--nature's mind well shown<br>  To give her creatures heritage of peace<br>  And stern security from outward harm. <br>  --Or, on the homeward way, when he would find, <br>  Or seek, drawn by the prompting of Isonde, <br>  Beautiful spirit of that rare demesne, <br>  Felicities in every opening view; <br>  Grace, hiding in the green haunts of the fern; <br>  Cool sweetness breathed from mossy water-slips; <br>  Beneath the delicate shadows of the woods, <br>  Coverts, wherein the elves, preparing soon<br>  For dancing frolics pleasing to their queen<br>  Cynthia, and court of countless laughing lights: <br>  Smooth, shining pools, the water-lilies' home, <br>  Seen with her own eyes some few months agone, <br>  Large, silver shallops, which returned once more<br>  Spring would sail in them.--Or, Sir Tristram's voice<br>  Deep-toned and clear, bade pause their steeds, to note<br>  The clarion of a torrent from the cliff, <br>  Answering its brethren lost in distant caves; <br>  Or, mighty stag-horned oak which stood supreme<br>  With lordship of seven leagues of pastoral vale; <br>  Or, now it was an eagle in high air<br>  Majestical, peremptory king, and calm<br>  Throned in empyreal sapphire, ruling thence, <br>  Proud power predominant, the peaceful bounds<br>  Of these fair liberties of Joyous Gard. <br>  In every title of the law of peace. <br>  <br>  To roam at eve, fulfilled some new delights.-- <br>  Gentles, the high noon of the season this, <br>  The guardian hills assume their regal pomp,-- <br>  Their shoulders, length and depths down to the fields, <br>  Robed with imperial purple.  Season this, <br>  To feel the blamiest blisses of the heights. <br>  None lost by them.  When sunk the autumn day, <br>  Leaving an after-glow on wave and shore, <br>  A brightness brightening where day-shadows fell, <br>  Found was our company on heather slopes<br>  Entranced, mute-gazing at the seaward view. <br>  The landskip, sparkling emerald, lay beneath, <br>  Netted with silver brooklets from the hills, <br>  Sprinkled with lodge and hamlet, each the sign<br>  Of home and hospitality; green bowers<br>  Unchanged since spring:  far-scattered sea-lake isles: <br>  The castle's crowning, quivering, diamond gleam<br>  Above the calm, clear, interfluent wave<br>  Wherein, as beautiful, the upper-world<br>  Lay shadowed:  and, yet visible, afar, <br>  As streamers on the quiet, black-frost night, <br>  Restlessly wreathing foam-fringe, opal hues<br>  Embosomed in white lustrous clouds:--all this, <br>  Brought thoughts, and deep emotions, more than speech<br>  Could utter; left a happiness behind<br>  Deeper than any gift of loud delight. <br>  <br>  Such rovings ended, oft their steps attained<br>  By rocky ways one large, round mountain-mere<br>  Named Zeemerwater.  Well, you wot, a name<br>  Of blended tongues; as those who named it felt--<br>  "This water is so excellently fair, <br>  "Translucent, still--its virtues shall be known, <br>  "Hereafter, threefold-named whenever man<br>  "Shall mention it."  And virtuous is that truth. <br>  O, water!  water!  water!  threefold peace, <br>  And loveliness, and crystal light, still thine. <br>  Yea, when the dread nor-easter sounds--sole voice<br>  Whose anger reached the homes of Joyous Gard<br>  Or troubled dwellers in its halcyon years, <br>  Never this mountain lake bereft of peace--<br>  A fluctuating silver smile--nor more--<br>  Deranged its passionless tranquillity. <br>  <br>  Hereby, those friends at eventime would rest. <br>  Tristram lain at the feet of Belle Isonde, <br>  Fondling his lyre by that lone mystic mere, <br>  Their former joys re-blossomed:  Palomide<br>  Naught grieved, yea glad, for his own heart allowed<br>  The magic of the music, since for him<br>  Radiant-winged memories arose--Isonde, <br>  Still smiling on him through the lattice-green<br>  Within her Irish home.  To hear that strain, <br>  Flowers by the marge cast off the sleepy dew, <br>  Spread wide their petals as they felt fresh day, <br>  Yielded their morning incense, stirred their heads<br>  As amourous of the kisses of the wind: <br>  Then, softly-sailing murmurs told the bees<br>  Were on their noontide honied quest.--But, list! <br>  Floating athwart the surface of the wave<br>  Aërial symphonies--now heard--now gone, <br>  When Tristram pauses.  On his new-touched string--<br>  A coil of low, sweet harmonies reply<br>  As from flower-hidden fountains flowing.  Now, <br>  Unwinding o'er the waters, hither steal<br>  Mixed melodies--more rigorous when the strain<br>  Augmenting:  rising, falling--climbing high<br>  As lark may sing in air,--along the shore<br>  Now ranging audibly--and two-fold noise<br>  Swept through the music--in the woven tones<br>  Were tears and laughter. <br>  <br>                &amp;nbsp                          Whence these wondrous sounds? <br>  Whence?--Echoes from some region o'er the hills, <br>  Sore-smitten in one province,--revelry<br>  Within its civic borders--all here heard? <br>  Or, some invisible city in the air<br>  Festival in its groves, its lanes plague-struck--<br>  Its cries and joy-calls heard alike?  Or, whence? <br>  Asked Isonde and their guest.  Whereon, his heart<br>  Remembered, and the harper's fingers mute<br>  Fell on his knees, as he with sigh relates,-- <br>  "Beneath this mere, close-hedged by these its hills, <br>  "A city lived, a place of gladsome times, <br>  "Envied of demon-powers which sway the clouds. <br>  "These, on mid-summer's merriment, the day<br>  "Wherefrom the grace of sunshine ne'er removed, <br>  "So dear to the ascended Lord of Light--<br>  "The clouds brought hosts west, north, and south, and east. <br>  "Though succouring winds drave from the mountain heights, <br>  "Sharp-stricken by the arrows of the rain, they fell--<br>  "Hosts of the clouds prevailed, and forty days<br>  "Numbered of evil, every day as night, <br>  "Darkness, and roar of rain, and tumbling cliffs<br>  "Closing the high-roads from the dales.--Thenceforth, <br>  "No more the voice of lover or of bride: <br>  "Of the new father:  or of children's glee; <br>  "Of Christian praise; of chimes for even-song, <br>  "Or matins.--Only from this town o'er which<br>  "The waters keep an endless silver night, <br>  "Will issue, answering to my harp's sad soul<br>  "Commingling notes of ancient joys and woes, <br>  "Or, of themselves upon midsummer's day. <br>  "This heard I first within our keep:  since then, <br>  "Sought by me frequent, to my harping hand<br>  "Ever these waters, or the sky above<br>  "Have answered:  and, as I have known, ye hear, <br>  "Who now have token of the elements<br>  "And ask the tale."  And oft rehearsed that tale. <br>  Day's-travels done:  the mere attained:  the harp<br>  Sorcerous, drew spring around,--each listener's heart--<br>  As in the rose-lipped shell we hear its own<br>  Melodious memories--each listening heart<br>  Acquiring from the mingled sounds its own<br>  Harvest of love and pleasure from past years. <br>  Then would the old tradition speak once more. <br>  Yet why his invocation?--Still the truth<br>  For lover as for saint, that happiness<br>  Most sweet within the shadow of sorrow and pain. <br>  Hovering above the wave these threnodies, <br>  Entangled in bright festal songs, woke ruth, <br>  Woke piteous ruth, sharpening the sense of joy--<br>  As echoes sad from lands afar, whereon<br>  Thought might but briefly brood.  For here be none<br>  Of trouble, or of dread, or hopes which feed<br>  On life,--alone a passive happiness,-- <br>  Prime of the best bygone, with dews and light<br>  Best future e'er may give, its nourishment. <br>  The stars arisen, from Tristram's hand would fall<br>  Pathetic silence:  symphonies, and moans<br>  Subsiding, as the sound of evening bells<br>  Borne on the wind away--nor rose again--<br>  But gently sank and died; and last, were heard<br>  Voices as if in prayer, upon the hills, <br>  Which sent the friends with pensive pilgrim-pace<br>  To seek their castled bowers of sleep. <br>  <br>                                                           ***Seven times, <br>  Had ocean duly hymned his orisons<br>  Throughout the sacred, greater Morning Hours, <br>  With trumpet-voice,--unheard within the keep, <br>  So strong the silken toils of slumber held, <br>  Strangers to any care, who dwelt therein--<br>  But, now, its walls, in answer to the sun<br>  An orient blaze,--now, from the reefs out-rolled<br>  Midst dazzling vapours of their spray, the voice<br>  Majestical, was heard, to wake the choirs, <br>  Rivulets, torrents, birds and quivering leaves, <br>  The early ritual in the holy fane, <br>  All notes of morning praise--now, heard the voice<br>  By busied folk in Joyous Gard, alert<br>  For progress unto Lonazep ere noon. <br>  <br>  That pleasure-travel over, they arrived, <br>  La Belle Isonde, Sir Tristram, Palomide, <br>  Damsels and squires, late but not last, to find<br>  Logris from all her quarters sent her knights, <br>  With chiefest of the Table Round,--and, there, <br>  The Dragon King himself.  But on the view<br>  Of Isonde every fault forgiven, as told<br>  The king's heart in sonourous greeting, heard<br>  By every knight with new flame in the blood, <br>  By dames in mute dismay.  The fairest forms<br>  Upon her presence were despoiled of grace, <br>  And grace of loveliness,--yet each in pride, <br>  Or ruth, confessed, from knowledge or report<br>  The realm of sun-bright names could name but one<br>  Who should excel, or rival--Guinevere,-- <br>  Halting mid-way upon her journey hither, <br>  Cold, petulant, in Cardoyle's perfumed bowers. <br>  <br>  The morning of the gentle tournament<br>  Informed what zeal in this twofold emprise<br>  Of arms and beauty, now to be adjudged. <br>  Well seen, our Logris never has before<br>  Completed such a radiant company. <br>  On regal seat, o'er-canopied, the King--<br>  Power-president of the Table Round.  In form<br>  Still stately,--yet, no wavering of that hand, <br>  Noblest in Britain's kingly lines, which formed<br>  His age for nations to revere:  though hope<br>  O'erclouded in his eye, his saintly soul, <br>  Kept its auroral powers of light:  even as, <br>  Before the face of battle, now his face<br>  Shone beautiful at promise of the jousts. <br>  Close by the throne, high o'er the canopy, <br>  Heavily hung in drowsy crimson folds<br>  The Dragon Standard, yet to throw its flames<br>  On this field's valour.  Eager was the morn<br>  With country swarms, afoot or roughly horsed, <br>  From near and far:  which loved to see their king, <br>  To feel the battle-throes--when fought the knights, <br>  An' they without the barriers:  curious these--<br>  But those for tourney-raptures longing, shewed<br>  Proud in deport, with glittering arms, and plumes<br>  Gay-coloured, tossing on the rider's course, <br>  And shields of rich recognisance--their squires<br>  Bedight as fanciful as maids.  And, here, <br>  Within the balcon, either side the King, <br>  Of fair and dark, of grace and graciousness<br>  Such affluence as had left in silent glooms<br>  Half the land's lady-bowers, whose martial halls<br>  Have maintenance of princes, for these days<br>  Of their inheritance of loveliness <br>  Defrauded. <br>  <br>                          Chiefly in attire, this morn, <br>  The dames' contention.  Vivien held her worth <br>  Must overmatch the beauty of Isonde. <br>  So seen, and seen but enhance the day, <br>  She moved a fragrance breathed from orient bowers<br>  Thrown wide beyond her footsteps:  gay-beseen, <br>  Apparrelled as the meads, white, green, and gold, <br>  King cups and daisies, gleaming in the grass, <br>  When June's rose-breath o'ertakes the bloom of May,-- <br>  Symbolled in golden favours of her knights, <br>  Bright silks and pearls,--the subtle witch of taste, <br>  In visage and address demeaned herself<br>  Confident, gladsome, in her pride, as she<br>  Authentic daughter of the diamond keep. <br>  As she, so everywhere the balcon's freight, <br>  Odours diffused, and with the shine of robes<br>  Unparagoned in royal rooms, bewitched<br>  Wide o'er the barriers.  Women's best gift to men, <br>  Joy--from their delicate favours self-bestowed<br>  Insensibly in use,--but open guile<br>  Scarce less delectable,--although their speech<br>  Failed in its music, distance-lost, their eyes<br>  Might shower no splendours, to the common folk<br>  Outside the lists, the perfumed airs, and hues<br>  Of restless vestures told that women's gift<br>  Still prospered.  Faces fair, with dimpling smiles, <br>  Wantoned in tissues of all varied sheen: <br>  Those auburn, robed in sombre-shaded silks<br>  Withdrawn from Mecca:  others dark, arrayed<br>  In crimson Sendal:  but no place of note<br>  Held back its tribute,--gleaming garments sent<br>  From the enchanted looms of Provençal: <br>  Its lace of gold from Brittanie, as bright<br>  As fringe of evening clouds:  from pastoral Raines, <br>  By maiden hands these lissome vestures woven, <br>  Whose web had caught the love-light from their eyes, <br>  Vibrating with each motion:  but, or dark, <br>  Rose-red, or brown, or what apparel chosen, <br>  La Belle Isonde excels, though she appear<br>  In simple radiance of her native charms, <br>  Enrobed in lily-satin:  as a star<br>  Shone beauty's sceptred hand:  and when at length<br>  Unwimpling--noon brake full upon the morn, <br>  And murmurs from all tongues announce the spell<br>  Wrought by the living lustre of her hair<br>  And glory of her countenance. <br>  <br>                                                        But now, <br>  The voice of Lonazep affirms the hour<br>  Due for the tourney.  Beauty now requires<br>  Worship of arms.  Knightly confessions made<br>  Of ladye-love, the herald's trumpet rang<br>  Dressing each lance to rest; and this for death<br>  Or honour.  Palomide for death. <br>  <br>                                                             First seen, <br>  First feat was his.  Well-skilled, with slanting spear<br>  He entered helm and brain.  It was the prince<br>  Blown oversea from Armorica fell<br>  First sacrifice, whereby, the sable knight<br>  As earnest of his passion, potency, <br>  And deft exploit, this chiefest feat in arms<br>  Writ in the laws of chivalry, performed. <br>  All done in his obeisance to his queen; <br>  A service, in his trust--marked but by one, <br>  Since vailed with samite his recognisance, <br>  So none might read his heart.  Thenceforth, that day<br>  No might or craft withstood him.  Or the crown, <br>  Its lords, the balcon's beauty, knights arraigned<br>  For judgment, were as general lookers-on, <br>  Marvelling alike, as every thrust and stroke<br>  Won worship for the paynim.  His the brand<br>  Tempered within the secret icy springs<br>  Of Nifleheim, inscribed with magic runes, <br>  Fulfilled within this tourney:  but fulfilling, <br>  Hereafter, higher duty, subaltern<br>  To Tristram's chivalry of faith.  His lance, <br>  Won on a summer's noon beside the Ure, <br>  From an o'er-boastful baron of the court, <br>  So well, so often, had he proven its strength, <br>  That, by his gods, he sware, the strong tree's life<br>  Lived in that spear, and wroth thus foully rent, <br>  Inexorable sought the kind's heart-blood<br>  Which shore it from its home.  That sword and spear, <br>  The lightning, and the thunder, and the death <br>  Of battle rendered to the stricken lists. <br>  Strength grew with his puissant labour.  Knights, <br>  All men of proof, the passion of his spear<br>  O'erwhelmed or e'er their steeds gat time to fetch <br>  Their course upon a second joust:  or quelled, <br>  Stout though their arms and dazzling, by the swift<br>  Edge of that two-edged sword.  Thus, when was heard<br>  The chime of vespers from a chapel near<br>  Sounding to prayers, closing that royal play, <br>  The lists in every steel-scourged quarter shewed<br>  Ruin of harness, iron, silver, gold, <br>  Blood-tarnished havoc, without soul to give<br>  Life to the purposes of morn.  Ne'er since <br>  Those jousts in circuit of the northern king, <br>  When Norroy challenged Camelot, and red<br>  Ran Trent, ne'er in the loud seven years between, <br>  Carnage like this--but named I leave untold<br>  Not in despite, but pity, as I leave<br>  Those brightest, best of my own years, laid now<br>  In nameless sleep. <br>  <br>                                  Yet this puissant worth, <br>  Foreseen by jocund Dinadin, who sang<br>  His news as combatants rode forth, or fought, <br>  Or fell.  He noted Palomide at morn<br>  Mounting, make search for Belle Isonde, who found, <br>  As her laugh rang, he took it to his heart<br>  A tuneful answer, and his visage showed<br>  Effulgence, as the torse were on his brows--<br>  The stranger's trophy.  Dinadin wot well<br>  Whence fared with fiery courage Palomide <br>  From knowledge of the morn, and these his news--<br>  In winding, rhyming riddle ever sang<br>  With burden "'Tis his day, Love:  'tis his day!" <br>  The pageant ended, with a railing voice<br>  Disguised in dulcet numbers, o'er the lists<br>  Sir Dinadin proclaimed, as to defect <br>  Of Odin's Knight.  "The worship he hath won, <br>  "Faith, is begotten of the Queen Isonde! <br>  "Isonde in Joyous Gard, no prize had been <br>  "Thine, pagan.  Queen Isonde, makes this thy day." <br>  The mirth hereon, not more than on the beach, <br>  Weak-murmuring, sliding back within its wave<br>  The latest ripple of the flowing tide, <br>  Nor more the sound of mirth,--since Palomide<br>  Now knight-of-hearts through valour:  but they all<br>  Held breath, as he with reverence towards the king<br>  Unhelmed, performed his homage to Isonde. <br>  "I own the day not mine, great warrior-king. <br>  "My service lies where named:  through it, I vaunt--<br>  "Heard of the mightiest of thy Table Round--<br>  "I never did so much:  nor ever shall<br>  "In all life's battle-days:  and no knight here<br>  "May reach beyond my valiance--and its queen<br>  "She hath been named."  Sir Launcelot, straight replied, <br>  "Ye have done marvellously well these jousts: <br>  "How Love has led ye through, I understand: <br>  "Well have I known, Love is a goddess great: <br>  "For were my lady here, as she is not, <br>  "My parlance had not been amongst these dames<br>  "But where the spear and sword debate, whereon, <br>  "Pray, wit ye well, such worship Palomide<br>  "Should not have borne from us."  Even so, that day<br>  The paynim bore from all, from all received, <br>  His due degree. <br>  <br>                               This weight of honour earned<br>  To his despite in fealty to Isonde<br>  Pressed hard on Tristram's soul.  Day gone, his steps<br>  Forsook his bright pavilion, sought the dark<br>  For comfort of its cold and silence.  Naught, <br>  Answered his hot desires:  within the air<br>  The war-horse neighed, he heard the tourney-spears<br>  Ring in attaint, with moans from one defoiled. <br>  Asking the stars for peace, he saw in them<br>  Immortal memories of sorrow--none<br>  Within the twinkling hosts but heart of fire<br>  Restless, even as his own in agonies<br>  Born of another's glory. <br>  <br>                                         When morn shone<br>  For scenes of honour's throes and beauteous birth<br>  Of valiance,--discomposed, of clouded face, <br>  Thoughts fever-mad, he turned from Lonazep<br>  But that Sir Dinadin crossed him.  Ever free, <br>  From peevish cares, and heart-whole, Dinadin; <br>  This was the very spirit for the morn<br>  So dark in Tristram.  With his dancing eyes, <br>  Loud, fluting voice, as one who scorns a foe<br>  New-fallen, in utter praise he spake and sang<br>  Of Palomide:--Unconquerable in selle; <br>  Matchless in knighthood:  proven Valkyrian spear: <br>  Pure, golden branch of chivalry:  O, sword, <br>  Surpassing rare Excalibur:  swart prince, <br>  Outbraving Arthur's Ring, from heathenesse: <br>  For bounty, sufferance, largeness, courtesy, <br>  Pre-eminent star!  "My Tristram!  Lion-knight! <br>  "Where be his hiding!--Ah, mine eyes have found. <br>  "Shy, sighing truant."--Tristram moaned.  "Fool-knight, <br>  "Silence, fool-knight!  A war-worn man you see. <br>  "But anguish of the soul since yester-eve, <br>  "More than the doughtiest arms, this arm subdues. <br>  "I am un-knighted; now, must seek my own. <br>  "Far Lyonesse!  the martial pilgrim's shoon<br>  "Through ways of danger, pain, and penitence<br>  "Shall seek thee now.  The conscience of my love<br>  "Attainted in this land, my pride abates<br>  "Flight and desire.  But when I shall be known<br>  "By the loud breakers at my royal place, <br>  "Their boy-loved tones of battle-cheer, perchance, <br>  "Will re-awaken knighthood in me.  Go." <br>  To which Sir Dinadin his whistle blew, <br>  Shrill as when falconer shall provoke his bird<br>  To higher flight, and for Sir Tristram's ear<br>  This sally to his deepening hurt.  "Dear lord, <br>  "Be such thine orison?  A dame of cheer, <br>  "Known well to all, hath vowed the soaring lark<br>  "Singing, bestows her music of delight, <br>  "On which her heart will sing--and this, forsooth, <br>  "Because her lord was song.  A dame, you deem, <br>  "Of foolish cheer.  Then, pray her better wit! <br>  "Ah, sleep is still within thine eyes; the worse, <br>  "Wanting sleep in fair season.  O, thou art,-- <br>  "Late lion-spear, and lion-sword,--become<br>  "A sullen weed beside a stagnant pool: <br>  "A peacock parting with its plumes to magpies: <br>  "The royal beast that fled with fear to hear<br>  "Tromp of his doom in the loud ass's bray?" <br>  Black wrath in Tristram had that instant slain<br>  The scorner, but his hand unsatisfied<br>  Felt at the baldrick where his blade should hang. <br>  O'erborne by wrath, devoid of arms, he raised<br>  His fist of mail, when Dinadin great in voice, <br>  "There--there, the hopeful anger!  None of rest, <br>  "My new-awakened lord, till passion's powers<br>  "Have slaked thy thirst for honour and renown, <br>  "And made this day red-bright." <br>  <br>                                                        But now there calls<br>  The brazen beume; three strenuous blasts, whereon, <br>  The Dragon King, princes, dukes, knights, and squires<br>  Have dressed themselves unto the tourney-field, <br>  Whose golden galleries either side the throne, <br>  Ennobled with all beauty of the lands<br>  Seen yester-morn, shed airs of Persian groves<br>  Athwart the lists, as drew from western woods<br>  Soft breezes for their curious messengers.-- <br>  Blow, blow ye fragrant breezes!  from your bowers<br>  Bring hither healing calm for fevered hearts, <br>  Else storm of death, forboded by these clouds <br>  On Tristram's brow, shall make, O, Lonazep, <br>  Thy name a terror from this day.--And she, <br>  A sweet child of the dawn, in loveliness<br>  Appears to worshipful eyes again, her powers<br>  Unworn, wherever seen her countenance, <br>  Or heard that harp-toned voice.  And Vivien strove--<br>  Enchantments of her grace and elegance<br>  Consummate in their virtues wrought, nor failed. <br>  Hers, liberal light of smiles--hers, fashioned quaint<br>  Carnation raimnet, here and there a star, <br>  Emblem of passion and desire attained<br>  Suddenly, unexpected--as Ninon<br>  Avers most good in loves like hers--nor failed. <br>  For Mordred's voice affirmed--that wary bird, <br>  Fast kept in Vivien's net--when he beheld<br>  The prodigal glory of untempered knights, <br>  Surcoat and harness, helm and shield a-blaze<br>  With favours, make a garden of the field,-- <br>  "This day is Vivien's!" <br>  <br>                                         Other powers, Isonde's: <br>  Whose grace for Tristram, fell no more aslant<br>  On other knight:  but in meridian shone<br>  Full on her very Tristram.  Heart of Love! <br>  O, vehement Honour!  Kindled all their fires, <br>  Tristram his pageant played so wondrously, <br>  The battle-proven Arthur, and his peers, <br>  Barons--whose long life-sport had been the wars: <br>  Those dames, familiar with the nimblest feats<br>  Achieved for empery of their favours; folk, <br>  Who always love the roughest shock, and blow<br>  The ruddiest and most fell, joined common voice<br>  Lauding the Knight of Lyonesse.  His course--<br>  Each, every blow, and turn, and thrust--his strength, <br>  His long-breathed valour--like were marvelled at. <br>  Through that wide-wasting holiday of blood<br>  He drave as though the valiance of a realm<br>  Intrusted to his shock:  smote, as the jousts<br>  Were called for him alone:  throughout that day<br>  His one hand held the torment of deep wounds, <br>  Sweet mercy of quick death the other held, <br>  His heart, forgiveness on the pleading voice--<br>  Such grace has ever heart of love!  That day, <br>  Sore-travailled, he nor changed nor brand, nor lance, <br>  Nor martial weeds:  first to begin was he, <br>  He last to end:  unresting he, like death<br>  The reaper, through the lists went first and last. <br>  A piteous field in its high revelry! <br>  Or seen the mighty in their agonies, <br>  Or those, the flowers of morn--now spread, wan-hued, <br>  To beautify these direful jousts.  The spear, <br>  Approved of Love and Honour, through him smote<br>  Recognisant of both; their sword, nor swerved, <br>  But struck and striking answered in each blow<br>  As to the grave confessing:  midst all praise<br>  None might appraise his Honour and his Love, <br>  None the puissance of that arm elect, <br>  Nay, nor its gentle knightliness:  its deeds, <br>  Attended by acclaim of truthful words, <br>  Doubled the deeds Sir Palomide had done. <br>  Which great acclaim, woke frenzy in that knight; <br>  Perplexity, and sorrow of soul--despair<br>  So wild and sightless, as in dreams he hove<br>  Apart the tourney:  but three times drawn back<br>  By fiend begotten of disordered thoughts, <br>  Three times had slain Sir Tristram treasonously. <br>  Three times o'ermatched his jealousy of hate, <br>  By jealousy of love in Launcelot,--once, <br>  Spared by the pity in Sir Tristram's spear; <br>  Twice, in its pitying sorrow; thrice, forgiven<br>  In sorrowing pity by his spear and sword, <br>  And vailed from common ken the knight's reproach<br>  By Tristram in his honour's courtesy, <br>  Which sought some utterance in its knightly speech, <br>  Resting upon his last essay.  "This time, <br>  "Launcelot, in thee puts forth its brightest flower. <br>  "Above the lists, our heavens are pure and fair: <br>  "So shines thy knightliness of heart on me. <br>  "Well is it, when we love.  The dust of life<br>  "Shines golden,--accident, or strife, or pain<br>  "Be golden blessings--or we lose or thrive, <br>  "If in the light of love.--But happier far, <br>  "Attended by the vigilance of one<br>  "Whose love is as this knightly love of thine. <br>  "'Tis of the angel-hosts."--But there was snapt<br>  His rising speech, as oft his harp when load<br>  With note too fine for human ears--for spake, <br>  Abrupt, with hurried tremble in his voice, <br>  The knight of knights, the knight of Guinevere, <br>  First name and disrepute of knightlihood, <br>  The knight, whose heart had grown grey before his beard, <br>  All, all through Love--with hurried, trembling voice, <br>  Launcelot, distraught, remorseful as he heard, <br>  Yet dazzled by the glory as he heard<br>  Words all too kind, and glory in his soul<br>  Kindling thereon, fulfilled in haste of speech, <br>  "None may contest thy day.  This day is thine, <br>  "By the divinity of love, whose faith<br>  "We serve.  Another day the jousts be mine, <br>  "Mine, then, thy present grace--which worthiest, they, <br>  "The angel-hosts, may judge.  Nearest our king, <br>  "I see thy inspiration.  Wanting one, <br>  "Now hid in Cardoyle's bower,--she claims my heart<br>  "In worship.  By St. Michael, unto me<br>  "The rarest covenant of beauty made<br>  "Between earth's dust and immortality, <br>  "Is she, thy fair Isonde:  well-worth this field <br>  "O'erwrought with jeopardy.  With this reserve--<br>  "Wanting of one--none in our royal halls<br>  "Compare with thy Isonde.--But whose large form<br>  "Sweeps like an eagle on the jousts?"  This while, <br>  As clouds in breaking up, go down the wind<br>  On different ways, the folk of all estates<br>  Were so departing, but in haste returned<br>  When rode a knight from south, as one kept late<br>  And yet must keep his pledge. <br>  <br>                                                        Entered the lists, <br>  Nimbly he drew his rein before the king; <br>  Displayed the blazon of his shield--a sword<br>  Within a heart.  The black indented shield, <br>  The sword, the bleeding heart, spake terrible<br>  The will of him their bearer.  With slow hand, <br>  The knight availed and showed his face, a face<br>  Full-earnest, but a peach-bloom face:  his height<br>  And thews of giant brood:  but when he spake, <br>  Greeting the throne of Arthur, he was known, <br>  Scarce more than eunuch-voiced.  His name, it fell<br>  From Belle Isonde's white, tremulous lips,--the Knight<br>  Of Peril,--and it was as winds had caught<br>  Her words, so swiftly, widely noised his name. <br>  "Good news; good news; great news; to end the day. <br>  "Fair Knight of Peril, he will give us news<br>  "Of stiffer service than have known these jousts: <br>  "An' brave Sir Tristram, he must answer them." <br>  But Isonde's fear now gone, as to herself, <br>  Her royal kinsfolk heard her murmur thus:-- <br>  "Truly, thou art a god of breathing gold<br>  "To those within Tintagel:  but not that<br>  "Shall save thy body from the iron's law<br>  "Striving with flesh, and ruling these our days." <br>  <br>  Amazement troubled either gate, when seen<br>  The Knight of Peril his obeisance make<br>  Before the Beautiful, then turn in scorn<br>  Whilst to the herald's challenge he confessed, <br>  "Vivien!"  For three-score heart-beats in the lists<br>  Deep silence of surprise, when once again<br>  Spoke Peril's Knight, "Here, an' so help me God, <br>  "St. Martin, and my ladye!  I acquit<br>  "My pledge given Cornwall's king,--from France returned, <br>  "To Cornwall's joy returned--before seven days<br>  "Brought hence shall traitor-Tristram's heart appease, <br>  "As naught else may, his sleepless wrath.  On Love, <br>  "I call--known queenly as I am named, as known <br>  "Alike by kings, knights, squires; an' call on them, <br>  "Now, to approve my pledge."  For Vivien's ear, <br>  Mordred aloud,--"Christ's mercy, how the folk<br>  "Be tamed!  Where, be their eager, hungry shouts<br>  "For Tristram?  Still the morning's counsel holds<br>  "Best for these after-hours:  an' holds my faith, <br>  "This yet be Vivien's day--sweet Vivien's day!" <br>  <br>  Fire sprang from Tristram's eyes as he bade speed<br>  Divide the sunshine of the falling noon<br>  Between them.  Nor, the smiles of Belle Isonde, <br>  Nor Arthur's waving hand of grace, assuaged<br>  The risen tide of anger, as with tones<br>  Learnt from the torrents of the hills, our Knight<br>  Of Lyonesse,--"I hear thee call on Love. <br>  "Love answers from the dust.  Dire Anteros, <br>  "Hath claimed thee!  Now, to Lonazep hath brought<br>  "Tintagel's ribald shame for doom--with laud<br>  "Of honour.  Of thy kindred, sadly known, <br>  "None hold with men of worship:  thou, too, known<br>  "As light-o'-love, a curse to honest dames:-- <br>  "Of thine and thee, that brand--but, now, their brand, <br>  "Ever-remembered from this hour to be, <br>  "Drawn by this spear.  Weakling, you deem, in me<br>  "A knight-forewearied by this battailous day, <br>  "Of which, due-born of thunder, shall its fame<br>  "Run through the confines of these realms.  My arm<br>  "Upstayed by honour still--but, say thee sooth, <br>  "Need none, for yonder smirking squire, this eve<br>  "Unlace thy harness."  Then, they made their course: <br>  So well demeaned--they clashed--and in mid-lists<br>  Both spears were burst--yet in his selle each knight<br>  Unmoved--composed as they had toyed with straws. <br>  Whereon in wrath, as though his word were broke, <br>  His lance so breaking, Tristram leaped to ground; <br>  "I have no second spear," he hoarsely cried, <br>  In drawing of his sword, "Behold this blade! <br>  "Though thine the armour of Bordeaux thrice-proven, <br>  "Such cunning shall its lightning-edge now wreak, <br>  "As folk shall wot the vagaries of thy life<br>  "Rehearsed in death--their marvel, and my praise--<br>  "Direct dishonour unto thee."  He smote<br>  Tintagel's champion, sharp, inscrutable blows--<br>  The poignant sword-light was beheld, nor more, <br>  Besides arms falling into hasty ruins. <br>  Then, Tristram's supple wrist and subtle play<br>  Carved tediously the flesh of Peril's Knight, <br>  Morsel by morsel, as to the seventh death<br>  For sacrifice:  last, with three diverse blows<br>  He hewed his body that his heart leaped out, <br>  And horror fell on all estates to know<br>  Fulfilment of such wrath, on which the king<br>  Hand-screened his eyes, and with his right held forth<br>  The peace-commanding sceptre.  So that day, <br>  Crowned by Sir Tristram with red-hilted sword, <br>  Its proud degree his own. <br>  <br>                                                                     What time morn's light, <br>  A spring of yellow broom before the rose<br>  Flames fuller season, and contrary sprites, <br>  Eager for day, or wearying of the dark, <br>  These brightest and those saddest, early risen, <br>  Cry, "Lo, the day appears!"  the Dragon King<br>  Walked midst the knights' pavilions, where he heard<br>  Sir Tristram's harp, awakened by the dawn. <br>  Said he, whilst passing--"That is as the voice<br>  Of some rare lady sounding in mine ears." <br>  Whereon, the harper, hearing this, bespake<br>  His knightly fellow.  "Arthur hearkened.  Thou, <br>  "So hearkening, if of love were thine to hear, <br>  "So hearkening, I had said, fair knight, to thee, <br>  "My Lady Isonde's voice spake from the strings<br>  "When at her matins within Joyous Gard, <br>  "The peace of happy sleep still held by prayer<br>  "Asleep within her heart.  But thou, fair knight, <br>  "Hast not love's hearing."  Unto which, the man, <br>  "An' I may speak, more truly may I speak<br>  "Than harped voice.  This day, thy Belle Isonde<br>  "Shall little gain of peace, and gaining not, <br>  "Make this a dolorous day for thee.  And this, <br>  "Through shallow peace of Joyous Gard." <br>  <br>                                                   These jousts, <br>  Last, first in fame, at Lonazep, were named<br>  The Jewel Tournament; when dames desired, <br>  And damsels deemed the time was opportune, <br>  To shew their treasures--heirlooms, fulgent spoils<br>  Of heathen thrones, offerings through blood and pain, <br>  From foreign realms, by knighthood hither borne--<br>  Compacted wealth in gems:  and, furthermore, <br>  Consecrate to the Table Round, this day. <br>  Of this, I name but of the sacred twelve, <br>  Who then appeared.  The aged Geraint, whose lance<br>  Reposed against the throne, since oft that throne<br>  In bygone times of dread attained repose, <br>  Alone from Geraint's spear; and Caradoc, <br>  Of the three faithful lovers of the Ring, <br>  An exiled star for long, who now returns<br>  From that green burgh, down-sloping to the main, <br>  Where ladye-love, most dear, dwells in her halls, <br>  To whom not long ere he returns:  Owaine, <br>  Bewitched with pomp and blazonry of arms<br>  Lightest in heart among the warrior-three; <br>  With secret Aron, solitary, renowned<br>  For artful valour:  and, of lute-like tongue, <br>  Gilded Gawaine, born on the southern downs<br>  Amidst the primrose, and as boy and man<br>  His nature wanton, but a heartening spear<br>  When fortune at her rudest; crowning all, <br>  Gleamed Launcelot's cross of red, and eager-eyed<br>  Sir Tristram's argent lion, he himself<br>  In silver panoply, to show his cause<br>  Pure, single honour.  Adversaries fierce<br>  For martial meddle, drew to Lonazep, <br>  Children of wild repute, their courage known<br>  To Arthur's Table:  spears from heathenesse, <br>  Beyond the four salt floods:  from Calydon, <br>  Beneath whose lofty, bare-stemmed, bush-topped pines<br>  Dwell serpents of the fiend:  and knightly blooms, <br>  New-sprung since Marhaus, from Ierne's shores<br>  With gold-fringed lips, alike for love alert, <br>  Or dauntless battle-cry:  and swarthy-faced, <br>  Their hate devised upon their shields, knights ten<br>  From Marches of North Galis:  nor had failed<br>  The liberties of Richmondshire to send<br>  Her company of valour:  nor had failed<br>  Deira's wolvish lords.  For knightly cheer, <br>  And to outbrave report of byegone jousts, <br>  All shewed as new as Lonazep's first day,-- <br>  Knights in the gorgeous housing of their steeds<br>  And harness of the war, and carven twain<br>  New curiously gilded galleries<br>  Contained the dames, whose silent Tournament <br>  Of Jewels resounded throught their times as loud<br>  As tourney feats--since well it might--that shew<br>  Of gem-besprinkled raiment, lustrous gems<br>  Kindling upon white fingers, bosoms, arms, <br>  Or pendant from the shell-like pale pink ear, <br>  Accessory unto other charms,--what charmed<br>  Before, now doubly charms--each dame more fair<br>  Than on each former day, as beauty here<br>  Flourished on valour. <br>  <br>                                         Chief, La Belle Isonde, <br>  Enriched with hues known of that earliest spring<br>  Beheld by her in Joyous Gard:  loose-robed<br>  In silken amethyst from hem to throat, <br>  Topaz and chrysoprase her gems, of flowers<br>  Of souvenance and promise fairest sign<br>  And of young greening days,--these in her hair<br>  A shining chaplet--those, a beating light<br>  Upon her bosom.  Vivien in her sport, <br>  Showed none of native colours:  such, her maid<br>  Amidst the rural throngs ordained to wear--<br>  False yellow, whereby lost her gaysome charms<br>  Of sun-brown cheeks, those founts of fire, dark eyes, <br>  And golden jewels drowned in yellow folds--<br>  Nor worse, nor better, than when amber clouds<br>  With evening stars between, their mutual glow<br>  Lost in each other:  but that fallen star, <br>  Vivien, with thought on Tristram still, enrobed<br>  In ample sendal of the emerald's sheen, <br>  Bedashed with gems of liquid light as dews<br>  In morning grass, and of that light there hung<br>  A princedom, shining in each ear.  Around, <br>  Those in the worship of herself, or those<br>  In worship of the knight on whom her guiles<br>  Were now adventuring, jasper on their brows<br>  Figured in circlets of bright flexile gold, <br>  Or in the necklace wavering:  no attire<br>  Amidst the sunny flock, but there beheld<br>  Of green of meads and mountains, chrysolite<br>  And beryl, sparkling in some quaint device. <br>  Others, who angled for themselves, displayed<br>  More varied shews, and none bewitching more<br>  Than mutable, flying colours, worn by those<br>  Unstable in opinion--opals, chief, <br>  With faltering hues which never ceased to gleam: <br>  Those pledged to knights, well known their firm intent, <br>  Those pure, in samite fair, as washed in white<br>  Chalcedony attired, with silver bloom<br>  Of pearls, as lacking gems:  maids, in desire, <br>  Marked by their violent colours--many a heart<br>  In the hot blaze of garnets told its own<br>  Consuming passion:  milder loves, wore gems<br>  Sea-green, or of the Lydian stone, whose gloom<br>  Gave fairer lustre to the fairest fair--<br>  And amethyst, which cheeks of rosy-red<br>  Makes lovelier, as the violet lain beside<br>  The fragrant maiden's-blush.  Those crystal stones, <br>  Imperial diamond, reserved shone sole<br>  O'er Arthur's brows, and twain from Central Ind, <br>  Whose price were empires, cunningly were set<br>  Eyes in the Dragon of the Throne. <br>  <br>                                                          These shews, <br>  I name, aware, nor ever in this realm before, <br>  Nor since, so beauty in victorious pride<br>  Adorned:  fires answering fires, as on the hills<br>  The beltane flames, through all the galleries<br>  The jewels blazed that day, a light of fame<br>  Which beamed through centuries of this realm, nor yet<br>  Paled in its colours. <br>  <br>                                      Ere these jousts began, <br>  A private word reached Lonazep:  therewith, <br>  A golden ring, assurance whose the word<br>  For Launcelot; whereupon, he called his squire; <br>  Armed--sought the tourney--well-surmised by all, <br>  Queen Guinevere had made him new of heart. <br>  So ere devoir was paid to Belle Isonde, <br>  Sir Tristram knew his love must have debate<br>  With Launcelot's love, all knew dread time was near<br>  When love debateth love.  Four hours, the storm<br>  Of thunder-hoofs, of martel, spear and sword, <br>  With crimson showers of death, raged through the lists. <br>  And Table Round held glory in account. <br>  No more the heathen number in their hosts<br>  That score of martial manhood,--prey of lance<br>  Thrust through the gates of endless sleep.  How vain, <br>  In valour's morn, Ierne's chivalry<br>  Shewed blazonry of beauty on its shields, <br>  With lightsome war-cry, "Rashness cancels fear!" <br>  The dark encounter answers, "Death."  The tromp<br>  Which sounds the onset is the tromp of doom<br>  To savage Calydon, Deiras wolves, <br>  And knighthoods from North Galis and the vales<br>  Which lie around the Ure.--But not without<br>  Their rigorous recompense.  Owaine was reached<br>  By Gallcoit's northern lance:  and Caradoc<br>  Gat Irish favour from Prince Gwittart's brand, <br>  For which his ladye-love must be his leech, <br>  Else his an early burial; with these two, <br>  Gilded Gawain's life-stream shines i' the sun, <br>  An' so the more his frolic spirit darkens: <br>  Whilst Aron hurt by Andegavion's knight, <br>  Pleads for the sacrament.  Amidst this toil<br>  Of tourney-festival, Sir Launcelot won<br>  Surpassing honour; Tristram's knightly star<br>  Ascending still--his service sadly shewn<br>  In noble peers o'erthrown, and praise which rang<br>  Louder than martial welcomes.  As he went, <br>  His yester-noblenesse he crowned with feats<br>  Excelling all that day, as did that day<br>  Excel the valiance of the opening jousts. <br>  Then met the twain; and from the noon-song hour<br>  Till nearing time of vespers, these twain held<br>  Their joyous meddle.  Still within their strength, <br>  Although the strength within their blows had been<br>  Even as their strength of love:  who might prevail<br>  None might propose:  nor either of those dames, <br>  Guinevere nor Isonde, in these their knights<br>  Suffered reproach of valour:  nor could tongue<br>  Diminish aught of glory each attained. <br>  These brother-hearts of chivalry, so left, <br>  As now attained;--since sable Palomide, <br>  Poisoned in soul, disloyally designed<br>  Once more, a covert stroke on Tristram's life--<br>  Whereof, espied by Launcelot, stern he bade<br>  His knightly brother's sword surcease, and called<br>  With voice fired by death's passion.  "Son of Lok! <br>  "Base pagan!  Of the northern serpent born. <br>  "Defouled with falseness and a treasonous will, <br>  "These lists require thee!  I, within the lists! <br>  "Assail with thy best courage, or my mail<br>  "Sufficeth to repulse thee:  with best arms<br>  "Defend thee, or my stroke shall cleave thy steel, <br>  "An' give thy soul to night.  Thy foe, these hours<br>  "Hath worship of his valour won beyond<br>  "Our martial brotherhood of Camelot. <br>  "An' two long, deathly days, thine honour won<br>  "So hardly, he hath shorn and made as naught. <br>  "Ride forth, avenge its wrong on me--his foe<br>  "These jousts:  on me, or ere my knightly fere<br>  "Exclude my service.  Pagan, son of Lok! <br>  "Abide my challenge."  Whilst Sir Launcelot spake, <br>  A breeze arose, and now and then of dust<br>  A cloud passed sighing through the tournament, <br>  Opening the standard-folds above the king<br>  Wherein the Dragon moved. <br>  <br>                                                     Sir Tristram claimed<br>  This last adventure,--but with change of cheer, <br>  The lustre of his armour changed--not morn's <br>  But evening's light it shewed--approaching gloom, <br>  Leading to shades of stillness, which the eye<br>  Of Arthur marked, with anguish in his heart. <br>  And when the knight of Odin rode the lists<br>  In ebon harness, no applausive noise<br>  Rang welcome--silence of eventful change<br>  O'ercast the tourney,--on his sable steed, <br>  Lord of dark silence rode the pagan knight. <br>  <br>  He paused.  His urgent spear within its rest<br>  Swayed to and fro, as if from playful thoughts. <br>  None such were his.  That, is the spear of hate! <br>  Gentle its motion, yet it yearns for strife, <br>  Sealed with dark death's assurance.  Now a cloud<br>  Surged o'er the barriers:  and the eddying dust<br>  Hung round the knight, as when is seen that cliff<br>  Mist-robed, above the Leeza's reedy marge, <br>  Solitary of its mountain-girdled vale, <br>  The Pillar named.  On mid-October noon<br>  So clothed its heights with hoary, tumbling mists, <br>  That cliff, reverberate, with its thunder-voice<br>  Gives answer to the tempest:  such the tone<br>  Proceeding from the cloud that clothed the knight. <br>  "I here require thee, by thy knighthood's faith, <br>  "Bestow my boon!"  As message from the breeze<br>  That word sprang through the tourney's purlieus,--heard<br>  With hard heart-sickness.  Otherwise, hath heard<br>  The Dragon of the Standard.  On the staff<br>  The silken folds heave heavily--now seen<br>  The Dragon's angered head--now sailing wings<br>  Beheld--but spent the breeze, it hides itself<br>  Within its former sleepy lair--and, now, <br>  Lifting, unfolding, gleaming, high it swirled<br>  Above the throne, then with sharp sound shot out<br>  Its battle-roaring grandeurs o'er the lists. <br>  As menacing clang of sword upon the shield<br>  Ere fray begins, Sir Tristram's voice.  "What boon, <br>  "Is thine to claim?"--"The boon of thine own vow<br>  "Besought by Cornwall's queen.  I ask thy spear." <br>  O, woe, such treasonous wiles, the viper-brood<br>  Of Palomide's crossed love!  Woe, to our knight, <br>  Questioning the message with sore-stricken heart. <br>  As one submerged, in losing hold of life<br>  His inner eye surveys a tract of years, <br>  Their long-lost incidents in shapes and hues, <br>  Alive with old significance:  so, now, <br>  The paynim's speech, a wave of death, shut out<br>  As sunk in midnight dark the tourney-scene, <br>  And clear before Sir Tristram's inner sight<br>  Appeared a time and place late-past--one bower, <br>  In Joyous Gard.  The noon-tide casement trick't<br>  With jasmin sprays--the sunbeams in the room<br>  Sundered in stars--that amorous hour now his. <br>  He felt the sharp, sweet kisses of the sea; <br>  Within his heart the favours of that time, <br>  Of love and knightliness,--for Palomide<br>  Was there, the guest:  and she, the Beautiful<br>  Whose voice more soft than ocean's murmurous caves, <br>  More musical than chime of Angelus, <br>  From its far island fane, to tell the hour<br>  Of praise and love--a voice more than its words<br>  Sweet as they were; to Tristram's dreamful ear<br>  A sound of dear melodious memories,-- <br>  Was heard--now silent--now with fervency, <br>  Spake suddenly, "To honour this fair time, <br>  "Thy graciousness, thy hospitality, <br>  "Thy valorous gentleness, good Tristram, yield<br>  "Our guest a boon!  a loving boon of worth. <br>  "The corner stone, the flowery capital, <br>  "The heart and beauteous visage of thy faith<br>  "Chivalrous, may not lack its worship here. <br>  "A boon!  a boon!"--"Aught but thyself, my soul." <br>  Answers her knight.  "What claim'st thou, Palomide?"-- <br>  "No boon this hour desires but its own bliss. <br>  "When fortune veers and mischance mine, then thou<br>  "The imperfections of a troubled will<br>  "May help.  Or then, the boon, perchance, thy spear." <br>  O, mischief hiding in a living wish! <br>  O, bounteous spirit, whose joy provides the sting<br>  To slay thee, undisguised!  The fates now call. <br>  That reverenced hour slid by, its fair delight<br>  Drunk by each heart as from the chalice of life<br>  Its richest wine:  and since that reverenced hour<br>  To this, nought of its words, which now arose<br>  With ghostly call for Tristram's doom.--The scene<br>  In sight and sound, lived with him crystal-clear<br>  As to the spirit of a drowning man; <br>  And Palomide was ware the lion-lance<br>  Drooped in surrender for his craven boon,-- <br>  The liberal, love-gift boon, made deadly boon--<br>  Which made his time for gain. <br>  <br>                                                     He spurred his steed: <br>  With "Isonde!" on his lips, he spurred his steed<br>  To Tristram's death, whose soul enwrapt in love<br>  Played with its lineage of fair joys which bound<br>  That hour of Joyous Gard--that hour now here.-- <br>  Isonde!--Her name rings music since the morn--<br>  Writ crimson by him through the day--the hour<br>  Isonde's!  There came the inspiration!--Quick, <br>  Answering the hastening of the brazen hoofs, <br>  Rising upon his stirrup vehemently, <br>  Tristram bestowed his boon.--"Thou hast my spear!" <br>  O'erthwart the tournament's blood-sloken space<br>  Forthright the spear, which in its passage sang<br>  As on a lurid morn, the seven witch-elms<br>  Above the pass of norland Atäfors<br>  Sing in the storm, or e'er, foredoomed, it smites<br>  Field, wood and thorpe within the dales below. <br>  Sharp-singing, underneath the Dragon's roar, <br>  The spear, midway his course, caught Palomide<br>  As with the cumulative strength of all <br>  Its green and growing years, by him received<br>  As fate's own shaft:  nor armour of defence, <br>  Nor warding gauntlet's art availed--the shaft<br>  Bestowed death's twilight.  He down-driven to earth, <br>  Not answering to the herald's second call, <br>  The haught day's fortune, given as diadem<br>  Of Lonazep's three days, was then proclaimed; <br>  And these twain martial brethren, as in love<br>  In arms, Launcelot and Tristram, these receive<br>  The day's degree, the diadem-degree. <br>  Even as the praise and wonder of the world<br>  Their ladies' beauty:  thus, to them assigned<br>  Honour of valour, eminent o'er knights <br>  And Table Round.  But, with his helmet doffed, <br>  Launcelot unto the king:--"Of all the knights, <br>  "Good king, we number in our honour's guild, <br>  "My brother-peer select, the perfect flower. <br>  "That grace, I may not here dispute, divide, <br>  "Abridge--since, ye may learn it from the folk, <br>  "Had not this Palomide disturbed our fray<br>  "With infidel guile, on which no sentence more, <br>  "Since his the leech's inquest for his harm--<br>  "My royal brother, Knight of Lyonesse, <br>  "Sir Tristram, had maintained throughout this day<br>  "On me, his jewelled honour.  And, therewith, <br>  "My soul accords--as gladsome as nine jousts<br>  "Her glory, yielding Tristram the degree." <br>  Was it the breeze, or came it from her heart<br>  That quickening of Belle Isonde's hair, when heard<br>  The speech of Launcelot?  Straightway, she uprose<br>  As to approve his finding, when uprose<br>  Rejoicing thunders from the barriers.  Not <br>  Sir Tristram's valour, nor Sir Launcelot's free, <br>  Full-hearted graciousness, but sudden view<br>  Of this the lion's inspiration, queen<br>  Of chivalry and beauty, brought that joy<br>  Thus mightily on the lists.  Then, Hesper's lamp<br>  Westward, now lightening the grey gates of even, <br>  Closing the tourney, all the knightly throng<br>  Blew unto lodging, and their diadem-prize<br>  And praise were given our peer.  And thus was kept<br>  The tourney-tryst of Lonazep. <br>  <br>                                                             But thoughts<br>  More foul than Palomide's:  and hearts more smooth--<br>  Though humorous in delight--than Belle Isonde's<br>  Or Tristram's:  and excelling Launcelot's eyes<br>  In searching evil--there were thoughts abroad, <br>  And laughing hearts, and eyes of piercing ken, <br>  That earnest day. <br>  <br>                          At opening of the jousts, <br>  Sir Dinadin tricked out with dress and paint<br>  As grim and grinning gargoyle, lent his mirth<br>  Within and out the barriers:  oft the gems, <br>  Twinkled to note his travestie of sport, <br>  Obeisance, pageant, essay:  oft their lights<br>  Brake into tinkling laughter-rills, whenas, <br>  Curt sentence dropt among them acid-sweet<br>  With double-ending rhymes.  But, now, as eve<br>  Lifting within high heaven her star of peace, <br>  No singing-tourney prowess might be his, <br>  Angered, on Tristram's thrice-approved degree, <br>  He poured the venom of the day, more keen<br>  Through his unshaken humours; which, thrice-told<br>  Nor moved the lion-knight,--he cried,--"You go<br>  "To hear the fool-talk, make one in fools'-play. <br>  "Go.--Thinking good most evilly, since, unknown<br>  "Things with their sober faces,"--"Dinadin! <br>  "The bells of Dagonet you have usurped<br>  "Throughout this tourney, nor have rung them well. <br>  "Too much of fool upon thy tongue.  Shall I<br>  "Call thee fool-Dinadin?  Which were more truth, <br>  "Than thy devisings of a courtly throng<br>  "Now gathering from the borders of the field<br>  "Of death and honour.  All day, hast thou been<br>  "In trouble as the pot upon the fire, <br>  "And, now, ye bubble hot phrase meaningless<br>  "In such thy mood."--"List, an' I speak ye calm. <br>  "And slow my voice, and clear, to speak proud words<br>  "Of burning glory.  These twain days, men know, <br>  "Thy valour as the valour of seven.  Ay, more; <br>  "The ghostly memories of our mighty wars<br>  "Will perish on the lips, whenever heard<br>  "These jousts of Lonazep.  But was all glory, <br>  "All this day?  Mordred,--ye would note,--I trow, <br>  "Of many colours were his company<br>  "In petticoats.  Ye noted.  Him I heard, <br>  "Hissing his single phrase maleficent, <br>  "Of fray in which he hath defect.--'My King, <br>  "'Your King, in suffering shame obscure, unnamed, <br>  "'Abates not in his general laud and smile. <br>  "'Approving best hot revelry in arms, <br>  "'He keeps vile lust of blood keen in his Ring. <br>  "'Weeds of the carnage his surpassing boast. <br>  "'Ah me, how blind men be:  none wot he keeps<br>  "'The secrecy of monarchs, who have tamed<br>  "'The fierce blood of their kindred, and must keep<br>  "'The salt taste of the blood full-well provoked<br>  "'Within his the belt of valour.  Blood!'  Dames heard; <br>  "An' those who wore their pledges heard.--God's peace, <br>  "Adding one to one ye marvelling cry, 'five!'<br>  "Forgotten three slides in, an'darkens faith. <br>  "Mordred is more than Mark, much more--much less, <br>  "Than Vivien.  This day, sheen of gems and smiles--<br>  "Around her feet the shades.  Sly sorceress! <br>  "Mark,--Mordred--other shrouded forms, I see, <br>  "(The carrion on her way) who work her wish--<br>  "Dominion.  As o'er Merlin, laid in sleep<br>  "Beneath the white thorn in Broceliande<br>  "Her prey in body and soul--she, o'er these days, <br>  "Valiance and blaze of lauds of Lonazep<br>  "A death-cloud permanent, as death o'er life, <br>  "O'er pride and puissance of Logris.--Knight! <br>  "May sleepers in the sepulchre awake<br>  "Before the judgment tromp?  An' be it so: <br>  "Her little, little laugh shall stir the dust<br>  "Above her face-cloth, when these faded realms<br>  "Be truly heathenized.  Last, for myself. <br>  "The present has its own.--Go, priests to church; <br>  "Knights to repair their hurt, or some to seek<br>  "Opinion of the dames,--fool-Dinadin, <br>  "One happy hour secures for every day,-- <br>  "Less than man's hope, somewhat above his worth, <br>  "Thinks he, yet ever finds, as now he goes<br>  "Assured again of choicest meats and drinks--<br>  "Or cloud, or shine, fool-Dinadin, to dine." <br>  <br>  <center>******</center> <br>  <br>  But here, sweet gentles, pause.  The sun, you see, <br>  Bestows wide glories on eve's gathering clouds: <br>  With ministry of beauty, prophecies, <br>  As known from ancient Palestine, as writ<br>  Within our Book of Life, not clouds, but morn<br>  Fair, shall ascend upon our slumbers.  So, <br>  This holding true, we end the golden tale<br>  Of Joyous Gard, of Palomide, his worth, <br>  His consecration, ere again our flowers<br>  Their loveliness and incense both withdrawn, <br>  Or shines within the dusk, that one sole star<br>  Of Love, of lovers all approved their star. <br>  <br>
