Thou hast read those missives.  Then thou know'st<br> I would possess Excalibur for mine.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> Conspirator!  Dost thou dare tell me this?<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> Hark, Merlin.  Once that mystic sword my own,<br> I rule instead of Arthur.  For thyself,<br> Thou shalt, I swear, become Prime Minister<br> Where thou art now mere vassal to the king.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> Prime Minister? . . . What madness moves thy speech?<br> The sword from him who wields it may not pass,<br> Except the Queen herself, at midnight hour,<br> Will steal it with her own fair hands.  Even then<br> The earth would quake, hot lightnings rend the sky,<br> And she, its guardian Lady of the Lake,<br> Would rise in wrath, and bid the Table Round<br> Slay the fell traitor who had urged this act.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> Meanwhile the sword were mine.  And, Merlin, thou<br> Wouldst be Prime Minister in my new realm.<br> Does Arthur value thee at thy fit worth?<br> To-day thou scarcely hast his jester's rank.<br> As mountebank, even charlatan, he holds<br> Thy reverend self.  Reflect ere thou refuse.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> It was ages and ages and ages ago,<br>    In an antediluvian time,<br> When my beard could as now patriarchally flow,<br> And my gaze had the same supernatural glow<br>    Which at present is thought so sublime,<br> That I served with a monarch whose glory was great,<br> As his trusted Secretary of State.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> I am far from objecting that then as that now<br>    You extended six feet in your hose,<br> And that none could with honesty dare disallow<br> Your remarkably intellectual brow<br>    And your magisterial nose,<br> When the King who is pre-historical dust<br> So distinguished you by a prominent trust.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> To resume my remarks where you cut them so short,<br>    I was not, as a statesman, exempt<br> From the fell office-hunter's insidious court,<br> From the perils and snares of malicious report,<br>    Or from bribery's evil attempt;<br> But approaches like these I would straightway subdue<br> By the withering glance that I now bend on you.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> If I own that your glance has a singular stress<br>    Which reacts on my chief spinal nerve,<br> I shall fail to make manifest, nevertheless,<br> How you equally mortify as you impress<br>    By the probity that you preserve;<br> Yet I beg very earnestly still to insist<br> That you deal with no common corruptionist.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> I remember that once when a knave had presumed<br>    His perfidious views to expound,<br> Though of social distinction he blustered and fumed,<br> I arranged that alive in the earth he was tombed,<br>    With his head poking out above ground;<br> And while slowly of thirst and of hunger he died,<br> I assure you I laughed till I really cried.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> So unpleasant are vivid accounts like to these<br>    When embellished with your dainty skill,<br> That I beg you will bear it in mind, if you please,<br> How my terrified marrow commences to freeze<br>    And the roots of my being to thrill;<br> Yet I cannot deny, notwithstanding alarm,<br> That my villainy wears an exceptional charm.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> Oh, if then you had shown me these poisonous plums<br>    Which the branches of treason contain,<br> I perhaps would have had you hung up by your thumbs,<br> Or have put red-hot pins in your eyelids and gums,<br>    While I gloated with glee on your pain;<br> For the impulse of gloating I seldom repress,<br> And I always have gloated with striking success.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> That you gloat with a grace altogether your own,<br>    You are wasting your words to denote,<br> And indeed a sincere admiration alone<br> Now impels me to have my depravity known,<br>    For the purpose of seeing you gloat;<br> Yet an ominous feeling my bosom has crost<br> That you hesitate and are in consequence lost.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> I regard your assumption as wholly unfair,<br>    And conveyed with unmerited scorn,<br> Since the proud reputation I handsomely bear<br> I for ages and ages of much wear and tear<br>    Have with noteworthy rectitude borne;<br> Yet the place of Prime Minister, all will admit,<br> Is a place that my talents would capably fit.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> Strike hands, good necromancer.  Thou at last<br> Consentest.  Big the risk, yet big the prize.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> My qualms of conscience still abide the same.<br> I feel myself provisionally bad,<br> And that alone.  You tempted, and I fell;<br> But then you tempted fatly.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br>                            So I did.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> Enough.  My expiation may require<br> Perchance a thousand years.  A trifle, that,<br> To me, the immortal Merlin, it is true.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> A trifle weightless as blown thistledown.<br> Had I your same deep funds of earthly life,<br> By fits I would be virtuous and by fits<br> The baccanal opposite.  One century<br> The dusk of cloisters and the garb of serge,<br> The chill high-windowed cell, with loaf and jug,<br> The sandalled feet and prayer-worn rosary-beads.<br> Next century, mirth and revel, dance and dice,<br> Lights, music, diamond eyes amid the dark<br> Of velvet masks, with folly a gilded toy<br> And grim sin painted all of rainbow hues.<br> Monotony is pleasure's bane and curse,<br> Change and variety are its meat and wine!<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> Hollow philosophy, I fear, my lord;<br> Yet hollow things, like wine-cups, oft hold cheer.<br> Does the Queen will to steal this magic brand?<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> To-night, if thou wilt aid her in the act.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> At set of sun with solemn pomp I bless<br> The sword for this great victory fought and gained,<br> While all our people voice their hymn of thanks.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> Piously singing somewhat out of tune--<br> I know the ceremony; it has made me yawn<br> Eleven good times already.  Afterward?<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> I bear the sword away and lock it up<br> In the huge vault below the castle-moat,<br> To symbolize its ancient years of rest<br> Deep in the bosom of the lake whence rose<br> An arm that held it forth as Arthur's boon,<br> Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> Thy pardon, mage, but were not those last words<br> Quoted from some bard who has framed this theme<br> In verse?  I fancy I recall the line.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> Sir Lancelot, you are grievously at fault;<br> Whatever else I am or may become,<br> I am and always grandly will remain<br> Original.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br>          Again thy pardon, seer.<br> Tell more, I pray.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br>                      The vault whereof I spoke<br> Hath seven huge iron doors, and each of these<br> Is opened by a separate massive key.<br> At end of all a flight of seven stone steps,<br> Thick-filmed with dank ooze and deceptive slime,<br> Leads to an iron chest whose every nail<br> Juts like the clenched fist of a giant knight<br> From ponderous bands of steel.  The Queen's own strength<br> Must lift the lid and draw Excalibur<br> Out from the chest.  If there she chance to fail,<br> The brand itself shall rise and smite her dead,<br> While thou and I, her arch-accomplices,<br> In half the thinking of a thought, are hurled<br> With hideous ruin and combustion down<br> To bottomless perdition.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br>                         Grace again . . .<br> Thy last fine phrase--was that original?<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> Completely so, Sir Lancelot.  Plagiarism<br> Has never soiled my native eloquence.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> And must the Queen this dangerous journey take<br> In utter darkness?  May she not have light?<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> None, save the light of her intelligence,<br> Never a torch of brilliance at its best.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> You wrong her.  She will put her wit to proof<br> This night, and if I err not, test as well<br> Her courage; I will answer you for both.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> 'Tis as clear to my mind as the commonest rule<br>    Mathematical teachings beget,<br> That the Queen is a fool, and that you are a fool,<br>    And that I am a worse fool yet.<br> There are thousands of people who envy our lot,<br> But we can't keep along at a moderate trot;<br> We've a devilish fancy to see how it feels<br> When you break in a gallop and kick up your heels!<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> That is true not alone of the Queen, you and me,<br>    But of all humankind, I am sure;<br> There is always one apple high up on the tree<br>    That we'd tear our best clothes to secure.<br> Though in life, as it often occurs, we have got<br> All the tidbits we need floating round in our pot,<br> Spite of prudence and tact we must see how it feels<br> To kick over the pot while we kick up our heels!<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> You're a knight with a record for brain and for brawn--<br>    Guinevere's royal rank who'll deny?--<br> As the great court-magician I weekly have drawn<br>    From my monarch a salary high;<br> Yet although our life's leaves are without the least blot,<br> We've a strange inclination to wish they were not;<br> On the nice clean white paper, to see how it feels,<br> We must spill half the ink while we kick up our heels!<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> To obtain a king's throne fortune's favor I sue;<br>    Guinevere wants a handsomer lord;<br> The portfolio of a Prime Minister you<br>    Have a long time in secret adored.<br> Very likely 'twere best we should alter no jot<br> From the stations whose changes we privately plot,<br> Yet we've all a temptation to see how it feels<br> When at last you've concluded to kick up your heels!<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> What further speech hath issue on this head<br> We fitlier should hold otherwhere than here.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> True, Merlin.  These rude bastions, nooks and towers,<br> Were facile ambush for some envious ear.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> And such an one is Modred's.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br>                             Fearest thou<br> Sir Modred, that sly cousin to the King?<br> Him of the uneasy eye, unechoing tread<br> And bright prompt smile?  Myself, I like him not.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> If covert foe we have, that foe is he.<br> Come, let us hence.  Time fleets, and colloquy<br> Must further shape this dark wild plan for use.<br>  (<i> Merlin and Sir Lancelot retire through an archway of the castle.  From another egress Modred cautiously enters, followed by Vivien.</i> ) <br> MODRED:<br> Their plot is mine!  Now, Vivien, if the Queen<br> Shall get from Merlin's hand the seven great keys<br> And tread the slippery stairs until she clutch<br> The subterranean sword, Excalibur,<br> Returning safe with it to upper air,<br> Why, then, what easier than to crouch in wait<br> And seize it from her grasp ere Lancelot dream?<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> O wily Modred, wilt thou dare this thing?<br> <br> MODRED:<br> Sweet Vivien, for thy sake I would dare more.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Thou darest nothing.  Flatter not thy soul<br> With fantasy of courage for thy spur.<br> Deceit alone is pith and kernel here;<br> All else is vaunt, ambition, treachery!<br> <br> MODRED:<br> Hast thou forgot love, too, or canst thou rate<br> Such love as mine a toy to toss and lose?<br> Vivien, dost thou remember when we played,<br> Mere boy and girl, together on sea-sands,<br> In sight of those gray beetling walls where dwelt<br> Our kinsman, that bluff Earl who loved us both?<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Yes, I recall.  We shaped amid the sands<br> Full many a castle, drawbridge, gate and moat;<br> But all were thine, or so thy mood would claim.<br> <br> MODRED:<br> All those pretty palaces of sand,<br>    Swept afar so long by ocean's pride,<br> Were but meant, if thou couldst understand,<br>    For the little maiden at my side.<br> She it was whose tender eyes and lips<br>    All the mimic realm should sweetly sway,<br> When my fairy gold in fairy ships<br>    From enchanted isles had found its way!<br> <br> While her dimpled face, in childish thought,<br>    Watched my eager fingers as they plied,<br> Happy was the toil with which I wrought<br>    For the little maiden at my side<br> Every tiny chamber should possess<br>    Riches past all value and compare--<br> Pearls that beam amid the mermaid's tress,<br>    Corals that the rosy sea-caves bear!<br> <br> Since those idle moments, many a year,<br>    Filled with shade or sun, has dawned and died.<br> Mightier now the palace I would rear<br>    For the statelier maiden at my side.<br> Here at last, in honor and renown,<br>    She may dwell my treasured wife and true,<br> Wearing on her brows the queenly crown<br>    That by dower of beauty is her due!<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Modred, I wonder that thou trustest me<br> With this dread secret of thy coming guilt.<br> What earnest hast thou (nay, let go my hand)<br> That I will clamor not, with wrathful speed,<br> Thy full intent where those who learn its ill<br> May crush it dead by dungeon, chain or block?<br> <br> MODRED:<br> Pah, Vivien, well thou knowest that if I hold<br> Excalibur, the power I wield with it<br> Makes Merlin serve me then as Arthur now.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> What import to myself if he so serve?<br> <br> MODRED:<br> Nay, large, my subtle Vivien, I can prove.<br> The face-wash and the hair-dye Merlin holds<br> He would surrender if I held the sword.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> The face-wash and the hair-dye?  Thou in sooth<br> Hast heard of these long-hoarded talismans?<br> <br> MODRED:<br> Who here at Camelot has not heard of them?<br> The little dusk-haired page that trips through hall,<br> Bearing the flagon in his lifted clasp,<br> Wots of the charms and longs to test their worth.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> And dost thou think that I, Sir Modred, I,<br> Would trifle with such witcheries? . . . Thou hast called<br> Full many a time the Lady Vivien fair.<br> Would I be fairer, then, if tress and tint<br> Were fair indeed, as wrought so by these arts?<br> <br> MODRED:<br> No silkier could one strand of thy dear hair<br> Gleam to these eyes, my Vivien, if so steeped<br> In sun its gay gold matched the daffodil's!<br> No tenderer would the curve of that soft cheek<br> Seem to my sense if now its olive tinge<br> Were pinker than the frail wild-rose's leaf!<br> I love thee seeing that what I love no change<br> Of face-wash or of hair-dye may annul!<br> Thy smile--the beam of thy deep roguish gaze--<br> The sorcery of thy dewy lips--the arch<br> Of nostril or of brow--would bide the same!<br> And more, the intelligence--<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br>                             Enough.  'Tis plain<br> Thou wouldst prefer me were I not brunette.<br> <br> MODRED:<br> (How sweet to rouse her dainty jealousy!)<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> (He does not dream the wherefore of my wish!<br> Yet once the face-wash and the hair-dye mine,<br> That languid saint, Sir Galahad, whom I love,<br> Might melt and thrill where now his mien is ice!)<br> <br> MODRED:<br> Hast thou forgot, sweet Vivien, that spring day<br> Scarce one year hence, when wandering the dark belt<br> Of beechwood nigh to Camelot's green domain,<br> I chanced upon thyself and heard thee sing,<br> Dreaming none heard save some stray thrush or merle,<br> That pensive song beside a shaded pool?<br> The limpid pool was mirror for thy face,<br> And as a maiden to her mirror sings,<br> Thou to the shining mere didst pour thy plaint.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> I have forgot.  (No lie was gliblier told!)<br> <br> MODRED:<br> Nay, thou rememberest.  Sing the song once more.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> What were the gist and lilt of that same song?<br> <br> MODRED:<br> The gist I know; the lilt hath lost itself<br> In revery of the love it roused that day.<br> But this I keep as record of the song:<br> Thou didst deplore thou wert not born a blonde.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Tell me, tell me, tell me,<br>    Quiet pool and clear,<br> Why it thus befell me<br>    To be mourning here!<br> Why with unabated<br>    Woe do I regret<br> That I was created<br>    A confirmed brunette!<br> Why does hope expel me,<br>    Like a child from school?<br> Tell me, tell me, tell me,<br>    Sleepy little pool!<br> <br> Enid's locks are sunny<br>    As the wheat's ripe stores;<br> Golden as new honey<br>    Lynette's, Lyonors';<br> Here alone I linger,<br>    Full of yearnings fond,<br> I, who'd give a finger<br>    To have been a blonde!<br> Why so far excel me<br>    Maud, Yseult, Gudule,<br> Tell me, tell me, tell me,<br> Placid little pool!<br> <br> Heavy is the tax on<br>    Patience when I see<br> That it is un-Saxon<br> To be dark like me.<br> Were I queen anointed,<br>    Still my heart would fret,<br> As a disappointed<br>    And aggrieved brunette!<br> Why despair should quell me,<br>    Destiny o'errule,<br> Tell me, tell me, tell me,<br>    Lazy little pool!<br> <br> In my deep dejection,<br>    Pool so pure to view,<br> Cast me my reflection,<br>    Clad with brighter hue!<br> Weave the sunbeams in it,<br>    While I thus despond;<br> Let me dream a minute<br>    I was born a blonde!<br> Why should fate repel me,<br>    Why should chance befool,<br> Tell me, tell me, tell me,<br>    Silent little pool!<br> <br> MODRED:<br> The song's true self; thou hast not missed a word.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> (No hint of Galahad slept within the strain;<br> 'Twas therefore safe to sing it as I did.)<br> <br> (<i> Sir Galahad now appears from the castle, with bowed head, as of one who muses while he walks.</i> ) <br> MODRED:<br> Look where that smooth male vaunt of saintliness<br> Moves like the animate statue of himself,<br> Paid for ere death in charge to his leal heirs.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> I see . . . I would a word with Galahad.<br> <br> MODRED:<br> So would not I . . . Dear Vivien, ere I go,<br> Thou wilt swear help and secrecy to-night?<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Stanch help and secrecy . . . Why should I not<br> So swear?  Alas!  I was not born a blonde!<br> <br> MODRED:<br> Enough.  I kiss thy hand in faith and troth.<br> Farewell, my blonde Queen that may shortly be!<br> Shalt dally long with that white peacock, love?<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Nay, briefly . . . I would question him by stealth,<br> Lest he dream aught of damage to our plan.<br> <br> MODRED:<br> Right, Vivien.  Let me read those lucid eyes . . .<br> And so thou lov'st me now I may be King?<br> Ah, woman, woman, weak as thou wert made,<br> What strength is in thy love for worldly power!<br> Well, if thou love the place I lift thee to,<br> I'll dream thou still dost prize the hand that lifts!<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> In that hand's grip thou hast a mighty faith.<br> <br> MODRED:<br> Why not?  If I can seize Excalibur,<br> Much of the soldiery, this warrant seen,<br> Will join me in revolt, since I am held<br> As one of Arthur's family by near<br> Relationship--or shall I rather say<br> Pendragonship?--to our sworn liege, the King.<br> Ah, yes, that brand, once flourished, will convince<br> These dolts that Heaven with Arthur is at odds,<br> And that to me, his kinsman, Modred, falls<br> The right to lead and rule them how I list.<br> But Lancelot as an alien they would hold,<br> Nor pay his hest a shred of courtesy,<br> He being of other than the princely line . . .<br> Note well this grade of difference in our states,<br> My Vivien, and so hug ambition close . . .<br> Again farewell, my Queen that soon shall be!<br> Grant me one kiss . . .<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br>                        Nay, not till I am Queen.<br> <br> MODRED:<br> Unpitying girl! . . . Well, be it thus indeed!<br> Ere the great pomp is holden we shall meet,<br> And in the dance thy white hand shall I claim . . .<br> I trust thee with that self-swamped Galahad!<br> Again, remember--and again, farewell!<br> <br> (<i> Modred disappears into the castle, scornfully watched by Vivien.</i> )<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> I mate with thee, thou soul packed thick with spites!<br> And thou hast trusted me!  Even so we trust<br> The wave that drowns us or the drug that slays!<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> What voice was that?  Ah, Lady Vivien, thine?<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Yes, mine.  Did I hold converse with myself<br> Unwittingly?  If so, I crave thy grace.<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> Sure none were easier rendered than mine own.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Thou, too, wert lost in musing.  May I seek<br> To learn what drooped thy head so sombrely?<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> Sweet Vivien, if I mused it must have been<br> On mine own superhuman purity.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Ah, true.  Bur purity and coldness wed . . .<br> Sir Galahad, art thou cold as thou art pure?<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> Meseems I am peculiarly cold . . .<br> I know not . . . Were I grosser I might tell<br> The measure of mine own frigidity<br> In way more accurate.  Yet I do think<br> I am exceeding cold.  What thinkest thou?<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> What think I?  No bare northland berg that lifts<br> A glassy spire in arctic air is more<br> Cold to its clime's dim heaven than thou to love!<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> Love?  What is love?  I oft have heard it named,<br> And oft have fancied that I lack it not.<br> Myself I love, and virtue--which are one . . .<br> And nicety of deportment . . .<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br>                               Well, what more?<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> And meats or fish in season, deftly cooked,<br> Especially with sauce of proper spice.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Thou questionest what love is . . . I will tell!<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> Pray, tell; and I with zest of heed shall hark.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Love is a temple all alone,<br>    Pure-white and small of scope,<br> Not built of wood, not built of stone,<br> But built of something that is known<br>    To human hearts as hope.<br> And here the lover's foot will steal,<br> And here the lover oft will kneel,<br>    Perchance when no one cares,<br> His love in secret to reveal,<br>    With tender tears and prayers!<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br>    If love the soul endue<br>    With loyalty so true,<br> Then surely love must be above<br>    All joys I ever knew!<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Love is a garden whose delights<br>    May lovers only know;<br> A garden that is always night's,<br> Where westward from her starry heights<br>    A summer moon drops low;<br> Where urns of glossy myrtles beam,<br> Where statues from the terrace gleam,<br>    Where pale cool fountains pour,<br> And lovers in delicious dream<br>    Go wandering evermore!<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br>    If love may so invite<br>    King Arthur's virgin knight,<br> Then love indeed must far exceed<br>    The rhymes that poets write!<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Love is a forest in whose deep<br>    A stream's clear waters glide;<br> And many a mortal here doth creep,<br> His thirsting lips to lean and steep<br>    Amid the crystal tide.<br> But soon, with hearts that sadly sink,<br> They linger by that river's brink,<br>    And feel its waves accurst;<br> For ah, the longer that they drink<br>    The deadlier grows their thirst!<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br>    If love to such excess<br>    May ban as well as bless,<br> Then love must hide a seamy side<br>    Of curious ugliness!<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Love is a land where dead leaves fall<br>    And wild-flowers droop their blooms;<br> A land that ever feels the thrall<br> Of sorrowing winds that moan and call<br>    Like voices out of tombs.<br> And here wan lovers roam forlorn,<br> Each with a rose-crown he has worn<br>    In merrier moods than now;<br> For every rose has turned a thorn<br>    That wounds its wearer's brow!<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br>    If love through storm and sun<br>    So strange a course can run,<br> Then love's a bane that any sane<br>    Philosopher should shun!<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Love keeps a joy to match its worst of woe,<br> And worst its woe when we have loved where lies<br> A blank of dead indifference . . . like thine own! . . .<br> Thou sighest, Galahad; wherefore dost thou sigh?<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> I sigh to think how many maids there be<br> On whom my dead indifference must have wrought<br> This woe thou paintest in such dreary phrase.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Nay, thou art wrong.  Thy comeliness perchance<br> Allures full many a maid, or touches her<br> With spleen of slighted vanity.  But this<br> Means not the grief of loving without hope.<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> Then no maids love me?  Ah, how glad I am!<br> I merely rouse their wish that I would woo?<br> 'Tis well; I hate to even account myself<br> As irresponsibly responsible<br> For broken hearts I had no aim to break.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> Nay, Galahad, 'tis not entirely so!<br> I know one maid whose heart is bent for thee--<br> Bent cruelly, if not yet quite broke in twain.<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> Pray, tell me of this maid.  'Twould pleasure me<br> To know her and console her if I could.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> What balm of consolation wouldst thou bring<br> The sharp distemper of her troubled soul?<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> I should advise her with due haste to seek<br> A nunnery, since having loved myself,<br> She could not stoop to lower than myself,<br> And therefore must win recompense alone<br> In pious raptures taught by holy deeds.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> But if she were too worldly for this task<br> Of self-abasement?--if men deemed her fair,<br> And by the power of beauty, wit and grace<br> She dreamed of kindling from thy lethargy<br> A leap of flame as vital as her own?<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> I should deplore her motive, were it seen,<br> And recommend a nunnery, all the same.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> O pitiless! has fancy never shaped<br> From shadow a life whose love thou couldst hold dear?<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> No, never . . . Stay, thy question doth recall<br> A vision which at times hath haunted me.<br> It looked so pure and beautiful, I thought<br> At first it was my own similitude.<br> But later it convinced me that I erred,<br> And that the sex it bore was feminine.<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> And thou didst love this vision, Galahad?<br> Oh, tell me more! . . .

Modred, we are all<br> Conspirators against him; that is plain.<br> Vivien and you in ambush were concealed,<br> Knowing our plot to rape Excalibur,<br> And hoping to secure him for yourselves.<br> Confess that you, as we, were deep in guile.<br> <br> MODRED:<br> We do confess!<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br>               We both are black with blame!<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> So be it.  Then let us all stand firm of front,<br> And cleave, each one, to what the other says.<br> Our single hope of safety dwells in this.<br> Let all cry innocence with common tongue,<br> And fight it out hereafter as we may,<br> When watched no longer of the royal eye.<br>  (<i> King Arthur now appears from castle, with many knights, ladies, retainers, etc.</i> ) <br> KING ARTHUR:<br> What sounds are these<br>    That break upon our joy,<br> Our blood to freeze,<br>    Our revel to destroy?<br> What means, where all was recently so quiet,<br> This horrid elemental roar and riot?<br> <br> CHORUS:<br> What means it all?<br> (We thrill with nameless fright.)<br> Has somebody, with boldness to appall,<br> Done something that offends the rules of right?<br> Who, then, is the delinquent?  Let us meet him,<br> And with proper indignation greet him!<br> <br> KING ARTHUR:<br>    We danced, we sang,<br> Our hearts were filled with peace.<br>    This dreaded clang<br> Began, and would not cease.<br> And while with merriment we strove to shun it,<br> We feared, each one, lest what we drank had done it.<br> <br> CHORUS:<br>    Oh, no, a little wine<br> Of brand exceeding dear,<br> Could never make the intellect incline<br> To such a strange deception of the ear.<br> Habitual intemperance might do it,<br> But as for that, we all of us eschew it!<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> Some impious hand, my lord, hath dared to steal<br> Thy sacred sword, Excalibur.  The vault<br> Flared red with light a moment since, while bursts<br> Of thunder shook the heaven, and darkness veiled<br> The journeying moon.  Sir Modred thought he saw<br> A cloaked shape dart away at headlong speed,<br> Bearing the sword; but who the dastard thief<br> We dream not, and the keys that ope the vault<br> I keep, as always, guarded with my life.<br> <br> KING ARTHUR:<br> My sword, Excalibur!  Blood, flame and death!<br> Where are thy magic arts, astrologer?<br> Catch me the knave, and I will see him swing<br> This very night from Camelot's tallest tower.<br>  (<i> Dagonet now appears.  He hurries to King Arthur with the sword, and lays it at his feet, kneeling.</i> ) <br> OMNES:<br> What, Dagonet!  Then did Dagonet steal the sword?<br> <br> DAGONET:<br> Nay, Dagonet saved it for his kingly sire.<br> My liege, they all are traitors--Merlin there,<br> And Lancelot, Modred, Vivien--yes, even she<br> Thou trustest with surpassing trust--thy Queen!<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> What insolence is this?  Thou canst not, sire,<br> Believe the fool who babbles its mad tale.<br> <br> GUINEVERE:<br> Nay, Lancelot, do not dream the king believes.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> Thy fool, King Arthur, hath purloined the sword,<br> And fearing after, with a true thief's fear,<br> Flings this atrocious charge upon ourselves.<br> <br> MODRED:<br> I mind me now of what I had forgot,<br> My King, or deemed not worth remembering.<br> This fool, while Merlin dozed, some three hours since,<br> I saw emerging, with a cat-like tread,<br> From the seer's chamber in the northmost tower.<br> He paled and cowered when I confronted him,<br> Threading by chance the outer corridor.<br> 'Twas then, past doubt, that he had filched the keys<br> From Merlin, afterward returning them,<br> I dare be sworn, when he had oped the vault<br> And made all ready for his midnight theft.<br> <br> GUINEVERE:<br> And now, in terror, sire, he soils <i> my</i>  name<br> With gross aspersion.  Ah, 'tis horrible!<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> A fool's mere random transport.  Who but scorns<br> To credit him, or deems his empty rant<br> Of weightier purport than the idle breeze?<br> <br> DAGONET:<br> My lord, King Arthur, hear me when I say--<br> <br> KING ARTHUR:<br> That thou art crafty knave no less than fool!<br> Speak not another word!  Already crime<br> By right has drawn the noose about thy throat!<br> That we can pardon thee is due alone<br> To thy scant wit, whose work may not be judged<br> Equal with villainies of sounder brains.<br> <br> DAGONET:<br> Hear me, Lord Arthur!  Mercifully hear!<br> <br> KING ARTHUR:<br> Get hence, poor Dagonet; liberty and life<br> Are compassed for thee in our pity, and this<br> We give from natural benignancy,<br> Being perhaps the most magnanimous king<br> That ever sat or shall sit throned to rule.<br> <br> DAGONET:<br> My lord, I plead with you--<br> <br> KING ARTHUR:<br>                            Why, seize him, then,<br> Sir Lamorack, Sir Gawain, and lodge him safe<br> Within the nearest monastery.  Instruct<br> The monks to watch him as a lunatic<br> Of dangerous fashion and conceit, and tell<br> The holy men how he essayed to steal<br> My brand, Excalibur.<br> <br> (<i> Dagonet is borne away.</i> )<br> <br>                     Good people, all,<br> I pray you will observe my noble act.<br> It is but one of many hundreds more<br> Since I began to reign.  Make note of it,<br> Good people; at some future day 'twill serve<br> With gold memorial letters to illume<br> One of my many monuments on earth.<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> I hope your majesty does not expect<br> Complete monopoly, when you are dead,<br> Of all the monuments that shall be built.<br> <br> GUINEVERE:<br> I tremble, Arthur, at the indignity<br> Of that fool's reckless charge.  Sir Lancelot, thou<br> Must feel the scorching wrong of Dagonet's words.<br> <br> SIR LANCELOT:<br> That jester's falsehood?  Why, the tinkle of bells<br> Trilled through its gravity, making all mere masque<br> And mummery, till I scarce kept wrath to frown.<br> <br> MERLIN:<br> Sir Lancelot speaks in wisdom.  Nay, to heed<br> Such fury of accusation were to clothe<br> Slander with dignity, had even our fool<br> Been other than the garrulous imp he is.<br> (My Queen, be wary lest thy lord should see<br> Thine overshoes peep forth below thy robe.<br> Trifles like these might sow calamity--<br> And rid the holy men of Dagonet's care.)<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> (Sir Galahad, canst thou never love me, then,<br> If I remain brunette?  I promise thee<br> That no brunette of more domestic turn<br> Has ever lived as wife than I would prove.)<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br> (Hadst thou been blonde . . . ah, well, I will not say<br> What joy has perished for all future time!<br> O Vivien, wildly, passionately loved!--)<br> <br> VIVIEN:<br> (My Galahad!  Dost thou mean it?)<br> <br> SIR GALAHAD:<br>                                  (No, not now.<br> I would have meant it, wert thou only blonde.<br> Farewell, my blonde that art not nor canst be,<br> This woful barrier lies between us twain<br> Forevermore.  I shall be virgin knight<br> Henceforth, with one long sorrow in my soul,<br> And all my dreams and thoughts to one sad tune<br> Set ceaselessy--"She might have been a blonde!")<br> <br> KING ARTHUR:<br> Why should this rough mishap our joyance mar?<br> Let us forget that Dagonet's folly was.<br> It still wants hours of dawn.  Come, ladies, knights,<br> With thanks that good Excalibur is saved,<br> Let us fare back to revel and high pomp.<br> <br> (<i> He sings.</i> )<br> Excalibur, the sacred sword,<br> Back to his royal owner is restored.<br> Give thanks, with high acclaim, with loud accord;<br> Let Camelot's towers and halls their echoes deep<br> O'er buttress, moat and bastion rise and sweep.<br> Excalibur, that we could ill afford<br> To lose, has found again his rightful lord!<br> Give thanks, give thanks,<br> Our loyal people, of all grades and ranks,<br> Give thanks, give thanks!<br> <br> GENERAL CHORUS:<br> Give thanks, give thanks,<br> That by whatever curious tricks or pranks,<br> From out his awful chest<br> Some thief has dared to wrest<br> Our great Excalibur, the villain gains<br> Prompt punishment for all his evil pains.<br> Of course the present ode<br> Wherewith we celebrate this unsuccessful crime<br> Should mark an episode<br> That merits chronicling in future time.<br> And yet we greatly fear<br> That everybody here<br> Will merely prove the subject of romantic rhyme.<br> For none of us with surety can insist<br> That we at all exist,--<br> Nor knight, nor seer, nor lady!<br> It is our private feeling that we all are shady<br> As matter for the archæologist!<br> We somehow feel, although it may be fancy,<br> We soon will disappear by necromancy,--<br> Dissolved in something vague and legendary,<br> To puzzle every future antiquary!<br> But whether right or wrong<br>    In this our supposition,<br> And whether we belong<br> To poet, to historian or to statistician,<br>    We still with all due courtesy make bold<br> To call this New King Arthur of our song<br>    As thoroughly authentic as the Old.<br> Nay, we will even go farther,<br> And say that no King Arthur<br> One bit of authenticity may hold<br> In his apocryphal and mythic mould,<br>    Despite the songs that have been sung,<br>    Despite the rhymes that have been rung,<br> Despite the tales nonsensical, like this that we have told!<br>  <center>END.</center>
