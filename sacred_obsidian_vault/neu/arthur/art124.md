[6]<br> <br> He called his <i> Corporal</i> , Syllable, [7]<br>    To range the scatter'd throng;<br> And <i> Captain</i>  Word dispos'd them well [8]<br>    In bands compact and strong.<br> <br> -- "Now mark, Sir Childe," -- Sir Hornbook said: --<br>    "These well-compacted powers,<br> Shall lead thy vent'rous steps to tread<br>    Through all the Muses' bowers,<br> <br> "If rightly thou thyself address,<br>    To use their proffer'd aid:<br> Still unallur'd by idleness,<br>    By labor undismay'd;<br> <br> "For many troubles intervene,<br>    And perils widely spread,<br> Around the groves of evergreen,<br>    That crown this mountain's head:<br> But rich reward he finds, I ween,<br>    Who through them all has sped." --<br> <br> Childe Launcelot felt his bosom glow<br>    At thought of noble deed;<br> Resolved through every path to go,<br>    Where that bold knight should lead.<br> <br> Sir Hornbook wound his bugle horn,<br>    Full long, and loud, and shrill;<br> His merrymen all, for conquest born,<br> With armour glittering to the morn,<br>    Went marching up the hill.<br> <br> <br> 		III.<br> -- "What men are you beside the way?" --<br>    The bold Sir Hornbook cried:<br> -- "My name is <i> The</i> , my brother's <i> A</i> ," --<br>    Sir Article replied. [9]<br> <br> "My brother's home is any where, [10]<br>    At large and undefin'd;<br> But I a preference ever bear [11]<br> For one fix'd spot, and settle there;<br>    Which speaks my constant mind."<br> <br> -- "What ho!  Childe Launcelot! seize them there,<br>    And look you have them sure!" --<br> -- Sir Hornbook cried, -- "my men shall bear<br>    Your captives off secure." --<br> <br> The twain were seized: Sir Hornbook blew<br>    His bugle loud and shrill:<br> His merrymen all, so stout and true,<br>    Went marching up the hill.<br> <br> <br> 		IV.<br> <br> And now a wider space they gained,<br>    A steeper, harder ground,<br> Where by one ample wall contained,<br>    All earthly <i> things</i>  they found: [12]<br> <br> All <i> beings</i> , rich, poor, weak, or wise,<br>    Were there, full strange to see,<br> And <i> attributes</i>  and <i> qualities</i> <br>    Of high and low degree.<br> <br> Before the circle stood a knight,<br>    Sir Substantive his name, [13]<br> With Adjective, his lady bright,<br>    Who <i> seemed</i>  a portly dame;<br> <br> Yet only <i> seemed</i> ; for whenso'er<br>    She strove to <i> stand alone</i> , [14]<br> She proved no more than smoke and air,<br>    Who looked like flesh and bone.<br> <br> And therefore to her husband's arm<br>    She clung for evermore,<br> And lent him many a grace and charm<br>    He had not known before;<br> <br> Yet these the knight felt well advised,<br>    He might have done without;<br> For lightly foreign help he prized<br>    He was so staunch and stout.<br> <br> Five sons had they, their dear delight,<br>    Of different forms and faces;<br> And <i> two</i>  of them were Numbers bright, [15]<br>    And <i> three</i>  they christened Cases. [16]<br> <br> Now loudly rung Sir Hornbook's horn;<br>    Childe Launcelot poised his spear;<br> And on they rushed, to conquest borne,<br>    In swift and full career.<br> <br> Sir Substantive kicked down the wall:<br>    It fell with furious rattle:<br> And earthly <i> things</i>  and <i> beings</i>  all<br>    Rushed forth to join the battle.<br> <br> But earthly <i> things</i>  and <i> beings</i>  all,<br>    Though mixed in boundless plenty,<br> Must one by one dissolving fall<br>    To Hornbook's six-and-twenty.<br> <br> Childe Launcelot won the arduous fray,<br>    And, when they ceased from strife,<br> Led stout Sir Substantive away,<br>    His children, and his wife.<br> <br> Sir Hornbook wound his horn again,<br>    Full long, and loud, and shrill:<br> His merrymen all, a warlike train,<br>    Went marching up the hill.<br> <br> <br> 		V.<br> Now when Sir Pronoun look'd abroad, [17]<br>    And spied the coming train,<br> He left his fort beside the road,<br>    And ran with might and main.<br> <br> Two cloth-yard shafts from I and U,<br>    Went forth with whizzing sound:<br> Like lightning sped the arrows true;<br>    Sir Pronoun pressed the ground:<br> But darts of science ever flew<br>    To conquer, not to wound.<br> <br> His fear was great: his hurt was small:<br>    Childe Launcelot took his hand:<br> -- "Sir Knight," -- said he, -- "though doomed to fall<br>    Before my conquering band,<br> <br> "Yet knightly treatment shall you find,<br>    On faith of cavalier:<br> Then join Sir Substantive behind,<br>    And follow our career." --<br> <br> Sir Substantive, that man of might,<br>    Felt knightly anger rise;<br> For he had marked Sir Pronoun's flight<br>    With no approving eyes.<br> <br> "Great Substantive, my sovereign liege!" --<br>    Thus sad Sir Pronoun cried,<br> -- "When you had fallen in furious siege,<br>    Could I the shock abide?"<br> <br> "That all resistance would be vain,<br>    Too well, alas! I knew:<br> For what could I, when you were ta'en,<br>    Your poor <i> lieutenant</i> , do?"<br> <br> Then louder rung Sir Hornbook's horn,<br>    In signals long and shrill:<br> His merrymen all, for conquest born,<br>    Went marching up the hill.<br> <br> <br> 		VI.<br> Now steeper grew the rising ground,<br>    And rougher grew the road,<br> As up the steep ascent they wound<br>    To bold Sir Verb's abode. [18]<br> <br> Sir Verb was old, and many a year,<br>    All scenes and climates seeing,<br> Had run a wild and strange career<br>    Through every mode of being.<br> <br> And every aspect, shape, and change<br>    Of <i> action</i> , and of <i> passion</i> :<br> And known to him was all the range <br>    Of feeling, taste, and fashion.<br> <br> He was an Augur, quite at home<br>    <i> In all things present done,</i>  [19]<br> <i> Deeds past, and every act to come</i> <br>    In ages yet to run.<br> <br> Entrenched in intricacies strong,<br>    Ditch, fort, and palisado,<br> He marked with scorn the coming throng,<br>    And breathed a bold bravado:<br> <br> -- "Ho! who are you that dare invade<br>    My turrets, moats, and fences?<br> Soon will your vaunting courage fade,<br> When on the walls, in lines array'd,<br> You see me marshal undismay'd<br>    My host of moods and tenses." -- [20]<br> <br> -- "In vain," -- Childe Launcelot cried in scorn, --<br>    -- "On them is your reliance;" --<br> Sir Hornbook wound his bugle horn,<br>    And twang'd a loud defiance.<br> <br> They swam the moat, they scal'd the wall,<br>    Sir Verb, with rage and shame,<br> Beheld his valiant <i> general</i>  fall,<br>    Infinitive by name.[21]<br> <br> Indicative <i> declar'd</i>  the foes [22]<br>    Should perish by his hand;<br> And stout Imperative arose, [23]<br>    The squadron to <i> command</i> .<br> <br> Potential [24]and Subjunctive [25] then<br>    Came forth with <i> doubt</i> [24] and <i> chance</i> : [25]<br> All fell alike, with all their men,<br>    Before Sir Hornbook's lance.<br> <br> Action and Passion nought could do<br>    To save Sir Verb from fate;<br> Whose doom poor Participle knew, [26]<br>    He must <i> participate</i> .<br> <br> Then Adverb, who had skulk'd behind, [27]<br>    To shun the mighty jar,<br> Came forward, and himself resign'd<br>    A prisoner of war.<br> <br> Three children of Imperative,<br>    Full strong, though somewhat small,<br> Next forward came, themselves to give<br>    To conquering Launcelot's thrall.<br> <br> Conjunction press'd to join the crowd; [28]<br>    But Preposition swore, [29]<br> Though Interjection sobb'd aloud, [30]<br>    That he would <i> go before</i> .<br> <br> Again his horn Sir Hornbook blew,<br>    Full long, and loud, and shrill;<br> His merrymen all, so stout and true,<br>    Went marching up the hill.<br> <br> 		VII.<br> Sir Syntax dwelt in thick fir-grove, [31]<br>    All strown with scraps of flowers, [32]<br> Which he had pluck'd to please his love,<br>    Among the Muses' bowers.<br> <br> His love was gentle Prosody, [33]<br>    More fair than morning beam;<br> Who liv'd beneath a flowering tree,<br>    Beside a falling stream.<br> <br> And these two claim'd, with high pretence<br>    The whole Parnassian ground,<br> Albeit some little difference<br>    Between their taste was found:<br> Sir Syntax he was all for sense,<br>    And Prosody for sound.<br> <br> Yet in them both the Muses fair<br>    Exceedingly delighted;<br> And thought no earthly thing so rare,<br> That might with that fond twain compare,<br>    When they were both <i> united</i> .<br> <br> --"Ho! yield, Sir Syntax!" -- Hornbook cried,<br>    "This youth must pass thy grove,<br> Led on by me, his faithful guide,<br>    In yonder bowers to rove." --<br> <br> Thereat full much, Sir Syntax said,<br>    But found resistance vain:<br> And through his grove Childe Launcelot sped,<br>    With all Sir Hornbook's train.<br> <br> They reach'd the tree where Prosody<br>    Was singing in the shade:<br> Great joy Childe Launcelot had to see,<br>    And hear that lovely maid.<br> <br> Now, onward as they press'd along,<br>    Did nought their course oppose;<br> Till full before the martial throng<br>    The Muses' gates arose.<br> <br> There Etymology they found, [34]<br>    Who scorn'd surrounding fruits;<br> And ever dug in deepest ground,<br>    For old and mouldy Roots.<br> <br> Sir Hornbook took Childe Launcelot's hand,<br>    And tears at parting fell:<br> -- "Sir Childe," -- he said, -- "with all my band<br>    I bid you here farewell.<br> <br> "Then wander through these sacred bowers,<br>    Unfearing and alone:<br> All shrubs are here, and fruits, and flowers,<br>    To happiest climates known." --<br> <br> Once more his horn Sir Hornbook blew,<br>    A parting signal shrill:<br> His merrymen all, so stout and true,<br>   Went marching down the hill.<br> <br> Childe Launcelot pressed the sacred ground,<br>    With hope's exulting glow;<br> Some future song perchance may sound<br> The wondrous thing which there he found,<br>    If you the same would know.<br>  <br>  <br>  <hr>  <br>  <center><h3 align="CENTER">FOOTNOTES</h3> </center>  <br>  <br>  <a> <b> 1</b>   Childe, in our old ballads, often signifies a <i> knight</i> .<br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 2</b>   There are twenty-six letters, A.

A noun substantive declares its own meaning, and requires not another word to be joined with it to show its signification; as, <i> man, book, apple.</i> <br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 14</b>   A noun adjective cannot <i> stand alone</i> , but always requires to be joined with a substantive, of which it shows the nature or quality, as, "<i> a</i>  good <i> girl</i> ," -- "<i> a</i>  naughty <i> boy</i> ."<br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 15</b>   Nouns have two numbers, singular and plural; --<br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 16</b>   and three cases:  nominative, possessive, and objective.<br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 17</b>   A pronoun is used instead of a noun, and may be considered its <i> locum tenens</i> , or deputy: as, "<i> The King is gone to Windsor, </i> he<i>  will return to-morrow.</i> "<br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 18</b>   A verb is a word which signifies to be, to do, or to suffer; as, "<i> I am, I love, I am loved.</i> "<br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 19</b>   The two lines in <i> Italics</i>  are taken from Chapman's <i> Homer.</i> <br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 20</b>   Verbs have five moods:  The indicative, imperative, potential, subjunctive, and infinitive.<br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 21</b>   The infinitive mood expresses a thing in a <i> general</i>  and unlimited manner: as, "<i> To love, to walk, to be ruled."</i> <br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 22</b>   The indicative mood simply <i> indicates</i>  or <i> declares</i>  a thing:  as, "<i> He loves:"  "he is loved:"</i>  or asks a question:  as, "<i> Does he love?" -- "Is he loved?"</i> <br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 23</b>   The imperative mood <i> commands</i>  or <i> entreats:</i>  as, "<i> Depart:"  "Come hither:" -- "Forgive me."</i> <br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 24</b>   The potential mood implies <i> possibility</i>  or <i> obligation</i> : as, "<i> It</i>  may <i> rain:" -- "They</i>  should <i> learn</i> ."<br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 25</b>   The subjunctive mood implies <i> contingency</i> : as, "<i> If he </i> were <i> good, he would be happy."</i> <br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 26</b>   The participle is a certain form of the verb, and is so called from participating the nature of a verb and an adjective:  as, "<i> he is an </i>  admired <i> character; she is a </i> loving<i>  child</i> ."<br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 27</b>   The adverb is joined to verbs, to adjectives, and to other adverbs, to qualify their signification:  as, "<i> that is a </i> remarkably <i> swift horse:  it is </i> extremely well <i> done</i> ."<br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 28</b>   A conjunction is a part of speech chiefly used to connect words:  as, "<i> King</i>  and <i> constitution;</i> " or sentences:  as, "<i> I went to the theatre, </i>  and <i> saw the new pantomime.</i> "<br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 29</b>   A preposition is most commonly <i> set before</i>  another word to show its relation to some word or sentence preceding:  as, "<i> The fisherman went</i>  down<i>  the river</i>  with <i> his boat.</i> "<br>  <br>     <i> Conjunctions</i>  and <i> Prepositions</i>  are for the most part <i> Imperative moods</i>  of obsolete verbs:  Thus, <i> and</i>  signifies <i> add</i> :  "<i> John</i>  and <i> Peter --John</i>  add <i>  Peter:" -- "The fisherman</i>  with<i>  his boat -- The fisherman, </i>  join <i>  his boat."</i> <br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 30</b>   Interjections are words <i>  thrown in</i>  between the parts of  sentence, to express passions or emotions:  as "<i> Oh!
