O God! what breadth of doom <br>  Awaits me in the ghostly gloom <br>  That stretcheth out beyond the tomb? <br>  <br>  "To die -- to die -- to go where I <br>  May meet with Arthur passing by? <br>  I cannot die -- I cannot die! <br>  <br>  "I whisper to myself his name, <br>  I count the years, I count the shame, <br>  And feel the torture of the flame. <br>  <br>  "I loved him not, yet well I know <br>  I took his life -- and deep and slow <br>  I wrought the wound, I dealt the blow. <br>  <br>  "I know not where his body lies -- <br>  I dare not meet his clear, large eyes, <br>  Bright with the light of Paradise. <br>  <br>  "Why, they would cut me thro' and thro' <br>  Like yonder star, that from the blue <br>  Dissevers this clear drop of dew. <br>  <br>  "O Christ! a little time, I pray, <br>  Yet let me live -- perchance some day <br>  I may not fear to tread the way. <br>  <br>  "Cease, cease, vain prayer -- I am grown old. <br>  The thin white hair that once was gold, <br>  The sunken cheeks, half-gray, half-cold, <br>   <br>   "The shrivelled breast, the sightless eye, <br>   All wan and worn -- they mutely cry, -- <br>   ''Tis time to die! 'tis time to die!' <br>   <br>   "O, I am old and changed! and what <br>   If I should meet with Launcelot <br>   And he should pass and know me not? <br>   <br>   "Methinks my heart would throb and swell <br>   Until it broke again -- ah well, <br>   'Twould make of heaven a twofold hell. <br>   <br>   "To think that we two souls had met <br>   And he passed, with quiet face set <br>   Away from me, so old -- and yet <br>   <br>   "It was not love for him I felt; <br>   No love in me hath ever dwelt <br>   Save love of self. Why, I have knelt <br>   <br>   "And prayed to God for grace for <i> me</i> , <br>   Have moaned and prayed for strength to see <br>   Some hope in gray eternity. <br>   <br>   "And in my prayer no name has mixt <br>   With mine, lest it should come betwixt <br>   My thoughts and God's, and leave unfixt <br>   <br>   "The grace for which I prayed; and now <br>   The death-damp gathers on my brow, <br>   But to God's will I cannot bow. <br>   <br>   "O, I would live! I dread this death, <br>   This sudden sinking of the breath, <br>   With all the mystery beneath; <br>   <br>   "With all the fear beyond the pain, <br>   With all the mist beyond the rain -- <br>   O God! O Christ! I would remain!" <br>   <br>   She lieth dead -- the church-bells toll -- <br>   Fair Father Christ, receive her soul <br>   And make the broken image whole. <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>
