 <p align="LEFT"> ACT  I.</p> 
 <p align="LEFT"> SCENE. -- <i> A wooded spot in the meadows near Camelot.  King Arthur and his Court, who are on their way to meet Guinevere, are arriving.  The scene is full of movement and gaiety. From the distance, gradually growing  louder and nearer, are heard sounds of cheering. It is late afternoon, and the  scene is filled with the golden glow of the setting sun.</i> <br> <br> AGRAVAINE  <i> and </i> VIVIEN <i> converse apart.</i>  MORDRED<i> , at a little distance, stands  buried in moody thought. </i> AGRAVAINE <i> approaches</i>  MORDRED. VIVIEN <i> joins  them.</i> <br> <br> AGRA. My lord, thy moody visage would proclaim<br> Our cause as  lost, while yet our spears are bright,<br> Our bodies whole, our helms without  a dent.<br> <br> [<i> The </i> CROWD <i> cheer in distance.</i> <br> <br> MORD. Like one  struck blind I am grown wise in sound,<br> And pick my way by virtue of mine ears.<br> <br> AGRA.  The sightless needs must go with troubled gait,<br> But, having eyes, <i> we</i>   hold our course unstayed,<br> And beat the craven earth till it resounds<br> Our  praises unto Him that gave us sight.<br> <br> MORD. He that may hear the thunder  of the surf,<br> And feinting that he hears it not, finds death<br> In the chill,  clinging fingers of the deep --<br> Deserves no better fate.<br> <br> AGRA.                         Yet  shall the deaf<br> Not meet his master in the brutish sea,<br> For by the magic  of an eye, he holds<br> In leash the dripping jaws that spit at him,<br> White,  stinging drops of frenzied impotence;<br> While from afar the poor blind hears  the roar,<br> Which clogs his feet with chains of formless fear,<br> And smites  his soul with devastating dread.<br> <br> [<i> Cheers are heard again nearer.</i> <br> <br> MORD.  But when the darkness falls all men are blind:<br> 'Tis then the wise have counsel  of their ears.<br> Ye hear these sounds; wouldst urge me to believe<br> They threaten  naught of ill?<br> <br> AGRA.                         Naught;  save to those<br> That pale at forest echoings, and take<br> A mental ague from  a creaking branch.<br> <br> VIV. Mordred, these shoutings mean us good or ill<br> As  we interpret them.<br> <br> MORD.                         To  me they mean<br> New foes made fast and unsured friends grown cold.<br> Wherever  Arthur moves it is the same;<br> He has the trick of catching man's good will,<br> And  bracing waverers. Let him but roam<br> This vasty, echoing England as he list,<br> And  from Carlisle to sea-scarred Tintagil<br> The whole land would be ringing with  his name.<br> <br> AGRA. Cast off thy gloom, my lord; the public tongue<br> Is but  a wanton, and is little famed<br> For constancy!<br> <br> VIV.                         'Tis  true enough, my lord;<br> These throats that now shout "Arthur" would  as lief<br> Suck wind enough to make the welkin ring<br> With cries of "Mordred"  -- if they had a cause.<br> <br> AGRA. And where shall better cause be found than  in<br> The uncleared doubts of Arthur's ancestry?<br> He calls <i> thee</i>  nephew,  and in that bare word<br> Lies his sole claim and title to the crown.<br> What other  proof can he produce save thee?<br> And if thou say'st he is no kin of thine,<br> Then  art thou King in thine own lawful right.<br> <br> VIV. While Merlin lived, his word  did stand as good<br> As child-bed witnesses, but he is dead.<br> Who now shall  challenge the compelling cry,<br> "This is no son of Uther -- not the King!"<br> <br> MORD.  That cry, my friends, was lisped by last year's leaves,<br> Which have no voice  in this spring's forestry.<br> The rabble ask not how the King is bred,<br> Nor  know, nor care. They love this man as man,<br> And, loving him, I do foresee a  Queen,<br> A new bond 'twixt the people and the King;<br> A double cord where only  one has been.<br> <br> AGRA. Mark well my words: thy fears are placed amiss.<br> The  King has thriven! Truly so -- but how?<br> By being ever at the people's beck,<br> Forswearing  self and soft indulgencies<br> In ceaseless striving for the nation's weal.<br> He  is their friend, their champion, their slave.<br> Let it be so! But will ye see  the end<br> Of this so dear devotion? Then behold --<br> A Queen more beautiful  than earth at dawn,<br> Fairer than moonlight as it steals its way<br> Through lattice  op'nings to a bridal couch.<br> Trust me our model King shall not resist<br> A lure  so sweet, but lend himself entire<br> To love's abandonments, until he finds<br> Duty,  resolve, and Kingship fade away,<br> And leave him, stript of purpose and repute,<br> A  prey to common outcry, and to us.<br> <br> MORD. Yet was my plan more swift. With  Launcelot<br> And numbers of our most feared knights away<br> In far Cameliard,  or capering<br> Attendance on the homing Guinevere<br> In the long stages of their  slow return;<br> With ferment in the West, and at the Court<br> No thought of pending  harm -- We should have struck,<br> Suddenly and swift, on Westminster, before<br> The  Queen's strong escort had rejoined the King.<br> <br> AGRA. The time had been misjudged,  and thy whole plan<br> Foredoomed to failure. Were we now to strike,<br> This crowd  would forge an armour for the King<br> Of bodies interwoven, against which<br> All  mortal blades were vincible. But wait<br> Until they see their idol dallying<br> In  soft, assotted fondness on the Queen;<br> See him grown smooth with pleasuring  and round<br> With table practices; show them a King<br> Unfaithful to the promise  of his youth --<br> Then may we strike and have these mouthing churls<br> Not fronting  us, but charging at our backs.<br> <br> VIV. [<i> With eager curiosity.</i> ] When  didst thou see the lady Guinevere?<br> <br> AGRA. 'Twas in her native land, Cameliard,<br> When  I was hunting there an autumn since.<br> I saw the damsel oft, but wot I best<br> Of  my first sight of her. 'Twas on a morn<br> All grey as agelong night. Upon the  castle hill<br> Fierce shadows flung themselves, like shapeless beasts<br> Upon  a dying foe, and earth lay stunned<br> 'Neath their benumbing touch. When suddenly<br> The  grey walls cleft and issued forth a maid --<br> A fair white maid with streaming  hair of gold,<br> That brake upon her shoulders and flowed down,<br> A gleaming  amber torrent, to her feet.<br> She seemed like sunlight glinting from a rock,<br> And  where she walked the sombre earth was sewn<br> With a lithe-moving skein of gold.<br> <br> MORD.                                      Perdy!<br> But  these same lily-maids in Nature's way<br> Develop dangerously. Shall we then<br> Stand  idly by while Nature hatches us<br> New claimants for our crown?<br> <br> VIV.                                     Nay,  have no fear<br> Of Nature, till thou need her tenderings.<br> I trust her least  when she's at midwif'ry.<br> Quick to undo what is so hardly done,<br> Unmaking  always swifter than she makes,<br> So loth to spare, so keen to seize again,<br> She  covets life from life's first death-bought breath.<br> If I must take Dame Nature  for my friend,<br> Give me suspense of her good services<br> Till I be harvesting.<br> <br> AGRA.                          Ere  Nature deals<br> Our cause a hurt in form of Arthur's heir,<br> We have large time  to shape our plans.<br> <br> VIV.                                                 And  time<br> To act on them. Either appeal to might<br> And press the issue at the lance's  point,<br> Or hold us still, what time our Royal prey,<br> Steeped in deep draughts  of stupefying ease,<br> Sinks to that sleep which never is renewed.<br> <br> AGRA.  'Tis as shall be, and being so, 'tis well.<br> <br> MORD. [<i> Roused from a reverie,  and angrily.</i> ] 'Tis well, ye say! How well? I swear 'tis ill<br> Ye judge this  priestly lord as some raw youth,<br> Fierce and incontinent from long restraint.<br> Ye  know not Arthur well who judge him so.<br> The source of his famed purity is ice.<br> In  time he may be thawed. What! Are we Gods<br> To sew the hours and reap the centuries?<br> A  year at least 'twill take his pious eyes<br> To learn her charms. A further year  ere yet<br> He soils his virgin conscience with desire.<br> God wot how long we  bite our nails the while<br> He sways between desire and the desired.<br> Life is  too short to wait for this green fruit<br> To ripe and fall, full rotten, in our  palm.<br> God send him West to-night to quell the strife,<br> And I'll delay no  longer than the dawn<br> To compass our bold ends by bolder means.<br> I'll waste  no patience paltering with knots<br> That may be carved asunder at a blow;<br> Nor  doze beside a snare while I have strength<br> To bring my quarry down in open fight.<br> <br> [<i> Enter  </i> ARTHUR<i> , with</i>  KNIGHTS<i>  and </i> MESSENGER.<br> <br> AGRA. Here Arthur  comes. Methinks I'd liever wait<br> To pull his tusks, till that old boar was dead.<br> <br> ARTH.  [<i> To a</i>  MESSENGER.] My lords, we'll bide no more in this green spot<br> The  coming of the Queen. If from Sir Bors<br> Or Launcelot come other messengers,<br> Let  them attend at once.<br> <br> [<i> Exit </i> MESSENGER.<br> <br> MORD.                         Hast  news, my lord,<br> That bars our onward march?<br> <br> ARTH.                                     So  much of news<br> That love's advance has ended in retreat.<br> Our toes are even  turned upon our heels;<br> Our laggard tail has ta'en itself a head,<br> That points  our duty far from our desires!<br> <br> VIV. Sir King, 'tis easy seen some fresh  unrest<br> Is tangled in the web of thy concerns.<br> <br> ARTH. Our message still  lacks answer from the Welsh.<br> With no alarm, but some uneasiness,<br> We question  the intent of this delay.<br> Sir Bors is waiting at his charger's head,<br> One  eye on us and one fixed on the West,<br> And cannot tell which whither he will  ride.<br> While we, impatient to be on, must keep<br> In distance of his call. If  we discharge<br> The short few miles that hold us from the Queen,<br> We put that  distance 'tween us and the men<br> That may have need of me.<br> <br> AGRA.                                     'Tis  no light thing,<br> This task of royalty. It confiscates<br> All small prerogatives  in man, and while<br> It lifts him to the mountain-top, it holds<br> Him fast, as  in the cleavage of a rock.<br> The King scarce dares to call himself, or this<br> Or  that -- husband or friend or lover -- but,<br> Removed from all such fond, enfeebling  ties<br> Of heart and interest, must ever be,<br> And ever know himself to be --  the King!<br> <br> ARTH. Yet would I not, for all it gave in ease<br> Or licence  of life's liberties, renounce<br> One jot of the responsibility<br> That's vested  in the crown. 'Tis privileged<br> For Kings to live and joy and suffer -- ay,<br> And  when death comes, to meet it like a King.<br> Come, nephew; come, my Lady Vivien,<br> Who  wilt be friend and kin to Guinevere;<br> I'd have thee know my purpose for the  Queen,<br> Lest day should find us speeding to the West.<br> <br> [<i> Exit </i> ARTHUR  <i> and</i>  MORDRED. VIVIEN <i> stands in deep thought.</i> <br> <br> AGRA. [<i> Significantly  to</i>  VIVIEN.] A day will come we shall recall with smiles<br> These windy words  of Sir Morality,<br> And judge poor Adam's fall with less contempt.<br> <br> VIV.  [<i> In a tone of earnest enquiry.</i> ] Is she so beautiful, so wondrous fair,<br> That  e'en the stainless Arthur shall forget<br> His conscience as he looks on her?<br> <br> AGRA.                                                  So  fair,<br> As he is man he cannot choose but look,<br> And as he looks, forget. And  so forgetting, die.<br> Let us go chase our tails to Camelot!<br> <br> [<i> Exit</i>   AGRAVAINE.<br> <i> <br> </i> VIV. [<i> Meditatively.</i> ]<br> And as he looks forget!  [<i> With sudden animation.</i> ]<br>                                     But  he? But Launcelot?<br> Shall she subdue the proud, responseless heart,<br> That  has disdained a beauty not less rare?<br> Ah God! shall Launcelot withstand a snare<br> That  threats the resolution of the King?<br> Yet I'll believe it not, till I have seen<br> With  my own eyes. Till then I'll not believe.<br> <br> [<i> Exit</i>  VIVIEN <i> hurriedly.</i> <br> </p> 
 <p align="LEFT"> SCENE  II. -- The same.<br> <i> The stage remains empty for some moments, and the sound  of distant cheers shows that the retinue of </i> KING ARTHUR<i>  is already well  on the return journey. Presently, from the opposite direction, is heard the sound  of</i>  MUSIC<i> , and the cavalcade that is escorting</i>  GUINEVERE <i> to </i> CAMELOT  <i> make a leisurely appearance. The cavalcade crosses the stage on horseback and  on foot. Their voices die away in the distance.</i> <br> <br> CHORUS.<br> Pink and  white, O flower of Spring,<br>       Spread a carpet  fair and sweet,<br> Deck her progress to the King,<br>       Drop  to kiss her lily feet.<br> She is come, the bride of May,<br>       Speed  her to the morrow;<br> Sweet the May and sweet the day,<br>       And  sweet, more sweet, the morrow.<br> Pink and white above her head,<br>       Curtain  her till morning light,<br> Burst thy heart to strew her bed,<br>       'Neath  the canopy of night.<br> She is here, the bride of May,<br>       Guard  her to the morrow.<br> Sweet the May and sweet the day,<br>       O  haste the sweeter morrow.</p> 
 <p align="LEFT"> [<i> During the singing of the latter  part, off,</i>  GUINEVERE <i> and </i> LAUNCELOT <i> enter.</i> </p> 
 <p align="LEFT"> GUIN.  Tell me again, Sir Knight, of this great King<br> Whose bride I am to be. Unless,  perchance,<br> I weary thee with ceaseless questionings.<br> <br> LAUNC. My Queen,  I doubt if aught remains untold;<br> But since what was to tell, was good to hear,<br> List  once again of him that serves no lord<br> But conscience, and of all his Knights  requires<br> But this -- that they revere their conscience as the King.<br> <br> GUIN.  Tell me, my lord, are all of Arthur's Court<br> Like unto thee in likeness to the  King?<br> <br> LAUNC. He has no like or similar, but is to men<br> Even as thou among  the Queens of Earth.<br> <br> GUIN. Ah no! I am of those that he transcends.<br> I  tremble, but in lifting up mine eyes<br> To his high state. How shall he mate with  one<br> Who draws her being from the lowly earth?<br> The sun is in my blood, and  my poor heart<br> Is caught by every breath of life and swayed,<br> As leaves are  lift and rustled by the breeze,<br> That wills nor works them harm. I have been  taught<br> To love all that is worshipful and true,<br> Because 'tis good and not  for conscience sake.<br> And must I now lay siege unto myself,<br> Usurp the guards  that Nature gave, and arm<br> My heart with duty, and the law of Kings?<br> <br> LAUNC.  As truth's unconscious beauty is to thee,<br> Is conscience to the King -- no striving,<br> But  the unstudied working of a mind<br> That dwells on none in search of littleness,<br> But  holds all flesh in fair equality.<br> No maiden's heart could be more sure bestowed,<br> Nor  maiden's faith find safer harbourage,<br> Than in the keeping of our England's  King.<br> <br> GUIN. Sir Knight, I like thy hymning of his praise,<br> And his great  virtues may not plead in vain<br> The truage due to his nobility.<br> But for his  Kingship, hast thou yet to learn,<br> For ev'ry maid there is but one true King?<br> He  is not crowned with shout or gilded pomp,<br> Nor flashes to the sky from quick  drawn steel,<br> The cartel of his liege's loyalty.<br> But on his throne, secure,  inviolate,<br> The siege set up within a maiden's heart,<br> He reigns sole lord,  and wields a sway supreme,<br> Unconscious of his own dear sovereignty.<br> <br> LAUNC.  If this be so, then must I hold myself<br> Most honoured among Knights, in that  I bring<br> A Queen to grace our England: for the King,<br> A Kingdom fairer than  men's eyes have seen.<br> <br> GUIN. Hast thou, my lord, thy rightful Kingdom won,<br> Or  is it still unsought for, undesired?<br> <br> LAUNC. Kingdoms have come and gone  and are forgot,<br> And thrones will fall before the thrones to be,<br> But beauty,  labouring in joy, brought forth<br> One queen to stand as pattern for all time,<br> And  at that birth fulfilled herself. So must<br> She barren be of Queens for evermore.<br> <br> GUIN.  [<i> Sadly.</i> ] Long live thy Queen, Sir Knight, and long thy reign<br> In the  rich kingdom of thy lady's heart.<br> <br> LAUNC. Ah, deem me not so blest! The  throne I sought<br> Is changed from throne to shrine at my approach,<br> And low  before the saint that stands within,<br> Where I may never kneel, another kneels.<br> <br> GUIN.  I too can see, it must be with thine eyes,<br> That miscalled saint, that looks  not down but forth,<br> From him that kneels to one that stands beyond.<br> <br> LAUNC.  I pray that God who fashioned love's sweet throne<br> In her pure heart, may furnish  her the guard<br> To hold it 'gainst the base, usurping Knight,<br> Who, helplessly  impelled to the attack,<br> Would rend the bonds that bind him to his friend,<br> Scatter  like straws, love, loyalty and truth<br> And thrust himself, a traitor, on the  throne.<br> <br> GUIN. No traitor! He that conquers is the King.<br> No traitor,  but the lord of his own realm.<br> <br> LAUNC. [<i> As one reading his own impeachment.</i> ]<br> Traitor  to him, who, holding one his friend,<br> Did speed him forth to bring again his  bride.<br> To him who clasped his hand long since, and vowed,<br> "Let chance  what will, I trust thee to the death."<br> So dear he prized that trust, he  had defied<br> Or love or hate to prove him what he is --<br> Traitor to self and  faithless to his liege,<br> <br> [<i> Turning to </i> GUINEVERE<i>  directly.</i> ]<br> <br> False  to the uttermost -- even to thee!<br> <br> GUIN. O Launcelot, forbear! If this be  true,<br> And thou art sunder'd from thy nobler self,<br> The sin is mine, the sinning  and the shame.<br> My lord, I ask no vow, nor need a pledge<br> But this, in knowing  thee, I surely know --<br> That not in Earth nor Hell, nor in high Heaven<br> Is  found that spell could make thee false to me.<br> <br> LAUNC. My Queen, I have no  words to plead thy grace,<br> For fear has set a seal upon my mouth,<br> And love  has fired my blood with treachery<br> And ravished all my senses of their worth.<br> For  I that swore to slay or to be slain<br> In ward of thy fair name and fairest self,<br> Am  shaming thee, in telling thee my shame.<br> Another day and I had held my peace!<br> Another  day --<br> <br> GUIN.             So  soon we are to part,<br> Another day!<br> <br> LAUNC.             To-morrow  and the end!<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> As one in a dream -- unheeding him.</i> ] So soon  it is that even as we stand<br> The morrow comes, the morrow and the end.<br> How  swift it dies, the day that's born to die,<br> And spends all day a-dying.<br> <br> LAUNC.                                      O  my Queen,<br> Hast thou no word for very pity's sake?<br> No murmur of forgiveness  and farewell?<br> <br> GUIN. No word but this -- this, that I must have died<br> Hadst  thou kept silence! [<i> Quite simply.</i> ]<br>                                                 For  so it is to love.<br> <br> LAUNC. [<i> Standing before her.</i> ] Queen, if I have  thy love, lift but thine eyes<br> That I may read thy heart. Thou lovest me?<br> [<i> She  raises her eyes and he gazes into them.</i> ]<br> God's miracle! [<i> He starts back  in amazement.</i> ] My face reflected deep<br> In wells of molten sky. [<i> With  conviction.</i> ]<br>                                     Thou  lovest me!<br> <br> GUIN. Since first those dear-loved eyes communed with mine!<br> Since  then, or ever then. My love was given<br> Ere thou didst look on me. When, as I  stood<br> Close hidden by the arras in the hall,<br> I saw thee tower above my father's  frame;<br> And as I linger'd there, mine arms crept up,<br> Crept softly up and  met about thy neck,<br> My mouth was longing raised to touch thy mouth.<br> Why  wast thou not the King, that all my days<br> I had been spared this vain attempt  to wrest<br> Mine arms from off thy neck?<br> <br> LAUNC. [<i> In desperation.</i> ]  Ah, hear me, Love --<br> Thou wilt be prized as wife has never been,<br> By one  more great than earth has ever known.<br> True-hearted, gentle, constant as a rock,<br> He'll  hold thee in a love that shall outlive<br> All things but love itself. [<i> Earnestly.</i> ]  God find my words<br> A passage to thy heart, and give me wit<br> To plead his cause  aright.<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> Vehemently.</i> ] His cause? His cause?<br> 'Tis not his  cause but rather is it mine<br> Thou urgest with such ardent cruelty,<br> To teach  my heart how desp'rate is its case.<br> God's pity at our need light on us all,<br> Since  with such steadfastness as he shall love<br> Must I love thee, for ever, and in  vain.<br> <br> LAUNC. [<i> In a tone of guilty, triumphant resignation.</i> ] Now,  Love, I have nor trust nor plighted friend,<br> And hope of Heav'n is turned to  Heav'n itself.<br> Nought have I left to pray for, having all<br> That heart can  crave, or God in love can give.<br> <br> [<i> He is still absorbed with guilty wonder  at the inevitable, but she has accepted it without thought of shame or astonishment.</i> <br> <br> GUIN.  I have known always that I had thy love:<br> Is't not strange, although thou saidst  no word, I knew?<br> But while I was so sure, I could not rest<br> Till thou hadst  told it over in my ear.<br> Each day I waited longing, and each night<br> I said,  "To-morrow. He will speak to-morrow."<br> And then I cried a little quietly,<br> Nor  could tell why, save that I loved thee so.<br> But on a night I thought, "He  will not speak,"<br> And then the pain near made me cry aloud;<br> And now  I think I ne'er shall weep again.<br> <br> LAUNC. How shall I say all thy love holds  for me?<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> With a sigh of great contentment.</i> ] Is it so much  to thee, so very much,<br> That I do love thee?<br> <br> LAUNC.                          'Tis more than all the world!<br> I'd have thee in my heart, that come what will,<br> There  is nought else to live for or to die.<br> I'd have thee in my arms, that quick  or dead,<br> I am immortal grown, past touch of grief.<br> I think on thee till  thinking is a pain,<br> And when I look on thee, the rebel blood<br> Mounts hotly  to my cheek, and I am glad<br> That thou hast not the skill to read my heart.<br> <br> GUIN.  Nay, Love, blush not, lest thou would have me shame<br> To meet thy gaze. Hast  thou one thought I may not share,<br> Or one desire in which I have no part?<br> This  is our hour and life, poor life, that holds<br> For each and all but one such perfect  hour,<br> Should close at its fulfilment. Just on hour<br> Close held in thy dear  arms, is worth a world<br> Of lives where thou art not. For now I know<br> That  I am mine own self, and I am thine;<br> Thine for thine own, and, without measure,  thine.<br> <br> LAUNC. O that we two, we two together now,<br> In this our hour,  heart fiercely knit to heart,<br> And lip on lip inseparably sealed,<br> Might put  to sea on life's receding tide,<br> And outward drifting, drifting, disappear<br> In  th'illimitable ocean of our love.<br> <br> [<i> A Pause.</i> ]<br> <br> LAUNC. Why was  I born unless it was to love thee?<br> <br> GUIN. Why have we met, if I was not  to yield?<br> <br> [LAUNCELOT <i> catches</i>  GUINEVERE <i> to his breast. Trembling  but unresisting she lies in his embrace. The faint strains of a distant chorus  is heard. Without a word they turn and he leads her slowly into the forest. During  the foregoing, the sun has set, and the light has changed to a pearly grey. A  nightingale has sung in the branches, and the moon has risen. As the lovers disappear  into the forest, the moon passes behind a cloud and the scene becomes dark.</i> </p> 
 <p align="LEFT"> SCENE  III. -- <i> The same. In the interval of darkness the </i> MUSIC <i> denotes the  passing of the night and dawning of day. When the sun rises on the scene, the  </i> KNIGHTS <i> and</i>  LADIES <i> and</i>  COMMONERS <i> of England, gaily dressed,  are awaiting the arrival of the </i> QUEEN<i> .

 <p align="LEFT"> CURTAIN.</p> 
 <p align="LEFT"> ACT  II.</p> 
 <p align="LEFT"> SCENE. -- A terrace in the Palace of Westminster. A banqueting  hall at the back is partitioned off by curtains stretched between stone pillars.  The table in the inner hall is fully spread for feasting. At the back of this  hall is a large, iron-barred window.</p> 
 <p align="LEFT"> [SQUIRES <i> and</i>  WAITING  MAIDS <i> lounge on the terrace. </i> SERVING LADS <i> carry dishes at intervals  into the inner hall.</i> <br> <br> [SIR MORDRED <i> and </i> VIVIEN <i> converse apart.</i> <br> <br> VIV.  Go, get thee hence; no purpose can be served<br> By further tarrying. I have strawed  well,<br> My lord, and the procreant seeds have struck<br> Deep in a rich and fertile  soil. Do thou<br> Seek us out yeomen bred to scythe and flail,<br> While I keep  ward beside the riping corn.<br> So fast it ripes. Ere thou return, I may<br> Have  need to ply my sickle warily.<br> <br> MORD. At once I go and come again with speed.<br> The  Western firmament is streaked with red,<br> Reflected from fierce forges, where  our men<br> Fashion new glaives against the harvesting.<br> The enterprise gains  ground, and at our need<br> These palsied Knights are witched into unrest,<br> And  fret themselves with wasting discontent.<br> Arthur himself scents mischief, yet  it seems<br> He nothing knows of what these others see,<br> Between the Queen and  his most trusted Knight.<br> <br> VIV. It is not what they see, but what they hear,<br> And  hearing they think they see -- they know not what!<br> Nor rightly understand what  they do hear.<br> <br> MORD. They make the fair Queen's frailty a cloak<br> For their  own wantonness, yet seek to rend<br> The very rag they take to shelter them.<br> She  may be frail, I know not, she is fair,<br> And beauty will be served though Heav'n  itself<br> Contest the first place in a husband's thought.<br> Wot ye I told they  wit not Arthur well,<br> Who thought to see him bind this scarf of love<br> So tight  about his trunk, that it would turn<br> His blood to syrup, or make weak his step,<br> Or  lengthen out his slumbers by an hour.<br> He uses beauty to adorn his crown,<br> And  treats love as an altar ornament.<br> Lips in his creed were only made for pray'rs,<br> And  bodies for anointing. Is it strange<br> If Guinevere rebels against a creed<br> So  coldly pure?<br> <br> VIV.                         Thy  judgment speaks the man;<br> Too graced with mercy to condemn her quite,<br> Too  wise to count her guiltless. List to me --<br> In twice two months since Launcelot  returned,<br> Dight in new honours and the sheen of war,<br> The twain have met  but twice. Once weeks ago,<br> And once again to-day.<br> <br> MORD.                         Yet  in my ear<br> Mean murmurs have grown great with certainty.<br> <br> VIV. The loud  re-echoings of whispered hints<br> Projected by a glance. Mute suspicionings<br> Borne  on the breath of envy. But I will swear<br> I know not man nor woman, no nor love,<br> If  love has called them not or called in vain.</p>

 <p align="LEFT"> MORD. Seest thou bluff Mador and that Knave,  Patrise,<br> The Court's recording devil? How comes he<br> So distant from his house  at such an hour?<br> <br> VIV. He is included of some score of guests,<br> The lesser  Knights of Arthur's fellowship,<br> Who feast anon with Guinevere.<br> <br> MORD.                                      Methinks<br> He  comes to feast with a most fasting face.<br> <br> VIV. A useful rogue that loves  a secret well,<br> And shares it gladly; that envies no man<br> Save his hidden  thoughts --<br> <br> MORD.                                     And  ponders human hearts<br> As thieves may puzzle o'er a well-keyed chest.<br> He does  not lack suspicion of our plans,<br> And has such purpose in his pick-lock eyes,<br> At  his approach I cover up my mind<br> With generous resolves, nor dare unmask,<br> Till  he be gone again.<br> <br> VIV.                         Be  reassured,<br> He wills to serve our cause.<br> <br> MORD.                                     If  wittingly,<br> Mistrust him with the zeal of Holy Church.<br> <br> VIV.

[<i> Ignoring</i>  MORDRED's <i> irony.</i> ] I chanced upon him even in the hour,<br> Straining  his yellow eyes across the mead<br> On one who ever stopped to gather up<br> This  flower or that, and lay them presently<br> On one, who bent her face upon the gift,<br> As  if to search its sweetness with her lips.<br> For one was Launcelot and one --<br> <br> MORD.                                           Let be!<br> Sir Patrise is most zealous for the King,<br> And sniffs for treason  as a dog for rats.<br> I hate the dog!<br> <br> VIV.             And  he hates us no less.<br> Yet have no fear of him. 'Tis somewhere writ<br> A goodlier  man once took a most grave harm<br> For no worse matter than a lust of fruit.<br> <br> MORD.  Thou second Eve, what thought is in thy mind?<br> <br> VIV.

For that  he dies.<br> Moreover, he suspects the Queen. For that<br> She has small cause to  hold him dear.

[<i> Rising, and rather wearily.</i> ]  Greeting, my Lord; has fortune mocked the chase<br> That ye repair to us thus soon?<br> <br> ARTH.                                      Thus  soon!<br> The phrase doth argue cheerfulness of mind,<br> And weary hours made light  with busyness!<br> <br> GUIN. Is it already late?<br> <br> ARTH.                         'Tis  late enough,<br> For those that mark time's passage by the glass.<br> The day that  'scaped so gladly from the night,<br> And joyed in freedom and the sun's high noon,<br> Already  tires of its brief liberty<br> And creeps again into the friendly dark.<br> The  boar has joined himself unto the night,<br> That old-time enemy of man, that turns<br> Our  sharpest spears to bulrushes, and makes<br> All paths a maze and a bewilderment.<br> <br> VIV.  'Tis in the night, my Lord, that vaunting man<br> Is worse advantaged than his  meanest foe;<br> Then, like a child whose candle is outblown,<br> He quails at sense  of his sheer helplessness.<br> <br> ARTH. He hunts too long that hunting still is  caught. [<i> With an ominous tone in his voice.</i> ]<br> There is a time for pressing  and for pause,<br> A time when man must glance from left to right,<br> If that he  still does lead in the pursuit,<br> Or if pursued, to learn from whom he flees.<br> <br> GUIN.  What mean these words, my Lord? What humour strikes<br> That unaccustomed, harsh  chord in thy voice?<br> Is it some danger that thou ponderest?<br> <br> ARTH. Danger?  why no, 'twas but a whimsy thought;<br> My mind in idleness goes gathering<br> 'Midst  vague, unformed, unfashionable doubts;<br> What doubts and why and whence, I wit  not well,<br> Nor doubt there is no reason for my doubts.<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> Regarding  him anxiously.</i> ] Yet thy calm face, that once was wont to be<br> A re-assurance,  now is ruffled o'er<br> With gusts of care and little questionings.<br> <br> ARTH.                                                  Nay,  mark it not,<br> But sing to me some comforting conceits.<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> Hastily.</i> ]  Nay, my good Lord.<br> <br> ARTH. What! Hast thou not one song<br> That can confirm  the comfort of a crown,<br> Or reconstruct for doubling royalty<br> Its image as  a thing to be desired?<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> With increasing distress.</i> ] My Lord,  my Lord, I have no heart for song,<br> Nor stomach for the feast. I prithee of<br> Thy  gentleness --<br> <br> ARTH.                         Nay,  pray me not, my Queen,<br> When did I ever urge thee 'gainst thy wish?<br> The chilling  fear, stern pencil's legacy,<br> Is on thee yet, and thy sweet woman's heart,<br> So  unfamiliar with the thought of ill,<br> Still throbs with recollection. Have thy  wish!<br> 'Tis in man's temper to forget the throes<br> Of ancient peril; once 'tis  overborne<br> 'Tis then no more than it had ever been.<br> So all new trouble finds  him void of fear.<br> For Nature wraps a smooth forgetfulness<br> Of danger close  about his head, and through<br> The rift left cunningly, he only marks<br> The course  stretched out before him, and beyond,<br> The goal already crowned with victory.<br> But  woman ne'er out-distances her grief;<br> It runs before to mock the day, and makes<br> The  future dread with instant menaces<br> Of repetition of the past's unrest.<br> <br> GUIN.  Shall I outlive the thought that I am called<br> Destroyer of good Knights? that  I was charged<br> Of robbing one, of God's fair gift of life?<br> Or that, because  of me, another Knight<br> Rendered his life, unasked, into God's hands?<br> There  are some griefs defy forgetfulness!<br> <br> ARTH. Think not that any dies, until  his death<br> Is prospered by the countenance of God.<br> Man dies not when he wills,  but as God lists,<br> Nor no man kills unauthorised of Him.<br> <br> GUIN. Still  may one grieve to be the instrument<br> Of doom -- to stand for all men as a sign<br> Of  God's incarnate wrath.<br> <br> VIV.                                     Nay,  Guinevere,<br> To me, thy lot is not to mourn that death<br> By thee has ta'en a  pair of lusty knights,<br> But that by God's good grace, and with the aid<br> Of  the stout sinew of a knightly arm,<br> Thou livest still.<br> <br> ARTH.             He  reapeth as He wills,<br> 'Tis not for us to question where He takes,<br> Or where  His mercy spares.<br> [<i> To his </i> SQUIRE.] How comes it, Sir,<br> I have not  yet the knowledge I required<br> Of that unknown and valorous good Knight<br> That  did maintain the cause of Guinevere,<br> And made of her accuser and his charge<br> A  stark and bleeding stillness?<br> <br> SQUIRE.                                     Sir  King, we have<br> No tidings of him either good or ill,<br> Save that he went, low-bending,  wounded-wise,<br> Upon his horse, as one that goes to death;<br> And all our seeking  for him has been vain.<br> <br> ARTH. It much repents me that he 'voided us,<br> Ere  we had seen his hurt or learnt his name,<br> Or thanked him for his knightly services.<br> <br> VIV.  Had Launcelot been here this search had not<br> Proved profitless, for he doth  know the wood<br> Both far and near.

[<i> With nervous agitation.</i> ] My Lord, thy riddles are beyond my wit;<br> My  mind is subject to some sickly spell,<br> That stands revealed in sharp impatiences,<br> And  aftermaths of impotent regrets.<br> <br> ARTH. Poor troubled one, I will not vex  thy mind<br> With selfish confidence, or magnify<br> The burden of thy fears. Forgive  me, Love; [<i> He bends down and kisses her on the forehead.</i> ]<br> Farewell!<br> <br> GUIN.              Farewell,  my Lord.<br> <br> ARTH.                         God  send thee sleep.<br> [<i> Exit </i> ARTHUR <i> in troubled thought. </i> VIVIEN <i> lingers  in the background.</i> <br> <br> GUIN.

It is bolted.</i> <br> <br> [<i> At the same moment a loud knocking  is heard at the opposite door and the voice of the </i> KING <i> calls on them to  open.</i> <br> <br> [LAUNCELOT <i> returns silently to </i> GUINEVERE <i> and raises  her to her feet. As silently she takes her stand beside her lover. The uproar  outside grows louder. </i> LAUNCELOT <i> unsheathes his sword as the door is beaten  down and </i> ARTHUR <i> enters, followed by a crowd of </i> KNIGHTS<i> , bearing  torches which fill the stage with a blaze of light. </i> VIVIEN<i> , who accompanies  the </i> KING<i> , glances from him to the lovers with hate and triumph gleaming  in her eyes. For some moments </i> ARTHUR <i> stands without speaking, stunned by  the discovery.</i> <br> <br> VIV. My lord, did I not bear thee good report?<br> Or  is this not the trusted Knight,<br> Thou didst lament an hour ago?<br> <br> [<i> The  </i> KING <i> does not heed her.</i> ]<br> <br> LAUNC. [<i> Moving a step towards the  </i> KING]<br>                                                 Sir  King --<br> <br> ARTH. [<i> With a majestic gesture.</i> ] Nay, do not stir; a moment  hold you still.<br> The end is come, and my poor reason strays<br> Amid the wreckage  of this stricken thing<br> That was the King. Now are all dear hopes dead,<br> And  all I thought so near has taken wings<br> And fled beyond the reach of human hands!<br> O  ne'er was sin in such brave guise arrayed,<br> Or vileness dight in such pure loveliness.<br> Unto  ye two I plighted love and faith,<br> Into your hands, as 'twere a ball, I placed<br> My  England's honour. Ye have let it fall,<br> And I have lived to see it in the dust.<br> Was  it so mean a thing, so slight a trust,<br> That ye, my wife and my most trusted  Knight --<br> Twin sources of the strength on which I leaned --<br> Should by your  sinning make an endless shame<br> To all my hopes, and in the making lend<br> Your  honoured names to foul disloyalty? <br> God's mercy on our land, the end is near,<br> Now  noble knights betray their sacred trust,<br> And Queens discard their vows of chastity,<br> And  virtue bleaches on the sands of shame.<br> The sword is bared again, red burns  the sun,<br> The old sore of corruption gapes afresh,<br> "The Kingdom backward  reels into the beast,"<br> And all's undone that never was done true.<br> <br> LAUNC.  [<i> In cold, measured tones.</i> ] As Guinevere has ever been to me,<br> My lady  and my lord's most noble Queen,<br> I swear the only mischief to atone<br> Is that  embraced in thy rash calumny.<br> <br> ARTH. [<i> Contemptuously.</i> ] Sir Knight,  that quick flung charge of calumny<br> Is ever ready in a traitor's mouth.<br> <br> LAUNC.  Sir King, I swear again and then no more.<br> For naught of evil was I summoned  here,<br> Nor aught of evil stayed me. This I swear.<br> [<i> With sudden heat.</i> ]  My Liege, thou ever hast been overkind<br> With those that murmured treason 'gainst  the Queen,<br> And now 'tis in my mind that on a day<br> I fought her fight whilst  thou stood idly by,<br> Immovable, austere, and dark of brow,<br> As questioning  the merits of the charge.<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> Breaking in between them and speaking  with gathering emphasis as she proceeds.</i> ] My lords, my husband and my friend,  no more --<br> Dispute no more, but let there be an end.<br> My life is not so sweet  I shrink from death,<br> Nor death so bitter that I long to live.<br> I make sore  dole that some would have me dead,<br> But hug the joy that one for me would die.<br> And  yet I lie not when I say ye lie<br> In charging me with shame! I had been dead,<br> So  long ago, but for the friend that thrust<br> His loyal body 'twixt me and the flame.<br> My  lords, which errant of ye all did hold<br> By Guinevere, when danger lit her sky?<br> These  lips are red with blood he shed for me,<br> And yet I lie not, saying that ye lie!<br> Since  first I came, my heart has ever roamed<br> Loveless through Arthur's halls, and  quite alone,<br> While <i> he</i>  was near that loved me as his soul.<br> Love is  not shame, nor lack of love a crime;<br> I speak God's truth, and tell ye that  ye lie!<br> <br> ARTH. No more! I'll hear no more! Take her away!<br> <br> [<i> A loud  disturbance is heard without, and a voice crying, "My Lord the King! Bring  me to the King!"</i> <br> <br> What noise is that?<br> <br> 1ST KNIGHT.             Some  messenger, my Lord.<br> <br> [<i> Enter a </i> MESSENGER<i> , breathless and dishevelled  with hard riding. He bursts through the throng and kneels before the </i> KING.  VIVIEN <i> starts at his entrance as if she realises that </i> SIR MORDRED<i> 's  plot has failed through her neglect in placing guards at the doors. She edges  into the background.</i> <br> <br> MESSENGER. My liege, I come to thee with evil  news.<br> <br> ARTH. Ill tidings come amain. Whence? Whence? Be brief!<br> <br> MESSENGER.  I fled the camp of Mordred and King Mark.<br> <br> 1ST KNIGHT. Of Mordred and King  Mark?<br> <br> 2ND KNIGHT.                         What  meaneth this?<br> <br> 3RD KNIGHT. Are they allied?<br> <br> 4TH KNIGHT. What brings  Mark from the West?<br> <br> MESSENGER. My lord, false Mordred and King Mark are  joined,<br> They camp from Westminster not twenty miles,<br> And traitor Knights  of thine own fellowship --<br> Won by great promises of gain, and tales<br> Of weakness,  treachery and sin at Court --<br> Are hasting to their ranks. This very night<br> At  rise of moon, they move to the attack.<br> <br> ARTH. [<i> In ringing tones of strong  excitement.</i> ] Now by God's rood what make of man art thou<br> That dares miscall  such lusty tidings bad?<br> To arms, my lords; in blood and not in rheum,<br> We'll  drown the mem'ry of our royal shame.<br> No more ye fight for Arthur and a cause,<br> But  for your homes and children and your lives.<br> True Knight and traitor, we'll  ride heel to heel,<br> And fall like vengeance on this rebel crew,<br> To die --  God's pity, if we may! -- to die,<br> Hot with the sweat of bloody victory.<br> <br> [<i> To</i>   GUINEVERE <i> -- in cold, passionless tones.</i> ]<br> <br> And thou, bide thou within  the holy house,<br> Until the threated danger shall be past.<br> If I shall die,  live on; but wit ye well<br> Ye have no cause to pray that I shall live.<br> <br> GUIN.  [<i> In clear, commanding tones.</i> ] My liege, I still am Queen, and I demand<br> By  right as Queen -- I do not ask a boon --<br> That word be sent me of this coming  fight.<br> <br> ARTH. The right is thine. The news shall reach thee straight.<br> Shrive  thee and be anealed. Thy destiny<br> Will be between the lips of him that comes,<br> And  on his tongue shalt thou find life or death.<br> <br> GUIN. I am content. One lord  of all thy court<br> Thou counted worthy to escort thy bride<br> To Camelot. I will  abide thy choice.<br> Send him again to me, that I may learn<br> My doom from him  whom thou didst one time bless<br> In bringing me -- my Knight, Sir Launcelot.<br> </p> 
 <p align="LEFT"> SCENE  II. --<i>  The Chapel of the Convent. Before an altar the NUNS are going through  their morning devotions. Day is breaking, but the place is dimly lit with candles  upon the altar, etc. The service is Lauds, and the NUNS are chanting the Benediction.</i> <br> <br> [<i> Enter</i>   GUINEVERE <i> suddenly, interrupting the chant. She approaches the</i>  ABBESS.<br> <br> GUIN.  Good Mother, have ye aught of tidings yet?<br> No swifting harbinger of ill? No  word<br> By one brought early wounded to thy care?<br> Or have ye that of news ye  fear to speak?<br> Ah! hide it not, but give me dear relief<br> From this incertitude!<br> <br> ABBESS.              Have patience,  child!<br> <br> GUIN. These mocking fears are flames within my brain,<br> And I would  fly this maddening suspense,<br> E'en to the solace of dread madness' self.<br> <br> ABBESS.  We have heard nothing, but the secret night<br> Shall find its silence broken by  new day.<br> 'Tis woman's lot to suffer and to wait;<br> Compose thyself to patience  and to rest.<br> <br> GUIN. To rest! There is no more of rest in earth<br> For Guinevere,  that is herself a cause<br> Of fiery turmoil and the world's unrest.<br> <br> ABBESS.  My daughter, when the tidings come, they shall<br> Be brought thee. Doubt it not.  Whate'er it be,<br> We will hold nothing back. Go thou apart<br> And lay thy heavy  burden on the Lord.<br> <br> GUIN. Ah! Drive me not away to be alone!<br> I'll make  no sound. Let me remain to hear<br> Thy prayers, and pray for me that cannot pray.<br> <br> ABBESS.  Daughter, we pray for thee unceasingly,<br> That God in His good time will lift  His hand<br> And stay thy heart with praise and penitence.<br> <br> [<i> The</i>  NUNS  <i> resume their chanting. The rising sun slowly illumines the scene. The sound  of a horse galloping is presently heard. </i> GUINEVERE <i> leaps to her feet and  rushes to the </i> ABBESS.<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> Fiercely.</i> ] Hearken! O hearken!  Will ye never cease?<br> I hear the music of a horse's hoofs.<br> 'Tis one with  news; he halteth at the door.<br> Speak, Mother, speak, and bid them let him in!<br> <br> [<i> The  doors are thrown open, letting in more light. Enter</i>  LAUNCELOT'S PAGE, <i> travel-stained  and distressed.</i> <br> <br> [<i> To</i>  PAGE <i> with eager intensity.</i> ]<br> <br> Speak,  Sir, what tidings do ye bring?<br> <br> PAGE. [<i> Tongue-tied, with emotion.</i> ]  Madam --<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> Feverishly.</i> ] Stay not to pick thy words. There is  no tongue<br> Can pluck the bitterness from woe, or weave<br> A vestment to make  fair, grief's nakedness.<br> What is thy news?<br> <br> PAGE.                         Madam,  the day is ours.<br> Sir Morded is among the dead.<br> <br> GUIN.                                     Yes!  Yes!<br> Thou seest how we hang upon thy words!<br> Tell on!<br> <br> PAGE. Would  God there were no more to tell!<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> Frantic with impatience.</i> ]  Sir, must we wait till thou art grown a man,<br> To learn thy news? Or would'st  thou have us tear<br> The tidings from thy craven tongue?<br> <br> PAGE.                                                 Lady,<br> Our  sovereign lord, King Arthur, is no more!<br> <br> [GUINEVERE <i> is stunned by the  news, and stands for a moment overcome. The </i> ABBESS <i> goes to her.</i> <br> <br> ABBESS.  He has said, I am thy refuge and thy strength.<br> The Lord that gives, the Lord  that takes away,<br> Have thee in His grace.<br> <br> [GUINEVERE <i> scarcely heeds  the </i> ABBESS, <i> but turns again to</i>  PAGE.<br> <br> GUIN.                         And  he, thy master,<br> How fares Sir Lancelot? Is he of those<br> That live?<br> <br> PAGE.              He follows  with what speed he may.<br> <br> GUIN. He lives! He lives!<br> <br> PAGE.                         Lives,  Madam, but is like to die.<br> <br> GUIN. To die? Ah no! He lives! Thou saidst he  lives.<br> <br> PAGE. He took a hurt intended for the King,<br> Upon whose shoulder  as a shield he hung<br> Throughout the fight.<br> <br> [GUINEVERE <i> trembles and  sways. The </i> ABBESS <i> puts her arms about her. The chant is resumed. Presently  there are more sounds without, and </i> LAUNCELOT <i> enters, supported between  </i> TWO KNIGHTS. <i> He is in full armour save for his helm. He is dazed with loss  of blood, and his sight is failing.</i> <br> <br> LAUNC.             Gently,  fair Sirs; the road<br> Is all composed of unremembered turns,<br> And this new  darkness maketh all things strange.<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> With a great sob.</i> ] Ah  God! he comes to die!<br> <br> LAUNC. I heard a voice<br> Of one afar; a voice made  sweet with tears.<br> Am I not near the Queen?<br> <br> [GUINEVERE <i> crosses over  to</i>  LAUNCELOT.<br> <br> GUIN.                         Aye,  Launcelot,<br> I am that Guinevere that was the Queen.<br> <br> LAUNC. The fight  is done, my Queen. The realm is safe,<br> But he, the King --<br> <br> GUIN.                         I  have been told. And thou --<br> Where is thy wound?<br> <br> LAUNC. [<i> In a far-away  voice.</i> ] He spake no word, but died<br> All silently, as men might die in dreams.<br> <br> GUIN.  [<i> To the supporting</i>  KNIGHTS.] Sirs, bear him tenderly, and set him free<br> From  the misprized enchantment of his mail.<br> [<i> To </i> LAUNCELOT.] Art thou sore  hurt? Yet is there ease in store;<br> Thou wilt bide here till I shall make thee  whole.<br> <br> LAUNC. [<i> Recovering himself.</i> ] My Queen, I may not stay at  thy command.<br> I must go hence, at once, to join the King.<br> 'Tis said by ghostly  men that all will be<br> Fair equals in the beautiful beyond.<br> 'Tis false! I  have no equal there or here;<br> For I have prest my mouth upon thy mouth,<br> And  touched thy golden head, and felt thy heart<br> Beat strong beneath the worship  of my hand.<br> <br> [<i> The QUEEN weeps.</i> ]<br> <br> Weep not, my Queen, but give  me leave to go.<br> <br> [LAUNCELOT <i> steps forward from between the </i> KNIGHTS  <i> that support him and falls with a heavy crash of armour to the ground. </i> GUINEVERE  <i> makes a movement to go to him, but the</i>  ABBESS <i> restrains her.</i> <br> <br> LAUNC.  How shall he wish to live, that in one hour<br> Has lived out all the joy of all  the world?<br> Yet would I crave another boon -- that I<br> Might touch again thy  hand before I go.<br> </p> 
 <p align="LEFT"> [GUINEVERE <i> moves again to him, and  again the </i> ABBESS <i> seizes her arm to restrain her.</i> </p> 
 <p align="LEFT"> ABBESS.  Rash Queen, would'st burn eternally for him?<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> Shaking off her  restraining hand.</i> ] For him, or with him, would I burn for ever!<br> <br> [<i> The  </i> NUNS <i> shrink back from her in horror.</i> <br> <br> GUIN. This love is mine;  I have nought else to give<br> But this, my deathless love, this frailty<br> That  moves me e'en against the will of God,<br> And fills my heart with eager sacrifice.<br> <br> [GUINEVERE  <i> goes to</i>  LAUNCELOT, <i> who is supported against the knee of one of his</i>   KNIGHTS, <i> and bends over him.</i> <br> <br> LAUNC. O Guinevere, 'tis not to die  I grieve,<br> But to die thus, and leave to thee the shame.<br> <br> GUIN. Beloved,  if this love were only mine,<br> I had been dead of shame ere now; but if<br> Some  smallest part of it belong to thee,<br> O deck me bride-wise in the web of it,<br> Or  hang it for a charm upon my breast.<br> <br> LAUNC. [<i> In a low voice of one dying.</i> ]  The sin so sweet that we may not repent,<br> The love that suffers all things.  O my Queen,<br> Thou makest death more sweet to me than life.<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> Kneeling  and holding him in her arms.</i> ]<br> O my dear lord, we love not as we would,<br> But  as love comes to us, and as love wills.<br> Never for us the unpleasant ways of  love,<br> Ours but to love. So soon the end has come,<br> But sithen there could  be no other end,<br> What matter if it come or then or now?<br> Together we go forth  into the night;<br> Let me hold fast thy hand, be close to thee,<br> Lest in the  fearsome passage of the dark<br> I lose thee, and should be afraid. In life,<br> In  death, we are together still,<br> My heart upon thy true heart beats its last.<br> <br> [<i> The  full-risen sun sheds a golden glory on the lovers. </i> GUINEVERE<i>  strains him  to her breast and kisses his mouth. His body quivers for an instant, then his  mailed hand slips from her shoulder and falls to the ground.</i> </p> 
 <p align="LEFT"> GUIN.  Not yet, O God! The time is not quite yet!<br> <br> [<i> Still pressing him to her,  she raises the lifeless arm and replaces it about her neck. Then she falls lifeless  across his body. The </i> NUNS<i>  close the heavy door, shutting out the sunshine.</i> <br> <br> [<i> At  the back of the stage, like a vision, a tableau is shown of the Meadows near Camelot,  with the effect of waning moonlight, as at the close of the Second Scene in the  First Act. The figures of </i> LAUNCELOT<i>  and </i> GUINEVERE<i>  are revealed;  his arm is about her, and her head rests against her shoulder. Slowly they disappear  into the forest -- the moon passes behind a cloud. The entire stage becomes dark.</i> </p>
