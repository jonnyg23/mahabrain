SIR GALAHAD. SIR BORS DE GANYS.<br>  <br>   SIR OZANA.</center>  <br> All day long and every day,<br> From Christmas-Eve to Whit-Sunday,<br> Within that Chapel-aisle I lay,<br>   And no man came a-near.<br> <br> Naked to the waist was I,<br> And deep within my breast did lie,<br> Though no man any blood could spy,<br>   The truncheon of a spear.<br> <br> No meat did ever pass my lips<br> Those days.  Alas! the sunlight slips<br> From off the gilded parclose, dips,<br>   And night comes on apace.<br> <br> My arms lay back behind my head;<br> Over my raised-up knees was spread<br> A samite cloth of white and red;<br>   A rose lay on my face.<br> <br> Many a time I tried to shout;<br> But as in dream of battle-rout,<br> My frozen speech would not well out;<br>   I could not even weep.<br> <br> With inward sigh I see the sun<br> Fade off the pillars one by one,<br> My heart faints when the day is done,<br>   Because I cannot sleep.<br> <br> Sometimes strange thoughts pass through my head;<br> Not like a tomb is this my bed,<br> Yet oft I think that I am dead;<br>   That round my tomb is writ,<br> <br> "Ozana of the hardy heart,<br>   Knight of the Table Round,<br> Pray for his soul, lords, of your part;<br>   A true knight he was found."<br> <br> Ah! me, I cannot fathom it.   [<i> He sleeps</i> .<br> <br>  <center>SIR GALAHAD.</center>  <br> All day long and every day,<br> Till his madness pass'd away,<br> I watch'd Ozana as he lay<br>   Within the gilded screen.<br> <br> All my singing moved him not;<br> As I sung my heart grew hot,<br> With the thought of Launcelot<br>   Far away, I ween.<br> <br> So I went a little space<br> From out the chapel, bathed my face<br> In the stream that runs apace<br>   By the churchyard wall.<br> <br> There I pluck'd a faint wild rose,<br> Hard by where the linden grows,<br> Sighing over silver rows<br>   Of the lilies tall.<br> <br> I laid the flower across his mouth;<br> The sparkling drops seem'd good for drouth;<br> He smiled, turn'd round towards the south,<br>   Held up a golden tress.<br> <br> The light smote on it from the west;<br> He drew the covering from his breast,<br> Against his heart that hair he prest;<br>   Death him soon will bless.<br> <br>  <center>SIR BORS.</center>  <br> I enter'd by the western door;<br>   I saw a knight's helm lying there:<br> I raised my eyes from off the floor,<br>   And caught the gleaming of his hair.<br> <br> I stept full softly up to him;<br>   I laid my chin upon his head;<br> I felt him smile; my eyes did swim,<br>   I was so glad he was not dead.<br> <br> I heard Ozana murmur low,<br>   "There comes no sleep nor any love."<br> But Galahad stoop'd and kiss'd his brow:<br>   He shiver'd; I saw his pale lips move.<br> <br> <center>SIR OZANA.</center>  <br> There comes no sleep nor any love;<br>   Ah me!  I shiver with delight.<br> I am so weak I cannot move;<br>   God move me to thee, dear, to-night!<br> Christ help!  I have but little wit:<br> My life went wrong; I see it writ,<br> <br> "Ozana of the hardy heart,<br>   Knight of the Table Round,<br> Pray for his soul, lords, on your part;<br>   A good knight he was found."<br> <br> Now I begin to fathom it.     [<i> He dies</i> .<br> <br>  <center>SIR BORS.</center>  <br> Galahad sits dreamily;<br> What strange things may his eyes see,<br> Great blue eyes fix'd full on me?<br> On his soul, Lord, have mercy.<br> <br>  <center>SIR GALAHAD.</center>  <br> Ozana, shall I pray for thee?<br>   Her cheek is laid to thine;<br> No long time hence, also I see<br>   Thy wasted fingers twine<br> <br> Within the tresses of her hair<br>   That shineth gloriously,<br> Thinly outspread in the clear air<br>   Against the jasper sea.
