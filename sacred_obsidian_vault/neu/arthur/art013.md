[1]<br>  <br>  O!  in the field of Camlan fight,<br>  Ere the burning noon was o'er,<br>  The red blood ran, like a river-wave,<br>  On the dry and parched shore:<br>  <br>  King Arthur spurr'd his foaming horse<br>  Amid that living flood! [2]<br>  And twice he wav'd his witched sword<br>  Where the dauntless Modred stood!<br>  <br>  But who could stand by Arthur's side,<br>  When that steel of terror shone?<br>  When the fire of wroth was in his eye,<br>  And he rais'd his arm alone!<br>  <br>  That sun that blaz'd in middle sky,<br>  And flam'd on hill and dell;<br>  Its westering light had sunk in night,<br>  When the mighty Modred fell!<br>  <br>  But the blood that flows is Arthur's blood, [3]<br>  His fiery eye is dim!<br>  And a dew like death is on his face,<br>  And over every limb!<br>  <br>  He lean'd him down on his dragon shield,<br>  He clasp'd his beaver on!<br>  And the gushing blood it ceas'd at once,<br>  But they heard no dying groan.<br>  <br>  O! how they strove till the night came on,<br>  And all to raise that masque again!<br>  And every arm by turns had tried,<br>  But every arm was vain!<br>  <br>  They held him in their arms, and wept<br>  With tears of deep despair!<br>  Till they fear'd to touch that plate armour,<br>  For the sound was hollow there!<br>  <br>  Then they drew that witched sword,<br>  And they heard the armour ring!<br>  They wav'd it twice in Merlin's name<br>  Before they touch'd the king.<br>  <br>  At once the cross-lace open'd wide,<br>  They felt the rushing air!<br>  But that mail was hollow as the grave,<br>  Nor form, nor body there.<br>  <br>  As wild they gaz'd, the iron rings<br>  Were clasped as before!<br>  But the tongue that call'd on Merlin's name<br>  Was dumb for ever more!<br>  <br>  Mean time, the king was borne away,<br>  In deep and death-like sleep the while,<br>  To the charmed sea, by magic spell,<br>  By the Queen of the Yellow Isle!<br>  <br>  And when his tranced soul was rous'd,<br>  He thought, and thought how this might be,<br>  For there was nought but sea and sky<br>  As far as he could see.<br>  <br>  King Arthur gaz'd on the calmed surge,<br>  So clear beyond compare!<br>  But neither the form of living man,<br>  Nor the sound of life was there:<br>  <br>  The ship it mov'd on the sleeping wave<br>  Like a bird upon the air;<br>  He knew it gained on the deep,<br>  But he felt no motion there!<br>  <br>  O, then!  he had no trace of time<br>  How long he was on that pathless sea!<br>  But he could have rested there for aye,<br>  So sweet it seem'd to be!<br>  <br>  How many times he watch'd the sun,<br>  And saw it sink, he never knew;<br>  For it ne'er was more than faint twilight<br>  In that sky of stainless blue!<br>  <br>  Ah!  then he thought, within that ship<br>  He ever more was doom'd to be!<br>  And he had not once bethought him yet<br>  Of Merlin's prophecy!<br>  <br>  Those sleepless nights he watch'd alone,<br>  When the damps of midnight fell!<br>  That voice, of more than human tone,<br>  He heard in Merlin's cell; [4]<br>  <br>  That night, the eve of Camlan fight,<br>  When he felt his courage fail;<br>  When the chill of death was on his brow,<br>  Like a bloodless vision pale;<br>  <br>  That night, his knocking knees refus'd<br>  To bear him from the cave;<br>  When, press'd in his, the hand of blood<br>  Its deadly pressure gave!<br>  <br>  Clear was the sky, and O! with this<br>  What summer could compare?<br>  What woes could press on Arthur's heart,<br>  When he breath'd that blessed air?<br>  <br>  Clear was the sky!  the ship drew near<br>  Without the aid of wind or toil!<br>  And, lighted by the morning sun,<br>  He saw the charmed Isle!<br>  <br>  The ship was steady on her keel, <br>  Wash'd by that soft and lovely flood;<br>  And, blushing, on the yellow beach,<br>  The Queen of Beauty stood.<br>  <br>  High in one hand, of snowy white,<br>  A cup of sparkling pearl she bore;<br>  And she reach'd it to the tranced king<br>  As he knelt upon the shore:<br>  <br>  All pallid now was Arthur's brow,<br>  While he took the draught she gave;<br>  For he thought on what the hand of blood<br>  Had mingled in the cave:<br>  <br>  He thought on what the fiend pronounc'd, <br>  That Merlin's spirit brought;<br>  And he fix'd his eyes on that ladie's face,<br>  And trembled at the thought.<br>  <br>  Ah! in these eyes, of softest blue,<br>  What magic dwells, to lull the soul!<br>  And Arthur saw their mild reproach,<br>  And rais'd the fraughted bowl!<br>  <br>  His lips have drain'd that sparkling cup,<br>  And he turn'd on her his raptur'd eyes!<br>  When something, like a demon-smile,<br>  Betray'd the smooth disguise!<br>  <br>  He started up!  he call'd aloud!<br>  And, wild, survey'd her as she stood:<br>  When she rais'd aloof the other arm,<br>  And he knew the hand of blood!<br>  <br>  The voice, that answer'd to his call,<br>  Was that he heard within the cave!<br>  When the mighty form of Urien<br>  Was roused from the grave! [5]<br>  <br>  It told him, that the hour was come<br>  He too must slumber in the cave;<br>  When nought would reach his burial-place,<br>  But the murmurs of the wave!<br>  <br>  It told him of the years to pass<br>  Before his kingdom he could see:<br>  And Arthur knew he would return,<br>  From Merlin's prophecy. [6]<br>  <br>  King Arthur's body was not found,<br>  Nor ever laid in holy grave:<br>  And nought has reach'd his burial-place,<br>  But the murmurs of the wave.<br>   <br>  <hr>  <center><h3 align="CENTER">THE PROPHECY OF MERLIN: FOOTNOTES</h3> </center> <br>   <a> <b> 1</b>   Arthur's shield had on it the picture of our Lady, and his helm, an engraven dragon.<br>  -----SELDEN'S Notes to the Poly.

His death was politically concelaed, lest it should dispirit the Britons.  Hence arose so many fabulous stories about it.<br>  -----EVANS'S Specimens of Welsh Poetry<br>  <br>  </a><a> <b> 4</b>   <blockquote>  There the wise Merlin, whilome he wont, (they say,)<br>  To make his wonne, low underneathe the ground<br>  In a deep delve, farre from the vew of day<br>  That of no living wight he mote be found,<br>  When so he counseld, with his sprights encompast round:<br>  And if thou ever happen that same way<br>  To traveill, go to see that dreadful place:<br>  It is an hideous hollow cave, (they say,)<br>  Under a rock<br>  -----SPENSER'S Faery Queene.

Olb. Song III.</blockquote>   It will not perhaps be very consonant to popular feeling, that legendary tradition has been violated in the fate and disposal of this great, national hero.  But it is all fairy-ground, and a poetical community of right to its appropriation has never been disputed.<br>  <br>  <center>FINIS.</center>  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
