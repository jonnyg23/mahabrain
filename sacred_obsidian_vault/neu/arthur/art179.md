Thus he spoke:<br>  And eight years past, eight jousts had been, and still<br>  Had Lancelot won the diamond of the year,<br>  With purpose to present them to the Queen,<br>  When all were won; but meaning all at once<br>  To snare her royal fancy with a boon<br>  Worth half her realm, had never spoken word.<br>  <br>     Now for the central diamond and the last<br>  And largest, Arthur, holding then his court<br>  Hard on the river nigh the place which now<br>  Is this world's hugest, let proclaim a joust<br>  At Camelot, and when the time drew nigh<br>  Spake (for she had been sick) to Guinevere,<br>  "Are you so sick, my Queen, you cannot move<br>  To these fair jousts?"  "Yea, lord," she said, "ye know it."<br>  "Then will ye miss," he answered, "the great deeds<br>  Of Lancelot, and his prowess in the lists,<br>  A sight ye love to look on." And the Queen<br>  Lifted her eyes, and they dwelt languidly<br>  On Lancelot, where he stood beside the King.<br>  He thinking that he read her meaning there,<br>  "Stay with me, I am sick; my love is more<br>  Than many diamonds," yielded; and a heart<br>  Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen<br>  (However much he yearned to make complete<br>  The tale of diamonds for his destined boon)<br>  Urged him to speak against the truth, and say,<br>  "Sir King, mine ancient wound is hardly whole,<br>  And lets me from the saddle;" and the King<br>  Glanced first at him, then her, and went his way.<br>  No sooner gone than suddenly she began:<br>  <br>     "To blame, my lord Sir Lancelot, much to blame!<br>  Why go ye not to these fair jousts? the knights<br>  Are half of them our enemies, and the crowd<br>  Will murmur, 'Lo the shameless ones, who take<br>  Their pastime now the trustful King is gone!' "<br>  Then Lancelot vext at having lied in vain:<br>  "Are ye so wise? ye were not once so wise,<br>  My Queen, that summer, when ye loved me first.<br>  Then of the crowd ye took no more account<br>  Than of the myriad cricket of the mead,<br>  When its own voice clings to each blade of grass,<br>  And every voice is nothing. As to knights,<br>  Them surely can I silence with all ease.<br>  But now my loyal worship is allowed<br>  Of all men: many a bard, without offence,<br>  Has linked our names together in his lay,<br>  Lancelot, the flower of bravery, Guinevere,<br>  The pearl of beauty: and our knights at feast<br>  Have pledged us in this union, while the King<br>  Would listen smiling. How then? is there more?<br>  Has Arthur spoken aught? or would yourself,<br>  Now weary of my service and devoir,<br>  Henceforth be truer to your faultless lord?"<br>  <br>     She broke into a little scornful laugh:<br>  "Arthur, my lord, Arthur, the faultless King,<br>  That passionate perfection, my good lord--<br>  But who can gaze upon the Sun in heaven?<br>  He never spake word of reproach to me,<br>  He never had a glimpse of mine untruth,<br>  He cares not for me: only here today<br>  There gleamed a vague suspicion in his eyes:<br>  Some meddling rogue has tampered with him--else<br>  Rapt in this fancy of his Table Round,<br>  And swearing men to vows impossible,<br>  To make them like himself: but, friend, to me<br>  He is all fault who hath no fault at all:<br>  For who loves me must have a touch of earth;<br>  The low sun makes the colour: I am yours,<br>  Not Arthur's, as ye know, save by the bond.<br>  And therefore hear my words: go to the jousts:<br>  The tiny-trumpeting gnat can break our dream<br>  When sweetest; and the vermin voices here<br>  May buzz so loud--we scorn them, but they sting."<br>  <br>     Then answered Lancelot, the chief of knights:<br>  "And with what face, after my pretext made,<br>  Shall I appear, O Queen, at Camelot, I<br>  Before a King who honours his own word,<br>  As if it were his God's?"<br>  <br>                            "Yea," said the Queen,<br>  "A moral child without the craft to rule,<br>  Else had he not lost me: but listen to me,<br>  If I must find you wit: we hear it said<br>  That men go down before your spear at a touch,<br>  But knowing you are Lancelot; your great name,<br>  This conquers: hide it therefore; go unknown:<br>  Win! by this kiss you will: and our true King<br>  Will then allow your pretext, O my knight,<br>  As all for glory; for to speak him true,<br>  Ye know right well, how meek soe'er he seem,<br>  No keener hunter after glory breathes.<br>  He loves it in his knights more than himself:<br>  They prove to him his work: win and return."<br>  <br>     Then got Sir Lancelot suddenly to horse,<br>  Wroth at himself. Not willing to be known,<br>  He left the barren-beaten thoroughfare,<br>  Chose the green path that showed the rarer foot,<br>  And there among the solitary downs,<br>  Full often lost in fancy, lost his way;<br>  Till as he traced a faintly-shadowed track,<br>  That all in loops and links among the dales<br>  Ran to the Castle of Astolat, he saw<br>  Fired from the west, far on a hill, the towers.<br>  Thither he made, and blew the gateway horn.<br>  Then came an old, dumb, myriad-wrinkled man,<br>  Who let him into lodging and disarmed.<br>  And Lancelot marvelled at the wordless man;<br>  And issuing found the Lord of Astolat<br>  With two strong sons, Sir Torre and Sir Lavaine,<br>  Moving to meet him in the castle court;<br>  And close behind them stept the lily maid<br>  Elaine, his daughter: mother of the house<br>  There was not: some light jest among them rose<br>  With laughter dying down as the great knight<br>  Approached them: then the Lord of Astolat:<br>  "Whence comest thou, my guest, and by what name<br>  Livest between the lips? for by thy state<br>  And presence I might guess thee chief of those,<br>  After the King, who eat in Arthur's halls.<br>  Him have I seen: the rest, his Table Round,<br>  Known as they are, to me they are unknown."<br>  <br>     Then answered Lancelot, the chief of knights:<br>  "Known am I, and of Arthur's hall, and known,<br>  What I by mere mischance have brought, my shield.<br>  But since I go to joust as one unknown<br>  At Camelot for the diamond, ask me not,<br>  Hereafter ye shall know me--and the shield--<br>  I pray you lend me one, if such you have,<br>  Blank, or at least with some device not mine."<br>  <br>     Then said the Lord of Astolat, "Here is Torre's:<br>  Hurt in his first tilt was my son, Sir Torre.<br>  And so, God wot, his shield is blank enough.<br>  His ye can have." Then added plain Sir Torre,<br>  "Yea, since I cannot use it, ye may have it."<br>  Here laughed the father saying, "Fie, Sir Churl,<br>  Is that an answer for a noble knight?<br>  Allow him! but Lavaine, my younger here,<br>  He is so full of lustihood, he will ride,<br>  Joust for it, and win, and bring it in an hour,<br>  And set it in this damsel's golden hair,<br>  To make her thrice as wilful as before."<br>  <br>     "Nay, father, nay good father, shame me not<br>  Before this noble knight," said young Lavaine,<br>  "For nothing. Surely I but played on Torre:<br>  He seemed so sullen, vext he could not go:<br>  A jest, no more! for, knight, the maiden dreamt<br>  That some one put this diamond in her hand,<br>  And that it was too slippery to be held,<br>  And slipt and fell into some pool or stream,<br>  The castle-well, belike; and then I said<br>  That <i> if</i>  I went and <i> if</i>  I fought and won it<br>  (But all was jest and joke among ourselves)<br>  Then must she keep it safelier. All was jest.<br>  But, father, give me leave, an if he will,<br>  To ride to Camelot with this noble knight:<br>  Win shall I not, but do my best to win:<br>  Young as I am, yet would I do my best."<br>  <br>     "So ye will grace me," answered Lancelot,<br>  Smiling a moment, "with your fellowship<br>  O'er these waste downs whereon I lost myself,<br>  Then were I glad of you as guide and friend:<br>  And you shall win this diamond,--as I hear<br>  It is a fair large diamond,--if ye may,<br>  And yield it to this maiden, if ye will."<br>  "A fair large diamond," added plain Sir Torre,<br>  "Such be for queens, and not for simple maids."<br>  Then she, who held her eyes upon the ground,<br>  Elaine, and heard her name so tost about,<br>  Flushed slightly at the slight disparagement<br>  Before the stranger knight, who, looking at her,<br>  Full courtly, yet not falsely, thus returned:<br>  "If what is fair be but for what is fair,<br>  And only queens are to be counted so,<br>  Rash were my judgment then, who deem this maid<br>  Might wear as fair a jewel as is on earth,<br>  Not violating the bond of like to like."<br>  <br>     He spoke and ceased: the lily maid Elaine,<br>  Won by the mellow voice before she looked,<br>  Lifted her eyes, and read his lineaments.<br>  The great and guilty love he bare the Queen,<br>  In battle with the love he bare his lord,<br>  Had marred his face, and marked it ere his time.<br>  Another sinning on such heights with one,<br>  The flower of all the west and all the world,<br>  Had been the sleeker for it: but in him<br>  His mood was often like a fiend, and rose<br>  And drove him into wastes and solitudes<br>  For agony, who was yet a living soul.<br>  Marred as he was, he seemed the goodliest man<br>  That ever among ladies ate in hall,<br>  And noblest, when she lifted up her eyes.<br>  However marred, of more than twice her years,<br>  Seamed with an ancient swordcut on the cheek,<br>  And bruised and bronzed, she lifted up her eyes<br>  And loved him, with that love which was her doom.<br>  <br>     Then the great knight, the darling of the court,<br>  Loved of the loveliest, into that rude hall<br>  Stept with all grace, and not with half disdain<br>  Hid under grace, as in a smaller time,<br>  But kindly man moving among his kind:<br>  Whom they with meats and vintage of their best<br>  And talk and minstrel melody entertained.<br>  And much they asked of court and Table Round,<br>  And ever well and readily answered he:<br>  But Lancelot, when they glanced at Guinevere,<br>  Suddenly speaking of the wordless man,<br>  Heard from the Baron that, ten years before,<br>  The heathen caught and reft him of his tongue.<br>  "He learnt and warned me of their fierce design<br>  Against my house, and him they caught and maimed;<br>  But I, my sons, and little daughter fled<br>  From bonds or death, and dwelt among the woods<br>  By the great river in a boatman's hut.<br>  Dull days were those, till our good Arthur broke<br>  The Pagan yet once more on Badon hill."<br>  <br>     "O there, great lord, doubtless," Lavaine said, rapt<br>  By all the sweet and sudden passion of youth<br>  Toward greatness in its elder, "you have fought.<br>  O tell us--for we live apart--you know<br>  Of Arthur's glorious wars." And Lancelot spoke<br>  And answered him at full, as having been<br>  With Arthur in the fight which all day long<br>  Rang by the white mouth of the violent Glem;<br>  And in the four loud battles by the shore<br>  Of Duglas; that on Bassa; then the war<br>  That thundered in and out the gloomy skirts<br>  Of Celidon the forest; and again<br>  By castle Gurnion, where the glorious King<br>  Had on his cuirass worn our Lady's Head,<br>  Carved of one emerald centered in a sun<br>  Of silver rays, that lightened as he breathed;<br>  And at Caerleon had he helped his lord,<br>  When the strong neighings of the wild white Horse<br>  Set every gilded parapet shuddering;<br>  And up in Agned-Cathregonion too,<br>  And down the waste sand-shores of Trath Treroit,<br>  </a><a> Where many a heathen fell; "and on the mount <br>  Of Badon I myself beheld the King<br>  Charge at the head of all his Table Round, <br>  And all his legions crying Christ and him,<br>  </a><a> And break them; and I saw him, after, stand <br>  High on a heap of slain, from spur to plume<br>  Red as the rising sun with heathen blood, <br>  And seeing me, with a great voice he cried,<br>  'They are broken, they are broken!' for the King,<br>  However mild he seems at home, nor cares<br>  For triumph in our mimic wars, the jousts--<br>  For if his own knight cast him down, he laughs<br>  Saying, his knights are better men than he--<br>  Yet in this heathen war the fire of God<br>  Fills him: I never saw his like: there lives<br>  No greater leader."<br>  <br>                         While he uttered this,<br>  Low to her own heart said the lily maid,<br>  "Save your great self, fair lord;" and when he fell<br>  From talk of war to traits of pleasantry--<br>  Being mirthful he, but in a stately kind--<br>  She still took note that when the living smile<br>  Died from his lips, across him came a cloud<br>  Of melancholy severe, from which again,<br>  Whenever in her hovering to and fro<br>  The lily maid had striven to make him cheer,<br>  There brake a sudden-beaming tenderness<br>  Of manners and of nature: and she thought<br>  That all was nature, all, perchance, for her.<br>  And all night long his face before her lived,<br>  As when a painter, poring on a face,<br>  Divinely through all hindrance finds the man<br>  Behind it, and so paints him that his face,<br>  The shape and colour of a mind and life,<br>  Lives for his children, ever at its best<br>  And fullest; so the face before her lived,<br>  Dark-splendid, speaking in the silence, full<br>  Of noble things, and held her from her sleep.<br>  Till rathe she rose, half-cheated in the thought<br>  She needs must bid farewell to sweet Lavaine.<br>  First as in fear, step after step, she stole<br>  Down the long tower-stairs, hesitating:<br>  Anon, she heard Sir Lancelot cry in the court,<br>  "This shield, my friend, where is it?" and Lavaine<br>  Past inward, as she came from out the tower.<br>  There to his proud horse Lancelot turned, and smoothed<br>  The glossy shoulder, humming to himself.<br>  Half-envious of the flattering hand, she drew<br>  Nearer and stood. He looked, and more amazed<br>  Than if seven men had set upon him, saw<br>  The maiden standing in the dewy light.<br>  He had not dreamed she was so beautiful.<br>  Then came on him a sort of sacred fear,<br>  </a><a> For silent, though he greeted her, she stood <br>  Rapt on his face as if it were a God's. <br>  Suddenly flashed on her a wild desire,<br>  That he should wear her favour at the tilt.<br>  She braved a riotous heart in asking for it.<br>  "Fair lord, whose name I know not--noble it is,<br>  I well believe, the noblest--will you wear<br>  My favour at this tourney?" "Nay," said he,<br>  "Fair lady, since I never yet have worn<br>  Favour of any lady in the lists.<br>  Such is my wont, as those, who know me, know."<br>  "Yea, so," she answered; "then in wearing mine<br>  Needs must be lesser likelihood, noble lord,<br>  That those who know should know you." And he turned<br>  Her counsel up and down within his mind,<br>  And found it true, and answered, "True, my child.<br>  Well, I will wear it: fetch it out to me:<br>  What is it?" and she told him "A red sleeve<br>  Broidered with pearls," and brought it: then he bound<br>  Her token on his helmet, with a smile<br>  Saying, "I never yet have done so much<br>  For any maiden living," and the blood<br>  Sprang to her face and filled her with delight;<br>  But left her all the paler, when Lavaine<br>  Returning brought the yet-unblazoned shield,<br>  His brother's; which he gave to Lancelot,<br>  Who parted with his own to fair Elaine:<br>  "Do me this grace, my child, to have my shield<br>  In keeping till I come." "A grace to me,"<br>  She answered, "twice today. I am your squire!"<br>  Whereat Lavaine said, laughing, "Lily maid,<br>  For fear our people call you lily maid<br>  In earnest, let me bring your colour back;<br>  Once, twice, and thrice: now get you hence to bed:"<br>  So kissed her, and Sir Lancelot his own hand,<br>  And thus they moved away: she stayed a minute,<br>  Then made a sudden step to the gate, and there--<br>  Her bright hair blown about the serious face<br>  Yet rosy-kindled with her brother's kiss--<br>  Paused by the gateway, standing near the shield<br>  In silence, while she watched their arms far-off<br>  Sparkle, until they dipt below the downs.<br>  </a><a> Then to her tower she climbed, and took the shield, <br>  There kept it, and so lived in fantasy.<br>  <br>     Meanwhile the new companions past away<br>  Far o'er the long backs of the bushless downs,<br>  To where Sir Lancelot knew there lived a knight<br>  Not far from Camelot, now for forty years<br>  A hermit, who had prayed, laboured and prayed,<br>  And ever labouring had scooped himself<br>  In the white rock a chapel and a hall<br>  On massive columns, like a shorecliff cave,<br>  And cells and chambers: all were fair and dry;<br>  The green light from the meadows underneath<br>  Struck up and lived along the milky roofs;<br>  And in the meadows tremulous aspen-trees<br>  And poplars made a noise of falling showers.<br>  And thither wending there that night they bode.<br>  <br>     But when the next day broke from underground,<br>  And shot red fire and shadows through the cave,<br>  They rose, heard mass, broke fast, and rode away:<br>  Then Lancelot saying, "Hear, but hold my name<br>  Hidden, you ride with Lancelot of the Lake,"<br>  Abashed Lavaine, whose instant reverence,<br>  Dearer to true young hearts than their own praise,<br>  But left him leave to stammer, "Is it indeed?"<br>  And after muttering "The great Lancelot,"<br>  At last he got his breath and answered, "One,<br>  One have I seen--that other, our liege lord,<br>  The dread Pendragon, Britain's King of kings,<br>  Of whom the people talk mysteriously,<br>  He will be there--then were I stricken blind<br>  That minute, I might say that I had seen."<br>  <br>     So spake Lavaine, and when they reached the lists<br>  By Camelot in the meadow, let his eyes<br>  Run through the peopled gallery which half round<br>  Lay like a rainbow fallen upon the grass,<br>  Until they found the clear-faced King, who sat<br>  Robed in red samite, easily to be known,<br>  Since to his crown the golden dragon clung,<br>  And down his robe the dragon writhed in gold,<br>  And from the carven-work behind him crept<br>  Two dragons gilded, sloping down to make<br>  Arms for his chair, while all the rest of them<br>  Through knots and loops and folds innumerable<br>  Fled ever through the woodwork, till they found<br>  The new design wherein they lost themselves,<br>  Yet with all ease, so tender was the work:<br>  And, in the costly canopy o'er him set,<br>  Blazed the last diamond of the nameless king.<br>  <br>     Then Lancelot answered young Lavaine and said,<br>  "Me you call great: mine is the firmer seat,<br>  The truer lance: but there is many a youth<br>  Now crescent, who will come to all I am<br>  And overcome it; and in me there dwells<br>  No greatness, save it be some far-off touch<br>  Of greatness to know well I am not great:<br>  There is the man." And Lavaine gaped upon him<br>  As on a thing miraculous, and anon<br>  The trumpets blew; and then did either side,<br>  They that assailed, and they that held the lists,<br>  Set lance in rest, strike spur, suddenly move,<br>  Meet in the midst, and there so furiously<br>  Shock, that a man far-off might well perceive,<br>  If any man that day were left afield,<br>  The hard earth shake, and a low thunder of arms.<br>  </a><a> And Lancelot bode a little, till he saw <br>  Which were the weaker; then he hurled into it<br>  Against the stronger: little need to speak<br>  Of Lancelot in his glory!  King, duke, earl,<br>  Count, baron--whom he smote, he overthrew.<br>  <br>     But in the field were Lancelot's kith and kin,<br>  Ranged with the Table Round that held the lists,<br>  Strong men, and wrathful that a stranger knight<br>  Should do and almost overdo the deeds<br>  Of Lancelot; and one said to the other, "Lo!<br>  What is he? I do not mean the force alone--<br>  The grace and versatility of the man!<br>  Is it not Lancelot?" "When has Lancelot worn<br>  Favour of any lady in the lists?<br>  Not such his wont, as we, that know him, know."<br>  "How then? who then?" a fury seized them all,<br>  A fiery family passion for the name<br>  Of Lancelot, and a glory one with theirs.<br>  They couched their spears and pricked their steeds, and thus,<br>  Their plumes driven backward by the wind they made<br>  In moving, all together down upon him<br>  Bare, as a wild wave in the wide North-sea,<br>  Green-glimmering toward the summit, bears, with all<br>  Its stormy crests that smoke against the skies,<br>  Down on a bark, and overbears the bark,<br>  And him that helms it, so they overbore<br>  Sir Lancelot and his charger, and a spear<br>  Down-glancing lamed the charger, and a spear<br>  Pricked sharply his own cuirass, and the head<br>  Pierced through his side, and there snapt, and remained.<br>  <br>     Then Sir Lavaine did well and worshipfully;<br>  He bore a knight of old repute to the earth,<br>  And brought his horse to Lancelot where he lay.<br>  He up the side, sweating with agony, got,<br>  But thought to do while he might yet endure,<br>  And being lustily holpen by the rest,<br>  His party--though it seemed half-miracle<br>  To those he fought with,--drave his kith and kin,<br>  And all the Table Round that held the lists,<br>  Back to the barrier; then the trumpets blew<br>  Proclaiming his the prize, who wore the sleeve<br>  Of scarlet, and the pearls; and all the knights,<br>  His party, cried "Advance and take thy prize<br>  The diamond;" but he answered, "Diamond me<br>  No diamonds! for God's love, a little air!<br>  Prize me no prizes, for my prize is death!<br>  Hence will I, and I charge you, follow me not."<br>  <br>     He spoke, and vanished suddenly from the field<br>  With young Lavaine into the poplar grove.<br>  There from his charger down he slid, and sat,<br>  Gasping to Sir Lavaine, "Draw the lance-head:"<br>  "Ah my sweet lord Sir Lancelot," said Lavaine,<br>  "I dread me, if I draw it, you will die."<br>  But he, "I die already with it: draw--<br>  Draw,"--and Lavaine drew, and Sir Lancelot gave<br>  A marvellous great shriek and ghastly groan,<br>  And half his blood burst forth, and down he sank<br>  For the pure pain, and wholly swooned away.<br>  Then came the hermit out and bare him in,<br>  There stanched his wound; and there, in daily doubt<br>  Whether to live or die, for many a week<br>  Hid from the wide world's rumour by the grove<br>  Of poplars with their noise of falling showers,<br>  And ever-tremulous aspen-trees, he lay.<br>  <br>     But on that day when Lancelot fled the lists,<br>  His party, knights of utmost North and West,<br>  Lords of waste marches, kings of desolate isles,<br>  Came round their great Pendragon, saying to him,<br>  "Lo, Sire, our knight, through whom we won the day,<br>  Hath gone sore wounded, and hath left his prize<br>  Untaken, crying that his prize is death."<br>  "Heaven hinder," said the King, "that such an one,<br>  So great a knight as we have seen today--<br>  He seemed to me another Lancelot--<br>  Yea, twenty times I thought him Lancelot--<br>  He must not pass uncared for. Wherefore, rise,<br>  O Gawain, and ride forth and find the knight.<br>  Wounded and wearied needs must he be near.<br>  I charge you that you get at once to horse.<br>  And, knights and kings, there breathes not one of you<br>  Will deem this prize of ours is rashly given:<br>  His prowess was too wondrous. We will do him<br>  No customary honour: since the knight<br>  Came not to us, of us to claim the prize,<br>  Ourselves will send it after. Rise and take<br>  This diamond, and deliver it, and return,<br>  And bring us where he is, and how he fares,<br>  And cease not from your quest until ye find."<br>  <br>     So saying, from the carven flower above,<br>  To which it made a restless heart, he took,<br>  And gave, the diamond: then from where he sat<br>  At Arthur's right, with smiling face arose,<br>  With smiling face and frowning heart, a Prince<br>  In the mid might and flourish of his May,<br>  Gawain, surnamed The Courteous, fair and strong,<br>  And after Lancelot, Tristram, and Geraint<br>  And Gareth, a good knight, but therewithal<br>  Sir Modred's brother, and the child of Lot,<br>  Nor often loyal to his word, and now<br>  Wroth that the King's command to sally forth<br>  In quest of whom he knew not, made him leave<br>  The banquet, and concourse of knights and kings.<br>  <br>     So all in wrath he got to horse and went;<br>  While Arthur to the banquet, dark in mood,<br>  Past, thinking "Is it Lancelot who hath come<br>  Despite the wound he spake of, all for gain<br>  Of glory, and hath added wound to wound,<br>  And ridden away to die?" So feared the King,<br>  And, after two days' tarriance there, returned.<br>  Then when he saw the Queen, embracing asked,<br>  "Love, are you yet so sick?" "Nay, lord," she said.<br>  "And where is Lancelot?" Then the Queen amazed,<br>  "Was he not with you? won he not your prize?"<br>  "Nay, but one like him." "Why that like was he."<br>  And when the King demanded how she knew,<br>  Said, "Lord, no sooner had ye parted from us,<br>  Than Lancelot told me of a common talk<br>  That men went down before his spear at a touch,<br>  But knowing he was Lancelot; his great name<br>  Conquered; and therefore would he hide his name<br>  From all men, even the King, and to this end<br>  Had made the pretext of a hindering wound,<br>  That he might joust unknown of all, and learn<br>  If his old prowess were in aught decayed;<br>  And added, 'Our true Arthur, when he learns,<br>  Will well allow my pretext, as for gain<br>  Of purer glory.' "<br>  <br>                         Then replied the King:<br>  "Far lovelier in our Lancelot had it been,<br>  In lieu of idly dallying with the truth,<br>  To have trusted me as he hath trusted thee.<br>  Surely his King and most familiar friend<br>  Might well have kept his secret. True, indeed,<br>  Albeit I know my knights fantastical,<br>  So fine a fear in our large Lancelot<br>  Must needs have moved my laughter: now remains<br>  But little cause for laughter: his own kin--<br>  Ill news, my Queen, for all who love him, this!--<br>  His kith and kin, not knowing, set upon him;<br>  So that he went sore wounded from the field:<br>  Yet good news too: for goodly hopes are mine<br>  That Lancelot is no more a lonely heart.<br>  He wore, against his wont, upon his helm<br>  A sleeve of scarlet, broidered with great pearls,<br>  Some gentle maiden's gift."<br>  <br>                                 "Yea, lord," she said,<br>  "Thy hopes are mine," and saying that, she choked,<br>  And sharply turned about to hide her face,<br>  Past to her chamber, and there flung herself<br>  Down on the great King's couch, and writhed upon it,<br>  And clenched her fingers till they bit the palm,<br>  And shrieked out "Traitor" to the unhearing wall,<br>  Then flashed into wild tears, and rose again,<br>  And moved about her palace, proud and pale.<br>  <br>     Gawain the while through all the region round<br>  Rode with his diamond, wearied of the quest,<br>  Touched at all points, except the poplar grove,<br>  And came at last, though late, to Astolat:<br>  Whom glittering in enamelled arms the maid<br>  Glanced at, and cried, "What news from Camelot, lord?<br>  What of the knight with the red sleeve?" "He won."<br>  "I knew it," she said. "But parted from the jousts<br>  Hurt in the side," whereat she caught her breath;<br>  Through her own side she felt the sharp lance go;<br>  Thereon she smote her hand: wellnigh she swooned:<br>  And, while he gazed wonderingly at her, came<br>  The Lord of Astolat out, to whom the Prince<br>  Reported who he was, and on what quest<br>  Sent, that he bore the prize and could not find<br>  The victor, but had ridden a random round<br>  To seek him, and had wearied of the search.<br>  To whom the Lord of Astolat, "Bide with us,<br>  And ride no more at random, noble Prince!<br>  Here was the knight, and here he left a shield;<br>  This will he send or come for: furthermore<br>  Our son is with him; we shall hear anon,<br>  Needs must we hear." To this the courteous Prince<br>  Accorded with his wonted courtesy,<br>  Courtesy with a touch of traitor in it,<br>  And stayed; and cast his eyes on fair Elaine:<br>  Where could be found face daintier? then her shape<br>  From forehead down to foot, perfect--again<br>  From foot to forehead exquisitely turned:<br>  "Well--if I bide, lo! this wild flower for me!"<br>  And oft they met among the garden yews,<br>  And there he set himself to play upon her<br>  With sallying wit, free flashes from a height<br>  Above her, graces of the court, and songs,<br>  Sighs, and slow smiles, and golden eloquence<br>  And amorous adulation, till the maid<br>  Rebelled against it, saying to him, "Prince,<br>  O loyal nephew of our noble King,<br>  Why ask you not to see the shield he left,<br>  Whence you might learn his name? Why slight your King,<br>  And lose the quest he sent you on, and prove<br>  No surer than our falcon yesterday,<br>  Who lost the hern we slipt her at, and went<br>  To all the winds?" "Nay, by mine head," said he,<br>  "I lose it, as we lose the lark in heaven,<br>  O damsel, in the light of your blue eyes;<br>  But an ye will it let me see the shield."<br>  And when the shield was brought, and Gawain saw<br>  Sir Lancelot's azure lions, crowned with gold,<br>  Ramp in the field, he smote his thigh, and mocked<br>  "Right was the King! our Lancelot! that true man!"<br>  "And right was I," she answerd merrily, "I,<br>  Who dreamed my knight the greatest knight of all."<br>  "And if <i> I</i>  dreamed," said Gawain, "that you love<br>  This greatest knight, your pardon! lo, ye know it!<br>  Speak therefore: shall I waste myself in vain?"<br>  Full simple was her answer, "What know I?<br>  My brethren have been all my fellowship;<br>  And I, when often they have talked of love,<br>  Wished it had been my mother, for they talked,<br>  Meseemed, of what they knew not; so myself--<br>  I know not if I know what true love is,<br>  But if I know, then, if I love not him,<br>  I know there is none other I can love."<br>  "Yea, by God's death," said he, "ye love him well,<br>  But would not, knew ye what all others know,<br>  And whom he loves." "So be it," cried Elaine,<br>  And lifted her fair face and moved away:<br>  But he pursued her, calling, "Stay a little!<br>  One golden minute's grace! he wore your sleeve:<br>  Would he break faith with one I may not name?<br>  Must our true man change like a leaf at last?<br>  Nay--like enow: why then, far be it from me<br>  To cross our mighty Lancelot in his loves!<br>  And, damsel, for I deem you know full well<br>  Where your great knight is hidden, let me leave<br>  My quest with you; the diamond also: here!<br>  For if you love, it will be sweet to give it;<br>  And if he love, it will be sweet to have it<br>  From your own hand; and whether he love or not,<br>  A diamond is a diamond. Fare you well<br>  A thousand times!--a thousand times farewell!<br>  Yet, if he love, and his love hold, we two<br>  May meet at court hereafter: there, I think,<br>  So ye will learn the courtesies of the court,<br>  We two shall know each other."<br>  <br>                                      Then he gave,<br>  And slightly kissed the hand to which he gave,<br>  The diamond, and all wearied of the quest<br>  Leapt on his horse, and carolling as he went<br>  A true-love ballad, lightly rode away.<br>  <br>     Thence to the court he past; there told the King<br>  What the King knew, "Sir Lancelot is the knight."<br>  And added, "Sire, my liege, so much I learnt;<br>  But failed to find him, tho' I rode all round<br>  The region: but I lighted on the maid<br>  Whose sleeve he wore; she loves him; and to her,<br>  Deeming our courtesy is the truest law,<br>  I gave the diamond: she will render it;<br>  For by mine head she knows his hiding-place."<br>  <br>     The seldom-frowning King frowned, and replied,<br>  "Too courteous truly! ye shall go no more<br>  On quest of mine, seeing that ye forget<br>  Obedience is the courtesy due to kings."<br>  <br>     He spake and parted. Wroth, but all in awe,<br>  For twenty strokes of the blood, without a word,<br>  Lingered that other, staring after him;<br>  Then shook his hair, strode off, and buzzed abroad<br>  About the maid of Astolat, and her love.<br>  All ears were pricked at once, all tongues were loosed:<br>  "The maid of Astolat loves Sir Lancelot,<br>  Sir Lancelot loves the maid of Astolat."<br>  Some read the King's face, some the Queen's, and all<br>  Had marvel what the maid might be, but most<br>  Predoomed her as unworthy. One old dame<br>  Came suddenly on the Queen with the sharp news.<br>  She, that had heard the noise of it before,<br>  But sorrowing Lancelot should have stooped so low,<br>  Marred her friend's aim with pale tranquillity.<br>  So ran the tale like fire about the court,<br>  Fire in dry stubble a nine-days' wonder flared:<br>  Till even the knights at banquet twice or thrice<br>  Forgot to drink to Lancelot and the Queen,<br>  And pledging Lancelot and the lily maid<br>  Smiled at each other, while the Queen, who sat<br>  With lips severely placid, felt the knot<br>  Climb in her throat, and with her feet unseen<br>  Crushed the wild passion out against the floor<br>  Beneath the banquet, where the meats became<br>  As wormwood, and she hated all who pledged.<br>  <br>     But far away the maid in Astolat,<br>  Her guiltless rival, she that ever kept<br>  The one-day-seen Sir Lancelot in her heart,<br>  Crept to her father, while he mused alone,<br>  Sat on his knee, stroked his gray face and said,<br>  "Father, you call me wilful, and the fault<br>  Is yours who let me have my will, and now,<br>  Sweet father, will you let me lose my wits?"<br>  "Nay," said he, "surely." "Wherefore, let me hence,"<br>  She answered, "and find out our dear Lavaine."<br>  "Ye will not lose your wits for dear Lavaine:<br>  Bide," answered he: "we needs must hear anon<br>  Of him, and of that other." "Ay," she said,<br>  "And of that other, for I needs must hence<br>  And find that other, wheresoe'er he be,<br>  And with mine own hand give his diamond to him,<br>  Lest I be found as faithless in the quest<br>  As yon proud Prince who left the quest to me.<br>  Sweet father, I behold him in my dreams<br>  Gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself,<br>  Death-pale, for lack of gentle maiden's aid.<br>  The gentler-born the maiden, the more bound,<br>  My father, to be sweet and serviceable<br>  To noble knights in sickness, as ye know<br>  When these have worn their tokens: let me hence<br>  I pray you." Then her father nodding said,<br>  "Ay, ay, the diamond: wit ye well, my child,<br>  Right fain were I to learn this knight were whole,<br>  Being our greatest: yea, and you must give it--<br>  And sure I think this fruit is hung too high<br>  For any mouth to gape for save a queen's--<br>  Nay, I mean nothing: so then, get you gone,<br>  Being so very wilful you must go."<br>  <br>     Lightly, her suit allowed, she slipt away,<br>  And while she made her ready for her ride,<br>  Her father's latest word hummed in her ear,<br>  "Being so very wilful you must go,"<br>  And changed itself and echoed in her heart,<br>  "Being so very wilful you must die."<br>  But she was happy enough and shook it off,<br>  As we shake off the bee that buzzes at us;<br>  And in her heart she answered it and said,<br>  "What matter, so I help him back to life?"<br>  Then far away with good Sir Torre for guide<br>  Rode o'er the long backs of the bushless downs<br>  To Camelot, and before the city-gates<br>  Came on her brother with a happy face<br>  Making a roan horse caper and curvet<br>  For pleasure all about a field of flowers:<br>  Whom when she saw, "Lavaine," she cried, "Lavaine,<br>  How fares my lord Sir Lancelot?" He amazed,<br>  "Torre and Elaine! why here? Sir Lancelot!<br>  How know ye my lord's name is Lancelot?"<br>  But when the maid had told him all her tale,<br>  Then turned Sir Torre, and being in his moods<br>  Left them, and under the strange-statued gate,<br>  Where Arthur's wars were rendered mystically,<br>  Past up the still rich city to his kin,<br>  His own far blood, which dwelt at Camelot;<br>  And her, Lavaine across the poplar grove<br>  Led to the caves: there first she saw the casque<br>  Of Lancelot on the wall: her scarlet sleeve,<br>  Though carved and cut, and half the pearls away,<br>  Streamed from it still; and in her heart she laughed,<br>  Because he had not loosed it from his helm,<br>  But meant once more perchance to tourney in it.<br>  And when they gained the cell wherein he slept,<br>  His battle-writhen arms and mighty hands<br>  Lay naked on the wolfskin, and a dream<br>  Of dragging down his enemy made them move.<br>  Then she that saw him lying unsleek, unshorn,<br>  Gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself,<br>  Uttered a little tender dolorous cry.<br>  The sound not wonted in a place so still<br>  Woke the sick knight, and while he rolled his eyes<br>  Yet blank from sleep, she started to him, saying,<br>  "Your prize the diamond sent you by the King:"<br>  His eyes glistened: she fancied "Is it for me?"<br>  And when the maid had told him all the tale<br>  Of King and Prince, the diamond sent, the quest<br>  Assigned to her not worthy of it, she knelt<br>  Full lowly by the corners of his bed,<br>  And laid the diamond in his open hand.<br>  </a><a> Her face was near, and as we kiss the child <br>  That does the task assigned, he kissed her face.<br>  At once she slipt like water to the floor.<br>  "Alas," he said, "your ride hath wearied you.<br>  Rest must you have." "No rest for me," she said;<br>  "Nay, for near you, fair lord, I am at rest."<br>  What might she mean by that? his large black eyes,<br>  Yet larger through his leanness, dwelt upon her,<br>  Till all her heart's sad secret blazed itself<br>  In the heart's colours on her simple face;<br>  And Lancelot looked and was perplext in mind,<br>  And being weak in body said no more;<br>  But did not love the colour; woman's love,<br>  Save one, he not regarded, and so turned<br>  Sighing, and feigned a sleep until he slept.<br>  <br>     Then rose Elaine and glided through the fields,<br>  And past beneath the weirdly-sculptured gates<br>  Far up the dim rich city to her kin;<br>  There bode the night: but woke with dawn, and past<br>  Down through the dim rich city to the fields,<br>  Thence to the cave: so day by day she past<br>  In either twilight ghost-like to and fro<br>  Gliding, and every day she tended him,<br>  And likewise many a night: and Lancelot<br>  Would, though he called his wound a little hurt<br>  Whereof he should be quickly whole, at times<br>  Brain-feverous in his heat and agony, seem<br>  Uncourteous, even he: but the meek maid<br>  Sweetly forbore him ever, being to him<br>  Meeker than any child to a rough nurse,<br>  Milder than any mother to a sick child,<br>  And never woman yet, since man's first fall,<br>  Did kindlier unto man, but her deep love<br>  Upbore her; till the hermit, skilled in all<br>  The simples and the science of that time,<br>  Told him that her fine care had saved his life.<br>  And the sick man forgot her simple blush,<br>  Would call her friend and sister, sweet Elaine,<br>  Would listen for her coming and regret<br>  Her parting step, and held her tenderly,<br>  And loved her with all love except the love<br>  Of man and woman when they love their best,<br>  Closest and sweetest, and had died the death<br>  In any knightly fashion for her sake.<br>  And peradventure had he seen her first<br>  She might have made this and that other world<br>  Another world for the sick man; but now<br>  The shackles of an old love straitened him,<br>  His honour rooted in dishonour stood,<br>  And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true.<br>  <br>     Yet the great knight in his mid-sickness made<br>  Full many a holy vow and pure resolve.<br>  These, as but born of sickness, could not live:<br>  For when the blood ran lustier in him again,<br>  Full often the bright image of one face,<br>  Making a treacherous quiet in his heart,<br>  Dispersed his resolution like a cloud.<br>  Then if the maiden, while that ghostly grace<br>  Beamed on his fancy, spoke, he answered not,<br>  Or short and coldly, and she knew right well<br>  What the rough sickness meant, but what this meant<br>  She knew not, and the sorrow dimmed her sight,<br>  And drave her ere her time across the fields<br>  Far into the rich city, where alone<br>  She murmured, "Vain, in vain: it cannot be.<br>  He will not love me: how then? must I die?"<br>  Then as a little helpless innocent bird,<br>  That has but one plain passage of few notes,<br>  Will sing the simple passage o'er and o'er<br>  For all an April morning, till the ear<br>  Wearies to hear it, so the simple maid<br>  Went half the night repeating, "Must I die?"<br>  And now to right she turned, and now to left,<br>  And found no ease in turning or in rest;<br>  And "Him or death," she muttered, "death or him,"<br>  Again and like a burthen, "Him or death."<br>  <br>     But when Sir Lancelot's deadly hurt was whole,<br>  To Astolat returning rode the three.<br>  There morn by morn, arraying her sweet self<br>  In that wherein she deemed she looked her best,<br>  She came before Sir Lancelot, for she thought<br>  "If I be loved, these are my festal robes,<br>  If not, the victim's flowers before he fall."<br>  And Lancelot ever prest upon the maid<br>  That she should ask some goodly gift of him<br>  For her own self or hers; "and do not shun<br>  To speak the wish most near to your true heart;<br>  Such service have ye done me, that I make<br>  My will of yours, and Prince and Lord am I<br>  In mine own land, and what I will I can."<br>  Then like a ghost she lifted up her face,<br>  But like a ghost without the power to speak.<br>  And Lancelot saw that she withheld her wish,<br>  And bode among them yet a little space<br>  Till he should learn it; and one morn it chanced<br>  He found her in among the garden yews,<br>  And said, "Delay no longer, speak your wish,<br>  Seeing I go today:" then out she brake:<br>  "Going? and we shall never see you more.<br>  And I must die for want of one bold word."<br>  "Speak: that I live to hear," he said, "is yours."<br>  Then suddenly and passionately she spoke:<br>  "I have gone mad. I love you: let me die."<br>  "Ah, sister," answered Lancelot, "what is this?"<br>  And innocently extending her white arms,<br>  "Your love," she said, "your love--to be your wife."<br>  And Lancelot answered, "Had I chosen to wed,<br>  I had been wedded earlier, sweet Elaine:<br>  But now there never will be wife of mine."<br>  "No, no," she cried, "I care not to be wife,<br>  </a><a> But to be with you still, to see your face, <br>  To serve you, and to follow you through the world."<br>  And Lancelot answered, "Nay, the world, the world,<br>  All ear and eye, with such a stupid heart<br>  To interpret ear and eye, and such a tongue<br>  To blare its own interpretation--nay,<br>  Full ill then should I quit your brother's love,<br>  And your good father's kindness." And she said,<br>  "Not to be with you, not to see your face--<br>  Alas for me then, my good days are done."<br>  "Nay, noble maid," he answered, "ten times nay!<br>  This is not love: but love's first flash in youth,<br>  Most common: yea, I know it of mine own self:<br>  And you yourself will smile at your own self<br>  Hereafter, when you yield your flower of life<br>  To one more fitly yours, not thrice your age:<br>  And then will I, for true you are and sweet<br>  Beyond mine old belief in womanhood,<br>  More specially should your good knight be poor,<br>  Endow you with broad land and territory<br>  Even to the half my realm beyond the seas,<br>  So that would make you happy: furthermore,<br>  Even to the death, as though ye were my blood,<br>  In all your quarrels will I be your knight.<br>  This will I do, dear damsel, for your sake,<br>  And more than this I cannot."<br>  <br>                                        While he spoke<br>  She neither blushed nor shook, but deathly-pale<br>  Stood grasping what was nearest, then replied:<br>  "Of all this will I nothing;" and so fell,<br>  And thus they bore her swooning to her tower.<br>  <br>     Then spake, to whom through those black walls of yew<br>  Their talk had pierced, her father: "Ay, a flash,<br>  I fear me, that will strike my blossom dead.<br>  Too courteous are ye, fair Lord Lancelot.<br>  I pray you, use some rough discourtesy<br>  To blunt or break her passion."<br>  <br>                                     Lancelot said,<br>  "That were against me: what I can I will;"<br>  And there that day remained, and toward even<br>  Sent for his shield: full meekly rose the maid,<br>  Stript off the case, and gave the naked shield;<br>  Then, when she heard his horse upon the stones,<br>  Unclasping flung the casement back, and looked<br>  Down on his helm, from which her sleeve had gone.<br>  And Lancelot knew the little clinking sound;<br>  And she by tact of love was well aware<br>  That Lancelot knew that she was looking at him.<br>  And yet he glanced not up, nor waved his hand,<br>  Nor bad farewell, but sadly rode away.<br>  This was the one discourtesy that he used.<br>  <br>     So in her tower alone the maiden sat:<br>  His very shield was gone; only the case,<br>  Her own poor work, her empty labour, left.<br>  But still she heard him, still his picture formed<br>  And grew between her and the pictured wall.<br>  Then came her father, saying in low tones,<br>  "Have comfort," whom she greeted quietly.<br>  Then came her brethren saying, "Peace to thee,<br>  Sweet sister," whom she answered with all calm.<br>  But when they left her to herself again,<br>  Death, like a friend's voice from a distant field<br>  Approaching through the darkness, called; the owls<br>  Wailing had power upon her, and she mixt<br>  Her fancies with the sallow-rifted glooms<br>  Of evening, and the moanings of the wind.<br>  <br>     And in those days she made a little song,<br>  And called her song "The Song of Love and Death,"<br>  And sang it: sweetly could she make and sing.<br>  <br>     "Sweet is true love though given in vain, in vain;<br>  And sweet is death who puts an end to pain:<br>  I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.<br>  <br>     "Love, art thou sweet? then bitter death must be:<br>  Love, thou art bitter; sweet is death to me.<br>  O Love, if death be sweeter, let me die.<br>  <br>     "Sweet love, that seems not made to fade away,<br>  Sweet death, that seems to make us loveless clay,<br>  I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.<br>  <br>     "I fain would follow love, if that could be;<br>  I needs must follow death, who calls for me;<br>  Call and I follow, I follow! let me die."<br>  <br>     High with the last line scaled her voice, and this,<br>  All in a fiery dawning wild with wind<br>  That shook her tower, the brothers heard, and thought<br>  With shuddering, "Hark the Phantom of the house<br>  That ever shrieks before a death," and called<br>  The father, and all three in hurry and fear<br>  Ran to her, and lo! the blood-red light of dawn<br>  Flared on her face, she shrilling, "Let me die!"<br>  <br>     As when we dwell upon a word we know,<br>  Repeating, till the word we know so well<br>  Becomes a wonder, and we know not why,<br>  So dwelt the father on her face, and thought<br>  "Is this Elaine?" till back the maiden fell,<br>  Then gave a languid hand to each, and lay,<br>  Speaking a still good-morrow with her eyes.<br>  At last she said, "Sweet brothers, yesternight<br>  I seemed a curious little maid again,<br>  As happy as when we dwelt among the woods,<br>  And when ye used to take me with the flood<br>  Up the great river in the boatman's boat.<br>  Only ye would not pass beyond the cape<br>  That has the poplar on it: there ye fixt<br>  Your limit, oft returning with the tide.<br>  And yet I cried because ye would not pass<br>  Beyond it, and far up the shining flood<br>  Until we found the palace of the King.<br>  And yet ye would not; but this night I dreamed<br>  That I was all alone upon the flood,<br>  And then I said, 'Now shall I have my will:'<br>  And there I woke, but still the wish remained.<br>  So let me hence that I may pass at last<br>  Beyond the poplar and far up the flood,<br>  Until I find the palace of the King.<br>  There will I enter in among them all,<br>  And no man there will dare to mock at me;<br>  But there the fine Gawain will wonder at me,<br>  And there the great Sir Lancelot muse at me;<br>  Gawain, who bad a thousand farewells to me,<br>  Lancelot, who coldly went, nor bad me one:<br>  And there the King will know me and my love,<br>  And there the Queen herself will pity me,<br>  And all the gentle court will welcome me,<br>  And after my long voyage I shall rest!"<br>  <br>     "Peace," said her father, "O my child, ye seem<br>  Light-headed, for what force is yours to go<br>  So far, being sick? and wherefore would ye look<br>  On this proud fellow again, who scorns us all?"<br>  <br>     Then the rough Torre began to heave and move,<br>  And bluster into stormy sobs and say,<br>  "I never loved him: an I meet with him,<br>  I care not howsoever great he be,<br>  Then will I strike at him and strike him down,<br>  Give me good fortune, I will strike him dead,<br>  For this discomfort he hath done the house."<br>  <br>     To whom the gentle sister made reply,<br>  "Fret not yourself, dear brother, nor be wroth,<br>  Seeing it is no more Sir Lancelot's fault<br>  Not to love me, than it is mine to love<br>  Him of all men who seems to me the highest."<br>  <br>     "Highest?" the father answered, echoing "highest?"<br>  (He meant to break the passion in her) "nay,<br>  Daughter, I know not what you call the highest;<br>  But this I know, for all the people know it,<br>  He loves the Queen, and in an open shame:<br>  And she returns his love in open shame;<br>  If this be high, what is it to be low?"<br>  <br>     Then spake the lily maid of Astolat:<br>  "Sweet father, all too faint and sick am I<br>  For anger: these are slanders: never yet<br>  Was noble man but made ignoble talk.<br>  He makes no friend who never made a foe.<br>  But now it is my glory to have loved<br>  One peerless, without stain: so let me pass,<br>  My father, howsoe'er I seem to you,<br>  Not all unhappy, having loved God's best<br>  And greatest, though my love had no return:<br>  Yet, seeing you desire your child to live,<br>  Thanks, but you work against your own desire;<br>  For if I could believe the things you say<br>  I should but die the sooner; wherefore cease,<br>  Sweet father, and bid call the ghostly man<br>  Hither, and let me shrive me clean, and die."<br>  <br>     So when the ghostly man had come and gone,<br>  She with a face, bright as for sin forgiven,<br>  Besought Lavaine to write as she devised<br>  A letter, word for word; and when he asked<br>  "Is it for Lancelot, is it for my dear lord?<br>  Then will I bear it gladly;" she replied,<br>  "For Lancelot and the Queen and all the world,<br>  But I myself must bear it." Then he wrote<br>  The letter she devised; which being writ<br>  And folded, "O sweet father, tender and true,<br>  Deny me not," she said--"ye never yet<br>  Denied my fancies--this, however strange,<br>  My latest: lay the letter in my hand<br>  A little ere I die, and close the hand<br>  Upon it; I shall guard it even in death.<br>  And when the heat is gone from out my heart,<br>  Then take the little bed on which I died<br>  For Lancelot's love, and deck it like the Queen's<br>  For richness, and me also like the Queen<br>  In all I have of rich, and lay me on it.<br>  And let there be prepared a chariot-bier<br>  To take me to the river, and a barge<br>  Be ready on the river, clothed in black.<br>  I go in state to court, to meet the Queen.<br>  There surely I shall speak for mine own self,<br>  And none of you can speak for me so well.<br>  And therefore let our dumb old man alone<br>  Go with me, he can steer and row, and he<br>  Will guide me to that palace, to the doors."<br>  <br>     She ceased: her father promised; whereupon<br>  She grew so cheerful that they deemed her death<br>  Was rather in the fantasy than the blood.<br>  But ten slow mornings past, and on the eleventh<br>  Her father laid the letter in her hand,<br>  And closed the hand upon it, and she died.<br>  So that day there was dole in Astolat.<br>  <br>     But when the next sun brake from underground,<br>  Then, those two brethren slowly with bent brows<br>  Accompanying, the sad chariot-bier<br>  Past like a shadow through the field, that shone<br>  Full-summer, to that stream whereon the barge,<br>  Palled all its length in blackest samite, lay.<br>  There sat the lifelong creature of the house,<br>  Loyal, the dumb old servitor, on deck,<br>  Winking his eyes, and twisted all his face.<br>  </a><a> So those two brethren from the chariot took <br>  And on the black decks laid her in her bed,<br>  Set in her hand a lily, o'er her hung<br>  The silken case with braided blazonings,<br>  And kissed her quiet brows, and saying to her<br>  "Sister, farewell for ever," and again<br>  "Farewell, sweet sister," parted all in tears.<br>  Then rose the dumb old servitor, and the dead,<br>  Oared by the dumb, went upward with the flood--<br>  In her right hand the lily, in her left<br>  The letter--all her bright hair streaming down--<br>  And all the coverlid was cloth of gold<br>  Drawn to her waist, and she herself in white<br>  All but her face, and that clear-featured face<br>  Was lovely, for she did not seem as dead,<br>  But fast asleep, and lay as though she smiled.<br>  <br>     That day Sir Lancelot at the palace craved<br>  Audience of Guinevere, to give at last<br>  The price of half a realm, his costly gift,<br>  Hard-won and hardly won with bruise and blow,<br>  With deaths of others, and almost his own,<br>  The nine-years-fought-for diamonds: for he saw<br>  One of her house, and sent him to the Queen<br>  Bearing his wish, whereto the Queen agreed<br>  With such and so unmoved a majesty<br>  She might have seemed her statue, but that he,<br>  Low-drooping till he wellnigh kissed her feet<br>  For loyal awe, saw with a sidelong eye<br>  The shadow of some piece of pointed lace,<br>  In the Queen's shadow, vibrate on the walls,<br>  And parted, laughing in his courtly heart.<br>  <br>     All in an oriel on the summer side,<br>  Vine-clad, of Arthur's palace toward the stream,<br>  They met, and Lancelot kneeling uttered, "Queen,<br>  Lady, my liege, in whom I have my joy,<br>  Take, what I had not won except for you,<br>  These jewels, and make me happy, making them<br>  An armlet for the roundest arm on earth,<br>  Or necklace for a neck to which the swan's<br>  Is tawnier than her cygnet's: these are words:<br>  Your beauty is your beauty, and I sin<br>  In speaking, yet O grant my worship of it<br>  Words, as we grant grief tears. Such sin in words<br>  Perchance, we both can pardon: but, my Queen,<br>  I hear of rumours flying through your court.<br>  Our bond, as not the bond of man and wife,<br>  Should have in it an absoluter trust<br>  To make up that defect: let rumours be:<br>  When did not rumours fly? these, as I trust<br>  That you trust me in your own nobleness,<br>  I may not well believe that you believe."<br>  <br>     While thus he spoke, half turned away, the Queen<br>  Brake from the vast oriel-embowering vine<br>  Leaf after leaf, and tore, and cast them off,<br>  Till all the place whereon she stood was green;<br>  Then, when he ceased, in one cold passive hand<br>  Received at once and laid aside the gems<br>  There on a table near her, and replied:<br>  <br>     "It may be, I am quicker of belief<br>  Than you believe me, Lancelot of the Lake.<br>  Our bond is not the bond of man and wife.<br>  This good is in it, whatsoe'er of ill,<br>  It can be broken easier. I for you<br>  This many a year have done despite and wrong<br>  To one whom ever in my heart of hearts<br>  I did acknowledge nobler. What are these?<br>  Diamonds for me! they had been thrice their worth<br>  Being your gift, had you not lost your own.<br>  To loyal hearts the value of all gifts<br>  Must vary as the giver's. Not for me!<br>  For her! for your new fancy. Only this<br>  Grant me, I pray you: have your joys apart.<br>  I doubt not that however changed, you keep<br>  So much of what is graceful: and myself<br>  Would shun to break those bounds of courtesy<br>  In which as Arthur's Queen I move and rule:<br>  So cannot speak my mind. An end to this!<br>  A strange one! yet I take it with Amen.<br>  So pray you, add my diamonds to her pearls;<br>  Deck her with these; tell her, she shines me down:<br>  An armlet for an arm to which the Queen's<br>  Is haggard, or a necklace for a neck<br>  O as much fairer--as a faith once fair<br>  Was richer than these diamonds--hers not mine--<br>  Nay, by the mother of our Lord himself, <br>  Or hers or mine, mine now to work my will--<br>  She shall not have them."<br>  <br>  </a><a>                   Saying which she seized, <br>  And, through the casement standing wide for heat,<br>  Flung them, and down they flashed, and smote the stream<br>  Then from the smitten surface flashed, as it were,<br>  Diamonds to meet them, and they past away.<br>  Then while Sir Lancelot leant, in half disdain<br>  At love, life, all things, on the window ledge,<br>  Close underneath his eyes, and right across<br>  Where these had fallen, slowly past the barge<br>  Whereon the lily maid of Astolat<br>  Lay smiling, like a star in blackest night.<br>  <br>     </a><a> But the wild Queen, who saw not, burst away <br>  To weep and wail in secret; and the barge,<br>  On to the palace-doorway sliding, paused.<br>  </a><a> There two stood armed, and kept the door; to whom, <br>  All up the marble stair, tier over tier, <br>  Were added mouths that gaped, and eyes that asked<br>  "What is it?" but the oarsman's haggard face,<br>  As hard and still as is the face that men<br>  Shape to their fancy's eye from broken rocks<br>  On some cliff-side, appalled them, and they said,<br>  "He is enchanted, cannot speak--and she,<br>  Look how she sleeps--the Fairy Queen, so fair!<br>  Yea, but how pale! what are they? flesh and blood?<br>  Or come to take the King to Fairyland?<br>  For some do hold our Arthur cannot die,<br>  But that he passes into Fairyland."<br>  <br>     While thus they babbled of the King, the King<br>  Came girt with knights: then turned the tongueless man<br>  From the half-face to the full eye, and rose<br>  And pointed to the damsel, and the doors.<br>  So Arthur bad the meek Sir Percivale<br>  And pure Sir Galahad to uplift the maid;<br>  And reverently they bore her into hall.<br>  Then came the fine Gawain and wondered at her,<br>  And Lancelot later came and mused at her,<br>  And last the Queen herself, and pitied her:<br>  But Arthur spied the letter in her hand,<br>  Stoopt, took, brake seal, and read it; this was all:<br>  <br>     "Most noble lord, Sir Lancelot of the Lake,<br>  I, sometime called the maid of Astolat,<br>  Come, for you left me taking no farewell,<br>  Hither, to take my last farewell of you.<br>  I loved you, and my love had no return,<br>  And therefore my true love has been my death.<br>  And therefore to our Lady Guinevere,<br>  And to all other ladies, I make moan:<br>  Pray for my soul, and yield me burial.<br>  Pray for my soul thou too, Sir Lancelot,<br>  As thou art a knight peerless."<br>  <br>                                       Thus he read;<br>  And ever in the reading, lords and dames<br>  Wept, looking often from his face who read<br>  To hers which lay so silent, and at times,<br>  So touched were they, half-thinking that her lips,<br>  Who had devised the letter, moved again.<br>  <br>     Then freely spoke Sir Lancelot to them all:<br>  "My lord liege Arthur, and all ye that hear,<br>  Know that for this most gentle maiden's death<br>  Right heavy am I; for good she was and true,<br>  But loved me with a love beyond all love<br>  In women, whomsoever I have known.<br>  Yet to be loved makes not to love again;<br>  Not at my years, however it hold in youth.<br>  I swear by truth and knighthood that I gave<br>  No cause, not willingly, for such a love:<br>  To this I call my friends in testimony,<br>  Her brethren, and her father, who himself<br>  Besought me to be plain and blunt, and use,<br>  To break her passion, some discourtesy<br>  Against my nature: what I could, I did.<br>  I left her and I bad her no farewell;<br>  Though had I dreamt the damsel would have died,<br>  I might have put my wits to some rough use,<br>  And helped her from herself."<br>  <br>                                     Then said the Queen<br>  (Sea was her wrath, yet working after storm)<br>  "Ye might at least have done her so much grace,<br>  Fair lord, as would have helped her from her death."<br>  He raised his head, their eyes met and hers fell,<br>  He adding,<br>  <br>                  "Queen, she would not be content<br>  Save that I wedded her, which could not be.<br>  Then might she follow me through the world, she asked;<br>  It could not be. I told her that her love<br>  Was but the flash of youth, would darken down<br>  To rise hereafter in a stiller flame<br>  Toward one more worthy of her--then would I,<br>  More specially were he, she wedded, poor,<br>  Estate them with large land and territory<br>  In mine own realm beyond the narrow seas,<br>  To keep them in all joyance: more than this<br>  I could not; this she would not, and she died."<br>  <br>     He pausing, Arthur answered, "O my knight,<br>  It will be to thy worship, as my knight,<br>  And mine, as head of all our Table Round,<br>  To see that she be buried worshipfully."<br>  <br>  </a><a>    So toward that shrine which then in all the realm <br>  Was richest, Arthur leading, slowly went<br>  The marshalled Order of their Table Round,<br>  And Lancelot sad beyond his wont, to see<br>  The maiden buried, not as one unknown,<br>  Nor meanly, but with gorgeous obsequies,<br>  And mass, and rolling music, like a queen.<br>  And when the knights had laid her comely head<br>  Low in the dust of half-forgotten kings,<br>  Then Arthur spake among them, "Let her tomb<br>  Be costly, and her image thereupon,<br>  And let the shield of Lancelot at her feet<br>  Be carven, and her lily in her hand.<br>  And let the story of her dolorous voyage<br>  For all true hearts be blazoned on her tomb<br>  In letters gold and azure!" which was wrought<br>  Thereafter; but when now the lords and dames<br>  And people, from the high door streaming, brake<br>  Disorderly, as homeward each, the Queen,<br>  Who marked Sir Lancelot where he moved apart,<br>  Drew near, and sighed in passing, "Lancelot,<br>  Forgive me; mine was jealousy in love."<br>  He answered with his eyes upon the ground,<br>  "That is love's curse; pass on, my Queen, forgiven."<br>  But Arthur, who beheld his cloudy brows,<br>  Approached him, and with full affection said,<br>  <br>     "Lancelot, my Lancelot, thou in whom I have<br>  Most joy and most affiance, for I know<br>  What thou hast been in battle by my side,<br>  And many a time have watched thee at the tilt<br>  Strike down the lusty and long practised knight,<br>  And let the younger and unskilled go by<br>  To win his honour and to make his name,<br>  And loved thy courtesies and thee, a man<br>  Made to be loved; but now I would to God,<br>  Seeing the homeless trouble in thine eyes,<br>  Thou couldst have loved this maiden, shaped, it seems,<br>  By God for thee alone, and from her face,<br>  If one may judge the living by the dead,<br>  Delicately pure and marvellously fair,<br>  Who might have brought thee, now a lonely man<br>  Wifeless and heirless, noble issue, sons<br>  Born to the glory of thy name and fame,<br>  My knight, the great Sir Lancelot of the Lake."<br>  <br>     Then answered Lancelot, "Fair she was, my King,<br>  Pure, as you ever wish your knights to be.<br>  To doubt her fairness were to want an eye,<br>  To doubt her pureness were to want a heart--<br>  Yea, to be loved, if what is worthy love<br>  Could bind him, but free love will not be bound."<br>  <br>     "Free love, so bound, were freëst," said the King.<br>  "Let love be free; free love is for the best:<br>  And, after heaven,  on our dull side of death,<br>  What should be best, if not so pure a love<br>  Clothed in so pure a loveliness? yet thee<br>  She failed to bind, though being, as I think,<br>  Unbound as yet, and gentle, as I know."<br>  <br>     And Lancelot answered nothing, but he went,<br>  And at the inrunning of a little brook<br>  Sat by the river in a cove, and watched<br>  The high reed wave, and lifted up his eyes<br>  And saw the barge that brought her moving down,<br>  Far-off, a blot upon the stream, and said<br>  Low in himself, "Ah simple heart and sweet,<br>  Ye loved me, damsel, surely with a love<br>  Far tenderer than my Queen's. Pray for thy soul?<br>  Ay, that will I. Farewell too--now at last--<br>  </a><a> Farewell, fair lily. 'Jealousy in love?' <br>  Not rather dead love's harsh heir, jealous pride?<br>  Queen, if I grant the jealousy as of love,<br>  May not your crescent fear for name and fame<br>  Speak, as it waxes, of a love that wanes?<br>  Why did the King dwell on my name to me?<br>  Mine own name shames me, seeming a reproach,<br>  </a><a> Lancelot, whom the Lady of the Lake <br>  Caught from his mother's arms--the wondrous one<br>  Who passes through the vision of the night--<br>  She chanted snatches of mysterious hymns<br>  Heard on the winding waters, eve and morn<br>  She kissed me saying, 'Thou art fair, my child,<br>  As a king's son,' and often in her arms<br>  She bare me, pacing on the dusky mere.<br>  Would she had drowned me in it, where'er it be!<br>  For what am I? what profits me my name<br>  Of greatest knight? I fought for it, and have it:<br>  Pleasure to have it, none; to lose it, pain;<br>  Now grown a part of me: but what use in it?<br>  To make men worse by making my sin known?<br>  Or sin seem less, the sinner seeming great?<br>  Alas for Arthur's greatest knight, a man<br>  Not after Arthur's heart! I needs must break<br>  These bonds that so defame me: not without<br>  She wills it: would I, if she willed it? nay,<br>  Who knows? but if I would not, then may God,<br>  I pray him, send a sudden Angel down<br>  To seize me by the hair and bear me far,<br>  And fling me deep in that forgotten mere,<br>  Among the tumbled fragments of the hills."<br>  <br>     So groaned Sir Lancelot in remorseful pain,<br>  Not knowing he should die a holy man.<br>
