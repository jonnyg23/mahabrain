Well befal<br>  This day, whereon I see thee nigh,<br>  O Lancelot, before I die!<br>  And surely shall my heart rejoice<br>  Sir Gawain, when I hear thy voice!"<br>  <br>  Then Lancelot laughed: "Thou knowest us then<br>  Full well among a many men?"<br>  <br>  "As quoth the lion to the mouse,"<br>  The man said; "in King Arthur's House<br>  Men are not names of men alone,<br>  But coffers rather of deeds done."<br>  <br>  The Queen smiled blithe of heart, and spake:<br>  "Hast thou done deeds for ladies' sake?"<br>  <br>  "Nay Dame," he said, "I am but young;<br>  A little have I lived and sung<br>  And seen thy face this happy noon."<br>  <br>  The King said: "May we hearken soon<br>  Some merry tale of thee? for I<br>  Am skilled to know men low and high<br>  And deem thee neither churl nor fool."<br>  <br>  Said he, "My fathers went to school<br>  Where folk are taught a many things,<br>  But not by bliss: men called them kings<br>  In days when kings were near to seek;<br>  But as a long thread waxeth weak,<br>  So is it with our house; and now<br>  I wend me home from oaken bough<br>  Unto a stead where roof and wall<br>  Shall not have over far to fall<br>  When their last day comes."<br>              As he spake<br>  He reddened: "Nathless for their sake,<br>  Whom the world loved once, mock not me<br>  O King, if thence I bring to thee<br>  A morsel and a draught of wine,<br>  Though nothing king-like here thou dine."<br>  <br>  Of some kind word King Arthur thought,<br>  But ere he spake the woodman caught<br>  His forest-nag and leapt thereon,<br>  And through the tangled brake was gone.<br>  Then leapt the King down, glad at heart,<br>  Thinking, This day shall not depart<br>  Without some voice from days that were;<br>  And lightly leapt down Guenevere,<br>  And man and maid lay presently<br>  Neath the bee-laden branches high,<br>  And sweet the scent of trodden grass<br>  Amid the blossoms' perfume was.<br>  <br>  There long they lay, and little spake,<br>  As folk right loth the calm to break;<br>  Till lo upon the forest-breeze<br>  A noise of folk, and from the trees<br>  They came: the first-seen forester,<br>  A grizzled carle in such-like gear,<br>  And then two maidens poorly clad<br>  Though each a silver chaplet had<br>  And round her neck a golden chain:<br>  And last two varlets led a wain<br>  Drawn by white oxen well bedight<br>  With oaken boughs and lilies white;<br>  Therein there lay a cask of wine<br>  And baskets piled with bread full fine,<br>  And flesh of hart and roe and hare;<br>  And in the midst upon a chair<br>  Done over with a cloth of gold<br>  There sat a man exceeding old<br>  With long white locks: and clad was he<br>  No other than his company<br>  Save that a golden crown he bore<br>  Full fairly fashioned as of yore,<br>  And with a sword was girt about<br>  Such as few folk will see I doubt.<br>  Right great it was: the scabbard thin<br>  Was fashioned of a serpent's skin,<br>  In every scale a stone of worth;<br>  Of tooth of sea-lion of the north<br>  The cross was, and the blood-boot stone<br>  That heals the hurt the blade hath done<br>  Hung down therefrom in silken purse:<br>  The ruddy kin of Niblung's curse<br>  O'er tresses of a sea-wife's hair<br>  Was wrapped about the handle fair;<br>  And last a marvellous sapphire stone<br>  Amidst of the great pommel shone,<br>  A blue flame in the forest green.<br>  And Arthur deemed he ne'er had seen<br>  So fair a sword: nay not when he<br>  The wonder of the land-locked sea<br>  Drew from the stone that Christmas-tide.<br>  <br>  Now forth the forest youth did ride,<br>  Leapt down beside the King, and spake:<br>  "King Arthur for thy greatness' sake<br>  My grandsire comes to look on thee;<br>  My father standeth here by me;<br>  These maidens are my sisters twain;<br>  My brethren draw out from the wain<br>  Somewhat thy woodland cheer to mend."<br>  <br>  Thereat his sire the knee did bend<br>  Before the King, who o'er the brown<br>  Rough sleeve of the man's homespun gown<br>  Beheld a goodly golden ring:<br>  And fell to greater marvelling<br>  When he beheld how fine and fair<br>  The woodman's kneeling sisters were.<br>  And all folk thereby deemed in sooth<br>  That (save indeed the first seen youth)<br>  These folk were nobler e'en than those<br>  Of Arthur's wonder of a house.<br>  <br>  But now the elder drew anigh,<br>  By half a head was he more high<br>  Than Arthur or than Lancelot,<br>  Nor had eld bent him: he kneeled not<br>  Before the King, but smiling took<br>  His hands in hands that nowise shook;<br>  And the King joyed as he who sees<br>  One of his fathers' images<br>  Stand glad before him in a dream.<br>  <br>  Then down beside the bubbling stream<br>  They sat together, and the King<br>  Was loth to fall a questioning;<br>  So first the elder spake and said:<br>  <br>  "It joys me of thy goodlihead<br>  O great king of our land; and though<br>  Our blood within thee doth not flow,<br>  And I who was a king of yore<br>  May scarcely kneel thy feet before,<br>  Yet do I deem thy right the best<br>  Of all the kings who rule the West.<br>  I love thy name and fame: behold,<br>  King Arthur, I am grown so old<br>  In guilelessness, the Gods have sent,<br>  Be I content or uncontent,<br>  This gift unto my latter days<br>  That I may see as through a haze<br>  The lives and deeds of days to come:<br>  I laugh for some, I weep for some --<br>  I neither laugh nor weep for thee,<br>  But trembling through the clouds I see<br>  Thy life and glory to the end;<br>  And how the sweet and bitter blend<br>  Within the cup that thou must drink.<br>  Good is it that thou shalt not shrink<br>  From either: that the afterdays<br>  Shall still win glory from thy praise<br>  And scarce believe thee laid asleep<br>  When o'er thy deeds the days lie deep."<br>  <br>  He ceased but his old lips moved still,<br>  As though they would the tale fulfil<br>  His heart kept secret: Arthur's eyes<br>  Gleamed with the pride that needs would rise<br>  Up from his heart, and low he said:<br>  "I know the living by the dead<br>  I know the future by the past."<br>  Wise eyes and kind the elder cast<br>  Upon him; while a nameless fear<br>  Smote to the heart of Guenevere,<br>  And, fainting there, was turned to love:<br>  And thence a nameless pain did move<br>  The noble heart of Lancelot,<br>  The store of longing unforgot.<br>  -- And west a little moved the sun<br>  And noon began, and noon was done.<br>  <br>  But as the elder's grey eyes turned<br>  On Guenevere's, her sweet face burned<br>  With sweet shame; as though she knew<br>  He read her story through and through.<br>  Kindly he looked on her and said:<br>  "O Queen, the chief of goodlihead,<br>  Be blithe and glad this day at least<br>  When in my fathers' house ye feast:<br>  For surely in their ancient hall<br>  Ye sit now: look, there went the wall<br>  Where yon turf ridge runs west-away:<br>  Time was I heard my grand-dame say<br>  She saw this stream run bubbling down<br>  The hall-floor shut in trench of stone;<br>  Therein she washed her father's cup<br>  That last eve e'er the fire went up<br>  O'er ridge and rafter and she passed<br>  Betwixt the foeman's spears the last<br>  Of all the women, wrapping round<br>  This sword the gift of Odin's ground."<br>  <br>  He shook the weapon o'er his knee,<br>  Thereon gazed Arthur eagerly.<br>  "Draw it, my lord," quoth Guenevere,<br>  "Of such things have we little fear<br>  In Arthur's house." And Lancelot rose<br>  To look upon the treasure close.<br>  But grimly smiled the ancient man:<br>  "E'en as the sun arising wan<br>  In the black sky when Heimdall's horn<br>  Screams out and the last day is born,<br>  This blade to eyes of men shall be<br>  On that dread day I shall not see --"<br>  Fierce was his old face for a while:<br>  But once again he 'gan to smile<br>  And took the Queen's slim lily hand<br>  And set it on the deadly brand<br>  Then laughed and said: "Hold this, O Queen,<br>  Thine hand is where God's hands have been,<br>  For this is Tyrfing: who knows when<br>  His blade was forged? Belike ere men<br>  Had dwelling on the middle-earth.<br>  At least a man's life is it worth<br>  To draw it out once: so behold<br>  These peace-strings wrought of pearl and gold<br>  The scabbard to the cross that bind<br>  Lest a rash hand and heart made blind<br>  Should draw it forth unwittingly."<br>  <br>  Blithe laughed King Arthur: "Sir," said he,<br>  "We well may deem in days by gone<br>  This sword, the blade of such an one<br>  As thou hast been, would seldom slide<br>  Back to its sheath unsatisfied.<br>  Lo now how fair a feast thy kin<br>  Have dight for us and might we win<br>  Some tale of thee in Tyrfing's praise,<br>  Some deed he wrought in greener days,<br>  This were a blithesome hour indeed."<br>  <br>  "Sir," said the elder, "little need<br>  To pray me hereof.  Please ye dine<br>  And drink a cup of woodman's wine,<br>  Surely meantime some tale shall stir<br>  Within my heart of days that were."<br>  <br>  Then to their meat they gat and there<br>  Feasted amid the woodland fair<br>  The fairest folk of all the land.<br>  Ah me when first the Queen's fair hand<br>  Drew near the kneeling forest youth<br>  New-wrought the whole world seemed in sooth<br>  And nothing left therein of ill.<br>  So at the last the Queen did fill<br>  A cup of wine, and drank and said:<br>  "In memory of thy fathers dead<br>  I drink, fair lord, drink now with me<br>  And then bethink thee presently<br>  Of deeds that once won prize and praise<br>  The glory of thy fathers' days."<br>  He drank and laughed and said," Nay, nay,<br>  Keep we the peace-strings whole today.<br>  This draught from where thy lips have been<br>  Within mine old heart maketh green<br>  The memory of a love full true,<br>  The first recorded deed that drew<br>  My fathers' house from dark to light.<br>  <br>  If thus my grandame told aright,<br>  A rougher place our land was then,<br>  Quoth she, than with us living men,<br>  And other trees were in the wood<br>  And folk of somewhat other blood<br>  Than ours: then were the small-eyed bears<br>  More plenty in the woodland lairs<br>  Than badgers now: no holiday<br>  It was to chase the wolves away,<br>  Yea there were folk who had to tell<br>  Of lyngworms lying on the fell,<br>  And fearful things by lake and fen,<br>  And manlike shapes that were not men.<br>  Then fay-folk roamed the woods at noon,<br>  And on the grave-mound in the moon<br>  Faint gleamed the flickering treasure-flame.<br>  Days of the world that won no fame,<br>  Yet now, quoth she, folk looking back<br>  Across the tumult and the wrack<br>  And swelling up of windy lies<br>  And dull fool-fashioned cruelties,<br>  Deem that in those days God abode<br>  On earth and shared ill times and good<br>  And right and wrong with that same folk<br>  Their hands had fashioned for the yoke.<br>  Quoth she, of such nought tells my tale,<br>  Yet saith that such as should prevail<br>  In those days o'er the fears of earth<br>  Must needs have been some deal of worth,<br>  And saith that had ye seen a kin<br>  Who dwelt these very woods within<br>  Them at the least ye would have told<br>  For cousins of the Gods of old.<br>  Amongst all these it tells of one,<br>  The goodman's last-begotten son,<br>  Some twenty summers old: as fair<br>  As any flower that blossomed there<br>  In sun and rain, and strong therewith<br>  And lissom as a willow withe.<br>  Now through these woods amidst of June<br>  This youngling went until at noon<br>  From out of the thicket his fair face<br>  Peered forth upon this very place;<br>  For he had been a-hunting nigh<br>  And wearied thought a while to lie<br>  Beside the freshness of the stream.<br>  But lo as in a morning dream<br>  The place was changed, for there was dight<br>  A fair pavilion blue and white<br>  E'en where we play, and all around<br>  Was talk of men and diverse sound,<br>  Tinkling of bit and neigh of steed<br>  Clashing of arms and iron weed.<br>  For round about the painted tent<br>  Armed folk a many came or went,<br>  Or on the fresh grass lay about.<br>  Surely our youth at first had doubt<br>  If 'twere not better to be gone<br>  Than meet these stranger folk alone --<br>  But wot ye well such things as these<br>  Were new to him born mid the trees<br>  And wild things: and he thought, Maybe<br>  The household of the Gods I see:<br>  Who for as many tales as I<br>  Have heard of them, I ne'er saw nigh.<br>  If they be men, I wotted not<br>  That such fair raiment men had got;<br>  They will be glad to show them then.<br>  <br>  For one thing taught these woodland men<br>  Whatever wisdom they let fall<br>  Men since have won Fear nought at all.<br>  <br>  So from the holly brake he strode<br>  Shouldering the while his hunter's load,<br>  A new slain roe; but there arose<br>  To meet him half a score of those<br>  Whom in fair words he greeted well.<br>  <br>  Now was he clad in a sheep's fell <br>  And at his back his quiver hung,<br>  His woodknife on his thigh: unstrung<br>  His bow he held in a staff's stead.<br>  An oaken wreath was round his head<br>  From whence his crispy locks of brown<br>  Well nigh unto his belt hung down,<br>  And howso frank his eyes might be<br>  A half-frown soothly might you see<br>  As these men handled sword or spear<br>  And cried out, "Hold, what dost thou here?"<br>  "Ah," said he, "then no Gods ye are.<br>  Fear not, I shall not make you war."<br>  Therewith his hunting-knife he drew<br>  And the long blade before them he threw.<br>  Then loud they laughed; one sheathed his sword:<br>  "Thanks, army-leader, for that word!<br>  We are not Gods e'en as thou say'st,<br>  Nor thou a devil of the waste<br>  But e'en a devil's a friend belike."<br>  Something [of] hate hereat did strike<br>  Unto the woodsman's unused heart,<br>  Yet he spake softly for his part:<br>  "What men are ye and where dwell ye?<br>  What is the wondrous house I see?"<br>  "In the fair southland is our home<br>  Yet from the north as now we come,"<br>  Said one: then with a mocking smile,<br>  "And in our house there dwells awhile<br>  A very Goddess of the north.<br>  But lo you, take a thing of worth<br>  For that thy quarry, and begone."<br>  <br>  But as he spake another one<br>  Spake softly in his ear: and so<br>  The word from this to that did go,<br>  With laughing that seemed nowise good<br>  Unto the dweller of the wood,<br>  Who saying nought moved toward the tent.<br>  But they came round him as he went<br>  And said: "Nay, pagan, stay thy feet;<br>  Thou art not one our dame to greet<br>  <br>  [The poem ends at this point.]<br>
